Abstract: The interfacial physical properties of bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP) and its derivatives with three oleoyl chains (hemi-BDP) and four oleoyl chains (bis(diacylglycero)phosphate, BDP) were investigated using Langmuir monomolecular films. The mean molecular area of BMP at the collapse surface pressure (45mN m−1) was similar to those measured with other phospholipids bearing two acyl chains (66 and 59.6Å2 molecule−1 at pH 5.5 and 8.0, respectively). In Hemi-BDP and BDP, the mean molecular area increased by 26 and 35Å2 molecule−1 per additional acyl chain at pH 5.5 and 8.0, respectively. When BMP was added to a phospholipid mixture mimicking late endosome membrane composition at pH 8.0, the mean phospholipid molecular area increased by 7% regardless of the surface pressure. In contrast, the variation in molecular area was surface pressure-dependent at pH 5.5, a pH value close to that of intra-endosomal content. BMP and hemi-BDP, but not BDP, were hydrolyzed by pancreatic lipase-related protein 2 (PLRP2), which exhibits phospholipase A1 activity. At pH 5.5, the maximum activities of PLRP2 on BMP were recorded at high surface pressures (25–35mN/m). At pH 8.0, the PLRP2 activity vs. surface pressure showed a bell-shaped curve with maximum activities at 15mN/m for both BMP and hemi-BDP. This is a new activity for this enzyme which could degrade cellular BMP since both human PLRP2 (HPLRP2) and BMP were localized in human monocytic THP-1 cells. This is the first report on the cellular localization of HPLRP2 in human monocytes.

Abstract: A study of the polar lipids of Clostridium novyi NT has revealed the presence of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and cardiolipin as major phospholipids with smaller amounts of phosphatidylglycerol (PG), lysyl-PG and alanyl-PG. Other minor phospholipids included phosphatidic acid, CDP-diacylglycerol, phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylthreonine (PT). PE, PG and amino acyl PG were present in both the diacyl and alk-1′-enyl acyl (plasmalogen) forms and cardiolipin plasmalogens were found to contain one or two alk-1′-enyl chains. In contrast, the precursor lipids phosphatidic acid, CDP-diacylglycerol and PS were present almost exclusively as diacyl phospholipids. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that plasmalogens are formed from diacylated phospholipids at a late stage of phospholipid formation in Clostridium species. This novel pathway contrasts with the route in animals in which a saturated ether bond is formed at an early stage of plasmalogen biosynthesis and the alk-1-enyl bond is formed by an aerobic mechanism.

Abstract: Coenzyme Q (ubiquinone or Q) is a lipid electron and proton carrier in the electron transport chain. In yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae eleven genes, designated COQ1 through COQ9, YAH1 and ARH1, have been identified as being required for Q biosynthesis. One of these genes, COQ8 (ABC1), encodes an atypical protein kinase, containing six (I, II, III, VIB, VII, and VIII) of the twelve motifs characteristically present in canonical protein kinases. Here we characterize seven distinct Q-less coq8 yeast mutants and show that unlike the coq8 null mutant, each maintained normal steady-state levels of the Coq8 polypeptide. The phosphorylation states of Coq polypeptides were determined with two-dimensional gel analyses. Coq3p, Coq5p, and Coq7p were phosphorylated in a Coq8p-dependent manner. Expression of a human homolog of Coq8p, ADCK3(CABC1) bearing an amino-terminal yeast mitochondrial leader sequence, rescued growth of yeast coq8 mutants on medium containing a nonfermentable carbon source and partially restored biosynthesis of Q6. The phosphorylation state of several of the yeast Coq polypeptides was also rescued, indicating a profound conservation of yeast Coq8p and human ADCK3 protein kinase function in Q biosynthesis.

Abstract: Metabolic adaptations are triggered in the maternal organism to synthesize milk with an adequate concentration of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) required to the newborn. They may be a high uptake of dietary linoleic acid and its conversion to LC-PUFAs by desaturases of fatty acids (FADS) 1 and 2 in the mammary gland (MG). It is unknown if they also occur from onset of pregnancy. The aim of this study was to explore the participation of the MG as a mechanism involved in LC-PUFAs synthesis to support their demand during pregnancy and lactation in rats. The expression of desaturases in MG was significantly (P<0.05) higher (12.3-fold for FADS1 and 41.2-fold for FADS2) during the late pregnancy and throughout lactation (31.7-fold for FADS1 and 67.1-fold higher for FADS2) than in nonpregnant rats. SREBF-1c showed a similar pattern of increase during pregnancy but remained higher only during the early lactation (11.7-fold, P<0.005). Transcript of ELOVL6 and FASN increased throughout pregnancy and lactation, respectively. ELOVL5 mRNA increased in MG only during lactation (2.8 to 5.3-fold, P<0.005). Accordingly, a higher content of LC-PUFAs was found in lactating MG than in nonpregnant rats. Results suggest that MG participates from late pregnancy and throughout lactation by expressing desaturases and elongases as a mechanism involved in LC-PUFAs synthesis, probably by SREBF-1c. Because desaturases and ELOVL5 were expressed in cultured lactocytes and such expression was downregulated by linoleic and arachidonic acid, these cells may be a useful model for understanding the regulatory mechanisms for LC-PUFAs synthesis in MG.

Abstract: Patients with cystic fibrosis consistently demonstrate selective abnormalities in essential fatty acid concentrations, including decreased linoleate (LA) and docosahexaenoate (DHA), with variably increased arachidonate (AA). These changes appear important for the pathophysiology of the disease. However, the mechanisms of these changes are not clearly understood. The current study demonstrates that metabolism of LA and alpha linolenate (LNA) to AA and eicosapentaenoate (EPA), respectively, are significantly increased in two different cell culture models of cystic fibrosis. These changes correlated with increased expression of fatty acid Δ5- and Δ6-desaturases, key enzymes in this metabolic pathway. In contrast, cystic fibrosis cells showed decreased metabolism of AA and EPA to docosapentaenoate (DPA) and docosahexaenoate (DHA), respectively, although metabolism of 22:5n-3 to DHA was relatively unchanged. In addition, the expression and activity of both cyclooxygenase-2 and lipoxygenase-5 was markedly increased in these cells. Taken together, these findings are consistent with the conclusion that the diminished LA and increased AA in cystic fibrosis result from increased metabolism of LA, while the observed decrease in DHA is at least partly due to decreased elongation and desaturation beyond EPA.

Hormone-sensitive lipase modulates adipose metabolism through PPARγ,

Abstract: Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) is rate limiting for diacylglycerol and cholesteryl ester hydrolysis in adipose tissue and essential for complete hormone-stimulated lipolysis. Gene expression profiling in HSL−/− mice suggests that HSL is important for modulating adipogenesis and adipose metabolism. To test whether HSL is required for the supply of intrinsic ligands for PPARγ for normal adipose differentiation, HSL−/− and wild-type (WT) littermates were fed normal chow (NC) and high-fat (HF) diets supplemented with or without rosiglitazone (200mg/kg) for 16weeks. Results show that supplementing rosiglitazone to an NC diet completely normalized the decreased body weight and adipose depots in HSL−/− mice. Additionally, rosiglitazone resulted in similar serum glucose, total cholesterol, FFA, and adiponectin values in WT and HSL−/− mice. Furthermore, rosiglitazone normalized the expression of genes involved in adipocyte differentiation, markers of adipocyte differentiation, and enzymes involved in triacylglycerol synthesis and metabolism, and cholesteryl ester homeostasis, in HSL−/− mice. Supplementing rosiglitazone to an HF diet resulted in improved glucose tolerance in both WT and HSL−/− animals and also partial normalization in HSL−/− mice of abnormal WAT gene expression, serum chemistries, organ and body weight changes. In vitro studies showed that adipocytes from WT animals can provide ligands for activation of PPARγ and that activation is further boosted following lipolytic stimulation, whereas adipocytes from HSL−/− mice displayed attenuated activation of PPARγ, with no change following lipolytic stimulation. These results suggest that one of the mechanisms by which HSL modulates adipose metabolism is by providing intrinsic ligands or pro-ligands for PPARγ.

Dietary n-6 PUFA deprivation downregulates arachidonate but upregulates docosahexaenoate metabolizing enzymes in rat brain,

Abstract: Background
Dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) deprivation increases expression of arachidonic acid (AA 20:4n-6)-selective cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) IVA and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in rat brain, while decreasing expression of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA 22:6n-3)-selective calcium-independent iPLA2 VIA. Assuming that these enzyme changes represent brain homeostatic responses to deprivation, we hypothesized that dietary n-6 PUFA deprivation would produce changes in the opposite directions.
Methods
Brain expression of PUFA-metabolizing enzymes and their transcription factors was quantified in male rats fed an n-6 PUFA adequate or deficient diet for 15weeks post-weaning.
Results
The deficient compared with adequate diet increased brain mRNA, protein and activity of iPLA2 VIA and 15-lipoxygenase (LOX), but decreased cPLA2 IVA and COX-2 expression. The brain protein level of the iPLA2 transcription factor SREBP-1 was elevated, while protein levels were decreased for AP-2α and NF-κB p65, cPLA2 and COX-2 transcription factors, respectively.
Conclusions
With dietary n-6 PUFA deprivation, rat brain PUFA metabolizing enzymes and some of their transcription factors change in a way that would homeostatically dampen reductions in brain n-6 PUFA concentrations and metabolism, while n-3 PUFA metabolizing enzyme expression is increased. The changes correspond to reported in vitro enzyme selectivities for AA compared with DHA.

Abstract: Owing to its high fat content, the classical Western diet has a range of adverse effects on the heart, including enhanced inflammation, hypertrophy, and contractile dysfunction. Proinflammatory factors secreted by cardiac cells, which are under the transcriptional control of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), may contribute to heart failure and dilated cardiomyopathy. The underlying mechanisms are complex, since they are linked to systemic metabolic abnormalities and changes in cardiomyocyte phenotype. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are transcription factors that regulate metabolism and are capable of limiting myocardial inflammation and hypertrophy via inhibition of NF-κB. Since PPARβ/δ is the most prevalent PPAR isoform in the heart, we analyzed the effects of the PPARβ/δ agonist GW501516 on inflammatory parameters. A high-fat diet induced the expression of tumor necrosis factor-α, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and interleukin-6, and enhanced the activity of NF-κB in the heart of mice. GW501516 abrogated this enhanced proinflammatory profile. Similar results were obtained when human cardiac AC16 cells exposed to palmitate were coincubated with GW501516. PPARβ/δ activation by GW501516 enhanced the physical interaction between PPARβ/δ and p65, which suggests that this mechanism may also interfere NF-κB transactivation capacity in the heart. GW501516-induced PPARβ/δ activation can attenuate the inflammatory response induced in human cardiac AC16 cells exposed to the saturated fatty acid palmitate and in mice fed a high-fat diet. This is relevant, especially taking into account that PPARβ/δ has been postulated as a potential target in the treatment of obesity and the insulin resistance state.

Abstract: This paper demonstrates for the first time transformation of a series of 17-oxo steroidal substrates (epiandrosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone, androstenedione) by the most frequently used whole cell biocatalyst, Beauveria bassiana, to 11α-hydroxy-17a-oxa-d-homo-androst-17-one products, in the following sequence of reactions: 11α-hydroxylation and subsequent Baeyer–Villiger oxidation to a ring-D lactone. 11α-Hydroxyprogesterone, the product of the first stage of the progesterone metabolism, was further converted along two routes: hydroxylation to 6β,11α-dihydroxyprogesterone or 17β-acetyl chain degradation leading to 11α-hydroxytestosterone, the main metabolite of the substrate. Part of 11α-hydroxytestosterone underwent a rare reduction to 11α-hydroxy-5β-dihydrotestosterone. The experiments have demonstrated that the Baeyer–Villiger monooxygenase produced by the strain catalyzes solely oxidation of C-20 or C-17 ketones with 11α-hydroxyl group. 17-Oxo steroids, beside the 11α-hydroxylation and Baeyer–Villiger oxidation, also underwent reduction to 17β-alcohols; activity of 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD) has significant impact on the amount of the formed ring-D δ-lactone.

Abstract: Metabolic syndrome characterized by insulin resistance and obesity is accompanied by severe lipid metabolism perturbations and chronic low-grade inflammation. However, many unresolved questions remained regarding the regulation that underlie dyslipidemia, particularly the regulation of the metabolic cascade (synthesis and release) leading to eicosanoid precursors release. This study was undertaken to investigate the regulation of desaturases/elongases and phospholipases A2 during the establishment of metabolic syndrome. Our results showed that delta-6 desaturase as well as elongase-6 expressions were upregulated in 3-month-old Zucker fatty rats as compared to lean littermates, independently of SREBP-1c activation. We also demonstrated for the first time an increase of liver group VII phospholipase A2 gene expression in the obese animals together with a strong specific inhibition of type IVA and VIA phospholipases A2. These results suggest that the regulation of unsaturated fatty acids biosynthesis and signalling cascade could contribute to the development of liver lipid dysregulation related to metabolic syndrome and may be considered as new potential targets in such pathological conditions.

Abstract: Background: The ability of chronic valproate (VPA) to reduce arachidonic acid (AA) turnover in brain phospholipids of unanesthetized rats has been ascribed to its inhibition of acyl-CoA synthetase (Acsl)-mediated activation of AA to AA-CoA. Our aim was to identify a rat Acsl isoenzyme that could be inhibited by VPA in vitro. Methods: Rat Acsl3-, Acsl6v1- and Acsl6v2-, and Acsl4-flag proteins were expressed in E. coli, and the ability of VPA to inhibit their activation of long-chain fatty acids to acyl-CoA was estimated using Michaelis–Menten kinetics. Results: VPA uncompetitively inhibited Acsl4-mediated conversion of AA and of docosahexaenoic (DHA) but not of palmitic acid to acyl-CoA, but did not affect AA conversion by Acsl3, Acsl6v1 or Acsl6v2. Acsl4-mediated conversion of AA to AA-CoA showed substrate inhibition and had a 10-times higher catalytic efficiency than did conversion of DHA to DHA-CoA. Butyrate, octanoate, or lithium did not inhibit AA activation by Acsl4. Conclusions: VPA's ability to inhibit Acsl4 activation of AA and of DHA to their respective acyl-CoAs, when related to the higher catalytic efficiency of AA than DHA conversion, may account for VPA's selective reduction of AA turnover in rat brain phospholipids, and contribute to VPA's efficacy against bipolar disorder.

Abstract: Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is secreted from adipose tissue and is considered to be a risk factor for both atherosclerosis and insulin resistance. Here we report for the first time that PAI-1 expression is enhanced by oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OxLDL) and its lipid component lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) in mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In fully differentiated 3T3-L1 cells, OxLDL treatment increased the mRNA expression and protein secretion of PAI-1 in a dose- and time-dependent manner, whereas native LDL had no effect. The addition of an anti-CD36 antibody suppressed OxLDL-stimulated PAI-1 expression by 50%, suggesting that adipose-derived CD36 contributes to roughly half of the PAI-1 expression stimulated by OxLDL. In addition, pharmacological experiments showed that the OxLDL-stimulated enhancement in PAI-1 expression was mediated through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. Furthermore, LPC, a major lipid component of OxLDL, was responsible for the enhanced expression of PAI-1 as phospholipase A2-treated acetyl LDL, which generates LPC, strongly stimulated PAI-1 expression, whereas acetyl LDL itself had no such activity. These data demonstrate that the uptake of OxLDL and, in particular, its lipid component LPC into adipocytes triggers aberrant ROS-mediated PAI-1 expression, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome.

Abstract: The LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations are determined by the activity of a complex network of reactions in several organs. Physiologically-based kinetic (PBK) computational models can be used to describe these different reactions in an integrated, quantitative manner. A PBK model to predict plasma cholesterol levels in the mouse was developed, validated, and analyzed. Kinetic parameters required for defining the model were obtained using data from published experiments. To construct the model, a set of appropriate submodels was selected from a set of 65,536 submodels differing in the kinetic expressions of the reactions. A submodel was considered appropriate if it had the ability to correctly predict an increased or decreased plasma cholesterol level for a training set of 5 knockout mouse strains. The model thus defined consisted of 8 appropriate submodels and was validated using data from an independent set of 9 knockout mouse strains. The model prediction is the average prediction of 8 appropriate submodels. Remarkably, these submodels had in common that the rate of cholesterol transport from the liver to HDL was not dependent on hepatic cholesterol concentrations. The model appeared able to accurately predict in a quantitative way the plasma cholesterol concentrations of all 14 knockout strains considered, including the frequently used Ldlr−/− and Apoe−/− mouse strains. The model presented is a useful tool to predict the effect of knocking out genes that act in important steps in cholesterol metabolism on total plasma cholesterol, HDL-C and LDL-C in the mouse.

Abstract: The influence of cationic phosphorus-containing dendrimers generation 3 and 4 on model DMPC or DPPC lipid membranes was studied. Measurements of fluorescence anisotropy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were applied to assess changes in lipid bilayer parameters, including fluidity, anisotropy, and phase-transition temperature. Interaction with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions of the bilayer was followed by these methods. Dendrimers of both generations influence lipid bilayers by decreasing membrane fluidity. The results suggest that dendrimers can interact both with the hydrophobic part and the polar head-group region of the phospholipid bilayer. Higher generation dendrimers interact more strongly with model membranes, and the concentration, as well as the generation, is of similar importance.

Abstract: Cyclic phosphatidic acid (cPA) is a naturally occurring phospholipid mediator, which has a quite unique cyclic phosphate ring at sn-2 and sn-3 positions of the glycerol backbone. We have designed and chemically synthesized several metabolically stabilized derivatives of cPA. 2-Carba-cPA (2ccPA) is one of the synthesized compounds in which the phosphate oxygen was replaced with a methylene group at the sn-2 position, and it showed much more potent biological activities than natural cPA. Here, we developed a new method of 2ccPA enantiomeric synthesis. And we examined the effects of 2ccPA enantiomers on autotaxin (ATX) activity, cancer cell invasion and nociceptive reflex. As well as racemic-2ccPA, both enantiomers showed inhibitory effects on ATX activity, cancer cell invasion and nociceptive reflex. As their effects were not significantly different from each other, the chirality of 2ccPA may not be critical for these biological functions of 2ccPA.

Abstract: Manganese lipoxygenase (MnLOX) oxidizes (11R)-hydroperoxylinolenic acid (11R-HpOTrE) to a peroxyl radical. Our aim was to compare the enzymatic oxidation of 11R-HpOTrE and octadecenoic acids with LOO―H and allylic C―H bond dissociation enthalpies of ~88 and ~87kcal/mol. Mn(III)LOX oxidized (11Z)-, (12Z)-, and (13Z)-18:1 to hydroperoxides with R configuration, but this occurred at insignificant rates (<1%) compared to 11R-HpOTrE. We next examined whether transitional metals could mimic this oxidation. Ce4+ and Mn3+ transformed 11R-HpOTrE to hydroperoxides at C-9 and C-13 via oxidation to a peroxyl radical at C-11, whereas Fe3+ was a poor catalyst. Our results suggest that MnLOX oxidizes bis-allylic hydroperoxides to peroxyl radicals in analogy with Ce4+ and Mn3+. The enzymatic oxidation likely occurs by proton-coupled electron transfer of the electron from the hydroperoxide anion to Mn(III) and H+ to the catalytic base, Mn(III)OH−. Hydroperoxides abolish the kinetic lag times of MnLOX and FeLOX by oxidation of their metal centers, but 11R-HpOTrE was isomerized by MnLOX to (13R)-hydroperoxy-(9Z,11E,15Z)-octadecatrienoic acid (13R-HpOTrE) with a kinetic lag time. This lag time could be explained by two competing transformations, dehydration of 11R-HpOTrE to 11-ketolinolenic acid and oxidation of 11R-HpOTrE to peroxyl radical; the reaction rate then increases as 13R-HpOTrE oxidizes MnLOX with subsequent formation of two epoxyalcohols. We conclude that oxidation of octadecenoic acids and bis-allylic hydroperoxides occurs by different mechanisms, which likely reflect the nature of the hydrogen bonds, steric factors, and the redox potential of the Mn(III) center.

Abstract: The fact that Mycobacterium tuberculosis mobilizes lipid bodies (LB) located in the cytosol during infection process has been proposed for decades. However, the mechanisms and dynamics of mobilization of these lipid droplets within mycobacteria are still not completely characterized. Evidence in favour of this characterization was obtained here using a combined fluorescent microscopy and computational image processing approach. The decrease in lipid storage levels observed under nutrient depletion conditions was correlated with a significant increase in the size of the bacteria. LB fragmentation/condensation cycles were monitored in real time. The exact contribution of lipases in this process was confirmed using the lipase inhibitor tetrahydrolipstatin, which was found to prevent LB degradation and to limit the bacterial cell growth. The method presented here provides a powerful tool for monitoring in vivo lipolysis in mycobacteria and for obtaining new insights on the growth of cells and their entry into the dormant or reactivation phase. It should be particularly useful for studying the effects of chemical inhibitors and activators on cells as well as investigating other metabolic pathways.

Abstract: Apolipoprotein M (apoM) is present predominantly in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in human plasma, thus possibly involved in the regulation of HDL metabolism and the process of atherosclerosis. Although estrogen replacement therapy increases serum levels of apoAI and HDL, it does not seem to reduce the cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal women. Therefore, we investigated the effects of estrogen on apoM expression in vitro and in vivo. HepG2 cells were incubated with different concentrations of estrogen with or without the estrogen receptor antagonist, fulvestrant, and apoM expression in the cells was determined. Hepatic apoM expression and serum levels of apoM were also determined in normal and in ovariectomized rats treated with either placebo or estradiol benzoate, using sham operated rats as controls. Estrogen significantly increased mRNA levels of apoM and apoAI in HepG2 cell cultures in a dose- and time-dependent manner; the upregulation of both apolipoproteins was fully abolished by addition of estrogen receptor antagonist. In normal rats, estrogen treatment led to an increase in plasma lipid levels including HDL cholesterol, a marked upregulation of apoM mRNA and a significant increase in serum levels of apoM. The same pattern of regulation was found in ovariectomized rats treated with estrogen. Thus, estrogen upregulates apoM expression both in vivo and in vitro by mechanism(s) involving the estrogen receptor.

Abstract: As the principal component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), apolipoprotein (apo) A-I plays essential roles in lipid transport and metabolism. Because of its intrinsic conformational plasticity and flexibility, the molecular details of the tertiary structure of lipid-free apoA-I have not been fully elucidated. Previously, we demonstrated that the stability of the N-terminal helix bundle structure is modulated by proline substitution at the most hydrophobic region (residues around Y18) in the N-terminal domain. Here we examine the effect of proline substitution at S55 located in another relatively hydrophobic region compared to most of the helix bundle domain to elucidate the influences on the helix bundle structure and lipid interaction. Fluorescence measurements revealed that the S55P mutation had a modest effect on the stability of the bundle structure, indicating that residues around S55 are not pivotally involved in the helix bundle formation, in contrast to the insertion of proline at position 18. Although truncation of the C-terminal domain (Δ190–243) diminishes the lipid binding of apoA-I molecule, the mutation S55P in addition to the C-terminal truncation (S55P/Δ190–243) restored the lipid binding, suggesting that the S55P mutation causes a partial unfolding of the helix bundle to facilitate lipid binding. Furthermore, additional proline substitution at Y18 (Y18P/S55P/Δ190–243), which leads to a drastic unfolding of the helix bundle structure, yielded a greater lipid binding ability. Thus, proline substitutions in the N-terminal domain of apoA-I that destabilized the helix bundle promoted lipid solubilization. These results suggest that not only the hydrophobic C-terminal helical domain but also the stability of the N-terminal helix bundle in apoA-I are important modulators of the spontaneous solubilization of membrane lipids by apoA-I, a process that leads to the generation of nascent HDL particles.

Abstract: Type II interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R2) is a non-signaling decoy receptor that negatively regulates the activity of interleukin-1 (IL-1), a pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in atherogenesis. In this article we assessed the relevance of IL-1R2 in atherosclerosis by studying its expression in monocytes from hyperlipidemic patients, in THP-1 macrophages exposed to lipoproteins and in human atherosclerotic lesions. Our results showed that the mRNA and protein expression of IL-1R2 was reduced in monocytes from patients with familial combined hyperlipidemia (−30%, p<0.05). THP-1 macrophages incubated with increasing concentrations of acetylated low density (ac-LDL) and very low density (VLDL) lipoproteins also exhibit a decrease in IL-1R2 mRNA and protein levels. Pre-incubation with agents that block intracellular accumulation of lipids prevents the decrease in IL-1R2 mRNA caused by lipoproteins. Lipoproteins also prevented the increase in IL-1R1 and IL-1R2 caused by a 4-h stimulation with LPS and reduced protein expression of total and phosphorylated IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-1. Finally, IL-1R2 expression in human atherosclerotic vessels was markedly lower than in non-atherosclerotic arteries (−80%, p<0.0005). Overall, our results suggest that under atherogenic conditions, there is a decrease in IL-1R2 expression in monocytes/macrophages and in the vascular wall that may facilitate IL-1 signaling.

Mouse serum paraoxonase-1 lactonase activity is specific for medium-chain length fatty acid lactones,

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that paraoxonase-1 (PON1), complexed with high-density lipoproteins, is the major lactonase in the circulation. Using 5-hydroxy eicosatetraenoate δ-lactone (5-HETEL) as the substrate, we observed lactonase activity in serum from Pon1−/− mice. However, 6–12 carbon fatty acid γ- and δ-lactones were not hydrolyzed in serum from Pon1−/− mice. Serum from both wild-type and Pon1−/− mice contained a lactonase activity towards 5-HETEL and 3-oxo-dodecanoyl-homoserine lactone that was resistant to inactivation by EDTA. This lactonase activity was sensitive to the serine esterase inhibitor phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride and co-eluted with carboxylesterase activity by size-exclusion chromatography. Analysis of serum from the Es1e mouse strain, which has a deficiency in the carboxylesterase, ES-1, proved that this activity was due to ES-1. PON1 activity predominated at early time points (30s), whereas both PON1 and ES-1 contributed equally at later time points (15min). When both PON1 and ES-1 were inhibited, 5-HETEL was stable in mouse serum. Thus, while long-chain fatty acid lactones are substrates for PON1, they can be hydrolyzed by ES-1 at neutral pH. In contrast, medium-chain length fatty acid lactones are stable in mouse serum in the absence of PON1, suggesting that PON1 plays a specific role in the metabolism of these compounds.

Phospholipase-D activity and inflammatory response induced by brown spider dermonecrotic toxin: Endothelial cell membrane phospholipids as targets for toxicity,

Abstract: Brown spider dermonecrotic toxins (phospholipases-D) are the most well-characterized biochemical constituents of Loxosceles spp. venom. Recombinant forms are capable of reproducing most cutaneous and systemic manifestations such as dermonecrotic lesions, hematological disorders, and renal failure. There is currently no direct confirmation for a relationship between dermonecrosis and inflammation induced by dermonecrotic toxins and their enzymatic activity. We modified a toxin isoform by site-directed mutagenesis to determine if phospholipase-D activity is directly related to these biological effects. The mutated toxin contains an alanine substitution for a histidine residue at position 12 (in the conserved catalytic domain of Loxosceles intermedia Recombinant Dermonecrotic Toxin — LiRecDT1). LiRecDT1H12A sphingomyelinase activity was drastically reduced, despite the fact that circular dichroism analysis demonstrated similar spectra for both toxin isoforms, confirming that the mutation did not change general secondary structures of the molecule or its stability. Antisera against whole venom and LiRecDT1 showed cross-reactivity to both recombinant toxins by ELISA and immunoblotting. Dermonecrosis was abolished by the mutation, and rabbit skin revealed a decreased inflammatory response to LiRecDT1H12A compared to LiRecDT1. Residual phospholipase activity was observed with increasing concentrations of LiRecDT1H12A by dermonecrosis and fluorometric measurement in vitro. Lipid arrays showed that the mutated toxin has an affinity for the same lipids LiRecDT1, and both toxins were detected on RAEC cell surfaces. Data from in vitro choline release and HPTLC analyses of LiRecDT1-treated purified phospholipids and RAEC membrane detergent-extracts corroborate with the morphological changes. These data suggest a phospholipase-D dependent mechanism of toxicity, which has no substrate specificity and thus utilizes a broad range of bioactive lipids.

Abstract: The mitochondrial electron transport chain is a source of oxygen superoxide anion (O2-) that is dismutated to H2O2. Although low levels of ROS are physiologically synthesized during respiration, their increase contributes to cell injury. Therefore, an efficient machinery for H2O2 disposal is essential in mitochondria. In this study, the ability of brain mitochondria to acquire cardiolipin (CL), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and phosphatidylserine (PS) in vitro through a fusion process was exploited to investigate lipid effects on ROS. MTT assay, oxygen consumption, and respiratory ratio indicated that the acquired phospholipids did not alter mitochondrial respiration and O2− production from succinate. However, in CL-enriched mitochondria, H2O2 levels where 27% and 47% of control in the absence and in the presence of antimycin A, respectively, suggesting an increase in H2O2 elimination. Concomitantly, cytochrome c (cyt c) was released outside mitochondria. Since free oxidized cyt c acquired peroxidase activity towards H2O2 upon interaction with CL in vitro, a contribution of cyt c to H2O2 disposal in mitochondria through CL conferred peroxidase activity is plausible. In this model, the accompanying CL peroxidation should weaken cyt c-CL interactions, favouring the detachment and release of the protein. Neither cyt c peroxidase activity was elicited by PS in vitro, nor cyt c release was observed in PS-enriched mitochondria, although H2O2 levels were significantly decreased, suggesting a cyt c-independent role of PS in ROS metabolism in mitochondria.

Abstract: Human plasma platelet activating factor-acetylhydrolase (HpPAF-AH) is a calcium-independent phospholipase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of ester bond at the sn-2 position of phospholipid substrates. The enzyme belongs to group VIIA of the phospholipase A2 superfamily and is associated with the lipids. Circulating form of HpPAF-AH resides on the lipoprotein particles and acts on a wide variety of substrates, including oxidized phospholipids. In this study we have characterized the effect of lipid composition of the membrane vesicles on the function of purified HpPAF-AH. Lipid composition of the vesicles was varied by incorporating varying amounts of cholesterol in the matrix phospholipids, POPC and DPPC, and its effect on the membrane binding, membrane penetration and the activity of the enzyme was determined. Physicochemical properties of the phospholipid vesicles were characterized by using different fluorescent probes. For the first time our results show that (a) membrane binding of HpPAF-AH increases the activity of enzyme (interfacial activation) and (b) lipid composition of membrane vesicles, by changing the physicochemical properties, differentially modulates the binding, partial membrane penetration and the activity of the enzyme.

Abstract: Fenofibrate, a drug in the fibrate class of amphiphathic carboxylic acids, has multiple blood lipid modifying actions, which are beneficial to the prevention of atherosclerosis. One of its benefits is in lowering fasting and postprandial blood triglyceride (TG) concentrations. The goal of this study was to determine whether the hypotriglyceridemic actions of fenofibrate in the postprandial state include alterations in TG and fatty acid metabolism in the small intestine. We found that the hypotriglyceridemic actions of fenofibrate in the postprandial state of high-fat (HF) fed mice include a decrease in supply of TG for secretion by the small intestine. A decreased supply of TG for secretion was due in part to the decreased dietary fat absorption and increased intestinal fatty acid oxidation in fenofibrate compared to vehicle treated HF fed mice. These results suggest that the effects of fenofibrate on the small intestine play a critical role in the hypotriglyceridemic effects of fenofibrate.

Abstract: Although the conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) have several isomer-specific biological effects including anti-carcinogenic and anti-adipogenic effects, their mechanisms of action remain unclear. To determine their potential effects on membrane structure and function, we studied the incorporation profiles of four CLA isomers (trans-10 cis-12 (A), trans-9 trans-11 (B), cis-9 trans-11 (C), and cis-9 cis-11 (D)) in CHO and HepG2 cells. All four isomers were incorporated into cellular lipids as efficiently as linoleic acid (LA), with the majority of the incorporated CLA present in membrane rafts. Of the four isomers, only CLA-A increased the cholesterol content of the raft fraction. Over 50% of the incorporated CLAs were recovered in phosphatidylcholine of CHO cells, but in HepG2 the neutral lipids contained the majority of CLA. The desaturation index (18:1/18:0 and 16:1/16:0) was reduced by CLA-A, but increased by CLA-B, the effects being apparent mostly in raft lipids. The Δ9 desaturase activity was inhibited by CLAs A and C. Unlike LA, which was mostly found in the sn-2 position of phospholipids, most CLAs were also incorporated significantly into the sn-1 position in both cell types. These studies show that the incorporation profiles of CLA isomers differ significantly from that of LA, and this could lead to alterations in membrane function, especially in the raft-associated proteins.

Abstract: Secretion of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines by macrophages is a contributory factor in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. In this study, the effects of chylomicron remnants (CMR), the lipoproteins which transport dietary fat in the blood, on the production of pro-inflammatory chemokine and cytokine secretion by macrophages was investigated using CMR-like particles (CRLPs) together with THP-1 macrophages or primary human macrophages (HMDM). Incubation of CRLPs or oxidized CRLPs (oxCRLPs) with HMDM or THP-1 macrophages for up to 24h led to a marked decrease in the secretion of the pro-inflammatory chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β (−50–90%), but these effects were reduced or abolished when CRLPs protected from oxidation by incorporation of the antioxidant drug, probucol, (pCRLPs) were used. In macrophages transfected with siRNA targeted to the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr), neither CRLPs nor pCRLPs had any significant effect on chemokine/cytokine secretion, but in cells transfected with siRNA targeted to the LDLr-related protein 1 (LRP1) both types of particles inhibited secretion to a similar extent to that observed with CRLPs in mock transfected cells. These findings demonstrate that macrophage pro-inflammatory chemokine/cytokine secretion is down-regulated by CMR, and that these effects are positively related to the lipoprotein oxidative state. Furthermore, uptake via the LDLr is required for the down-regulation, while uptake via LRP1 does not bring about this effect. Thus, the receptor-mediated route of uptake of CMR plays a crucial role in modulating their effects on inflammatory processes in macrophages.

Abstract: Apolipoprotein E (apoE)-containing lipoproteins (LpE) are produced by glial cells in the central nervous system (CNS). When LpE are supplied to distal axons, but not cell bodies, of CNS neurons (retinal ganglion cells) the rate of axonal extension is increased. In this study we have investigated the molecular requirements underlying the stimulatory effect of LpE on axonal extension. We show that enhancement of axonal growth by LpE requires the presence of the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) in neurons since RNA silencing of LRP1 in neurons, or antibodies directed against LRP, suppressed the LpE-induced axonal extension. In contrast, an alternative LRP1 ligand, α2-macroglobulin, failed to stimulate axonal extension, suggesting that LpE do not exert their growth-stimulatory effect solely by activation of a LRP1-mediated signaling pathway. In addition, although apoE3-containing LpE enhanced axonal extension, apoE4-containing LpE did not. Over-expression of ABCG1 in rat cortical glial cells resulted in production of LpE that increased the rate of axonal extension to a greater extent than did expression of an inactive, mutant form of ABGC1. Furthermore, reconstituted lipoprotein particles containing apoE3, phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin, but not cholesterol, stimulated axonal extension, suggesting that sphingomyelin, but not cholesterol, is involved in the stimulatory effect of LpE. These observations demonstrate that LpE and LRP1 promote axonal extension, and suggest that lipids exported to LpE by ABCG1 are important for the enhancement of axonal extension mediated by LpE.

Abstract: Fenofibrate, a PPAR-α agonist, lowers triglycerides (TG) and raises high-density lipoproteins (HDL-C) in humans. While fenofibrate is very effective in lowering TG, it does not raise HDL-C in humans to the same extent as seen in human apoAI transgenic (hAI-Tg) mice. We studied the mechanism of this discordance using the following compounds as tools: cholic acid that down-regulates human apoAI, and fenofibrate, that elevates hapoAI and HDL-C in hAI-Tg mice. We hypothesized that additional sequences, including apoCIII and AIV genes on chromosome 11, not present in the hapoAI transgene may be responsible for the dampened effect of fibrates on HDL-C seen in humans. For this, hAI-Tg mice with 11kb DNA segment and hapoAI–CIII–AIV-Tg mice with 33kb DNA segment harboring apoCIII and AIV genes were employed. These mice were treated with fenofibrate and cholic acid. Fenofibrate increased apoAI and HDL-C levels, and HDL size in the apoAI-Tg mice via up-regulation of the hapoAI mRNA and increased activity and mRNA of PLTP, respectively. Consistent with earlier findings, cholic acid showed similar effects of lowering HDL-C, and elevating LDL-C in hAI-Tg mice as well as in the hAI–CIII–AIV-Tg mice. Fenofibrate decreased TG and increased HDL size in hAI–CIII–AIV-Tg mice as well, but surprisingly, did not elevate serum levels of hapoAI or hepatic AI mRNA, suggesting that additional sequences not present in the hapoAI transgene (11kb) may be partly responsible for the dampened effect on HDL-C seen in hAI–CIII–AIV-Tg mice. Since hAI–CIII–AIV-Tg mouse mimics fenofibrate effects seen in humans, this transgenic mouse could serve as a better predictive model for screening HDL-C raising compounds.

Abstract: The role of sphingolipid metabolic pathway has been recognized in determining cellular fate. Although sphingolipid degradation has been extensively studied, gene expression of human sphingosine 1-phosphate lyase (SPL) catalyzing sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) remains to be determined. Among 5 human lung cancer cell lines examined, SPL protein levels paralleled the respective mRNA and enzyme activities. Between H1155 and H1299 cells used for further experiments, higher cellular S1P was observed in H1155 with higher SPL activity compared with H1299 with low SPL activity. GATA-4 has been reported to affect SPL transcription in Dictyostelium discoideum. GATA-4 was observed in H1155 but not in other cell lines. Overexpression of GATA-4 in H1299 increased SPL expression. However, promoter analysis of human SPL revealed that the most important region was located between −136bp and −88bp from the first exon, where 2 Sp1 sites exist but no GATA site. DNA pull-down assay of H1155 showed increased DNA binding of Sp1 and GATA-4 within this promoter region compared with H1299. Electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, reporter assay using mutated binding motif, and mithramycin A, a specific Sp1 inhibitor, suggest the major role of Sp1 in SPL transcription and no direct binding of GATA-4 with this 5′ promoter region. The collaborative role of GATA-4 was proved by showing coimmunoprecipitation of Sp1 and GATA-4 using GST-Sp1 and overexpressed GATA-4. Thus, high SPL transcription of H1155 cells was regulated by Sp1 and GATA-4/Sp1 complex formation, both of which bind to Sp1 sites of the 5′-SPL promoter.

Abstract: The gene mutated in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) codes for the HsABCD1 protein, also named ALDP, which is a member of the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and required for fatty acid transport across the peroxisomal membrane. Although a defective HsABCD1 results in the accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids in plasma of X-ALD patients, there is still no direct biochemical evidence that HsABCD1 actually transports very long-chain fatty acids. We used the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to study the transport of fatty acids across the peroxisomal membrane. Our earlier work showed that in yeast the uptake of fatty acids into peroxisomes may occur via two routes, either as (1.) free fatty acid or as (2.) acyl-CoA ester. The latter route involves the two peroxisomal half-ABC transporters, Pxa1p and Pxa2p, which form a heterodimeric complex in the peroxisomal membrane. We here report that the phenotype of the pxa1/pxa2Δ yeast mutant, i.e. impaired growth on oleate containing medium and deficient oxidation of oleic acid, cannot only be partially rescued by human ABCD1, but also by human ABCD2 (ALDRP), which indicates that HsABCD1 and HsABCD2 can both function as homodimers. Fatty acid oxidation studies in the pxa1/pxa2Δ mutant transformed with either HsABCD1 or HsABCD2 revealed clear differences suggesting that HsABCD1 and HsABCD2 have distinct substrate specificities. Indeed, full rescue of beta-oxidation activity in cells expressing human ABCD2 was observed with C22:0 and different unsaturated very long-chain fatty acids including C24:6 and especially C22:6 whereas in cells expressing HsABCD1 rescue of beta-oxidation activity was best with C24:0 and C26:0 as substrates.

Abstract: Fatty liver is commonly detected in obesity and has been identified as a risk factor for the progression of hepatic fibrosis in a wide range of liver diseases. Transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) and activin A, both members of the TGFβ superfamiliy, are central regulators in liver fibrosis and regeneration, and the effect of hepatocyte lipid accumulation on the release of these proteins was studied. Primary human hepatocytes (PHH) were incubated with palmitic acid or oleic acid to increase lipid storage. Whereas activin A and its natural inhibitor follistatin were not affected, TGFβ was 2-fold increased. The hepatoprotective adipokine adiponectin dose-dependently induced activin A while lowering follistatin but did not alter TGFβ. Activin A was markedly reduced in hepatocyte cell lines compared to PHH and was not induced upon adiponectin incubation demonstrating significant differences of primary and transformed cells. In free fatty acid (FFA)-incubated PHH adiponectin-mediated induction of activin A was impaired. Inhibition of TGFβ receptors ALK4/5 and blockage of SMAD3 phosphorylation rescued activin A synthesis in FFA and in TGFβ incubated cells suggesting that FFA inhibit adiponectin activity by inducing TGFβ. To evaluate whether serum levels of activin A and its antagonist are altered in patients with hepatic steatosis, both proteins were measured in the serum of patients with sonographically diagnosed fatty liver and age- and BMI-matched controls. Systemic adiponectin was significantly reduced in patients with fatty liver but activin A and follistatin were not altered. In summary the current data demonstrate that lipid accumulation in hepatocytes induces TGFβ which impairs adiponectin bioactivity, and thereby may contribute to liver injury.

Abstract: Amyloid fibrillogenesis is an important pathological feature of a group of degenerative human diseases. The 129-residue enzyme hen egg-white lysozyme has been shown to form fibrils in vitro at pH 2.0 and 55°C. In this research, using various spectroscopic techniques, light scattering, and transmission electron microscopy, we first examined the influence of short-chain phospholipids on the amyloid fibrillogenesis and the structural changes derived from hen lysozyme in vitro. Both model short-chain phospholipids were observed to mitigate the fibrillogenesis of hen lysozyme. Also, urea-induced unfolding results suggested that the susceptibility of hen lysozyme to conformational changes elicited by the denaturant was observed to decrease upon addition of short-chain phospholipids. Moreover, our molecular dynamics simulations results demonstrated that the observed inhibitory action of short-chain phosoholipids against hen lysozyme fibrillogenesis might be attributable to the interference of β-strand extension by the binding of phospholipids to lysozyme's β-sheet-rich region. We believe that the outcome from this study may contribute to a better understanding the molecular factors affecting amyloid fibrillogenesis and the molecular mechanism(s) of the interactions between phospholipids/lipids and amyloid-forming proteins.

Abstract: Alveolar epithelial type II cells (AT II) in which lung surfactant synthesis and secretion take place, are subjected to low magnitude stretch during normal breathing. The aim of the study was to explore the effect of mild stretch on phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activation, an enzyme known to be involved in surfactant secretion. In A549 cells (a model of AT II cells), we showed, using a fluorometric assay, that stretch triggers an increase of total PLA2 activity. Western blot experiments revealed that the cytosolic isoform cPLA2 is rapidly phosphorylated under stretch, in addition to a modest increase in cPLA2 mRNA levels. Treatment of A549 cells with selective inhibitors of the MEK/ERK pathway significantly attenuated the stretch-induced cPLA2 phosphorylation. A strong interaction of cPLA2 and pERK enzymes was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation. We also found that inhibition of PI3K pathway attenuated cPLA2 activation after stretch, without affecting pERK levels. Our results suggest that low magnitude stretch can induce cPLA2 phosphorylation through the MEK/ERK and PI3K–Akt pathways, independently.

Abstract: Sphingolipids comprise bioactive molecules which are known to play important roles both as intracellular and extracellular signalling molecules. Here we used a previously developed hydrophilic interaction chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS/MS) method to profile plasma sphingolipids. Method validation showed sufficient precision and sensitivity for application in large clinical studies. Sample stability testing demonstrated that immediate plasma separation is important to achieve reliable results. Analysis of plasma from 25 healthy blood donors revealed a comprehensive overview of free sphingoid base, sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC), hexosylceramide (HexCer), lactosylceramide (LacCer), and ceramide-1-phosphate (Cer1P) species level. Besides the major sphingoid base sphingosine (d18:1), we found d16:1 and d18:2 species in most of these lipid classes. Interestingly, pronounced differences were detected in the species profiles of HexCer and LacCer. Additionally, sphingolipids were quantified in lipoprotein fractions prepared by fast performance liquid chromatography (FPLC). HexCer and LacCer showed similar distributions with about 50% in LDL, 40% in HDL and less than 10% in the VLDL fraction. More than 90% of sphingoid base phosphates were found in HDL and albumin containing fractions. In summary, HILIC-MS/MS provides a valuable tool to profile minor sphingolipid species in plasma and in lipoprotein fractions. Comparing profiles from tissues or blood cells, these species profiles may help to address the origin of plasma sphingolipids.

CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase α (CCTα) and lamins alter nuclear membrane structure without affecting phosphatidylcholine synthesis,

Abstract: CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase α (CCTα) is a nuclear enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the CDP–choline pathway for phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis. Lipid activation of CCTα results in its translocation to the nuclear envelope and expansion of an intranuclear membrane network termed the nucleoplasmic reticulum (NR) by a mechanism involving membrane deformation. Nuclear lamins are also required for stability and proliferation of the NR, but whether this unique structure, or the nuclear lamina in general, is required for PC synthesis is not known. To examine this relationship, the nuclear lamina was depleted by RNAi or disrupted by expression of the Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) mutant lamin A (progerin), and the effect on CCTα and choline metabolism was analyzed. siRNA-mediated silencing of lamin A/C or lamin B1 in CHO cells to diminish the NR had no effect on PC synthesis, while double knockdown non-specifically inhibited the pathway. Confirming this minor role in PC synthesis, only 10% of transiently overexpressed choline/ethanolamine phosphotransferase was detected in the NR. In CHO cells, CCTα was nucleoplasmic and co-localized with GFP-progerin in nuclear folds and invaginations; however, HGPS fibroblasts displayed an abnormal distribution of CCTα in the cytoplasm and nuclear envelope that was accompanied by a 2-fold reduction in PC synthesis. In spite of its altered localization, choline-labeling experiments showed that CCT activity was unaffected, and inhibition of PC synthesis was traced to reduced activity of a hemicholinium-sensitive choline transporter. We conclude that CCTα and lamins specifically cooperate to form the NR, but the overall structure of the nuclear envelope has a minimal impact on CCT activity and PC synthesis.

Eicosapentaenoic acid ablates valproate-induced liver oxidative stress and cellular derangement without altering its clearance rate: Dynamic synergy and therapeutic utility,

Abstract: The omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is a superb nature's medicine, with still unfolding health benefits. Because hepatotoxicity is a prominent adverse drug reaction, we currently attempted a new approach in which EPA was challenged to both alleviate hepatotoxicity and provide synergy with anticonvulsant effects of valproate (VPA). Besides, we verified whether EPA may kinetically modulate the clearance rate of VPA. VPA (500mg/kg p.o., for 2weeks) caused rat hepatotoxicity that was manifested as notable (2- to 4-fold) rise in serum liver enzymes (GGT, ALT, and ALP), increased hepatic levels of lipid peroxides and TNF-α (3- and 7-fold) and activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO, 4-fold), lowering of serum albumin (42%), and depletion of liver reduced glutathione (GSH, 36%). Furthermore, histopathologic examination revealed hepatocellular degeneration, focal pericentral necrosis, infiltration of inflammatory cells, and steatosis. Joint treatment with EPA (300mg/kg) blunted the oxidative stress, TNF-α levels and MPO activity, while enhanced levels of serum albumin and hepatic GSH. EPA also ameliorated most of the hepatocellular anomalies evoked by VPA. Additionally, in a mouse PTZ convulsion model, EPA markedly augmented the anticonvulsant effects of VPA far beyond their single responses. On the other hand, pharmacokinetic analyses revealed that joint EPA administration had no effect on serum VPA concentrations. Collectively, results demonstrate for the first time that the ω-3 FA (EPA) markedly alleviated VPA-induced hepatotoxicity, oxidative stress, and inflammation, while enhanced its anticonvulsant effects without altering its clearance. Therapeutically, these protective and synergy profiles for EPA foster a more safe and efficacious drug combination regimen than VPA.

Abstract: Gemfibrozil and fenofibrate, two of the fibrates most used in clinical practice, raise HDL cholesterol (HDLc) and are thought to reduce the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. These drugs act as PPARα agonists and upregulate the expression of genes crucial in reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). In the present study, we determined the effects of these two fibrates on RCT from macrophages to feces in vivo in human apoA-I transgenic (hApoA-ITg) mice. [3H]cholesterol-labeled mouse macrophages were injected intraperitoneally into hApoA-ITg mice treated with intragastric doses of fenofibrate, gemfibrozil or a vehicle solution for 17days, and radioactivity was determined in plasma, liver and feces. Fenofibrate, but not gemfibrozil, enhanced [3H]cholesterol flux to plasma and feces of female hApoA-ITg mice. Fenofibrate significantly increased plasma HDLc, HDL phospholipids, hApoA-I levels and phospholipid transfer protein activity, whereas these parameters were not altered by gemfibrozil treatment. Unlike gemfibrozil, fenofibrate also induced the generation of larger HDL particles, which were more enriched in cholesteryl esters, together with higher potential to generate preβ-HDL formation and caused a significant increase in [3H]cholesterol efflux to plasma. Our findings demonstrate that fenofibrate promotes RCT from macrophages to feces in vivo and, thus, highlight a differential action of this fibrate on HDL.

Abstract: The isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway provides the cell with a variety of compounds which are involved in multiple cellular processes. Inhibition of this pathway with statins and bisphosphonates is widely applied in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and metabolic bone disease, respectively. In addition, since isoprenylation of proteins is an important therapeutic target in cancer research there is interest in interfering with isoprenoid biosynthesis, for which new inhibitors to block farnesylation and geranylgeranylation of small GTPases are being developed. We recently developed a sensitive method using UPLC–MS/MS that allows the direct detection and quantification of all intermediates of the mevalonate pathway from MVA to GGPP which can be used to verify the specificity of inhibitors of the isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway. We here investigated the specificity of several inhibitors of the isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway in HepG2 cells, fibroblasts and lymphoblasts. The nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates pamidronate and zoledronate specifically inhibit farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase indicated by the accumulation of IPP/DMAPP. However, zaragozic acid A, a squalene synthase inhibitor, causes an increase of MVA in addition to the expected increase of FPP. Analysis of isoprenoid intermediate profiles after incubation with 6-fluoromevalonate showed a very nonspecific result with an increase in MVA, MVAP, MVAPP and IPP/DMAPP. These results show that inhibitors of a particular enzyme of the isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway can have additional effects on other enzymes of the pathway either direct or indirect through accumulation of isoprenoid intermediates. Our method can be used to test new inhibitors and their effect on overall isoprenoid biosynthesis.
