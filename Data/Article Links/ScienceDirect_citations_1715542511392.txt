Abstract: CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) thin films were fabricated via a bar-coating process, which is appropriate for large-scale and mass production. By using the bar-coating process, the plane orientation [100] of MAPbI3 was vertically aligned in the thin film on the substrate. Blending NH4Cl to the precursor solution before the bar-coating, the film quality markedly changed depending on the amount of NH4Cl, resulting in the suppression of the grain boundary and the improvement of the surface morphology. Thus, the highly (100)-oriented and uniform thin film of MAPbI3 with the large grains could be obtained. Typical inverted-type solar cells were fabricated using such an excellent MAPbI3 thin film, and the high device performance was demonstrated.

Abstract: Covalent organic framework is a designable and versatile platform for preparation of various functional materials including conventional gas adsorption and separation materials, catalysis matrix, and photoelectric materials, etc. The covalent organic framework with redox building block and conjugated molecular structure can be viewed as a conjugated polymer with ordered porous structure. In this paper, we synthesized a Schiff base type conjugated organic framework (COF) by a solvothermal method in a common Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The reversible reaction of dynamic imine bonds in solvothermal process induces the morphology transform of COF from nanoparticle to nanofiber. Besides of its structure, morphology, nanofiber-formation mechanism and electrochemical properties, the electrochromic properties of COF were investigated for the first time. Owing to the redox building block of triphenylamine, the COF possesses reversibly electrochromic behavior caused by reversibly redox reaction and band gap change of triphenylamine unit. Under step potentials between −2.5 V and 2.5 V, the COF can switch between bright yellow color and brown color. The stability test shows that the device can reversibly switch with stable contrast after slight decay at the initiated cycles. In consideration of abundant options of building units with redox feature, the COF based electrochromic materials with rich color and novel properties can be expected.

Abstract: There has been a growing interest in the application of solar-blind ultraviolet (UV) in fields including astronomy, solar energy, as well as space physics. However, efficient detection of UV in this region remains difficult for most Si-based detectors. The use of a spectral down-converter that converts solar-blind UV into visible emission that is detectable by Si-based devices has been regarded as a simple but cost-efficient strategy. Here, Eu3+-doped AlO(OH) nanoparticles, fabricated by a hydrothermal synthesis method, are demonstrated as spectral converters that converts broadband UV (from 200 to 400 nm) to visible emissions by Eu3+. In this work, the morphology and crystal phase of the Eu3+-doped AlO(OH) nanoparticles were carefully controlled to enable efficient down-conversion luminescence from Eu3+-doped AlO(OH) nanoparticles under the excitation by solar-blind UV light. A photodetector device was constructed by incorporating the Eu3+-doped AlO(OH) nanoparticles into a transparent organic/inorganic composite thin film (AlO(OH): Eu3+-PMMA) that is coated onto a Si-based photosensitive resistance. An efficient photo-voltage response was observed by using an oscilloscope under broadband solar-blind UV irradiation from 200 nm to 400 nm. The results reveal a prospective strategy for the design of detectors operating in the solar-blind UV region.

Abstract: The solution-processable three-dimensional honeycomb-like poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (H-PEDOT) nanostructure networks were fabricated by hard template method for the first time. The morphology, structure and electrochromic performance of the H-PEDOT nanostructures were characterized. Compared with pure PEDOT film, the H-PEDOT nanostructured film shows improved electrochromic properties, including larger optical contrast, shorter response time (0.8 s for bleaching and 0.9 s for coloring), higher coloration efficiency. The improvement of electrochromic performance is due to the highly porous honeycomb-like morphology, which could shorten ion diffusion length and provide more active sites for charge-transfer reactions. In addition, the H-PEDOT nanostructured film was assembled into patterned all-solid-state electrochromic devices. These patterned electrochromic devices show obvious color variation and fast switching speed. The patterned electrochromic displays exhibit promising applications in energy-efficient displays, e-books and e-cards.

Abstract: In order to couple more light in absorber layer of a silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell, higher optical transparency of the front layer is desirable. In that respect we investigated indium tin oxide (ITO) as a front surface field (FSF) layer in a rear emitter SHJ solar cell. We used numerical simulation starting from an experimentally obtained real solar cell. In the experimental cell the n-type nanocrystalline silicon (n-ncSi:H) was used as the FSF, where the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the reference cell was 21.84%. Our investigation shows that if 20 nm thick ITO is used as the FSF, the PCE of the device can be 25.67%, while with an 80 nm thick ITO as FSF, the PCE can be 23.8%. This improvement in the device efficiency primarily comes with the increase in current density in the solar cell due to an increased intensity of light in the absorber layer.

Abstract: The present study combines the advantages of chemical exfoliation and elemental doping to have enhanced surface area, better charge carrier separation and extended light absorption in N3−/Nb4+ co-doped nanosheets, which were employed for the first time to study their O2 evolution response. The Dion-Jacobson phase, KCa2NaNb4O13 perovskite was calcined under NH3 environment at various reaction durations (5 hr, 6 hr, 7 hr) to yield N3−/Nb4+ co-doped layered structures and subsequently exfoliated into ultrathin nanosheets. The N3−/Nb4+ co-doped nanosheets realized superior visible light absorption and bandgap narrowing as determined from UV–visible spectroscopy profiles. The synthesis of bulk materials and ultrathin morphology of exfoliated nanosheets were confirmed through XRD, SEM and AFM. The chemical states of the elements were examined by XPS measurements. The optimized N3−/Nb4+ co-doped CNNO--6hr nanosheets demonstrated excellent O2 evolution of 903 μmol g-1 after 4 h compared to N3−/Nb4+ co-doped CNNO--5hr (510 μmol g-1), N3−/Nb4+ co-doped CNNO--7hr (528 μmol g-1) and non-doped CNNO- nanosheets (381 μmol g-1). Our study paves a way on the feasibility of combining various chemical strategies for advanced photocatalyst design.

Abstract: Currently, photovoltaics have been used on a large scale for commercial and civilian use. Aging short circuit, fire and other reasons will bring great security risks. In this paper, an experimental study of burning and toxic hazards was carried out on a widely used, flammable photovoltaic panel with a sample size of 180 mm*180  mm at atmospheric conditions. Combustion experiments were performed on the early stage fire characteristics bench of State Key Laboratory of Fire Science in China. Several important combustion parameters were investigated by oxygen consumption method under four representative external thermal (15 kW/m2,20 kW/m2,30 kW/m2,40 kW/m2), including Ignition Time, Heat Release Rate, Mass Loss Rate and Total Heat of Combustion. The results of experimental combustion heat were consistent with the thermodynamic calculation data of various organic matter in the sample. Several dangerous toxic gases have been detected, such as sulfur dioxide, hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen cyanide and a small amount of VOCs, of which the concentration of sulfur dioxide is relatively high. In the case of higher external radiant heat, there is a higher risk.

Abstract: Daytime radiative cooling under sunlight can be achieved by embedding micro-sized objects into a binder. In the present article, by carrying out a numerical study of daytime radiative cooling material design using statistical Monte Carlo method, we demonstrate that a silica (SiO2) fiber network can efficiently reflect sunlight via backscattering and efficiently emit infrared thermal radiation. Using a fiber network removes the necessity of the presence of a binder, thus unlike spheres, fibers can be suspended in air. As a consequence, fibers can scatter sunlight efficiently due to the high refractive index difference between air and silica, and efficiently emit thermal radiation due to mitigation of internal reflection losses that arise at the binder air interface. As a result, we show that such a silica fiber network can achieve a net radiative cooling power of 178 W m−2.

Abstract: Background
Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks the third among all common malignancy worldwide. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been demonstrated as implicated in CRC, but the roles of many lncRNAs in CRC remain unclear. Exploration of lncRNA TRMP2-AS and its nearby gene in CRC progress was the focus of current study.
Methods
The expression of TRPM2-AS and its nearby mRNA TRPM2 was measured by using RT-qPCR. The protein levels of TRPM2 and TAF15 were determined using western blot. Cell proliferation was detected by using CCK-8, colony formation and EdU assays. The interaction between TAF15 and TRPM2-AS or TRPM2 was evaluated by RNA pull-down and RIP assays. The TRPM2 mRNA stability was probed using the transcriptional inhibitor Actinomycin D.
Results
TRPM2-AS was significantly upregulated in CRC cells. Knock-down of TRPM2-AS inhibited CRC cell proliferation. Mechanically, TRPM2-AS directly interacted with RNA-binding protein (RBP) TAF15 and thus maintained the mRNA stability of TRPM2. TRPM2 was a prerequisite for TRPM2-AS to exert its promoting function in CRC cell proliferation.
Conclusion
This research demonstrated that TRPM2-AS facilitated proliferation of CRC cells by enhancing TAF15-mediated mRNA stability of TRPM2, unmasking the role of TRPM2-AS in CRC.

Abstract: Sb2S3 thin-film solar cells have recently gained attention due to their low cost, low toxicity, and simple fabrication. However, there is still plenty of room to improve their performance. It is known that efficient carrier transport is essential for high performance Sb2S3 solar cells, which, unfortunately, is difficult to characterize by conventional testing methods. Therefore, the carrier transport process in Sb2S3 solar cells was studied here using a theoretical simulation. The results show that high solar performances can be achieved with a wide parameter window for selecting the electron transport layer as well as the hole transport layer, viz., with a conduction band minimum of the electron transport layer (−4.4 eV < CBM < −3.2 eV), and a valence band maximum of the hole transport layer (−5.2 eV > VBM > −6.4 eV). Here the interfacial potential barrier become negligible and as a consequence electrons and holes cross at ease, which guarantee the good device performance. Indeed, a Sb2S3 solar cell with a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) can be obtained by ensuring that the carrier transport and collection are unimpeded in the device, i.e., the Sb2S3-based single junction solar cells shows high efficiency of 19.53%. Furthermore, we found that optimized Sb2S3 solar cells are particularly suitable for use as the top cell of tandem structure solar cells. Thus, a Sb2S3/Sb2Se3 double junction solar cell structure was proposed. With a 0.5 μm thick Sb2S3 absorber, double junction solar cells could achieve a theoretical efficiency as high as 26.64%. Our results based on the rotational design of bandgap alignment provide a general guide rule for selecting the optimal electron transport layer as well as the hole transport layer to boost the power conversion efficiency for Sb2S3 solar cells up to its theoretical limit.

Abstract: Inverted perovskite solar cells based on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) have drawn great attention due to their potential for foldable photovoltaic applications. Modification of the interface of PEDOT:PSS and perovskite layer is one of the approaches for improving the efficiency and stability. Here, we introduce a triphenylamine-based small molecule, N,N′-Bis-(1-naphthalenyl)-N,N′-bis-phenyl-(1,1′-biphenyl)-4,4′-diamine (NPB), into the device as the multifunctional buffer layer. It is noted that the NPB buffer layer can obviously reduce the pinholes and defects of perovskite film, and adjust the energy level mismatch between perovskite and PEDOT:PSS layer. Moreover, the carrier recombination of NPB-modified device is restricted due to the reduced defects in perovskite layer and at PEDOT:PSS/perovskite interface. As a result, the device power conversion efficiency is improved from 15.4% to 18.4%. The flexible devices are further fabricated with the best efficiency of 14.4% without hysteresis. Most importantly, due to the superior moisture and UV-light resistance of NPB, the modified device exhibits excellent long-term stability under ambient atmosphere and UV-light soaking.

Abstract: Recent findings have demonstrated the aberrant DNA methylation of the Nrf2-Keap1 genes in human cancers; however, the epigenetic control of this pathway in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is unknown. Resveratrol can modify epigenetic mechanisms. Our objectives in this study were to explore the correlation between promoter methylation of the Nrf2-Keap1 genes and NAFLD, and that investigate the effect of resveratrol on the epigenetic regulation Nrf2-Keap1 in vitro and in vivo models of NAFLD. Resveratrol attenuated high fat-diet (HFD)-induced methylation of the Nrf2 promoter in the liver of mice, and this effect was correlated with reduction in triglyceride level and decrease in the expression of lipogenesis-related genes such as FAS and SREBP-1c. In addition, treatment of HepG2 cells with high glucose (HG) enhanced methylation level of the Nrf2 promoter, whereas resveratrol reversed this effect. Treatment of the cells with resveratrol or 5-aza, a demethylating agent, could prevent HG-induced reactive oxygen species production and expression of Nrf2-controlled antioxidant genes. Moreover, resveratrol or 5-aza could significantly attenuate HG-induced triglyceride accumulation in HepG2 cells. These findings indicate that resveratrol attenuates NAFLD through the epigenetic modification the Nrf2 signaling.

Abstract: Background
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in regulation of gene expression and are involved in pathogenesis of different diseases including cancer. Recent studies suggested the lncRNA Colon cancer associated transcript-1 (CCAT1) to act as putative oncogene. In this study, to elucidate the role of this lncRNA in endometrial cancer, we examined its expression in normal endometrium and type 1 endometrial cancer and knocked down its expression in endometrial cancer cell lines followed by transcriptome and pathway analyses.
Methods
CCAT1 expression was examined in 100 tissue samples of normal endometrium and type 1 endometrial cancer tissues by means of RT-qPCR. Knockdown of CCAT1 expression in HEC-1B and RL95/2 endometrial cancer cells was performed by siRNA transfection. Affymetrix GeneChip arrays were used to elucidate the effect of both lncRNAs on the transcriptome of these cell lines.
Results
Median CCAT1 expression was found to be 9.3-fold higher in endometrial cancer when compared to normal endometrium (p < 0.05). In contrast to premenopausal endometrium and G1, G2 and G3 graded endometrial cancer, CCAT1 expression was nearly absent in postmenopausal tissue. Knockdown of CCAT1 by transient siRNA transfection significantly reduced proliferation of HEC-1B cancer cells in vitro by 35.5 % 6 days after transfection and notably reduced their colony formation ability. Affymetrix microarray and Ingenuity pathway analyses revealed a set of up- or down-regulated genes in transfected ERα-negative HEC-1B cells forming a network controlled by the key regulators TNF and TP53, including genes known to be involved in growth control, providing putative molecular mechanisms underlying the observed growth inhibition of HEC-1B cells. In contrast, CCAT1 knockdown in ERα-positive RL95/2 cells did not significantly affect proliferation, but resulted in down-regulation of a network of ERα target genes.
Conclusions
Given that the lncRNA CCAT1 was found to be overexpressed in endometrial cancer, affected the growth of HEC-1B cells and the expression of growth regulatory genes, our data suggest CCAT1 to exert oncogenic functions in endometrial cancer and encourage further studies to examine to what extent this lncRNA might be a potential therapy target in this cancer entity.

Abstract: To improve the use efficiency and broaden the application fields of PCMs in solar thermal energy storage, the poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) based polyurethane (PU) /wood powder (WP)/graphene oxide (GO) composite shape-stabilized phase change materials (SSPCMs) with high thermal conductivity were successfully designed and prepared by using PEG as the phase change working substance, WP and GO nanosheets as the supporting matrix, and the GO nanosheets as the thermally conductive filler simultaneously. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoemission spectrometer (XPS) reveal that the GO nanosheets were successful deposited on the WP surface via the simple impregnation process. With the increasing content of WP and GO, the thermal conductivity of PU/WP@GO SSPCMs was improved significantly. Meanwhile, the PU/WP@GO SSPCMs not only have excellent thermal properties, including good thermal storage properties, well thermal reliability and reusability and good thermal stability, but also exhibit reliable light-thermal conversion performance. Thus, the obtained novel PU/WP@GO SSPCMs with high thermal conductivity can improve the use efficiency of PCMs as solar light absorber and display a high potential application in the field of solar thermal energy storage.

Abstract: The tunnel oxide passivated contact solar cells (TOPCon) on n-type Cz Si wafers instead of passivated emitter and rear solar cells are currently migrated to mainstream production, with ongoing improvements in recent years. In this study, we investigated and characterized one recent batch of TOPCon cells fabricated on 156.75 × 156.75 × 0.18mm3 wafers with fully screen-printed technology by an industrial-type process. TOPCon cells with an efficiency as high as 22.43%, a Voc value as high as 689.4 mV, and a fill factor as high as 81.35% were obtained. The P dopant diffusion in the poly Si layer as well as the thickness of the SiOx layer were optimized in order to obtain good electrical contact between screen-printed Ag and Si. The thickness of the SiOx layer should be over 1.5 nm, which is beneficial for obtaining a good passivation for the cells. The surface P dopant concentration in the polycrystalline Si was higher than 1 × 1020 atom/cm3, resulted in a low series resistance and a high fill factor. The characterization and simulation results show that both metal shading loss and rear surface recombination were dominant among all of the losses. Application to solar cells with a Voc of 697 mV and a fill factor of 82.45% could lead to an independently confirmed cell efficiency of over 23% for n-type cells with poly Si the herein developed passivated rear contacts, and the front metal contacts by addressing the issue of reducing metal recombination and implementing a selective emitter.

Abstract: Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) has received considerable attention as the promising absorber for thin-film solar cells. For traditional selenization process, the issues of Sn-loss, lower S/(S + Se) ratio, and unsuitable back contact interface extensively exist in CZTSSe solar cells. In present work, SnSe and SnS powder is introduced during selenization process, respectively. The effects of SnSe and SnS powder on CZTSSe films and the Mo/CZTSSe interface have been comprehensively studied. We discover that SnS not only can provide the Sn-contained vapor in selenization process but also offer S-vapor. Due to the presence of Sn-contained vapor, the number of voids in the CZTSSe absorber and Mo/CZTSSe interface decreases remarkably and the Sn-loss is effectively suppressed. The thickness of Mo(S,Se)2 layer is significantly reduced, and the S/(S + Se) ratio in CZTSSe bulk obviously increases owing to the presence of S-vapor. As a consequence, the open-circuit voltage and fill factor of the solar cell significantly increase and the CZTSSe solar cell with efficiency of 10.07% (total area) is successfully fabricated.

Abstract: G-protein-signaling modulator 2 (GPSM2) belongs to a protein family that regulates activation of G proteins and plays an important role in mitotic spindle orientation. However, the role of GPSM2 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is still unclear. In this study, it was found that GPSM2 correlates with clinicopathological features and patient’s prognosis in LUAD. Knocking down GPSM2 promoted LUAD cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, it was demonstrated that GPSM2 knockdown accelerates cell proliferation via the EGFR pathway. These results confirmed that GPSM2 played an important role in LUAD. Moreover, GPSM2, as an independent prognostic factor, may serve as a potential drug target and prognostic biomarker in LUAD.

Abstract: This paper investigates the heat transfer characteristics of a prototype latent heat energy storage (LHES) system with novel metal insert design configuration. The novel thermal energy storage (TES)system consist ofa vertical cylindrical shell, a helical coil and metalinserts (MI) withliquid metal gallium(Ga), designed for LHES capacity of ~13MJ. 25 kg of D-Mannitol(DM) is investigated as a phase change material (PCM) forenergy storage and property tests were conducted on DM. PCM was cycled 1000 times and checked for suitability for long term energy storage applications. Results confirmed that the addition of MI with Ga enhanced the thermal performance of the TES system. Moreover, the vertical orientation of the shell as well as the metal inserts supported natural convection during charging cycles and acted as a nucleation sites during discharging cycles, thereby assuring rapid charging and discharging of the TES system. High thermal conductivity, low specific heat of Ga and its liquid phase atroom temperatures helped Ga act as thermal energy carriers in TES unit. Maximum power output of 0.64 kW was obtained during solidification cycle and efficiency range of 87–89% for MI configuration. The presented novel LHES design can be used with a wide range of PCM and over a different temperature range of applications, mainly for water heating, high temperature industrial waste heat recovery and solar thermal applications.

Abstract: Currently, concentration-induced near-infrared upconversion quenching at highly doped levels of lanthanide ions poses a significant constraint for their practical applications. In this work, the fabricated Tm3+/Yb3+ codoped Na0.5Bi2.5Nb2O9 (NBN) materials with a layered structure exhibited a single-band near-infrared to near-infrared upconversion emission (808 nm emission, 980 nm excitation) with no obvious concentration quenching even with a higher Yb3+ content of 90 mol%, while maintaining excellent thermal stability. Meanwhile, the Tm3+/Yb3+ co-doped NBN materials showed strong visible-light absorption at 400-800 nm under the irradiation with sunlight (AM1.5), and the absorbed light can be released via a thermal stimulus, showing a typical photochromic reaction. The near-infrared upconversion emission intensity was effectively tuned after and before sunlight irradiation. This research provides a new strategy for designing high-efficiency near-infrared upconversion and visible photoresponsive oxides for near-infrared modulation, solar energy conversion, and other multifunctional applications.

Abstract: Hybrid nanofluids have an advanced application prospect in the community of heat transfer fluids and particularly for the direct absorption solar collectors (DASCs). Therefore, stable ethylene glycol-based SiC-MWCNTs nanofluids with mass fractions ranging from 0.01% to 1% were prepared in this study. Combined with the unique properties of these two nanomaterials, the studied hybrid nanofluids displayed excellent stability, optical properties and photothermal conversion properties. The purpose of this paper is to simultaneously achieve the enhanced stability and high solar-thermal conversion efficiency of hybrid nanofluids used for DASC applications. The stability of hybrid nanofluids was confirmed. In addition, the hybrid nanofluids displayed an excellent solar irradiation absorption capacity in both visible and near-infrared regions (200–1100 nm). The fact proved that the hybrid nanofluid was effective working fluid in DASCs, where 0.5 wt% SiC-MWCNTs nanofluids could absorb 99.9% solar energy at only 1 cm path length. In addition, the solar-thermal conversion efficiency of hybrid nanofluids increased with the mass concentration. The maximum value of solar-thermal conversion efficiency was found to be 97.3% on 1 wt% SiC-MWCNTs nanofluid at 10 min, which was 48.6% higher than that of pure EG. The application potentials of SiC-MWCNTs hybrid nanofluids in low-temperature DASCs system were presented.

Abstract: Smart windows with reversible regulation on solar radiation by altering their optical transmittance in response to thermal stimuli have been developed as a promising solution toward reducing energy consumption of buildings. This work presents a new strategy for doping Ag nanorods (NRs) with poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm) hydrogel to achieve atmospheric window full-wavelength thermal management. PNIPAm as basic material was aimed to achieve solar radiation modulation among visible, near infrared (NIR), and middle infrared region. Acrylic was grafted on PNIPAm chains to enhance mechanical strength. While Ag NRs were the major factors that affected solar radiation modulation due to its structural changes driven by PNIPAm phase transition. The hybrid hydrogel showed a relatively high solar modulation ability (ΔTsol) of 59.24% while maintaining luminous transmittance (Tlum) of 61.36% under room temperature. The infrared emissivity kept a little increase from 0.947 to 0.958 during phase transition and caused a 12.7 °C reduction in temperature observed from the water-warming experiment. The innovative combination of Ag NRs and hydrogel indicated that metal nanorods may make positive effects when combining with hydrogels. This kind of new strategy based on atmospheric window full-wavelength thermal management exhibits to be an ideal candidate for applications in smart windows.

Abstract: Thermal storage performance of form-stable phase change materials (PCMs) is often compromised by the heavy use of the supporting materials. Here, lightweight mesoporous carbon fibers (MCFs) with continuous graphitic walls are prepared by carbonization of polyvinylidene fluoride on magnesium oxide fibers for form-stable PCMs. The structure of the MCFs are comprehensively investigated to show their merits for supports of the PCMs. The MCFs are rich in relatively ordered mesopores, which can provide effective loading of paraffin and give high thermal storage capacities per unit weight. The paraffin loadings of the as-obtained MCF-700, MCF-800 and MCF-900 reach 93, 90, and 92 wt% with maintained shape stability, and deliver the thermal storage capacities of 176.54, 183.35, and 177.75 kJ kg−1, respectively. Due to the abundant pore networks and the improved interfacial property from the in-situ fluorine doping, the MCFs-supported PCMs exhibit high running stability and thermal storage efficiency in cycling. More importantly, the penetrating graphitic walls of the MCFs provide effective thermal-conductive pathways from outside to the interior for rapid thermal transfer. The results exhibit that the MCFs with interconnected graphitic walls can be an effective support of form-stable phase change materials for solar harvesting, etc.

Abstract: Water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) play an important role in performance improvement for TiO2 photoanode-based photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, but their promotion effect is greatly restricted by the deep valence band of TiO2 and great challenges to maximize their electrocatalytic water oxidation activity and synergistic interaction with TiO2. Herein, we report direct growth of ultra-small, uniformly dispersed, and highly dense CoOx nanoparticles (NPs) on TiO2 nanowire arrays (NWAs) via polymer-mediated self-assembly, in which the polymer serves simultaneously as a linker, stabilizer, and reductant. The obtained nanohybrid arrays show a photocurrent density of 2.09 mA cm−2 and a photoconversion efficiency of 1.01%, which are 3.17 and 3.37 times, respectively higher than that (0.66 mA cm−2, 0.30%) of pristine TiO2 NWAs, and are among the largest reported for WOC-assembled TiO2 photoanodes. Further, their photocurrent density decreases only by ~11.81% while that of TiO2 NWAs decays by ~54.40% after 6900 s. The remarkable promotion effect of CoOx NPs is ascribed to their high intrinsic catalytic activity, ultra-small size, uniform dispersion, and high density significantly enhancing charge separation and hole injection and accelerating charge transfer and transport. This work not only creates a novel CoOx NPs/TiO2 NWA photoelectrode to significantly promote the PEC water oxidation performance of TiO2 NWAs and provides scientific insights into the enhancement mechanism, but also offers a general strategy for self-assembly of WOCs on various photoelectrodes with complex geometries for PEC water splitting.

Abstract: The degradation-induced polymer photoluminescence and absorbance spectra of two differently stabilized commercial EVA grades are investigated under conditions of exposure to dry heat at 85 °C, 115 °C and 135 °C and moisture of 85% relative humidity at 85 °C. In addition to the photoluminescence signal as described before, new features are identified for both, absorbance and photoluminescence spectra. Most prominently, the formerly suggested initial luminescence signal of the model of degradation-induced polymer photoluminescence is identified at an emission wavelength of about 310 nm. It is shown to exhibit a sequential reaction kinetics and to be related to the absorbance of carbonyl sates at 285 nm. The kinetic parameters of these signals are quantitatively evaluated and discussed in the scope chemical degradation and physical relaxation processes. We demonstrate that additive formulations can be distinguished by means of degradation-induced polymer photoluminescence, enabling its application for the characterization and optimization of polymeric materials.

Abstract: Objective
LncRNA ANRIL (antisense non-coding RNA in the INK4 locus) was highly expressed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients to promote AML pathogenesis. In this study, we aimed to investigate the roles and molecular events of ANRIL associated with AML progression.
Methods
Expression patterns of ANRIL and miR-34a in the bone marrow (BM) samples and cell lines were determined using qRT-PCR. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of cells with ANRIL knockdown or miR-34a overexpression were assessed by CCK-8, EdU staining, flow cytometry and Transwell assays, respectively. The dual-luciferase reporter assay was employed to validate the relationship between miR-34a and Histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1). The binding of E2 F1 (E2 F transcription factor 1) with gene promoter was analyzed by ChIP. Furthermore, the tumorigenicity of AML was determined by xenograft transplantation in nude mice.
Results
ANRIL was up-regulated both in the BM samples from AML patients and cell lines (HL-60 and THP-1), of which expression was negatively correlated with miR-34a expression. ANRIL knockdown inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion but promoted apoptosis of AML cells, while overexpression of miR-34a exerted opposite effects. miR-34a was verified as a downstream gene targeted by ANRIL. Moreover, HDAC1 was a direct target of miR-34a, and HDAC1 overexpression impaired the recruitment of E2 F1 to ASPP2 (apoptosis stimulating proteins of p53) gene promoter. ANRIL knockdown significantly inhibited the tumorigenesis of AML.
Conclusion
ANRIL promotes AML development through HDAC1-mediated epigenetic suppression of ASPP2 via negatively regulating miR-34a, which might serve as a therapeutic target for AML treatment.

Abstract: Utilizing Si4+ ionized states providing two free electrons per atom, ZnO:Si (SZO) thin films have been grown as a superior transparent conducting oxide (TCO) material ideal for Si-based electronic devices. Energetically favoured substitutional doping of Zn2+ by Si3+ and Si4+ states facilitates increase in concentration (ne) and mobility (μ) of the charge carriers. At increased dopant incorporation at the interstitial sites Si2+ and Si1+ states are proportionally contributed which are not electronically active and act as scattering centres for the existing free electrons. Further, the formation of non-conducting SiOx bonds and their segregation at grain boundaries restrict increase in charge carrier concentration and reduce their mobility. The ideal dopant incorporation in ZnO:Si network accommodates ~1.6 ± 0.07 at.% Si. A minimal resistivity, (ρ)min ~7.16 × 10−5 Ωcm corresponding to the highest mobility, (μ)max ~85 V−1cm2s−1 and superior carrier density, (ne)max ~1.0 × 1021 cm−3 signify a highly degenerate semiconductor characteristic of the SZO films with reduced effective mass of electron, m* ~0.15 m0. Significantly high magnitude of Figure-of-Merit (FoM: Φ) ~9.7 × 10−2 Ω−1, even at moderately low growth temperature ~150 °C demonstrates excellent TCO characteristics of SZO films. The n-SZO/p-Si solar cells reveal increased VOC ~312 mV and JSC ~27.9 mA/cm2 via moderate widening in optical band gap and a significant increase in carrier concentration in the SZO component, respectively. The n-SZO/p-Si heterojunction solar cells with a FF ~0.499 and photovoltaic conversion efficiency η ~4.34% has been obtained with improved SZO layer grown by optimized doping via consumption of Si4+ donor states.

Abstract: Though perovskite solar cells (PSC) have reached high efficiency comparable to its counterparts, it is still striving towards finding a strong hold in terms of long-term stability. Several approaches have been made to prevent the degradation of PSC. Here, we present low-temperature ALD deposited Al2O3 as an effective encapsulant for PSC. The encapsulated devices improve with PCE reaching up to 19.4% post 300 cycles of Al2O3 deposition. In-situ QCM and FTIR measurements reveal that trimethylaluminum gets trapped inside the spiro-OMeTAD layer and is available for the subsequent dosage of H2O during nucleation regime. Here we unveil the fact that the ALD grown Al2O3 is not only surface limited, but the material penetrates the spiro-OMeTAD and enhances the hole transport property, improving the overall performance of encapsulated cells. Intermittent measurements indicate that encapsulated cells are stable, retaining 84% of its initial efficiency by the end of 300 days. Subsequently we elucidate that the device measurements under continuous illumination and with different bias conditions and atmosphere show that the ALD grown encapsulation prevents ingress of moisture and oxygen into the cells maintaining their stability.

Abstract: Direct reprogramming of non-neural lineages to functional neurons holds great potential for neural development, neurological disease modeling, and regenerative medicine. Recent work has shown that single transcription factor Ascl1 can directly reprogram fibroblasts into neuronal cells under co-culture system with glial cells. It is confirmed that Ascl1 is the key driver in the reprogramming of induced neuronal cells (iNCs). However, most reprogramming methods use genetic materials and/or potentially mutagenic molecules to generate iNCs. Herein, we used 30Kc19 protein as a novel fusion partner of transcription factor Ascl1 to induce direct reprogramming of fibroblasts to neuronal cells. We demonstrated soluble expression and stability of Ascl1 protein was increased and maintained by co-expression with 30Kc19 protein, respectively. We confirmed that intracellular delivery of the fusion protein resulted in iNC generation. Protein-induced neuronal cells (p-iNCs) expressed neuronal protein markers (MAP2, Tuj1) and transcriptional genes (Ascl1, Brn2, and Myt1l). Protein-based direct reprogramming system eliminates the potential risk associated with the use of genetic materials. This method is anticipated to be useful for safe generation of patient-specific human neuronal cells for future applications in regenerative medicine.

Abstract: A novel method of microcosmic-visualizing was employed in investigating the supercooling stability of a phase change material (PCM). The supercooling behavior of the PCM under circumstances of different surface free energy was studied both dynamically and statically, and a theory analysis of how the surface free energy of the substrate affects the stable supercooling of PCM was carried out. The results showed that, the PCM droplets phase changed after a 20-cm free fall on substrate with larger surface free energy, while remained supercooled on substrate with lower surface free energy. The PCM in PTFE container initiated crystallization at −8.99 °C, withstood over 400% on hours at liquid state compared with the sample in glass container, while a large supercooling degree of over 57 °C was achieved. It indicated that containers made of materials with lower surface free energy could be considerably beneficial in stabilizing supercooling of PCMs, which could give a guide to the practical application on long-term energy storage of PCMs. What is more, the surface free energy theory also works on the air-liquid interface. The oil-covered PCM sample withstood a temperature of 5 °C for 10 months without crystalized in a refrigerator, showing great potential on supercooling stabilization.

Abstract: Effect of Ge/(Ge + Sn) composition ratio of Cu2Sn1-xGexS3 (CTGS) films is examined. The CTGS films are fabricated by sulfurization of the 700-nm-thick Cu–SnS2/Ge stacked precursors on Mo-coated soda-lime glass (SLG) substrates. It is revealed that the thickness of Ge precursor (Ge thickness) from 0 to 420 nm enhances the Ge/(Ge + Sn) composition ratio in the CTGS thin films from 0 to about 0.58, thereby increasing bandgap energy (Eg) from approximately 0.97 (Cu2SnS3: CTS) to 1.23 eV (CTGS), respectively. Not only does Ge precursor act as Ge source to form the CTGS films but also it prevents the formation of undesirable MoS2 secondary phase. In addition, the CTGS solar cells with a structure of SLG/Mo/CTGS/CdS/ZnO/ZnO:Al/Ni/Al are fabricated with the Ge thickness from 0 to 420 nm. It is found that the optimized Ge thickness of 200 nm resulting in the Ge/(Ge + Sn) composition ratio of about 0.32 eliminates the excessive MoS2 secondary phase and increases the Eg, thereby increasing conversation efficiency (η) to 5.6% of the CTGS solar cell, higher than that (3.6%) of the CTS solar cell. However, the η is reduced when the Ge thickness over 200 nm because CTGS quality observed by Urbach energy is deteriorated and the conduction band offset at the CdS/CTGS interface demonstrates the large cliff type heterostructure, thus increasing the open-circuit voltage deficit.

Abstract: A visible-to-infrared broadband flexible electrochromic device based on H2SO4-doped polyaniline films has been constructed for simultaneously variable optical and thermal management. Upon electrochemically manipulating, the demonstrated electrochromic device could change from a wide bandgap semiconductor to an insulator, causing the device to transform from a high thermal emitter with dark green to an optical reflector with bright yellow. High infrared emission changes of 0.4 and 0.3 for the device are observed at the wavelength ranges of 8–14 μm and 2.5–25 μm, respectively, which are higher than most reported electrochromic devices. A promising cycling stability and flexibility of the device are also observed. The thermal imaging results reveal that the device can be electrochemically and reversibly tuned to blend them with their environment. Furthermore, both the theoretical calculation and experimental results demonstrate that the device exhibits different heat transfer rates, facilitating the thermal management of the indoor object. The illustrated capabilities of the device make the electrochromic device highly promising for the optical management in visible-infrared regions and thermoregulation in indoor environment.

Abstract: High-entropy alloys films with the composition of MoNbHfZrTiN and MoNbHfZrTiON are fabricated by a reactive RF magnetron sputtering, which have a good solar spectral selectivity and are used for solar thermal absorption coatings. By changing the flow rate of Ar/N2/O2, the metallic content of each layer of the coatings can be controlled, which forms the MoNbHfZrTiN layer with high metallic content and the MoNbHfZrTiON layer with low metallic content. By tailoring the deposition parameters, a novel Al/MoNbHfZrTiN/MoNbHfZrTiON/SiO2 coating has been successfully deposited on SS substrate for the purpose of shifting the absorption edge to the higher wavelength. The coating exhibits a high absorptance of 0.935 and a low emittance of 0.09. The colors and optical properties of layer-added coatings are studied, and the color coordinates are drawn in the chromaticity diagram. By controlling the thickness of MoNbHfZrTiON and SiO2 layers, the colored Al/MoNbHfZrTiN/MoNbHfZrTiON/SiO2 coatings are fabricated.

However, in front-contact cells which are the current industrial mainstream architecture, the emitter is located on the front textured side and is typically realized by POCl3 diffusion. The interaction of this process with the nano-texture is complex, which makes it challenging to optimise the electrical performance of the phosphorus emitter. This paper studies the impact of in-situ oxidation during emitter formation to the electrical performance of a POCl3 diffused RIE nanotextured emitter surface. Additional corona charge was applied on the ALD SiO2/Al2O3 stack to avoid the limitation on the emitter performance due to non-ideal surface passivation conditions. After saturation with surface charge, the results demonstrate in-situ oxidation to be an effective technique to improve the electrical performance. An emitter recombination factor of 147 fA/cm2 was achieved for a 127 Ω/□ emitter formed on reactive-ion etched sample with surface area enhancement factor and effective slope index of 4.19 and 1.63, respectively. Further paths for improvement are identified, particularly relating to the collection of carriers generated by short wavelength light and how that relates to the shape of the texture used.

Abstract: The development of efficient photovoltaic devices utilizing durable and cost-effective materials such as CZTS and similar ones represents a big challenge. Here, the comparison of thermodynamic calculations and electrochemical experiments reveals detrimental degradation of CZTS regardless of pH values and potentials applied. Cathodic polarization yields to the full decomposition of CZTS, while anodic polarization stabilizes partly CZTS by passivation of its surface with less-active phases. The presence of water, in general, provokes the decomposition of CZTS to various undesired phases which most likely affect the device parameters. The possible mechanism for the degradation of CZTS is proposed considering its electronic structure. Certain similarities on unfavorable processes occurring with analogous materials are expected.

Abstract: Recently, inorganic thermal energy (TES) storage materials to support renewable energy implementation are being developed, and lithium salts have been showing thermal properties suitable for latent storage applications. There are three main technologies to achieve TES: sensible, latent, and thermochemical energy storage. Latent heat storage materials or phase change materials (PCMs) can store large amounts of heat per volume and they can be applied at a certain temperature, depending on the desired application. Lithium compounds for sensible storage have been reviewed in previous publications. Their use in latent heat storage applications is increasing but scarcely documented; while new latent heat storage Li materials appear consistently, the information on them is still dispersed. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to discuss lithium compounds used, proposed or analyzed for latent heat storage (LHS) and their possible applications. Lithium salts thermophysical properties, such as density, melting temperature and latent heat were tabulated as found in literature. Binary salts presented attractive heat of fusion values over 130 kJ kg−1 in a wide range of temperatures. Moreover, the increase of stability of multi-component PCM systems due to the insertion of lithium compounds was confirmed. The technologies to produce lithium are improving and, if the demand increases, prices could decrease in the near future. Therefore, the availability of lithium materials was also analyzed in this study. Finally, potential applications of these thermal storage materials, such as heated underwater diver suits, portable thermal conditioning jackets, solar receiver space, Stirling engines, etc. were assessed.

Abstract: As reported in numerous studies, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) exert significant effect on the regulation of tumor development. LncRNA TMPO antisense RNA 1 (TMPO-AS1) has been confirmed to be implicated in the development of several cancers. However, its clinical significance is still largely unknown in bladder cancer (BCa). In this study, high expression of TMPO-AS1 was revealed in BCa tissues and cell lines, and TMPO-AS1 predicted poor prognosis. Moreover, TMPO-AS1 facilitated cell growth. Additionally, TMPO-AS1 also boosted the migration and invasion of BCa cells. Mechanistically, overexpressed EBF transcription factor 1 (EBF1) in BCa cell was verified to promote the transcription of TMPO-AS1. Later, we found that TMPO-AS1 was a cytoplasmic RNA and could sponge miR-98-5p. Besides, it was validated that EBF1 is a target gene of miR-98-5p and negatively correlated with miR-98-5p in terms of expression level. According to the results of rescue experiments, we observed that EBF1 overexpression restored the repressive effect of TMPO-AS1 silencing on BCa development. Our research is the first to disclose the biological role and molecular mechanism of TMPO-AS1 in BCa, and TMPO-AS1 might be identified as a new therapeutic target for BCa patients.

Abstract: Nanostructured thin films were synthesized using a silica-based sol-gel method. The morphology of the films was tailored by controlling the hydrolysis and crosslinking mechanisms of the tetraethyl orthosilicate precursor. Silica nanoparticle self-assembled structures and linear silica chains were crosslinked and formed monolithic nanostructured films. The self-assembly mechanism was investigated using coarse-grained molecular dynamic simulation. Three nanostructured configurations were synthesized and studied to optimize the surface features of the films and minimize the adhesion of sand particles. Surface microscopy imaging and adhesion force measurements using atomic force microscopy with an attached silica particle on the cantilever tip were performed to correlate the adhesion force and the surface structure. The solar specular reflectance of coated solar mirror samples was measured across the solar spectrum before and after the soiling test of the samples. The mechanical properties of the thin films were evaluated using nanoindentation measurements on coated substrates. The solution-derived thin film coatings can provide anti-soiling protection of solar glass in desert environments and increase the efficiency of photovoltaic and concentrated solar power installations.

Abstract: Radiative cooling technology without any energy input and any pollutants produced has drown more and more attention. However, most of the studies were conducted in the transition season of arid areas. In this work, the radiative cooling performance was theoretically and experimentally explored in cooling season of the humid coastal area. The results indicated that the average deviation between the cooling and transition season in arid areas was about 18.9%, while for humid areas, it reached up to 53.9%. And for a clear daytime sky, the average temperature drop in the transition season was about 6 °C, while that in cooling season was only 2.7 °C. Additionally, the tilt experiment demonstrated that strategy can improve the radiative cooling performance in cooling season of humid areas, but the improvement was significantly lower than that in transition season. Subsequently, the average radiative cooling potential of China was further explored and the results revealed that radiative cooling technology can meet the cooling demand of 85% areas in China. Feasible solutions to improve the poor cooling performance in humid areas were further discussed. And reducing the solar absorption and non-radiative heat exchange were expected to address the challenge. Our work provides insight into radiative cooling performance in cooling season of humid areas.

Abstract: The localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) is considered as one of the effective strategies to broaden the spectral absorption range and improve quantum conversion efficiency or photocatalyst. Because of low-cost and LSPR absorption peaks in the visible-light region, Cu-based plasmonic photocatalysts have attracted concern in recent years. However, the mechanisms of generation, modulation, and application of LSPR effects of Cu nanoparticles are still insufficient. To this regard, by using finite-difference time-domain simulations and density functional theory calculations, the intrinsic mechanism of LSPR in the system of Cu nanosphere loaded onto TiO2 nanosphere has been systematically analyzed. When Cu nanosphere is gradually sinking into TiO2 nanosphere to form core-shell configuration, the LSPR absorption peaks is gradually red-shifting and separated from the interband region of metallic Cu nanosphere. The interfacial electronic states are the root of enhancement and red-shifting of LSPR absorption peaks in Cu/TiO2 nanospheres. What's more, the LSPR effects of different Cu/TiO2 nanosphere configurations are highly susceptible to the dielectric media with high refractive index, the direction of incidence light, and environmental media. The embedding configuration of Cu/TiO2 nanospheres is predicted to present outstanding photocatalytic performance, owing to less affected by the incident direction of light, effectively excited LSPR wavelength and local electric field, and more reaction sites for photo-redox reaction. The findings in the present work provide a convenient and efficient approach to screen plasmonic photocatalysts for efficient solar energy conversion.

Abstract: Nanofluids have an advanced application prospect in the community of heat transfer fluids and particularly for the direct absorption solar collector (DASC). But most of body of available researches gave more attention to the thermal conductivity or rheology. We recently reported on the thermal conductivity and optical properties of the β-cyclodextrin modified carbon nanotubes (CD-CNTs) nanofluids. In this paper, we focused on the specific heat capacity and photo-thermal conversion performance of ethylene glycol-based CD-CNTs nanofluids for DASC system. To this end, a series of CD-CNTs nanofluids with different volume fractions (~0.1 vol%) were prepared. The specific heat capacity decreased with the increase of CD-CNTs loadings and the highest decrement in specific heat capacity was found to be 9.07% for 0.1 vol%. In addition, the temperature had significant effect over specific heat capacity of the studied nanofluids. The volume concentration and irradiation duration time put an effect on the photo-thermal conversion efficiency. In the nanofluid with appropriate concentration, the photothermal conversion performance was improved with the extension of light irradiation time, and the possible mechanism of carbon nanotube agglomeration was qualitatively analyzed. In summary, the promising features could ensure the CD-CNTs nanofluids application prospect to be utilized in practical DASC system.

Abstract: The emergence of the drugs targeting epigenetic alterations has brought an optimistic outlook for cancer patients and probably put an end into the devastating effects of the disease. Given to the prominent involvement of histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes in the formation of neoplastic nature of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), this study was aimed to evaluate the suppressive effect of pan-HDAC inhibitor panobinostat on both NB4 and primary APL patients cells, either in the context of mono- or co-culture with mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Panobinostat effectively reduced the survival of APL cells; however, as compared to NB4, the viability of primary cells was inhibited at higher concentrations. Our results also showed that although HDAC inhibition could merely block the survival signals transduced from MSC, the presence of PI3K inhibitor could robustly reinforce panobinostat cytotoxicity; suggesting that MSC-induced activation of PI3K may attenuate, at least partly, the efficacy of HDAC inhibition in APL cells. In addition, cellular and molecular investigations on NB4 revealed that not only panobinostat induced p21-mediated G1 arrest and ROS-mediated apoptosis, but also exerted a superior cytotoxicity when combined with c-Myc and autophagy inhibitors. Last but not least, we found that panobinostat combined with arsenic trioxide (ATO) prompted a synergistic effect and provided an improved therapeutic value in NB4; proposing that the abrogation of HDAC using panobinostat might be a befitting approach in APL, either as a single agent or in a combined-modal strategy.

Abstract: An array of ZnO/Fe2O3 core-shell nanowires (NW) for the highly efficient absorption of light and carrier collection is developed for use in photoelectrochemical (PEC) water-splitting. The oriented NW architecture favors physical matching, providing a direct electron conduction pathway and reducing the diffusion length of photogenerated holes. This work involves a combination of spectral imaging, spectromicroscopy and in situ x-ray absorption spectroscopy; spectra are obtained under operando conditions. Direct investigation of oriented nanowires using polarization-dependent x-ray spectromicroscopy enables the determination of the relationship between anisotropic electronic orbitals and charge carrier water-splitting efficiency. The results of O K-edge STXM demonstrated that the ZnO/Fe2O3 core-shell NW exhibits strong anisotropy and thus provides higher electron-hole transport efficiency than bare ZnO. In situ XAS revealed that interfacial charge transfer between Fe 3d and Zn 4p states enhances the photoelectrochemical reaction in the ZnO/Fe2O3 core-shell NW. The photogenerated electrons of Fe2O3 are transferred from Fe 3d states to the Zn 4p state under photoelectrochemical conditions.

Abstract: The degradation characteristics of MOCVD grown InGaAsP/InGaAs dual junction solar cells, irradiated by 1 MeV electron, 3 MeV and 10 MeV proton, have been investigated. Main electrical and optical properties of solar cell degraded seriously with the increase of irradiation fluences due to the irradiation induced defects which are acting as non-radiative recombination centers in the active layers of the solar cell. The remaining factor of Pmax is 0.67, 0.53 and 0.51 for 1 MeV electron, 10 MeV proton, and 3 MeV proton irradiation, respectively, when the displacement damage dose (DDD) is 3.16×1010 MeV/g. The degradation of external quantum efficiency (EQE) of each subcell mainly occurred in the long wavelength region, the integrated current density Jsc of InGaAsP and InGaAs subcells degraded more seriously upon 3 MeV and 10 MeV proton irradiation comparing to 1 MeV electron irradiation. The InGaAsP subcell turned out to be the current limiting unit due to the lower Jsc before and post irradiation. By applying equivalent displacement damage dose model, the relative damage coefficient for 3 MeV proton to 10 MeV proton and 1 MeV electron to 10 MeV proton have been calculated.

Abstract: Bifacial perovskite/crystalline silicon (c-Si) tandem photovoltaic (PV) modules that harvest albedo radiation are a promising strategy to further enhance the energy yield (EY) of monofacial perovskite/c-Si tandem PV modules. Given the required current matching in bifacial perovskite/c-Si two-terminal (2T) tandem PV modules, predicting the expected enhancement in EY requires an advanced EY modelling framework. In this study, the architecture, module tilt, perovskite absorber layer thickness, and bandgap of the perovskite top solar cell are optimized for several types of grounds and two locations. Compared to bifacial c-Si single-junction PV modules, the relative enhancement in EY of textured bifacial perovskite/c-Si 2T tandem PV modules is around 24–38% for an exemplary grass ground (mean albedo = 35%). With increasing albedo, the optimum bandgap of the perovskite top solar cell decreases from 1.72 eV (black ground, mean albedo = 0%) to 1.55 eV (snow, mean albedo = 88%). This is attributed to enhanced current generation only in the c-Si bottom solar cell due to albedo radiation, entering the solar cell at the rear side. In addition, minor optical losses due to ground shading are found for modules with a finite mounting height in the range of 1 m. Overall, our study highlights the importance of EY modelling to assess the performance of bifacial perovskite/c-Si tandem PV. It provides direction for the design of bifacial perovskite/c-Si tandem solar cells with regard to the device architecture and the choice of the perovskite material with regard to its bandgap.

Abstract: Document bibliographic coupling analysis was applied to a dataset of 23,953 journal papers in order to provide an overview of topics that were present in the academic literature on organic solar cells (OSCs) and perovskite solar cells (PvSCs) during the period of 2008–2017. Ten yearly networks were constructed by linking documents based on shared references, and clusters of closely connected papers were identified as the representations of topics in OSC and PvSC research. Next, 1,437 document titles were read in order to label the 80 most relevant clusters, together containing 11,352 papers. The resulting cluster labels show that research focused on bulk heterojunction polymer/fullerene solar cells in the beginning of the studied period, that OSC material development topics became more important in the middle of the decade, and that continued efforts to improve power conversion efficiencies spurred the rise of new concepts like PvSCs, fullerene-free OSCs, and ternary OSCs in the later years. While traditional literature reviews are valuable for in-depth reviews of specific topics, bibliometric reviews based on document bibliographic coupling are better suited for broad research synthesis. By leveraging the relationships present within the body of literature, they can objectively present the topic structure of large research domains.

Abstract: Saharan silver ants can maintain their body temperature below ambient air due to unique triangular shaped hairs that enhance solar reflection and thermal emission through a transparent window that lies in the atmosphere. Applying this thermoregulatory prismatic structure to polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), highly emsissive in the 8–13 μm spectrum, we present a geometrically modified polymer-based daytime passive radiative cooler. The selective thermal emitter was fabricated based on the optimized prismatic structure from Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) simulations. The average emissivity within the 8–13 μm spectrum was enhanced to 0.98 by the gradient refractive index effect, while the average solar reflectivity in the visible and near-infrared spectrum was measured to be 0.95. The net radiative cooling power is estimated to reach 144 W/m2, exceeding records of previously reported radiative coolers. Last, in Hong Kong's hot and humid climate, a field test successfully demonstrated cooling by 6.2 °C below the temperature of ambient air corresponding to a net cooling power of 19.7 W/m2 in a non-vacuum setup during the peak daytime with shading. This is the largest temperature reduction observed in a tropical region for daytime passive radiative cooling. Our work presents an alternative method to enhance passive thermal emission and may facilitate its world wide application in eco-friendly space cooling.

Abstract: Although the early diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa) enhances life expectancy with a 5-year survival rate of 100 %, metastasized-PCa is the fundamental reason for death by PCa, hence requires an advanced and target-directed treatment strategy. Metastasis is considered to be initiated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) event in which tumor cells change their epithelial characteristics into mesenchymal form and exacerbates the cancer progression. Herein, we investigated the effect and mechanism of resveratrol function in PCa cell proliferation and migration and reported that TNF-receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6), an unconventional E3 ligase, is a key mediator of resveratrol function to inhibit PCa cell growth and proliferation and targeted for lysosomal degradation by resveratrol. MTT and cell counting demonstrated that resveratrol inhibited the viability and proliferation in DU145 and PC3 cells. Resveratrol (50 μM) mediated the degradation of TRAF6 which in turn facilitated repression of the NF-κB pathway. Also, wound healing and transwell migration assays and level of EMT-related proteins showed that resveratrol used TRAF6, at least in part to inhibit cell migration. Overexpression of TRAF6 augmented EMT in PCa by upregulating the expression of transcription factor SLUG. Moreover, TRAF6 overexpression was closely associated with EMT process through the NF-κB pathway. Our exploration exhibited that resveratrol may inhibit EMT through the TRAF6/NF-κB/SLUG axis. Altogether, this study represents that TRAF6 acts as an intermediary of resveratrol action to suppress PCa cell proliferation and migration, and concerns future attention to obtain as a therapeutic target for the treatment of PCa.

Abstract: Herein, we have synthesized a series of polymer nano-hybrids (polyFe-hHNT-2, polyFe-hHNT-5, and polyFe-hHNT-10) of an electrochromic metallo-supramolecular polymer (polyFe) with a modified tubular hydroxylated halloysite nanoclay (hHNT) by effective electrostatic interaction through ion exchange. The spectroscopic studies exhibit the operative interaction and composite formation between hHNT and polyFe while the structural characterizations through X-ray diffraction reveal the intercalation of polymer chains into rolled hHNT layers. The morphological investigations manifest the significant decrement of the diameter of hHNT tubes after nanocomposite formation by intercalation induced exfoliation of rolled hHNT nanotubes through interaction with polyFe polymer chains in inner and outer surfaces. The incorporated hHNTs enhance the thermal stability and ionic conductivity in the nanocomposite. The composite based electrochromic devices (ECDs) exhibit a fairly stable EC color change from purple to transparent under a controlled potential switching from -2 V to +3 V. The electrochromic switching times are considerably improved by 82% for bleaching (2.95 s → 0.53 s) and 47.2% for coloring (0.72 s → 0.38 s) in polyFe-hHNT-5 composite compare to pristine polyFe based ECD. The chronoamperometric study confirms the charge required to change the color is also significantly decreased in the composites due to swift counter ion diffusion, better ionic conductivity and effective charge neutralization by the anionic sites of hHNTs in composites. Hence, the coloration efficiency is also enhanced in composite ECDs to provide ~117.8% raise of coloration efficiency (263.05 → 572.77 cm2 C-1) compared to pristine polyFe. Therefore, the present work can provide a viable strategy to improve the electrochromic parameters of an electrochromic polymer.

Abstract: It is usually accepted that prion proteins induce apoptosis in nerve cells. However, the mechanisms of PrPSc-neurotoxicity are not completely clear. Calcineurin is a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase. It activates autophagy, and may represent a link between deregulation of Ca2+ homeostasis and neuronal cell death. In this study, the effect of calcineurin activation mediated by human prion protein induced neuronal cell death via AMPK dephosphorylation and autophagy, was investigated. Synthetic peptides of PrP (PrP 106–126) increased calcineurin activity, without changing the levels of this protein phosphatase. Furthermore, these peptides reduced the levels of AMPK phosphorylation at threonine residue 172 and in autophagy activation. Calcineurin inhibitor, FK506, prevented this effect. The data showed that PrP-treated neurons had lower levels of AMPK than control neurons. This decrease in AMPK levels was matched via activation of autophagy. FK506 prevented the changes in AMPK and autophagy levels induced by PrP peptides. Taken together, the data demonstrated that prion peptides triggered an apoptotic cascade via calcineurin activation, which mediated AMPK dephosphorylation and autophagy activation. Therefore, these data suggest that therapeutic strategies targeting calcineurin inhibition might facilitate the management of neurodegenerative disorders including prion disease.

Abstract: Mitochondria are known as dynamic organelles that fuse and divide under the control of certain proteins. These dynamics are important to shape mitochondria, maintain a healthy mitochondrial population, and enable physiological adaptations, to name just a few key processes. We are less aware that mitochondrial membrane lipids and proteins also exhibit dynamics in terms of lateral mobility and translocation. This single molecule dynamics is equally important for the above processes as it enables interaction with other proteins and complexes. Here we discuss some mitochondrial proteins and the role of their specific dynamic spatiotemporal organization for function and adaptation. For example, respiratory proteins are preferentially localized in cristae sheets, ATP synthase at the edges of cristae and compounds of the MICOS complex at cristae junctions. Trajectory patterns show how and whether molecules are restricted in their mobility and how this determines their distribution. The formation of supercomplexes has an influence on this. Recent studies have also shown that the distribution of proteins is not absolutely static. For example, the metabolic state of the cell obviously determines the activity of the mitochondria and finally the organization of the bioenergetic and structure-determining proteins inside. The ATP synthase has both classifications and additionally shows functional interactions with other cristae shaping proteins at cristae junctions. To understand the dynamics of mitochondria we have to consider all scales: from the dynamics of the molecular structure of the proteins to the dynamics of the molecules with respect to their localization and lateral mobility to the dynamics of the organelle structure.

Abstract: By using the sacrificial layer (SL) etching, GaAs substrates are separated from III–V epi substrate//Si substrate junctions that are made by surface activated bonding (SAB) technologies. The post-bonding low-temperature (300-∘C) annealing plays an essential role in achieving a promising (∼90%) bonding yield. The effects of the post-bonding annealing are investigated by hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy and current–voltage measurements of GaAs//Si bonding interfaces. It is found that the concentration of oxygen atoms at interfaces is reduced and the resistance decreases to 1.6–2.1 mΩcm2 by the low-temperature annealing. Aluminum fluoride complexes are not observed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy on the exposed surfaces of separated GaAs substrates. The roughness average of the surfaces is ≈0.25–0.30 nm. The characteristics of double junction cells fabricated on the GaAs//Si junctions prepared by the SL etching are almost the same as those of cells fabricated by dissolving GaAs substrates after bonding. These results indicate that multijunction cells could be fabricated in a process sequence compatible with reuse of GaAs substrates by combining the SL etching and SAB.

Abstract: The Calcium-Looping (CaL) process, based on the reversible carbonation/calcination of CaO, is a promising technology for thermochemical energy storage (TCES) in Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants. However, the major drawback of this technology is the rapid deactivation of CaO due to sintering. In this work, we have synthesized CaO-based, inert oxide-stabilized composites through a space-confined chemical vapor deposition process. Different synthesis parameters such as the inert material (Al2O3, SiO2 or TiO2) used as the stabilizer and the CaO concentration in the sorbent were investigated. Among the three different promoters used to increase the resistance of CaO toward sintering, Al2O3 resulted in the most stable composites. The composite with only 5 mol.% Al showed an excellent CO2 uptake capacity, 0.59 g CO2/g composite, over 50 cycles without any deactivation. Based on the calculation, this composite maintained an energy density of 1.50 GJ/t after 50 cycles, corresponding to 87% of the theoretical maximum. This high stability is attributed to the unique synthetic strategy in which the thermally stable oxide nanoparticles deposited on the surface of CaO crystalline grain and prevented its aggregation and overgrowth.

Abstract: Double-sided, front and rear, tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) of crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells on textured wafer is presented. The double-sided TOPCon structure is composed of (p) poly-Si/SiOx/(n) c-Si/SiOx/(n) poly-Si, where the silicon oxide (SiOx) layer is formed by atomic layer deposition (ALD). With a 0.6 ± 0.1 nm-thick SiOx layer, an 18.8 %-efficiency solar cell is fabricated, where an excellent short circuit current above 39 mA/cm2 is confirmed for a front grid structure. The solar cell performance is improved by optimizing the boron and hydrogen diffusion profiles near the p-side SiOx/c-Si interface.

Abstract: Cation substitution has an important impact on the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) solar cells. Herein, a significant PCE enhancement of flexible indium-doped CZTSSe solar cells has been achieved by partially substituting Sn4+ with In3+. Systematic measurements indicate that In doping in CZTSSe film effectively improves the crystallinity and carrier concentration of the absorber layer. Meanwhile, the treatment reduces interface recombination and band tailing by passivating deep defects and increases the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the solar cells. By physical analysis, the key parameters for the solar cell diode such as A, J0, Rs and Rsh are significantly improved after In-doping, indicating better PN junction quality. Under the optimal In-doping (x = In/(Sn + In) = 9%), the flexible Cu2ZnSn1-xInx(S,Se)4 solar cell has been successfully obtained with the best efficiency of 7.19% and the Voc enhancement of 62 mV due to reduced Voc deficit and band tailing.

Abstract: Rear side application of polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) passivated contacts has demonstrated very high efficiencies for single-junction monocrystalline silicon (mono-Si) solar cells. To further improve the device performance, one possible approach is to apply the passivated contact concept to the front side of the solar cell as well. The front side application requires the use of ultra-thin poly-Si layer in order to suppress parasitic absorption. Suitable ex-situ diffusion process should be developed accordingly without damaging the passivation provided by the very thin interface oxide (iOx). In this work, we prepared symmetric lifetime samples of ultra-thin poly-Si (<30 nm) via low pressure chemical vapour deposition (LPCVD) method. Then we studied and optimised the ex-situ POCl3/BBr3 diffusion doping processes. An excellent passivation quality was demonstrated with a high implied open-circuit voltage (iVoc) of up to 730 mV (on symmetric n+ poly-Si lifetime samples) and 700 mV (on symmetric p+ poly-Si lifetime samples). For possible contact formation, we capped the poly-Si with sputter-deposited ZnO:Al, which shows good opto-electrical properties and firing stability at 650 °C.

Abstract: MicroRNA (miRNA), as tumor suppressor or oncogene, is involved in the regulation of tumor development. However, the role of miRNA in human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is less well understood. In our previous studies, we have successfully established a Chinese hamster oral squamous cell carcinoma animal model and constructed a miRNA differential expression profile, and screened out the abnormal expressed gene (miR-504). The purpose of this study was to investigate the regulatory mechanism of miR-504 in human OSCC cells and to elucidate its new target genes. CCK-8 assay, colony formation assay, transwell migration and invasion assay were used to test the cell proliferation, cell growth, cell migration and cell invasion abilities of the miR-504 mimics group, respectively. Flow cytometry was used to detect the apoptotic ability. In order to verify the direct target of miR-504, we used the dual luciferase reporting system for detection. The expressions of RNA and proteins were detected by qRT-PCR and western blotting. The results of our study showed that miR-504 expression was down-regulated in OSCC animal tissue samples. In human OSCC cell lines, miR-504 over-expression significantly inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion. The dual luciferase reporting system confirmed that CDK6 was a direct target of miR-504 and that miR-504 expression inhibited CDK6 expression. In addition, the over-expression of miR-504 in OSCC cells could significantly inhibit the expression of cell cycle-related proteins (E2F1, Cyclin D1), but the expression of p21 was significantly increased. The results of this study suggest that miR-504 may be a new therapeutic target for OSCC.

Abstract: We report Si/InP core-shell nanowire radial heterojunction array based solar cell. Silicon nanowire (SiNW) arrays were fabricated by room temperature metal assisted chemical etching method on a p-type Si (100) wafer using silver nanoparticles whereas n-InP layer, as a shell, was deposited onto the SiNW arrays by atmospheric pressure metal organic chemical vapor deposition to obtain core-shell radial heterojunctions. A 100 nm transparent conductive oxide layer was deposited onto top of n-InP layer by sputtering. Transmission electron microscope images confirm the formation of Si/InP core-shell radial nanowire heterostructure. From the studies of reflectance spectroscopy, higher absorption of visible photons has been found. Current-voltage measurements on the radial core-shell nanowire heterojunction based solar cell have been taken under dark and an AM 1.5 solar radiation at room temperature. The device is found to provide a conversion efficiency of 4.39% with an open circuit voltage of 0.56 V and a short circuit current density 14.26 mA/cm2 under AM 1.5 solar radiation. The core-shell radial heterojunction solar cell on nanowire arrays shows great improvement of the performance in comparison with conventional nanowire based solar cells. Our study provides new insights into the Si/InP core-shell nanowire based heterojunction which can have potential applications in fabricating nanoscale optoelectronic devices on Si platform.

Abstract: The collecting energy from solar radiation using phase change materials is significant in the field of thermal storage. In the current work, a novel MWCNT-modified hydrate salt/poly (acrylate sodium) copolymer hydrogel (MWCNT-GS/PAAS) form-stable composite PCM was well prepared using mechanical mixing method. The form-stable ability, microstructure, heat storage capacity, thermal stability and thermal-cycling reliability of the prepared MWCNT-GS/PAAS were investigated. The leakage experiment exhibited that the MWCNT-GS/PAAS containing 7 wt% PAAS can maintain original gel-structure without leakage in melting state of hydrate salt. Moreover, scanning electron microscopy was used to demonstrate that the hydrate salt PCM was coated with densified hydrogel film. ATR-FTIR and Raman spectra results indicated that the hydrate salt PCM was encapsulated successfully within the network gel-structure. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) suggested that the MWCNT-GS/PAAS composite possessed good thermal storage capacity, of which the latent heat reached up to 187.2 J/g. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) indicated that the retention ratio of the crystal water in MWCNT-GS/PAAS is as high as 64.8 wt% at the temperature where the Glauber's salt completely dehydrated. The heat transfer performance suggested that the thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of the MWCNT-GS/PAAS composite increased by 141.7% and 167.1% compared with those of the pure GS. Furthermore, being subjected to 500 thermal cycles, the prepared composite maintained favorable thermal and chemical stability. The obtained results indicated MWCNT-GS/PAAS composite was an outstanding candidate used for solar energy storage systems.

Abstract: Passivating contacts are an important technological innovation for crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells that can deliver efficiencies of over 24% in mass production. In this study, we comprehensively analyze n-type bifacial c-Si solar cells with rear side SiOx/phosphorus-doped (n+) poly-Si passivating contacts (monoPoly™ cells) with varying thicknesses (50–250 nm) of the n+ poly-Si layer. The poly-Si layers are deposited by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) and then phosphorus doped ex-situ in a diffusion furnace. The ex-situ doping is carefully optimized for each individual thickness to achieve a step-function-like doping profile. Excellent passivation properties are achieved with the SiOx/n+ poly-Si stack, with a dark saturation current density of only 1 fA/cm2 for 150 nm n+ poly-Si layers. Metallization is realized by screen printing using commercially available fire-through pastes. Very low dark saturation current densities of <50 fA/cm2 are achieved under the metal contacts for n+ poly-Si thicknesses ≥100 nm. Trade-offs in the cells’ current-voltage (I–V) parameters are analyzed as a function of n+ poly-Si thickness and efficiency limiting factors are identified for cells with 50 nm n+ poly-Si layers.

Abstract: Electrospinning of SrNb2O6 nanofibers from a single bimetallic alkoxide precursor [SrNb2(OiPr)12(HOiPr)] and the application of resulting oxide nanofiber meshes as potential photoanode material for solar water splitting is reported. Direct formation of single phase SrNb2O6 nanofibers from the precursor gel was favored by the tailored Sr:Nb ratio (1:2) and preordering of cations through Sr–O(R)-Nb units present in the molecular precursor. X-ray diffraction and photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the chemical composition and formation of SrNb2O6 phase. A minor amount of orthorhombic SrNb6O16 phase was observed, when small excess of alkali metal was present during the precursor synthesis. The optical bandgap of photoelectrodes, produced by doctor blading and spin coating of the nanofibers, revealed bandgap energies between 3.25 and 3.43 eV, owing to different microstructure of the photoelectrodes. The measurement of photoelectrochemical properties in basic conditions showed photocurrent density values at 1.23 eV ranging from 0.06 mA/cm2 to 0.16 mA/cm2. A maximum value of 0.6 mA/cm2 was obtained for spin-coated nanofiber photoelectrodes.

Abstract: Solar selective absorbers based on semiconducting β-FeSi2 and low-emissive Ag layers were prepared on stainless steel substrates, and the thermal durability below 650 °C was evaluated. Agglomeration and vaporization of the Ag layers were prevented by adding Ta and stacking with TaN layers, respectively. The solar absorbing layers, consisting of β-FeSi2, deteriorated at high temperatures, as a result of diffusion of Si from the silicide layers to substrates, which could be suppressed by using TaN/SiO2 layers at the interface between the stainless steel substrates and Ag layers with Ta and Si additives. The thermally stabilized solar selective absorbers achieved an averaged solar-thermal conversion efficiency of 87.0% between 300 and 650 °C. Arrhenius plots based on accelerated heating tests between 750 and 800 °C showed that the thermally stabilized absorbers were able to keep the decline in efficiency to within 1% for over 42 years at 650 °C.

Abstract: Photovoltaic (PV) energy-yield loss due to solar module soiling has become increasingly important as solar module deployment is now at the hundreds of gigawatts scale and continues to grow rapidly. The electrostatic attraction and adhesion force (Fes) of dust particles by the high voltages from solar panels have been reported to be 1 to 2 orders of magnitude stronger than the van der Waals and water capillary forces, which has been corroborated by observing the increase in system voltage-induced soiling rate by setting up an outdoor test. Here, we report another characteristic of Fes on soiling—long-lasting or slow decay after turning off the high voltage applied to solar panels. The Fes decay time varies across a wide time range of 1 to 10 h, depending on two factors: 1) whether the cell, the particle, or both were charged with high voltage before the voltages were turned off; and 2) how the cell was connected to the ground after the voltage was turned off—either connected through the power-supply electronics, directly connected to the ground, or electrically floated. The Fes decay is understood in terms of 1) net electrical charge dissipations in both particle and cell, 2) thermal disordering of dipole polarization in the module glass dielectrics, and 3) charge redistribution by the electrostatic interaction of particle and module glass. This long-lasting Fes for hours can affect the solar panel soiling after sunset, and it can have an even greater effect when combined with water condensation at night.

Abstract: Gallium doped silicon is an industrially viable alternative to boron doped silicon for photovoltaics, and is assumed to be immune from light-induced degradation. We have studied light soaking for >1000 h of industrially fabricated passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC) devices formed from monocrystalline gallium and boron doped substrates, with cell properties monitored using a non-contact photoluminescence imaging proxy method. As-fabricated stabilised boron doped cells did not degrade or underwent a slight improvement, whereas as-fabricated gallium doped cells which had not been intentionally stabilised experienced a slight (~5%) deterioration which then recovered. When PERC devices were subjected to a 200–300 °C dark anneal before light soaking, significant differences in the cell degradation signatures were observed. Degradation characteristic of light and elevated temperature induced degradation (LeTID) was observed for boron and gallium PERC solar cells, with the onset of degradation taking longer, and the severity being less, with gallium. Investigation of stripped gallium PERC devices with room temperature surface passivation revealed bulk lifetime degradation correlates with the cell-level degradation. When the cells were stripped and passivated with aluminium oxide, a complete change in the degradation behaviour was observed, with no degradation occurring in the gallium case and boron-oxygen-like degradation observed for boron. This indicates that dielectric passivation is not suitable for lifetime degradation diagnosis in stripped cells. Gallium retains advantages over boron doping with stabilisation processes not generally required, but manufacturers need to be aware of possible low-temperature lifetime instabilities when developing future fabrication processes, such as for passivated contact structures.

Abstract: One of the fundamental challenges that have prevented practical use of the perovskite solar cell is the current degradation in exposure conditions, causing instability of the power conversion efficiency. We present here a theory for this current degradation in perovskite solar cells. Many researchers attribute this degradation to the vacancies migration in the perovskite layer. But there are two fundamental ambiguities in the theories presented for the ion migration process. First, according to the assumptions of these theories, this vacancy migration to the sides of the perovskite layer should also happen in dark conditions, while this occurs only in exposure conditions. Second, according to the assumptions of these theories, the degraded solar cell should not be recovered in dark conditions, while recovery takes place in dark conditions. The approach we present in this paper provides a good understanding of the processes of degradation and recovery in perovskite solar cells, as well as resolves these ambiguities.

The visible absorption peaks of (BW11Co/Ha)n films are obviously red shifted as compared with those of corresponding Ha solution, which is beneficial for improving photoelectric conversion. As irradiated with white light, the (BW11Co/Ha)n films generated stable, large cathodic photocurrents that increasing with increasing negative applied bias potentials, increasing of electron acceptor concentrations and decreasing electron donor concentrations in the electrolyte solution. The photocurrents were also found to be strongly depending on layer number of the films, and alkyl chain length in the hemicyanine dyes of Ha (a = 3, 6, 10). The maximum photocurrent densities generated by (BW11Co/H3)4, (BW11Co/H6)5, and (BW11Co/H10)4 films were found to be 18.05, 16.6 and 15.8 μA/cm2, respectively. The photocurrent generation performance of (BW11Co/Ha)n films is superior to that of POM-free hemicyanine dye films. POM components can significantly improve the photocurrent generation properties of hemicyanine dyes by efficient electron transference between the ITO electrode and the hemicyanine, and retardation of recombination reaction in photoelectrochemical cells. This study would guide molecular design for more efficient photoelectrocatalytic, and energy conversion and storage devices.

Abstract: In this work, ultra-thin n-type hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon oxide [(nc-SiOx:H (n)] film was used to replace amorphous silicon [a-Si:H (n)] as electron transport layer (ETL) in rear-junction silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell to reduce front parasitic absorption. The contact resistivity between the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) and ultra-thin ETL interface plays an important role on the cell performance. A nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H) contact or seed layer was introduced in the solar cell with ultra-thin nc-SiOx:H and the impact of the nc-Si:H thickness on the cell performance was investigated. To demonstrate scalability, bifacial solar cells with 10 nm ETL were fabricated on the M2 (244 cm2) wafer. The best cell performance is obtained by the solar cell with 5 nm nc-SiOx:H (n) and 5 nm nc-Si:H (n) contact layer and it exhibits open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 738 mV, fill factor (FF) of 80.4%, short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 39.0 mA/cm2 and power conversion efficiency (η) of 23.1% on M2 wafer. Compared to the one with nc-SiOx:H (n), an increase of 3%abs of FF and 0.5%abs of η and lower front contact resistivity is demonstrated for the solar cells with nc-Si:H (n) / nc-SiOx:H (n) double layer, which is caused by the lower energy barrier for electrons, according to the band diagram calculated by the AFORS-HET simulator. A simulation on the solar cell optical and electrical losses was done by the Quokka 3 simulator and shows much lower electrical transport loss and a bit higher front surface transmission loss for the one with double layer than nc-SiOx:H (n) single layer.

Abstract: Upconversion of sub-band-gap photons constitutes a promising way for improving the efficiency of silicon-based solar cells beyond the Shockley-Queisser limit. 1500nm to 980nm upconversion by trivalent erbium ions is well-suited for this purpose, but the small absorption cross section hinders real-world applications. We employ tailored gold nanostructures to vastly improve the upconversion efficiency in erbium-doped TiO2 thin films. The nanostructures are found using topology optimization and parameter optimization and fabricated by electron beam lithography. In qualitative agreement with a theoretical model, the samples show substantial electric-field enhancements inside the upconverting films for excitation at 1500nm for both s- and p-polarization under a wide range of incidence angles and excitation intensities. An unprecedented upconversion enhancement of 913±51 is observed at 1.7Wcm−2. We derive a semi-empirical expression for the photonically enhanced upconversion efficiency, valid for all excitation intensities. This allows us to determine the upconversion properties needed to achieve significant improvements in real-world solar-cell devices through photonic-enhanced upconversion.

Abstract: Molten salt based nanofluids are involved in Thermal Energy Storage (TES) Systems, both as heat transfer fluids and energy storage materials. Rheological and wetting properties play an acute role in the handling and storage of materials and are closely related with pumping and corrosion issues. In this study the effect of nanoparticle addition on the aforementioned properties of molten salt nanofluids is investigated. The solar salt (60% NaNO3 – 40% KNO3), as well as its individual components NaNO3 and KNO3, are mixed with various concentrations of SiO2. The contact angle and viscosity are measured throughout the liquid phase. Addition of a small percentage of nanoparticles, significantly alters the contact angle and viscosity of the nanofluid. In the absence of silica all the molten salts display a linear behavior with respect to temperature. However, in the presence of nanoparticles the solar salt retains an elevated value until 300 °C in the case of the contact angle and 260 °C in the case of the viscosity, after which a steep reduction occurs. With larger concentrations of nanoparticles, this effect is shifted to higher temperatures. Similar behavior, however, is not present in the case of the NaNO3 and KNO3 individually, both of which, with the addition of nanoparticles, retain curve trends similar to their baseline cases. Further investigation, involving differential scanning calorimetry, suggests that nanoparticles delay the liquid/solid phase transition process of the molten salt mixture, which in turn affects the rheological and wetting behavior of the molten mixture.

Abstract: High-quality perovskite films with uniform coverage and large grains are indispensable to enhance the performance of perovskite solar cells with high efficiency and stability. However, solution-processed perovskite films usually possess small grains associated with abundant grain boundaries, which induce high trap state density and then seriously degrade the device performance. In this paper, the volatile Lewis base, thioacetamide (TAA), is employed as an additive to fabricate high-quality methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) films. The average grain size of perovskite films increases continuously with increasing TAA content and reaches a maximum value of 960 nm in the sample with 1.0% TAA. However, the average gain size drops dramatically to the value of samples without TAA when TAA content increases to 2.0%, and then the average gain size keeps nearly unchanged upon further increasing TAA content up to 10%. This unusual grain size variation tendency is attributed to the volatility of additive, and a mechanism is proposed based on various characterizations to illustrate how volatile TAA improves perovskite film crystallization. Furthermore, the device based on the MAPbI3 film with 1.0% TAA shows a superior PCE of 18.9% and improved stability that the device with 1.0% TAA retains 88.9% of its initial performance after aging 816 h in the air with 25–35% relative humidity. The results strongly suggest that the TAA-modified MAPbI3 films as absorber layers can significantly enhance the performance of the perovskite solar cell due to large grains, high crystallization and reduced trap state density of the high quality TAA-modified MAPbI3 films.

Abstract: Na-doped Cu2SnS3 (CTS) solar cells are fabricated and their carrier recombination is examined. The CTS absorbers on Mo-coated soda-lime glass substrates are grown by the sulfurization of NaF/Cu–SnS2 (900 nm) precursors. The NaF thickness is varied from 0 to 100 nm to vary the Na content in the resulting CTS absorbers. It is disclosed that the large grain with the uniformity of the material distribution (Cu, Sn, and S) in the Na-doped CTS absorber is obtained. With optimal Na doping (NaF thickness of 60 nm), the open-circuit voltage deficit (VOC,def) is obviously reduced, whereas short-circuit current density deficit (JSC,def) is not varied much. The reduction of VOC,def is attributable to the decrease in the carrier recombination across the device. The conversion efficiency (η) is consequently increased to approximately 4.7%. However, with severe Na doping (NaF thickness of over 75 nm), the VOC,def is clearly increased owing to the increase in the carrier recombination, thereby reducing the η. This is occurs because the Sn2S3 and Na2S secondary phases near the surface of the CTS film are formed with the severe Na doping. To further increase the η, the JSC,def is reduced through the decrease in CdS buffer thickness. Ultimately, the 5.1%-efficient CTS solar cell is obtained with the Na-doped CTS absorber prepared with the optimal NaF thickness of 60 nm.

Abstract: To meet the challenge that Si wafer based industrial n-type solar cells are more complicated to manufacture as compared to producing p-type Si solar cells, a simplified cell fabrication process to make n-type silicon solar cells has been developed in which boron-doped rear emitter and phosphorus-doped front surface field (FSF) are formed in one high-temperature step. By adding a selective FSF structure the conversion efficiency of the n-type solar cells can be further improved. Our proposal enables the doping concentration of the emitter and the FSF to be adjustable independently without affecting the ohmic contacts on both sides. A champion batch conversion efficiency of 22% was obtained by optimizing the contact ratio of the emitter and thermal drive-in duration.

Abstract: In this study, shape-stabilized composite phase change materials were fabricated by the impregnation method based on dodecanoic acid (DA) as energy storage material and graphene as a supporting matrix. The supporting material was prepared via in-situ filling with Na2CO3 cores from solid sodium acetate and showed large specific surface area, high thermal stability, and large PCM loading ratio (81.1%), favorable pore characteristics and green and economical related to conventional graphene, carbon nanotubes and other 1D and/or 2D-carbon matrixes. The as-prepared composites were investigated by various characterization techniques to evaluate the performance of thermo-chemical and physicochemical properties. The resulted composite demonstrated an enhanced energy storage capacity of 157.6 kJ/kg, which was up to 101.4% higher than that of expected energy storage capacity with the reduced supercooling phenomenon. Due to supporting material that assisted the DA to nucleate heterogeneously. In addition, the composite revealed enhanced photo-thermal conversion about 78% and thermal conductivity up to 159.1% compared to that of pristine PCM with high reliability after 100 times thermal cycling, chemical compatibility and shape stability above the normal melting temperature of pristine DA. This signified that the composite is a promising material for practical applications like building heat preservation, air conditioning, and solar energy storage.

Abstract: The development of phase change materials (PCMs) with high energy density is of great importance for thermal or solar energy storage. Here, we report for the first time the exploitation of fatty amines (FAs) as a new family of organic PCMs with the latent heat in the range of 260–437 kJ kg−1, which is one of the highest values for organic PCMs reported to date. With low supercooling degree (<10 °C) and a phase transition temperature of 25.8–71.6 °C, FAs are particularly suitable for thermal or solar energy storage at ambient conditions. Based on the plentiful chemistry of amino groups of FAs, we also prepared form-stable PCMs composites with enhanced FAs uptake due to the strong electrostatic interaction between amino groups of FAs and –SO3H groups of supporting materials, providing a new and versatile route to the construction of FAs-based PCMs composites for renewable and sustainable energy saving systems.

Abstract: In most previous investigations on VO2 smart windows, a low transition temperature (Tc) and desirable color have not been taken simultaneously, considering that they have not received enough study as yet. Here Ag particles periodic arrays (PPAs) were successfully embedded into monoclinic VO2(M) via self-assembly hexagonal-close-packed polystyrene templates. With the increase of Ag PPAs specific area, the Tc was reduced from 68 to 57.5 °C and the carrier density was increased. The mechanism of Tc reduction of Ag PPAs/VO2 composite films was clearly explained: more free electrons injected into VO2(M) films induces the larger absorbing energy at the nanometal-semiconductor junction. By changing the Ag PPAs specific area, the strong absorption of light in the ~630–730 nm (brown-yellow) band was achieved, thereby diluting the influence of the inherent brown-yellow color of the VO2(M) film. A low Tc and diluted color of the VO2(M) were simultaneously achieved by tuning Ag PPAs specific area, benefiting for the smart window application.

Abstract: Two-dimensional transition-metal carbides/carbonitrides (MXenes) have demonstrated wide application prospect in energy conversion and storage, mostly in the form of electrochemical energy storage. Compared with the conversion between chemical energy and electrical energy, an energy conversion process initiated by solar energy and driven by the physical change of energy materials will be a sustainable and environmentally friendly strategy. Therefore, a high-performance MXene aerogel-based phase change material for solar energy conversion and thermal energy storage is constructed. MXene nanosheets with an extinction coefficient of 25.67 L/(g.cm) at 808 nm demonstrate excellent light absorption performance, which can spontaneously convert the solar energy into thermal energy. The polyethylene glycol (PEG) possessing high affinity with MXene acts the medium for thermal energy storage and release in the process of fusion and solidification. The MXene@PEG aerogels are lightweight, with a density about 30 mg/cm3. The MXene skeleton is introduced as supporting materials to keep the shape of MXene@PEG aerogel stable during the phase change process. The MXene nanosheets improve the thermal stability of PEG, the thermal decomposition temperatures can be increased by 40 °C. The actual fusion and solidification enthalpies of MXene@PEG aerogels can reach 167.72 and 141.51 J/g, respectively. The photothermal storage efficiency of MXene@PEG aerogels reaches a relatively high value of 92.5%. This work provides a new type of scaffold for lightweight and shape-stable photothermal carrier and paves the way for the application of non-graphene 2D materials toward solar energy utilization.

Abstract: Sb2Se3, an emerging promising binary compound semiconductor, was prepared at different substrate temperatures by pulsed laser deposition for thin film solar cells for the first time. In this work, CdS and Sb2Se3 films were subsequently deposited by pulsed laser deposition to simplify the process.

Results indicate that Sb2Se3 solar cells film deposited at 500 °C is better, with a better efficiency of 3.58%. Furthermore, SnO2 high resistive layer was introduced into Sb2Se3 solar cell to improve the junction quality, leading to a champion device efficiency of 4.41%.

Abstract: Cancer stem cell like cells (CSCs) present a challenge in the management of cancers due to their involvement in the development of resistance against various chemotherapeutic agents. Over expression of ABCG2 transporter gene is one of the factors responsible for drug resistance in CSCs, which causes efflux of therapeutic drugs from these cells. The development of inhibitors against CSCs has not achieved any significant success, till date. In this work, we have evaluated the anti-proliferative activity of curcumin (Cur) and quinacrine (QC) against CSCs using in vitro model system. Cur and QC synergistically inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of CSCs enriched side population (SP) cells of cigarette smoke condensate induced breast epithelial transformed (MCF-10A-Tr) generated metastatic cells. Cur + QC combination increased the DNA damage and inhibited the DNA repair pathways in SP cells. Uptake of QC increased in Cur pre-treated SP cells and this combination inhibited the ABCG2 activity by the reduction of ATP hydrolysis in cells. In vitro DNA binding reconstitution system suggests that QC specifically binds to DNA and caused DNA damage inside the cell. Decreased level of ABCG2, representative cell survival and DNA repair proteins were noted after Cur + QC treatment in SP cells. The molecular docking studies were performed to examine the binding behaviour of these drugs with ABCG2, which showed that QC (-53.99 kcal/mol) and Cur (-45.90 kcal/mol) occupy a highly overlapping interaction domain. This suggested that in Cur pre-treated cells, the Cur occupied the ligand-binding site in ABCG2, thus making the ligand binding site unavailable for the QC. This causes an increase in the intracellular concentration of QC. The results indicate that Cur + QC combination causes CSCs death by increasing the concentration of QC in the cells and thus causing the DNA damage and inhibiting the DNA repair pathways through modulating the ABCG2 activity.

Abstract: Accumulation of aberrant misfolded proteins is a major hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases. Intracellular accumulations of such abnormal proteins are selectively cleared by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). But how the failure of misfolded protein degradation cause proteinopathies is still an unanswered question?. Previous studies have suggested that few selective quality control (QC) E3 ubiquitin ligase from the UPS can selectively target insoluble aggregated proteins for their intracellular degradation. Few reports suggest that lack or aberrant functions of QC E3 ubiquitin ligases can be a possible causative factor of neurodegeneration and aging. Earlier findings indicated that leucine-rich repeat and sterile alpha motif containing-1 (LRSAM1) is associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth Type 2P (CMT2P) disease in which loss of LRSAM1 function sensitizes peripheral axons for degeneration. Here, our current study for the first time demonstrates that E3 ubiquitin Ligase LRSAM1 is a really interesting new gene (RING) class protein which suppresses the accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates and also alleviates their deleterious cytotoxic effects. We have also observed that LRSAM1 expression is elevated under neurodegenerative stress conditions, and partial depletion of LRSAM1 endogenous levels aggravates mitochondrial abnormalities and severely affects cell survival during proteotoxic insults. Overall, our current finding indicates that LRSAM1 can alleviate cytotoxic insults mediated by a variety of neurodegeneration linked proteotoxic stress events, and most likely LRSAM1 interplay a significant role in between different components of cellular protein quality control mechanism. This study will also allow us to better comprehend the problem of proteinopathies linked with aberrant protein accumulation and open new possibilities to better elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathologies of neurodegeneration and aging.

Abstract: High temperature cooking operations like frying, roasting and baking using solar energy are normally carried out at the focus of parabolic dish concentrators. This leads to heat discomfort, risk of burns or eye damage to the user. A device which stores latent heat in a phase changing eutectic mixture called “solar salt” was designed and tested, which would enable its storage in an insulated container, and cooking in the shade of a kitchen when needed. It was able to successfully store heat at its melting point of 220 °C in a charging time of 110 min. Frying temperature of 170 – 180 °C for the oil was easily obtained during indoor cooking and 0.25 kg of potato chips were fried in 17 min from one charge of heat, while a total of about 0.6 kg of rice was cooked in two successive batches from one charge, taking 20 min each.

Abstract: Morphology engineering is of prime significance in designing semiconductor photoelectrodes for efficient photoelectrochemical (PEC) fuel generation. Herein, we report a strategy to fabricate nanostructured tungsten oxide films using anodic oxidation of tungsten and their performance as photoanodes for PEC water splitting. A solution of an organic compound, dimethyl sulfoxide, with hydrofluoric acid was used as the electrolyte. The anodization parameters such as voltage and electrolyte temperature were found to have a critical influence in determining the porous nature and dimensions of the resulting oxide film. Anodization conducted at a voltage ~10 V and a temperature ~40 °C led to the formation of compact tungsten oxide films due to the low strength of the electric field partially responsible for the porous morphology development. The surface of the film became porous at elevated temperatures. At higher voltages, a thin nanoporous film atop a thicker compact layer was formed; however, the structure became more disordered and less porous when the electrolyte temperature was increased. The study demonstrated that by adjusting the voltage and temperature, the oxide film morphology could be varied from a compact layer to a porous structure resembling nanotubes. The films heat treated at 500 °C attained the monoclinic phase of WO3. The PEC performance was influenced strongly by the morphology of the films. The films with nanotube like morphology yielded incident photon to current conversion efficiency values of over 40%. This study would provide a practical basis for developing optimal WO3 nanostructures for efficient PEC fuel generation.

Abstract: As building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) are becoming increasingly popular, the demand for optimized utilization will be increasing with respect to efficiency, aesthetics and reliability. In cold climate regions, we predict that there will also be a growing focus on how to avoid snow and ice formation on the exterior surfaces of BIPV. During the winter period there is substantially less incident solar radiation. This is also the period when the solar radiation is most needed for heating, lighting and power production purposes. The task to avoid accretion of snow and ice is challenging due to the fact that snow, ice and ambient weather conditions exist in countless variations and combinations. Snowfall, freezing of rain water and condensation of air moisture with subsequent freezing, are examples of aspects that have to be addressed in a satisfactory way. The present study aims to review the cold weather challenges facing BIPV, the strategies for overcoming them and the opportunities that follow from successfully overcoming them.

Abstract: A global goal is to call for common solutions to the challenge of environmental conservation. The cheap, clean and green energy and processes help to beat the hazardous pollution of plastics. An action of the STEP (Solar Thermal Electrochemical Process) on the polymer is to create a novel vision of the depolymerization of plastics to generate valuable fuels plus abundant hydrogen. In this paper, a solar thermo-coupled electrochemical system was first designed and employed to realize the plastics depolymerization to useful fuels for enhanced the solar utilization and the chemical polymer conversion. Exemplified by polypropylene (PP), the plastics were efficiently converted to light fuel and hydrogen via the solar-driven electrolysis coupled with pyrolysis. The results demonstrated that the depolymerization temperature was greatly lowered compared to conventional pyrolysis. The STEP conversion rates increased with a lift of the temperature and current. The high total conversion rate was significantly achieved by reaching 68.48% at 350 °C, including the solid phase of 31.52%, the liquid phase of 7.85% and the gas phase of 60.63% (w/w), which was compared to the 28.39% of the sole pyrolysis. The hydrogen was evolved during the process in the final volume of 72.5 ml, which was about 9.3 times more than that of the pyrolysis at 400 °C. In the outdoor experiments, the total conversion reached 66.64% at 350 °C, which was compared to 26.37% of the pyrolysis only. The light hydrocarbons were richly produced in the distribution of C1–C5 hydrocarbons while only tiny amounts of methane and ethane were probed in the pyrolysis. The common mechanism and pathways can be tentatively proposed in a mode of the radically initiated thermochemical reactions and electrochemical redox by the induction of the solar thermo-coupled electrolysis.

Abstract: Hypertension is one of the main risks causing cardiovascular diseases. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a critical role in many physiological and pathological conditions. However, their role in hypertension is still unclear. In this study, 460 lncRNAs and 522 mRNA were identified to have different expressions in the thoracic aortas of spontaneously hypertensive rats compared with normotensive Wistar–Kyoto rats through next-generation sequencing. Several randomly selected lncRNAs including NONRATT011842 were validated by qRT-PCR and their potential functions were predicted by co-expression analysis with the help of bioinformatics. Moreover, this study focused on the function of lncRNA NONRATT011842 in the vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) during hypertension and confirmed that NONRATT011842 could interact with PABPC1 to regulate the functions of VSMCs. Therefore, the intervention or utilization of certain lncRNAs could be a new biomarker for the diagnosis and prevention of hypertension.

Abstract: We develop a plasma-assisted nitrous-oxide (N2O) gas oxidation (PANO) method to prepare the ultrathin silicon oxide (SiOx) for polysilicon (poly-Si) passivated contact. The effects of preparation conditions, including the substrate temperature, processing time, and plasma power, are studied. Afterwards, we integrate the PANO SiOx into the polysilicon passivated contact and optimize the passivation and contact performances. Excellent surface passivation with the n-type poly-Si and PANO SiOx on the n-type c-Si wafer is achieved by 880 °C annealing, which shows competitive passivation quality to the one with NASO SiOx. Champion implied open-circuit voltage (iVoc) and single-sided recombination saturated current (J0) reach 730 mV and 4.3 fA/cm2 after crystallization; and they are further improved to 747 mV and 2.0 fA/cm2 (3 × 1015cm−3) after subsequent AlOx/SiNx hydrogenation. Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we find that the thickness of PANO SiOx ranges 1.1–2.4 nm and the controlled nitric acid oxidized SiOx (NAOS) ranges 1.3–1.8 nm. The contact resistivity (ρc) is typically <10 mΩ cm2 with the annealing temperature of >820 °C. Also, the crystallinity, phosphorous in-diffusion profile, and current-leaking density of the passivated contacts are investigated. In general, the PANO SiOx and in-situ doping amorphous silicon precursor can be fabricated in one PECVD system without additional equipment or transfer procedures, which is favorable for the high-efficiency, low-cost industrial manufacture.

Abstract: The influence of shunts on multijunction solar cells cannot be directly extrapolated from their effect on single junction solar cells. We show that the rules of thumb for single junction solar cells can mislead to wrong diagnosis on multijunction solar cells when they are only partially shunted. In order to properly assess their performance, three dimensional simulations have been carried out using equivalent electrical circuits. The differences between completely and partially shunted multijunction solar cells under different regimes are pointed out and the use of dark I–V curves and electroluminescence as valid tools to detect the existence of shunts are evaluated. A straightforward application of this work is its use in reliability analysis, allowing an undoubtedly identification of shunts at both, the solar cell manufacture and on-field operation.

Abstract: Antioxidant defences and oxidative stress are related to development, progression and malignancy of colorectal cancer. However, their role in early stages of cancer remains unknown. More and more recent studies have revealed that non-tumour adjacent tissue is not a normal tissue. Thus, our aim was to analyse protein levels of MnSOD (Manganese Superoxide Dismutase), acMnSOD (Acetylated Manganese superoxide Dismutase), SIRT3 (Sirtuin 3), CuZnSOD (Cupper Zinc Superoxide Dismutase), CAT (Catalase), GPx (Glutathione Peroxidase), and GRd (Glutathione Reductase) both in tumour and non-tumour adjacent tissue from colorectal cancer patients by western blot. Non-tumour adjacent tissue seemed to have higher levels of antioxidant enzymes that detoxify hydrogen peroxide compared to tumour tissue. In contrast, tumour tissue had higher levels of MnSOD and acMnSOD. Furthermore, most of the proteins analysed showed significant differences between stage I and II in both non-tumour adjacent and tumour tissue. This could indicate that antioxidant enzymes, especially MnSOD, play a crucial role in early stages of colorectal cancer in both tissues, so they could be analysed as novel biomarkers to improve colorectal cancer diagnosis.

Vitamin D deficiency induces the excitation/inhibition brain imbalance and the proinflammatory shift,

Abstract: Vitamin D3 is among the major neurosteroids whose role in developing and adult brain is intensively studied now. Its active form 1,25(OH)2D3 regulates the expression and functioning of a range of brain-specific proteins, which orchestrate the neurotransmitter turnover, neurogenesis and neuroplasticity. Despite numerous studies of the vitamin D role in normal and pathological brain function, there is little evidence on the mechanisms of alterations in excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission under vitamin D deficiency (VDD). Using the animal model we characterized the dysfunction of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission under alimentary VDD. The shift between unstimulated and evoked GABA release under VDD was largely reversed after treatment of VDD, whereas the impairments in glutamatergic system were only partially recovered after 1-month vitamin D3 supplementation. The increase of the external glutamate level and unstimulated GABA release in brain nerve terminals was associated with intensified ROS production and higher [Ca2+]i in presynapse. The negative allosteric modulation of presynaptic mGlu7 receptors significantly enhanced exocytotic GABA release, which was decreased under VDD, thereby suggesting the neuroprotective effect of such modulation of inhibitory neurotransmission. Synaptic plasma membranes and cytosolic proteins contribute to the decreased stimulated release of neurotransmitter, by being the crucial components, whose functional state is impaired under VDD. The critical changes with synaptic vesicles occurred at the docking step of the process, whereas malfunctioning of synaptic cytosolic proteins impacted the fusion event foremost. The decreased amplitude of exocytosis was inherent for non-excitable cells as well, as evidenced by lower platelet degranulation. Our data suggest the presynaptic dysfunction and proinflammatory shift as the early events in the pathogenesis of VDD-associated disorders and provide evidences for the neuroprotective role of vitamin D3.

Abstract: In this work, a series of dual functional materials, 4,4′,4″,4‴-(ethene-1,1,2,2-tetrayl)tetrabenzoates (ETBAs), were developed with an aggregation-induced emission (AIE) luminogenic center (tetraphenylethylene) and electrochromically active moieties (benzoates). The highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels of the ETBAs were determined via density functional theory calculations. The fluorescent, electrochemical, and electrochromic performances of the ETBAs were characterized via fluorescence spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, UV–Vis spectroscopy, and chronoamperometry. All the ETBAs demonstrated an AIE effect in water/N-methyl pyrrolidone. The ETBAs underwent a quasi-reversible reduction-oxidation. Electrochromic devices based on the ETBAs exhibited a significant color change from a transparent bleached state to a colored blue state, high optical contrast (ca. 80%), and large coloration efficiency. The used substituents markedly influenced the cyclability and response time, and compounds with a larger conjugation degree had lower energy gap values and faster response time. Compound c with a longer alkyl chain length had the best performance with regards to coloration efficiency and cyclability. In summary, this work demonstrated a strategy for the design of novel high-performance ECMs and could extend the applications of such multi-functional materials.

Abstract: We report on the inclusion of 5-aminovaleric acid (5-AVA)—a bulky, long-chained organic molecule—as an additive to enhance the mechanical integrity of hybrid perovskite films. We studied a range of organic cation additives and found that 5-AVA was the most effective at improving cohesion energy, a key metric of mechanical reliability. MAPbI3 films reinforced with 5-AVA added in 5% concentration increased cohesion energy 12-fold from 0.53 J/m2 to 6.04 J/m2, an effect which is attributed to increased plasticity and crack deflection around grain boundaries of the additive-containing perovskite. The addition of 5-AVA also improves Voc in perovskite solar cells and carrier lifetimes with a minimal decrease in PCE, attributed to passivation reducing defect and trap densities. A Tauc plot analysis of the bandgap shows that 5-AVA increases the band gap of the perovskite, correlating with reduced film stress compared to MAPbI3. As a result, the usage of 5-AVA improves the intrinsic thermomechanical reliability, but this improvement comes at the penalty of slightly reduced device efficiency due to reduced charge extraction from the presence of the bulky, insulating organic additive.

Abstract: Titanium oxide (TiOx) nanolayers grown by atomic layer deposition are investigated with respect to their application as carrier selective contacts for crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells. Although TiOx is known to act as an electron contact, in this work the selectivity of TiOx layers is found to be widely tunable from electron to hole selective depending on deposition conditions, post-deposition treatments, and work function of the metal electrode used. Using TiOx and an intrinsic hydrogenated amorphous silicon buffer layer, solar cell test structure exhibiting open-circuit voltages (Voc) as high as 720 and 650 mV are shown for electron and hole selective contacts, respectively. Surface photovoltage and capacitance-voltage measurements reveal that carrier selectivity is correlated with the amount of c-Si band bending induced by TiOx, which are governed not only by the effective work function difference at the Si/TiOx interface, but also by the negative fixed charge present in the TiOx layer. This new finding is in contrast to the previous model for carrier transport where selectivity is determined only by the asymmetric band offsets at the Si/contact interface. It highlights the influence of induced band bending to produce carrier depletion/inversion conditions, and the importance of its selectivity effect in a c-Si absorber.

Abstract: Photocatalytic selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides (NOx SCR) is a green and effective method to eliminate NOx. But the natural sunlight-driven NOx SCR is not realized due to the low temperature under sparse sunlight irradiation and the lack of highly active catalysts. To solve those problems, we selected a commercial AlNx film which can heat the catalysts to 270 °C just under one standard solar irradiation because of its full sunlight absorption and low radiation characteristics, enabling to onset NOx SCR. Further, a polyvinyl alcohol assisted graphene oxides templated method was developed to synthesize the W doped Fe2O3 nanosheets on a large scale, which can be used as efficient NOx SCR catalysts with high N2 selectivity, excellent SO2 and H2O resistances. As a result, the AlNx assisted W doped Fe2O3 nanosheets showed 92% and 90% NO conversion rate under one solar irradiation and outdoor sunlight irradiation respectively without second energy input, first time of realizing natural sunlight-driven photothermal NOx SCR. This strategy demonstrates a great potential on second energy free industrialized NOx SCR.

Abstract: Solar steam generation is a kind of highly promising technology for harvesting solar energy and the production of fresh water. Here, we report the fabrication of a novel Ca2+ crosslinked sodium alginate modified monolithic polypyrrole 3-D conductively porous architecture (M-PPy sponge) with unique micron-sized channels as functional solar steam generator. The as-synthesized M-PPy sponge shows excellent thermal insulation (a low thermal conductivity of 0.0995 W m−1 k−1), superhydrophilicity, nearly 100% light absorption and better mechanical properties. Under a solar light power of 1 kW m−2, a higher evaporation efficiency of 84.72% was achieved, which is comparable to the best performance for polymer systems that have been reported so far. More significantly, the modified monolithic polypyrrole shows the excellent salt-resistant performance in high saline solution with the greater evaporation efficiency of 84.43% and recyclability, making it promising candidate for a variety of applications, including power generation, desalination and so on.

Abstract: A biomimetic diodon-skin nanothorn (DSNT) epoxy resin antireflection (AR) film was presented to reduce the incident reflection loss of Si solar cell and thus improve power conversion efficiency (PCE). The fabricated epoxy resin DSNT film, designed using finite-difference time-domain method, was added on bare Si substrate using a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamps with soft imprint lithography. Optical characteristics showed the reflection was reduced in wavelength range of 300–1100 nm from 40.0% of bare Si substrate to 15.8% of epoxy resin DSNT film/Si substrate. In addition, we found the designed DSNT structure can be facilely transferred onto any flat substrates without deformation into unexpected shapes using soft imprint lithography. Moreover, the epoxy resin DSNT film exhibited superior hydrophobic and self-cleaning properties. By introducing the epoxy resin DSNT film on top of Si solar cell, the reflection loss of the Si solar cell was reduced by 7.8% and thus the PCE was increased from 18.99% to 19.88%. Thus, the epoxy resin DSNT film is a good candidate of AR film for photovoltaic application.

Abstract: Reversible electrodeposition (RED) devices exhibit both transparent and mirror states, allowing light penetration and reflection. Therefore, the incident light transmission regulates the radiant heat generation. However, the low bistability of these devices is the main limitation to their application in windows since it causes continue energy consumption to maintain the mirror state; this is mainly due to the presence of Cu ions in the electrolyte, which is the main dissolution agent of the deposited Ag metal. Thus, we used a three-layered TiO2 counter electrode as an electrochemical reaction mediator and eliminated the Cu ions. In addition, the Ag thin film pre-deposited on the working electrode effectively enhanced the bistability. The combination of three-layered TiO2 and the pre-deposited Ag film allowed a reflectance of 78% and enhanced the mirror-state maintenance of the mirror state. After switching off the voltage, the retained reflectance was 17% at three-layered TiO2 more than twice larger than that at one-layered TiO2 (7%). The bistability and reflectance increase in the proposed RED devices with respect to those based on a Cu-containing electrolyte.

Abstract: Following the recent success of monolithically integrated Perovskite/Si tandem solar cells, great interest has been raised in searching for alternative wide bandgap top-cell materials with prospects of a fully earth-abundant, stable and efficient tandem solar cell. Thin film chalcogenides (TFCs) such as the Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) could be suitable top-cell materials. However, TFCs have the disadvantage that generally at least one high temperature step (>500 °C) is needed during the synthesis, which could contaminate the Si bottom cell. Here, we systematically investigate the monolithic integration of CZTS on a Si bottom solar cell. A thermally resilient double-sided Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact (TOPCon) structure is used as bottom cell. A thin (<25 nm) TiN layer between the top and bottom cells, doubles as diffusion barrier and recombination layer. We show that TiN successfully mitigates in-diffusion of CZTS elements into the c-Si bulk during the high temperature sulfurization process, and find no evidence of electrically active deep Si bulk defects in samples protected by just 10 nm TiN. Post-process minority carrier lifetime in Si exceeded 1.5 ms, i.e., a promising implied open-circuit voltage (i-Voc) of 715 mV after the high temperature sulfurization. Based on these results, we demonstrate a first proof-of-concept two-terminal CZTS/Si tandem device with an efficiency of 1.1% and a Voc of 900 mV. A general implication of this study is that the growth of complex semiconductors on Si using high temperature steps is technically feasible, and can potentially lead to efficient monolithically integrated two-terminal tandem solar cells.

Abstract: Tellurium allows attaining heavy n-type doping levels in GaAs, which is suited to achieve very low contact resistivities in solar cells. Besides, it modifies the energy bandgap of MOVPE-grown GaInP by reducing the group-III sublattice ordering and presents a strong memory effect which induces residual n-type doping in subsequent layers, potentially detrimental to the performance of the solar cell. In this work, we present an inverted rear-heterojunction GaInP solar cell that employs a thick Te-doped GaInP layer as absorber, with a doping profile obtained exclusively by controlling the memory effect of Te coming from the preceding growth of a heavily doped GaAs contact layer. In this way, GaInP is partially disordered with the use of no additional surfactant, leading to an increase in the solar cell bandgap of around 35 meV as compared to traditional samples doped with silicon. In the proof-of-concept experimental devices developed so far, the use of a rear-heterojunction configuration and the bandgap increase results in a global open-circuit voltage enhancement of 109 mV. The photocurrent decreases by 1.32 mA/cm2, mostly due to the bandgap blue-shift, with about 0.35 mA/cm2 attributable to lower carrier collection efficiencies. These preliminary results are discussed by analyzing the I-V curve parameters and quantum efficiencies of a Te-doped rear-heterojunction, a Si-doped rear-heterojunction and a Si-doped front-junction solar cell. An additional advantage is that the emitter sheet resistance is reduced from 551 to 147 Ω/□, which offers potential for higher efficiencies through lower front grid shadowing factors, as demonstrated with the concentrator measurements presented.

Abstract: Background and purpose
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a life-threatening progressive disease characterized by aberrant fibroblast activation. This study aims to explore the role of the circ0044226 on fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition (FMT).
Methods
Bleomycin and TGF-β1 were respectively used to induce the IPF mice model and human lung fibroblasts to myofibroblast differentiation. The mRNA and protein levels were examined by qRT-PCR and western blot. Localization of α-SMA was evaluated by immunofluorescence staining. Cell viability and proliferation were evaluated by CCK8 and EDU test. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to analyze the interaction between miR-7 and circ0044226 or sp1. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay was used for the identification of sub-location of circ0044226 and miR-7 in cells. The IPF model mice received intratracheal injection of AAV-sh-NC and AAV-sh- circ0044226, and lung fibrosis was detected by HE staining, Masson staining and immunohistochemistry assay.
Results
The circ0044226 was upregulated while miR-7 was downregulated in IPF mice model and FMT-derived myofibroblasts. miR-7 was a target of circ0044226 and sp1 was a target of miR-7. circ0044226 was distributed mostly in the cytoplasm and functioned as a miR-7 sponge to positively regulate the expression of sp1. Intervention of circ0044226 could ameliorate FMT and suppress fibroblast viability and proliferation by functioning as an endogenous miR-7 sponge.
Conclusion
Circ0044226 knockdown alleviates fibroblast proliferation and FMT by functioning as a competing endogenous RNA, which may represent a promising therapy for pulmonary fibrosis.

Abstract: Inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite has emerged as a promising material for fabricating highly stable perovskite solar cell devices. However, during the formation of thermally evaporated CsPbBr3 film, an all-solid reaction between CsBr and PbBr2 leads to non-uniform interfaces and high defect density in the perovskite film. In this work, we utilize a two-step sintering (TSS) method which successfully modifies the morphologies of thermally evaporated CsPbBr3 films and the power conversion efficiency of a champion CsPbBr3 perovskite solar cell achieves 9.35%. Steady-state photoluminescence, time-resolved photoluminescence and space-charge-limited-current results prove that the TSS process can effectively reduce defect densities also. Besides these improvements, the TSS device maintains 94% of initial efficiency after being heated at 100 °C without encapsulation for over 40 days under ambient lab condition. In comparison, the untreated device reduces about 15%. Transmission electron microscope results further prove the reduction of line defects in CsPbBr3 crystals after TSS treatment.

Abstract: NiCr–MgF2 spectrally selective solar absorber, which consists of the tandem films of Au, high-metal-volume-fraction (HMVF) NiCr–MgF2, low-metal-volume-fraction (LMVF) NiCr–MgF2 and MgF2, is designed and fabricated for ultra-high solar absorptance and low thermal emittance. The performance of Au/NiCr–MgF2 (HMVF)/NiCr–MgF2 (LMVF)/MgF2 is simulated using the effective medium theory and film matrix method, and the optimized NiCr–MgF2 spectrally selective solar absorber has a normal solar absorptance (αsn) of 0.981 and a normal thermal emittance (εn) of 0.042 at 25 °C. The tandem films of Au/NiCr–MgF2 (HMVF)/NiCr–MgF2(LMVF)/MgF2 are fabricated by magnetron sputtering and measured by UV-VIS-IR spectrometer, and it has an ultra-high near normal solar absorptance of αsn = 0.976 and a low near normal thermal emittance of εn = 0.045 at 25 °C, which approaches very closely to the simulated limit. Furthermore, NiCr–MgF2 spectrally selective solar absorber allows a wide incident angle (θ) with its angular solar absorptance αs(θ)≥0.957 and angular thermal emittance ε(θ)≤0.054 if θ ≤ 50°. Such spectrally selective solar absorber is an outstanding candidate for solar thermal applications.

Abstract: The metamaterial radiative cooling films based on nanoporous SiO2 microsphere-Poly-4-methyl -1-pentene (TPX) hybrid system were deposited on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates via tape casting. Effects of the fabrication parameters, film thickness, SiO2/TPX volumetric ratio and microsphere size on the crystallinity, microstructure, optical transmittance and infrared emittance of the hybrid films were examined. Results show that the crystallinity of the TPX matrix is influenced by the deposition temperature, and the microstructure of the hybrid film is influenced by the film thickness, with the film of 50 μm thickness exhibiting porous microstructure on the surface. The optical transmittance in the visible-near infrared band decreases with the increase of the film thickness and the SiO2/TPX volumetric ratio, and with the decrease of the microsphere size. The absolute quantity of SiO2 microspheres in hybrid film determines the transmittance and the scattering effect. The emittance at 8–13 μm increases with the increase of the film thickness and the SiO2/TPX ratio and with the decrease of microsphere size. The film with 50 μm thickness, 5% SiO2/TPX ratio and 8 μm microspheres exhibits both high emittance (up to 0.91) and high selectivity in the atmospheric window. The cooling device integrating the optimal hybrid film and silver reflective layer demonstrates the lowest temperature in the diurnal test, about 20 °C lower than the black surface, 12 °C lower than the Ag-coated glass and 8 °C lower than the FTO sample. In the nocturnal test, the maximum 4.5 °C reduction relative to the ambient temperature is observed.
