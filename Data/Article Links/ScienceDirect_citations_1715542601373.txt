Abstract: Summary
Development of catalytic generation of allyl–metal complexes through allylic C–H cleavage of alkenes without prefunctionalization followed by site- and stereoselective carbon–carbon bond formation is of great importance in organic synthesis, providing a straightforward and step-economical approach to introduce a versatile allyl group into organic molecules. Although significant advances have been achieved in enantioselective transformations of electrophilic allyl–metal complexes and allyl radicals, enantioselective reactions of nucleophilic allyl–metal intermediates furnished through allylic C–H cleavage remain undeveloped. Herein, we identify a multi-tasking chiral catalyst derived from a commercially available phosphine ligand and cobalt salt that precisely controls the chemoselective formation of the allyl–cobalt complex and the site- and stereoselective addition to carbonyls, delivering a broad scope of homoallylic alcohols with high yield and stereoselectivity. This work may establish a platform for the development of enantioselective transformations of nucleophilic organometallic complexes generated from catalytic C–H functionalization.

Abstract: Summary
Advance prediction of boiling crisis is critical to the safety and economy of many thermal systems. Here, we perform steady-state near-saturated boiling experiments on a plain copper surface and acquire the acoustic emissions (AEs) in natural convection, nucleate, and transition boiling regimes. We use the corresponding AE spectrograms to train a convolutional neural network, which shows a validation accuracy of 99.92% against the ground truth. We next evaluate the trained network on experiments with water and aqueous solutions of ionic liquid and surfactant on plain and nanostructured copper surfaces with time-varying heat inputs. Despite the variations in boiling surfaces, working fluids, and the heating strategy between the training and the evaluation datasets, the network accurately predicts the respective boiling regimes. Finally, we use the insights to perform advance prediction of boiling crisis for mitigating thermal runaway-induced accidents in boiling-based systems.

Abstract: Summary
Radical fluoroalkylation is a powerful synthetic tool for the late-stage incorporation of fluorinated moieties into organic molecules, which is widely used in the development of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Here, we report an efficient radical chlorodifluoromethylation protocol with sodium chlorodifluoromethanesulfinate, which is complementary to the existing late-stage difluoromethylation strategies. CF2Cl radical is a suitable surrogate for accessing the CF2H group while possessing completely different electronic properties compared to the CF2H radical. This method is chemoselective and regioselective for the chlorodifluoromethylation of (hetero)arenes and electron-rich alkenes and shows good functionality, tolerance, and generality on scope. The preparation of the sodium chlorodifluoromethanesulfinate is thoroughly investigated and can be scaled up to hundreds of kilograms. The method is successfully implemented on the synthesis of an oncology candidate compound 1.

Abstract: Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is an immunodeficiency disorder affecting about 1 in 250,000 individuals. CGD patients suffer from severe bacterial and fungal infections. The disease is caused by a lack of superoxide production by the leukocyte enzyme NADPH oxidase. Superoxide and subsequently formed other reactive oxygen species (ROS) are instrumental in killing phagocytosed micro-organisms in neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes and macrophages. The leukocyte NADPH oxidase is composed of five subunits, of which the enzymatic component is gp91phox, also called Nox2. This protein is encoded by the CYBB gene on the X chromosome. Mutations in this gene are found in about 70% of all CGD patients in Europe and in about 20% in countries with a high ratio of parental consanguinity. This article lists all mutations identified in CYBB and should therefore help in genetic counseling of X-CGD patients' families. Moreover, apparently benign polymorphisms in CYBB are also given, which should facilitate the recognition of disease-causing mutations. In addition, we also include some mutations in G6PD, the gene on the X chromosome that encodes glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, because inactivity of this enzyme may lead to shortage of NADPH and thus to insufficient activity of NADPH oxidase. Severe G6PD deficiency can induce CGD-like symptoms.

Lipopolysaccharide induces vascular endothelial cell pyroptosis via the SP1/RCN2/ROS signaling pathway,

Abstract: Endothelial cell pyroptosis is a novel cause of endothelial dysfunction in sepsis. Reticulocalbin-2 (RCN2) is involved in regulating vascular inflammation and plays an important role in the cardiovascular system. However, the role of RCN2 in inflammation-induced endothelial cell pyroptosis remains to be explored. Here, we found that RCN2 was upregulated after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment in a concentration‐ and time-dependent manner. RCN2 knockdown resulted in a significant decrease in pyroptosis, reduced LDH and IL-1β release and ROS production and inhibited the expression of pyroptosis‐related proteins (NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1, and cleaved GSDMD) (all p < 0.05). N‐acetyl‐L‐cysteine (NAC) counteracted the effects of RCN2 on pyroptosis (all p < 0.01). The silencing of RCN2 antagonized the inhibitory effect of LPS on the phosphorylation of eNOS (p < 0.05). We predicted and confirmed that specificity protein-1(SP1) could directly bind to the RCN2 promoter and regulate RCN2. RCN2 overexpression rescued the inhibitory effect of SP1 inhibitor on HUVEC pyroptosis induced by LPS (all p < 0.05). These findings suggested that the activation of the SP1/RCN2/ROS signaling pathway could promote LPS-induced endothelial cell pyroptosis.

Abstract: Summary
Ion diffusion is important in a variety of applications, yet fundamental understanding of the interaction of phonons and the mobile species in solids is still missing. In this work, we introduce two formalisms that determine the individual contributions of phonons to the diffusion of ions through a solid, based on nudged elastic-band calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. The results for a model ion conductor of Ge-substituted Li3PO4 (Li3.042Ge0.042P0.958O4) reveal that more than 87% of the Li+ ion diffusion originates from less than 10% of the vibrational modes between 8 and 20 THz. By deliberately exciting a small, targeted subset of these contributing modes (<1%) to a higher temperature and still keeping the lattice at a low temperature, we observe an increase in diffusivity by several orders of magnitude. This new understanding identifies new avenues for increasing diffusivity by engineering the vibrations in a material without necessarily changing the compound chemistry.

Abstract: Summary
Surface fogging reduces light transmission of optically clear materials and causes various problems in daily life. Transparent photothermal materials have recently emerged as an eco-friendly and sustainable solution to surface fogging. However, most reported photothermal materials only exploited the broadband spectrum of solar energy, and the spectral feature has yet to be tuned to optimize the visibility and photothermal effect simultaneously. Here, we develop a highly transparent, photothermally selective coating, based on solution-processed cesium-doped tungsten trioxide nanoparticles. The transparent selective photothermal coating provides a visible transmittance up to 82% and a high absorption of ultraviolet and near-infrared light >90%, and achieves a temperature increase by 38°C under 1-sun illumination, resulting in remarkable antifogging and defogging abilities under extremely frigid or humid conditions. Large-scale complex surfaces with photothermal coatings are deployed in field antifogging tests as well as long-term durability tests, showing their great potential in antifogging applications.

Abstract: Summary
Iron terminal imido species featuring electron-withdrawing N-substituents represent an important category of reactive metal-ligand-multiple-bond intermediates in iron-catalyzed reactions. Knowledge of them is very limited, however, as isolable complexes of this type are hard to access. Here, we report an isolable iron(IV) imido complex with trifluoromethyl on nitrogen, namely [(IPr)Fe(NC(CF3)2Ph)2]. We prepared the complex from the reaction of a low-coordinate iron(0) complex with N3C(CF3)2Ph. It has an S = 1 ground spin-state, long Fe-N(imido) bonds, and bent Fe-N(imido)-C(imido) alignments and can undergo intramolecular C–H bond activation reaction to transform into an iron(II) amido complex. Theoretical study suggests that the C–H bond activation reaction involves hydrogen-atom-abstraction mechanism and that the electron-withdrawing nature of trifluoromethyl group renders the imido ligands in [(IPr)Fe(NC(CF3)2Ph)2] and the transition state of the hydrogen-atom-abstraction step structurally close to each other, resulting in a low activation barrier.

Abstract: Summary
A wearable thermoelectric generator using human body temperature is a promising power supply for wearable electronics. Here we discuss the design and fabrication of one kind of wearable thermoelectric generator constructed by n-type Mg3.2Bi1.498Sb0.5Te0.002 legs, p-type Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3 legs, polyurethane matrices, and flexible Cu/polyimide electrodes. The proposed device has a low thermal bypass and an efficient thermal contact interface, resulting in a peak power density of ∼20.6 μW/cm2 when placed on a human arm at an ambient temperature of 289 K (air velocity, 1.1 m/s) and a high peak power density of 13.8 mW/cm2 at a temperature difference of 50 K. In addition, it can withstand 10,000 bending cycles at a bend radius of 13.4 mm, suggesting that the proposed wearable thermoelectric generator has the potential to be a real-time power supply for certain wearable electronics in daily life.

Abstract: Summary
Fused aromatic networks (FANs) are a new generation of porous organic networks (PONs), which are thermodynamic products. FANs are also kinetic products with low crystallinity. Nevertheless, their high physicochemical stability suggests many potential applications. This work reports three structures with their fully fused aromatic units vertically (V), horizontally (H), and three-dimensionally (3D) linked to the growth direction, forming “standing” FAN (VS-FAN), “planar” FAN (HP-FAN), and 3D-FAN, respectively. Their performance as sorbent materials was evaluated. While the VS-FAN has the fastest kinetics for CH4 and I2 adsorption due to the highest segmental freedom, the HP-FAN exhibits the best separation selectivity of the CH4/N2 mixture due to the strongest segmental confinement. The 3D-FAN displays the highest adsorption capacity of CH4 because of the highest specific surface area. The results suggest that the different segmental arrangements may critically affect the sorbent performance of FANs.

Abstract: Summary
Laboratory research into bulk-type solid-state batteries (SSBs) has been focused predominantly on powder-based, pelletized cells and has been sufficient to evaluate fundamental limitations and tailor the constituents to some degree. However, to improve experimental reliability and for commercial implementation of this technology, competitive slurry-cast electrodes are required. Here, we report on the application of an approach guided by design of experiments (DoE) to evaluate the influence of the type/content of polymer binder and conductive carbon additive on the cyclability and processability of Li1+x(Ni0.6Co0.2Mn0.2)1−xO2 (NCM622) cathodes in SSB cells using lithium thiophosphate solid electrolytes. The predictions are verified by charge-discharge and impedance spectroscopy measurements. Furthermore, structural changes and gas evolution are monitored via X-ray diffraction and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry, respectively, in an attempt to rationalize and support the DoE results. In summary, the optimized combination of polymer binder and conductive carbon additive leads to high electrochemical performance and good processability.

Abstract: Summary
Nerve agents that irreversibly deactivate the enzyme acetylcholinesterase are extremely toxic weapons of mass destruction. Thus, developing methods to detect these lethal agents is important. To create an optical sensor for a surrogate of the nerve agent tabun, as well as a physical barrier that dissolves in response to this analyte, we devise a network hydrogel that decomposes via a self-propagating cascade. A Meldrums acid-derived linker is incorporated into a hydrogel that undergoes a declick reaction in response to thiols, thereby breaking network connections, which releases more thiols, propagating the response throughout the gel. A combination of chemical reactions triggered by the addition of the tabun mimic initiates the cascade. The dissolving barrier is used to release dyes, as well as nanocrystals that undergo a spontaneous aggregation. Thus, this sensing system for tabun generates a physical response and the delivery of chemical agents in response to an initial trigger.

Abstract: Summary
The irreversible phase transition by water incorporation, along with thermal decomposition, has long been thought to be the dominant degradation pathway to deteriorate electronic and optoelectronic properties of perovskite devices. However, comprehensive characterization and insightful understanding of beneficial effect of water incorporation remains scarce. Here, we capture the phase transformation of perovskite in situ from its precursor stage to the final film upon thermal annealing as a function of relative humidity (RH) by grazing-incident wide-angle X-ray scattering. Quantitative structural analyses show that a moderate water content (RH 40%) enhances the texture orientation of the perovskite. A consequence of the guided water-incorporated treatment is that the unencapsulated device, without any sophisticated instability-mitigation approaches, exhibits excellent tolerance to long-term, light soaking and high-temperature aging, retaining more than 80% of the peak power-conversion efficiency under constant 1-sun illumination or heating at 65°C for more than 1,000 h, respectively.

Abstract: Summary
Recent advances in soft-matter artificial muscles enable machines, especially robots, to reproduce muscle-like actuation of biological organisms, yet there remain substantial and persistent challenges to develop advanced artificial muscles capable of mimicking flexible, controllable, and versatile biological motions. Here, we introduce re-foldable origami strategy into artificial muscles that can use different pre-programmed crease patterns to achieve multimode morphing. Re-foldable square-twist artificial muscles derived from re-foldable square-twist origami is demonstrated, where different twisting directions of re-foldable square-twist artificial muscles are induced through differences in torsional resistance resulting from applying vacuum power on two chambers in sequence. Re-foldable squire-twist artificial muscles can exhibit a complex compound motion coupling twisting, bending, and contraction motions into one, allowing them to flexibly and vividly mimic versatile biological motions by a single muscle or multimuscle combination (like “building bricks”), including hand grasping, bicep stretching, and the bidirectional twisting of the neck, wrist, or ankle.

Abstract: Summary
Under non-metallic catalysis and conditions with no external energy input, there remain to date significant unmet challenges in precise C-H functionalization with controllable sites and numbers. Here, by establishing a hierarchical, porous, low N-doped graphitic carbon/hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) catalyst system, we report selective construction of structurally novel π-extended N,O-heterocycles from tetrahydroquinoxalines and 2-naphthols via oxidative aryl C-H bifunctionalization at room temperature. There is good substrate and functional group compatibility, as well as excellent step and atom efficiency, and the reaction uses an accessible catalyst and a naturally abundant oxidant. Mechanistic study reveals that the in situ-formed catalyst-O2 species stabilized by HFIP enables a decent substrate oxidation to match the coupling processes. The work highlights the potential practicality of a strategy merging suitable carbon material and HFIP in further development of oxidative transformations under sustainable catalysis.

Abstract: Summary
Sustainable structural materials with excellent impact-resistance properties are urgently needed but challenging to produce, especially in a scalable fashion and with control over 3D shape. Here, we show that bacterial cellulose (BC) and bacterially precipitated calcium carbonate self-assemble into a layered structure reminiscent of tough biomineralized materials in nature (nacre, bone, dentin). The fabrication method consists of biomineralizing BC to form an organic/inorganic mixed slurry, in which calcium carbonate crystal size is controlled with bacterial poly(γ-glutamic acid) and magnesium ions. This slurry self-assembles into a layered material that combines high toughness and high impact and fire resistance. The rapid fabrication is readily scalable, without involving toxic chemicals. Notably, the biomineralized BC can be repeatedly recycled and molded into any desired 3D shape and size using a simple kitchen blender and sieve. This fully biodegradable composite is well suited for use as a component in daily life, including furniture, helmets, and protective garments.

Abstract: Summary
Artificial CO2 photoreduction to solar fuels represents an eco-friendly and sustainable solution to obtain “sunshine” feedstocks by using renewable energy media. Herein, we report that single cobalt atoms anchored on two-dimensional Ti3C2Tx-MXene nanosheets act as an efficient photocatalytic ensemble for visible-light CO2 reduction, wherein the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets bridge visible-light absorbers (ruthenium complex) with cobalt active sites. The single cobalt atoms build strong interactions with Ti3C2Tx by forming metal-oxygen/carbon bonds, resulting in the formation of the Co-Ti3C2Tx ensemble. As a result, the production rate of CO reaches a high value of 6.06 mmol h−1 g−1 over the optimal Co-Ti3C2Tx, which markedly exceeds previous MXene-based catalysts for CO2 photoreduction. Theoretical calculation manifests that the isolated Co atoms coordinated with Ti3C2Tx can effectively facilitate the generation of CO. This work may provide a new line of thought into the rational design of high-activity MXene-based photocatalysts toward artificial CO2 conversion.

Abstract: Summary
Halogen bonding (XB) opens avenues to supramolecular assemblies. Here, we report XB-driven supramolecular assemblies of quaternary ammonium iodide (QAI)-containing polymers in three (solution, surface, and solid) phases. In the solution, QAI-containing block copolymers form unique self-assembly structures such as micrometer-sized giant vesicles (up to 5-μm diameter) and a 1-dimensional (1D) structure with multiple inter-vesicular linkages via XB. Exploiting the temperature dependence of XB strength, external molecules are successfully loaded and unloaded. On the surface, reversible XB crosslinking and decrosslinking of QAI-containing polymer brushes are achieved. The wettability of the polymer brush is finely tuned by the XB crosslinking density. In solid phase, QAI-containing monomers are co-crystalized (assembled) via XB. A polymer sheet is obtained via the solid-phase polymerization of the monomer co-crystal; the sheet enables capture and release of halogen-containing (XB-coordinating) guest molecules and thereby serves as an innovative host material.

Abstract: Genomic imprinting is a form of epigenetic regulation and imprinted genes are silenced in a parental-specific manner. Imprinting is associated with various human diseases and cancers, but its roles in leukemogenesis remains elusive. In this study, the expression of a panel of 16 human imprinted genes was investigated using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and 8 of them were further validated in 114 patients newly diagnosed with cytogenetically abnormal-acute myeloid leukemia (CA-AML) and 85 healthy subjects. Our results demonstrated upregulated expression of 8 imprinted genes (C15orf2, COPG2, H19, IGF2, PEG3-AS1, PRIM2, SLC22A3 and ZNF215) was observed in patients with CA-AML (p < 0.001). Patients' survival days were negatively correlated with the expression levels of H19 (p = 0.024), PGE3-AS1 (p = 0.038), and ZNF215 (p = 0.012). Multivariate logistic regression analysis further revealed the expression level ZNF215 can be used as a predictor for five-year survival for patients with CA-AML (p = 0.009) with a hazard ratio of 0.870 (95.0% confident interval: 0.784–0.965). Our results demonstrated that loss of imprinting of imprinted genes is critical for the leukemogenesis of AML under CA condition, and loss of ZNF215 imprinting is associated with poor five-year survival of patients with CA-AML.

Abstract: Vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are important vascular components that are essential for the regulation of vascular functions during vascular atherosclerogenesis and vascular injury. Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) is known to induce SMC activation and foam cell transformation. This study characterized the role of hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) in oxLDL-induced foam cell formation in cultured primary rat aortic SMCs. OxLDL exposure significantly increased HDGF expression and extracellular release. It also upregulated atherogenic regulators in SMCs, including TLR4, MyD88, LOX-1, and CD36. Exogenous HDGF stimulation not only increased the expression of cognate receptor nucleolin, but also the innate immunity regulators TLR4/MyD88 and lipid metabolism regulators, including LOX-1 and CD36. Oil red O staining showed that HDGF did not initiate, but enhanced oxLDL-driven foam cell formation in SMCs. Further signaling characterization demonstrated that oxLDL evoked activation of PI3K/Akt and p38 MAPK signaling pathways, both of which were involved in the upregulation of HDGF, LOX-1, and CD36 induced by oxLDL. Gene knockdown experiments using LOX-1 targeted siRNA demonstrated that LOX-1 expression was critical for oxLDL-induced HDGF upregulation, while HDGF gene depletion completely abolished oxLDL-triggered TLR4, LOX-1, and CD36 overexpression and foam cell formation in SMCs. These findings strongly suggest that oxLDL-induced HDGF upregulation participates in subsequent LOX-1 and CD36 expression in aortic SMCs and mechanistically contributes to the formation of SMC-derived foam cells. The oxLDL/LOX-1/HDGF axis may serve as a target for anti-atherogenesis therapy.

Abstract: Increased expression of developmentally silenced fetal globin (HBG) reduces the clinical severity of β-hemoglobinopathies. Benserazide has a relatively benign safety profile having been approved for 50 years in Europe and Canada for Parkinson's disease treatment. Benserazide was shown to activate HBG gene transcription in a high throughput screen, and subsequent studies confirmed fetal hemoglobin (HbF) induction in erythroid progenitors from hemoglobinopathy patients, transgenic mice containing the entire human β-globin gene (β-YAC) and anemic baboons. The goal of this study is to evaluate efficacies and plasma exposure profiles of benserazide racemate and its enantiomers to select the chemical form for clinical development. Intermittent treatment with all forms of benserazide in β-YAC mice significantly increased proportions of red blood cells expressing HbF and HbF protein per cell with similar pharmacokinetic profiles and with no cytopenia. These data contribute to the regulatory justification for development of the benserazide racemate. Additionally, dose ranges and frequencies required for HbF induction using racemic benserazide were explored. Orally administered escalating doses of benserazide in an anemic baboon induced γ-globin mRNA up to 13-fold and establish an intermittent dose regimen for clinical studies as a therapeutic candidate for potential treatment of β-hemoglobinopathies.

Abstract: Background
Thrombo-hemorrhagic complications cause significant morbidity and mortality in patients with polycythemia vera (PV).
Objectives
To assay and correlate inflammatory cytokines with the thrombotic risk in PV patients.
Methods
This prospective observational study was carried out at Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India over 18-months. The study enrolled 52 patients with PV (newly diagnosed = 28, follow-up = 24), and 20 age/sex-matched controls. Cytokine analysis for IL 1β, IL2, IL4, IL6, IL8, IL10, IL11, IL12/23p40, TNFα, and IFN-γ was performed on the peripheral blood (before treatment initiation for newly diagnosed cases, and after 7 days of stopping drugs for follow-up cases) by flow cytometry-based cytokine bead analysis (CBA) using CBA kits (BD™ biosciences, USA). Results were analyzed using SPSS Statistics 22.0.
Results
The mean age of patients was 51.9 ± 13 years. Levels of IL-6, IL-1β, IL-8, IL-11, IL-12/23p40 were significantly raised, however, TNF-α, and IFN-γ levels were significantly lower in the PV population as compared to controls. A significant correlation between the levels of IL-6, IL-2, and IL-8 with the overall risk of thrombosis in PV patients was observed.
Conclusions
PV patients display an aberrant pattern of plasma cytokine expression, the levels of which correlate with the thrombotic risk.

Abstract: Summary
Over the past 10 years, organometal halide perovskites have revolutionized the field of optoelectronics, particularly of emerging photovoltaic technologies. Today’s best perovskite solar cells use triple-cation compositions containing a mixture of formamidinium, methylammonium, and cesium to enable more reproducible and stable device performance. The common procedure uses as-prepared precursor ink to avoid an undesirable decrease in device performance, attributed recently to a chemical reaction between methylammonium and formamidinium in solution. Here we employ nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to explore different experimental conditions that can significantly modify these reaction kinetics; in particular, we find that the presence of cesium as the third cation can substantially slow down methylammonium-formamidinium reactivity. Our findings allow us to draw up a protocol for extended overtime perovskite ink stabilization.

Abstract: Summary
Three-dimensional (3D) microbatteries are promising candidates as power sources for internet-of-things (IoT) devices. To accelerate the design of 3D microbatteries, we develop and apply a battery-optimization system that consists of an automatic geometry generator coupled with an efficient machine-learning (ML) platform. The input into the analysis is a small amount of performance data from continuum simulations. Because ML-based simulators evaluate the battery performance quickly at an accuracy comparable with that of continuum simulations, it is possible to discover high-performance batteries from many candidate geometries. We successfully design a set of microbatteries having greater energy than the simplest interdigitated-plate configuration, without reducing the power. The results show that the optimal geometry changes with the applied current. One geometry displays 1.4 times greater energy at 3.16 mA/cm2 and the other shows 6.5 times greater energy at 15.8 mA/cm2 compared with the reference geometry. The results exemplify the benefit of our method.

Abstract: Summary
Extending the structural hierarchy and complexity through small-molecular self-assembly is a powerful way to obtain large discrete, functional molecular architecture. A hydrogen-bonded supramolecular organic framework (HSOF) with nanometer-size pores is constructed in a solid state with simple guanosine-monomer self-assembly. To extend the hierarchy of the G-quartet self-assembly to a higher order than that of the traditional G-quadruplex, H-bond acceptors on the C-8 position of guanosine are introduced to establish inter-quadruplex linkage via H bonding to N(2)-HB from the neighboring G-quartet. After screening different C-8 substitution groups and various synthesis conditions, HSOF-G1a’ is obtained by solvent evaporation under diluted condition. Single-crystal X-ray structure reveals that cubic repeating units formed by G8 are the supermolecule secondary building block (SBU) with large pores (d = 34 Å). To our knowledge, this is the first G-quartet self-assembly with an organized structure beyond cylindrical G-quadruplexes.

Abstract: Summary
Conventional thermosets, despite their technological significance in today’s materials economy, present a modern sustainability challenge because of their lack of end-of-life options for recyclability or reprocessability. Emerging covalent adaptable networks (CANs) offer sustainable alternatives to permanently crosslinked materials, but ideal orthogonal working/reprocessing conditions are hardly achievable by the current thermochemical activation mechanism. Here we report a CAN system of additive/catalyst-free, fully reprocessable, crosslinked, tri-block copolymer (tri-BCP) thermoplastic elastomer networks based on acid-anhydride bond exchange operated on a thermomechanical activation mechanism. The unique functionality of the tri-BCP architecture enables self-assembly into inter-linked, hexagonally packed cylinder nanostructures that preclude any productive inter-cylinder bond exchange (and, thus, creep) without cooperative thermal and mechanical (heating and compression) processing conditions.

Abstract: Introduction
Flow cytometry has become an increasingly important tool in the clinical laboratory for the diagnosis and monitoring of many hematopoietic neoplasms. This method is ideal for immunophenotypic identification of cellular subpopulations in complex samples, such as bone marrow and peripheral blood. In general, 4-color panels appear to be adequate, depending on the assay. In acute leukemias (ALs), it is necessary identify and characterize the population of abnormal cells in order to recognize the compromised lineage and classify leukemia according to the WHO criteria. Although the use of eight- to ten-color immunophenotyping panels is wellestablished, many laboratories do not have access to this technology.
Objective and Method
In 2015, the Brazilian Group of Flow Cytometry (Grupo Brasileiro de Citometria de Fluxo, GBCFLUX) proposed antibody panels designed to allow the precise diagnosis and characterization of AL within available resources. As many Brazilian flow cytometry laboratories use four-color immunophenotyping, the GBCFLUX has updated that document, according to current leukemia knowledge and after a forum of discussion and validation of antibody panels.
Results
Recommendations for morphological analysis of bone marrow smears and performing screening panel for lineage (s) identification of AL were maintained from the previous publication. The lineage-oriented proposed panels for B and T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were constructed for an appropriate leukemia classification.
Conclusion
Three levels of recommendations (i.e., mandatory, recommended, and optional) were established to enable an accurate diagnosis with some flexibility, considering local laboratory resources and patient-specific needs.

Abstract: Summary
Carbon-based supercapacitors (SCs) are important electrochemical energy storage devices and are often used in electronic equipment that generates a magnetic field. However, whether the magnetic field affects the charge storage of SCs is unknown. Here, we discover that applying an external magnetic field to carbon-based SCs can induce capacitance change in both aqueous acidic and alkaline electrolytes but not in neutral electrolytes. We further show that, in KOH electrolytes, the competition between the driving force caused by the Lorentz force and the damping force related to the electrolyte conductivity plays a crucial role in affecting the OH− transport under the magnetic field. In H2SO4 electrolytes, the third paramagnetic force generated by the paramagnetic H+ under the magnetic field hinders the H+ transport in addition to the above forces. A quantitative relationship among the limiting current density at the electrode-electrolyte interface, the intensity of the magnetic field, and the concentration and viscosity of electrolytes can therefore be established.

Abstract: Summary
The Povarov reaction, a formal [4 + 2] cycloaddition between N-aryl imines and electron-rich dienophiles, has been defined as an efficient method to approach tetrahydroquinolines and has been well established in the past decades. In general, electron-rich heterosubstituted alkenes have served as the most popular dienophiles to achieve the exclusive regioselectivity. However, the use of Lewis acids and Brønsted acids as catalysts is required in these transformations, and, to our knowledge, the Povarov reaction of electron-rich heterosubstituted alkynes has not been reported. Here, we disclose a catalyst-free Povarov reaction of formyl-ynamides with anilines for the rapid and practical synthesis of a diverse range of valuable quindolines, which not only represents the first Povarov reaction of ynamides to the best of our knowledge but also constitutes a very rare example of a catalyst-free ynamide cyclization reaction. This formal [1 + 2 + 3] annulation shows a reversed regioselectivity compared with the previous protocols.

Abstract: Summary
Ocean solar energy is important for underwater devices. However, the intermittent irradiation and the requirements of many accompanying functional parts make the related devices huge and expensive. It is still a challenge to realize an all-in-one solar-energy conversion platform that can provide a continuous power supply, seawater sensing, and environment restoration simultaneously. Here, we demonstrate an algae-inspired strategy to achieve a multiple-function, ocean solar-energy conversion chain. Specifically, Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) of coordination polymers serve as a robust transshipment depot to connect a photon-driven oxygen-evolution part, with other components enabling the underwater system to produce electricity and oxygen for low-oxygen-zone restoration, to supply continuous day and night electricity, and to sense seawater in authentic seawater. The stability of the system is demonstrated for more than 100 day-night cycles. The concept presented here highlights the prospect of using ocean solar energy to achieve multiple tasks with an all-in-one platform.

Abstract: Summary
The reduction of chemically inert nitrogen to ammonia is a critical step in the global nitrogen cycle. Microbial nitrogen fixation is a promising way to realize nitrogen reduction and ammonia production at mild conditions. Here, we report an engineered, non-diazotrophic Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 strain with nitrogen fixation activity that is constructed by integrating a modified nitrogenase gene cluster into the genome. The engineered S. elongatus PCC 7942 strain is employed in a bioelectrochemical nitrogen-fixation (e-BNF) system for ammonia production. Because the e-BNF system supplies adequate external electrons for the turnover of nitrogenase, the nitrogen fixation activity of the engineered S. elongatus PCC 7942 strain is significantly improved. After 48 h of reaction, the e-BNF system accumulates 173 μM of NH3, which is 21 times higher than that generated from solely photosynthesis-driven nitrogen fixation, with faradaic efficiency of 6.85%. This work may provide new insight into biological nitrogen-fixation systems and ammonium production.

Abstract: Summary
Polymeric carbon nitrides (PCNs) have emerged as promising heterogeneous photocatalysts for organic transformations as they are metal-free, inexpensive, and possess tunable bandgaps, with excellent chemical stability and photo-stability. However, current application of PCNs in organic synthesis is rather limited to several well-established materials, which limits the scope of reaction patterns and efficiency. We herein report the synthesis and fabrication of two PCN nanosheets by incorporating nanostructure construction, element doping, and vacancy engineering into one hybrid platform. The heteroatom doped PCN nanosheets with vacancies feature highly porous structures with extremely large substrate-catalyst interface areas and enhanced charge separation. The generated heterogeneous catalysts demonstrate impressive photoredox catalytic performances in a variety of organic transformations (e.g., defluoroborylation; [2+2] cycloaddition; C–N, C–S, C–O cross-couplings; and an unprecedented regioselective hydrosilylation), providing efficiencies comparable to reported optimized homogeneous catalysts and exceeding those with commonly utilized PCNs.

Abstract: Cytokines/chemokines regulate hematopoiesis, most having multiple cell actions. Numerous but not all chemokine family members act as negative regulators of hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) proliferation, but very little is known about such effects of the chemokine, CXCL15/Lungkine. We found that CXCL15/Lungkine−/− mice have greatly increased cycling of multi cytokine-stimulated bone marrow and spleen hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs: CFU-GM, BFU-E, and CFU-GEMM) and CXCL15 is expressed in many bone marrow progenitor and other cell types. This suggests that CXCL15/Lungkine acts as a negative regulator of the cell cycling of these HPCs in vivo. Recombinant murine CXCL15/Lungkine, decreased numbers of functional HPCs during cytokine-enhanced ex-vivo culture of lineage negative mouse bone marrow cells. Moreover, CXCL15/Lungkine, through S-Phase specific actions, was able to suppress in vitro colony formation of normal wildtype mouse bone marrow CFU-GM, CFU-G, CFU-M, BFU-E, and CFU-GEMM. This clearly identifies the negative regulatory activity of CXCL15/Lungkine on proliferation of multiple types of mouse HPCs.

Abstract: Summary
Developing a membrane-free oxidation reaction, especially using water as the oxygen source, to generate high-value chemicals with high selectivity for replacing low-value O2 over a cost-effective catalyst is significant. In this study, nickel phosphide (Ni2P) hollow nanocubes are designed and shown to enable membrane-free selective oxidation of thioethers to sulfoxides and sulfones with H2O. In situ Raman data reveal the surface reconstruction of Ni2P to NiOOH, and the resulting NiII/NiIII redox couple promotes this transformation. The 18O-labeling experiments confirm H2O as the oxygen source. A cross-coupling of the sulfur-related radical with the hydroxyl radical is proposed. Sulfoxides and sulfones with high yields and selectivity can be controlled via potential modulation, which is challenging for traditional methods. Deuterated sulfoxides and sulfones are readily synthesized via one-pot thioether oxidation and the tandem H/D exchange processes. Wide substrate scopes, good functional group compatibilities, integrating hydrogen production, and paired synthesis of deuterated sulfoxide and arene highlight the potential of this membrane-free strategy.

The features of the nucleobase decorated CrCu6 building block allow the incorporation of up to 9 drug molecules (i.e., ibuprofen and naproxen in this work) per heptameric entity. In addition, we provide a simple way to quantify the incorporated number of drug molecules through a magnetic sustentation experiment in which the field required to keep the particles attached to the electromagnet pole is linearly related to the total mass of the anionic counterion. In this way, it also provides an easy way to determine the amount of entrapped drug molecules, making this SMOF a promising candidate for environmental remediation technologies.

Abstract: Summary
Interfacial solar steam generation is emerging as a promising technique for efficient desalination. Although increasing efforts have been made, challenges exist for achieving a balance among a plethora of performance indicators—for example, rapid evaporation, durability, low-cost deployment, and salt rejection. Here, we demonstrate that carbonized manure can convert 98% of sunlight into heat, and the strong capillarity of porous carbon fibers networks pumps sufficient water to evaporation interfaces. Salt diffusion within microchannels enables quick salt drainage to the bulk seawater to prevent salt accumulation. With these advantages, this biomass-derived evaporator is demonstrated to feature a high evaporation rate of 2.81 kg m−2 h−1 under 1 sun with broad robustness to acidity and alkalinity. These advantages, together with facial deployment, offer an approach for converting farm waste to energy with high efficiency and easy implementation, which is particularly well suited for developing regions.

Abstract: Objectives
The treatment of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) has seen remarkable advances recently. However, relapse occurs in approximately 20% of cases which necessitates identifying additional high risk parameters for treatment intensification. The aim of this study is to assess the prognostic significance of CD45 antigen expression in pediatric ALL.
Methods
We studied 363 pediatric patients with B cell precursor-ALL (BCP-ALL) (n = 313) and T-ALL (n = 50). The ratio of median fluorescence intensity of CD45 expressed in leukemic blasts and normal lymphocytes was calculated. The 75th percentile was taken as cut-off to categorise patients into CD45 high and CD45 low groups.
Results
The 75th percentile was 0.141 in BCP-ALL and 0.548 in T-ALL. In BCP-ALL, there was a statistically significant association of age (≥10 years) (p = 0.027) and National Cancer Institute high risk group (p = 0.001) with high CD45 expression but not in T-ALL. Worse event-free survival (EFS) was seen with high CD45 expression in BCP-ALL (42.17% versus 60.83%, p = 0.0053). In T-ALL, there was no association between CD45 expression and EFS (CD45 high 40.40% versus low 67.35%, p = 0.414). The overall survival (OS) was 70% versus 60% (p = 0.38) in BCP-ALL and the OS was 82% versus 68% (p = 0.16) in T-ALL for CD45 low versus CD45 high groups, respectively.
Conclusion
We conclude that high CD45 surface expression is associated with worse EFS in pediatric BCP-ALL.

Abstract: Summary
Convergent paired electrolysis is an energy-efficient model in organic synthesis, although the main obstacle with its use is matching properties of the intermediates generated in two electrodes. With the development of anodic-coupled electrosynthesis in three-component difunctionalization of alkene, a proposal for two-component difunctionalization of alkene and alkyne using a difunctional reagent has been raised. Herein, we develop a manganese-catalyzed, atom-transfer radical addition of the terminal aryl alkenes and alkynes with sulfonyl chlorides, in which manganese salt has the role of a chlorine atom-transfer catalyst as well as a redox mediator. This method generates analogs of chlorosulfonylated products of high regio- and stereoselectivity, which are derivatives of pharmaceutical drugs and natural products.

Abstract: Summary
Although the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices has recently improved to more than 16%, halogenated solution processes are typically employed to obtain optimal performance. However, halogenated processing is harmful to health and the environment, which can be a significant obstacle to commercialization. Therefore, development of active materials processable under halogen-free conditions is of great importance in this field. In this study, a 16.04% OPV device, processed under halogen-free conditions, is developed by employing a new active-blend system, PBDTTPD-HT:BTP-2F-BO. It is highly soluble in halogen-free solvents, forming a preferential bulk-heterojunction morphology. The PBDTTPD-HT:BTP-2F-BO device achieves a PCE comparable with current state-of-the-art devices based on PBDB-TF:BTP-4F (also known as PM6:Y6) using a conventional halogenated process (16.40% versus 16.33%). Furthermore, it demonstrates a significantly higher PCE than the PBDB-TF:BTP-4F device with a halogen-free process (16.04% versus 9.70%).

Abstract: Summary
Topological surface-enhanced Raman scattering (T-SERS) is a phenomenon in which topological materials change the density of states (DOS) of the substrate through linear dispersion relation to boost photoinduced charge transfer and enhance Raman scattering. Through theoretical and experimental research, we show that the dispersion relation effect in topological materials is the main reason for T-SERS. In theory, the dispersion relation and dimension of the band structure will affect the distribution of DOS near the Fermi surface of substrates, and the change of DOS will lead to the different contribution of charge transfer for SERS. In experiments, the enhancement effect of topological insulators (Bi2Se3, Sb2Te3) and topological semimetal (PtSe2) on the Raman scattering of various molecules are compared. Among these materials, PtSe2 can achieve Raman enhancement of R6G molecules with the concentration of 10−9 M.

Abstract: Summary
Nano-wrinkled polymeric membranes have received tremendous attention for their broad applications in tunable optics, biomedicine, surface wettability, and flexible electronics. However, achieveing a low-cost and scalable synthesis routine remains highly desirable. Here, we invent a simple, bottom-up, polymer engineering strategy by introducing water molecules into the polymerization process. Water evaporation induces intermolecular forces that build a crosslinking reaction gradient from the material surface to its interior, which buckles the surface-forming wrinkles. The shape, geometry, size, orientation, and arrangement of the wrinkles on the polymer surface can be designed accordingly. Moreover, the as-fabricated nano-wrinkled, polymeric membranes display outstanding performance in energy and sensing applications, boosting output current and sensing sensitivity by 611% and 164%, respectively, compared to their flat counterparts. This work may contribute to a low-cost, scalable, and environmentally friendly strategy to engineer polymer surfaces with controllable wrinkles, showing great potential for the development of various soft-matter technologies.

Abstract: Summary
Practicality of lithium-sulfur batteries is severely hindered by the notorious polysulfide-shuttle phenomenon, leading to rapid capacity fade. This issue is aggravated with increase in sulfur loading, causing low-coulombic efficiency and cycle life. Herein, we present a facile strategy to combine hydrophobic sulfur and hydrophilic, conductive Ti3C2Tz-MXene via one-step surface functionalization using di(hydrogenated tallow)benzylmethyl ammonium chloride (DHT). The latter renders the Ti3C2Tz surface hydrophobic, making it readily dispersible in sulfur dissolved in a carbon disulfide (CS2) solvent. By evaporating the solvent, we conformally coat the DHT-Ti3C2Tz (DMX) with sulfur. The developed composite, with higher available active area, enables effective trapping of lithium polysulfides (LiPs) on the electroactive sites within the cathode, leading to improvement in electrochemical performance at higher sulfur loadings. The DMX/S cathodes function with high sulfur loading of ∼10.7 mg·cm−2 and deliver a stable areal capacity of ∼7 mAh·cm−2 for 150 cycles. Moreover, a DMX/S cathode in a pouch-cell configuration retains ∼770 mAh·g−1 after ∼200 cycles at 0.2C (85.5% retention). Ex situ studies elucidate the nature of the LiPs-MXene interaction and the effect of surface functionalization towards improved performance.

Abstract: Summary
The difficulty of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a fundamental impediment to the sustainable production of hydrogen, in which molecular catalysts show the most impressive activity in terms of turnover frequency. Here, we interrogate 444 automatically generated molecular water oxidation catalysts composed of well-known ligand scaffolds and 6 different transition metals (Cr, Mn, Fe, Ru, Co, and Ni). These data confirm the method-independent universal scaling relationship for water oxidation catalysts, describe routes toward circumventing this relationship, and justify the ascendency of Ru catalysts for this reaction. Leveraging this information while applying catalyst design principles, we summarize experimental results, giving credence to our prediction of 9 earth-abundant molecular catalysts with theoretical overpotentials ranging from 200 to 400 mV as promising leads for experimental investigation. We also establish insights into spin-dependent scaling relations for key OER intermediates. Altogether, this work outlines the first steps toward enabling inverse design for molecular OER catalysts.

Abstract: Summary
Hydrogels are commonly integrated with other materials. In the one-pot synthesis of a hydrogel coating, polymerization, crosslink, and interlink are concurrent. This concurrency, however, is often inapplicable for integrating hydrogels to other materials. For example, a permeable substrate will absorb small molecules in the solution, causing side reactions and even toxicity. Here, we report a method to break the concurrency by using photoinitiator-grafted polymer chains (PGPCs). A type of photoinitiator is copolymerized with various monomers. The PGPCs are uncrosslinked during synthesis, have long shelf lives in dark storage, and can be applied to a substrate by brush, cast, spin, dip, spray, or print. Under ultraviolet light, the polymer chains crosslink into a network and interlink with the substrate. The cured PGPC hydrogels are characterized by mechanical tests. Furthermore, the PGPCs are demonstrated to adhere wet materials, form hydrophilic coatings on hydrophobic substrates, and pattern functional groups on permeable substrates.

Abstract: Summary
Molecular encoding in sequence-defined polymers shows promise as a new paradigm for data storage. Here, we report what is, to our knowledge, the first use of self-immolative oligourethanes for storing and reading encoded information. As a proof of principle, we describe how a text passage from Jane Austen’s Mansfield Park was encoded in sequence-defined oligourethanes and reconstructed via self-immolative sequencing. We develop Mol.E-coder, a software tool that uses a Huffman encoding scheme to convert the character table to hexadecimal. The oligourethanes are then generated by a high-throughput parallel synthesis. Sequencing of the oligourethanes by self-immolation is done concurrently in a parallel fashion, and the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) information decoded by our Mol.E-decoder software. The passage is capable of being reproduced wholly intact by a third-party, without any purifications or the use of tandem MS (MS/MS), despite multiple rounds of compression, encoding, and synthesis.

Abstract: Summary
Peroxymonosulfate (PMS)-based advanced oxidation process (AOP) has attracted great attention as an effective technique for oxidatively decomposing organic pollutants. The PMS activation mechanisms, nevertheless, are still ambiguous in many cases, and, thus, controlling PMS activation pathways for efficient pollutant removal remains challenging. In this work, taking defective PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ (PBSCF) as a model system, we demonstrate that oxygen vacancies (Vo••) strongly promote PMS-based AOP, and PMS activation pathways are effectively tuned. Excessive Vo••s are found to modify the surface charge distribution, change PMS adsorption configuration, and break the S–O bond of PMS. As a result, the radical process is promoted, and the predominant nonradical activation pathway shifts from an electron transfer process to singlet oxygen formation. Our mechanistic understanding can guide the rational design of catalysts for efficient water remediation.

Abstract: Breast cancer is primarily derived from mammary epithelial cells, the main cell type in human mammary glands. The majority of knowledge gained thus far around breast cancer has come from research using immortalized epithelial cell lines. The use of primary cells derived from breast tissue can be used in research to provide more biological relevance representative of the heterogeneous nature of breast cancer development and metastasis in its natural microenvironment. However, the successful isolation and propagation of human primary mammary gland cells can be costly and difficult due to their complex in vivo microenvironment and sensitivity when isolated. Here, we present a gentle isolation method for viable human mammary epithelial cells (hMECs) and donor-matched human mammary fibroblasts (hMFbs) from human mammary gland tissue. We isolated, expanded and passaged the hMECs and hMFbs in vitro and characterized cultures using cell-specific markers. A total of four primary cell lines were isolated and established from normal breast tissue and characterized through various markers, including pan cytokeratin (panCK), CK14, CD44, CD31, fibronectin and vimentin by immunofluorescence. To determine functional potential for subsequent studies, epithelial cells were examined via Matrigel® assays to assess spheroid development. Both cell type cultures expressed lineage specific markers with hMECs but not hMFbs forming spheroid structures in 3D Matrigel® assays. Our analyses confirm the successful isolation of two different cell phenotypes from normal breast tissues. This robust technique provides an inexpensive and accessible approach for mammary cell isolation.

Abstract: Introduction
Gaucher disease (GD) is one of the most prevalent lysosomal disorders, with an estimated incidence of 1 in 40,000 live births worldwide. Skeletal involvement is one of the main features of GD, causing morbidity and impacting long-term quality of life in patients with type 1 GD.
Objectives
To characterize bone marrow infiltration in patients with type 1 GD followed at the Gaucher Disease Referral Center of Porto Alegre, Brazil, and to assess whether the Bone Marrow Burden score (BMB) correlates with clinical or laboratory parameters. We also evaluated whether the BMB score is a suitable parameter for long-term follow-up of patients with type 1 GD.
Methods
All included patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging for BMB score calculation at baseline, 1 year, and every other year thereafter or as clinically indicated from 2012 to 2018.
Results
The BMB score tended to decrease during the first 5 years of treatment, at a rate of −1.08 points per year; after the 5-year mark, BMB tended to remain stable.
Conclusions
The BMB score is useful for response monitoring in the first five years of treatment. We recommend that, after 5 years of treatment, MRI for BMB evaluation should only be performed in non-adherent patients or in those who develop symptoms of acute skeletal disease.

Abstract: Hemoglobin H (Hb H) disease is the most significant health problem of the α-thalassemia syndromes. The Hb disease patients are categorized based on their genotype to deletional and nondeletional, with the latter genotype presents the more severe clinical symptoms. Since telomere length is an indicator of biological aging and health, we hypothesized that telomere length could reflect Hb H disease's severity. In this study, we recruited 48 deletional and 47 nondeletional Hb H disease patients, along with 109 normal controls, for telomere length assessment. The leukocyte telomere length was assessed by monochromatic multiplex real-time PCR and reported as the telomere to single-copy gene (T/S) ratio. When telomere length was adjusted for age, the analysis of covariance between the control and the two Hb H disease groups revealed no significant difference. However, the telomere shortening rate was more rapid in the nondeletional Hb H disease group than those of the control and deletional Hb H disease groups. Gender analysis found that male patients have a significantly lower T/S ratio than females in the nondeletional group but not in the control and deletional groups. In the two disease groups, the T/S ratio was not influenced by ferritin level or transfusion burden but was positively correlated with the absolute reticulocyte count.

Abstract: Summary
Conservation of aquatic species requires in-depth understanding of their movement and behavior and their interactions with man-made hydraulic structures. Acoustic telemetry is a primary method to remotely track in 3 dimensions (3D) aquatic animals implanted with transmitters. The transmitter’s weight and size are the major limiting factors because the transmitter should not affect the animals’ natural behavior. Here, we present an acoustic micro-transmitter that weighs 0.08 g in air, only 1/3 that of existing technologies. The transmitter offers a source level of 148 dB (reference: 1 μPa at 1 m) and a service life of 30 days at a 5-s transmission rate. Nearly 100% of tagged fish were detected in field studies, demonstrating the viability of this technology for studying species of early life stages. Information resulting from the use of this technology provides valuable insight for ecological and environmental policy making and resource management worldwide.

Abstract: Summary
Inhibiting amyloid aggregation through high-turnover dynamic interactions could be an efficient strategy that is already used by small heat-shock proteins in different biological contexts. We report the interactions of three topologically non-trivial, zinc-templated metal-organic assemblies, a [2]catenane, a trefoil knot (TK), and Borromean rings, with two β2-microglobulin (β2m) variants responsible for amyloidotic pathologies. Fast exchange and similar patterns of preferred contact surface are observed by NMR, consistent with molecular dynamics simulations. In vitro fibrillation is inhibited by each complex, whereas the zinc-free TK induces protein aggregation and does not inhibit fibrillogenesis. The metal coordination imposes structural rigidity that determines the contact area on the β2m surface depending on the complex dimensions, ensuring in vitro prevention of fibrillogenesis. Administration of TK, the best protein-contacting species, to a disease-model organism, namely a Caenorhabditis elegans mutant expressing the D76N β2m variant, confirms the bioactivity potential of the knot topology and suggests new developments.

Abstract: Summary
Elevated operating temperatures of solar cells encapsulated in modules lead to reduced efficiency and module lifetime. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the challenges and opportunities for passive optical thermal management of PV modules based on the rejection of sub-band-gap light by idealized reflectors and scatterers applied at different interfaces within crystalline Si modules and discuss the limitations to performance at each interface. We find that the annual power-weighted average operating temperature is most readily reduced via sub-band-gap reflection from the module glass, by 3.3 K for Al-BSF modules and 2.9 K for PERC modules with 100% sub-band-gap reflection. Sub-band-gap reflection at the cell interface offers up to 2.2 K (1.8 K) temperature reduction for Al-BSF (PERC) modules, increased cell rear reflection offers up to 1.2 K temperature reduction, and directional scattering offers up to 1.5 K reduction.

Abstract: Summary
While lithium-oxygen batteries exhibit high theoretical energy densities that by far exceed those of conventional lithium-ion batteries, there are a limited number of examples that actually demonstrate cells with high energy density. The limitation of the positive electrode with a capacity high enough to sustain repeated discharge/charge cycles under high areal capacity conditions hinders the implementation of the lithium-oxygen batteries with practically high energy density. In this study, we develop a carbon black powder-based self-standing membrane, which exhibits a discharge capacity of ~7,000 mAh/gelectrode even under high current density conditions (>0.4 mA/cm2). Using the developed self-standing carbon membrane as the positive electrode, a 500-Wh/kg class rechargeable lithium-oxygen battery was fabricated and a repeated discharge/charge cycle was demonstrated at 0.1 C-rate. The results obtained in this study provide new material research directions to realize high energy density rechargeable lithium-oxygen batteries and facilitate their future development.

Abstract: Summary
Despite its promise as a safe, reliable system for grid-scale electrical energy storage, traditional molten sodium (Na) battery deployment remains limited by cost-inflating high-temperature operation. Here, we describe a high-performance sodium iodide-gallium chloride (NaI-GaCl3) molten salt catholyte that enables a dramatic reduction in molten Na battery operating temperature from near 300°C to 110°C. We demonstrate stable, high-performance electrochemical cycling in a high-voltage (3.65 V) Na-NaI battery for >8 months at 110°C. Supporting this demonstration, characterization of the catholyte physical and electrochemical properties identifies critical composition, voltage, and state of charge boundaries associated with this enabling inorganic molten salt electrolyte. Symmetric and full cell testing show that the catholyte salt can support practical current densities in a low-temperature system. Collectively, these studies describe the critical catholyte properties that may lead to the realization of a new class of low-temperature molten Na batteries.

Abstract: Summary
Extreme urban heat causes serious climatic, environmental, and economic problems. Daytime radiative cooling technologies are the most promising cooling technology in recent years. Here, we report experimental and numerical analysis to assess the cooling performance of scalable broadband radiative coolers, evaluate their heat mitigation potential in cities, and investigate their impact on local climate and the atmospheric dynamics. We show that, when air temperature reached its peak, the sub-ambient surface temperature of 8.2°C was achievable for samples with a wind cover. The maximum reductions of peak ambient temperature, average daytime ambient temperature, and highest urban canopy temperature are 5.3°C, 3.6°C, and 13°C, respectively. Collectively, we show that broadband coolers can significantly mitigate urban heat, but the cooling island effect they generate would increase side effects such as a decrease in the mixing layer of the atmosphere and an increase in pollutant concentration.

Abstract: Canonical Wnt signaling is a major pathway known to regulate diverse physiological processes in multicellular organisms. Signaling is tightly regulated by feedback mechanisms; however, persistent dysregulation of this pathway is implicated in the progression of multiple disease states. In this study, proteomic analysis identified endogenous Wnt antagonists in micronized dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane (μdHACM); thereby, prompting a study to further characterize the intrinsic properties of μdHACM as it relates to Wnt activity, in vitro. A TCF/LEF reporter cell line demonstrated the general ability of μdHACM to inhibit β-catenin induced transcription activity. Furthermore, in vitro systems, modeling elevated Wnt signaling, were developed in relevant cell types including tenocytes, synoviocytes, and human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs). Stimulation of these cells with Wnt3A resulted in translocation of β-catenin to the nucleus and increased expression of Wnt related genes. The subsequent addition of μdHACM, in the continued presence of Wnt-stimulus, mitigated the downstream effects of Wnt3A in tenocytes, synoviocytes, and HDFs. Nuclear localization of β-catenin was abated with corresponding reduction of Wnt related gene expression. These data demonstrate the in vitro regulation of canonical Wnt signaling as an inherent property of μdHACM and a novel mechanism of action.

Abstract: Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is an immunodeficiency disorder affecting about 1 in 250,000 individuals. CGD patients suffer from severe, recurrent bacterial and fungal infections. The disease is caused by mutations in the genes encoding the components of the leukocyte NADPH oxidase. This enzyme produces superoxide, which is subsequently metabolized to hydrogen peroxide and other reactive oxygen species (ROS). These products are essential for intracellular killing of pathogens by phagocytic leukocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes and macrophages). The leukocyte NADPH oxidase is composed of five subunits, four of which are encoded by autosomal genes. These are CYBA, encoding p22phox, NCF1, encoding p47phox, NCF2, encoding p67phox and NCF4, encoding p40phox. This article lists all mutations identified in these genes in CGD patients. In addition, cytochrome b558 chaperone-1 (CYBC1), recently recognized as an essential chaperone protein for the expression of the X-linked NADPH oxidase component gp91phox (also called Nox2), is encoded by the autosomal gene CYBC1. Mutations in this gene also lead to CGD. Finally, RAC2, a small GTPase of the Rho family, is needed for activation of the NADPH oxidase, and mutations in the RAC2 gene therefore also induce CGD-like symptoms. Mutations in these last two genes are also listed in this article.

Abstract: Summary
The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has improved dramatically from 3.8% to 25.5% in only a decade. Gas quenching is a desirable method for fabricating high-efficiency cells as it does not consume antisolvents and is compatible with large-area deposition methods such as doctor blading and slot-die coating. To further improve PCEs for gas-quenched PSCs, here, we develop complementary bulk and surface passivation strategies by incorporating potassium iodide (KI) in the perovskite precursor and applying n-hexylammonium bromide (HABr) to the perovskite surface. We show that (1) KI induces a spatial-compositional change, improving grain boundary properties; (2) KI and HABr reduce traps, especially at levels close to the mid-gap; and (3) HABr greatly improves the built-in potential of the device, thereby improving voltage output. The champion device achieves a steady-state PCE of 23.6% with a VOC of 1.23V, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the highest for PSC by gas quenching to date.

Abstract: Summary
The development of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) has facilitated the realization of efficient organic solar cells (OSCs) with minimal burn-in losses and excellent long-term stability. However, the role of NFA molecular structures on device stability remains unclear, limiting commercialization of NFA-based OSCs. Herein, the photostability of 10 OSC devices, fabricated with various NFAs (O-IDTBR, EH-IDTBR, ITIC, and ITIC-M) blended with donor polymers (PTB7-Th, PffBT4T-2OD, and PBDB-T), is investigated. O-IDTBR and EH-IDTBR form highly stable devices with all three polymers, whereas ITIC and ITIC-M devices suffer from burn-in losses and long-term degradation. Conformational instability is found to be responsible for the poor photostability of ITIC and ITIC-M, resulting in poor device stability. Twisting and potential breakage of the chemical bond that links the end group to the main backbone of ITIC and ITIC-M molecules causes undesirable conformational changes. Potential strategies to overcome such detrimental photo-induced conformational changes in NFAs are proposed.

Abstract: Mitochondria were described as early as 1890 as ubiquitous intracellular structures by Ernster and Schatz (1981) [1]. Since then, the accretion of knowledge in the past century has revealed much of the molecular details of mitochondria, ranging from mitochondrial origin, structure, metabolism, genetics, and signaling, and their implications in health and disease. We now know that mitochondria are remarkably multifunctional and deeply intertwined with many vital cellular processes. They are quasi-self organelles that still possess remnants of its bacterial ancestry, including an independent genome. The mitochondrial free radical theory of aging (MFRTA), which postulated that aging is a product of oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA, provided a conceptual framework that put mitochondria on the map of aging research. However, several studies have more recently challenged the general validity of the theory, favoring novel ideas based on emerging evidence to understand how mitochondria contribute to aging and age-related diseases. One prominent topic of investigation lies on the fact that mitochondria are not only production sites for bioenergetics and macromolecules, but also regulatory hubs that communicate and coordinate many vital physiological processes at the cellular and organismal level. The bi-directional communication and coordination between the co-evolved mitochondrial and nuclear genomes is especially interesting in terms of cellular regulation. Mitochondria are dynamic and adaptive, rendering their function sensitive to cellular context. Tissues with high energy demands, such as the brain, seem to be uniquely affected by age-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction, providing a foundation for the development of novel mitochondrial-based therapeutics and diagnostics.

Abstract: Summary
For the RNA world hypothesis, the direct condensation between nucleobase and ribose to afford canonical nucleoside has been a formidable challenge in terms of regioselectivity. In this report, we demonstrate that cavitation, a frequently occurring energy-intensive phenomenon upon the collapse of bubbles, could be a plausible driving force to form the purine nucleosides directly from nucleobase and ribose with the desired regioselectivity. Under cavitation, the overall yield of N9 nucleosides increases compared with non-cavitation conditions, whereas the amount of the undesired ribosylamino isomers decreases. Plausible geochemical scenarios on primordial Earth are proposed that could facilitate enrichment of the desired N9 nucleosides. Under salt-free dry-wet conditions, much improved yield (7.2%) and selectivity (N9/ribosylamino = 0.45) of the N9 isomers are achieved compared with the classical routes.

Abstract: Summary
Force sensors that are thin, low-cost, flexible, and compatible with commercial microelectronic chips are of great interest for use in biomedical sensing, precision surgery, and robotics. By leveraging a combination of microfluidics and capacitive sensing, we develop a thin, flexible force sensor that is conformable and robust. The sensor consists of a partially filled microfluidic channel made from a deformable material, with the channel overlaying a series of interdigitated electrodes coated with a thin, insulating polymer layer. When a force is applied to the microfluidic channel reservoir, the fluid is displaced along the channel over the electrodes, thus inducing a capacitance change proportional to the applied force. The microfluidic molds themselves are made of low-cost sacrificial materials deposited via aerosol-jet printing, which is also used to print the electrode layer. We envisage a large range of industrial and biomedical applications for this force sensor.

Abstract: Summary
Multi-functionalized tertiary/secondary boronates and silanes have found wide applications in areas spanning organic synthesis, advanced material development, and pharmaceutical research. Effective access to these versatile motifs via protoboration/silylation of allenes remains unfulfilled. Capitalizing on the fluorine effects, here we report copper-catalyzed protoboration/silylation of gem-difluoroallenes, which shows an abnormal reactivity profile. In stark contrast to the conventional paradigms of allene functionalization reactions, which are often subjected to the steric-control mode for more facile reaction initiation on lower-substituted double bonds, the present reaction displays a virtually reversed regioselectivity for the more sterically congested π system. The synergistic LUMO-lowering perturbation and stabilization of nascent organocopper by fluorine substituents are deemed critical for guaranteeing the high fidelity of the present transformation. We not only apply this developed methodology to the late-stage modification of compounds derived from natural products but also highlight the utility of the obtained gem-difluoroalkenes in further synthetic elaborations.

Abstract: Summary
Safety and lifespan problems caused by the zinc dendrite formation continue to impede the application of zinc-based batteries. To address this severe issue, it is crucial to fully understand the nanoscale nucleation and early-stage dendrite growth process. However, the key dynamic process can hardly be resolved at the nanoscopic level under ambient working conditions with the current in situ/operando methods. Here, we develop a highly sensitive, super-resolution operando imaging approach for directly investigating the initial electroplating process in the zinc-air battery system. With this approach, millisecond/nanometer-resolution observation is achieved, providing nucleation rate, growth heterogeneity, and direction information at the single zinc nuclei level, and revealing nanoscopic details of early-stage dendrite growth. The spatiotemporally super-resolved observation elucidates that dynamic change in the local electrochemical environment is the key factor for the formation of the zinc dendrites. This novel straightforward approach can enable a deep understanding of the electrochemical interfacial issues and facilitate problem solving in diverse battery systems.

Abstract: Summary
Silicon has been regarded as one of the most promising anodes for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, state-of-the-art silicon-based material suffers from huge volume changes and poor conductivity. Here, we develop a surface engineering strategy to address the intrinsic defects. A dual-binder formed by cross-linking sodium alginate and chitosan is investigated and proposed. Moreover, a 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic diimide (PDI) shell is introduced into the Si@SiOx surface. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that π-π stacking PDI with Li-ion trapping properties is compatible with an SA/CS complex (SC) binder through strong adsorption. These factors buffer the interface tension of Si@SiOx and facilitate Li-ion diffusion. The fabricated electrode shows highly reversible lithium-ion storage and long-term stability. Furthermore, a full-cell configuration with lithium nickel cobalt manganate (NCM) as the cathode demonstrates superior electrochemical properties and potential applications. Such surface engineering creates an opportunity for the fabrication of advanced silicon anodes.

Abstract: The chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal stem cell disorders. The hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) compartment in patients with MPNs is heterogeneous with the presence of both wild-type and JAK2V617F mutant cells. Mechanisms responsible for mutant stem cell expansion in MPNs are not fully understood. Vascular endothelial cells (ECs) are an essential component of the hematopoietic microenvironment. ECs carrying the JAK2V617F mutation can be detected in patients with MPNs. Utilizing an ex vivo EC-HSPC co-culture system with mixed wild-type and JAK2V617F mutant ECs, we show that even small numbers of JAK2V617F mutant ECs can promote the expansion of JAK2V617F mutant HSPCs in preference to wild-type HSPCs during irradiation or cytotoxic chemotherapy, the two treatments commonly used in the conditioning regimen for stem cell transplantation, the only curative treatment for patients with MPNs. Mechanistically, we found that both cell-cell interactions and secreted factors are important for JAK2V617F mutant EC-mediated neoplastic hematopoiesis. Further understanding of how the JAK2V617F mutation alters vascular niche function will help identify new strategies to not only control neoplastic cell expansion but also prevent disease relapse in patients with MPNs.

Abstract: Phagocytosis consists in ingestion and digestion of large particles, a process strictly dependent on actin re-organization. Using synchronized phagocytosis of IgG-coated latex beads (IgG-LB), zymosan or serum opsonized-zymosan, we report the formation of actin structures on both phagocytic cups and closed phagosomes in human macrophages. Their lifespan, size, protein composition and organization are similar to podosomes. Thus, we called these actin structures phagosome-associated podosomes (PAPs). Concomitantly to the formation of PAPs, a transient disruption of podosomes occurred at the ventral face of macrophages. Similarly to podosomes, which are targeted by vesicles containing proteases, the presence of PAPs correlated with the maturation of phagosomes into phagolysosomes. The ingestion of LB without IgG did not trigger PAPs formation, did not lead to podosome disruption and maturation to phagolysosomes, suggesting that these events are linked together. Although similar to podosomes, we found that PAPs differed by being resistant to the Arp2/3 inhibitor CK666. Thus, we describe a podosome subtype which forms on phagosomes where it probably serves several tasks of this multifunctional structure.

In this article, we report the enantioselective phospha-Michael addition reaction that leads to α-chiral phosphine sulfide. An independent hydrogen-bonding co-catalyst is found essential to high enantioselectivity (up to 98% yield and 95% enantiomeric excess [ee]). Divergent derivatizations under mild conditions are also attempted for the generic phosphine and phosphine oxide compounds, further emphasizing the bridge role of phosphine sulfide. An X-ray diffraction structure of κ3-NNS palladium complex also authenticates the coordination ability of p = S moiety.

Abstract: Summary
Artificial N2 fixation is one of the most important industrial processes for human beings. However, the current Haber-Bosch process based on fossil fuel suffers from unsustainability and a low N2 to NH3 conversion. Here, we report a magnesium chloride cycle for the synthesis of NH3 from N2 and H2O at atmospheric pressure. In this cycle, N2 reacts with Mg to form Mg3N2. Mg and Cl2 are produced by the electrolysis of molten MgCl2. NH4Cl is used to hydrogenolyze Mg3N2 to produce NH3, with anhydrous MgCl2 being regenerated. The cycle is closed via the reverse Deacon reaction to convert Cl2 to HCl, which is captured as NH4Cl with the recyclable NH3. This indirect electrosynthesis produces NH3 at an industry-acceptable rate with zero CO2 emission, a coulombic efficiency >92%, and an energy consumption of ∼14.1 kWh/kg-NH3.

Herein, we employ a multi-functional ionic liquid (IL), 1,3-bis(cyanomethyl)imidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([Bcim][TFSI]), which contains an imidazolium cation functionalized with nitrile (CN) groups and the TFSI anion and is, additionally, able to form an extensive network of low-barrier H bonds, as an additive in perovskite-precursor solutions. Because of a combination of the Lewis-basic CN groups and the hydrophobic TFSI anion in the IL, highly crystalline perovskite films with large grain sizes are obtained. The IL-modified perovskite films afford PSCs with long-term stability and PCEs > 21%. The stability of unencapsulated devices retain >95% of their original efficiency after 1,000 h of aging. This study demonstrates the considerable potential of TFSI-based ILs to improve the performance of PSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Optical fluorescence microscopy is shown to enable both high spatial and temporal resolution of redox-dependent fluorescence in flowing electrolytes. We report the use of fluorescence microscopy coupled with electrochemistry to directly observe the reaction and transport of redox-active quinones within porous carbon electrodes in operando. We observe surprising electrolyte channeling features within several porous electrodes, leading to spatially distinguishable advection-dominated and diffusion-dominated regions. These results challenge the common assumption that transport in porous electrodes can be approximated by a homogeneous Darcy-like permeability, particularly at the length scales relevant to many electrochemical systems such as redox flow batteries. This work presents a new platform to provide highly resolved spatial and temporal insight into electrolyte reactions and transport behavior within porous electrodes.

Abstract: Summary
Plasmonic colors enabled by resonant hot electrons offer unique advantages in imaging, display, and optical encryption applications. Although metasurfaces can show full colors with sub-wavelength spatial resolutions, it is challenging for them to generate dynamic colors. Herein, we report an approach to dynamically control the color of semiconducting nanoparticles with plasmonic properties by tuning their hot-electron lifetime from timescales of seconds to days. The color switch is realized by storing photogenerated electrons, which produce plasmons upon light excitation, in carbon nitride. A photochromic display based on long-lived hot electrons is demonstrated. Two-dimensional patterns with unlimited designs and feature sizes from micro- to macro-scale are generated through laser writing or photolithography and then can be erased by exposure to moisture or heat, hundreds of times without obvious destruction to the device. This work may expand the possibilities of using hot electrons for reversibly manipulating the colors of semiconductor nanoparticles with plasmonic properties.

Abstract: Introduction
As coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) spread worldwide and social restrictions were intensified, difficulties in blood supply were expected to result in a shortage of blood donors, logistic issues and a change in blood consumption. Consequences could be detrimental to the meeting of the blood supply demand, especially in a decentralized blood bank in the State of São Paulo responsible for providing blood to more than 100 hospitals, mostly of the public health system. Aiming to minimize negative effects and focusing on maintenance of the blood supply, a different approach was discussed and adopted.
Materials and methods
Briefly, strategies were related to monitoring and promoting measures to achieve a positive RBC unit balance. Thus, the number of donors, transfusions, RBC unit inventory, RBC unit loss and RBC units within up to 5 days from the expiration date were evaluated.
Results
Several strategies were adopted to ensure sufficient availability of RBC units: blood donation was improved with social media and extra blood collections, a restrictive transfusion protocol was implemented, a new logistic process to use RBC units closer to the expiration date was established and non-isogroup transfusions were avoided.
Conclusion
Altogether, described strategies were crucial to optimize blood storage during the pandemic. Investing in monitoring and logistics contributed to a positive RBC unit balance and conserving these strategies could be useful.

Abstract: Summary
There is growing interest in controlled liquid manipulation that is crucial for microfluidic transport, medical diagnostics, and chemical analysis. Existing liquid manipulation methods are restrained in 3 aspects: velocity, space, and environment. Inspired by nature, here, we report a magnetically driven liquid precise manipulation strategy based on the adhesive force between the internal superhydrophilic iron bead and the liquid, which can drive or stop droplets within velocity and volume range of 4 orders of magnitude in an arbitrary path. The droplet velocity can reach ∼2 m/s (2,000 body lengths/s). This strategy breaks space limitation and allows droplets to move along a 360° circle in 3 dimensions and to climb/downhill with any gradient. Magnetically driven liquid manipulation on general solid surfaces or in liquid environments are reported. We propose the concept of the hydrobot and reveal its practical application potential in the fields of soft microrobotics, including cleaning and cargo transportation.

Abstract: Summary
Stabilizing an easy axis of magnetization in an octahedral Co(II) complex is an extremely challenging task, which is evident from reports that more than 90% possess easy-plane anisotropy. Here, we report a six-coordinate complex, [Co(L1)4(Cl)2] (1, L1 = thiourea [H2N-CS-NH2]), that exhibits a D value of −63(10) cm−1. The presence of an easy axis of magnetization associated with 1 is experimentally proven by detailed magnetic studies and polarized neutron diffraction studies, and the experimental observations are well corroborated by theoretical calculations. From the combined experimental and theoretical investigations (on 1 and many model systems), we unveil the parameters that control stabilization of negative D in a thermodynamically favorable and air-stable Co(II) ion in the common distorted octahedral geometry. This study paves the way for overcoming the current impediments to alleviate the easy axis of magnetization using rational ligand choice.

Abstract: Summary
Organization of different iridophores into a core@shell structure constitutes an evolutionary novelty for panther chameleons that allows their skins to display diverse color change. Inspired by this natural color-changing design, we present a responsive core@shell-structured multi-luminogen supramolecular hydrogel system that generates a programmable multi-color fluorescent change. Specifically, red Eu3+-amidopicolinate (R) luminogen is incorporated into the core hydrogel, while blue naphthalimide (B) and green perylene-tetracarboxylic acid (G) luminogens are grown into two supramolecular shell hydrogels. The intensities of G/B luminogens could then be controlled independently, which enables its emission color to be programmed easily from red to blue or green, nearly covering the full visible spectrum. Because of the differential excitation energies between these luminogens, a desirable excitation wavelength-dependent fluorescence is also achieved. Colorful materials with a patterned core@shell structure are also demonstrated for anti-counterfeiting, opening up the possibility of utilizing a bioinspired core@shell structure to develop an efficient multi-color fluorescent system with versatile uses.

Abstract: Summary
Tunneling effects are one of the most basic theories that have long been overlooked in the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) layers of organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, by fabricating BHJ and layer-by-layer (LbL) devices with five different poly(aryl ether)s (PAEs), we reveal a tunneling effect in the active layer of OSCs. The results show that the as-cast devices with 5 wt % and even 30 wt % PAE in PM6:Y6-blends achieve high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 15%. Furthermore, the 5 wt % PAE-based devices with proper post-treatment deliver a PCE of 17.03%. By inserting a thin PAE layer with high dielectric constant, the LbL OSCs (PM6/PAE-237/Y6) yield a 23% improvement PCE compared to one without PAEs. With rational molecular design, we demonstrate that heat-resistant PAE matrices with high stretchability simultaneously improve efficiency, stability, and mechanical flexibility of OSCs. The proposed tunneling effect and PAE matrices strategy have important implications for fabricating efficient, stable, and flexible organic devices.

Abstract: Summary
Isolating electronically conducting material from internal short circuits is a promising way to prevent the onset of thermal runaway within lithium-ion cells. Here, a metal-coated polymer current collector, which is designed to disconnect internal short circuits by withdrawing from the heating region, is tested in 18650 cells. In addition to having lower mass and manufacturing costs, cells with metal-coated polymer current collectors demonstrate a reduced risk of thermal runaway during nail penetration. High-speed synchrotron X-ray radiography of 18650 cells during nail-penetration testing, in tandem with pre- and post-mortem X-ray computed tomography, provides insights into the function of the current collectors. The results are compared with those of 18650 cells with standard commercial aluminum and copper current collectors. Cells with aluminum-coated polymer current collectors demonstrated 100% success in thermal runaway prevention during nail penetration, retaining a cell voltage >4.00 V, while standard cells consistently experienced thermal runaway.

Abstract: Introduction
Historically, the measurement of serum procalcitonin (PCT) levels in patients with leukopenia has been rejected without sufficient prospective evidence to justify this argument. On the other hand, the accumulated use of broad spectrum antibiotics in these patients and their consequences make the use of PCT attractive in an effort to reduce its use.
Patients and methods
We conducted a prospective study between 2016 and 2018, recruiting newly diagnosed FN patients, evaluating them with PCT levels during the first 24 h. After this we evaluate them with overall survival throughout the follow-up.
Results
A total of 81 episodes of FN in 72 patients were included. We report a mortality of 27.2% in our cohort. The mean serum PCT in these patients was 4.01 ng/mL compared to 0.42 ng/mL in the survivors group (p < 0.01). Using ROC curves, we determined a cut-off point to predict septic shock/death at 0.46 ng/mL. Patients with a procalcitonin >0.46 ng/mL had an increased risk of death, with a HR of 4.43, (p = 0.048).
Conclusion
In conclusion, in our trial a single PCT on admission at a cut-off value of 0.46 ng/mL was able to predict the occurrence of septic shock and death in FN patients.

Abstract: Enhancers and promoters are transcriptional regulatory elements whose facilitated interactions increase gene expression. Enhancer DNA sequences can be located far away from the promoter sequences that they regulate. Currently, the mechanism facilitating the establishment of enhancer-promoter interactions remains unclear. However, mutations causing errors in these interactions have been linked to cancer and disease, further conveying the need to understand the full mechanism. This review discusses multiple models that have been proposed to describe how enhancers go the distance to interact with promoters. Evidence supporting loop formation models is reviewed in addition to more complex hypotheses involving aspects of 3D chromatin organization and phase separation.

Abstract: Summary
Metal-free aqueous batteries offer environmentally friendly energy storage without depleting the global reserves of strategic elements. These batteries consist of solid, redox-active polymeric anodes and cathodes with a water-based electrolyte. However, the performance of available active polymers remains inferior, and design principles to guide future development are lacking. Here, we report on the coupled mass, electron, and water transfer behavior for a series of non-conjugated nitroxide radical polymers in a water-based electrolyte-containing organic salt for guiding future design. In situ monitoring of the charge-discharge process reveals the important role of polymer-water interactions. Specifically, improved polymer-water interactions manifest in accelerated kinetics, which promote capacity retention at higher discharge rates. The most hydrophilic polymer, poly(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxy-4-yl acrylamide) (PTAm), yielded a capacity of 115 mAh/g, or 97% of its theoretical value, at 0.05 mA/cm2. At 5 mA/cm2, the PTAm capacity remained relatively high at 50 mAh/g, whereas comparable polymer capacities were much lower.

Abstract: Summary
Organic luminophores exhibiting reversible changes in persistent room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) upon exposure to external stimuli have shown great potential in diverse advanced photonic areas. Here, we present a molecular design strategy for the rational control of photoactivated persistent RTP behaviors of a series of triphenylphosphine oxide derivatives. By introducing various substituent groups, the responsive behaviors, such as photoactivation speeds and emission decay times upon UV excitation, are finely controlled. Crystal analyses and simulated calculations reveal that variations in molecular stacking upon photoirradiation are responsible for different persistent RTP behaviors. Also, one of the luminophores exhibits tunable persistent RTP from blue to green upon changing temperatures. Eventually, information encryption and visual temperature detection of these molecules are successfully demonstrated. Our study will pave the way for further development of novel stimuli-responsive persistent RTP materials with controllable responsive behavior for advanced photonic applications.

Abstract: Summary
Chiral 1,3-propanediamine moieties are present in a range of bioactive small molecules, chiral catalysts, and ligands. The enantioselective desymmetrization of 2-substituted 1,3-propanediamines is a straightforward and efficient method to give access to these types of enantioenriched compounds. However, the state of the art of this strategy is limited to enzymatic catalysis and 2-monosubstituted substrates. Herein, we report the nonenzymatic desymmetrization of C-2-substituted 1,3-propanediamines through chiral phosphoric-acid-catalyzed asymmetric para-aminations of anilines with azodicarboxylates. Both C-2-monosubstituted and C-2-disubstituted 1,3-propanediamine substrates are compatible with this method, providing chiral 1,3-propanediamines bearing C-2 tertiary and quaternary stereocenters with high enantioselectivities. Preliminary mechanistic studies are performed to shed light on the reaction mechanism and the key asymmetric induction transition state.

Abstract: Summary
Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are used to learn single-molecule kinetics across a range of experimental techniques. By their construction, HMMs assume that single-molecule events occur on slower timescales than those of data acquisition. To move beyond that HMM limitation and allow for single-molecule events to occur on any timescale, we must treat single-molecule events in continuous time as they occur in nature. We propose a method to learn kinetic rates from single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) data collected by integrative detectors, even if those rates exceed data acquisition rates. To achieve that, we exploit our recently proposed “hidden Markov jump process” (HMJP), with which we learn transition kinetics from parallel measurements in donor and acceptor channels. HMJPs generalize the HMM paradigm in two critical ways: (1) they deal with physical smFRET systems as they switch between conformational states in continuous time, and (2) they estimate transition rates between conformational states directly without having recourse to transition probabilities or assuming slow dynamics. Our continuous-time treatment learns the transition kinetics and photon emission rates for dynamic regimes that are inaccessible to HMMs, which treat system kinetics in discrete time. We validate our framework’s robustness on simulated data and demonstrate its performance on experimental data from FRET-labeled Holliday junctions.

Abstract: Summary
The Greta oto butterfly has transparent wings with extraordinary omnidirectional anti-reflection behavior, owing to unusual nanostructures with random height and pitch/space distribution on its wing surface. The beauty and efficacy of such nanostructures are proven designs but difficult to reproduce en masse. Here, we establish a low-cost bottom-up approach by simply stacking monolayer-aligned agitation-assisted deposition of silver nanowire (AgNW) meshes followed by deposition of various overcoats. Such AgNW meshes provide the template to grow nanostructures, imitating those on the Greta oto’s wings that consist of randomly situated nanocones with controllable mean pitches and heights. The resulting nanostructure enhances anti-reflections in both SiO2/AgNW and VO2/AgNW systems, which showed reduced omnidirectional reflectance up to 33% and 70%, respectively. Furthermore, the VO2/AgNW system exhibits enhanced luminous and infrared transmittance without sacrificing solar modulation. Our robust bottom-up approach provides a simpler alternate non-lithographic way to economically produce controlled biomimetic anti-reflective nanostructured coatings.

Abstract: Summary
Chemical looping hydrogen (CLH) production is a promising pathway that can offer both use of renewable resources and efficient CO2 capture capabilities. Here, we use the CALculation of PHase Diagrams (CALPHAD) thermodynamic database to study the water conversion capability of metal oxides (MOx) for CLH. We report the discovery of iron-based oxides with theoretical hydrogen yields up to 8 times higher than those of state-of-the-art oxides (e.g., ceria and ferrites). More specifically, Fe0.4Co0.6Ox is found to have a theoretical conversion efficiency capability > 50% at 700°C. Experimental results are presented, and a technoeconomic model quantifies the importance of MOx oxygen capacity and water conversion in this process. This reflects the potential of CLH production with a hydrogen cost of $1.25 ± $0.38/kg at a scale of 50 tons per day. This is comparable to steam methane reforming but with the added benefit of producing a stream of pure CO2.

Abstract: Summary
Direct air capture (DAC) is becoming a technically feasible negative emission technology; however, the fabrication of affordable adsorbents with large CO2 capacities, fast kinetics, and high sorption-desorption stability are of critical importance for the large-scale deployment of the DAC process. In this study, amine functionalized, aqueous miscible organic MgxAl-CO3 layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets are used to efficiently and rapidly capture CO2 from ambient air. 3-[2-(2-Aminoethylamino)ethylamino]propyl-trimethoxysilane (TRI) treatment of highly dispersed LDH nanosheets produces a sorbent exhibiting an impressive adsorption capacity of 1.05 mmol g−1 at 25°C when exposed to 400 ppm CO2, which is 30% higher than equivalent amine-functionalized SBA-15 supports. CO2 uptake reaches 70% of this maximum capacity within 30 min and is twice as fast as supported polyamines. The highly dispersed LDH nanosheets provide excellent thermal, hydrothermal, and chemical stability, with negligible performance degradation after 50 adsorption-desorption cycles.

Abstract: Summary
Scintillators with color-tunable radioluminescence have attracted great attention due to the advantage of satisfying needs required by different radiation detection applications. However, while most traditional scintillators achieve efficient radioluminescence through exciton migration or activator-assisted recombination mechanism, the challenges relating to spectral modulation remain. Here, a composite scintillator consisting of a eco-friendly metal halide heterostructure demonstrates color-tunable radioluminescence with color temperature ranging from 2,505.6 K to 14,215.9 K. Under X-ray irradiation, the composite scintillator emits bright white light with a color rendering index of 92.6 set and a luminescent yield of 21,400 photons/MeV, which originates from self-assembled metal halide heterostructure and efficient energy transfer. The performance exhibited by the composite heterostructure material provides and proves a feasible strategy for realizing color-tunable scintillators in ionizing radiation detection.

Abstract: Summary
Ti3C2Tx (MXene), a thriving member of the two-dimensional (2D) materials family, has shown increasing potential in a myriad of applications, ranging from printable electronics to energy storage and separation membranes. Nevertheless, the dilemma of its oxidative instability and the easy disintegration of its assemblies in contact with water has been restricting its real-life use. Here, we report the benefits of tartaric acid, a natural source, as a non-innocent additive in the MXene composite. In water, it can, above all, inhibit oxidation of Ti3C2Tx and hold individual components in the composite Ti3C2Tx/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy thiophene):polystyrene sulfonate) (Ti3C2Tx/PEDOT:PSS) firmly together; equally important, it can boost 4-fold the composite’s electron conductivity in comparison to the additive-free equivalent. To showcase its practical value, a tartaric-acid-treated, water-stable MXene/PEDOT:PSS conductive coating is made, which serves as electrodes for an ultrafast supercapacitor; among all 2D materials-based assemblies, the designed supercapacitor delivers, to our knowledge, the record-high performance in an alternating-current filtering application.

Abstract: Summary
Donor-acceptor (DA) conjugated polymers (CPs) with narrow bandgaps and open-shell (diradical) character represent an emerging class of materials whose rich behavior emanates from their collective electronic properties and diminished electron pairing. However, the structural and electronic heterogeneities that define these materials complicate bandgap control at low energies and connections linking topology, exchange interactions, and (opto)electronic functionality remain nascent. To address these challenges, we demonstrate structurally rigid and strongly π-conjugated copolymers comprised of a solubilizing thiadiazoloquinoxaline acceptor and cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene or dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene donors. Atom-specific substitution modulates local aromatic character within the donor resulting in dramatic differences in structural, physicochemical, electronic, and magnetic properties of the polymers. These long-range π-mediated interactions facilitate control between low-spin aromatic and high-spin quinoidal forms. This work provides a strategy to understand the evolution of the electronic structure within DA CPs, control the ground state spin multiplicity, tune spin-spin interactions, and articulate the emergence of their novel properties.

Abstract: Summary
Electron donor-acceptor (D-A)-type molecules are the most widely employed two-photon scaffolds. Unfortunately, current D-A-type fluorophores suffer from serious solvent-dependent emission wavelength and brightness, thwarting their use for high-fidelity imaging in complicated biological systems. Herein, with single-atom replacement and acceptor fusing in acedan (6-acetyl-2-(dimethylamino)naphthalene), we devise a new class of D-A type fluorophore (TPQL dyes). Our design results in TPQL fluorophores with a slight emission redshift (ΔλTPQL1 < 32 nm versus ΔλAcedan-NH2 = 91 nm) and high brightness (εΦTPQL1 = 7,600 to 6,923 versus εΦAcedan-NH2 = 7,372 to 1,314) in different solvent systems. Such features not only provide bright and unbiased fluorescent images of TPQL fluorophores in the cell but also bring deeper tissue penetration and greater signal-to-background ratios in tissue. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, using probe TPQL-N3 and TPQL-APN, we monitor the dynamic changes of H2S and APN during zebrafish liver development with high fidelity to the best of our knowledge.

Abstract: Summary
Due to the increasing drug resistance of bacteria and the limitations of antibacterial nanomaterials through photodynamical and photothermal routes, it is necessary to develop novel nanomaterials with outstanding enzyme-like activities and bacteria-binding capability to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) to kill bacteria. Herein, we report the synthesis of two kinds of Cu9S5 nanoflowers composed of assemblies of nanosheets, abbreviated as Cu9S5-1 and Cu9S5-2, which possess predominantly VCuSCu and VCuSS vacancies, respectively, as confirmed by the positron annihilation spectra. Both experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that Cu9S5-2 exhibits excellent enzyme-like activities because of stronger bacteria-binding ability and higher electron affinity that endow it with a superior antibacterial activity compared to Cu9S5-1. This study provides a deeper understanding of nanomaterials with vacancy-type-dependent enzyme-like activities and insights for the rational design of high-performance antibacterial agents in the future.

Abstract: Summary
Room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries have significant potential for large-scale applications due to the low cost and high energy density of both sulfur and sodium. Nevertheless, the insulating nature of sulfur and the shuttle effect are impeding their practical application. Here we report that dispersed single-atom Fe sites anchored on a nitrogen-doped carbon matrix present an atomic-level strategy for the development of sulfur hosts. The electronic structure of sulfur is modified by the atomically dispersed Fe-N4 sites, which can transfer the electron to sulfur, thereby enhancing its reactivity. The S@Fe1-NMC cathode delivers a high reversible capacity of 1,650 mAh g−1 initially and 540 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles at 100 mA g−1. A dual function mechanism is observed on S-Fe-N4 sites, which can activate the polysulfides by weakening the S-S bonds and accelerate Na+ diffusion into Na-poor regions to engender a high driving force for Na2Sx decomposition, thus inhibiting the shuttle effect.

Abstract: In order to reduce iron deficiency in neonates at-risk for iron deficiency, we implemented a guideline to increase the consistency of early iron supplementation in infants of diabetic mothers, small for gestational age neonates and very low birthweight premature neonates. Three years following implementation we performed a retrospective analysis in order to assess adherence to the guideline and to compare timing of early iron supplementation and reticulocyte-hemoglobin (RET-He) values at one month of life in at-risk infants. Adherence with early iron supplementation guidelines was 73.4% (399/543) with 51% (275/543) having RET-He values obtained at one month. Despite good adherence, 16% (44/275) had RET-He <25 pg (5th percentile for gestational age). No infants receiving red blood cell transfusion (0/20) had RET-He <25 pg vs. 26.1% (40/153) of those treated with darbepoetin (p < 0.001). There was no evidence of increased feeding intolerance (episodes of emesis/day) with early iron supplementation.

Abstract: Hemophilia A and hemophilia B are X-linked inherited bleeding disorders caused by a deficiency of coagulation factor VIII and IX, respectively. Standard of care is prophylactic factor replacement therapy; however, the development of neutralizing antibodies against these factors represents serious complications underlining the need for alternative treatment approaches. Human coagulation factor X has a central role within the blood coagulation system making it an attractive target for the development of alternative treatment strategies for patients with hemophilia. This study focuses on a modified variant of the human coagulation factor X with enhanced hemostatic bypass activity due to insertion of a factor IX derived activation sequence. This molecule design leads to the direct activation of the modified factor X protein by factor XIa allowing it to bypass the need for coagulation factor VIIIa/factor IXa. The modified variant was able to correct in-vitro activated partial prothrombin time of human and murine factor VIII/factor IX deficient plasma. Furthermore, reduced blood loss in factor VIII knock-out mice was observed after intravenous application of the modified factor X variant. In conclusion, these data suggest that the factor X variant described here could potentially serve as a bypassing agent independent of the inhibitor status of hemophilia patients. However, more research is needed to further investigate the potential of this molecule.

Abstract: Summary
A long photoluminescence decay lifetime has been regarded as a generic indication of long charge carrier recombination lifetime in semiconductors such as metal halide perovskites (MHPs), which have shown tremendous success in solar cells. Here, we report that MHP polycrystalline films with extrinsic metal ions have a very long charge recombination lifetime, but a much shorter photoluminescence decay lifetime, and this huge difference can be explained by a model of lateral homojunction within each individual grain. The lateral homojunction is formed due to the doping along grain boundaries by metal ions, and then verified by nanoscale potential mapping and transient photo-response mapping. The built-in electric field within each grain reduces the recombination of free charge carriers within the perovskite grain and along grain boundaries, while the free electrons and holes are collected to cathode and anode through the grain boundaries and grain interiors, respectively. Then, the efficiencies of MHP polycrystalline solar cells are increased.

Abstract: Summary
Biomolecular piezoelectric materials offer an inexpensive, non-toxic, and renewable alternative to current commercial piezoelectrics, which rely on toxic heavy elements. Currently, there is a lack of testing for real-world applications of these eco-friendly crystals. Here, we validate an amino acid-based sensor capable of real-time detection of pipe leakage, a global challenge for sustainable water access. The polycrystalline device demonstrates data-driven decision making in identifying degraded pipelines, exploiting the relationship between leak-induced vibration and piezoelectric voltage. The device has piezoelectric strain and voltage constants of 0.9 pC/N and 60 mV m/N. Peak voltage of ∼2 V is recorded in the low-dielectric film at high flow rates and large leak size. The glycine crystal sensors demonstrate much higher sensitivity than PVDF polymer patches. The sensors can operate over a range of test leak sizes, with the energy content of the worst leak state being >10 times that of a healthy pipe.

Abstract: Summary
Kesterite photovoltaic materials of Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) thin films present excellent photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties in solar water-splitting devices. It is found that photoelectrodes, including CZTS for solar water splitting, are suitable for application in solar seawater desalination due to the similarity of their operation principle and work conditions to photoelectrodes/solutions. Here we report the application of a CZTS-based photocathode from solar water splitting to solar seawater desalination. With the TiO2 surface modification layer, the CZTS-based photocathode shows superior stability in the progress of seawater desalination and maintains desalination performance above 95% after testing for almost 500 h. Moreover, the device driven by solar energy does not require an additional electrical supply. The combination of redox flow and ion exchange membrane (IEM) for seawater desalination is a highly efficient and promising water treatment technique that can effectively alleviate the shortage of freshwater resources.

Abstract: Summary
Membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzers can perform stable, high-rate carbon dioxide (CO2) electroreduction for renewable fuels and chemicals, thereby realizing effective carbon utilization to mitigate anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Here, we present a numerical, multiphysics model, computationally intensified 60-fold with a machine learning analysis of computational and experimental data, to address the most urgent systems challenges in CO2 MEA electrolyzers: mitigating carbonate and liquid product crossover to increase CO2 utilization and energy efficiency. We explore the effect of varying the applied potential, CO2 partial pressure, ion-exchange membrane thickness, membrane porosity, and membrane charge on these three metrics. By selectively tuning these physical system parameters, we identify conditions that realize negligible CO2 reactant loss, a 2-fold enhancement in CO2 utilization, and a 2-fold decrease in Nernstian overpotential, corresponding to a multi-carbon, full-cell energy efficiency of 21%. These results may direct future MEA system designs and motivate thin anion-exchange membrane structures.

Abstract: Summary
It is challenging to realize high efficiency and stability in perovskite photovoltaics simultaneously. Here, we show supramolecular chemistry using macrocyclic crown ether to prepare high-performance metal-halide perovskite films. Multiple cooperative supramolecular interactions between perovskites and crown ether are built, and superior defect passivation is achieved. A thin crystalline capping layer on top of perovskites is constructed to synergistically passivate the perovskite surface defects and protect the underlying films from environmental damage. The capping layer is confirmed to be a unique two-dimensional (2D) crystal with a highly ordered, high-crystallinity lamellae structure and face-sharing lead-halide octahedral organization, providing surface protection on the perovskite matrix. Lead-halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with supramolecular passivation and a 2D crystal interlayer demonstrated remarkable photovoltaic efficiency and stability improvements, offering a 21.5% efficiency and improved environmental stabilities under moisture, ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, and thermal stress. Our work provides a strategy to achieve efficient and stable lead-halide perovskite-based devices by crown ether-induced supramolecular passivation and 2D crystal interlayer protection.
