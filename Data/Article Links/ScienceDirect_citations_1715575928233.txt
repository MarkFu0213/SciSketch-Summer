Abstract: Summary
The development of novel strategies for the efficient incorporation of germanium into widespread molecular structures, especially for the synthesis of potentially bioactive molecules, is of interest to researchers. In this context, carbene-mediated insertion reactions of Ge−H bonds are appealing strategies for the construction of C−Ge bonds. However, the utilization of α-aminocarbene intermediates generated from readily available precursors in Ge–H bond insertion remains a longstanding challenge, although it would be a straightforward method for the synthesis of biologically important α-germylamines. Herein, we present a practical and general protocol for the synthesis of α-germylamines via Mg/SmI2-mediated deoxygenative cross-coupling of amides with hydrogermanes. The process is proposed to proceed via reductive deoxygenation of amides to an α-aminocarbene intermediate, which can undergo a Ge–H bond insertion process. This method allows for the incorporation of germanium structures into several drug-molecule-derived amides, offering a promising approach to altering their pharmacological profiles.

Abstract: Summary
Thin and lightweight radiative cooling paints are needed for many weight-sensitive applications. However, it is difficult to achieve high solar reflectance with thin layers. This work develops ultrawhite hBN-acrylic paints that achieve solar reflectance of 97.9% and sky window emissivity of 0.83 with only 150 μm thickness and 0.029 g/cm2 weight, representing significant reductions from previous radiative cooling paints. The high refractive index and nanoplatelet morphology of hBN enable a unique combination of Mie scattering-like high scattering coefficient and Rayleigh scattering-like strong backscattering, and a porosity of 44.3% offers high refractive index contrast between hBN and air; all contribute to achieve high solar reflectance with a thin coating. Field tests show full daytime cooling under direct sunlight, reaching 5–6°C below ambient temperature on average during daylight hours. Our hBN-acrylic paint demonstrates comparable cooling performance with recent best technologies, and the thinness and light weight reduce barriers toward many practical applications.

Abstract: Summary
The increasing incidence of antibiotic-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections is a global health threat necessitating the development of new antibiotics. Serine hydrolases (SHs) are a promising class of targets because of their importance for the synthesis of the mycobacterial cell envelope. We screen a library of small molecules containing serine-reactive electrophiles and identify narrow-spectrum inhibitors of M. tuberculosis growth. Using these lead molecules, we perform competitive activity-based protein profiling and identify multiple SH targets, including enzymes with uncharacterized functions. Lipidomic analyses of compound-treated cultures reveal an accumulation of free lipids and a substantial decrease in lipooligosaccharides, linking SH inhibition to defects in cell envelope biogenesis. Mutant analysis reveals a path to resistance via the synthesis of mycocerates, but not through mutations to SH targets. Our results suggest that simultaneous inhibition of multiple SH enzymes is likely to be an effective therapeutic strategy for the treatment of M. tuberculosis infections.

Abstract: Summary
Owing to the importance of lanthanides (Lns), sustainable recovery of low-concentration Lns from secondary resources is a challenge of great significance. Herein, a strategy to construct a series of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs; Cd-PDI-2D, Cd-PDI-3D, and Cd-NDI-3D MOFs) is proposed by introducing appropriate N-heterocyclic building blocks to explore the effects of functional-group types and framework soft basicity on the Ln-adsorption performance of MOFs. In contrast, Cd-PDI-2D shows amino groups along the 110 crystal plane as effective anchors for Lns, exhibiting super-high adsorption capacity and significant selectivity, due to the softer basicity of the two-dimensional framework. Moreover, the Cd-PDI-2D is utilized as column-packing materials to successfully extract ppb-level Lns from ppm-level competing ions of rare-earth tailings, which demonstrates its great promise for Ln recovery from secondary sources. Furthermore, this strategy could be extended for the enrichment of other noble metals in natural samples by rationally designing targeted linking ligands.

Abstract: Summary
Photochemistry is of broad interest for applications in catalysis, synthesis, and environmental remediation. However, photochemistry applications are largely hampered by rapid recombination of photogenerated charges and/or limited surface areas of photoelectrodes. Combining the advantages of photochemistry and electrochemistry, here we report a strategy using photoelectrochemically driven semiconducting nanoparticles to function as nanobipolar electrodes. The system shows enhanced production of photogenerated charges and has an extended heterogeneous:homogeneous photoelectrode interface and can be applied as an advanced oxidation process for water remediation. Complete removal of refractory pollutants was achieved with a series of n- and p-type semiconductors over a wide range of pH values with tolerance for anions and resistance to photocorrosion. This strategy achieves higher reaction rates than photocatalysis and conventional photoelectrocatalysis (61 and 24 times, respectively) and, hence, lower energy consumption. This bipolar photochemistry strategy may have a wide range of potential applications in energy-, synthesis-, and environment-related fields.

Abstract: Summary
The titanium carbide Ti3C2Tx (Tx = surface functional groups) MXene exhibits promising physical properties and chemical activity as one of the most commonly and extensively investigated materials, but the participating surface structures and properties have yet to be clarified. Here, we reveal the superficial nature of etching-processed Ti3C2Tx using transmission electron microscopy/spectroscopy, first-principles calculation, and molecular dynamics simulation. An O-rich, but C-deficient, diffusion layer (approximately 3 nm) with an inverse gradient distribution is identified. Associated with the superficial substitution of O for C, an amorphous overlayer (approximately 2 nm) containing oxyfluoride of Ti, Al, and C is also revealed. The stable diffusion layer has a high density of states at the Fermi level and a low shear modulus to bulk modulus ratio, implying that the formation of the diffusion layer is not detrimental to Ti3C2Tx’s conductivity and ductility. These findings are significant for improving oxidation strategies and understanding the structural properties of this material.

Abstract: Summary
Lactone-vitamin D3 is a major metabolite of vitamin D3, a lipophilic vitamin biosynthesized in numerous life forms by sunlight exposure. Although lactone-vitamin D3 was discovered 40 years ago, its biological role remains largely unknown. Chemical biological analysis of its photoaffinity probe identified the hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase trifunctional multienzyme complex subunit alpha (HADHA), a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes β-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids, as its selective binding protein. Intriguingly, the interaction of lactone-vitamin D3 with HADHA does not affect the HADHA enzymatic activity but instead limits biosynthesis of carnitine, an endogenous metabolite required for the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria for β-oxidation. Lactone-vitamin D3 dissociates the protein-protein interaction of HADHA with trimethyllysine dioxygenase (TMLD), thereby impairing the TMLD enzyme activity essential in carnitine biosynthesis. These findings suggest a heretofore undescribed role of lactone-vitamin D3 in lipid β-oxidation and carnitine biosynthesis, and possibly in sunlight-dependent shifts of lipid metabolism in animals.

Abstract: Summary
Flexible thermoelectric generators (TEGs) are attractive for their ability to power wearable electronics utilizing the temperature difference between the human body and the environment. Here, we present a self-healing flexible TEG assembled with high-performance Ag2Se films. A room temperature power factor (PF) as high as 20.8 μW cm−1 K−2 is obtained via isoelectronic copper doping. The relative resistance change of the film is less than 5% of the initial value after 1,000 bending cycles, and the resistance of the Ag2Se film recovers to its initial value within a few hours of the bending test. The 6-leg flexible TEG demonstrates a maximum power density of 80 W m−2 at a temperature difference of 50 K. An output voltage of 1.5–2.8 mV can be achieved on the arm in different motion states. These results demonstrate the promising application of Ag2Se-based flexible TEGs for wearable electronics.

Abstract: Summary
The formation of benign polymer scaffolds in water using green-light-reactive photocages is described. These efforts pave an avenue toward the fabrication of synthetic scaffolds that can facilitate the study of cellular events for disease diagnosis and treatment. First, a series of boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) photocages with nitrogen-containing nucleophiles were examined to determine structure-reactivity relationships, which resulted in a >1,000× increase in uncaging yield. Subsequently, photoinduced hydrogel formation in 90 wt % water was accomplished via biorthogonal carbonyl condensation using hydrophilic polymer scaffolds separately containing BODIPY photocages and ortho-phthalaldehyde (OPA) moieties. Spatiotemporal control is demonstrated with light on/off experiments to modulate gel stiffness and masking to provide <100 μm features. Biocompatability of the method was shown through pre-/post-crosslinking cell viability studies. Short term, these studies are anticipated to guide translation to emergent additive manufacturing technology, which, longer term, will enable the development of 3D cell cultures for tissue engineering applications.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we present an approach to identify N-linked glycoproteins and deduce their spatial localization using a combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) N-glycan mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) and spatially resolved glycoproteomics. We subjected glioma biopsies to on-tissue PNGaseF digestion and MALDI-MSI and found that the glycan HexNAc4-Hex5-NeuAc2 was predominantly expressed in necrotic regions of high-grade canine gliomas. To determine the underlying sialo-glycoprotein, various regions in adjacent tissue sections were subjected to microdigestion and manual glycoproteomic analysis. Results identified haptoglobin as the protein associated with HexNAc4-Hex5-NeuAc2, thus directly linking glycan imaging with intact glycopeptide identification. In total, our spatially resolved glycoproteomics technique identified over 400 N-, O-, and S- glycopeptides from over 30 proteins, demonstrating the diverse array of glycosylation present on the tissue slices and the sensitivity of our technique. Ultimately, this proof-of-principle work demonstrates that spatially resolved glycoproteomics greatly complement MALDI-MSI in understanding dysregulated glycosylation.

Abstract: Summary
Proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) hold promise as next-generation energy sources. However, PEMFCs experience substantial faults with various degradation mechanisms during electrochemical operation, leading to performance heterogeneity. In this work, we use magnetic field imaging as an online and non-destructive tool to sense the heterogeneity of a PEMFC performance during its operation. The correlation between PEMFC performance and magnetic field variation is established, followed by numerical models and experimental validation at different PEMFC fault scenarios. From the results, the degradation mechanisms of different faults, including initiation of PEMFC faults at different areas and corresponding progress, can be witnessed online, which can be greatly beneficial for studying reliability and durability of PEMFCs at various operating conditions.

Abstract: Summary
The pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) evades the innate immune system by interfering with autophagy and phagosomal maturation in macrophages, and, as a result, small molecule stimulation of autophagy represents a host-directed therapeutics (HDTs) approach for treatment of tuberculosis (TB). Here we show the marine natural product clionamines activate autophagy and inhibit Mtb survival in macrophages. A yeast chemical-genetics approach identified Pik1 as target protein of the clionamines. Biotinylated clionamine B pulled down Pik1 from yeast cell lysates and a clionamine analog inhibited phosphatidyl 4-phosphate (PI4P) production in yeast Golgi membranes. Chemical-genetic profiles of clionamines and cationic amphiphilic drugs (CADs) are closely related, linking the clionamine mode of action to co-localization with PI4P in a vesicular compartment. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of PI4KB, a human homolog of Pik1, inhibited the survival of Mtb in macrophages, identifying PI4KB as an unexploited molecular target for efforts to develop HDT drugs for treatment of TB.

Abstract: Summary
Widespread Plasmodium falciparum resistance to first-line antimalarials underscores the vital need to develop compounds with novel modes of action and identify new druggable targets. Here, we profile five compounds that potently inhibit P. falciparum asexual blood stages. Resistance selection studies with three carboxamide-containing compounds, confirmed by gene editing and conditional knockdowns, identify point mutations in the parasite transporter ABCI3 as the primary mediator of resistance. Selection studies with imidazopyridine or quinoline-carboxamide compounds also yield changes in ABCI3, this time through gene amplification. Imidazopyridine mode of action is attributed to inhibition of heme detoxification, as evidenced by cellular accumulation and heme fractionation assays. For the copy-number variation-selecting imidazopyridine and quinoline-carboxamide compounds, we find that resistance, manifesting as a biphasic concentration-response curve, can independently be mediated by mutations in the chloroquine resistance transporter PfCRT. These studies reveal the interconnectedness of P. falciparum transporters in overcoming drug pressure in different parasite strains.

Abstract: Summary
Solid-state cooling technology based on elastocaloric effects has shown potential advantages over traditional vapor-compression cooling systems owing to its high energy efficiency and zero greenhouse gas emissions. However, a lack of strategies for improving the elastocaloric activity of polymers remains the main obstacle to their commercialization since the elastocaloric effect was first investigated by J.P. Joule in natural rubber. Herein, we demonstrate that polymer elastomers with molecular chains near molecular-structure-induced plastic-rubber critical transitions exhibit superior elastocaloric activity through reversible conformational changes. As the content of ethyl side groups in the soft block of polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene-co-butylene)-b-polystyrene decreases from 33 to 8 mol %, the adiabatic temperature change increases from −4.3 to −16.3 K, and the isothermal entropy change increases from 38.5 to 173.3 J kg−1 K−1, which thus shows the highest polymer elastocaloric activity near room temperature. This strategy could promote the commercialization of elastocaloric polymers in solid-state cooling applications.

Copper-catalyzed asymmetric radical cyanation reactions have emerged as a powerful platform for construction of a variety of enantioenriched cyano-containing compounds under mild conditions. Herein, we report a copper-catalyzed enantioselective decarboxylative cyanation of readily available β,γ-unsaturated carboxylic acids promoted by a hypervalent iodine(III) reagent. The key allyl radical can be efficiently formed through single-electron reduction of in-situ-generated phenyliodine(III) dicarboxylates by Cu(I) species. This protocol features mild conditions, wide substrate scope, and functional group tolerance, producing a diverse range of chiral allyl nitriles in moderate to good yields and with high regio- and enantioselectivities. The enantioenriched allyl nitrile products can be used for the preparation of various synthetically useful chiral intermediates through simple transformations.

Abstract: Summary
Chemical splicing modulators that bind to the spliceosome have provided an attractive avenue for cancer treatment. Splicing modulators induce accumulation and subsequent translation of a subset of intron-retained mRNAs. However, the biological effect of proteins containing translated intron sequences remains unclear. Here, we identify a number of truncated proteins generated upon treatment with the splicing modulator spliceostatin A (SSA) via genome-wide ribosome profiling and bio-orthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) mass spectrometry. A subset of these truncated proteins has intrinsically disordered regions, forms insoluble cellular condensates, and triggers the proteotoxic stress response through c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation, thereby inhibiting the mTORC1 pathway. In turn, this reduces global translation. These findings indicate that creating an overburden of condensate-prone proteins derived from introns represses translation and prevents further production of harmful truncated proteins. This mechanism appears to contribute to the antiproliferative and proapoptotic activity of splicing modulators.

Abstract: Summary
Membrane-disruptive amphiphilic antimicrobial peptides behave as intrinsically disordered proteins by being unordered in water and becoming α-helical in contact with biological membranes. We recently discovered that synthesizing the α-helical antimicrobial peptide dendrimer L-T25 ((KL)8(KKL)4(KLL)2KKLL) using racemic amino acids to form stereorandomized sr-T25, an analytically pure mixture of all possible diastereoisomers of L-T25, preserved antibacterial activity but abolished hemolysis and cytotoxicity, pointing to an intrinsically disordered antibacterial conformation and an α-helical cytotoxic conformation. In this study, to identify non-toxic intrinsically disordered homochiral antimicrobial peptide dendrimers (AMPDs), we surveyed sixty-three sr-analogs of sr-T25 selected by virtual screening. One of the analogs, sr-X18 ((KL)8(KLK)4(KLL)2KLLL), lost antibacterial activity as L-enantiomer and became hemolytic due to α-helical folding. By contrast, the L- and D-enantiomers of sr-X22 ((KL)8(KL)4(KKLL)2KLKK) were equally antibacterial, non-hemolytic, and non-toxic, implying an intrinsically disordered bioactive conformation. Screening stereorandomized libraries may be generally useful to identify or optimize intrinsically disordered bioactive peptides.

Therefore, flexible and acoustically transparent soft robots show great prospects for applications in marine exploration, biomedical engineering, etc. Inspired by the high water content of jellyfish, we report a hydraulically actuated bioinspired hydrogel jellyfish. The acoustic backscattered energy of the hydrogel jellyfish is reduced to about 1/270 compared with conventional underwater robots, achieving omnidirectional transparency under broadband acoustic detection from 10 kHz to 1 MHz. Moreover, the body length of hydrogel jellyfish can contract to about 1/3 of its original length under hydraulic control, exhibiting flexible motion to pass through narrow orifices. This design can potentially establish generic design principles for constructing next-generation mechanically flexible and acoustically transparent robots.

Abstract: Summary
The realization of actuators that can output thrust is critical for improving the comprehensiveness of actuator functions and broadening the range of soft robot applications. Thrust actuation can be achieved by the volume expansion of active materials under the stimulus, but most expandable materials suffer from the low rate of volume change and/or uncontrollable expansion directions. Here, we design a 3D network of carbon nanotubes with gradient stiffness. By synergistically utilizing the different responses of each stiffness layer to solvent stimuli, a solvent-responsive actuator that can deform rapidly and output thrust directionally is prepared. By adjusting the parameters of the actuator, it can achieve a variety of complex actuations such as multidirectional actuation, multifunctional actuation, sequential actuation, and programmable actuation.

Abstract: Summary
Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) regulates plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels by promoting hepatic LDL receptor (LDLR) degradation. Therapeutic antibodies that disrupt PCSK9-LDLR binding reduce LDL-C concentrations and cardiovascular disease risk. The epidermal growth factor precursor homology domain A (EGF-A) of the LDLR serves as a primary contact with PCSK9 via a flat interface, presenting a challenge for identifying small molecule PCSK9-LDLR disruptors. We employ an affinity-based screen of 1013 in vitro-translated macrocyclic peptides to identify high-affinity PCSK9 ligands that utilize a unique, induced-fit pocket and partially disrupt the PCSK9-LDLR interaction. Structure-based design led to molecules with enhanced function and pharmacokinetic properties (e.g., 13PCSK9i). In mice, 13PCSK9i reduces plasma cholesterol levels and increases hepatic LDLR density in a dose-dependent manner. 13PCSK9i functions by a unique, allosteric mechanism and is the smallest molecule identified to date with in vivo PCSK9-LDLR disruptor function.

Abstract: Summary
Lithium-ion battery safety and durability by nature are dependent on electrochemical and mechanical coupling. Interdisciplinary efforts are required to understand and quantify coupling behaviors. Here we design and conduct mechanically constrained charge and discharge characterizations with efforts supported by multiphysics modeling to unravel the coupling mechanisms of solid-liquid electrode-electrolyte and solid-solid active materials in lithium-ion batteries. We demonstrate that a lithium-ion battery cell under mechanical constraint exhibits a higher voltage during charging and a shorter charging time because of increased electrolyte resistance and decreased diffusivity caused by decreased electrode porosity. The reaction force response of the cell is a combined result of the cell structural response mechanically and lithium-ion intercalation/de-intercalation-induced volume variation electrochemically. Under mechanical constraint, cell capacity is significantly reduced in fast-charge scenarios; however, it can be recovered by a constant-voltage charge protocol. The results highlight the promise of multiphysics approaches to unravel the electrochemical-mechanical coupling mechanisms to direct battery system design and management.

Abstract: Summary
Achieving delicate broken symmetry enables significant modification of crystals, from which a variety of property or performance modulation can be expected. Here, we report that the electrochemical performance of wolframite-type CoWO4 is significantly boosted using a Mo-substituted-W strategy. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that molybdenum substitution achieves WO6 coordination broken symmetry effectively, and it renders electroactive cobalt centers more polar, thus promoting the charge diffusion kinetics. Additionally, the enhancement of OH− adsorption energy can also alter the pseudocapacitive charge storage property, which significantly reinforces ion diffusion kinetics. As a result, the optimized molybdenum substitution (20 mol%) in CoWO4 exhibits a specific capacitance of 840 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, as well as a maximal energy density of 33.68 Wh kg−1 at power density of 800 W kg−1. Inspired by manipulating symmetry of crystals, our findings may provide insights into the origin of the substitution-promoted enhanced reaction kinetics.

Abstract: Summary
MicroRNA families are ubiquitous in the human transcriptome, yet targeting of individual members is challenging because of sequence homology. Many secondary structures of the precursors to these miRNAs (pri- and pre-miRNAs), however, are quite different. Here, we demonstrate both in vitro and in cellulis that design of structure-specific small molecules can inhibit a particular miRNA family member to modulate a disease pathway. The miR-200 family consists of five miRNAs, miR-200a, -200b, -200c, -141, and -429, and is associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We designed a small molecule that potently and selectively targets pre-miR-200c’s structure and reverses a pro-apoptotic effect in a pancreatic β cell model. In contrast, an oligonucleotide targeting the RNA’s sequence inhibited all family members. Global proteomics and RNA sequencing analyses further demonstrate selectivity for miR-200c. Collectively, these studies establish that miR-200c plays an important role in T2D, and small molecules targeting RNA structure can be an important complement to oligonucleotides.

Abstract: Summary
Interleukin-23 (IL-23) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in the host defense against pathogens but is also implicated in the development of several autoimmune disorders. The IL-23 receptor has become a key target for drug discovery, but the exact mechanism of the receptor ligand interaction remains poorly understood. In this study the affinities of IL-23 for its individual receptor components (IL23R and IL12Rβ1) and the heteromeric complex formed between them have been measured in living cells using NanoLuciferase-tagged full-length proteins. Here, we demonstrate that TAMRA-tagged IL-23 has a greater than 7-fold higher affinity for IL12Rβ1 than IL23R. However, in the presence of both receptor subunits, IL-23 affinity is increased more than three orders of magnitude to 27 pM. Furthermore, we show that IL-23 induces a potent change in the position of the N-terminal domains of the two receptor subunits, consistent with a conformational change in the heteromeric receptor structure.

Abstract: Summary
Porous cellulose can be tuned dynamically between reflecting and transparent states through reversible wetting with liquids like water while remaining non-absorptive in both states. By combining porous cellulose with an underlying cellulose-carbon nanotube layer, we here report a Janus cellulose that instead switches between reflecting and absorptive states. While the material is reflective and low absorbing in its dry state, exposure to water increases the optical transparency of the top layer and enables the bottom layer to absorb solar light and generate heat. In turn, this initiates a self-adaptive process that drives water evaporation and dries the structure, making it reflective again. In situ measurements of scattering intensity, temperature, and water evaporation reveal an intriguing dynamic relationship between the optical and thermal properties of the Janus cellulose. This study highlights the use of cellulose systems for solar and thermal management, demonstrating solar-induced self-adaptive heating, evaporative drying, and thermal regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Prediction of battery health from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data can enable rapid measurement of battery state in real-world applications without using additional sensors or time-consuming performance measurements. However, deconvoluting the effect of capacity, state of charge, and temperature on EIS response is complicated analytically. Here, various machine-learning models, such as linear, Gaussian process, random forest, and artificial neural network regression, are utilized to predict capacity from EIS using hundreds of capacity, direct current (DC) resistance, and EIS measurements recorded under varying conditions of health, temperature, and state of charge (SOC). Several feature extraction and selection methods from traditional electrochemical analysis and statistical modeling are explored using machine-learning pipelines. EIS data from just two frequencies can accurately predict capacity, and interrogation shows that the optimal set of frequencies is not usually intuitive. Best results are achieved with an ensemble model, which predicts battery capacity with a mean absolute error of 1.9% on data from unobserved cells.

Abstract: Summary
Mineralization is a natural process that constructs intricate structures at diverse interfaces, but with poor controllability. Herein, we present an alternative strategy for dynamic control of nano-scale mineralization processes and the subsequent construction of an all-in-one healing agent to meet the requirements of wound healing with complex physiological processes. The key point is the reversible metal-polyphenol coordination, where polyphenol acts as a capping agent to stabilize the mineralized precursor solution. Upon combination with metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) that can competitively capture polyphenol from solution to disrupt the balance of stabilized precursors, the released mineral ions result in fast mineralization on MOF surface. The mineralized metal-phenolic frameworks feature plug-and-play properties. After being loaded into a gelatin-chitosan hydrogel, the composite hydrogel exhibits antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects while promoting angiogenesis, collagen deposition, and hair follicle regeneration. The mineralization strategy could also be applied to thin film technology for a range of applications.

Abstract: Summary
Developing methods for chemical sensing is of importance in broad applications, including food safety, healthcare, and ecology. The work herein describes an approach to chemical sensing by interfacial voltage. A test electrode is coated with a dielectric and a receptor. When the test electrode contacts an electrolyte, the receptor adsorbs an analyte from the electrolyte. The adsorption generates an interfacial voltage, a measurement of which reports the concentration of the analyte. This design de-integrates two aspects of sensing: adsorption and detection. Consequently, the test electrode can be made of any electronic conductor. This flexibility enables sensors to be fabricated without microelectronic facilities. Several species of ions and organic molecules are detected, and a wearable chemical sensor worn on a fingertip is demonstrated. Needle-shaped electrodes are developed to test soft biological tissues. Chemical sensing by interfacial voltage holds promise for the development of ubiquitous sensing technology.

Abstract: Summary
The sodium iodide symporter (NIS) functions to transport iodide and is critical for successful radioiodide ablation of cancer cells. Approaches to bolster NIS function and diminish recurrence post-radioiodide therapy are impeded by oncogenic pathways that suppress NIS, as well as the inherent complexity of NIS regulation. Here, we utilize NIS in high-throughput drug screening and undertake rigorous evaluation of lead compounds to identify and target key processes underpinning NIS function. We find that multiple proteostasis pathways, including proteasomal degradation and autophagy, are central to the cellular processing of NIS. Utilizing inhibitors targeting distinct molecular processes, we pinpoint combinatorial drug strategies giving robust >5-fold increases in radioiodide uptake. We also reveal significant dysregulation of core proteostasis genes in human tumors, identifying a 13-gene risk score classifier as an independent predictor of recurrence in radioiodide-treated patients. We thus propose and discuss a model for targetable steps of intracellular processing of NIS function.

Abstract: Summary
Much of our current knowledge on nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) is based on studies in which the full NRPS system or each protein domain is expressed in heterologous hosts. Consequently, methods to detect the endogenous activity of NRPSs, under natural cellular conditions, are needed for the study of NRPS cell biology. Here, we describe the in vivo activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) for endogenous NRPSs and its applications to the study of their activities in bacteria. Remarkably, in vitro and in vivo ABPP in the context of the surfactin producer Bacillus subtilis enabled the visualization, tracking, and imaging of an endogenous SrfAB-NRPS with remarkable selectivity and sensitivity. Furthermore, in vivo, ABPP allowed the discovery of the degradation processes of the endogenous SrfAB-NRPS in the context of its native producer bacteria. Overall, this study deepens our understanding of the properties of NRPSs that cannot be addressed by conventional methods.

Abstract: Summary
Dry reforming of methane economically converts methane and carbon dioxide into syngas (hydrogen and carbon monoxide) but requires high energy and often suffers from catalyst instability. Here, a surface-modulation strategy is demonstrated via decorating in situ defects on isolated nickel (Ni) atoms over La2O3 for boosting light-driven dry reforming of methane activity. Atomically dispersed 0.5Ni/La2O3 achieves a hydrogen evolution rate of 170.9 mol gNi−1 h−1. The reactivity is mainly attributed to photogenerated electrons, which overcome the limitations of a purely thermal system. The in situ generation of oxygen vacancies increases the initial-stage reactivity, where oxygen vacancies act as electron traps to accelerate charge separation and promote the adsorption/activation of reactants. The 0.5Ni/La2O3 catalyst exhibits strong inhibition of carbon coking and is sintering resistant, benefiting from the synergy between in situ oxygen vacancies and isolated nickel atoms.

Abstract: Summary
Flexible self-powered sensors are attracting increasing research interest with the emergence and rapid development of the Internet of Things. However, inefficient power supplies and difficulties in device assembly have largely limited their applications. Here, we report an integrated gas-sensing system using a single-walled carbon nanotube film with good flexibility and large surface area to detect a target gas. A single-walled carbon nanotube/silicon heterojunction solar cell capable of stably providing a voltage of ∼0.5 V under the illumination of a standard solar intensity powers the sensor. Our self-powered sensing system shows an ideal rectangle-shaped nitrogen dioxide detection curve and demonstrates higher sensitivity and faster response time than one driven by external power at room temperature. We attribute this better activity to the increased carrier concentration originating from single-walled carbon nanotubes in both sensing and powering components. Finally, wireless communication between the system and a phone is demonstrated with a Bluetooth Low Energy module.

Abstract: Summary
The ever-increasing ground-level ozone pollution threatens the health of both humans and ecosystems. Two-phase catalysts can achieve rapid ozone decomposition at room temperature, yet most show moisture-deactivated performance. Herein, we build a three-phase (gas-liquid-solid) electrocatalytic system for ozone decomposition at the three-phase interface. Almost 100% of ozone decomposition over the entire humidity range (3.1%–92.1% relative humidity) is achieved with no interference from moisture. Amphiphilic carbon cloth as a cathode provides the three-phase interface, promoting ozone diffusion and strengthening the electrochemical reactions. Nitric acid as an electrolyte is also indispensable. It not only suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction but also generates reducing species, such as ammonia, via the nitrate reduction reaction. Enriched ammonia concentrations at the three-phase interface rapidly reacts with ozone, accelerating its depletion. This work provides a strategy for the development of a moisture-resistant ozone decomposition system and expands on current state-of-the-art ozone decomposition techniques.

Abstract: Summary
Solid-adsorbent-based temperature swing adsorption (TSA) technology is intriguing in CO2 capture, and the predominant energy consumption lies in the temperature swing process. Inspired by the self-regulation of lizards, here, we design a solar-radiation-induced adsorption/desorption system, avoiding additional energy supply for the temperature swing process. In this system, adsorbents filled in a reversible quartz device are covered by radiative cooling coating. With the demand of adsorption and desorption, the temperature of adsorbents can be regulated by radiative cooling and solar heating, respectively. Adsorption tests for over 1 year using the metal-organic framework HKUST-1 as an adsorbent demonstrate that the CO2 working capacity of our system is higher than most industrial TSA with various adsorbents. Furthermore, our system can save more than 80% of the energy input for industrial TSA technologies.

Abstract: Summary
Structural stabilization of enzymes by porous frameworks is an emerging strategy in biotechnology that may accelerate large-scale industrial application of biocatalysts. Herein, we stabilize an enzyme by wrapping it with covalent organic frameworks in situ using a mild mechanochemistry-guided assembly. This mechanochemical strategy circumvents the harsh conditions often necessary for covalent organic frameworks’ crystallization, and hence avoids enzyme denaturation during the de novo encapsulation. The covalent-linked topology and tailorable large pore channels of the covalent organic framework host not only stabilize enzymes, but also outperform the well-explored enzyme-zeolite imidazole framework counterparts in terms of catalytic efficiency, functional diversity, and structural stability. This work offers a greener and convenient mechanochemistry-guided assembly strategy, enabling template-free enzyme encapsulation across multiple enzyme and covalent organic framework pore structures.

Abstract: Summary
2′3′-cyclic GMP-AMP (2′3′-cGAMP), generated by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) under activation by cytosolic DNA, has a vital role in innate immune response via its receptor protein stimulator of interferon genes (STING) to fight viral infections and tumors. In order to have a complete understanding of biological functions of 2′3′-cGAMP, it is important to find out whether 2′3′-cGAMP has other unrevealed binding proteins present in mammalian cells and executes unknown functions. Here we report the 2′3′-cGAMP-based photoaffinity probes that capture and isolate 2′3′-cGAMP-binding proteins. These probes enable the identification of some potential 2′3′-cGAMP-binding proteins from HeLa cells. EF1A1, an essential protein regulating protein synthesis, is further validated to associate with 2′3′-cGAMP in vitro and in cells to impede protein synthesis. Thus, our studies provide a powerful approach to enable identification of the 2′3′-cGAMP interactome, discover unknown functions of 2′3′-cGAMP, and understand its physiological/pathological roles in tumor immunity and immune-related diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The availability of MXenes and other two-dimensional conductive nanomaterials with tunable surface chemistry has reshaped the field of electromagnetic protection. However, the high electrical conductivity and low dielectric loss of titanium-based MXenes lead to strong reflection of electromagnetic waves, even when combined with polymers to form composites. Here, we report on the ability of vanadium-based MXenes to provide broadband microwave absorption. Polyurethane composites with ∼2 wt % Vn+1CnTx can absorb 90% of electromagnetic waves covering the entire X band. In addition, pure Vn+1CnTx films of submicrometer thickness can provide effective electromagnetic interference shielding. The free electron transport, surface terminations, native defects, and layers arrangement in composites have profound effects on electronic and dielectric properties of Vn+1CnTx MXenes. This study points toward a new frontier for development of thin and highly absorbing MXene-based electromagnetic protection materials.

Abstract: Summary
There are many efficient ways to connect proteins at termini. However, connecting at a loop is difficult because of lower flexibility and variable environment. Here, we have developed DogCatcher, a protein that forms a spontaneous isopeptide bond with DogTag peptide. DogTag/DogCatcher was generated initially by splitting a Streptococcus pneumoniae adhesin. We optimized DogTag/DogCatcher through rational design and evolution, increasing reaction rate by 250-fold and establishing millimolar solubility of DogCatcher. When fused to a protein terminus, DogTag/DogCatcher reacts slower than SpyTag003/SpyCatcher003. However, inserted in loops of a fluorescent protein or enzyme, DogTag reacts much faster than SpyTag003. Like many membrane proteins, the ion channel TRPC5 has no surface-exposed termini. DogTag in a TRPC5 extracellular loop allowed normal calcium flux and specific covalent labeling on cells in 1 min. DogTag/DogCatcher reacts under diverse conditions, at nanomolar concentrations, and to 98% conversion. Loop-friendly ligation should expand the toolbox for creating protein architectures.

Abstract: Summary
Small RNAs (sRNAs) have emerged as attractive therapeutic agents due to their gene-editing and -regulatory properties. However, their application is severely limited by their relatively short circulation half-lives. Herein, we report a strategy binding sRNA with metalloporphyrin cages that leads to a significant protection of sRNA against RNase degradation and increased half-lives. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) titration of nucleosides and nucleotides demonstrates that π-stacking and electrostatic interactions contribute to the sRNA binding, which occurs on the external surface of the nanocage. Moreover, the cage binding promotes sRNA internalization, and the sRNAs maintain genetic activity after release in an acidic intracellular environment. Taking advantage of the photodynamic properties of the cage, the nanosystem shows efficient in vitro cell killing through gene regulation and photodynamic effects, providing evidence for its therapeutic potential in breast cancer treatment. We envision the proposed strategy may provide new insight for the development of organometallic cage-based sRNA delivery vehicles.

Abstract: Summary
Green hydrogen production from water electrolysis typically requires a set of two catalysts for triggering both hydrogen and oxygen production. Here, we report cerium-doped α-Bi2O3 nanosheets covered with reduced graphene oxide capable of both electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction in the same alkaline media. This rationally designed material achieves oxygen evolution and hydrogen production current density of 10 mA cm−2 at relatively low overpotentials of 0.245 and 0.334 V, respectively, while retaining its reactivity over 24 h with minimal loss of Faradaic efficiency. A two-electrode setup is devised by immobilizing this robust and dual-active electrocatalyst on commercially available stainless steel (SS) mesh, which operates at a relatively low cell voltage (1.78 V). The electrocatalytic reactivity remains intact even after cross-polarization. Hence this Janus catalytic material may be an apt choice for developing an economical, efficient, eco-friendly alkaline water electrolyzer.

Abstract: Summary
Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2) is a cell surface receptor on macrophages and microglia that senses and responds to disease-associated signals to regulate the phenotype of these innate immune cells. The TREM2 signaling pathway has been implicated in a variety of diseases ranging from neurodegeneration in the central nervous system to metabolic disease in the periphery. Here, we report that TREM2 is a thyroid hormone-regulated gene and its expression in macrophages and microglia is stimulated by thyroid hormone and synthetic thyroid hormone agonists (thyromimetics). Our findings report the endocrine regulation of TREM2 by thyroid hormone, and provide a unique opportunity to drug the TREM2 signaling pathway with orally active small-molecule therapeutic agents.

Abstract: Summary
Mechercharmycin A (MCM-A) is a marine natural product belonging to a family of polyazole cyclopeptides with remarkable bioactivities and unique structures. Identification, heterologous expression, and genetic characterizations of the MCM biosynthetic gene cluster in Bacillus subtilis revealed that it is a ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) possessing complex with distinctive modifications. Based on this heterologous expression system, two MCM analogs with comparable antitumor activity are generated by engineering the biosynthetic pathway. Combinatorial co-production of a precursor peptide with different modifying enzymes in Escherichia coli identifies a different timing of modifications, showing that a tRNAGlu-dependent highly regioselective dehydration is the first modification step, followed by polyazole formation through heterocyclization and dehydrogenation in an N- to C-terminal direction. Therefore, a rational biosynthetic pathway of MCMs is proposed, which unveils a subfamily of azol(in)e-containing RiPPs and sets the stage for further investigations of the enzymatic mechanism and synthetic biology.

Abstract: Summary
Crystalline materials have shown great potential for lithium-metal batteries. However, crystalline materials are prone to uncontrollable growth of lithium dendrites due to their anisotropic characteristics. Herein, we break the structural anisotropy of zinc oxide as an amorphous host to efficiently induce a uniform lithium deposition. Theoretical calculations first confirm that amorphous ZnO presents a much larger lithium adsorption energy. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) studies reveal that amorphous zinc oxide possesses both numerous “floppy” bonds and multiple vacancies, resulting in not only an increase in lithiophilic sites but also a more uniform distribution of the electric field. As a result, amorphous zinc oxide delivers an improved Coulomb efficiency of 98.2% even after 500 cycles at 1 mA cm−2 and an ultra-long cycling lifespan over 2,500 h in symmetric cells, outperforming most representative and state-of-the-art lithium-metal anodes. This work opens a new pathway to exploring amorphous materials for lithium-metal batteries.

Abstract: Summary
Natural materials such as nacre abalone shells are often leveraged for inspiration in developing high-performing materials for impact protection applications. However, a comprehensive understanding of the microstructure-property relationships and their corresponding damage mechanisms in bioinspired designs under high-speed impact has not yet been fully studied. In this paper, the mechanism of the high-speed impact performance of nacre-inspired microstructures is presented, considering a set of design parameters using high-throughput computational simulations. Results show that adding interfacial waviness to traditional nacre designs enlarges the damage area, and an inclined interface helps to effectively block the crack and stress wave propagation, leading to superior impact performance. Moreover, an asymmetric microstructure tends to rotate an impactor, causing it to travel a longer path yielding larger energy dissipation. It is envisioned that pinpointing the superior features embedded in nacre-like structures can provide unique design guidelines for next-generation impact-resistant materials.

Abstract: Summary
Conversion-alloying anodes possess high theoretical capacity but suffer from serious phase agglomeration-induced fast capacity fading during cycling. Here, we report that multiple intercross lithiation steps integrated into a p-block bimetal oxide anode can achieve long life and high volumetric capacity behavior. Rationally designed Bi2Sn2O7, which is composed of two interpenetrating Bi−O and Sn−O networks, undergoes intercross four-step reduction-alloying reactions and constructs a mutually buffered anti-coarsening microstructure. The intermixed atom configuration of Bi2Sn2O7 establishes three-dimensional (3D) electronic conductive networks, which improve the atomic diffusion barriers for each atom and lower the tendency of phase migration aggregation. Carbon-free Bi2Sn2O7 with a superior tap density of 2.2 g cm−3 shows an exceptionally high volumetric capacity of 1,955 mA h cm−3 at 2 A g−1 (approaching the theoretical value of Li metal) and cycled for 500 cycles without decay. This atom immobilization strategy may offer new perspectives for next-generation conversion-alloying-type lithium-ion battery anodes.

Abstract: Summary
G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent the largest family of drug targets. Upon activation, GPCRs signal primarily via a diverse set of heterotrimeric G proteins. Most GPCRs can couple to several different G protein subtypes. However, how drugs act at GPCRs contributing to the selectivity of G protein recognition is poorly understood. Here, we examined the G protein selectivity profile of the dopamine D2 receptor (D2), a GPCR targeted by antipsychotic drugs. We show that D2 discriminates between six individual members of the Gi/o family, and its profile of functional selectivity is remarkably different across its ligands, which all engaged D2 with a distinct G protein coupling pattern. Using structural modeling, receptor mutagenesis, and pharmacological evaluation, we identified residues in the D2 binding pocket that shape these ligand-directed biases. We further provide pharmacogenomic evidence that natural variants in D2 differentially affect its G protein biases in response to different ligands.

Abstract: Summary
Lithium-sulfur batteries are compelling candidates for overcoming the resource and sustainability limitations of current batteries. Regulating complex polysulfide chemistry is a critical challenge in achieving a practical lithium-sulfur battery with high cycle life and minimal electrolyte weight. Drawing inspiration from cell biology, here we propose the concept of bespoke membranes for making practical lithium-sulfur batteries. The membrane devised herein utilizes conductive reduced graphene oxide as a brick-like framework, with an elastic polymer liquid—rich in ion hopping and lithiophilic sites—as the mortar. The membrane mimics cell plasma membranes by integrating rapid and permselective Li+ channels alongside catalytic electrochemical reactions. Employing our reactive permselective membranes, we attain areal capacities of 4.8–8.1 mAh cm−2 with 450 stable cycles in coin cells and 202 Wh kg−1 with over 100 stable cycles in pouch cells. This behavior is achieved with efficient electrolyte/capacity ratios (4.9–5.3 μL mAh−1).

Abstract: Summary
All-carbon quaternary centers are ubiquitous structural motifs in natural products, bioactive molecules, and pharmaceuticals. The formation of these crowded carbon centers is well known to be challenging, and methods to access them remain in high demand. Transition-metal-based strategies have emerged as a powerful approach to quaternary carbons, primarily relying on cross-coupling reactions and olefin arylation processes. Herein is presented a straightforward method to create benzylic all-carbon quaternary centers employing gem-difluoroallenes. Features of this method include room temperature C–H functionalization, excellent regioselectivity in the insertion of gem-difluoroallenes, and generation of gem-difluoroalkene products, which have widespread applications in synthesis and pharmaceutical sciences. Mechanistic studies support a turnover limiting rhodium-catalyzed C–H cleavage that likely proceeds via a concerted metalation deprotonation pathway. Regioselective insertion of the gem-difluoroallene is controlled by electronic effects.

Abstract: Summary
To achieve solid-state electrochromic devices, an acceptable compromise is to use polymer electrolyte gels, which combine the merits of liquid and solid electrolytes. However, many drawbacks remain, such as inflammability, a sharp decline in ionic conductivity at zero temperature, and interfacial problems with the electrodes. Here, we introduce a polyacrylamide (PAM)-based hydrogel electrolyte containing a high concentration of zinc ion, which delivers an ionic conductivity of 63.5 mS cm−1 at room temperature and 12.8 mS cm−1 at even −30°C. Based on the PAM-Zn2+ electrolyte, we prepare a quasi-solid WO3/PAM-Zn/Zn energy storage electrochromic bifunctional device by in situ polymerization. The device exhibits excellent cycle performance (retaining 45.1% of optical contrast after 9,200 cycles) and a high areal capacity (278.3 mAh m−2 at 0.1 mA cm−2). Furthermore, larger-sized electrochromic devices also show ultra-long cycle stability and attractive anti-freeze properties. This work provides an idea for the large-scale fabrication of anti-freeze electrochromic devices with remarkable lifetimes.

Abstract: Summary
Construction of core-shell nanostructures with ultrathin shells is a powerful way to leverage the lattice strain effect to enhance surface activity for a given catalytic reaction. Herein, we report a gold-catalyzed approach for growing a large variety of subnanometer-thick metal shells of up to several atomic layers on the gold cores. This strategy relies on a gold-catalyzed reduction of various metal precursors, in both aqueous and organic solvents, in which the metal atoms nucleate on the gold seed surfaces instead of self-nucleating in the solution. In addition, by coupling this gold catalysis with the galvanic replacement reaction, the ultrathin shell composition could be tuned to further optimize the lattice strain effect in the shell layer. This provides an effective way to equip the core-shell nanostructures with the desired catalytic performance in some key electrochemical reactions, for example, the ethanol oxidation reaction and oxygen reduction reaction.

Abstract: Summary
The state-of-the-art microelectromechanical systems (MEMSs) technology faces challenges in meeting the requirements of the next decade regarding improved performance, functionality, and power consumption, which can be addressed by resorting to new actuating materials. Dynamic molecular single crystals have been explored as actuating elements; however, difficulties with control over the geometry and fabrication of these materials has limited their scalability and application. Here, we present dynamic molecular crystals driven by thermosalient phase transitions as alternative materials in MEMSs technology with swift and amplified mechanical response. This work employs a thermally deposited stable polycrystalline thin film of L-pyroglutamic acid to fabricate a prototypical thermosalient organic crystal-MEMS (TS-OC-MEMS). The organic thin film undergoes a reversible and cyclable martensitic phase transition that drives the deformation. The TS-OC-MEMSs provide a reliable and scalable solution to utilize dynamic molecular crystals in robust applications and circumvent the challenges that have long stifled their application as actuating materials.

Abstract: Summary
The design and synthesis of two-dimensional membranes with ultra-high permeability, selectivity, and antifouling properties have been a significant challenge. Herein, we propose a facile approach to design modular polyoxometalate-intercalated layered double hydroxide membranes using a charge-driven self-assembly process. The resultant MgAl-SiW12 membrane shows 4 times higher water permeance (>130 L m−2 h−1 bar−1) than that of its MgAl-NO3 precursor. Excellent retention of >99% for Congo red and Evans blue is achieved by the MgAl-SiW12 membrane, which can be regenerated (permeance recovery > 95%) via a simple UV-vis irradiation cycle. Insertion of the SiW12 cluster into layered double hydroxide allows precise control and modulation of the interlayer’s spacing and hydrophilicity and promotes spontaneous electron migration and interfacial charge carrier separation. Moreover, the ·OH and ·O2− radicals forming during the irradiation process are responsible for the degradation of contaminants.

Abstract: Summary
Potent, specific ligands drive precision medicine and fundamental biology. Proteins, peptides, and small molecules constitute effective ligand classes. Yet greater molecular diversity would aid the pursuit of ligands to elicit precise biological activity against challenging targets. We demonstrate a platform to discover protein-small molecule (PriSM) hybrids to combine unique pharmacophore activities and shapes with constrained, efficiently engineerable proteins. In this platform, a fibronectin protein library is displayed on yeast with a single cysteine coupled to acetazolamide via a maleimide-poly(ethylene glycol) linker. Magnetic and flow cytometric sorts enrich specific binders to carbonic anhydrase isoforms. Isolated PriSMs exhibit potent, specific inhibition of carbonic anhydrase isoforms with efficacy superior to that of acetazolamide or protein alone, including an 80-fold specificity increase and 9-fold potency gain. PriSMs are engineered with multiple linker lengths, protein conjugation sites, and sequences against two different isoforms, which reveal platform flexibility and impacts of molecular designs. PriSMs advance the molecular diversity of efficiently engineerable ligands.

Abstract: Summary
Glucose is the main source of energy for organisms, and it is important to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of intracellular glucose. Single fluorescent protein-based glucose indicators, named “Red Glifons” have been developed that apply to live-cell and dual-color imaging. These indicators exhibited more than 3-fold increase in fluorescence intensity in the presence of 10 mM glucose. The two Red Glifons developed have different half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) values for glucose (300 μM and 3,000 μM) and are able to monitor a wide range of glucose dynamics. Red Glifon combined with green indicators allowing visualization of the interplay between glucose and ATP, lactate, or pyruvate. Glucose influx in the pharyngeal muscle of Caenorhabditis elegans, enteroendocrine cells, and human iPS cell-derived cardiac myocytes was observed using the Red Glifons. Thus these red glucose indicators serve as a multi-color imaging toolkit for investigating complex interactions in energy metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Cells are often connected in parallel to achieve the required energy capacity of large-scale battery systems. However, the current on each branch could exhibit oscillation, thus causing concerns about current runaway or even system divergence. Here, we demonstrate that oscillation is self-excited even under a constant load owing to the inherent nonlinearity of the parallel configuration. By adopting a phase-plane method, we find that the currents of cells connected in parallel are at no risk of running away, and their trajectories approach a stable closed orbit in the phase-plane portrait after numerous repeated cycles of charging and discharging. This finding indicates that the parallel configuration is convergent and therefore safe, stable and therefore controllable, and initial-state independent and therefore robust.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear receptor binding SET domain protein 3 (NSD3), a gene located within the 8p11-p12 amplicon frequently detected in human cancers, encodes a chromatin modulator and an attractive onco-target. However, agents that effectively suppress NSD3-mediated oncogenic actions are currently lacking. We report the NSD3-targeting proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC), MS9715, which achieves effective and specific targeting of NSD3 and associated cMyc node in tumor cells. MS9715 is designed by linking BI-9321, a NSD3 antagonist, which binds NSD3’s PWWP1 domain, with an E3 ligase VHL ligand. Importantly, MS9715, but not BI-9321, effectively suppresses growth of NSD3-dependent hematological cancer cells. Transcriptomic profiling demonstrates that MS9715, but not BI-9321, effectively suppresses NSD3-and cMyc-associated gene expression programs, resembling effects of the CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of NSD3. Collectively, these results suggest that pharmacological degradation of NSD3 as an attractive therapeutic strategy, which co-suppresses NSD3- and cMyc-related oncogenic nodes, is superior to blocking the PWWP1 domain of NSD3.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria, the powerhouse of the cell, are dynamic organelles that undergo constant morphological changes. Increasing evidence indicates that mitochondria morphologies and functions can be modulated by mechanical cues. However, the mechano-sensing and -responding properties of mitochondria and the relation between mitochondrial morphologies and functions are unclear due to the lack of methods to precisely exert mechano-stimulation on and deform mitochondria inside live cells. Here, we present an optogenetic approach that uses light to induce deformation of mitochondria by recruiting molecular motors to the outer mitochondrial membrane via light-activated protein-protein hetero-dimerization. Mechanical forces generated by motor proteins distort the outer membrane, during which the inner mitochondrial membrane can also be deformed. Moreover, this optical method can achieve subcellular spatial precision and be combined with different optical dimerizers and molecular motors. This method presents a mitochondria-specific mechano-stimulator for studying mitochondria mechanobiology and the interplay between mitochondria shapes and functions.

Abstract: Summary
Near-infrared light-emitting diodes (NIR-LEDs) are widely used in night vision, sensors, medicine, security, telecommunications, and military applications. Methyl-ammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) is a promising material for realizing high-performance NIR-LEDs because of its high color purity, low non-radiative recombination rates, and tunable band gap. However, the development of MAPbI3-based NIR-LEDs is hindered predominantly by poor film quality and increased defect states, limiting potential industrial applications. Here, we modify the interface of perovskite films with phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) to resolve these issues. The preheated MAPbI3 films are post-treated with PEAI solution, resulting in high film quality, full coverage, and dense MAPbI3 film. Incorporating lithium fluoride as an interfacial layer and CN-T2T as an electron transport layer, perovskite NIR-LEDs are demonstrated with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 18.74%. The high EQE of the devices is investigated by electrical, optical, and physical analyses. The result shows the potential to develop efficient NIR perovskite LEDs for practical applications.

Abstract: Summary
Windows are important for indoor lighting, cooling, and heating regulation to provide comfortable living for the occupants. However, traditional windows require excessive energy consumption due to uncontrollable light and heat conduction. Herein, to overcome these issues, all-weather smart windows (SWs) with semi-transparent symmetric supercapacitors (SSCs) based on transparent conductive polymer poly(3,4- ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS) are fabricated. The resulting windows show excellent near-infrared (NIR) light modulation and high visible-light transmittance. They display electrochemical performances with long lives of 10,000 cycles, coupled with satisfactory thermal insulation and a wide operating temperature range of −20°C to 40°C. The prepared flexible SWs exhibit robust mechanical properties, suitable for pasting on existing building windows. Energy savings and emission reductions with implementation of the SWs in typical locations under various climate zones in China and around the world are simulated.

Abstract: Summary
Prediction of enzymatic stereochemistry is a significant challenge in computational chemistry because of targeting very small energy gaps in highly complicated macromolecular systems. Here, we report a scenario of four substrates (2-pentanone, 2-hexanone, 2-heptanone, and 2-octanone) within four enzyme variants (wild type, W116A, F285A, and W286A) of a medium-chain dehydrogenase from Candida parapsilopsis. The relative stabilities of pro-R and pro-S pre-reaction states are calculated by umbrella sampling, approximately consistent with the observed stereoselectivity in experiment. Besides, a LASSO-SVM machine-learning model is constructed with structural information of 704 pairs of quantum-mechanistic/molecular-mechanistic transition states (TSs) and pre-reaction states (PRSs), achieving the explanatory power of 99.6% for the calculated barriers. Intriguingly, the explanatory power with the PRS-alone structural information reaches 90.7%, but it decreases to 55.4% with the TS-alone structural information. Thus, the outcomes support that the enzymatic stereoselectivity is substantially determined by the frontier-molecular-orbital-related pre-organization of the enzyme-substrate reacting complexes.

Abstract: Summary
Spent catalysts are valuable secondary resources of precious metals. Traditional methods of recovering precious metals typically use highly corrosive aqua regia, which is extremely dangerous and leads to severe environmental pollution. Here, we report an alternative route to recover precious metals from spent catalysts using purely inorganic salt solutions consisting of Al(NO3)3·9H2O and NaCl, which we name “salt aqua regia.” The precious metals palladium and gold can be completely dissolved in it. In simulated and real recovery processes, high-purity palladium and gold products are obtained through leaching and one-step electrodeposition. The solvent keeps almost the same dissolution properties and electrochemical stability even after three cycles. As salt aqua regia is safe and non-volatile and has good solubility for precious metals and electrochemical stability, it has excellent prospects for application in precious metals recovery.

Abstract: Summary
Fabrication of freestanding nanostructured aerogel monoliths with multifunctionality on a large scale represents a great challenge due to the limited scalable methods for synthesis and assembly of multi-component nanostructures into one single gel body. Here, we report a scalable solvothermal-based in situ gelation method for synthesizing mechanically stable cobalt-based layered inorganic-organic hybrid nanobelt (Co-LIOHN) aerogel monoliths with a density as low as 2.8 mg/cm3, an ultralow thermal conductivity of 25 mW/(mK), and extraordinary adsorption capacities of 51–145 g/g for various solvents. Moreover, the aerogel exhibits reversible thermochromic behavior originating from the changing of the coordination environment of the Co2+ caused by the loss and uptake of coordinating molecular water upon heating and cooling. The Co-LIOHN aerogels integrate unique features of the aerogel and intrinsic properties of the hybrid nanobelts, giving access to a truly multifunctional material that has great potential for applications in thermal insulation, environmental remediation, sensing, and camouflage.

Abstract: Summary
Synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA) is an emerging therapeutic platform with important applications in oncology and infectious disease. Effective mRNA medicines must be translated by the ribosome but not trigger a strong nucleic acid-mediated immune response. To expand the medicinal chemistry toolbox for these agents, here we report the properties of the naturally occurring nucleobase N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C) in synthetic mRNAs. We find that ac4C is compatible with, but does not enhance, protein production in the context of synthetic mRNA reporters. However, replacement of cytidine with ac4C diminishes inflammatory gene expression in immune cells caused by synthetic mRNAs. Chemoproteomic capture indicates that ac4C alters the protein interactome of synthetic mRNAs, reducing binding to cytidine-binding proteins and an immune sensor. Overall, our studies illustrate the unique ability of ac4C to modulate RNA-protein interactions and provide a foundation for using N4-cytidine acylation to fine-tune the properties of nucleic acid therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
Electrochromic devices (ECDs) as smart windows can modulate transmittance of sunlight under an electric potential. There is significant research interest in applying the design principles of ECDs to flexible systems. Herein, we report a smart, self-powered, flexible electrochromic system with self-regulating features and state-of-the-art stability and flexibility. The flexible ECD (FECD) system is composed of Ag@Au core-shell nanowires as flexible transparent electrodes, ethyl viologen as chromophore, and commercial solar cells. The FECDs exhibit high optical contrast (40.3% at 605 nm), cyclic stability, flexibility, and energy-storage performance (6.02 mF/cm2), which are superior to those of the FECD using indium tin oxide (ITO) as electrodes. Furthermore, when connected with a commercial solar cell, the obtained electrochromic system can adjust the transmittance with the sunlight intensity in real time, demonstrating potential as a smart curtain for saving energy and improving living experience.

Abstract: Summary
The integration of photovoltaic (PV) technology in urban environments poses new challenges for the design of PV modules. In particular, the poor shading tolerance of conventional PV modules strongly limits the energy performance of urban PV systems. In this work, we analyze how interdigitated back-contact solar cells with low-breakdown voltages can help improve the shading tolerance of PV modules. Through detailed simulations, we show that the breakdown voltage can be tuned without significantly degrading the efficiency of the solar cell. Simulation results indicate that, under partial shading conditions, cells with a 0.3-V breakdown voltage could boost by 20% the annual yield of conventional crystalline silicon PV modules with three bypass diodes. These findings are supported by a four-month-long monitoring campaign of PV modules with different breakdown characteristics, which shows a specific yield gain of about 4% in PV modules with six bypass diodes.

Abstract: Summary
Circularly polarized organic light-emitting diodes (CP-OLEDs) have attracted increasing interest for their advantages in generating circularly polarized light directly and efficiently. To date, chiral luminescent materials with different emission mechanisms have been investigated as emitters in CP-OLEDs, but it is difficult to achieve a high luminescence dissymmetry factor (g) and high efficiency simultaneously. Herein, chiral luminescent europium(II) complexes with d-f transition characteristics are synthesized and used as emitters in CP-OLEDs. The europium(II) complexes show a maximum g value of 6.6 × 10−3 in doped films, and the corresponding CP-OLEDs show a maximum external quantum efficiency up to 15.6%. The performance is attributed to the unique europium(II) complex with a d-f transition mechanism, which results in a theoretically high magnetic transition dipole moment and high exciton utilization efficiency. This study focusing on chiral d-f transition-containing lanthanide complexes opens up an avenue to future exploration of high-performance chiroptical materials.

Abstract: Summary
Producing high-performance and inexpensive non-fullerene acceptors is a great challenge in the field of organic photovoltaics. Herein, three non-fused ring electron acceptors (NFREAs), TT-O-2F, TT-S-2F, and TT-Se-2F, have been designed and can be modularly synthesized with a few high-productivity steps. According to our results, TT-S-2F and TT-Se-2F have planar molecular backbones because of the existence of S⋅⋅⋅O and Se⋅⋅⋅O intramolecular non-covalent interactions, whereas TT-O-2F has a twisted molecular backbone. In particular, TT-S-2F exhibits the largest terminal group overlapping area and exciton diffusion length among these acceptors, which could facilitate charge transport. The devices based on TT-S-2F can generate an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.29%, much higher than TT-O-2F (10.43%) and TT-Se-2F (12.23%), which are also among the highest PCEs based on NFREAs. Our work highlights the importance of well-controlled terminal packing in designing high-performance NFREAs.

Abstract: Summary
PARP inhibitors (PARPis) display single-agent anticancer activity in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and other neuroendocrine tumors independent of BRCA1/2 mutations. Here, we determine the differential efficacy of multiple clinical PARPis in SCLC cells. Compared with the other PARPis rucaparib, olaparib, and niraparib, talazoparib displays the highest potency across SCLC, including SLFN11-negative cells. Chemical proteomics identifies PARP16 as a unique talazoparib target in addition to PARP1. Silencing PARP16 significantly reduces cell survival, particularly in combination with PARP1 inhibition. Drug combination screening reveals talazoparib synergy with the WEE1/PLK1 inhibitor adavosertib. Global phosphoproteomics identifies disparate effects on cell-cycle and DNA damage signaling thereby illustrating underlying mechanisms of synergy, which is more pronounced for talazoparib than olaparib. Notably, silencing PARP16 further reduces cell survival in combination with olaparib and adavosertib. Together, these data suggest that PARP16 contributes to talazoparib's overall mechanism of action and constitutes an actionable target in SCLC.

Wide-band-gap perovskite solar cells are a good spectral match to indoor lighting and have the potential for high-efficiency indoor energy harvesting. A perovskite-charged battery is shown to operate at both one-sun and indoor lighting conditions with high efficiency. We demonstrate energy harvesting and storage from 300 lux to AM1.5G illumination realized using wide-band-gap lead halide perovskite (CH3NH3Pb(I0.8Br0.2)3) modules directly coupled to a high-rate-capable sodium-ion battery (NaTi2(PO4)2@CNF/1M NaPF6 in diglyme/Na) without power electronics. We show a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 43.9% for perovskite solar modules under high-intensity LED illumination (24.5 mWcm−2), 31% PCE under 500 lux light-emitting diode (LED) illumination, and an overall efficiency of 26.4%. The present setup could form the foundation of future indoor light-harvesting solutions for internet-of-things devices and sensors.

Abstract: Summary
The identification and validation of a small molecule’s targets is a major bottleneck in the discovery process for tuberculosis antibiotics. Activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) is an efficient tool for determining a small molecule’s targets within complex proteomes. However, how target inhibition relates to biological activity is often left unexplored. Here, we study the effects of 1,2,3-triazole ureas on Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). After screening ∼200 compounds, we focus on 4 compounds that form a structure-activity series. The compound with negligible activity reveals targets, the inhibition of which is functionally less relevant for Mtb growth and viability, an aspect not addressed in other ABPP studies. Biochemistry, computational docking, and morphological analysis confirms that active compounds preferentially inhibit serine hydrolases with cell wall and lipid metabolism functions and that disruption of the cell wall underlies biological activity. Our findings show that ABPP identifies the targets most likely relevant to a compound's antibacterial activity.

Abstract: Summary
The market-dominating material BaTiO3 is highly crucial in advanced electronics and electric power systems owing to its fast charging/discharging speed and superior cycle life. However, the low energy storage efficiency and breakdown strength hinder further device miniaturization for energy storage applications. Herein, we design a high configurational entropy (HCE) material BaTiO3-BiFeO3-CaTiO3 with rational microstructural engineering that demonstrates an ultrahigh energy density of 7.2 J cm−3. The HCE design leads to the increased solubility of CaTiO3 in the matrix, which enhances the resistivity and polarization. Simultaneously, the nano-segregations around the grains can enhance the breakdown strength obviously due to strongly scattering of electron carriers and impeding of electrical breakdown pathways. Furthermore, the multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) using such dielectrics were constructed with energy density of 16.6 J cm−3 and efficiency of 83%. This work offers a route to explore new dielectric materials that are expected to benefit dielectric devices' compactness and high performance.

Abstract: Summary
Traditionally, photodetectors are based on solid materials composed of P-N junctions, which require delicate growth technologies. In this article, we demonstrate the feasibility of a polarized-liquid-triggered photodetector where the liquid is sandwiched between P- and N-type semiconductors. Under multiple cycles of optical switching, a transient photopolarized current, a steady-state photopolarized current, and a depolarized current are repeatably observed in a semiconductor/polar liquid/semiconductor structure. The responsivity and specific detectivity of the transient photopolarized current in N-GaN/W/P-GaN reaches 104.2 mA/W and 4.4 × 1012 Jones at 365 nm, 52.8 mA/W, and 1.9 × 1012 Jones at 254 nm illumination under zero bias voltage. We anticipate that our research may be useful for integrating self-powered photodetectors with freely selectable wavelength bands.

The symbiosis is biphasic and concludes in a parasitic phase, during which the bacteria release algaecidal metabolites in response to algal p-coumaric acid (pCA). The cell-wide effects of pCA on P. inhibens remain unknown. Herein, we report a microarray-based transcriptomic study and find that genes related to the oxidative stress response and secondary metabolism are upregulated most, while those associated with energy production and motility are downregulated in the presence of pCA. Among genes upregulated is a previously unannotated biosynthetic gene cluster and, using a combination of gene deletions and metabolic profiling, we show that it gives rise to an unreported siderophore, roseobactin. The simultaneous production of algaecides and roseobactin in the parasitic phase allows the bacteria to take up any iron that is released from dying algal cells, thereby securing a limited micronutrient.

Abstract: Summary
Targeting the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human ACE2, its primary cell membrane receptor, is a promising therapeutic strategy to prevent viral entry. Recent in vitro studies revealed that the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein plays a prominent role in ACE2 binding, yet a simple and quantitative assay for monitoring this interaction in a cellular environment is lacking. Here, we developed an RBD-ACE2 binding assay that is based on time-resolved FRET, which reliably monitors the interaction in a physiologically relevant and cellular context. Because it is modular, the assay can monitor the impact of different cellular components, such as heparan sulfate, lipids, and membrane proteins on the RBD-ACE2 interaction and it can be extended to the full-length spike protein. The assay is HTS compatible and can detect small-molecule competitive and allosteric modulators of the RBD-ACE2 interaction with high relevance for SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
Second-harmonic generation (SHG) plays a key role in developing modern optical devices and quantum optics, as they can expand the wavelength range provided by common laser sources. Conventionally, the modulation of SHG in nonlinear optical (NLO) materials heavily depends on various external effects. In this article, by developing the basic rules that comprise the interplay between defects and the SHG effect, we propose an alternative strategy to intrinsically regulate the SHG of NLO materials via defect engineering, which is feasible via controlling the growth conditions. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the SHG susceptibility of KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF), the only available deep-ultraviolet NLO material with a weak SHG effect, can be dramatically enhanced by nearly one order of magnitude under specific growth conditions. This is comparable to many other famous narrow-band gap NLO crystals. In general, our developed basic rules and material demonstration could be extended to other NLO systems.

Abstract: Summary
Considering the potential of combinatorial therapies in overcoming existing limitations of cancer immunotherapy, there is an increasing need to identify small-molecule modulators of immune cells capable of augmenting the effect of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade, leading to better cancer treatment. Although epigenetic drugs showed potential in combination therapy, the lack of sequence specificity is a major concern. Here, we identify and develop a DNA-based epigenetic activator with tri-arginine vector called EnPGC-1 that can trigger the targeted induction of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 alpha/beta (PGC-1α/β), a regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. EnPGC-1 enhances mitochondrial activation, energy metabolism, proliferation of CD8+ T cells in vitro, and, in particular, enhances oxidative phosphorylation, a feature of long-lived memory T cells. Genome-wide gene analysis suggests that EnPGC-1 and not the control compounds can regulate T cell activation as a major biological process. EnPGC-1 also synergizes with PD-1 blockade to enhance antitumor immunity and improved host survival.

Abstract: Summary
Embedding the capability of self-sensing to polymeric materials provides tremendous opportunities for developing smart materials with highly important applications. However, a facile method that can introduce this capability to different polymers beyond strain sensing remains elusive. Here, we report a strategy of incorporating a continuous graphene sheet as an electric probe into polymer matrices for developing self-sensing composites. The resulted composite demonstrates impressively high conductivities of 290 S/m at a graphene volume fraction (VG) of 0.00068, a good electrical recovery at a cyclic elastic strain of 30% and a strain-sensing upper limit of 80%. Moreover, the glass transition, melting, and photodegradation process of different polymers can also be monitored in situ, and the corresponding glass transition temperature (Tg) and melting point (Tm) can be calculated. Our work paves the way for the development and application of novel self-sensing polymer composites with high sensitivity and versatility based on two-dimensional (2D) materials.

Abstract: Summary
The competition between recombination and extraction of carriers defines the charge collection efficiency and, therefore, the overall performance of organic photovoltaic devices, including solar cells and photodetectors. In this work, we describe different components of the steady-state light intensity-dependent photocurrent (IPC) and charge collection efficiency under operational conditions. Further, we demonstrate how different loss mechanisms can be identified based on their unique signatures in the IPC. In particular, we show how IPC can be used to distinguish first-order, trap-assisted recombination from other first-order photocurrent loss mechanisms, which dominate at the low-intensity characteristic of indoor light-harvesting applications. The theoretical framework is presented and verified by a one-dimensional drift-diffusion device model. Finally, the extended IPC methodology is validated on organic thin-film photovoltaic devices. We conclude that the relatively straightforward measurement of IPC over a large dynamic range can be a powerful tool for understanding solar and indoor device fundamentals.

Abstract: Summary
N-glycans are displayed on cell-surface proteins and can engage in direct binding interactions with membrane-bound and secreted glycan-binding proteins (GBPs). Biochemical identification and characterization of glycan-mediated interactions is often made difficult by low binding affinities. Here we describe the metabolic introduction of a diazirine photo-cross-linker onto N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues of N-linked glycoproteins on cell surfaces. We characterize sites at which diazirine-modified GlcNAc is incorporated, as well as modest perturbations to glycan structure. We show that diazirine-modified GlcNAc can be used to covalently cross-link two extracellular GBPs, galectin-1 and cholera toxin subunit B, to cell-surface N-linked glycoproteins. The extent of cross-linking correlates with display of the preferred glycan ligands for the GBPs. In addition, covalently cross-linked complexes could be isolated, and protein components of cross-linked N-linked glycoproteins were identified by proteomics analysis. This method may be useful in the discovery and characterization of binding interactions that depend on N-glycans.

Abstract: Summary
Designing covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with predetermined structures for uranium capture is vital for energy and the environment, but it remains challenging for complex COFs, which are expected to produce various structures, due to lacking quantum-mechanics-based design principles. Here, we report the COFs’ design principles based on intramolecular interactions to precisely control their structures and properties, toward high-performance uranium sorbents. We investigate the structure-directing effect of intramolecular interactions in hydroxyl-group-functionalized COFs by experiments and density functional theory (DFT) studies. The atomic arrangements of COFs are determined by the competition among conjugation, aromaticity, hydrogen bonding, and steric effect. Controlling the number of hydroxyl groups can adjust their correlation and competition. Subsequently, optimal uranium adsorption performance of hydroxyl-group-functionalized COFs is achieved through structural optimization. This study demonstrates that modulating intramolecular interactions is a viable approach to precisely controlling the structure and properties of complex COFs for special applications.

Abstract: Summary
Owing to their unique one-dimensional hollow structures, organic nanotubes have been widely explored in recent years. Covalent organic nanotubes (CONs) can be prepared by stacking building blocks, such as macrocycles, through covalent linkages. However, because of the mismatched covalent connections, controllable synthesis of the discrete CONs with clear structures, such as sidewall and chirality, is a challenging target. In this work, by coupling two pillar[5]arenes through dynamic covalent bonds, thermodynamically stable discrete CONs with 5-fold symmetry are successfully prepared. Three different chiral CONs are separated, including homo-CONs, consisting of two enantiomers (pR, pR and pS, pS), and hetero-CON, consisting of the meso form (pR, pS). These CONs show negative allosteric binding affinities toward guest molecules, which are not observed in individual pillar[5]arenes.

Abstract: Summary
Friction and wear are ubiquitous in moving mechanical assemblies, causing energy and equipment loss and producing harmful emissions. Mitigation efforts have long relied on oil-based lubricants, but challenges remain in achieving concurrent ultralow friction and wear without oil additives. Here, we demonstrate that a dual-phase TiB2-MoS2 film lubricated by oil without additives exhibits superdurable superlubricity characterized by a vanishingly small friction coefficient (0.007) and ultralow wear rate (10−9 mm3N−1m−1) maintained in lubricants over an unprecedentedly long sliding distance without performance deterioration. We identify a tribochemical route for the decomposition of oil molecules catalytically activated by the TiB2-MoS2 film, leading to operando formation of fullerene-like carbon that leads to diminished friction. First-principles calculations unveil strong stress responses of a TiB2 structural framework under wear strains, offering insights into the ultralow wear rate. These findings showcase a promising strategy to develop high-performance superlubricating materials that meet stringent conditions for demanding applications.

Abstract: Summary
Ultrathin nanopore membrane is an emerging energy harvesting system capable of generating electricity from salinity gradients. Here, we report on the evaluation of its practical feasibility by exploring the energy conversion efficiency of single to densely packed multi-pores in a thin silicon nitride. The ionic current characteristics of single pores reveal a quasi-perfect cation selectivity when shrinking the diameter to 20 nm. The perm-selective nanopore is shown to yield osmotic power of 160 pW under a 1,000-fold transmembrane salt concentration difference. Meanwhile, whereas larger energy is gained by parallelly integrating multiple pores, excessive porosity also led to degraded energy conversion efficiency, thereby demonstrating an optimal power density of 100 W per square meter for 100 nm-sized multi-nanopores with a grid spacing of 1 μm. The present findings offer a guide to design highly efficient nanopore membrane osmotic power generators.

Abstract: Summary
Lithium-ion batteries pose severe hazards if their safety is compromised. Previous work has shown that mechanical damage to the battery may not affect its voltage, capacity, or other primary specifications. Therefore, currently, there is no method to check the integrity of battery cells inside an electric vehicle battery pack once it has been subjected to a shock or impact. Here, we report a method to detect mechanical damage to Li-ion cells from their electrical response. We formulate the distribution function of relaxation times (DRT) by a series of passive electrical elements consisting of inductors, resistors, and capacitors. Using our DRT formulation and criteria, we show that the indented cells have substantially different high-frequency time constant characteristics than the control group. This non-invasive method has the potential for detecting hazardous mechanical damage to the batteries of electric vehicles after a road crash or impact landings of drones.

Abstract: Summary
The metabolic oxidative degradation of cellular lipids severely restricts replication of hepatitis C virus (HCV), a leading cause of chronic liver disease, but little is known about the factors regulating this process in infected cells. Here we show that HCV is restricted by an iron-dependent mechanism resembling the one triggering ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of non-apoptotic cell death, and mediated by the non-canonical desaturation of oleate to Mead acid and other highly unsaturated fatty acids by fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2). Genetic depletion and ectopic expression experiments show FADS2 is a key determinant of cellular sensitivity to ferroptosis. Inhibiting FADS2 markedly enhances HCV replication, whereas the ferroptosis-inducing compound erastin alters conformation of the HCV replicase and sensitizes it to direct-acting antiviral agents targeting the viral protease. Our results identify FADS2 as a rate-limiting factor in ferroptosis, and suggest the possibility of pharmacologically manipulating the ferroptosis pathway to attenuate viral replication.

Abstract: Summary
Hydrogen spillover is a widespread phenomenon on reducible metal oxide surfaces, with numerous observations confirming its occurrence. However, direct physical characterization of the spillover hydrogen species on an oxide catalyst support remains challenging. Differentiating the binding sites of specific spillover hydrogen species has been elusive. Herein, we vary temperature and reductive conditions, then quench and detect the physicochemical character of three distinct spillover hydrogen species on anatase titanium dioxide (TiO2-A) by deuterium magic-angle-spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, aided by density functional theory. Fast cooling during the sample preparation is crucial in quenching the spillover deuterium species to enable MAS NMR detection. Energetically favorable spillover deuterium species evolve from deuteron to deuteride states with increasing reduction temperature. Prevailing deuteron species reside on the 2-fold-coordinated O2c site of the TiO2-A (101) surface at low reduction temperature. At high reduction temperature, deuterides residing at oxygen vacancies (Ti6c–D–Ti5c) are formed.

Abstract: Summary
With the advent of genome sequencing and mining technologies, secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) within bacterial genomes are becoming easier to predict. For subsequent BGC characterization, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) has contributed to knocking out target genes and/or modulating their expression; however, CRISPR is limited to strains for which robust genetic tools are available. Here we present a strategy that combines CRISPR with chassis-independent recombinase-assisted genome engineering (CRAGE), which enables CRISPR systems in diverse bacteria. To demonstrate CRAGE-CRISPR, we select 10 polyketide/non-ribosomal peptide BGCs in Photorhabdus luminescens as models and create their deletion and activation mutants. Subsequent loss- and gain-of-function studies confirm 22 secondary metabolites associated with the BGCs, including a metabolite from a previously uncharacterized BGC. These results demonstrate that the CRAGE-CRISPR system is a simple yet powerful approach to rapidly perturb expression of defined BGCs and to profile genotype-phenotype relationships in bacteria.

Abstract: Summary
We identify a selective nanomolar inhibitor of blood-stage malarial proliferation from a screen of microbial natural product extracts. The responsible compound, PDE-I2, is a precursor of the anticancer duocarmycin family that preserves the class's sequence-specific DNA binding but lacks its signature DNA alkylating cyclopropyl warhead. While less active than duocarmycin, PDE-I2 retains comparable antimalarial potency to chloroquine. Importantly, PDE-I2 is >1,000-fold less toxic to human cell lines than duocarmycin, with mitigated impacts on eukaryotic chromosome stability. PDE-I2 treatment induces severe defects in parasite nuclear segregation leading to impaired daughter cell formation during schizogony. Time-of-addition studies implicate parasite DNA metabolism as the target of PDE-I2, with defects observed in DNA replication and chromosome integrity. We find the effect of duocarmycin and PDE-I2 on parasites is phenotypically indistinguishable, indicating that the DNA binding specificity of duocarmycins is sufficient and the genotoxic cyclopropyl warhead is dispensable for the parasite-specific selectivity of this compound class.

Abstract: Summary
Among several major unresolved challenges in reaction chemistry, controlling the yield and selectivity is particularly crucial. For on-surface synthesis (OSS), a prototype for basic understanding of reaction mechanisms, such control remains elusive. Here, using olefin cyclization, an important reaction in organic synthesis yet unknown for OSS to the best of our knowledge, as the model system, we propose a strategy to address this challenge by introducing carbon into the subsurface of Cu(111) (C-Cuδ+) and UV irradiation. The total olefin coupling rate on C-Cuδ+ increases to 10.1- and 5.3-fold higher than that on pristine Cu(111) at 298 and 323 K, respectively. The initial cyclization temperature reduces by 55 K on C-Cuδ+. UV irradiation further promotes the cyclization ratio from 22% to 40.3%. By integrating surface catalysis of the substrate with photochemistry of light-absorbing reactants, our results may open up a promising route for overcoming high reaction barriers and regulating selectivity in OSS.

Abstract: Summary
Catalytic asymmetric reactions of acetaldehyde, an inexpensive and versatile two-carbon nucleophile, still remain a challenge. Herein, chiral acyclic secondary aminocatalysts are developed as a means to address the difficult asymmetric reactions of acetaldehyde. The chiral acyclic secondary aminocatalysts exhibit unique reactivity and selectivity, which are not observable by using chiral cyclic secondary aminocatalysts or primary aminocatalysts. The activity is demonstrated by introducing previously challenging chemical transformations such as asymmetric Mannich reactions and switching enantioselectivity where the same absolute configuration of chiral catalysts are used. In general, the chiral acyclic catalysts improve activity and enantioselectivity, broadening the possible substrate scope. This work lays the foundation for the transformation of acetaldehyde with chiral acyclic secondary aminocatalysis and future work surrounding this class of aminocatalyst.

Abstract: Summary
Topoisomerase II (topo II) is essential for disentangling newly replicated chromosomes. DNA unlinking involves the physical passage of one duplex through another and depends on the transient formation of double-stranded DNA breaks, a step exploited by frontline chemotherapeutics to kill cancer cells. Although anti-topo II drugs are efficacious, they also elicit cytotoxic side effects in normal cells; insights into how topo II is regulated in different cellular contexts is essential to improve their targeted use. Using chemical fractionation and mass spectrometry, we have discovered that topo II is subject to metabolic control through the TCA cycle. We show that TCA metabolites stimulate topo II activity in vitro and that levels of TCA flux modulate cellular sensitivity to anti-topo II drugs in vivo. Our work reveals an unanticipated connection between the control of DNA topology and cellular metabolism, a finding with ramifications for the clinical use of anti-topo II therapies.

Abstract: Summary
gem-Difluoroalkanes widely exist in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials. The synthesis of gem-difluoroalkane synthons bearing a latent functional group is of significant value but is rarely explored. Reported herein is a facile synthesis of tosyloxylated gem-difluoroalkanes via an oxidative fluorination of readily available vinyl sulfonates. An intriguing [2,3]-sulfonyloxy migration, which has been rarely known, is involved as a key step. The OTs group within the products enables a divergent and modular synthesis of a wide variety of functionalized gem-difluoroalkanes via simple and reliable SN2 reactions. Notable features of this protocol include mild reaction conditions, high efficiency, and remarkably good functional group tolerance. Theoretical mechanistic studies support the involvement of a rate-determining [2,3]-sulfonyloxy shift.
Keywords: gem-difluorination; [2,3]-sulfonyloxy migration; vinyl sulfonate; hypervalent iodine; late-stage modification

Abstract: Summary
Some members of the deaf community suffer inconveniences in daily life due to communication difficulties. In many cases, deaf people’s vocal cords are intact, and so establishing speech recognition based on the correspondence between their intention and vocal cord vibration may help overcome some communication barriers, in particular human-machine interactions. Here, we report an anti-interference speech recognition system intended primarily for deaf people using a self-powered triboelectric vibration sensor (STVS) assisted by a contextual recognition model (CRM). A soft and safe woven structure nanofiber cellulose film (NFCF) is prepared as a vibration-sensitive layer, which endows STVS with high sensitivity at wide vibration frequencies (up to 1,000 Hz). The CRM can identify 17 commonly used expressions with an accuracy above 92.3% and provide voice identity recognition with 90.6% accuracy. Our speech recognition system could help in providing a facile, convenient, and bidirectional communication channel between deaf people and hearing people.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian mechanoreceptors endow the skin with the ability to perceive mechanical stimuli with precision. However, the fabrication of artificial mechanoreceptors with high sensitivity and resolution over a wide linear pressure range remains a key challenge. Herein, an artificial ion mechanoreceptor with the core-shell structured nanofibrous membrane as the sensitive layer is proposed by mimicking the biomechanical receptor. The membrane embeds ionic liquids and poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) hybrid nanofibers into a thermoplastic polyurethane matrix, enabling a reversible conversion between non-ionic and iontronic sensing modes induced by tactilely triggered ion movements. It exhibits a high sensitivity (32.70 kPa−1), a linear response (R2 ≈ 0.999) over a wide range of 0.04 Pa to 209 kPa, and an ultra-high resolution of 0.035% at 100 kPa (far exceeding the resolution of skin of ∼7%). The receptors are further used to monitoring physiological signals (even weak fingertip pulse signals) and assembled into an array to aid object recognition.

Abstract: Summary
We identify the Plasmodium falciparum acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase (PfAcAS) as a druggable target, using genetic and chemical validation. In vitro evolution of resistance with two antiplasmodial drug-like compounds (MMV019721 and MMV084978) selects for mutations in PfAcAS. Metabolic profiling of compound-treated parasites reveals changes in acetyl-CoA levels for both compounds. Genome editing confirms that mutations in PfAcAS are sufficient to confer resistance. Knockdown studies demonstrate that PfAcAS is essential for asexual growth, and partial knockdown induces hypersensitivity to both compounds. In vitro biochemical assays using recombinantly expressed PfAcAS validates that MMV019721 and MMV084978 directly inhibit the enzyme by preventing CoA and acetate binding, respectively. Immunolocalization studies reveal that PfAcAS is primarily localized to the nucleus. Functional studies demonstrate inhibition of histone acetylation in compound-treated wild-type, but not in resistant parasites. Our findings identify and validate PfAcAS as an essential, druggable target involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
Existing passive daytime radiative cooling (PDRC) materials have promising performance yet are far from mass production and therefore have limited contribution to carbon neutrality. Pulp provides a good opportunity for renewable cooling materials with emerging optical and thermal properties of cellulose to readily deploy for cooling applications. Here, we report a facile yet effective “top-down” approach to transforming industrially bleached pulp into “cooling pulp” with good scalability. The one-step H2O2 spraying improves the cooling pulp’s solar reflection to 89.8%, thereby boosting its PDRC performance. The cooling pulp provides an average 33.2 W m−2 cooling power and a sub-ambient temperature around midday. The cooling pulp’s PDRC effect is demonstrated at a pilot scale of 6.1 × 5.4 m2. Practical applications of cooling-pulp-based products are demonstrated including roofing tiles, heat-sensitive packages, and window visors. Cooling pulp’s economic and environmental benefits make it a cost-competitive and sustainable option for close-to-market cooling technologies.

Abstract: Summary
Contemporary drug discovery typically quantifies the effect of a molecule on a biological target using the equilibrium-derived measurements of IC50, EC50, or KD. Kinetic descriptors of drug binding are frequently linked with the effectiveness of a molecule in modulating a disease phenotype; however, these parameters are yet to be fully adopted in early drug discovery. Nanoluciferase bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (NanoBRET) can be used to measure interactions between fluorophore-conjugated probes and luciferase fused target proteins. Here, we describe an intracellular NanoBRET competition assay that can be used to quantify cellular kinetic rates of compound binding to nanoluciferase-fused bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) proteins. Comparative rates are generated using a cell-free NanoBRET assay and by utilizing orthogonal recombinant protein-based methodologies. A screen of known pan-BET inhibitors is used to demonstrate the value of this approach in the investigation of kinetic selectivity between closely related proteins.

Abstract: Summary
The optimal use of many cancer drugs is hampered by a lack of detailed understanding of their mechanism of action (MoA). Here, we apply a high-resolution implementation of the proteome-wide cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) to follow protein interaction changes induced by the antimetabolite 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and related nucleosides. We confirm anticipated effects on the known main target, thymidylate synthase (TYMS), and enzymes in pyrimidine metabolism and DNA damage pathways. However, most interaction changes we see are for proteins previously not associated with the MoA of 5-FU, including wide-ranging effects on RNA-modification and -processing pathways. Attenuated responses of specific proteins in a resistant cell model identify key components of the 5-FU MoA, where intriguingly the abrogation of TYMS inhibition is not required for cell proliferation.

Abstract: Summary
Seeking a promising route for efficient conversion of solar energy into electricity or fuel for energy storage is important for addressing the intermittent nature of solar energy sources. Here we report a photo-thermo-electrochemical cell (PTEC) that utilizes two high-temperature solid oxide-based cells working at different high temperatures for flexible electricity generation and hydrogen production for energy storage. The electricity and hydrogen production modes can be switched by introducing a voltage difference or current difference with or without a DC-DC converter. Optimized heat recovery can achieve a solar-to-electricity efficiency and solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 10.45% and 9.92%, respectively. The energy storage capability can be as high as 1.05. Engineering better catalysts and higher conducting electrolytes can further increase the solar-to-electricity and solar-to-hydrogen efficiency. This PTEC opens a promising way for the efficient use of solar energy and for flexible electricity and fuel generation.

Abstract: Summary
Data sparseness is expected to negatively impact machine learning (ML) and especially deep learning (DL). In the era of DL, much emphasis is put on learning from large datasets. In cheminformatics, compound classification represents a suitable task for exploring characteristics of ML/DL. Here, we determine minimal data requirements for learning using activity-based compound classification as an exemplary application. Systematic predictions using message-passing neural networks, random forests, and simple controls are carried out on more than 100 activity classes using learning sets of increasing size. Contrary to expectations, predictive models are already obtained on the basis of “ultra-small” training sets containing only a few active compounds. These findings are rationalized by explainable ML, which reveals features that determine predictions. Accurate predictions often only depend on a few molecular features that might be detected even in ultra-small training sets. The findings revise current assumptions about data requirements for effective ML/DL.
