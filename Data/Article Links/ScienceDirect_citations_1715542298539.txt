Abstract: PTEN deficiency often causes defects in DNA damage repair. Currently, effective therapies for breast cancer are lacking. ATM is an attractive target for cancer treatment. Previous studies suggested a synthetic lethality between PTEN and PARP. However, the synthetically lethal interaction between PTEN and ATM in breast cancer has not been reported. Moreover, the mechanism remains elusive. Here, using KU-60019, an ATM kinase inhibitor, we investigated ATM inhibition as a synthetically lethal strategy to target breast cancer cells with PTEN defects. We found that KU-60019 preferentially sensitizes PTEN-deficient MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells to cisplatin, though it also slightly enhances sensitivity of PTEN wild-type breast cancer cells. The increased cytotoxic sensitivity is associated with apoptosis, as evidenced by flow cytometry and PARP cleavage. Additionally, the increase of DNA damage accumulation due to the decreased capability of DNA repair, as indicated by γ-H2AX and Rad51 foci, also contributed to this selective cytotoxicity. Mechanistically, compared with PTEN wild-type MDA-MB-231 cells, PTEN-deficient MDA-MB-468 cells have lower level of Rad51, higher ATM kinase activity, and display the elevated level of DNA damage. Moreover, these differences could be further enlarged by cisplatin. Our findings suggest that ATM is a promising target for PTEN-defective breast cancer.

Abstract: The paired-like homeobox 2B gene (PHOX2B) encodes a key transcription factor that plays a role in the development of the autonomic nervous system and the neural structures involved in controlling breathing. In humans, PHOX2B over-expression plays a role in the pathogenesis of tumours arising from the sympathetic nervous system such as neuroblastomas, and heterozygous PHOX2B mutations cause Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS), a life-threatening neurocristopathy characterised by the defective autonomic control of breathing and involving altered CO2/H+ chemosensitivity. The recovery of CO2/H+ chemosensitivity and increased ventilation have been observed in two CCHS patients using the potent contraceptive progestin desogestrel. Given the central role of PHOX2B in the pathogenesis of CCHS, and the progesterone-mediated effects observed in the disease, we generated progesterone-responsive neuroblastoma cells, and evaluated the effects of 3-Ketodesogestrel (3-KDG), the biologically active metabolite of desogestrel, on the expression of PHOX2B and its target genes. Our findings demonstrate that, through progesterone nuclear receptor PR-B, 3-KDG down-regulates PHOX2B gene expression, by a post-transcriptional mechanism, and its target genes and open up the possibility that this mechanism may contribute to the positive effects observed in some CCHS patients.

Abstract: Summary
Loss of a cell's ability to terminally differentiate because of mutations is a selected genetic event in tumorigenesis. Genomic analyses of low-grade glioma have reported recurrent mutations of far upstream element-binding protein 1 (FUBP1). Here, we show that FUBP1 expression is dynamically regulated during neurogenesis and that its downregulation in neural progenitors impairs terminal differentiation and promotes tumorigenesis collaboratively with expression of IDH1R132H. Mechanistically, collaborative action between SRRM4 and FUBP1 is necessary for mini-exon splicing of the neurospecific LSD1+8a isoform. LSD1+8a was downregulated upon loss of FUBP1 in neural progenitors, thereby impairing terminal neuronal differentiation and maturation. Reinforcing LSD1+8a expression in FUBP1-downregulated neural progenitors restored terminal differentiation and suppressed tumorigenesis; hence, LSD1+8a is an obligatory effector of FUBP1-dependent neuronal differentiation. These findings establish a direct role for FUBP1 in neuronal differentiation and also explain its tumor-suppressor function in the nervous system.

Abstract: Summary
Protein-protein interactions mediate essential cellular processes, however the detection of native interactions is challenging since they are often low affinity and context dependent. Here, we develop a chemical proteomics approach in vivo CLASPI [iCLASPI] (in vivo crosslinking-assisted and stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture [SILAC]-based protein identification) relying upon photo-crosslinking, amber suppression, and SILAC-based quantitative proteomics to profile context-dependent protein-protein interactions in living cells. First, we use iCLASPI to profile in vivo binding partners of the N-terminal tails of soluble histone H3 or H4. We identify known histone chaperones and modifying proteins, thereby validating our approach, and find an interaction between soluble histone H3 and UBR7, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, mediated by UBR7's PHD domain. Furthermore, we apply iCLASPI to profile the context-dependent protein-protein interactions of chromatin-associated histone H3 at different cell-cycle stages, and identify ANP32A as a mitosis-specific interactor. Our results demonstrate that the iCLASPI approach can provide a general strategy for identifying native, context-dependent direct protein-protein interactions using photo-crosslinking and quantitative proteomics.

Abstract: Acyl-CoA binding domain containing 3 (ACBD3) is involved in the maintenance of Golgi structure and function through its interaction with the integral membrane protein. However, the clinical significance and biological role of ACBD3 in breast cancer remain unclear. Herein, we found that the mRNA and protein levels of ACBD3 were markedly up-regulated in breast cancer cells and tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis of breast cancer tissues demonstrated that ACBD3 overexpression was significantly associated with advanced clinicopathological features. Univariate and multivariate analysis indicated that ACBD3 overexpression correlates with poor prognosis in breast cancer. Furthermore, overexpressing ACBD3 promoted, while silencing ACBD3 inhibited, self-renewal and tumorigenesis in breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo respectively. Importantly, upregulating ACBD3 promoted the self-renewal and tumorigenesis of breast cancer cells via activating the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, and the pro-self-renewal effect of ACBD3 in breast cancer was antagonized by the Wnt signaling inhibitor TCF4-siRNA and Lef1-siRNA.These findings indicate that ACBD3 may represent candidate therapeutic targets to enable the elimination of breast cancer stem cells, providing the preclinical proof-of-concept for the prevention and treatment of breast cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The core functions of stem cells (SCs) are critically regulated by their cellular redox status. Glutathione is the most abundant non-protein thiol functioning as an antioxidant and a redox regulator. However, an investigation into the relationship between glutathione-mediated redox capacity and SC activities is hindered by lack of probe. Here, we demonstrate that cyanoacrylamide-based coumarin derivatives are ratiometric probes suitable for the real-time monitoring of glutathione levels in living SCs. These probes revealed that glutathione levels are heterogeneous among subcellular organelles and among individual cells and show dynamic changes and heterogeneity in repopulating SCs depending on oxidative stress or culture conditions. Importantly, a subpopulation of SCs with high glutathione levels exhibited increased stemness and migration activities in vitro and showed improved therapeutic efficiency in treating asthma. Our results indicate that high glutathione levels are required for maintaining SC functions, and monitoring glutathione dynamics and heterogeneity can advance our understanding of the cellular responses to oxidative stress.

Abstract: Previous reports, including our experimental results, showed that macrophages migrate to prostate cancer (PCa) cells. We tested whether the migrated macrophages affect the susceptibility of castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) cells to cytotoxic actions of natural killer (NK) cells. We found treatment of tumor cells with the conditioned media (CM) of the PMA/IL-4 treated THP-1 cells (M2 type macrophages) (THP-1 CM) decreased the susceptibility of tumor cells to NK cell cytotoxicity, as a result of increased programmed death receptor ligand 1 (PD-L1) and decreased NK group 2D (NKG2D) ligands in CRPC cells. Meanwhile, the decreased susceptibility of tumor cells was also detected when NK cells were treated with THP-1 CM and used in NK cell cytotoxicity tests. Therefore, we observed higher resistance of CRPC cells when both tumor and NK cells were treated with THP-1 CM than when tumor cells or NK cells were individually treated. We further discovered that the PMA/IL-4 treated THP-1 cells secrete a high level of IL-6, so blocking the IL-6 action significantly decreased the PD-L1 level while recovering the NKG2D ligands, thus increasing the susceptibility of CRPC cells to NK cell action. Moreover, we discovered that JAK-Stat3 is the most critical IL-6 downstream signaling in triggering the THP-1 CM effect. Consequently, we found the susceptibility of CRPC cells to NK cells was increased when either JAK or Stat 3 inhibitor was added when tumor cells were treated with THP-1 CM, and that the best effect was observed when the JAK inhibitor and PD-L1 Ab were added together.

Abstract: Background
Colorectal cancer (CRC) liver metastasis is highly unfavorable for patient outcome and is a leading cause of cancer-related death. Pre-clinical research of CRC liver metastasis predominately utilizes CRC cell lines grown in tissue culture. Here, we demonstrate that CRC liver metastases organoids derived from human specimens recapitulate some aspects of human disease.
Methods
Human CRC liver metastases pathological specimens were obtained following patient consent. Tumor disaggregates were plated and organoids were allowed to expand. CRC markers were identified by immunofluorescence. Stem cell genes were analysed by QPCR and flow cytometry. Response to drug therapy was quantified using time-lapse imaging and MATLAB analysis.
Results
Organoids showed global expression of the epithelial marker, EpCAM and the adenocarcinoma marker, CEA CAM1. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that organoids express the stem cell surface markers CD24 and CD44. Finally, we demonstrated that CRC liver metastases organoids acquire chemotherapy resistance and can be utilized as surrogates for drug testing.
Conclusion
These data demonstrate that CRC liver metastases organoids recapitulate some aspects of human disease and may provide an invaluable resource for investigating novel drug therapies, chemotherapy resistance and mechanism of metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Both glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) are bona fide self-renewal factors for spermatogonial stem cells, whereas retinoic acid (RA) induces spermatogonial differentiation. In this study, we investigated the functional differences between FGF2 and GDNF in the germline niche by providing these factors using a drug delivery system in vivo. Although both factors expanded the GFRA1+ subset of undifferentiated spermatogonia, the FGF2-expanded subset expressed RARG, which is indispensable for proper differentiation, 1.9-fold more frequently than the GDNF-expanded subset, demonstrating that FGF2 expands a differentiation-prone subset in the testis. Moreover, FGF2 acted on the germline niche to suppress RA metabolism and GDNF production, suggesting that FGF2 modifies germline niche functions to be more appropriate for spermatogonial differentiation. These results suggest that FGF2 contributes to induction of differentiation rather than maintenance of undifferentiated spermatogonia, indicating reconsideration of the role of FGF2 in the germline niche.

Abstract: Summary
Rotavirus vaccines (RVV) protect against childhood gastroenteritis caused by rotavirus (RV) but have decreased effectiveness in low- and middle-income settings. This proof-of-concept, randomized-controlled, open-label trial tested if microbiome modulation can improve RVV immunogenicity. Healthy adults were randomized and administered broad-spectrum (oral vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole), narrow-spectrum (vancomycin), or no antibiotics and then vaccinated with RVV, 21 per group per protocol. Baseline anti-RV IgA was high in all subjects. Although antibiotics did not alter absolute anti-RV IgA titers, RVV immunogenicity was boosted at 7 days in the narrow-spectrum group. Further, antibiotics increased fecal shedding of RV while also rapidly altering gut bacterial beta diversity. Beta diversity associated with RVV immunogenicity boosting at day 7 and specific bacterial taxa that distinguish RVV boosters and RV shedders were identified. Despite the negative primary endpoint, this study demonstrates that microbiota modification alters the immune response to RVV and supports further exploration of microbiome manipulation to improve RVV immunogenicity.

Abstract: Summary
Heterobifunctional molecules that recruit E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as cereblon, for targeted protein degradation represent an emerging pharmacological strategy. A major unanswered question is how generally applicable this strategy is to all protein targets. In this study, we designed a multi-kinase degrader by conjugating a highly promiscuous kinase inhibitor with a cereblon-binding ligand, and used quantitative proteomics to discover 28 kinases, including BTK, PTK2, PTK2B, FLT3, AURKA, AURKB, TEC, ULK1, ITK, and nine members of the CDK family, as degradable. This set of kinases is only a fraction of the intracellular targets bound by the degrader, demonstrating that successful degradation requires more than target engagement. The results guided us to develop selective degraders for FLT3 and BTK, with potentials to improve disease treatment. Together, this study demonstrates an efficient approach to triage a gene family of interest to identify readily degradable targets for further studies and pre-clinical developments.

Abstract: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of cancer with aggressive behaviors (high recurrence and metastasis rate) and poor prognosis. Therefore, studying the determining factors that lead to malignant TNBCs is necessary to develop personalized therapy and improve survival rates. In this study, we first analyzed levels of chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 4 (CHD4) in 60 TNBC patients by immunohistochemical staining. We then clarified the role of CHD4 in TNBC and non-TNBC cell lines. Our clinical data indicated that higher CHD4 expression is positively correlated with metastatic stage, tumor recurrence, and survival status. Consistent with the clinical analytical data, our in vitro data also indicated that high level of CHD4 is positively correlated with malignant behaviors in TNBC cells, such as cell motility and mortality. For further analyses, we found that E-cadherin, N-cadherin and fibronetin are involved in CHD4-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Silencing of CHD4 also increased drug sensitivity to cisplatin and PARP1 inhibitor, especially in TNBC cells. Altogether, our findings showed that CHD4 is not only a potential prognostic biomarker for TNBC patient survival, but is also a powerful candidate in the development of new anti-cancer agents in TNBC.

Abstract: Renal ischemia reperfusion (IR) is a common cause of acute kidney injury (AKI), and no effective treatment is available to date. In our previous studies, we demonstrated that Tisp40 exacerbates tubular cell apoptosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis after renal IR injury. However, the role of Tisp40 in renal inflammatory responses and tubular cell proliferation during renal IR injury remains unknown. In this study, Tisp40 knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice were induced with or without renal IR injury. For renal IR, bilateral renal pedicels were exposed and clamped to induce 30 min of ischemia. After 48 h of reperfusion, the kidneys were collected for analyses. Results showed that Tisp40 deficiency attenuates neutrophil and macrophage infiltration after renal IR. Consistently, the protein levels of TNF-α and MCP-1 were markedly decreased, and the phosphorylation levels of IκBα and P65 were inhibited in Tisp40-deficient mice than in WT mice in renal IR injury. In addition, compared with WT mice, Tisp40 deficiency significantly increased the expression levels of proliferative cellular nuclear antigen and phosphorylated Erk1/2 after renal IR injury. In conclusion, Tisp40 deficiency limits renal inflammatory responses and promotes tubular cell proliferation in ischemic AKI.

Abstract: Tristetraprolin (TTP) is the most well-known member of RNA-binding zinc-finger protein that play a significant role in accelerating mRNA decay. Increasingly studies have reported that TTP was functioned as a tumor suppressor gene in several types of carcinomas, while its underlying mechanism is not clear yet. In the current study, we found that TTP overexpression decreased cell proliferation and increased cell death in lung adenocarcinoma cells, with the cell cycle arrest at the S phase. Remarkably, instead of inducing cell apoptosis directly, TTP overexpression alters cell autophagy. Our studies demonstrate that TTP overexpression has no effect on apoptosis related genes, but decreases the expression of autophagy-related genes, including Beclin 1 and LC3II. The level of autophagy flux assessed by infection with the mGFP–RFP–LC3 adenovirus construction has been blocked by TTP overexpression. Moreover, the autophagic vacuoles number detected by transmission electron microscopy decreased with TTP expression up-regulation. Our results indicate, for the first time, that TTP suppresses cell proliferation and increases cell death through cell autophagy pathway in lung cancer cells. Our study provides a new angle of view for TTP function as a tumor suppressor which could be targeted in tumor treatment.

Abstract: Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is implicated in cell death in addition to a role as a glycolytic enzyme. In particular, when cells are exposed to cellular stressors involving nitric oxide (NO) production, GAPDH can undergo NO-induced S-nitrosylation and S-nitrosylated GAPDH has been shown to elicit apoptosis. However, the mechanism underlying the regulation of the pro-apoptotic function of GAPDH remains unclear. Here, we found that protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) mediated arginine methylation of GAPDH in primary bone marrow-derived macrophages in a NO-dependent manner. Moreover, PRMT1 inhibited S-nitrosylation of GAPDH as well as its binding to SIAH1, thereby reducing the nuclear translocation of GAPDH in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/interferon (IFN)-γ-activated macrophages. Furthermore, depletion of PRMT1 expression by RNA interference potentiated LPS/IFN-γ-induced apoptosis in macrophages. Taken together, our results suggest that PRMT1 has a previously unrecognized function to inhibit activation-induced cell death of macrophages through arginine methylation of GAPDH.

Abstract: Summary
The 26S proteasome is the major proteolytic machine for breaking down cytosolic and nuclear proteins in eukaryotes. Due to the lack of a suitable assay, it is difficult to measure routinely and quantitatively the breakdown of proteins by the 26S proteasome in vitro. In the present study, we developed an assay to monitor proteasome-mediated protein degradation. Using this assay, we discovered that epidithiodiketopiperazine (ETPs) blocked the degradation of our model substrate in vitro. Further characterization revealed that ETPs inhibited proteasome function by targeting the essential proteasomal deubiquitinase Rpn11 (POH1/PSMD14). ETPs also inhibited other JAMM (JAB1/MPN/Mov34 metalloenzyme) proteases such as Csn5 and AMSH. An improved ETP with fewer non-specific effects, SOP11, stabilized a subset of proteasome substrates in cells, induced the unfolded protein response, and led to cell death. SOP11 represents a class of Rpn11 inhibitor and provides an alternative route to develop proteasome inhibitors.

Since the mechanism for the resistance of panobinostat to MM remains elusive, we aimed to clarify this mechanism and the synergism of panobinostat with lenalidomide. The mRNA and protein of transcription factor IRF4 were overexpressed in CD138+ mononuclear cells from MM patients compared with in those from healthy donors. Given that direct IRF4 inhibitors are clinically unavailable, we intended to explore the mechanism by which IRF4 expression was regulated in MM. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) promotes the growth and drug resistance of various malignant tumors, and its expression is positively correlated with IRF4 mRNA and protein expression levels. Herein, panobinostat induced acetylation of histone H3K9 and activation of caspase-3 in MM cells, being inversely correlated with the reduction of HO-1/IRF4/MYC protein levels. Adding Z-DEVD-FMK, a caspase-3 inhibitor, abolished the HO-1/IRF4 reduction by panobinostat alone or in combination with lenalidomide, suggesting that caspase-3-mediated HO-1/IRF4/MYC degradation occurred. Given that lenalidomide stabilized cereblon and facilitated IRF4 degradation in MM cells, we combined it with LBH589, an HDAC inhibitor. LBH589 and lenalidomide exerted synergistic effects, and LBH589 reversed the efficacy of lenalidomide on the resistance of CD138+ primary MM cells, in part due to simultaneous suppression of HO-1, IRF4 and MYC. The results provide an eligible therapeutic strategy for targeting MM depending on the IRF4 network and clinical testing of this drug combination in MM patients.

Abstract: Salmon lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) are parasitic copepods, living mainly on Atlantic salmon and leading to large economical losses in aquaculture every year. Due to the emergence of resistances to several drugs, alternative treatments are developed, including treatment with hydrogen peroxide, freshwater or thermal treatment. The present study gives a first overview of the thermotolerance and stress response of salmon lice. Sea lice nauplii acclimated to 10°C can survive heat shocks up to 30°C and are capable of hardening by a sublethal heat shock. We searched in the genome for heat shock protein (HSP) encoding genes and tested their inducibility after heat shock, changes in salinity and treatment with hydrogen peroxide, employing microfluidic qPCRs. We assessed 38 candidate genes, belonging to the small HSP, HSP40, HSP70 and HSP90 families. Nine of these genes showed strong induction after a non-lethal heat shock. In contrast, only three and two of these genes were induced after changes in salinity and incubation in hydrogen peroxide, respectively. This work provides the basis for further work on the stress response on the economically important parasite L. salmonis.

Abstract: Ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF) is a debilitating disease resulting from the development of ectopic bone formation, which leads to the compression of the spinal cord. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) was found to be upregulated and microRNA-182 (miR-182) was downregulated in OLF tissue. We investigated the effects of NAMPT and miR-182 expression in OLF cells and the influence on proteins associated with osteogenic differentiation. MiR-182 overexpression inhibited NAMPT, RUNX2, OCN and OPN mRNA and protein expression in OLF cells. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assay and Alizarin red staining confirmed reduced levels of osteogenic differentiation and mineralized nodule formation. Knockdown of NAMPT and the NAMPT inhibitor FK866 also inhibits RUNX2, OCN and OPN mRNA expression and protein levels, whereas overexpression of NAMPT promotes the expression of RUNX2, OCN and OPN and the generation of bone nodules. Dual-luciferase reporter assays revealed that miR-182 directly targets NAMPT and downregulates its expression. Transfection of OLF cells with miR-182 downregulated NAMPT and suppressed the regulation of RUNX2, OCN, and OPN by NAMPT overexpression. Overall, these data demonstrate that miR-182 suppresses OLF by downregulating NAMPT.

Abstract: LIM domain, constituted by two tandem C2H2 zinc finger motif, proteins regulate several biological processes. They are usually found associated with various functional domains like Homeodomain, kinase domain and other protein binding domains. LIM proteins that are devoid of other domains are called LIM only proteins (LMO). LMO proteins were first identified in humans and are implicated in development and oncogenesis. They regulate various cell specifications by regulating the activity of respective transcriptional complexes. The Drosophila LMO protein (dLMO), Beadex (Bx), regulates various developmental processes like wing margin development and bristle development. It also regulates Drosophila behavior in response to cocaine and ethanol. We have previously generated Bx null flies and shown its essential function in neurons for multiple aspects of female reproduction. However, it was not known whether Bx affects reproduction through its independent function in ovaries. In this paper we show that female flies null for Bx lay eggs with multiple defects. Further, through knock down studies we demonstrate that function of Bx in follicle cells is required for normal egg development. We also show that function of Bx is particularly required in border cells for Drosophila fertility.

Abstract: Summary
The interactions between proteins and biological membranes are important for drug development, but remain notoriously refractory to structural investigation. We combine non-denaturing mass spectrometry (MS) with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to unravel the connections among co-factor, lipid, and inhibitor binding in the peripheral membrane protein dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), a key anticancer target. Interrogation of intact DHODH complexes by MS reveals that phospholipids bind via their charged head groups at a limited number of sites, while binding of the inhibitor brequinar involves simultaneous association with detergent molecules. MD simulations show that lipids support flexible segments in the membrane-binding domain and position the inhibitor and electron acceptor-binding site away from the membrane surface, similar to the electron acceptor-binding site in respiratory chain complex I. By complementing MS with MD simulations, we demonstrate how a peripheral membrane protein uses lipids to modulate its structure in a similar manner as integral membrane proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Monitoring enzymatic activities at the cell surface is challenging due to the poor efficiency of transport and membrane integration of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based biosensors. Therefore, we developed a hybrid biosensor with separate donor and acceptor that assemble in situ. The directed evolution and sequence-function analysis technologies were integrated to engineer a monobody variant (PEbody) that binds to R-phycoerythrin (R-PE) dye. PEbody was used for visualizing the dynamic formation/separation of intercellular junctions. We further fused PEbody with the enhanced CFP and an enzyme-specific peptide at the extracellular surface to create a hybrid FRET biosensor upon R-PE capture for monitoring membrane-type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) activities. This biosensor revealed asymmetric distribution of MT1-MMP activities, which were high and low at loose and stable cell-cell contacts, respectively. Therefore, directed evolution and rational design are promising tools to engineer molecular binders and hybrid FRET biosensors for monitoring molecular regulations at the surface of living cells.

Abstract: Summary
Genome-wide association studies have linked polymorphisms in the autophagy gene ATG16L1 with susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the cell-type-specific effects of autophagy on the regulation of chronic intestinal inflammation have not been investigated. Here, we assessed the effect of myeloid-specific or intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific deletion of Atg16l1 on chronic colitis triggered by the intestinal opportunistic pathogen Helicobacter hepaticus in mice. Although Atg16l1 deficiency in myeloid cells had little effect on disease, mice selectively lacking Atg16l1 in IECs (Atg16l1VC) developed severely exacerbated pathology, accompanied by elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and increased IEC apoptosis. Using ex vivo IEC organoids, we demonstrate that autophagy intrinsically controls TNF-induced apoptosis and in vivo blockade of TNF attenuated the exacerbated pathology in Atg16l1VC mice. These findings suggest that the IBD susceptibility gene ATG16L1 and the process of autophagy within the epithelium control inflammation-induced apoptosis and barrier integrity to limit chronic intestinal inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Many pathogenic intracellular bacteria manipulate the host phago-endosomal system to establish and maintain a permissive niche. The fate and identity of these intracellular compartments is controlled by phosphoinositide lipids. By mechanisms that have remained undefined, a Francisella pathogenicity island-encoded secretion system allows phagosomal escape and replication of bacteria within host cell cytoplasm. Here we report the discovery that a substrate of this system, outside pathogenicity island A (OpiA), represents a family of wortmannin-resistant bacterial phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase enzymes with members found in a wide range of intracellular pathogens, including Rickettsia and Legionella spp. We show that OpiA acts on the Francisella-containing phagosome and promotes bacterial escape into the cytoplasm. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the phenotypic consequences of OpiA inactivation are mitigated by endosomal maturation arrest. Our findings suggest that Francisella, and likely other intracellular bacteria, override the finely tuned dynamics of phagosomal PI(3)P in order to promote intracellular survival and pathogenesis.

Abstract: Dendritic cells (DCs) are pivotal to initiating adaptive immune response. Emerging evidence highlights important roles of tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (Tsc1) in DC development and activation. Our previous study also showed that Tsc1 expression in DCs was required to promote T-cell homeostasis and response partially through inhibiting mammalian target of rapamycin complex1 (mTORC1). However, the molecular mechanism of transcriptional regulation by which Tsc1 control DC homeostasis and function remains largely unknown. Here we globally identified the Tsc1-regulated genes by comparing the transcriptional profiling of Tsc1-deficient DCs with wild-type DCs. It showed that Tsc1 specifically regulated the expression of groups of gene sets critically involved in DC survival, proliferation, metabolism and antigen presentation. The impacts of Tsc1 on DC gene expression were partially dependent on inhibition of mTORC1 signal. Our study thus provides a comprehensive molecular basis for understanding how Tsc1 programs the homeostasis and function of DCs through transcriptional regulation.

Abstract: Endplate inflammation remains a difficult task to diagnose and treat, partly due to the absence of in-depth understanding of the cellular and molecular factors driving this condition. In the current study, we investigated the circulating immune cells in patients with idiopathic endplate inflammation. Compared to healthy controls, the patients with endplate inflammation presented a significant upregulation of Th17 cells, characterized by higher frequencies of circulating IL-17+CD4+ T cells examined directly ex vivo and after PMA and ionomycin (PMA/I) stimulation. The frequency of Th17 cells in patients was not correlated with patient age, sex, or smoking status, but was significantly correlated with patient BMI. The total CD4+ T cells from patients with end plate inflammation also presented significantly higher levels of IL-17 secretion directly ex vivo and after PMA/I stimulation. The IL-17 secretion was primarily mediated by CCR4+CCR6+ CD4+ T cells, followed by CCR4-CCR6+ CD4+ T cells and was nearly absent in CCR4-CCR6- CD4+ T cells. Monocytes incubated with CCR4+CCR6+ CD4+ T cells presented significantly higher MHC class II expression, as well as higher CD80 and CD86 expression. The secretion of IL-6 and TNF was significantly higher in cell cultures containing CCR4+CCR6+ CD4+ T cells than in cell cultures containing CCR4-CCR6- CD4+ T cells. These effects were reduced when the IL-17A cytokine was neutralized. Together, we identified a systemic upregulation of Th17 responses that could contribute to proinflammatory monocyte activation in patients with endplate inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer stem cell (CSC) identification relies on transplantation assays of cell subpopulations sorted from fresh tumor samples. Here, we attempt to bypass limitations of abundant tumor source and predetermined immune selection by in vivo propagating patient-derived xenografts (PDX) from human malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT), a rare and lethal pediatric neoplasm, to an advanced state in which most cells behave as CSCs. Stemness is then probed by comparative transcriptomics of serial PDXs generating a gene signature of epithelial to mesenchymal transition, invasion/motility, metastasis, and self-renewal, pinpointing putative MRT CSC markers. The relevance of these putative CSC molecules is analyzed by sorting tumorigenic fractions from early-passaged PDX according to one such molecule, deciphering expression in archived primary tumors, and testing the effects of CSC molecule inhibition on MRT growth. Using this platform, we identify ALDH1 and lysyl oxidase (LOX) as relevant targets and provide a larger framework for target and drug discovery in rare pediatric cancers.

Abstract: One of the major causes of death in colorectal cancer (CRC) is invasion and metastasis. Better understanding of the molecular mechanism of CRC invasion and metastasis is essential in developing effective cancer therapies. Cooperative effect of CXCR3 and CXCR4 plays a crucial role in regulating CRC invasion. In present study, we discovered that CRC cells expressing higher levels of CXCR3 and CXCR4 were more invasive. Additionally, CXCR3 formed heteromers with CXCR4 and retained CXCR4 on cell surface. CXCR3 knockdown reduced surface CXCR4 expression and partially inhibited CRC cell invasion. On the contrary, CXCR3 overexpression enhanced surface CXCR4 abundance and promoted CRC cell invasion. Further research indicated that CXCR3-A isoform was responsible for increased CXCR4 surface expression and CRC cell invasion. However, CXCR3-A overexpression without CXCR4 expression did not cause CRC cell invasion, which suggested that CXCR3-A indirectly affect cell invasion through regulating CXCR4. Taken together, CXCR3 enhanced CXCR4 function in CRC cell invasion through forming heteromers with CXCR4 on cell surface and prevent CXCR4 internalization. Therefore, targeting CXCR3 could be a promising strategy for clinical treatment of CRC cell invasion and metastasis.

Abstract: Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are needed for white matter repair after various brain injury. Means that promote OPC functions could benefit white matter recovery after injury. Chemokine CXCL12 and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) both have been shown to promote remyelination. We hypothesize that the beneficial effects of EPCs and CXCL12 can be harnessed by genetically modifying EPCs with cxcl12 to synergistically improve the functions of OPCs. In this work, CXCL12-EPC was generated using virus-mediated gene transfer. OPCs were cultured with CXCL12-EPC conditioned media (CM) to analyze its impact on the proliferation, migration, differentiation and survival properties of OPCs. We blocked or knocked-down the receptors of CXCL12, namely CXCR4 and CXCR7, respectively to investigate their functions in regulating OPCs properties. Results revealed that CXCL12-EPC CM further promoted OPCs behavioral properties and upregulated the expression of PDGFR-α, bFGF, CXCR4 and CXCR7 in OPCs, albeit following different time course. Blocking CXCR4 diminished the beneficial effects of CXCL12 on OPCs proliferation and migration, while knocking down CXCR7 inhibited OPCs differentiation. Our results supported that cxcl12 gene modification of EPCs further promoted EPCs’ ability in augmenting the remyelination properties of OPCs, suggesting that CXCL12-EPC hold great potential in white matter repair.

Abstract: It has been shown that the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients presented cytotoxic CD8 T cell response against Streptococcus salivarius (S. salivarius), of which the frequency was positively associated with recurrence-free survival in OSCC patients. To identify the conditions required for regulating S. salivarius-specific CD8 T cell-mediated cytotoxicity, we selectively depleted individual components of the PBMCs, and observed that the depletion of monocytes/macrophages, but not other immune cell subsets, significantly downregulated the S. salivarius-specific CD8 T cell cytotoxicity. Monocyte/macrophage alone was sufficient to reconstitute optimal granzyme B expression from S. salivarius-specific CD8 T cells. Also, both the memory and the naive CD8 T cells reacted to S. salivarius-stimulation, with the memory CD8 T cells presenting significantly higher S. salivarius-reactivity. Using M1- and M2-polarized macrophages from circulating monocytes, we found that M1-polarized macrophages, with significantly higher IL-12 expression and significantly lower IL-10 and MHC class II molecule expression, was more effective at promoting granzyme B responses in CD8 T cells, and required CD80/CD86 costimulating molecules for optimal responses. Interestingly, the tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) from resected tumors presented characteristics of M2-polarized macrophages with high MHC class II expression and low IL-12 secretion. The frequency of tumor-infiltrating S. salivarius-specific cytotoxic CD8 T cell was inversely correlated with the level of IL-10 secretion and the MHC class II molecule expression in autologous TAMs. Together, we demonstrated that monocyte/macrophages presented essential antigen-presentation and costimulatory roles in CD8 T cell-mediated S. salivarius-specific granzyme B responses, and the polarization of macrophages could influence the potency of CD8 T cell responses.

Abstract: Summary
The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) αβγ heterotrimer regulates cellular energy homeostasis with tissue-specific isoform distribution. Small-molecule activation of skeletal muscle α2β2 AMPK complexes may prove a valuable treatment strategy for type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance. Herein, we report the small-molecule SC4 is a potent, direct AMPK activator that preferentially activates α2 complexes and stimulates skeletal muscle glucose uptake. In parallel with the term secretagog, we propose “importagog” to define a substance that induces or augments cellular uptake of another substance. Three-dimensional structures of the glucose importagog SC4 bound to activated α2β2γ1 and α2β1γ1 complexes reveal binding determinants, in particular a key interaction between the SC4 imidazopyridine 4′-nitrogen and β2-Asp111, which provide a design paradigm for β2-AMPK therapeutics. The α2β2γ1/SC4 structure reveals an interaction between a β2 N-terminal α helix and the α2 autoinhibitory domain. Our results provide a structure-function guide to accelerate development of potent, but importantly tissue-specific, β2-AMPK therapeutics.

Abstract: Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) differentiated into cardiomyocytes (CM) often develop into complex 3D structures that are composed of various cardiac cell types. Conventional methods to study the electrophysiology of cardiac cells are patch clamp and microelectrode array (MEAs) analyses. However, these methods are not suitable to investigate the contractile features of 3D cardiac clusters that detach from the surface of the culture dishes during differentiation. To overcome this problem, we developed a video-based motion detection software relying on the optical flow by Farnebäck that we call cBRA (cardiac beat rate analyzer). The beating characteristics of the differentiated cardiac clusters were calculated based on the local displacement between two subsequent images. Two differentiation protocols, which profoundly differ in the morphology of cardiac clusters generated and in the expression of cardiac markers, were used and the resulting CM were characterized. Despite these differences, beat rates and beating variabilities could be reliably determined using cBRA. Likewise, stimulation of β-adrenoreceptors by isoproterenol could easily be identified in the hESC-derived CM. Since even subtle changes in the beating features are detectable, this method is suitable for high throughput cardiotoxicity screenings.

Abstract: SIRT3, a mitochondrial NAD+-dependent deacetylase, has been reported to restrain prostate cancer growth both in vitro and in vivo, however, its role in metastatic prostate cancer has not been revealed. In this study, we reported that SIRT3 inhibited the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and migration of prostatic cancer cells in vitro and their metastasis in vivo. Consistently, based on analyses of tissue microarray and microarray datasets, lower SIRT3 expression level was correlated with higher prostate cancer Gleason scores, and SIRT3 expression were significantly decreased in metastatic tissues compared with prostate tumor tissues. Mechanistically, SIRT3 promoted FOXO3A expression by attenuating Wnt/β-catenin pathway, thereby inhibiting EMT and migration of prostate cancer cells. Indeed, SIRT3's inhibitory effect on EMT and migration of prostate cancer cells can be rescued after applying Wnt/β-catenin pathway activator LiCl, or boosted by wnt inhibitor XAV939. Together, this study revealed a novel mechanism for prostate cancer metastasis that involves SIRT3/ Wnt/β-catenin/ FOXO3A signaling to modulate EMT and cell migration.

Abstract: Summary
Plants initiate immunity by cell-surface pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), which perceive non-self molecules. PRRs are predominantly receptor serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) kinases that are evolutionarily related to animal interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)/Pelle-soluble kinases. However, how the activity of these receptor kinases is modulated remains poorly understood. We report that the Arabidopsis PRR chitin elicitor receptor kinase 1 (CERK1) is autophosphorylated in unstimulated cells at tyrosine428 (Tyr428), a modification that is required for CERK1 activation upon binding to the fungal cell wall component chitin. Upon chitin activation, CERK1 recruits the CERK1-interacting protein phosphatase 1 (CIPP1), a predicted Ser/Thr phosphatase, to dephosphorylate Tyr428 and dampen CERK1 signaling. CIPP1 subsequently dissociates from Tyr428-dephosphorylated CERK1, allowing CERK1 to regain Tyr428 autophosphorylation and return to a standby state. This work sheds light onto plant chitin signaling and shows that a receptor kinase and phosphatase can coordinately regulate signal transduction of a receptor kinase through a phosphorylation cycle.

Abstract: It has been found that Helicobacter pylori （H. pylori）is not only the main cause of gastric cancer, but also closely related to its metastasis. E-cadherin cleavage induced by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) plays an important role in the tumor metastasis. In the present study, we investigated the role of microRNAs-MMPs-E-cadherin in migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells treated with H. pylori. The results showed that H. pylori induced migration and invasion of SGC-7901 cells with a down-regulation of E-cadherin expression, which were abolished by MMPs knock down, E-cadherin overexpression, mimics of miR128 and miR148a. MiR128/miR148a inhibitors restored MMP-3/MMP-7 expression, down-regulated E-cadherin level, and accelerated cellular migration and invasion. This study suggests that H. pylori induces migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells through reduction of E-cadherin function by activation of MMP-3, − 7. The present results also suggest that the activated MMPs/E-cadherin pathway is related with down-regulation of miR128/miR148a in the human gastric cancer cells infected with H. pylori.

Abstract: Summary
Proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) technology has emerged over the last two decades as a powerful tool for targeted degradation of endogenous proteins. Herein we describe the development of PROTACs for receptor tyrosine kinases, a protein family yet to be targeted for induced protein degradation. The use of VHL-recruiting PROTACs against this protein family reveals several advantages of degradation over inhibition alone: direct comparisons of fully functional, target-degrading PROTACs with target-inhibiting variants that contain an inactivated E3 ligase-recruiting ligand show that degradation leads to more potent inhibition of cell proliferation and a more durable and sustained downstream signaling response, and thus addresses the kinome rewiring challenge seen with many receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Combined, these findings demonstrate the ability to target receptor tyrosine kinases for degradation using the PROTAC technology and outline the advantages of this degradation-based approach.

Abstract: Summary
Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are the projection neurons of the retina and transmit visual information to postsynaptic targets in the brain. While this function is shared among nearly all RGCs, this class of cell is remarkably diverse, comprised of multiple subtypes. Previous efforts have identified numerous RGC subtypes in animal models, but less attention has been paid to human RGCs. Thus, efforts of this study examined the diversity of RGCs differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and characterized defined subtypes through the expression of subtype-specific markers. Further investigation of these subtypes was achieved using single-cell transcriptomics, confirming the combinatorial expression of molecular markers associated with these subtypes, and also provided insight into more subtype-specific markers. Thus, the results of this study describe the derivation of RGC subtypes from hPSCs and will support the future exploration of phenotypic and functional diversity within human RGCs.

Abstract: Summary
Brain neurogenesis is severely impaired following exposure to ionizing radiation (IR). We and others have shown that the expression of the tumor suppressor gene p16INK4a is increased in tissues exposed to IR and thus hypothesized that its expression could limit neurogenesis in the irradiated brain. Here, we found that exposure to IR leads to persistent DNA damage and the expression of p16INK4a in the hippocampus and subventricular zone regions. This was accompanied by a decline in neurogenesis, as determined by doublecortin expression and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, an effect partially restored in Ink4a/arf-null mice. Increased neurogenesis in the absence of INK4a/ARF expression was independent of apoptosis and activation of the microglia. Moreover, treatment of irradiated mice with a superoxide dismutase mimetic or clearance of p16INK4a-expressing cells using mouse genetics failed to increase neurogenesis. In conclusion, our results suggest that IR-induced p16INK4a expression is a mechanism that limits neurogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Allogeneic mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) have been widely studied as an alternative cell source for regenerative medicine. Here, we report a long-term follow-up study of allogeneic bone marrow and/or umbilical cord MSC transplantation (MSCT) in severe and drug-refractory systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. Eighty-one patients were enrolled, and the 5-year overall survival rate was 84% (68/81) after MSCT. At 5-year follow-up, 27% of patients (22/81) were in complete clinical remission and another 7% (6/81) were in partial clinical remission, with a 5-year disease remission rate of 34% (28/81). In total, 37 patients had achieved clinical remission and then 9 patients subsequently relapsed, with 5-year overall rate of relapse of 24% (9/37). SLE Disease Activity Index scores, serum albumin, complement C3, peripheral white blood cell, and platelet numbers, as well as proteinuria levels, continued to improve during the follow-up. Our results demonstrated that allogeneic MSCT is safe and resulted in long-term clinical remission in SLE patients.

Abstract: As the population ages, there is a critical need to uncover strategies to combat diseases of aging. Studies in the soil-dwelling nematode Caenorhabditis elegans have demonstrated the protective effects of coffee extract and caffeine in promoting the induction of conserved longevity pathways including the insulin-like signaling pathway and the oxidative stress response. We were interested in determining the effects of coffee and caffeine treatment on the regulation of the heat shock response. The heat shock response is a highly conserved cellular response that functions as a cytoprotective mechanism during stress, mediated by the heat shock transcription factor HSF-1. In the worm, HSF-1 not only promotes protection against stress but is also essential for development and longevity. Induction of the heat shock response has been suggested to be beneficial for diseases of protein conformation by preventing protein misfolding and aggregation, and as such has been proposed as a therapeutic target for age-associated neurodegenerative disorders. In this study, we demonstrate that coffee is a potent, dose-dependent, inducer of the heat shock response. Treatment with a moderate dose of pure caffeine was also able to induce the heat shock response, indicating caffeine as an important component within coffee for producing this response. The effects that we observe with both coffee and pure caffeine on the heat shock response are both dependent on HSF-1. In a C. elegans Huntington’s disease model, worms treated with caffeine were protected from polyglutamine aggregates and toxicity, an effect that was also HSF-1-dependent. In conclusion, these results demonstrate caffeinated coffee, and pure caffeine, as protective substances that promote proteostasis through induction of the heat shock response.

Abstract: The poor outcome of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is mainly due to the development of fast growth, invasion and metastasis. The role of TET2 has been implicated in some cancer types, but its role and mechanisms in HCC remains elusive. In this study, our findings indicated that TET2 expression frequently increased in HCC and that TET2 expressional upregulation correlated with HCC progression. TET2 knockdown inhibited HCC cells proliferation in vitro and growth in vivo, and inhibited the invasion potential of HCC cells. Mechanically, TET2 knockdown upregulated E-cadherin expression and then attenuated β-catenin transactivation in HCC cells. TET2 repressed E-cadherin expression via recruited HDAC1 to E-cadherin promoter to reduce the H3K9Ac and H4K16Ac levels. Moreover, β-catenin signaling transcriptionally regulated TET2 expression to form a positive feedback in HCC cells. These findings indicate that the dysregulation of TET2/E-cadherin/β-catenin regulatory loop is a critical oncogenic event in HCC progression.

Abstract: The increased stiffness of the extracellular microenvironment observed in cancer and atherosclerosis is thought to regulate the activation of tissue-resident immune cells. However, it remains to be determined whether such substrate stiffness affects macrophage activation phenotypes. Here, we have studied the impact of substrate stiffness on in vitro activation phenotypes of the human monocyte cell line THP-1. THP-1 cells were activated while being cultured on 1%, 4%, 10% agarose gel (soft substrate) or on a plastic plate (stiff substrate). We have shown that a soft, versus a stiff, substrate attenuates the pro-inflammatory activity of M1 promoting-activated THP-1 cells. In addition, we have found that M1-related marker expression and phagocytic activity was lower in THP-1 cells activated on a soft substrate compared to cells on stiff substrates. THP-1 cells alternatively activated on soft substrates showed enhanced M2-like phenotypes. We have found that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) expression was up-regulated in THP-1 cells activated on a soft substrate. We have shown that the PPARγ antagonist GW9662 partially suppresses M2-like activation of THP-1 cells activated on a soft substrate. Substrate stiffness is, therefore, an important factor in regulating the balance of the pro-inflammatory M1 and anti-inflammatory M2 activation phenotypes.

Abstract: Summary
Disorders of the biliary epithelium, known as cholangiopathies, cause severe and irreversible liver diseases. The limited accessibility of bile duct precludes modeling of several cholangiocyte-mediated diseases. Therefore, novel approaches for obtaining functional cholangiocytes with high purity are needed. Previous work has shown that the combination of Hnf1β and Foxa3 could directly convert mouse fibroblasts into bipotential hepatic stem cell-like cells, termed iHepSCs. However, the efficiency of converting fibroblasts into iHepSCs is low, and these iHepSCs exhibit extremely low differentiation potential into cholangiocytes, thus hindering the translation of iHepSCs to the clinic. Here, we describe that the expression of Hnf1α and Foxa3 dramatically facilitates the robust generation of iHepSCs. Notably, prolonged in vitro culture of Hnf1α- and Foxa3-derived iHepSCs induces a Notch signaling-mediated secondary conversion into cholangiocyte progenitor-like cells that display dramatically enhanced differentiation capacity into mature cholangiocytes. Our study provides a robust two-step approach for obtaining cholangiocyte progenitor-like cells using defined factors.

Abstract: Dendritic spines, the postsynaptic compartments at excitatory synapses, are capable of changing their shape and size to modulate synaptic transmission. The actin cytoskeleton and a variety of actin-binding proteins play a critical role in the dynamics of dendritic spines. Class I myosins are monomeric motor proteins that move along actin filaments using the energy of ATP hydrolysis. Of these class I myosins, myosin Id, the mammalian homolog of Drosophila Myo31DF, has been reported to be expressed in neurons, whereas its subcellular localization in neurons remained unknown. Here, we investigated the subcellular localization of myosin Id and determined the domain responsible for it. We found that myosin Id is enriched in the F-actin-rich pseudopodia of HEK293T cells and in the dendritic spines of primary hippocampal neurons. Both deletion and substitution of the tail homology 1 (TH1) domain drastically diminishes its colocalization with F-actin. In addition, the mutant form lacking the TH1 domain is less distributed in dendritic spines than is the full-length form. Taken together, our findings reveal that myosin Id localizes in dendritic spines through the TH1 domain.

Abstract: Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is a principal structural protein of caveolae. Cav-1 has been implicated in cancer progression, but its precise functional roles in pituitary adenoma cells remain largely unclear. In this study, we evidenced that the level of cav-1 was elevated in the invasive pituitary adenoma. Cav-1 knockdown restrained the migration and invasion of pituitary adenoma cells. In cav-1-depleting cells, the expression of miR-145, miR-124 and miR-183 were up-regulated. Further investigation showed that cav-1 knockdown inhibited the nuclear translocation of EGR1, reducing the interaction between EGR1 and KLF5. The resulting free KLF5 promoted the expression of miR-145, miR-124 and miR-183 by binding to their promoters, which was blocked by EGR1. Luciferase reporter assay indicated that miR-145 targeted FSCN1, miR-124 targeted PTTG1IP, and miR-183 targeted EZR in pituitary adenoma cells, respectively. Knockdown of FSCN1, PTTG1IP or EZR suppressed the migration and invasion of pituitary adenoma cells. In conclusion, our data suggested that the elevated cav-1 promoted pituitary adenoma cells migration and invasion by regulating the interaction between EGR1 and KLF5.

Abstract: Summary
Aberrant hedgehog (Hh) signaling contributes to the pathogenesis of multiple cancers. Available inhibitors target Smoothened (Smo), which can acquire mutations causing drug resistance. Thus, compounds that inhibit Hh signaling downstream of Smo are urgently needed. We identified dynarrestin, a novel inhibitor of cytoplasmic dyneins 1 and 2. Dynarrestin acts reversibly to inhibit cytoplasmic dynein 1-dependent microtubule binding and motility in vitro without affecting ATP hydrolysis. It rapidly and reversibly inhibits endosome movement in living cells and perturbs mitosis by inducing spindle misorientation and pseudoprometaphase delay. Dynarrestin reversibly inhibits cytoplasmic dynein 2-dependent intraflagellar transport (IFT) of the cargo IFT88 and flux of Smo within cilia without interfering with ciliogenesis and suppresses Hh-dependent proliferation of neuronal precursors and tumor cells. As such, dynarrestin is a valuable tool for probing cytoplasmic dynein-dependent cellular processes and a promising compound for medicinal chemistry programs aimed at development of anti-cancer drugs.

Abstract: Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) injury induces excessive cellular apoptosis and contributes significantly to final infarct size. We previously demonstrated that a nuclear receptor, Farnesoid X receptor (FXR), plays a crucial role in mediating myocardial apoptosis. The FXR functions are regulated by post translational modifications (PTM). However, whether the proapoptotic effect of FXR in MI/R injury is regulated by PTM remains unclear. Here, we aimed to study the effect of SUMOylation, a PTM involved in the pathogenesis of MI/R injury per se, on the proapoptotic effect of FXR in MI/R injury. We observed that FXR could be SUMOylated in heart tissues, and FXR SUMOylation levels were downregulated in ischemia reperfused myocardium. By overexpression of SUMOylation-defective FXR mutant, it was demonstrated that decreased SUMOylation augmented the detrimental effect of FXR, via activation of mitochondrial apoptosis pathway and autophagy dysfunction in MI/R injury. Further mechanistic studies suggested that decreased SUMOylation levels increased the transcription activity of FXR, and the subsequently upregulated FXR target gene SHP mediated the proapoptotic effects of FXR. Taken together, we provided the first evidence that the cardiac effects of FXR could be regulated by SUMOylation, and that manipulating FXR SUMOylation levels may hold therapeutic promise for constraining MI/R injury.

Abstract: Dysregulated noncoding RNAs have been observed in diverse cancers. MIR458K is frequently amplified in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). However, the expression, clinical significances, and action mechanisms of miR-548k in ESCC are still unclear. In this study, we found that miR-548k is significantly up-regulated in ESCC tissues and cell lines. Up-regulated miR-548k expression is significantly correlated with advanced invasion depth, lymph node metastasis, advanced TNM stage, and poor overall survival. Gain-of- and loss-of-function assays demonstrated that miR-548k promotes the proliferation and migration of ESCC cells in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, we found that miR-548k directly targets and represses the expression of long noncoding RNA-LET (lncRNA-LET), and further down-regulates p53 and up-regulates NF90. In addition, we found that lncRNA-LET is down-regulated and inversely correlated with miR-548k in ESCC. Down-regulated lncRNA-LET also indicated poor overall survival of ESCC patients. Functional assays demonstrated that lncRNA-LET inhibits the proliferation and migration of ESCC cells, and the effects of miR-548k on ESCC are dependent on the negative regulation of lncRNA-LET. In summary, our data revealed the critical roles of miR-548k-lncRNA-LET regulation axis in ESCC and suggested that the miR-548k-lncRNA-LET regulation axis may be promising prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for ESCC.

Abstract: Summary
The HIV-1 core consists of capsid proteins (CA) surrounding viral genomic RNA. After virus-cell fusion, the core enters the cytoplasm and the capsid shell is lost through uncoating. CA loss precedes nuclear import and HIV integration into the host genome, but the timing and location of uncoating remain unclear. By visualizing single HIV-1 infection, we find that CA is required for core docking at the nuclear envelope (NE), whereas early uncoating in the cytoplasm promotes proteasomal degradation of viral complexes. Only docked cores exhibiting accelerated loss of CA at the NE enter the nucleus. Interestingly, a CA mutation (N74D) altering virus engagement of host factors involved in nuclear transport does not alter the uncoating site at the NE but reduces the nuclear penetration depth. Thus, CA protects HIV-1 complexes from degradation, mediates docking at the nuclear pore before uncoating, and determines the depth of nuclear penetration en route to integration.

Due to its almost no expression in normal tissues and its tumor-promoting effects, FAPα has been studied as a novel potential target for antitumor therapy. However, the regulation mechanism on FAPα expression is poorly understood. In this study, we found that overexpression of snail significantly increased the mRNA and protein expression levels of FAPα in malignant melanoma B16 and SK-MEL-28 cells. Overexpression of snail increased FAPα promoter activity remarkably. Snail could directly bind to FAPα promoter to regulate FAPα expression. Moreover, snail expression was positively correlated to FAPα expression in human cutaneous malignant melanoma. Furthermore, knockdown of FAPα markedly reduced snail-induced cell migration. Overall, our findings provide a novel regulation mechanism on FAPα expression and highlight the role of snail/FAPα axis as a novel target for melanoma treatment.

Abstract: Lung cancer is the most frequent cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, but its molecular pathogenesis is poorly understood. The tumor suppressor candidate 3 (TUSC3) gene is located on chromosome 8p22 and is universally acknowledged as a cancer suppressor. However, our research has demonstrated that TUSC3 expression is significantly upregulated in non-small-cell lung cancer compared to benign controls. In this study, we analyzed the consequences of TUSC3 knockdown or overexpression on the biological functions of non-small-cell lung cancer cell lines. To identify the molecules and signaling pathways with which TUSC3 might interact, we completed immunoblotting, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, microarray, co-immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence assays. We demonstrated that TUSC3 knockdown leads to decreased proliferation, migration, and invasion, and reduced xenograft tumor growth of non-small-cell lung cancer cell lines, whereas opposite results were observed with overexpression of TUSC3. In addition, TUSC3 knockdown suppressed epithelial-mesenchymal transition by downregulating the expression of claudin-1, which plays an indispensable role in EMT progress. On the contrary, overexpression of TUSC3 significantly enhanced EMT progress by upregulating claudin-1 expression. Overall, our observations suggest that TUSC3 accelerates cancer growth and induces the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in non-small-cell lung cancer cells; we also identified claudin-1 as a target of TUSC3.

Abstract: Import of the polyamine spermine from the extracellular environment depends on the presence of cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans, such as glypican-1. This proteoglycan is internalized by endocytosis, releases its heparan sulfate chains in endosomes by a nitric oxide-, copper- and amyloid precursor protein-dependent mechanism, then penetrates the membrane and is transported to the nucleus and then to autophagosomes. This process is spontaneous or induced by ascorbate depending on the growth-state of the cell. Here, we have explored possible connections between the heparan sulfate traffic route and spermine uptake and delivery in wild-type and Tg2576 mouse fibroblasts. Cells were examined by deconvolution immunofluorescence microscopy. The antibodies used were specific for spermine, glypican-1-derived heparan sulfate, Rab7, nucleolin and a marker for autophagosomes. Endogenous immunostainable spermine was primarily associated with autophagosomes. When spermine synthesis was inhibited, imported spermine appeared in Rab7-positive endosomes. When ascorbate was added, heparan sulfate and spermine were transported to the nucleus where they colocalized with nucleolin. Spermine also appeared in autophagosomes. In a pulse-chase experiment, heparan sulfate and spermine were first arrested in late endosomes by actinomycin D treatment. During the chase, when arrest was abolished, heparan sulfate and spermine were both transported to the nucleus and targeted nucleolin. In amyloid precursor protein-/--fibroblasts, ascorbate failed to induce release of heparan sulfate and spermine remained in the endosomes. We propose that cell surface glypican-1 carries spermine to the endosomes and that the released heparan sulfate carries spermine across the membrane into the cytosol and then to the nucleus.

Abstract: C3HC4-type zinc finger proteins are known to play important roles in various plant processes including regulation of growth and development, signaling networks, responses to abiotic stresses etc. The current study identifies and explores the involvement of TaZnF in plant stress response, mainly heat stress. TaZnF belongs to C4HC3-type zinc finger transcription factor. Phylogenetic analysis of TaZnF revealed strong sequence similarity to Brachypodium distachyon, a model system for crop species. Gene expression studies have revealed its role under diverse stress conditions including heat and cold conditions. The transcript level of TaZnF was found to be highest in seed and starts at the post anthesis period 3-5DAA, a more sensitive stage resulting in a negative influence on the yield of crop species. TaZnF possesses transcriptional activity. Overexpression of TaZnF in Arabidopsis thaliana conferred improved tolerance to both basal and high-temperature stress as observed from various assays examining their growth and development. The transgenics were recovered and showed early flowering compared to wild-type. They had larger primary roots, more lateral branching, bigger, and more numerous leaves, resulting in heavier fresh weight. Enhanced growth and early recovery resulted in bigger plants with more yield. Additionally, the overexpression Arabidopsis transgenics also showed considerable tolerance to cold and oxidative stress. These observations suggest that TaZnF acts as a positive regulator of thermal stress and thus can be of great significance in understanding and improving temperature stress tolerance in plants.

Abstract: Summary
Recently, the palbociclib/letrozole combination therapy was granted accelerated US FDA approval for the treatment of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. Since the underlying metabolic effects of these drugs are yet unknown, we investigated their synergism at the metabolome level in MCF-7 cells. As xenoestrogens interact with the ER, we additionally aimed at deciphering the impact of the phytoestrogen genistein and the estrogenic mycotoxin zearalenone. A global metabolomics approach was applied to unravel metabolite and pathway modifications. The results clearly showed that the combined effects of palbociclib and letrozole on cellular metabolism were far more pronounced than that of each agent alone and potently influenced by xenoestrogens. This behavior was confirmed in proliferation experiments and functional assays. Specifically, amino acids and central carbon metabolites were attenuated, while higher abundances were observed for fatty acids and most nucleic acid-related metabolites. Interestingly, exposure to model xenoestrogens appeared to counteract these effects.

Abstract: Autophagy is a highly dynamic process characterized with the term of autophagic flux. In the present study, we developed a quantifiable luciferase reporter system to measure the capacity as well as the dynamics of autophagic flux. Briefly, a luciferase variant of Luc2p was fused with p62/SQSTM1 or its UBA domain deletion mutant (p62ΔU) and transfected into cells. The expressed Luc2p-p62 fusion protein was primarily degraded via autophagy, while Luc2p-p62ΔU was employed as a normalization control due to its resistance to autophagic degradation. The luciferase activity of the lysates from two parallel populations of glioma cells expressing either Luc2p-p62 or Luc2p-p62ΔU was determined and the ratio of Luc2p-p62ΔU/Luc2p-p62 was used to assay the autophagic flux. By this approach, the induction of autophagy was manifested as an increased Luc2p-p62ΔU/Luc2p-p62 ratio, which could be neutralized by autophagy inhibitors or knockdown of ATG5. The performance of our autophagic flux detection system was comparable to a recently reported GFP-LC3-RFP-LC3ΔG probe. We tested the system in TMZ treated glioma cells, and found that coadministration of chloroquine to attenuate cellular autophagic flux significantly improved the TMZ efficacy by triggering more early apoptosis. Collectively, our luciferase-based autophagic flux assay may serve as a useful alternative yet sensitive method for autophagic flux detection in tumor cells.

Abstract: Directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells provides an accessible system to model development. However, the distinct cell types that emerge, their dynamics, and their relationship to progenitors in the early embryo has been difficult to decipher because of the cellular heterogeneity inherent to differentiation. Here, we used a combination of bulk RNA-Seq, single cell RNA-Seq, and bioinformatics analyses to dissect the cell types that emerge during directed differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells as embryoid bodies and we compared them to spatially and temporally resolved transcriptional profiles of early embryos. Our single cell analyses of the day 4 embryoid bodies revealed three populations which had retained related yet distinct pluripotent signatures that resemble the pre- or post-implantation epiblast, one population of presumptive neuroectoderm, one population of mesendoderm, and four populations of neural progenitors. By day 6, the neural progenitors predominated the embryoid bodies, but both a small population of pluripotent-like cells and an anterior mesoderm-like Brachyury-expressing population were present. By comparing the day 4 and day 6 populations, we identified candidate differentiation paths, transcription factors, and signaling pathways that mark the in vitro correlate of the transition from the mid-to-late primitive streak stage.

Abstract: Summary
RNA viruses exist in genetically diverse populations due to high levels of mutations, many of which reduce viral fitness. Interestingly, intestinal bacteria can promote infection of several mammalian enteric RNA viruses, but the mechanisms and consequences are unclear. We screened a panel of 41 bacterial strains as a platform to determine how different bacteria impact infection of poliovirus, a model enteric virus. Most bacterial strains, including those extracted from cecal contents of mice, bound poliovirus, with each bacterium binding multiple virions. Certain bacterial strains increased viral co-infection of mammalian cells even at a low virus-to-host cell ratio. Bacteria-mediated viral co-infection correlated with bacterial adherence to cells. Importantly, bacterial strains that induced viral co-infection facilitated genetic recombination between two different viruses, thereby removing deleterious mutations and restoring viral fitness. Thus, bacteria-virus interactions may increase viral fitness through viral recombination at initial sites of infection, potentially limiting abortive infections.

Abstract: The effects of Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) differs in various types of cancers. However, its function in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not well-explored. In this study, we investigated the effect of HDAC inhibition on EMT in HCC cells by using trichostatin A (TSA) and valproic acid (VPA). The results showed that TSA/VPA significantly induced EMT phenotype, as demonstrated by the decreased level of E-cadherin, increased level of N-cadherin, vimentin, Twist and snail, and enhanced capacity of cell migration and invasion. In addition, CCR7 was speculated and confirmed as a function target of HDAC inhibition. CCR7 promotes the progression of HCC and is associated with poor survival. Knockdown of CCR7 significantly attenuated the effect of TSA on EMT. Moreover, our results demonstrated that HDAC inhibition up-regulates CCR7 via reversing the promoter hypoacetylation and increasing CCR7 transcription. Taken together, our study has identified the function of HDAC in EMT of HCC and suggested a novel mechanism through which TSA/VPA exerts its carcinogenic roles in HCC. HDAC inhibitors require careful caution before their application as new anticancer drugs.

Abstract: Summary
The intestinal microbiota provides colonization resistance against pathogens, limiting pathogen expansion and transmission. These microbiota-mediated mechanisms were previously identified by observing loss of colonization resistance after antibiotic treatment or dietary changes, which severely disrupt microbiota communities. We identify a microbiota-mediated mechanism of colonization resistance against Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) by comparing high-complexity commensal communities with different levels of colonization resistance. Using inbred mouse strains with different infection dynamics and S. Typhimurium intestinal burdens, we demonstrate that Bacteroides species mediate colonization resistance against S. Typhimurium by producing the short-chain fatty acid propionate. Propionate directly inhibits pathogen growth in vitro by disrupting intracellular pH homeostasis, and chemically increasing intestinal propionate levels protects mice from S. Typhimurium. In addition, administering susceptible mice Bacteroides, but not a propionate-production mutant, confers resistance to S. Typhimurium. This work provides mechanistic understanding into the role of individualized microbial communities in host-to-host variability of pathogen transmission.

Abstract: Two different types of FcRs for IgG are constitutively expressed on the surface of human neutrophils, namely, FcγRIIA (CD32a) and FcγRIIIB (CD16b). Unlike FcγRIIA, FcγRIIIb is GPI anchored to the cell membrane and its signal transduction is still ambiguous. To further understand the signal transduction of CD16b, we compared neutrophil cytokine expression and apoptosis by the cross-linking of CD32a and CD16b respectively. We found that both CD32a and CD16b crosslinking can activate neutrophils, but did not exactly share cytokine expression profiles. On the other hand, CD16b cross-linking retarded neutrophil apoptosis while CD32a promoted it. By interrupting the lipid raft with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) and inhibiting the ITAM-SYK pathway with an SYK inhibitor (piceatannol), we found reduced apoptosis was at least partially mediated by lipid raft structure, but not the ITAM-SYK pathway. Additionally, CD16b but not CD32a cross-linking triggered SHP-2 phosphorylation and led to its translocation into lipid rafts. SHP-2 phosphorylation and translocation were inhibited by MβCD. Moreover, pre-inhibition of SHP-2 by a specific inhibitor (SHP099) converted IL-10 and SOCS3 expression level and promoted neutrophil apoptosis after CD16b crosslinking. In conclusion, these results, for the first time, collectively indicate that SHP-2 is activated by CD16b crosslinking in neutrophils and functions as a component of the raft-mediated signaling pathway.

Abstract: Increasing evidence has suggested that Capn4 is upregulated and functions as a potential tumor promoter in several human cancer types. However, the potential biological roles and regulatory mechanisms of Capn4 in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unclear. Here, we found that Capn4 expression was elevated in CRC tissues than adjacent noncancerous tissues. Additionally, we also found that overexpression of Capn4 is significantly correlated with tumor progression and poor survival in CRC patients. Furthermore, our experimental data revealed that increased expression of Capn4 was observed in CRC cell lines and ectopic expression of Capn4 significantly enhanced in vitro cell proliferation, whereas knockdown of Capn4 suppressed CRC cells growth in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, our results indicate that Capn4 promotes cell proliferation by increasing MAPK7 expression, which has been reported to control the proliferation of many cancers. Mechanistically, Capn4 upregulates MAPK7 expression through activation of the Wnt/β-Catenin pathway in CRC cells. Therefore, we identified a tumorigenic role of Capn4 in CRC and suggested a potential therapeutic target for CRC patients.

Abstract: Summary
Defective placentation is the underlying cause of various pregnancy complications, such as severe intrauterine growth restriction and preeclampsia. However, studies on human placental development are hampered by the lack of a self-renewing in vitro model that would recapitulate formation of trophoblast progenitors and differentiated subtypes, syncytiotrophoblast (STB) and invasive extravillous trophoblast (EVT), in a 3D orientation. Hence, we established long-term expanding organoid cultures from purified first-trimester cytotrophoblasts (CTBs). Molecular analyses revealed that the CTB organoid cultures (CTB-ORGs) express markers of trophoblast stemness and proliferation and are highly similar to primary CTBs at the level of global gene expression. Whereas CTB-ORGs spontaneously generated STBs, withdrawal of factors for self-renewal induced trophoblast outgrowth, expressing the EVT progenitor marker NOTCH1, and provoked formation of adjacent, distally located HLA-G+ EVTs. In summary, we established human CTB-ORGs that grow and differentiate under defined culture conditions, allowing future human placental disease modeling.

Abstract: Background
Cognitive impairment is a brain dysfunction characterized by neuropsychological deficits in attention, working memory, and executive function. Maternal obesity and consumption of a high-fat diet (HFD) in the offspring has been suggested to have detrimental consequences for offspring cognitive function through its effect on the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Therefore, our study aimed to investigate the effects of maternal obesity and offspring HFD exposure on the brain metabolome of the offspring.
Methods
In our pilot study, a LepRdb/+ mouse model was used to model pre-pregnancy maternal obesity and the c57bl/6 wildtype was used as a control group. Offspring were fed either a HFD or a low-fat control diet (LFD) after weaning (between 8 and 10 weeks). The Mirrors water maze was performed between 28 and 30 weeks to measure cognitive function. Fatty acid metabolomic profiles of the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus from the offspring at 30–32 weeks were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
Results
The memory of male offspring from obese maternal mice, consuming a HFD post-weaning, was significantly impaired when compared to the control offspring mice. No significant differences were observed in female offspring. In male mice, the fatty acid metabolites in the prefrontal cortex were most affected by maternal obesity, whereas, the fatty acid metabolites in the hippocampus were most affected by the offspring's diet. Hexadecanoic acid and octadecanoic acid were significantly affected in both the hippocampus and pre-frontal cortex, as a result of maternal obesity and a HFD in the offspring.
Conclusion
Our findings suggest that the combination of maternal obesity and HFD in the offspring can result in spatial cognitive deficiency in the male offspring, by influencing the fatty acid metabolite profiles in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Further research is needed to validate the results of our pilot study.

Abstract: Researchers have been using lab-on-a-chip systems to isolate factors for study, simulate laboratory analysis and model cellular, tissue and organ level processes. The technology is increasing rapidly, but the bone field has been slow to keep pace. Novel models are needed that have the power and flexibility to investigate the elegant and synchronous multicellular interactions that occur in normal bone turnover and in disease states in which remodeling is implicated. By removing temporal and spatial limitations and enabling quantification of functional outcomes, the platforms should provide unique environments that are more biomimetic than single cell type systems while minimizing complex systemic effects of in vivo models. This manuscript details the development and characterization of lab-on-a-chip platforms for stimulating osteocytes and quantifying bone remodeling. Our platforms provide the foundation for a model that can be used to investigate remodeling interactions as a whole or as a standard mechanotransduction tool by which isolated activity can be quantified as a function of load.

Abstract: Summary
Circulating systemic factors can regulate adult neural stem cell (NSC) biology, but the identity of these circulating cues is still being defined. Here, we have focused on the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), since increased circulating levels of IL-6 are associated with neural pathologies such as autism and bipolar disorder. We show that IL-6 promotes proliferation of post-natal murine forebrain NSCs and that, when the IL-6 receptor is inducibly knocked out in post-natal or adult neural precursors, this causes a long-term decrease in forebrain NSCs. Moreover, a transient circulating surge of IL-6 in perinatal or adult mice causes an acute increase in neural precursor proliferation followed by long-term depletion of adult NSC pools. Thus, IL-6 signaling is both necessary and sufficient for adult NSC self-renewal, and acute perturbations in circulating IL-6, as observed in many pathological situations, have long-lasting effects on the size of adult NSC pools.

Abstract: The failure of neuronal proliferation and differentiation is a major obstacle for neural repair and regeneration after traumatic central nervous system (CNS) injury. PTEN acts as an intrinsic brake on the neuronal cells, but its roles and mechanism still remain to be clarified. Herein, for the first time we confirmed that PTEN had a dual effect on the neuronal cells in vitro. Firstly, we found that PTEN knockdown significantly promoted cell proliferation and differentiation. Then, PTEN knockdown activated PI3K/Akt and Wnt/β-catenin pathways in vitro. Further evidence revealed that GSK3β as a key node involved in PTEN controlling cell proliferation and differentiation in PC12 cells. In addition, we identified that PTEN-GSK3β pathway modulated neuronal proliferation via β-catenin. Taken together, these results suggest that PTEN silencing enhances neuronal proliferation and differentiation by activating PI3K/Akt/GSK3β pathway that it may be a promising therapeutic approach for CNS injury.

Abstract: MicroRNAs play a crucial role in the progression of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of miR-361-5p on the proliferation, migration and apoptosis of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) that under the treatment of hypoxia and explore the underlying mechanisms. The results proved that hypoxia noticeably up-regulated the expression of miR-361-5p in PASMCs in comparison to the normoxia-treated cells, while TNF-α and IL-6 stimulation had no obvious effects on miR-361-5p level. Hypoxia induced miR-361-5p elevation in a HIF-1α-dependent manner. Inhibition of miR-361-5p dramatically inhibited hypoxia-induced cell proliferation and migration. miR-361-5p inhibition also rescued hypoxia exposure caused suppression of PASMCs apoptosis. In addition, the results showed that ABCA1 was a direct target of miR-361-5p and was down-regulated in hypoxia-induced PASMCs. Hypoxia and TNF-α or IL-6 stimulation significantly inhibited ABCA1 expression. In addition, overexpression of ABCA1 enhanced the effect of miR-361-5p on hPASMCs. Furthermore, the inhibition of miR-361-5p significantly down-regulated the expression level of p-JAK2 and p-STAT3. In conclusion, it may suggest that the suppression of miR-361-5p suppressed PASMC survival and migration by targeting ABCA1 and inhibiting the JAK2/STAT3 pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Salmonella Typhi is the cause of typhoid fever, a major global health concern. An essential virulence factor of this pathogen is typhoid toxin. In contrast to most AB-type toxins, typhoid toxin is exclusively expressed by intracellular bacteria. The regulatory networks that ensure this unique gene expression pattern are unknown. Here, we developed FAST-INSeq, a genome-wide screening approach to identify S. Typhi genes required for typhoid toxin expression within infected cells. We find that typhoid toxin expression is controlled by a silencing and counter-silencing mechanism through the opposing actions of the PhoP/PhoQ two-component regulatory system and the histone-like protein H-NS. The screen also identified bacterial mutants that alter the proportion of intracellular S. Typhi that reside within an intravacuolar environment, which was essential for toxin expression. Collectively, these data describe a regulatory mechanism that allows a bacterial pathogen to exclusively express a virulence factor when located within a specific intracellular compartment.

Abstract: The distinct process of megakaryopoiesis requires occurrence of endomitosis for polyploidization of the megakaryocytes. Although, Cyclins, CDKs and have been described to regulate endomitosis, the exact mechanism still remains an enigma. miRNA which were otherwise known as post transcriptional gene silencers are now emerging with various non-canonical functions including gene regulation at pre-transcriptional level by miRNA binding at promoter region. Out of the many processes they regulate, miRNA have been manifested to play a role in megakaryocyte differentiation. In this study an attempt has been made to identify miRNA that could regulate cell cycle genes (Cyclins and CDKs) by targeting their promoters, during megakaryopoiesis. A new computational algorithm was implemented using Perl programming to identify putative targets of miRNA in CDK and Cyclin promoters. Perl script was also used to check nuclear localizing miRNA based on the presence of a consensus sequence. Real-time PCR was performed to analyze the expression of miRNA and their predicted targets in Dami vs. PMA treated Dami cells. Putative targets of miRNAs with longest, high complementarity matches in CDK/Cyclin promoters were obtained. We identified two significant miRNA, miR-1273g-3p and miR-619-5p with longest seed sequence matches. We further identified three main targets (CDK10, CDK11, Cyclin F) through which these two miRNA could regulate cell cycle during megakaryopoiesis. Our results reinforce the role of promoting targeting miRNA in regulation of cell cycle through certain CDK/Cyclins to support the process of endomitosis during megakaryopoiesis.

Abstract: Summary
The oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) is a multisubunit enzyme complex that N-glycosylates proteins in the secretory pathway and is considered to be constitutive and unregulated. However, small-molecule OST inhibitors such as NGI-1 provide a pharmacological approach for regulating N-linked glycosylation. Herein we design cell models with knockout of each OST catalytic subunit (STT3A or STT3B) to screen the activity of NGI-1 and its analogs. We show that NGI-1 targets the function of both STT3A and STT3B and use structure-activity relationships to guide synthesis of catalytic subunit-specific inhibitors. Using this approach, pharmacophores that increase STT3B selectivity are characterized and an STT3B-specific inhibitor is identified. This inhibitor has discrete biological effects on endogenous STT3B target proteins such as COX2 but does not activate the cellular unfolded protein response. Together this work demonstrates that subsets of glycoproteins can be regulated through pharmacologic inhibition of N-linked glycosylation.

Abstract: Summary
Hypoxia cooperates with endocrine signaling to maintain the symmetric self-renewal proliferation and migration of embryonic germline stem cells (GSCs). However, the lack of an appropriate in vitro cell model has dramatically hindered the understanding of the mechanism underlying this cooperation. Here, using a serum-free system, we demonstrated that hypoxia significantly induced the GSC mesenchymal transition, increased the expression levels of the pluripotent transcription factor OCT4 and migration-associated proteins (SDF-1, CXCR4, IGF-1, and IGF-1R), and activated the cellular expression and translocalization of the CXCR4-downstream proteins ARP3/pFAK. The underlying mechanism involved significant IGF-1/IGF-1R activation of OCT4/CXCR4 expression through HIF-2α regulation. Picropodophyllin-induced inhibition of IGF-1R phosphorylation significantly suppressed hypoxia-induced SDF-1/CXCR4 expression and cell migration. Furthermore, transactivation between IGF-1R and CXCR4 was involved. In summary, we demonstrated that niche hypoxia synergistically cooperates with its associated IGF-1R signaling to regulate the symmetric division (self-renewal proliferation) and cell migration of alkaline phosphatase-positive GSCs through HIF-2α-OCT4/CXCR4 during embryogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Androgenetic haploid embryonic stem cells (AG-haESCs) hold great promise for exploring gene functions and generating gene-edited semi-cloned (SC) mice. However, the high incidence of self-diploidization and low efficiency of SC mouse production are major obstacles preventing widespread use of these cells. Moreover, although SC mice generation could be greatly improved by knocking out the differentially methylated regions of two imprinted genes, 50% of the SC mice did not survive into adulthood. Here, we found that the genome-wide DNA methylation level in AG-haESCs is extremely low. Subsequently, downregulation of both de novo methyltransferase Dnmt3b and other methylation-related genes was determined to be responsible for DNA hypomethylation. We further demonstrated that ectopic expression of Dnmt3b in AG-haESCs could effectively improve DNA methylation level, and the high incidence of self-diploidization could be markedly rescued. More importantly, the developmental potential of SC embryos was improved, and most SC mice could survive into adulthood.

Abstract: Summary
Although the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is ubiquitously expressed, it is sequestered at specific subcellular locations throughout the cell, thereby resulting in compartmentalized cellular signaling that triggers site-specific behavioral phenotypes. We developed a three-step engineering strategy to construct an optogenetic PKA (optoPKA) and demonstrated that, upon illumination, optoPKA migrates to specified intracellular sites. Furthermore, we designed intracellular spatially segregated reporters of PKA activity and confirmed that optoPKA phosphorylates these reporters in a light-dependent fashion. Finally, proteomics experiments reveal that light activation of optoPKA results in the phosphorylation of known endogenous PKA substrates as well as potential novel substrates.

Abstract: Mammalian male germ cell development takes place in the testis under the influence of a variety of somatic cells and an incompletely defined paracrine and endocrine influences. Since it is not recapitulated well in vitro, researchers studying spermatogenesis often manipulate the germline by creating transgenic or knockout mice or by administering pharmaceutical agonists/antagonists or inhibitors. The effects of these types of manipulations on germline development can often be determined following microscopic imaging, both of stained and immunostained testis sections. Here, we describe approaches for microscopic analysis of the developing male germline, provide detailed protocols for a variety of immunostaining approaches, and discuss transgenic fluorescent reporter lines for studying the early stages of spermatogenesis.

Abstract: Development of the spinal cord requires dynamic and tightly controlled expression of numerous transcription factors. Forkhead Box protein J1 (FoxJ1) is a transcription factor involved in ciliogenesis and is specifically expressed in ependymal cells (ECs) in the adult central nervous system. However, using FoxJ1 fate-mapping mouse lines, we observed that FoxJ1 is also transiently expressed by the progenitors of other neural subtypes during development. Moreover, using a knock-in mouse line, we discovered that FoxJ1 is essential for embryonic progenitors to follow a normal developmental trajectory. FoxJ1 loss perturbed embryonic progenitor proliferation and cell fate determination, and resulted in formation of adult ECs having impaired stem cell potential and an inability to respond to spinal cord injury in both male and female animals. Thus, our study uncovers unexpected developmental functions of FoxJ1 in cell fate determination of subsets of neural cells and suggests that FoxJ1 is critical for maintaining the stem cell potential of ECs into adulthood.

Abstract: Penehyclidine hydrochloride (PHC) preconditioning can alleviate myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and inhibits the upregulation of voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) during I/R. To validate that VDAC1 is a bona fide target of PHC for the protection against myocardial I/R injury, VDAC1 expression construct was delivered by lentiviruses into rat left ventricular myocardium before PHC preconditioning and myocardial I/R. Overexpression of VDAC1 exacerbated cardiac dysfunction and myocardial injury following I/R, and abolished the cardioprotective effect of PHC during I/R injury. Moreover, VDAC1 overexpression with myocardial I/R further increased cytochrome c release from mitochondria to cytoplasm, elevated the levels of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax, and decreased the level of Bcl-2 as compared with I/R alone, and PHC-mediated inhibition of mitochondria-dependent apoptosis during myocardial I/R was abolished by VDAC1 overexpression. In addition, VDAC1 was overexpressed in H9c2 cardiomyocytes undergoing anoxia/reoxygenation (A/R) with or without PHC pretreatment. The in vitro results showed that overexpression of VDAC1 further reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, increased mitochondrial membrane permeability and enhanced mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in H9c2 cells after A/R, and VDAC1 overexpression abrogated the protective effect of PHC on the mitochondrial function and integrity during A/R. In conclusion, exogenous overexpression of VDAC1 during myocardial I/R inhibits the cardioprotective effects of PHC. These effects may be associated with the suppression of VDAC1 expression.

Abstract: Accumulation of lipofuscin in the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) is observed in retinal degenerative diseases including Stargardt disease and age-related macular degeneration. Bis-retinoid N-retinyl-N-retinylidene ethanolamine (A2E) is a major component of lipofuscin. A2E has been implicated in RPE atrophy and retinal inflammation; however, mice with A2E accumulation display only a mild retinal phenotype. In the current study, human iPSC-RPE (hiPSC-RPE) cells were generated from healthy individuals to examine effects of A2E in human RPE cells. hiPSC-RPE cells displayed RPE-specific features, which include expression of RPE-specific genes, tight junction formation and ability to carry out phagocytosis. hiPSC-RPE cells demonstrated cell death and increased VEGF-A production in a time-dependent manner when they were cocultured with 10μM of A2E. PCR array analyses revealed upregulation of 26 and 12 pro-inflammatory cytokines upon A2E and H2O2 exposure respectively, indicating that A2E and H2O2 can cause inflammation in human retinas. Notably, identified gene profiles were different between A2E- and H2O2- treated hiPSC-RPE cells. A2E caused inflammatory changes observed in retinal degenerative diseases more closely as compared to H2O2. Collectively, these data obtained with hiPSC-RPE cells provide evidence that A2E plays an important role in pathogenesis of retinal degenerative diseases in humans.

Abstract: Summary
Demyelination is frequently observed in a variety of CNS insults and neurodegenerative diseases. In rodents, adult neural stem cells can generate oligodendrocytes and participate to myelin repair. However, these cells mainly produce migratory neuroblasts that differentiate in the olfactory bulb. Here, we show that, in the demyelination context, a small subset of these neuroblasts can spontaneously convert into myelinating oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the contribution of neuroblasts to myelin repair can be improved by in vivo forced expression of two transcription factors: OLIG2 and SOX10. These factors promote directed fate conversion of endogenous subventricular zone neuroblasts into mature functional oligodendrocytes, leading to enhanced remyelination in a cuprizone-induced mouse model of demyelination. These findings highlight the unexpected plasticity of committed neuroblasts and provide proof of concept that they could be targeted for the treatment of demyelinated lesions in the adult brain.

Abstract: A low level of breast cancer metastasis suppressor 1-like (BRMS1L) has been implicated in tumour metastasis involving breast cancer and other cancers. It remains unclear whether BRMS1L is involved in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) metastasis and what the molecular mechanism of BRMS1L is in suppressing EOC metastasis. In this study, we examined the mRNA expression and protein level of BRMS1L by screening EOC patients. Our results show that BRMS1L expression is downregulated in EOC patients compared to that in normal people and negatively correlated to pathological stages of EOC. We further explored examining epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) as the molecular mechanism of BRMS1L in cancer cell metastasis. The overexpression of BRMS1L inhibits EOC cell migration and invasion, and this inhibition is correlated to the inactivation of EMT and Wnt/β-catenin signalling in vitro. Knockdown of BRMS1L by shRNA promotes EOC metastasis, enhances EMT process and activates Wnt/β-catenin signalling. These results suggest that BRMS1L plays a critical role in the suppression of ovarian cancer metastasis, and BRMS1L can be considered as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for EOC patients.

Abstract: Patients with tenascin-X (TNX)-deficient type Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) do not exhibit delayed wound healing, unlike classic type EDS patients, who exhibit mutations in collagen genes. Similarly, in TNX-knockout (KO) mice, wound closure of the skin is normal even though these mice exhibit a reduced breaking strength. Therefore, we speculated that the wound healing process may be affected in the absence of TNX. In this study, to investigate the effects of TNX absence on wound healing-related properties, we performed collagen gel contraction assays with wild-type (WT) and TNX-KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Collagen gels with embedded TNX-KO MEFs showed significantly greater contraction than those containing WT MEFs. Subsequently, we assessed collagen gel contraction-related properties, such as the activities of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 and the protein and mRNA expression levels of transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) in the collagen gels. The activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 and the expression level of TGF-β1 were elevated in the absence of TNX. Furthermore, filopodia-like protrusion formation, cell proliferation, migration, and collagen expression in MEFs were promoted in the absence of TNX. These results indicate that these wound healing-related properties are affected in a TNX-deficient extracellular environment.

Abstract: Blood vessels are one of the major routes for the dissemination of cancer cells. Malignant tumors release growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) to induce angiogenesis, thereby promoting metastasis. Here, we report that The Drosophila Eyes Absent Homologue 1 (EYA1), which is overexpressed in colorectal tumor cells, can promote colorectal tumor angiogenesis by coordinating with the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1α) to increase the expression of VEGF-A. Moreover, data indicated that the enhancement of HIF-1α expression by Eya1 depended on its ability to activate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathways to increase the phosphorylation of AKT subunits. Overexpression of Eya1 increased tumor angiogenesis in vivo and in vitro. Our study suggested that Eya1 is essential in regulating cancer cell-mediated angiogenesis and contributes to tumor growth, and that Eya1 provides a potential and specific target for new anti-angiogenesis drug development.

Abstract: The C1q/TNF-related protein 6 (CTRP6) is an adipokine involved in diverse biological processes. Formerly, we identified that CTRP6 regulates adipocyte differentiation, fatty acid oxidation and triglyceride accumulation in vitro. However, the effects of CTRP6 on adiposity in vivo have not yet been defined. This study aimed to confirm the involvement of CTRP6 in adipose accumulation and brown adipogenesis by intraperitoneal injection of the CTRP6-shRNA lentivirus into mice (CL mice). CL mice were significantly thinner than the control mice after feeding with a high fat diet (HFD), independent of food intake quantity. These HFD-fed CL mice displayed lower white and brown adipocyte sizes, and serum leptin levels, but an increase in serum adiponectin and insulin sensitivity relative to control mice. Additionally, the brown fat markers, such as UCP1, PRDM16, PGC1α and Cidea were found to be upregulated in the white and brown adipose tissue of the CL mice. These markers were also upregulated in a primary culture of mouse white and brown adipocytes treated with the CTRP6-shRNA lentivirus. Mechanistically, the knockdown of CTRP6 increased p38MAPK phosphorylation, but decreased expression of proteins involved in the Hedgehog signaling pathway (Sufu, Gli2 and Gli3). CTRP6 knockdown also upregulated expression of mitochondrial metabolic factors NRF-1, TFAM, CPT1 and Cyt C. Data from the current study show that CTRP6 knockdown protects against diet-induced obesity and promotes brown adipogenesis by the p38MAPK/Hh signaling pathway in conjunction with the upregulation of brown fat markers and mitochondrial metabolic factors.

Abstract: The Golgi apparatus plays roles in cell polarity, directional cell migration, and bipolar spindle assembly, as well as the secretary pathway. In addition, recent studies have suggested the Golgi-dependent control of mitotic entry. We studied the role of the centrosomal kinase Aurora A in maintaining the Golgi apparatus. Knockdown of Aurora A resulted in Golgi dispersal during interphase. Golgi dispersal was also induced by a selective Aurora A inhibitor, MLN8237. Conversely, overexpression of Aurora A led to tightly packed Golgi apparatus during interphase. Knockdown or inhibition of Aurora A had little or no effect on Golgi vesiculation during mitosis. By synchronizing cell division, we studied whether mitosis was required to induce Golgi dispersal during interphase. Aurora A inhibition induced aberrant mitotic spindle and Golgi dispersal only after mitosis. However, the cells treated with the inhibitor MLN8237 at earlier cell cycle stages (wherein the cells remained undivided) had a normal Golgi architecture. Knockdown or inhibition of Aurora A also led to aberrant integrity of centrosome and Golgi apparatus during interphase. These results suggest that Aurora A activity is involved in the maintenance of Golgi architecture and the relationship between the Golgi apparatus and centrosome.

Abstract: Summary
Brain microenvironment plays an important role in neurodevelopment and pathology, where the extracellular matrix (ECM) and soluble factors modulate multiple cellular processes. Neural cell culture typically relies on heterologous matrices poorly resembling brain ECM. Here, we employed neurospheroids to address microenvironment remodeling during neural differentiation of human stem cells, without the confounding effects of exogenous matrices. Proteome and transcriptome dynamics revealed significant changes at cell membrane and ECM during 3D differentiation, diverging significantly from the 2D differentiation. Structural proteoglycans typical of brain ECM were enriched during 3D differentiation, in contrast to basement membrane constituents in 2D. Moreover, higher expression of synaptic and ion transport machinery was observed in 3D cultures, suggesting higher neuronal maturation in neurospheroids. This work demonstrates that 3D neural differentiation as neurospheroids promotes the expression of cellular and extracellular features found in neural tissue, highlighting its value to address molecular defects in cell-ECM interactions associated with neurological disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited, progressive neurological disorder characterized by degenerating striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs). One promising approach for treating HD is cell replacement therapy, where lost cells are replaced by MSN progenitors derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). While there has been remarkable progress in generating hPSC-derived MSNs, current production methods rely on two-dimensional culture systems that can include poorly defined components, limit scalability, and yield differing preclinical results. To facilitate clinical translation, here, we generated striatal progenitors from hPSCs within a fully defined and scalable PNIPAAm-PEG three-dimensional (3D) hydrogel. Transplantation of 3D-derived striatal progenitors into a transgenic mouse model of HD slowed disease progression, improved motor coordination, and increased survival. In addition, the transplanted cells developed an MSN-like phenotype and formed synaptic connections with host cells. Our results illustrate the potential of scalable 3D biomaterials for generating striatal progenitors for HD cell therapy.

Abstract: Cancer stem cell (CSC) self-renewing and drug resistance cause treatment failure and tumor recurrence. Osteosarcoma is an aggressive bone tumor characterized by biological and molecular heterogeneity, possibly dependent on CSCs. CSC identification in osteosarcoma and their efficient targeting are still open questions. Spontaneous canine osteosarcoma shares clinical and biological features with the human tumors, representing a model for translational studies. We characterized three CSC-enriched canine osteosarcoma cultures. In serum-free conditions, these CSC cultures grow as anchorage-independent spheroids, show mesenchymal-like properties and in vivo tumorigenicity, recapitulating the heterogeneity of the original osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma CSCs express stem-related factors (Sox2, Oct4, CD133) and chemokine receptors and ligands (CXCR4, CXCL12) involved in tumor proliferation and self-renewal. Standard drugs for osteosarcoma treatment (doxorubicin and cisplatin) affected CSC-enriched and parental primary cultures, showing different efficacy within tumors. Moreover, metformin, a type-2 diabetes drug, significantly inhibits osteosarcoma CSC viability, migration and self-renewal and, in co-treatment with doxorubicin and cisplatin, enhances drug cytotoxicity. Collectively, we demonstrate that canine osteosarcoma primary cultures contain CSCs exhibiting distinctive sensitivity to anticancer agents, as a reliable experimental model to assay drug efficacy. We also provide proof-of-principle of metformin efficacy, alone or in combination, as pharmacological strategy to target osteosarcoma CSCs.

Abstract: DN604, a carboplatin analogue with a functional dicarboxylato ligand, was deeply investigated to explore its ability to induce apoptosis as well as its antitumor mechanism of action. Both in vitro and in vivo assays indicated that DN604 could effectively inhibit cell viability of SGC-7901 gastric cancer cells and exhibited stronger antitumor activity than carboplatin and comparable activity to cisplatin. Significantly in contrast to cisplatin, DN604 resulted in negligible toxic effects in vivo with the same tumor growth inhibition effect as cisplatin. The mechanism study indicated that DN604 inhibited CK2-phosphorylated cdc25C activation to decrease p-cdc25C subcellular localization, leading to the inactivation of cdc2/Cyclin B and G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in SGC-7901 cancer cells. Our research revealed for the first time that the dicarboxylato ligand containing a suitable functional moiety as the leaving group in the platinum(II) complex can effectively induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via inhibiting key checkpoint proteins.

Abstract: Summary
A dramatic difference in global DNA methylation between male and female cells characterizes mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), unlike somatic cells. We analyzed DNA methylation changes during reprogramming of male and female somatic cells and in resulting induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). At an intermediate reprogramming stage, somatic and pluripotency enhancers are targeted for partial methylation and demethylation. Demethylation within pluripotency enhancers often occurs at ESC binding sites of pluripotency transcription factors. Late in reprogramming, global hypomethylation is induced in a female-specific manner. Genome-wide hypomethylation in female cells affects many genomic landmarks, including enhancers and imprint control regions, and accompanies the reactivation of the inactive X chromosome. The loss of one of the two X chromosomes in propagating female iPSCs is associated with genome-wide methylation gain. Collectively, our findings highlight the dynamic regulation of DNA methylation at enhancers during reprogramming and reveal that X chromosome dosage dictates global DNA methylation levels in iPSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are important regulators of early infection at mucosal barriers. ILCs are divided into three groups based on expression profiles, and are activated by cytokines and neuropeptides. Yet, it remains unknown if ILCs integrate other signals in providing protection. We show that signaling through herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM), a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily, in ILC3 is important for host defense against oral infection with the bacterial pathogen Yersinia enterocolitica. HVEM stimulates protective interferon-γ (IFN-γ) secretion from ILCs, and mice with HVEM-deficient ILC3 exhibit reduced IFN-γ production, higher bacterial burdens and increased mortality. In addition, IFN-γ production is critical as adoptive transfer of wild-type but not IFN-γ-deficient ILC3 can restore protection to mice lacking ILCs. We identify the TNF superfamily member, LIGHT, as the ligand inducing HVEM signals in ILCs. Thus HVEM signaling mediated by LIGHT plays a critical role in regulating ILC3-derived IFN-γ production for protection following infection.

Abstract: Summary
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) provide an unlimited source for generating various kinds of functional blood cells. However, efficient strategies for generating large-scale functional blood cells from hPSCs are still lacking, and the mechanism underlying human hematopoiesis remains largely unknown. In this study, we identified myeloid ectopic viral integration site 1 homolog (MEIS1) as a crucial regulator of hPSC early hematopoietic differentiation. MEIS1 is vital for specification of APLNR+ mesoderm progenitors to functional hemogenic endothelial progenitors (HEPs), thereby controlling formation of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). TAL1 mediates the function of MEIS1 in HEP specification. In addition, MEIS1 is vital for megakaryopoiesis and thrombopoiesis from hPSCs. Mechanistically, FLI1 acts as a downstream gene necessary for the function of MEIS1 during megakaryopoiesis. Thus, MEIS1 controls human hematopoiesis in a stage-specific manner and can be potentially manipulated for large-scale generation of HPCs or platelets from hPSCs for therapeutic applications in regenerative medicine.

Abstract: Summary
Mycobacterial cell wall lipids bind the conserved CD1 family of antigen-presenting molecules and activate T cells via their T cell receptors (TCRs). Sulfoglycolipids (SGLs) are uniquely synthesized by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but tools to study SGL-specific T cells in humans are lacking. We designed a novel hybrid synthesis of a naturally occurring SGL, generated CD1b tetramers loaded with natural or synthetic SGL analogs, and studied the molecular requirements for TCR binding and T cell activation. Two T cell lines derived using natural SGLs are activated by synthetic analogs independently of lipid chain length and hydroxylation, but differentially by saturation status. By contrast, two T cell lines derived using an unsaturated SGL synthetic analog were not activated by the natural antigen. Our data provide a bioequivalence hierarchy of synthetic SGL analogs and SGL-loaded CD1b tetramers. These reagents can now be applied to large-scale translational studies investigating the diagnostic potential of SGL-specific T cell responses or SGL-based vaccines.

Abstract: This study aimed to determine the cellular characteristics and behaviors of human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) expanded in media in a hypoxic or normoxic condition and with or without fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) treatment. hBMSCs isolated from the vertebral body and expanded in these four groups were evaluated for cellular proliferation/migration, colony-forming units, cell-surface characterization, in vitro differentiation, in vivo transplantation, and gene expression. Culturing hBMSCs using a particular environmental factor (hypoxia) and with the addition of FGF-2 increased the cellular proliferation rate while enhancing the regenerative potential, modulated the multipotency-related processes (enhanced chondrogenesis-related processes/osteogenesis, but reduced adipogenesis), and increased cellular migration and collagen formation. The gene expression levels in the experimental samples showed activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 pathway and glycolysis in the hypoxic condition, with this not being affected by the addition of FGF-2. The concurrent application of hypoxia and FGF-2 could provide a favorable condition for culturing hBMSCs to be used in clinical applications associated with bone tissue engineering, due to the enhancement of cellular proliferation and regenerative potential.

Abstract: Summary
KRAS is frequently mutated in several of the most lethal types of cancer; however, the KRAS protein has proven a challenging drug target. K-RAS4B must be localized to the plasma membrane by prenylation to activate oncogenic signaling, thus we endeavored to target the protein-membrane interface with small-molecule compounds. While all reported lead compounds have low affinity for KRAS in solution, the potency of Cmpd2 was strongly enhanced when prenylated K-RAS4B is associated with a lipid bilayer. We have elucidated a unique mechanism of action of Cmpd2, which simultaneously engages a shallow pocket on KRAS and associates with the lipid bilayer, thereby stabilizing KRAS in an orientation in which the membrane occludes its effector-binding site, reducing RAF binding and impairing activation of RAF. Furthermore, enrichment of Cmpd2 on the bilayer enhances potency by promoting interaction with KRAS. This insight reveals a novel approach to developing inhibitors of membrane-associated proteins.

Abstract: Tumor metastasis accounts for 90% of all cancer-related deaths. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) considered to be centrally important in acquired resistance to chemotherapy and in progression of tumors to secondary organs. One of the important mediators of metastatic progression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the metastasis associated protein 1 (MTA-1). We have earlier shown that in the context of HCC and normal liver cell lines, MTA-1 protein is actively stabilized in HCC cell lines and actively degraded in normal liver cells. We have also shown that TRIM25 is the E3 ligase that interacts with and degrades MTA-1 protein. The identity of the factor regulating expression of TRIM25 in normal liver cells and HCC is unknown. In the current work we elucidate that microRNA (miR)− 873 targets TRIM25 in HCC cells. Both metagenomic analysis and quantification of miR-873 and TRIM25 in 25 HCC patients revealed an inverse correlation between the two in HCC patients with high miR-873 and low TRIM25 expression, respectively. The expression pattern was mimicked in the normal liver cells THLE-2 and the HCC cell line, HuH6. In vitro luciferase reporter assays confirmed TRIM25 as the target of miR-873. Transient transfection of HuH6 cells with an anti-miR-873 antagomir significantly decreased both transwell motility in these cells. Furthermore, in in vivo xenograft assays treatment with anti-miR-873 antagomir significantly decreased hepatic nodules formation. Cumulatively, our data indicate that suppression of TRIM25 expression by high levels of miR-873 dictates MTA1 protein upregulation in HCC.

Abstract: Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) is an unusual CDK whose function has been implicated in protecting the central nervous system (CNS) from oxidative damage. However, there have been few studies of CDK5 in insects. In this study, we identified the AccCDK5 gene from Apis cerana cerana and investigated its role in oxidation resistance. We found that AccCDK5 is highly conserved across species and contains conserved features of the CDK5 family. The results of qPCR analysis indicated that AccCDK5 is highly expressed during the larval and pupal stages and in the adult head and muscle. We further observed that AccCDK5 is induced by several environmental oxidative stresses. Moreover, the overexpression of the AccCDK5 protein in E. coli enhances the resistance of the bacteria to oxidative stress. The activation of CDK5 requires binding to its activator. Therefore, we also identified and cloned cyclin-dependent kinase 5 regulatory subunit 1, which we named AccCDK5r1, from Apis cerana cerana. AccCDK5r1 contains a conserved cell localization targeting domain as well as binding and activation sites for CDK5. Yeast two-hybrid analysis demonstrated the interaction between AccCDK5 and AccCDK5r1. The expression patterns of the two genes were similar after stress treatment. Collectively, these results suggest that AccCDK5 plays a pivotal role in the response to oxidative stresses and that AccCDK5r1 is a potential activator of AccCDK5.

Abstract: The cancer stem cell (CSC) concept is currently employed to explain the mechanism of multidrug resistance that is implicated in the reduced efficacy of many chemotherapeutic agents, consequently leading to metastatic spread and disease relapse. We searched for potential predictive markers of doxorubicin (DOX) resistance in breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) of the BT-549 human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line classified as a claudin-low subtype. In this study, we show that BT-549 presents a BCSCs-like subset determined by a CD44+/high/CD24-/low/ALDH1+ phenotype. The CD44+/high/CD24-/low/ALDH+ BCSCs-like subset presented the downregulation of a majority of the genes analyzed (64 genes), and only 3 genes were upregulated after DOX treatment. Among the upregulated genes, MAPK3, PRKCZ and STAT3, STAT3 presented a higher level of upregulation in the DOX-treated CD44+/high/CD24-/low/ALDH+ BCSCs-like subset. The identification of biomarkers that predict antitumor responses is at the top of cancer research priorities. STAT3 was highlighted as a molecular signature in the CD44+/high/CD24-/low/ALDH1+ BCSCs-like subset obtained from the TNBC BT-549 cell line related to DOX resistance. A majority of the evaluated genes in the EGF pathway appear to be not associated with DOX resistance, as observed in the CD44+/high/CD24-/low/ALDH1+ BCSCs-like subset.

Abstract: Numerous chemicals including environmental toxicants and drugs have not been fully evaluated for developmental neurotoxicity. A key gap exists in the ability to predict accurately and robustly in vivo outcomes based on in vitro assays. This is particularly the case for predicting the toxicity of chemicals on the developing human brain. A critical need for such in vitro assays is choice of a suitable model cell type. To that end, we have performed high-throughput in vitro assessment of proliferation and differentiation of human neural stem cells (hNSCs). Conventional in vitro assays typically use immunofluorescence staining to quantify changes in cell morphology and expression of neural cell-specific biomarkers, which is often time-consuming and subject to variable specificities of available antibodies. To alleviate these limitations, we developed a miniaturized, three-dimensional (3D) hNSC culture with ReNcell VM on microarray chip platforms and established a high-throughput promoter-reporter assay system using recombinant lentiviruses on hNSC spheroids to assess cell viability, self-renewal, and differentiation. Optimum cell viability and spheroid formation of 3D ReNcell VM culture were observed on a micropillar chip over a period of 9 days in a mixture of 0.75% (w/v) alginate and 1 mg/mL growth factor reduced (GFR) Matrigel with 25 mM CaCl2 as a crosslinker for alginate. In addition, 3D ReNcell VM culture exhibited self-renewal and differentiation on the microarray chip platform, which was efficiently monitored by enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression of four NSC-specific biomarkers including sex determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), synapsin1, and myelin basic protein (MBP) with the promoter-reporter assay system.

Abstract: Summary
The LIM-homeodomain transcription factor ISL1 marks multipotent cardiac progenitors that give rise to cardiac muscle, endothelium, and smooth muscle cells. ISL1+ progenitors can be derived from human pluripotent stem cells, but the inability to efficiently isolate pure populations has limited their characterization. Using a genetic selection strategy, we were able to highly enrich ISL1+ cells derived from human embryonic stem cells. Comparative quantitative proteomic analysis of enriched ISL1+ cells identified ALCAM (CD166) as a surface marker that enabled the isolation of ISL1+ progenitor cells. ALCAM+/ISL1+ progenitors are multipotent and differentiate into cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells. Transplantation of ALCAM+ progenitors enhances tissue recovery, restores cardiac function, and improves angiogenesis through activation of AKT-MAPK signaling in a rat model of myocardial infarction, based on cardiac MRI and histology. Our study establishes an efficient method for scalable purification of human ISL1+ cardiac precursor cells for therapeutic applications.

We previously reported that an ischemia-inducible Gβγ signal regulator, activator of G-protein signaling 8 (AGS8), regulated the subcellular distribution of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) and influenced VEGFA-induced signaling in vascular endothelial cells. Here, we report that AGS8 regulates VEGFR-3, which is another subtype of the VEGF receptor family, and mediates VEGFC signaling in human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells (HDLECs). VEGFC stimulated the proliferation of HDLECs and tube formation by HDLECs, which were inhibited by knocking down AGS8 by small interfering RNA (siRNA). AGS8 siRNA inhibited VEGFC-mediated phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 and its downstream molecules, including ERK1/2 and AKT. Analysis of fluorescence-activated cell sorting and immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that AGS8 knockdown was associated with a reduction of VEGFR-3 at the cell surface. Endocytosis inhibitors did not rescue the decrease of cell-surface VEGFR-3, suggesting that AGS8 regulated the trafficking of VEGFR-3 to the plasma membrane. An immunoprecipitation assay indicated that VEGFR-3 formed a complex including AGS8 and Gβγ in cells. These data suggest the novel regulation of VEGFC-VEGFR-3 by AGS8 in HDLECs and a potential role for AGS8 in lymphangiogenesis.
