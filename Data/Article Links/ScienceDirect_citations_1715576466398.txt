Abstract: Summary
Most neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) target the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein. Here, we characterize a panel of mAbs targeting the N-terminal domain (NTD) or other non-RBD epitopes of S. A subset of NTD mAbs inhibits SARS-CoV-2 entry at a post-attachment step and avidly binds the surface of infected cells. One neutralizing NTD mAb, SARS2-57, protects K18-hACE2 mice against SARS-CoV-2 infection in an Fc-dependent manner. Structural analysis demonstrates that SARS2-57 engages an antigenic supersite that is remodeled by deletions common to emerging variants. In neutralization escape studies with SARS2-57, this NTD site accumulates mutations, including a similar deletion, but the addition of an anti-RBD mAb prevents such escape. Thus, our study highlights a common strategy of immune evasion by SARS-CoV-2 variants and how targeting spatially distinct epitopes, including those in the NTD, may limit such escape.

Abstract: Summary
Impaired mitochondrial dynamics causes aging-related or metabolic diseases. Yet, the molecular mechanism responsible for the impairment of mitochondrial dynamics is still not well understood. Here, we report that elevated blood insulin and/or glucagon levels downregulate mitochondrial fission through directly phosphorylating AMPKα at S496 by AKT or PKA, resulting in the impairment of AMPK-MFF-DRP1 signaling and mitochondrial dynamics and activity. Since there are significantly increased AMPKα1 phosphorylation at S496 in the liver of elderly mice, obese mice, and obese patients, we, therefore, designed AMPK-specific targeting peptides (Pa496m and Pa496h) to block AMPKα1S496 phosphorylation and found that these targeting peptides can increase AMPK kinase activity, augment mitochondrial fission and oxidation, and reduce ROS, leading to the rejuvenation of mitochondria. Furthermore, these AMPK targeting peptides robustly suppress liver glucose production in obese mice. Our data suggest these targeting peptides are promising therapeutic agents for improving mitochondrial dynamics and activity and alleviating hyperglycemia in elderly and obese patients.

Abstract: Summary
To address the needs of the life sciences community and the pharmaceutical industry in pre-clinical drug development to both maintain and continuously assess tissue metabolism and function with simple and rapid systems, we improved on the initial BaroFuse to develop it into a fully functional, pumpless, scalable multi-channel fluidics instrument that continuously measures changes in oxygen consumption and other endpoints in response to test compounds. We and several other laboratories assessed it with a wide range of tissue types including retina, pancreatic islets, liver, and hypothalamus with both aqueous and gaseous test compounds. The setup time was less than an hour for all collaborating groups, and there was close agreement between data obtained from the different laboratories. This easy-to-use system reliably generates real-time metabolic and functional data from tissue and cells in response to test compounds that will address a critical need in basic and applied research.

Abstract: Summary
The molecular dynamics of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) under chemotherapy remain incompletely understood. The widespread use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) provides a unique opportunity to investigate PDAC samples post-chemotherapy. Leveraging a cohort from Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, encompassing PDAC samples with and without exposure to neoadjuvant albumin-bound paclitaxel and gemcitabine (AG), we have compiled data from single-cell and spatial transcriptomes, proteomes, bulk transcriptomes, and metabolomes, deepening our comprehension of the molecular changes in PDACs in response to chemotherapy. Metabolic flux analysis reveals that NAC induces a reprogramming of PDAC metabolic patterns and enhances immunogenicity. Notably, NAC leads to the downregulation of glycolysis and the upregulation of CD36. Tissue microarray analysis demonstrates that high CD36 expression is linked to poorer survival in patients receiving postoperative AG. Targeting CD36 synergistically improves the PDAC response to AG both in vitro and in vivo, including patient-derived preclinical models.

Abstract: SPL (SQUAMOSA promoter binding proteins-like) are plant-specific transcription factors that play essential roles in a variety of developmental processes as well as the ability to withstand biotic and abiotic stresses. To date, numerous species have been investigated for the SPL gene family, but so far, no SPL family genes have been thoroughly identified and characterized in the sunflower (Helianthus annuus). In this study, 25 SPL genes were identified in the sunflower genome and were unevenly distributed on 11 chromosomes. According to phylogeny analysis, 59 SPL genes from H. annuus, O. sativa, and A. thaliana were clustered into seven groups. Furthermore, the SPL genes in groups-I and II were demonstrated to be potential targets of miR156. Synteny analysis showed that 7 paralogous gene pairs exist in HaSPL genes and 26 orthologous gene pairs exist between sunflower and rice, whereas 21 orthologous gene pairs were found between sunflower and Arabidopsis. Segmental duplication appears to have played a vital role in the expansion processes of sunflower SPL genes, and because of selection pressure, all duplicated genes have undergone purifying selection. Tissue-specific gene expression analysis of the HaSBP genes proved their diverse spatiotemporal expression patterns, which were predominantly expressed in floral organs and differentially expressed in stem, axil, and root tissues. The expression pattern of HaSPL genes under water stress showed broad involvement of HaSPLs in the response to flood and drought stresses. This genome-wide identification investigation provides detailed information on the sunflower SPL transcription factor gene family and establishes a strong platform for future research on sunflower responses to abiotic stress tolerance.

Abstract: Summary
The Segatella copri (formerly Prevotella copri) complex (ScC) comprises taxa that are key members of the human gut microbiome. It was previously described to contain four distinct phylogenetic clades. Combining targeted isolation with large-scale metagenomic analysis, we defined 13 distinct Segatella copri-related species, expanding the ScC complex beyond four clades. Complete genome reconstruction of thirteen strains from seven species unveiled the presence of genetically diverse large circular extrachromosomal elements. These elements are consistently present in most ScC species, contributing to intra- and inter-species diversities. The nine species-level clades present in humans display striking differences in prevalence and intra-species genetic makeup across human populations. Based on a meta-analysis, we found reproducible associations between members of ScC and the male sex and positive correlations with lower visceral fat and favorable markers of cardiometabolic health. Our work uncovers genomic diversity within ScC, facilitating a better characterization of the human microbiome.

Abstract: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common musculoskeletal disorder that impairs function and reduces the quality of life. Extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation and inflammatory mechanisms are crucial to the progression of OA. In this study, we aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory activity, anti-ECM degradation property, and glucose transport capacity of quercitrin (QCT) on IL-1β-treated rat primary chondrocytes. Rat primary chondrocytes were treated with IL-1β to simulate inflammatory environmental conditions and OA in vitro. We examined the effects of QCT at concentrations ranging from 0 to 200 μM on the viability of rat chondrocytes and selected 5 μM for further study. Using qRT-PCR, immunofluorescent, immunocytochemistry, and western blotting techniques, we identified the potential molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways that are responsible for these effects. We established an OA rat model through anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT). The animals were then periodically injected with QCT into the knee articular cavity. Our in vivo and in vitro study showed that QCT could inhibit IL-1β-activated inflammation and ECM degradation in chondrocyte. Furthermore, QCT could inhibit the NF-κB signal pathway and enhance glucose transport capacity in the IL-1β-stimulated chondrocytes. In vivo study proved that QCT attenuates OA progression in rats. Overall, QCT inhibited the activation of NF-κB and enhanced glucose transport capacity to alleviate the progression of OA.

Abstract: Summary
Vocalizations are pivotal in mammalian communication, especially in humans. Rodents accordingly rely on ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) that reflect their internal state as a primary channel during social interactions. However, attributing vocalizations to specific individuals remains challenging, impeding internal state assessment. Rats emit 50-kHz USVs to indicate positive states and intensify sniffing during alertness and social interactions. Here, we present a method involving a miniature microphone attached to the rat nasal cavity that allows to capture both male and female individual rat vocalizations and sniffing patterns during social interactions. We found that while the emission of 50-kHz USVs increases during close interactions, these signals lack specific behavioral associations. Moreover, a previously unreported low-frequency vocalization type marking rat social interactions was uncovered. Finally, different dynamics of sniffing and vocalization activities point to distinct underlying internal states. Thus, our method facilitates the exploration of internal states concurrent with social behaviors.

Abstract: Summary
Generation of pure pancreatic progenitor (PP) cells is critical for clinical translation of stem cell-derived islets. Herein, we performed PP differentiation with and without AKT/P70 inhibitor AT7867 and characterized the resulting cells at protein and transcript level in vitro and in vivo upon transplantation into diabetic mice. AT7867 treatment increased the percentage of PDX1+NKX6.1+ (−AT7867: 50.9% [IQR 48.9%–53.8%]; +AT7867: 90.8% [IQR 88.9%–93.7%]; p = 0.0021) and PDX1+GP2+ PP cells (−AT7867: 39.22% [IQR 36.7%–44.1%]; +AT7867: 90.0% [IQR 88.2%–93.6%]; p = 0.0021). Transcriptionally, AT7867 treatment significantly upregulated PDX1 (p = 0.0001), NKX6.1 (p = 0.0005), and GP2 (p = 0.002) expression compared with controls, while off-target markers PODXL (p < 0.0001) and TBX2 (p < 0.0001) were significantly downregulated. Transplantation of AT7867-treated PPs resulted in faster hyperglycemia reversal in diabetic mice compared with controls (time and group: p < 0.0001). Overall, our data show that AT7867 enhances PP cell differentiation leading to accelerated diabetes reversal.

Abstract: Summary
High-dimensional flow cytometry is the gold standard to study the human immune system in large cohorts. However, large sample sizes increase inter-experimental variation because of technical and experimental inaccuracies introduced by batch variability. Our high-throughput sample processing pipeline in combination with 28-color flow cytometry focuses on increased throughput (192 samples/experiment) and high reproducibility. We implemented quality control checkpoints to reduce technical and experimental variation. Finally, we integrated FlowSOM clustering to facilitate automated data analysis and demonstrate the reproducibility of our pipeline in a study with 3,357 samples. We reveal age-associated immune dynamics in 2,300 individuals, signified by decreasing T and B cell subsets with age. In addition, by combining genetic analyses, our approach revealed unique immune signatures associated with a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that abrogates CD45 isoform splicing. In summary, we provide a versatile and reliable high-throughput, flow cytometry-based pipeline for immune discovery and exploration in large cohorts.

Abstract: Summary
Brain organoid methods are complicated by multiple rosette structures and morphological variability. We have developed a human brain organoid technique that generates self-organizing, single-rosette cortical organoids (SOSR-COs) with reproducible size and structure at early timepoints. Rather than patterning a 3-dimensional embryoid body, we initiate brain organoid formation from a 2-dimensional monolayer of human pluripotent stem cells patterned with small molecules into neuroepithelium and differentiated to cells of the developing dorsal cerebral cortex. This approach recapitulates the 2D to 3D developmental transition from neural plate to neural tube. Most monolayer fragments form spheres with a single central lumen. Over time, the SOSR-COs develop appropriate progenitor and cortical laminar cell types as shown by immunocytochemistry and single-cell RNA sequencing. At early time points, this method demonstrates robust structural phenotypes after chemical teratogen exposure or when modeling a genetic neurodevelopmental disorder, and should prove useful for studies of human brain development and disease modeling.

Abstract: Summary
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is closely associated with cancer, multiple sclerosis, and post-acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) sequelae. There are currently no approved therapeutics or vaccines against EBV. It is noteworthy that combining multiple EBV glycoproteins can elicit potent neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against viral infection, suggesting possible synergistic effects. Here, we characterize three nAbs (anti-gp42 5E3, anti-gHgL 6H2, and anti-gHgL 10E4) targeting different glycoproteins of the gHgL-gp42 complex. Two antibody cocktails synergistically neutralize infection in B cells (5E3+6H2+10E4) and epithelial cells (6H2+10E4) in vitro. Moreover, 5E3 alone and the 5E3+6H2+10E4 cocktail confer potent in vivo protection against lethal EBV challenge in humanized mice. The cryo-EM structure of a heptatomic gHgL-gp42 immune complex reveals non-overlapping epitopes of 5E3, 6H2, and 10E4 on the gHgL-gp42 complex. Structural and functional analyses highlight different neutralization mechanisms for each of the three nAbs. In summary, our results provide insight for the rational design of therapeutics or vaccines against EBV infection.

Abstract: Summary
High-level MET amplification (METamp) is a primary driver in ∼1%–2% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). Cohort B of the phase 2 VISION trial evaluates tepotinib, an oral MET inhibitor, in patients with advanced NSCLC with high-level METamp who were enrolled by liquid biopsy. While the study was halted before the enrollment of the planned 60 patients, the results of 24 enrolled patients are presented here. The objective response rate (ORR) is 41.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 22.1–63.4), and the median duration of response is 14.3 months (95% CI, 2.8–not estimable). In exploratory biomarker analyses, focal METamp, RB1 wild-type, MYC diploidy, low circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) burden at baseline, and early molecular response are associated with better outcomes. Adverse events include edema (composite term; any grade: 58.3%; grade 3: 12.5%) and constipation (any grade: 41.7%; grade 3: 4.2%). Tepotinib provides antitumor activity in high-level METamp NSCLC (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02864992).

Abstract: Summary
Functional screening of environmental DNA (eDNA) libraries is a potentially powerful approach to discover enzymatic “unknown unknowns”, but is usually heavily biased toward the tiny subset of genes preferentially transcribed and translated by the screening strain. We have overcome this by preparing an eDNA library via partial digest with restriction enzyme FatI (cuts CATG), causing a substantial proportion of ATG start codons to be precisely aligned with strong plasmid-encoded promoter and ribosome-binding sequences. Whereas we were unable to select nitroreductases from standard metagenome libraries, our FatI strategy yielded 21 nitroreductases spanning eight different enzyme families, each conferring resistance to the nitro-antibiotic niclosamide and sensitivity to the nitro-prodrug metronidazole. We showed expression could be improved by co-expressing rare tRNAs and encoded proteins purified directly using an embedded His6-tag. In a transgenic zebrafish model of metronidazole-mediated targeted cell ablation, our lead MhqN-family nitroreductase proved ∼5-fold more effective than the canonical nitroreductase NfsB.

Abstract: Intracellular lipid droplets (LDs) are ubiquitous organelles found in many cell types. During mitosis, membranous organelles, including mitochondria, are divided into small pieces and transferred to daughter cells; however, the process of LD transfer to daughter cells is not fully elucidated. Herein, we investigated the behavior of LDs during mitosis in HuH7 human hepatoma cells. While fragments of the Golgi apparatus were scattered in the cytosol during mitosis, intracellular LDs retained their size and spherical morphology as they translocated to the two daughter cells. LDs were initially distributed throughout the cell during prophase but positioned outside the spindle in metaphase, aligning at the far sides of the centrioles. A similar distribution of LDs during mitosis was observed in another hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells. When the spindle was disrupted by nocodazole treatment or never in mitosis gene A-related kinase 2A knockdown, LDs were localized in the area outside the chromosomes, suggesting that spindle formation is not necessary for LD localization at metaphase. The amount of major LD protein perilipin 2 reduced while LDs were enriched in perilipin 3 during mitosis, indicating the potential alteration of LD protein composition. Conclusively, the behavior of LDs during mitosis is distinct from that of other organelles in hepatocytes.

Abstract: Oxidative stress is implicated in numerous diseases, with benzo(α)pyrene (BaP) known for causing substantial oxidative damage. Bifidobacterium longum (B. longum) is recognized as an antioxidant bacterium for certain hosts, yet its influence on oxidative damages instigated by BaP remains undetermined. In our study, we introduced various strains of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) to BaP to trigger oxidative stress, subsequently treating them with different forms of B. longum to evaluate its protective effects. Additionally, we explored the role of daf-16 in this context. Our findings indicated that in wild-type N2 C. elegans, B. longum—even in the form of inactivated bacteria or bacterial ultrasonic lysates (BULs)—significantly extended lifespan. BaP exposure notably decreased lifespan, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and motility, while simultaneously down-regulating the expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-associated genes (sod-3, sek-1, cat-1) and daf-16 downstream genes (sod-3, ctl-2). However, it significantly increased the ROS level, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and lipofuscin accumulation and up-regulated another daf-16 downstream gene (clk-1) (P <0.05). Interestingly, when further treated with B. longum peptide-1 (BLP-1), opposite effects were observed, and all the aforementioned indices changed significantly. In the case of RNAi (daf-16) C. elegans, BaP exposure significantly shortened the lifespan (P <0.05), which was only slightly prolonged upon further treatment with BLP-1. Furthermore, the expression of daf-16 downstream genes showed minor alterations in RNAi C. elegans upon treatment with either BaP or BLP-1. In conclusion, our findings suggest that B. longum acts as a probiotic for C. elegans. BLP-1 was shown to safeguard C. elegans from numerous oxidative damages induced by BaP, but these protective effects were contingent upon the daf-16 gene.

Abstract: Summary
Ketogenic dietary interventions (KDIs) are beneficial in animal models of autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). KETO-ADPKD, an exploratory, randomized, controlled trial, is intended to provide clinical translation of these findings (NCT04680780). Sixty-six patients were randomized to a KDI arm (ketogenic diet [KD] or water fasting [WF]) or the control group. Both interventions induce significant ketogenesis on the basis of blood and breath acetone measurements. Ninety-five percent (KD) and 85% (WF) report the diet as feasible. KD leads to significant reductions in body fat and liver volume. Additionally, KD is associated with reduced kidney volume (not reaching statistical significance). Interestingly, the KD group exhibits improved kidney function at the end of treatment, while the control and WF groups show a progressive decline, as is typical in ADPKD. Safety-relevant events are largely mild, expected (initial flu-like symptoms associated with KD), and transient. Safety assessment is complemented by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) lipid profile analyses.

Abstract: Summary
An automatic prediction of mental health crises can improve caseload prioritization and enable preventative interventions, improving patient outcomes and reducing costs. We combine structured electronic health records (EHRs) with clinical notes from 59,750 de-identified patients to predict the risk of mental health crisis relapse within the next 28 days. The results suggest that an ensemble machine learning model that relies on structured EHRs and clinical notes when available, and relying solely on structured data when the notes are unavailable, offers superior performance over models trained with either of the two data streams alone. Furthermore, the study provides key takeaways related to the required amount of clinical notes to add value in predictive analytics. This study sheds light on the untapped potential of clinical notes in the prediction of mental health crises and highlights the importance of choosing an appropriate machine learning method to combine structured and unstructured EHRs.

Abstract: Summary
Homologous recombination (HR)-mediated DNA repair is a prerequisite for maintaining genome stability. Cancer cells displaying HR deficiency (HRD) are selectively eliminated by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPis). To date, sequencing of HR-associated genes and analyzing genome instability have been used as clinical predictions for PARPi therapy. However, these genetic tests cannot reflect dynamic changes in the HR status. Here, we have developed a virus- and activity-based functional assay to quantify real-time HR activity directly. Instead of focusing on a few HR-associated genes, our functional assay detects endpoint HR activity and establishes an activity threshold for identifying HRD across cancer types, validated by PARPi sensitivity and BRCA status. Notably, this fluorescence-based assay can be applied to primary ovarian cancer cells from patients to reflect their level of HRD, which is associated with survival benefits. Thus, our work provides a functional test to predict the response of primary cancer cells to PARPis.

Abstract: Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a transcriptional regulator, is the predominant factor in modulating oxidative stress and other cellular signaling responses. Studies from our lab and others highlighted that activation of the Nrf2 pathway by small molecules improves endothelial function by suppressing oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. However, the exact mechanisms by which Nrf2 elicits these effects are unknown. In the present study, we developed CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Nrf2 knocked-out human endothelial cells, and proteomic signature was studied using LC-MS/MS. We identified 723 unique proteins, of which 361 proteins were found to be differentially regulated and further screened in the Nrf2ome online database, where we identified a highly interconnected signaling network in which 70 proteins directly interact with Nrf2. These proteins were found to regulate some key cellular and metabolic processes in the regulation actin cytoskeleton, ER stress, angiogenesis, inflammation, Hippo signaling pathway, and epidermal growth factor/fibroblast growth factor (EGF/FGF) signaling pathway. Our findings suggest the role of Nrf2 in maintaining endothelium integrity and its relationship with the crucial cellular processes which help develop novel therapeutics against endothelial dysfunction and its associated complications.

Abstract: Summary
Impaired gastrointestinal motility is associated with gut dysbiosis. Probiotics, such as Bifidobacteria, can improve this bowel disorder; however, efficacy is strain-dependent. We determine that a genetic factor, the abfA cluster governing arabinan utilization, in Bifidobacterium longum impacts treatment efficacy against functional constipation (FC). In mice with FC, B. longum, but not an abfA mutant, improved gastrointestinal transit time, an affect that was dependent upon dietary arabinan. abfA genes were identified in other commensal bacteria, whose effects in ameliorating murine FC were similarly abfA-dependent. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, supplementation with abfA-cluster-carrying B. longum, but not an abfA-deficient strain, enriched arabinan-utilization residents, increased beneficial metabolites, and improved FC symptoms. Across human cohorts, abfA-cluster abundance can predict FC, and transplantation of abfA cluster-enriched human microbiota to FC-induced germ-free mice improved gut motility. Collectively, these findings demonstrate a role for microbial abfA cluster in ameliorating FC, establishing principles for genomics-directed probiotic therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Quantifying cellular characteristics from a large heterogeneous population is essential to identify rare, disease-driving cells. A recent development in the combination of high-throughput screening microscopy with single-cell profiling provides an unprecedented opportunity to decipher disease-driving phenotypes. Accurately and instantly processing large amounts of image data, however, remains a technical challenge when an analysis output is required minutes after data acquisition. Here, we present fast and accurate real-time cell tracking (FACT). FACT can segment ∼20,000 cells in an average of 2.5 s (1.9–93.5 times faster than the state of the art). It can export quantifiable features minutes after data acquisition (independent of the number of acquired image frames) with an average of 90%–96% precision. We apply FACT to identify directionally migrating glioblastoma cells with 96% precision and irregular cell lineages from a 24 h movie with an average F1 score of 0.91.

Abstract: Plants trigger endoplasmic reticulum (ER) pathways to survive stresses, but the assistance of ER in plant tolerance still needs to be explored. Thus, we selected sensitive and tolerant contrasting abiotic stress sorghum varieties to test if they present a degree of tolerance to ER stress. Accordingly, this work evaluated crescent concentrations of tunicamycin (TM µg mL−1): control (0), lower (0.5), mild (1.5), and higher (2.5) on the initial establishment of sorghum seedlings CSF18 and CSF20. ER stress promoted growth and metabolism reductions, mainly in CSF18, from mild to higher TM. The lowest TM increased SbBiP and SbPDI chaperones, as well as SbbZIP60, and SbbIRE1 gene expressions, but mild and higher TM decreased it. However, CSF20 exhibited higher levels of SbBiP and SbbIRE1 transcripts. It corroborated different metabolic profiles among all TM treatments in CSF18 shoots and similarities between profiles of mild and higher TM in CSF18 roots. Conversely, TM profiles of both shoots and roots of CSF20 overlapped, although it was not complete under low TM treatment. Furthermore, ER stress induced an increase of carbohydrates (dihydroxyacetone in shoots, and cellobiose, maltose, ribose, and sucrose in roots), and organic acids (pyruvic acid in shoots, and butyric and succinic acids in roots) in CSF20, which exhibited a higher degree of ER stress tolerance compared to CSF18 with the root being the most affected plant tissue. Thus, our study provides new insights that may help to understand sorghum tolerance and the ER disturbance as significant contributor for stress adaptation and tolerance engineering.

Abstract: Summary
Despite potential impact on the graft vs. leukemia (GVL) effect, immunotherapy targeting CTLA-4 and/or PD-1 has not been successfully combined with bone marrow transplant (BMT) because it exacerbates graft vs. host disease (GVHD). Here, using models of GVHD and leukemia, we demonstrate that targeting hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) via pharmacological or genetic approaches reduces GVHD by inducing PDL1 expression on host tissue while selectively inhibiting PDL1 in leukemia cells to enhance the GVL effect. More importantly, combination of HIF1α inhibition with anti-CTLA-4 antibodies allows simultaneous inhibition of both PDL1 and CTLA-4 checkpoints to achieve better outcomes in models of mouse and human BMT-leukemia settings. These findings provide an approach to enhance the curative effect of BMT for leukemia and broaden the impact of cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: In the study of tumorigenesis, the involvement of molecules within the extracellular matrix (ECM) is crucial. ADAMTSs (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin motifs), a group of secreted proteases known for their role in ECM remodeling, were primarily considered to be extracellular proteases. However, our research specifically detected ADAMTS-1, a member of this family, predominantly within the nucleus of mammary cells. Our main objective was to understand the mechanism of ADAMTS-1 translocation to the nucleus and its functional significance in this cellular compartment. Our investigation uncovered that nuclear ADAMTS-1 was present in cells exhibiting an epithelial phenotype, while cells of mesenchymal origin contained the protease in the cytoplasm. Moreover, disruption of ADAMTS-1 secretion, induced by Monensin treatment, resulted in its accumulation in the cytoplasm. Notably, our research indicated that alterations in the secretory pathways could influence the protease's compartmentalization. Additionally, experiments with conditioned medium from cells containing nuclear ADAMTS-1 demonstrated its internalization into the nucleus by HT-1080 cells and fibroblasts. Furthermore, heightened levels of ADAMTS-1 within the ECM reduced the migratory potential of mesenchymal cells. This highlights the potential significance of nuclear ADAMTS-1 as a critical component within the tumor microenvironment due to its functional activity in this specific cellular compartment.

Abstract: Human Hsp70-escort protein 1 (hHep1) is a cochaperone that assists in the function and stability of mitochondrial HSPA9. Similar to HSPA9, hHep1 is located outside the mitochondria and can interact with liposomes. In this study, we further investigated the structural and thermodynamic behavior of interactions between hHep1 and negatively charged liposomes, as well as interactions with cellular membranes. Our results showed that hHep1 interacts peripherally with liposomes formed by phosphatidylserine and cardiolipin and remains partially structured, exhibiting similar affinities for both. In addition, after being added to the cell membrane, recombinant hHep1 was incorporated by cells in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, the association of HSPA9 with hHep1 improved the incorporation of these proteins into the lipid bilayer. These results demonstrated that hHep1 can interact with lipids also present in the plasma membrane, indicating roles for this cochaperone outside of mitochondria.

Abstract: Summary
Retinoic acid (RA) induces an atrial phenotype in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), but expression of atrium-selective currents such as the ultrarapid (IKur) and acetylcholine-stimulated K+ current is variable and less than in the adult human atrium. We suspected methodological issues and systematically investigated the concentration dependency of RA. RA treatment increased IKur concentration dependently from 1.1 ± 0.54 pA/pF (0 RA) to 3.8 ± 1.1, 5.8 ± 2.5, and 12.2 ± 4.3 at 0.01, 0.1, and 1 μM, respectively. Only 1 μM RA induced enough IKur to fully reproduce human atrial action potential (AP) shape and a robust shortening of APs upon carbachol. We found that sterile filtration caused substantial loss of RA. We conclude that 1 μM RA seems to be necessary and sufficient to induce a full atrial AP shape in hiPSC-CM in EHT format. RA concentrations are prone to methodological issues and may profoundly impact the success of atrial differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the biological changes that precede a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) could facilitate pre-emptive interventions, including risk factor modification, but this pre-clinical phase of disease remains poorly characterized. Using measurements from 17 hematological and biochemical parameters taken up to 10 years before diagnosis in over 20,000 IBD patients and population controls, we address this at massive scale. We observe widespread significant changes in multiple biochemical and hematological parameters that occur up to 8 years before diagnosis of Crohn’s disease (CD) and up to 3 years before diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. These changes far exceed previous expectations regarding the length of this pre-diagnostic phase, revealing an opportunity for earlier intervention, especially in CD. In summary, using a nationwide, case-control dataset—obtained from the Danish registers—we provide a comprehensive characterization of the hematological and biochemical changes that occur in the pre-clinical phase of IBD.

Abstract: Summary
Despite small cell lung cancers (SCLCs) having a high mutational burden, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) immunotherapy only modestly increases survival. A subset of SCLCs that lose their ASCL1 neuroendocrine phenotype and restore innate immune signaling (termed the “inflammatory” subtype) have durable responses to PD-L1. Some SCLCs are highly sensitive to Aurora kinase inhibitors, but early-phase trials show short-lived responses, suggesting effective therapeutic combinations are needed to increase their durability. Using immunocompetent SCLC genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) and syngeneic xenografts, we show durable efficacy with the combination of a highly specific Aurora A kinase inhibitor (LSN3321213) and PD-L1. LSN3321213 causes accumulation of tumor cells in mitosis with lower ASCL1 expression and higher expression of interferon target genes and antigen-presentation genes mimicking the inflammatory subtype in a cell-cycle-dependent manner. These data demonstrate that inflammatory gene expression is restored in mitosis in SCLC, which can be exploited by Aurora A kinase inhibition.

Abstract: Summary
Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) with fiber-free diets is an effective steroid-sparing treatment to induce clinical remission in children with Crohn’s disease (CD). However, the mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of EEN remains obscure. Using a model of microbiota-dependent colitis with the hallmarks of CD, we find that the administration of a fiber-free diet prevents the development of colitis and inhibits intestinal inflammation in colitic animals. Remarkably, fiber-free diet alters the intestinal localization of Mucispirillum schaedleri, a mucus-dwelling pathobiont, which is required for triggering disease. Mechanistically, the absence of dietary fiber reduces nutrient availability and impairs the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia (DNRA) metabolic pathway of Mucispirillum, leading to its exclusion from the mucus layer and disease remission. Thus, appropriate localization of the specific pathobiont in the mucus layer is critical for disease development, which is disrupted by fiber exclusion. These results suggest strategies to treat CD by targeting the intestinal niche and metabolism of disease-causing microbes.

Abstract: The human muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α12β1δε (nAChR) is a complex transmembrane receptor needed for drug screening for disorders like congenital myasthenic syndromes and multiple pterygium syndrome. Until today, most models are still using the nAChR from Torpedo californica electric ray. A simple reproducible cellular system expressing functional human muscle-type nAChR is still missing. This study addressed this issue and further tested the hypothesis that different chaperones, both biological and chemical, and posttranslational modification supporting substances as well as hypothermic incubation are able to increase the nAChR yield. Therefore, Gibson cloning was used to generate transfer plasmids carrying the sequence of nAChR or chosen biological chaperones to support the nAChR folding in the cellular host. Viral transduction was used for stable integration of these transgenes in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO). Proteins were detected with Western blot, in-cell and on-cell Western, and the function of the receptor with voltage clamp analysis. We show that the internalization of nAChR into plasma membranes was sufficient for detection and function. Additional transgenic overexpression of biological chaperones did result in a reduced nAChR expression. Chemical chaperones, posttranslational modification supporting substances, and hypothermic conditions are well-suited supporting applications to increase the protein levels of different subunits. This study presents a stable and functional cell line that expresses human muscle-type nAChR and yields can be further increased using the chemical chaperone nicotine without affecting cell viability. The simplified access to this model system should enable numerous applications beyond drug development.

Abstract: Heat stress can cause testicular damage and affect male fertility. Tanshinone IIA (TSA) is a monomer substance derived from plants, with antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects. Whether it can repair testicular damage caused by heat stress is unclear. This study aims to construct a mouse testicular heat stress injury model and intervene with TSA. Various methods such as histopathology, high-throughput sequencing, bioinformatics analysis, and molecular biology were used to investigate whether TSA can alleviate heat stress-induced testicular injury and its mechanism. Results showed that heat stress significantly reduced the diameter of the mouse seminiferous tubules, increased cell apoptosis in the testicular tissue, and significantly decreased testosterone levels. After TSA intervention, testicular morphology and cell apoptosis improved significantly, and testosterone secretion function was restored. High-throughput transcriptome sequencing found that key differentially expressed genes between the HS group and the control and TSA groups clustered in the apoptosis and TGFβ signaling pathways. Using western blot technology, we found that the HS group upregulated TGFβ1/Smad2/Smad3 pathway protein expression, causing cell apoptosis, testicular tissue organic lesions, and affecting testicular secretion function. Through TSA intervention, we found that it can inhibit TGFβ1/Smad2/Smad3 pathway protein expression, thereby restoring testicular damage caused by heat stress. This study confirms that TSA can effectively restore testicular damage caused by heat stress in mice, possibly by inhibiting the TGFβ1/Smad2/Smad3 pathway to suppress apoptosis.

Abstract: Summary
Chronic ocular graft-versus-host disease (oGVHD) is a common complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) and can lead to vision loss if not diagnosed and treated promptly. Currently, no approved drugs exist for oGVHD treatment. However, umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs) have known immunoregulatory properties and have been employed in clinical trials for immune-mediated diseases. To address oGVHD, the application of UCMSCs to the ocular surface is a logical approach. Intravenous administration of UCMSCs poses risks, necessitating topical and local delivery. Retaining UCMSCs on the ocular surface remains a challenge. To overcome this, we invented mesenchymal stem cell-coating high oxygen-permeable hydrogel lenses combining UCMSCs and machinery to enable the long-term retention of UCMSCs on the ocular surface. Animal model experiments demonstrated that these lenses effectively retained UCMSCs, providing therapeutic benefits by decreasing corneal inflammation and damage, and inhibiting immune rejection and response, all crucial aspects in oGVHD treatment.

Abstract: Summary
The rising prevalence of obesity and metabolic disorders worldwide highlights the urgent need to find new long-term and clinically meaningful weight-loss therapies. Here, we evaluate the therapeutic potential and the mechanism of action of a biomimetic cellulose-based oral superabsorbent hydrogel (OSH). Treatment with OSH exerts effects on intestinal tissue and gut microbiota composition, functioning like a protective dynamic exoskeleton. It protects from gut barrier permeability disruption and induces rapid and consistent changes in the gut microbiota composition, specifically fostering Akkermansia muciniphila expansion. The mechanobiological, physical, and chemical structures of the gel are required for A. muciniphila growth. OSH treatment induces weight loss and reduces fat accumulation, in both preventative and therapeutic settings. OSH usage also prevents liver steatosis, immune infiltration, and fibrosis, limiting the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Our work shows the potential of using OSH as a non-systemic mechanobiological approach to treat metabolic syndrome and its comorbidities.

Abstract: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is causative of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S-protein) plays an important role in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection through efficient interaction with ACE2. The S-protein is produced by RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, that were fundamental for the reduction of the viral spread within the population and the clinical severity of COVID-19. However, the S-protein has been hypothesized to be responsible for damaging cells of several tissues and for some important side effects of RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. Considering the impact of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 infection on the hematopoietic system, the aim of this study was to verify the effect of the BNT162b2 vaccine on erythroid differentiation of the human K562 cell line, that has been in the past intensively studied as a model system mimicking some steps of erythropoiesis. In this context, we focused on hemoglobin production and induced expression of embryo-fetal globin genes, that are among the most important features of K562 erythroid differentiation. We found that the BNT162b2 vaccine suppresses mithramycin-induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. Reverse-transcription-qPCR and Western blotting assays demonstrated that suppression of erythroid differentiation was associated with sharp inhibition of the expression of α-globin and γ-globin mRNA accumulation. Inhibition of accumulation of ζ-globin and ε-globin mRNAs was also observed. In addition, we provide in silico studies suggesting a direct interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and Hb Portland, that is the major hemoglobin produced by K562 cells. This study thus provides information suggesting the need of great attention on possible alteration of hematopoietic parameters following SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or COVID-19 vaccination.

Abstract: Summary
In early vertebrate development, organizer regions—groups of cells that signal to and thereby influence neighboring cells by secreted morphogens—play pivotal roles in the establishment and maintenance of cell identities within defined tissue territories. The midbrain-hindbrain organizer drives regionalization of neural tissue into midbrain and hindbrain territories with fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) acting as a key morphogen. This organizer has been extensively studied in chicken, mouse, and zebrafish. Here, we demonstrate the enrichment of FGF8-expressing cells from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), cultured as attached embryoid bodies using antibodies that recognize "Similar Expression to Fgf" (SEF) and Frizzled proteins. The arrangement of cells in embryoid body subsets of these cultures and the gene expression profile of the FGF8-expressing population show certain similarities to the midbrain-hindbrain organizer in animal models. In the embryonic chick brain, the enriched cell population induces formation of midbrain structures, consistent with FGF8-organizing capability.

Abstract: HspB5/alphaB-crystallin is an ubiquitously expressed member of the small heat shock protein family which help cells to survive cellular stress conditions and are also implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs fine-tuning protein expression mainly by inhibiting the translation of target genes. Our earlier finding of an increase in HspB5/alphaB-crystallin protein amount after heat shock in rat hippocampal neurons without a concomitant increase of mRNA prompted us to look for microRNAs as a posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism. Microarray miRNA expression data of rat hippocampal neurons under control and stress conditions in combination with literature search, miRNA binding site prediction and conservation of target sites yielded nine candidate microRNAs. Of these candidates, five (miR-101a-3p, miR-129-2-3p, miR-330-5p, miR-376b-3p, and miR-491-5p) were able to convey a downregulation by binding to the HspB5 3′- or 5′-UTR in a luciferase reporter gene assay while one (miR-140-5p) led to an upregulation. Overexpression of these six microRNAs in C6 glioma cells showed that three of them (miR-101a-3p, miR-140-5p, and miR-376b-3p) regulated endogenous HspB5 protein amount significantly in the same direction as in the reporter gene assay. In addition, overexpression of miR-330-5p and miR-491-5p in C6 cells resulted in regulation of HspB5 in the opposite direction as expected from the luciferase assay. Analysis of miRNA expression in rat hippocampal neurons after cellular stress by qPCR showed that miR-491-5p was not expressed in these cells. In total, we therefore identified four microRNAs, namely miR-101a-3p, miR-140-5p, miR-330-5p, and miR-376b-3p, which can regulate rat HspB5 directly or indirectly.

Abstract: The Warburg effect links growth and glycolysis in cancer. A key purpose of the Warburg effect is to generate glycolytic intermediates for anabolic reactions, such as nucleotides → RNA/DNA and amino acids → protein synthesis. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a similar ‘glycolysis-for-anabolism’ metabolic reprogramming also occurs in hypertrophying skeletal muscle. To interrogate this, we first induced C2C12 myotube hypertrophy with IGF-1. We then added 14C glucose to the differentiation medium and measured radioactivity in isolated protein and RNA to establish whether 14C had entered anabolism. We found that especially protein became radioactive, suggesting a glucose → glycolytic intermediates → non-essential amino acid(s) → protein series of reactions, the rate of which was increased by IGF-1. Next, to investigate the importance of glycolytic flux and non-essential amino acid synthesis for myotube hypertrophy, we exposed C2C12 and primary mouse myotubes to the glycolysis inhibitor 2-Deoxy-d-glucose (2DG). We found that inhibiting glycolysis lowered C2C12 and primary myotube size. Similarly, siRNA silencing of PHGDH, the key enzyme of the serine biosynthesis pathway, decreased C2C12 and primary myotube size; whereas retroviral PHGDH overexpression increased C2C12 myotube size. Together these results suggest that glycolysis is important for hypertrophying myotubes, which reprogram their metabolism to facilitate anabolism, similar to cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
Patients with biliary tract cancer (BTC) show different responses to chemotherapy, and there is no effective way to predict chemotherapeutic response. We have generated 61 BTC patient-derived organoids (PDOs) from 82 tumors (74.4%) that show similar histological and genetic characteristics to the corresponding primary BTC tissues. BTC tumor tissues with enhanced stemness- and proliferation-related gene expression by RNA sequencing can more easily form organoids. As expected, BTC PDOs show different responses to the chemotherapies of gemcitabine, cisplatin, 5-fluoruracil, oxaliplatin, etc. The drug screening results in PDOs are further validated in PDO-based xenografts and confirmed in 92.3% (12/13) of BTC patients with actual clinical response. Moreover, we have identified gene expression signatures of BTC PDOs with different drug responses and established gene expression panels to predict chemotherapy response in BTC patients. In conclusion, BTC PDO is a promising precision medicine tool for anti-cancer therapy in BTC patients.

Abstract: Allergic asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of airways involving complex mechanisms, including MAS-related GPR family member X2 (MRGPRX2) and its orthologue MRGPRB2 on mast cells (MCs). Although miRNAs have been previously shown to related to allergic asthma, the role of miR-212/132 in this process has not been studied. In this study, the predicted pairing of miRNAs and MRGPRX2 (MRGPRB2) mRNAs was carried out by online databases and the function was verify using in vivo and in vitro experiments. Database prediction showed that miR-212/132 interact with MRGPRX2 and MRGPRB2. miR-212/132 mimics alleviated MRGPRB2 mRNA expression as well as pathology changes in lungs and AHR of mice with airway inflammation in vivo. The expression level of MRGPRB2 in the mice lungs after inhaled OVA was also decreased by miR-212/132 mimics. Meanwhile, miR-212/132 inhibited MCs degranulation and cytokines release triggered by C48/80 in vitro. Further, ASAP1 (ARF GTPase-Activating Protein 1) was selected from the junction related pathways using RNAseq and KEGG enrichment. ASAP1 mRNA level was upregulated in airway inflammation and MCs activation and decreased by miR-212/132 mimics. miR-212/132 attenuated OVA-induced airway inflammation by inhibiting MCs activation through MRGPRX2 and ASAP1.

Abstract: Summary
The post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), also known as long COVID, is often associated with debilitating symptoms and adverse multisystem consequences. We obtain plasma samples from 117 individuals during and 6 months following their acute phase of infection to comprehensively profile and assess changes in cytokines, proteome, and metabolome. Network analysis reveals sustained inflammatory response, platelet degranulation, and cellular activation during convalescence accompanied by dysregulation in arginine biosynthesis, methionine metabolism, taurine metabolism, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle processes. Furthermore, we develop a prognostic model composed of 20 molecules involved in regulating T cell exhaustion and energy metabolism that can reliably predict adverse clinical outcomes following discharge from acute infection with 83% accuracy and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.96. Our study reveals pertinent biological processes during convalescence that differ from acute infection, and it supports the development of specific therapies and biomarkers for patients suffering from long COVID.

Abstract: Summary
The clinical utility of human interleukin-2 (hIL-2) is limited by its short serum half-life, preferential activation of regulatory T (TReg) over immune effector cells, and dose-limiting toxicities. We previously engineered F10 immunocytokine (IC), an intramolecularly assembled cytokine/antibody fusion protein that linked hIL-2 to an anti-IL-2 antibody (denoted F10) that extended IL-2 half-life and augmented the immune effector to TReg ratio. Here, we leveraged molecular engineering to improve the anti-tumor therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of F10 IC by developing an iteration, denoted F10 IC-CBD (collagen binding domain), designed for intratumoral administration and in situ retention based on collagen affinity. F10 IC-CBD retained IL-2 bioactivity exclusively in the tumor and eliminated IL-2-associated toxicities. Furthermore, F10 IC exhibited potent single-agent therapeutic efficacy and synergy with systemic immune checkpoint blockade and elicited an abscopal response in mouse tumors models. This engineered fusion protein presents a prototype for the design of intratumoral therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Amphitropic proteins and peptides reversibly partition from solution to membrane, a key process that regulates their functions. Experimental approaches classically used to measure protein partitioning into lipid bilayers, such as fluorescence and circular dichroism, are hardly usable when the peptides or proteins do not exhibit significant polarity and/or conformational changes upon membrane binding. Here, we describe binding to lipid vesicles (B2LiVe), a simple, robust, and widely applicable nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) method to determine the solution-to-membrane partitioning of unlabeled proteins or peptides. B2LiVe relies on previously described proton 1D-NMR fast-pulsing techniques. Membrane partitioning induces a large line broadening, leading to a loss of protein signals; therefore, the decrease of the NMR signal directly measures the fraction of membrane-bound protein. The method uses low polypeptide concentrations and has been validated on several membrane-interacting polypeptides, ranging from 3 to 54 kDa, with membrane vesicles of different sizes and various lipid compositions.

Abstract: Cellular biology research relies on microscopic imaging techniques for studying the complex structures and dynamic processes within cells. Fluorescence microscopy provides high sensitivity and subcellular resolution but has limitations such as photobleaching and sample preparation challenges. Transmission light microscopy offers a label-free alternative but lacks contrast for detailed interpretation. Deep learning methods have shown promise in analyzing cell images and extracting meaningful information. However, accurately learning and simulating diverse subcellular structures remain challenging. In this study, we propose a method named three-dimensional cell neural architecture search (3DCNAS) to predict subcellular structures of fluorescence using unlabeled transmitted light microscope images. By leveraging the automated search capability of differentiable neural architecture search (NAS), our method partially mitigates the issues of overfitting and underfitting caused by the distinct details of various subcellular structures. Furthermore, we apply our method to analyze cell dynamics in genome-edited human induced pluripotent stem cells during mitotic events. This allows us to study the functional roles of organelles and their involvement in cellular processes, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of cell biology and offering insights into disease pathogenesis.

Abstract: Ischemic heart failure (HF) is one of the leading causes of global morbidity and mortality; blocking the apoptotic cascade could help improve adverse outcomes of it. RNA-binding motif protein 25 (RBM25) is an RNA-binding protein related to apoptosis; however, its role remains unknown in ischemic HF. The main purpose of this study is to explore the mechanism of RBM25 in ischemic HF. Establishing an ischemic HF model and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) model. ELISA was performed to evaluate the BNP level in the ischemic HF model. Echocardiography and histological analysis were performed to assess cardiac function and infarct size. Proteins were quantitatively and locationally analyzed by western blotting and immunofluorescence. The morphological changes of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) were observed with ER-tracker. Cardiac function and myocardial injury were observed in ischemic HF rats. RBM25 was elevated in cardiomyocytes of hypoxia injury hearts and localized in nucleus both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, cell apoptosis was significantly increased when overexpressed RBM25. Moreover, ER stress stimulated upregulation of RBM25 and promoted cell apoptosis through the CHOP related pathway. Finally, inhibiting the expression of RBM25 could ameliorate the apoptosis and improve cardiac function through blocking the activation of CHOP signaling pathway. RBM25 is significantly upregulated in ischemic HF rat heart and OGD model, which leads to apoptosis by modulating the ER stress through CHOP pathway. Knockdown of RBM25 could reverse apoptosis-mediated cardiac dysfunction. RBM25 may be a promising target for the treatment of ischemic HF.

Abstract: Estrogens have been demonstrated to inhibit age-related cognitive decline via binding to estrogen receptors (ERs). As a natural flavonoid component of Cuscuta Chinensis Lam., Kaempferol-3-O-glucoside (K-3-G) not only possesses anti-neuroinflammatory potential but also functions as an agonist for ERα and ERβ. This study aimed to determine whether K-3-G improved cognition during the aging process, with an emphasis on its effect on microglial inflammation. In vivo, K-3-G (5 or 10 mg/kg/day) was orally given to the senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mice from six to eight-month old. In addition to mitigating the memory and learning deficits of SAMP8 mice, K-3-G upregulated the expression of ERα and ERβ in their hippocampal CA1 region, with the higher dose being more effective. Less Iba-1+ microglial cells presented in SAMP8 mice treated with K-3-G. The formation of NLR Family Pyrin Domain Containing 3 (NLRP3) complex, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress-related markers, as well as expression of pro-apoptotic proteins were reduced by K-3-G. In vitro, BV2 microglial cells exposed to oligomeric amyloid beta (Aβ)1-42 were treated with 100 μM K-3-G. K-3-G showed similar anti-inflammatory effects on BV2 cells as in vivo. K-3-G-induced alterations were partly diminished by fulvestrant, an ER antagonist. Moreover, dual-luciferase reporter system demonstrated that K-3-G induced ER expression by activating the transcription of estrogen-response elements (EREs). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that K-3-G may be a novel therapeutic agent for senescence-related cognitive impairment by inhibiting microglial inflammation through its action on ERs.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest cancers, which lacks effective therapies. Here, we demonstrate that the transcription factor, homeobox C6 (HOXC6), is overexpressed in most PDACs, and its inhibition blocks PDAC tumor growth and metastasis. HOXC6 transcriptionally activates tumor-promoting kinase MSK1 and suppresses tumor-inhibitory protein PPP2R2B in PDAC. HOXC6-induced PPP2R2B suppression causes mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway activation, which facilitates PDAC growth. Also, MSK1 upregulation by HOXC6 is necessary for PDAC growth because of its ability to suppress apoptosis via its substrate DDX17. Combinatorial pharmacological inhibition of MSK1 and mTOR potently suppressed PDAC tumor growth and metastasis in PDAC mouse models. PDAC cells with acquired resistance to MSK1/mTOR-inhibitors displayed activated insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) signaling and were successfully eradicated by IGF1R inhibitor. Furthermore, MEK inhibitor trametinib enhanced the efficacy of dual MSK1 and mTOR inhibition. Collectively, these results identify therapeutic vulnerabilities of PDAC and an approach to overcome acquired drug resistance to prolong therapeutic benefit.

Abstract: Summary
In clinical practice, the co-existence of endometriosis and gastrointestinal symptoms is often observed. Using large-scale datasets, we report a genetic correlation between endometriosis and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), peptic ulcer disease (PUD), gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GORD), and a combined GORD/PUD medicated (GPM) phenotype. Mendelian randomization analyses support a causal relationship between genetic predisposition to endometriosis and IBS and GPM. Identification of shared risk loci highlights biological pathways that may contribute to the pathogenesis of both diseases, including estrogen regulation and inflammation, and potential therapeutic drug targets (CCKBR; PDE4B). Higher use of IBS, GORD, and PUD medications in women with endometriosis and higher use of hormone therapies in women with IBS, GORD, and PUD, support the co-occurrence of these conditions and highlight the potential for drug repositioning and drug contraindications. Our results provide evidence of shared disease etiology and have important clinical implications for diagnostic and treatment decisions for both diseases.

Abstract: Metabolic disorders, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and metabolic syndrome (MS) are related to chronic pro-inflammatory conditions. Evidence suggests that heat shock proteins are linked to metabolic disorders. Intracellular HSP70 (iHSP70) is mandatory for normal insulin signalling, and proteostasis, and exerts a powerful anti-inflammatory role. On the other hand, the extracellular (eHSP72) is linked with a pro-inflammatory state and induces insulin resistance in humans. Then, we conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis to summarize the data of HSP70 in people with and without metabolic disorders. PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were used. Eligibility criteria included observational and baseline data of experimental studies that assessed iHSP70 and/or eHSP72 in adults with metabolic disorders and healthy people. The risk of bias was assessed by the Newcastle–Ottawa scale. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effect model and the mean difference was estimated for eHSP72 and the standardized mean difference for iHSP70. A total of 11,255 articles were retrieved, 31 articles were assessed for eligibility and 15 were included for data extraction. There was no difference in eHSP72 between metabolic disorders and healthy controls (mean difference (MD) = 0.11; 95% confidence interval (CIs) = -0.05 to 0.27; I2 = 95%). Subgroup analysis showed higher levels of eHSP72 in T2DM people than healthy ones (MD = 0.32; 95% CIs = 0.17 to 0.47; I2 = 92%). For iHSP70 no difference was found (standardized mean difference (SMD) =—0.24; 95% CIs =—1.62 to 1.15; I2 = 86%). Our results suggest that eHSP72 levels may be dependent on metabolic condition and no difference in iHSP70 levels are attributed to high heterogeneity level between studies (PROSPERO REGISTRATION: CRD42022323514).

Abstract: Summary
Pain in rodents is often inferred from their withdrawal from noxious stimulation. Threshold stimulus intensity or response latency is used to quantify pain sensitivity. This usually involves applying stimuli by hand and measuring responses by eye, which limits reproducibility and throughput. We describe a device that standardizes and automates pain testing by providing computer-controlled aiming, stimulation, and response measurement. Optogenetic and thermal stimuli are applied using blue and infrared light, respectively. Precise mechanical stimulation is also demonstrated. Reflectance of red light is used to measure paw withdrawal with millisecond precision. We show that consistent stimulus delivery is crucial for resolving stimulus-dependent variations in withdrawal and for testing with sustained stimuli. Moreover, substage video reveals “spontaneous” behaviors for consideration alongside withdrawal metrics to better assess the pain experience. The entire process was automated using machine learning. RAMalgo (reproducible automated multimodal algometry) improves the standardization, comprehensiveness, and throughput of preclinical pain testing.

Abstract: Summary
In preclinical models, α-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) inhibitor, delays the onset of type 1 diabetes (T1D) by reducing β cell stress. However, the mechanism of DFMO action and its human tolerability remain unclear. In this study, we show that mice with β cell ODC deletion are protected against toxin-induced diabetes, suggesting a cell-autonomous role of ODC during β cell stress. In a randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02384889) involving 41 recent-onset T1D subjects (3:1 drug:placebo) over a 3-month treatment period with a 3-month follow-up, DFMO (125–1,000 mg/m2) is shown to meet its primary outcome of safety and tolerability. DFMO dose-dependently reduces urinary putrescine levels and, at higher doses, preserves C-peptide area under the curve without apparent immunomodulation. Transcriptomics and proteomics of DFMO-treated human islets exposed to cytokine stress reveal alterations in mRNA translation, nascent protein transport, and protein secretion. These findings suggest that DFMO may preserve β cell function in T1D through islet cell-autonomous effects.

Abstract: Summary
Mesothelioma is classified into three histological subtypes, epithelioid, sarcomatoid, and biphasic, according to the relative proportions of epithelioid and sarcomatoid tumor cells present. Current guidelines recommend that the sarcomatoid component of each mesothelioma is quantified, as a higher percentage of sarcomatoid pattern in biphasic mesothelioma shows poorer prognosis. In this work, we develop a dual-task graph neural network (GNN) architecture with ranking loss to learn a model capable of scoring regions of tissue down to cellular resolution. This allows quantitative profiling of a tumor sample according to the aggregate sarcomatoid association score. Tissue is represented by a cell graph with both cell-level morphological and regional features. We use an external multicentric test set from Mesobank, on which we demonstrate the predictive performance of our model. We additionally validate our model predictions through an analysis of the typical morphological features of cells according to their predicted score.

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the neuroprotective effect of Melissa officinalis extract (MEE) against brain damage associated with hypothyroidism induced by propylthiouracil (PTU) and/or γ-radiation (IR) in rats. Hypothyroidism induction and/or exposure to IR resulted in a significant decrease in the serum levels of T3 and T4 associated with increased levels of lipid peroxidation end product, malondialdehyde (MDA), and nitrites (NO) in the brain tissue homogenate. Also, hypothyroidism and /or exposure to IR markedly enhance the endoplasmic reticulum stress by upregulating the gene expressions of the protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), activated transcription factor 6 (ATF6), endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD), and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) in the brain tissue homogenate associated with a proapoptotic state which indicated by the overexpression of Bax, BCl2, and caspase-12 that culminates in brain damage. Meanwhile, the PTU and /or IR-exposed rats treated with MEE reduced oxidative stress and ERAD through ATF6. Also, the MEE treatment prevented the Bax and caspase-12 gene expression from increasing. This treatment in hypothyroid animals was associated with neuronal protection as indicated by the downregulation in the gene expressions of the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) and amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the brain tissue. Furthermore, the administration of MEE ameliorates the histological structure of brain tissue. In conclusion, MEE might prevent hypothyroidism-induced brain damage associated with oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress.

Abstract: Summary
Congenital heart disease often arises from perturbations of transcription factors (TFs) that guide cardiac development. ISLET1 (ISL1) is a TF that influences early cardiac cell fate, as well as differentiation of other cell types including motor neuron progenitors (MNPs) and pancreatic islet cells. While lineage specificity of ISL1 function is likely achieved through combinatorial interactions, its essential cardiac interacting partners are unknown. By assaying ISL1 genomic occupancy in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac progenitors (CPs) or MNPs and leveraging the deep learning approach BPNet, we identified motifs of other TFs that predicted ISL1 occupancy in each lineage, with NKX2.5 and GATA motifs being most closely associated to ISL1 in CPs. Experimentally, nearly two-thirds of ISL1-bound loci were co-occupied by NKX2.5 and/or GATA4. Removal of NKX2.5 from CPs led to widespread ISL1 redistribution, and overexpression of NKX2.5 in MNPs led to ISL1 occupancy of CP-specific loci. These results reveal how ISL1 guides lineage choices through a combinatorial code that dictates genomic occupancy and transcription.

Abstract: Summary
Due to the enhanced labeling capability of maleimide-based fluorescent probes, lysine-cysteine-lysine (KCK) tags are frequently added to proteins for visualization. In this study, we employed an in vitro single-molecule DNA flow-stretching assay as a sensitive way to assess the impact of the KCK tag on the property of DNA-binding proteins. Using Bacillus subtilis ParB as an example, we show that, although no noticeable changes were detected by in vivo fluorescence imaging and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, the KCK tag substantially altered ParB’s DNA compaction rates and its response to nucleotide binding and to the presence of the specific sequence (parS) on the DNA. While it is typically assumed that short peptide tags minimally perturb protein function, our results urge researchers to carefully validate the use of tags for protein labeling. Our comprehensive analysis can be expanded and used as a guide to assess the impacts of other tags on DNA-binding proteins in single-molecule assays.

Abstract: Summary
Adrenal insufficiency is a life-threatening condition resulting from the inability to produce adrenal hormones in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Establishing a cell-based therapy would provide a physiologically responsive approach for the treatment of this condition. We report the generation of large numbers of human-induced steroidogenic cells (hiSCs) from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). Directed differentiation of hPSCs into hiSCs recapitulates the initial stages of human adrenal development. Following expression of steroidogenic factor 1, activation of protein kinase A signaling drives a steroidogenic gene expression profile most comparable to human fetal adrenal cells, and leads to dynamic secretion of steroid hormones, in vitro. Moreover, expression of the adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) receptor/co-receptor (MC2R/MRAP) results in dose-dependent ACTH responsiveness. This protocol recapitulates adrenal insufficiency resulting from loss-of-function mutations in AAAS, which cause the enigmatic triple A syndrome. Our differentiation protocol generates sufficient numbers of hiSCs for cell-based therapy and offers a platform to study disorders causing adrenal insufficiency.

Ca2+-activated K+ channels modulate membrane potential in the human parathyroid cell: Possible role in exocytosis,

Abstract: The relationships between parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion and parathyroid cell membrane potential, including the identities and roles of K+ channels that regulate and/or modulate membrane potential are not well defined. Here we have used Western blot/immunohistochemistry as well as patch-clamp and perifusion techniques to identify and localize specific K+ channels in parathyroid cells and to investigate their roles in the control of membrane potential and PTH secretion. We also re-investigated the relationship between membrane potential and exocytosis. We showed that in single human parathyroid cells K+ current is dependent on at least two types of Ca2+-activated K+ channels: a small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel (KSK) and a large-conductance voltage and Ca2+-activated K+ channel (KBK). These channels were sensitive to specific peptide blocking toxins including apamin, charybdotoxin, and iberiotoxin. These channels confer sensitivity of the membrane potential in single cells to high extracellular K+, TEA, and peptide toxins. Blocking of KBK potently inhibited K+ channel current, and KBK was shown to be expressed in the plasma membrane of parathyroid cells. In addition, when using the capacitance technique as an indicator of exocytosis, clamping the parathyroid cell at −60 mV prevented exocytosis, whereas holding the membrane potential at 0 mV facilitated it. Taken together, the results show that human parathyroid cells have functional KBK and KSK channels but the data presented herein suggest that KBK/KSK channels likely contribute to the maintenance of the membrane potential, and that membrane potential, per se, modulates exocytosis independently of [Ca2+]i.

Abstract: Intracellular calcium dysregulation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction are some of the main pathway contributors towards disease progression in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). This study is aimed at investigating the effects of light emitting diode therapy (LEDT) and idebenone antioxidant treatment, applied alone or together in dystrophic primary muscle cells from mdx mice, the experimental model of DMD. Mdx primary muscle cells were submitted to LEDT and idebenone treatment and evaluated for cytotoxic effects and calcium and mitochondrial signaling pathways. LEDT and idebenone treatment showed no cytotoxic effects on the dystrophic muscle cells. Regarding the calcium pathways, after LEDT and idebenone treatment, a significant reduction in intracellular calcium content, calpain-1, calsequestrin, and sarcolipin levels, was observed. In addition, a significant reduction in oxidative stress level markers, such as H2O2, and 4-HNE levels, was observed. Regarding mitochondrial signaling pathways, a significant increase in oxidative capacity (by OCR and OXPHOS levels) was observed. In addition, the PGC-1α, SIRT-1, and PPARδ levels were significantly higher in the LEDT plus idebenone treated-dystrophic muscle cells. Together, the findings suggest that LEDT and idebenone treatment, alone or in conjunction, can modulate the calcium and mitochondrial signaling pathways, such as SLN, SERCA 1, and PGC-1α, contributing towards the improvement of the dystrophic phenotype in mdx muscle cells. In addition, data from the LEDT plus idebenone treatment showed slightly better results than those of each separate treatment in terms of SLN, OXPHOS, and SIRT-1.

Abstract: Summary
ARID1A is among the most commonly mutated tumor suppressor genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we conduct a CRISPR-Cas9 synthetic lethality screen using ARID1A-deficient HCC cells to identify approaches to treat HCC patients harboring ARID1A deficiency. This strategy reveals that the survival of these ARID1A-deficient HCC cells is highly dependent on genes related to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Mechanistically, ARID1A loss represses expression of key glycolysis-related gene PKM, shifting cellular glucose metabolism from aerobic glycolysis to dependence on the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. Cuproptosis is a recently defined form of copper-induced cell death reported to directly target the TCA cycle. Here, we find that ARID1A-deficient HCC cells and xenograft tumors are highly sensitive to copper treatment. Together, these results offer evidence of the synthetic lethality between ARID1A deficiency and mitochondrial respiration impairment, suggesting that copper treatment constitutes a promising therapeutic strategy for selectively targeting ARID1A-deficient HCC.

Abstract: Adriamycin (ADR) is an important chemotherapeutic drug, but it has serious side effects such as hepatotoxicity. This study aimed to evaluate whether N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has hepatoprotective effects against ADR-induced hepatotoxicity in rats. In addition, it was aimed to determine how Meteorin-Like (MtrnL), which has pleiotropic effects on immunology, inflammation, and metabolism, is affected by ADR and/or NAC applications in liver tissue. 28 rats were randomly assigned to one of four equal groups in the study: control (no treatment), NAC (150 mg/kg/day of NAC intraperitoneally (i.p), ADR (15 mg/kg only on the first day of the experiment), and ADR + NAC (ADR 15 mg/kg on the first day of the experiment + 150 mg/kg/day NAC i.p). After 15 days, liver enzyme levels in serum, oxidant/antioxidant parameters in liver tissue, histopathological changes, caspase 3 (Casp3) and heat shock protein 70 (HSP-70) immunoreactivities, and MtrnL levels were examined. Histopathological changes, liver enzyme levels, as well as HSP-70, and Casp3 immunoreactivities increased due to ADR application. Additionally, MtrnL levels in liver tissue were significantly increased as a result of ADR application. However, it was detected that the NAC application significantly regulated the ADR-induced changes. Furthermore, it was determined that NAC administration regulated the changes in ADR-induced oxidative stress parameters. We propose that NAC may exert a hepatoprotective effect by regulating ADR-induced altered oxidative stress parameters, MtrnL levels, Casp3, and HSP-70 immunoreactivities in the liver.

Abstract: Summary
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) triggers distinct changes in macrophages, resulting in the formation of lipid droplets that serve as a nutrient source. We discover that Mtb promotes lipid droplets by inhibiting DNA repair responses, resulting in the activation of the type-I IFN pathway and scavenger receptor-A1 (SR-A1)-mediated lipid droplet formation. Bacterial urease C (UreC, Rv1850) inhibits host DNA repair by interacting with RuvB-like protein 2 (RUVBL2) and impeding the formation of the RUVBL1-RUVBL2-RAD51 DNA repair complex. The suppression of this repair pathway increases the abundance of micronuclei that trigger the cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS)/stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway and subsequent interferon-β (IFN-β) production. UreC-mediated activation of the IFN-β pathway upregulates the expression of SR-A1 to form lipid droplets that facilitate Mtb replication. UreC inhibition via a urease inhibitor impaired Mtb growth within macrophages and in vivo. Thus, our findings identify mechanisms by which Mtb triggers a cascade of cellular events that establish a nutrient-rich replicative niche.

Abstract: Calcineurin plays a key role in cardiovascular pathogenesis by exerting pro-apoptotic effects in cardiomyocytes. However, whether calcineurin can regulate cardiomyocyte autophagy under conditions of chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) remains unclear. Here, we showed that CIH induced calcineurin activity in H9c2 cells, which attenuated adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling and inhibited autophagy. In H9c2 cells, autophagy levels, LC3 expression, and AMPK phosphorylation were significantly elevated under conditions of CIH within 3 days. However, after 5 days of CIH, these effects were reversed and calcineurin activity and apoptosis were significantly increased. The calcineurin inhibitor 17-Allyl-1,14-dihydroxy-12-[2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxycyclohexyl) -1-methylvinyl]-23,25-dimethoxy-13,19,21,27-tetramethyl-11,28-dioxa-4-azatricyclo- [22.3.1.04,9]octacos-18- ene-2,3,10,16-tetrone (FK506) restored AMPK activation and LC3 expression and attenuated CIH-induced H9c2 cell apoptosis. In contrast, calcineurin overexpression significantly attenuated the increase in LC3 expression and enhanced H9c2 cell apoptosis under conditions of CIH. Calcineurin inhibition failed to induce autophagy or alleviate apoptosis in H9c2 cells expressing a kinase-dead K45R AMPK mutant. Autophagy inhibition abrogated the protective effects of FK506-mediated calcineurin inhibition. These results indicate that calcineurin suppresses adaptive autophagy during CIH by downregulating AMPK activation. Our findings reveal the underlying mechanism of calcineurin and autophagy regulation during H9c2 cell survival under conditions of CIH and may provide a new strategy for preventing CIH-induced cardiomyocyte damage.

Abstract: Summary
Type 1 IFN expression is critical in the innate immune response, but aberrant expression is associated with autoimmunity and cancer. Here, we identify N-[4-(1H46 pyrazolo[3,4-b] pyrazin-6-yl)-phenyl]-sulfonamide (Sanofi-14h), a compound with preference for inhibition of the AGC family kinase SGK3, as an inhibitor of Ifnb1 gene expression in response to STING stimulation of macrophages. Sanofi-14h abrogated SGK activity and also impaired activation of the critical TBK1/IRF3 pathway downstream of STING activation, blocking interaction of STING with TBK1. Deletion of SGK1/3 in a macrophage cell line did not block TBK1/IRF3 activation but decreased expression of transcription factors, such as IRF7 and STAT1, required for the innate immune response. Other AGC kinase inhibitors blocked TBK1 and IRF3 activation suggesting common action on a critical regulatory node in the STING pathway. These studies reveal both SGK-dependent and SGK-independent mechanisms in the innate immune response and indicate an approach to block aberrant Ifnb1 expression.

Abstract: Summary
Pain often persists in patients with an inflammatory disease, even when inflammation has subsided. The molecular mechanisms leading to this failure in pain resolution and the transition to chronic pain are poorly understood. Mitochondrial dysfunction in sensory neurons links to chronic pain, but its role in resolution of inflammatory pain is unclear. Transient inflammation causes neuronal plasticity, called hyperalgesic priming, which impairs resolution of pain induced by a subsequent inflammatory stimulus. We identify that hyperalgesic priming in mice increases the expression of a mitochondrial protein (ATPSc-KMT) and causes mitochondrial and metabolic disturbances in sensory neurons. Inhibition of mitochondrial respiration, knockdown of ATPSCKMT expression, or supplementation of the affected metabolite is sufficient to restore resolution of inflammatory pain and prevents chronic pain development. Thus, inflammation-induced mitochondrial-dependent disturbances in sensory neurons predispose to a failure in resolution of inflammatory pain and development of chronic pain.

Abstract: Takenouchi-Kosaki Syndrome (TKS) is a congenital multi-organ disorder caused by the de novo missense mutation c.191A > G p. Tyr64Cys (Y64C) in the CDC42 gene. We previously elucidated the functional abnormalities and thrombopoietic effects of Y64C using HEK293 and MEG01 cells. In the present study, we used iPSCs derived from TKS patients to model the disease and successfully recapitulated macrothrombocytopenia, a prominent TKS phenotype. The megakaryopoietic differentiation potential of TKS-iPSCs and platelet production capacity were examined using an efficient platelet production method redesigned from existing protocols. The results obtained showed that TKS-iPSCs produced fewer hematopoietic progenitor cells, exhibited defective megakaryopoiesis, and released platelets with an abnormally low count and giant morphology. We herein report the first analysis of TKS-iPSC-derived megakaryocytes and platelets, and currently utilize this model to perform drug evaluations for TKS. Therefore, our simple yet effective differentiation method, which mimics the disease in a dish, is a feasible strategy for studying hematopoiesis and related diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Through antigenic evolution, viruses such as seasonal influenza evade recognition by neutralizing antibodies. This means that a person with antibodies well tuned to an initial infection will not be protected against the same virus years later and that vaccine-mediated protection will decay. To expand our understanding of which endemic human viruses evolve in this fashion, we assess adaptive evolution across the genome of 28 endemic viruses spanning a wide range of viral families and transmission modes. Surface proteins consistently show the highest rates of adaptation, and ten viruses in this panel are estimated to undergo antigenic evolution to selectively fix mutations that enable the escape of prior immunity. Thus, antibody evasion is not an uncommon evolutionary strategy among human viruses, and monitoring this evolution will inform future vaccine efforts. Additionally, by comparing overall amino acid substitution rates, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is accumulating protein-coding changes at substantially faster rates than endemic viruses.

Abstract: Background
Ovarian cancer has been a worldwide health burden for women and its progression is highly hypoxia-independent. Here, we investigated the exact mechanisms by which hypoxia contributes to the malignant progression of ovarian cancer.
Method
MTT, transwell, colony formation, and scratch wound healing assays were carried out for cellular functions. The underlying mechanism by which hypoxia functions was explored by RNA-seq, enrichment analysis, western blotting, qRT-PCR, flow cytometry, ChIP, luciferase reporter, and ELISA. Finally, animal experiments including the xenograft model and tumor metastasis model were constructed to validate the role of SLC2A12 in vivo.
Results
Hypoxia treatment promoted the cell proliferation, mobility, and colony growth abilities of the two ovarian cancer cell lines HO-8910 and A2780. RNA-seq and enrichment analysis showed that SLC2A12 was hyper-expressed under hypoxia condition and it may be related to glutathione and lipid metabolism. Besides, the expression of SLC2A12 was negatively correlated with overall survival. Hypoxia suppressed ferroptosis by SLC2A12 because silencing SLC2A12 declined the cell viability of HO-8910 and A2780 cells under hypoxia conditions, while the ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) breached that result and upregulated the expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). Moreover, hypoxia increased the expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1 A (HIF-1A), and the accumulated HIF-1A binds to hypoxia inducible factor 1 B (HIF1B) to form HIF-1 complex, then promoted the binding of hypoxic response elements (HRE) to SLC2A12 promoter by HIF-1/HRE signal. Subsequently, SLC2A12 regulated glutathione metabolism and in turn inhibited ferroptosis. The animal experiments indicated that silencing SLC2A12 could significantly inhibit tumor growth and metastasis in vivo.
Conclusion
Hypoxia promoted ovarian cancer progression by upregulating SLC2A12 and then regulating glutathione metabolism to inhibit ferroptosis.

Abstract: Being overweight is already considered a metabolic risk factor, which can be overcome by increasing cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). Acute exercise is known to induce changes in plasma hormones and heat shock proteins release. However, there is a lack of studies investigating the impact of body composition and CRF on these variables following acute aerobic exercise. To assess the influence of body composition and cardiorespiratory fitness on plasma heat shock protein 72 kDa (HSP72), norepinephrine (NE), insulin, and glucose responses to an acute aerobic exercise bout in the fed state. Twenty-four healthy male adults were recruited and allocated into three groups: overweight sedentary (n = 8), normal weight sedentary (n = 8), and normal weight active (n = 8). The volunteers performed an acute moderate exercise session on a treadmill at 70% of VO2 peak. Blood samples were drawn at baseline, immediately post-exercise, and at 1-h post-exercise. The exercise session did not induce changes in HSP72 nor NE but changes in glucose and insulin were affected by body mass index. Also, subjects with elevated CRF maintain reduced NE through exercise. At baseline, the overweight sedentary group showed elevated NE, insulin, and glucose; these last two impacting the HOMA-IR index. Thirty minutes of aerobic exercise at 70% VO2 peak, in the fed state, did not change the levels of plasma NE and HSP72. Elevated body composition seems to impact metabolic profile and increase sympathetic activity. Conversely, subjects with increased cardiorespiratory fitness seem to have attenuated sympathetic activity.

Abstract: Summary
Stop codon suppression using dedicated tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) pairs allows for genetically encoded, site-specific incorporation of non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) as chemical handles for protein labeling and modification. Here, we demonstrate that piggyBac-mediated genomic integration of archaeal pyrrolysine tRNA (tRNAPyl)/pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS) or bacterial tRNA/aaRS pairs, using a modular plasmid design with multi-copy tRNA arrays, allows for homogeneous and efficient genetically encoded ncAA incorporation in diverse mammalian cell lines. We assess opportunities and limitations of using ncAAs for fluorescent labeling applications in stable cell lines. We explore suppression of ochre and opal stop codons and finally incorporate two distinct ncAAs with mutually orthogonal click chemistries for site-specific, dual-fluorophore labeling of a cell surface receptor on live mammalian cells.

Abstract: Summary
Mowat-Wilson syndrome is caused by mutations in ZEB2, with patients exhibiting characteristics indicative of neural crest (NC) defects. We examined the contribution of ZEB2 to human NC formation using a model based on human embryonic stem cells. We found ZEB2 to be one of the earliest factors expressed in prospective human NC, and knockdown revealed a role for ZEB2 in establishing the NC state while repressing pre-placodal and non-neural ectoderm genes. Examination of ZEB2 N-terminal mutant NC cells demonstrates its requirement for the repression of enhancers in the NC gene network and proper NC cell terminal differentiation into osteoblasts and peripheral neurons and neuroglia. This ZEB2 mutation causes early misexpression of BMP signaling ligands, which can be rescued by the attenuation of BMP. Our findings suggest that ZEB2 regulates early human NC specification by modulating proper BMP signaling and further elaborate the molecular defects underlying Mowat-Wilson syndrome.

Abstract: Summary
The choroid plexus (CP) plays a key role in remotely controlling brain function in health, aging, and disease. Here, we report that CP epithelial cells express the brain-specific cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46A1) and that its levels are decreased under different mouse and human brain conditions, including amyloidosis, aging, and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using primary mouse CP cell cultures, we demonstrate that the enzymatic product of CYP46A1, 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, downregulates inflammatory transcriptomic signatures within the CP, found here to be elevated across multiple neurological conditions. In vitro, the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) downregulates CYP46A1 expression, while overexpression of CYP46A1 or its pharmacological activation in mouse CP organ cultures increases resilience to TNF-α. In vivo, overexpression of CYP46A1 in the CP in transgenic mice with amyloidosis is associated with better cognitive performance and decreased brain inflammation. Our findings suggest that CYP46A1 expression in the CP impacts the role of this niche as a guardian of brain immune homeostasis.

Abstract: Epilepsy is a group of neurological diseases which requires significant economic costs for the treatment and care of patients. The central point of epileptogenesis stems from the failure of synaptic signal transmission mechanisms, leading to excessive synchronous excitation of neurons and characteristic epileptic electroencephalogram activity, in typical cases being manifested as seizures and loss of consciousness. The causes of epilepsy are extremely diverse, which is one of the reasons for the complexity of selecting a treatment regimen for each individual case and the high frequency of pharmacoresistant cases. Therefore, the search for new drugs and methods of epilepsy treatment requires an advanced study of the molecular mechanisms of epileptogenesis. In this regard, the investigation of molecular chaperones as potential mediators of epileptogenesis seems promising because the chaperones are involved in the processing and regulation of the activity of many key proteins directly responsible for the generation of abnormal neuronal excitation in epilepsy. In this review, we try to systematize current data on the role of molecular chaperones in epileptogenesis and discuss the prospects for the use of chemical modulators of various chaperone groups’ activity as promising antiepileptic drugs.

Abstract: The phenotype of individuals carrying the apolipoprotein A-IMilano (apoA-IM), the mutant form of human apoA-I (apoA-I), is characterized by very low concentrations of HDL and apoA-I, and hypertriglyceridemia. Paradoxically, these subjects are not found to be at increased risk of premature cardiovascular disease compared to controls. Besides, various in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that apoA-IM possesses greater anti-atherosclerotic activity compared to apoA-I. The molecular mechanisms explaining the apoA-IM carrier's phenotype and the apoA-IM higher efficacy are still not fully elucidated. To investigate such mechanisms, we crossed previously generated apoA-I (A-I k-in) or apoA-IM knock-in mice (A-IM k-in) with transgenic mice expressing human apoA-II but lacking murine apoA-I (hA-II) to generate hA-II/A-I k-in, and hA-II/A-IM k-in, respectively. These genetically modified mice completely reproduced the apoA-IM carrier's phenotype, including hypoalphalipoproteinemia and hypertriglyceridemia. Furthermore, by using the microarray methodology, we investigated the intrinsic differences in hepatic gene expression among these k-in mouse lines. The expression of 871, 1,018, 1129 and 764 genes was significantly altered between 1) hA-II/A-I and hA-II/A-IM k-in; 2) A-IM and hA-II/A-IM k-in; 3) A-I and A-IM; 4) A-I and hA-II/A-I k-in liver samples, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis highlighted that the hepatic expression of two genes, Elovl6 and Gatm, related to fatty acid/lipid and energy metabolism, respectively, is influenced by the presence of the apoA-IM natural variant and/or apoA-II.

Abstract: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) represents a prevalent form of cancer, with low early diagnosis rates and high mortality rates, posing a global health challenge. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) assume a crucial role within the tumor immune microenvironment (TME) of LUAD. Here, a collection of 97 HSP-related genes (HSPGs) was assembled based on prior literature reports, of which 36 HSPGs were differentially expressed in LUAD. In The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort, we constructed a prognostic model for risk stratification and prognosis prediction by integrating 13 HSPGs. In addition, the prognostic significance and predictive efficacy of the HSP-related riskscore were examined and validated in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) cohort. To facilitate the clinical use of this riskscore, we also established a nomogram scale by verifying its effectiveness through different methods. In light of these outcomes, we concluded a significant correlation between HSPs and TME in LUAD, and the riskscore can be a reliable prognostic indicator. Furthermore, this study evaluated the differences in immunophenoscore, tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion score, and sensitivity to several common chemotherapy drugs among LUAD individuals in different risk groups, which may aid in clinical decision-making for immune therapy and chemotherapy in LUAD individuals.

Abstract: Summary
Despite a wide presence of type III clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, CRISPR-associated (CRISPR-Cas) in archaea and bacteria, very few anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins inhibiting type III immunity have been identified, and even less is known about their inhibition mechanism. Here, we present the discovery of a type III CRISPR-Cas inhibitor, AcrIIIB2, encoded by Sulfolobus virus S. islandicus rod-shaped virus 3 (SIRV3). AcrIIIB2 inhibits type III-B CRISPR-Cas immune response to protospacers encoded in middle/late-expressed viral genes. Investigation of the interactions between S. islandicus type III-B CRISPR-Cas Cmr-α-related proteins and AcrIIIB2 reveals that the Acr does not bind to Csx1 but rather interacts with the Cmr-α effector complex. Furthermore, in vitro assays demonstrate that AcrIIIB2 can block the dissociation of cleaved target RNA from the Cmr-α complex, thereby inhibiting the Cmr-α turnover, thus preventing host cellular dormancy and further viral genome degradation by the type III-B CRISPR-Cas immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most prevalent cancer of the eye in adults, driven by activating mutation of GNAQ/GNA11; however, there are limited therapies against UM and metastatic UM (mUM). Here, we perform a high-throughput chemogenetic drug screen in GNAQ-mutant UM contrasted with BRAF-mutant cutaneous melanoma, defining the druggable landscape of these distinct melanoma subtypes. Across all compounds, darovasertib demonstrates the highest preferential activity against UM. Our investigation reveals that darovasertib potently inhibits PKC as well as PKN/PRK, an AGC kinase family that is part of the “dark kinome.” We find that downstream of the Gαq-RhoA signaling axis, PKN converges with ROCK to control FAK, a mediator of non-canonical Gαq-driven signaling. Strikingly, darovasertib synergizes with FAK inhibitors to halt UM growth and promote cytotoxic cell death in vitro and in preclinical metastatic mouse models, thus exposing a signaling vulnerability that can be exploited as a multimodal precision therapy against mUM.

Abstract: Summary
In people with HIV (PWH), the post-antiretroviral therapy (ART) window is critical for immune restoration and HIV reservoir stabilization. We employ deep immune profiling and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing and examine proliferation to assess how ART impacts T cell homeostasis. In PWH on long-term ART, lymphocyte frequencies and phenotypes are mostly stable. By contrast, broad phenotypic changes in natural killer (NK) cells, γδ T cells, B cells, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are observed in the post-ART window. Whereas CD8+ T cells mostly restore, memory CD4+ T subsets and cytolytic NK cells show incomplete restoration 1.4 years post ART. Surprisingly, the hierarchies and frequencies of dominant CD4 TCR clonotypes (0.1%–11% of all CD4+ T cells) remain stable post ART, suggesting that clonal homeostasis can be independent of homeostatic processes regulating CD4+ T cell absolute number, phenotypes, and function. The slow restoration of host immunity post ART also has implications for the design of ART interruption studies.

Abstract: Summary
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a global public health concern, as it is known to cause multiple diseases while also being etiologically associated with a wide range of epithelial and lymphoid malignancies. Currently, there is no available prophylactic vaccine against EBV. gB is the EBV fusion protein that mediates viral membrane fusion and participates in host recognition, making it critical for EBV infection in both B cells and epithelial cells. Here, we present a gB nanoparticle, gB-I53-50 NP, that displays multiple copies of gB. Compared with the gB trimer, gB-I53-50 NP shows improved structural integrity and stability, as well as enhanced immunogenicity in mice and non-human primate (NHP) preclinical models. Immunization and passive transfer demonstrate a robust and durable protective antibody response that protects humanized mice against lethal EBV challenge. This vaccine candidate demonstrates significant potential in preventing EBV infection, providing a possible platform for developing prophylactic vaccines for EBV.

Abstract: Necroptosis is a new type of programmed cell death discovered in recent years, playing an important role in various diseases. Since it was conceptualized in 2005, research on necroptosis has developed rapidly. However, few bibliometric analyses have provided a comprehensive overview of the field. This study aimed to employ a bibliometric analysis to assess necroptosis research’s current status and hotspot, highlight landmark findings, and orientate future research. A total of 3993 publications from the WoSCC were collected for this study. Multiple tools were used for bibliometric analysis and data visualization, including an online website, VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and HistCite. Publications related to necroptosis have increased significantly annually, especially in the last 5 years. Globally, the USA and Harvard University are the most outstanding countries and institutions in this field, respectively. The academic groups managed by Peter Vandenabeele and Junying Yuan both have permanent and intensive research on necroptosis. Cell Death and Differentiation is the most vital journal in this field. The molecular mechanisms of necroptosis and its role in disease are the focus of current research, while the crosstalk between programmed cell death is an emerging direction in the field. The “reactive oxygen species”, “innate immunity”, and “programmed cell death” may be potential research hotspots. Our results present a comprehensive knowledge map and explore research trends. Researchers and funding agencies on necroptosis can obtain helpful references from our study.

Abstract: Many cancer cells exhibit enhanced glycolysis, which is seen as one of the hallmark metabolic alterations, known as Warburg effect. Substantial evidence shows that upregulated glycolytic enzymes are often linked to malignant growth. Using glycolytic inhibitors for anticancer treatment has become appealing in recent years for therapeutic intervention in cancers with highly glycolytic characteristic, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this work, we studied the anticancer effects and the underlying mechanisms of combination of benzerazide hydrocholoride (Benz), a hexokinase 2 (HK2) inhibitor and 64, a pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) inhibitor, in several NSCLC cell lines. We found that combination of Benz and 64 exhibited strong synergistic anticancer effects in NCI–H1975, HCC827, NCI–H1299 and SK-LU-1 cell lines. With this combination treatment, we observed changes of certain mechanistic determinants associated with metabolic stress caused by glycolysis restriction, such as mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization, overproduction of reactive oxygen species [1], activation of AMPK and down-regulation of mTOR, which contributed to enhanced apoptosis. Moreover, Benz and 64 together significantly suppressed the tumor growth in HCC827 cell mouse xenograft model. Taken together, our study may suggest that combined inhibition of HK2 and PDK1 using Benz and 64 could be a viable anticancer strategy for NSCLC.

Abstract: Summary
Clinical viscoelastic hemostatic assays, which have been used for decades, rely on measuring biomechanical responses to physical stimuli but face challenges related to high device and test cost, limited portability, and limited scalability.. Here, we report a differential pattern using self-induced adaptive-bubble behavioral perception to refresh it. The adaptive behaviors of bubble deformation during coagulation precisely describe the transformation of viscoelastic hemostatic properties, being free of the precise and complex physical devices. And the integrated bubble array chip allows microassays and enables multi-bubble tests with good reproducibility. Recognition of the developed bubble behaviors empowers automated and user-friendly diagnosis. In a prospective clinical study (clinical model development [n = 273]; clinical assay [n = 44]), we show that the diagnostic accuracies were 99.1% for key viscoelastic hemostatic assay indicators (reaction time [R], kinetics time [K], alpha angle [Angle], maximum amplitude [MA], lysis at 30 min [LY30]; n = 220) and 100% (n = 44) for hypercoagulation, healthy, and hypocoagulation diagnoses. This should provide fresh insight into existing paradigms and help more clinical needs.

Abstract: Summary
The commensal microflora provides a repertoire of antigens that illicit mucosal antibodies. In some cases, these antibodies can cross-react with host proteins, inducing autoimmunity, or with other microbial antigens. We demonstrate that the oral microbiota can induce salivary anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike IgG antibodies via molecular mimicry. Anti-Spike IgG antibodies in the saliva correlated with enhanced abundance of Streptococcus salivarius 1 month after anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Several human commensal bacteria, including S. salivarius, were recognized by SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and induced cross-reactive anti-Spike antibodies in mice, facilitating SARS-CoV-2 clearance. A specific S. salivarius protein, RSSL-01370, contains regions with homology to the Spike receptor-binding domain, and immunization of mice with RSSL-01370 elicited anti-Spike IgG antibodies in the serum. Additionally, oral S. salivarius supplementation enhanced salivary anti-Spike antibodies in vaccinated individuals. Altogether, these data show that distinct species of the human microbiota can express molecular mimics of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, potentially enhancing protective immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Plants deploy intracellular receptors to counteract pathogen effectors that suppress cell-surface-receptor-mediated immunity. To what extent pathogens manipulate intracellular receptor-mediated immunity, and how plants tackle such manipulation, remains unknown. Arabidopsis thaliana encodes three similar ADR1 class helper nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat receptors (ADR1, ADR1-L1, and ADR1-L2), which are crucial in plant immunity initiated by intracellular receptors. Here, we report that Pseudomonas syringae effector AvrPtoB suppresses ADR1-L1- and ADR1-L2-mediated cell death. ADR1, however, evades such suppression by diversifying into two ubiquitination sites targeted by AvrPtoB. The intracellular sensor SNC1 interacts with and guards the CCR domains of ADR1-L1/L2. Removal of ADR1-L1/L2 or delivery of AvrPtoB activates SNC1, which then signals through ADR1 to trigger immunity. Our work elucidates the long-sought-after function of SNC1 in defense, and also how plants can use dual strategies, sequence diversification, and a multi-layered guard-guardee system, to counteract pathogen’s attack on core immunity functions.

Abstract: Summary
Molecular representation learning plays an important role in molecular property prediction. Existing molecular property prediction models rely on the de facto standard of covalent-bond-based molecular graphs for representing molecular topology at the atomic level and totally ignore the non-covalent interactions within the molecule. In this study, we propose a molecular geometric deep learning model to predict the properties of molecules that aims to comprehensively consider the information of covalent and non-covalent interactions of molecules. The essential idea is to incorporate a more general molecular representation into geometric deep learning (GDL) models. We systematically test molecular GDL (Mol-GDL) on fourteen commonly used benchmark datasets. The results show that Mol-GDL can achieve a better performance than state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Extensive tests have demonstrated the important role of non-covalent interactions in molecular property prediction and the effectiveness of Mol-GDL models.

Abstract: Summary
Histone 3 lysine 79 methylation (H3K79me) is enriched on gene bodies proportional to gene expression levels and serves as a strong barrier for the reprogramming of somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). DOT1L is the sole histone methyltransferase that deposits all three orders—mono (me1), di (me2), and tri (me3) methylation—at H3K79. Here, we leverage genetic and chemical approaches to parse the specific functions of orders of H3K79me in maintaining cell identity. DOT1L interacts with AF10 (Mllt10), which recognizes unmodified H3K27 and boosts H3K79me2/3 methylation. AF10 deletion evicts H3K79me2/3 and reorganizes H3K79me1 to the transcription start site to facilitate iPSC formation in the absence of steady-state transcriptional changes. Instead, AF10 loss redistributes RNA polymerase II to a uniquely pluripotent pattern at highly expressed, rapidly transcribed housekeeping genes. Taken together, we reveal a specific mechanism for H3K79me2/3 located at the gene body in reinforcing cell identity.

Abstract: Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) are a group of disorders that include intellectual disability. Although several genes have been implicated in NDD, the molecular mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis remain unclear. Therefore, it is important to develop novel models to analyze the functions of NDD-causing genes in vivo. Recently, rare pathogenic variants of the B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A/B (BCL11A/B) gene have been identified in several patients with NDD. Drosophila carries the Chronophage (Cph) gene, which has been predicted to be a homolog of BCL11A/B based on the conservation of the amino acid sequence. In the present study, we investigated whether nervous system-specific knockdown of Cph mimics NDD phenotypes in Drosophila. Nervous system-specific knockdown of Cph induced learning and locomotor defects in larvae and epilepsy-like behaviors in adults. The number of synaptic branches was also elevated in the larval neuromuscular junction without a corresponding increase in the number of boutons. Furthermore, the expression levels of putative target genes that are Drosophila homologs of the mammalian BCL11 target genes were decreased in Cph knockdown flies. These results suggest that Cph knockdown flies are a promising model for investigating the pathology of NDD-induced BCL11A/B dysfunction.

Abstract: Summary
Defects in homologous recombination DNA repair (HRD) both predispose to cancer development and produce therapeutic vulnerabilities, making it critical to define the spectrum of genetic events that cause HRD. However, we found that mutations in BRCA1/2 and other canonical HR genes only identified 10%–20% of tumors that display genomic evidence of HRD. Using a networks-based approach, we discovered that over half of putative genes causing HRD originated outside of canonical DNA damage response genes, with a particular enrichment for RNA-binding protein (RBP)-encoding genes. These putative drivers of HRD were experimentally validated, cross-validated in an independent cohort, and enriched in cancer-associated genome-wide association study loci. Mechanistic studies indicate that some RBPs are recruited to sites of DNA damage to facilitate repair, whereas others control the expression of canonical HR genes. Overall, this study greatly expands the repertoire of known drivers of HRD, with implications for basic biology, genetic screening, and therapy stratification.

Abstract: Summary
The envelope (E) glycoprotein is the primary target of type-specific (TS) neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) after infection with any of the four distinct dengue virus serotypes (DENV1–4). nAbs can be elicited to distinct structural E domains (EDs) I, II, or III. However, the relative contribution of these domain-specific antibodies is unclear. To identify the primary DENV3 nAb targets in sera after natural infection or vaccination, chimeric DENV1 recombinant encoding DENV3 EDI, EDII, or EDIII were generated. DENV3 EDII is the principal target of TS polyclonal nAb responses and encodes two or more neutralizing epitopes. In contrast, some were individuals vaccinated with a DENV3 monovalent vaccine-elicited serum TS nAbs targeting each ED in a subject-dependent fashion, with an emphasis on EDI and EDIII. Vaccine responses were also sensitive to DENV3 genotypic variation. This DENV1/3 panel allows the measurement of serum ED TS nAbs, revealing differences in TS nAb immunity after natural infection or vaccination.

Abstract: Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) play a crucial role under abiotic stress and are present in all organisms, from eukaryotes to prokaryotes. However, studies on the sHSP gene family in red alga are limited. In this study, we aimed to identify and characterize NysHSP genes from the genome of N. yezoensis, a marine red alga adapted to the stressful intertidal zone. We identified seven NysHSP genes distributed on all three chromosomes. Expression analysis revealed that all NysHSP genes responded to H2O2 and heat stress in the gametophytic thalli, but these genes responded only to heat stress in the sporophytic conchocelis. NysHSP20.3, which has an acidic isoelectric point (pI) and short N-terminal region, was localized as granules in the cytosol. Fluorescence imaging of the NysHSP25.8-GFP and NysHSP28.4-GFP fusion proteins revealed that these proteins were located in the chloroplast. Based on their characteristics and cellular localization, the NysHSPs are divided into two subfamilies. Subfamily I includes four sHSP genes that strongly respond to heat stress and encode a protein localized in the cytosol. The NysHSP gene of subfamily II encodes a polypeptide with a long N-terminal region located in the chloroplast. This study provides insights into the evolution and function of the sHSP gene family of the marine red alga N. yezoensis and how it adapts to the stressful intertidal zone.

Abstract: Summary
Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) affects the small vessels in the brain and is a leading cause of stroke and dementia. Emerging evidence supports a role of the extracellular matrix (ECM), at the interface between blood and brain, in the progression of SVD pathology, but this remains poorly characterized. To address ECM role in SVD, we developed a co-culture model of mural and endothelial cells using human induced pluripotent stem cells from patients with COL4A1/A2 SVD-related mutations. This model revealed that these mutations induce apoptosis, migration defects, ECM remodeling, and transcriptome changes in mural cells. Importantly, these mural cell defects exert a detrimental effect on endothelial cell tight junctions through paracrine actions. COL4A1/A2 models also express high levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and inhibiting MMP activity partially rescues the ECM abnormalities and mural cell phenotypic changes. These data provide a basis for targeting MMP as a therapeutic opportunity in SVD.

Abstract: Summary
Drug repositioning seeks to leverage existing clinical knowledge to identify alternative clinical settings for approved drugs. However, repositioning efforts fail to demonstrate improved success rates in late-stage clinical trials. Focusing on 11 approved kinase inhibitors that have been evaluated in 139 repositioning hypotheses, we use data mining to characterize the state of clinical repurposing. Then, using a simple experimental correction with human serum proteins in in vitro pharmacodynamic assays, we develop a measurement of a drug’s effective exposure. We show that this metric is remarkably predictive of clinical activity for a panel of five kinase inhibitors across 23 drug variant targets in leukemia. We then validate our model’s performance in six other kinase inhibitors for two types of solid tumors: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). Our approach presents a straightforward strategy to use existing clinical information and experimental systems to decrease the clinical failure rate in drug repurposing studies.

Cardiac ischemic preconditioning promotes cMyBP-C phosphorylation by inhibiting the calpain-mediated proteolysis,

Abstract: Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) has been considered as the most important mean to protect against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) induced heart injury. It has been reported that cardiac myosin binding protein-C (cMyBP-C) phosphorylation plays an essential role in cardiac protection against I/R-induced heart injury. However, it is still obscured whether IPC-mediated cardiac protection is causally related to cMyBP-C phosphorylation and proteolysis and, if so, what the underlying mechanism is. In this study, IPC was found to increase the phosphorylation level of cMyBP-C, companying with the decreased calpain activity in the collected perfusate samples. Mechanistically, we confirmed that IPC promoted cMyBP-C phosphorylation and inhibited calpain-mediated cMyBP-C proteolysis. Moreover, inhibition of calpain activity significantly increased the phosphorylated cMyBP-C level by using calpain inhibitor (MG-101), and subsequently promoted stabilization and secretion of cMyBP-C. Functionally, adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated overexpression of mutated phosphorylation motif site of cMyBP-C exhibited impaired IPC-mediated cardiac protection via proteolysis of the full-length cMyBP-C protein. We concluded that IPC promoted cMyBP-C phosphorylation via inhibition of calpain-mediated proteolysis and participated in IPC-mediated protection against I/R induced heart injury.

Abstract: Summary
Evidence on whether prior antibiotic (pATB) administration modulates outcomes of programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibitors in advanced gastric cancer (AGC) is scarce. In this study, we find that pATB administration is consistently associated with poor progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in multiple cohorts consisting of patients with AGC treated with PD-1 inhibitors. In contrast, pATB does not affect outcomes among patients treated with irinotecan. Multivariable analysis of the overall patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors confirms that pATB administration independently predicts worse PFS and OS. Administration of pATBs is associated with diminished gut microbiome diversity, reduced abundance of Lactobacillus gasseri, and disproportional enrichment of circulating exhaustive CD8+ T cells, all of which are associated with worse outcomes. Considering the inferior treatment response and poor survival outcomes by pATB administration followed by PD-1 blockade, ATBs should be prescribed with caution in patients with AGC who are planning to receive PD-1 inhibitors.

Abstract: Mastitis is a disease involved in inflammation of breast which affects human and animals. Wogonin is one bioactive compound from many Chinese herbal medicines, which have multiple properties, including anti-inflammatory activity. However, the roles of wogonin in mastitis progression are largely undefined. Mastitis models were established using LPS-treated mice and mammary epithelial cells (MECs). Infiltration of inflammatory cells was analyzed by hematoxylin-eosin staining and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. Inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α and IL-1β) levels were detected via ELISA. The phosphorylation and total of Akt and NF-κB levels and content of Nrf2 and HO-1 were measured via western blot. Cell viability was examined by CCK-8 assay. Oxidative stress was assessed by ROS generation and levels of MDA, GSH, and SOD. Wogonin attenuated LPS-induced infiltration of inflammatory cells, increase of MPO activity and levels of TNF-α and IL-1β, and activation of the Akt/NF-κB pathway in murine mammary gland tissues, and promoted activation of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling. Wogonin did not affect MEC viability, but mitigated LPS-induced inflammation in MECs by reducing TNF-α and IL-1β levels. Wogonin relieved LPS-induced oxidative stress in MECs through decreasing ROS generation and MDA level and increasing GSH and SOD levels. Wogonin repressed LPS-induced activation of the Akt/NF-κB pathway in MECs and increased Nrf2/HO-1 signaling activation. Activated Akt/NF-κB signaling or Nrf2/HO-1 signaling inactivation reversed the suppressive effects of wogonin on LPS-induced inflammation and oxidative stress in MECs.

Abstract: Summary
We report a novel translation-regulatory function of G9a, a histone methyltransferase and well-understood transcriptional repressor, in promoting hyperinflammation and lymphopenia; two hallmarks of endotoxin tolerance (ET)-associated chronic inflammatory complications. Using multiple approaches, we demonstrate that G9a interacts with multiple translation regulators during ET, particularly the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methyltransferase METTL3, to co-upregulate expression of certain m6A-modified mRNAs that encode immune-checkpoint and anti-inflammatory proteins. Mechanistically, G9a promotes m6A methyltransferase activity of METTL3 at translational/post-translational level by regulating its expression, its methylation, and its cytosolic localization during ET. Additionally, from a broader view extended from the G9a-METTL3-m6A translation regulatory axis, our translatome proteomics approach identified numerous “G9a-translated” proteins that unite the networks associated with inflammation dysregulation, T cell dysfunction, and systemic cytokine response. In sum, we identified a previously unrecognized function of G9a in protein-specific translation that can be leveraged to treat ET-related chronic inflammatory diseases.

Abstract: Molecular chaperones belonging to the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) family are implicated in inflammatory processes and described as potential novel therapeutic targets in autoimmune/inflammatory skin diseases. While the pathological role of circulating Hsp90 has been recently proposed in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD), a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by intense itching and recurrent skin lesions, studies aimed at investigating the role of Hsp90 as a potential target of AD therapy have not yet been conducted. Here, the effects of the Hsp90 blocker STA-9090 (Ganetespib) applied systemically or topically were determined in an experimental mouse model of dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB)-induced AD. Intraperitoneal administration of STA-9090 ameliorated clinical disease severity, histological epidermal thickness, and dermal leukocyte infiltration in AD mice which was associated with reducing the scratching behavior in DNCB-treated animals. Additionally, topically applied STA-9090 led to lowered disease activity in AD mice, reduced serum levels of IgE, and up-regulated filaggrin expression in lesional skin samples. Our observations suggest that Hsp90 may be a promising therapeutic target in atopic dermatitis and potentially other inflammatory or autoimmune dermatoses.

Abstract: Summary
The integrated stress response (ISR) comprises the eIF2α kinases PERK, GCN2, HRI, and PKR, which induce translational and transcriptional signaling in response to diverse insults. Deficiencies in PERK signaling lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and contribute to the pathogenesis of numerous diseases. We define the potential for pharmacologic activation of compensatory eIF2α kinases to rescue ISR signaling and promote mitochondrial adaptation in PERK-deficient cells. We show that the HRI activator BtdCPU and GCN2 activator halofuginone promote ISR signaling and rescue ER stress sensitivity in PERK-deficient cells. However, BtdCPU induces mitochondrial depolarization, leading to mitochondrial fragmentation and activation of the OMA1-DELE1-HRI signaling axis. In contrast, halofuginone promotes mitochondrial elongation and adaptive mitochondrial respiration, mimicking regulation induced by PERK. This shows halofuginone can compensate for deficiencies in PERK signaling and promote adaptive mitochondrial remodeling, highlighting the potential for pharmacologic ISR activation to mitigate mitochondrial dysfunction and motivating the pursuit of highly selective ISR activators.

Abstract: Summary
Intracellular pathogens and other endosymbionts reprogram host cell transcription to suppress immune responses and recalibrate biosynthetic pathways. This reprogramming is critical in determining the outcome of infection or colonization. We combine pooled CRISPR knockout screening with dual host-microbe single-cell RNA sequencing, a method we term dual perturb-seq, to identify the molecular mediators of these transcriptional interactions. Applying dual perturb-seq to the intracellular pathogen Toxoplasma gondii, we are able to identify previously uncharacterized effector proteins and directly infer their function from the transcriptomic data. We show that TgGRA59 contributes to the export of other effector proteins from the parasite into the host cell and identify an effector, TgSOS1, that is necessary for sustained host STAT6 signaling and thereby contributes to parasite immune evasion and persistence. Together, this work demonstrates a tool that can be broadly adapted to interrogate host-microbe transcriptional interactions and reveal mechanisms of infection and immune evasion.

Abstract: HSP90 is a ubiquitously expressed chaperone protein that regulates the maturation of numerous substrate proteins called ‘clients’. The glycoprotein fibronectin (FN) is an important protein of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and a client protein of HSP90. FN and HSP90 interact directly, and the FN ECM is regulated by exogenous HSP90 or HSP90 inhibitors. Here, we extend the analysis of the HSP90 – FN interaction. The importance of the N-terminal 70-kDa fragment of fibronectin (FN70) and FN type I repeat was demonstrated by competition for FN binding between HSP90 and the functional upstream domain (FUD) of the Streptococcus pyogenes F1 adhesin protein. Furthermore, His-HSP90α mutations F352A and Y528A (alone and in combination) reduced the association with full-length FN (FN-FL) and FN70 in vitro. Unlike wild type His-HSP90α, these HSP90 mutants did not enhance FN matrix assembly in the Hs578T cell line model when added exogenously. Interestingly, the HSP90 E353A mutation, which did not significantly reduce the HSP90 – FN interaction in vitro, dramatically blocked FN matrix assembly in Hs578T cell-derived matrices. Taken together, these data extend our understanding of the role of HSP90 in FN fibrillogenesis and suggest that promotion of FN ECM assembly by HSP90 is not solely regulated by the affinity of the direct interaction between HSP90 and FN.
