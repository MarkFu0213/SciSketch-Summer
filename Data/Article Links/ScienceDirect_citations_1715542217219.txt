Abstract: Reduced-graphene oxide (RGO) dispersed nanofluids were prepared by irradiating a graphene oxide (GO)/water one under UV light for different times. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses verified the reduction from GO to RGO under the UV irradiation and indicated that the reduction degree increased with the time. Zeta potential measurements suggested that the RGO/water nanofluids obtained under the irradiation time of 340s or less can keep stable at elevated temperatures. The transmittance of the RGO/water nanofluids was quite less than that of the GO/water one, indicating that the change from GO to RGO greatly enhanced optical absorption. The RGO/water nanofluid obtained under the irradiation of 340s possessed higher thermal conductivity and less specific heat than the GO/water one. The good stability along with the high optical absorption and thermal conductivity make the RGO/water nanofluid exhibited superior photo-thermal conversion efficiency to the GO/water and graphene (GE)/water ones at the same loading, which reached 96.93% at 30°C and 52% at 75°C. It is revealed that the RGO/water nanofluid prepared from the GO/water one shows greater promise for use as the working fluid in low-temperature direct absorption solar collectors.

Abstract: We present formation of Cu2FeSnS4 (CFTS) thin-films through successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. We have considered a range of chalcogenides as n-type compound semiconductors, also formed through SILAR method, in conjunction with the p-nature of CFTS to fabricate and characterize pn-junction solar cells. The film-deposition method, which is a low temperature and non-vacuum one and is also suitable for obtaining films of large-areas, has maintained a balance between fabrication cost and phase purity. From scanning tunneling spectroscopy and correspondingly density of states of the semiconductors, we have estimated their band-edges to draw energy-level diagram of the devices. This has led in establishing a correlation between the band-alignment in the pn-junctions and energy conversion efficiency of solar cells based on the junctions. The correlation has been further supported by diode parameters of the junctions. An energy conversion efficiency of 2.9% with promising reproducibility could be achieved in CFTS|Bi2S3 junctions formed through this room-temperature film deposition route.

Abstract: We demonstrate a simple approach to fabricate Cu2ZnSn(S, Se)4 (CZTSSe) absorber with increased-sulfur content surface. It is well known that the problem of interface recombination in CZTSSe solar cells is the issue for further improving efficiency. The beneficial effects of surface sulfurization were reported in Cu(In, Ga)(S, Se)2 solar cells. However, very limited works have been reported on the effects of surface sulfurization on CZTSSe solar cells, which is a critical factor to improve the surface and achieve higher efficiency. In this work, we fabricate the CZTSSe absorber by selenizing the sulfur-containing stacked precursors. The sulfur-modified surface is achieved by introducing H2S gas during cooling stage of the selenization process. The effects of surface sulfurization on composition, structure, morphology, and electric properties of CZTSSe are thoroughly investigated. The open circuit voltage can be increased significantly from 312mV (without H2S) to 400mV (with H2S) due to the increment of front surface bandgap and reduction of interface recombination. Surface localized electric properties are improved, and interface defect density is decreased due to surface passivation by using H2S gas. The efficiency of CZTSSe solar cell substantially increases from 5.01% (without H2S) to 7.38% (with H2S). The proposed approach can be easily applied to various CZTSSe processes to passivate the surface and form larger surface bandgap, leading to lower interface recombination, which paves a new avenue to further improve the CZTSSe efficiency.

Abstract: Nonplanar structured photovoltaic absorber design has potential to achieve high solar cell efficiency with significantly reduced material use. We report optoelectronic simulations that highlight photon and generated carrier management opportunities for improvement of thin film Cu(InxGa1−x)Se2 (CIGS) device performance. Structures realized via either self-assembly or patterning via nanoimprint lithography, and also a combination of both are predicted to exhibit significant increases in short circuit current density and open circuit voltage simultaneously. The structures investigated include: 1) self-assembled nonplanar structures that strongly scatter incident light and enhance carrier generation near regions of high electric potential, 2) lithographically-patterned embedded periodic dielectric structures, 3) planar dielectric layers that separate the CIGS absorber from the molybdenum back-contact via reduced-area contacts that minimize optical and electronic losses, 4) a combination of these for combined effects. We find that the self-assembled nonplanar CIGS cells with 700nm planar equivalent thickness, combined with dielectric separation layers yield increases in short circuit current density and open circuit voltage up to 3.4mAcm−2 and 29mV, respectively. The absolute efficiency increases from 15.4% to 18.1%, compared to the predicted efficiency for planar CIGS thin film cells of equivalent thickness. The addition of a single layer MgF2 anti-reflection coating brings the maximum predicted efficiency up to 19.7% for randomly textured devices.

Abstract: We demonstrate enhanced short circuit current density and power conversion efficiency in InGaN heterojunction solar cells using a semibulk absorber (multi-layered InGaN/GaN structure), with 8% indium concentration. The semibulk absorber shows peak external quantum efficiency of 85% and short current density of 0.57mA/cm2 under AM 1.5G, i.e. almost four times higher than the typical InGaN solar cells based on single thick InGaN absorber. The power conversion efficiency is around 0.39% under AM 1.5G, almost three times higher than state of the art for 8% indium incorporation. The improvement in power conversion efficiency is attributed to the enhancement in structural quality of the InGaN absorber. Simulations and experimental results are presented for an in depth investigation of the parameters limiting the power conversion efficiency of the solar cell. The semibulk absorber is an elegant solution for the realization of highly efficient InGaN-based PIN heterojunction solar cells.

Abstract: A series of nonpolar antisolvents (chlorobenzene, bromobenzene, iodobenzene and toluene) were used to assist in the formation of smooth and crystalline CH3NH3PbI3 thin films by a one-step spin-coating method. The structural, optical and excitonic characteristics of the resultant CH3NH3PI3 thin films were analyzed using an atomic-force microscope, X-ray diffractometer, absorbance spectrum, photoluminescence (PL) spectrum, time-resolved PL and temperature-dependent PL. The properties of the CH3NH3PbI3 thin films are dependent on the relative polarity and boiling point of the nonpolar antisolvents used in the washing treatment process. The interplay between nucleation (relative polarity) and crystal growth (boiling point) during the formation of CH3NH3PbI3 thin films influences the short-circuit current density (JSC) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the corresponding solar cells. The experimental results demonstrate that iodobenzene can be substituted for toluene as a more efficient antisolvent in the washing treatment process during the fabrication of CH3NH3PbI3 thin films. In addition, it is predicted that the JSC and PCE can be further improved by increasing the crystallinity of the CH3NH3PbI3 thin film.

Abstract: Cinnamaldehyde, the main chemical component of the essential oil separated from the traditional herb Cinnamomum cassia, has been demonstrated to be an efficient cytotoxic agent against several human cancers. The present experiment showed that cinnamaldehyde dose-dependently depresses the proliferation of three types of NSCLC cells and induces cell apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, cinnamaldehyde attenuated CoCl2-induced EMT and decreased matrix metalloprotease (MMP) family while the in vivo study showed the same trend. Mechanistically, cinnamaldehyde imitated the suppressive effect of XAV939 on cell motility and EMT which could be impaired by LiCl. Collectively, our research demonstrated for the first time that cinnamaldehyde is able to inhibit NSCLC cell growth by inducing apoptosis and reverse EMT through terminating Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which might supply further insight into cinnamaldehyde-mediated anti-tumor effect against NSCLC for better prognosis.

Abstract: Hypoxia enhances immortality and metastatic properties of solid tumors. Deregulation of histone acetylation has been associated with several metastatic cancers but its effect on hypoxic responses of cancer cells is not known. This study aimed at understanding the effectiveness of the hydrazinocurcumin, CTK7A, an inhibitor of p300 lysine/histone acetyltransferase (KAT/HAT) activity, in inducing apoptosis of gastric cancer cells (GCCs) exposed to cobalt chloride (CoCl2), a hypoxia-mimetic chemical, or 1% O2. Here, we show that CTK7A-induced hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation in CoCl2-exposed and invasive gastric cancer cells (GCCs) leads to p38 MAPK-mediated Noxa expression and thereafter, mitochondrial apoptotic events. Noxa induction in normal immortalized gastric epithelial cells after CTK7A and hypoxia-exposure is remarkably less in comparison to similarly-treated GCCs. Moreover, hypoxia-exposed GCCs, which have acquired invasive properties, become apoptotic after CTK7A treatment to a significantly higher extent than normoxic cells. Thus, we show the potential of CTK7A in sensitizing hypoxic and metastatic GCCs to apoptosis induction.

Abstract: Perhydropolysilazane (PHPS), a ceramic precursor resin with outstanding high-temperature resistance, was used as the shell material to prepare novel sodium nitrate microcapsules (MCP-NaNO3) for high-temperature thermal energy storage. The microstructure and thermal properties of the MCP-NaNO3 were investigated by DSC-TG, SEM, FTIR, EDS, etc. The MCP-NaNO3 presented a melting point of 306.19±0.10℃ and latent heat of 159.2±2.4J/g. The MCP-NaNO3 had a thin shell, and the weight percentage of NaNO3 in the MCP-NaNO3 was calculated to be about 85wt%. The melting point of MCP-NaNO3 almost had no change, and the supercooling of MCP-NaNO3 only had a small increase of about 2.69℃ compared with that of NaNO3. The thermal decomposition temperature of NaNO3 in the MCP-NaNO3 was enhanced more than 36℃, up to 647.60℃. The PHPS shell was able to ensure the MCP-NaNO3 to be still granular after heated at 350℃, and the melting point and freezing point of the MCP-NaNO3 were almost invariable. The MCP-NaNO3 developed in this study has great promise in future energy and chemical processes. The method that using ceramic precursor resins as microcapsule shells paves a new way to prepare various high-temperature phase change microcapsules.

Abstract: Copper (I) thiocyanate (CuSCN) is a cost-competitive hole selective contact for the emerging organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells. However, limitation of solvent is the main issue for getting an optimal thickness for pin-hole free selective contacts. We have developed various solvents such as mixture of propylsulfide with chlorobenzene (1:1), isopropanol with methylammonium iodide (10mg/ml) and propylsulfide + isopropanol (1:2) + MAI (10mg/ml) for dissolving CuSCN. It was found that perovskite layer was more stable once CuSCN coating laid on the top surface using the propylsulfide + isopropanol (1:2) + MAI (10mg/ml) solvent than conventional propylsulfide by doctor blade technique. By employing low temperature solution-process techniques, power conversion achieved over 10% under full sun illumination by the proposed mixed solvent. CuSCN continues to offer promise as a chemically stable and straightforward replacement for the commonly used expensive organic hole conductor (2,2’,7,7’-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)9,9’-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD)).

Abstract: Novel optically-rough and physically-flat transparent conductive oxides (TCO) substrates were developed for thin-film solar cells with superstrate configuration. These substrates consist of a widegap Al doped Zn1−xMgxO (AZMO) transparent conductive thin film prepared by sol-gel process and glass substrates with periodic hole array pattern formed by a nanoimprinting technique. These substrates showed low optical absorption, low surface roughness, strong light-diffraction behavior, and moderate sheet resistance, simultaneously. The number of AZMO coating layers and the dimension of the hole feature on the pattern influenced the surface roughness and diffraction behavior of these substrates significantly. A substrate with 40 AZMO coating layers on a hole pattern (diameter=2µm, pitch=2.2µm, and depth=1µm) showed a root-mean-square surface roughness of 5.5nm, a sheet resistance of 34.3Ω/sq, and a haze ratio of 11.2% at the wavelength of 700nm. These TCO substrates enabled hydrogenated amorphous Si single junction solar cells with large open-circuit voltage (Voc=0.92V) and good spectral response through acting as the front electrode. These substrates would enable an efficient light management and the growth of high quality photoactive materials, simultaneously.

Abstract: CD36 signal transduction modulates the uptake of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) and foam cell formation. We previously observed that 7-ketocholesteryl-9-carboxynonanoate (oxLig-1), the lipid moiety of oxLDL, activates the CD36-Src-JNK/ERK1/2 signalling pathway. In this study, we assessed the role of the ω-carboxyl group in the binding of oxLig-1 to CD36 and investigated whether the binding of the ω-carboxyl group to CD36 triggers CD36-mediated signalling, thereby resulting in the upregulation of caveolin-1 expression. Our results showed that oxLig-1 bound to CD36 and that the ω-carboxyl group was critical for this binding. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses showed that interaction between the ω-carboxyl group of oxLig-1 and CD36 triggered intracellular Src-JNK/ERK1/2 signal transduction. Moreover, the binding of the ω-carboxyl group to CD36 induced caveolin-1 expression and translocation to the membrane in macrophages. Additionally, inhibitors of Src, JNK and ERK and siRNA targeting CD36 and NF-κB significantly suppressed the enhanced caveolin-1 expression induced by oxLig-1. In conclusion, these observations suggest that oxLig-1 is a critical epitope of oxLDL that mediates the binding of oxLDL to CD36 and activates downstream Src-JNK/ERK1/2-NF-κB signal transduction, resulting in upregulation of caveolin-1 expression in macrophages.

Abstract: We report a method to prepare molybdenum oxide thin films using the stable cetrimonium bromide-modified MoO3 (CTAB-modified MoO3) precursor solution. The effect of thermal treatment on the optical, crystalline, morphologic properties and surface wettability is greatly obvious because of the pyrolytic decomposition of CTAB. The highly efficient and stable polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been also fabricated by adopting CTAB-modified MoO3 nanocomposite films as the novel and universal anode buffer layers (ABLs). The P3HT:ICBA based solar cells with CTAB-modified MoO3 at 200°C heat treatment exhibit an best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.80% with long-term stability, and the PTB7:PC71BM based solar cells with CTAB-modified MoO3 at 200°C heat treatment show an best PCE of 8.34% with long-term stability, which are higher than that of the corresponding devices with PEDOT:PSS films. The improvement in device performance is mainly due to the agreeable electrical properties and enhanced charge extraction of the CTAB-modified MoO3 ABLs, and CTAB modification to the MoO3 surface can effectively passivate its surface traps, suppress the recombination loss of carriers. The surface of CTAB-modified MoO3 films is also more hydrophobic than that of the PEDOT:PSS. In a word, these indicate the CTAB-modified MoO3 films may be used as a novel and generally applicable hole transport layer for high-efficiency and ambient stable polymer solar cells.

Abstract: Conjugated polymer poly(9-vinylcarbazole) (PVK) has been explored as an efficient hole transport material (HTM) to replace poly(3,4-ethylenedio-xythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) for the preparation of p-i-n type, inverted planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells. The PVK film can be facilely deposited by room-temperature solution-casting without any doping or post treatments. Using MAPbI3 as the photoactive layer, a 15.8% stabilized power conversion efficiency was achieved in ITO/PVK/MAPbI3/PCBM/Ag devices, which is a significant improvement compared with 12.1% from devices using PEDOT:PSS as the HTM. The perovskite photoactive layer cast on PVK HTM has higher crystallinity and less PbI2 residues, leading to a higher charge recombination resistance of the device. After a storage of 1000h, the PCE of PVK- and PEDOT:PSS- based devices dropped to 82.5% and 56% respectively, and demonstrated that the PVK-based perovskite devices is more stable compared with the PEDOT:PSS-based devices.

Abstract: Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) thin films deposited by spray pyrolysis technique are quite attractive for solar cell applications. However, low efficiency values have been achieved up to date. Among the different optoelectronic parameters, relatively low open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current density values are the common feature in sprayed-CZTS solar cells. Nevertheless, there is no report focused on explaining the main sources of such low performances. One of the most important parameters governing the behavior of a solar cell is minority carrier diffusion length. Furthermore, a transport mechanisms study is required to understand main recombination paths. In this work, sprayed-CZTS thin film solar cells are fabricated in order to study the main limiting factors regarding this technology. It is found that CZTS films are characterized by low minority carrier diffusion length values, emphasizing the need for improving sprayed-CZTS crystalline quality. Finally, current-voltage measurements at different temperatures for solar cell with maximum efficiency were carried out in order to find out the dominant transport mechanisms. It is discovered that tunneling enhanced recombination at junction interface gives a quantitative description of the electronic loss mechanisms in the sprayed-CZTS based heterojunction solar cells.

Abstract: Aluminum (3at%)-doped ZnO (AZO)/Au/AZO multilayer films with low resistivity and high transmittance are in situ deposited at room temperature via facing-target sputtering for AZO and direct current (DC) sputtering for Au. The optical and electrical properties of multilayer films are compared with conventionally (on-axis) sputtered and facing-target sputtered (FTS) AZO films. The FTS samples show better crystallinity than that of on-axis sputtered samples, and the lowest value for resistivity is 7.9×10−5Ω-cm at an Au layer thickness of 8nm, which is compared with that of a conventional FTO electrode. The photo-conversion efficiencies (PCE) of the perovskite solar cells based on the AZO multilayer electrodes deposited via FTS and on-axis sputtering are 9.5% and 8.2%, respectively. Although the PCE of AZO multilayer-based-solar cells exhibit a lower efficiency than that of the FTO based-devices (~12.3%), the perovskite solar cell performance based on the FTS AZO multilayer electrodes is very attractive for applications to flexible planar-structured solar cells.

Abstract: Copper antimony sulfide (CuSbS2) thin films were prepared by annealing and rapid thermal processing (RTP) of Sb2S3–Cu precursor layers at different conditions. Sb2S3 thin films (200nm) were deposited by chemical bath deposition from a solution containing SbCl3 and Na₂S₂O₃. Copper layers were thermally evaporated onto the Sb2S3 thin films. A systematic study was done by varying Cu layer thickness as well as the heating conditions. Cu thickness was varied from low (<10nm) to 100nm and the heating conditions were annealing at 380°C, RTP at 500/600°C and annealing at 380°C followed by RTP. The thin films formed at different conditions were analyzed using different techniques to determine their crystalline structure, morphology, elemental composition, chemical state and physical properties. For the given Sb2S3 thickness, Cu 50nm was identified as the effective Cu thickness for the formation of CuSbS2. The CuSbS2 thin films formed at different conditions were incorporated in photovoltaic structures of superstrate configuration: Glass/ITO/CdS/CuSbS2. The best photovoltaic parameters obtained were Voc=665mV, Jsc=1.35mA/cm2, FF=0.62 and η=0.6% measured under illumination using AM1.5 radiation from a solar simulator. Voc and FF are the highest values ever reported for the CuSbS2 based solar cells. The present work strengthens the research activities to improve CuSbS2 based photovoltaic performance, and thus PV technologies using earth abundant and non-toxic materials.

Abstract: Synthesis of new semiconductors responsive under visible light/sunlight has been considered as an elegant strategy of photocatalyst development for efficient solar light harvesting applications. In the present study, new La-substituted layered Sillén-Aurivillius oxyhalide intergrowths, Bi3LaNbO8X (X=Cl, Br), have been prepared by solid state reaction. The compounds are characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (p-XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV–vis DRS), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and photoluminescence (PL) studies. The P-XRD data revealed formation of Sillén-Aurivillius hybrid perovskites isostructural to the parent compounds, Bi4NbO8X (X = Cl, Br), and the FE-SEM-EDS confirmed the morphology to be agglomerates of submicron-sized particles with desired compositions as expected. The band gap for all the pristine oxyhalides lie in range 2.43–2.54eV indicative of their sunlight active nature. The sunlight-driven photocatalytic activity studies through Rhodamine B (RhB) degradation unveiled excellent dye degradation efficiencies over Bi3LaNbO8Cl and Bi3LaNbO8Br in the acidic medium. The enhanced photocatalytic activities are attributed to superior charge carrier separation and dye adsorption in the La-substituted phases. Scavenger tests demonstrated the active role of hole and hydroxyl radical as key species in the RhB degradation under sunlight in presence of Bi3LaNbO8Br. The demonstration of enhanced activity under natural sunlight is significant in future development of environmental remediation technologies by harvesting solar energy.

Abstract: Quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) were fabricated using low cost Bi2S3 nanocrystals and CdS quantum dots. Au nanorods (NRs) were synthesized by a seed-growth method and Au NRs were deposited over a TiO2/Bi2S3/CdS electrode by a drop casting method. The Au NRs increased the light absorption of the photoanode, TiO2/Bi2S3/CdS/Au NRs, through plasmonic effects. CdS QDs absorb in the visible region, Bi2S3 nanocrystals absorb almost in the near infrared (NIR) region, and Au NRs show near field plasmonic effects and are also capable of hot electron transfer, and therefore this combined electrode is expected to deliver high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Upon illumination, electron-hole pairs are generated in CdS and Bi2S3, and the excited electrons are transferred to TiO2 directly or via the equilibrated Fermi level induced by Au NRs. QDSSCs with different photoanode compositions were fabricated with functionalized MWCNTs as a counter electrode and a Na2S solution as an electrolyte. Among all cells, the highest PCE achieved for the champion cell is 4.26%, with a TiO2/Bi2S3/CdS/Au NRs photoanode, with an active area of 0.13cm2, and 3.83%, when the area was increased to 0.51cm2. Retention of a moderately high efficiency upon scale-up indicates that the photoactive material packing over the substrates requires some more improvement to match the values attained when the cells were fabricated over small areas. Compared to CdS QDs, Bi2S3 nanocrystals are less toxic, and have a bandgap of 1.55eV. The cell with a TiO2/Bi2S3/Au NRs photoanode also shows a high PCE of 2%. The use of Bi2S3 nanocrystals to yield high efficiency QDSSCs is a small but a vital step towards developing cells with low toxicity.

Abstract: The present research was conducted to evaluate the effect of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) as a potential therapeutic tool for improvement of skeletal muscle recovery after induced chemodenervation atrophy by repeated local injection of botulinum toxin-A in the right tibialis anterior muscle of adult male albino rats. Forty five adult Wistar male albino rats were classified into control and experimental groups. Experimental group was further subdivided into 3 equal subgroups; induced atrophy, BM-MSCs treated and recovery groups. Biochemical analysis of serum LDH, CK and Real-time PCR for Bcl-2, caspase 3 and caspase 9 was measured. Skeletal muscle sections were stained with H and E, Mallory trichrome, and Immunohistochemical reaction for Bax and CD34. Improvement in the skeletal muscle histological structure was noticed in BM-MSCs treated group, however, in the recovery group, some sections showed apparent transverse striations and others still affected. Immunohistochemical reaction of Bax protein showed strong positive immunoreaction in the cytoplasm of muscle fibers in the induced atrophy group. BM-MSCs treated group showed weak positive reaction while the recovery group showed moderate reaction in the cytoplasm of muscle fibers. Immunohistochemical reaction for CD34 revealed occasional positive CD34 stained cells in the induced atrophy group. In BM-MSCs treated group, multiple positive CD34 stained cells were detected. However, recovery group showed some positive CD34 stained cells at the periphery of the muscle fibers. Marked improvement in the regenerative capacity of skeletal muscles after BM-MSCs therapy. Hence, stem cell therapy provides a new hope for patients suffering from myopathies and severe injuries.

Abstract: Novel thiophenyl-substituted anthracene derivatives (D-A) bearing a variety of electron-withdrawing groups were designed and synthesized for organic solar cells (OSCs). Their electrochemical and electro-optical properties were examined with strong donor-acceptor interaction. The electrochemical properties were examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements. These estimated values from CV measurements are in good agreement with the optical band gaps. HOMO, LUMO, and Eg values of designed organic materials were estimated. Furthermore, these new generation organic materials were fabricated to find their solar cell performances.

Abstract: Increased poly glutamine (polyQ) stretch at N-terminal of Huntingtin (HTT) causes Huntington’s disease. HTT interacts with large number of proteins, although the preference for such interactions with wild type or mutated HTT protein remains largely unknown. HYPK, an intrinsically unstructured protein chaperone and interactor of mutant HTT was found to interact with myeloid leukemia factor 1 (MLF1) and 2 (MLF2). To identify the role of these two proteins in mutant HTT mediated aggregate formation and toxicity in a cell model, both the proteins were found to preferentially interact with the mutated N-terminal HTT. They significantly reduced the number of cells containing mutant HTT aggregates and subsequent apoptosis in Neuro2A cells. Additionally, in FRAP assay, mobile fraction of mutant HTT aggregates was increased in the presence of MLF1 or MLF2. Further, MLF1 could release transcription factors like p53, CBP and CREB from mutant HTT aggregates. Moreover, in HeLa cell co-expressing mutant HTT exon1 and full length MLF1, p53 was released from the aggregates, leading to the recovery of the expression of the GADD45A transcript, a p53 regulated gene. Taking together, these results showed that MLF1 and MLF2 modulated the formation of aggregates and induction of apoptosis as well as the expressions of genes indirectly.

Abstract: Photovoltaic system performance is affected by changes in the input sunlight spectrum. Moreover, the different photovoltaic materials employed show different spectral responses, having different spectral behaviour as a result. Many authors have developed methods and proposed indexes for quantifying the spectral influences in photovoltaic systems under the time-varying weather variables. These methods use different equipment, different procedures and assumptions, present different levels of complexity and accuracy, and have advantages and disadvantages in each specific context and application. In this paper, for the first time, a systematic review of the available methods and photovoltaic spectral indexes is presented. Each alternative is analysed in detail and a comparative study is done. In addition, as several authors have measured and/or calculated the spectral impact on the energy yield of the different photovoltaic technologies at particular locations and climates, the existing results are summarized and discussed in order to elucidate the spectral behaviour of each technology as a function of the relevant atmospheric parameters, i.e. air mass, aerosol optical depth and precipitable water. The presented study covers non-concentrating and high-concentrating photovoltaic technologies and is intended for clarifying the methods available for the spectral analysis and the spectral impact on energy harvesting of the photovoltaic technologies.

Abstract: In this paper we report on the single stage deposition of CuInxGa1−xSe2 (CIGS)-based bifacial solar cells on glass coated with Fluorine-doped Tin Oxide (FTO) or Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) by single-stage low-temperature (250°C) pulsed electron deposition (LTPED). We show that the mechanism of Sodium incorporation during the low-temperature deposition of CIGS on both FTO and ITO leads to the formation of a stable n+/p+ ohmic tunnel junction and photovoltaic efficiencies exceeding 14% can be obtained without any intentional bandgap grading of CIGS. The significant degradation of the cell fill factor with decreasing CIGS thickness is found to be related to the presence of craters left behind by micro-fragments of CIGS target, which are weakly incorporated in the film during the LTPED growth and removed during the subsequent process steps. Evidence is also presented that the low-temperature deposition of CIGS on ITO leads to the formation of a Ga-rich CIGS layer at the interface and to an unintentional compositional grading propagating towards the active region of the solar cells. The defects associated with this grading may be responsible for the loss in FF and Voc with respect to the cells deposited on FTO and Mo back contacts.

Abstract: Objective/background
To assess the percentage of CD4+, CD8+, and natural killer cells (CD16+, CD56+) in children with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) at presentation and study their impact on disease chronicity.
Methods
This case–control study was conducted at the Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Unit, Menoufia University Hospital (tertiary care center in Egypt). The study was held on 30 children presenting with ITP; they were followed-up and classified into two groups: 15 children with acute ITP; and 15 children with chronic ITP. Patients were compared to a group of 15 healthy children of matched age and sex. Measurements of CD4+, CD8+, and natural killer cells (CD16+, CD56+) by flow cytometry were assessed and compared in these groups.
Results
CD4+ and CD4+/CD8+ were significantly lower in acute and chronic patients than the control group (p<0.05 and p<0.001, respectively), with no significant difference between acute and chronic patients (p>0.05). However, CD8+ was significantly higher in acute and chronic patients than the control group (p<0.05), with no significant difference between acute and chronic patients (p>0.05). Natural killer cell percent was significantly lower in acute patients than the control group (p<0.001), with no significant difference between chronic and control groups (p>0.05).
Conclusion
ITP is associated with immunity dysfunction denoted by the increase in cytotoxic T lymphocytes and the decrease in natural killer cells.

Abstract: Background
Peripheral nerve injuries represent a clinical problem with insufficient or unsatisfactory treatment options. Functional outcome with nerve guidance conduits was unsatisfactory in nerve defects with increased gap size. So, cell therapy may benefit as a tool for optimizing the regeneration process. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of combination of cell therapy and nerve guidance conduits on the nerve regeneration and on the expression of the factors aiding the regeneration in a rat model of sciatic nerve injury.
Methods and results
Sixty Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups: Group I: normal control group; Group II: sciatic nerve injury (SNI) with a 10mm long sciatic nerve gap; Group III: SNI with using a nerve conduit (NC) for nerve gap bridging; and Group IV: SNI with using a NC associated with Wharton’s jelly derived mesenchymal stem cells (WJ-MSCs). The results showed that the combination therapy NC+WJ-MSCs caused much better beneficial effects than NC alone evidenced by increasing sciatic nerve index and pin-prick score. The histopathological analysis found that the use of the NC combined with WJ[HYPHEN]MSCs resulted in a structure of the sciatic nerve comparable to the normal one with better nerve regeneration when compared with NC only. There was no differentiation of WJ-MSCs into nerve structure. Lastly, there was an upregulation of expression for netrin-1, ninjurin, BDNF, GDNF, VEGF and angiopoitin-1 rat genes in NC+WJ-MSCs group than NC alone.
Conclusion
The addition of WJ-MSCs to the nerve guidance conduits seems to bring significant advantage for nerve regeneration, basically by increasing the expression of neurotrophic and angiogenic factors establishing more favorable environment for nerve regeneration.

Abstract: An induction furnace is an electric furnace in which ferrous metal scrap and fluxes (e.g. silica, limestone) are melted using an electromagnetic field to produce steel or cast iron. This metallurgical process is accompanied by the generation of large amounts of wastes called slags, which are composed mainly of a non-metallic part as well as a small metallic part. At the end of the melting process the slags layer is removed from the furnace top, then it is air-cooled and stored prior to discharge. While blast furnace slags (BFS), electric arc furnace slags (EAFS), and ladle furnace slags (LFS) were characterized in earlier works for thermal energy storage up to 1000°C, the induction furnace slags (IFS) have never been investigated for this application. Thus the aim of this paper is the thermophysical and chemical characterization of IFS to be used as high-temperature thermal energy storage materials (around 1000°C) in packed bed TES system. Chemical investigation of this metallurgical waste was conducted using: Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) coupled with the Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Their thermal heat capacity was measured using Modulated differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC), while their bulk density was determined using the pycnometer method. It was found that they have a good specific heat capacity (Cp ≈ 700J/kg°C) and a good bulk density (ρ ≈ 2583kg/m3). The thermal stability of the IFS was assessed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) from room temperature up to 1000°C; Three cycles of heating/cooling were applied on the IFS and their thermal stability was proved at the end of the first cycle. The obtained results suggest that IFS are good candidate materials for high-temperature thermal energy storage application (up to 1000°C).

Abstract: A controllable transparent device using an inorganic glass gel-dispersed liquid crystal (GDLC) was fabricated using the sol-gel method to overcome the limitations of conventional polymer-dispersed liquid crystals, such as haziness and yellowing. In this study, silica gel and titanium dioxide acted as a matrix holding the liquid crystal droplets, and the optical properties of the proposed GDLC were then studied in a silica solution by mixing tetra ethyl ortho-silicate, methyltriethoxysilane, isopropyl alcohol, and nitric acid in an aqueous solution. A titanium solution with titanium isopropoxide and acetylacetone was also mixed with the silica solution, with the further addition of a nematic liquid crystal. A parameter study was carried out by varying the concentration to obtain the best sample, with fast response times of ~0.5 and 3ms, respectively for the on and off processes, high contrast, and low haziness when compared with previously reported results. The GDLC samples exhibited low scattering, a clear colorless state, and a low driving voltage, which are all very important advantages for applications. For demonstration, our glass-based smart window was also applied as a rear-view mirror in a vehicle for anti-dazzling purposes at night, which has not been reported by others.

Abstract: We present a light-trapping design capable of significantly enhancing the photon absorption in any subcell of a multi-junction solar cell. The design works by coupling incident light into waveguide modes in one of the subcells via a diffraction grating, and preventing these modes from leaking into lower subcells via a low-index layer and a distributed Bragg reflector, which together form an omnidirectional mirror. This allows the thickness of the target subcell to be reduced without compromising photon absorption, which improves carrier collection, and therefore photocurrent. The paper focuses on using the composite structure to improve the radiation hardness of a InGaP/Ga(In)As/Ge space solar cell. In this context, it is shown via simulation that the Ga(In)As middle-cell thickness can be reduced from 3500 to 700nm, whilst maintaining strong photon absorption, and that this leads to a significantly improved end-of-life photocurrent in the Ga(In)As middle cell. However, the design can in general be applied to a wide range of multi-junction solar cell types. We discuss the principles of operation of the design, as well as possible methods of its fabrication and integration into multi-junction solar cells.

Abstract: Hydrogen doped indium oxide (In2O3:H) with excellent optoelectronic properties, deposited using atomic layer deposition (ALD), has been made applicable as a window electrode material for silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells. It is particularly challenging to integrate ALD In2O3:H into SHJ solar cells due to a low reactivity of the metalorganic precursor cyclopentadienyl indium (InCp) with the H-terminated surface of a-Si:H. This challenge has been overcome by a simple and effective plasma-based surface pretreatment developed in this work. A remote inductively coupled O2 or Ar plasma has been used to modify the surface of a-Si:H, thereby promoting the adsorption of InCp on the surface. The impact of the short plasma exposure on c-Si/a-Si:H interface passivation has also been studied. It has been found that the observed degradation of the interface is not due to ion bombardment, but rather due to ultraviolet emission from the plasma. Fortunately, these light-induced defects have been found to be metastable, and the interface passivation can thus easily be fully recovered by a short post-annealing. Using such a mild Ar plasma pretreatment, ALD In2O3:H has been successfully implemented in a SHJ solar cell. A short-circuit current density of 40.1mA/cm2, determined from external quantum efficiency, is demonstrated for a textured SHJ solar cell with an In2O3:H window electrode, compared to 38.5mA/cm2 for a reference cell that has the conventional Sn-doped indium oxide (In2O3:Sn, ITO) window electrode. The enhanced photocurrent stems from a reduced parasitic absorption of In2O3:H in the entire wavelength range of 400–1200nm.

Abstract: Environmental estrogens bind to estrogen receptors, mimic estrogenic actions, and have adverse effects on human health like Bisphenol – A (BPA) which is used as a monomer in the production of polycarbonate plastics (PC) and epoxy resins which are used in variety of canned foods. Skeletal muscle plays an essential role in maintaining systemic glucose metabolism. In the present study, we investigated the possible effects of BPA on insulin signalling molecules and GLUT4 translocation in the gastrocnemius muscle of adult male rat. Rats were divided into four groups – Group I: Control (vehicle-corn oil treated), Group II, III and IV were administered with BPA (10, 100 and 400mg/kg b.wt/day, respectively) through oral gavage. Fasting blood glucose level of BPA treated groups showed a significant increase, oral glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance were also impaired in these animals. BPA significantly decreased the protein levels of insulin signalling molecules like IR, IRS-1, Akt, AS160 and its phosphorylated forms and blunts GLUT4 translocation by altering the levels of v- and t- SNARE proteins that assist the translocation process, thereby decreasing glucose uptake and oxidation in the gastrocnemius muscle. These results suggest that BPA has detrimental effects on insulin signalling molecules and GLUT4 translocation in the gastrocnemius muscle and thus impairs glucose homeostasis.

Abstract: Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) has been electrochemically polymerized from 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) monomers through a vertically oriented mesoporous silica matrix previously formed on FTO electrodes. The mesoporous silica thin films with pore channels of 3nm in diameter, closely packed in a hexagonal arrangement, were obtained by electrochemically-assisted self-assembly (EASA). The mesoporous silica/PEDOT films were characterized by SEM and TEM microscopy and by cyclic voltammety. They were also used to construct electrochromic devices (ECDs), which were fully characterized for switching speed, coloration efficiencies, and cycling and voltammetric responses.

Abstract: We show that it is possible to assemble a sparse mono-layer of Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) at cathode interface of a polymer solar cell based on poly(3-hexylthiophene): [6,6]-phenyl-C60-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT: PCBM) through the synergic effect of strong convective outflow, surface energy, Fe3O4 NPs concentration and active layer thickness. When the distance between those Fe3O4 NPs is smaller than the size of P3HT, the P3HT is excluded from the inter-particle space, and fullerene molecules fill in the space to build electron transport pathways improving charge transport and collection near cathode interface proved by transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The power conversion efficiency of the devices is improved up to 20%. The bulk morphology of light absorbing layers is not affected by the addition of Fe3O4 NPs as demonstrated by neutron and X-ray scattering results.

Abstract: Advanced components in next-generation concentrating solar power (CSP) applications will require advanced heat-transfer fluids and thermal-storage materials that work from about 550°C to at least 720°C, for integration with advanced power-conversion systems. To reach the cost target, less-expensive salts such as molten chlorides have been identified as high-temperature fluid candidates. High-strength alloys need to be identified and their mechanical and chemical degradation must be minimized to be used in CSP applications. Approaches for corrosion mitigation need to be investigated and optimized to drive down corrosion rates to acceptable levels—in the order of tens of micrometers per year—for achieving a long system lifetime of at least 30 years. Surface passivation is a good corrosion mitigation approach because the alloy could then be exposed to both the liquid and the vapor phases of the salt mixture. In this investigation, we pre-oxidized the alumina-forming alloys Inconel 702, Haynes 224, and Kanthal APMT at different temperatures, dwelling times, and atmospheres to produce the passivation by forming protective oxides at the surface. The pretreated alloys were later corroded in molten MgCl2 – 64.41wt% KCl at 700°C in a flowing Ar atmosphere. We performed electrochemical techniques such as open-circuit potential followed by a potentiodynamic polarization sweep and conventional long-term weight-change tests to down-select the best-performing alloy and pre-oxidation conditions. The best corrosion results were obtained for In702 pre-oxidized in zero air at 1050°C for 4h. Metallographic characterization of the pre-oxidized alloys and of the corroded surfaces showed that the formation of dense and uniform alumina scale during the pre-oxidation appears to protect the alloy from attack by molten chloride.

Abstract: The surface and near surface structure of copper-indium-gallium-selenide (CIGS) absorber layers is integral to the producing a high-quality photovoltaic junction. By using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and monitoring multiple elemental absorption edges with both theory and experiment, we are able to identify several features of the surface of CIGS as a function of composition and surface treatments. The XAS data shows trends in the near surface region of oxygen, copper, indium and gallium species as the copper content is varied in the films. The oxygen surface species are also monitored through a series of experiments that systematically investigates the effects of water and various solutions of: ammonium hydroxide, cadmium sulfate, and thiourea. These being components of cadmium sulfide chemical bath deposition (CBD). Characteristics of the CBD are correlated with a restorative effect that produces as normalized, uniform surface chemistry as measured by XAS. This surface chemistry is found in CIGS solar cells with excellent power conversion efficiency (<19%). The results provide new insight for CIGS processing strategies that seek to replace CBD and/or cadmium sulfide.

In this study, an innovative bionic photo-thermal energy conversion model based on polar bears hair (Ursus maritimus) energy conversion mechanism has been explored and optimized. Besides, a processing technology and wave guiding principle using this new model were investigated to enhance the solar-thermal energy utilization property. Specifically, the fluorescent property, reflectivity and photo-thermal conversion property of the selected fabricating materials were measured and demonstrated in detail.

Abstract: In this work, using compositing of two semiconductors WO3 and g-C3N4 (WO3:g-C3N4=1:1, 1:3, and 3:1), we achieved the best solar light driven photocatalyst. The photocatalytic activity of WO3/g-C3N4 nanocomposite was investigated using the photodegradation of an azo dye, Reactive black 5 (RB5) and photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution. The WO3/g-C3N4 nanocomposite with a mass ratio of 1:3 (W1G3) showed the highest photocatalytic activity in degrading the most stable component (benzene component) of RB5 under solar light irradiation. By using different scavengers, it was determined that superoxide radical anion is the main reactive species for the photocatalytic degradation of RB5. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry techniques were used to investigate electrochemical and photoelectrochemical properties of WO3/g-C3N4 nanocomposite. W1G3 showed the best electrochemical property compared with WO3, g-C3N4, and other nanocomposites because of the strongest anodic current density in the cyclic voltammetry. The anodic currents of W1G3 in CV exhibited an enhancement of 3.4 and 1.2 fold compared to those of the WO3 and g-C3N4, respectively. The electrode parameters for photoelectrochemical properties, obtained by linear sweep voltammetry technique, confirmed that W1G3 nanocomposite is an effective photocatalyst for photoelectrochemical water reduction reaction. The excellent photocatalytic properties of this nanocomposite is due to both the increase of the light absorption and the presence of WO3 NPs on the g-C3N4 surface nanosheets, decrease of the recombination rate of electron and hole because of Z-scheme configuration and suitable band positions.

Abstract: The use of nanofluids as the working fluid in systems for converting solar to thermal energy has led to remarkable progresses. This study has investigated the thermo-optical characteristics of nanofluids containing Graphene oxide nanoplatelets/deionized water as the working fluid for low-temperature direct absorption solar collectors (DASCs). The prepared samples of nanofluid contain graphene oxide nanoplatelets based on deionized water with weight percentages of 0.001, 0.005, 0.015 and 0.045. Results show that the applied nanofluid has suitable ability compared to the base fluid in absorbing solar energy, ranging from 200 to 2500nm. Also, results from calculation of absorbed energy's fraction suggest that the minimum height or thickness of the nanofluid layer having the ability of full sun's energy, is for the nanofluid with weight percentage of 0.045 and height of 3cm that has the ability of absorbing 99.6% of energy. The thermal conductivity coefficient of prepared samples was measured at temperature ranging 25–50. Results showed that increasing the weight percentage of nanofluid along with increase in temperature would improve nanofluid's thermal properties in comparison with the base fluid. Finally, by investigating the impact of weight percentage of the nanofluid's temperature on radiative properties and thermal conductivity, this nanofluid with strong absorption band in the range of 280–350nm (nanometers) was introduced and proposed as the appropriate environment for using direct absorption solar collectors.

Abstract: Zn diffusion processes in n-Ga0.78In0.22As0.2Sb0.8 epitaxial films are studied using different diffusion sources, a series of the Zn profiles with single and double humps are obtained. The group V-atoms (As and Sb) are found to have little effect on suppressing the surface “dead region”. The Ga and In atoms have entirely different effect on diffusion although they are both group III-atoms. The “dead region” is suppressed completely under Ga-rich conditions, while the suppression will not occur under In-rich conditions. The GaInAsSb cells are fabricated under pure Zn and Ga-rich conditions. An electrical heating thermophotovoltaic system is fabricated for cell testing. Under the radiation from 1055°C-SiN ceramics emitter, the output power density of the GaInAsSb cell obtained under Ga-rich condition is much larger than that of the cell obtained under pure Zn condition, which demonstrated that the GaInAsSb cells can be fabricated without precise etching under Ga-rich conditions.

Abstract: SiGe materials on Si substrate are promising candidates to act as the bottom cell in a tandem structure, due to its high mobility, good process compatibility, adjustable lattice constant, and capability of absorbing light of wavelengths up to 1800nm. This work demonstrates the improvement of short circuit current and efficiency for the SiGe solar cell, operating in a GaAsP-SiGe two-terminal configuration tandem device. A numerical model is proposed to predict the short circuit current of the SiGe cell. Experimentally, the highest short circuit current density is increased from 12.9mA/cm2 to 19.4mA/cm2, with optimized fabrication process and device structure. The efficiency of the SiGe bottom cell is improved from 1.7% to 3.0% filtered by GaAsP. It is demonstrated that the cell has potential to achieve an efficiency of 4.6% at 20suns illumination. Different mole fractions of Ge in the structure are confirmed from the X-ray diffraction line scanning image.

Abstract: The concept of bi-layer structure in photoanodes is of great importance to prepare highly efficient dye-sensitized solar cells. In this work, Hollow TiO2 (H-TiO2) NPs are successfully produced through the etching of Au NPs in Au@TiO2 core-shell NPs which were synthesized by microwave hydrothermal route. Electrophoretic deposition was utilized to make H-TiO2 NP scattering layer on the top of small sized TiO2 NPs layer. The photoanodes based on H-TiO2 NPs scattering layer showed a photoconversion efficiency of 7.58% which is much higher than that of photoanode without H-TiO2 scattering layer (6.08%). The improved photovoltaic performance is mainly due to relatively light scattering effect, more surface area for effective dye adsorption and increased light harvesting capacity of H-TiO2 NPs in the entire spectral range.

Abstract: In preparing Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) thin films, selenization at high Se pressure is likely to form a thick molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) layer. An excessively thick MoSe2 layer degrades the performance of CZTSe solar cells. Annealing under low Se pressure has been suggested to prevent the formation of such a thick MoSe2 layer. However, the potential loss of Sn metal from CZTSe thin films at low Se pressure or high temperature raises the additional difficulty of controlling the compositions and phases of the films. Carefully controlling these selenization parameters to yield high-quality CZTSe thin films is important. This study investigates the loss of Sn and the formation of molybdenum diselenide in CZTSe thin films at low Se pressure. Three-step selenization at low Se pressure is performed on an electrodeposited Cu/Sn/Zn precursor to prepare high-quality CZTSe thin films. In the first step, rapid thermal annealing with a substrate temperature of 500°C and a low Se vapor pressure of 4.6Pa was performed to reduce the loss of Sn and the thickness of the MoSe2 layer, and thus to obtain a Cu-poor and Zn-rich film. In the second step, a high annealing temperature of 570°C and an inert gas at high pressure was used to improve elemental diffusion and increase the uniformity of the elemental distribution. In the third step, thermal annealing with a substrate temperature of 500°C and a low Se vapor pressure of 4.6Pa was performed to reduce the loss of Sn and the thickness of the MoSe2 layer, and to eliminate the impurity phase of SnSe (which was formed in the second step of annealing) on the surface of the CZTS films. The loss of Sn and the formation of molybdenum diselenide in the CZTSe thin films are negligible when this three-step selenization at low Se pressure is used. When the selenization parameters are properly controlled, CZTSe solar cells with an efficiency of as high as 8.2% can be obtained.

Abstract: Glucose homeostasis is determined by insulin secretion from the ß-cells in pancreatic islets and by glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and other insulin target tissues. While glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) senses mitochondrial energy supply and regulates insulin secretion, its role in the muscle has not been elucidated. Here we investigated the possible interplay between GDH and the cytosolic energy sensing enzyme 5′-AMP kinase (AMPK), in both isolated islets and myotubes from mice and humans. The green tea polyphenol epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) was used to inhibit GDH. Insulin secretion was reduced by EGCG upon glucose stimulation and blocked in response to glutamine combined with the allosteric GDH activator BCH (2-aminobicyclo-[2,2,1] heptane-2-carboxylic acid). Insulin secretion was similarly decreased in islets of mice with ß-cell-targeted deletion of GDH (ßGlud1−/−). EGCG did not further reduce insulin secretion in the mutant islets, validating its specificity. In human islets, EGCG attenuated both basal and nutrient-stimulated insulin secretion. Glutamine/BCH-induced lowering of AMPK phosphorylation did not operate in ßGlud1−/− islets and was similarly prevented by EGCG in control islets, while high glucose systematically inactivated AMPK. In mouse C2C12 myotubes, like in islets, the inhibition of AMPK following GDH activation with glutamine/BCH was reversed by EGCG. Stimulation of GDH in primary human myotubes caused lowering of insulin-induced 2-deoxy-glucose uptake, partially counteracted by EGCG. Thus, mitochondrial energy provision through anaplerotic input via GDH influences the activity of the cytosolic energy sensor AMPK. EGCG may be useful in obesity by resensitizing insulin-resistant muscle while blunting hypersecretion of insulin in hypermetabolic states.

Abstract: Pro-inflammatory signal generated from the interaction of oxLDL with its cognate receptor LOX-1 has been attenuated successfully by a novel combination siRNA (siLOX-1Ω) targeting unique regions of Homo sapien LOX-1 mRNA. Signalling via LOX-1R was studied in a potentially pro-atherogenic arena recreated in a metabolic, pulse-chase set up. An initial pulse of oxLDL (20μg/mL;5h) was chased (without oxLDL) on a temporal scale upto 72h. Our study shows that the pro-inflammatory signal generated via oxLDL-LOX-1R interaction was mediated in two rungs, an initial sustained increase in LOX-1R expression up to 12h, and a renewal after 48h. TNF-α acted as a primary mediator of LOX-1R signalling, presumably also stimulating CD40 and MMP-9. Both TNF-α and IL-6 were involved in the second rung of LOX-1R signalling; maximum secretion of both was detected at 48h. Our study suggests a temporal sustenance of LOX-1R signalling by pro-inflammatory cytokines even on withdrawal of oxLDL. Also, siLOX-1Ω successfully abated LOX-1R expression along with its signalling intermediates, NO and NF-kB. Overall, LOX-1 signalling and the crucial role of cytokines in sustaining it is reported. Attenuation of this receptor may be of therapeutic value in atherosclerosis.

Abstract: This study reports on the beneficial effect of an absorber surface passivation by Al2O3 on the performance of Cu(In, Ga)Se2 (CIGSe) solar cells. Here the Al2O3 layer is deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) subsequently to a CdS buffer layer. It is shown that a very thin film of about 1nm efficiently reduces the interface recombination rate if the buffer layer is too thin to not fully cover the CIGSe absorber. An Al2O3 thickness of 1nm is sufficiently low to allow current transport via tunneling. Increasing the thickness to >1nm leads to a detrimental blocking behavior due to an exponentially decreasing tunnel current. Losses in open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) when reducing the buffer layer thickness are significantly mitigated by implementing an optimized Al2O3 layer. It is further shown, that the heat treatment during the ALD step results in an increase in short circuit current density (Jsc) of about 2mA/cm2. This observation is attributed to a widening of the space charge region in the CIGSe layer that in turn improves the collection probability of electrons. For not fully covering CdS layers the decrease in interface defect density by the passivation contributes as well, leading to a gain of about 5mA/cm2 for cells without a buffer. Finally, the leakage current of the solar cell devices could be reduced when applying the Al2O3 layer on insufficiently covering CdS films, which proves the capability of mitigating the effect of shunts or bad diodes.

Abstract: Intermediate reflecting layers (IRL) in multijunction solar cells improve the spectral light management and thereby increase the overall energy conversion efficiency. Nevertheless, the incorporation of an IRL can increase parasitic losses in the device mainly by three effects: (i) parasitic absorption in the IRL, (ii) increased parasitic absorption in the transparent front electrode due to the light reflection at the IRL, and (iii) reflection losses due to insufficient absorption of light in the top solar cell that is reflected at the IRL. Here, we investigate the different contributions of these three loss mechanisms on the external quantum efficiency and short-circuit current density by a combination of experiment and optical simulation. The parasitic absorption in the transparent front electrode is varied experimentally by a post-deposition laser annealing process on the front electrode layer. The experimental work is supplemented by rigorous optical simulations which allow to extract and vary the parasitic absorption losses in the IRL by a variation of the optical material properties. Furthermore, the cell reflectance is studied by experiment and simulation for different layer configurations. Our comparative study reveals that the dominating parasitic losses are absorption within the intermediate reflector and reflection out of the solar cell. From this study, we show one possible solution for advanced light management in tandem solar cells with intermediate reflectors.

Abstract: In this paper we propose a possible process simplification for pseudosquare 15.6×15.6cm2 Interdigitated Back Contact (IBC) CZ-Si solar cells. By using laser doping to create a selective BSF, one out of three diffusions and a wet etching step can be avoided, compared to a completely diffusion-based process flow. We show numerical optimization of this simplified cell structure in terms of: i) rear optics with additional SiNx capping layer, ii) contact fraction of the selective BSF. The results feature a top cell efficiency of 21.7% measured over the area of 239cm2. Further characterization implies that cells were limited mainly by: i) FF losses attributed to lateral majority carrier transport in the BSF region and increased J02 losses, ii) current loss which can be related to the BSF region.

Abstract: In this paper, we report a simple and highly reproducible strategy to fabricate a high-performance hysteresis-free organic-inorganic based perovskite solar cell (PSC). A single-step, fast deposition-crystallization method has been adopted for preparing MAPbI3 based perovskite film. The role of ethoxyethane as an anti-solvent and the importance of deposition time in film crystallization have been investigated in detail. The solvent deposition time is observed to have a significant impact on the crystal growth and performance of PSCs. Intensive characterization, which includes scanning electron microscopy, UV–visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction studies and photovoltaic characterization, has been carried out to attribute the improved performance. In addition, the influence of FK209 Co(III) complex doped in organic hole transporting material for better charge extraction and transportation in PSC has been discussed in detail. This proposed strategy, involving a co-solvent deposition time of 10s and 1.3% doping of FK209 Co (III) complex, provides a high 90% reproducible, hysteresis-free PSC with an average power conversion efficiency of 13.3% corresponding to an increment in photocurrent density (Jsc) by 31% and open circuit voltage (Voc) by 6%.

Abstract: In this study, caprylic (octanoic) acid microcapsules were synthesized with polystyrene shell material using the emulsion polymerization method. The influence of the type and concentration of the crosslinking agent on the phase-change properties of the microcapsules was examined. The structure and properties of the microcapsules have been characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). A second main contribution of this work is to investigate whether we could synthesize microcapsules with the same thermal properties during serial production. The effects of serial production on microencapsulated caprylic acid (microPCMs) have been investigated by thermal methods. The results show that reproducibility is an important parameter in the microencapsulation process. It was determined that when the synthesis amount is increased, we obtained lower efficiency in the microencapsulation of caprylic acid.

Abstract: The ionic liquids (ILs) as heat transfer fluids (HTFs) are limited for lack of strong ability in absorption of sunlight. Hence, nanoparticles are added in pure ILs to improve their thermal and optical properties. In this study, a highly stable ionic liquid nanofluid (Ionanofluid) was first prepared by dispersing SiC nanoparticles in [HMIM]BF4 and their thermophysical and optical properties were thoroughly investigated as HTFs application in direct absorption solar collectors (DACs). An enhancement in thermal properties in Ionanofluids was observed. 0.06wt% SiC Ionanofluids could increase the TC and specific heat of pure [HMIM]BF4 about 10.2% and 5% at 25°C, respectively. With the increase of temperature, the thermal properties increase, while the viscosity and density decreased. It was indicated that SiC Ionanofluids were more suitable in medium-high temperature application. Additionally the results of optical properties showed that SiC Ionanofluids were a superior solar absorption material, where the extinction coefficient of 0.03wt% SiC Ionanofluids could increase about 5.8cm−1. In summary, the advantageous performance ensured the potential of SiC Ionanofluids as advanced HTFs in solar energy system. We believed that this information have guide meaning to the practical design of DAC system.

Abstract: Proteolytic cleavage of the membrane-bound Interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) by the metalloprotease ADAM17 releases an agonistic soluble form of the IL-6R (sIL-6R), which is responsible for the pro-inflammatory trans-signaling branch of the cytokine's activities. This proteolytic step, which is also called ectodomain shedding, is critically regulated by the cleavage site within the IL-6R stalk, because mutations or small deletions within this region are known to render the IL-6R irresponsive towards proteolysis. In the present study, we employed cleavage site profiling data of ADAM17 to generate an IL-6R with increased cleavage susceptibility. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we showed that the non-prime sites P3 and P2 and the prime site P1′ were critical for this increase in proteolysis, whereas other positions within the cleavage site were of minor importance. Insertion of this optimized cleavage site into the stalk of the Interleukin-11 receptor (IL-11R) was not sufficient to enable ADAM17-mediated proteolysis, but transfer of different parts of the IL-6R stalk enabled shedding by ADAM17. These findings shed light on the cleavage site specificities of ADAM17 using a native substrate and reveal further differences in the proteolysis of IL-6R and IL-11R.

Abstract: Cu(In, Ga)Se2 (CIGS) based thin film solar cells have been extensively studied and today, power conversion efficiencies higher than 20% have been demonstrated on both rigid and flexible substrates. However, very little is known about the mechanical resistance of flexible CIGS solar cells under flexion. Here we report an original study on the mechanical properties of CIGS solar cells fabricated on 100µm-thick ultra-thin glass substrates. The Young's modulus and hardness of Mo and CIGS thin films are measured by nanoindentation, a technique well adapted to the characterization of thin film materials. Young's modulus values of 289GPa and 70GPa are obtained for the Mo and the CIGS layers respectively, as well as a CIGS hardness of 3.4GPa. These values, combined with an analytical model, allow calculating the strain induced in thin film during the flexion of solar cells fabricated on ultra-thin glass substrate as well as on polyimide substrate. Thereby, we show that using a substrate with a low thickness and a low Young's modulus enables to lower the thin films strain during the flexion of cells.

Abstract: Based on TiO2 nanoparticles (TNPs), open-ended TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNTs), and highly uniform double-shell β-NaYF4:Er3+, Yb3+@SiO2@TiO2 submicron-sized plates (NYFEY@S@T), novel triple-layered photoanodes were developed for highly efficient dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). For triple-layered photoanodes, 0-D TNPs were grown as a first layer on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate with the thickness of 6μm to create a good contact and high specific surface area for loading the greater amount of dyes. To improve the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) efficiency, the 1-D TNTs were deposited as a second layer with five different thicknesses (9, 14, 24, 32, and 46μm) due to their favorable electron transport rate. However, the photoelectric conversion efficiency of TNPs and TNTs layers is still low because of inefficiency of scattering and upconverting. Further, the 2-D NYFEY@S@T/TNPs (85% TNPs+15% NYFEY@S@T was also deposited onto the top surface of the TNTs film as a scattering and upconverting layer with the thickness of 7μm. The short-circuit current density (JSC) of 17.47mAcm–2 and an efficiency (η) of 9.11% were achieved for the DSSCs with TNPs/TNTs/NYFEY@S@T-TNPs photoanode with the TNTs layer thickness of 24μm and NYFEY@S@T content of 15wt%, which were increased significantly by 38.1% and 16.6% in comparison with that of the DSSCs with single TNPs and bilayer TNPs/TNTs photoanodes. The obtained results indicated that significant enhancement in the performance of the DSSCs with TNPs/TNTs/NYFEY@S@T-TNPs photoanode is attributed to the peculiar triple-layered structure allowing the loading of more dye molecules, good light scattering and upconverting, and longer electron lifetime.

Abstract: All-inorganic and lead-free cesium tin halides (CsSnX3, X=Cl, Br, I) are highly desirable for substituting the organolead halide perovskite solar cells. However, the poor stability of CsSnX3 perovskites has so far prevented the fabrication of devices that can withstand sustained operation under normal conditions. In this paper, a two-step sequential deposition method is developed to grow high-quality B-γ-CsSnI3 thin films and their unique phase change in atmosphere is explored in detail. We find the spontaneous oxidative conversion from unstable B-γ-CsSnI3 to air-stable Cs2SnI6 in air. Allowing the phase conversion of the CsSnI3 film to evolve in ambient air it gives the semiconducting perovskite Cs2SnI6 with a bandgap of 1.48eV and high absorption coefficient (over 105cm−1 from 1.7eV). More importantly, the Cs2SnI6 film, for the first time, is adopted as a light absorber layer for a lead-free perovskite solar cell and a preliminary estimate of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) about 1% with open-circuit voltage of 0.51V and short-circuit current of 5.41mA/cm2 is realized by optimizing the perovskite absorber thickness. According to the bandgap and the Shockley-Queisser limit, such inorganic perovskite solar cell with higher efficiency and pronounced stability can be expected by material quality improvement and device engineering.

Abstract: The development of efficient perovskite solar devices fully fabricated in air conditions at low temperature is investigated. A 10.0% average efficiency was achieved for a CH3NH3PbI3 p-i-n planar perovskite solar cell with null hysteresis processed in an environment with relative humidity as high as 70%. This result was enabled by a fine control over the perovskite precursor composition, adapting the solvent engineering process to ambient air conditions and implementing nickel oxide as hole-transporting layer. The presented strategy contributes towards the establishment of processing methodologies leading to scale up high performance perovskite solar cells where processing in ambient air at low temperature is highly desirable.

Abstract: Non-concentrating tandem solar cells offer the potential to increase conversion efficiencies beyond 30%. Of particular interest are configurations with a silicon bottom cell – to leverage existing manufacturing infrastructure – and III-V compound semiconductor top cells to combine high efficiencies with long-term stability and experience in applications. In this work we investigate the GaAs/GaAs/Si triple-junction architecture. GaAs and Si form a non-ideal bandgap combination, which poses a challenge to the current matching requirement. As band-to-band absorption in GaAs is almost two thirds of that in Si, absorption can be balanced by replacing the GaAs top junction with a GaAs/GaAs double junction. This opens up a possibility for an integrated two terminal solar cell for the GaAs-Si material system. In this study, we numerically evaluate the efficiency and energy yield potential of the GaAs/GaAs/Si triple-junction architecture. We find that, with state-of-the-art material quality, the GaAs/GaAs/Si architecture has the potential to achieve 33.0% efficiency, and harvesting efficiencies between 31.4% and 32.1%. We fabricated a GaAs/GaAs/Si four-terminal tandem solar cell with a mathematically combined efficiency of 20.4%.

Abstract: Thin (<150µm) silicon solar cell technology is attractive due to the significant cost reduction associated with it. Consequently, fracture mechanisms in the thin silicon solar cells during soldering and lamination need to be fully understood quantitatively in order to enable photovoltaics (PV) systems implementation in both manufacturing and field operations. Synchrotron X-ray Microdiffraction (µSXRD) has proven to be a very effective means to quantitatively probe the mechanical stress which is the driving force of the fracture mechanisms (initiation, propagation, and propensity) in the thin silicon solar cells, especially when they are already encapsulated. In this article, we present the first ever stress examination in encapsulated thin silicon solar cells and show how nominally the same silicon solar cells encapsulated by different polymer encapsulants could have very different residual stresses after the lamination process. It is then not difficult to see how the earlier observation, as reported by Sander et al. (2013) [1], of very different fracture rates within the same silicon solar cells encapsulated by different Ethylene Vinyl Acetate (EVA) materials could come about. The complete second degree tensor components of the residual stress of the silicon solar cells after lamination process are also reported in this paper signifying the full and unique capabilities of the Synchrotron X-Ray Microdiffraction technique not only for measuring residual stress but also for measuring other potential mechanical damage within thin silicon solar cells.

Abstract: Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a heme-degrading enzyme, is suggested to play an important role in kidney pathophysiology, mostly due to its anti-fibrotic, anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidant properties. One of the mycotoxin, ochratoxin A (OTA) was previously shown to affect HO-1 expression, however, the mechanisms of OTA-induced nephrotoxicity during HO-1 deficiency are unknown. We have shown that OTA regulates the number of pro-fibrotic, pro-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and pro-apoptotic factors in HO-1 dependent manner, as the lack of HO-1 accelerates whereas the induction of HO-1 expression by cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP) attenuates nephrotoxic effect of OTA. The down-regulation of the nuclear factor-erythroid-2- related factor 2 (Nrf2) transcription factor by OTA, observed in HO-1 knock-out animals, might be another mechanism of OTA toxicity. Moreover, HO-1 level and OTA treatment influences the expression of microRNAs. Namely, p53-regulated miR-34a and pro-fibrotic miR-21 were already increased in HO-1−/− kidneys and were further induced by OTA administration, whereas anti-fibrotic miR-29c was down-regulated by this mycotoxin. Our study indicates that complex mechanisms of OTA nephrotoxicity may be partially overcome by HO-1 induction.

Abstract: Solar receivers are one of the critical components of tower central receiver concentrated solar power plants (CSP), as this is where the light-heat conversion occurs. Better receiver designs provide higher plant efficiencies, better coupling with thermal energy storage and cost reductions. Current solar receivers are usually coated with a high sunlight absorptivity layer applied over the bare surface of the absorber receiver's tubes, in order to enhance their absorptivity and light-to-heat conversion. Here, we study the effect of the optical properties (viz. absorptivity and emissivity) of these coatings on the thermal performance of the receiver. The thermal performance of different coating candidates, solar selective and non-selective, were numerically simulated and compared against the current standard coating Pyromark 2500. Variation tendencies and the variation of the common accepted Figure of Merit (FOM) curve with temperature in different optical scenarios were also studied. Our results show that the thermal efficiency increases with the absorptivity of the coating (up to 4%). On the other hand, we observed that the emissivity has a very minor effect on the thermal performance of Molten Salt external receiver at its nominal working temperature, as the efficiency increases only by 0.6% when the emissivity of the coating decreases from 0.9 to 0.5 in a molten salts external receiver. Variation tendencies are also carefully analyzed, as well as the variation of the FOM curve with temperature in different optical scenarios for the design conditions of each receiver. At current molten salts working temperatures, improving the absorptivity of a non-selective coating leads to higher thermal efficiency than when using a selective coating. Nevertheless, for superheated steam cavity receivers, the effect of using a selective coating can be noticed at temperatures greater than 500°C. These results can be used for selecting the optimum coating type for each type of receiver, incident flux and working temperature.

Abstract: The cyclohexanone-containing fullerene mono-adduct, abbreviated as CHOC60, was efficiently prepared through single-step Diels-Alder reaction with 2-(trimethylsilyloxy)-l,3-butadiene and fullerenes. After reduction and esterification, CHOC60 was further converted into cyclohexyl acetate functional fullerene mono-adduct, named as CHAC60, which showed excellent solubility in common organic solvents. P3HT-based bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs) were fabricated through a typical structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:(CHOC60 or CHAC60)/Ca/Al. The composite ratios of P3HT and the fullerene derivatives were modified such as 1:0.5, 1:1 and 1:1.5 (w/w). The devices fabricated using CHOC60 or CHAC60 as acceptors achieved the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 2.97% and 3.15%, respectively, which exhibited comparative photovoltaic performances with commercial PC61BM. Moreover, CHOC60-based devices significantly reduced the manufacturing cost by the simplified synthesis of CHOC60 with high yield and low fullerene consumption. The non-aromatic side chain radical CHOC60 and CHAC60 provide a new idea for the design of fullerene derivative acceptors.

Abstract: Autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) is characterized by immune attacks on the person’s own thyroid. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT) is a subtype of AITD and is a common cause of hypothyroidism and related symptoms. Regulatory B (Breg) cells can express interleukin 10 (IL-10) and have recently emerged as a critical participant in suppression pathogenic inflammation and promoting peripheral tolerance. The role of Breg cells in HT is not yet clear. In this study, we first examined the IL-10 production by B cells in healthy controls and HT patients, and found that the healthy control B cells demonstrated significantly higher IL-10 expression than HT B cells after CpG stimulation. In both groups, the IL-10-producing B cells were highly enriched in the CD24+CD38+ compartment. However, compared to healthy controls, HT patients presented higher levels of circulating CD24+CD38+ B cells, but lower percentage of IL-10+ cells in the CD24+CD38+ B cell compartment. In healthy controls, we performed coculture experiments of T cells with autologous total B cells, CD24+CD38+ B cells, and non-CD24+CD38+ B cells, and found significantly lower T cell proliferation as well as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production in cell cultures containing CD24+CD38+ B cells. In contrast, the HT CD24+CD38+ B cells demonstrated reduced capacity in suppressing T cell proliferation and did not suppress TNF and IFN-γ production. This lack of inhibitory activity in HT CD24+CD38+ B cells was related to a lack of IL-10, since addition of exogenous IL-10 in CD24+CD38+ B cell-T cell coculture significantly suppressed the proliferation of T cells and reduced proinflammatory cytokine secretion. Together, our study identified an upregulation of CD24+CD38+ B cells but a downregulation in their regulatory activity in HT patients.

Abstract: Spray deposition has been demonstrated to be a promising method to prepare perovskite thin film with many advantages, such as easy and processable under fully ambient condition, which is suitable for large-scale production. In this work, we reveal two typical spray deposition process of rapid and slow solvent evaporation. It is emphasized that the rapid solvent evaporation process is essential to avoid dendritic crystal and obtain dense perovskite thin film without pin-holes, which can be realized with a suitable substrate temperature. With optimized spray conditions including flow rate of precursor solution and carrier gas pressure, a dense and uniform perovskite layer with full surface coverage was immediately formed in ~5s without any post-annealing process. The as-fabricated planar heterojunction solar cell achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.54% with 300±30nm in thickness of perovskite layer. To the best of our knowledge, this result is the highest value for the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells fabricated in air condition with high humidity up to 50%.

Abstract: Comprehensive studies were carried out to explore the thickness-dependent characteristics of thermally evaporated C60 thin films. The structural, optical, electronic and surface properties of the resultant C60 thin films were analyzed using Raman scattering spectrometry, photoluminescence spectroscopy, absorbance spectroscopy, photoelectron emission spectrometry and water droplet contact angle measurement. The experimental results show that the thickness of the C60 thin film has a decisive impact on the photovoltaic performance of CH3NH3PbI3 based solar cells in terms of open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF). In the case of the 2.5nm-thick C60 film, the solar cells have the better VOC and JSC, as the results of the lower electron affinity and higher transparency. The FF of the solar cell is related to the coverage of C60 on the transparent conductive electrode (TCE) and the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite continuity. Consequently, the photovoltaic performance can be expected to be improved by using a smooth TCE.

Abstract: In this study, ZnO/Zn2SnO4 (ZSO) composite is synthesized as a promising alternative compact layer to TiO2 by spray pyrolysis method. Owing to the ZnO/ZSO composite possesses higher carrier mobility and suitable band gap structure, it will behave well in the application of solar cells. The characterization results show that the ZnO/ZSO composite compact layer manifests better optical transmittance, enhanced electrons collective efficiency and superior electrical conductivity. Consequently, the corresponding photo-current is improved effectively when compared with that of TiO2 compact layer. The optimum efficiency of perovskite solar cell based on the ZnO/ZSO composite compact layer reaches 12.03% at AM 1.5 solar light of 100mWcm−2, which is 18% higher than that of perovskite solar cell based on the TiO2 compact layer.

Properties such as high energy density and energy storing/delivery at constant temperature bring PCM based systems in excellent candidates for DSG facility storage units. Accordingly, LiOH-KOH peritectic mixture, with a melting point of 315°C and an enthalpy change of 535kJ/kg, has been reported as attractive solution for the saturated storage module in DSG plants. A steam-PCM heat exchanger is the critical component to carry out the thermal transference between both substances. Although materials selection to be applied for steam applications is well known, lack of knowledge is detected in the field of high temperature hydroxides corrosion. Therefore, three metallic materials, A516 Gr70 carbon steel, A316L stainless steel and Inconel 625 Ni-base alloy, have been evaluated to determine their corrosion performance after hydroxides exposure. While A516 Gr70 was discarded for this application due to high corrosion rates, A316L and Inconel 625 displayed good corrosion resistance after 2640h. Finally, A316L stainless steel was selected as potential candidate for the construction of the steam-PCM heat exchanger considering cost and thermal efficiency optimization.

Abstract: Two methods were developed by using poly dopamine (PDA) or TiO2 to integrate vanadium dioxide to textile fibers. Compared with current thermoregulating textiles using solid-liquid phase change materials (PCMs), vanadium dioxide (VO2) textiles possess longer service life, no leakage and can control solar radiation continuously with changed temperatures. Through a series of equipment characterization with such as X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and tests for laundering durability, abrasion, dirt removal, thermal regulating, vapor permeability and self-cleaning performance, two kinds of VO2 textiles with excellent thermal control performance (low-power light irradiation had no obvious effects on temperature decrease; high-power irradiation could lower the temperature of about 17°C) and vapor permeability were comprehensively maintained. In addition, textile treated with (VO2@TiO2)&TiO2 multi-scale hybrid particles (VTT textile) showed super-hydrophobicity (static water contact angle was about 150°), self-cleaning properties and improved durability.

Abstract: For CdTe solar cells copper seems to be necessary to achieve best energy conversion efficiencies, whilst it is known to be the main reason of cell performance degradation due to its tendency to diffuse through the bulk. Some studies have shown a direct connection between defect concentration and copper, but little has been discussed about its relation to the CdTe etching. Within this study many samples with Cu/Au back-contact have been prepared with different etching times and tested applying thermal, luminous and electrical stresses. We have analyzed the aging effects on the cell performance and on the nature and concentration of the defects by means of a variety of characterization techniques, like atomic force microscopy, Raman, current-voltage, capacitance-voltage, drive level capacitance profiling and admittance spectroscopies. Results of the accelerated lifetime tests show that different performance degradation is observed for cells with differently etched absorber. Solar cells made with optimized etching have very low degradation while the strongest performance reduction is detected for unetched cells despite their initial efficiency is as high as for the case of etched absorbers.

Abstract: Degradation of an Inconel 601 superalloy subjected to a eutectic mixture of carbonate salt at 450°C was studied using advanced microscopy and microanalysis techniques. On the outside of the vessel, long term exposure to elevated temperature led to intergranular stress corrosion cracking via a stress assisted oxidation process. Elemental analysis verified diffusion controlled de-alloying of Ni and Cr from grain boundaries. Transmission electron microscopy showed that a (CrFeNiAl)3O4 oxide phase was formed at grain boundaries as a result of oxygen penetration. Intergranular cracking appeared due to the presence of residual stresses and microstructural heterogeneities facilitated the crack branching.

Abstract: In this paper, novel promising photoelectrochemical electrodes of CoO nanowires and cocatalyst (Ag) modified CoO nanowires are prepared and studied in photoelectrochemical water splitting exhibiting an efficient photoelectrochemical activity for the first time. Detailed growth mechanisms for CoO nanowires and CoO/Ag nanowires are discussed. The effect of Ag is investigated. The enhanced absorption spectrum and photoelectrochemical performance are characterized. The photocurrent density of CoO/Ag nanowires reaches −1.10mAcm−2 due to a high efficiency of light-harvesting, the high holes mobility via the direct pathways and increased interfacial electrons transfer of Ag nanoparticles. Such CoO-based catalysts may lead to effective photoelectrochemical activity and can be promising building blocks in photoelectrochemical water splitting systems.

Abstract: Broad-band solar thermal conversion materials are highly desired for solar energy harvesting. The purpose of this work is to demonstrate a simple and straightforward strategy to engineer broad-band solar thermal conversion nanofluids. Stable two-component nanofluids containing copper (II) oxide (CuO) and antimony doped tin oxide (ATO) nanoparticles were prepared after surface modification of the CuO nanoparticles. As a reference, the CuO nanofluids have strong absorption in the visible region but not the near-infrared region. On the contrary, the ATO nanofluids have strong absorption in the near-infrared region, but the absorption in the visible region is comparatively weak. The combination of CuO and ATO nanoparticles endows the two-component nanofluids with broad-band absorption across the visible and near-infrared region. The two-component nanofluids of 0.1vol% show an absorption spectrum match well with the solar spectrum and give a solar weighted absorption fraction of 99.6% compared to 89.5% and 89.8% for the CuO and ATO nanofluids, respectively. The solar thermal utilization efficiency of the two-component nanofluids was determined to be 92.5% compared to 81.3% and 80.7% for the CuO and ATO nanofluids, respectively. The enhanced solar thermal conversion properties of the two-component nanofluids are attributed to the complementary optical absorption of the CuO and ATO nanoparticles. This work provides a promising strategy to engineer nanofluids for solar energy harvesting.

Abstract: Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) is overexpressed in many cancers and acts as a tumor stem cell marker. Here, we investigated the role of DCLK1 and microRNA-424 (miR-424) in ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC), a histopathologically distinct subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer associated with poor prognosis and chemotherapy resistance. Analysis of samples from 30 OCCC patients showed that DCLK1 was upregulated and miR-424 was downregulated in tumors compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues. DCLK1 overexpression promoted OCCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, whereas DCLK1 knockdown reduced cell viability and invasion and induced growth arrest in vitro and in vivo. Dual-luciferase reporter assays revealed that miR-424 directly targets DCLK1 and downregulates its expression. Transfection of ES-2 cells with miR-424 mimics downregulated DCLK1 and suppressed the effects of DCLK1 overexpression on upregulating matrix metalloprotease-9 and promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Taken together, these data demonstrate that miR-424 has the capacity to suppress cell invasion and EMT in OCCC by downregulating DCLK1, suggesting potential therapeutic targets and strategies for the treatment of this disease.

Abstract: Previous study has identified the aberrant expression of LINC00657, a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), in human breast cancer. However, the expression pattern, biological function and underlying mechanism of LINC00657 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain obscure. The expression levels of LINC00657 in HCC tissues and cell lines were determined by quantitative real-time PCR. CCK-8 assay, cell colony formation assay, cell cycle analysis, Transwell assay were performed to determine whether LINC00657 could affect HCC progression. Luciferase reporter assay was used to assess the target of LINC00657. Expressions of the relevant proteins were analyzed by Western blot. Herein, we found that LINC00657 was downregulated in HCC tissue specimens as well as in malignant HCC cell lines. LINC00657 overexpression inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cells, while LINC00657 depletion promoted both cell viability and cell invasion in vitro. We also found that LINC00657 could inhibit tumor growth in vivo. Further experiments demonstrated that down-regulated LINC00657 increased the expression of miR-106a-5p. miR-106a-5p decreased the abundances of PTEN protein, while had no impact on PTEN mRNA. Moreover, we identified that both LINC00657 and PTEN mRNA were targets of miR-106a-5p by using dual-luciferase reporter assay. Our results provide the new evidence supporting the tumor-suppressive role of LINC00657 in HCC, suggesting that LINC00657 might play a role in HCC and can be a novel therapeutic target for treating HCC.

Abstract: Organo-lead-halide perovskite based solar cells have achieved remarkable advancements in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in recent years. Given their attractive properties, possible applications for perovskites are wide ranging and among others, particularly appealing for building integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs). In this study, patterned perovskite films were successfully fabricated based on a microsphere lithography SiO2 honeycomb scaffold template, which was derived by a combination of air-water interface self-assembly and O2 plasma etching. These patterned perovskite films exhibited near-neutral-color and tunable semitransparency, which meet the requisites of semitransparent solar cells for BIPVs application. O2 plasma etching of the microsphere template could effectively improve the active layer average visible transmission (AVT), and the existence of the SiO2 nanoscaffold effectively smoothed the internal trade-off of active layer AVT and device PCE. Solar cell devices fabricated with these optimized patterened perovskite films yielded a maximum PCE of 10.3% with relatively high active layer AVT of 38%. This nanoscaffold patterned perovskite opens up a new strategy for design and fabrication of functional photoelectric device based on organo-lead-halide perovskite.

Abstract: In this study, CdTe (up to 2.0µm thick) and oxygenated CdS (CdS:O, up to 100nm thick) films were deposited by magnetron sputtering and optimum conditions of film growth were investigated for CdS:O/CdTe solar cells. Favourable TeO2 has been confirmed in XRD after the CdCl2 heat treatment of the CdTe films. Moreover, improved structural, optical and electrical properties are observed in the CdCl2 heat treated films. A detailed quantitative study has also been executed using XPS that finds sulfide, sulfate and an intermediate oxide as a function of oxygen content. In many cases, CdS contribution remains predominant, however, the CdSOx contribution increases with the increase of oxygen's partial pressure and decrease of growth rate. The complete solar cell device was fabricated of various CdTe thin films with different growth rates in sputtering. A highly resistive transparent (HRT) buffer layer ZnO:Sn was placed in between the FTO and CdS:O to avoid the forward leakage problem and screen printed C:Cu/Ag is used as the back contact for low cost fabrication. The J-V characteristics and external quantum efficiency (EQE) were measured for the solar cells under the illumination of AM 1.5G and the highest efficiency of 10.3% was achieved for the optimized CdTe growth rate of 5.4Å/s, while CdS:O growth rate was 0.25Å/s.

Abstract: Thermochromic vanadium dioxide (VO2) film is a potential material for smart-window. But the high refractive index (>2) of VO2 coating in visible band resulted in strong reflection and low visible transmission. If another coating with a definite low refractive index is laid on VO2 film to construct a gradient index multilayer system, the total reflection could be effectively reduced. Therefore in this paper we designed a mesoporous SiO2/VO2 double-layer system in which the mesoporous SiO2 layer possessed an index adjustable from 1.243 to 1.354 to reduce the surface reflection of VO2-based smart window. The mesoporous structure has been investigated through several techniques including 2D GISAXS, TEM and N2 ad/desorption. More important, a facile, safe and low-cost solution method was employed to prepare VO2 film with 60nm thickness directly from ammonium citrato-oxovanadate (Ⅳ) compound that was reported by us previously. On this newly designed mesoporous SiO2/VO2 double-layer coating, the integral visible transmittance at 25°C (Tvis,L) increased to 80.0% from 69.8% of pure VO2 coating while the corresponsive integral visible transmittance at 90°C (Tvis,H) increased to 78.9% from 67.6% of pure VO2 coating, if the index of mesoporous SiO2 layer was optimized to 1.299. Simultaneously, the near infrared switching ability at 2000nm (∆T2000) reached 29.0% and solar energy modulation (∆Tsol) was maintained at 10.2%. The phase transition temperatures (Tt) for VO2 coating and the optimized SiO2/VO2 double-layer coating were 51.9°C and 53.8°C respectively, far below 68°C of bulky VO2. This optical performance should be very attractive for application in the further smart window because of little increased cost and greatly enhanced property.

Abstract: While solution processable MoOx films (S-MoOx) are typically sensitive to thermal treatment temperature and oxygen, we report an approach with the features of a wide temperature tolerance, water-free and solution-processed S-MoOx film for organic solar cells (OSCs), The structural, morphological, electronic properties of synthesized S-MoOx film were studied in detail by using field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Contact angle meter, UV–visible Spectrophotometer (UV–vis), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning kelvin probe force microscopy (SKPFM). These analysis shows that the S-MoOx thin films possess the suitable morphology and electronic properties for application in OSCs. The S-MoOx film shows wide temperature tolerance from room temperature to 250°C. The S-MoOx was introduced into OSCs in normal and inverted configuration by acting as anode interface layer. The devices shows relatively high performance (ca 7.40%) based on varying temperature treated S-MoOx. The stability of the OSCs is dramatically enhanced via using the S-MoOx layers replace the conventional PEDOT:PSS layer both in air and in nitrogen atmosphere.

Abstract: Printed photovoltaics promise lightweight and flexible light harvesting devices for conformal integration into buildings, portable electronics or vehicles. This is enabled by employing thin photoactive layers, which can reduce the use of sometimes costly and scarce absorber materials. Since this in turn comes along with an incomplete light absorption and hence restrains the power conversion efficiency of printed photovoltaics, their development was since long accompanied by integrated light management. However, besides a mere efficiency enhancement, new strategies should consider both functionality and additional costs of the light management. Optical enhancement strategies should consequently avoid complications with the delicate printing of the photovoltaic layers and therefore structures on the light incident surface of the device have been proposed. However, these air-faced approaches are prone to the impacts and stress of operating conditions and hence a protected solution is desired. Here we introduce a carefully designed photonic nanostructure embedded in a self-contained transparent film, which offers a conformal device attachment. An efficiency enhancement of 11% is demonstrated on an organic photovoltaic device. Angle dependent measurements moreover suggest a yearly increase of 13%, exploiting the seasonal asymmetry of the incident solar power by a built-in asymmetric diffraction.

Abstract: Cancer initiation and progression follow complex changes of cellular architecture and biomechanical property. Cancer cells with more submissive (or “softer”) than their healthy counterparts attributed to the reorganization of the complex cytoskeleton structure, may be considered as a potential anti-tumor therapeutic target. In this study, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was carried out to detect the topographical and biophysical changes of nasopharyngeal carcinoma CNE-2Z cells and normal nasopharyngeal epithelial cells NP69-SV40T by treating the Disulfiram chelated with Cu2+ (DSF-Cu). DSF-Cu induced the apoptotic population, ROS production and decreased the NF-κB-p65 expression of CNE-2Z cells, which was much higher than those of NP69-SV40T cells. DSF-Cu caused the obvious changes of cell morphology and membrane ultrastructure in CNE-2Z cells. The roughness decreased and stiffness increased significantly in CNE-2Z cells, which correlated with the rearrangement of intracellular F-actin, FLNa and α-tubulin structures in CNE-2Z cells. And the adhesion force of CNE-2Z cells was also increased accompanied with the increased E-cadherin expression. However, these results could not be observed in the NP69-SV40T cells even the concentration of DSF reached up to 400nM. Finally, the detection of cell wound scratch assay confirmed DSF-Cu could inhibit the migration of CNE-2Z cells, but no effect on NP69-SV40T cells. These findings demonstrated the selective cytotoxicity of DSF-Cu in CNE-2Z cells may attribute to the different mechanical properties and cytoskeleton rearrangement from the normal nasopharyngeal epithelial cells.

Abstract: Spectrally-selective solar absorber is required to be thermally stable at high operational temperature. However the currently available absorbers aren't stable beyond 700°C. Here we explore a new absorber with cermet of TiN in SiO2 on LaAlO3 substrate that can be used for long term at 700°C. The optimized cermets contain TiN with volume fraction of 60% and 65% as sun-light absorption media, SiO2 as anti-reflection coating (ARC), and tungsten (W) as infrared (IR) reflection layer. The absorbers demonstrate an absorptance higher than ~95% before annealing and ~94% after annealing at 700°C, which will be useful for especially concentrated solar applications.

Abstract: Recently we found that the deficiency of APOBEC2, a member of apoB mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like family, leads to a diminished muscle mass and increased myofiber with centrally-located nuclei known as dystrophic phenotypes. APOBEC2 expression is predominant in skeletal and cardiac muscles and elevated exclusively at the early-differentiation phase of wild-type (WT) myoblast cultures; however the physiological significance is still un-known. Here we show that APOBEC2 is a key negative regulator of myoblast differentiation in muscle regeneration. APOBEC2-knockout (A2KO) mice myoblast cultures displayed a normal morphology of primary myotubes along with earlier increase in fusion index and higher expression levels of myosin heavy chain (MyHC), myogenin and its cooperating factor MEF2C than WT myoblasts. Similar response was observable in APOBEC2-knockdown cultures of WT myoblasts that were transfected with the specific siRNA at the differentiation phase (not proliferation phase). Importantly, cardiotoxin-injured A2KO gastrocnemius muscle provided in vivo evidence by showing larger up-regulation of neonatal MyHC and myogenin and hence earlier regeneration of myofiber structures with diminished cross-sectional areas and minimal Feret diameters. Therefore, the findings highlight a promising role for APOBEC2 in normal progression of regenerative myogenesis at the early-differentiation phase upon muscle injury.

Abstract: This work investigates the impact of opto-electronical buffer (b) and high resistive window layer (w) properties, i.e. band gap Eg(b,w) and electron affinity χe(b,w), on the device performance of chalcopyrite CuIn1−xGaxSe2 (CIGS) solar cells by numerical simulations with SCAPS. We established an initial device model based on an experimental device and its J–V, C–V, and EQE data at room temperature as well as its quantified depth profile for the [Ga]/([Ga]+[In]) ratio (GGI). The device features a non-uniform CIGS doping profile as well as a strongly doped CIGS surface layer. Based on our simulations that include various buffer layer materials, we argue that the most suitable buffer and window layer is Zn1−zMgzO. The potential gain in efficiency is up to 0.9% absolute which corresponds to a relative gain of 4.1%.

Abstract: The expression of mitochondrially-encoded genes requires the efficient processing of long precursor RNAs at the 5′ and 3′ ends of tRNAs, a process which, when disrupted, results in disease. Two such mutations reside within mt-tRNALeu(UUR); a m.3243A>G transition, which is the most common cause of MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes), and m.3302A>G which often causes mitochondrial myopathy (MM). We used parallel analysis of RNA ends (PARE) that captures the 5′ terminal end of 5′-monophosphorylated mitochondrial RNAs to compare the effects of the m.3243A>G and m.3302A>G mutations on mitochondrial tRNA processing and downstream RNA metabolism. We confirmed previously identified RNA processing defects, identified common internal cleavage sites and new sites unique to the m.3243A>G mutants that do not correspond to transcript ends. These sites occur in regions of predicted RNA secondary structure, or are in close proximity to such regions, and may identify regions of importance to the processing of mtRNAs.

Abstract: Hybrid organic-inorganic solar cells of the configuration ITO/InSe/TCVA/Au have been fabricated using thermal evaporation technique. The electrical transport mechanisms of the manufactured cell were studied by performing the capacitance-voltage (C-V) and the current density-voltage (J-V) estimations. The TCVA/InSe cell displayed rectifying behavior with a rectification ratio of 157 at ±1V. At the lower voltages, the dark current density, J, is ruled by the thermionic emission instrument. While a space charge-limited-conduction mechanism was operated at a higher voltage. The fabricated cell demonstrates a significant improvement in the short circuit photocurrent density and the fill factor by including InSe layer, leading to nearly a nine-fold improvement in the conversion efficiency. The temperature dependent on photovoltaic parameters was also investigated in the temperature range of 303–373K. It found that the power conversion efficiency was increased with the increasing temperature.

Abstract: Graphene films were synthesized and characterized to demonstrate their potential applications as the transparent electrodes in photovoltaic devices. Graphene films were prepared by chemical vapor deposition of graphene on copper substrates followed by transferring them onto the desired substrates. The quality and uniformity of graphene transferred onto different substrates were characterized by Raman spectroscopy and UV–VIS–NIR reflectance as well as transmission spectroscopy. The results showed that the films synthesized contained 1–3 layers of graphene with the sheet resistance and optical transparency in the ranges of 50–350 Ω/sq and 85–95%, respectively. Thin films of cadmium sulfide (CdS) were deposited on different substrates by chemical bath deposition method to study the optoelectronic behavior at the interface of graphene/CdS. The results showed that transient response time and the magnitude of photocurrent were enhanced by the graphene electrodes. The order of photocurrent merit was found to be CdS/graphene /Glass >CdS/ITO/glass, indicating that the CdS/graphene stack is to be the most efficient electron transport matrix for the separation of photo excited carriers in the CdS films.

Abstract: The colour rendering index (CRI) and correlated colour temperature (CCT) of daylight change upon transmission through a variable transmittance suspended particle device (SPD) switchable glazing. The luminous transmittance of SPD glazing was found to vary from 0.02 to 0.55 in opaque and transparent state respectively. Below 0.14 transmittance, the CRI for a particular SPD glazing was less than 80. No strong correlation was found between CCT and CRI. The CRI of SPD glazing in a transparent state was similar to double panes glazing for SPD glazing transmittance greater than 0.24.

Abstract: A record-high efficiency of 16.92% was realized by using microscale-patterned Si solar cells. Si microwire (SiMW) solar cells were designed to compare their performances with the standard flat-Si solar cell. The diameter and period of SiMWs were tuned to investigate the effects on the operation and the electrical properties of the solar cells. The highest efficiency SiMW solar cell has a width of 1.57µm to provide the significantly enhanced efficiency of 16.92% from 10.15% of the flat-Si solar cell, due to the improved values of open circuit voltage (608mV), short circuit current density (36.47mA/cm2) and fill factor (76.29%). Impedance spectroscopy and capacitance-voltage studies were carried out to obtain series and shunt resistances, built-in potential, acceptor carrier density, depletion width and flat band potential. Optical properties of SiMW solar cells were analyzed by external and internal quantum efficiencies. The carrier lifetime was measured by using open circuit voltage decay technique. Systematic analyses were performed to reveal the optical and electrical features of SiMW solar cells. These findings may provide efficient design schemes for high-performing solar cells using structured platforms.

Methylene blue increases the amount of HSF1 through promotion of PKA-mediated increase in HSF1-p300 interaction,

Abstract: Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) critically contributes to the host defense, and its amount determines the mobilization efficiency of HSF1 under stress conditions. To date, how HSF1 amount is regulated remains largely unknown. We found that methylene blue (MB), an anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory agent, increased the amount of HSF1 in BV-2 microglia, primary microglia, astrocytes, neurons and vital organs. The increased HSF1 contributed to a more increase in nuclear translocation of HSF1, association of HSF1 with heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) promoters and Hsp70 expression levels, and also induced a synergistic protection against oxidative stress-induced injuries in MB and heat shock-treated cells. The MB-induced increase in the amount of HSF1 was not associated with light exposition as well as the change in HSF1 gene transcription or macroautophagy, but associated with the proteasome-ubiquitin system. The acetyltransferase p300 was considered to mediate the effect of MB on HSF1, as p300 inhibition or silencing prevented the increase in HSF1-p300 interaction as well as the amount and acetylation level of HSF1 in MB-treated cells. Moreover, inhibition of protein kinase A α (PKAα) was found to attenuate the MB-induced increase in HSF1 amount and HSF1-p300 interaction. These findings were ascertained in primary microglia, astrocytes and neurons where p300 or PKA inhibition prevented the increase in the amount of HSF1 after MB treatment. Taken together, our results showed that MB increases the amount of HSF1 through promotion of PKA-mediated increase in HSF1-p300 interaction, providing evidence to illustrate a new pharmacological effect of MB in clinical application.

Abstract: This study presents a rigorous modeling approach for 1D microstructured absorbing multi-layers for Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) receivers, taking into account both the absorption of the incident solar energy as well as the emissivity for the desired receiver temperature. Based on an optimized multilayer structure achieving high absorption, the authors demonstrate that 1D sub-wavelength period gratings can further increase the absorption and thus the efficiency of the CSP system. The C-method (Chandezon Method) is used to theoretically optimize the 1D grating profiles. An experimental demonstration of the combination of lithographic grating fabrication and absorptive layer deposition using standard silicon wafers as substrates is also presented. Experimental results show 96.5% absorption in the visible and UV range, representing an enhancement of almost 2% in comparison to non-structured coatings. Those results are promising for the design of future and competitive solar absorbers for CSP, especially since the microstructure fabrication approach can be applied to non-planar substrates such as tubes typically used as receivers in CSP plants.

Abstract: Objective/Background
From clinical and biological points of view, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by a progressive accumulation of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood, bone marrow, and lymphoid organs. New prognostic markers in CLL may be useful to clinicians for predicting outcome and in clinical decision-making. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential prognostic value of the apoptotic/survival-controlling proteins and protein tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 gene expression in CLL patients and control individuals, correlating such findings with patients’ clinical data.
Methods
Fifty-three patients diagnosed with CLL attending the hematology service of a clinical hospital, and 24 healthy individuals with no history of leukemia (Control group) were enrolled in this study. Analyses of apoptotic/survival-controlling proteins were performed by western blot and ZAP-70 gene expression was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
Results
Significant differences were observed for the p-p38, Mcl-1 long, and Mcl-1 short proteins when patients were compared with CLL and controls. A positive correlation between the results for Mcl-1 short and Mcl-1 long and lymphocyte count was observed, corroborating the hypothesis of an imbalance between proteins of cell survival pathways/apoptosis in CLL.
Conclusion
ZAP-70 gene expression was not detected as a discriminant biomarker in these CLL patients. An imbalance between apoptosis-related proteins was observed in the present study, corroborating the hypothesis of increased survival of lymphocytes in CLL patients.

Abstract: A suspended particle device (SPD) switchable glazing changes its state from opaque to transparent in the presence of a power supply. SPD glazing's near normal transmission varies with incident angle and clearness index. Due to a lower diffuse component, higher glazing transmission ensues at higher clearness indices. Transmittance values for different azimuthal incident angle for a SPD glazing for its “transparent” and “opaque” states have been determined. In Dublin, below 0.5 clearness index, isotropic diffuse transmittance was prevailed while transmission of direct insolation was dominant above 0.5 clearness index. For south facing vertical plane SPD glazing transmittance in its transparent and opaque states are 0.25 and 0.025 respectively while clearness index is below 0.5.

Abstract: The application of a redox electrolyte in hybrid type electrochromic devices allows a high charge capacity, thereby a high optical contrast can be achieved. However, the current between the redox electrolyte and the electrochromic layer (tungsten oxide, WO3) interface in equilibrium at colored state of device is critical for a window with large area. This loss current should be maintained below 10μA/cm2 to avoid an inhomogeneous coloration of a large window caused by an ohmic voltage drop in transparent conductive oxide (TCO). The power consumption of such a loss current can be neglected. In this regard, we have investigated silicon nitride (Si3N4) and silicon oxide (SiO2) films as an intermediate electronic barrier layer on the top of the WO3 with thicknesses of 12, 35, 80 and 180nm. These films were coated by direct current reactive magnetron sputtering technique. The electron barrier properties were studied for the iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) and tetramethylthiourea/tetramethylformaminium disulfide dication (TMTU/TMFDS2+) redox couples for application in electrochromic devices. For both redox couples, Si3N4 showed an effective electronic barrier layer. The thickness of 80nm of Si3N4 reduced the loss current from 240 down to 20μA/cm2 for the I−/I3− redox electrolyte with the visual (solar) transmission from 45% (33%)down to 0.7% (0.5%)at 1V.Similarly, the loss current was reduced from 70 down to 7μA/cm2with the visual (solar) transmission from 71% (54.5%) down to 3% (2%) for TMTU/TMFDS2+ redox electrolyte. However no significant reduction of loss circuit current was achieved with SiO2 barrier layer for both redox couples.

Abstract: Concentrating solar power is a promising technique for future energy supply. The currently used heat transfer fluid in those power plants is a eutectic mixture of biphenyl and diphenylether. This mixture limits the maximum operating temperature of a concentration solar power plant due to occurring degradation. Polysiloxanes are a promising substitution as heat transfer fluid due to their good resistance towards high temperatures. Nevertheless, those polymers are subjected to a thermally induced equilibration reaction which leads to an alternation in the physical properties. In our study we could demonstrate, based on chosen model compounds, that branched siloxanes have a remarkable resistance against thermal equilibration reaction.

Abstract: A new graphene aerosol hybridized CdO/SnO2 (CdO/SnO2/GA) heterostructure is fabricated for visible photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants. Firstly, CdO/SnO2 heteronanostructure is prepared by solid-state conversion of a nano coordination polymer. Then, the prepared CdO/SnO2 material is hybridized with graphene oxide under hydrothermal condition to get the CdO/SnO2/GA hybrid. The CdO/SnO2/GA hybrid is successfully characterized by powdered X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy and UV–Visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. It is observed that CdO/SnO2/GA exhibits improvement in visible light photocatalytic activity towards degradation of dyes compared to pure CdO/SnO2, GA or earlier reported SnO2/graphene based hybrids. The enhanced photocatalytic activity can be ascribed by synergistic effect of CdO, SnO2 and graphene, and also for higher surface area and porous nature of the graphene aerosol and effective charge separation in the CdO/SnO2/GA. Importantly, graphene and dye are also acting as the co-photosensitizer with CdO/SnO2 absorbing more visible light and enhancing charge separations. Furthermore, the CdO/SnO2/GA hybrid exhibits high photo-stability up to five cycles without any photo-corrosion implying its potential applications for environmental remediation.

Abstract: Objective/background
Here, we described the clinical characteristics and outcomes of central nervous system (CNS) infections occurring after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in a single institution over the previous 6 years.
Methods
Charts of 353 consecutive allogeneic transplant recipients were retrospectively reviewed for CNS infection.
Results
A total of 17 cases of CNS infection were identified at a median of 38 days (range, 10–1028 days) after allo-HSCT. Causative pathogens were human herpesvirus-6 (n=6), enterococcus (n=2), staphylococcus (n=2), streptococcus (n=2), varicella zoster virus (n=1), cytomegalovirus (n=1), John Cunningham virus (n=1), adenovirus (n=1), and Toxoplasma gondii (n=1). The cumulative incidence of CNS infection was 4.1% at 1 year and 5.5% at 5 years.
Conclusion
Multivariate analysis revealed that high-risk disease status was a risk factor for developing CNS infection (p=.02), and that overall survival at 3 years after allo-HSCT was 33% in patients with CNS infection and 53% in those without CNS infection (p=.04).

Abstract: Ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR) transfers reducing equivalents between ferredoxin and NADP(H) in the photosynthetic electron transport chains of chloroplasts and cyanobacteria. In most cyanobacteria, FNR is coded by a single petH gene. The structure of FNR in photosynthetic organisms can be constituted by FAD-binding and NADPH-binding domains (FNR-2D), or by these and an additional N-terminal domain (FNR-3D). In this article, biochemical evidence is provided supporting the induction of FNR-2D by iron or combined nitrogen deficiency in the cyanobacteria Synechocystis PCC 6803 and Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413. In cell extracts of these cyanobacteria, most of FNR was associated to phycobilisomes (PBS) or phycocyanin (PC), and the rest was found as free enzyme. Free FNR activity increased in both cyanobacteria under iron stress and during diazotrophic conditions in A. variabilis. Characterization of FNR from both cyanobacteria showed that the PBS-associated enzyme was FNR-3D and the free enzyme was mostly a FNR-2D isoform. Predominant isoforms in heterocysts of A. variabilis were FNR-2D; where its N-terminal sequence lacked an initial (formyl)methionine. This means that FNR-3D is targeted to thylakoid membrane, and anchored to PBS, and FNR-2D is found as a soluble protein in the cytoplasm, when iron or fixed nitrogen deficiencies prevail in the environment. Moreover, given that Synechocystis and Anabaena variabilis are dissimilar in genotype, phenotype and ecology, the presence of these two-domain proteins in these species suggests that the mechanism of FNR induction is common among cyanobacteria regardless of their habitat and morphotype.

Abstract: We examine the defect activation kinetics in block-cast high-performance multicrystalline silicon (HP mc-Si) under illumination at elevated temperature. Our lifetime analysis shows that the observed light-induced lifetime degradation consists of two separate stages: a fast stage followed by a slow stage. Our experiments reveal that both degradation stages can be fitted using a sum of two exponential decay functions. The resulting degradation rate constants depend both on the temperature and the light intensity applied during degradation. For the fast component, we determine an activation energy of (0.89 ± 0.04)eV from an Arrhenius plot of the degradation rate and for the slow component we determine a value of (0.94 ± 0.06)eV. The activation energies are relatively large, leading to a very pronounced dependence of the degradation rates on temperature. We also observe that both degradation rates show a linear dependence on the applied light intensity during degradation in the examined intensity range between 0.25 and 1.5 suns.

Abstract: We report the controlled preparation of water processable nanoparticles (NPs) employing the push-pull polymer PCDTBT and the fullerene acceptor PC71BM in order to enable solar cell processing using eco-friendly solvent (i.e. water). The presented method provides the possibility to separate the formation of the active layer blend and the deposition of the active layer into two different processes. For the first time, the benefits of aqueous processability for the high-potential class of push-pull polymers, generally requiring high boiling solvents, are made accessible. With our method we demonstrate excellent control over the blend stoichiometry and efficient mixing. Furthermore, we provide visualization of the nanomorphology of the different NPs to obtain structural information down to ~2nm resolution using advanced analytical electron microscopy. The imaging directly reveals very small compositional demixing in the PCDTBT:PC71BM blend NPs, in the size range of about <5nm, indicating fine mixing at the molecular level. The suitability of the proposed methodology and materials towards the aspects of eco-friendly processing of organic solar cells is demonstrated through a processing of lab scale NPs solar cell prototypes reaching a power conversion efficiency of 1.9%.

Abstract: Adopting DC reactive magnetron sputtering technique, PbO film was fabricated on FTO-glass substrate coated with a nanocrystalline rutile titania (NRT) by using a pure metallic lead target in an Ar/O2 mixture. Then the as-prepared PbO film was converted to CH3NH3PbI3 through the sequential reactions occurred in isopropanol solution of CH3NH3I. The as-prepared perovskite film exhibits a surface morphology of high uniformity and good coverage over a large scale; the crystal grains reach the size of up to 600nm, which is beneficial for enhancing light absorption and decreasing grain boundary. The solar cells with a structure of FTO/NRT/CH3NH3PbI3/Spiro-MeOTAD/Au were fabricated, where NRT was employed as the contact layer of the photovoltaic devices. Our champion cells with active area of 0.09cm2 and 1.07cm2 achieve the highest power conversion efficiency of 14.1% and 10.7%, respectively, under the standard AM 1.5 conditions. The present approach is competent for the fabrication of large area perovskite solar cells with the advantages of easy control, cost-saving, and less use of toxic reagents, and thus with potential applications.

Abstract: A simple and effective strategy was used to fundamentally improve the performance of a heterostructured Ni(OH)2/CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2 photoanode. TiO2 nanorods grown hydrothermally on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) and annealed at 500°C yielded an optimal photocurrent density of ~988μAcm–2 at 0.1V vs. Ag/AgCl under simulated illumination conditions. The annealing process minimized the defects in TiO2 and assisted in the formation of close contacts between the FTO and TiO2 nanorods, which allowed for efficient electron transport. The stepwise introduction of ZnIn2S4 and CdS on annealed TiO2 enhanced absorption in the visible range and electron/hole separation in CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2. Additionally, the Ni(OH)2 cocatalyst functioned in hole trapping and improved the stability of the photoelectrode through timely consumption of the photogenerated charges, particularly the holes.
