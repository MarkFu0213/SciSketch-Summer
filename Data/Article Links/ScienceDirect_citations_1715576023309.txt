Abstract: Summary
The intestinal epithelium has a high turnover rate and constantly renews itself through proliferation of intestinal crypt cells, which depends on insufficiently characterized signals from the microenvironment. Here, we showed that colonic macrophages were located directly adjacent to epithelial crypt cells in mice, where they metabolically supported epithelial cell proliferation in an mTORC1-dependent manner. Specifically, deletion of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (Tsc2) in macrophages activated mTORC1 signaling that protected against colitis-induced intestinal damage and induced the synthesis of the polyamines spermidine and spermine. Epithelial cells ingested these polyamines and rewired their cellular metabolism to optimize proliferation and defense. Notably, spermine directly stimulated proliferation of colon epithelial cells and colon organoids. Genetic interference with polyamine production in macrophages altered global polyamine levels in the colon and modified epithelial cell proliferation. Our results suggest that macrophages act as “commensals” that provide metabolic support to promote efficient self-renewal of the colon epithelium.

Abstract: Summary
Macrophages play a pivotal role in tumor immunity. We report that reprogramming of macrophages to tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) promotes the secretion of exosomes. Mechanistically, increased exosome secretion is driven by MADD, which is phosphorylated by Akt upon TAM induction and activates Rab27a. TAM exosomes carry high levels of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and potently suppress the proliferation and function of CD8+ T cells. Analysis of patient melanoma tissues indicates that TAM exosomes contribute significantly to CD8+ T cell suppression. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis showed that exosome-related genes are highly expressed in macrophages in melanoma; TAM-specific RAB27A expression inversely correlates with CD8+ T cell infiltration. In a murine melanoma model, lipid nanoparticle delivery of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting macrophage RAB27A led to better T cell activation and sensitized tumors to anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) treatment. Our study demonstrates tumors use TAM exosomes to combat CD8 T cells and suggests targeting TAM exosomes as a potential strategy to improve immunotherapies.

Abstract: Summary
Brain cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in children. Somatic structural variations (SVs), large-scale alterations in DNA, remain poorly understood in pediatric brain tumors. Here, we detect a total of 13,199 high-confidence somatic SVs in 744 whole-genome sequences of pediatric brain tumors from the Pediatric Brain Tumor Atlas. The somatic SV occurrences have tremendous diversity among the cohort and across different tumor types. We decompose mutational signatures of clustered complex SVs, non-clustered complex SVs, and simple SVs separately to infer their mutational mechanisms. Our finding of many tumor types carrying unique sets of SV signatures suggests that distinct molecular mechanisms shape genome instability in different tumor types. The patterns of somatic SV signatures in pediatric brain tumors are substantially different from those in adult cancers. The convergence of multiple SV signatures on several major cancer driver genes implies vital roles of somatic SVs in disease progression.

Abstract: Objective
Luminal-B type human breast cancer cell line (BT-474) to assess the synergistic effects of ozone applied after chemotherapeutic treatment with various dosages of doxorubicin, and compare the results with the effects on L929 fibroblast cell line.
Methods
Doxorubicin (1–50 M) was added to each cell lines and left to sit for 24 h at 37 °C. Then, as combination groups, half of the groups were incubated with 30 g/mL ozone for 25 min. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), and matrix metalloproteinase-2 and − 9 (MMP-2 and MMP-9) levels were measured using the MTT test, flow cytometry, and immunocytochemistry, respectively.
Results
When compared to simply doxorubicin-applied cells without ozone treatment, each dose of doxorubicin + ozone treatment considerably boosted L929 viability but significantly decreased BT-474 viability. Additionally, the combination increased the apoptotic impact of doxorubicin on BT-474 but not L929 (P < 0.001). TGF-, MMP-2, and MMP-9 levels of L929 after combination were substantially higher than those of the other groups (P < 0.01). Doxorubicin's effect on BT-474's protein levels, which had significantly decreased in comparison to those of the other groups, was reversed by the combination treatment (P < 0.05).
Conclusion
Doxorubicin's anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects were enhanced by ozone treatment in BT-474 cells, but it also repaired and healed healthy fibroblast cells that had been harmed by the cytotoxicity of the chemotherapy drug. If doxorubicin and ozone treatment are coupled, BT-474 cells may develop resistance to it through expressions of TNF-α, TGF-β, MMP-2, and MMP-9.

Abstract: Summary
The amygdala, cholinergic basal forebrain, and higher-order auditory cortex (HO-AC) regulate brain-wide plasticity underlying auditory threat learning. Here, we perform multi-regional extracellular recordings and optical measurements of acetylcholine (ACh) release to characterize the development of discriminative plasticity within and between these brain regions as mice acquire and recall auditory threat memories. Spiking responses are potentiated for sounds paired with shock (CS+) in the lateral amygdala (LA) and optogenetically identified corticoamygdalar projection neurons, although not in neighboring HO-AC units. Spike- or optogenetically triggered local field potentials reveal enhanced corticofugal—but not corticopetal—functional coupling between HO-AC and LA during threat memory recall that is correlated with pupil-indexed memory strength. We also note robust sound-evoked ACh release that rapidly potentiates for the CS+ in LA but habituates across sessions in HO-AC. These findings highlight a distributed and cooperative plasticity in LA inputs as mice learn to reappraise neutral stimuli as possible threats.

Abstract: Summary
Maintaining healthy adipose tissue is crucial for metabolic health, requiring a deeper understanding of adipocyte development and response to high-calorie diets. This study highlights the importance of TET3 during white adipose tissue (WAT) development and expansion. Selective depletion of Tet3 in adipose precursor cells (APCs) reduces adipogenesis, protects against diet-induced adipose expansion, and enhances whole-body metabolism. Transcriptomic analysis of wild-type and Tet3 knockout (KO) APCs unveiled TET3 target genes, including Pparg and several genes linked to the extracellular matrix, pivotal for adipogenesis and remodeling. DNA methylation profiling and functional studies underscore the importance of DNA demethylation in gene regulation. Remarkably, targeted DNA demethylation at the Pparg promoter restored its transcription. In conclusion, TET3 significantly governs adipogenesis and diet-induced adipose expansion by regulating key target genes in APCs.

Abstract: Summary
Newly synthesized proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are sorted by coat protein complex II (COPII) at the ER exit site en route to the Golgi. Under cellular stresses, COPII proteins become targets of regulation to control the transport. Here, we show that the COPII outer coat proteins Sec31 and Sec13 are selectively sequestered into the biomolecular condensate of SCOTIN/SHISA-5, which interferes with COPII vesicle formation and inhibits ER-to-Golgi transport. SCOTIN is an ER transmembrane protein with a cytosolic intrinsically disordered region (IDR), which is required and essential for the formation of condensates. Upon IFN-γ stimulation, which is a cellular condition that induces SCOTIN expression and condensation, ER-to-Golgi transport was inhibited in a SCOTIN-dependent manner. Furthermore, cancer-associated mutations of SCOTIN perturb its ability to form condensates and control transport. Together, we propose that SCOTIN impedes the ER-to-Golgi transport through its ability to form biomolecular condensates at the ER membrane.

Abstract: Summary
The stomach is an important digestive organ with various biological functions. However, because of the complexity of its cellular and glandular composition, its precise cellular biology has yet to be elucidated. In this study, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and subcellular-level spatial transcriptomics analysis of the human stomach and constructed the largest dataset to date: a stomach encyclopedia. This dataset consists of approximately 380,000 cells from scRNA-seq and the spatial transcriptome, enabling integrated analyses of transcriptional and spatial information of gastric and metaplastic cells. This analysis identified LEFTY1 as an uncharacterized stem cell marker, which was confirmed through lineage tracing analysis. A wide variety of cell-cell interactions between epithelial and stromal cells, including PDGFRA+BMP4+WNT5A+ fibroblasts, was highlighted in the developmental switch of intestinal metaplasia. Our extensive dataset will function as a fundamental resource in investigations of the stomach, including studies of development, aging, and carcinogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Hematologic toxicity is a common side effect of multimodal cancer therapy. Nearly all animal studies investigating the causes of radiotherapy-induced hematologic toxicity use inbred strains with limited genetic diversity and do not reflect the diverse responses observed in humans. We used the population-based Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse resource to investigate the genetic architecture of the acute and persistent immune response after radiation exposure by measuring 22 immune parameters in 1,720 CC mice representing 35 strains. We determined relative acute and persistent radiation resistance scores at the individual strain level considering contributions from all immune parameters. Genome-wide association analysis identified quantitative trait loci associated with baseline and radiation responses. A cross-species radiation resistance score predicted recurrence-free survival in medulloblastoma patients. We present a community resource of immune parameters and genome-wide association analyses before and after radiation exposure for future investigations of the contributions of host genetics on radiosensitivity.

Abstract: Summary
The paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) projects axons to multiple areas, mediates a wide range of behaviors, and exhibits regional heterogeneity in both functions and axonal projections. Still, questions regarding the cell types present in the PVT and the extent of their differences remain inadequately addressed. We applied single-cell RNA sequencing to depict the transcriptomic characteristics of mouse PVT neurons. We found that one of the most significant variances in the PVT transcriptome corresponded to the anterior-posterior axis. While the single-cell transcriptome classified PVT neurons into five types, our transcriptomic and histological analyses showed continuity among the cell types. We discovered that anterior and posterior subpopulations had nearly non-overlapping projection patterns, while another population showed intermediate patterns. In addition, these subpopulations responded differently to appetite-related neuropeptides, with their activation showing opposing effects on food consumption. Our studies unveiled the contrasts and the continuity of PVT neurons that underpin their function.

Abstract: Summary
Emerging studies have addressed the tumor-promoting role of fructose in different cancers. The effects and pathological mechanisms of high dietary fructose on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. Here, we examined the effects of fructose supplementation on HCC progression in wild-type C57BL/6 mice using a spontaneous and chemically induced HCC mouse model. We show that elevated uridine diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) and O-GlcNAcylation levels induced by high dietary fructose contribute to HCC progression. Non-targeted metabolomics and stable isotope tracing revealed that under fructose treatment, microbiota-derived acetate upregulates glutamine and UDP-GlcNAc levels and enhances protein O-GlcNAcylation in HCC. Global profiling of O-GlcNAcylation revealed that hyper-O-GlcNAcylation of eukaryotic elongation factor 1A1 promotes cell proliferation and tumor growth. Targeting glutamate-ammonia ligase or O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT) remarkably impeded HCC progression in mice with high fructose intake. We propose that high dietary fructose promotes HCC progression through microbial acetate-induced hyper-O-GlcNAcylation.

Abstract: Levofloxacin (LEV) is one of the Fluoroquinolones antibiotic groups, which are utilized in the therapy of numerous diseases, particularly in reproductive organs. Punica granatum peel is a waste byproduct rich in phytochemicals that are known for their different biological activities. The current research was designed to assess the capability of pomegranate peel extract (PGPE) in counteracting LEV-induced oxidative stress and testicular injury in rats. Rats groups were divided as follows: control, PGPE (500 mg/kg BW), LEV (300 mg/kg BW), and PGPE plus LEV. Rats were treated orally for two weeks daily. The chemical and nutritional content of Punica granatum peel (PGP) were investigated. GC/MS analysis showed the major phytochemical constituents in PGPE as gallic acid, ellagic acid, 4H-Pyran-4-one, 2,3-dihydro-3,5-dihydroxy-6-methyl, and caffeic acid with DPPH, ABTS, and NO radical scavenging activity, as well as Fe3+- reducing antioxidant activity. Results revealed that LEV increased TBARS and H2O2 concentrations and LDH activity in rat testes significantly. While the activities of antioxidant enzymes, phosphatases, aminotransferases, and reduced glutathione content as well as protein levels, were significantly reduced. Worthy changes in testosterone, luteinizing, and follicle-stimulating hormone levels, as well as sperm characteristics, were also discovered. LEV was also found to trigger apoptosis, as evidenced by elevated p53 and caspase-3 levels and decreased Bcl2 levels. Furthermore, alterations in histological and immunohistochemical PCNA expression were observed in rat testes, confirming the biochemical findings. Furthermore, PGPE pretreatment of LEV-treated rats restored the majority of the tested parameters when compared to the LEV-treated group. In conclusion, pomegranate peel extract had a powerful modulating role against the adverse effects of levofloxacin in rat testes and represents a perspective of the utilization of food waste by-products.

Abstract: Summary
The human ataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase functions in the nucleus to protect genomic integrity. Micronuclei (MN) arise from genomic and chromosomal instability and cause aneuploidy and chromothripsis, but how MN are removed is poorly understood. Here, we show that ATR is active in MN and promotes their rupture in S phase by phosphorylating Lamin A/C at Ser395, which primes Ser392 for CDK1 phosphorylation and destabilizes the MN envelope. In cells harboring MN, ATR or CDK1 inhibition reduces MN rupture. Consequently, ATR inhibitor (ATRi) diminishes activation of the cytoplasmic DNA sensor cGAS and compromises cGAS-dependent autophagosome accumulation in MN and clearance of micronuclear DNA. Furthermore, ATRi reduces cGAS-mediated senescence and killing of MN-bearing cancer cells by natural killer cells. Thus, in addition to the canonical ATR signaling pathway, an ATR-CDK1-Lamin A/C axis promotes MN rupture to clear damaged DNA and cells, protecting the genome in cell populations through unexpected cell-autonomous and cell-non-autonomous mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
Calcium (Ca2+) signaling is tightly regulated within a presynaptic bouton. Here, we visualize Ca2+ signals within hippocampal presynaptic boutons using GCaMP8s tagged to synaptobrevin, a synaptic vesicle protein. We identify evoked presynaptic Ca2+ transients (ePreCTs) that derive from synchronized voltage-gated Ca2+ channel openings, spontaneous presynaptic Ca2+ transients (sPreCTs) that originate from ryanodine sensitive Ca2+ stores, and a baseline Ca2+ signal that arises from stochastic voltage-gated Ca2+ channel openings. We find that baseline Ca2+, but not sPreCTs, contributes to spontaneous glutamate release. We employ photobleaching as a use-dependent tool to probe nano-organization of Ca2+ signals and observe that all three occur in non-overlapping domains within the synapse at near-resting conditions. However, increased depolarization induces intermixing of these Ca2+ domains via both local and non-local synaptic vesicle turnover. Our findings reveal nanosegregation of Ca2+ signals within a presynaptic terminal that derive from multiple sources and in turn drive specific modes of neurotransmission.

Abstract: Summary
Sequestration of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes (IEs) in the brain microcirculation is a hallmark of cerebral malaria (CM), which leads to endothelial activation, brain swelling, and death. Here, we probed CM inflammation in a perfusable 3D human brain microvessel model. 3D brain microvessels supported in vivo-like capacities for parasite binding and maturation in situ, leading to a distinct inflammatory response from the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). By combining transcriptional analysis, imaging, and leukocyte perfusion, we showed that whereas TNF-α promotes a reversible inflammatory phenotype with widespread leukocyte recruitment, parasites induce unique stress response pathways and cause localized cell adhesivity changes, focal endothelial disruptions, and apoptosis. Furthermore, parasites modified the temporal kinetics of the TNF transcriptional response, suggesting augmented inflammatory damage with the two sequential stimuli. Our findings offer mechanistic insights into CM biology in a 3D brain microvessel mimetic platform and suggest that multiple events intersect to promote brain barrier inflammation in CM.

Abstract: Summary
An increasing number of studies have shown the key role that RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) elongation plays in gene regulation. We systematically examine how various enhancers, promoters, and gene body composition influence the RNA Pol II elongation rate through a single-cell-resolution live imaging assay. By using reporter constructs containing 5′ MS2 and 3′ PP7 repeating stem loops, we quantify the rate of RNA Pol II elongation in live Drosophila embryos. We find that promoters and exonic gene lengths have no effect on elongation rate, while enhancers and the presence of long introns may significantly change how quickly RNA Pol II moves across a gene. Furthermore, we observe in multiple constructs that the RNA Pol II elongation rate accelerates after the transcriptional onset of nuclear cycle 14 in Drosophila embryos. Our study provides a single-cell view of various mechanisms that affect the dynamic RNA Pol II elongation rate, ultimately affecting the rate of mRNA production.

Abstract: Summary
The steroid hormone 20-hydroxy-ecdysone (20E) promotes proliferation in Drosophila wing precursors at low titer but triggers proliferation arrest at high doses. Remarkably, wing precursors proliferate normally in the complete absence of the 20E receptor, suggesting that low-level 20E promotes proliferation by overriding the default anti-proliferative activity of the receptor. By contrast, 20E needs its receptor to arrest proliferation. Dose-response RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of ex vivo cultured wing precursors identifies genes that are quantitatively activated by 20E across the physiological range, likely comprising positive modulators of proliferation and other genes that are only activated at high doses. We suggest that some of these “high-threshold” genes dominantly suppress the activity of the pro-proliferation genes. We then show mathematically and with synthetic reporters that combinations of basic regulatory elements can recapitulate the behavior of both types of target genes. Thus, a relatively simple genetic circuit can account for the bimodal activity of this hormone.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular senescence is a stress-response mechanism implicated in various physiological processes, diseases, and aging. Current detection approaches have partially addressed the issue of senescent cell identification in clinical specimens. Effective methodologies enabling precise isolation or live tracking of senescent cells are still lacking. In-depth analysis of truly senescent cells is, therefore, an extremely challenging task. We report (1) the synthesis and validation of a fluorophore-conjugated, Sudan Black-B analog (GLF16), suitable for in vivo and in vitro analysis of senescence by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry and (2) the development and application of a GLF16-carrying micelle vector facilitating GLF16 uptake by living senescent cells in vivo and in vitro. The compound and the applied methodology render isolation of senescent cells an easy, rapid, and precise process. Straightforward nanocarrier-mediated GLF16 delivery in live senescent cells comprises a unique tool for characterization of senescence at an unprecedented depth.

Abstract: Summary
Local immune activation at mucosal surfaces, mediated by mucosal lymphoid tissues, is vital for effective immune responses against pathogens. While pathogens like severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can spread to multiple organs, patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) primarily experience inflammation and damage in their lungs. To investigate this apparent organ-specific immune response, we develop an analytical framework that recognizes the significance of mucosal lymphoid tissues. This framework combines histology, immunofluorescence, spatial transcript profiling, and mathematical modeling to identify cellular and gene expression differences between the lymphoid tissues of the lung and the gut and predict the determinants of those differences. Our findings indicate that mucosal lymphoid tissues are pivotal in organ-specific immune response to SARS-CoV-2, mediating local inflammation and tissue damage and contributing to immune dysfunction. The framework developed here has potential utility in the study of long COVID and may streamline biomarker discovery and treatment design for diseases with differential pathologies at the organ level.

Abstract: The Hippo kinase cascade functions as a central hub that relays input from the “outside world” of the cell and translates it into specific cellular responses by regulating the activity of Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1). How Hippo translates input from the extracellular signals into specific intracellular responses remains unclear. Here, we show that transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)-activated TAK1 activates LATS1/2, which then phosphorylates YAP1. Phosphorylated YAP1 (p-YAP1) associates with RUNX3, but not with TEAD4, to form a TGFβ-stimulated restriction (R)-point-associated complex which activates target chromatin loci in the nucleus. Soon after, p-YAP1 is exported to the cytoplasm. Attenuation of TGFβ signaling results in re-localization of unphosphorylated YAP1 to the nucleus, where it forms a YAP1/TEAD4/SMAD3/AP1/p300 complex. The TGFβ-stimulated spatiotemporal dynamics of YAP1 are abrogated in many cancer cells. These results identify a new pathway that integrates TGFβ signals and the Hippo pathway (TGFβ→TAK1→LATS1/2→YAP1 cascade) with a novel dynamic nuclear role for p-YAP1.

Abstract: Reproductive toxicity is a serious side effect of cisplatin (CP) chemotherapy. Gentisic acid (GTA) is a phenolic acid with strong antioxidant properties. Here, we aimed to determine therapeutic effect of GTA against CP-induced testicular toxicity in rats for the first time. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received a single dose of CP (5 mg/kg; intraperitoneal) and treated with GTA (1.5 and 3 mg/kg; intraperitoneal; 3 consecutive days). The levels of oxidative stress (OS), inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and apoptosis biomarkers were assessed in the testicular tissue of rats. In addition, how CP affects the nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway and the effect of GTA on this situation were also addressed in the testicular tissue. CP administration induced histopathological changes in testicular tissue of rats with a significant increase in OS, inflammation, ERS and apoptosis biomarkers and a decrease in antioxidant capacity and Nrf2 expression levels. Administrations of GTA resulted in an amelioration of these altered parameters. These data suggest that GTA may be a potential therapeutic agent against CP-induced testicular toxicity. Activation of the Nrf2 pathway plays a key role of this therapeutic effect of GTA.

Abstract: Summary
Host-pathogen interactions are complex by nature, and the host developmental stage increases this complexity. By utilizing Caenorhabditis elegans larvae as the host and the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa as the pathogen, we investigated how a developing organism copes with pathogenic stress. By screening 36 P. aeruginosa isolates, we found that the CF18 strain causes a severe but reversible developmental delay via induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial dysfunction. While the larvae upregulate mitophagy, antimicrobial, and detoxification genes, mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) genes are repressed. Either antioxidant or iron supplementation rescues the phenotypes. We examined the virulence factors of CF18 via transposon mutagenesis and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). We found that non-phenazine toxins that are regulated by quorum sensing (QS) and the GacA/S system are responsible for developmental slowing. This study highlights the importance of ROS levels and mitochondrial health as determinants of developmental rate and how pathogens can attack these important features.

Abstract: Summary
The Hippo pathway is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of tissue growth that integrates inputs from both polarity and actomyosin networks. An upstream activator of the Hippo pathway, Kibra, localizes at the junctional and medial regions of the apical cortex in epithelial cells, and medial accumulation promotes Kibra activity. Here, we demonstrate that cortical Kibra distribution is controlled by a tug-of-war between apical polarity and actomyosin dynamics. We show that while the apical polarity network, in part via atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), tethers Kibra at the junctional cortex to silence its activity, medial actomyosin flows promote Kibra-mediated Hippo complex formation at the medial cortex, thereby activating the Hippo pathway. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the relationship between the Hippo pathway, polarity, and actomyosin cytoskeleton, and it offers novel insights into how fundamental features of epithelial tissue architecture can serve as inputs into signaling cascades that control tissue growth, patterning, and morphogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer cells usually exhibit shortened 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) due to alternative polyadenylation (APA) to promote cell proliferation and migration. Upregulated CPSF6 leads to a systematic prolongation of 3′ UTRs, but CPSF6 expression in tumors is typically higher than that in healthy tissues. This contradictory observation suggests that it is necessary to investigate the underlying mechanism by which CPSF6 regulates APA switching in cancer. Here, we find that CPSF6 can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), and elevated LLPS is associated with the preferential usage of the distal poly(A) sites. CLK2, a kinase upregulated in cancer cells, destructs CPSF6 LLPS by phosphorylating its arginine/serine-like domain. The reduction of CPSF6 LLPS can lead to a shortened 3′ UTR of cell-cycle-related genes and accelerate cell proliferation. These results suggest that CPSF6 LLPS, rather than its expression level, may be responsible for APA regulation in cancer cells.

Abstract: CRISPR-Cas12a has been used for genome editing and molecular diagnosis. The well-studied Cas12a orthologs have a T-rich PAM and are usually categorized as non-thermally stable enzymes. Here, we identified a new Cas12a ortholog from Clostridium thermobutyricum, which survives at 60 °C. This Cas12a ortholog is named as CtCas12a and exhibits low sequence similarity to the known Cas12a family members. CtCas12a is active in a wide temperature range from 17 to 77 °C. Moreover, this ortholog has a relaxed PAM of YYV (Y=C or T, V = A or C or G). We optimized the conditions for trans-cleavage and enabled its detection of nucleic acids. CtCas12a executed genome editing in human cells and generated up to 26% indel formation in the EGFP locus. With the ability to be active at high temperatures as well as having a relaxed PAM sequence, CtCas12a holds potential to be further engineered for pathogen detection and editing a wide range of genomic sequences.

Abstract: Summary
During the past two decades, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been widely used to study human neural development and disease. Especially in the field of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), remarkable effort has been put into investigating molecular mechanisms behind this disease. Then, with the advent of 3D neuronal cultures and cerebral organoids (COs), several studies have demonstrated that this model can adequately mimic familial and sporadic AD. Therefore, we created an AD-CO model using iPSCs derived from patients with familial AD forms and explored early events and the progression of AD pathogenesis. Our study demonstrated that COs derived from three AD-iPSC lines with PSEN1(A246E) or PSEN2(N141I) mutations developed the AD-specific markers in vitro, yet they also uncover tissue patterning defects and altered development. These findings are complemented by single-cell sequencing data confirming this observation and uncovering that neurons in AD-COs likely differentiate prematurely.

Abstract: Summary
The autonomic nervous system plays a pivotal role in cardiac repair. Here, we describe the mechanistic underpinning of adrenergic signaling in fibrotic and regenerative response of the heart to be dependent on immunomodulation. A pharmacological approach identified adrenergic receptor alpha-1 as a key regulator of macrophage phenotypic diversification following myocardial damage in zebrafish. Genetic manipulation and single-cell transcriptomics showed that the receptor signals activation of an “extracellular matrix remodeling” transcriptional program in a macrophage subset, which serves as a key regulator of matrix composition and turnover. Mechanistically, adrenergic receptor alpha-1-activated macrophages determine activation of collagen-12-expressing fibroblasts, a cellular determinant of cardiac regenerative niche, through midkine-mediated paracrine crosstalk, allowing lymphatic and blood vessel growth and cardiomyocyte proliferation at the lesion site. These findings identify the mechanism of adrenergic signaling in macrophage phenotypic and functional determination and highlight the potential of neural modulation for regulation of fibrosis and coordination of myocardial regenerative response.

Abstract: 17β-estradiol (E2) and canonical WNT-signaling represent crucial regulatory pathways for microtubule dynamics and synaptic formation. However, it is unclear yet whether E2-induced canonical WNT ligands have significant impact on neurogenic repair under inflammatory condition. In this study, first, we prepared the chronic activated-microglial-conditioned media, known to be comprised of neuro-inflammatory components. Long term exposure of microglial conditioned media to SH-SY5Y cells showed a negative impact on differentiation markers, microtubule associated protein-2 (MAP2) and synaptophysin (SYP), which was successfully rescued by pre and co-treatment of 10 nM 17β-estradiol. The inhibition of estrogen receptors, ERα and ERβ significantly blocked the E2-mediated recovery in the expression of differentiation marker, SYP. Furthermore, the inflammatory inhibition of canonical signaling ligand, WNT1 was also found to be rescued by E2. To our surprise, E2 was unable to replicate this success with β-catenin, which is considered to be the intracellular transducer of canonical WNT signaling. However, WNT antagonist - Dkk1 blocked the E2-mediated recovery in the expression of the differentiation marker, MAP2. Therefore, our data suggests that E2-mediated recovery in SH-SY5Y differentiation follows a divergent pathway from the conventional canonical WNT signaling pathway, which seems to regulate microtubule stability without the involvement of β-catenin. This mechanism provides fresh insight into how estradiol contributes to the restoration of differentiation marker proteins in the context of chronic neuroinflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Condensin is a structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) complex family member thought to build mitotic chromosomes by DNA loop extrusion. However, condensin variants unable to extrude loops, yet proficient in chromosome formation, were recently described. Here, we explore how condensin might alternatively build chromosomes. Using bulk biochemical and single-molecule experiments with purified fission yeast condensin, we observe that individual condensins sequentially and topologically entrap two double-stranded DNAs (dsDNAs). Condensin loading transitions through a state requiring DNA bending, as proposed for the related cohesin complex. While cohesin then favors the capture of a second single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), second dsDNA capture emerges as a defining feature of condensin. We provide complementary in vivo evidence for DNA-DNA capture in the form of condensin-dependent chromatin contacts within, as well as between, chromosomes. Our results support a “diffusion capture” model in which condensin acts in mitotic chromosome formation by sequential dsDNA-dsDNA capture.

Abstract: Summary
Cognitive functioning requires coordination between brain areas. Between visual areas, feedforward gamma synchronization improves behavioral performance. Here, we investigate whether similar principles hold across brain regions and frequency bands, using simultaneous electrocorticographic recordings from 15 areas of two macaque monkeys during performance of a selective attention task. Short behavioral reaction times (RTs), suggesting efficient interareal communication, occurred when occipital areas V1, V2, V4, and DP showed gamma synchronization, and fronto-central areas S1, 5, F1, F2, and F4 showed beta synchronization. For both area clusters and corresponding frequency bands, deviations from the typically observed phase relations increased RTs. Across clusters and frequency bands, good phase relations occurred in a correlated manner specifically when they processed the behaviorally relevant stimulus. Furthermore, the fronto-central cluster exerted a beta-band influence onto the occipital cluster whose strength predicted short RTs. These results suggest that local gamma and beta synchronization and their inter-regional coordination jointly improve behavioral performance.

Abstract: Summary
MCL-1 is a high-priority target due to its dominant role in the pathogenesis and chemoresistance of cancer, yet clinical trials of MCL-1 inhibitors are revealing toxic side effects. MCL-1 biology is complex, extending beyond apoptotic regulation and confounded by its multiple isoforms, its domains of unresolved structure and function, and challenges in distinguishing noncanonical activities from the apoptotic response. We find that, in the presence or absence of an intact mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, genetic deletion or pharmacologic targeting of MCL-1 induces DNA damage and retards cell proliferation. Indeed, the cancer cell susceptibility profile of MCL-1 inhibitors better matches that of anti-proliferative than pro-apoptotic drugs, expanding their potential therapeutic applications, including synergistic combinations, but heightening therapeutic window concerns. Proteomic profiling provides a resource for mechanistic dissection and reveals the minichromosome maintenance DNA helicase as an interacting nuclear protein complex that links MCL-1 to the regulation of DNA integrity and cell-cycle progression.

Abstract: Summary
RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification is implicated in cancer progression, yet its role in regulating long noncoding RNAs during cancer progression remains unclear. Here, we report that the m6A demethylase fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) stabilizes long intergenic noncoding RNA for kinase activation (LINK-A) to promote cell proliferation and chemoresistance in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Mechanistically, LINK-A promotes the interaction between minichromosome maintenance complex component 3 (MCM3) and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), increasing MCM3 phosphorylation. This phosphorylation facilitates the loading of the MCM complex onto chromatin, which promotes cell-cycle progression and subsequent cell proliferation. Moreover, LINK-A disrupts the interaction between MCM3 and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), abrogating MCM3-mediated HIF-1α transcriptional repression and promoting glycolysis and chemoresistance. These results elucidate the mechanism by which FTO-stabilized LINK-A plays oncogenic roles and identify the FTO/LINK-A/MCM3/HIF-1α axis as a promising therapeutic target for ESCC.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanisms that prevent accidental activation of the PINK1/Parkin mitophagy circuit on healthy mitochondria are poorly understood. On the surface of damaged mitochondria, PINK1 accumulates and acts as the input signal to a positive feedback loop of Parkin recruitment, which in turn promotes mitochondrial degradation via mitophagy. However, PINK1 is also present on healthy mitochondria, where it could errantly recruit Parkin and thereby activate this positive feedback loop. Here, we explore emergent properties of the PINK1/Parkin circuit by quantifying the relationship between mitochondrial PINK1 concentrations and Parkin recruitment dynamics. We find that Parkin is recruited to mitochondria only if PINK1 levels exceed a threshold and then only after a delay that is inversely proportional to PINK1 levels. Furthermore, these two regulatory properties arise from the input-coupled positive feedback topology of the PINK1/Parkin circuit. These results outline an intrinsic mechanism by which the PINK1/Parkin circuit can avoid errant activation on healthy mitochondria.

Abstract: Summary
Identifying the cells from which cancers arise is critical for understanding the molecular underpinnings of tumor evolution. To determine whether stem/progenitor cells can serve as cells of origin, we created a Msi2-CreERT2 knock-in mouse. When crossed to CAG-LSL-MycT58A mice, Msi2-CreERT2 mice developed multiple pancreatic cancer subtypes: ductal, acinar, adenosquamous, and rare anaplastic tumors. Combining single-cell genomics with computational analysis of developmental states and lineage trajectories, we demonstrate that MYC preferentially triggers transformation of the most immature MSI2+ pancreas cells into multi-lineage pre-cancer cells. These pre-cancer cells subsequently diverge to establish pancreatic cancer subtypes by activating distinct transcriptional programs and large-scale genomic changes, and enforced expression of specific signals like Ras can redirect subtype specification. This study shows that multiple pancreatic cancer subtypes can arise from a common pool of MSI2+ cells and provides a powerful model to understand and control the programs that shape divergent fates in pancreatic cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The ability of the human immune system to generate antibodies to any given antigen can be strongly influenced by immunoglobulin V-gene allelic polymorphisms. However, previous studies have provided only limited examples. Therefore, the prevalence of this phenomenon has been unclear. By analyzing >1,000 publicly available antibody-antigen structures, we show that many V-gene allelic polymorphisms in antibody paratopes are determinants for antibody binding activity. Biolayer interferometry experiments further demonstrate that paratope allelic polymorphisms on both heavy and light chains often abolish antibody binding. We also illustrate the importance of minor V-gene allelic polymorphisms with low frequency in several broadly neutralizing antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza virus. Overall, this study not only highlights the pervasive impact of V-gene allelic polymorphisms on antibody binding but also provides mechanistic insights into the variability of antibody repertoires across individuals, which in turn have important implications for vaccine development and antibody discovery.

Abstract: Summary
The tumor-suppressor breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) in complex with BRCA1-associated really interesting new gene (RING) domain 1 (BARD1) is a RING-type ubiquitin E3 ligase that modifies nucleosomal histone and other substrates. The importance of BRCA1-BARD1 E3 activity in tumor suppression remains highly controversial, mainly stemming from studying mutant ligase-deficient BRCA1-BARD1 species that we show here still retain significant ligase activity. Using full-length BRCA1-BARD1, we establish robust BRCA1-BARD1-mediated ubiquitylation with specificity, uncover multiple modes of activity modulation, and construct a truly ligase-null variant and a variant specifically impaired in targeting nucleosomal histones. Cells expressing either of these BRCA1-BARD1 separation-of-function alleles are hypersensitive to DNA-damaging agents. Furthermore, we demonstrate that BRCA1-BARD1 ligase is not only required for DNA resection during homology-directed repair (HDR) but also contributes to later stages for HDR completion. Altogether, our findings reveal crucial, previously unrecognized roles of BRCA1-BARD1 ligase activity in genome repair via HDR, settle prior controversies regarding BRCA1-BARD1 ligase functions, and catalyze new efforts to uncover substrates related to tumor suppression.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the roles of different cell types in regulating T cell homeostasis in various tissues is critical for understanding adaptive immunity. Here, we show that RTECs (renal tubular epithelial cells) are intrinsically programmed to polyclonally stimulate proliferation of kidney αβ T cells by a cell-cell contact mechanism that is major histocompatibility complex (MHC) independent and regulated by CD155, αVβ3-integrin, and vitronectin. Peripheral CD4 and CD8 are resistant to RTEC-mediated stimulation, while the minor subset of double-negative (DN) T cells are responsive. This functional property of RTEC is discovered by using a coculture system that recapitulates spontaneous in vivo polyclonal proliferation of kidney T cells, which are mainly comprised of central memory T (TCM) and effector memory T (TEM) cells. This robust cell-intrinsic stimulatory role of RTECs could be underlying the steady-state spontaneous proliferation of kidney T cells. The results have conceptual implications for understanding roles of different cell types in regulating systemic and organ-specific T cell homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
To maximize solute transport, epithelial cells build an apical “brush border,” where thousands of microvilli are linked to their neighbors by protocadherin-containing intermicrovillar adhesion complexes (IMACs). Previous studies established that the IMAC is needed to build a mature brush border, but how this complex contributes to the accumulation of new microvilli during differentiation remains unclear. We found that early in differentiation, mouse, human, and porcine epithelial cells exhibit a marginal accumulation of microvilli, which span junctions and interact with protrusions on neighboring cells using IMAC protocadherins. These transjunctional IMACs are highly stable and reinforced by tension across junctions. Finally, long-term live imaging showed that the accumulation of microvilli at cell margins consistently leads to accumulation in medial regions. Thus, nascent microvilli are stabilized by a marginal capture mechanism that depends on the formation of transjunctional IMACs. These results may offer insights into how apical specializations are assembled in diverse epithelial systems.

Abstract: Summary
The nuclear receptor co-repressor (NCoR) complex mediates transcriptional repression dependent on histone deacetylation by histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) as a component of the complex. Unexpectedly, we found that signaling by the receptor activator of nuclear factor κB (RANK) converts the NCoR/HDAC3 co-repressor complex to a co-activator of AP-1 and NF-κB target genes that are required for mouse osteoclast differentiation. Accordingly, the dominant function of NCoR/HDAC3 complexes in response to RANK signaling is to activate, rather than repress, gene expression. Mechanistically, RANK signaling promotes RNA-dependent interaction of the transcriptional co-activator PGC1β with the NCoR/HDAC3 complex, resulting in the activation of PGC1β and inhibition of HDAC3 activity for acetylated histone H3. Non-coding RNAs Dancr and Rnu12, which are associated with altered human bone homeostasis, promote NCoR/HDAC3 complex assembly and are necessary for RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation in vitro. These findings may be prototypic for signal-dependent functions of NCoR in other biological contexts.

Abstract: Summary
Cilia protrude from the cell surface and play critical roles in intracellular signaling, environmental sensing, and development. Reduced actin-dependent contractility and intracellular trafficking are both required for ciliogenesis, but little is known about how these processes are coordinated. Here, we identified a Rac1- and Rab35-binding protein with a truncated BAR (Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs) domain that we named MiniBAR (also known as KIAA0355/GARRE1), which plays a key role in ciliogenesis. MiniBAR colocalizes with Rac1 and Rab35 at the plasma membrane and on intracellular vesicles trafficking to the ciliary base and exhibits fast pulses at the ciliary membrane. MiniBAR depletion leads to short cilia, resulting from abnormal Rac-GTP/Rho-GTP levels and increased acto-myosin-II-dependent contractility together with defective trafficking of IFT88 and ARL13B into cilia. MiniBAR-depleted zebrafish embryos display dysfunctional short cilia and hallmarks of ciliopathies, including left-right asymmetry defects. Thus, MiniBAR is a dual Rac and Rab effector that controls both actin cytoskeleton and membrane trafficking for ciliogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Despite available targeted treatments for the disease, drug-resistant chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) poses a clinical challenge. The objective of this study is to examine whether the dual-specific phosphatases DUSP1 and DUSP6 are required to negatively regulate mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and thus counterbalance excessive MAPK activity. We show that high expression of DUSP6 in CLL correlates with poor clinical prognosis. Importantly, genetic deletion of the inhibitory phosphatase DUSP1 or DUSP6 and blocking DUSP1/6 function using a small-molecule inhibitor reduces CLL cell survival in vitro and in vivo. Using global phospho-proteome approaches, we observe acute activation of MAPK signaling by DUSP1/6 inhibition. This promotes accumulation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and, thereby, DNA damage and apoptotic cell death in CLL cells. Finally, we observe that DUSP1/6 inhibition is particularly effective against treatment-resistant CLL and therefore suggest transient DUSP1/6 inhibition as a promising treatment concept to eliminate drug-resistant CLL cells.

Abstract: Summary
Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is recognized for its pleiotropic properties that suppress inflammation. We report that ApoE serves as a metabolic rheostat that regulates microRNA control of glycolytic and mitochondrial activity in myeloid cells and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). ApoE expression in myeloid cells increases microRNA-146a, which reduces nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-driven GLUT1 expression and glycolytic activity. In contrast, ApoE expression reduces microRNA-142a, which increases carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (CPT1A) expression, fatty acid oxidation, and oxidative phosphorylation. Improved mitochondrial metabolism by ApoE expression causes an enrichment of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) in macrophages. The study of mice with conditional ApoE expression supports the capacity of ApoE to foster microRNA-controlled immunometabolism. Modulation of microRNA-146a and -142a in the hematopoietic system of hyperlipidemic mice using RNA mimics and antagonists, respectively, improves mitochondrial metabolism, which suppresses inflammation and hematopoiesis. Our findings unveil microRNA regulatory circuits, controlled by ApoE, that exert metabolic control over hematopoiesis and inflammation in hyperlipidemia.

Abstract: Summary
Chronic pain is a complex experience with multifaceted behavioral manifestations, often leading to pain avoidance at the expense of reward approach. How pain facilitates avoidance in situations with mixed outcomes is unknown. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) plays a key role in pain processing and in value-based decision-making. Distinct ACC inputs inform about the sensory and emotional quality of pain. However, whether specific ACC circuits underlie pathological conflict assessment in pain remains underexplored. Here, we demonstrate that mice with chronic pain favor cold avoidance rather than reward approach in a conflicting task. This occurs along with selective strengthening of basolateral amygdala inputs onto ACC layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons. The amygdala-cingulate projection is necessary and sufficient for the conflicting cold avoidance. Further, low-frequency stimulation of this pathway restores AMPA receptor function and reduces avoidance in pain mice. Our findings provide insights into the circuits and mechanisms underlying cognitive aspects of pain and offer potential targets for treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Approaches to study human pharyngeal foregut endoderm—a developmental intermediate that is linked to various human syndromes involving pharynx development and organogenesis of tissues such as thymus, parathyroid, and thyroid—have been hampered by scarcity of tissue access and cellular models. We present an efficient stepwise differentiation method to generate human pharyngeal foregut endoderm from pluripotent stem cells. We determine dose and temporal requirements of signaling pathway engagement for optimized differentiation and characterize the differentiation products on cellular and integrated molecular level. We present a computational classification tool, “CellMatch,” and transcriptomic classification of differentiation products on an integrated mouse scRNA-seq developmental roadmap confirms cellular maturation. Integrated transcriptomic and chromatin analyses infer differentiation stage-specific gene regulatory networks. Our work provides the method and integrated multiomic resource for the investigation of disease-relevant loci and gene regulatory networks and their role in developmental defects affecting the pharyngeal endoderm and its derivatives.

Abstract: Summary
Damage to our genome causes acute senescence in mammalian cells, which undergo growth arrest and release a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that propagates the stress response to bystander cells. Thus, acute senescence is a powerful tumor suppressor. Salmonella enterica hijacks senescence through its typhoid toxin, which usurps unidentified factors in the stress secretome of senescent cells to mediate intracellular infections. Here, transcriptomics of toxin-induced senescent cells (TxSCs) and proteomics of their secretome identify the factors as Wnt5a, INHBA, and GDF15. Wnt5a establishes a positive feedback loop, driving INHBA and GDF15 expression. In fibroblasts, Wnt5a and INHBA mediate autocrine senescence in TxSCs and paracrine senescence in naive cells. Wnt5a synergizes with GDF15 to increase Salmonella invasion. Intestinal TxSCs undergo apoptosis without Wnt5a, which is required for establishing intestinal TxSCs. The study reveals how an innate defense against cancer is co-opted by a bacterial pathogen to cause widespread damage and mediate infections.

Abstract: Summary
The increasing prevalence of food allergies has been linked to reduced commensal microbial diversity. In this article, we describe two features of allergy-protective Clostridia that contribute to their beneficial effects. Some Clostridial taxa bear flagella (a ligand for TLR5) and produce indole (a ligand for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor [AhR]). Lysates and flagella from a Clostridia consortium induced interleukin-22 (IL-22) secretion from ileal explants. IL-22 production is abrogated in explants from mice in which TLR5 or MyD88 signaling is deficient either globally or conditionally in CD11c+ antigen-presenting cells. AhR signaling in RORγt+ cells is necessary for the induction of IL-22. Mice deficient in AhR in RORγt+ cells exhibit increased intestinal permeability and are more susceptible to an anaphylactic response to food. Our findings implicate TLR5 and AhR signaling in a molecular mechanism by which commensal Clostridia protect against allergic responses to food.

Abstract: Summary
Circadian gene transcription is fundamental to metabolic physiology. Here we report that the nuclear receptor REV-ERBα, a repressive component of the molecular clock, forms circadian condensates in the nuclei of mouse liver. These condensates are dictated by an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) located in the protein’s hinge region which specifically concentrates nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCOR1) at the genome. IDR deletion diminishes the recruitment of NCOR1 and disrupts rhythmic gene transcription in vivo. REV-ERBα condensates are located at high-order transcriptional repressive hubs in the liver genome that are highly correlated with circadian gene repression. Deletion of the IDR disrupts transcriptional repressive hubs and diminishes silencing of target genes by REV-ERBα. This work demonstrates physiological circadian protein condensates containing REV-ERBα whose IDR is required for hub formation and the control of rhythmic gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
Hippocampus place cell discharge is temporally unreliable across seconds and days, and place fields are multimodal, suggesting an “ensemble cofiring” spatial coding hypothesis with manifold dynamics that does not require reliable spatial tuning, in contrast to hypotheses based on place field (spatial tuning) stability. We imaged mouse CA1 (cornu ammonis 1) ensembles in two environments across three weeks to evaluate these coding hypotheses. While place fields “remap,” being more distinct between than within environments, coactivity relationships generally change less. Decoding location and environment from 1-s ensemble location-specific activity is effective and improves with experience. Decoding environment from cell-pair coactivity relationships is also effective and improves with experience, even after removing place tuning. Discriminating environments from 1-s ensemble coactivity relies crucially on the cells with the most anti-coactive cell-pair relationships because activity is internally organized on a low-dimensional manifold of non-linear coactivity relationships that intermittently reregisters to environments according to the anti-cofiring subpopulation activity.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding of cellular evolution and molecular programs of chimeric antigen receptor-engineered (CAR)-T cells post-infusion is pivotal for developing better treatment strategies. Here, we construct a longitudinal high-precision single-cell transcriptomic landscape of 7,578 CAR-T cells from 26 patients with B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) post-infusion. We molecularly identify eight CAR-T cell subtypes, including three cytotoxic subtypes with distinct kinetics and three dual-identity subtypes with non-T cell characteristics. Remarkably, long-term remission is coincident with the dominance of cytotoxic subtypes, while leukemia progression is correlated with the emergence of subtypes with B cell transcriptional profiles, which have dysfunctional features and might predict relapse. We further validate in vitro that the generation of B-featured CAR-T cells is induced by excessive tumor antigen stimulation or suppressed TCR signaling, while it is relieved by exogenous IL-12. Moreover, we define transcriptional hallmarks of CAR-T cell subtypes and reveal their molecular changes along computationally inferred cellular evolution in vivo. Collectively, these results decipher functional diversification and dynamics of peripheral CAR-T cells post-infusion.

Abstract: Summary
Resolution of cohesion between sister telomeres in human cells depends on TRF1-mediated recruitment of the polyADP-ribosyltransferase tankyrase to telomeres. In human aged cells, due to insufficient recruitment of TRF1/tankyrase to shortened telomeres, sisters remain cohered in mitosis. This persistent cohesion plays a protective role, but the mechanism by which sisters remain cohered is not well understood. Here we show that telomere repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) holds sister telomeres together through RNA-DNA hybrid (R-loop) structures. We show that a tankyrase-interacting partner, the RNA-binding protein C19orf43, is required for repression of TERRA R-loops. Persistent telomere cohesion in C19orf43-depleted cells is counteracted by RNaseH1, confirming that RNA-DNA hybrids hold sisters together. Consistent with a protective role for persistent telomere cohesion, depletion of C19orf43 in aged cells reduces DNA damage and delays replicative senescence. We propose that the inherent inability of shortened telomeres to recruit R-loop-repressing machinery permits a controlled onset of senescence.

Abstract: Summary
Animals rapidly acquire surrounding information to perform the appropriate behavior. Although social learning is more efficient and accessible than self-learning for animals, the detailed regulatory mechanism of social learning remains unknown, mainly because of the complicated information transfer between animals, especially for aversive conditioning information transmission. The current study revealed that, during social learning, the neural circuit in observer flies used to process acquired aversive conditioning information from demonstrator flies differs from the circuit used for self-learned classic aversive conditioning. This aversive information transfer is species dependent. Solitary flies cannot learn this information through social learning, suggesting that this ability is not an innate behavior. Neurons used to process and execute avoidance behavior to escape from electrically shocked flies are all in the same brain region, indicating that the fly brain has a common center for integrating external stimuli with internal states to generate flight behavior.

Abstract: Multiple blood-borne pathogens infecting mammals establish close interactions with the host vascular endothelium as part of their life cycles. In this work, we investigate differences in the interactions of three Trypanosoma species: T. brucei, T. congolense and T. vivax with the blood vasculature. Infection with these species results in vastly different pathologies, including different effects on vascular homeostasis, such as changes in vascular permeability and microhemorrhages. While all three species are extracellular parasites, T. congolense is strictly intravascular, while T. brucei is capable of surviving both extra- and intravascularly. Our knowledge regarding T. vivax tropism and its capacity of migration across the vascular endothelium is unknown. In this work, we show for the first time that T. vivax parasites sequester to the vascular endothelium of most organs, and that, like T. congolense, T. vivax Y486 is largely incapable of extravasation. Infection with this parasite species results in a unique effect on vascular endothelium receptors including general downregulation of ICAM1 and ESAM, and upregulation of VCAM1, CD36 and E-selectin. Our findings on the differences between the two sequestering species (T. congolense and T. vivax) and the non-sequestering, but extravasating, T. brucei raise important questions on the relevance of sequestration to the parasite’s survival in the mammalian host, and the evolutionary relevance of both sequestration and extravasation.

Abstract: Summary
The spontaneous firing of neurons is modulated by brain state. Here, we examine how such modulation impacts the overall distribution of firing rates in neuronal populations of neocortical, hippocampal, and thalamic areas across natural and pharmacologically driven brain state transitions. We report that across all the examined combinations of brain area and state transition category, the structure of rate modulation is similar, with almost all fast-firing neurons experiencing proportionally weak modulation, while slow-firing neurons exhibit high inter-neuron variability in the modulation magnitude, leading to a stronger modulation on average. We further demonstrate that this modulation structure is linked to the left-skewed distribution of firing rates on the logarithmic scale and is recapitulated by bivariate log-gamma, but not Gaussian, distributions. Our findings indicate that a preconfigured log-rate distribution with rigid fast-firing neurons and a long left tail of malleable slow-firing neurons is a generic property of forebrain neuronal circuits.

Abstract: Summary
Alpha oscillations are a distinctive feature of the awake resting state of the human brain. However, their functional role in resting-state neuronal dynamics remains poorly understood. Here we show that, during resting wakefulness, alpha oscillations drive an alternation of attenuation and amplification bouts in neural activity. Our analysis indicates that inhibition is activated in pulses that last for a single alpha cycle and gradually suppress neural activity, while excitation is successively enhanced over a few alpha cycles to amplify neural activity. Furthermore, we show that long-term alpha amplitude fluctuations—the “waxing and waning” phenomenon—are an attenuation-amplification mechanism described by a power-law decay of the activity rate in the “waning” phase. Importantly, we do not observe such dynamics during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep with marginal alpha oscillations. The results suggest that alpha oscillations modulate neural activity not only through pulses of inhibition (pulsed inhibition hypothesis) but also by timely enhancement of excitation (or disinhibition).

Abstract: Summary
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) poses a singular challenge for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) therapy owing to its phenotypic heterogeneity and similarity to normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). Here we expound a CAR strategy intended to efficiently target AML while minimizing HSPC toxicity. Quantification of target expression in relapsed/refractory patient samples and normal HSPCs reveals a therapeutic window for gated co-targeting of ADGRE2 and CLEC12A: We combine an attenuated ADGRE2-CAR with a CLEC12A-chimeric costimulatory receptor (ADCLEC.syn1) to preferentially engage ADGRE2posCLEC12Apos leukemic stem cells over ADGRE2lowCLEC12Aneg normal HSPCs. ADCLEC.syn1 prevents antigen escape in AML xenograft models, outperforms the ADGRE2-CAR alone and eradicates AML despite proximate myelopoiesis in humanized mice. Off-target HSPC toxicity is similar to that of a CD19-CAR and can be mitigated by reducing CAR T cell-derived interferon-γ. Overall, we demonstrate the ability of target density-adapted cooperative CAR targeting to selectively eliminate AML and potentially obviate the need for hematopoietic rescue.

Abstract: Summary
Blood-oxygenation-level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI) of cortical layers relies on the hemodynamic response and is biased toward large veins on the cortical surface. Functional changes in the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (ΔCMRO2) may reflect neural cortical function better than BOLD fMRI, but it is unknown whether the calibrated BOLD model for functional CMRO2 measurement remains valid at high resolution. Here, we measure laminar ΔCMRO2 elicited by visual stimulation in macaque primary visual cortex (V1) and find that ΔCMRO2 peaks in the middle of the cortex, in agreement with autoradiographic measures of metabolism. ΔCMRO2 values in gray matter are similar as found previously. Reductions in CMRO2 are associated with veins at the cortical surface, suggesting that techniques for vein removal may improve the accuracy of the model at very high resolution. However, our results show feasibility of laminar ΔCMRO2 measurement, providing a physiologically meaningful metric of laminar functional metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Despite their burden, most congenital defects remain poorly understood, due to lack of knowledge of embryological mechanisms. Here, we identify Greb1l mutants as a mouse model of crisscross heart. Based on 3D quantifications of shape changes, we demonstrate that torsion of the atrioventricular canal occurs together with supero-inferior ventricles at E10.5, after heart looping. Mutants phenocopy partial deficiency in retinoic acid signaling, which reflect overlapping pathways in cardiac precursors. Spatiotemporal gene mapping and cross-correlated transcriptomic analyses further reveal the role of Greb1l in maintaining a pool of dorsal pericardial wall precursor cells during heart tube elongation, likely by controlling ribosome biogenesis and cell differentiation. Consequently, we observe growth arrest and malposition of the outflow tract, which are predictive of abnormal tube remodeling in mutants. Our work on a rare cardiac malformation opens novel perspectives on the origin of a broader spectrum of congenital defects associated with GREB1L in humans.

Abstract: Calcium-sensing receptor (CASR), primarily found in the parathyroid gland and other tissues, plays a crucial role in sensing and regulating extracellular calcium, which was also aberrantly expressed in human tumors. Nevertheless, a comprehensive analysis of CASR in pan-cancer has yet to be conducted. To gain a better understanding of CASR in pan-cancer, data profiles on CASR cancers were collected from TCGA database. The expression level, clinical significance, prognostic value, and potential mechanisms of CASR in pan-cancer were analyzed via multiple public databases. The functional assays were conducted using human kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) cell lines, clinical samples, and nude mice. Our research revealed that the abnormal expression of CASR was found in a variety of tumors. The expression and mutation of CASR were significantly associated with tumor prognosis and stage. Pathway analyses suggested that CASR was involved in the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) progress. Besides, CASR expression was correlated with immune inhibitory genes and immunotherapy in cancers. Particularly in KIRC, we established that CASR mRNA and protein levels were downregulated in clinical samples and cell lines. Moreover, a Cox regression analysis revealed that CASR was an independent prognostic factor in both TCGA-KIRC samples and clinical samples from our center. In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that blocking CASR with lentivirus could suppress tumor growth and invasion, and EMT progress in KIRC cells. In summary, our study provides a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of CASR in pan-cancer, offering deeper insights into its function and the EMT mechanism in KIRC, warranting further investigation.

Abstract: Summary
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification controls numerous cellular processes. To what extent these post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms play a role in hematopoiesis has not been fully elucidated. We here show that the m6A demethylase alkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5) controls mitochondrial ATP production and modulates hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) fitness in an m6A-dependent manner. Loss of ALKBH5 results in increased RNA methylation and instability of oxoglutarate-dehydrogenase (Ogdh) messenger RNA and reduction of OGDH protein levels. Limited OGDH availability slows the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle with accumulation of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) and conversion of α-KG into L-2-hydroxyglutarate (L-2-HG). L-2-HG inhibits energy production in both murine and human hematopoietic cells in vitro. Impaired mitochondrial energy production confers competitive disadvantage to HSPCs and limits clonogenicity of Mll-AF9-induced leukemia. Our study uncovers a mechanism whereby the RNA m6A demethylase ALKBH5 regulates the stability of metabolic enzyme transcripts, thereby controlling energy metabolism in hematopoiesis and leukemia.

Abstract: Summary
Clathrin-mediated vesicular formation and trafficking are responsible for molecular cargo transport and signal transduction among organelles. Our previous study shows that CHLOROPLAST VESICULATION (CV)-containing vesicles (CVVs) are generated from chloroplasts for chloroplast degradation under abiotic stress. Here, we show that CV interacts with the clathrin heavy chain (CHC) and induces vesicle budding toward the cytosol from the chloroplast inner envelope membrane. In the defective mutants of CHC2 and the dynamin-encoding DRP1A, CVV budding and releasing from chloroplast are impeded. The mutations of CHC2 inhibit CV-induced chloroplast degradation and hypersensitivity to water stress. Moreover, CV-CHC2 interaction is impaired by the oxidized GLYCERALDEHYDE-3-PHOSPHATE DEHYDROGENASE (GAPC). GAPC1 overexpression suppresses CV-mediated chloroplast degradation and hypersensitivity to water stress, while CV silencing alleviates the hypersensitivity of the gapc1gapc2 plant to water stress. Together, our work identifies a pathway of clathrin-assisted CVV budding outward from chloroplast, which is involved in chloroplast degradation and stress response.

Abstract: Summary
TRPM7 (transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 7) is a chanzyme with channel and kinase domains essential for embryo development. Using gamete-specific Trpm7-null lines, we report that TRPM7-mediated Mg2+ influx is indispensable for reaching the blastocyst stage. TRPM7 is expressed dynamically from gametes to blastocysts; displays stage-specific localization on the plasma membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus; and undergoes cleavage that produces C-terminal kinase fragments. TRPM7 underpins Mg2+ homeostasis, and excess Mg2+ but not Zn2+ or Ca2+ overcomes the arrest of Trpm7-null embryos; expressing Trpm7 mRNA restores development, but mutant versions fail or are partially rescued. Transcriptomic analyses of Trpm7-null embryos reveal an abundance of oxidative stress-pathway genes, confirmed by mitochondrial dysfunction, and a reduction in transcription factor networks essential for proliferation; Mg2+ supplementation corrects these defects. Hence, TRPM7 underpins Mg2+ homeostasis in preimplantation embryos, prevents oxidative stress, and promotes gene expression patterns necessary for developmental progression and cell-lineage specification.

DICER ribonuclease removes harmful R-loops,

Abstract: Summary
R-loops, which consist of a DNA-RNA hybrid and a displaced DNA strand, are known to threaten genome integrity. To counteract this, different mechanisms suppress R-loop accumulation by either preventing the hybridization of RNA with the DNA template (RNA biogenesis factors), unwinding the hybrid (DNA-RNA helicases), or degrading the RNA moiety of the R-loop (type H ribonucleases [RNases H]). Thus far, RNases H are the only nucleases known to cleave DNA-RNA hybrids. Now, we show that the RNase DICER also resolves R-loops. Biochemical analysis reveals that DICER acts by specifically cleaving the RNA within R-loops. Importantly, a DICER RNase mutant impaired in R-loop processing causes a strong accumulation of R-loops in cells. Our results thus not only reveal a function of DICER as an R-loop resolvase independent of DROSHA but also provide evidence for the role of multi-functional RNA processing factors in the maintenance of genome integrity in higher eukaryotes.

Abstract: Summary
Olfactory learning is widely regarded as a substrate for animal survival. The exact brain areas involved in olfactory learning and how they function at various stages during learning remain elusive. Here, we investigate the role of the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) and the posterior piriform cortex (PPC), two important olfactory areas, in aversive olfactory learning. We find that the LEC is involved in the acquisition of negative odor value during olfactory fear conditioning, whereas the PPC is involved in the memory-retrieval phase. Furthermore, inhibition of LEC CaMKIIα+ neurons affects fear encoding, fear memory recall, and PPC responses to a conditioned odor. These findings provide direct evidence for the involvement of LEC CaMKIIα+ neurons in negative valence encoding.

Abstract: Summary
The innate immune response must be terminated in a timely manner at the late stage of infection to prevent unwanted inflammation. The role of m6A-modified RNAs and their binding partners in this process is not well known. Here, we develop an enzymolysis-based RNA pull-down (eRP) method that utilizes the immunoglobulin G-degrading enzyme of Streptococcus pyogenes (IdeS) to fish out m6A-modified RNA-associated proteins. We apply eRP to capture the methylated single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) probe-associated proteins and identify YT521-B homology domain-containing 2 (YTHDC2) as the m6A-modified interferon β (IFN-β) mRNA-binding protein. YTHDC2, induced in macrophages at the late stage of virus infection, recruits IFN-stimulated exonuclease ISG20 (IFN-stimulated exonuclease gene 20) to degrade IFN-β mRNA, consequently inhibiting antiviral innate immune response. In vitro and in vivo deficiency of YTHDC2 increases IFN-β production at the late stage of viral infection. Our findings establish an eRP method to effectively identify RNA-protein interactions and add mechanistic insight to the termination of innate response for maintaining homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Neutrophil recruitment to inflammatory sites appears to be an evolutionarily conserved strategy to fight against exogenous insults. However, the rhythmic characteristics and underlying mechanisms of neutrophil migration on a 24-h timescale are largely unknown. Using the advantage of in vivo imaging of zebrafish, this study explored how the circadian gene clock1a dynamically regulates the rhythmic recruitment of neutrophils to inflammatory challenges. We generated a clock1a mutant and found that neutrophil migration is significantly increased in caudal fin injury and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection. Transcriptome sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and dual-luciferase reporting experiments suggest that the clock1a gene regulates neutrophil migration by coordinating the rhythmic expression of nfe212a and duox genes to control the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. This study ultimately provides a visual model to expand the understanding of the rhythmic mechanisms of neutrophil recruitment on a circadian timescale in a diurnal organism from the perspective of ROS.

Abstract: Summary
A high-sugar diet induces lifestyle-associated metabolic diseases, such as obesity and diabetes, which may underlie the pro-tumor effects of a high-sugar diet. We supply GL261 syngeneic glioblastoma (GBM) mice with a short-term high-glucose drink (HGD) and find an increased survival rate with no evidence of metabolic disease. Modulation of the gut microbiota through HGD supplementation is critical for enhancing the anti-tumor immune response. Single-cell RNA sequencing shows that gut microbiota modulation by HGD supplementation increases the T cell-mediated anti-tumor immune response in GBM mice. We find that the cytotoxic CD4+ T cell population in GBM is increased due to synergy with anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitors, but this effect depends upon HGD supplementation. Thus, we determine that HGD supplementation enhances anti-tumor immune responses in GBM mice through gut microbiota modulation and suggest that the role of HGD supplementation in GBM should be re-examined.

Abstract: Diabetic wound is one of the main challenges in dermatology. Although stem cell-based treatment has therapeutic benefits in wound repair, the clinical application is still limited. Herein we investigated whether adipose stem cells -derived exosomes (Exo) loaded on hyaluronic acid (HA) could promote healing in diabetic rats. Sixty diabetic rats were randomly planned into the control group, Exo group, HA group, and HA+Exo group. On days 7, 14, and 21, five rats from each group were sampled for stereological, molecular, and tensiometrical assessments. Our results indicated that the wound closure rate, the total volumes of new epidermis and dermis, the numerical densities of fibroblasts, the length density blood vessels, collagen density as well as tensiometrical parameters of the healed wounds were significantly higher in the treated groups than in the control group, and these changes were more obvious in the HA+Exo ones. Furthermore, the expression of TGF-β and VEGF genes were meaningfully upregulated in all treated groups compared to the control group and were greater in the HA+Exo group. This is while expression of TNF-α and IL-1β, as well as numerical densities of neutrophils decreased more considerably in the HA+Exo group in comparison to the other groups. Generally, it was found that using both HA injection and exosomes has more effect on diabetic wound healing.

Abstract: Summary
Healthy Kupffer cell (KC) pool is dominated by embryonic KCs (EmKCs), preserving liver homeostasis. How the KC pool varies upon injury remains unclear. Using chimeric mice with bone marrow (BM) cells labeled with enhanced green fluorescent protein, we identify that BM monocyte-derived KCs (MoKCs) become dominant in cholestatic- or toxic-injured livers via immunofluorescence and mass cytometry. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) unveils the enhanced proliferative, anti-apoptotic properties and repair potential of MoKCs compared with EmKCs, which are confirmed in vivo and ex vivo through flow cytometry, qPCR, Cell Counting Kit-8, and immunofluorescence. Furthermore, compared with EmKC-dominated livers, MoKC-dominated livers exhibit less functional damage, necrosis, and fibrosis under damage, as tested by serum alanine aminotransferase activity detection, H&E and Sirius red staining, qPCR, and western blot. Collectively, we highlight that MoKCs dominate the KC pool in injured livers and show enhanced proliferative and anti-apoptotic properties while also promoting repair and attenuating fibrosis.

Abstract: Summary
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications play crucial roles in RNA metabolism. How m6A regulates RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) transcription remains unclear. We find that 7SK small nuclear RNA (snRNA), a regulator of RNA Pol II promoter-proximal pausing, is highly m6A-modified in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. In A549 cells, we identified eight m6A sites on 7SK and discovered methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) and alkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5) as the responsible writer and eraser. When the m6A-7SK is specifically erased by a dCasRx-ALKBH5 fusion protein, A549 cell growth is attenuated due to reduction of RNA Pol II transcription. Mechanistically, removal of m6A leads to 7SK structural rearrangements that facilitate sequestration of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) complex, which results in reduction of serine 2 phosphorylation (Ser2P) in the RNA Pol II C-terminal domain and accumulation of RNA Pol II in the promoter-proximal region. Taken together, we uncover that m6A modifications of a non-coding RNA regulate RNA Pol II transcription and NSCLC tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Introduction
Positive effects of calorie restrictions (CR) and EOD include decreased body weight, prolonged life span, but also changes in metabolism of the liver. In present paper our aim was to examine antioxidative enzymes: Catalase (CAT) and Manganese superoxidative dismutase (MnSOD, SOD2) and Glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx-4) in connection to caspase-3 and inflammatory mediators (IL-1β and TNF- α) in EOD liver tissue in comparison to control mice.
Methods
After 9 months of EOD treatment male mouse liver tissue was harvested and prepared for analysis. Protein semi-quantitative estimation and cellular immunolocalization was performed for CAT, SOD2, Gpx-4, caspase-3, IL-1β and TNF- α in liver tissue of mice fed every-other day in comparison to control (AL fed) animals.
Results
After prolonged EOD feeding in mice we observed decreased level of SOD2 and Gpx-4, decreased caspase-3, IL-1β and TNF-α expression in liver tissue on protein level measured by semi-quantitative DAB staining intensity.
Conclusion
For the first time we showed immunolocalization of major antioxidative enzymes (CAT, SOD2, Gpx-4) in liver tissue after DR. Decrease of two major antioxidant enzymes combined with decrease of apoptotic marker and inflammatory factors indicate decrease in oxidative stress as the result of fast in EOD feeding regime.

Abstract: Summary
Advanced prostate cancers are treated with therapies targeting the androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway. While many tumors initially respond to AR inhibition, nearly all develop resistance. It is critical to understand how prostate tumor cells respond to AR inhibition in order to exploit therapy-induced phenotypes prior to the outgrowth of treatment-resistant disease. Here, we comprehensively characterize the effects of AR blockade on prostate cancer metabolism using transcriptomics, metabolomics, and bioenergetics approaches. The metabolic response to AR inhibition is defined by reduced glycolysis, robust elongation of mitochondria, and increased reliance on mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. We establish DRP1 activity and MYC signaling as mediators of AR-blockade-induced metabolic phenotypes. Rescuing DRP1 phosphorylation after AR inhibition restores mitochondrial fission, while rescuing MYC restores glycolytic activity and prevents sensitivity to complex I inhibition. Our study provides insight into the regulation of treatment-induced metabolic phenotypes and vulnerabilities in prostate cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in SOD1 cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) through gain-of-function effects, yet the mechanisms by which misfolded mutant SOD1 (mutSOD1) protein impairs human motor neurons (MNs) remain unclear. Here, we use induced-pluripotent-stem-cell-derived MNs coupled to metabolic stable isotope labeling and mass spectrometry to investigate proteome-wide degradation dynamics. We find several proteins, including the ALS-causal valosin-containing protein (VCP), which predominantly acts in proteasome degradation and autophagy, that degrade slower in mutSOD1 relative to isogenic control MNs. The interactome of VCP is altered in mutSOD1 MNs in vitro, while VCP selectively accumulates in the affected motor cortex of ALS-SOD1 patients. Overexpression of VCP rescues mutSOD1 toxicity in MNs in vitro and in a C. elegans model in vivo, in part due to its ability to modulate the degradation of insoluble mutSOD1. Our results demonstrate that VCP contributes to mutSOD1-dependent degeneration, link two distinct ALS-causal genes, and highlight selective protein degradation impairment in ALS pathophysiology.

Abstract: Summary
We report the results of GUIDANCE-01 (NCT04025593), a randomized, phase II trial of R-CHOP alone or combined with targeted agents (R-CHOP-X) guided by genetic subtyping of newly diagnosed, intermediate-risk, or high-risk diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). A total of 128 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive R-CHOP-X or R-CHOP. The study achieved the primary endpoint, showing significantly higher complete response rate with R-CHOP-X than R-CHOP (88% vs. 66%, p = 0.003), with overall response rate of 92% vs. 73% (p = 0.005). Two-year progression-free survival rates were 88% vs. 63% (p < 0.001), and 2-year overall survival rates were 94% vs. 77% (p = 0.001). Meanwhile, post hoc RNA-sequencing validated our simplified genetic subtyping algorithm and previously established lymphoma microenvironment subtypes. Our findings highlight the efficacy and safety of R-CHOP-X, a mechanism-based tailored therapy, which dually targeted genetic and microenvironmental alterations in patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL.

Abstract: Summary
Kinases are important therapeutic targets, and their inhibitors are classified according to their mechanism of action, which range from blocking ATP binding to covalent inhibition. Here, a mechanism of inhibition is highlighted by capturing p21-activated kinase 5 (PAK5) in an intermediate state of activation using an Affimer reagent that binds in the P+1 pocket. PAK5 was identified from a non-hypothesis-driven high-content imaging RNAi screen in urothelial cancer cells. Silencing of PAK5 resulted in reduced cell number, G1/S arrest, and enlargement of cells, suggesting it to be important in urothelial cancer cell line survival and proliferation. Affimer reagents were isolated to identify mechanisms of inhibition. The Affimer PAK5-Af17 recapitulated the phenotype seen with siRNA. Co-crystallization revealed that PAK5-Af17 bound in the P+1 pocket of PAK5, locking the kinase into a partial activation state. This mechanism of inhibition indicates that another class of kinase inhibitors is possible.

Abstract: Summary
Atherosclerosis, a leading health concern, stems from the dynamic involvement of immune cells in vascular plaques. Despite its significance, the interplay between chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation in plaque macrophages is understudied. We discovered the reduced expression of Baf60a, a component of the switch/sucrose non-fermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complex, in macrophages from advanced plaques. Myeloid-specific Baf60a deletion compromised mitochondrial integrity and heightened adhesion, apoptosis, and plaque development. BAF60a preserves mitochondrial energy homeostasis under pro-atherogenic stimuli by retaining nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) accessibility at critical genes. Overexpression of BAF60a rescued mitochondrial dysfunction in an NRF1-dependent manner. This study illuminates the BAF60a-NRF1 axis as a mitochondrial function modulator in atherosclerosis, proposing the rejuvenation of perturbed chromatin remodeling machinery as a potential therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause of bacterial skin infections in humans, including patients with atopic dermatitis (AD). Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) are the first cells to infiltrate an infection site, where they usually provide an effective first line of defense, including neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation. Here, we show that infiltrating PMNs in inflamed human and mouse skin enhance S. aureus skin colonization and persistence. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that a crosstalk between keratinocytes and PMNs results in enhanced NET formation upon S. aureus infection, which in turn induces oxidative stress and expression of danger-associated molecular patterns such as high-mobility-group-protein B1 (HMGB1) in keratinocytes. In turn, HMGB1 enhances S. aureus skin colonization and persistence by promoting skin barrier dysfunctions by the downregulation of epidermal barrier genes. Using patient material, we show that patients with AD exhibit enhanced presence of PMNs, NETs, and HMGB1 in the skin, demonstrating the clinical relevance of our finding.

Abstract: Summary
Sex differences in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development are regulated by sex and non-sex chromosomes, sex hormones, and environmental factors. We previously reported that Ncoa5+/− mice develop HCC in a male-biased manner. Here we show that NCOA5 expression is reduced in male patient HCCs while the expression of an NCOA5-interacting tumor suppressor, TIP30, is lower in female HCCs. Tip30 heterozygous deletion does not change HCC incidence in Ncoa5+/− male mice but dramatically increases HCC incidence in Ncoa5+/− female mice, accompanied by hepatic hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channel 3 (HCN3) overexpression. HCN3 overexpression cooperates with MYC to promote mouse HCC development, whereas Hcn3 knockout preferentially hinders HCC development in female mice. Furthermore, HCN3 amplification and overexpression occur in human HCCs and correlate with a poorer prognosis of patients in a female-biased manner. Our results suggest that TIP30 and NCOA5 protect against female liver oncogenesis and that HCN3 is a female-biased HCC driver.

Abstract: Summary
The current paradigm indicates that naive T cells are primed in secondary lymphoid organs. Here, we present evidence that intranasal administration of peptide antigens appended to nanofibers primes naive CD8+ T cells in the lung independently and prior to priming in the draining mediastinal lymph node (MLN). Notably, comparable accumulation and transcriptomic responses of CD8+ T cells in lung and MLN are observed in both Batf3KO and wild-type (WT) mice, indicating that, while cDC1 dendritic cells (DCs) are the major subset for cross-presentation, cDC2 DCs alone are capable of cross-priming CD8+ T cells both in the lung and draining MLN. Transcription analyses reveal distinct transcriptional responses in lung cDC1 and cDC2 to intranasal nanofiber immunization. However, both DC subsets acquire shared transcriptional responses upon migration into the lymph node, thus uncovering a stepwise activation process of cDC1 and cDC2 toward their ability to cross-prime effector and functional memory CD8+ T cell responses.

Abstract: Summary
Fructose consumption is associated with tumor growth and metastasis in mice, yet its impact on antitumor immune responses remains unclear. Here, we show that dietary fructose modulates adipocyte metabolism to enhance antitumor CD8+ T cell immune responses and control tumor growth. Transcriptional profiling of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells reveals that dietary fructose mediates attenuated transition of CD8+ T cells to terminal exhaustion, leading to a superior antitumor efficacy. High-fructose feeding initiates adipocyte-derived leptin production in an mTORC1-dependent manner, thereby triggering leptin-boosted antitumor CD8+ T cell responses. Importantly, high plasma leptin levels are correlated with elevated plasma fructose concentrations and improved antitumor CD8+ T cell responses in patients with lung cancer. Our study characterizes a critical role for dietary fructose in shaping adipocyte metabolism to prime antitumor CD8+ T cell responses and highlights that the fructose-leptin axis may be harnessed for cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) convert extracellular stimuli into intracellular signaling by coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins of four classes: Gi/o, Gq, Gs, and G12/13. However, our understanding of the G protein selectivity of GPCRs is incomplete. Here, we quantitatively measure the enzymatic activity of GPCRs in living cells and reveal the G protein selectivity of 124 GPCRs with the exact rank order of their G protein preference. Using this information, we establish a classification of GPCRs by functional selectivity, discover the existence of a G12/13-coupled receptor, G15-coupled receptors, and a variety of subclasses for Gi/o-, Gq-, and Gs-coupled receptors, culminating in development of the predictive algorithm of G protein selectivity. We further identify the structural determinants of G protein selectivity, allowing us to synthesize non-existent GPCRs with de novo G protein selectivity and efficiently identify putative pathogenic variants.

Abstract: The turtle olfactory organ consists of upper (UCE) and lower (LCE) chamber epithelium, which send axons to the ventral and dorsal portions of the olfactory bulbs, respectively. Generally, the UCE is associated with glands and contains ciliated olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), while the LCE is devoid of glands and contains microvillous ORNs. However, the olfactory organ of the pig-nosed turtle Carettochelys insculpta appears to be a single olfactory system morphologically: there are no associated glands; ciliated ORNs are distributed throughout the olfactory organ; and the olfactory bulb is not divided into ventral and dorsal portions. In this study, we analyzed the expression of odorant receptors (ORs), the major olfactory receptors in turtles, in the pig-nosed turtle olfactory organ, via in situ hybridization. Of 690 ORs, 375 were classified as class I and 315 as class II. Some class II ORs were expressed predominantly in the posterior dorsomedial walls of the nasal cavity, while other class II ORs and all class I ORs examined were expressed in the remaining region. These results suggest that the pig-nosed turtle olfactory organ can be divided into two regions according to the expression of ORs.

Abstract: Summary
Esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (ESCC) is commonly treated with radiotherapy; however, radioresistance hinders its clinical effectiveness, and the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we develop patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) from 19 patients with ESCC to investigate the mechanisms driving radioresistance. Using RNA sequencing, cytokine arrays, and single-cell RNA sequencing, we reveal an enrichment of cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-derived collagen type 1 (Col1) and tumor-cell-derived CXCL1 in non-responsive PDXs. Col1 not only promotes radioresistance by augmenting DNA repair capacity but also induces CXCL1 secretion in tumor cells. Additionally, CXCL1 further activates CAFs via the CXCR2-STAT3 pathway, establishing a positive feedback loop. Directly interfering with tumor-cell-derived CXCL1 or inhibiting the CXCL1-CXCR2 pathway effectively restores the radiosensitivity of radioresistant xenografts in vivo. Collectively, our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying radioresistance and identifies potential targets to improve the efficacy of radiotherapy for ESCC.

Abstract: Background
Sepsis, an intricate systemic inflammatory syndrome, gives rise to various life-threatening complications, with acute lung injury (ALI) being prominently encountered. ALI, clinically characterized by pulmonary infiltration, hypoxemia, and edema, stands as a prevailing consequence of sepsis. This work sought to elucidate the mechanism of Apelin in mitigating sepsis-induced ALI (siALI).
Methods
A mouse sepsis model was constructed by cecal ligation and puncture surgery, followed utilizing histopathological analysis using HE staining. mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) were assessed utilizing qRT-PCR, while ELISA was employed to measure the levels of vWF, VEGF, IL-1β, and IL-18. Western blot was conducted to examine protein levels of NLRP3, Caspase-1 p20, GSDMD-N, and SIRT1. To evaluate the extent of endothelial cell (EC) pyroptosis, immunofluorescence co-staining of CD31, NLRP3, and Caspase-1 p20 was fulfilled. Furthermore, TUNEL staining was utilized to ascertain the degree of plasma membrane damage and cell death.
Results
Apelin demonstrated its potential in ameliorating siALI in mice by diminishing mRNA expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) as well as expression levels of vWF and VEGF. Apelin inhibited protein expression of NLRP3, Caspase-1 p20, and GSDMD-N, indicating that EC pyroptosis was suppressed. Finally, Apelin could upregulate the protein expression of SIRT1. This upregulation led to the inhibition of protein expression of NLRP3, Caspase-1 p20, and GSDMD-N, consequently suppressing EC pyroptosis. As a result, a reduction in the expression of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 ultimately alleviated siALI.
Conclusion
Apelin was confirmed to alleviate siALI partially by modulating SIRT1/NLRP3 pathway to inhibit EC pyroptosis, which dawned on the molecular mechanism of siALI and had important clinical significance for treating ALI effectively.

Abstract: Summary
To become specialized binders, antibodies undergo a process called affinity maturation to maximize their binding affinity. Despite this process, some antibodies retain low-affinity binding to diverse epitopes in a phenomenon called polyreactivity. Here we seek to understand the molecular basis of this polyreactivity in antibodies. Our results highlight that polyreactive antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) bind their targets with low affinities, comparable to T cell receptor recognition of autologous classical major histocompatibility complex. Extensive mutagenic studies find no singular amino acid residue or biochemical property responsible for polyreactive interaction, suggesting that polyreactive antibodies use multiple strategies for engagement. Finally, our crystal structures and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of polyreactive Fabs show increased rigidity compared to their monoreactive relatives, forming a neutral and accessible platform for diverse antigens to bind. Together, these data support a cooperative strategy of rigid neutrality in establishing the polyreactive status of an antibody molecule.

CPT1A mediates chemoresistance in human hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma via ATG16L1-dependent cellular autophagy,

Abstract: Hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HSCC) is a highly aggressive malignancy that constitutes approximately 95% of all hypopharyngeal carcinomas, and it carries a poor prognosis. The primary factor influencing the efficacy of anti-cancer drugs for this type of carcinoma is chemoresistance. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) has been associated with tumor progression in various cancers, including breast, gastric, lung, and prostate cancer. The inhibition or depletion of CPT1A can lead to apoptosis, curbing cancer cell proliferation and chemoresistance. However, the role of CPT1A in HSCC is not yet fully understood. In this study, we discovered that CPT1A is highly expressed in HSCC and is associated with an advanced T-stage and a poor 5-year survival rate among patients. Furthermore, the overexpression of CPT1A contributes to HSCC chemoresistance. Mechanistically, CPT1A can interact with the autophagy-related protein ATG16L1 and stimulate the succinylation of ATG16L1, which in turn drives autophagosome formation and autophagy. We also found that treatment with 3-methyladenine (3-MA) can reduce cisplatin resistance in HSCC cells that overexpress CPT1A. Our findings also showed that a CPT1A inhibitor significantly enhances cisplatin sensitivity both in vitro and in vivo. This study is the first to suggest that CPT1A has a regulatory role in autophagy and is linked to poor prognosis in HSCC patients. It presents novel insights into the roles of CPT1A in tumorigenesis and proposes that CPT1A could be a potential therapeutic target for HSCC treatment.

Abstract: Summary
While single-cell sequencing technologies provide unprecedented insights into genomic profiles at the cellular level, they lose the spatial context of cells. Over the past decade, diverse spatial transcriptomics and multi-omics technologies have been developed to analyze molecular profiles of tissues. In this article, we categorize current spatial genomics technologies into three classes: optical imaging, positional indexing, and mathematical cartography. We discuss trade-offs in resolution and scale, identify limitations, and highlight synergies between existing single-cell and spatial genomics methods. Further, we propose DNA-GPS (global positioning system), a theoretical framework for large-scale optics-free spatial genomics that combines ideas from mathematical cartography and positional indexing. DNA-GPS has the potential to achieve scalable spatial genomics for multiple measurement modalities, and by eliminating the need for optical measurement, it has the potential to position cells in three-dimensions (3D).

Abstract: Summary
Visual imagery allows for the construction of rich internal experience in our mental world. However, it has remained poorly understood how imagery experience derives volitionally as opposed to being cue driven. Here, using electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging, we systematically investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of self-generated imagery by having participants volitionally imagining one of the orientations from a learned pool. We contrast self-generated imagery with cue-induced imagery, where participants imagined line orientations based on associative cues acquired previously. Our results reveal overlapping neural signatures of cue-induced and self-generated imagery. Yet, these neural signatures display substantially differential sensitivities to the two types of imagery: self-generated imagery is supported by an enhanced involvement of the anterior cortex in representing imagery contents. By contrast, cue-induced imagery is supported by enhanced imagery representations in the posterior visual cortex. These results jointly support a reverse cortical hierarchy in generating and maintaining imagery contents in self-generated versus externally cued imagery.

Abstract: Summary
A fundamental neuroscience topic is the link between the brain’s molecular, cellular, and cytoarchitectonic properties and structural connectivity. Recent studies relate inter-regional connectivity to gene expression, but the relationship to regional cell-type distributions remains understudied. Here, we utilize whole-brain mapping of neuronal and non-neuronal subtypes via the matrix inversion and subset selection algorithm to model inter-regional connectivity as a function of regional cell-type composition with machine learning. We deployed random forest algorithms for predicting connectivity from cell-type densities, demonstrating surprisingly strong prediction accuracy of cell types in general, and particular non-neuronal cells such as oligodendrocytes. We found evidence of a strong distance dependency in the cell connectivity relationship, with layer-specific excitatory neurons contributing the most for long-range connectivity, while vascular and astroglia were salient for short-range connections. Our results demonstrate a link between cell types and connectivity, providing a roadmap for examining this relationship in other species, including humans.

Abstract: The physiology of most organisms, including Drosophila, is heavily influenced by their interactions with certain types of commensal bacteria. Acetobacter and Lactobacillus, two of the most representative Drosophila commensal bacteria, have stimulatory effects on host larval development and growth. However, how these effects are related to host immune activity remains largely unknown. Here, we show that the Drosophila development-promoting effects of commensal bacteria are suppressed by host immune activity. Mono-association of germ-free Drosophila larvae with Acetobacter pomorum stimulated larval development, which was accelerated when host immune deficiency (IMD) pathway genes were mutated. This phenomenon was not observed in the case of mono-association with Lactobacillus plantarum. Moreover, the mutation of Toll pathway, which constitutes the other branch of the Drosophila immune pathway, did not accelerate A. pomorum-stimulated larval development. The mechanism of action of the IMD pathway-dependent effects of A. pomorum did not appear to involve previously known host mechanisms and bacterial metabolites such as gut peptidase expression, acetic acid, and thiamine, but appeared to involve larval serum proteins. These findings may shed light on the interaction between the beneficial effects of commensal bacteria and host immune activity.

Abstract: Summary
Lipid droplets (LDs) play a crucial role in maintaining cellular lipid balance by storing and delivering lipids as needed. However, the intricate lipolytic pathways involved in LD turnover remain poorly described, hindering our comprehension of lipid catabolism and related disorders. Here, we show a function of the small GTPase ARL8B in mediating LD turnover in lysosomes. ARL8B-GDP localizes to LDs, while ARL8-GTP predominantly favors lysosomes. GDP binding induces a conformation with an exposed N-terminal amphipathic helix, enabling ARL8B to bind to LDs. By associating with LDs and lysosomes, and with its property to form a heterotypic complex, ARL8B mediates LD-lysosome contacts and efficient lipid transfer between these organelles. In human macrophages, this ARL8B-dependent LD turnover mechanism appears as the major lipolytic pathway. Our finding opens exciting possibilities for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying LD degradation and its potential implications for inflammatory disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial DNA double-strand breaks (mtDSBs) lead to the degradation of circular genomes and a reduction in copy number; yet, the cellular response in human cells remains elusive. Here, using mitochondrial-targeted restriction enzymes, we show that a subset of cells with mtDSBs exhibited defective mitochondrial protein import, reduced respiratory complexes, and loss of membrane potential. Electron microscopy confirmed the altered mitochondrial membrane and cristae ultrastructure. Intriguingly, mtDSBs triggered the integrated stress response (ISR) via the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) by DELE1 and heme-regulated eIF2α kinase (HRI). When ISR was inhibited, the cells experienced intensified mitochondrial defects and slower mtDNA recovery post-breakage. Lastly, through proteomics, we identified ATAD3A—a membrane-bound protein interacting with nucleoids—as potentially pivotal in relaying signals from impaired genomes to the inner mitochondrial membrane. In summary, our study delineates the cascade connecting damaged mitochondrial genomes to the cytoplasm and highlights the significance of the ISR in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis amid genome instability.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR-Cas9 is a powerful gene-editing technology; however, off-target activity remains an important consideration for therapeutic applications. We have previously shown that force-stretching DNA induces off-target activity and hypothesized that distortions of the DNA topology in vivo, such as negative DNA supercoiling, could reduce Cas9 specificity. Using single-molecule optical-tweezers, we demonstrate that negative supercoiling λ-DNA induces sequence-specific Cas9 off-target binding at multiple sites, even at low forces. Using an adapted CIRCLE-seq approach, we detect over 10,000 negative-supercoiling-induced Cas9 off-target double-strand breaks genome-wide caused by increased mismatch tolerance. We further demonstrate in vivo that directed local DNA distortion increases off-target activity in cells and that induced off-target events can be detected during Cas9 genome editing. These data demonstrate that Cas9 off-target activity is regulated by DNA topology in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that cellular processes, such as transcription and replication, could induce off-target activity at previously overlooked sites.

Abstract: Summary
The retinoblastoma (RB) and Hippo pathways interact to regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. However, the mechanism of interaction is not fully understood. Drosophila photoreceptors with inactivated RB and Hippo pathways specify normally but fail to maintain their neuronal identity and dedifferentiate. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing to elucidate the cause of dedifferentiation and to determine the fate of these cells. We find that dedifferentiated cells adopt a progenitor-like fate due to inappropriate activation of the retinal differentiation suppressor homothorax (hth) by Yki/Sd. This results in the activation of a distinct Yki/Hth transcriptional program, driving photoreceptor dedifferentiation. We show that Rbf physically interacts with Yki and, together with the GAGA factor, inhibits the hth expression. Thus, RB and Hippo pathways cooperate to maintain photoreceptor differentiation by preventing inappropriate expression of hth in differentiating photoreceptors. Our work highlights the importance of both RB and Hippo pathway activities for maintaining the state of terminal differentiation.

Abstract: This study aimed to investigate the protective effect of melatonin against the acute toxicity of cisplatin in ocular tissues. The eyes of 40 rats were divided into 4 groups: Control group (10 rats), Melatonin (Mel) group (10 rats), Cisplatin (Cis) group (10 rats), Melatonin (Mel) + Cisplatin (Cis) group (10 rats). Retina, cornea, and ciliary body tissues were examined after hematoxylin-eosin staining of sections obtained from the eyes and were scored for disorganization and degeneration. Apoptotic cells were counted for the retina, cornea, and ciliary body with the TUNEL (Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling) method. The total antioxidant status (TAS) / total oxidant status (TOS) of homogenized eye tissues were measured. While apoptotic cells were found to increase in the cornea of the Cisplatin (Cis) group, no difference was found regarding the retina and ciliary body cell count. An increased number of apoptotic cells in the cornea of the Cis group was found while there was a decrease in the group where Cisplatin and Melatonin were administered together (Mel+Cis group). There was no statistically significant difference amongst groups for TOS or TAS. Melatonin had a partial protective effect against histological damage.

Abstract: Type 2 immunity in the lung protects against pathogenic infection and facilitates tissue repair, but its dysregulation may lead to severe human diseases. Notably, cannabis usage for medical or recreational purposes has increased globally. However, the potential impact of the cannabinoid signal on lung immunity is incompletely understood. Here, we report that cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) is highly expressed in group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) of mouse and human lung tissues. Of importance, the CB2 signal enhances the IL-33-elicited immune response of ILC2s. In addition, the chemogenetic manipulation of inhibitory G proteins (Gi) downstream of CB2 produces a similarly promotive effect. Conversely, the genetic deletion of CB2 mitigates the IL-33-elicited type 2 immunity in the lung. Also, such ablation of the CB2 signal ameliorates papain-induced tissue inflammation. Together, these results have elucidated a critical aspect of the CB2 signal in lung immunity, implicating its potential involvement in pulmonary diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The retinoblastoma family proteins (RBs) and E2F transcription factors are cell-autonomous regulators of cell-cycle progression, but they also impact fate choice in addition to tumor suppression. The range of mechanisms involved remains to be uncovered. Here, we show that RBs, particularly RBL2/p130, repress WNT ligands such as WNT4 and WNT8A, thereby directing ectoderm specification between neural crest to neuroepithelium. RBL2 achieves this function through cell-cycle-dependent cooperation with E2Fs and GCN5 on the regulatory regions of WNT loci, which direct neuroepithelial versus neural crest specification by temporal fluctuations of WNT/β-catenin and DLL/NOTCH signaling activity. Thus, the RB-E2F bona fide cell-autonomous axis controls cell fate decisions, and RBL2 regulates field effects via WNT ligands. This reveals a non-cell-autonomous function of RBL2-E2F in stem cell and tissue progenitor differentiation that has broader implications for cell-cycle-dependent cell fate specification in organogenesis, adult stem cells, tissue homeostasis, and tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in gene expression regulation in cis. Although enriched in the cell chromatin fraction, to what degree this defines their regulatory potential remains unclear. Furthermore, the factors underlying lncRNA chromatin tethering, as well as the molecular basis of efficient lncRNA chromatin dissociation and its impact on enhancer activity and target gene expression, remain to be resolved. Here, we developed chrTT-seq, which combines the pulse-chase metabolic labeling of nascent RNA with chromatin fractionation and transient transcriptome sequencing to follow nascent RNA transcripts from their transcription on chromatin to release and allows the quantification of dissociation dynamics. By incorporating genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic metrics, as well as RNA-binding protein propensities, in machine learning models, we identify features that define transcript groups of different chromatin dissociation dynamics. Notably, lncRNAs transcribed from enhancers display reduced chromatin retention, suggesting that, in addition to splicing, their chromatin dissociation may shape enhancer activity.

Abstract: Summary
An actin-spectrin lattice, the membrane periodic skeleton (MPS), protects axons from breakage. MPS integrity relies on spectrin delivery via slow axonal transport, a process that remains poorly understood. We designed a probe to visualize endogenous spectrin dynamics at single-axon resolution in vivo. Surprisingly, spectrin transport is bimodal, comprising fast runs and movements that are 100-fold slower than previously reported. Modeling and genetic analysis suggest that the two rates are independent, yet both require kinesin-1 and the coiled-coil proteins UNC-76/FEZ1 and UNC-69/SCOC, which we identify as spectrin-kinesin adaptors. Knockdown of either protein led to disrupted spectrin motility and reduced distal MPS, and UNC-76 overexpression instructed excessive transport of spectrin. Artificially linking spectrin to kinesin-1 drove robust motility but inefficient MPS assembly, whereas impairing MPS assembly led to excessive spectrin transport, suggesting a balance between transport and assembly. These results provide insight into slow axonal transport and MPS integrity.

Abstract: Summary
Long-term memories are formed by creating stable memory representations via memory consolidation, which mainly occurs during sleep following the encoding of labile memories in the hippocampus during waking. The entorhinal cortex (EC) has intricate connections with the hippocampus, but its role in memory consolidation is largely unknown. Using cell-type- and input-specific in vivo neural activity recordings, here we show that the temporoammonic pathway neurons in the EC, which directly innervate the output area of the hippocampus, exhibit potent oscillatory activities during anesthesia and sleep. Using in vivo individual and populational neuronal activity recordings, we demonstrate that a subpopulation of the temporoammonic pathway neurons, which we termed sleep cells, generate delta oscillations via hyperpolarization-activated cyclic-nucleotide-gated channels during sleep. The blockade of these oscillations significantly impaired the consolidation of hippocampus-dependent memory. Together, our findings uncover a key driver of delta oscillations and memory consolidation that are found in the EC.
