Abstract: Cell replacement through neural stem cells has been a promising alternative therapy for neurodegenerative diseases. It was evaluated the possible protect and/or prevent role of neurospheres in experimental models of epilepsy by the use of biomarkers of oxidative stress and histopathological analysis. After 1 h of the epileptic inductions by pilocarpine, pentylenotetrazole and picrotoxin, rats were infused with a suspension of 2 × 106 cells/0.25 mL, marked with Qtracker® 655, via caudal vein. In the control group epilepsy was not induced, but received the cell infusion under the same conditions of other groups. After 30 days, the rats were euthanized, and the removal of the brain was proceeded to later perform the assays oxidative stress and histopathology analysis. Thiobarbituric acid and nitrite levels were elevated in epileptic groups treated with neurospheres, and the levels of reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase and catalase were reduced when compared to non-treated groups. The performance of oxidative enzymes from pilocarpine group treated with neurospheres showed slight increase. Histopathological evaluation observed distribution of neurospheres throughout the brain tissue, with viable cells and in process of differentiation in the pilocarpine group, but with differentiation and regeneration compromised in epilepsy by picrotoxin and pentylenetetrazole due to a microenvironment of oxidative stress. Neural stem cell therapy has a promising potential for protection in the pilocarpine epilepsy model, suggesting that the antioxidant system of neurospheres could reduce oxidative damage generated by seizure.

Abstract: Summary
RNAi-elicited gene silencing is heritable and can persist for multiple generations after its initial induction in C. elegans. However, the mechanism by which parental-acquired trait-specific information from RNAi is inherited by the progenies is not fully understood. Here, we identified a cytoplasmic Argonaute protein, WAGO-4, necessary for the inheritance of RNAi. WAGO-4 exhibits asymmetrical translocation to the germline during early embryogenesis, accumulates at the perinuclear foci in the germline, and is required for the inheritance of exogenous RNAi targeting both germline- and soma-expressed genes. WAGO-4 binds to 22G-RNAs and their mRNA targets. Interestingly, WAGO-4-associated endogenous 22G-RNAs target the same cohort of germline genes as CSR-1 and contain untemplated addition of uracil at the 3′ ends. The poly(U) polymerase CDE-1 is required for the untemplated uridylation of 22G-RNAs and inheritance of RNAi. Therefore, we conclude that, in addition to the nuclear RNAi pathway, the cytoplasmic RNAi machinery also promotes RNAi inheritance.

Abstract: Summary
The unfolded protein response (UPR) is induced by proteotoxic stress of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Here we report that ATF6, a major mammalian UPR sensor, is also activated by specific sphingolipids, dihydrosphingosine (DHS) and dihydroceramide (DHC). Single mutations in a previously undefined transmembrane domain motif that we identify in ATF6 incapacitate DHS/DHC activation while still allowing proteotoxic stress activation via the luminal domain. ATF6 thus possesses two activation mechanisms: DHS/DHC activation and proteotoxic stress activation. Reporters constructed to monitor each mechanism show that phenobarbital-induced ER membrane expansion depends on transmembrane domain-induced ATF6. DHS/DHC addition preferentially induces transcription of ATF6 target lipid biosynthetic and metabolic genes over target ER chaperone genes. Importantly, ATF6 containing a luminal achromatopsia eye disease mutation, unresponsive to proteotoxic stress, can be activated by fenretinide, a drug that upregulates DHC, suggesting a potential therapy for this and other ATF6-related diseases including heart disease and stroke.

Abstract: Summary
Human melanomas frequently harbor amplifications of EZH2. However, the contribution of EZH2 to melanoma formation has remained elusive. Taking advantage of murine melanoma models, we show that EZH2 drives tumorigenesis from benign BrafV600E- or NrasQ61K-expressing melanocytes by silencing of genes relevant for the integrity of the primary cilium, a signaling organelle projecting from the surface of vertebrate cells. Consequently, gain of EZH2 promotes loss of primary cilia in benign melanocytic lesions. In contrast, blockade of EZH2 activity evokes ciliogenesis and cilia-dependent growth inhibition in malignant melanoma. Finally, we demonstrate that loss of cilia enhances pro-tumorigenic WNT/β-catenin signaling, and is itself sufficient to drive metastatic melanoma in benign cells. Thus, primary cilia deconstruction is a key process in EZH2-driven melanomagenesis.

Abstract: Summary
To improve our understanding of ovarian cancer, we performed genome-wide analyses of 45 ovarian cancer cell lines. Given the challenges of genomic analyses of tumors without matched normal samples, we developed approaches for detection of somatic sequence and structural changes and integrated these with epigenetic and expression alterations. Alterations not previously implicated in ovarian cancer included amplification or overexpression of ASXL1 and H3F3B, deletion or underexpression of CDC73 and TGF-beta receptor pathway members, and rearrangements of YAP1-MAML2 and IKZF2-ERBB4. Dose-response analyses to targeted therapies revealed unique molecular dependencies, including increased sensitivity of tumors with PIK3CA and PPP2R1A alterations to PI3K inhibitor GNE-493, MYC amplifications to PARP inhibitor BMN673, and SMAD3/4 alterations to MEK inhibitor MEK162. Genome-wide rearrangements provided an improved measure of sensitivity to PARP inhibition. This study provides a comprehensive and broadly accessible resource of molecular information for the development of therapeutic avenues in ovarian cancer.

Abstract: Summary
SIRT3 is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent mitochondrial protein deacetylase purported to influence metabolism through post-translational modification of metabolic enzymes. Fuel-stimulated insulin secretion, which involves mitochondrial metabolism, could be susceptible to SIRT3-mediated effects. We used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to manipulate SIRT3 expression in β cells, resulting in widespread SIRT3-dependent changes in acetylation of key metabolic enzymes but no appreciable changes in glucose- or pyruvate-stimulated insulin secretion or metabolomic profile during glucose stimulation. Moreover, these broad changes in the SIRT3-targeted acetylproteome did not affect responses to nutritional or ER stress. We also studied mice with global SIRT3 knockout fed either standard chow (STD) or high-fat and high-sucrose (HFHS) diets. Only when chronically fed HFHS diet do SIRT3 KO animals exhibit a modest reduction in insulin secretion. We conclude that broad changes in mitochondrial protein acetylation in response to manipulation of SIRT3 are not sufficient to cause changes in islet function or metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Loss of the CDKN2A tumor suppressor is associated with melanoma metastasis, but the mechanisms connecting the phenomena are unknown. Using CRISPR-Cas9 to engineer a cellular model of melanoma initiation from primary human melanocytes, we discovered that a lineage-restricted transcription factor, BRN2, is downstream of CDKN2A and directly regulated by E2F1. In a cohort of melanocytic tumors that capture distinct progression stages, we observed that CDKN2A loss coincides with both the onset of invasive behavior and increased BRN2 expression. Loss of the CDKN2A protein product p16INK4A permitted metastatic dissemination of human melanoma lines in mice, a phenotype rescued by inhibition of BRN2. These results demonstrate a mechanism by which CDKN2A suppresses the initiation of melanoma invasion through inhibition of BRN2.

Abstract: Summary
Misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are destroyed by ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Although the retrotranslocation of misfolded proteins from the ER has been reconstituted, how a polypeptide is initially selected for ERAD remains poorly defined. To address this question while controlling for the diverse nature of ERAD substrates, we constructed a series of truncations in a single ER-tethered domain. We observed that the truncated proteins exhibited variable degradation rates and discovered a positive correlation between ERAD substrate instability and detergent insolubility, which demonstrates that aggregation-prone species can be selected for ERAD. Further, Hsp104 facilitated degradation of an insoluble species, consistent with the chaperone’s disaggregase activity. We also show that retrotranslocation of the ubiquitinated substrate from the ER was inhibited in the absence of Hsp104. Therefore, chaperone-mediated selection frees the ER membrane of potentially toxic, aggregation-prone species.

Abstract: Summary
Biological signals need to be robust and filter small fluctuations yet maintain sensitivity to signals across a wide range of magnitudes. Here, we studied how fluctuations in DNA damage signaling relate to maintenance of long-term cell-cycle arrest. Using live-cell imaging, we quantified division profiles of individual human cells in the course of 1 week after irradiation. We found a subset of cells that initially establish cell-cycle arrest and then sporadically escape and divide. Using fluorescent reporters and mathematical modeling, we determined that fluctuations in the oscillatory pattern of the tumor suppressor p53 trigger a sharp switch between p21 and CDK2, leading to escape from arrest. Transient perturbation of p53 stability mimicked the noise in individual cells and was sufficient to trigger escape from arrest. Our results show that the self-reinforcing circuitry that mediates cell-cycle transitions can translate small fluctuations in p53 signaling into large phenotypic changes.

Abstract: Summary
In most eukaryotes, meiotic crossovers are essential for error-free chromosome segregation but are specifically repressed near centromeres to prevent missegregation. Recognized for >85 years, the molecular mechanism of this repression has remained unknown. Meiotic chromosomes contain two distinct cohesin complexes: pericentric complex (for segregation) and chromosomal arm complex (for crossing over). We show that the pericentric-specific complex also actively represses pericentric meiotic double-strand break (DSB) formation and, consequently, crossovers. We uncover the mechanism by which fission yeast heterochromatin protein Swi6 (mammalian HP1-homolog) prevents recruitment of activators of meiotic DSB formation. Localizing missing activators to wild-type pericentromeres bypasses repression and generates abundant crossovers but reduces gamete viability. The molecular mechanism elucidated here likely extends to other species, including humans, where pericentric crossovers can result in disorders, such as Down syndrome. These mechanistic insights provide new clues to understand the roles played by multiple cohesin complexes, especially in human infertility and birth defects.

Abstract: Summary
Contact inhibition of locomotion is defined as the behavior of cells to cease migrating in their former direction after colliding with another cell. It has been implicated in multiple developmental processes and its absence has been linked to cancer invasion. Cellular forces are thought to govern this process; however, the exact role of traction through cell-matrix adhesions and tension through cell-cell adhesions during contact inhibition of locomotion remains unknown. Here we use neural crest cells to address this and show that cell-matrix adhesions are rapidly disassembled at the contact between two cells upon collision. This disassembly is dependent upon the formation of N-cadherin-based cell-cell adhesions and driven by Src and FAK activity. We demonstrate that the loss of cell-matrix adhesions near the contact leads to a buildup of tension across the cell-cell contact, a step that is essential to drive cell-cell separation after collision.

Abstract: Summary
Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is a circulating metabolite that has been implicated in the development of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD). In this paper, we identify blood markers, metabolites, proteins, gut microbiota patterns, and diets that are significantly associated with levels of plasma TMAO. We find that kidney markers are strongly associated with TMAO and identify CVD-related proteins that are positively correlated with TMAO. We show that metabolites derived by the gut microbiota are strongly correlated with TMAO and that the magnitude of this correlation varies with kidney function. Moreover, we identify diet-associated patterns in the microbiome that are correlated with TMAO. These findings suggest that both the process of TMAO accumulation and the mechanism by which TMAO promotes atherosclerosis are a complex interplay between diet and the microbiome on one hand and other system-level factors such as circulating proteins, metabolites, and kidney function.

Abstract: Summary
The import of superoxide dismutase-2 (SOD2) into mitochondria is vital for the survival of eukaryotic cells. SOD2 is encoded within the nuclear genome and translocated into mitochondria for activation after translation in the cytosol. The molecular chaperone Hsp70 modulates SOD2 activity by promoting import of SOD2 into mitochondria. In turn, the activity of Hsp70 is controlled by co-chaperones, particularly CHIP, which directs Hsp70-bound proteins for degradation in the proteasomes. We investigated the mechanisms controlling the activity of SOD2 to signal activation and maintain mitochondrial redox balance. We demonstrate that Akt1 binds to and phosphorylates the C terminus of Hsp70 on Serine631, which inhibits CHIP-mediated SOD2 degradation thereby stabilizing and promoting SOD2 import. Conversely, increased mitochondrial-H2O2 formation disrupts Akt1-mediated phosphorylation of Hsp70, and non-phosphorylatable Hsp70 mutants decrease SOD2 import, resulting in mitochondrial oxidative stress. Our findings identify Hsp70 phosphorylation as a physiological mechanism essential for regulation of mitochondrial redox balance.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer progression to an aggressive phenotype often co-opts aspects of stem cell biology. Here, we developed gene signatures for normal human stem cell populations to understand the relationship between epithelial cancers and stem cell transcriptional programs. Using a pan-cancer approach, we reveal that aggressive epithelial cancers are enriched for a transcriptional signature shared by epithelial adult stem cells. The adult stem cell signature selected for epithelial cancers with worse overall survival and alterations of oncogenic drivers. Lethal small cell neuroendocrine lung, prostate, and bladder cancers transcriptionally converged onto the adult stem cell signature and not other stem cell signatures tested. We found that DNA methyltransferase expression correlated with adult stem cell signature status and was enriched in small cell neuroendocrine cancers. DNA methylation analysis uncovered a shared epigenomic profile between small cell neuroendocrine cancers. These pan-cancer findings establish a molecular link between human adult stem cells and aggressive epithelial cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Extracellular growth factors signal to transcription factors via a limited number of cytoplasmic kinase cascades. It remains unclear how such cascades encode ligand identities and concentrations. In this paper, we use live-cell imaging and statistical modeling to study FOXO3, a transcription factor regulating diverse aspects of cellular physiology that is under combinatorial control. We show that FOXO3 nuclear-to-cytosolic translocation has two temporally distinct phases varying in magnitude with growth factor identity and cell type. These phases comprise synchronous translocation soon after ligand addition followed by an extended back-and-forth shuttling; this shuttling is pulsatile and does not have a characteristic frequency, unlike a simple oscillator. Early and late dynamics are differentially regulated by Akt and ERK and have low mutual information, potentially allowing the two phases to encode different information. In cancer cells in which ERK and Akt are dysregulated by oncogenic mutation, the diversity of states is lower.

Abstract: Summary
Pdgfra+ oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) arise in distinct specification waves during embryogenesis in the central nervous system (CNS). It is unclear whether there is a correlation between these waves and different oligodendrocyte (OL) states at adult stages. Here, we present bulk and single-cell transcriptomics resources providing insights on how transitions between these states occur. We found that post-natal OPCs from brain and spinal cord present similar transcriptional signatures. Moreover, post-natal OPC progeny of E13.5 Pdgfra+ cells present electrophysiological and transcriptional profiles similar to OPCs derived from subsequent specification waves, indicating that Pdgfra+ pre-OPCs rewire their transcriptional network during development. Single-cell RNA-seq and lineage tracing indicates that a subset of E13.5 Pdgfra+ cells originates cells of the pericyte lineage. Thus, our results indicate that embryonic Pdgfra+ cells in the CNS give rise to distinct post-natal cell lineages, including OPCs with convergent transcriptional profiles in different CNS regions.

Abstract: Summary
Microglia are brain-resident macrophages with trophic and phagocytic functions. Dominant loss-of-function mutations in a key microglia regulator, colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), cause adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP), a progressive white matter disorder. Because it remains unclear precisely how CSF1R mutations affect microglia, we generated an allelic series of csf1r mutants in zebrafish to identify csf1r-dependent microglia changes. We found that csf1r mutations led to aberrant microglia density and distribution and regional loss of microglia. The remaining microglia still had a microglia-specific gene expression signature, indicating that they had differentiated normally. Strikingly, we also observed lower microglia numbers and widespread microglia depletion in postmortem brain tissue of ALSP patients. Both in zebrafish and in human disease, local microglia loss also presented in regions without obvious pathology. Together, this implies that CSF1R mainly regulates microglia density and that early loss of microglia may contribute to ALSP pathogenesis.

Abstract: Calretinin has been detected in various excitable cells but the presence and putative roles of such a calcium-binding protein has never been characterized in sperm. Epididymal spermatozoa were collected from C57Bl6 (wild-type, WT) or calretinin knockout (CR−/−) mice and Wistar rats. A specific staining for calretinin was detected by immunofluorescence in the principal piece of the flagellum, both in WT mouse and rat spermatozoa. Western blots confirmed the expression of calretinin in rat and WT spermatozoa as well as its absence in CR−/− mice. No significant difference was observed in the spontaneous acrosome reaction between WT and CR−/− sperm. The addition of the calcium-ionophore A-23187, Thapsigargin or Progesterone to WT or CR−/− incubated spermatozoa induced increases in the acrosome reaction but the stimulatory effects were identical in both genotypes. Motility measurements assessed by computer-assisted sperm analysis indicated that, under basal non-stimulatory conditions, CR-/- sperm exhibited a lower curvilinear velocity and a smaller lateral head movement amplitude, although no difference was observed for the beat cross frequency. After incubation with 25 mM NH4Cl, the curvilinear velocity, the amplitude of the lateral head movement and the hyperactivation were increased, while the beat cross frequency was decreased, in both genotypes. Evaluation of the in vivo fertility potential indicated that the CR−/− litter sizes were clearly reduced compared to the WT litter sizes. Our study describes, for the first time, the expression of calretinin in sperm. These data extend the potential implication of calcium-binding proteins in the sperm calcium-signaling cascade and bring new insights into the understanding of sperm physiology.

Abstract: Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is stored as lysosomal vesicles in marginal cells of the stria vascular in neonatal rats, but the mechanisms of ATP release are unclear. Primary cultures of marginal cells from 1-day-old Sprague–Dawley rats were established. P2Y2 receptor and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor were immunolabelled in marginal cells of the stria vascular. We found that 30 μM ATP and 30 μM uridine triphosphate (UTP) evoked comparable significant increases in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, whereas the response was suppressed by 100 μM suramin, 10 μM 1-(6-(17β-3-methoxyester-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl)amino)-hexyl)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione(U-73122), 100 μM 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) and 5 μM thapsigargin (TG), thus indicating that ATP coupled with the P2Y2R-PLC-IP3 pathway to evoke Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Incubation with 200 μM Gly-Phe-β-naphthylamide (GPN) selectively disrupted lysosomes and caused significant increases in [Ca2+]I; this effect was partly inhibited by P2Y2R-PLC-IP3 pathway antagonists. After pre-treatment with 5 μM TG, [Ca2+]i was significantly lower than that after treatment with P2Y2R-PLC-IP3 pathway antagonists under the same conditions, thus indicating that lysosomal Ca2+ triggers Ca2+ release from ER Ca2+ stores. Baseline [Ca2+]i declined after treatment with the Ca2+ chelator 50 μM bis-(aminophenolxy) ethane-N,N,Nʹ,Nʹ-tetra-acetic acid acetoxyme-thyl ester (BAPTA-AM) and 4 IU/ml apyrase. 30 μM ATP decrease of the number of quinacrine-positive vesicles via lysosome exocytosis, whereas the number of lysosomes did not change. However, lysosome exocytosis was significantly suppressed by pre-treatment with 5 μM vacuolin-1. Release of ATP and β-hexosaminidase both increased after treatment with 200 μM GPN and 5 μM TG, but decreased after incubation with 50 μM BAPTA-AM, 4 IU/ml apyrase and 5 μM vacuolin-1. We suggest that ATP triggers Ca2+ release from the ER, thereby contributing to secretion of lysosomal ATP via lysosomal exocytosis. Lysosomal stored Ca2+ triggers Ca2+ release from the ER directly though the IP3 receptors, and lysosomal ATP evokes Ca2+ signals indirectly via the P2Y2R-PLC-IP3 pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Faithful chromosome segregation during mitosis depends on the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which delays progression through mitosis until every chromosome has stably attached to spindle microtubules via the kinetochore. We show here that the deubiquitinase USP9X strengthens the SAC by antagonizing the turnover of the mitotic checkpoint complex produced at unattached kinetochores. USP9X thereby opposes activation of anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) and specifically inhibits the mitotic degradation of SAC-controlled APC/C substrates. We demonstrate that depletion or loss of USP9X reduces the effectiveness of the SAC, elevates chromosome segregation defects, and enhances chromosomal instability (CIN). These findings provide a rationale to explain why loss of USP9X could be either pro- or anti-tumorigenic depending on the existing level of CIN.

Abstract: Summary
We report a web-based tool for analysis of experiments using indirect calorimetry to measure physiological energy balance. CalR simplifies the process to import raw data files, generate plots, and determine the most appropriate statistical tests for interpretation. Analysis using the generalized linear model (which includes ANOVA and ANCOVA) allows for flexibility in interpreting diverse experimental designs, including those of obesity and thermogenesis. Users also may produce standardized output files for an experiment that can be shared and subsequently re-evaluated using CalR. This framework will provide the transparency necessary to enhance consistency, rigor, and reproducibility. The CalR analysis software will greatly increase the speed and efficiency with which metabolic experiments can be organized, analyzed per accepted norms, and reproduced and will likely become a standard tool for the field. CalR is accessible at https://CalRapp.org/.

Mitochondrial Stasis Reveals p62-Mediated Ubiquitination in Parkin-Independent Mitophagy and Mitigates Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease,

Abstract: Summary
It is unknown what occurs if both mitochondrial division and fusion are completely blocked. Here, we introduced mitochondrial stasis by deleting two dynamin-related GTPases for division (Drp1) and fusion (Opa1) in livers. Mitochondrial stasis rescues liver damage and hypotrophy caused by the single knockout (KO). At the cellular level, mitochondrial stasis re-establishes mitochondrial size and rescues mitophagy defects caused by division deficiency. Using Drp1KO livers, we found that the autophagy adaptor protein p62/sequestosome-1—which is thought to function downstream of ubiquitination—promotes mitochondrial ubiquitination. p62 recruits two subunits of a cullin-RING ubiquitin E3 ligase complex, Keap1 and Rbx1, to mitochondria. Resembling Drp1KO, diet-induced nonalcoholic fatty livers enlarge mitochondria and accumulate mitophagy intermediates. Resembling Drp1Opa1KO, Opa1KO rescues liver damage in this disease model. Our data provide a new concept that mitochondrial stasis leads the spatial dimension of mitochondria to a stationary equilibrium and a new mechanism for mitochondrial ubiquitination in mitophagy.

Abstract: The arabinan-containing polysaccharides, arabinogalactan (AG) and lipoarabinomannan (LAM), are key cell wall components of the Corynebacterineae, which include Corynebacteria, Norcadia and Mycobacteria. Both AG and LAM contain elaborate arabinan domains composed of distinct structural motifs. Mycobacterial EmbA, EmbB and EmbC, collectively known as the Emb proteins, have been identified as arabinosyltransferases (ArafTs), which are targeted by the front-line anti-tubercular drug ethambutol. Previous studies have established that EmbA and EmbB play a role in the synthesis of the characteristic terminal hexa-arabinosuranosyl motif, whilst EmbC is involved exclusively in the biosynthesis of LAM. Herein, we have investigated the role of the singular Emb protein from Corynebacterium glutamicum through the detailed biochemical and chemical analysis of a double ΔaftAΔemb mutant, where the priming Cg-AftA protein, which generates the substrate for Cg-Emb has been deleted. Analysis of its cell wall revealed a complete absence of arabinose resulting in a truncated cell wall containing only a galactan backbone accompanied with complete loss of cell wall bound mycolates. In vitro cell-free assays using C. glutamicumΔaftA, C. glutamicumΔemb, C. glutamicumΔaftAΔemb and C. glutamicumΔaftBΔaftD and two synthetic acceptors, which mimick the arabinofuranose (Araf) “primed” galactan chain, demonstrated that Cg-Emb is able to transfer an Araf residue to the C5 of the Araf positioned on the synthetic acceptor(s). These results indicate that Cg-Emb acts as an α(1 → 5) ArafT and elongates the arabinan core during the early stages of arabinan biosynthesis in C. glutamicum.

Abstract: Summary
The cellular sensor stimulator of interferon genes (STING) initiates type I interferon (IFN) and cytokine production following association with cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) generated from intracellular bacteria or via a cellular synthase, cGAS, after binding microbial or self-DNA. Although essential for protecting the host against infection, unscheduled STING signaling is now known to be responsible for a variety of autoinflammatory disorders. Here, we report a gain-of-function mutation in STING (R284S), isolated from a patient who did not require CDNs to augment activity and who manifested a constitutively active phenotype. Control of the Unc-51-like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1) pathway, which has previously been shown to influence STING function, was potently able to suppress STING (R284S) activity to alleviate cytokine production. Our findings add to the growing list of inflammatory syndromes associated with spontaneous STING signaling and provide a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of STING-induced inflammatory disease.

Abstract: Summary
The supramammillary nucleus (SuM) of the hypothalamus projects to the dentate gyrus (DG) and the CA2 region of the hippocampus. Although the SuM-to-hippocampus circuits have been implicated in spatial and emotional memory formation, little is known about precise neural connections between the SuM and hippocampus. Here, we report that axons of SuM neurons make monosynaptic connections to granule cells (GCs) and GABAergic interneurons, but not to hilar mossy cells, in the DG and co-release glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at these synapses. Although inputs from the SuM can excite some interneurons, the inputs alone fail to generate spikes in GCs. However, despite the insufficient excitatory drive and GABAergic co-transmission, SuM inputs have net excitatory effects on GCs and can potentiate GC firing when temporally associated with perforant path inputs. Our results indicate that the SuM influences DG information processing by modulating GC outputs.

Abstract: The developmentally regulated GTP binding protein 2 (DRG2) is involved in the control of cell growth and differentiation. Here, we demonstrate that DRG2 regulates microtubule dynamics in HeLa cells. Analysis of live imaging of the plus-ends of microtubules with EB1-EGFP showed that DRG2 deficiency (shDRG2) significantly reduced the growth rate of HeLa cells. Depletion of DRG2 increased ‘slow and long-lived’ subpopulations, but decreased ‘fast and short-lived’ subpopulations of microtubules. Microtubule polymerization inhibitor exhibited a reduced response in shDRG2 cells. Using immunoprecipitation, we show that DRG2 interacts with tau, which regulates microtubule polymerization. Collectively, these data demonstrate that DRG2 may aid in affecting microtubule dynamics in HeLa cells.

Abstract: Summary
During immunological synapse (IS) formation, T cell receptor (TCR) signaling complexes, integrins, and costimulatory molecules exhibit a particular spatial localization. Here, we develop an agent-based model for the IS formation based on TCR peptide-bound major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) and leukocyte-function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) intracellular activation molecule 1 (ICAM-1) dynamics, including CD28 binding to a costimulatory ligand, coupling of molecules to the centripetal actin flow, and size-based segregation (SBS). A radial gradient of LFA-1 in the peripheral supramolecular activation cluster (pSMAC) toward the central supramolecular activation cluster (cSMAC) emerged as a combined consequence of actin binding and diffusion and modified the positioning of other molecules. The simulations predict a mechanism of CD28 movement, according to which CD28-CD80 complexes passively follow TCR-pMHC microclusters. However, the characteristic CD28-CD80 localization in a ring pattern around the cSMAC only emerges with a particular CD28-actin coupling strength that induces a centripetal motion. These results have implications for the understanding of T cell activation and fate decisions.

Abstract: Summary
The enhancer regions of the myogenic master regulator MyoD give rise to at least two enhancer RNAs. Core enhancer eRNA (CEeRNA) regulates transcription of the adjacent MyoD gene, whereas DRReRNA affects expression of Myogenin in trans. We found that DRReRNA is recruited at the Myogenin locus, where it colocalizes with Myogenin nascent transcripts. DRReRNA associates with the cohesin complex, and this association correlates with its transactivating properties. Despite being expressed in undifferentiated cells, cohesin is not loaded on Myogenin until the cells start expressing DRReRNA, which is then required for cohesin chromatin recruitment and maintenance. Functionally, depletion of either cohesin or DRReRNA reduces chromatin accessibility, prevents Myogenin activation, and hinders muscle cell differentiation. Thus, DRReRNA ensures spatially appropriate cohesin loading in trans to regulate gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is a serine/threonine kinase that coordinates the response to DNA double-strand breaks and oxidative stress. NKX3.1, a prostate-specific transcription factor, was recently shown to directly stimulate ATM kinase activity through its highly conserved homeodomain. Here, we show that other members of the homeodomain family can also regulate ATM kinase activity. We found that six representative homeodomain proteins (NKX3.1, NKX2.2, TTF1, NKX2.5, HOXB7, and CDX2) physically and functionally interact with ATM and with the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex that activates ATM in combination with DNA double-strand breaks. The binding between homeodomain proteins and ATM stimulates oxidation-induced ATM activation in vitro but inhibits ATM kinase activity in the presence of MRN and DNA and in human cells. These findings suggest that many tissue-specific homeodomain proteins may regulate ATM activity during development and differentiation and that this is a unique mechanism for the control of the DNA damage response.

Abstract: Summary
Adipocyte mobilization of fatty acids (lipolysis) is instrumental for energy expenditure. Lipolysis displays both spontaneous (basal) and hormone-stimulated activity. It is unknown if lipolysis is important for future body weight gain and associated disturbed glucose metabolism, and this was presently investigated in subcutaneous adipocytes from two female cohorts before and after ≥10-year follow-up. High basal and low stimulated lipolysis at baseline predicted future weight gain (odds ratios ≥4.6) as well as development of insulin resistance and impaired fasting glucose/type 2 diabetes (odds ratios ≥3.2). At baseline, weight gainers displayed lower adipose expression of several established lipolysis-regulating genes. Thus, inefficient lipolysis (high basal/low stimulated) involving altered gene expression is linked to future weight gain and impaired glucose metabolism and may constitute a treatment target. Finally, low stimulated lipolysis could be accurately estimated in vivo by simple clinical/biochemical measures and may be used to identify risk individuals for intensified preventive measures.

Abstract: Summary
Apolipoprotein A-I binding protein (AIBP) reduces lipid raft abundance by augmenting the removal of excess cholesterol from the plasma membrane. Here, we report that AIBP prevents and reverses processes associated with neuroinflammatory-mediated spinal nociceptive processing. The mechanism involves AIBP binding to Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) and increased binding of AIBP to activated microglia, which mediates selective regulation of lipid rafts in inflammatory cells. AIBP-mediated lipid raft reductions downregulate LPS-induced TLR4 dimerization, inflammatory signaling, and expression of cytokines in microglia. In mice, intrathecal injections of AIBP reduce spinal myeloid cell lipid rafts, TLR4 dimerization, neuroinflammation, and glial activation. Intrathecal AIBP reverses established allodynia in mice in which pain states were induced by the chemotherapeutic cisplatin, intraplantar formalin, or intrathecal LPS, all of which are pro-nociceptive interventions known to be regulated by TLR4 signaling. These findings demonstrate a mechanism by which AIBP regulates neuroinflammation and suggest the therapeutic potential of AIBP in treating preexisting pain states.

Abstract: Regenerative orthopedics needs significant devices to transplant human stem cells into damaged tissue and encourage automatic growth into replacements suitable for the human skeleton. Soft biomaterials have similarities in mechanical, structural and architectural properties to natural extracellular matrix (ECM), but often lack essential ECM molecules and signals. Here we engineer mineralized polysaccharide beads to transform MSCs into osteogenic cells and osteoid tissue for transplantation. Bone morphogenic proteins (BMP-2) and indispensable ECM proteins both directed differentiation inside alginate beads. Laminin and collagen IV basement membrane matrix proteins fixed and organized MSCs onto the alginate matrix, and BMP-2 drove differentiation, osteoid tissue self-assembly, and small-scale mineralization. Augmentation of alginate is necessary, and we showed that a few rationally selected small proteins from the basement membrane (BM) compartment of the ECM were sufficient to upregulate cell expression of Runx-2 and osteocalcin for osteoid formation, resulting in Alizarin red-positive mineral nodules. More significantly, nested BMP-2 and BM beads added to a non-union skull defect, self-generated osteoid expressing osteopontin (OPN) and osteocalcin (OCN) in a chain along the defect, at only four weeks, establishing a framework for complete regeneration expected in 6 and 12 weeks. Alginate beads are beneficial surgical devices for transplanting therapeutic cells in programmed (by the ECM components and alginate-chitosan properties) reaction environments ideal for promoting bone tissue.

Abstract: Patients with head and neck cancer are treated with therapeutic irradiation, which can result in irreversible salivary gland dysfunction. Because there is no complete cure for such patients, stem cell therapy is an emerging alternative for functional restoration of salivary glands. In this study, we investigated in vitro characteristics of primarily isolated epithelial cells from human salivary gland (Epi-SGs) and in vivo formation of acini-like structures by Epi-SGs. Primarily isolated Epi-SGs showed typical epithelial cell-like morphology and expressed E-cadherin but not N-cadherin. Epi-SGs expressed epithelial stem cell (EpiSC) and embryonic stem cell (ESC) markers. During long-term culture, the expression of EpiSC and ESC markers was highly detected and maintained within the core population with small size and low cytoplasmic complexity. The core population expressed cytokeratin 7 and cytokeratin 14, known as duct markers indicating that Epi-SGs might be originated from the duct. When Epi-SGs were transplanted in vivo with Matrigel, acini-like structures were readily formed at 4 days after transplantation and they were maintained at 7 days after transplantation. Taken together, our data suggested that Epi-SGs might contain stem cells which were positive for EpiSC and ESC markers, and Epi-SGs might contribute to the regeneration of acini-like structures in vivo. We expect that Epi-SGs will be useful source for the functional restoration of damaged salivary gland.

Abstract: Summary
Haired skin is a defining characteristic of mammals. However, some specialized skin regions, such as human palms, soles and ventral wrist, and mouse plantar foot, are entirely hairless. Using mouse plantar skin as a model system, we show that the endogenous secreted Wnt inhibitor DKK2 suppresses plantar hair follicle development and permits the formation of hairless skin. Plantar skin retains all of the mechanistic components needed for hair follicle development, as genetic deletion of Dkk2 permits formation of fully functional plantar hair follicles that give rise to external hair, contain sebaceous glands and a stem cell compartment, and undergo regenerative growth. In the absence of Dkk2, Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity is initially broadly elevated in embryonic plantar skin and gradually becomes patterned, mimicking follicular development in normally haired areas. These data provide a paradigm in which regionally restricted expression of a Wnt inhibitor underlies specification of hairless versus hairy skin.

Abstract: Summary
Lateral diffusion on the neuronal plasma membrane of the AMPA-type glutamate receptor (AMPAR) serves an important role in synaptic plasticity. We investigated the role of the secreted glycoprotein Noelin1 (Olfactomedin-1 or Pancortin) in AMPAR lateral mobility and its dependence on the extracellular matrix (ECM). We found that Noelin1 interacts with the AMPAR with high affinity, however, without affecting rise- and decay time and desensitization properties. Noelin1 co-localizes with synaptic and extra-synaptic AMPARs and is expressed at synapses in an activity-dependent manner. Single-particle tracking shows that Noelin1 reduces lateral mobility of both synaptic and extra-synaptic GluA1-containing receptors and affects short-term plasticity. While the ECM does not constrain the synaptic pool of AMPARs and acts only extrasynaptically, Noelin1 contributes to synaptic potentiation by limiting AMPAR mobility at synaptic sites. This is the first evidence for the role of a secreted AMPAR-interacting protein on mobility of GluA1-containing receptors and synaptic plasticity.

Abstract: Summary
Protein arginine methyltransferase 6 (PRMT6) catalyzes asymmetric dimethylation of histone H3 at arginine 2 (H3R2me2a). This mark has been reported to associate with silent genes. Here, we use a cell model of neural differentiation, which upon PRMT6 knockout exhibits proliferation and differentiation defects. Strikingly, we detect PRMT6-dependent H3R2me2a at active genes, both at promoter and enhancer sites. Loss of H3R2me2a from promoter sites leads to enhanced KMT2A binding and H3K4me3 deposition together with increased target gene transcription, supporting a repressive nature of H3R2me2a. At enhancers, H3R2me2a peaks co-localize with the active enhancer marks H3K4me1 and H3K27ac. Here, loss of H3R2me2a results in reduced KMT2D binding and H3K4me1/H3K27ac deposition together with decreased transcription of associated genes, indicating that H3R2me2a also exerts activation functions. Our work suggests that PRMT6 via H3R2me2a interferes with the deposition of adjacent histone marks and modulates the activity of important differentiation-associated genes by opposing transcriptional effects.

Abstract: Summary
YAP, a key effector of Hippo pathway, is activated by its translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus to regulate gene expression and promote tumorigenesis. Although the mechanism by which YAP is suppressed in cytoplasm has been well-studied, how the activated YAP is sequestered in the nucleus remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that YAP is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein and its nuclear export is controlled by SET1A-mediated mono-methylation of YAP at K342, which disrupts the binding of YAP to CRM1. YAP mimetic methylation knockin mice are more susceptible to colorectal tumorigenesis. Clinically, YAP K342 methylation is reversely correlated with cancer survival. Collectively, our study identifies SET1A-mediated mono-methylation at K342 as an essential regulatory mechanism for regulating YAP activity and tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Summary
RIG-I has a remarkable ability to specifically select viral 5′ppp dsRNAs for activation from a pool of cytosolic self-RNAs. The ATPase activity of RIG-I plays a role in RNA discrimination and activation, but the underlying mechanism was unclear. Using transient-state kinetics, we elucidated the ATPase-driven “kinetic proofreading” mechanism of RIG-I activation and RNA discrimination, akin to DNA polymerases, ribosomes, and T cell receptors. Even in the autoinhibited state of RIG-I, the C-terminal domain kinetically discriminates against self-RNAs by fast off rates. ATP binding facilitates dsRNA engagement but, interestingly, makes RIG-I promiscuous, explaining the constitutive signaling by Singleton-Merten syndrome-linked mutants that bind ATP without hydrolysis. ATP hydrolysis dissociates self-RNAs faster than 5′ppp dsRNA but, more importantly, drives RIG-I oligomerization through translocation, which we show to be regulated by helicase motif IVa. RIG-I translocates directionally from the dsRNA end into the stem region, and the 5′ppp end “throttles” translocation to provide a mechanism for threading and building a signaling-active oligomeric complex.

Abstract: Summary
Development of an effective vaccine became a worldwide priority after the devastating 2013–2016 Ebola disease outbreak. To qualitatively profile the humoral response against advanced filovirus vaccine candidates, we developed Domain Programmable Arrays (DPA), a systems serology platform to identify epitopes targeted after vaccination or filovirus infection. We optimized the assay using a panel of well-characterized monoclonal antibodies. After optimization, we utilized the system to longitudinally characterize the immunoglobulin (Ig) isotype-specific responses in non-human primates vaccinated with rVSV-ΔG-EBOV-glycoprotein (GP). Strikingly, we observed that, although the IgM response was directed against epitopes over the whole GP, the IgG and IgA responses were almost exclusively directed against the mucin-like domain (MLD) of the glycan cap. Further research will be needed to characterize this possible biased IgG and IgA response toward the MLD, but the results corroborate that DPA is a valuable tool to qualitatively measure the humoral response after vaccination.

Abstract: Summary
Clearance of dying cells is essential for development and homeostasis. Conserved genes mediate apoptotic cell removal, but whether these genes control non-apoptotic cell removal is a major open question. Linker cell-type death (LCD) is a prevalent non-apoptotic developmental cell death process with features conserved from C. elegans to vertebrates. Using microfluidics-based long-term in vivo imaging, we show that unlike apoptotic cells, the C. elegans linker cell, which dies by LCD, is competitively phagocytosed by two neighboring cells, resulting in cell splitting. Subsequent cell elimination does not require apoptotic engulfment genes. Rather, we find that RAB-35 GTPase is a key coordinator of competitive phagocytosis onset and cell degradation. RAB-35 binds CNT-1, an ARF-6 GTPase activating protein, and removes ARF-6, a degradation inhibitor, from phagosome membranes. This facilitates phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate removal from phagosome membranes, promoting phagolysosome maturation. Our studies suggest that RAB-35 and ARF-6 drive a conserved program eliminating cells dying by LCD.

Abstract: Summary
The modulator of retrovirus infection (MRI or CYREN) is a 30-kDa protein with a conserved N-terminal Ku-binding motif (KBM) and a C-terminal XLF-like motif (XLM). We show that MRI is intrinsically disordered and interacts with many DNA damage response (DDR) proteins, including the kinases ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and DNA-PKcs and the classical non-homologous end joining (cNHEJ) factors Ku70, Ku80, XRCC4, XLF, PAXX, and XRCC4. MRI forms large multimeric complexes that depend on its N and C termini and localizes to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), where it promotes the retention of DDR factors. Mice deficient in MRI and XLF exhibit embryonic lethality at a stage similar to those deficient in the core cNHEJ factors XRCC4 or DNA ligase IV. Moreover, MRI is required for cNHEJ-mediated DSB repair in XLF-deficient lymphocytes. We propose that MRI is an adaptor that, through multivalent interactions, increases the avidity of DDR factors to DSB-associated chromatin to promote cNHEJ.

Abstract: Summary
Functional networks in the mammalian cerebral cortex rely on the interaction between glutamatergic pyramidal cells and GABAergic interneurons. Both neuronal populations exhibit an extraordinary divergence in morphology and targeting areas, which ultimately dictate their precise function in cortical circuits. How these prominent morphological differences arise during development is not well understood. Here, we conducted a high-throughput screen for genes differentially expressed by pyramidal cells and interneurons during cortical wiring. We found that NEK7, a kinase involved in microtubule polymerization, is mostly expressed in parvalbumin (PV+) interneurons at the time when they establish their connectivity. Functional experiments revealed that NEK7-deficient PV+ interneurons show altered microtubule dynamics, axon growth cone steering and reduced axon length, arbor complexity, and total number of synaptic contacts formed with pyramidal cells. Altogether, our results reveal a molecular mechanism by which the microtubule-associated kinase NEK7 regulates the wiring of PV+ interneurons.

Abstract: Identification of various constituent layers such as epithelial, subepithelial, and keratin of oral mucosa and characterization of keratin pearls within keratin region as well, are the important and mandatory tasks for clinicians during the diagnosis of different stages in oral cancer (such as precancerous and cancerous). The architectural variations of epithelial layers and the presence of keratin pearls, which can be observed in microscopic images, are the key visual features in oral cancer diagnosis. The computer aided tool doing the same identification task would certainly provide crucial aid to clinicians for evaluation of histological images during diagnosis. In this paper, a two-stage approach is proposed for computing oral histology images, where 12-layered (7 × 7×3 channel patches) deep convolution neural network (CNN) are used for segmentation of constituent layers in the first stage and in the second stage the keratin pearls are detected from the segmented keratin regions using texture-based feature (Gabor filter) trained random forests. The performance of the proposed computing algorithm is tested in our developed oral cancer microscopic image database. The proposed texture-based random forest classifier has achieved 96.88% detection accuracy for detection of keratin pearls.

Abstract: Summary
Microglia, the tissue-resident macrophages of the CNS, represent major targets for therapeutic intervention in a wide variety of neurological disorders. Efficient reprogramming protocols to generate microglia-like cells in vitro using patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells will, however, require a precise understanding of the cellular and molecular events that instruct microglial cell fates. This remains a challenge since the developmental origin of microglia during embryogenesis is controversial. Here, using genetic tracing in zebrafish, we uncover primitive macrophages as the unique source of embryonic microglia. We also demonstrate that this initial population is transient, with primitive microglia later replaced by definitive microglia that persist throughout adulthood. The adult wave originates from cmyb-dependent hematopoietic stem cells. Collectively, our work challenges the prevailing model establishing erythro-myeloid progenitors as the sole and direct microglial precursor and provides further support for the existence of multiple waves of microglia, which originate from distinct hematopoietic precursors.

Abstract: Summary
The functional diversity of kinases enables specificity in cellular signal transduction. Yet how more than 500 members of the human kinome specifically receive regulatory inputs and convey information to appropriate substrates—all while using the common signaling output of phosphorylation—remains enigmatic. Here, we perform statistical co-evolution analysis, mutational scanning, and quantitative live-cell assays to reveal a hierarchical organization of the kinase domain that facilitates the orthogonal evolution of regulatory inputs and substrate outputs while maintaining catalytic function. We find that three quasi-independent “sectors”—groups of evolutionarily coupled residues—represent functional units in the kinase domain that encode for catalytic activity, substrate specificity, and regulation. Sector positions impact both disease and pharmacology: the catalytic sector is significantly enriched for somatic cancer mutations, and residues in the regulatory sector interact with allosteric kinase inhibitors. We propose that this functional architecture endows the kinase domain with inherent regulatory plasticity.

Abstract: Summary
The control of cell fate is an epigenetic process initiated by transcription factors (TFs) that recognize DNA motifs and recruit activator complexes and transcriptional machineries to chromatin. Lineage specificity is thought to be provided solely by TF-motif pairing, while the recruited activators are passive. Here, we show that INTS13, a subunit of the Integrator complex, operates as monocytic/macrophagic differentiation factor. Integrator is a general activator of transcription at coding genes and is required for eRNA maturation. Here, we show that INTS13 functions as an independent sub-module and targets enhancers through Early Growth Response (EGR1/2) TFs and their co-factor NAB2. INTS13 binds poised monocytic enhancers eliciting chromatin looping and activation. Independent depletion of INTS13, EGR1, or NAB2 impairs monocytic differentiation of cell lines and primary human progenitors. Our data demonstrate that Integrator is not functionally homogeneous and has TF-specific regulatory potential, revealing a new enhancer regulatory axis that controls myeloid differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Legionella pneumophila elicits caspase-11-driven macrophage pyroptosis through guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) encoded on chromosome 3. It has been proposed that microbe-driven IFN upregulates GBPs to facilitate pathogen vacuole rupture and bacteriolysis preceding caspase-11 activation. We show here that macrophage death occurred independently of microbial-induced IFN signaling and that GBPs are dispensable for pathogen vacuole rupture. Instead, the host-intrinsic IFN status sustained sufficient GBP expression levels to drive caspase-1 and caspase-11 activation in response to cytosol-exposed bacteria. In addition, endogenous GBP levels were sufficient for the release of DNA from cytosol-exposed bacteria, preceding the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase/stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS/STING) pathway for Ifnb induction. Mice deficient for chromosome 3 GBPs were unable to mount a rapid IL-1/chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1) response during Legionella-induced pneumonia, with defective bacterial clearance. Our results show that rapid GBP activity is controlled by host-intrinsic cytokine signaling and that GBP activities precede immune amplification responses, including IFN induction, inflammasome activation, and cell death.

Abstract: Summary
Signal transmission among cells enables long-range coordination in biological systems. However, the scarcity of quantitative measurements hinders the development of theories that relate signal propagation to cellular heterogeneity and spatial organization. We address this problem in a bacterial community that employs electrochemical cell-to-cell communication. We developed a model based on percolation theory, which describes how signals propagate through a heterogeneous medium. Our model predicts that signal transmission becomes possible when the community is organized near a critical phase transition between a disconnected and a fully connected conduit of signaling cells. By measuring population-level signal transmission with single-cell resolution in wild-type and genetically modified communities, we confirm that the spatial distribution of signaling cells is organized at the predicted phase transition. Our findings suggest that at this critical point, the population-level benefit of signal transmission outweighs the single-cell level cost. The bacterial community thus appears to be organized according to a theoretically predicted spatial heterogeneity that promotes efficient signal transmission.

Abstract: Summary
The tandem duplicator phenotype (TDP) is a genome-wide instability configuration primarily observed in breast, ovarian, and endometrial carcinomas. Here, we stratify TDP tumors by classifying their tandem duplications (TDs) into three span intervals, with modal values of 11 kb, 231 kb, and 1.7 Mb, respectively. TDPs with ∼11 kb TDs feature loss of TP53 and BRCA1. TDPs with ∼231 kb and ∼1.7 Mb TDs associate with CCNE1 pathway activation and CDK12 disruptions, respectively. We demonstrate that p53 and BRCA1 conjoint abrogation drives TDP induction by generating short-span TDP mammary tumors in genetically modified mice lacking them. Lastly, we show how TDs in TDP tumors disrupt heterogeneous combinations of tumor suppressors and chromatin topologically associating domains while duplicating oncogenes and super-enhancers.

Abstract: Summary
Enhancer profiling is a powerful approach for discovering cis-regulatory elements that define the core transcriptional regulatory circuits of normal and malignant cells. Gene control through enhancer activity is often dominated by a subset of lineage-specific transcription factors. By integrating measures of chromatin accessibility and enrichment for H3K27 acetylation, we have generated regulatory landscapes of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) samples and representative cell lines. With super enhancer-based modeling of regulatory circuits and assessments of transcription factor dependencies, we discover that the essential super enhancer factor PAX5 dominates CLL regulatory nodes and is essential for CLL cell survival. Targeting enhancer signaling via BET bromodomain inhibition disrupts super enhancer-dependent gene expression with selective effects on CLL core regulatory circuitry, conferring potent anti-tumor activity.

Abstract: Liver transplantation is recommended for patients with liver failure, but liver donors are limited. This necessitates the development of artificial livers, and hepatocytes are necessary to develop such artificial livers. Although induced hepatocyte-like cells are used in artificial livers, the characteristics of mouse induced hepatocyte-like cells (miHeps) reprogrammed with embryonic fibroblasts have not yet been clarified. Therefore, this study investigated the mechanisms underlying the survival, function, and death of miHeps. miHeps showed decreased cell viability, increased cytotoxicity, decreased hepatic function, and albumin and urea secretion at passage 14. Addition of necrostatin-1 (NEC-1) to miHeps inhibited necrosome formation and reactive oxygen species generation and increased cell survival. However, NEC-1 did not affect the hepatic function of miHeps. These results provide a basis for development of artificial livers using hepatocytes.

Abstract: Summary
The BRCA1 tumor suppressor preserves genome integrity through both homology-directed repair (HDR) and stalled fork protection (SFP). In vivo, BRCA1 exists as a heterodimer with the BARD1 tumor suppressor, and both proteins harbor a phosphate-binding BRCT domain. Here, we compare mice with mutations that ablate BRCT phospho-recognition by Bard1 (Bard1S563F and Bard1K607A) or Brca1 (Brca1S1598F). Brca1S1598F abrogates both HDR and SFP, suggesting that both pathways are likely impaired in most BRCA1 mutant tumors. Although not affecting HDR, the Bard1 mutations ablate poly(ADP-ribose)-dependent recruitment of BRCA1/BARD1 to stalled replication forks, resulting in fork degradation and chromosome instability. Nonetheless, Bard1S563F/S563F and Bard1K607A/K607A mice, unlike Brca1S1598F/S1598F mice, are not tumor prone, indicating that HDR alone is sufficient to suppress tumor formation in the absence of SFP. Nevertheless, because SFP, unlike HDR, is also impaired in heterozygous Brca1/Bard1 mutant cells, SFP and HDR may contribute to distinct stages of tumorigenesis in BRCA1/BARD1 mutation carriers.

Abstract: Summary
Drosophila tumor suppressor genes have revealed molecular pathways that control tissue growth, but mechanisms that regulate mitogenic signaling are far from understood. Here we report that the Drosophila TSG tumorous imaginal discs (tid), whose phenotypes were previously attributed to mutations in a DnaJ-like chaperone, are in fact driven by the loss of the N-linked glycosylation pathway component ALG3. tid/alg3 imaginal discs display tissue growth and architecture defects that share characteristics of both neoplastic and hyperplastic mutants. Tumorous growth is driven by inhibited Hippo signaling, induced by excess Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity. We show that ectopic JNK activation is caused by aberrant glycosylation of a single protein, the fly tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor homolog, which results in increased binding to the continually circulating TNF. Our results suggest that N-linked glycosylation sets the threshold of TNF receptor signaling by modifying ligand-receptor interactions and that cells may alter this modification to respond appropriately to physiological cues.

Abstract: Summary
Insect herbivory causes severe damage to plants and threatens the world’s food production. During evolutionary adaptation, plants have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to rapidly accumulate a key defense hormone, jasmonate (JA), that triggers plant defense against herbivory. However, little is known about how plants initially activate JA biosynthesis at encounter with herbivory. Here, we uncover that a novel JAV1-JAZ8-WRKY51 (JJW) complex controls JA biosynthesis to defend against insect attack. In healthy plants, the JJW complex represses JA biosynthesis to restrain JA at a low basal level to ensure proper plant growth. When plants are injured by insect attack, injury rapidly triggers calcium influxes to activate calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of JAV1, which disintegrates JJW complex and activates JA biosynthesis, giving rise to the rapid burst of JA for plant defense. Our findings offer new insights into the highly sophisticated defense systems evolved by plants to defend against herbivory.

Abstract: Summary
The neuromodulator dopamine (DA) plays a key role in motor control, motivated behaviors, and higher-order cognitive processes. Dissecting how these DA neural networks tune the activity of local neural circuits to regulate behavior requires tools for manipulating small groups of DA neurons. To address this need, we assembled a genetic toolkit that allows for an exquisite level of control over the DA neural network in Drosophila. To further refine targeting of specific DA neurons, we also created reagents that allow for the conversion of any existing GAL4 line into Split GAL4 or GAL80 lines. We demonstrated how this toolkit can be used with recently developed computational methods to rapidly generate additional reagents for manipulating small subsets or individual DA neurons. Finally, we used the toolkit to reveal a dynamic interaction between a small subset of DA neurons and rearing conditions in a social space behavioral assay.

Abstract: Summary
Legionella pneumophila translocates the largest known arsenal of over 330 pathogenic factors, called “effectors,” into host cells during infection, enabling L. pneumophila to establish a replicative niche inside diverse amebas and human macrophages. Here, we reveal that the L. pneumophila effectors MavC (Lpg2147) and MvcA (Lpg2148) are structural homologs of cycle inhibiting factor (Cif) effectors and that the adjacent gene, lpg2149, produces a protein that directly inhibits their activity. In contrast to canonical Cifs, both MavC and MvcA contain an insertion domain and deamidate the residue Gln40 of ubiquitin but not Gln40 of NEDD8. MavC and MvcA are functionally diverse, with only MavC interacting with the human E2-conjugating enzyme UBE2N (Ubc13). MavC deamidates the UBE2N∼Ub conjugate, disrupting Lys63 ubiquitination and dampening NF-κB signaling. Combined, our data reveal a molecular mechanism of host manipulation by pathogenic bacteria and highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms integral to L. pneumophila’s pathogenic strategy.

Abstract: Summary
Protruding from the apical surface of inner ear sensory cells, hair bundles carry out mechanotransduction. Bundle growth involves sequential and overlapping cellular processes, which are concealed within gene expression profiles of individual cells. To dissect such processes, we developed CellTrails, a tool for uncovering, analyzing, and visualizing single-cell gene-expression dynamics. Utilizing quantitative gene-expression data for key bundle proteins from single cells of the developing chick utricle, we reconstructed de novo a bifurcating trajectory that spanned from progenitor cells to mature striolar and extrastriolar hair cells. Extraction and alignment of developmental trails and association of pseudotime with bundle length measurements linked expression dynamics of individual genes with bundle growth stages. Differential trail analysis revealed high-resolution dynamics of transcripts that control striolar and extrastriolar bundle development, including those that encode proteins that regulate [Ca2+]i or mediate crosslinking and lengthening of actin filaments.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer metastasis accounts for the majority of cancer-related deaths and remains a clinical challenge. Metastatic cancer cells generally resemble cells of the primary cancer, but they may be influenced by the milieu of the organs they colonize. Here, we show that colorectal cancer cells undergo metabolic reprogramming after they metastasize and colonize the liver, a key metabolic organ. In particular, via GATA6, metastatic cells in the liver upregulate the enzyme aldolase B (ALDOB), which enhances fructose metabolism and provides fuel for major pathways of central carbon metabolism during tumor cell proliferation. Targeting ALDOB or reducing dietary fructose significantly reduces liver metastatic growth but has little effect on the primary tumor. Our findings suggest that metastatic cells can take advantage of reprogrammed metabolism in their new microenvironment, especially in a metabolically active organ such as the liver. Manipulation of involved pathways may affect the course of metastatic growth.

Abstract: Summary
Cranial motor nuclei in the brainstem innervate diverse types of head and neck muscles. Failure in establishing these neuromuscular connections causes congenital cranial dysinnervation disorders (CCDDs) characterized by abnormal craniofacial movements. However, mechanisms that link cranial motor nuclei to target muscles are poorly understood at the molecular level. Here, we report that protocadherin-mediated repulsion mediates neuromuscular connection in the ocular motor system in zebrafish. We identify pools of abducens motor neurons that are topographically arranged according to soma size and convergently innervate a single muscle. Disruptions of Duane retraction syndrome-associated transcription factors reveal that these neurons require Mafba/MAFB, but not Sall4/SALL4, for differentiation. Furthermore, genetic perturbations of Pcdh17/protocadherin-17 result in defective axon growth and soma clumping, thereby abolishing neuromuscular connectivity. Our results suggest that protocadherin-mediated repulsion forms the central topography and efferent projection pattern of the abducens nucleus following Mafba-dependent specification and imply potential involvement of protocadherins in CCDD etiology.

Abstract: Summary
Epithelial tissues can elongate in two dimensions by polarized cell intercalation, oriented cell division, or cell shape change, owing to local or global actomyosin contractile forces acting in the plane of the tissue. In addition, epithelia can undergo morphogenetic change in three dimensions. We show that elongation of the wings and legs of Drosophila involves a columnar-to-cuboidal cell shape change that reduces cell height and expands cell width. Remodeling of the apical extracellular matrix by the Stubble protease and basal matrix by MMP1/2 proteases induces wing and leg elongation. Matrix remodeling does not occur in the haltere, a limb that fails to elongate. Limb elongation is made anisotropic by planar polarized Myosin-II, which drives convergent extension along the proximal-distal axis. Subsequently, Myosin-II relocalizes to lateral membranes to accelerate columnar-to-cuboidal transition and isotropic tissue expansion. Thus, matrix remodeling induces dynamic changes in actomyosin contractility to drive epithelial morphogenesis in three dimensions.

Abstract: Summary
The bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) capitalizes on natural killer (NK) cell production of regulatory interleukin (IL)-10 to establish severe systemic infections. Here, we identify regulators of this IL-10 secretion. We show that IL-18 signals to NK cells license their ability to produce IL-10. IL-18 acts independent of IL-12 and STAT4, which co-stimulate IFNγ secretion. Dendritic cell (DC) expression of Nlrp3 is required for IL-18 release in response to the Lm p60 virulence protein. Therefore, mice lacking Nlrp3, Il18, or Il18R fail to accumulate serum IL-10 and are highly resistant to systemic Lm infection. We further show that cells expressing or dependent on Batf3 are required for IL-18-inducing IL-10 production observed in infected mice. These findings explain how Il18 and Batf3 promote susceptibility to bacterial infection and demonstrate the ability of Lm to exploit NLRP3 for the promotion of regulatory NK cell activity.

Abstract: Summary
During development, neurons undergo apoptosis if they do not receive adequate trophic support from tissues they innervate or when detrimental factors activate the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) at their axon ends. Trophic factor deprivation (TFD) or activation of p75NTR in distal axons results in a retrograde degenerative signal. However, the nature of this signal and the regulation of its transport are poorly understood. Here, we identify p75NTR intracellular domain (ICD) and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) as part of a retrograde pro-apoptotic signal generated in response to TFD or ligand binding to p75NTR in sympathetic neurons. We report an unconventional function of HDAC1 in retrograde transport of a degenerative signal and its constitutive presence in sympathetic axons. HDAC1 deacetylates dynactin subunit p150Glued, which enhances its interaction with dynein. These findings define p75NTR ICD as a retrograde degenerative signal and reveal p150Glued deacetylation as a unique mechanism regulating axonal transport.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer cell survival is dependent on oxidative-stress defenses against reactive oxygen species (ROS) that accumulate during tumorigenesis. Here, we show a non-canonical oxidative-stress defense mechanism through TRPA1, a neuronal redox-sensing Ca2+-influx channel. In TRPA1-enriched breast and lung cancer spheroids, TRPA1 is critical for survival of inner cells that exhibit ROS accumulation. Moreover, TRPA1 promotes resistance to ROS-producing chemotherapies, and TRPA1 inhibition suppresses xenograft tumor growth and enhances chemosensitivity. TRPA1 does not affect redox status but upregulates Ca2+-dependent anti-apoptotic pathways. NRF2, an oxidant-defense transcription factor, directly controls TRPA1 expression, thus providing an orthogonal mechanism for protection against oxidative stress together with canonical ROS-neutralizing mechanisms. These findings reveal an oxidative-stress defense program involving TRPA1 that could be exploited for targeted cancer therapies.

Abstract: Summary
The endoribonuclease RNase E is a principal factor in RNA turnover and processing that helps to exercise fine control of gene expression in bacteria. While its catalytic activity can be strongly influenced by the chemical identity of the 5′ end of RNA substrates, the enzyme can also cleave numerous substrates irrespective of the chemistry of their 5′ ends through a mechanism that has remained largely unexplained. We report structural and functional data illuminating details of both operational modes. Our crystal structure of RNase E in complex with the sRNA RprA reveals a duplex recognition site that saddles an inter-protomer surface to help present substrates for cleavage. Our data also reveal an autoinhibitory pocket that modulates the overall activity of the ribonuclease. Taking these findings together, we propose how RNase E uses versatile modes of RNA recognition to achieve optimal activity and specificity.

Abstract: Summary
Histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) are important genomic regulators often studied by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), whereby their locations and relative abundance are inferred by antibody capture of nucleosomes and associated DNA. However, the specificity of antibodies within these experiments has not been systematically studied. Here, we use histone peptide arrays and internally calibrated ChIP (ICeChIP) to characterize 52 commercial antibodies purported to distinguish the H3K4 methylforms (me1, me2, and me3, with each ascribed distinct biological functions). We find that many widely used antibodies poorly distinguish the methylforms and that high- and low-specificity reagents can yield dramatically different biological interpretations, resulting in substantial divergence from the literature for numerous H3K4 methylform paradigms. Using ICeChIP, we also discern quantitative relationships between enhancer H3K4 methylation and promoter transcriptional output and can measure global PTM abundance changes. Our results illustrate how poor antibody specificity contributes to the “reproducibility crisis,” demonstrating the need for rigorous, platform-appropriate validation.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription is an episodic process characterized by probabilistic bursts, but how the transcriptional noise from these bursts is modulated by cellular physiology remains unclear. Using simulations and single-molecule RNA counting, we examined how cellular processes influence cell-to-cell variability (noise). The results show that RNA noise is higher in the cytoplasm than the nucleus in ∼85% of genes across diverse promoters, genomic loci, and cell types (human and mouse). Measurements show further amplification of RNA noise in the cytoplasm, fitting a model of biphasic mRNA conversion between translation- and degradation-competent states. This multi-state translation-degradation of mRNA also causes substantial noise amplification in protein levels, ultimately accounting for ∼74% of intrinsic protein variability in cell populations. Overall, the results demonstrate how noise from transcriptional bursts is intrinsically amplified by mRNA processing, leading to a large super-Poissonian variability in protein levels.

Abstract: Summary
Flux through kinase and ubiquitin-driven signaling systems depends on the modification kinetics, stoichiometry, primary site specificity, and target abundance within the pathway, yet we rarely understand these parameters and their spatial organization within cells. Here we develop temporal digital snapshots of ubiquitin signaling on the mitochondrial outer membrane in embryonic stem cell-derived neurons, and we model HeLa cell systems upon activation of the PINK1 kinase and PARKIN ubiquitin ligase by proteomic counting of ubiquitylation and phosphorylation events. We define the kinetics and site specificity of PARKIN-dependent target ubiquitylation, and we demonstrate the power of this approach to quantify pathway modulators and to mechanistically define the role of PARKIN UBL phosphorylation in pathway activation in induced neurons. Finally, through modulation of pS65-Ub on mitochondria, we demonstrate that Ub hyper-phosphorylation is inhibitory to mitophagy receptor recruitment, indicating that pS65-Ub stoichiometry in vivo is optimized to coordinate PARKIN recruitment via pS65-Ub and mitophagy receptors via unphosphorylated chains.

Abstract: Summary
The oligodendrocyte lineage is responsible for myelination of the central nervous system. Post-translational modifications are known to regulate oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation into mature myelinating oligodendrocytes. The role of arginine methylation during oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination is still poorly understood. We generated mice depleted of PRMT5 in OPCs using Olig2-Cre, and these mice developed severe hypomyelination and died at the third post-natal week. PRMT5-deficient cells have lower levels of PDGFRα at the plasma membrane due to increased degradation by the Cbl E3 ligase. Mechanistically, the loss of arginine methylation at R554 of the PDGFRα intracellular domain unmasks a Cbl binding site at Y555. We observed the progressive decrease in PRMT5 during oligodendrocyte differentiation, and we show that one role of this decrease is to downregulate growth signals provided by PDGFRα to initiate oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination. More broadly, the inhibition of PRMT5 may be used therapeutically to manipulate PDGFRα bioavailability.

Abstract: Summary
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by aberrant accumulation of collagen-secreting myofibroblasts. Development of effective therapies is limited due to incomplete understanding of molecular mechanisms regulating myofibroblast expansion. FOXF1 transcription factor is expressed in resident lung fibroblasts, but its role in lung fibrosis remains unknown due to the lack of genetic mouse models. Through comprehensive analysis of human IPF genomics data, lung biopsies, and transgenic mice with fibroblast-specific inactivation of FOXF1, we show that FOXF1 inhibits pulmonary fibrosis. FOXF1 deletion increases myofibroblast invasion and collagen secretion and promotes a switch from N-cadherin (CDH2) to Cadherin-11 (CDH11), which is a critical step in the acquisition of the pro-fibrotic phenotype. FOXF1 directly binds to Cdh2 and Cdh11 promoters and differentially regulates transcription of these genes. Re-expression of CDH2 or inhibition of CDH11 in FOXF1-deficient cells reduces myofibroblast invasion in vitro. FOXF1 inhibits pulmonary fibrosis by regulating a switch from CDH2 to CDH11 in lung myofibroblasts.

Abstract: Summary
Sepsis and septic shock are associated with life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by an impaired host response to infections. Although circadian clock disturbance impairs the early inflammatory response, its impact on post-septic immunosuppression remains poorly elucidated. Here, we show that Bmal1, a core circadian clock gene, plays a role in the regulation of host immune responses in experimental sepsis. Mechanistically, Bmal1 deficiency in macrophages increases PKM2 expression and lactate production, which is required for expression of the immune checkpoint protein PD-L1 in a STAT1-dependent manner. Consequently, targeted ablation of Pkm2 in myeloid cells or administration of anti-PD-L1-neutralizing antibody or supplementation with recombinant interleukin-7 (IL-7) facilitates microbial clearance, inhibits T cell apoptosis, reduces multiple organ dysfunction, and reduces septic death in Bmal1-deficient mice. Collectively, these findings suggest that the circadian clock controls the immune checkpoint pathway in macrophages and therefore represents a potential therapeutic target for lethal infection.

Abstract: Eukaryotic elongation factors 2 (eEF2) plays an essential role in the GTP-dependent translocation of the ribosome along mRNA. Previous studies have shown that eEF2 is overexpressed in various tumors. However, little is known about the role of eEF2 in ovarian cancer. The aim of the present study is to examine the effect of eEF2 on ovarian cancer proliferation. We first measured eEF2 protein expression by western blot using six fresh ovarian cancer tissues from G1 to G3. The results showed that eEF2 expression gradually increased from G1 to G3. Additionally, eEF2 expression correlated significantly with grade (P = 0.045), FIGO stage (P = 0.035) and Ki67 (P < 0.05). Additionally, there was a significant positive association between eEF2 expression and Ki67 (r = 0.855). Cox’s proportional hazards model also showed that eEF2 (P = 0.004) and Ki67 (P < 0.001) were an independent prognostic factor of overall survival in ovarian cancer patients. In vitro, after the release of ovarian cancer cell line (HO8910) from serum starvation, the expression of eEF2, cyclinD1 and PCNA was up-regulated. Moreover, silencing eEF2 in HO8910 cells decreased cell proliferation. Finally, we hypothesize that eEF2 may be activated in a positive feedback cycle through inactivation of eEF2K via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. These data provide novel insights into developing experimental therapies for ovarian cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a metabolic hormone with pleiotropic effects on glucose and lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity. However, the role of FGF21 in hypertension remains elusive. Here we show that FGF21 deficiency significantly exacerbates angiotensin II-induced hypertension and vascular dysfunction, whereas such negative effects are reversed by replenishment of FGF21. Mechanistically, FGF21 acts on adipocytes and renal cells to promote induction of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which in turn converts angiotensin II to angiotensin-(1–7), then inhibits hypertension and reverses vascular damage. In addition, ACE2 deficiency strikingly abrogates these beneficial effects of FGF21 in mice, including alleviation of angiotensin II-associated hypertension and vascular damage. Otherwise, pharmaceutical inhibition of angiotensin-(1–7) attenuates the protective effect of FGF21 on angiotensin II-induced vascular dysfunction, but not on hypertension. Thus, FGF21 protects against angiotensin II-induced hypertension and vascular impairment by activation of the ACE2/angiotensin-(1–7) axis via fine-tuning the multi-organ crosstalk between liver, adipose tissue, kidney, and blood vessels.

Abstract: Summary
Sensory perception depends on interactions among cortical areas. These interactions are mediated by canonical patterns of connectivity in which higher areas send feedback projections to lower areas via neurons in superficial and deep layers. Here, we probed the circuit basis of interactions among two areas critical for touch perception in mice, whisker primary (wS1) and secondary (wS2) somatosensory cortices. Neurons in layer 4 of wS2 (S2L4) formed a major feedback pathway to wS1. Feedback from wS2 to wS1 was organized somatotopically. Spikes evoked by whisker deflections occurred nearly as rapidly in wS2 as in wS1, including among putative S2L4 → S1 feedback neurons. Axons from S2L4 → S1 neurons sent stimulus orientation-specific activity to wS1. Optogenetic excitation of S2L4 neurons modulated activity across both wS2 and wS1, while inhibition of S2L4 reduced orientation tuning among wS1 neurons. Thus, a non-canonical feedback circuit, originating in layer 4 of S2, rapidly modulates early tactile processing.

Abstract: Summary
The emergence of influenza A viruses (IAVs) from zoonotic reservoirs poses a great threat to human health. As seasonal vaccines are ineffective against zoonotic strains, and newly transmitted viruses can quickly acquire drug resistance, there remains a need for host-directed therapeutics against IAVs. Here, we performed a genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen in human lung epithelial cells with a human isolate of an avian H5N1 strain. Several genes involved in sialic acid biosynthesis and related glycosylation pathways were highly enriched post-H5N1 selection, including SLC35A1, a sialic acid transporter essential for IAV receptor expression and thus viral entry. Importantly, we have identified capicua (CIC) as a negative regulator of cell-intrinsic immunity, as loss of CIC resulted in heightened antiviral responses and restricted replication of multiple viruses. Therefore, our study demonstrates that the CRISPR/Cas9 system can be utilized for the discovery of host factors critical for the replication of intracellular pathogens.

Abstract: Summary
Although EZH2 enzymatic inhibitors have shown antitumor effects in EZH2-mutated lymphoma and ARID1A-mutated ovarian cancer, many cancers do not respond because EZH2 can promote cancer independently of its histone methyltransferase activity. Here we identify ZRANB1 as the EZH2 deubiquitinase. ZRANB1 binds, deubiquitinates, and stabilizes EZH2. Depletion of ZRANB1 in breast cancer cells results in EZH2 destabilization and growth inhibition. Systemic delivery of ZRANB1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) leads to marked antitumor and antimetastatic effects in preclinical models of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Intriguingly, a small-molecule inhibitor of ZRANB1 destabilizes EZH2 and inhibits the viability of TNBC cells. In patients with breast cancer, ZRANB1 levels correlate with EZH2 levels and poor survival. These findings suggest the therapeutic potential for targeting the EZH2 deubiquitinase ZRANB1.

Abstract: Intestinal epithelium develops during gestation and continues to mature post-natally into a selective barrier that will protect the individual while still allowing passage of nutrients. Until fully mature, the risk of translocation of microorganisms, toxins or antigens into the sub-epithelial tissue is high and could result in pathologies with life-altering consequences, or even premature death. Because of their monogamous mating system, prairie voles are an emerging model for studying the role of the intestinal microbiota in modulating social behavior via the microbiota-gut-brain-behavior axis. However, knowledge about the voles’ intestinal barrier maturation is lacking. Understanding the maturation of the intestine epithelial barrier can complement the extensive behavioral literature for future studies involving the vole gut-brain axis. In this study, we characterized intestinal barrier function by demonstrating that two-week-old prairie voles have high paracellular absorption of FITC-dextran molecules prior to markedly decreased permeability at three weeks of age. In light of the fundamental role of tight junctions in maintaining epithelial integrity regulating intestinal permeability, we examined tight junction gene expression profiles. Transmission electron microscopy was used to visualize tight junction structure. Our results provide a timeline for intestinal barrier maturation and point to tight junction proteins involved in this process in prairie voles.

Abstract: Summary
The structural and functional plasticity of synapses is critical for learning and memory. Long-term potentiation (LTP) induction promotes spine growth and AMPAR accumulation at excitatory synapses, leading to increased synaptic strength. Glutamate initiates these processes, but the contribution from extracellular modulators is not fully established. Wnts are required for spine formation; however, their impact on activity-mediated spine plasticity and AMPAR localization is unknown. We found that LTP induction rapidly increased synaptic Wnt7a/b protein levels. Acute blockade of endogenous Wnts or loss of postsynaptic Frizzled-7 (Fz7) receptors impaired LTP-mediated synaptic strength, spine growth, and AMPAR localization at synapses. Live imaging of SEP-GluA1 and single-particle tracking revealed that Wnt7a rapidly promoted synaptic AMPAR recruitment and trapping. Wnt7a, through Fz7, induced CaMKII-dependent loss of SynGAP from spines and increased extrasynaptic AMPARs by PKA phosphorylation. We identify a critical role for Wnt-Fz7 signaling in LTP-mediated synaptic accumulation of AMPARs and spine plasticity.

Abstract: Summary
Damage to and loss of glomerular podocytes has been identified as the culprit lesion in progressive kidney diseases. Here, we combine mass spectrometry-based proteomics with mRNA sequencing, bioinformatics, and hypothesis-driven studies to provide a comprehensive and quantitative map of mammalian podocytes that identifies unanticipated signaling pathways. Comparison of the in vivo datasets with proteomics data from podocyte cell cultures showed a limited value of available cell culture models. Moreover, in vivo stable isotope labeling by amino acids uncovered surprisingly rapid synthesis of mitochondrial proteins under steady-state conditions that was perturbed under autophagy-deficient, disease-susceptible conditions. Integration of acquired omics dimensions suggested FARP1 as a candidate essential for podocyte function, which could be substantiated by genetic analysis in humans and knockdown experiments in zebrafish. This work exemplifies how the integration of multi-omics datasets can identify a framework of cell-type-specific features relevant for organ health and disease.

Abstract: Summary
Melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) are indispensable for non-image-forming visual responses that sustain under prolonged illumination. For sustained signaling of ipRGCs, the melanopsin photopigment must continuously regenerate. The underlying mechanism is unknown. We discovered that a cluster of Ser/Thr sites within the C-terminal region of mammalian melanopsin is phosphorylated after a light pulse. This forms a binding site for β-arrestin 1 (βARR1) and β-arrestin 2. β-arrestin 2 primarily regulates the deactivation of melanopsin; accordingly, βαrr2−/− mice exhibit prolonged ipRGC responses after cessation of a light pulse. β-arrestin 1 primes melanopsin for regeneration. Therefore, βαrr1−/− ipRGCs become desensitized after repeated or prolonged photostimulation. The lack of either β-arrestin attenuates ipRGC response under prolonged illumination, suggesting that β-arrestin 2-mediated deactivation and β-arrestin 1-dependent regeneration of melanopsin function in sequence. In conclusion, we discovered a molecular mechanism by which β-arrestins regulate different aspects of melanopsin photoresponses and allow ipRGC-sustained responses under prolonged illumination.

Abstract: Summary
The DNA helicase FANCJ is mutated in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and Fanconi anemia (FA). Nevertheless, how loss of FANCJ translates to disease pathogenesis remains unclear. We addressed this question by analyzing proteins associated with replication forks in cells with or without FANCJ. We demonstrate that FANCJ-knockout (FANCJ-KO) cells have alterations in the replisome that are consistent with enhanced replication stress, including an aberrant accumulation of the fork remodeling factor helicase-like transcription factor (HLTF). Correspondingly, HLTF contributes to fork degradation in FANCJ-KO cells. Unexpectedly, the unrestrained DNA synthesis that characterizes HLTF-deficient cells is FANCJ dependent and correlates with S1 nuclease sensitivity and fork degradation. These results suggest that FANCJ and HLTF promote replication fork integrity, in part by counteracting each other to keep fork remodeling and elongation in check. Indicating one protein compensates for loss of the other, loss of both HLTF and FANCJ causes a more severe replication stress response.

Abstract: Summary
The antagonistic pleiotropy theory hypothesizes that evolutionary adaptations maximizing the fitness in early age increase disease burden after reproduction. This theory remains largely untested at the molecular level. Here, we analyzed enhancer evolution in primates to investigate the relationships between aging-related diseases and enhancers acquired after the human-chimpanzee divergence. We report a 5-fold increased evolutionary rate of enhancers that are activated in neural tissues, leading to fixation of ∼100 human-specific enhancers potentially under adaptation. These enhancers show prognostic expression levels and correlations with driver genes in cancer, and their nearby genes are enriched in known loci associated with aging-related diseases. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we further functionally validated an enhancer on chr8p23.1 as activator counteracting REST, a master regulator known to be a transcriptional suppressor of Alzheimer disease. Our results suggest an evolutionary origin of aging-related diseases: the side effects of human-specific, neural-tissue expressed enhancers. Thus, adaptive molecular changes in human macroevolution may introduce vulnerabilities to disease development in modern populations.

Abstract: Summary
tRNAs are subject to numerous modifications, including methylation. Mutations in the human N7-methylguanosine (m7G) methyltransferase complex METTL1/WDR4 cause primordial dwarfism and brain malformation, yet the molecular and cellular function in mammals is not well understood. We developed m7G methylated tRNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq) and tRNA reduction and cleavage sequencing (TRAC-seq) to reveal the m7G tRNA methylome in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). A subset of 22 tRNAs is modified at a “RAGGU” motif within the variable loop. We observe increased ribosome occupancy at the corresponding codons in Mettl1 knockout mESCs, implying widespread effects on tRNA function, ribosome pausing, and mRNA translation. Translation of cell cycle genes and those associated with brain abnormalities is particularly affected. Mettl1 or Wdr4 knockout mESCs display defective self-renewal and neural differentiation. Our study uncovers the complexity of the mammalian m7G tRNA methylome and highlights its essential role in ESCs with links to human disease.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR-Cas13a enzymes are RNA-guided, RNA-activated RNases. Their properties have been exploited as powerful tools for RNA detection, RNA imaging, and RNA regulation. However, the relationship between target RNA binding and HEPN (higher eukaryotes and prokaryotes nucleotide binding) domain nuclease activation is poorly understood. Using sequencing experiments coupled with in vitro biochemistry, we find that Cas13a target RNA binding affinity and HEPN-nuclease activity are differentially affected by the number and the position of mismatches between the guide and the target. We identify a central binding seed for which perfect base pairing is required for target binding and a separate nuclease switch for which imperfect base pairing results in tight binding, but not HEPN-nuclease activation. These results demonstrate that the binding and cleavage activities of Cas13a are decoupled, highlighting a complex specificity landscape. Our findings underscore a need to consider the range of effects off-target recognition has on Cas13a RNA binding and cleavage behavior for RNA-targeting tool development.

Abstract: Summary
Chronic inflammation is a hallmark of obesity and is linked to the development of numerous diseases. The activation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) by long-chain saturated fatty acids (lcSFAs) is an important process in understanding how obesity initiates inflammation. While experimental evidence supports an important role for TLR4 in obesity-induced inflammation in vivo, via a mechanism thought to involve direct binding to and activation of TLR4 by lcSFAs, several lines of evidence argue against lcSFAs being direct TLR4 agonists. Using multiple orthogonal approaches, we herein provide evidence that while loss-of-function models confirm that TLR4 does, indeed, regulate lcSFA-induced inflammation, TLR4 is not a receptor for lcSFAs. Rather, we show that TLR4-dependent priming alters cellular metabolism, gene expression, lipid metabolic pathways, and membrane lipid composition, changes that are necessary for lcSFA-induced inflammation. These results reconcile previous discordant observations and challenge the prevailing view of TLR4's role in initiating obesity-induced inflammation.

Abstract: Icariside II (ICA II) is used in erectile dysfunction treatment. Adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) are efficient at improving erectile function. This study aimed to explore the action mechanism of ADSCs in improving erectile function. ADSCs were isolated from the adipose tissues of rats. Cell proliferation was determined using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. The expressions of mRNA and protein were determined separately through qRT-PCR and western blot. The endogenous expressions of related genes were regulated using recombinant plasmids and cell transfection. A Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay was performed to determine the interaction between miR-34a and STAT3. Rat models with bilateral cavernous nerve injuries (BCNIs) were used to assess erectile function through the detection of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and intracavernosal pressure (ICP). ICA II promoted ADSCs’ proliferation and differentiation to Schwann cells (SCs) through the inhibition of miR-34a. Suppressed miR-34a promoted the differentiation of ADSCs to SCs by upregulating STAT3. ICA II promoted the differentiation of ADSCs to SCs through the miR-34a/STAT3 pathway. The combination of ICA II and ADSCs preserved the erectile function of the BCNI model rats. ADSCs treated with ICA II markedly preserved the erectile function of the BCNI model rats, which was reversed through miR-34a overexpression. ICA II promotes the differentiation of ADSCs to SCs through the miR-34a/STAT3 pathway, contributing to erectile function preservation after the occurrence of a cavernous nerve injury.

Abstract: Summary
Glioma diagnosis is based on histomorphology and grading; however, such classification does not have predictive clinical outcome after glioblastomas have developed. To date, no bona fide biomarkers that significantly translate into a survival benefit to glioblastoma patients have been identified. We previously reported that the IDH mutant G-CIMP-high subtype would be a predecessor to the G-CIMP-low subtype. Here, we performed a comprehensive DNA methylation longitudinal analysis of diffuse gliomas from 77 patients (200 tumors) to enlighten the epigenome-based malignant transformation of initially lower-grade gliomas. Intra-subtype heterogeneity among G-CIMP-high primary tumors allowed us to identify predictive biomarkers for assessing the risk of malignant recurrence at early stages of disease. G-CIMP-low recurrence appeared in 9.5% of all gliomas, and these resembled IDH-wild-type primary glioblastoma. G-CIMP-low recurrence can be characterized by distinct epigenetic changes at candidate functional tissue enhancers with AP-1/SOX binding elements, mesenchymal stem cell-like epigenomic phenotype, and genomic instability. Molecular abnormalities of longitudinal G-CIMP offer possibilities to defy glioblastoma progression.

Abstract: Summary
The skin functions as the primary interface between the human body and the external environment. To understand how the microbiome varies within urban mass transit and influences the skin microbiota, we profiled the human palm microbiome after contact with handrails within the Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway (MTR) system. Intraday sampling time was identified as the primary determinant of the variation and recurrence of the community composition, whereas human-associated species and clinically important antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were captured as p.m. signatures. Line-specific signatures were notably correlated with line-specific environmental exposures and city characteristics. The sole cross-border line appeared as an outlier in most analyses and showed high relative abundance and a significant intraday increment of clinically important ARGs (24.1%), suggesting potential cross-border ARG transmission, especially for tetracycline and vancomycin resistance. Our study provides an important reference for future public health strategies to mitigate intracity and cross-border pathogen and ARG transmission.

Abstract: Angiogenesis must be precisely controlled because uncontrolled angiogenesis is involved in aggravation of disease symptoms. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) signaling is a key pathway leading to angiogenic responses in vascular endothelial cells (ECs). Therefore, targeting VEGF/VEGFR-2 signaling may be effective at modulating angiogenesis to alleviate various disease symptoms. Oleanolic acid was verified as a VEGFR-2 binding chemical from anticancer herbs with similar binding affinity as a reference drug in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 3CJG of model A coordination. Oleanolic acid effectively inhibited VEGF-induced VEGFR-2 activation and angiogenesis in HU-VECs without cytotoxicity. We also verified that oleanolic acid inhibits in vivo angiogenesis during the development and the course of the retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) model in the mouse retina. Taken together, our results suggest a potential therapeutic benefit of oleanolic acid for inhibiting angiogenesis in proangiogenic diseases, including retinopathy.

Abstract: Summary
Bacterial growth follows simple laws in constant conditions. However, bacteria in nature often face fluctuating environments. We therefore ask whether there are growth laws that apply to changing environments. We derive a law for upshifts using an optimal resource-allocation model: the post-shift growth rate equals the geometrical mean of the pre-shift growth rate and the growth rate on saturating carbon. We test this using chemostat and batch culture experiments, as well as previous data from several species. The increase in growth rate after an upshift indicates that ribosomes have spare capacity (SC). We demonstrate theoretically that SC has the cost of slow steady-state growth but is beneficial after an upshift because it prevents large overshoots in intracellular metabolites and allows rapid response to change. We also provide predictions for downshifts. The present study quantifies the optimal degree of SC, which rises the slower the growth rate, and suggests that SC can be precisely regulated.

Abstract: Summary
We elucidated genomic and transcriptomic changes that accompany the evolution of melanoma from pre-malignant lesions by sequencing DNA and RNA from primary melanomas and their adjacent precursors, as well as matched primary tumors and regional metastases. In total, we analyzed 230 histopathologically distinct areas of melanocytic neoplasia from 82 patients. Somatic alterations sequentially induced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activation, upregulation of telomerase, modulation of the chromatin landscape, G1/S checkpoint override, ramp-up of MAPK signaling, disruption of the p53 pathway, and activation of the PI3K pathway; no mutations were specifically associated with metastatic progression, as these pathways were perturbed during the evolution of primary melanomas. UV radiation-induced point mutations steadily increased until melanoma invasion, at which point copy-number alterations also became prevalent.

Abstract: Summary
Tracking antigen-specific T cell responses over time within individuals is difficult because of lack of knowledge of antigen-specific TCR sequences, limitations in sample size, and assay sensitivities. We hypothesized that analyses of high-throughput sequencing of TCR clonotypes could provide functional readouts of individuals’ immunological histories. Using high-throughput TCR sequencing, we develop a database of TCRβ sequences from large cohorts of mice before (naive) and after smallpox vaccination. We computationally identify 315 vaccine-associated TCR sequences (VATS) that are used to train a diagnostic classifier that distinguishes naive from vaccinated samples in mice up to 9 months post-vaccination with >99% accuracy. We determine that the VATS library contains virus-responsive TCRs by in vitro expansion assays and virus-specific tetramer sorting. These data outline a platform for advancing our capabilities to identify pathogen-specific TCR sequences, which can be used to identify and quantitate low-frequency pathogen-specific TCR sequences in circulation over time with exceptional sensitivity.

Abstract: Summary
Despite considerable efforts, no physical mechanism has been shown to explain N-terminal codon bias in prokaryotic genomes. Using a systematic study of synonymous substitutions in two endogenous E. coli genes, we show that interactions between the coding region and the upstream Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence modulate the efficiency of translation initiation, affecting both intracellular mRNA and protein levels due to the inherent coupling of transcription and translation in E. coli. We further demonstrate that far-downstream mutations can also modulate mRNA levels by occluding the SD sequence through the formation of non-equilibrium secondary structures. By contrast, a non-endogenous RNA polymerase that decouples transcription and translation largely alleviates the effects of synonymous substitutions on mRNA levels. Finally, a complementary statistical analysis of the E. coli genome specifically implicates avoidance of intra-molecular base pairing with the SD sequence. Our results provide general physical insights into the coding-level features that optimize protein expression in prokaryotes.

Abstract: Summary
Homeostasis in adult tissues depends on the precise regulation of stem cells and their surrounding microenvironments, or niches. Here, we show that the cell cycle inhibitor and tumor suppressor Retinoblastoma (RB) is a critical regulator of niche cells in the Drosophila testis. The testis contains a single niche, composed of somatic hub cells, that signals to adjacent germline and somatic stem cells. Hub cells are normally quiescent, but knockdown of the RB homolog Rbf in these cells causes them to proliferate and convert to somatic stem cells. Over time, mutant hub cell clusters enlarge and split apart, forming ectopic hubs surrounded by active stem cells. Furthermore, we show that Rbf’s ability to restrict niche number depends on the transcription factors E2F and Escargot and the adhesion molecule E-cadherin. Together this work reveals how precise modulation of niche cells, not only the stem cells they support, can drive regeneration and disease.

RIP2 Gates TRAF6 Interaction with Death Receptor p75NTR to Regulate Cerebellar Granule Neuron Survival,

Abstract: Summary
Cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) undergo programmed cell death during the first postnatal week of mouse development, coincident with sustained expression of the death receptor p75NTR. Although ablation of p75NTR does not affect CGN cell death, deletion of the downstream effector RIP2 significantly increases CGN apoptosis, resulting in reduced adult CGN number and impaired behaviors associated with cerebellar function. Remarkably, CGN death is restored to basal levels when p75NTR is deleted in RIP2-deficient mice. We find that RIP2 gates the signaling output of p75NTR by competing with TRAF6 for binding to the receptor intracellular domain. In CGNs lacking RIP2, more TRAF6 is associated with p75NTR, leading to increased JNK-dependent apoptosis. In agreement with this, pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of TRAF6 restores cell death levels in CGNs lacking RIP2. These results reveal an unexpected mechanism controlling CGN number and highlight how competitive interactions govern the logic of death receptor function.

Abstract: Nandrolone decanoate is an anabolic-androgenic steroid that is frequently used at a very high dose to improve the physical performance. Recently, this drug has been abused by athletes to augment their muscle mass and improve their physical performance. However, this could have an impact on other body systems with the potential increase in its harmful effect. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of administering a supraphysiological dose of nandrolone decanoate on the hepatic functions and structure of the adult rat and to test the potential reversibility after nandrolone withdrawal. Thirty adult male rats were equally divided into; control group, nandrolone-treated group (10 mg/kg/IM/weekly) for four weeks and recovery group (received nandrolone for four weeks followed by four weeks recovery). The results showed that nandrolone treatment led to a significant increase in the body weight gain and in the levels of serum alanine and aspartate transaminases. Moreover, the liver sections from nandrolone-treated rat showed; dilatation and congestion in the blood vessels, inflammatory cellular infiltration with hepatic fibrosis, severe vacuolar cytoplasmic degeneration, apoptotic hyperchromatic nuclei and partial loss of mitochondrial cristae in the hepatocytes. In addition, nandrolone treatment resulted in significant increase in the apoptotic index and the area percentage of GFAP positive stellate cells in the liver tissues. Importantly, withdrawal of nandrolone for 4 weeks rescued these biochemical and histological changes. In conclusion, our results showed that supraphysiological dose of nandrolone has hepatotoxic effects in the adult rat and showed that these toxic effects are reversible after treatment withdrawal.

Abstract: Summary
Skeletal muscle and brown adipose tissue (BAT) are functionally linked, as exercise increases browning via secretion of myokines. It is unknown whether BAT affects muscle function. Here, we find that loss of the transcription factor IRF4 in BAT (BATI4KO) reduces exercise capacity, mitochondrial function, ribosomal protein synthesis, and mTOR signaling in muscle and causes tubular aggregate formation. Loss of IRF4 induces myogenic gene expression in BAT, including the secreted factor myostatin, a known inhibitor of muscle function. Reducing myostatin via neutralizing antibodies or soluble receptor rescues the exercise capacity of BATI4KO mice. In addition, overexpression of IRF4 in brown adipocytes reduces serum myostatin and increases exercise capacity in muscle. Finally, mice housed at thermoneutrality have reduced IRF4 in BAT, lower exercise capacity, and elevated serum myostatin; these abnormalities are corrected by excising BAT. Collectively, our data point to an unsuspected level of BAT-muscle crosstalk driven by IRF4 and myostatin.

Abstract: Summary
Aberrant expression of HOXA9 is a prominent feature of acute leukemia driven by diverse oncogenes. Here we show that HOXA9 overexpression in myeloid and B progenitor cells leads to significant enhancer reorganizations with prominent emergence of leukemia-specific de novo enhancers. Alterations in the enhancer landscape lead to activation of an ectopic embryonic gene program. We show that HOXA9 functions as a pioneer factor at de novo enhancers and recruits CEBPα and the MLL3/MLL4 complex. Genetic deletion of MLL3/MLL4 blocks histone H3K4 methylation at de novo enhancers and inhibits HOXA9/MEIS1-mediated leukemogenesis in vivo. These results suggest that therapeutic targeting of HOXA9-dependent enhancer reorganization can be an effective therapeutic strategy in acute leukemia with HOXA9 overexpression.

Abstract: Plants have evolved strategies to cope with drought stress by maximizing physiological capacity and adjusting developmental processes such as flowering time. The WOX13 orthologous group is the most conserved among the clade of WOX homeodomain-containing proteins and is found to function in both drought stress and flower development. In this study, we isolated and characterized OsWOX13 from rice. OsWOX13 was regulated spatially in vegetative organs but temporally in flowers and seeds. Overexpression of OsWOX13 (OsWOX13-ov) in rice under the rab21 promoter resulted in drought resistance and early flowering by 7–10 days. Screening of gene expression profiles in mature leaf and panicles of OsWOX13-ov showed a broad spectrum of effects on biological processes, such as abiotic and biotic stresses, exerting a cross-talk between responses. Protein binding microarray and electrophoretic mobility shift assay analyses supported ATTGATTG as the putative cis-element binding of OsWOX13. OsDREB1A and OsDREB1F, drought stress response transcription factors, contain ATTGATTG motif(s) in their promoters and are preferentially expressed in OsWOX13-ov. In addition, Heading date 3a and OsMADS14, regulators in the flowering pathway and development, were enhanced in OsWOX13-ov. These results suggest that OsWOX13 mediates the stress response and early flowering and, thus, may be a regulator of genes involved in drought escape.

Abstract: Summary
The adult mammalian intestine is composed of two connected structures, the absorptive villi and the crypts, which house progenitor cells. Mouse crypts develop postnatally and are the architectural unit of the stem cell niche, yet the pathways that drive their formation are not known. Here, we combine transcriptomic, quantitative morphometric, and genetic analyses to identify mechanisms of crypt development. We uncover the upregulation of a contractility gene network at the earliest stage of crypt formation, which drives myosin II-dependent apical constriction and invagination of the crypt progenitor cells. Subsequently, hinges form, compartmentalizing crypts from villi. Hinges contain basally constricted cells, and this cell shape change was inhibited by increased hemidesmosomal adhesion in Rac1 null mice. Loss of hinges resulted in reduced villar spacing, revealing an unexpected role for crypts in tissue architecture and physiology. These studies provide a framework for studying crypt morphogenesis and identify essential regulators of niche formation.

Abstract: Summary
Tubulin glutamylation is a reversible posttranslational modification that accumulates on stable microtubules (MTs). While abnormally high levels of this modification lead to a number of disorders such as male sterility, retinal degeneration, and neurodegeneration, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of glutamylase activity. Here, we found that CSAP forms a complex with TTLL5, and we demonstrate that the two proteins regulate their reciprocal abundance. Moreover, we show that CSAP increases TTLL5-mediated glutamylation and identify the TTLL5-interacting domain. Deletion of this domain leads to complete loss of CSAP activating function without impacting its MT binding. Binding of CSAP to TTLL5 promotes relocalization of TTLL5 toward MTs. Finally, we show that CSAP binds and activates all of the remaining autonomously active TTLL glutamylases. As such, we present CSAP as a major regulator of tubulin glutamylation and associated functions.
