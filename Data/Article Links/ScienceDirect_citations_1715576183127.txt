Abstract: Degradation due to acetic acid in photovoltaic (PV) modules has been a commonly observed phenomenon for both damp-heat exposure and outdoor operations. Acetic acid is a degradation byproduct of ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA), a common module encapsulant. To address this issue, robust metallization pastes and cell technologies are being developed. However, it is important to assess how these technologies perform in an acetic acid environment and withstand degradation before they are implemented in the solar market. In this work, we investigate the impact of acetic acid exposure on four different cell groups: monofacial passivated emitter and rear contact (PERC) cells with advanced telluride-based front contact pastes, bifacial PERC cells with novel aluminum rear contact pastes, bifacial tunnel oxide passivated contacts (TOPCon) cells, and silicon heterojunction (SHJ) cells. These cells were exposed to acetic acid for different time increments. The recombination losses were characterized by Suns-VOC, and multi-variate regression analysis of intensity-dependent photoluminescence (PL) images with Griddler AI. Resistive losses were tracked with the transmission line method (TLM). Samples showing severe performance degradation were selected for further materials characterization to understand the root cause. Top-down and cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were performed to investigate the change in materials properties. Our study shows that the front contacts of the bifacial TOPCon cells and monofacial PERC cells were significantly affected by acetic acid exposure. The SHJ cells were found to be the most stable.

Abstract: As one of the prospective crystalline silicon (c-Si) technologies, tunnel oxide passivating contact (TOPCon) solar cells have recently attracted much attention in the photovoltaic community. However, the deficit of open-circuit voltage due to the imperfect passivation performance together with the insufficient understanding of the passivation mechanism, especially for the key structures of TOPCon devices (i.e., poly-Si/SiOx/c-Si), is a crucial factor to limit the improvement of device efficiency. To unlock the full passivation potential of this type of poly-Si/SiOx/c-Si contact, we report a systematic investigation by combining experiments and simulations. The related results can be summarized: 1) the best passivation can be obtained by optimizing SiOx quality, tailoring the in-diffusion profile, and performing hydrogenation; 2) if SiOx quality is good enough, high-level passivation can be expected even without impurity doping; 3) although the deepened in-diffusion could partially alleviate the degradation of the poor surface passivation, it would also reduce the passivation performance owing to the increased Auger recombination inherent to the high impurity doping; 4) the presence of pinholes would degrade the passivation performance, especially for the cases with the good surface passivation, a shallow in-diffusion and a low doping concentration of poly-Si, where the electric-field effect was minimized. To further confirm these conclusions, recombination distributions and the corresponding current profiles of the minority carriers were reviewed. This work clarifies the passivation mechanism of c-Si/SiOx/poly-Si contact in detail and provides effective guidance for further promoting the passivation level and the efficiencies of TOPCon devices.

Abstract: Due to the demand for healing damages caused during applications, it is desired to develop self-healing hydrogel electrolytes for flexible electrochromic device (ECD). A hydrogel electrolyte with remarkable self-healing ability, outstanding stretchability, and high ionic conductivity is presented in this work. Non-covalent interactions such as ionic connections between Ca2+ and -COO-, as well as numerous hydrogen bonds between PAA and HPMC, form dynamically cross-linked PAA-HPMC-Ca hydrogel electrolytes. Owing to the exceptional reversibility of non-covalent interactions, the hydrogel electrolyte exhibits remarkable self-healing and durability. Fracture strain and stress in the self-healed PAA-HPMC-Ca hydrogel can reach 429% and 240 KPa, respectively. In addition, a flexible ECD based on PAA-HPMC-Ca hydrogel electrolyte and a WO3 electrochromic layer was assembled and evaluated. The flexible quasi-solid-state ECD possesses excellent modulation transmittance range (approximately 66%), high coloration efficiency and steady response time. Thanks to the stability of the PAA-HPMC-Ca hydrogel electrolyte, the flexible ECD exhibits a great stability over 1000 cycles. This study may pave the way for self-healing electrolyte gels to be used in ECDs, supercapacitors, and batteries, among other flexible electrochemical devices.

Abstract: Mutations in Zinc finger 687 (ZNF687) were associated with Paget’s disease of bone (PDB), a disease characterized by increased bone resorption and excessive bone formation. It was suggested that ZNF687 plays a role in bone differentiation and development. However, the mechanisms involved in ZNF687 regulation remain unknown. This study aimed to obtain novel knowledge regarding ZNF687 transcriptional and epigenetic regulation. Through in silico analysis, we hypothesized three ZNF687 promoter regions located upstream exon 1 A, 1B, and 1 C and denominated promoter regions 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Their functionality was confirmed by luciferase activity assays and positive/negative regulatory regions were identified using promoter deletions constructs. In silico analysis revealed a high density of CpG islands in these promoter regions and in vitro methylation suppressed promoters’ activity. Using bioinformatic approaches, bone-associated transcription factor binding sites containing CpG dinucleotides were identified, including those for NFκB, PU.1, DLX5, and SOX9. By co-transfection in HEK293 and hFOB cells, we found that DLX5 specifically activated ZNF687 promoter region 1, and its methylation impaired DLX5-driven promoter stimulation. NFκB repressed and activated promoter regions 1 and 2, respectively, and these activities were affected by methylation. PU.1 induced ZNF687 promoter region 1 which was affected by methylation. SOX9 differentially regulated ZNF687 promoters in HEK293 and hFOB cells that were impaired after methylation. In conclusion, this study provides novel insights into ZNF687 regulation by demonstrating that NFκB, PU.1, DLX5, and SOX9 are regulators of ZNF687 promoters, and DNA methylation influences their activity. The contribution of the dysregulation of these mechanisms in PDB should be further elucidated.

Abstract: X-ray (micro-)computed tomography is a non-destructive characterization method using photons to obtain multiple radiographic projections, which generates a 3D volume rendering of a scanned object after reconstruction. It is recently used in the research and development of photovoltaic modules to investigate smaller volumes in a PV module, for example, detection of cavities in solder joints and visualization of module volumes up to connection ribbon sizes. This work shows that current advanced devices are able to scan larger volumes, using a single-cell 20 × 20 × 0.5 cm3 module with back-contact multi-ribbon interconnection technology as an example. The generated 3D volume renderings show the interconnection structures and give information on ribbon-metallization interconnections. Next to this, also the solder reflow volume is visible, indicating that the technology has great potential to be used in further interconnection technology development. Finally, a destructive cross section analysis using scanning electron microscopy is performed; it has a higher resolution and can differentiate elements with similar photon absorption coefficients, thus enabling microstructure and intermetallic compound analysis. The findings show the potential for micro-computed tomography as a non-destructive and relatively fast visualization method and how it can give complementary information to other characterization techniques for photovoltaic interconnection research.

Abstract: Thermophotovoltaics has become a very attractive solution for heat-to-electricity conversion due to its excellent conversion efficiencies. However, further research is needed to reduce the device cost which is typically based on III-V semiconductors. To tackle this limitation, crystalline germanium (c-Ge) has been proposed as an excellent substrate for low-cost devices. One of the key advances behind high system efficiencies is the excellent reflectance of the out-of-band photons at the rear surface of the photovoltaic device. These photons with lower energy than the absorber bandgap are reflected back to the thermal emitter reducing its thermal losses. In this work, we explore the performance of hole selective contacts based on evaporated transition metal oxides (MoOx, VOx, WOx) to be introduced at the rear surface of c-Ge devices. Regarding electrical properties, we characterize the selectivity of the contact by measuring effective surface recombination velocity (Seff) and contact resistivity (ρC). Best results are obtained with MoOx contacted by Ag/ITO with Seff = 588 cm/s and ρC = 55.6 mΩ cm2 which can be improved by using gold as a metal contact leading to Seff = 156 cm/s and ρC = 60.9 mΩ cm2. Regarding out-of-band reflectance, it is better for the case of Ag/ITO/MoOx contact with 87.5% compared to 78.9% for Au/MoOx when a 1473 K black body spectrum is used. Device simulations show potential system efficiencies in the range of 18–19% which are comparable to the best reported efficiencies using c-Ge thermophotovoltaic devices.

Abstract: Solar driven steam generation is a typical application of solar energy harvesting for clean water production, which has undergone a long-term development. Up to now, a desirable evaporation efficiency has been achieved in lab-scale via advanced materials and structural design However, to maintain a stable performance for long-term practical application, the simplicity of fabrication process, the cost of the raw material and the salt accumulation issue have to be taken into consideration. Here, this research proposed an efficient solar evaporator based on laser induced graphene (LIG) and the commercialized nickel foam. The nickel foam was preferred as the skeleton of the evaporator coupling with hydrophilic polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to provide sufficient water pathways with reduced water vaporization enthalpy in the bottom layer of the solar evaporator. In addition, plasmonic antimony doped tin oxide (ATO) nanoparticles were introduced into the porous graphene to further enhance the solar absorption and photothermal conversion. Thus, the 3D evaporator exhibits a high evaporation efficiency of 2.21 kg m−2 h−1 in salt water (20 wt% NaCl) under 1 solar irradiation (1 kw m−2). Moreover, the evaporator enables a stable evaporation performance upon the saline water during a 120 h test, with no salt crystals accumulated on the surface of evaporator. It is believed that this work presents a potential simple pathway to design and fabricate a portable and efficient evaporator equipped with efficient LIG nanocomposite as an efficient solar absorber.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic led to the delay of colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnosis, which causes CRC to be treated at more advanced, often metastatic stages. Unfortunately, there is no effective treatment for metastatic CRC stages, which are considered the leading cause of patients' death. The mortality induced by SARS-CoV-2 is significantly higher in cancer patients than in patients with other diseases. Interestingly, COVID-19 patients often develop fibrosis which depends on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) – the process also involved in cancer progression. The study aimed to verify whether SARS-CoV-2 induces EMT and consequently increases the invasion potential of colon cancer cells. CRC cells were stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 S and N protein peptides and epithelial and mesenchymal markers were analysed with Western blotting to detect the occurrence of the EMT. The migration, invasion assays and MMP-7 secretion were employed to evaluate the potential of SARS-CoV-2 to stimulate the cells invasion in vitro. ELISA assay, TGF-β1 neutralizing antibodies, TGF-βR silencing and inhibitors were used to investigate the role of the TGF-β1 signalling pathways in the SARS-CoV-2-dependent CRC stimulation. The SARS-CoV-2 induced EMT, which increased the invasion ability of CRC cells. Moreover, the SARS-CoV-2 proteins drive colon cancer cell invasion through TGF-β1. Additionally, secreted TGF-β1 induced a bystander effect in colon cancer cells. However, blocking TGF-β1/Smad- and -non-Smad-dependent pathways suppressed the SARS-CoV-2-induced invasiveness of CRC. In conclusion, we revealed that SARS-CoV-2 stimulates the invasion abilities of CRC by regulating TGF-β1-induced EMT. Our results provide a theoretical basis for using anti-TGF-β1 therapy to reduce the risk of CRC metastasis during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Abstract: The use of the oxide-metal-oxide (OMO) structure is one of the key strategies for enhancing the sheet resistance and flexibility of large-area flexible displays. Various combinations of OMOs with indium-tin oxide (ITO) and zinc-tin oxide (ZTO) for the oxide layer and a metal layer with silver (Ag) are discussed. Four-types of OMO are fabricated and the electrical characteristics of each are confirmed through electrochromic devices. The type of oxide layer affects the electron transfer from the metal layer to the oxide layer. Thus, the position of the oxide layer depends on the band structure and should be considered to achieve better performance. The ITO/Ag/ITO (IAI) type of electrode demonstrated the lowest sheet resistance at an average of 8 Ω sq−1 as well as high transparency above 80% at a wavelength of 650 nm. Electrochromic transparency differences between the bleached and colored states were maintained at 52.1% after 200 cycles, and the times required for coloration and bleaching were 0.5s and 8.1s, respectively. A stable redox reaction was confirmed after storing the devices at −30 °C and 85 °C for 18 h.

Abstract: To enhance the comprehensive photo-thermal energy accretion of the confined phase-changing materials (EPCM), engineered plasmonic nanoparticles (PG) and photosensitizer (PDA) were assimilated and structured in a core-satellite manner to form a highly active composite shell (DS-PDA/PG). In this communication, we devise a heterogeneous core-satellite assembly by the conjugation of the PCMs core and PG satellite assisted by a PDA arresting media. The constructed core-satellite can distinctly demonstrate superior photothermal performance compared to their respective precursor. This structural framework enunciates substantial improvement in photothermal energy conversion and heat dissipation mechanism due to the synergistic effect between the PG satellite and the PDA linker. Particularly, the heat channeling effect of PG nanoparticles onto the structured framework due to its localized surface plasmonic resonance (LSPR) mitigation which effectively dissipates heat to the encapsulating shell. The curated approach achieved a phase transition enthalpy of 139.20 J/g, with a thermal discrepancy of 28.89 ± 1.21 °C attaining an augmented photo to heat energy conversion efficiency of 96.95% due to wideband solar absorption and effective heat dissipation through the core-satellite assembly. The structured consolidation of PG and PDA was recognized to be a functional strategy that reinforce substantial improvements toward direct photo energy cultivation in an assortment of applications such as temperature management of greenhouses, solar water heating systems, solar cookers, and solar-thermal electricity generating systems.

Abstract: Amorphous lithium phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON) films of various thicknesses were prepared by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering as an electrolyte layer for inorganic all-solid-state electrochromic devices.The ionic conductivity of LiPON films measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was all approximately 10−6 S/cm, and the average optical transmittance characterized by UV–Vis spectroscopy was over 80%, indicating that the prepared LiPON films were suitable for electrochromic applications. Monoclinic electrochromic devices (ECDs) (ITO/NiOx/LiPON/WO3/ITO) with different LiPON thicknesses were fabricated and studied. It was found that the electro-optical properties of the ECDs could be significantly affected by the thickness and surface roughness of LiPON films. The ECDs demonstrated the best combination of optical contrast (68.4% at 560 nm), switching time (27s), and cycling stability (optical modulation degradation of 6.93% for 200 cycles) when the LiPON thickness was 450 nm. The above results not only shed lights on improving the interfacial properties of solid electrolytes, but also give directions for the performance enhancement of inorganic all-solid electrochromic devices.

Abstract: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is the third gas signaling molecule that has been shown to be involved in the regulating vital activities in the body, including inhibition of aging. However, it is unknown whether H2S alleviates aging in the kidney and glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs) by modulating their mitophagy. Here, results of experiments in vivo and in vitro showed that compared with control group, the renal function of mice and GMCs viability were decreased in D-gal (D-galactose) group, while the activity of SA-β-gal and p21 expression were increased, Cyclin D1 and Klotho expressions were decreased; H2S content and CSE expression were lower; ROS and MDA contents and mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening were risedose; ATP production and mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) were reduced; Apoptotic rate, the expression of Cleaved caspase-9 and -3, Cyt c, p62 and Drp1 were enhanced and the expression of Bcl-2, Mfn2, Beclin-1, LC3 II/I, PINK1 and parkin were decreased. In addition, phospho-AMPK/AMPK and phospho-ULK1/ULK1 were also decreased significantly. Compared with the D-gal group, the changes of above indexes were reversed in the D-gal + NaHS (Sodium hydrosulfide, an exogenous H2S donor) group. The reverse effects of NaHS were similar to that of AICAR (an AMPK agonist) and kinetin (a PINK1 agonist), respectively. Taken together, these results suggest that exogenous H2S increases mitophagy and inhibits apoptosis as well as oxidative stress through up-regulation of AMPK-ULK1-PINK1-parkin pathway, which delays kidney senescence in mice.

Abstract: The presence of heterogeneous interfacial defects limits the efficiency and long-term stability of the perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Rational passivation of interfacial defects and reduction of nonradiative recombination at the perovskite active layer are effective ways to achieve efficient PSCs. Here, a heterointerface engineering strategy is presented by employing a multifunctional molecule of reduced l-glutathione (GSH). The introduction of GSH improves the crystallization of SnO2, resulting in a continuous and conformal coverage of SnO2 on the FTO surface. And the GSH buffer layer improves the affinity between SnO2 and perovskite, resulting in the formation of large grains of perovskite. In addition, GSH bridges the perovskite to SnO2 through multi-dentate ligands (-COOH, –NH2, –CONH–, –HS), which passivates the multiple defects at the heterogeneous interfaces while accelerates the electron transport. As a result, the PCE of the GSH-SnO2 ETL based PSC significantly increases to 21.66% with no noticeable hysteresis. Meanwhile, compared with the control PSC, the unencapsulated GSH-SnO2 based PSC exhibits better environmental stability, which maintains more than 80% of its initial PCE after 600 h of placement in atmospheric environment.

Abstract: Release of the alkaline (mainly sodium) impurities from the soda-lime glass (SLG) substrate can compromise scaling-up of thin film photovoltaic (PV) devices deposited at high temperatures. This does not only degrade electronic device quality but also results in catastrophic effects such as delamination of the semiconductor thin films. Device scale-up can be further hindered by the pinholes that may exist across the large panel areas, causing serious shunt paths. We demonstrate fabrication of uniform CdTe mini-modules on the SLG using a facile photolithography process. This process effectively suppresses sodium release and prevents film delamination from the substrate whilst plugging the pinholes within the semiconductor p-n junction layers. Mini-module devices with repeatable device response are demonstrated using an industrial laser scribing system operating long (microsecond)-pulses of a green laser for thin film scribing.

Abstract: Electrochromic (EC) technology allows control of the transmission of visible light and solar radiation through thin-film devices. When applied to “smart” windows, EC technology can significantly diminish energy use for cooling and air conditioning of buildings and simultaneously provide good indoor comfort for the buildings’ occupants through reduced glare. EC “smart” windows are available on the market, but it is nevertheless important that their degradation under operating conditions be better understood and, ideally, prevented. In the present work, we investigated EC properties, voltammetric cycling durability, and potentiostatic rejuvenation of sputter-deposited WO3 thin films immersed in LiClO4–propylene carbonate electrolytes containing up to 3.0 wt% of ∼7-nm-diameter SiO2 nanoparticles. Adding about 1 wt% SiO2 led to a significant improvement in cycling durability in the commonly used potential range of 2.0–4.0 V vs. Li/Li+. Furthermore, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy indicated that O–Si bonds were associated with enhanced durability in the presence of SiO2 nanoparticles.

Abstract: Despite the impressive progress, the perovskite solar cells are still under the stage of laboratory research, mainly because of their inferior operational stability. To improve the device lifetime, one of the most important strategies is to eliminate the undesirable side reactions between the functional layers. In this study, we present the thermal oxidation method to yield high-quality pristine and modified indium oxide films applied as efficient electron transport layers (ETLs) for perovskite cells in a planar n-i-p configuration. The cells incorporating In2O3 as ETL material can deliver comparable efficiencies with the reference SnO2-based devices while showing much superior operational stability. We attributed the observed stabilizing effect of indium oxide to its reduced chemical activity at the interface with the perovskite absorber layer. In particular, In2O3 can hardly oxidize I− to molecular iodine on the contrary to SnO2 and TiO2 known for their photocatalytic activity. We believe that this study may provide researchers with general guidelines to develop a large variety of ETL materials for efficient yet stable perovskite cells.

Abstract: This study investigated the reduced graphene oxide bonded to Cu2S nanoparticles as the counter electrode's material for quantum dot sensitized solar cell fabrication. The materials were prepared under optimal conditions, and their structure, surface morphology and electrochemical properties were characterized. The complete quantum dot sensitized solar cells, assembled by different prepared counter electrodes, were evaluated to compare the electrochemical properties of the FTO@rGO-Cu2S with those of the FTO@CuS, FTO@PbS and FTO@Cu2S counter electrodes. As a result, the FTO@rGO-Cu2S counter electrodes yielded the highest power conversion efficiency of 5.24% and had the most negligible counter electrode/electrolyte interface resistance of 11.1 Ω, indicating the superior electrochemical properties of the rGO-Cu2S material.

Abstract: Dew harvest with radiative cooling condenser can be a simple and portable solution to extract water from the atmosphere, but its water yield is limited. Implementing wind cover is one of the simplest ways to improve cooling power by reducing convection. However, wind covers usually block water transport and cannot be applied to radiative condensers for dew harvesting. Herein, porous wind covers, including polyethylene (PE) nets and porous PE films, have been adopted, and their effect on radiative condensers has been investigated. These wind covers have good atmospheric window transmittance and convection reduction effect. The two-day radiative cooling experiment has proven that sufficient sub-ambient cooling can be achieved using our radiative cooling film. Afterward, a two-month nocturnal condensation experiment was conducted. Condensers covered with high porosity PE nets on average yield more water than the condenser without cover, with a maximum improvement of 19.5% using a PE net with ∼86% porosity. In particular, at low humidity condition, the average water yield for the condenser without cover is only 1.4 g/m2/night. In comparison, the value increases to 23.7 g/m2/night and 13.6 g/m2/night for condensers covered with a PE net (∼64% porosity) and a porous film (∼4% porosity), respectively. The improvement in water yield indicates that porous wind cover is a simple and essential tool for radiative condensers to provide more water in regions with dry and windy climates. Further analysis has revealed that experimental observations arise from the trade-off between convection suppression and water transportation of the porous wind covers.

Abstract: A standardized method for measuring thermophotovoltaic (TPV) efficiency has not been yet established, which makes the reported results difficult to compare. Besides, most of the TPV efficiencies reported to date have been obtained using small view factors, i.e., large cell-to-emitter distances, so the impact of the series resistance is usually underestimated, and the optical cavity effects, i.e., the multiple reflections taking place between the emitter and the cell, are not accounted for experimentally. In this work, we present an experimental setup that is able to measure the TPV efficiency under high view factors (up to 0.98) by using small emitter-to-cell distances (<1 mm). This allows a more accurate direct measurement of the TPV efficiency at higher power densities than previous works. As a result, a TPV efficiency of 26.4 ± 0.1% and a power density of 4.3 ± 0.8 W/cm2 have been obtained for an InGaAs TPV cell with a back surface reflector irradiated by a graphite thermal emitter at 1592 °C.

Abstract: Transparent heat-insulation glass (HIG) with a highly selective light-absorbing coating and an energy-storage blanket (ESB) loaded with phase change materials show considerable potential in reducing building energy consumption. However, the energy-saving effect of a single material is usually not ideal, and the instability of HIG and ESB limits their applications. In this work, HIG with enhanced stability and a form-stable ESB was prepared. The temperature difference between various indoor areas and energy consumption were reduced simultaneously because of the temperature regulation function of the HIG and ESB in the light and dark areas. NaxWO3@SiO2-coated HIG showed excellent daylighting and near-infrared-light-shielding ability with visible light transmittance of 71% and near-infrared light transmittance of 16%, respectively. Moreover, polyethylene glycol/halloysite nanotube composite phase change material with a high enthalpy of 71.1 J/g and a suitable phase change temperature of 27.5 °C was prepared for the form-stable ESB. The test room experiment indicated that the combination of the HIG and ESB (HIG–ESB) reduced the indoor temperature difference from 6.8 °C to 0.9 °C and the maximum temperature by 33–40%. The energy consumption simulation revealed that the ESB can save energy in all selected cities, whereas HIG is only applicable to cities in warm regions. HIG–ESB achieved the highest annual energy-saving rate of 43.9% in Hong Kong. The joint application of the HIG and ESB provides a new strategy for developing passive energy-saving buildings.

Abstract: The thermal stability of the Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) absorber and CdS buffer layers in SLG/Mo/CZTSe/CdS/i-ZnO/ITO devices is explored by performing a series of soft (∼200 °C) post deposition treatments (PDTs). A comprehensive analysis of a sample comprised by 56 individual devices by means of Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopies coupled with optoelectronic characterization is performed at different PDT steps. This allows isolating the effects of the PDT on the CZTSe absorber and CdS buffer layer separately and reveals clear evidences of: i) a degradation of the absorber due to Cu/Zn disorder that hinders device performance, and ii) an improvement of the buffer layer by the recrystallization of the CdS nanolayer that is the main responsible for the PDT-induced efficiency improvement. As such, it is concluded that CZTSe/CdS based PV devices present a low thermal stability under relatively low temperatures (in the 100–200 °C range), comparable to the temperatures employed at the final production stages of thin film PV devices or even during device operation, that leads to significant changes in solar cell performance and needs to be taken into consideration for the further development of the kesterite PV technology. These results are supported by a novel methodology for easily discerning between changes in Cu/Zn disorder and in point defects concentration in kesterites based on solely on Raman spectroscopy that is proposed in this work and developed through the analysis of a set of CZTSe powder samples with strong variation of the order parameter Q.

Abstract: Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3) is an emerging prognostic indicator, and its elevated expression correlates with malignancy in a broad spectrum of cancers. However, its regulatory networks have not yet been reported. In this study, we identified the regulatory targets of IGF2BP3 in breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells using RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (RIP-seq) and high-throughput RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). We discovered that these targets were enriched in the inflammatory response, endoplasmic reticulum stress, cell cycle, and cancer-related pathways, providing a new perspective for better understanding the functional mechanisms of IGF2BP3. Moreover, we identified that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a downstream target, is regulated by IGF2BP3. IGF2BP3 binds to and protects EGFR mRNA from degradation and facilitates cell proliferation via the EGFR/AKT pathway in MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, IGF2BP3 expression was robust and could not be altered by stimulation with EGF and anti-EGFR siRNA or EGFR signaling pathway inhibitors (gefitinib, LY294002 and SL-327). These results demonstrate that IGF2BP3, as a stubborn oncogene, promotes triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation by strengthening the role of the EGFR-AKT axis.

Abstract: Objective
The catabolic process of autophagy is arousing the attention of researchers studying diabetic retinopathy (DR), but the role and molecular mechanism of autophagy in DR are still unclear.
Methods
An in vivo diabetic rat model and in vitro hyperglycemic-exposed retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell cultures were established to mimic early DR. Transmission electron microscopy and mRFP-GFP-LC3 adenovirus transfection were applied for autophagic flux analysis. MicroRNA (miR)-19a-3p, members of the phosphate and tensin homolog (PTEN)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, and the autophagy-related proteins light chain (LC)3II/I and p62 were detected. Annexin V, transwell, Cell Counting Kit-8, fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran monolayer permeability assay, and transepithelial electrical resistance were performed to evaluate the effects of regulating autophagy on RPE cells under the DR condition.
Results
Autophagy was aberrantly activated in DR as evidenced by autophagosome accumulation. Further mechanistic experiments revealed that DR induced PTEN expression, thus inhibiting Akt/mTOR phosphorylation and stimulating aberrant autophagy and apoptosis. Notably, these events could be reversed by miR-19a-3p directly targeting PTEN. Downregulation of autophagy by miR-19a-3p overexpression, PTEN knockdown, or 3-methyladenine (3-MA) treatment inhibited autophagosome formation and thus effectively ameliorated hyperglycemia-induced RPE cell apoptosis, increased migration, inhibited viability, and enhanced monolayer permeability under the DR condition.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that upregulation of miR-19a-3p inhibits aberrant autophagy by directly targeting PTEN, thus protecting RPE cells against DR damage. miR-19a-3p may represent a novel therapeutic target for inducing protective autophagy in early DR.

Abstract: The ability of calcium-based composites to simultaneously improve optical absorption and accelerate decomposition kinetics represents a major endeavor direction in the direct solar-driven thermochemical energy storage system. Doping strategy has been macroscopically proved to be an effective way in boosting optical absorption properties and calcination kinetics, but the underlying microscopic mechanisms are still unclear. This paper aims to reveal the mechanisms of optical absorption enhancement and accelerated decomposition kinetics for Mn-doped CaCO3 through both experiments and density function theory (DFT). In the experiment, the optical absorption of Mn-doped CaCO3 was much higher than that of pure CaCO3. The sample CaCO3–7Mn displayed satisfied optical absorption and fabulous cycling stability. The optical absorption reached 74% and energy storage density only decreased 2.6% after 20 cycles. Meanwhile, the decomposition reaction rate equations of pure CaCO3 and Mn-doped CaCO3 were obtained via non-isothermal kinetic analysis. The results indicated that doping Mn could accelerate decomposition kinetics of CaCO3 by reducing the apparent activation energy. In the DFT calculation, the complex refractive index of Mn-doped CaCO3 was lower in real part (refractive index) and higher in imaginary part (extinction coefficient) within the wavelength range from 300 to 2500 nm compared with pure CaCO3, which was closely related to the electron cloud distribution in the calcite crystal structure. Moreover, Mn-doped CaCO3 has lower transition state energy barrier and dissociation energy than pure CaCO3. The calculation results revealed the mechanisms of doping Mn in CaCO3 to enhance the light absorption and accelerate the decomposition kinetics from the microscopic perspective at atomic level. This work contributes to understanding the physical mechanisms of doping elements on boosting the performance of calcium-based composites at the molecular level.

Abstract: Porous three-dimensional electrochromic films composed of orthorhombic WO3·H2O, hexagonal WO3, and rutile TiO2 array (h-WO3/o-WO3·H2O/r-TiO2, WWT) were controllably synthesized by a facile two-step hydrothermal technique. Due to the hydrophilicity and array structure of TiO2, the generation of high-quality o-WO3·H2O was significantly promoted, which can reduce the energy barrier to ion diffusion and increase the ion flux by introducing structural water in the interlayer region of WO3. The formation of porous 3-dimensional structure and WO3–TiO2 heterojunction increases the effective contact area, alters the distribution of energy bands, and promotes charge transport, resulting in significantly improved electrochromic properties. An impressive dual-band electrochromic performance with high optical modulation of 68.4% at 633 nm and 59.8% at 1600 nm was achieved in WWT film, respectively, with a fast switching speed (11s/3.3 s at 633 nm and 3 s/9.4 s at 1600 nm for coloring/bleaching), high coloration efficiency (46 cm2 C−1 at 633 nm and 136.8 cm2 C−1 at 1600 nm), and a satisfactory cycling stability at the same time.

Abstract: This experimental study aims to evaluate the melting performance of non-magnetic and magnetic nano-enhanced phase change materials (NEPCMs) composited with metal foam inside a cavity heated from the left in a non-uniform magnetic field via thermochromic liquid crystal (TLC) visualization. The evolutions of solid-liquid interface and mushy zone during melting are captured by TLC technique and temperature distributions are recorded by ten thermocouples. The effects of particles concentrations of NEPCM (0 wt%, 1 wt%, 3 wt%, 5 wt%), filling arrangements of metal foam (filling height, porosity gradient direction) and directions of magnetic field (left, right) are studied with emphasis on the heat transfer and energy storage characteristics including liquid fraction, energy stored and Nusselt number. The results show that comparing to pure PCM, the 3 wt% Al2O3 NEPCM maximizes the enhancement of melting performance for decreasing complete melting time as 29.32% and increasing energy storage as 0.26%. For partial porous filling, as the filling height increases, the melting rate firstly increases then decreases, but energy stored shows the opposite trend. The filling height of 3/4h is considered as the optimal filling height with 43.51% decreasing of complete melting time and only 6.81% decreasing of energy stored. For gradient porosity filling, positive gradient has faster melting rate (62.16% amplification), but negative gradient has less energy loss (only 6.30% reduction). Under a non-uniform magnetic field, the convection of magnetic NEPCM is greatly suppressed by the Kelvin force, with 6.76% and 19.59% increasing of complete melting time and 0.07% reduction and 2.45% growth of energy stored for left and right magnet cases, respectively.

Abstract: We studied a silver (Ag) deposition-based multicolor electrochromic (EC) device that can represent mirror, black, cyan, magenta, yellow, green, and transparent states reversibly. The coloration in this system is based on localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of Ag electrodeposits. The size and shape of deposited Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) are important for device coloration. Therefore, it is necessary to elucidate the LSPR band change corresponding to the morphology of AgNPs during the EC device operation to improve the colorability. In this study, dark-field microscopy (DFM) was applied to in situ observation of the changes in LSPR of AgNPs at the coloration process in the reversible Ag deposition multicolor EC device for the first time. The light scattering observation of AgNPs using DFM enabled analysis of the LSPR band over time. The obtained light scattering spectra provide detailed information on the LSPR induced by AgNPs in Ag deposition-based EC devices in comparison with conventional absorption spectrum measurements.

Abstract: This work aims to contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms behind electrically active crystalline defect formation in cast-mono (cm) ingots grown along the <001> axis. Both the spatial distributions of background dislocations in the cellular dislocation array and the driving force for dislocation multiplication in the sub-grains are not perfectly understood. Macroscale length crystal rotations are here characterized by the (θ/2θ) X-ray diffraction (XRD) method at different ingot heights and along two perpendicular sample axes. XRD measurements show the presence of crystal rotations in the large single grain domain. Two orthogonal misorientations components are found to evolve linearly along each sample axis forming plane orientation gradients up to (0.05 ± 0.02) degree/cm extending over 12 cm inside the cast-mono grain. (001) crystal structure deformation are also analysed by rocking curve imaging (RCI) using synchrotron radiation on wafers of a neighboring brick. First, results confirm the presence of the plane orientation gradient measured by XRD and its order of magnitude. Second, RCI results demonstrate that the plane orientation gradient is associated to the cellular dislocation network. Therefore, these results strongly suggest that background dislocations network of a cellular form can create an organized orientation gradient at large distance within the ingot. The involvement of the characterized orientation gradients in the formation and extension of electrically active SGBs in cast-mono ingots is discussed.

Abstract: In this study, the corrosion behaviour of stainless steels AISI 321 and 347 in molten nitrate salt were investigated for up to 28 days. Three different thermal conditions; isothermal, thermal cycling and thermal shock, were explored to investigate the effect of the likely temperature gradients on the corrosion characteristics of AISI 321 and 347 during the operation of Concentrated solar power plants. Gravimetric corrosion analysis was combined with micro-morphology and cross-sectional analysis of the corrosion interface; using a combination of scanning/transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-Ray diffraction techniques, for this study. Results from corrosion rate measurements and surface characterisation show that thermal shock induces higher material degradation rate than the two other temperature profiles. Severe spallation of interfacial corrosion oxide layers was observed under thermal shock conditions other than in isothermal and thermal cycling conditions and correlated to the overall performance after 28 days. The level of spallation of interfacial oxides across the three temperature profiles investigated in this study was linked to the induced stresses from mismatch in the thermal expansion properties between the corrosion oxide layer and the substrates.

Abstract: Poor low–bias PEC performance of state–of–the–art BiVO4, α–Fe2O3 and WO3 photoelectrodes widely used in tandem and/or parallel PEC/PV and/or PEC/PEC devices has been reported to largely limit the cell efficiency for self–biased solar water splitting. A breakthrough of such bottleneck is put forward in this contribution by employing n–Cu2O with advantageous band edge positions straddling the HER and OER redox potentials as an alternative photoanode. The ohmic Cu/n–Cu2O back contact facilitates the interfacial photoelectron transfer while the gradient distribution of the oxygen vacancies (Vo) close to the n–Cu2O/electrolyte junction promotes the photoholes injected into water, synergistically leading to an outstanding photocurrent density of 3.5 mA cm−2, an unprecedented photocurrent–to–O2 conversion efficiency exceeding 70%, and a record ABPE of 2% at an ultralow applied potential of ∼0.6 VRHE, among the highest performance and the lowest external bias of state–of–the–art metal–oxide–based photoanodes reported to date.

Abstract: An abnormal immune response induces melanoma development. IL-17 and the classical downstream signal STAT1 are associated with melanoma development. TRAF2 also mediates the downstream signaling of IL-17; however, its role in IL-17-stimulated melanoma remains unclear. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that TRAF2 can bind to PIAS2 (a SUMO E3 ligase), ELAVL1 (an RNA-binding protein), and EPHA5 (an ephrin receptor of the tyrosine kinase family). To elucidate the IL-17 downstream signal, the IL-17 receptor (R), STAT1, TRAF2, PIAS2, ELAVL1, and EPHA5 were knocked down before melanoma cells were treated with recombinant IL-17A protein. Co-immunoprecipitation and RNA immunoprecipitation were conducted to determine the interaction of TRAF2 with PIAS2, ELAVL1, and EPHA5 proteins, as well as the interaction of ELAVL1 protein with EPHA5 mRNA. STAT1 knockdown suppressed the proliferation and invasion triggered by IL-17A, but the suppressive effects were much weaker than those caused by IL-17R knockdown. This implies that another nonclassical signal mediates IL-17 effects. IL-17A induces TRAF2 recruitment of ELAVL1, PIAS2, and EPHA5 proteins. We speculated that ELAVL1 bound to the AU-rich elements in the 3′ untranslated region of the EPHA5 mRNA, thereby enhancing mRNA stability. Furthermore, PIAS2 induced EPHA5 SUMOylation, which suppressed EPHA5 ubiquitination and degradation. Through pre- and post-translational regulation, IL-17A induced EPHA5 expression in melanoma, and EPHA5 knockdown markedly suppressed IL-17A-induced proliferation and invasion. This study revealed a non-classical signaling mechanism responsible for the effects of IL-17 in melanoma.

Abstract: π-Extended viologen derivatives of SHP, THP and FHP with selenophene, thiophene and furan units between two pyridine moieties, respectively, as chromophores, were synthesized. Compared with conventional viologen of DHP using bipyridines as the chromophore, the three compounds of SHP, THP, and FHP possess extended conjugation lengths and narrowed bandgaps. All-in-one electrochromic devices (ECDs) were assembled using these four viologen derivatives and investigated systematically. Due to the different electronic properties of the chromophores, the devices exhibited different colored states, blue, blue-violet, magenta and red. Furthermore, the electrochromic response of SHP, THP, and FHP extended into near-infrared (NIR) region due to the long conjugation as compared with that of DHP. Further, the ECDs possessing SHP, THP and FHP displayed faster response speed and relatively higher coloration efficiency than that of DHP. Among them, ECD based on FHP has shown the most excellent stability, which retains 95.7% optical contrast of its initial state after continuous working for 20000 cycles. Additionally, upon applying a switching potential, electrofluorochromic (EFC) properties of the devices based on THP and FHP were observed. This study revealed structure-property relations and demonstrated that manipulation of chromophores offers an effective route to obtain multicolor and multifunctional ECDs, which provides potential applications for colorful displays and smart windows.

Abstract: Ferroptosis, a newly discovered type of regulated cell death, has been implicated in numerous human diseases. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and ultimately fatal interstitial lung disease with poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Emerging evidence has linked ferroptosis and glutamate-determined cell fate which is considered a new light on the etiology of pulmonary fibrosis. Here, we observed that N-methyl d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activation promoted cell damage and iron deposition in MLE-12 cells in a dose-, time-, and receptor-dependent manner. This mediated substantial Ca2+ influx, upregulated the expression levels of nNOS and IRP1, and affected intracellular iron homeostasis by regulating the expression of iron transport-related proteins (i.e., TFR1, DMT1, and FPN). Excessive iron load promoted the continuous accumulation of total intracellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, which ultimately led to ferroptosis. NMDAR inhibition reduced lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis in bleomycin-induced mice. Bleomycin stimulation upregulated the expression of NMDAR1, nNOS, and IRP1 in mouse lung tissues, which ultimately led to iron deposition via regulation of the expression of various iron metabolism-related genes. NMDAR activation initiated the pulmonary fibrosis process by inducing iron deposition in lung tissues and ferroptosis of alveolar type II cells. Our data suggest that NMDAR activation regulates the expression of iron metabolism-related genes by promoting calcium influx, increasing nNOS and IRP1 expression, and increasing iron deposition by affecting cellular iron homeostasis, ultimately leading to mitochondrial damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ferroptosis. NMDAR activation-induced ferroptosis of alveolar type II cells might be a key event to the initiation of pulmonary fibrosis.

Abstract: Electrochromic supercapacitors (ECSCs) that combine electrochromism and energy storage characters enable visual monitoring of the energy storage state of the device. In this work, two triphenylamine-based polymers pTPACB and pTTPACB were prepared by electrochemical polymerization. Both polymers exhibit multi-step redox behavior due to the presence of multiple triphenylamine and carbazole units. Correspondingly, pTPACB and pTTPACB can be switched from neutral colorless state to multicolored changes at different potentials. Compared with pTPACB, pTTPACB presents faster switching time and higher optical contrast. It is more intriguing that pTTPACB shows much more outstanding pseudocapacitive behavior with ultrahigh areal specific capacitance (6.64 mF‧cm-2) at a current density of 0.05 mA‧cm-2 due to the smaller nanoparticles size and loose aggregated structure. In addition, the asymmetric electrochromic supercapacitor devices based on pTTPACB can light a display panel or blue LED for 30 s accompanied with color changes from blue-green to colorless in the process of power supply. Hence, this work achieves a novel triphenylamine-based polymer for high-performance electrochromic supercapacitors, which shows great potential in electronic tags and display devices.

Abstract: Alkali doping and alloying are well-known strategies to improve the performance of Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) absorber based thin film solar cells. The effects of individual light alkali elements such as Li and Na have been thoroughly investigated, with both dopants resulting in significant improvements in performance of CZTSSe solar cells. Here, the combined effects of Li and Na are investigated in a so-called co-doping approach to capture the benefits from both elements simultaneously. In order to do that, various concentrations of Li and Na between 0.0 M and 0.5 M are added to the solution used for spin coating of the precursor layer. After annealing under Se-enriched atmosphere, the two alkali elements displayed mutual dependency in terms of their concentrations in the CZTSSe absorber layer. Furthermore, both, Li and Na showed signs of forming alloys with the CZTSSe phase. The efficiencies of the best Li–Na co-doped solar cells are above 10%, slightly above the Li baseline thanks to increased open-circuit-voltage and short-circuit current. A non-negligible Na incorporation was observed even in nominally Na-free devices, likely from indirect contamination from the SLG substrate. Further work is needed to better understand Na-poor compositions and draw conclusions relevant to Na-free substrates.

Abstract: Graphene-based composite phase change materials (CPCMs) have great potential for energy storage applications due to their excellent loading capacities and thermal conductivity, their ability to store PCMs and suppress liquid leakage during phase change. However, there are few graphene-based CPCMs capable of storing low-temperature industrial waste heat. In this paper, 1-hexadecylamine (HDA) was selected as the PCMs and 3D graphene aerogel (GA) was used as the support material to prepare HDA/GA CPCMs by melt impregnation method. The results show that the HDA is uniformLy distributed in the GA, and the HDA/GA CPCMs with high latent heat and high thermal conductivity were obtained. The melting temperature was 56.8 °C and the solidification temperature was 55.0 °C, and the latent heat was as high as 284.5 kJ/kg, which was 1.05 times higher than that of pure HDA, and the sub-cooling degree was in the range of 4–10 °C. The thermal conductivity of the HDA/GA at 25 °C was 0.238 W/(m·K), which was 1.61 times higher than the thermal conductivity of the HDA, and the loading of the GA on the HDA was up to 5600%. The above results indicate that HDA/GA CPCMs have promising applications in low-temperature energy storage.

Abstract: With the increasing global instability in the development of the world, the efficient storage and conversion of energy have alerted attention. In this work, a novel conjugated microporous polymer hollow spheres (CMPHS) with a high specific surface (323 m2 g−1) and unique cavity structure are creatively prepared. By treatment with simple carbonization, the resulting carbonized microspheres (CCMPHS) show a high light absorption (80%) and outstanding thermal stability (thermal decomposition at 506 °C). On basis of the abundant micropores distributed on the surface of microspheres, the organic phase change materials (PCMs) i.e., fatty alcohols (tetradecanol (TD), hexadecanol (HD), and octadecanol (OD)), are successfully embedded into CCMPHS to afford a kind of new composite (CCMPHS@PCMs) for energy storage and conversion. The three kinds of CCMPHS@PCMs exhibit high latent heats (220.1 kJ kg−1, 244.6 kJ kg−1, and 228.8 kJ kg−1, respectively.). In terms of energy conversion, the photothermal conversion efficiencies of CCMPHS@PCMs are up to 86.83%, 89.45%, and 85.40% and the electrothermal conversion efficiencies are 83.81%, 81.10%, and 90.50%, which possess one of the highest values among the most of similar composites embed with PCMs reported to dates. Based on the advantages of simple fabrication, easy to scale up, high energy density, and conversion efficiency, the CCMPHS@PCMs are expected to be one of the most promising candidates as efficient PCMs composite for a variety of practical applications such as solar or electric energy harvesting, storage, conversion, and so on.

Abstract: Currently, the efficiency of Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) monograin layer solar cells is mainly limited by the recombination losses in the bulk and at the surface of absorber/buffer that need to be reduced. One approach to significantly improve the performance of CZTS monograin layer solar cells is to post-treat the surfaces of monograin powder crystals before the buffer layer deposition. This study includes the optimization of two sequential post-treatment steps: 1) chemical etching of as-grown powder crystals with Br2 in methanol followed by KCN; and 2) annealing at different temperatures (550–850 °C) under different sulfur vapor pressures (100–2050 Torr) in a two-temperature zone furnace in closed ampoules. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, high-resolution scanning electron microscopy and Raman studies using multiwavelength excitation revealed that SnS2 and ZnS secondary phases were formed on the crystals’ surfaces in the thermal annealing process. At the same time, by increasing the annealing temperature, the ratio of Cu/(Zn + Sn) increased and Zn/Sn decreased in the bulk of annealed CZTS crystals compared to as-grown monograin powder crystals. Optimal conditions for combinational post-treatment to adjust the absorber material composition and to improve monograin layer solar cells' performance were found as follows: the chemical etching of as-grown powders with 1% Br2–MeOH for 5 min + 10% KCN for 5 min followed by annealing in sealed ampoules at 850 °C in a sulfur atmosphere of 2050 Torr for 1 h. The highest power conversion efficiency of 9.44% was obtained under these conditions.

Abstract: The investigation of lipid-derived salts containing ionic bonds is an attractive subject for thermal energy storage applications since the presence of different high-chain fatty acid tails and ionic bond in the backbone represent a new approach for phase change materials. In the present study, four different lipid-derived cetyltrimethylammonium salts were synthesized via a simple acid-base reaction between cetyltrimethylammonium hydroxide and lauric, myristic, palmitic, stearic acid. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, and Fourier transform infrared analyses techniques have been used for characterization of the resultant structures. Phase change temperatures, enthalpies, and thermal endurances of the synthesized lipid-derived salts were determined by using differential scanning calorimeter and thermogravimetric analyzer. Differential scanning calorimeter analyses revealed that these salts can store and release thermal energy between 145 and 170 kJ/kg at onset melting temperatures between 98 and 108 °C. Besides, thermogravimetric analyses indicated that they have thermal decomposition onset temperatures above 200 °C and they can easily withstand an exothermic process up to 150 °C. Based on the reported data, it can be stated that the investigated lipid-derived salts are suitable for utilization as renewable phase change materials for moderately high temperature thermal energy storage applications. This paper represents the first example in the literature reporting the thermal properties of lipid-derived salts as a new group of phase change materials.

Abstract: Luminescent solar concentrators (LSC) are recently getting attention as promising components for use in building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV). Ongoing efforts to reduce their optical losses result in active search for new luminophores with large Stokes shift in order to reduce the reabsorption probability. Here we present a novel figure of merit for a large group of Gaussian dye luminophores that provides an accurate assessment of optical losses. Our approach originates in simplified analytical solution for spectral overlapping integral of absorption/emission bands and results in assessment of average reabsorption probability. The procedure is then generalized for any Gaussian dye LSC, by considering its basic parameters (Stokes shift, absorbance and size), thus resulting in a simple useful tool for designing practical LSC devices. Calculations are correlated with the experimental results of reabsorption probability obtained by measuring edge fluorescence spectra of various LSCs.

Abstract: Thermochromic smart windows are considered an important element for increasing building energy efficiency. However, the phase transition of conventional devices only depends on the surrounding temperature with solar irradiation, which limits their application under different conditions. Here, a thermoelectrochromic dual response device has been designed by combining thermochromic hydroxypropyl cellulose/potassium chloride (HPC/KCl) hydrogel electrolyte and optothermal electrochromic polyaniline (PANI) films. The thermoelectrochromic device (T-ECD) exhibits electrochromic switchable colour tones (light yellow to purple), visible luminous transmittance (15.70–75.53%), and high solar modulation efficiency (60.89%) when this electrochromic switching is combined with thermochromic phenomenon arising from the electrolyte. Further, since PANI is able to store charge reversibly during the electrochromic transition, this device may also be used as a photovoltaic energy storage. Under solar irradiation, the photothermal effect of PANI films can drive the fast phase transition of HPC/KCl hydrogel. The phase transition time of T-ECD is 30 s which is much faster than 3 min of conventional TCD. In addition, a field test further demonstrates that the house model equipped with the T-ECD can reduce the indoor temperature by 13.3 °C compared with that using a traditional glass window. Thus, it is a valuable device to be used in buildings for energy-saving/storage situations.

Abstract: Composite phase-change materials (CPM) were prepared using polyethylene glycol (PG), polyvinyl butyral (PB) and graphene nanoplates (GP). PG is a phase-change material (PM), PB is used as supporting material, and GP is an additive with high thermal conductivity. The results of Fourier transformation infrared spectroscope (FT–IR) and X–ray diffractometer (XRD) show that there is no chemical reaction among the PB, PG and GP. The CPM was observed with a laminar structure by scanning electronic microscope (SEM). Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) and transient hot–wire conductivity meter were used to measure thermal performance of the CPM. The experimental results indicate that CPM3 has best thermal performance. The CPM3 containing 5 wt% GP has thermal conductivity of 2.04 W/(m⋅K), 8.87 times that of pure PG. The melting temperature and latent heat of the CPM3 are 58.75 °C and 147.81 J/g. Thermal cycling experiments demonstrate the CPM3 possesses good thermal reliability. Therefore, it has application prospects in solar energy utilization, building energy conservation and waste heat recovery.

Abstract: Newly designed polymeric ionic liquid, poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-difluorovinylidene aminooxoethyl-1-butylimidazolium-co-vinylidene aminooxoethyl-1-butylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate) (denoted as PFI-BF4), were successfully synthesized with an intention to form the stable electrospun membranes as quasi-solid-state electrolytes for the use in the electrochromic devices (ECDs). The fluorine atoms in the PFI-BF4 membranes could restrain viologen from being quenched on the cathode. The incorporation of imidazolium entities in the PFI-BF4 membranes could enhance the electrochemical stability and lower the charge transfer resistance at the electrolyte/cathode interface due to the suppression of viologen which are being trapped on the membranes. With an optimal molar ratio of imidazoliums to fluorines on the PFI-BF4 membranes, the viologens would be nearly free from aggregation since the Coulombic attraction towards fluorines and the Coulombic repulsion towards imidazoliums reach equilibrium. After a systematic investigation, the PFI-BF4_1.5 ECD exhibited a high transmittance change (ΔT) of 73.0%, with an effective coloration efficiency (ηe) of 460 cm2 C-1 at 600 nm and fast response times (bleaching time of 3.9 s and coloring time of 1.7 s). Most importantly, the PFI-BF4_1.5 ECD retained 95.9% and 88.3% of its initial ΔT after 10,000 and 50,000 continuous switching cycles, respectively.

Abstract: STAT3, an oncogene drives tumor growth and is associated with poor prognosis. However, small molecule-based STAT3 inhibitors were unsuccessful in clinics. Recently, STAT3 degraders that ubiquitinate STAT3 were found to elicit long-lasting anti-tumor responses. Thus, triggering STAT3 ubiquitination in cancers is a better strategy than STAT3 inhibition. However, not much is known about the identity of E3-ligases that ubiquitinate STAT3 in cancers. Therefore, to design better therapies to degrade STAT3, we sought to identify E3-ligases that ubiquitinate STAT3 in cancer cells. To answer this question, we determined the cell cycle-dependent ubiquitination of STAT3 in HEK293T cells and examined the link between STAT3 dephosphorylation and ubiquitination. We found that STAT3 is more strongly ubiquitinated in mitosis than in other phases of the cell cycle. We observed that APC/C CDH1 binds and ubiquitinates STAT3 in mitosis. Further, we also found that inhibiting phosphatases decreases STAT3 ubiquitination. We conclude that APC/C CDH1 ubiquitinates STAT3 in mitosis. We suggest that mitosis can be a potential therapeutic window for treating STAT3-activated cancers.

Abstract: To meet the demand for smart windows, element doping is widely used as a powerful tool to customize the thermochromic properties of vanadium dioxide (VO2). Here, Mo-doped and F/Mo co-doped VO2 nanoparticles (NPs) are synthesized by the supercritical hydrothermal method. Doped VO2 films show excellent thermochromic properties including the reduced phase transition temperature (Tc = 47.4 °C), enhanced luminous transmittance (Tlum = 59.7%), and high solar energy modulation (ΔTsol=13.7%). Both X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are utilized to study the local structure and chemical valence of the vanadium and molybdenum in the VO2 lattice. Combined Mott's with Peierls's models, the phase transition behavior of the doped VO2 is revealed deeply, i.e., depending on the octahedral symmetry and charge transfer. Additional electron injection seems to play a more important role than structural distortion in decreasing Tc, and F atoms exhibit a higher modulation ability of Tc. In addition, reduced reflectance by doping is responsible for the significantly improved Tlum, while ΔTsol is found to be more sensitive to the film structure. This work uncovers the mechanism behind the phase transition of Mo-doped and F/Mo co-doped VO2 NPs, which is expected to inspire the optimization strategy of element-doped VO2 films served as smart windows.

Abstract: Over the last few years, the silicon photovoltaic industry has been searching for efficient technologies to reduce the cost of cost/Wpeak by improving their conversion efficiency. However, with the silicon solar cell efficiency approaching the theoretical limit, it has become important to increase the efficiency distribution of cells by managing the loss factors existing in the production process. Although some companies are managing the efficiency distribution through in-line analysis equipment, a preventive action for reducing process defects has not yet been accomplished. To prevent process defects in advance, big data management is required to correlate the process conditions and solar cell parameters. Hence, an analysis method that can simply evaluate the detailed properties of completed solar cells is a key technique in future PV industries. In this paper, we introduce an advanced injection-dependent carrier lifetime analysis logic that can subdivide detailed recombination factors by fitting the carrier lifetime graph obtained through Suns-Voc measurement with a theoretical graph. The industrial applicability of this analysis method was tested with 160 commercially manufactured solar cells, demonstrating the expected quantitative gains of low-efficiency solar cells. The results show that the proposed method helps in determining the process priority for improving the efficiency distribution and provides a research direction for increasing the absolute efficiency.

Abstract: This study presents the results of the development of semi-transparent Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGSe) mini-modules for the application in building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV). Applying in-situ X-ray diffraction in real-time during CIGSe growth we find that the bulk of indium-tin-oxide (ITO), acting as the transparent back contact, is chemically stable in CIGSe processing. CIGSe layers grown on reactively sputtered ITO (Ar/O2 flux ratio = 60:1) or on ITO annealed in ambient air have a proportionally higher (220/204) orientation compared to CIGSe layers grown on as fabricated ITO sputtered solely by Ar. However, independent from the fabrication and annealing state of the ITO back contact, after CIGSe deposition at high substrate temperatures ≥600 °C accumulation of Ga at the CIGSe/ITO back contact interface combined with reduced solar cell efficiency is observed. This Ga accumulation visible in elemental depth profiles is attributed to the formation of gallium-oxide (GaOx). Applying a very thin (≈10–30 nm) functional molybdenum layer in between CIGSe and the ITO back contact inhibits the formation of GaOx. Based on this Mo/ITO back contact configuration semi-transparent 10 × 10 cm2 mini-modules with 14 cells interconnected in series have been fabricated. Module parameters resulted in a fill factor of 63% and >12% in efficiency. The solar active coverage of the modules amounts to ≈70%, and the average visible transmittance (in the range 380–780 nm) of the transparent sections was 27.6% (9.6% for the total area of the device). Optimisation of the Mo/ITO contact allows increasing this transparency to values > 50%. Long-term outdoor testing of a semi-transparent module prototype reveals no degradation in electric output power for 3 months, demonstrating the device stability under changing climatic conditions.

Abstract: Porous solar receiver is the key component converting the solar energy to high-temperature thermal energy of working fluid. However, a large pressure drop brings additional energy consumption. In this work, an adjoint algorithm is employed to optimize the structure of tomographied porous solar receiver for reducing pressure drop. To this end, the flow and heat transfer characteristics of the porous receiver are analyzed and compared between the original and optimized receiver. The structural optimization is carried out with a pore-level method, which mainly consists of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and their adjoint counterpart. The results indicate that the pressure drop of the porous receiver decreased significantly after optimization with the porosity unchanged. In addition, although the solid skeleton temperature of the optimized foam is higher, the comprehensive efficiency η = hv/(ΔP)1/3 does not decrease. Finally, it is found that under different inlet velocities between 1 and 5 m/s, the pressure drops of three samples (φ = 0.87, 0.77 and 0.70) are reduced by 30%, 34% and 43% after optimization, respectively. The present work can provide useful guidance for improving the performance of porous volumetric solar receiver.

Abstract: Chemoresistance renders a challenge to the clinics to treat breast cancer patients. Current treatment strategies are effective in mitigating tumor growth but remain largely ineffective against cancer-initiating cells or breast Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs). Epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) regulates breast CSC physiology. Zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) is a key EMT-transcription factor that regulates breast CSC - differentiation and metastasis. However, its potential role in modulating tumor chemoresistance has not yet been fully understood. In-silico analysis revealed a higher ZEB1 expression in breast cancer patients that leads to decreased overall and relapse-free survival. We generated sorted breast CSC with stable ZEB1 overexpression (CD24−/CD44+GFP-ZEB1) and/or silencing (CD24−/CD44+ZEB1 shRNA) as well as breast cancer cells with stable ZEB1 overexpression (CD24+GFP-ZEB1) and/or silencing (CD24+ZEB1 shRNA). An increased colony-forming efficiency and doxorubicin accumulation correlated with decreased promoter activity and expression profile of ABCC1 drug-efflux ABC transporter in CD24−/CD44+GFP-ZEB1. Additionally, CD24−/CD44+GFP-ZEB1 demonstrated doxorubicin-induced higher anti-apoptotic and lower pro-apoptotic protein expressions in the mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions. Chemoresistant CD24−/CD44+GFP-ZEB1 cells depicted 1000-fold higher IC-50 values of doxorubicin and decreased activation of JNK-p38 stress kinase molecular signaling-dependent mammosphere forming efficiency to evade apoptosis. Thus, ZEB1 and its downstream effectors are plausible therapeutic targets for the mitigation of breast cancer chemoresistance in patients.

Abstract: Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) regulates multiple cellular biological processes by activating TGF-β type I receptors (TGFBR1) and type II receptors (TGFBR2), and Hsp90 stabilizes these receptors through specific interactions. In many malignancies, one of the most deregulated signaling pathways is the TGF-β signaling pathway, which is often inactivated by mutations or deregulation of TGF-β type II receptors (TGFBR2). However, the molecular mechanisms are not well understood. In this study, we show that YWK-II/APLP2, an immediately early response gene for TGF-β signaling, inhibits TGF-β signaling by promoting the degradation of the TGFBR2 protein. Knockdown of YWK-II/APLP2 increases the TGFBR2 protein level and sensitizes cells to TGF-β stimulation, while YWK-II/APLP2 overexpression destabilizes TGFBR2 and desensitizes cells to TGF-β. Mechanistically, YWK-II/APLP2 is associated with TGFBR2 in a TGF-β activity-dependent manner, binds to Hsp90 to interfere with the interaction between TGFBR2 and Hsp90, and leads to enhanced ubiquitination and degradation of TGFBR2. Taken together, YWK-II/APLP2 is involved in negatively regulating the duration and intensity of TGF-β/Smad signaling and suggests that aberrantly high expression of YWK-II/APLP2 in malignancies may antagonize the growth inhibition mediated by TGF-β signaling and play a role in carcinogenesis.

Abstract: The daytime radiative coolers offer a sustainable way to passively cool objects under direct sun exposure with the merits of zero energy consumption and zero pollutant generation. However, the ivory or silvery glare in the color of these coolers consequently restricts their practical applications, particularly for functional and aesthetic situations. Here, we present a free-standing, colored, polymer film with composite opal photonic crystal structure that simultaneously achieves color and efficient passive daytime radiative cooling. The polymer optical film composed of flexible inexpensive polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) thin film with embedded three-dimensional (3D), inverse-opal-like TiO2 skeleton nanostructures behaves as a composite opal photonic crystal structure within the visible regime for reflecting specific visible light to generate desired full colorization based on Bragg diffractions. Meanwhile, the embedded TiO2 skeleton nanostructures can also efficiently scatter the rest of unwanted incoming visible light, resulting in high total reflectivity in the sunlight band. Importantly, all developed colored optical films (e.g., red, green, and blue) exhibit strong infrared emissivity both within the second (8–13 μm) and the third (16–26 μm) atmospheric window regions. Consequently, all colored optical films could realize desired subambient temperature drop, and achieve maximum subambient cooling of ∼4.1 °C under strong solar radiation of 854 W m−2. The present work provides a conceptually generic route for both coloration and efficient radiative cooling in a simple and scalable way.

Abstract: Zn−based chloride molten salts have been candidate heat transfer and storage media in solar thermal power attributed to excellent thermal properties and high thermal stability, while associated thermal properties at high temperature are still insufficient in research. In this work, microstructure and thermal properties of NaCl–ZnCl2 molten salt have been investigated by molecular dynamics simulation based on Born−Mayer−Huggins potential and experimental measurement. Encouragingly, the trends of all properties from simulation are consistent with experimental data, and the errors are 6.97% in density and 7.42% in specific heat, respectively. As temperature increases, the distance between ion clusters centers on cations increases and the internal of ion clusters shrinks, thus density and viscosity decrease with the whole structure of NaCl–ZnCl2 becoming looser, and thermal conductivity decreases because smaller Zn–Cl distance in [ZnCln] structure causes shorter phonon mean free path and larger thermal resistance. As content of ZnCl2 decreases, density, specific heat capacity and viscosity decrease with the whole structure becoming looser, but thermal conductivity increases due to larger Zn–Cl distance. Besides, the correlation equations for properties−temperature−composition of NaCl–ZnCl2 (0–100 mol. % ZnCl2, 578 K–1073 K) have been further identified for its utilization in advanced thermal storage systems.

Abstract: Aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) has long been known as a promising low-cost alternative contact to conventional expensive indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) on silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells. However, low fill factor (FF) of the AZO-based SHJ solar cell greatly limits the device performance as well as poses concerns about its commercial potential. Here, we present ITO/AZO/ITO stack as front contact on rear-junction SHJ cell, solving three challenges including sputter damage, bad contact and low conductivity simultaneously that are encountered on pure front AZO-based devices. Additionally, mechanism underlying the superior performance of ITO/AZO/ITO stack is unveiled by the analysis of phase, lifetime and electrical properties followed by Quokka3 simulation of vertical and lateral carrier transport. Then, successfully direct use of pure AZO at rear side of SHJ cell is demonstrated, though with a small increase of total series resistance (Rs). Finally, a champion efficiency of 23.8% with >85% indium reduction is achieved on M2+ size cell by using ITO/AZO/ITO at n-side and pure AZO at p-side, showing a high average efficiency (η ∼ 23.6%) close to that of totally ITO-based references (η ∼ 23.7%). These findings provide a promising way to fabricate low-indium and high-efficiency SHJ cells with commercial potential.

Abstract: Although solar energy is a clean and abundant resource, it has an unstable nature. It is demonstrated that latent thermal energy storage (LTES) systems have been an excellent way to utilize solar energy fully and widely. However, LTES has the problem of insufficient thermal conductivity. For this reason, it is inevitable to consider effective methods to intensify the thermal conductivity of LTES system. In the current study, experiment and numerical simulation are used to study the influence of non-uniform metal foams on heat transfer during phase transition. In this study, a horizontal shell-and-tube LTES test system is established. Moreover, the phase change melting rate of radially filled metal foams with different porosity gradients is compared. According to the numerical simulation results of phase interface, velocity field and temperature field, natural convection can accelerate the melting of PCM. However, there is no distinct effect on the solidification process. When the equivalent porosity is 0.94, the optimal combination (melting process is 0.84-0.92-0.99 and solidification process is 0.87-0.94-0.97), compared with the uniform structure, can shorten the total consumption time by 9.7% and 6.2%, respectively.

Abstract: Recognition of the microbial cell's surface constituents' biophysical properties is an important research topic, allowing a better understanding of the cell's behaviour under different conditions. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed in this study to analyse the basis of the nanomechanical changes in probiotic bacteria under nitrofurantoin, furazolidone, and nitrofurazone exposure. Recorded significant changes in the two Lactobacillus strains cells morphology, topography, and adhesion parameters resulted in the increase of the cells' longitude (up to 2.58 μm), profile height (by around 0.50 μm), and decrease in the adhesion force (up to 13.58 nN). Young's modulus and adhesion energy decreased within 96 h, however with no negative effect on the cells' morphology or loss of structural integrity. Observed modifications present the mode of action of the 5-nitrofuran derivative antibiotics on probiotic biofilm formation and suggest activation of the multilevel adaptation mechanisms to counteract unfavorable environments. A visual change in bacterial morphology such as an increased surface-to-volume ratio might be a link between molecular-level events and outcomes in individual cells and biofilms. This paper for the first time shows, that these antibiotics affect the properties of non-target microorganisms as lactobacilli, and might impair biofilm formation. However, the degree of such transformations depends on the delivered active substance.

Abstract: We perform indoor and outdoor potential-induced degradation (PID) tests for n-type front-emitter (n-FE) crystalline Si (c-Si) photovoltaic (PV) modules and compare their results. The indoor/outdoor acceleration factor for the polarization-type PID (PID-p) of n-FE PV modules is found to be ∼1000 at an indoor test temperature of 85 °C. We observe the progression of the PID-p of n-FE PV modules in rainy days, while their performance is recovered in sunny days. This may be because of the formation of a water film on a module surface acting as a conductive film, resulting in a larger electric field near the n-FE cells in rainy days. The recovery of the PV performance of n-FE modules in sunny days can partly explain the large acceleration factor for the indoor PID test against the outdoor test.

Abstract: High-temperature compatible passivating contacts based on phosphorus doped polysilicon (poly-Si(n)) on a thin silicon oxide, employed on the rear side of bifacial n-PERT like solar cells provide an efficiency increase while being compatible with current photovoltaic manufacturing processes, including the metallization process. However, a simple and cost-effective method for poly-Si(n) deposition is still elusive. Herein, we demonstrate DC-sputtering as a scalable and single side technique for poly-Si(n) manufacturing. First, it is demonstrated how DC-sputtered poly-Si(n) can provide high passivation (iVoc > 730 mV) and low contact resistivity (ρc < 20 mΩ cm2) when metallized by means of screen printing and firing through of Ag paste. Then, M2-sized bifacial n-PERT solar cells featuring the developed DC sputtered poly-Si(n) at the rear side and a homogenous front side B-emitter reaching a certified efficiency of 22.8% are demonstrated. Quokka simulations based on the developed DC sputtered poly-Si(n) indicate a potential up to 24.8% with an upward potential upon optimization of the front side emitter. This work highlights the feasibility of sputtered poly-Si(n) as an enabler for high-efficiency n-type solar cells.

Abstract: Several diseases are associated with improper regulation of the Hippo pathway, which plays an important role in cell proliferation and cancer metastasis. Overactivation of the YAP and TAZ proteins accelerates cell proliferation, invasion, and migration during tumorigenesis. Tolfenamic acid (TA) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that exhibits activity against various types of cancer. In this study, we observed that TA decreased YAP and TAZ protein levels in cancer cells. TA increased the phosphorylation of YAP and TAZ, leading to the degradation of YAP and TAZ in the cytoplasm and nucleus. TA predominantly affected multiple phosphodegron sites in the YAP and TAZ and lowered 14-3-3β protein expression, causing YAP and TAZ to enter the ubiquitination pathway. Proteins that affect YAP and TAZ regulation, such as NAG-1 and several YAP/TAZ E3 ligases, were not involved in TA-mediated YAP/TAZ degradation. In summary, our results indicate that TA affects phosphodegron sites on YAP/TAZ, demonstrating a novel effect of TA in tumorigenesis.

Abstract: The thermal efficiency improvement of solar thermal collectors by improving the absorbing fluid led to the utilization of nanofluids. The MXene nanofluid is an attractive candidate in high-efficiency direct solar thermal absorption applications. In this paper, 2D nanomaterials of thin-layer MXene Ti3C2 were synthesized and water-based MXene Ti3C2 nanofluids were prepared at different mass fractions ranging from 10 to 300 ppm. The suspension stability, optical absorption properties and photo-thermal conversion (PTC) characteristics of MXene Ti3C2 nanofluids were tested and analyzed. The semi-metal induced localized surface plasmon resonance effect of Ti3C2 enhanced the optical absorption capacity and most of solar irradiation could be absorbed in a thin layer of 1.5 cm. The effect of reverse irradiation angles (RIAs) on the PTC performance of MXene Ti3C2 nanofluid-based direct absorption solar collector (DASC) fabricated by a double-layer vacuum quartz glass tube was experimentally investigated at reverse-illumination conditions. To calculate the PTC efficiency of the DASC, a modified model was proposed in terms of temporary temperature profiles. Both the maximum temperature rise and the highest PTC efficiency increased with the RIA. Compared with water, the temperature rises of MXene Ti3C2 nanofluids were increased by 10.2, 10.8, and 11.9 °C at optimal Ti3C2 fractions of 150, 180, and 220 ppm with respect to RIAs of 30°, 45°, and 60°, respectively. At the RIA of 60°, a PTC efficiency of 83.9% was obtained at an optimal fraction of 220 ppm, 63.5% higher than that of water. The MXene Ti3C2 nanofluids exhibit good prospects for solar thermal energy harvest.

Abstract: Microenvironment of the melanoma consists of cellular elements like fibroblasts, adipocytes, and keratinocytes as well as extracellular matrix and physicochemical conditions. In our previous research, we have established that melanoma influences strongly above mentioned cells present in the tumor niche and recruits them to support cancer progression. In this work, we evaluated the impact of cancer-associated cells, namely fibroblasts (CAFs), adipocytes (CAAs), and keratinocytes (CAKs) on melanoma proliferation, signaling pathways activation, metabolism as well as the effectiveness of used anti-cancer therapy. Obtained results indicated elevated phosphorylation of STAT3, upregulated GLUT1 and GLUT3 as well as downregulated of MCT-1 expression level in melanoma cells under the influence of all examined cells present in the tumor niche. The proliferation of melanoma cells was increased after co-culture with CAFs and CAKs, while epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers' expression level was raised in the presence of CAFs and CAAs. The level of perilipin 2 and lipid content was elevated in melanoma cells under the influence of CAAs. Moreover, increased expression of CYP1A1, gene encoding drug metabolizing protein, in melanoma cells co-cultured with CAFs and CAKs prompted us to verify the effectiveness of the previously proposed by us anti-melanoma therapy based on combination of EGFR and MET inhibitors. Obtained results indicate that the designed therapy is still efficient, even if the fibroblasts, adipocytes, and keratinocytes, are present in the melanoma vicinity.

Abstract: The usage of renewable energy is an alternative countermeasure against the ongoing climatic change. In this regard, solar energy has been shown to be one of the best ways to tackle this issue. However, it has been discovered that the effectiveness of the solar panel is significantly influenced by environmental issues (dust, sand, contaminations, among others), which may induce surface erosion thus reducing the overall optical efficiency. We explored the possibility to enhance the erosion resistance for magnetron-sputtered antireflective TiO2/SiO2 coatings by Zr-oxide doping and thermal annealing. When thermally annealed at 400 °C, these coatings demonstrated excellent mechanical (in dynamic conditions) and optical properties compared with the glass substrate. Moreover, laboratory sandstorm testing verified that the coating doped with 1 at.-% Zr and annealed at 400 °C displayed the highest erosion resistance (decreased erosion rate of 98%). Consequently, doped and thermally annealed ARCs offer a unique and promising option to protect the photovoltaic (PV) glass cover against erosive wear thus enhancing the longevity and efficiency (optical and electrical) of commercially available solar panels.

Abstract: The function of ion-transporting Na+,K+-ATPases depends on the surrounding lipid environment in biological membranes. Two established lipid-interaction sites A and B within the transmembrane domain have been observed to induce protein activation and stabilization, respectively. In addition, lipid-mediated inhibition has been assigned to a site C, but with the exact location not experimentally confirmed. Also, possible effects on lipid interactions by disease mutants dwelling in the membrane-protein interface remain relatively uncharacterized. We simulated human Na+,K+-ATPase α1β1FXYD homology models in E1 and E2 states in an asymmetric, multicomponent plasma membrane to determine both wild-type and disease mutant lipid-protein interactions. The simulated wild-type lipid interactions at the established sites A and B were in agreement with experimental results thereby confirming the membrane-protein model system. The less well-characterized, proposed inhibitory site C was dominated by lipids lacking inhibitory properties. Instead, two sites hosting inhibitory lipids were identified at the extracellular side and also a cytoplasmic CHL-binding site that provide putative alternative locations of Na+,K+-ATPase inhibition. Three disease mutations, Leu302Arg, Glu840Arg and Met859Arg resided in the lipid-protein interface and caused drastic changes in the lipid interactions. The simulation results show that lipid interactions to the human Na+,K+-ATPase α1β1FXYD protein in the plasma membrane are highly state-dependent and can be disturbed by disease mutations located in the lipid interface, which can open up for new venues to understand genetic disorders.

Abstract: Replacing silver metallization with earth-abundant materials in Si solar cells is a critical step towards the sustainable growth of photovoltaics. In this work, we investigate fire-through processes using Al for the metallization of solar cells with p-type passivating contacts, with the goal to achieve a thin depth of contact, oppositely to what is used for standard back-surface field Al contacts. The interactions taking place during firing between the different elements in our contact stack (Al, SiNx:H, SiCx(p) and tunnel SiOx) are studied. We discuss how Al and SiNx react during firing by performing contact formation through different nitride layers, and show that increasing the N content of the silicon nitride can reduce Al penetration depth. Finally, we also investigate the mechanisms behind metal-induced passivation degradation and identify possible ways of mitigating them by employing an adapted SiOx/SiCx stack to allow for Ag-free metallization of tunnel oxide passivating contacts.

Abstract: The fabrication conditions of the light absorber layer (organic-inorganic halide perovskite) have a very large effect on the device performance in perovskite solar cells. In case of using the 1-step anti-solvent treatment (AST), their show very different characteristics depending on the AST time, amount, and temperature, etc. Here, we determined the optimal AST time for the synthesis of perovskite light absorber layer in relation to the turbidity point (TP) of the precursor solution during spin coating according to the temperature inside the glovebox. The TP was examined according to the fluid flow of the host solvent, and it depended on various conditions, such as the temperature and substrate. The measured TP was almost identical to the estimated TP, and both tended to decrease as the internal temperature increased. The AST time and the internal temperature of the glovebox significantly affected the crystallinity and device performance of the perovskite, and the best device performance of 18.9% for a methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) solar cell with n-i-p normal planar structure was achieved by applying an AST time of 9.5 s at 25 °C. Drive-level capacitance profiling and thermal admittance spectroscopy results confirmed that the optimal AST time of 9.5 s yielded a minimum trap density of 2.1 × 1015/cm3, which was related to the trap states of MAPbI3.

Abstract: The microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) is a master regulator of the melanocyte cell lineage. Aberrant MITF activity can lead to multiple malignancies including skin cancer, where it modulates the progression and invasiveness of melanoma. MITF-regulated gene expression requires recruitment of the transcriptional co-regulator CBP/p300, but details of this process are not fully defined. In this study, we investigate the structural and functional interaction between the MITF N-terminal transactivation domain (MITFTAD) and CBP/p300. Using pulldown assays and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy we determined that MITFTAD is intrinsically disordered and binds to the TAZ1 and TAZ2 domains of CBP/p300 with moderate affinity. The solution-state structure of the MITFTAD:TAZ2 complex reveals that MITF interacts with a hydrophobic surface of TAZ2, while remaining somewhat dynamic. Peptide array and mutagenesis experiments determined that an acidic motif is integral to the MITFTAD:TAZ2 interaction and is necessary for transcriptional activity of MITF. Peptides that bind to the same surface of TAZ2 as MITFTAD, such as the adenoviral protein E1A, are capable of displacing MITF from TAZ2 and inhibiting transactivation. These findings provide insight into co-activator recruitment by MITF that are fundamental to our understanding of MITF targeted gene regulation and melanoma biology.

Abstract: Two-step sequential spin-coating method has been widely used to prepare mixed FA/Cs and FA/MA/Cs perovskite solar cells. However, due to the extremely low solubility of Cs salts in the commonly used isopropanol solvent, which is used to dissolve the organic salts, the Cs salts can only be dissolved into the PbI2 precursors with mixed DMF/DMSO solvent. Herein, we have proposed a modified two-step sequential spin-coating method to solve the above problem. A mixed solvent consisting of ethanol and methanol is used to dissolve the CsI, FAI, and MACl at the same time. The solubility of CsI in the mixed ethanol/methanol solvent can be tuned by varying the ethanol/methanol ratio. After optimizing the ethanol/methanol ratio, high quality FA1-xCsxPbI3 perovskite film with large perovskite crystal, low defect density and long carrier life time can be obtained using our modified two-step sequential spin-coating method, which can result in a perovskite solar cell with champion power conversion efficiencies of 21.17% (cell area 0.1 cm2) and 14.65% (cell area 0.25 cm2) respectively. Our study provides a new method for fabricating mixed FA/Cs perovskite solar cells using CsI containing organic salts solution, which can be further optimized to fabricate highly efficient perovskite solar cells.

Abstract: Multiple rounds of DNA replication take place in various stages of the life cycle in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Previous bioinformatics analysis has shown the presence of putative Autonomously Replicating Sequence (ARS) like sequences in the Plasmodium genome. However, the actual sites and frequency of replication origins in the P. falciparum genome based on experimental data still remain elusive. Minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins are recruited by the Origin recognition complex (ORC) to the origins of replication in eukaryotes including P. falciparum. We used PfMCM6 for chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) in the quest for identification of putative replication origins in the parasite. PfMCM6 DNA binding sites annotation revealed high enrichment at exon regions. This is contrary to higher eukaryotes that show an inclination of origin sites towards transcriptional start sites. ChIP-seq results were further validated by ChIP-qPCR results as well as nascent strand abundance assay at the selected PfMCM6 enriched sites that also showed preferential binding of PfORC1 suggesting potential of these sites as origin sites. Further, PfMCM6 ChIP-seq data showed a positive correlation with previously published histone H4K8Ac genome-wide binding sites but not with H3K9Ac sites suggesting epigenetic control of replication initiation sites in the parasites. Overall, our data show the genome-wide distribution of PfMCM6 binding sites with their potential as replication origins in this deadly human pathogen that not only broadens our knowledge of parasite DNA replication and its unique biology, it may help to find new avenues for intervention processes.

Abstract: Solar energy will be a crucial part of the sustainable, fossil free energy production of the future. A majority of this will be produced by solar collectors and photovoltaics. Important for the efficient utilization of the incident solar energy for both technologies are a cover glass with antireflective coatings giving it a high solar transmittance. In the current paper we describe the development of antireflective mesoporous silica coatings on low-iron float glass using the aerosol-based nFOG™ deposition technique. The coatings exhibit a hexagonal and closed pore structure, high smoothness, superhydrophilic properties (contact angle <5°) and consistent thicknesses of approximately 110 nm. This is in line with optimal thickness determined from simulations of the antireflective behavior. Low-iron float glass coated on both sides show a highly reproducible solar weighted transmittance of 95% in the wavelength range 300–2500 nm and an antireflective effect increasing with incident angle. The smoothness, closed pores and low contact angle indicate a high cleanability, which in combination with the high transmittance render a competitive broadband antireflective coating well adapted for solar glass applications.

Abstract: Kesterite [Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe)], which is one of the most promising solar cell materials, can be used as a light absorber owing to its suitable optical and electrical properties. In this study, the optimization process of NaF layers was performed in the deposition of the precursor stacks of Sn/Cu/Zn/Mo to form CZTSSe thin films. The distribution of the secondary phases on the CZTSSe surfaces strongly depends on the insertion of the NaF layer. In particular, the Cu2-xS binary phase increases with the closeness of the insertion location of the NaF layer to the front side. Moreover, the grain boundary properties can be altered by varying the deposition conditions since Na segregation and defect formation affect the surface electrical properties and carrier transport mechanism. Photo-assisted conductive-atomic force microscopy was used to measure the local variation in the surface photocurrent flow into the CZTSSe grains, and the incorporation of sodium increased the surface current formation. This study exhibits the effects of Na on the optimal growth of kesterite formation and carrier transport of the relevant photovoltaic devices.

Abstract: In this work we present the design, assembly and characterization of a tandem photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell based on two different crystallographic phases of sub-stoichiometric copper telluride nanocrystals (NCs). The first one, a pseudo-cubic phase, pc-Cu2-xTe, is characterized by positive photocurrents, while the second one, a hexagonal phase, h-Cu2-xTe, favors negative ones. Taking advantage of the different optoelectronic properties of the two Cu2-xTe structures, we prepared a PEC cell composed of a hybrid pc-Cu2-xTe/TiO2 photoanode, with TiO2 acting as a light absorber and electron selective layer, and a h-Cu2-xTe/CuI photocathode, with CuI behaving as a photo-absorber and hole selective layer. The tandem PEC cell shows a photocurrent density of ∼0.5 mA/cm2 when measured in a 2-electrode configuration without any co-catalyst. Finally, to test the PEC cell performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), a thin film of Pt was deposited on top of the photocathode and ∼7 μmol of hydrogen were obtained at 0.6 V in a 1-h experiment, reaching a photocurrent of 1 mA/cm2 with no losses.

Abstract: We are reporting the fabrication of high efficiency Silicon heterojunction shingle solar cells with very limited performance losses related to the cell separation. A clean and innovative separation process was elaborated and optimized, based on 45° rotated silicon brick and wafers fabrication, allowing the alignment of the preferential cleavage plan (110) with the solar cells bus bars. Hence, a simple but efficient mechanical crack propagation was sufficient to insure a proper shingles cell cut. The smooth resulting solar cell edges were found to be sensitive to surface passivation technologies. Aluminum oxide layers fabricated by atomic layer deposition were specifically developed so that their activation process is fully compatible with heterojunction low temperature constraints (typically less than 220°C). Interestingly, we showed that the annealing temperature alone was not sufficient to activate such layers; alternative forming gas annealing and/or light soaking treatments were thus successfully applied instead with very high passivation values measured on bare samples. Such layers were then deposited and activated on 45° wafer based cleaved heterojunction solar cells edges. Applied for example on heterojunction shingle cell configuration, we managed to recover up to 80% of the initial efficiency loss due to the separation, limiting the overall efficiency losses to less than 0.2% absolute.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a notable increase in cancer incidence and mortality, and immune abnormalities have been closely linked to malignancy development. TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) is a non-classical IκB kinase that regulates interferon and NF-κB signaling pathways and plays a crucial role in innate immunity. Recent studies have shown high expression levels of TBK1 and increased activity in various tumor cells, suggesting its involvement in the development and progression of multiple cancers. Targeting TBK1 for tumor therapy may be a possibility. However, little is known about the abnormal activation and dynamic regulation of TBK1 in cancer. First, we utilized the BioID biotinylation technique combined with TMT-based quantitative proteomics to analyze the TBK1 interacting proteins. Our results revealed that TXLNA interacts with TBK1 and binds to the α-helical scaffold of TBK1. The expression of TXLNA could affect the S172 phosphorylation of TBK1. PPM1B is a phosphatase that can dephosphorylate TBK1 S172, so we used the APEX2 proximity labeling technique combined with TMT-based quantitative proteomics to explore the interacting proteins of PPM1B and search for the regulatory pathway of TXLNA on TBK1 phosphorylation. We found that PPM1B interacts with TXLNA. Based on these results, we further found that TXLNA impairs the binding of PPM1B to TBK1, inhibiting the dephosphorylation of TBK1 and contributing to the abnormal enhancement of TBK1 activity in cancer cells. This study sheds light on the potential mechanism of aberrant activation and dynamic regulation of TBK1 in tumors and provides a potential target for tumor therapy.

Abstract: Background
Psoriasis is a common inflammatory skin disease characterized by the excessive proliferation and abnormal differentiation of keratinocytes. Protein kinases could act on intracellular signaling pathways associated with cell proliferation.
Objective
Identifying more hub protein kinases affecting cellular and molecular processes in psoriasis, and exploring the dynamic effects of baicalin and NEK2 on the IL-22-induced cellular inflammation and IMQ-induced psoriasis-like mice.
Methods and results
In this study, differentially expressed protein kinases playing a hub role in psoriasis initiation and development were identified using integrative bioinformatics analyses, and NEK2 has been chosen. NEK2 was significantly up-regulated in psoriatic samples according to online datasets and experimental analyses. In IL-22-induced cellular inflammation model in HaCaT cells, NEK2 overexpression promoted, whereas NEK2 knockdown partially abolished IL-22-induced alterations in cell viability, DNA synthesis, cytokine levels, as well as STAT3 phosphorylation and p-RB, cyclin D1, CDK4, and CDK6 protein contents. Baicalin treatment partially suppressed IL-22-induced HaCaT cell viability, DNA synthesis, and increases in cytokine levels, whereas NEK2 overexpression significantly abolished Baicalin-induced protection against cellular inflammation. In IMQ-induced psoriasis-like skin inflammation model in mice, baicalin markedly ameliorated IMQ-induced psoriasis-like symptoms and local skin inflammation, whereas NEK2 overexpression partially eliminated the therapeutic effects of baicalin.
Conclusion
NEK2, up-regulated in psoriatic lesion skin, could aggravate IMQ-induced psoriasis-like dermatitis and attenuate the therapeutic efficiency of baicalin through promoting keratinocyte proliferation and cytokine levels. The STAT3 signaling might be involved.

Abstract: Liver fibrosis is characterized by the excessive deposition of extracellular matrix in liver. Chronic liver injury induces the activation of hepatic stellate cell (HSCs), a key step in liver fibrogenesis. The activated HSC is the primary source of ECM and contributes significantly to liver fibrosis. TGFβ1 is the most potent pro-fibrotic cytokine. Bromodomain protein 4 (BrD4), an epigenetic reader of histone acetylation marks, was crucial for profibrotic gene expression in HSCs. The present study aimed to investigate the roles of BRD4 in TGFβ1-dependent HSC activation and liver fibrosis, focusing on TGFβ1-induced alterations of the levels of the fibrotic-related important proteins in HSCs by employing the heterozygous TGFβ1 knockout mice and BrD4 knockdown in vivo and in vitro. Results revealed that BrD4 protein level was significantly upregulated by TGFβ1 and BrD4 knockdown reduced TGFβ1-induced HSC activation and liver fibrosis. BrD4 was required for the influences of TGFβ1 on PDGFβ receptor and on the pathways of Smad3, Stat3, and Akt. BrD4 also mediated TGFβ1-induced increases in histone acetyltransferase p300, the pivotal pro-inflammatory NFkB p65, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 whereas BrD4 reduced Caspase-3 protein levels in HSCs during liver injury, independent of TGFβ1. Further experiments indicated the interaction between TGFβ1-induced BrD4 and NFkB p65 in HSCs and in liver of TAA-induced liver injury. Human cirrhotic livers were demonstrated a parallel increase in the protein levels of BrD4 and NFkB p65 in HSCs. This study revealed that BrD4 was a key molecular driver of TGFβ1-induced HSC activation and liver fibrosis.

Abstract: Even though interdigitated back contact (IBC) architecture produces the most efficient solar cells, it is difficult to make them cost-effective and industrially viable. Therefore, single-sided atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) is investigated for the fabrication of IBC solar cells because it reduces the overall thermal budget, simplifies wet bench processing, and requires no additional masking layer. For the fabrication of a full APCVD IBC solar cell, a very lightly doped front surface field (FSF) of 650 Ω/sq, a heavier doped back surface field (BSF) of 100 Ω/sq and a moderately doped emitter of 250 Ω/sq was used. The high-temperature annealing step is partially done in an oxygen (O2) environment to (i) drive in dopants, (ii) prevent the formation of a boron-rich layer in case of p+ doped c-Si, and (iii) grow an in-situ SiO2 at the Si/dopant glass interface. The etch rate difference between the in-situ grown SiO2 and the doped glass layer is utilized to etch the doped glass completely. The retained in-situ SiO2 after etching is capped with plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposited (PECVD) SiNx for the passivation of both polarities of IBC solar cells. A full APCVD IBC solar cell precursors (i.e. before metallization) obtained implied open-circuit voltage (iVoc) of 714 mV and emitter saturation current density (J0s) of 17 fA/cm2. At the device level, a full APCVD IBC solar cell achieved a conversion efficiency of 22.8% with Voc of 696 mV and short-circuit current density JSC of 41.3 mA/cm2. These parameters are comparable to the commercially available full-tube diffused ZEBRA® IBC solar cells.

Abstract: In the current study, molten NaNO3 shape-stabilized phase change materials (SS-PCMs) based on anorthite ceramic and cordierite ceramic were prepared by cold-press sintering method. Chemical compatibility and wettability were considered simultaneously to determine whether the ceramics were qualified as supporting skeleton and the enhancement of the thermal properties of NaNO3 by the ceramics was also investigated. It was found that both anorthite ceramic and cordierite ceramic have good chemical compatibility with NaNO3 and no chemical reaction occurred between them. Physical compatibility was evaluated by measuring the contact angle of molten NaNO3 on a ceramic substrate. Cordierite ceramic exhibited better wettability than anorthite ceramic, although both of the contact angles decreased gradually with increasing temperature. The supercooling of the prepared anorthite ceramic-based SS-PCMs with 45 wt% NaNO3 (45ASS-PCMs) was only 0.7 °C, which was less than 2.5 °C for pure NaNO3 and 2.0 °C for cordierite ceramic-based SS-PCMs with 45 wt% NaNO3 (45CSS-PCMs). The phase transition enthalpy loss of 45ASS-PCMs after 100 thermal cycles was less than 2%, while 45CSS-PCMs reached more than 5%. Anorthite ceramic showed better capabilities than cordierite ceramic in terms of thermal reliability and stability, while cordierite ceramic was better than anorthite ceramic in enhancing thermal conductivity. The evaluation method proposed in this study provided favorable guidance for the matching of PCMs and ceramic supporting skeleton.

Abstract: Heat storage is a promising method for enhancing the utilization efficiency of new energy by providing a stable heat supply drawn from a discontinuous new energy source. The disadvantages of phase change materials are well known—such as supercooling during solidification and low conductivity. This article introduces the development of four novel composite phase change materials (CPCMs) based on sodium acetate trihydrate (SAT). The additives include carboxyl methyl cellulose (CMC) working as the thickener and gamma alumina (γ-Al2O3), sodium chloride (NaCl), multi-walled carbon nanotube(CNT), sodium chloride combined with multi-walled carbon nanotube(NaCl/CNT) working as the nucleating agents. The experimental results showed these CPCMs performed well during solidification with the supercooling lower than 2.5 °C, and the nucleating agents can improve the thermal conductivity to 1.26 W/(m⋅K) and achieved an acceptable thermal stability by a supercooling deterioration to 3.7 °C after 100 thermal cycles. The raised thermal conductivity, however, created a temperature descending stage during the solidification process, and induced the deterioration of the supercooling reduction. NaCl/CNT had an outstanding effect on reducing the supercooling to 0.2 °C. The CPCM with the dual nucleating agent possessed a melting temperature of 55.9 °C and a latent heat of 243.5J/g.

Abstract: Nowadays, as a standard practice, the cover glasses for commercial photovoltaic (PV) modules are coated with antireflection coatings (ARCs). The most used ARC in the market consists of single-layer inner-pore silica (SiO2) where hollow silica beads are incorporated into the coating. To match the lifespan of installed modules, ARCs are expected to resist the harsh abrasion from brush cleaning and withstand severe environments. With the exponential growth of worldwide solar module deployment, understanding the outdoor performance and reliability of these ARCs is imperative. In this work, multiple typical AR coated commercial solar glass specimens from various manufacturers were characterized in terms of their optical property, abrasion resistance and outdoor reliability. Open-pore and dense silica samples were also fabricated and characterized for parallel comparison. It was found that dense ARCs present much better durability compared to inner-pore and open-pore ARCs, enabling a much longer lifespan although optical benefits were reduced. Furthermore, double-layer dense ARCs were investigated for boosting durability as well as maintaining a reasonable optical enhancement compared to single-layer ARC. These findings provide substantial guidance on the optimization of sustainable future commercial ARCs.

Abstract: Phase change materials (PCMs) have the advantages of high heat storage density and wide phase transition temperature, which can effectively solve the intermittent and random problems of solar energy. However, problems such as low light conversion efficiency and easy leakage of PCMs limit their application in the field of solar water heating. In this work, graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) aerogel is prepared by mixing GNPs with solidum alginate by freeze-drying method. Then, composite PCMs with high latent heat and photothermal conversion efficiency are successfully prepared by impregnation polyethylene glycol (PEG) mixed with aluminum nitride (AlN) into GNPs aerogel. GNPs aerogel exhibits lighter mass and obvious pore structure, and the adsorption rate of PEG can be as high as 87%. The prepared composite PCM with 1% AlN (mass fraction) exhibits 176.6 J/g and the photothermal conversion efficiency is 80.3%. Moreover, the encapsulated PEG maintains good shape stability and only loses 0.4% in heat storage capacity after 100 cycles. These properties make it present great potential in the practical application of solar water heaters.

Abstract: Hydroquinone, a potent toxic agent of cigarette smoke, damages retinal pigmented epithelial cells by triggering oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, two events causally related to the development and progression of retinal diseases. The inner mitochondrial membrane is enriched in cardiolipin, a phospholipid susceptible of oxidative modifications which determine cell-fate decision. Using ARPE-19 cell line as a model of retinal pigmented epithelium, we analyzed the potential involvement of cardiolipin in hydroquinone toxicity. Hydroquinone exposure caused an early concentration-dependent increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, and rise in the rate of oxygen consumption not accompanied by changes in ATP levels. Despite mitochondrial impairment, cell viability was preserved. Hydroquinone induced cardiolipin translocation to the outer mitochondrial membrane, and an increase in the colocalization of the autophagosome adapter protein LC3 with mitochondria, indicating the induction of protective mitophagy. A prolonged hydroquinone treatment induced pyroptotic cell death by cardiolipin-mediated caspase-1 and gasdermin-D activation. Cardiolipin-specific antioxidants counteracted hydroquinone effects pointing out that cardiolipin can act as a mitochondrial “eat-me signal” or as a pyroptotic cell death trigger. Our results indicate that cardiolipin may act as a timer for the mitophagy to pyroptosis switch and propose cardiolipin-targeting compounds as promising approaches for the treatment of oxidative stress-related retinal diseases.

Abstract: In electrochromic devices (ECDs), ion conducting layer has the vital function of conducting ions and blocking electrons. However, the limited electron blocking ability and preparation technology of conventional ion conducting materials hinder the commercial application of all-solid-state ECDs. In this work, a novel ion conducting material Si3N4 film was deposited by pulsed direct current (p-DC) reactive magnetron sputtering with a Si target, and shows promising potential due to its ultrahigh transparency, anti-reflection effect and remarkable electron blocking ability. An ECD with the structure of glass/ITO/WO3/Li/Si3N4/NiO/ITO has been fabricated by magnetron sputtering, in which Si3N4 film was used as ion conducting layer for the first time. The ECD presents much less leakage current density (<35 μA cm−2), large optical transmittance modulation (72.3% at 625 nm), fast response (1.3 s for bleaching and 13.1 s for coloring), high coloration efficiency (94.46 cm2 C−1) and excellent cycle stability (91.4% retention of the maximum optical modulation after 10,000 cycles). This work not only demonstrates the great prospect of Si3N4 film as an ion conducting layer in ECDs, but also provides a new idea in the selection of ion conducting materials for developing high-performance inorganic all-solid-state ECDs.

Abstract: Perimeter recombination is one of the causes identified for having a nonuniform luminescent coupling effect in III-V multijunction solar cells. A potential solution could be the electrical passivation of the multijunction solar cell perimeter. To test this hypothesis, electrical passivation of InGaP/GaAs/Ge 3-junction solar cells was done by the atomic layer deposition of thin Al2O3 films. Perimeter passivation of a 3-junction solar cell relatively increased current collection measured at luminescent coupling and direct subcell excitation by as much as 11.4% and 29.8%, respectively. Meanwhile, the current homogeneity improved relatively by as much as 7.9% after electrical passivation. At 1-sun global standard illumination (AM 1.5G), 0.2% absolute conversion efficiency increase was achieved. Therefore, electrical passivation of fully working III-V multijunction solar cells is a non-invasive, post-treatment process that can recover losses due to surface defects caused by oxidation.

Abstract: The Na+,K+-ATPase (NKA) and non-gastric H+,K+- ATPase (ngHKA) share ~65 % sequence identity, and nearly identical catalytic cycles. These pumps alternate between inward-facing (E1) and outward-facing (E2) conformations and differ in their exported substrate (Na+ or H+) and stoichiometries (3 Na+:2 K+ or 1 H+:1 K+). We reported that structures of the NKA-mimetic ngHKA mutant K794S/A797P/W940/R949C (SPWC) with 2 K+ occluded in E2-Pi and 3 Na+-bound in E1·ATP states were nearly identical to NKA structures in equivalent states. Here we report the cryo-EM structures of K794A and K794S, two poorly-selective ngHKA mutants, under conditions to stabilize the E1·ATP state. Unexpectedly, the structures show a hybrid with both E1- and E2-like structural features. While transmembrane segments TM1-TM3 and TM4's extracellular half adopted an E2-like conformation, the rest of the protein assumed an E1 configuration. Two spherical densities, likely bound Na+, were observed at cation-binding sites I and III, without density at site II. This explains the E2-like conformation of TM4's exoplasmic half. In NKA, oxygen atoms derived from the unwound portion of TM4 coordinated Na+ at site II. Thus, the lack of Na+ at site II of K794A/S prevents the luminal portion of TM4 from taking an E1-like position. The K794A structure also suggests that incomplete coordination of Na+ at site III induces the halfway rotation of TM6, which impairs Na+-binding at the site II. Thus, our observations provide insight into the molecular mechanism of E2-E1 transition and cooperative Na+-binding in the NKA and other related cation pumps.

Abstract: Desalination of seawater using solar energy is an effective and environmentally friendly means to solve the chronic freshwater shortage problem. However, the low conversion rate of solar energy seriously affects the application of solar energy in the field of solar thermal conversion. In this regard, we present polydopamine (PDA) loaded woods with an array structure as solar interfacial evaporators for high-efficiency solar vapor generation. It was found that the solar interfacial evaporators made of PDA/wood composites demonstrated excellent solar absorption rate (up to 93%) and the highest solar vapor generation efficiency of 97.6% under one solar illumination. It is worth mentioning that in the simulated seawater experiments, the array structure showed outstanding salt-rejected performance in 3.5% and 20% NaCl solutions, mightily thanks to the original microporous channels of the wood and the artificial millimeter cut marks. Based on the above conditions, the efficiency of PDACW-7 × 7 in simulated seawater with different salinities (3.5 and 20 wt%) under 1 kW m−2 irradiation remained at about 96.1% and 81.9%. Therefore, due to the high light absorption rate and low cost, PDA/wood composites could have good prospect in the field of solar thermal conversion and seawater desalination.

Abstract: Substitution of expensive silver paste becomes essential for mass production of silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell, which calls for high efficiency and low-cost metallization techniques. Copper metallization together with multi-busbar cell interconnection is considered as effective way to low shading loss and electrode ohmic loss. While, the electrode adhesion and parasitic plating are the key process challenges limiting the copper metallization of SHJ solar cells. In this research, the copper plated SHJ solar cells with high electrode aspect ratio and an efficiency of 23.35% have been achieved on M2 wafers. The SEM images show the holes in the plated layers will deteriorate the adhesion between plated copper and seed-layer. The glass/back sheet structure (GBS) modules have been laminated to evaluate the influence of parasitic plating on damp-heat (DH) performance. The degradation in output power (Pmax) is up to 4.90%, which is primarily due to a decreased open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF). It can be ascribed to the deteriorated surface recombination and interconnection. Although the parasitic plating on the wafer edge has ignorable influence on damp heat test after etch-back process, it is still necessary to protect the cell edge to avoid parasitic plating. The research evaluates the process challenges of copper metallization of SHJ solar cells, which offers a refer for achieving high reliability and low levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of photovoltaic power generation.

Abstract: Thermochemical energy storage (TCES) in salt hydrates is a promising method for seasonal thermal energy storage. However, salt hydrates suffer from agglomeration and deliquescence drastically degrading their performance after just a few cycles. Here, modified dry water-style preparation methods are developed for leakage-free microencapsulation of CaCl2 with hydrophobic fumed silica nanoparticles. Using a novel phase inversion method, as little as 2 wt% of silica is needed for complete encapsulation, ensuring exceptionally high gravimetric energy storage densities up to 98% of pure CaCl2. With temperature lifts of 30 °C, volumetric energy storage densities up to 1.4 GJ/m3 are shown to be achievable. These values are unprecedented for cycle-stable sorption TCES materials. Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and laser diffraction analysis confirm the encapsulation of CaCl2 into capsules with volume median diameters ranging from 90 to 210 μm depending on silica content and preparation method. The encapsulated CaCl2 deliquesces with lower water vapor pressures than pure CaCl2 and no formation of tetrahydrate and hexahydrate is observed. Despite deliquescence, the encapsulated CaCl2 is completely stable for at least 30 cycles of charge-discharge. Thus, the new materials show excellent potential for seasonal thermal energy storage.

Abstract: The ever-increasing global energy consumption has brought intense concerns about the deficiency of non-renewable energy resources. In the meantime, cooling inevitably plays an indispensable role in daily life by consuming energy. Therefore, passive radiative cooling has gradually attracted more attention due to its vast potential to reduce energy consumption. Herein, a porous polymer radiative coating (PPRC) with poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropene) (P(VDF-HFP)) is fabricated and the cooling performance is evaluated. The spectral reflectivity of a 360-μm thick PPRC within the wavelength band of 0.38–0.78 μm (visible wavelength band) and the wavelength band of 0.25–2.5 μm (ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared wavelength band) is measured to be about 93% and 87%, while the emissivity within the wavelength band of 8–13 μm (atmospheric window) is measured to be about 94%, indicating that the fabricated PPRC can produce a remarkable radiative cooling capability. The efficient optical properties of the PPRC originate from the high reflective capability of the nano/micro-porous structures and the high emissive capability of the intrinsic material feature. The PPRC cooler can continuously show outstanding cooling performance outdoors due to its angular-independent reflectivity, long-term stability, and high static water contact angle. The outdoor cooling performance test results show that the temperature drop and cooling power of the PPRC cooler can reach 7.6 °C and 85.9 W/m2 at noon. At the same time, they can further be increased by 25% and 15% by adopting a nano-porous polyethene (PE) shield under the same conditions relying on the auxiliary reflection by nano-porous PE film. In a word, the environmental-friendly PPRC cooler is likely to have a growing influence in the foreseeable future for energy saving and emission reduction.

Abstract: Cytoglobin (Cygb) is an evolutionary ancient heme protein with yet unclear physiological function(s). Mammalian Cygb is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues and is proposed to be involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification, nitric oxide (NO) metabolism and lipid-based signaling processes. Loss-of-function studies in mouse associate Cygb with apoptosis, inflammation, fibrosis, cardiovascular dysfunction or oncogenesis. In zebrafish (Danio rerio), two cygb genes exist, cytoglobin 1 (cygb1) and cytoglobin 2 (cygb2). Both have different coordination states and distinct expression sites within zebrafish tissues. The biological roles of the cygb paralogs are largely uncharacterized. We used a CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing approach and generated a knockout of the penta-coordinated cygb1 for in vivo analysis. Adult male cygb1 knockouts develop phenotypic abnormalities, including weight loss. To identify the molecular mechanisms underlying the occurrence of these phenotypes and differentiate between function and effect of the knockout we compared the transcriptomes of cygb1 knockout at different ages to age-matched wild-type zebrafish. We found that immune regulatory and cell cycle regulatory transcripts (e.g. tp53) were up-regulated in the cygb1 knockout liver. Additionally, the expression of transcripts involved in lipid metabolism and transport, the antioxidative defense and iron homeostasis was affected in the cygb1 knockout. Cygb1 may function as an anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective factor in zebrafish liver, and may be involved in lipid-, iron-, and ROS-dependent signaling.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in understanding the biological behavior of osteosarcoma (OS), OS is still the most common primary bone sarcoma that endangers the health of children and adolescents. High-temperature requirement A (HTRA) protease family plays an important regulatory role in numerous malignancies and acts as a prognostic biomarker. However, the function and underlying mechanisms of the HTRA family in OS development remain unknown. Through analyzing the GSE126209 dataset obtained from different Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases, we found that HTRA3 as a member of the HTRA family was downregulated in OS tissues compared with that in normal tissues. Functional experiments indicated that HTRA3 overexpression suppressed malignant behaviors of OS cells in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, we found that HTRA3 co-localized with the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) and decreased XIAP stability. Further investigation showed that XIAP knockdown inhibited the degradation of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and that HTRA3 caused the blockage of PTEN/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway, characterized as the reverse of cell function caused by HTRA3 overexpression after PTEN inhibitor BpV (HOpic) treatment. Detailed investigations showed that forkhead box protein 1 (FOXP1), an oncogene in OS progression, downregulated HTRA3 expression and inhibited the transcriptional activity of HTRA3, suggesting that HTRA3 was regulated negatively by FOXP1. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that HTRA3 is a repressor involved in OS development via the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway under the modulation of transcription factor FOXP1, and it may provide a therapeutic direction for OS patients.

Abstract: NAADP is one of the most potent calcium mobilizing second messengers. Only recently, two NAADP-binding proteins have been identified: HN1L/JPT2 and LSM12. Further, ASPDH was suggested as a less selective binding partner. Apart from this newly uncovered link, little is known about the shared mechanisms between these proteins. The aim of this review is to assess potential functional connections between NAADP and its binding proteins. We here give a description of two major links. For one, HN1L/JPT2 and LSM12 both have potent oncogenic functions in several cancer types. Second, they are involved in similar cellular pathways in both cancer and immunity.

Abstract: Photonic curing is a thin-film processing technique that can enable high-throughput perovskite solar cell (PSC) manufacturing. However, photonic curing has many variables that can affect the processing outcome, making optimization challenging. Here, we introduce Bayesian Optimization (BO), a machine-learning framework, to optimize the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of photonically cured MAPbI3 PSCs on ITO-coated Willow Glass. We apply BO with four input variables—MAPbI3 concentration, additive CH2I2 volume, pulse voltage, and pulse length. These input variables were dynamically adjusted in response to the new data, an example of a human-machine partnership. With the limited experimental budget of 48 conditions, we achieved a champion PCE of 11.42% and predicted 14 new conditions resulting in >10% PCE. Beyond simple optimization, we examined the relationships between pairs of inputs with two-dimensional contour plots and investigated the relative importance of each input to gain insight into photonic curing. We demonstrate that BO is a powerful tool in process optimization and can be adapted to other PSC manufacturing cases.

Abstract: The Kesterite solar cells research landscape is at a crossroad and despite a much improved understanding of the limitations of this class of materials, the current performance deficit contrasts with the several other thin film technologies reaching conversion efficiency values well above 20%. It is more important than ever for the Kesterite community to collaborate directly or indirectly and data sharing is an essential building block in that regard. This work proposes a detailed set of modelling baselines and parameters, based on a consistent set of properties obtained with experimental devices made by our group. These parameters permit to accurately reproduce all photovoltaic figures of merits of reference experimental Kesterite cells with a relative accuracy of 1% or less. As a case study, and using optical modelling based on the transfer matrix method in complement, the potential of Kesterite materials in tandem devices with either a Perovskite or a Crystalline Silicon partner is evaluated. It is found that a moderate improvement of pure selenium CZTSe, feasible in the short to middle term, would realistically permit to use this material as bottom subcell in tandem with a Perovskite top cell and obtain efficiencies reaching the 30% threshold. On the other hand, using a Kesterite absorber in a top subcell with a silicon bottom subcell appears as particularly ambitious even when considering several important optimizations to the material, and it is believed that only an important breakthrough would render this material viable for such application. The complete set of material parameters, optical indices and modelling files are shared for the Kesterite community to use and build improve upon.

Abstract: Light-induced degradation (LID) in boron (B)-doped Czochralski (Cz) silicon wafers has impacted commercial p-type silicon solar cells for decades. Substitution of boron with gallium (Ga) or (to a lesser extent) indium (In) has been suggested as a method to tackle this problem since Ga- and In-doped Cz wafers were shown to be less prone to LID. Although less prone to LID, several studies have reported some LID in these materials. In this study, LID in Ga- and In-doped Cz wafers is investigated. First, it is shown that LID is present in both materials. The degradation has two stages (fast and slow) for Ga-doped wafers and one stage for In-doped wafers. By performing the degradation at different temperatures, the activation energy of the defect formation is determined to be 0.74 ± 0.10 eV for the slow step in Ga-doped and 0.91 ± 0.15 eV for In-doped wafers. We then investigate defect deactivation with dark annealing. Both Ga- and In-doped wafers demonstrate a two-stage defect deactivation. Similar to defect formation, the defect deactivation activation energies are determined and reported. Finally, the focus is shifted to investigating the degradation mechanism in Ga-doped wafers, since they are currently the dominating wafer substrate for photovoltaic applications. It is shown that a three-state mechanism (“annealed”, “degraded”, and “stabilised”), similar to boron-oxygen (BO)-related defects, can explain their degradation. It seems the four-state model, suggested for the light- and elevated temperature-induced degradation, is not suitable for describing the degradation in Ga-doped Cz wafers.

Abstract: KIFC1, a member of kinesin-14 subfamily motors, is essential for meiotic cell division and acrosome formation during spermatogenesis. However, the functions of KIFC1 in the formation and maintenance of the acrosome in male germ cells remain to be elucidated. In this study, we report the structural deformities of acrosomes in the in vivo KIFC1 inhibition mouse models. The proacrosomal vesicles diffuse into the cytoplasm and form atypical acrosomal granules. This phenotype is consistent with globozoospermia patients and probably results from the failure of the Golgi-derived vesicle trafficking and actin filament organization. Moreover, the multinucleated and undifferentiated spermatogenic cells in the epidydimal lumen after KIFC1 inhibition reveal the specific roles of KIFC1 in regulating post-meiotic maturation. Overall, our results uncover KIFC1 as an essential regulator in the trafficking, fusion and maturation of acrosomal vesicles during spermiogenesis.

Abstract: In this work, the influence of highly doped layers on the hydrogen in-diffusion into silicon from hydrogen-rich silicon nitride is investigated. Hydrogen in the crystalline silicon bulk of wafers with and without highly doped layers present was examined in solar cell-like structures by resistivity measurements for quantification of BH-pair dynamics. Hydrogen diffusion through phosphorus- and boron-doped Float-Zone samples without highly doped layers and with p+- respectively n+-layers was determined via secondary ion mass spectrometry. Therefore, deuterium concentration in an amorphous silicon layer on the backside was measured. This experiment shows an up to threefold increase of deuterium concentration in the amorphous layer for samples with highly doped layers present. A possible explanation of this observation is given by simulations.

Abstract: Smart windows with controllable visible and near-infrared (NIR) light transmittance are highly desirable for energy-saving buildings. Herein, we propose a hybrid polymer dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) film for smart window applications, which combines dopants of polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) and cesium tungsten bronze (CsxWO3). The low surface free energy of POSS and NIR absorption of CsxWO3 endow the film with enhanced electro-optical performance (ultra-low driving voltages, high contrast ratio and low optical haze value) and maneuverable light modulation in visible and NIR range. A model house equipped with the proposed film as smart windows reveals its outstanding light shielding and temperature regulating abilities that the indoor temperature rises less than 5oC after irradiation for 10min under the experimental conditions. The research provides new opportunities for further development of energy-efficient smart windows, especially for cooling energy saving in buildings.

Abstract: High-quality multicrystalline Upgraded Metallurgical Grade Silicon (UMG-Si) offers significant advantages over conventional polysilicon-based PV technology, associated to lower energy budget. The aim of this study is twofold: on the one hand, to ascertain the efficiency potential of solar cells based on this material in terms of carrier lifetime; and on the other hand, to explore the adoption of high-efficiency cell architectures by establishing an effective rear-side passivation scheme for the implementation of passivated emitter rear contact (PERC) devices. The carrier lifetime and the surface passivation efficacy are investigated for different passivating layer configurations after single and double P-diffusion gettering processes. Layer stacks consisting of Al2O3, SiOxNy and a-SiNx:H capping overlayers have been optimized, on industrial size, saw-damage-etched UMG wafers and results compared to those obtained using reference iodine-ethanol (IE) passivation. Diagnosis based on minority carrier lifetime and implied Voc (iVoc) measurements helped monitor the impact of parameter optimization on wafer quality, particularly after firing processes. Carrier lifetimes over 600 μs at Δn = 1015 cm−3 injection level as well as up to 790 μs locally have been measured in UMG-Si wafers passivated with IE after a Phosphorus Diffusion Gettering (PDG), demonstrating the suitability of the material for high-efficiency cell architectures. Values higher than 300 μs have been obtained with Al2O3-based passivation layers for gettered UMG wafers, with implied Voc values up to 710 mV. These record-breaking lifetimes and iVoc figures obtained with p-type multicrystalline UMG-Si material demonstrate a significant upgrading of its electronic quality by means of industry-scalable technical processes.

Abstract: Bone repair remains a clinical challenge due to low osteogenic capacity. Coactivator associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) is a protein arginine methyltransferase that mediates arginine methylation and endochondral ossification. However, the roles of CARM1 in osteoblastic differentiation and bone remodeling have not been explored. In our study, heterozygous CARM1-knockout (KO) mice were generated using the CRISPR-Cas9 system and a model of femoral defect was created. At day 7 postsurgery, CARM1-KO mice exhibited obvious bone loss compared with wild type (WT) mice, as evidenced by reduced bone mineral density (BMD), bone volume/total volume (BV/TV), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), and trabecular number (Tb.N), and increased trabecular separation (Tb.Sp). Deletion of CARM1 in mice lowered synthesis and accumulation of collagen at the injury sites. The alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and osteogenic-related gene expression were declined in CARM1-KO mice. To further understand the role of CARM1 in osteoblastic differentiation, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were isolated from the tibia and femur of WT or CARM1-KO mice. CARM1 deletion decreased histone arginine methylation and inhibited osteoblastic differentiation and mineralization. The mRNA sequencing of CARM1-KO BMSCs revealed the possible regulatory molecules by CARM1, which could deepen our understanding of CARM1 regulatory mechanisms. These data could be of interest to basic researchers and provide the direction for future research into bone-related disorders.

Abstract: Radiative cooling promises an effective strategy against global warming by sending waste heat to the deep universe in a passive manner. However, the mismatch between cooling supply and demand can significantly compromise the efficacy of spectrally-static radiative cooling devices in cold weather. Therefore, the present work introduced paraffin wax as the phase change material (PCM) to develop a spectrally self-switchable cover (SSC) for flexible radiative cooling. The transmittance of the paraffin wax at different temperatures, thicknesses and phases was characterized. In the UV-VIS-NIR band, the transmittance of the paraffin wax was over 90% in the liquid phase but below 5% in the solid phase. In the “atmospheric window” band, the transmission of the paraffin wax in the liquid phase was also much higher than that in the solid phase with a maximum difference of 41.1%. The optical constants of various paraffin waxes in solid and liquid phases were calculated according to the two-thickness inversion method. The average error of transmittance between the calculated and measured values was only 1.8% and 4% for the 0.19–1.1 μm and 8–13 μm bands, respectively. Moreover, the microstructure analysis of the solid-state paraffin wax revealed that the size of paraffin grains was around 10 μm with interlocking and irregular grain boundaries. The integrated multilayered-like structure resulted in a significant transmittance reduction of the solid-state paraffin wax. In the end, self-switchable PE-PCM-PE (polyethylene-phase change material-polyethylene) covers were prepared and spectrally characterized. The paraffin-based cover provided a new and low-cost candidate solution for achieving dynamic radiative cooling.
