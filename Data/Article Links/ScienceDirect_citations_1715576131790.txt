Abstract: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been identified as vital regulators in cardiovascular diseases, including acute myocardial infarction (AMI). In this study, the function and mechanism of circRNA heparan sulfate proteoglycan 2 (circHSPG2) in hypoxia-induced injury in AC16 cardiomyocytes were investigated. AC16 cells were stimulated with hypoxia to establish an AMI cell model in vitro. Real-time quantitative PCR and western blot assays were performed to quantify the expression levels of circHSPG2, microRNA-1184 (miR-1184), and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 2 (MAP3K2). Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to measure cell viability. Flow cytometry was performed to detect cell cycle and apoptosis. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to determine the expression of inflammatory factors. Dual-luciferase reporter, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), and RNA pull-down assays were used to analyze the relationship between miR-1184 and circHSPG2 or MAP3K2. In AMI serum, circHSPG2 and MAP3K2 mRNA were highly expressed and miR-1184 was down-regulated. Hypoxia treatment elevated HIF1α expression and repressed cell growth and glycolysis. Moreover, hypoxia promoted cell apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress in AC16 cells. Hypoxia-induced circHSPG2 expression in AC16 cells. CircHSPG2 knockdown alleviated hypoxia-induced AC16 cell injury. CircHSPG2 directly targeted miR-1184, and miR-1184 targeted and suppressed MAP3K2. Inhibition of miR-1184 or overexpression of MAP3K2 abolished the alleviated effect of circHSPG2 knockdown on hypoxia-induced AC16 cell injury. Overexpression of miR-1184 relieved hypoxia-induced impairment in AC16 cells by MAP3K2. CircHSPG2 could regulate MAP3K2 expression through miR-1184. CircHSPG2 knockdown protected AC16 cells from hypoxia-induced injury by regulating the miR-1184/MAP3K2 cascade.

Abstract: Summary
More than half of patients with malignant mesothelioma show alterations in the BAP1 tumor-suppressor gene. Being a member of the Polycomb repressive deubiquitinating (PR-DUB) complex, BAP1 loss results in an altered epigenome, which may create new vulnerabilities that remain largely unknown. Here, we performed a CRISPR-Cas9 kinome screen in mesothelioma cells that identified two kinases in the mevalonate/cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Furthermore, our analysis of chromatin, expression, and genetic perturbation data in mesothelioma cells suggests a dependency on PR complex 2 (PRC2)-mediated silencing. Pharmacological inhibition of PRC2 elevates the expression of cholesterol biosynthesis genes only in BAP1-deficient mesothelioma, thereby sensitizing these cells to the combined targeting of PRC2 and the mevalonate pathway. Finally, by subjecting autochthonous Bap1-deficient mesothelioma mice or xenografts to mevalonate pathway inhibition (zoledronic acid) and PRC2 inhibition (tazemetostat), we demonstrate a potent anti-tumor effect, suggesting a targeted combination therapy for Bap1-deficient mesothelioma.

Abstract: SAMD9 and SAMD9L encode homologous interferon-induced genes that can inhibit cellular translation as well as proliferation and can restrict viral replication. Gain-of-function (GoF) variants in these ancient, yet rapidly evolving genes are associated with life-threatening disease in humans. Potentially driving population sequence diversity, several viruses have evolved host range factors that antagonize cell-intrinsic SAMD9/SAMD9L function. Here, to gain insights into the molecular regulation of SAMD9/SAMD9L activity and to explore the prospect of directly counteracting the activity of pathogenic variants, we examined whether dysregulated activity of pathogenic SAMD9/SAMD9L variants can be modulated by the poxviral host range factors M062, C7 and K1 in a co-expression system. We established that the virally encoded proteins retain interactions with select SAMD9/SAMD9L missense GoF variants. Furthermore, expression of M062, C7 and K1 could principally ameliorate the translation-inhibiting and growth-restrictive effect instigated by ectopically expressed SAMD9/SAMD9L GoF variants, yet with differences in potency. K1 displayed the greatest potency and almost completely restored cellular proliferation and translation in cells co-expressing SAMD9/SAMD9L GoF variants. However, neither of the viral proteins tested could antagonize a truncated SAMD9L variant associated with severe autoinflammation. Our study demonstrates that pathogenic SAMD9/SAMD9L missense variants can principally be targeted through molecular interactions, opening an opportunity for therapeutic modulation of their activity. Moreover, it provides novel insights into the complex intramolecular regulation of SAMD9/SAMD9L activity.

Abstract: Summary
Quantifying animal behavior is important for biological research. Identifying behaviors is the prerequisite of quantifying them. Current computational tools for behavioral quantification typically use high-level properties such as body poses to identify the behaviors, which constrains the information available for a holistic assessment. Here we report LabGym, an open-source computational tool for quantifying animal behaviors without this constraint. In LabGym, we introduce “pattern image” to represent the animal’s motion pattern, in addition to “animation” that shows all spatiotemporal details of a behavior. These two pieces of information are assessed holistically by customizable deep neural networks for accurate behavior identifications. The quantitative measurements of each behavior are then calculated. LabGym is applicable for experiments involving multiple animals, requires little programming knowledge to use, and provides visualizations of behavioral datasets. We demonstrate its efficacy in capturing subtle behavioral changes in diverse animal species.

Abstract: Summary
Immune checkpoint therapy (ICT) has the power to eradicate cancer, but the mechanisms that determine effective therapy-induced immune responses are not fully understood. Here, using high-dimensional single-cell profiling, we interrogate whether the landscape of T cell states in the peripheral blood predict responses to combinatorial targeting of the OX40 costimulatory and PD-1 inhibitory pathways. Single-cell RNA sequencing and mass cytometry expose systemic and dynamic activation states of therapy-responsive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in tumor-bearing mice with expression of distinct natural killer (NK) cell receptors, granzymes, and chemokines/chemokine receptors. Moreover, similar NK cell receptor-expressing CD8+ T cells are also detected in the blood of immunotherapy-responsive cancer patients. Targeting the NK cell and chemokine receptors in tumor-bearing mice shows the functional importance of these receptors for therapy-induced anti-tumor immunity. These findings provide a better understanding of ICT and highlight the use and targeting of dynamic biomarkers on T cells to improve cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (pAML) is typified by high relapse rates and a relative paucity of somatic DNA mutations. Although seminal studies show that splicing factor mutations and mis-splicing fuel therapy-resistant leukemia stem cell (LSC) generation in adults, splicing deregulation has not been extensively studied in pAML. Herein, we describe single-cell proteogenomics analyses, transcriptome-wide analyses of FACS-purified hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells followed by differential splicing analyses, dual-fluorescence lentiviral splicing reporter assays, and the potential of a selective splicing modulator, Rebecsinib, in pAML. Using these methods, we discover transcriptomic splicing deregulation typified by differential exon usage. In addition, we discover downregulation of splicing regulator RBFOX2 and CD47 splice isoform upregulation. Importantly, splicing deregulation in pAML induces a therapeutic vulnerability to Rebecsinib in survival, self-renewal, and lentiviral splicing reporter assays. Taken together, the detection and targeting of splicing deregulation represent a potentially clinically tractable strategy for pAML therapy.

Abstract: Stem cell therapy has been increasingly investigated as a promising strategy for intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD). However, no international analysis of stem cell research has yet been conducted. This study aimed to analyze the major characteristics of published reports of stem cell use for IDD and to present a global insight into stem cell research. The study period spanned from the inception of the Web of Science database to 2021. A search strategy using specific keywords was implemented to retrieve relevant publications. The numbers of documents, citations, countries, journals, article types, and stem cell types were evaluated. A total of 1170 papers were retrieved. The analysis showed a significant increase in the number of papers over time (p < 0.001). High-income economies accounted for the majority of papers (758, 64.79 %). China produced the most articles (378, 32.31 %), followed by the United States (259, 22.14 %), Switzerland (69, 5.90 %), United Kingdom (54, 4.62 %), and Japan (47, 4.02 %). The United States ranked first in terms of the number of citations (10,346), followed by China (9177) and Japan (3522). Japan ranked first in terms of the number of citations per paper (74.94), followed by United Kingdom (58.54) and Canada (53.74). When standardized by population, Switzerland ranked first, followed by Ireland and Sweden. When gross domestic product was considered, Switzerland ranked first, followed by Portugal and Ireland. The number of papers was positively correlated with gross domestic product (p < 0.001, r = 0.673); however, there was no significant correlation with population (p = 0.062, r = 0.294). Mesenchymal stem cells were the most investigated stem cells, followed by nucleus pulposus-derived stem cells and adipose-derived stem cells. A sharp increase in stem cell research was observed in the field of IDD. China produced the most, although several European countries were more productive relative to their populations and economies.

Abstract: Summary
Characterizing cell identity in complex tissues such as the human retina is essential for studying its development and disease. While retinal organoids derived from pluripotent stem cells have been widely used to model development and disease of the human retina, there is a lack of studies that have systematically evaluated the molecular and cellular fidelity of the organoids derived from various culture protocols in recapitulating their in vivo counterpart. To this end, we performed an extensive meta-atlas characterization of cellular identities of the human eye, covering a wide range of developmental stages. The resulting map uncovered previously unknown biomarkers of major retinal cell types and those associated with cell-type-specific maturation. Using our retinal-cell-identity map from the fetal and adult tissues, we systematically assessed the fidelity of the retinal organoids in mimicking the human eye, enabling us to comprehensively benchmark the current protocols for retinal organoid generation.

Abstract: Summary
With the widespread vaccinations against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we are witnessing gradually waning neutralizing antibodies and increasing cases of breakthrough infections, necessitating the development of drugs aside from vaccines, particularly ones that can be administered outside of hospitals. Here, we present two cross-reactive nanobodies (R14 and S43) and their multivalent derivatives, including decameric ones (fused to the immunoglobulin M [IgM] Fc) that maintain potent neutralizing activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) after aerosolization and display not only pan-SARS-CoV-2 but also varied pan-sarbecovirus activities. Through respiratory administration to mice, monovalent and decameric R14 significantly reduce the lung viral RNAs at low dose and display potent pre- and post-exposure protection. Furthermore, structural studies reveal the neutralizing mechanisms of R14 and S43 and the multiple inhibition effects that the multivalent derivatives exert. Our work demonstrates promising convenient drug candidates via respiratory administration against SARS-CoV-2 infection, which can contribute to containing the COVID-19 pandemic.

Abstract: Summary
Pulmonary fibrosis is a typical sequela of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is linked with a poor prognosis for COVID-19 patients. However, the underlying mechanism of pulmonary fibrosis induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is unclear. Here, we demonstrated that the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 induced pulmonary fibrosis by activating pulmonary fibroblasts. N protein interacted with the transforming growth factor β receptor I (TβRI), to disrupt the interaction of TβRI-FK506 Binding Protein12 (FKBP12), which led to activation of TβRI to phosphorylate Smad3 and boost expression of pro-fibrotic genes and secretion of cytokines to promote pulmonary fibrosis. Furthermore, we identified a compound, RMY-205, that bound to Smad3 to disrupt TβRI-induced Smad3 activation. The therapeutic potential of RMY-205 was strengthened in mouse models of N protein-induced pulmonary fibrosis. This study highlights a signaling pathway of pulmonary fibrosis induced by N protein and demonstrates a novel therapeutic strategy for treating pulmonary fibrosis by a compound targeting Smad3.

Aspergillus fumigatus hijacks human p11 to redirect fungal-containing phagosomes to non-degradative pathway,

Abstract: Summary
The decision whether endosomes enter the degradative or recycling pathway in mammalian cells is of fundamental importance for pathogen killing, and its malfunctioning has pathological consequences. We discovered that human p11 is a critical factor for this decision. The HscA protein present on the conidial surface of the human-pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus anchors p11 on conidia-containing phagosomes (PSs), excludes the PS maturation mediator Rab7, and triggers binding of exocytosis mediators Rab11 and Sec15. This reprogramming redirects PSs to the non-degradative pathway, allowing A. fumigatus to escape cells by outgrowth and expulsion as well as transfer of conidia between cells. The clinical relevance is supported by the identification of a single nucleotide polymorphism in the non-coding region of the S100A10 (p11) gene that affects mRNA and protein expression in response to A. fumigatus and is associated with protection against invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. These findings reveal the role of p11 in mediating fungal PS evasion.

Abstract: Summary
The human gut virome and its early life development are poorly understood. Prior studies have captured single-point assessments with the evolution of the infant virome remaining largely unexplored. We performed viral metagenomic sequencing on stool samples collected longitudinally from a cohort of 53 infants from age 2 weeks to 3 years (80.7 billion reads), and from their mothers (9.8 billion reads) to examine and compare viromes. The asymptomatic infant virome consisted of bacteriophages, nonhuman dietary/environmental viruses, and human-host viruses, predominantly picornaviruses. In contrast, human-host viruses were largely absent from the maternal virome. Previously undescribed, sequence-divergent vertebrate viruses were detected in the maternal but not infant virome. As infants aged, the phage component evolved to resemble the maternal virome, but by age 3, the human-host component remained dissimilar from the maternal virome. Thus, early life virome development is determined predominantly by dietary, infectious, and environmental factors rather than direct maternal acquisition.

Abstract: Summary
The patch-clamp technique is the gold-standard methodology for analysis of excitable cells. However, throughput of manual patch-clamp is slow, and high-throughput robotic patch-clamp, while helpful for applications like drug screening, has been primarily used to study channels and receptors expressed in heterologous systems. We introduce an approach for automated high-throughput patch-clamping that enhances analysis of excitable cells at the channel and cellular levels. This involves dissociating and isolating neurons from intact tissues and patch-clamping using a robotic instrument, followed by using an open-source Python script for analysis and filtration. As a proof of concept, we apply this approach to investigate the biophysical properties of voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, which are among the most diverse and complex neuronal cells. Our approach enables voltage- and current-clamp recordings in the same cell, allowing unbiased, fast, simultaneous, and head-to-head electrophysiological recordings from a wide range of freshly isolated neurons without requiring culturing on coverslips.

Abstract: Summary
Approaches to investigate adult oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) by targeted cell ablation in the rodent CNS have limitations in the extent and duration of OPC depletion. We have developed a pharmacogenetic approach for conditional OPC ablation, eliminating >98% of OPCs throughout the brain. By combining recombinase-based transgenic and viral strategies for targeting OPCs and ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ)-derived neural precursor cells (NPCs), we found that new PDGFRA-expressing cells born in the V-SVZ repopulated the OPC-deficient brain starting 12 days after OPC ablation. Our data reveal that OPC depletion induces V-SVZ-derived NPCs to generate vast numbers of PDGFRA+NG2+ cells with the capacity to proliferate and migrate extensively throughout the dorsal anterior forebrain. Further application of this approach to ablate OPCs will advance knowledge of the function of both OPCs and oligodendrogenic NPCs in health and disease.

Abstract: Summary
Brain metastases (BrMs) are the most common form of brain tumors in adults and frequently originate from lung and breast primary cancers. BrMs are associated with high mortality, emphasizing the need for more effective therapies. Genetic profiling of primary tumors is increasingly used as part of the effort to guide targeted therapies against BrMs, and immune-based strategies for the treatment of metastatic cancer are gaining momentum. However, the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) of BrM is extremely heterogeneous, and whether specific genetic profiles are associated with distinct immune states remains unknown. Here, we perform an extensive characterization of the immunogenomic landscape of human BrMs by combining whole-exome/whole-genome sequencing, RNA sequencing of immune cell populations, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence staining, and tissue imaging analyses. This revealed unique TIME phenotypes in genetically distinct lung- and breast-BrMs, thereby enabling the development of personalized immunotherapies tailored by the genetic makeup of the tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Malignant mesothelioma is an aggressive cancer with limited treatment options and poor prognosis. A better understanding of mesothelioma genomics and transcriptomics could advance therapies. Here, we present a mesothelioma cohort of 122 patients along with their germline and tumor whole-exome and tumor RNA sequencing data as well as phenotypic and drug response information. We identify a 48-gene prognostic signature that is highly predictive of mesothelioma patient survival, including CCNB1, the expression of which is highly predictive of patient survival on its own. In addition, we analyze the transcriptomics data to study the tumor immune microenvironment and identify synthetic-lethality-based signatures predictive of response to therapy. This germline and somatic whole-exome sequencing as well as transcriptomics data from the same patient are a valuable resource to address important biological questions, including prognostic biomarkers and determinants of treatment response in mesothelioma.

Abstract: Summary
Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in a disruption of information between the brain and the spinal circuit. Electrical stimulation of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) can promote locomotor recovery in acute and chronic SCI rodent models. Although clinical trials are currently under way, there is still debate about the organization of this supraspinal center and which anatomic correlate of the MLR should be targeted to promote recovery. Combining kinematics, electromyographic recordings, anatomic analysis, and mouse genetics, our study reveals that glutamatergic neurons of the cuneiform nucleus contribute to locomotor recovery by enhancing motor efficacy in hindlimb muscles, and by increasing locomotor rhythm and speed on a treadmill, over ground, and during swimming in chronic SCI mice. In contrast, glutamatergic neurons of the pedunculopontine nucleus slow down locomotion. Therefore, our study identifies the cuneiform nucleus and its glutamatergic neurons as a therapeutical target to improve locomotor recovery in patients living with SCI.

Abstract: Summary
Signal transduction induced by chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) is generally believed to rely on the activity of the SRC family kinase (SFK) LCK, as is the case with T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. Here, we show that CAR signaling occurs in the absence of LCK. This LCK-independent signaling requires the related SFK FYN and a CD28 intracellular domain within the CAR. LCK-deficient CAR-T cells are strongly signaled through CAR and have better in vivo efficacy with reduced exhaustion phenotype and enhanced induction of memory and proliferation. These distinctions can be attributed to the fact that FYN signaling tends to promote proliferation and survival, whereas LCK signaling promotes strong signaling that tends to lead to exhaustion. This non-canonical signaling of CAR-T cells provides insight into the initiation of both TCR and CAR signaling and has important clinical implications for improvement of CAR function.

Abstract: Summary
Pituitary neuroendocrine tumor (PitNET) is one of the most common intracranial tumors with variable recurrence rate. Currently, the recurrence prediction is unsatisfying and can be improved by understanding the cellular origins and differentiation status. Here, to comprehensively reveal the origin of PitNET, we perform comparative analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data from 3 anterior pituitary glands and 21 PitNETs. We identify distinct genes representing major subtypes of well and poorly differentiated PitNETs in each lineage. To further verify the predictive value of differentiation biomarkers, we include an independent cohort of 800 patients with an average follow-up of 7.2 years. In both PIT1 and TPIT lineages, poorly differentiated groups show significantly higher recurrence rates while well-differentiated groups show higher recurrence rates in SF1 lineage. Our findings reveal the possible origin and differentiation status of PitNET based on which new differentiation classification is proposed and verified to predict tumor recurrence.

Abstract: Summary
Targeted degradation of proteins by chimeric heterobifunctional degraders has emerged as a major drug discovery paradigm. Despite the increased interest in this approach, the criteria dictating target protein degradation by a degrader remain poorly understood, and potent target engagement by a degrader does not strongly correlate with target degradation. In this study, we present the biochemical characterization of an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) degrader that potently binds both wild-type and mutant EGFR, but only degrades EGFR mutant variants. Mechanistic studies reveal that ternary complex half-life strongly correlates with processive ubiquitination with purified components and mutant-selective degradation in cells. We present cryoelectron microscopy and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectroscopy data on wild-type and mutant EGFR ternary complexes, which demonstrate that potent target degradation can be achieved in the absence of stable compound-induced protein-protein interactions. These results highlight the importance of considering target conformation during degrader development as well as leveraging heterobifunctional ligand binding kinetics to achieve robust target degradation.

Abstract: Summary
Malignant tumors can evade destruction by the immune system by attracting immune-suppressive regulatory T cells (Treg) cells. The IKZF2 (Helios) transcription factor plays a crucial role in maintaining function and stability of Treg cells, and IKZF2 deficiency reduces tumor growth in mice. Here we report the discovery of NVP-DKY709, a selective molecular glue degrader of IKZF2 that spares IKZF1/3. We describe the recruitment-guided medicinal chemistry campaign leading to NVP-DKY709 that redirected the degradation selectivity of cereblon (CRBN) binders from IKZF1 toward IKZF2. Selectivity of NVP-DKY709 for IKZF2 was rationalized by analyzing the DDB1:CRBN:NVP-DKY709:IKZF2(ZF2 or ZF2-3) ternary complex X-ray structures. Exposure to NVP-DKY709 reduced the suppressive activity of human Treg cells and rescued cytokine production in exhausted T-effector cells. In vivo, treatment with NVP-DKY709 delayed tumor growth in mice with a humanized immune system and enhanced immunization responses in cynomolgus monkeys. NVP-DKY709 is being investigated in the clinic as an immune-enhancing agent for cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutation is the hallmark of colorectal cancer (CRC), resulting in constitutive WNT activation. Despite decades of research, targeting WNT signaling in cancer remains challenging due to its on-target toxicity. We have previously shown that the deubiquitinating enzyme USP7 is a tumor-specific WNT activator in APC-truncated cells by deubiquitinating and stabilizing β-catenin, but its role in gut tumorigenesis is unknown. Here, we show in vivo that deletion of Usp7 in Apc-truncated mice inhibits crypt hyperproliferation and intestinal tumor development. Loss of Usp7 prolongs the survival of the sporadic intestinal tumor model. Genetic deletion, but not pharmacological inhibition, of Usp7 in Apc+/− intestine induces colitis and enteritis. USP7 inhibitor treatment suppresses growth of patient-derived cancer organoids carrying APC truncations in vitro and in xenografts. Our findings provide direct evidence that USP7 inhibition may offer a safe and efficacious tumor-specific therapy for both sporadic and germline APC-mutated CRC.

Abstract: Astrocytes are highly energy-consuming glial cells critical for metabolic support to neurons. A growing body of evidence suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction in astrocytes is involved in age-related neurodegenerative disorders and that fish oil, rich in docosahexaenoic (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic (EPA) fatty acids, may alleviate cognition impairment in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. The present study examines the effect of DHA and EPA on mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), apoptosis activation and ATP levels in astrocytes cultured in medium containing glucose or galactose, which limits oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). MMP, expressed as the ratio of red to green JC-10 and MitoTracker fluorescence, increased in EPA-incubated cells in a dose dependent manner and was higher than in DHA-incubated astrocytes, also after uncoupling of OXPHOS by carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). In cells cultured in glucose and galactose medium mitochondrial hyperpolarization had no impact on intracellular ATP level. Furthermore, both EPA and DHA elevated mitochondrial cardiolipin content, however only EPA did so in a dose-dependent manner and reduced apoptosis which was analyzed by flow cytometry.

Abstract: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are pivotal regulators in heart disease, including myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. LncRNA just proximal to XIST (JPX) is a molecular switch for X-chromosome inactivation. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is a core catalytic subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which is involved in chromatin compaction and gene repression. This study aims to explore the mechanism of JPX regulating the expression of Sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase 2a (SERCA2a) by binding to EZH2 and preventing cardiomyocyte I/R damage in vivo and in vitro. First, we constructed mouse myocardial I/R and HL1 cell hypoxia/reoxygenation models, and found that JPX was low expressed in both models. JPX overexpression alleviated cardiomyocyte apoptosis in vivo and in vitro, reduced the I/R-induced infarct size in mouse hearts, lowered the serum cTnI concentration, and promoted mouse cardiac systolic function. The evidence implies that JPX can alleviate I/R-induced acute cardiac damage. Mechanistically, the FISH and RIP assays showed that JPX could bind to EZH2. The ChIP assay revealed EZH2 enrichment at the promoter region of SERCA2a. Both the EZH2 and H3K27me3 levels at the promoter region of SERCA2a were reduced in the JPX overexpression group compared to those in the Ad-EGFP group (P < 0.01). In summary, our results suggested that LncRNA JPX directly bound to EZH2 and reduced the EZH2-mediated H3K27me3 in the SERCA2a promoter region, protecting the heart from acute myocardial I/R injury. Therefore, JPX might be a potential therapeutic target for I/R injury.

Abstract: Summary
DNA-point accumulation for imaging at nanoscale topography (DNA-PAINT) can image fixed biological specimens with nanometer resolution and absolute stoichiometry. In living systems, however, the usage of DNA-PAINT has been limited due to high salt concentration in the buffer required for specific binding of the imager to the docker attached to the target. Here, we used multiple binding motifs of the docker, from 2 to 16, to accelerate the binding speed of the imager under physiological buffer conditions without compromising spatial resolution and maintaining the basal level homeostasis during the measurement. We imaged endogenous α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) in cultured neurons—critical proteins involved in nerve communication—by DNA-PAINT in 3-dimensions using a monovalent single-chain variable fragment (scFv) to the GluA1 subunit of AMPAR. We found a heterogeneous distribution of synaptic AMPARs: ≈60% are immobile, primarily in nanodomains, defined as AMPARs that are within 0.3 μm of the Homer1 protein in the postsynaptic density; the other ∼40% of AMPARs have restricted mobility and trajectory.

Abstract: Most lung adenocarcinoma-associated EGFR tyrosine kinase mutations are either an exon 19 deletion (19Del) or L858R point mutation in exon 21. Although patients whose tumors contain either of these mutations exhibit increased sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, progression-free and overall survival appear to be longer in patients with 19Del than in those with L858R. In mutant-transfected Ba/F3 cells, 19Del and L858R were compared by multi-omics analyses including proteomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics. Proteome analysis identified increased plastin-2, TKT, PDIA5, and ENO1 expression in L858R cells, and increased EEF1G expression in 19Del cells. RNA sequencing showed significant differences between 19Del and L858R cells in 112 genes. Metabolome analysis showed that amino acids, adenylate, guanylate, NADPH, lactic acid, pyruvic acid glucose 6-phosphate, and ribose 5-phosphate were significantly different between the two mutant cells. Because GSH was increased with L858R, we combined osimertinib with the GSH inhibitor buthionine sulfoximine in L858R cells and observed synergistic effects. The complexity of EGFR 19Del and L858R mutant cells was demonstrated by proteomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics analyses. Therapeutic strategies for lung cancer with different EGFR mutations could be considered because of their different metabolic phenotypes.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we introduce a single-copy knockin translating ribosome immunoprecipitation (SKI TRIP) toolkit, a collection of Caenorhabditis elegans strains engineered by CRISPR in which tissue-specific expression of FLAG-tagged ribosomal subunit protein RPL-22 is driven by cassettes present in single copy from defined sites in the genome. Through in-depth characterization of the effects of the FLAG tag in animals in which endogenous RPL-22 has been tagged, we show that it incorporates into actively translating ribosomes and efficiently and cleanly pulls down cell-type-specific transcripts. Importantly, the presence of the tag does not impact overall mRNA translation, create bias in transcript use, or cause changes to fitness of the animal. We propose SKI TRIP use for the study of tissue-specific differences in translation and for investigating processes that are acutely sensitive to changes in translation like development or aging.

Abstract: In the gonads of mammalian XY embryos, the organization of cords is the hallmark of testis development. This organization is thought to be controlled by interactions of the Sertoli cells, endothelial and interstitial cells with little or no role of germ cells. Challenging this notion, herein we show that the germ cells play an active role in the organization of the testicular tubules. We observed that the LIM-homeobox gene, Lhx2 is expressed in the germ cells of the developing testis between E12.5-E15.5. In Lhx2 knockout-fetal testis there was altered expression of several genes not just in germ cells but also in the supporting (Sertoli) cells, endothelial cells, and interstitial cells. Further, loss of Lhx2 led to disrupted endothelial cell migration and expansion of interstitial cells in the XY gonads. The cords in the developing testis of Lhx2 knockout embryos are disorganized with a disrupted basement membrane. Together, our results show an important role of Lhx2 in testicular development and imply the involvement of germ cells in the tubular organization of the differentiating testis.

Abstract: N6-methyladenosine RNA (m6A) is the most extensive epigenetic modification in mRNA and influences tumor progression. However, the role of m6A regulators and specific mechanisms in breast cancer still need further study. Here, we investigated the significance of the m6A reader HNRNPA2B1 and explored its influence on autophagy and drug sensitivity in breast cancer. HNRNPA2B1 was selected by bioinformatics analysis, and its high expression level was identified in breast cancer tissues and cell lines. HNRNPA2B1 was related to poor prognosis. Downregulation of HNRNPA2B1 reduced proliferation, enhanced autophagic flux, and partially reversed de novo resistance to olaparib in breast cancer. ATG4B was determined by RIP and MeRIP assays as a downstream gene of HNRNPA2B1, by which recognized the m6A site in the 3′UTR. Overexpression of ATG4B rescued the malignancy driven by HNRNPA2B1 in breast cancer cells and increased the olaparib sensitivity. Our study revealed that the m6A reader HNRNPA2B1 mediated proliferation and autophagy in breast cancer cell lines by facilitating ATG4B mRNA decay and targeting HNRNPA2B1/m6A/ATG4B might enhance the olaparib sensitivity of breast cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
Dysregulated maternal fatty acid metabolism increases the risk of congenital heart disease (CHD) in offspring with an unknown mechanism, and the effect of folic acid fortification in preventing CHD is controversial. Using gas chromatography coupled to either a flame ionization detector or mass spectrometer (GC-FID/MS) analysis, we find that the palmitic acid (PA) concentration increases significantly in serum samples of pregnant women bearing children with CHD. Feeding pregnant mice with PA increased CHD risk in offspring and cannot be rescued by folic acid supplementation. We further find that PA promotes methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MARS) expression and protein lysine homocysteinylation (K-Hcy) of GATA4 and results in GATA4 inhibition and abnormal heart development. Targeting K-Hcy modification by either genetic ablation of Mars or using N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) decreases CHD onset in high-PA-diet-fed mice. In summary, our work links maternal malnutrition and MARS/K-Hcy with the onset of CHD and provides a potential strategy in preventing CHD by targeting K-Hcy other than folic acid supplementation.

Abstract: Protein homeostasis involves a number of overlapping mechanisms, including the autophagy program, that can lead to the resolution of protein damage. We aimed in this study to examine mechanisms of autophagy in the proteotoxic stress response. We found that such stress results in a rapid elevation in the rate of autophagy in mammalian cells. Induction of this process occurred coincidentally with the increased release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) into the extracellular microenvironment. We next found that purified EVs that had been released from stressed cells were capable of directly increasing autophagic flux in recipient cells. The EVs contained a range of cargo proteins, including HSP70, BAG3, and activated transcription factor phospho-NRF2 (pNRF2). NRF2 regulates the activation of both the oxidative stress response and autophagy genes. Both heat shock and exposure of cells to proteotoxic stress-induced EVs increased the intracellular levels of pNRF2 in cells. Heat shock-induced proteotoxicity also led to increases in the levels of proteins in the oxidative stress response, including HO-1 and NQO1, as well as the key autophagy proteins LC3, ATG5, and ATG7, known to be regulated by NRF2. Increases in these autophagy proteins were dependent on the expression of NRF2 and were ablated by NRF2 knockdown.

Abstract: Breast cancer has become the highest incidence of cancer in women. It was extensively and deeply studied by biologists and medical workers worldwide. However, the meaningful results in lab researches cannot be realized in clinical, and a part of new drugs in clinical experiments do not obtain as good results as the preclinical researches. It is urgently that promote a kind of breast cancer research models that can get study results closer to the physiological condition of the human body. Patient-derived models (PDMs) originating from clinical tumor, contain primary elements of tumor and maintain key clinical features of tumor. So they are promising research models to facilitate laboratory researches translate to clinical application, and predict the treatment outcome of patients. In this review, we summarize the establishment of PDMs of breast cancer, reviewed the application of PDMs in clinical translational researches and personalized precision medicine with breast cancer as an example, to improve the understanding of PDMs among researchers and clinician, facilitate them to use PDMs on a large scale of breast cancer researches and promote the clinical translation of laboratory research and new drug development.

Abstract: Breast cancer (BC) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women. Prognosis has improved over the years, to a large extent, owing to personalized therapy informed by molecular profiling of hormone receptors. However, there is a need for new therapeutic approaches for a subgroup of BCs lacking molecular markers, the Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) subgroup. TNBC is the most aggressive type of BC, lacks an effective standard of care, shows high levels of resistance and relapse is often inevitable. High resistance to therapy has been hypothesized to be associated with high intratumoral phenotypic heterogeneity. To characterize and treat this phenotypic heterogeneity, we optimized a whole-mount staining and image analysis protocol for three-dimensions (3D) spheroids. Applying this protocol to TNBC spheroids located in the outer region of the spheroid the cells with selected phenotypes: dividing, migrating, and high mitochondrial mass phenotypes. To evaluate the relevance of phenotype-based targeting these cell populations were targeted with Paclitaxel, Trametinib, and Everolimus, respectively, in a dose-dependent manner. Single agents cannot specifically target all phenotypes at the same time. Therefore, we combined drugs that should target independent phenotype. With this rationale we observed that combining Trametinib and Everolimus achieves the highest cytotoxicity at lower doses from all the tested combinations. These findings suggest a rational approach to design treatments can be evaluated in spheroids prior to pre-clinical models and potentially reduce adverse effects.

Abstract: Summary
Mouse hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have been extensively defined both molecularly and functionally at steady state, while regenerative stress induces immunophenotypical changes that limit high purity isolation and analysis. It is therefore important to identify markers that specifically label activated HSCs to gain further knowledge about their molecular and functional properties. Here, we assessed the expression of macrophage-1 antigen (MAC-1) on HSCs during regeneration following transplantation and observed a transient increase in MAC-1 expression during the early reconstitution phase. Serial transplantation experiments demonstrated that reconstitution potential was highly enriched in the MAC-1+ portion of the HSC pool. Moreover, in contrast to previous reports, we found that MAC-1 expression inversely correlates with cell cycling, and global transcriptome analysis showed that regenerating MAC-1+ HSCs share molecular features with stem cells with low mitotic history. Taken together, our results suggest that MAC-1 expression marks predominantly quiescent and functionally superior HSCs during early regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
The homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) complex mediates membrane trafficking involved in endocytosis, autophagy, lysosome biogenesis, and phagocytosis. Defects in HOPS subunits are associated with various forms of cancer, but their potential as drug targets has rarely been examined. Here, we identified vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 41 homolog (VPS41), a subunit of the HOPS complex, as a target of methyl 2,4-dihydroxy-3-(3-methyl-2-butenyl)-6-phenethylbenzoate (DMBP), a natural small molecule with preferable anticancer activity. DMBP induced methuosis and inhibited autophagic flux in cancer cells by inhibiting the function of VPS41, leading to the restrained fusion of late endosomes and autophagosomes with lysosomes. Moreover, DMBP effectively inhibited metastasis in a mouse metastatic melanoma model. Collectively, the current work revealed that targeting VPS41 would provide a valuable method of inhibiting cancer proliferation through methuosis.

Abstract: Summary
Monoclonal antibodies can provide important pre- or post-exposure protection against infectious disease for those not yet vaccinated or in individuals that fail to mount a protective immune response after vaccination. Inmazeb (REGN-EB3), a three-antibody cocktail against Ebola virus, lessened disease and improved survival in a controlled trial. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure at 3.1 Å of the Ebola virus glycoprotein, determined without symmetry averaging, in a simultaneous complex with the antibodies in the Inmazeb cocktail. This structure allows the modeling of previously disordered portions of the glycoprotein glycan cap, maps the non-overlapping epitopes of Inmazeb, and illuminates the basis for complementary activities and residues critical for resistance to escape by these and other clinically relevant antibodies. We further provide direct evidence that Inmazeb protects against the rapid emergence of escape mutants, whereas monotherapies even against conserved epitopes do not, supporting the benefit of a cocktail versus a monotherapy approach.

Abstract: Summary
Metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) inevitably acquires resistance to standard therapy preceding lethality. Here, we unveil a chromosomal instability (CIN) tolerance mechanism as a therapeutic vulnerability of therapy-refractory lethal PCa. Through genomic and transcriptomic analysis of patient datasets, we find that castration and chemotherapy-resistant tumors display the highest CIN and mitotic kinase levels. Functional genomics screening coupled with quantitative phosphoproteomics identify MASTL kinase as a survival vulnerability specific of chemotherapy-resistant PCa cells. Mechanistically, MASTL upregulation is driven by transcriptional rewiring mechanisms involving the non-canonical transcription factors androgen receptor splice variant 7 and E2F7 in a circuitry that restrains deleterious CIN and prevents cell death selectively in metastatic therapy-resistant PCa cells. Notably, MASTL pharmacological inhibition re-sensitizes tumors to standard therapy and improves survival of pre-clinical models. These results uncover a targetable mechanism promoting high CIN adaptation and survival of lethal PCa.

Abstract: Summary
Combination therapy is a promising approach in treating multiple complex diseases. However, the large search space of available drug combinations exacerbates challenge for experimental screening. To predict synergistic drug combinations in different cancer cell lines, we propose an improved deep forest-based method, ForSyn, and design two forest types embedded in ForSyn. ForSyn handles imbalanced and high-dimensional data in medium-/small-scale datasets, which are inherent characteristics of drug combination datasets. Compared with 12 state-of-the-art methods, ForSyn ranks first on four metrics for eight datasets with different feature combinations. We conduct a systematic analysis to identify the most appropriate configuration parameters. We validate the predictive value of ForSyn with cell-based experiments on several previously unexplored drug combinations. Finally, a systematic analysis of feature importance is performed on the top contributing features extracted by ForSyn. The resulting key genes may play key roles on corresponding cancers.

Abstract: Summary
This study develops a method combining a convolutional neural network model, INSIGHT, with a self-attention model, WiseMSI, to predict microsatellite instability (MSI) based on the tiles in colorectal cancer patients from a multicenter Chinese cohort. After INSIGHT differentiates tumor tiles from normal tissue tiles in a whole slide image, features of tumor tiles are extracted with a ResNet model pre-trained on ImageNet. Attention-based pooling is adopted to aggregate tile-level features into slide-level representation. INSIGHT has an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.985 for tumor patch classification. The Spearman correlation coefficient of tumor cell fraction given by expert pathologist and INSIGHT is 0.7909. WiseMSI achieves a specificity of 94.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 93.7%–95.7%), a sensitivity of 84.7% (95% CI 82.6%–86.9%), and an AUC of 0.954 (95% CI 0.948–0.960). Comparative analysis shows that this method has better performance than the other five classic deep learning methods.

Abstract: Summary
The microRNA (miRNA) miR-124 has been employed supplementary to neurogenic transcription factors (TFs) and other miRNAs to enhance direct neurogenic conversion. The aim of this study was to investigate whether miR-124 is sufficient to drive direct reprogramming of astrocytes to induced neurons (iNs) on its own and elucidate its independent mechanism of reprogramming action. Our data show that miR-124 is a potent driver of the reprogramming switch of astrocytes toward an immature neuronal fate by directly targeting the RNA-binding protein Zfp36L1 implicated in ARE-mediated mRNA decay and subsequently derepressing Zfp36L1 neurogenic interactome. To this end, miR-124 contribution in iNs’ production largely recapitulates endogenous neurogenesis pathways, being further enhanced upon addition of the neurogenic compound ISX9, which greatly improves iNs’ differentiation and functional maturation. Importantly, miR-124 is potent in guiding direct conversion of reactive astrocytes to immature iNs in vivo following cortical trauma, while ISX9 supplementation confers a survival advantage to newly produced iNs.

Abstract: Summary
PIWI genes are well known for their germline but not somatic functions. Here, we report the function of the Drosophila piwi gene in the adult gut, where intestinal stem cells (ISCs) produce enteroendocrine cells and enteroblasts that generate enterocytes. We show that piwi is expressed in ISCs and enteroblasts. Piwi deficiency reduced ISC number, compromised enteroblasts maintenance, and induced apoptosis in enterocytes, but did not affect ISC proliferation and its differentiation to enteroendocrine cells. In addition, deficiency of zygotic but not maternal piwi mildly de-silenced several retrotransposons in the adult gut. Importantly, either piwi mutations or piwi knockdown specifically in ISCs and enteroblasts shortened the Drosophila lifespan, indicating that intestinal piwi contributes to longevity. Finally, our mRNA sequencing data implied that Piwi may achieve its intestinal function by regulating diverse molecular processes involved in metabolism and oxidation-reduction reaction.

Abstract: Excessive mitochondrial fission in podocytes is a critical feature of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAMs) are contact sites between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, which are suggested to be related to mitochondrial function. However, the role of MAMs in mitochondrial dynamics disorder in podocytes remains unknown. Here, we firstly reported a novel mechanism of MAMs' effects on mitochondrial dynamics in podocytes under diabetic conditions. Increased MAMs were found in diabetic podocytes in vivo and in vitro, which were positively correlated with excessive mitochondrial fission. What's more, we also found that A-kinase anchoring protein 1 (AKAP1) was located in MAMs, and its translocation to MAMs was increased in podocytes cultured with high glucose (HG). In addition, AKAP1 knockdown significantly reduced mitochondrial fission and attenuated high glucose induced-podocyte injury through regulating phosphorylation of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) and its subsequent mitochondrial translocation. On the contrary, AKAP1 overexpression in these podocytes showed the opposite effect. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of Drp1 alleviated excessive mitochondrial fission and podocyte damage in AKAP1 overexpressed podocytes. Our data suggest that MAMs were increased in podocytes under diabetic conditions, leading to excessive mitochondrial fission and podocyte damage through AKAP1-Drp1 signaling.

Abstract: Endometriosis is a chronic gynecologic disorder characterized by abnormal growth of endometrium-like tissues in the ectopic regions of the pelvic peritoneum. The pathophysiology of endometriosis is not completely understood; however, excessive endometrial cell proliferation together with resistance to apoptosis facilitates the migration, implantation, and survival of endometrial cells in the distant sites. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response (also called unfolded protein response) is a cellular defense mechanism triggered by ER stress. When severe enough, the so-called response initiates cell suicide, i.e., apoptosis. Therefore, therapeutic induction of ER stress in endometriotic cells could promote apoptosis and contribute to the management of disease. In this review, we discuss the pathogenic role of ER stress in endometriosis and the most recent findings regarding the induction of ER stress in connection with endometriosis.

Abstract: FET proteins (FUS, EWS, and TAF15) share a common domain organization, bind RNA/DNA, and perform similarly multifunctional roles in the regulation of gene expression. Of the FET proteins, however, only EWS appears to have a distinct property in the cellular stress response. Therefore, we focused on the relationship between hyperosmotic stress response and post-translational modifications of the FET proteins. We confirmed that the hyperosmotic stress-dependent translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and the cellular granule formation of FET proteins, and that EWS is less likely to partition into cellular granules in the cytoplasm than FUS or TAF15. The domain involved in the less partitioning property of EWS was found to be its low-complexity domain (LCD). Chemoenzymatic labeling analysis of O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) residues revealed that O-GlcNAc glycosylation occurs frequently in the LCD of EWS. A correlation was observed between the glycosylation of EWS and the less partitioning property under the hyperosmotic stress. These results suggest that among the FET proteins, only EWS has acquired the unique property through O-GlcNAc glycosylation. The glycosylation may play an essential role in regulating physiological functions of EWS, such as transcriptional activity, in addition to the property in cellular stress response.

Abstract: Regulation of the intestinal barrier is closely associated with intestinal microbial metabolism. This study investigated the role of propionate, a major short-chain fatty acid produced by intestinal microorganisms, in the regulation of the tight junction (TJ) barrier in human intestinal Caco-2 cells. Propionate strengthened TJ barrier integrity, as indicated by decreased permeability to macromolecules and increased transepithelial electrical resistance in Caco-2 cells. DNA microarray analysis revealed that propionate upregulated endothelial cell-selective adhesion molecule (ESAM), a TJ-associated protein, without any increase in other TJ proteins. The upregulation of ESAM was confirmed using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence analyses. Luciferase promoter analysis demonstrated that propionate induced the transcriptional activation of ESAM. The effects of propionate were sensitive to nilotinib inhibition of NR2C2. Overexpression of human ESAM (hESAM) in canine kidney epithelial MDCK-II cells lowered the permeability to macromolecules in a manner similar to that of propionate-treated Caco-2 cells. hESAM overexpression facilitated calcium-induced assembly of the TJ complex in MDCK-II cells. Taken together, propionate strengthened the intestinal TJ barrier by increasing ESAM levels in Caco-2 cells.

Abstract: Gastric cancer is a serious malignant tumor in the world, accounting for the third cause of cancer death worldwide. The pathogenesis of gastric cancer is very complex, in which epigenetic inheritance plays an important role. In our study, we found that DZIP3 was significantly up-regulated in gastric cancer tissues as compared to adjacent normal tissue, which suggested it may be play a crucial part in gastric cancer. To clarify the mechanism of it, we further analyzed the interacting proteome and transcriptome of DZIP3. An association between DZIP3 and some epigenetic regulators, such as CUL4B complex, was verified. We also present the first proteomic characterization of the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of DZIP3. Then, the transcriptome analysis of DZIP3 demonstrated that knockdown DZIP3 increased a cohort of genes, including SETD7 and ZBTB4, which have essential role in tumors. We also revealed that DZIP3 promotes proliferation and metastasis of gastric cancer cells. And the higher expression of DZIP3 is positively associated with the poor prognosis of several cancers. In summary, our study revealed a mechanistic role of DZIP3 in promoting proliferation and metastasis in gastric cancer, supporting the pursuit of DZIP3 as a potential target for gastric cancer therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Efficient labeling of the vasculature is important for understanding the organization of vascular networks. Here, we propose VALID, a vessel-labeling method that enables visualization of vascular networks with tissue clearing and light-sheet microscopy. VALID transforms traditional lipophilic dye solution into hydrogel by introducing gelatin and restrains the dye aggregation, resulting in complete and uniform vessel-labeling patterns with high signal-to-background ratios. VALID also enhances the compatibility of lipophilic dyes with solvent-based tissue-clearing protocols, which was hard to achieve previously. Using VALID, we combined lipophilic dyes with solvent-based tissue-clearing techniques to perform 3D reconstructions of vasculature within mouse brain and spinal cord. We also employed VALID for 3D visualization and quantification of microvascular damage in a middle cerebral artery occlusion mouse model. VALID should provide a simple, cost-effective vessel-labeling protocol that would significantly widen the applications of lipophilic dyes in research on cerebrovascular complications.

Abstract: Summary
The chronic infection hypothesis for novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant emergence is increasingly gaining credence following the appearance of Omicron. Here, we investigate intrahost evolution and genetic diversity of lineage B.1.517 during a SARS-CoV-2 chronic infection lasting for 471 days (and still ongoing) with consistently recovered infectious virus and high viral genome copies. During the infection, we find an accelerated virus evolutionary rate translating to 35 nucleotide substitutions per year, approximately 2-fold higher than the global SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary rate. This intrahost evolution results in the emergence and persistence of at least three genetically distinct genotypes, suggesting the establishment of spatially structured viral populations continually reseeding different genotypes into the nasopharynx. Finally, we track the temporal dynamics of genetic diversity to identify advantageous mutations and highlight hallmark changes for chronic infection. Our findings demonstrate that untreated chronic infections accelerate SARS-CoV-2 evolution, providing an opportunity for the emergence of genetically divergent variants.

Abstract: Maladaptive repair after acute kidney injury (AKI) can predispose patients to chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the molecular mechanism underlying the AKI-to-CKD transition remains unclear. The Akt signaling pathway has been reported to be involved in the pathological processes of both AKI and CKD. In this study, we investigated the role of Akt1 in a murine model of the AKI-to-CKD transition. Wild-type (WT) and Akt1−/− mice were subjected to unilateral ischemia-reperfusion injury (UIRI), with their kidneys harvested after two days and two, four, and six weeks after UIRI. The dynamic changes in tubulointerstitial fibrosis, markers of tubular epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and tubular apoptosis were investigated. Akt1 of the three Akt isoforms was activated during the AKI-to-CKD transition. After UIRI, tubulointerstitial fibrosis and tubular EMT were significantly increased in WT mice, but were attenuated in Akt1−/− mice. The expression of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1/Smad was increased in both WT and Akt1−/− mice, but was not different between the two groups. The levels of phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β, Snail, and β-catenin in the Akt1−/− mice were lower than those in the WT mice. The number of apoptotic tubular cells and the expression of cleaved caspase-3/Bax were both lower in Akt1−/− mice than in WT mice. Genetic deletion of Akt1 was associated with attenuation of tubulointerstitial fibrosis, tubular EMT, and tubular apoptosis during the AKI-to-CKD transition. These findings were associated with TGF-β1/Akt1/GSK-3β/(Snail and β-catenin) signaling independent of TGF-β1/Smad signaling. Thus, Akt1 signaling could serve as a potential therapeutic target for inhibiting the AKI-to-CKD transition.

Abstract: Summary
Improving methods for human embryonic stem cell differentiation represents a challenge in modern regenerative medicine research. Using drug repurposing approaches, we discover small molecules that regulate the formation of definitive endoderm. Among them are inhibitors of known processes involved in endoderm differentiation (mTOR, PI3K, and JNK pathways) and a new compound, with an unknown mechanism of action, capable of inducing endoderm formation in the absence of growth factors in the media. Optimization of the classical protocol by inclusion of this compound achieves the same differentiation efficiency with a 90% cost reduction. The presented in silico procedure for candidate molecule selection has broad potential for improving stem cell differentiation protocols.

Abstract: Exosome is an important way for tumor cells to communicate with other cells and plays an important role in tumor progression. Previous studies revealed that miR-195-5p acts as a tumor suppressor in lung cancer. However, the role and molecular mechanism of exosomal transferred miR-195-5p in lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) remains unknown. Here, we found that miR-195-5p expression in circulating exosomes of LAC patients was lower than that of healthy controls. Meanwhile, the expression of exosomal miR-195-5p from normal bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B cells was significantly higher than that of lung cancer cell lines. The exosome labeling assay confirmed that BEAS-2B cells-derived exosomes could be captured by lung cancer cells. Furthermore, exosomal miR-195-5p derived from BEAS-2B cells remarkably inhibited the proliferation, migration, invasion of lung cancer cells, and tumor growth in vivo. In addition, exosomal miR-195-5p from BEAS-2B cells also suppressed the tube-forming ability of vascular endothelial cells. Moreover, we verified that miR-195-5p decreased apelin (APLN) expression to inactivate the Wnt signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting tumor invasiveness and angiogenesis. In conclusion, our research shows that exosomal miR-195-5p from normal bronchial epithelial cells hinders the progression of LAC, suggesting that regulation of exosomal miR-195-5p provides a novel strategy for LAC treatment.

Abstract: Disturbances in chondrocyte extracellular matrix (ECM) metabolism in osteoarthritis (OA) are a major cause of OA and potentially lead to personal disability, placing a huge burden on society. Chondrocyte apoptosis and ECM catabolism have a major role in the OA process. Firstly, bioinformatics analysis was performed to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in OA, and serine palmitoyltransferase subunit 2 (SPTLC2) was chosen, which had high-level expression in the OA cartilage tissues and OA chondrocytes. Overexpression and knockdown of SPTLC2 were achieved in OA chondrocytes and normal chondrocytes respectively to study the effect of SPTLC2 upon ECM metabolism of chondrocytes. Cell viability and apoptosis were measured using MTT and flow cytometry analyses; SPTLC2 overexpression enhanced the OA chondrocyte viability and decreased apoptotic rate. In addition, Western blot detection of ECM-related factors (Collagen I, Collage II, MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-13) revealed that SPTLC2 overexpression promoted the expression of collagens (Collagen I and Collage II) and suppressed matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-13) level. In contrast, SPTLC2 knockdown in normal chondrocytes showed opposite effects on cell viability, apoptosis, and ECM degeneration. The articular cartilage of OA rats was transfected with lentivirus overexpressing SPTLC2; HE and Safranin-O fast green demonstrated that SPTLC2 overexpression could alleviate chondrocyte injuries and slow down the development of OA. In conclusion, SPTLC2 plays a role in OA and may be a potential target gene for the treatment of OA.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular immune defects associated with suboptimal responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mRNA vaccination in people receiving hemodialysis (HD) are poorly understood. We longitudinally analyze antibody, B cell, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell vaccine responses in 27 HD patients and 26 low-risk control individuals (CIs). The first two doses elicit weaker B cell and CD8+ T cell responses in HD than in CI, while CD4+ T cell responses are quantitatively similar. In HD, a third dose robustly boosts B cell responses, leads to convergent CD8+ T cell responses, and enhances comparatively more T helper (TH) immunity. Unsupervised clustering of single-cell features reveals phenotypic and functional shifts over time and between cohorts. The third dose attenuates some features of TH cells in HD (tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNFα]/interleukin [IL]-2 skewing), while others (CCR6, CXCR6, programmed cell death protein 1 [PD-1], and HLA-DR overexpression) persist. Therefore, a third vaccine dose is critical to achieving robust multifaceted immunity in hemodialysis patients, although some distinct TH characteristics endure.

Abstract: Aberrant regulation of ubiquitination is an essential fundamental process in tumors, especially intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA). We reported that OTUB2, an OTU deubiquitinase, is upregulated in iCCA and stabilizes the CTNNB1-ZEB1 axis, resulting in epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and iCCA metastasis. Mechanistically, OTUB2 promotes CTNNB1 expression by interacting with the E3 ligase TRAF6. OTUB2 inhibits the lysosomal degradation of CTNNB1 by interacting with TRAF6 and thus regulates the progression of iCCA through ZEB1. Clinically, high OTUB2 expression is related to increased ZEB1 expression and activity and reduced overall survival in iCCA patients. Therefore, advanced iCCA patients may benefit from drugs targeting OTUB2 and its pathway.

Abstract: Summary
In addition to increasing β-amyloid plaque deposition and tau tangle formation, inhibition of neurogenesis has recently been observed in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This study generated a cellular model that recapitulated neurogenesis defects observed in patients with AD, using induced pluripotent stem cell lines derived from sporadic and familial AD (AD iPSCs). AD iPSCs exhibited impaired neuron and oligodendrocyte generation when expression of several senescence markers was induced. Compound screening using these cellular models identified three drugs able to restore neurogenesis, and extensive morphological quantification revealed cell-line- and drug-type-dependent neuronal generation. We also found involvement of elevated Sma- and Mad-related protein 1/5/9 (SMAD1/5/9) phosphorylation and greater Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) expression in neurogenesis defects in AD. Moreover, BMP4 was elevated in AD iPSC medium during neural differentiation and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with AD, suggesting a BMP4-SMAD1/5/9-RUNX2 signaling pathway contribution to neurogenesis defects in AD under senescence-related conditions.

Abstract: Previous studies have highlighted the poor prognosis of liver cancer, and treatment effects are overall limited. We aimed to confirm the biological roles of SIAH2 in liver cancer and provide potential therapeutic targets. Differential analysis was conducted based on public datasets and found that SIAH2 expressed lowly in HCC samples relative to normal tissues, which was demonstrated in tumor samples via immunohistochemistry (IHC). Besides, SIAH2 overexpression could significantly suppress HCC proliferation. SIAH2 deficiency induced cell proliferation, migration and self-renewal abilities in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, SIAH2 could interact with WNK1, and trigger the ubiquitination and degradation of WNK1 proteins. In addition, low SIAH2 depended on elevated WNK1 proteins to drive HCC malignant features, including proliferation, migration and stemness. Meanwhile, we further found that CBX2 could regulate SIAH2 expressions. CBX2 cooperated with EZH2 to mediate the H3K27me3 enrichment on the promoter region of SIAH2 to suppress its transcriptional levels. High CBX2/EZH2 levels in HCC correlated with poor prognosis of patients. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) further implicated that WNK1 correlates tightly with glycolytic process in HCC samples. WNK1 overexpression was found to notably enhance glycolytic activity, whereas WNK1 deficiency could significantly suppress the HCC glycolysis activity. Lastly, the subcutaneous tumor model further demonstrated that targeting WNK1 was effective to inhibit the in vivo tumor growth of SIAH2low HCC. Collectively, down-regulated SIAH2 expressions induced by CBX2/EZH2 could drive progression and glycolysis via accumulating WNK1 proteins, indicating that CBX2/SIAH2/WNK1 axis is a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic vulnerability for human HCC.

Abstract: Summary
Aberrant N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification on mRNA is correlated with cancer progression. However, the role of m6A on ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in cancer remains poorly understood. Our current study reveals that METTL5/TRMT112 and their mediated m6A modification at the 18S rRNA 1832 site (m6A1832) are elevated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and promote oncogenic transformation in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, loss of catalytic activity of METTL5 abolishes its oncogenic functions. Mechanistically, m6A1832 18S rRNA modification facilitates the assembly of 80S ribosome via bridging the RPL24-18S rRNA interaction, therefore promoting the translation of mRNAs with 5′ terminal oligopyrimidine (5′ TOP) motifs. Further mechanistic analysis reveals that METTL5 enhances HSF4b translation to activate the transcription of HSP90B1, which binds with oncogenic mutant p53 (mutp53) protein and prevents it from undergoing ubiquitination-dependent degradation, therefore facilitating NPC tumorigenesis and chemoresistance. Overall, our findings uncover an innovative mechanism underlying rRNA epigenetic modification in regulating mRNA translation and the mutp53 pathway in cancer.

Abstract: Objective
This study aimed to investigate the inhibiting effects of FHL2 and Arbutin on cell fibrosis and their possible mechanisms.
Methods
The mRNA expression of FHL2 in pulmonary fibrosis tissues was analyzed by bioinformatics. TGF⁃β1 induced fibrosis of mouse lung fibroblast (Mlg) and mouse primary pulmonary fibroblast (PPF) in rat's lung fibroblasts. FHL2 siRNA was transfected into Mlg and mouse PPF cells to inhibit FHL2. FHL2, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), collagen 1 (Col I), and Fibronectin (Fn) were detected by qRT-PCR. Western blot expression levels of Smad3, p-Smad3, Smad2, and p-Smad2 proteins in cells. High-throughput drug screening for FHL2 inhibitors and the inhibitory effect of Arbutin on pulmonary fibrosis were validated in cellular and animal models of pulmonary fibrosis.
Results
The mRNA expression of FHL2 in lung fiber tissue was increased. Meanwhile, the decrease of FHL2 expression significantly inhibited the cellular fibrosis morphological changes of rat's lung fibroblasts (Mlgs) and primary lung fibroblasts (PPFs). The expression levels of α⁃SMA, Col I, and Fn were decreased. High-throughput screening showed that Arbutin targeted FHL2. Arbutin alleviated bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rats by inhibiting FHL2 and then the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway.
Conclusion
Inhibition of FHL2 can effectively reduce the fibrosis process induced by TGF⁃β1 and bleomycin, and then inhibit the fibrosis.

Abstract: High mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1), a highly conserved non-histone nuclear protein, is highly expressed in fibrotic diseases; however, the role of HMGB1 in pulmonary fibrosis has not been fully elucidated. In this study, an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) model was constructed using transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) to stimulate BEAS-2B cells in vitro, and HMGB1 was knocked down or overexpressed to observe its effects on cell proliferation, migration and EMT. Meanwhile, string system, immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence analyses were applied to identify and examine the relationship between HMGB1 and its potential interacting protein Brahma-related gene 1 (BRG1), and to explore the mechanism of interaction between HMGB1 and BRG1 in EMT. The results indicate that exogenous increase in HMGB1 promotes cell proliferation and migration and facilitates EMT by enhancing the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, whereas silencing HMGB1 has the opposite effect. Mechanistically, HMGB1 exerts these functions by interacting with BRG1, which may enhance BRG1 function and activate the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, thereby promoting EMT. These results suggest that HMGB1 is important for EMT and is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.

Abstract: Summary
The separation of pneumococcal serotypes from a complex polymicrobial mixture may be required for different applications. For instance, a minority strain could be present at a low frequency in a clinical sample, making it difficult to identify and isolate by traditional culture-based methods. We therefore developed an assay to separate mixed pneumococcal samples using serotype-specific antiserum and a magnetic bead-based separation method. Using qPCR and colony counting methods, we first show that serotypes (12F, 23F, 3, 14, 19A, and 15A) present at ∼0.1% of a dual serotype mixture can be enriched to between 10% and 90% of the final sample. We demonstrate two applications for this method: extraction of known pneumococcal serotypes from saliva samples and efficient purification of capsule switch variants from experimental transformation experiments. This method may have further laboratory or clinical applications when the selection of specific serotypes is required.

Abstract: Summary
Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) is an inherited progressive disease characterized by electrophysiological and structural remodeling of the ventricles. However, the disease-causing molecular pathways, as a consequence of desmosomal mutations, are poorly understood. Here, we identified a novel missense mutation within desmoplakin in a patient clinically diagnosed with ACM. Using CRISPR-Cas9, we corrected this mutation in patient-derived human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and generated an independent knockin hiPSC line carrying the same mutation. Mutant cardiomyocytes displayed a decline in connexin 43, NaV1.5, and desmosomal proteins, which was accompanied by a prolonged action potential duration. Interestingly, paired-like homeodomain 2 (PITX2), a transcription factor that acts a repressor of connexin 43, NaV1.5, and desmoplakin, was induced in mutant cardiomyocytes. We validated these results in control cardiomyocytes in which PITX2 was either depleted or overexpressed. Importantly, knockdown of PITX2 in patient-derived cardiomyocytes is sufficient to restore the levels of desmoplakin, connexin 43, and NaV1.5.

Abstract: Summary
Prediabetes and its pathophysiology remain important issues. We aimed to examine the cluster characteristics of prediabetes and explore their associations with developing diabetes and its complications based on 12 variables representing body fat, glycemic measures, pancreatic β cell function, insulin resistance, blood lipids, and liver enzymes. A total of 55,777 individuals with prediabetes from the China Cardiometabolic Disease and Cancer Cohort (4C) were classified at baseline into six clusters. During a median of 3.1 years of follow-up, significant differences in the risks of diabetes and its complications between clusters were observed. The odds ratios of diabetes stepwisely increase from cluster 1 to cluster 6. Clusters 1, 4, and 6 have increased chronic kidney diseases risks, while the prediabetes in cluster 4, characterized by obesity and insulin resistance, confers higher risks of cardiovascular diseases compared with others. This subcategorization has potential value in developing more precise strategies for targeted prediabetes prevention and treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Chromosome 20 abnormalities are some of the most frequent genomic changes acquired by human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) cultures worldwide. Yet their effects on differentiation remain largely unexplored. We investigated a recurrent abnormality also found on amniocentesis, the isochromosome 20q (iso20q), during a clinical retinal pigment epithelium differentiation. Here we show that the iso20q abnormality interrupts spontaneous embryonic lineage specification. Isogenic lines revealed that under conditions that promote the spontaneous differentiation of wild-type hPSCs, the iso20q variants fail to differentiate into primitive germ layers and to downregulate pluripotency networks, resulting in apoptosis. Instead, iso20q cells are highly biased for extra-embryonic/amnion differentiation following inhibition of DNMT3B methylation or BMP2 treatment. Finally, directed differentiation protocols can overcome the iso20q block. Our findings reveal in iso20q a chromosomal abnormality that impairs the developmental competency of hPSCs toward germ layers but not amnion, which models embryonic developmental bottlenecks in the presence of aberrations.

Abstract: Summary
The therapeutic potential of ligands targeting disease-associated membrane proteins is predicted by ligand-receptor binding constants, which can be determined using NanoLuciferase (NanoLuc)-based bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (NanoBRET) methods. However, the broad applicability of these methods is hampered by the restricted availability of fluorescent probes. We describe the use of antibody fragments, like nanobodies, as universal building blocks for fluorescent probes for use in NanoBRET. Our nanobody-NanoBRET (NanoB2) workflow starts with the generation of NanoLuc-tagged receptors and fluorescent nanobodies, enabling homogeneous, real-time monitoring of nanobody-receptor binding. Moreover, NanoB2 facilitates the assessment of receptor binding of unlabeled ligands in competition binding experiments. The broad significance is illustrated by the successful application of NanoB2 to different drug targets (e.g., multiple G protein-coupled receptors [GPCRs] and a receptor tyrosine kinase [RTK]) at distinct therapeutically relevant binding sites (i.e., extracellular and intracellular).

Abstract: Preeclampsia (PE) is a common complication of pregnancy, usually accompanied by symptoms such as hypertension and proteinuria. It can induce severe conditions that may result in maternal and fetal morbidity and fatality. In this study, we use bioinformatics analysis to compare microRNA microassay in decidual stromal cells from PE patients and healthy donors. Our result indicated that placentas from PE patients had a higher CCL1/CXCL2 expression, compared with those from healthy donors. Bioinformatics analysis confirmed that decidual stromal cells derived from PE patients expressed significantly lower miR-455–3p than those derived from healthy donors. Transfection of miR-455–3p inhibitors enhanced the CCL2/CXCL8 expression in decidual stromal cells, and luciferase activity assay confirmed that nuclear factor of activated T cells 5 (NFAT5) mRNA was the direct target of miR-455–3p; NFAT5 also promoted cytokine secretion. In the flow cytometry study, higher M1 macrophage infiltration was observed in placentas from PE patients than in those from healthy donors. We also observed that condition medium (CM) derived from decidual stromal cells could significantly promote M1 polarization of macrophages after transfection with miR-455–3p inhibitor; further, transwell invasion assay confirmed that decidual stromal cells-CM educated macrophages suppressed trophoblast invasion. Taken together, our result demonstrates that downregulation of miR-455–3p in decidual stromal cells can promote macrophage polarization and suppress trophoblasts invasion.

Abstract: Summary
Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) carries tumor-specific genetic and epigenetic variations. To identify extranodal natural killer/T cell lymphoma (ENKTL)-specific methylation markers and establish a diagnostic and prognosis prediction model for ENKTL, we describe the ENKTL-specific ctDNA methylation patterns by analyzing the methylation profiles of ENKTL plasma samples. We construct a diagnostic prediction model based on ctDNA methylation markers with both high specificity and sensitivity and close relevance to tumor staging and therapeutic response. Subsequently, we built a prognostic prediction model showing excellent performance, and its predictive accuracy is significantly better than the Ann Arbor staging and prognostic index of natural killer lymphoma (PINK) risk system. Notably, we further establish a PINK-C risk grading system to select individualized treatment for patients with different prognostic risks. In conclusion, these results suggest that ctDNA methylation markers are of great value in diagnosis, monitoring, and prognosis, which might have implications for clinical decision-making of patients with ENKTL.

Abstract: Summary
Human norovirus is the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis. Young children and the elderly bear the greatest burden of disease, representing more than 200,000 deaths annually. Infection prevalence peaks at younger than 2 years and is driven by novel GII.4 variants that emerge and spread globally. Using a surrogate neutralization assay, we characterize the evolution of the serological neutralizing antibody (nAb) landscape in young children as they transition between sequential GII.4 pandemic variants. Following upsurge of the replacement variant, antigenic cartography illustrates remodeling of the nAb landscape to the new variant accompanied by improved nAb titer. However, nAb relative avidity remains focused on the preceding variant. These data support immune imprinting as a mechanism of immune evasion and GII.4 virus persistence across a population. Understanding the complexities of immunity to rapidly evolving and co-circulating viral variants, like those of norovirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), and dengue viruses, will fundamentally inform vaccine design for emerging pathogens.

Abstract: Summary
Medical artificial intelligence (AI) has been moving from the research phase to clinical implementation. However, most AI-based models are mainly built using high-quality images preprocessed in the laboratory, which is not representative of real-world settings. This dataset bias proves a major driver of AI system dysfunction. Inspired by the design of flow cytometry, DeepFundus, a deep-learning-based fundus image classifier, is developed to provide automated and multidimensional image sorting to address this data quality gap. DeepFundus achieves areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) over 0.9 in image classification concerning overall quality, clinical quality factors, and structural quality analysis on both the internal test and national validation datasets. Additionally, DeepFundus can be integrated into both model development and clinical application of AI diagnostics to significantly enhance model performance for detecting multiple retinopathies. DeepFundus can be used to construct a data-driven paradigm for improving the entire life cycle of medical AI practice.

Abstract: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in regulating several physiological processes and have been implicated in several pathologies including cancer. LncRNAs have been found to regulate key cellular pathways involved in cancer development, and their aberrant expression plays critical roles in the onset or progression of disease. The role of lncRNAs in breast cancer (BC) has become a hot topic of research in recent years. We previously showed that LINC00365 inhibits BC survival. In the current study, based on the important role of energy metabolism and HIF-1α for tumor cell proliferation, we investigated the role and mechanism of the LINC00365/HIF-1α axis in affecting tumor growth through glycolysis using the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and HCC-1937. We found that LINC00365 inhibited BC cell proliferation. Furthermore, LINC00365 overexpression suppressed aerobic glycolysis in BC cells. RNA-sequencing identified hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), which has been linked with glycolysis and upregulates glycolysis-related genes, as a potential target gene of LINC00365. Accordingly, we found that LINC00365 overexpression resulted in decreased expression of key glycolytic enzymes such as downstream hexokinase 2 (HK2), recombinant pyruvate kinase isozymes M2 (PKM2) and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). Our results suggest that targeting LINC00365 may reverse the glucose metabolism pattern of BC and effectively inhibit BC survival both in vitro and in vivo.

Abstract: Oxidative stress including decreased antioxidant enzyme activities, elevated lipid peroxidation, and accumulation of advanced glycation end products in the blood from children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has been reported. The mechanisms affecting the development of ASD remain unclear; however, toxic environmental exposures leading to oxidative stress have been proposed to play a significant role. The BTBRT+Itpr3tf/J (BTBR) strain provides a model to investigate the markers of oxidation in a mouse strain exhibiting ASD-like behavioral phenotypes. In the present study, we investigated the level of oxidative stress and its effects on immune cell populations, specifically oxidative stress affecting surface thiols (R-SH), intracellular glutathione (iGSH), and expression of brain biomarkers that may contribute to the development of the ASD-like phenotypes that have been observed and reported in BTBR mice. Lower levels of cell surface R-SH were detected on multiple immune cell subpopulations from blood, spleens, and lymph nodes and for sera R-SH levels of BTBR mice compared to C57BL/6 J (B6) mice. The iGSH levels of immune cell populations were also lower in the BTBR mice. Elevated protein expression of GATA3, TGM2, AhR, EPHX2, TSLP, PTEN, IRE1α, GDF15, and metallothionein in BTBR mice is supportive of an increased level of oxidative stress in BTBR mice and may underpin the pro-inflammatory immune state that has been reported in the BTBR strain. Results of a decreased antioxidant system suggest an important oxidative stress role in the development of the BTBR ASD-like phenotype.

Abstract: Summary
As a clinical vaccine, lipid nanoparticle (LNP) mRNA has demonstrated potent and broad antibody responses, leading to speculation about its potential for antibody discovery. Here, we developed RAMIHM, a highly efficient strategy for developing fully human monoclonal antibodies that employs rapid mRNA immunization of humanized mice followed by single B cell sequencing (scBCR-seq). We immunized humanized transgenic mice with RAMIHM and generated 15 top-ranked clones from peripheral blood, plasma B, and memory B cell populations, demonstrating a high rate of antigen-specificity (93.3%). Two Omicron-specific neutralizing antibodies with high potency and one broad-spectrum neutralizing antibody were discovered. Furthermore, we extended the application of RAMIHM to cancer immunotherapy targets, including a single transmembrane protein CD22 and a multi-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor target, GPRC5D, which is difficult for traditional protein immunization methods. RAMIHM-scBCR-seq is a broadly applicable platform for the rapid and efficient development of fully human monoclonal antibodies against an assortment of targets.

Abstract: Summary
The decay kinetics of HIV-1-infected cells are critical to understand virus persistence. We evaluated the frequency of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected cells for 4 years of antiretroviral therapy (ART). The intact proviral DNA assay (IPDA) and an assay for hypermutated proviruses revealed short- and long-term infected cell dynamics in macaques starting ART ∼1 year after infection. Intact SIV genomes in circulating CD4+T cells showed triphasic decay with an initial phase slower than the decay of the plasma virus, a second phase faster than the second phase decay of intact HIV-1, and a stable third phase reached after 1.6–2.9 years. Hypermutated proviruses showed bi- or mono-phasic decay, reflecting different selective pressures. Viruses replicating at ART initiation had mutations conferring antibody escape. With time on ART, viruses with fewer mutations became more prominent, reflecting decay of variants replicating at ART initiation. Collectively, these findings confirm ART efficacy and indicate that cells enter the reservoir throughout untreated infection.

Abstract: Summary
Our machine-learning framework, brain and organoid manifold alignment (BOMA), first performs a global alignment of developmental gene expression data between brains and organoids. It then applies manifold learning to locally refine the alignment, revealing conserved and specific developmental trajectories across brains and organoids. Using BOMA, we found that human cortical organoids better align with certain brain cortical regions than with other non-cortical regions, implying organoid-preserved developmental gene expression programs specific to brain regions. Additionally, our alignment of non-human primate and human brains reveals highly conserved gene expression around birth. Also, we integrated and analyzed developmental single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of human brains and organoids, showing conserved and specific cell trajectories and clusters. Further identification of expressed genes of such clusters and enrichment analyses reveal brain- or organoid-specific developmental functions and pathways. Finally, we experimentally validated important specific expressed genes through the use of immunofluorescence. BOMA is open-source available as a web tool for community use.

Abstract: Summary
Due to their critical functions in cell sensing and signal processing, membrane proteins are highly preferred as pharmacological targets, and antibody drugs constitute the fastest growing category of therapeutic agents on the pharmaceutical market. However, major limitations exist in developing antibodies that recognize complex, multipass transmembrane proteins, such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). These challenges, largely due to difficulties with recombinant expression of multipass transmembrane proteins, can be overcome using whole-cell screening techniques, which enable presentation of the functional antigen in its native conformation. Here, we developed suspension cell-based whole-cell panning methodologies to screen for specific binders against GPCRs within a naive yeast-displayed antibody library. We implemented our strategy to discover high-affinity antibodies against four distinct GPCR target proteins, demonstrating the potential for our cell-based screening workflow to advance the discovery of antibody therapeutics targeting membrane proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Chromosome 15q11-q13 duplication syndrome (Dup15q) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by maternal duplications of this region. Autism and epilepsy are key features of Dup15q. UBE3A, which encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is likely a major driver of Dup15q because UBE3A is the only imprinted gene expressed solely from the maternal allele. Nevertheless, the exact role of UBE3A has not been determined. To establish whether UBE3A overexpression is required for Dup15q neuronal deficits, we generated an isogenic control line for a Dup15q patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell line. Dup15q neurons exhibited hyperexcitability compared with control neurons, and this phenotype was generally prevented by normalizing UBE3A levels using antisense oligonucleotides. Overexpression of UBE3A resulted in a profile similar to that of Dup15q neurons except for synaptic phenotypes. These results indicate that UBE3A overexpression is necessary for most Dup15q cellular phenotypes but also suggest a role for other genes in the duplicated region.

Abstract: Thymocyte antigen-1 (THY-1)is a potential target for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment, and THY-1 positive fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) are enriched in the synovium of RA patients and participate in angiogenesis to accelerate RA progression. In this study, we screened an antibody targeting THY-1 (THY-1 Ab) and explored its mechanism in alleviating RA progression. THY-1 Ab was screened from ScFv phage antibody library by phage display technology (PDT). THY-1 Ab–treated collagen induced arthritis (CIA) mice had lower degree of arthritis scores. We explore the mechanism of THY-1 Ab in alleviating RA progression. THY-1 Ab can remarkably inhibit the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors and promote the secretion of anti-inflammatory factors. Further experiments showed that THY1 Ab downregulated the expression of JUNB by the hsa_circ_0094342/miRNA-155–5P/SPI1 axis, inhibited RA angiogenesis and osteoclast differentiation, and relieved RA progression. These findings support that THY-1 Ab is a promising therapeutic antibody for RA treatment.

Abstract: COVID-19 disease, which spreads worldwide, is a disease characterized by widespread inflammation and affects many organs, especially the lungs. The resulting inflammation can lead to reactive oxygen radicals, leading to oxidative DNA damage. The pneumonia severity of 95 hospitalized patients with positive RT-PCR test was determined and divided into three groups: mild, moderate, and severe/critical. Inflammation markers (neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio, serum reactive protein, procalcitonin, etc.) were determined, and IL-10 and IFN-γ measurements were analyzed using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. In evaluating oxidative damage, total thiol, native thiol, disulfide, and ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) levels were determined by measuring spectrophotometrically. The comet assay method’s percentage of tail DNA obtained was used to determine oxidative DNA damage. As a result, when the mild and severe/critical groups were compared, we found that total thiol, native thiol, and disulfide levels decreased significantly in the severe/critical group due to the increase in inflammation markers and cytokine levels (p < 0.05). We could not detect any significance in IMA levels between the groups (p > 0.05). At the same time, we determined an increase in the tail DNA percent level, that is, DNA damage, due to the increased oxidative effect. As a result, we determined that inflammation and oxidative stress increased in patients with severe pneumonia, and there was DNA damage in these patients.

Abstract: Summary
Bispecific T cell engagers (bsTCEs) hold great promise for cancer treatment but face challenges due to the induction of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), on-target off-tumor toxicity, and the engagement of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells that limit efficacy. The development of Vγ9Vδ2-T cell engagers may overcome these challenges by combining high therapeutic efficacy with limited toxicity. By linking a CD1d-specific single-domain antibody (VHH) to a Vδ2-TCR-specific VHH, we create a bsTCE with trispecific properties, which engages not only Vγ9Vδ2-T cells but also type 1 NKT cells to CD1d+ tumors and triggers robust proinflammatory cytokine production, effector cell expansion, and target cell lysis in vitro. We show that CD1d is expressed by the majority of patient MM, (myelo)monocytic AML, and CLL cells and that the bsTCE triggers type 1 NKT and Vγ9Vδ2-T cell-mediated antitumor activity against these patient tumor cells and improves survival in in vivo AML, MM, and T-ALL mouse models. Evaluation of a surrogate CD1d-γδ bsTCE in NHPs shows Vγ9Vδ2-T cell engagement and excellent tolerability. Based on these results, CD1d-Vδ2 bsTCE (LAVA-051) is now evaluated in a phase 1/2a study in patients with therapy refractory CLL, MM, or AML.

Abstract: Summary
Inhibitory neurons originating from the ventral forebrain are associated with several neurological conditions. Distinct ventral forebrain subpopulations are generated from topographically defined zones; lateral-, medial- and caudal ganglionic eminences (LGE, MGE and CGE), yet key specification factors often span across developing zones contributing to difficulty in defining unique LGE, MGE or CGE profiles. Here we use human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) reporter lines (NKX2.1-GFP and MEIS2-mCherry) and manipulation of morphogen gradients to gain greater insight into regional specification of these distinct zones. We identified Sonic hedgehog (SHH)-WNT crosstalk in regulating LGE and MGE fate and uncovered a role for retinoic acid signaling in CGE development. Unraveling the influence of these signaling pathways permitted development of fully defined protocols that favored generation of the three GE domains. These findings provide insight into the context-dependent role of morphogens in human GE specification and are of value for in vitro disease modeling and advancement of new therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are bifunctional molecules that degrade target proteins through recruiting E3 ligases. However, their application is limited in part because few E3 ligases can be recruited by known E3 ligase ligands. In this study, we identified piperlongumine (PL), a natural product, as a covalent E3 ligase recruiter, which induces CDK9 degradation when it is conjugated with SNS-032, a CDK9 inhibitor. The lead conjugate 955 can potently degrade CDK9 in a ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent manner and is much more potent than SNS-032 against various tumor cells in vitro. Mechanistically, we identified KEAP1 as the E3 ligase recruited by 955 to degrade CDK9 through a TurboID-based proteomics study, which was further confirmed by KEAP1 knockout and the nanoBRET ternary complex formation assay. In addition, PL-ceritinib conjugate can degrade EML4-ALK fusion oncoprotein, suggesting that PL may have a broader application as a covalent E3 ligase ligand in targeted protein degradation.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor heterogeneity is an important driver of treatment failure in cancer since therapies often select for drug-tolerant or drug-resistant cellular subpopulations that drive tumor growth and recurrence. Profiling the drug-response heterogeneity of tumor samples using traditional genomic deconvolution methods has yielded limited results, due in part to the imperfect mapping between genomic variation and functional characteristics. Here, we leverage mechanistic population modeling to develop a statistical framework for profiling phenotypic heterogeneity from standard drug-screen data on bulk tumor samples. This method, called PhenoPop, reliably identifies tumor subpopulations exhibiting differential drug responses and estimates their drug sensitivities and frequencies within the bulk population. We apply PhenoPop to synthetically generated cell populations, mixed cell-line experiments, and multiple myeloma patient samples and demonstrate how it can provide individualized predictions of tumor growth under candidate therapies. This methodology can also be applied to deconvolution problems in a variety of biological settings beyond cancer drug response.

Abstract: Summary
The temporal organization of biological systems is key for understanding them, but current methods for identifying this organization are often ad hoc and require prior knowledge. We present Phasik, a method that automatically identifies this multiscale organization by combining time series data (protein or gene expression) and interaction data (protein-protein interaction network). Phasik builds a (partially) temporal network and uses clustering to infer temporal phases. We demonstrate the method’s effectiveness by recovering well-known phases and sub-phases of the cell cycle of budding yeast and phase arrests of mutants. We also show its general applicability using temporal gene expression data from circadian rhythms in wild-type and mutant mouse models. We systematically test Phasik’s robustness and investigate the effect of having only partial temporal information. As time-resolved, multiomics datasets become more common, this method will allow the study of temporal regulation in lesser-known biological contexts, such as development, metabolism, and disease.

Abstract: Summary
Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) regulates plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels by promoting the degradation of hepatic LDL receptors (LDLRs). Current therapeutic approaches use antibodies that disrupt PCSK9 binding to LDLR to reduce circulating LDL-C concentrations or siRNA that reduces PCSK9 synthesis and thereby levels in circulation. Recent reports describe small molecules that, like therapeutic antibodies, interfere with PCSK9 binding to LDLR. We report an alternative approach to decrease circulating PCSK9 levels by accelerating PCSK9 clearance and degradation using heterobifunctional molecules that simultaneously bind to PCSK9 and the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR). Various formats, including bispecific antibodies, antibody-small molecule conjugates, and heterobifunctional small molecules, demonstrate binding in vitro and accelerated PCSK9 clearance in vivo. These molecules showcase a new approach to PCSK9 inhibition, targeted plasma protein degradation (TPPD), and demonstrate the feasibility of heterobifunctional small molecule ligands to accelerate the clearance and degradation of pathogenic proteins in circulation.

Abstract: Summary
The molecular understanding of host-pathogen interactions in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of superspreader hosts is incomplete. In a mouse model of chronic, asymptomatic Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Tm) infection, we performed untargeted metabolomics on the feces of mice and found that superspreader hosts possess distinct metabolic signatures compared with non-superspreaders, including differential levels of L-arabinose. RNA-seq on S. Tm from superspreader fecal samples showed increased expression of the L-arabinose catabolism pathway in vivo. By combining bacterial genetics and diet manipulation, we demonstrate that diet-derived L-arabinose provides S. Tm a competitive advantage in the GI tract, and expansion of S. Tm in the GI tract requires an alpha-N-arabinofuranosidase that liberates L-arabinose from dietary polysaccharides. Ultimately, our work shows that pathogen-liberated L-arabinose from the diet provides a competitive advantage to S. Tm in vivo. These findings propose L-arabinose as a critical driver of S. Tm expansion in the GI tracts of superspreader hosts.

Abstract: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and associated oxidative stress are involved in the genesis and progression of skeletal muscle diseases such as myositis and atrophy or muscle wasting. Targeting the ER stress and associated downstream pathways can aid in the development of better treatment strategies for these diseases with limited therapeutic approaches. There is a growing interest in identifying natural products against ER stress due to the lower toxicity and cost effectiveness. In the present study, we investigated the protective effect of Tangeretin, a citrus methoxyflavone found in citrus peels against Tunicamycin (pharmacological ER stress inducer)–induced ER stress and associated complications in rat skeletal muscle L6 cell lines. Treatment with Tunicamycin for a period of 24 h resulted in the upregulation of ER stress marker proteins, ER resident oxidoreductases and cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Co-treatment with Tangeretin was effective in alleviating Tunicamycin-induced ER stress and associated redox-related complications by significantly downregulating the unfolded protein response (UPR), ER resident oxidoreductase proteins, cellular ROS and improving the antioxidant enzyme activity. Tunicamycin also induced upregulation of phosphorylated p38 MAP Kinase and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Tangeretin significantly reduced the levels of phosphorylated p38 MAP Kinase and improved the mitochondrial membrane potential. From the results, it is evident that Tangeretin can be explored further as a potential candidate for skeletal muscle diseases involving protein misfolding and ER stress.

Abstract: Summary
The molecular transducers conferring the benefits of chronic exercise in diabetes prevention remain to be comprehensively investigated. Herein, serum proteomic profiling of 688 inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers in 36 medication-naive overweight and obese men with prediabetes reveals hundreds of exercise-responsive proteins modulated by 12-week high-intensity interval exercise training, including regulators of metabolism, cardiovascular system, inflammation, and apoptosis. Strong associations are found between proteins involved in gastro-intestinal mucosal immunity and metabolic outcomes. Exercise-induced changes in trefoil factor 2 (TFF2) are associated with changes in insulin resistance and fasting insulin, whereas baseline levels of the pancreatic secretory granule membrane major glycoprotein GP2 are related to changes in fasting glucose and glucose tolerance. A hybrid set of 23 proteins including TFF2 are differentially altered in exercise responders and non-responders. Furthermore, a machine-learning algorithm integrating baseline proteomic signatures accurately predicts individualized metabolic responsiveness to exercise training.

Abstract: Summary
Identifying the molecular mechanisms that promote optimal immune responses to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination is critical for future rational vaccine design. Here, we longitudinally profile innate and adaptive immune responses in 102 adults after the first, second, and third doses of mRNA or adenovirus-vectored COVID-19 vaccines. Using a multi-omics approach, we identify key differences in the immune responses induced by ChAdOx1-S and BNT162b2 that correlate with antigen-specific antibody and T cell responses or vaccine reactogenicity. Unexpectedly, we observe that vaccination with ChAdOx1-S, but not BNT162b2, induces an adenoviral vector-specific memory response after the first dose, which correlates with the expression of proteins with roles in thrombosis with potential implications for thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), a rare but serious adverse event linked to adenovirus-vectored vaccines. The COVID-19 Vaccine Immune Responses Study thus represents a major resource that can be used to understand the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of these COVID-19 vaccines.

Abstract: Summary
Regenerating prolonged multi-lineage hematopoiesis from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), an unlimited cell source, is a crucial aim of regenerative hematology. In this study, we used a gene-edited PSC line and revealed that simultaneous expression of three transcription factors, Runx1, Hoxa9, and Hoxa10, drove the robust emergence of induced hematopoietic progenitor cells (iHPCs). The iHPCs engrafted successfully in wild-type animals and repopulated abundant and complete myeloid-, B-, and T-lineage mature cells. The generative multi-lineage hematopoiesis distributed normally in multiple organs, persisted over 6 months, and eventually declined over time with no leukemogenesis. Transcriptome characterization of generative myeloid, B, and T cells at the single-cell resolution further projected their identities to natural cell counterparts. Thus, we provide evidence that co-expression of exogenous Runx1, Hoxa9, and Hoxa10 simultaneously leads to long-term reconstitution of myeloid, B, and T lineages using PSC-derived iHPCs as the cell source.

Abstract: In severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), intestinal mucosal barrier damage can cause intestinal bacterial translocation and induce or aggravate systemic infections. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is a validated antioxidant and cytoprotective agent. This research aimed to investigate the effect and mechanism of HO-1 on SAP-induced intestinal barrier damage in SAP rats. Healthy adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly separated into the sham-operated group, SAP group, SAP + Hemin group, and SAP + Znpp group. The rat model of SAP was established by retrograde injection of sodium taurocholate (5%) into the biliopancreatic duct. Hemin (a potent HO-1 activator) and Znpp (a competitive inhibitor of HO-1) were injected intraperitoneally in the selected groups 24 h before SAP. Serum and intestinal tissue samples were collected for analysis after 24 h in each group. Hemin pretreatment significantly reduced systemic inflammation, intestinal oxidative stress, and intestinal epithelial apoptosis in SAP by increasing HO-1 expression. Meanwhile, pretreatment with Hemin abolished the inhibitory effect on the expression of the tight junction proteins and significantly inhibited the activation of the MLCK/P-MLC signaling pathway. Conversely, ZnPP completely reversed these effects. Our study indicates that upregulation of HO-1 expression attenuates the intestinal mucosal barrier damage in SAP. The protective effect of HO-1 on the intestine is attributed to MLCK/p-MLC signaling pathway inhibition.

Abstract: Summary
Molecular mechanisms underlying cancer metastasis span diverse tissues of origin. Here, we synthesize and collate the transcriptomes of patient-derived xenografts and patient tumor metastases, and these data collectively represent 38 studies and over 3,000 patients and 4,000 tumors. We identify four expression-based subtypes of metastasis transcending tumor lineage. The first subtype has extensive copy alterations, higher expression of MYC transcriptional targets and DNA repair genes, and bromodomain inhibitor response association. The second subtype has higher expression of genes involving metabolism and prostaglandin synthesis and regulation. The third subtype has evidence of neuronal differentiation, higher expression of DNA and histone methylation genes and EZH2 transcriptional targets, and BCL2 inhibitor response association. The fourth subtype has higher expression of immune checkpoint and Notch pathway genes. The metastasis subtypes reflect expression differences from paired primaries, with subtype switching being common. These subtypes facilitate understanding of the molecular underpinnings of metastases beyond tissue-oriented domains, with therapeutic implications.

Abstract: Summary
The flip-excision switch (FLEX) system with an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector allows expression of transgenes in specific cell populations having Cre recombinase. A significant issue with this system is non-specific expression of transgenes in tissues after vector injection. We show here that Cre-independent recombination events in the AAV genome carrying the FLEX sequence occur mainly during the production of viral vectors in packaging cells, which results in transgene expression in off-target populations. Introduction of a relatively longer nucleotide sequence between two recognition sites at the unilateral side of the transgene cassette, termed a unilateral spacer sequence (USS), is useful to suppress the recombination in the viral genome, leading to the protection of non-specific transgene expression with enhanced gene expression selectivity. Our FLEX/USS system offers a powerful strategy for highly specific Cre-dependent transgene expression, aiming at various applications for structural and functional analyses of target cell populations.

Abstract: Summary
We describe an innovative system that exports diverse recombinant proteins in membrane-bound vesicles from E. coli. These recombinant vesicles compartmentalize proteins within a micro-environment that enables production of otherwise challenging insoluble, toxic, or disulfide-bond containing proteins from bacteria. The release of vesicle-packaged proteins supports isolation from the culture and allows long-term storage of active protein. This technology results in high yields of vesicle-packaged, functional proteins for efficient downstream processing for a wide range of applications from discovery science to applied biotechnology and medicine.

Abstract: The neurotoxin MPP+ triggers cell death of dopamine neurons and induces Parkinson's disease symptoms in mice and men, but the immediate transcriptional response to this neurotoxin has not been studied. We therefore treated human SH-SY5Y cells with a low dose (0.1 mM) of MPP+ and measured the effect on nascent transcription by precision run-on sequencing (PRO-seq). We found that transcription of the mitochondrial genome was significantly reduced already after 30 min, whereas nuclear gene transcription was unaffected. Inhibition of respiratory complex I by MPP+ led to reduced ATP production, that may explain the diminished activity of mitochondrial RNA polymerase. Our results show that MPP+ has a direct effect on mitochondrial function and transcription, and that other gene expression or epigenetic changes induced by this neurotoxin are secondary effects that reflect a cellular adaptation program.

Abstract: Summary
Prioritization of disease mechanisms, biomarkers, and drug targets in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) is complicated by altered interactions between thousands of genes. Our multi-organ single-cell RNA sequencing of a mouse IMID model, namely collagen-induced arthritis, shows highly complex and heterogeneous expression changes in all analyzed organs, even though only joints showed signs of inflammation. We organized those into a multi-organ multicellular disease model, which shows predicted molecular interactions within and between organs. That model supports that inflammation is switched on or off by altered balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory upstream regulators (URs) and downstream pathways. Meta-analyses of human IMIDs show a similar, but graded, on/off switch system. This system has the potential to prioritize, diagnose, and treat optimal combinations of URs on the levels of IMIDs, subgroups, and individual patients. That potential is supported by UR analyses in more than 600 sera from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.

Abstract: Summary
Progenitor cells capable of self-renewal and differentiation in the adult human pancreas are an under-explored resource for regenerative medicine. Using micro-manipulation and three-dimensional colony assays we identify cells within the adult human exocrine pancreas that resemble progenitor cells. Exocrine tissues were dissociated into single cells and plated into a colony assay containing methylcellulose and 5% Matrigel. A subpopulation of ductal cells formed colonies containing differentiated ductal, acinar, and endocrine lineage cells, and expanded up to 300-fold with a ROCK inhibitor. When transplanted into diabetic mice, colonies pre-treated with a NOTCH inhibitor gave rise to insulin-expressing cells. Both colonies and primary human ducts contained cells that simultaneously express progenitor transcription factors SOX9, NKX6.1, and PDX1. In addition, in silico analysis identified progenitor-like cells within ductal clusters in a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset. Therefore, progenitor-like cells capable of self-renewal and tri-lineage differentiation either pre-exist in the adult human exocrine pancreas, or readily adapt in culture.

Abstract: Summary
Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive adult brain cancer with few treatment options due in part to the challenges of identifying brain-penetrant drugs. Here, we investigated the mechanism of MM0299, a tetracyclic dicarboximide with anti-glioblastoma activity. MM0299 inhibits lanosterol synthase (LSS) and diverts sterol flux away from cholesterol into a “shunt” pathway that culminates in 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol (EPC). EPC synthesis following MM0299 treatment is both necessary and sufficient to block the growth of mouse and human glioma stem-like cells by depleting cellular cholesterol. MM0299 exhibits superior selectivity for LSS over other sterol biosynthetic enzymes. Critical for its application in the brain, we report an MM0299 derivative that is orally bioavailable, brain-penetrant, and induces the production of EPC in orthotopic GBM tumors but not normal mouse brain. These studies have implications for the development of an LSS inhibitor to treat GBM or other neurologic indications.

Abstract: Summary
In a large cohort of 1,772 participants from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos with overlapping 16SV4 rRNA gene (bacterial amplicon), ITS1 (fungal amplicon), and shotgun sequencing data, we demonstrate that 16SV4 amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomics offer the same level of taxonomic accuracy for bacteria at the genus level even at shallow sequencing depths. In contrast, for fungal taxa, we did not observe meaningful agreements between shotgun and ITS1 amplicon results. Finally, we show that amplicon and shotgun data can be harmonized and pooled to yield larger microbiome datasets with excellent agreement (<1% effect size variance across three independent outcomes) using pooled amplicon/shotgun data compared to pure shotgun metagenomic analysis. Thus, there are multiple approaches to study the microbiome in epidemiological studies, and we provide a demonstration of a powerful pooling approach that will allow researchers to leverage the massive amount of amplicon sequencing data generated over the last two decades.

Abstract: Summary
RNA oxidation has been implicated in neurodegeneration, but the underlying mechanism for such effects is unclear. Extensive RNA oxidation occurs within the neurons in multiple sclerosis (MS) brains. Here, we identified selectively oxidized mRNAs in neuronal cells that pertained to neuropathological pathways. N-acetyl aspartate transferase 8 like (NAT8L) is one such transcript, whose translation product enzymatically synthesizes N-acetyl aspartic acid (NAA), a neuronal metabolite important for myelin synthesis. We reasoned that impediment of translation of an oxidized NAT8L mRNA will result in a reduction in its cognate protein, thus lowering the NAA level. This hypothesis is supported by our studies on cells, an animal model, and postmortem human MS brain. Reduced brain NAA level hampers myelin integrity making neuronal axons more susceptible to damage, which contributes to MS neurodegeneration. Overall, this work provides a framework for a mechanistic understanding of the link between RNA oxidation and neurodegeneration.

Abstract: Summary
The adult rodent subventricular zone (SVZ) generates neural stem cells (NSCs) throughout life that migrate to the olfactory bulbs (OBs) and differentiate into olfactory interneurons. Few SVZ NSCs generate oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). We investigated how neurogliogenesis is regulated during aging in mice and in a non-human primate (NHP) model, the gray mouse lemur. In both species, neuronal commitment decreased with age, while OPC generation and myelin content unexpectedly increased. In the OBs, more tyrosine hydroxylase interneurons in old mice, but fewer in lemurs, marked a surprising interspecies difference that could relate to our observation of a continuous ventricle in lemurs. In the corpus callosum, aging promoted maturation of OPCs into mature oligodendrocytes in mice but blocked it in lemurs. The present study highlights similarities and dissimilarities between rodents and NHPs, revealing that NHPs are a more relevant model than mice to study the evolution of biomarkers of aging.

Abstract: Summary
Colonic goblet cells are specialized epithelial cells that secrete mucus to physically separate the host and its microbiota, thus preventing bacterial invasion and inflammation. How goblet cells control the amount of mucus they secrete is unclear. We found that constitutive activation of autophagy in mice via Beclin 1 enables the production of a thicker and less penetrable mucus layer by reducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Accordingly, genetically inhibiting Beclin 1-induced autophagy impairs mucus secretion, while pharmacologically alleviating ER stress results in excessive mucus production. This ER-stress-mediated regulation of mucus secretion is microbiota dependent and requires the Crohn’s-disease-risk gene Nod2. Overproduction of mucus alters the gut microbiome, specifically expanding mucus-utilizing bacteria, such as Akkermansia muciniphila, and protects against chemical and microbial-driven intestinal inflammation. Thus, ER stress is a cell-intrinsic switch that limits mucus secretion, whereas autophagy maintains intestinal homeostasis by relieving ER stress.
