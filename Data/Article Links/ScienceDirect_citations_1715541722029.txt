Abstract: The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a program of cellular development associated with loss of cell–cell contacts, a decreased cell adhesion and substantial morphological changes. Besides its importance for numerous developmental processes, EMT has also been held responsible for the development and progression of tumors and formation of metastases. The influence of the cytokine transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) induced EMT on structure, migration, cytoskeletal dynamics and long-term correlations of the mammalian epithelial cell lines NMuMG, A549 and MDA-MB231 was investigated with time-resolved impedance analysis. The three cell lines show important differences in concentration dependency, cellular morphology and dynamics upon their response to TGF-β1. A549 cells and the non-tumor mouse epithelial cell line NMuMG show a substantial change in morphology mirrored in stepwise changes of their phenotype upon cytokine treatment. Impedance based measurements of micromotility reveal a complex dynamic response to TGF-β1 exposure which leads to a transient increase in fluctuation amplitude and long-term correlation. These changes in fluctuation amplitude are also detectable for MDA-MB231 cells, whereas the long-term correlation remains unvaried. We were able to distinguish three time domains during EMT. Initially, all cell lines display an increase in micromotion lasting 4 to 9h termed transitional state I. This regime is followed by transitional state II lasting approximately 20h, where cellular dynamics are diminished and, in case of the NMuMG cell line, a loss of cell–cell contacts occurs. Finally, the transformation into the mesenchymal-like phenotype occurs 24–30h after exposure to TGF-β1.

Abstract: The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) plays an essential role in the survival and function of the neural retina. RPE uncontrolled proliferation leads to the development of proliferative ocular pathologies, among which proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) is the main cause of retinal surgery failure. Upon the breakdown of the BRB due to trauma or metabolic imbalance the contact of RPE with serum-contained thrombin has been shown to stimulate the proliferation of otherwise quiescent RPE cells. Although the molecular mechanisms involved in this effect are still undetermined, thrombin proteolytic activation of protease-activated G protein coupled receptor-1 (PAR-1) activates PI3K and Akt, known to play an essential role in proliferation. The present study demonstrates that: 1) thrombin stimulates Ser 473 Akt phosphorylation without affecting Thr 308 basal phosphorylation in RPE cells; 2) thrombin-induced Akt stimulation promotes cyclin D1 accumulation through the phosphorylation/ inhibition of GSK-3β, thus preventing Thr 286 cyclin D1 phosphorylation, nuclear export and degradation; 3) Akt signaling requires the upstream activation of PI3K and PLC. Since the pharmacological inhibition of these pathways or the silencing of cyclin expression prevent thrombin-induced RPE cell proliferation, these results contribute relevant evidence for establishing the mechanism involved in the development of proliferative eye diseases.

Inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase triggers apoptosis in prostate cancer cells via down-regulation of protein kinase C-epsilon,

Abstract: Previous studies have shown that human prostate cancer cells constitutively generate 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) metabolites from arachidonic acid, and inhibition of 5-LOX blocks production of 5-LOX metabolites and triggers apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. This apoptosis is prevented by exogenous metabolites of 5-LOX, suggesting an essential role of 5-LOX metabolites in the survival of prostate cancer cells. However, downstream signaling mechanisms which mediate the survival-promoting effects of 5-LOX metabolites in prostate cancer cells are still unknown. Recently, we reported that MK591, a specific inhibitor of 5-LOX activity, induces apoptosis in prostate cancer cells without inhibition of Akt, or ERK, two well-characterized regulators of pro-survival mechanisms, suggesting the existence of an Akt and ERK-independent survival mechanism in prostate cancer cells regulated by 5-LOX. Here, we report that 5-LOX inhibition-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells occurs via rapid inactivation of protein kinase C-epsilon (PKCε), and that exogenous 5-LOX metabolites prevent both 5-LOX inhibition-induced down-regulation of PKCε and induction of apoptosis. Interestingly, pre-treatment of prostate cancer cells with diazoxide (a chemical activator of PKCε), or KAE1-1 (a cell-permeable, octa-peptide specific activator of PKCε) prevents 5-LOX inhibition-induced apoptosis, which indicates that inhibition of 5-LOX triggers apoptosis in prostate cancer cells via down-regulation of PKCε. Altogether, these findings suggest that metabolism of arachidonic acid by 5-LOX activity promotes survival of prostate cancer cells via signaling through PKCε, a pro-survival serine/threonine kinase.

Abstract: Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is implicated in numerous pathological disorders, including cancer and mediates a broad range of biological responses by signaling through the type I and II TGF-β receptors. Internalization of these receptors via the clathrin-coated pits pathway facilitates SMAD-mediated signaling, whereas internalization via the caveolae pathway is associated with receptor degradation. Thus, molecules that modulate receptor endocytosis are likely to play a critical role in regulating TGF-β action. We previously identified CD109, a GPI-anchored protein, as a TGF-β co-receptor and a negative regulator of TGF-β signaling. Here, we demonstrate that CD109 associates with caveolin-1, a major component of the caveolae. Moreover, CD109 increases binding of TGF-β to its receptors and enhances their internalization via the caveolae. In addition, CD109 promotes localization of the TGF-β receptors into the caveolar compartment in the presence of ligand and facilitates TGF-β-receptor degradation. Thus, CD109 regulates TGF-β receptor endocytosis and degradation to inhibit TGF-β signaling.

Abstract: TRIM8 is a member of a protein family defined by the presence of a common domain structure composed of a tripartite motif including a RING-finger, one or two B-box domains and a coiled-coil motif. Here, we show that TRIM8 interacts with Hsp90β, which interacts with STAT3 and selectively downregulates transcription of Nanog in embryonic stem cells. Knock-down of TRIM8 increased phosphorylated STAT3 in the nucleus and also enhanced transcription of Nanog. These findings suggest that TRIM8 modulates translocation of phosphorylated STAT3 into the nucleus through interaction with Hsp90β and consequently regulates transcription of Nanog in embryonic stem cells.

Arginine vasopressin controls p27Kip1 protein expression by PKC activation and irreversibly inhibits the proliferation of K-Ras-dependent mouse Y1 adrenocortical malignant cells,

Abstract: The neurohypophyseal hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) is a classic mitogen in many cells. In K-Ras-dependent mouse Y1 adrenocortical malignant cells, AVP elicits antagonistic responses such as the activation of the PKC and the ERK1/2 mitogenic pathways to down-regulate cyclin D1 gene expression, which induces senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-βGal) and leads to cell cycle arrest. Here, we report that in the metabolic background of Y1 cells, PKC activation either by AVP or by PMA inhibits the PI3K/Akt pathway and stabilises the p27Kip1 protein even in the presence of the mitogen fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2). These results suggest that p27Kip1 is a critical signalling node in the mechanisms underlying the survival of the Y1 cells. In Y1 cells that transiently express wild-type p27Kip1, AVP caused a severe reduction in cell survival, as shown by clonogenic assays. However, AVP promoted the survival of Y1 cells transiently expressing mutant p27-S10A or mutant p27-T187A, which cannot be phosphorylated at Ser10 and Thr187, respectively. In addition, PKC activation by PMA mimics the toxic effect caused by AVP in Y1 cells, and inhibition of PKC completely abolishes the effects caused by both PMA and AVP in clonogenic assays. The vulnerability of Y1 cells during PKC activation is a phenotype conditioned upon K-ras oncogene amplification because K-Ras down-regulation with an inducible form of the dominant-negative mutant H-RasN17 has resulted in Y1 cells that are resistant to AVP's deleterious effects. These data show that the survival destabilisation of K-Ras-dependent Y1 malignant cells by AVP requires large quantities of the p27Kip1 protein as well as phosphorylation of the p27Kip1 protein at both Ser10 and Thr187.

Abstract: Our previous studies have shown that camptothecin and doxorubicin triggered ceramide accumulation via de novo synthesis pathway. De novo ceramide generation was responsible for the drug-induced apoptosis through a caspase-3-dependent pathway and a decrease of thrombospondin-1 expression in human thyroid carcinoma FTC-133 cells. Here, we demonstrate that Jun N-terminal kinases play a critical role in camptothecin- and doxorubicin-induced down-regulation of thrombospondin-1 expression: i) de novo ceramide synthesis pathway activates Jun N-terminal kinase 1/2 resulting in activating transcription factor 2 phosphorylation; ii) cell treatment by SP600125, a Jun N-terminal kinase specific inhibitor, strongly reduced activating transcription factor 2 phosphorylation and completely abolished camptothecin and doxorubicin effects; and iii) activating transcription factor 2 expression silencing greatly attenuated camptothecin- and doxorubicin-induced down-regulation of thrombospondin-1 expression and apoptosis. The set of our data established that camptothecin- and doxorubicin-induced activation of Jun N-terminal kinase/activating transcription factor 2 pathway via de novo ceramide synthesis down-regulates thrombospondin-1 expression and apoptosis in human thyroid carcinoma FTC-133 cells.

Abstract: RIN proteins serve as guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Rab5a. They are characterized by the presence of a RIN homology domain and a C-terminal Vps9 domain. Currently three family members have been described and analyzed. Here we report the identification of a novel RIN family member, Rin-like (Rinl), that represents a new interaction partner of the receptor tyrosine kinase MuSK, which is an essential key regulator of neuromuscular synapse development. Rinl is localized to neuromuscular synapses but shows the highest expression in thymus and spleen. Rinl preferentially binds to nucleotide-free Rab5a and catalyzes the exchange of GDP for GTP. Moreover, Rinl also binds GDP-bound Rab22 and increases the GDP/GTP exchange implicating Rinl in endocytotic processes regulated by Rab5a and Rab22. Interestingly, Rinl shows a higher catalytic rate for Rab22 compared to Rab5a. Rinl is closely associated with the cytoskeleton and thus contributes to the spatial control of Rab5a and Rab22 signaling at actin-positive compartments. Most importantly, overexpression of Rinl affects fluid-phase as well as EGFR endocytosis.

Abstract: The yeast cytochrome bc1 complex, a component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, is composed of ten distinct protein subunits. In the assembly of the bc1 complex, some ancillary proteins, such as the chaperone Bcs1p, are actively involved. The deletion of the nuclear gene encoding this chaperone caused the arrest of the bc1 assembly and the formation of a functionally inactive bc1 core structure of about 500-kDa. This immature bc1 core structure could represent, on the one hand, a true assembly intermediate or, on the other hand, a degradation product and/or an incorrect product of assembly. The experiments here reported show that the gradual expression of Bcs1p in the yeast strain lacking this protein was progressively able to rescue the bc1 core structure leading to the formation of the functional homodimeric bc1 complex. Following Bcs1p expression, the mature bc1 complex was also progressively converted into two supercomplexes with the cytochrome c oxidase complex. The capability of restoring the bc1 complex and the supercomplexes was also possessed by the mutated yeast R81C Bcsp1. Notably, in the human ortholog BCS1L, the corresponding point mutation (R45C) was instead the cause of a severe bc1 complex deficiency. Differently from the yeast R81C Bcs1p, two other mutated Bcs1p's (K192P and F401I) were unable to recover the bc1 core structure in yeast. This study identifies for the first time a productive assembly intermediate of the yeast bc1 complex and gives new insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in the last steps of bc1 assembly.

Abstract: Recent data suggest that the adhesion docking protein NEDD9/HEF1/Cas-L is a critical regulator of adhesion-dependent signalling pathways during mammary tumour development. Multiple phosphorylation modifications of NEDD9 regulate interaction with downstream protein partners, thus the regulation of NEDD9 phospho-forms is an important point of control for NEDD9 function. As estradiol (E2) plays a central role in the development and progression of breast cancer, we have investigated NEDD9 phospho-form regulation in MCF-7 estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cells in response to estrogen. We find that levels of the 105-kDa NEDD9 phospho-form are significantly increased after 3days of estrogen exposure, and this is suppressed by the anti-estrogen tamoxifen. Analysis of protein decay kinetics following treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide indicates that increased 105-kDa levels are due to a slower rate of protein decay. Moreover, exogenous expression of NEDD9 failed to induce spreading in the presence of E2, and this was reversed by tamoxifen treatment. Finally, we show that the 105-kDa NEDD9 phospho-form appears to predominate in ER-positive versus ER-negative breast cancer cell lines. Taken together, our results suggest that estradiol may suppress phospho-form-specific functions of NEDD9.

Abstract: Yeast metacaspase (Yca1p) is required for the execution of apoptosis upon a wide range of stimuli. However, the specific degradome of this yeast protease has not been unraveled so far. By combining different methodologies described as requisites for a protein to be considered a protease substrate, such as digestome analysis, cleavage of recombinant GAPDH by metacaspase and evaluation of protein levels in vivo, we show that upon H2O2-induced apoptosis, the metabolic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is a specific target of metacaspase. Nitric oxide (NO) signaling, which mediates H2O2-induced apoptosis, is required for metacaspase specific GAPDH cleavage. In conclusion, in this work we identified GAPDH as the first direct yeast metacaspase substrate described so far. Although mammalian caspases and yeast metacaspase apparently have distinct target cleavage sites, GAPDH arises as a common substrate for these proteases.

Abstract: Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and nitric oxide (NO) involve many pathophysiologic conditions. The expression of iNOS is regulated at multiple stages. Presently, the regulatory details of iNOS signaling are still unclear. This study aimed to investigate the regulatory role of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ in iNOS signaling pathway. By employing the techniques such as EMSA, ChIP assay, site-directed mutagenesis, and siRNA silencing, the relationship between iNOS and C/EBPα/C/EBPβ in rat hepatocytes was clarified. iNOS promoter was the direct transcriptional targets of the C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and NF-κB binding proteins. There was the interactive influence between NF-κB and C/EBPα/C/EBPβ. The expression of iNOS was modulated by C/EBPα/C/EBPβ transcription factors. Moreover, the iNOS expression mediated glycochenodeoxycholate (GCDC)-induced apoptosis in hepatocytes. C/EBPα/C/EBPβ binding proteins could affect the GCDC-induced apoptosis through iNOS cascade. These findings indicate that C/EBPα and C/EBPβ regulate the iNOS expression, which may further modify cell responses such as apoptosis and cell survival.

Abstract: Breast cancer is a leading cause of morbidity in women worldwide. neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), a useful biomarker of ER negative (ER−) breast cancer, promotes local tumor invasion and lymph node metastasis. We first identified the distinctive expression of NGAL in two breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, and then confirmed NGAL as a critical inducer of metastasis. Finally, the transcriptional factor CCAAT enhancer-binding proteins ζ (C/EBP ζ) was overexpressed in MDA-MB-231 cells. Consistent with the effect of NGAL knockdown, C/EBP ζ overexpression caused the significant changes that could prevent cell metastasis. C/EBP ζ overexpression induced a strong decrease in NGAL and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) expressions as determined by quantitative real time PCR and Western blotting. To identify the potential role of C/EBP ζ on regulating of NGAL in breast cancer, we established the dual-luciferase reporter assay for NGAL in MDA-MB-231 cells cotransfected with C/EBP ζ. Promoter reporter assays determined that C/EBP ζ directly repressed the human NGAL gene promoter activity by inhibiting the NGAL transcription. Taken together, this work identified that the C/EBP ζ overexpression downregulated NGAL to inhibit migration and invasion of breast cancer, which could be used as a novel strategy for breast cancer therapy.

Abstract: Diabetic nephropathy is one of the main causes of end-stage renal disease, in which the development of tubular damage depends on factors such as high glucose levels, albuminuria and advanced glycation end-product. In this study, we analyzed the involvement of heparanase, a heparan sulfate glycosidase, in the homeostasis of proximal tubular epithelial cells in the diabetic milieu. In vitro studies were performed on a wild-type and stably heparanase-silenced adult tubular line (HK2) and HEK293. Gene and protein expression analyses were performed in the presence and absence of diabetic mediators. Albumin and advanced glycation end-product, but not high glucose levels, increased heparanase expression in adult tubular cells via the AKT/PI3K signaling pathway. This over-expression of heparanase is then responsible for heparan sulfate reduction via its endoglycosidase activity and its capacity to regulate the heparan sulfate-proteoglycans core protein. In fact, heparanase regulates the gene expression of syndecan-1, the most abundant heparan sulfate-proteoglycans in tubular cells. We showed that heparanase is a target gene of the diabetic nephropathy mediators albumin and advanced glycation end-product, so it may be relevant to the progression of diabetic nephropathy. It could take part in several processes, e.g. extracellular-matrix remodeling and cell–cell crosstalk, via its heparan sulfate endoglycosidase activity and capacity to regulate the expression of the heparan sulfate-proteoglycan syndecan-1.

Abstract: Aldosterone is now recognised as an important actor in inflammation processes. Neoangiogenesis plays a crucial role in this complex process and immune cells, such as neutrophils, appear to be able to secrete different forms of (pro)angiogenic molecules, especially VEGF-A. The present work was undertaken to investigate whether aldosterone was able to regulate VEGF-A production in human neutrophils. The HL-60 (progranulocytic) cell line and human polymorphonuclear leukocytes were incubated for different time periods with aldosterone. Total cellular RNA extraction, submitted to reverse transcription and real time semi-quantitative PCR, was used to study VEGF-A mRNA expression. Cell supernatants were collected and ELISA tests were performed to analyse VEGF-A protein production. Aldosterone increased VEGF-A mRNA and protein expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner in both cell types. Inhibitors of PI3 kinases, ERK1/2, and to a lesser extent of p38 MAPK, decreased this aldosterone-induced immune cell activation. Western-blot performed with HL-60 cells confirmed that ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways were stimulated by aldosterone. Mineralocorticoid receptors are implicated in this VEGF-A up-regulation because HL-60 cells pre-treated with spironolactone, an aldosterone receptor antagonist, diminished the effects of aldosterone. Aldosterone was also able to increase VEGF-A production of phagocytic cells such as neutrophils. These results suggest that this hormone could play an active role in the neovascularisation process by favouring entry of plasma proteins and fluids into the vascular wall, cell proliferation and tissue rebuilding.

One main site of action of glucocorticoids is the hepatocyte, which responds to the hormonal stimulus with induction of several proteins among them enzymes of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), both nuclearly and mitochondrially encoded. The induction of OXPHOS is regarded as a result of a nuclear action of the receptor on the respective nuclear genes and on genes encoding mitochondrial transcription factors. The presence of GR in mitochondria and of sequences in the mitochondrial genome similar to glucocorticoid responsive elements, suggested a direct action of GR on mitochondrial transcription. We demonstrate in HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells specific binding of GR to the regulatory D-loop region of the mitochondrial genome and show that dexamethasone induces the mitochondrial transcription factors A, B1, and B2, the mitochondrial ribosomal RNA, and several mitochondrially encoded OXPHOS genes. Applying α-amanitin, the specific inhibitor of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II, the dexamethasone-induced transcription of the mitochondrial genes can still proceeds, whereas the DEX effect on transcription of the mitochondrial transcription factors is suppressed. Moreover, HepG2 cells overexpressing mitochondrial targeted GR showed increased RNA synthesis, cytrochrome oxidase subunit I protein expression, and mitochondrial ATP production. We conclude that glucocorticoids can stimulate directly mitochondrial transcription by the mitochondrially localized GR, affecting OXPHOS enzyme biosynthesis. This takes place in addition to their action on mitochondrial genes by way of induction of the nuclearly encoded mitochondrial transcription factors.

Abstract: Calmyrin1 (CaMy1) is an EF-hand Ca2+-binding protein expressed in several cell types, including brain neurons. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human fetal brain cDNA library, we identified SCG10 protein (stathmin2) as a CaMy1 partner. SCG10 is a microtubule-destabilizing factor involved in neuronal growth during brain development. We found increased mRNA and protein levels of CaMy1 during neuronal development, which paralleled the changes in SCG10 levels. In developing primary rat hippocampal neurons in culture, CaMy1 and SCG10 colocalized in cell soma, neurites, and growth cones. Pull-down, coimmunoprecipitation, and proximity ligation assays demonstrated that the interaction between CaMy1 and SCG10 is direct and Ca2+-dependent in vivo and requires the C-terminal domain of CaMy1 (residues 99–192) and the N-terminal domain of SCG10 (residues 1–35). CaMy1 did not interact with stathmin1, a protein that is homologous with SCG10 but lacks the N-terminal domain characteristic of SCG10. CaMy1 interfered with SCG10 inhibitory activity in a microtubule polymerization assay. Moreover, CaMy1 overexpression inhibited SCG10-mediated neurite outgrowth in nerve growth factor (NGF)-stimulated PC12 cells. This CaMy1 activity did not occur when an N-terminally truncated SCG10 mutant unable to interact with CaMy1 was expressed. Altogether, these data suggest that CaMy1 via SCG10 couples Ca2+ signals with the dynamics of microtubules during neuronal outgrowth in the developing brain.

Abstract: Ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) is an autosomal recessive genetic disease characterized by immunological deficiencies, neurological degeneration, developmental abnormalities and an increased risk of cancer. Ataxia-telangiectasia group D (ATDC) was initially described as a gene related to AT. Ataxia-telangiectasia group D, also known as TRIM29, is structurally a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family of proteins, some of which have been reported to be highly expressed in some human carcinomas, but the involvement of TRIM29 in carcinogenesis has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we found by using yeast two-hybrid screening that TRIM29 binds to Tip60, which has been reported as a cellular acetyltransferase protein. Overexpression of TRIM29 promoted degradation and changed localization of Tip60 and reduced acetylation of p53 at lysine 120 by Tip60, resulting in enhancement of cell growth and transforming activity. In addition, we found that TRIM29 suppresses apoptosis induced by UV irradiation in HCT116 cell lines. These findings suggest that TRIM29 functions as an oncogene that promotes tumor growth.

Abstract: Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression and catalytic status in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is debatable, while its sub-cellular distribution remains unascertained. The present study characterizes NOS transcripts by real time PCR, NOS protein by immunoprecipitation (IP)/Western blot (WB), nitric oxide (NO) generation by DAF-2DA and NOS sub-cellular distribution by immunogold electron microscopy in resting PBMCs, monocytes and lymphocytes obtained from healthy donors. We observed constitutive expression of full length NOS isoforms (nNOS, iNOS and eNOS) in PBMCs: with the highest expression of iNOS in comparison to nNOS and eNOS. Isolated monocytes expressed more eNOS transcript and protein as compared to nNOS and iNOS. Lymphocytes however had more iNOS transcripts and protein than nNOS and eNOS. NOS was catalytically active in PBMCs, monocytes as well as in lymphocytes as evident by NO generation in the presence of substrate and cofactors, which was significantly reduced in the presence of NOS inhibitor. Immunogold electron microscopy and morphometric analysis revealed the distinct pattern of NOS distribution in monocytes and lymphocytes and also exhibited differences in the nuclear–cytoplasmic ratio. nNOS localization was much more in the cytosol than in the nucleus among both monocytes and lymphocytes. Interestingly, iNOS distribution was comparable in both cytosol and nucleus among monocytes, but in lymphocytes iNOS was predominantly localized to the cytosol. The present study exhibits constitutive presence of all the NOS isoforms in PBMCs and reports the distinct pattern of NOS distribution among monocytes and lymphocytes.

Abstract: The ubiquitous sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum (SR/ER) Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA2b) and secretory-pathway Ca2+ ATPase (SPCA1a) belong both to the P2A-type ATPase subgroup of Ca2+ transporters and play a crucial role in the Ca2+ homeostasis of respectively the ER and Golgi apparatus. They are ubiquitously expressed, but their low abundance precludes purification for crystallization. We have developed a new strategy for purification of recombinant hSERCA2b and hSPCA1a that is based on overexpression in yeast followed by a two-step affinity chromatography method biasing towards properly folded protein. In a first step, these proteins were purified with the aid of an analogue of the SERCA inhibitor thapsigargin (Tg) coupled to a matrix. Wild-type (WT) hSERCA2b bound efficiently to the gel, but its elution was hampered by the high affinity of SERCA2b for Tg. Therefore, a mutant was generated carrying minor modifications in the Tg-binding site showing a lower affinity for Tg. In a second step, reactive dye chromatography was performed to further purify and concentrate the properly folded pumps and to exchange the detergent to one more suitable for crystallization. A similar strategy was successfully applied to purify WT SPCA1a. This study shows that it is possible to purify functionally active intracellular Ca2+ ATPases using successive thapsigargin and reactive dye affinity chromatography for future structural studies.

Abstract: Mammalian antral oocytes with a Hoescht-positive DNA ring around the nucleolus (SN) are able to resume meiosis and to fully support the embryonic development, while oocytes with a non-surrounded nucleolus (NSN) cannot. Here, we applied FTIR microspectroscopy to characterize single SN and NSN mouse oocytes in order to try to elucidate some aspects of the mechanisms behind the different chromatin organization that impairs the full development of NSN oocyte-derived embryos. To this aim, oocytes were measured at three different stages of their maturation: just after isolation and classification as SN and NSN oocytes (time 0); after 10h of in vitro maturation, i.e. at the completion of the metaphase I (time 1); and after 20h of in vitro maturation, i.e. at the completion of the metaphase II (time 2). Significant spectral differences in the lipid (3050–2800cm−1) and protein (1700–1600cm−1) absorption regions were found between the two types of oocytes and among the different stages of maturation within the same oocyte type. Moreover, dramatic changes in nucleic acid content, concerning mainly the extent of transcription and polyadenylation, were detected in particular between 1000 and 800cm−1. The use of the multivariate principal component–linear discriminant analysis (PCA–LDA) enabled us to identify the maturation stage in which the separation between the two types of oocytes took place, finding as the most discriminating wavenumbers those associated to transcriptional activity and polyadenylation, in agreement with the visual analysis of the spectral data.

Abstract: The human Usher syndrome (USH) is the most frequent cause of combined hereditary deaf-blindness. USH is genetically heterogeneous with at least 11 chromosomal loci assigned to 3 clinical types, USH1-3. We have previously demonstrated that all USH1 and 2 proteins in the eye and the inner ear are organized into protein networks by scaffold proteins. This has contributed essentially to our current understanding of the function of USH proteins and explains why defects in proteins of different families cause very similar phenotypes. We have previously shown that the USH1G protein SANS (scaffold protein containing ankyrin repeats and SAM domain) contributes to the periciliary protein network in retinal photoreceptor cells. This study aimed to further elucidate the role of SANS by identifying novel interaction partners. In yeast two-hybrid screens of retinal cDNA libraries we identified 30 novel putative interacting proteins binding to the central domain of SANS (CENT). We confirmed the direct binding of the phosphodiesterase 4D interacting protein (PDE4DIP), a Golgi associated protein synonymously named myomegalin, to the CENT domain of SANS by independent assays. Correlative immunohistochemical and electron microscopic analyses showed a co-localization of SANS and myomegalin in mammalian photoreceptor cells in close association with microtubules. Based on the present results we propose a role of the SANS-myomegalin complex in microtubule-dependent inner segment cargo transport towards the ciliary base of photoreceptor cells.

Abstract: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases, has defined roles in neoplastic transformation and tumor progression. Overexpression of HER2 is an adverse prognostic factor in several human neoplasms and, particularly in breast cancer, correlates strongly with a decrease in overall patient survival. HER2 stimulates breast tumorigenesis by forming protein–protein interactions with a diverse array of intracellular signaling molecules, and evidence suggests that manipulation of these associations holds therapeutic potential. To modulate specific HER2 interactions, the region(s) of HER2 to which each target binds must be accurately identified. Calmodulin (CaM), a ubiquitously expressed Ca2+ binding protein, interacts with multiple intracellular targets. Interestingly, CaM binds the juxtamembrane region of the epidermal growth factor receptor, a HER2 homolog. Here, we show that CaM interacts, in a Ca2+-regulated manner, with two distinct sites on the N-terminal portion of the HER2 intracellular domain. Deletion of residues 676–689 and 714–732 from HER2 prevented CaM–HER2 binding. Inhibition of CaM function or deletion of the CaM binding sites from HER2 significantly decreased both HER2 phosphorylation and HER2-stimulated cell growth. Collectively, these data suggest that inhibition of CaM–HER2 interaction may represent a rational therapeutic strategy for the treatment of patients with breast cancer.

Abstract: Delta ligands are important for regulating Notch signaling through transcellular stimulation of Notch receptors. The cytoplasmic tails of Delta ligands have multiple potential regulatory sites including several lysine residues that are putative targets for ubiquitination by the E3 ubiquitin ligases, Mind Bomb and Neuralized. To identify possible roles for specific lysine residues in the cytoplasmic tail of the Notch ligand Dll1 a mutational and functional analysis was performed. Examination of a panel of individual or clustered lysine mutants demonstrated that lysine 613 (K613) in the cytoplasmic tail of Dll1 is a key residue necessary for transcellular activation of Notch signaling. Multi-ubiquitination of the Dll1 mutant Dll1-K613R was altered compared to wild type Dll1, and the K613R mutation blocked the ability of Dll1 to interact with Notch1. Finally, mutation of K613 did not affect the stability of Dll1 or its ability to traffic to recycle to the plasma membrane, but did enhance the fraction associated with lipid rafts. Collectively these results suggest that the transcellular defect in Notch signaling attributed to residue K613 in cytoplasmic tail of Dll1 may result from altering its multi-ubiquitination and increasing its retention in lipid rafts.

Abstract: Background
A novel family of intracellular Ca2+-release channels termed two-pore channels (TPCs) has been presented as the receptors of NAADP (nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate), the most potent Ca2+ mobilizing intracellular messenger. TPCs have been shown to be exclusively localized to the endolysosomal system mediating NAADP-evoked Ca2+ release from the acidic compartments.
Objectives
The present study is aimed to investigate NAADP-mediated Ca2+ release from intracellular stores in the megakaryoblastic cell line MEG01.
Methods
Changes in cytosolic and intraluminal free Ca2+ concentrations were registered by fluorimetry using fura-2 and fura-ff, respectively; TPC expression was detected by PCR.
Results
Treatment of MEG01 cells with the H+/K+ ionophore nigericin or the V-type H+-ATPase selective inhibitor bafilomycin A1 revealed the presence of acidic Ca2+ stores in these cells, sensitive to the SERCA inhibitor 2,5-di-(tert-butyl)-1,4-hydroquinone (TBHQ). NAADP releases Ca2+ from acidic lysosomal-like Ca2+ stores in MEG01 cells probably mediated by the activation of TPC1 and TPC2 as demonstrated by TPC1 and TPC2 expression silencing and overexpression. Ca2+ efflux from the acidic lysosomal-like Ca2+ stores or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) results in ryanodine-sensitive activation of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) from the complementary Ca2+ compartment.
Conclusion
Our results show for the first time NAADP-evoked Ca2+ release from acidic compartments through the activation of TPC1 and TPC2, and CICR, in a megakaryoblastic cell line.

Abstract: The focus of this research was to investigate the role of protein kinase C-iota (PKC-ι) in regulation of Bad, a pro-apoptotic BH3-only molecule of the Bcl-2 family in glioblastoma. Robust expression of PKC-ι is a hallmark of human glioma and benign and malignant meningiomas. The results were obtained from the two human glial tumor derived cell lines, T98G and U87MG. In these cells, PKC-ι co-localized and directly associated with Bad, as shown by immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, and Western blotting. Furthermore, in-vitro kinase activity assay showed that PKC-ι directly phosphorylated Bad at phospho specific residues, Ser-112, Ser-136 and Ser-155 which in turn induced inactivation of Bad and disruption of Bad/Bcl-XL dimer. Knockdown of PKC-ι by siRNA exhibited a corresponding reduction in Bad phosphorylation suggesting that PKC-ι may be a Bad kinase. PKC-ι knockdown also induced apoptosis in both the cell lines. Since, PKC-ι is an essential downstream mediator of the PI (3)-kinase, we hypothesize that glioma cell survival is mediated via a PI (3)-kinase/PDK1/PKC-ι/Bad pathway. Treatment with PI (3)-kinase inhibitors Wortmannin and LY294002, as well as PDK1 siRNA, inhibited PKC-ι activity and subsequent phosphorylation of Bad suggesting that PKC-ι regulates the activity of Bad in a PI (3)-kinase dependent manner. Thus, our data suggest that glioma cell survival occurs through a novel PI (3)-kinase/PDK1/PKC-ι/BAD mediated pathway.

Abstract: The binding of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) to macrophages results in inflammatory responses. In extreme cases it can lead to endotoxic shock, often resulting in death. A broad range of antioxidants, including tocopherols, can reduce LPS activity in vitro and in vivo. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of their action, we investigated the effect of the sodium salt of γ-L-glutamyl-S-[2-[[[3,4-dihydro-2,5,7,8-tetramethyl-2-(4,8,12-trimethyltridecyl)-2H-1-benzopyran-6-yl]oxy]carbonyl]-3-[[2-(1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl]amino]-3-oxopropyl]-L-cysteinylglycine (ESeroS-GS), a novel α-tocopherol derivative, on LPS-induced inflammation in vitro and in vivo. ESeroS-GS reduced the transcription of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and iNOS genes in a dose-dependent manner in RAW264.7 macrophages, and inhibited the release of these inflammatory factors. In addition, ESeroS-GS inhibited LPS-induced mortality in a mouse sepsis model. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and reporter gene assays revealed that ESeroS-GS down-regulated the transcriptional activity of NF-κB. By analyzing the partitioning of CD14 and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) in cell membrane microdomains, we found that ESeroS-GS attenuates the binding of LPS to RAW264.7 cells via interfering with the relocation of CD14 and TLR-4 to lipid rafts, blocking the activation of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK-1), and inhibiting the consequent phosphorylation of TAK1 and IKKα/β, which together account for the suppression of NF-κB activation. Taken together, our data suggest that ESeroS-GS can modulate LPS signaling in macrophages by impairing TLR-4 complex assembly via a lipid raft dependent mechanism.

Abstract: Pro-inflammatory cytokine-mediated beta cell apoptosis is activated through multiple signaling pathways involving mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. Activation of organelle-specific caspases has been implicated in the progression and execution of cell death. This study was therefore performed to elucidate the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines on a possible cross-talk between the compartment-specific caspases 9 and 12 and their differential contribution to beta cell apoptosis. Moreover, the occurrence of ROS-mediated mitochondrial damage in response to beta cell toxic cytokines has been quantified. ER-specific caspase-12 was strongly activated in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines; however, its inhibition did not abolish cytokine-induced mitochondrial caspase-9 activation and loss of cell viability. In addition, there was a significant induction of oxidative mitochondrial DNA damage and elevated cardiolipin peroxidation in insulin-producing RINm5F cells and rat islet cells. Overexpression of the H2O2 detoxifying enzyme catalase effectively reduced the observed cytokine-induced oxidative damage of mitochondrial structures. Taken together, the results strongly indicate that mitochondrial caspase-9 is not a downstream substrate of ER-specific caspase-12 and that pro-inflammatory cytokines cause apoptotic beta cell death through activation of caspase-9 primarily by hydroxyl radical-mediated mitochondrial damage.

Abstract: Adiponectin is an abundantly circulating adipokine, orchestrating its effects through two 7-transmembrane receptors (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2). Steroidogenesis is regulated by a variety of neuropeptides and adipokines. Earlier studies have reported adipokine mediated steroid production. A key rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis is cholesterol transportation across the mitochondrial membrane by steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR). Several signalling pathways regulate StAR expression. The actions of adiponectin and its role in human adrenocortical steroid biosynthesis are not fully understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of adiponectin on StAR protein expression, steroidogenic genes, and cortisol production and to dissect the signalling cascades involved in the activation of StAR expression. Using qRT-PCR, Western blot analysis and ELISA, we have demonstrated that stimulation of human adrenocortical H295R cells with adiponectin results in increased cortisol secretion. This effect is accompanied by increased expression of key steroidogenic pathway genes including StAR protein expression via ERK1/2 and AMPK-dependent pathways. This has implications for our understanding of adiponectin receptor activation and peripheral steroidogenesis. Finally, our study aims to emphasise the key role of adipokines in the integration of metabolic activity and energy balance partly via the regulation of adrenal steroid production.

Abstract: Metastatic cells switch between different modes of migration through supramolecular plasticity mechanism(s) still largely unknown. The aim of the present paper was to clarify some molecular aspects of the epigenetic control of migration of 1833-bone metastatic cells compared to MDA-MB231-parental mammary carcinoma cells. Active c-Src overexpression enhanced 1833-cell spontaneous migration and CXCR4-mediated chemoinvasion toward CXCL12 ligand. Only in metastatic cells, in fact, c-Src seemed to stabilize nuclear CXCR4-protein receptor possibly due to tyrosine phosphorylation, by impairing protein-degradative smear and causing instead an electrophoretic-mobility shift; the cytosolic steady-state level of CXCR4 was enhanced, and the protein appeared also phosphorylated. These findings suggested the triggering of unique signaling pathways in metastasis for homing of breast-cancer cells to congenial environment of specific organs. Microenvironmental stimuli activating c-Src might influence Ets1 binding to CXCR4 promoter and consequent transactivation, as well as CXCR4 post-translational regulatory mechanisms such as phosphorylation. Enhancement of Ets1 activity and CXCR4 induction by c-Src overexpression were prevented by histone deacetylase (HDAC) blockade. In contrast, HDAC inhibition with trichostatin A increased cytosolic phosphorylated CXCR4 expression in MDA-MB231 cells, but Ets1 involvement was practically unneeded. c-Src might be suggested as a bio-marker predicting metastasis sensitivity patterns to HDAC inhibitors. Rationally designed and individualized therapy may become possible as more is learned about the target molecules of HDAC's inhibitory agents and their roles, as undertaken for CXCR4 that is likely to be crucial for homing, angiogenesis and survival in a c-Src-dependent manner in bone-metastatic mammary cells.

Abstract: Decreasing the temperature to 30°C is accompanied by significant enhancement of α2C-AR plasma membrane levels in several cell lines with fibroblast phenotype, as demonstrated by radioligand binding in intact cells. No changes were observed on the effects of low-temperature after blocking receptor internalization in α2C-AR transfected HEK293T cells. In contrast, two pharmacological chaperones, dimethyl sulfoxide and glycerol, increased the cell surface receptor levels at 37°C, but not at 30°C. Further, at 37°C α2C-AR is co-localized with endoplasmic reticulum markers, but not with the lysosomal markers. Treatment with three distinct HSP90 inhibitors, radicicol, macbecin and 17-DMAG significantly enhanced α2C-AR cell surface levels at 37°C, but these inhibitors had no effect at 30°C. Similar results were obtained after decreasing the HSP90 cellular levels using specific siRNA. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that α2C-AR interacts with HSP90 and this interaction is decreased at 30°C. The contractile response to endogenous α2C-AR stimulation in rat tail artery was also enhanced at reduced temperature. Similar to HEK293T cells, HSP90 inhibition increased the α2C-AR contractile effects only at 37°C. Moreover, exposure to low-temperature of vascular smooth muscle cells from rat tail artery decreased the cellular levels of HSP90, but did not change HSP70 levels. These data demonstrate that exposure to low-temperature augments the α2C-AR transport to the plasma membrane by releasing the inhibitory activity of HSP90 on the receptor traffic, findings which may have clinical relevance for the diagnostic and treatment of Raynaud Phenomenon.

Abstract: The majority of known nuclear proteins are highly mobile. The molecular mechanisms by which they accumulate inside stable compartments that are not separated from the nucleoplasm by membranes are obscure. The compartmental retention of some proteins is associated with their biological function; however, some protein interactions within distinct nuclear structures may be non-specific. The non-specific retention may lead to the accumulation of proteins in distinct structural domains, even if the protein does not function inside this domain. In this study, we have shown that histone H2B-EGFP initially accumulated in the nucleolus after ectopic expression, and then gradually incorporated into the chromatin to leave only a small amount of nucleolus-bound histone that was revealed by removing chromatin-bound proteins with DNase I treatment. Nucleolar histone H2B had several characteristics: (i) it preferentially bound to granular component of the nucleolus and interacted with RNA or RNA-containing nucleolar components; (ii) it freely exchanged between the nucleolus and nucleoplasm; (iii) it associated with the nuclear matrix; and (iv) it bound to interphase prenuclear bodies that formed after hypotonic treatment. The region in histone H2B that acts as a nucleolar localization/retention signal (NoRS) was identified. This signal overlapped with a nuclear localization signal (NLS), which appears to be the primary function of this region. The NoRS activity of this region was non-specific, but the molecular mechanism was probably similar to the NoRSs of other nucleolar proteins. All known NoRSs are enriched with basic amino acids, and we demonstrated that positively charged motifs (nona-arginine (R9) and nona-lysine (K9)) were sufficient for the nucleolar accumulation of EGFP. Also, the correlation between measured NoRS activity and the predicted charge was observed. Thus, NoRSs appear to achieve their function through electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged components of the nucleolus. Though these interactions are non-specific, the functionally unrelated retention of a protein can increase the probability of its interaction with specific and functionally related binding sites.

Abstract: Human malignant glioblastomas are highly invasive tumors. Increased cell motility and degradation of the surrounding extracellular matrix are essential for tumor invasion. PI3K/Akt signaling pathway emerges as a common pathway regulating cellular proliferation, migration and invasion; however, its contribution to particular process and downstream cascades remain poorly defined. We have previously demonstrated that Cyclosporin A (CsA) affects glioblastoma invasion in organotypic brain slices and tumorigenicity in mice. Here we show that CsA impairs migration and invasion of human glioblastoma cells by downregulation of Akt phosphorylation. Interference with PI-3K/Akt signaling was crucial for CsA effect on invasion, because overexpression of constitutively active myr-Akt antagonized drug action. Furthermore, the drug was not effective in T98G glioblastoma cells with constitutively high level of phosphorylated Akt. CsA, comparably to pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K/Akt signaling (LY294002, A443654), reduced motility of glioblastoma cells, diminished MMP-2 gelatinolytic activity and MMP-2 and MT1-MMP expression. The latter effect was mimicked by overexpression of dominant negative Akt mutants. We demonstrate that CsA and LY294002 reduced MMP transcription partly via modulation of IκB phosphorylation and NFκB transcriptional activity. Those effects were not mediated by inhibition of calcineurin, a classical CsA target. Additionally, CsA reduced phosphorylation and activity of focal adhesion kinase that was associated with rapid morphological alterations, rearrangement of lamellipodia and impairment of MT1-MMP translocation to membrane protrusions. Our results document novel, Akt-dependent mechanisms of interference with motility/invasion of human glioblastoma cells: through a rapid modulation of cell adhesion and MT1-MMP translocation to membrane protrusions and delayed, partly NFκB-dependent, downregulation of MMP-2 and MT1-MMP expression.

Abstract: The mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channel (mKATP) is important in the protective mechanism of ischemic preconditioning (IPC). The channel is reportedly sensitive to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and the aim of this study was to compare such species in parallel, to build a more comprehensive picture of mKATP regulation. mKATP activity was measured by both osmotic swelling and Tl+ flux assays, in isolated rat heart mitochondria. An isolated adult rat cardiomyocyte model of ischemia–reperfusion (IR) injury was also used to determine the role of mKATP in cardioprotection by nitroxyl. Key findings were as follows: (i) mKATP was activated by O2− and H2O2 but not other peroxides. (ii) mKATP was inhibited by NADPH. (iii) mKATP was activated by S-nitrosothiols, nitroxyl, and nitrolinoleate. The latter two species also inhibited mitochondrial complex II. (iv) Nitroxyl protected cardiomyocytes against IR injury in an mKATP-dependent manner. Overall, these results suggest that the mKATP channel is activated by specific reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and inhibited by NADPH. The redox modulation of mKATP may be an underlying mechanism for its regulation in the context of IPC. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Mitochondria and Cardioprotection.

Abstract: Growth factor activates mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases to promote cell growth. Mitochondrial biogenesis is an integral part of cell growth. How growth factor regulates mitochondrial biogenesis is not fully understood. In this study, we found that mitochondrial mass was specifically reduced upon serum starvation and induced upon re-feeding with serum. Using mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases inhibitor U0126, we found that the mRNA expression levels of ATP synthase, cytochrome-C, mitochondrial transcription factor A, and mitofusin 2 were reduced. Since the transcriptional levels of these genes are under the control of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α and -1β (PGC-1α and PGC-1β), we examined and found that only the mRNA and protein levels of PGC-1β were suppressed. Importantly, over-expression of PGC-1β partially reversed the reduction of mitochondrial mass upon U0126 treatment. Thus, we conclude that mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases direct mitochondrial biogenesis through selectively inducing PGC-1β expression.

Abstract: The facilitates chromatin transcription (FACT) complex affects nuclear DNA transactions in a chromatin context. Though the involvement of FACT in eukaryotic DNA replication has been revealed, a clear understanding of its biochemical behavior during DNA replication still remains elusive. Here, we analyzed the chromatin-binding dynamics of FACT using Xenopus egg extract cell-free system. We found that FACT has at least two distinct chromatin-binding phases: (1) a rapid chromatin-binding phase at the onset of DNA replication that did not involve origin licensing and (2) a second phase of chromatin binding that initiated after origin licensing. Intriguingly, early-binding FACT dissociated from chromatin when DNA replication was blocked by the addition of Cdc6 in the licensed state before origin firing. Cdc6-induced removal of FACT was blocked by the inhibition of origin licensing with geminin, but not by suppressing the activity of DNA polymerases, CDK, or Cdc7. Furthermore, chromatin transfer experiments revealed that impairing the later binding of FACT severely compromises DNA replication activity. Taken together, we propose that even though FACT has rapid chromatin-binding activity, the binding pattern of FACT on chromatin changes after origin licensing, which may contribute to the establishment of its functional link to the DNA replication machinery.

Abstract: DMPK, the product of the mutated gene in myotonic dystrophy type 1, belongs to the subfamily of Rho-associated serine–threonine protein kinases, whose members play a role in actin-based cell morphodynamics. Not much is known about the physiological role of differentially localized individual DMPK splice isoforms. We report here that prominent stellar-shaped stress fibers are formed during early and late steps of differentiation in DMPK-deficient myoblast–myotubes upon complementation with the short cytosolic DMPK E isoform. Expression of DMPK E led to an increased phosphorylation status of MLC2. We found no such effects with vectors that encode a mutant DMPK E which was rendered enzymatically inactive or any of the long C-terminally anchored DMPK isoforms. Presence of stellar structures appears associated with changes in cell shape and motility and a delay in myogenesis. Our data strongly suggest that cytosolic DMPK participates in remodeling of the actomyosin cytoskeleton in developing skeletal muscle cells.

Abstract: DREAM is a Ca2+-binding protein with specific functions in different cell compartments. In the nucleus, DREAM acts as a transcriptional repressor, although the mechanism that controls its nuclear localization is unknown. Yeast two-hybrid assay revealed the interaction between DREAM and the SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 and bioinformatic analysis identified four sumoylation-susceptible sites in the DREAM sequence. Single K-to-R mutations at positions K26 and K90 prevented in vitro sumoylation of recombinant DREAM. DREAM sumoylation mutants retained the ability to bind to the DRE sequence but showed reduced nuclear localization and failed to regulate DRE-dependent transcription. In PC12 cells, sumoylated DREAM is present exclusively in the nucleus and neuronal differentiation induced nuclear accumulation of sumoylated DREAM. In fully differentiated trigeminal neurons, DREAM and SUMO-1 colocalized in nuclear domains associated with transcription. Our results show that sumoylation regulates the nuclear localization of DREAM in differentiated neurons. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: 11th European Symposium on Calcium.

Abstract: DYRK1A is encoded in the Down's syndrome critical region on human chromosome 21, and plays an important role in the functional and developmental regulation of many types of cells, including neuronal cells. Here we have identified WDR68, an evolutionarily conserved protein with WD40-repeat domains, as a cellular binding partner of DYRK1A. WDR68 was originally identified in petunia as AN11 that controls the pigmentation of flowers by stimulating the transcription of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes. Experiments with RNA interference showed that WDR68 was indispensable for the optimal proliferation and survival of mammalian cultured cell, and WDR68 depletion induced cell apoptosis. DYRK1A and DYRK1B, but not DYRK2, DYRK3, or DYRK4, bound to endogenous and expressed WDR68. The N-terminal domain, but not the catalytic kinase domain or the C-terminal domain of DYRK1A, was responsible for the WDR68 binding. Deletions in the N-terminal or C-terminal region outside of the central WD40-repeats of WDR68 abolished its binding to DYRK1A, suggesting that WD40 repeats are not sufficient for the association with DYRK1A. Immunofluorescent staining revealed that WDR68 was distributed throughout the cell. Importantly, nuclear accumulation of WDR68 was observed upon co-expression of the wild type and a kinase-dead mutant of DYRK1A. Taken together, these results suggest that DYRK1A binds specifically to WDR68 in cells, and that the binding, but not the phosphorylation event, induces the nuclear translocation of WDR68.

Abstract: The first and third extracellular loops (ECL) of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been implicated in ligand binding and receptor function. This study describes the results of an alanine/leucine scan of ECLs 1 and 3 and loop-associated transmembrane (TM) domains of the secretin-like GPCR calcitonin receptor-like receptor which associates with receptor activity modifying protein 1 to form the CGRP receptor. Leu195Ala, Val198Ala and Ala199Leu at the top of TM2 all reduced αCGRP-mediated cAMP production and internalization; Leu195Ala and Ala199Leu also reduced αCGRP binding. These residues form a hydrophobic cluster within an area defined as the “minor groove” of rhodopsin-like GPCRs. Within ECL1, Ala203Leu and Ala206Leu influenced the ability of αCGRP to stimulate adenylate cyclase. In TM3, His219Ala, Leu220Ala and Leu222Ala have influences on αCGRP binding and cAMP production; they are likely to indirectly influence the binding site for αCGRP as well as having an involvement in signal transduction. On the exofacial surfaces of TMs 6 and 7, a number of residues were identified that reduced cell surface receptor expression, most noticeably Leu351Ala and Glu357Ala in TM6. The residues may contribute to the RAMP1 binding interface. Ile360Ala impaired αCGRP-mediated cAMP production. Ile360 is predicted to be located close to ECL2 and may facilitate receptor activation. Identification of several crucial functional loci gives further insight into the activation mechanism of this complex receptor system and may aid rational drug design.

Abstract: Ataxin-1 is a polyglutamine protein of unknown function that is encoded by the ATXN1 gene in humans. To gain insight into the function of ataxin-1, we sought to identify proteins that interact with ataxin-1 through yeast two-hybrid screening. In this study, transcriptional corepressor CtBP2 was identified as a protein that interacted with ataxin-1. CtBP2 and ataxin-1 colocalized in the nucleus of mammalian cells. Since the E-cadherin promoter is a target of CtBP-mediated repression, the relationship between ataxin-1 and the E-cadherin promoter was investigated. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that CtBP2 and ataxin-1 were recruited to the E-cadherin promoter in mammalian cells. Luciferase assays using E-cadherin promoter reporter constructs revealed that the luciferase activity was enhanced as the level of ataxin-1 protein expression increased. CtBP2 overexpression decreased E-cadherin expression, but expression of ataxin-1 inversely increased the mRNA and protein levels of endogenous E-cadherin. Interestingly, siRNA experiments showed that the transcriptional activation of ataxin-1 was associated with the presence of CtBP2. This study demonstrates that ataxin-1 occupies the promoter region of E-cadherin in vivo and that ataxin-1 activates the promoter in a CtBP2-mediated transcriptional regulation manner.

Abstract: Transcriptional activity of hypoxia-induced factor 1 (HIF1) – a heterodimer of HIF1α and ARNT (HIF1β) – is essential for cellular adaptation to environmental stress and plays an important role in skin development, wound healing, tumorigenesis and barrier function. Using primary mouse and human epidermal keratinocytes at ambient or hypoxic (1% O2) conditions we studied effects of hypoxia upon HIF protein expression. Significant nuclear levels of ARNT and HIF1α along with high HIF1 activity in normoxic keratinocytes suggest an as yet uncharacterised oxygen-independent role for HIF pathway in the epidermis. Acute hypoxia results in an instant but transient increase of HIF1α protein accompanied by a gradual decrease in its mRNA, while ARNT expression remains unchanged. In prolonged (chronic) hypoxia both HIF1α and Arnt are downregulated along with decline of HIF1 activity. However, expression of classical HIF1 targets such as Selenbp1 and Vegfa remains high. Thus, keratinocytes respond to acute hypoxia with immediate block of HIF1α protein degradation and concomitant increase of HIF activity, while under chronic hypoxia pro-angiogenic signalling is maintained through HIF1-independent pathway(s). Decline of HIF1α during chronic exposure is controlled at both mRNA and protein levels, while Arnt is downregulated post-translationally. Distinct transcription levels of Hif1α and Hif3α splice variants under normoxia and their differential response to hypoxia suggest functional diversity of Hif-α isoforms and highlight the complexity of HIF machinery control in epidermal keratinocytes.

Abstract: tBid is a pro-apoptotic molecule. Apoptosis inducers usually act in a cell cycle-specific fashion. The aim of this study was to elucidate whether effect of tBid on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) Hep3B cells was cell cycle phase specific. We synchronized Hep3B cells at G0/G1, S or G2/M phases by chemicals or flow sorting and tested the susceptibility of the cells to recombinant tBid. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay and apoptosis by TUNEL. The results revealed that tBid primarily targeted the cells at G0/G1 phase of cell cycle, and it also increased the cells at the G2/M phase. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), on the other hand, arrested Hep3B cells at the G0/G1 phase, but significantly reduced cells at G2/M phase. The levels of cell cycle-related proteins and caspases were altered in line with the change in the cell cycle. The combination of tBid with 5-FU caused more cells to be apoptotic than either agent alone. Therefore, the complementary effect of tBid and 5-FU on different phases of the cell cycle may explain their synergistric effect on Hep3B cells. The elucidation of the phase-specific effect of tBid points to a possible therapeutic option that combines different phase specific agents to overcome resistance of HCC.

Abstract: SK&F 96365 has been widely used as an inhibitor of transient receptor potential (TRP) calcium channels in various physiological settings. However, growing evidence suggests that SK&F 96365 affects several cellular and molecular processes via uncharacterized off-target mechanisms. In this study, we showed that SK&F 96365 induces apoptosis and autophagy in A7r5 vascular smooth muscle cells. The combined suppression of apoptosis and autophagy provoked necrosis rather than rescued cell death in the cells treated with SK&F 96365. In addition, we found that SK&F 96365 inhibits Akt–mTOR signaling pathways, which is comparable with the efficacy of other known Akt inhibitors. Our findings suggest that SK&F 96365 can be a useful agent for delineating the molecular mechanisms underlying crosstalk among cell death pathways.

Abstract: Internalization of H-Ras from the cell surface onto endomembranes through vesicular endocytic pathways may play a significant role(s) in regulating the outcome of Ras signaling. However, the identity of Ras-associated subcellular vesicles and the means by which Ras localize to these internal sites remain elusive. In this study, we show that H-Ras is absent from endosomes initially derived from a clathrin-dependent endocytic pathway. Instead, both oncogenic H-Ras-61L and wild type H-Ras (basal or EGF-stimulated) bind Arf6-associated clathrin-independent endosomes and vesicles of the endosomal-recycling center (ERC). K-Ras4B-12V can also be internalized via Arf6 endosomes, and the C-terminal tails of both H-Ras and K-Ras4B are sufficient to mediate localization of GFP chimeras to Arf6-associated vesicles. Interestingly, little Raf-1 was found on these Arf6-associated endosomes even when active H-Ras was present. Instead, endogenous Raf-1 distributed primarily on EEA1-containing vesicles, suggesting that this H-Ras effector, although accessible for H-Ras interaction on the plasma membrane, appears to separate from its regulator during early stages of endocytosis. The discrete and dynamic distribution of Ras pathway components with spatio-temporal complexity may contribute to the specificity of Ras:effector interaction.

Abstract: Podocalyxin (PODXL) is a type I membrane mucoprotein abundantly presented in the epithelial cells (podocytes) of kidney glomeruli where it plays an important role in maintaining the plasma filtration. PODXL is also expressed in other types of cells but its function is ignored. A recombinant soluble fragment of the PODXL ectodomain modifies the signaling of the membrane bound PODXL. Based on this antecedent, we aimed at investigating whether PODXL could be cleaved and released into the extracellular space as a soluble peptide. In this study, we used a fusion protein of human PODXL and green fluorescent protein expressed in CHO cells (CHO-PODXL-GFP) and a human tumor cell (Tera-1) inherently expressing PODXL. PODXL was detected by wide-field microscopy in the Golgi, the plasma membrane and in a vesicular form preferentially located at the leading edges of the cell and also progressing along the filopodium. We detected PODXL in the insoluble and soluble fractions of the extracellular medium of CHO-PODXL-GFP cells. Stimulation of protein kinase C (PKC) by Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) enhanced the release of PODXL to the extracellular space whereas this effect was prevented either by inhibitors of PKC or specific inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases. It is concluded that intact PODXL is released to the extracellular space as a cargo of microvesicles and also as a soluble cleaved fragment of ectodomain.

Abstract: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an RNA positive strand virus, member of the Flaviviridae family. The viral particle is composed of a capsid containing the genome, surrounded by E1 and E2 proteins, however different forms of viral particles have been observed including non-enveloped particles. Previous reports have proposed that hepatitis C non-enveloped capsid-like particles (HCVne) enter cells of hepatic origin via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, during which different signaling events occur. In this report we show that HCVne particles are capable of inducing the recently discovered ERK5 pathway, in a dose dependent way. The ERK5 pathway can be activated by growth factors and other extracellular signals. This specific activation occurs through a well characterized upstream kinase, MEK5, and is capable of inducing gene regulation of mef2. In contrast, when HCV core structural and NS5A non-structural proteins were expressed endogenously no activation of this pathway was detected. These cell signaling events could be of critical importance and might give clues for the elucidation of cellular manifestations associated with HCV infection.

Abstract: Etoposide is a widely used anticancer drug in the treatment of different tumors. Etoposide is known to activate a wide range of intracellular signals, which may in turn induce cellular responses other than apoptosis. ADAM10 and TACE/ADAM17 belong to a family of transmembrane extracellular metalloproteinases involved in paracrine/juxtacrine regulation of many signaling pathways. The aim of this work was to evaluate if etoposide induces upregulation of ADAM10 or TACE/ADAM17 in two cell lines (GC-1 and GC-2) derived from male germ cells. Results showed that etoposide induced apoptosis in a dose–response manner in both GC-1 and GC-2 cells. Apoptosis started to increase 6h after etoposide addition in GC-2 cells, whereas the same was observed 18h after addition to the GC-1 cells. Protein and mRNA levels of ADAM10 and TACE/ADAM17 increased 18h after etoposide was removed from the GC-1 cells. In GC-2 cells, the protein levels of both proteins increased 12h after etoposide was removed. ADAM10 mRNA increased after 3h and then steadily decreased up to 12h after removal, whereas TACE/ADAM17 mRNA decreased after etoposide removal. Finally, apoptosis was prevented in GC-1 and GC-2 cells by the addition of pharmacological inhibitors of ADAM10 and TACE/ADAM17 to the culture medium of etoposide-treated cells. Our results show for the first time that etoposide upregulates ADAM10 and TACE/ADAM17 mRNA and protein levels. In addition, we also show that ADAM10 and TACE/ADAM17 have a role in etoposide-induced apoptosis.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells stimulate tumor growth in vivo through a lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-dependent mechanism. However, the molecular mechanism by which mesenchymal stem cells stimulate tumorigenesis is largely elusive. In the present study, we demonstrate that conditioned medium from A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549 CM) induces expression of periostin, an extracellular matrix protein, in human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hASCs). A549 CM-stimulated periostin expression was abrogated by pretreatment of hASCs with the LPA receptor 1 (LPA1) inhibitor Ki16425 or short hairpin RNA-mediated silencing of LPA1, suggesting a key role of the LPA–LPA1 signaling axis in A549 CM-stimulated periostin expression. Using a xenograft transplantation model of A549 cells, we demonstrated that co-injection of hASCs potentiated tumor growth of A549 cells in vivo and that co-transplanted hASCs expressed not only periostin but also α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), a marker of carcinoma-associated fibroblasts. Small interfering RNA- or short hairpin RNA-mediated silencing of periostin resulted in blockade of LPA-induced α-SMA expression in hASCs. In addition, silencing of periostin resulted in blockade of hASC-stimulated growth of A549 xenograft tumors and in vivo differentiation of transplanted hASCs to α-SMA-positive carcinoma-associated fibroblasts. Conditioned medium derived from LPA-treated hASCs (LPA CM) potentiated proliferation and adhesion of A549 cells and short interfering RNA-mediated silencing or immunodepletion of periostin from LPA CM abrogated proliferation and adhesion of A549 cells. These results suggest a pivotal role for hASC-secreted periostin in growth of A549 xenograft tumors within the tumor microenvironment.

Abstract: The gelatinases, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and -2, are produced as latent, inactive enzymes that can be proteolytically activated by a number of proteases. In many normal and pathological conditions, where the expression of MMPs is deregulated, changes in the expression of other proteases have also been reported. Human kallikrein-related peptidase 7 (KLK7), a chymotryptic-like serine protease, is overexpressed in many different types of neoplastic conditions, which have also been shown to express high levels of both MMP-9 and -2. Since the activation of MMPs by KLK7 has never been examined, we sought to determine whether KLK7 can activate these MMPs. To test this hypothesis KLK7 was incubated with the recombinant MMPs and the products of the reaction were analyzed for their activity. Incubation of proMMP-9 with KLK7 resulted in the production of a novel truncated, active MMP-9 lacking the C-terminal hemopexin domains. In contrast, KLK7 degraded, but did not activate, proMMP-2. The novel activation of proMMP-9 by KLK7 was further confirmed using conditioned medium prepared from an MMP-9-expressing cell line, MDA-MMP-9. Our results clearly establish that KLK7 activates proMMP-9 to produce a novel truncated, active MMP-9 product not generated by other proteases. These findings suggest that KLK7 may play an important role in the activation of MMP-9 in tumors that express high levels of both these proteases and the resulting truncated MMP may possess altered substrate specificities compared with full-length MMP-9 activated by other proteases.

Abstract: The homeobox transcription factor PROX1 is essential for the development and maintenance of lymphatic vasculature. How PROX1 regulates lymphatic endothelial cell fate remains undefined. PROX1 has been shown to upregulate the expression of Cyclin E, which mediates the G1 to S transition of the cell cycle. Here we demonstrate that PROX1 activates the mouse Cyclin E1 (Ccne1) promoter via two proximal E2F-binding sites. We have determined that the N-terminal region of PROX1 is sufficient to activate a 1-kb Ccne1 promoter, whereas the homeodomain is dispensable for activation. We have identified that the Prospero domain 1 (PD1) is required for the nuclear localization of PROX1. Our comparison of two DNA-binding-deficient constructs of PROX1 showed a cell-type-specific difference between these two proteins in both their localization and function. We demonstrated that siRNA-mediated knockdown of PROX1 in lymphatic endothelial cells decreases progression from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle. We conclude that PROX1 activates the Ccne1 promoter independent of DNA binding, and our results illustrate a novel role for PROX1 in the regulation of lymphatic endothelial cell proliferation.

Abstract: Recent evidence suggests that coupled leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis operates in mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication, but the factors involved in lagging strand synthesis are largely uncharacterised. We investigated the effect of knockdown of the candidate proteins in cultured human cells under conditions where mtDNA appears to replicate chiefly via coupled leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis to restore the copy number of mtDNA to normal levels after transient mtDNA depletion. DNA ligase III knockdown attenuated the recovery of mtDNA copy number and appeared to cause single strand nicks in replicating mtDNA molecules, suggesting the involvement of DNA ligase III in Okazaki fragment ligation in human mitochondria. Knockdown of ribonuclease (RNase) H1 completely prevented the mtDNA copy number restoration, and replication intermediates with increased single strand nicks were readily observed. On the other hand, knockdown of neither flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) nor DNA2 affected mtDNA replication. These findings imply that RNase H1 is indispensable for the progression of mtDNA synthesis through removing RNA primers from Okazaki fragments. In the nucleus, Okazaki fragments are ligated by DNA ligase I, and the RNase H2 is involved in Okazaki fragment processing. This study thus proposes that the mitochondrial replication system utilises distinct proteins, DNA ligase III and RNase H1, for Okazaki fragment maturation.

Abstract: Interleukin 12 (IL-12) is a heterodimeric, pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a central role in activation and differentiation of CD4+ T cells into interferon-γ secreting T-helper type 1 cells. IL-12B, a gene encoding the larger subunit of active IL-12, has been reported to be down-regulated by the nuclear hormone 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1α,25(OH)2D3), but the mechanism of the regulation is unknown. In this study, we have examined the molecular mechanism of transcriptional regulation of the IL-12B gene by 1α,25(OH)2D3 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated human monocytes (THP-1). Quantitative RT-PCR showed that IL-12B mRNA displays a cyclical expression profile and is down-regulated 2.8-fold during the first 8h and even 12.1-fold 24h after exposure to 1α,25(OH)2D3. Gel shift and quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays demonstrated vitamin D receptor (VDR) binding to genomic regions 480 and 6300bp upstream of the IL-12B transcription start site (TSS). Quantitative ChIP assays also revealed that together with VDR and its partner RXR the above regions recruited the co-repressor NCOR2/SMRT and histone deacetylase 3 leading to a decreased histone 4 acetylation and increased histone 3 trimethylation at the IL-12B promoter and its TSS. We suggest that these repressive epigenetic changes eventually cause down-regulation of IL-12 expression.

Abstract: In order to establish whether non-mitochondrial oxidase activity in human neutrophils is tightly related to cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, we simultaneously measured Ca2+ oscillations induced by ATP and oxidant production in single adherent neutrophils using confocal microscopy. ATP induced fast damped Ca2+ spikes with a period of 15s and slower irregular spikes with a period greater than 50s. Spikes in Ca2+ occurred in the absence of Ca2+ influx, but the amplitude was damped by inhibition of Ca2+ influx. Using the oxidation of hydroethidine as a cytosolic marker of oxidant production, we show that the generation of reactive oxygen species by neutrophils adherent to glass was accelerated by ATP. The step-up in NADPH oxidase activity followed the first elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ but, despite subsequent spikes in Ca2+ concentration, no oscillations in oxidase activity could be detected. ATP induced spikes in Ca2+ in a very reproducible way and we propose that the Ca2+ signal is an on-switch for oxidase activity, but the activity is apparently not directly correlated with spiking activity in cytosolic Ca2+.

Abstract: Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1) plays a key role in breast cancer development and cell cycle regulation. It has been demonstrated that IGF-1 stimulates cyclin expression, thus regulating the G1 to S phase transition of the cell cycle. Potassium (K+) channels are involved in the G1 phase progression of the cell cycle induced by growth factors. However, mechanisms that allow growth factors to cooperate with K+ channels in order to modulate the G1 phase progression and cyclin expression remain unknown. Here, we focused on hEag1 K+ channels which are over-expressed in breast cancer and are involved in the G1 phase progression of breast cancer cells (MCF-7). As expected, IGF-1 increased cyclin D1 and E expression of MCF-7 cells in a cyclic manner, whereas the increase of CDK4 and 2 levels was sustained. IGF-1 stimulated p21WAF1/Cip1 expression with a kinetic similar to that of cyclin D1, however p27Kip1 expression was insensitive to IGF-1. Interestingly, astemizole, a blocker of hEag1 channels, but not E4031, a blocker of HERG channels, inhibited the expression of both cyclins after 6–8h of co-stimulation with IGF-1. However, astemizole failed to modulate CDK4, CDK2, p21WAF1/Cip1 and p27Kip1 expression. The down-regulation of hEag1 by siRNA provoked a decrease in cyclin expression. This study is the first to demonstrate that K+ channels such as hEag1 are directly involved in the IGF-1-induced up-regulation of cyclin D1 and E expression in MCF-7 cells. By identifying more specifically the temporal position of the arrest site induced by the inhibition of hEag1 channels, we confirmed that hEag1 activity is predominantly upstream of the arrest site induced by serum-deprivation, prior to the up-regulation of both cyclins D1 and E.

Abstract: We are here showing that peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PBMC) from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients contain almost undetectable amounts of mature 170 kDa CF-transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and a highly represented 100 kDa form. This CFTR protein, resembling the form produced by calpain digestion and present, although in lower amounts, also in normal PBMC, is localized in cytoplasmic internal vesicles. These observations are thus revealing that the calpain-mediated proteolysis is largely increased in cells from CF patients. To characterize the process leading to the accumulation of such split CFTR, FRT cells expressing the F508del-CFTR mutated channel protein and human leukaemic T cell line (JA3), expressing wild type CFTR were used. In in vitro experiments, the sensitivity of the mutated channel to the protease is identical to that of the wild type, whereas in Ca2+-loaded cells F508del-CFTR is more susceptible to digestion. Inhibition of intracellular calpain activity prevents CFTR degradation and leads to a 10-fold increase in the level of F508del-CFTR at the plasma membrane, further indicating the involvement of calpain activity in the maintenance of very low levels of mature channel form. The higher sensitivity to calpain of the mutated 170 kDa CFTR results from a reduced affinity for HSP90 causing a lower degree of protection from calpain digestion. The recovery of HSP90 binding capacity in F508del-CFTR, following digestion, explains the large accumulation of the 100 kDa CFTR form in circulating PBMC from CF patients.

Abstract: Cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) is a GPCR highly expressed on the surface of cells of the immune system, supporting its role in immunomodulation. This study has investigated the trafficking properties of this receptor when stably expressed by HEK-293 cells. As previously reported, cell surface CB2 rapidly internalized upon exposure to agonist. Direct evidence of CB2 recycling was observed upon competitive removal of the stimulating agonist by inverse agonist. CB2 also underwent slow constitutive internalization when agonist was absent and was up-regulated in the presence of inverse agonist. Co-expression of CB2 and dominant negative Rab5 resulted in a significantly reduced capacity for receptors to internalize with no effect on recycling of the internalized receptors. Conversely, co-expression with dominant negative Rab11 did not alter the ability of CB2 to internalize but did impair their ability to return to the cell surface. Co-expression of wild-type, dominant negative or constitutively active Rab4 with CB2 did not alter basal surface expression, extent of internalization, or extent of recycling. These results suggest that Rab5 is involved in CB2 endocytosis and that internalized receptors are recycled via a Rab11 associated pathway rather than the rapid Rab4 associated pathway. This report provides the first comprehensive description of CB2 internalization and recycling to date.

Abstract: Neutrophils are the most abundant leukocyte and have a short lifespan, dying by apoptosis approximately five days after leaving the bone marrow. Their apoptosis can be delayed at sites of inflammation to extend their functional lifespan, but inappropriate inhibition of apoptosis contributes to chronic inflammatory disease. Levels of the physiological iron chelator lactoferrin are raised at sites of inflammation and we have shown previously that iron-unsaturated lactoferrin inhibited human neutrophil apoptosis, but the mechanisms involved were not determined. Here we report that the anti-apoptotic effect of lactoferrin is dependent upon its iron saturation status as iron-saturated lactoferrin did not affect neutrophil apoptosis. We also show that the effect of lactoferrin is mediated at an early stage in apoptosis as it inhibited activation of sphingomyelinase, generation of ceramide, activation of caspase 8 and Bax and cleavage of Bid. Lactoferrin did not inhibit apoptosis induced by exogenous ceramide, supporting the proposal that it acts upstream of ceramide generation. We therefore conclude that raised lactoferrin levels are likely to contribute to chronic inflammation by delaying neutrophil apoptosis and that this is achieved by inhibiting proximal apoptotic signaling events.

Abstract: Previous studies have implicated a role of heterotrimeric Gαi proteins in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory responses. We hypothesized that Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling regulates Gαi proteins, which are anti-inflammatory in endotoxemia and polymicrobial sepsis. RAW 264.7 cells were stimulated with LPS and the Gαi–GTP protein complex was immunoprecipitated with a Gαi protein activation assay. In subsequent in vivo studies, the Gαi protein inhibitor pertussis toxin (PTx) or Gi protein agonist mastoparan (MP-7) were administrated prior to endotoxemia. LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines and mortality were determined. To examine the role of Gαi2 in sepsis, Gαi2 (−/−) and wildtype (WT) mice were subjected to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and monitored every 24 h for 120 h. Other mice were sacrificed 24 h after CLP. Peritoneal fluid, blood, and tissue samples were collected. Plasma pro-inflammatory cytokine production, bacterial load in peritoneal fluid, blood and lung tissue, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in lung and liver and different immune cell populations in spleen were studied. We found that Gαi proteins are rapidly activated by LPS followed by rapid inactivation. These studies provide the first direct evidence that Gαi proteins are modulated by TLR signaling. In following studies, PTx augmented LPS-induced plasma TNFα, IL-6, whereas MP-7 suppressed LPS-induced TNFα and decreased LPS-induced mortality. In sepsis studies, the survival rate post-CLP was significantly decreased in the Gαi2 (−/−) mice compared to WT mice. CLP-induced plasma TNFα, IL-6, bacterial load in peritoneal fluid, blood and lung tissue and lung and liver MPO activity were significantly increased in Gαi2 (−/−) compared to WT mice. Gαi2 (−/−) mice also exhibited increased Th1 and Th2 responses compared to WT mice. Taken together, Gαi proteins are activated by LPS and negatively regulate endotoxemia and sepsis.

Abstract: The Src-homology 3 (SH3) domain is one of the most frequent protein recognition modules (PRMs), being represented in signal transduction pathways and in several pathologies such as cancer and AIDS. Grb2 (growth factor receptor-bound protein 2) is an adaptor protein that contains two SH3 domains and is involved in receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signal transduction pathways. The HIV-1 transactivator factor Tat is required for viral replication and it has been shown to bind directly or indirectly to several host proteins, deregulating their functions. In this study, we show interaction between the cellular factor Grb2 and the HIV-1 trans-activating protein Tat. The binding is mediated by the proline-rich sequence of Tat and the SH3 domain of Grb2. As the adaptor protein Grb2 participates in a wide variety of signaling pathways, we characterized at least one of the possible downstream effects of the Tat/Grb2 interaction on the well-known IGF-1R/Raf/MAPK cascade. We show that the binding of Tat to Grb2 impairs activation of the Raf/MAPK pathway, while potentiating the PKA/Raf inhibitory pathway. The Tat/Grb2 interaction affects also viral function by inhibiting the Tat-mediated transactivation of HIV-1 LTR and viral replication in infected primary microglia.

Abstract: We present a study of intramuscular motion during contraction of skeletal muscle myofibrils. Myofibrillar actin was labeled with fluorescent dye so that the ratio of fluorescently labeled to unlabeled protein was 1:105. Such sparse labeling assured that there was on average only one actin-marker present in the focus at a given time. From the intensity signal in the two orthogonal detection channels, significant fluctuations, similar to fluorescent burst in diffusion-based single-molecule detection schemes, were identified via a threshold algorithm and analyzed with respect to their intensity and polarization. When only rigor complexes were formed, the fluctuations of polarized intensity were characterized by unimodal Gaussian photon distributions. During contraction, in contrast, bimodal Gaussian photon distributions were observed above the rigor background threshold. This suggests that the bimodal Gaussian photon distributions represent pre- and post-power stroke conformations. Clusters of polarized photons indicated an anisotropy decay of single actomyosin motors of ~9s during muscle contraction.

Abstract: The accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) during stress conditions causes activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). If this adaptive response cannot restore ER homeostasis, cells undergo ER-mediated apoptosis. This study determines whether thermotolerance developed at a mild temperature (40°C) can alter induction of ER-mediated stress and apoptosis by H2O2 in HeLa cells. Protein expression of PERK, p-PERK, eIF2α and p-eIF2α was increased in thermotolerant compared to non-thermotolerant cells. Thus, mild thermotolerance enhanced pro-survival effects of the PERK/eIF2α branch of the UPR. A short exposure (15min) of cells to H2O2 (15–50μM) activated the UPR: expression of p-PERK, p-eIF2α and p-IRE1α increased, and ATF6 cleavage occurred. Longer exposure (1–3h) to H2O2 induced ER-mediated apoptosis, whereby CHOP expression increased, and enzymatic activity of calpain, caspase-7, -4, -12 and -9 also increased. These pro-apoptotic events and clonogenic cell killing were all diminished in thermotolerant cells. Activation of caspases-4/-12 was decreased by the calcium chelator BAPTA-AM, and by inhibitors of calpain and caspase-7, confirming the roles of calcium, calpain and caspase-7 in activation of ER-mediated apoptosis by H2O2. In thermotolerant cells with decreased levels of PERK by siRNA, there was partial reversal of resistance to H2O2-induced apoptosis. Hence, a causal connection exists between the ER stress response and resistance to H2O2-induced apoptosis. Mild thermotolerance plays a protective, anti-apoptotic role by increasing the threshold for induction of ER-mediated apoptosis by H2O2. Moreover, the adaptive response (UPR) dominates during milder H2O2 stress, whereas ER-mediated apoptosis occurs during more severe stress.

Abstract: A zinc-finger protein which regulates apoptosis and cell cycle arrest 1 (Zac1) is a novel seven-zinc-finger protein that can bind a specific GC-rich DNA element and has intrinsic transactivation activity; therefore, its role as a transcription factor has been proposed. Zac1 not only promotes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis but also acts as a transcriptional cofactor for nuclear receptors and p53. In this study, we examined the functional roles of mouse Zac1 (mZac1) in HeLa cells treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (PMA), a potent Activator protein 1 (AP-1) activator. At first, we found that mZac1 prolonged and enhanced PMA-induced AP-1 activity in both HeLa and HeLa/p53 shRNA cells. We further identified physical and functional interactions between mZac1 and AP-1 proteins (either c-Jun, c-Fos or both). Finally, we showed that Zac1 might function as a selective coactivator of AP-1, demonstrated by AP-1-dependent transcriptional activation of collagenase, c-Fos and p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter activities. Identification of AP-1 as a specific target for Zac1-mediated transcriptional events not only establishes a direct link between these two pivotal regulatory proteins but also raises the possibility that Zac1 contributes to certain AP-1-dependent biological effects.

Abstract: Following the apoptotic permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane, the inter-membrane space protein second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (Smac) is released into the cytosol. Smac efficiently promotes apoptosis by antagonizing x-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), an inhibitor of caspases-9, -3, and -7, via a short NH2-terminal inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) binding motif (AVPI). Native Smac dimerizes to form a highly stable and inflexible elongated arch, however, a functional role for this outstretched structure so far remained unknown. Using time-lapse single-cell imaging of DLD-1 and HCT-116 colon cancer cells, we here demonstrate that upon mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization physiological expression levels of XIAP are sufficient to selectively prolong the release of dimeric but not monomeric Smac. Elevating the expression of XIAP further extended the release duration of dimeric Smac and resulted in the mitochondrial retention of a significant proportion of the Smac pool. In contrast, monomeric Smac was always fully released and the release kinetics were not affected by altered XIAP expression. Our findings therefore indicate that the dimerization of Smac is critical for the XIAP-mediated retention of Smac at or inside the mitochondria.

Abstract: DDX3, a DEAD box protein family member, appears to promote the progression of some cancers, which may partly result from its impedance of death receptor-mediated apoptosis. We found that another mechanism by which DDX3 may aid cancer progression is by promoting increased levels of the transcription factor Snail. Snail represses expression of cellular adhesion proteins, leading to increased cell migration and metastasis of many types of cancer. Knockdown of DDX3 levels by shRNA reduced basal levels of Snail in HeLa and MCF-7 cells, and this was associated with reduced cell proliferation and migration. Snail protein and mRNA levels were increased by treatment with the HDAC inhibitors sodium butyrate or trichostatin A, and these increases were attenuated in cells with DDX3 knocked down. Treatment of cells with camptothecin was discovered to increase Snail protein levels, and this increase was diminished in cells with DDX3 knocked down. Analysis of 31 patient glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) samples revealed a significant correlation between the levels of DDX3 and Snail. Thus, DDX3 is required for basal Snail expression and increases in Snail induced by HDAC inhibitors or camptothecin, indicating that this action of DDX3 may contribute to its promotion of the progression of some cancers.

Abstract: αB-crystallin, a member of the small heat shock protein family, has been implicated in various biological functions including response to heat shock, differentiation and apoptosis, the mechanisms of which have not been well understood. Myoblasts, the precursor cells in muscle regeneration, when subjected to growth factor deprivation differentiate to form myotubes or undergo apoptosis. During differentiation, myoblasts express elevated levels of αB-crystallin as well as TNF-α but the connecting link between these proteins in cell signaling is not clearly understood. We have therefore investigated the role of αB-crystallin in TNF-α induced regulation of NF-κB. We demonstrate that in response to TNF-α treatment, αB-crystallin associates with IKKβ and activate its kinase activity, facilitating the degradation of phosphorylated I-kBα, a prime step in NF-κB activation. Reducing the level of αB-crystallin using the RNAi approach reduces the translocation of p65, further confirming the role of αB-crystallin in NF-κB activation. Our study shows that the ability of αB-crystallin to activate NF-κB depends on its phosphorylation status. The present study shows that αB-crystallin-dependent NF-κB activation protects myoblasts from TNF-α induced cytoxicity by enhancing the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl 2. Thus, our study identifies yet another mechanism by which αB-crystallin exerts its anti-apoptotic activity.

Abstract: Tissue factor pathway inhibitor 2 (TFPI2) is a serine protease inhibitor critical for the regulation of extracellular matrix remodeling and atherosclerotic plaque stability. Previously, we demonstrated that TFPI2 expression is increased in monocytes from patients with familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCH). To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms responsible for this upregulation, we examined TFPI2 expression in THP-1 macrophages exposed to lipoproteins and thrombin. Our results showed that TFPI2 expression was not affected by treatment with very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), but was induced by thrombin (10 U/ml) in THP-1 (1.9-fold increase, p<0.001) and human monocyte-derived macrophages (2.3-fold increase, p<0.005). The specificity of the inductive effect was demonstrated by preincubation with the thrombin inhibitors hirudin and PPACK, which ablated thrombin effects. TFPI2 induction was prevented by pre-incubation with MEK1/2 and JNK inhibitors, but not by the EGF receptor antagonist AG1478. In the presence of parthenolide, an inhibitor of NFκB, but not of SR-11302, a selective AP-1 inhibitor, thrombin-mediated TFPI2 induction was blunted. Our results also show that thrombin treatment increased ERK1/2, JNK and IκBα phosphorylation. Finally, we ruled out the possibility that TFPI2 induction by thrombin was mediated by COX-2, as preincubation with a selective COX-2 inhibitor did not prevent the inductive effect. In conclusion, thrombin induces TFPI2 expression by a mechanism involving ERK1/2 and JNK phosphorylation, leading finally to NFkB activation. In the context of atherosclerosis, thrombin-induced macrophage TFPI2 expression could represent a means of avoiding excessive activation of matrix metalloproteases at sites of inflammation.

Abstract: Parcs/Gpn3 is a putative GTPase that is conserved in eukaryotic cells from yeast to humans, suggesting that it plays a fundamental, but still unknown, cellular function. Suppression of Parcs/Gpn3 expression by RNAi completely blocked cell proliferation in MCF-12A cells and other mammary epithelial cell lines. Unexpectedly, Parcs/Gpn3 knockdown had a more modest effect in the proliferation of the tumorigenic MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR3 cells. RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) co-immunoprecipitated with Parcs/Gpn3. Parcs/Gpn3 depletion caused a reduction in overall RNA synthesis in MCF-12A cells but not in MDA-MB-231 cells, demonstrating a role for Parcs/Gpn3 in transcription, and pointing to a defect in RNA synthesis by RNAP II as the possible cause of halted proliferation. The absence of Parcs/Gpn3 in MCF-12A cells caused a dramatic change in the sub-cellular localization of Rpb1, the largest subunit of RNAP II. As expected, Rpb1 was present only in the nucleus of MCF-12A control cells, whereas in Parcs/Gpn3-depleted MCF-12A cells, Rpb1 was detected exclusively in the cytoplasm. This effect was specific, as histones remained nuclear independently of Parcs/Gpn3. Rpb1 protein levels were markedly increased in Parcs/Gpn3-depleted MCF-12A cells. Interestingly, Rpb1 distribution was only marginally affected after knocking-down Parcs/Gpn3 in MDA-MB-231 cells. In conclusion, we report here, for the first time, that Parcs/Gpn3 plays a critical role in the nuclear accumulation of RNAP II, and we propose that this function explains the relative importance of Parcs/Gpn3 in cell proliferation. Intriguingly, at least some tumorigenic mammary cells have evolved mechanisms that allow them to proliferate in a Parcs/Gpn3-independent manner.

Abstract: Minichromosome maintenance 10 (MCM10) is a conserved, abundant nuclear protein, which plays a key role in the initiation of eukaryotic chromosomal DNA replication and elongation. To elucidate the physiological importance of MCM10 in vivo, we generated conventional knockout mice. No MCM10-null embryos were recovered after E8.5, and the mutation was found to be lethal before the implantation stage. Mutant embryos showed apparently normal growth until the morula stage, but growth defects after this stage. The dramatic reduction of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation in the mutant embryo, followed by cell death, suggests that defective cell proliferation may underlie this developmental failure. Taken together, these findings provide the first unequivocal genetic evidence for an essential and non-redundant physiological role of MCM10 during murine peri-implantation development.

Abstract: Phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) plays an important role in regulation of inflammation. Previously published studies have shown that PLTP binds, transfers and neutralizes bacterial lipopolysaccharides. In the current study we tested the hypothesis that PLTP can also regulate anti-inflammatory pathways in macrophages. Incubation of macrophage-like differentiated THP1 cells and human monocyte-derived macrophages with wild-type PLTP in the presence or absence of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) or interferon gamma (IFNγ) significantly increased nuclear levels of active signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, pSTAT3Tyr705 (p<0.01). Similar results were obtained in the presence of a PLTP mutant without lipid transfer activity (PLTPM159E), suggesting that PLTP-mediated lipid transfer is not required for activation of the STAT3 pathway. Inhibition of ABCA1 by chemical inhibitor, glyburide, as well as ABCA1 RNA inhibition, reversed the observed PLTP-mediated activation of STAT3. In addition, PLTP reduced nuclear levels of active nuclear factor kappa-B (NFκB) p65 and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines in conditioned media of differentiated THP1 cells and human monocyte-derived macrophages. Our data suggest that PLTP has anti-inflammatory capabilities in macrophages.

Abstract: Calmodulin (CaM) is a ubiquitous Ca2+ sensor regulating many biochemical processes in eukaryotic cells. Its interaction with a great variety of different target proteins has led to the fundamental question of its mechanism of action. CaM exhibits four “EF hand” type Ca2+ binding sites. One way to explain CaM functioning is to consider that the protein interacts differently with its target proteins depending on the number of Ca2+ ions bound to it. To test this hypothesis, the binding properties of three entities known to interact with CaM (a fluorescent probe and two peptide analogs to the CaM binding sites of death associated protein kinase (DAPK) and of EGFR) were investigated using a quantitative approach based on fluorescence polarization (FP). Probe and peptide interactions with CaM were studied using a titration matrix in which both CaM and calcium concentrations were varied. Experiments were performed with SynCaM, a hybrid CaM able to activate CaM dependent enzymes from mammalian and plant cells. Results show that the interaction between CaM and its targets is regulated by the number of calcium ions bound to the protein, namely one for the DAPK peptide, two for the probe and four for the EGFR peptide. The approach used provides a new tool to elaborate a typology of CaM-targets, based on their recognition by the various CaM–Can (n=0–4) complexes. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: 11th European Symposium on Calcium.

Abstract: Maturation of pulmonary fetal type II cells to initiate adequate surfactant production is crucial for postnatal respiratory function. Little is known about specific mechanisms of signal transduction controlling type II cell maturation. The ErbB4 receptor and its ligand neuregulin (NRG) are critical for lung development. ErbB4 is cleaved at the cell membrane by the γ-secretase enzyme complex whose active component is either presenilin-1 (PSEN-1) or presenilin-2. ErbB4 cleavage releases the 80kDa intracellular domain (4ICD), which associates with chaperone proteins such as YAP (Yes-associated protein) and translocates to the nucleus to regulate gene expression. We hypothesized that PSEN-1 and YAP have a development-specific expression in fetal type II cells and are important for ErbB4 signaling in surfactant production. In primary fetal mouse E16, E17, and E18 type II cells, PSEN-1 and YAP expression increased at E17 and E18 over E16. Subcellular fractionation showed a strong cytosolic and a weaker membrane location of both PSEN-1 and YAP. This was enhanced by NRG stimulation. Co-immunoprecipitations showed ErbB4 associated separately with PSEN-1 and with YAP. Their association, phosphorylation, and co-localization were induced by NRG. Confocal immunofluorescence and nuclear fractionation confirmed these associations in a time-dependent manner after NRG stimulation. Primary ErbB4-deleted E17 type II cells were transfected with a mutant ErbB4 lacking the γ-secretase binding site. When compared to transfection with wild-type ErbB4, the stimulatory effect of NRG on surfactant protein mRNA expression was lost. We conclude that PSEN-1 and YAP have crucial roles in ErbB4 signal transduction during type II cell maturation.

Abstract: Objective
In atherosclerotic lesions, fractalkine (CX3CL1) and its receptor (CX3CR1) expressed by smooth muscle cells (SMC) and monocytes/macrophages, mediate the heterotypic anchorage and chemotaxis of these cells. We questioned whether, during the close interaction of monocytes with SMC, the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 pair modulates the expression of pro-atherogenic molecules in these cells.
Methods and results
SMC were co-cultured with monocytes or LPS-activated monocytes (18h) and then the cells were separated and individually investigated for the gene and protein expression of TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, CX3CR1 and metalloproteinases (MMP-2, MMP-9). We found that SMC–monocyte interaction induced, in each cell type, an increased mRNA and protein expression of TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, CX3CR1, MMP-2 and MMP-9. Blocking the binding of fractalkine to CX3CR1 (by pre-incubation of monocytes with anti-CX3CR1 or by CX3CR1 siRNA transfection) before cell co-culture decreased the production of TNFα, CX3CR1 and MMP-9. Monocyte–SMC interaction induced the phosphorylation of p38MAPK and activation of AP-1 transcription factor. Silencing the p65 (NF-kB subunit) inhibited the IL-1β and IL-6 and silencing c-jun inhibited the TNFα, CX3CR1 and MMP-9 induced by SMC–monocyte interaction.
Conclusions
The cross-talk between SMC and monocytes augments the inflammatory response in both cell types as revealed by the increased expression of TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, CX3CR1 and MMPs. Up-regulation of TNFα, CX3CR1 and MMP-9 is further increased upon interaction of SMC with activated monocytes and is dependent on fractalkine/CXRCR1 pair. These data imply that the fractalkine/CX3RCR1 axis may represent a therapeutic target to impede the inflammatory process associated with atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Mutations in cereblon (CRBN), a substrate binding component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, cause a form of mental retardation in humans. However, the cellular proteins that interact with CRBN remain largely unknown. Here, we report that CRBN directly interacts with the α1 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK α1) and inhibits the activation of AMPK activation. The ectopic expression of CRBN reduces phosphorylation of AMPK α1 and, thus, inhibits the enzyme in a nutrient-independent manner. Moreover, AMPK α1 can be potently activated by suppressing endogenous CRBN using CRBN-specific small hairpin RNAs. Thus, CRBN may act as a negative modulator of the AMPK signaling pathway in vivo.

Abstract: Helicobacter pylori causes various gastric diseases, such as gastritis, peptic ulcerations, gastric cancer and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. Hpn is a histidine-rich protein abundant in this bacterium and forms oligomers in physiologically relevant conditions. In this present study, Hpn oligomers were found to develop amyloid-like fibrils as confirmed by negative stain transition electron microscopy, thioflavin T and Congo red binding assays. The amyloid-like fibrils of Hpn inhibit the proliferation of gastric epithelial AGS cells through cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase, which may be closely related to the disruption of mitochondrial bioenergetics as reflected by the significant depletion of intracellular ATP levels and the mitochondrial membrane potential. The collective data presented here shed some light on the pathologic mechanisms of H. pylori infections.

Abstract: Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is a T-cell malignancy associated with human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and characterized by visceral invasion. Degradation of the extracellular matrix by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is a crucial process in invasion of tumors and metastasis. MMP-7 (or matrilysin), is a “minimal domain MMP” with proteolytic activity against components of the extracellular matrix. To determine the involvement of MMP-7 in visceral spread in ATL, this study investigated MMP-7 expression in ATL. MMP-7 expression was identified in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines, peripheral blood ATL cells and ATL cells in lymph nodes, but not in uninfected T-cell lines or normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. MMP-7 expression was induced following infection of a human T-cell line with HTLV-1, and specifically by the viral protein Tax. Functionally, MMP-7 promoted cell migration of HTLV-1-infected T cells. The MMP-7 promoter activity was increased by Tax and reduced by deletion of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) binding site. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed high levels of AP-1 binding proteins, including JunD, in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines and ATL cells, and Tax elicited JunD binding to the MMP-7 AP-1 element. Tax-induced MMP-7 activation was inhibited by dominant negative JunD and augmented by JunD/JunD homodimers. Short interfering RNA against JunD inhibited MMP-7 mRNA expression in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines. These results suggest that the induction of MMP-7 by Tax is regulated by JunD and that MMP-7 could facilitate visceral invasion in ATL.

Abstract: Ca2+ plays a central role in energy supply and demand matching in cardiomyocytes by transmitting changes in excitation–contraction coupling to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Matrix Ca2+ is controlled primarily by the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter and the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, influencing NADH production through Ca2+-sensitive dehydrogenases in the Krebs cycle. In addition to the well-accepted role of the Ca2+-triggered mitochondrial permeability transition pore in cell death, it has been proposed that the permeability transition pore might also contribute to physiological mitochondrial Ca2+ release. Here we selectively measure Ca2+ influx rate through the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter and Ca2+ efflux rates through Na+-dependent and Na+-independent pathways in isolated guinea pig heart mitochondria in the presence or absence of inhibitors of mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (CGP 37157) or the permeability transition pore (cyclosporine A). cyclosporine A suppressed the negative bioenergetic consequences (ΔΨm loss, Ca2+ release, NADH oxidation, swelling) of high extramitochondrial Ca2+ additions, allowing mitochondria to tolerate total mitochondrial Ca2+ loads of >400nmol/mg protein. For Ca2+ pulses up to 15μM, Na+-independent Ca2+ efflux through the permeability transition pore accounted for ~5% of the total Ca2+ efflux rate compared to that mediated by the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (in 5mM Na+). Unexpectedly, we also observed that cyclosporine A inhibited mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger-mediated Ca2+ efflux at higher concentrations (IC50=2μM) than those required to inhibit the permeability transition pore, with a maximal inhibition of ~40% at 10μM cyclosporine A, while having no effect on the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter. The results suggest a possible alternative mechanism by which cyclosporine A could affect mitochondrial Ca2+ load in cardiomyocytes, potentially explaining the paradoxical toxic effects of cyclosporine A at high concentrations.

Abstract: ALG-2 is a highly conserved calcium binding protein in the cytoplasm which belongs to the family of penta-EF hand proteins. Recently, we showed that ALG-2 is interacting with RBM22, a highly conserved spliceosomal nuclear protein (Montaville et al. Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1763, 1335, 2006; Krebs, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1793, 979, 2009). In NIH 3T3 cells expressing both proteins a significant amount of ALG-2mRFP is translocated to the nucleus due to the interaction with RBM22-EGFP. hSlu7, another spliceosomal nuclear protein, known to interact with RBM22 in yeast, has been shown to translocate to the cytoplasm under cellular stress conditions. Here we provide evidence that the 2 spliceosomal proteins differ significantly in their subcellular distributions under stress conditions, and that RBM22 enhances the cytoplasmic translocation of hSlu7 under stress, especially a stress induced by thapsigargin. On the other hand, in NIH 3T3 cells expressing RBM22-EGFP and ALG-2-mRFP, ALG-2 remains translocated into the nucleus under both stress conditions, i.e. heat shock or treatment with thapsigargin. We could further demonstrate that these stress conditions had a different influence on the splicing pattern of XBP-1, a marker for the unfolded protein response indicating that ER stress may play a role in stress-induced translocation of spliceosomal proteins. The article is part of a Special Issue entitled: 11th European Symposium on Calcium.

Abstract: Myogenic differentiation is an essential process for the myogenesis in response to various extracellular stimuli. p38 MAPK is a core signalling molecule in myogenic differentiation. The activation of p38 MAPK is required for myogenic differentiation; however, the mechanism for this activation remains undefined. ASK1 is a member of the MAP3K family that activates both JNK and p38 MAPK pathways in response to an array of stresses such as oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress and calcium influx. Here, we reported that TNFα was significantly released from H9c2 cardiac myoblast in differentiation medium. Furthermore, the oxidant H2O2 acted as a messenger in the TNFα signalling pathway to disrupt the complex of ASK1–Trx, which was followed by the activation of ASK1 in cardiac myogenic differentiation. Subsequently, the activated ASK1 stimulated MKK3/6–p38MAPK signalling cascade to induce specific myogenic differentiation. In addition, exogenous TNFα added to the medium at physiological levels enhanced the ASK1–p38 MAPK signalling pathway through the increased generation of H2O2. Interestingly, inhibition of p38 MAPK abrogated the production of H2O2, suggesting that there might be a positive feedback loop in the myogenic–redox signalling pathway. These results indicate that ASK1 is a new intracellular regulator of activation of the p38 MAPK in cardiac myogenic differentiation.

Abstract: Local movements of receptors in the plasma membrane have been extensively studied, as it is generally believed that the dynamics of membrane distribution of receptors regulate their functions. However, the properties of large-scale (>5μm) receptor movements in the membrane are relatively obscure. In the present study, we addressed the question as to whether the large-scale movement of receptor in the plasma membrane at the whole cell level can be explained quantitatively by its local diffusive properties. We used HEK 293 cells transfected with human β2-adrenoceptor fused to photoconvertible fluorescent protein dendra2 as a model system; and found that 1) functional integrity of the dendra2-tagged receptor remains apparently intact; 2) in a mesoscopic scale (~4μm), ~90% of the receptors are mobile on average, and receptor influx to, and out-flux from a membrane area can be symmetrically explained by a diffusion-like process with an effective diffusion coefficient of ~0.1μm2/s; 3) these mobility parameters are not affected by the activity state of the receptor (assessed by using constitutively active receptor mutants); 4) in the macroscopic scale (4–40μm), although a slowly diffusing fraction of receptors (with D<0.01μm2/s) is identifiable in some cases, the movement of the predominant fraction is perfectly explained by the same effective diffusion process observed in the mesoscopic scale, suggesting that the large scale structure of the cell membrane as felt by the receptor is apparently homogeneous in terms of its mesoscopic properties. We also showed that intracellular compartments and plasma membrane are kinetically connected even at steady-state.

Abstract: In most target tissues, the adenylyl cyclase/cAMP/PKA, the extracellular signal regulated kinase and the protein kinase B/Akt are the main pathways employed by the type 2 corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor to mediate the biological actions of urocortins (Ucns) and CRH. To decipher the molecular determinants of CRH-R2 signaling, we studied the signaling pathways in HEK293 cells overexpressing recombinant human CRH-R2β receptors. Use of specific kinase inhibitors showed that the CRH-R2β cognate agonist, Ucn 2, activated extracellular signal regulated kinase in a phosphoinositide 3-kinase and cyclic adenosine monophosphate/PKA-dependent manner with contribution from Epac activation. Ucn 2 also induced PKA-dependent association between AKAP250 and CRH-R2β that appeared to be necessary for extracellular signal regulated kinase activation. PKB/Akt activation was also mediated via pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins and PI3-K activation but did not require cAMP/PKA, Epac or protein kinase C for optimal activation. Potential feedback mechanisms that target the CRH-R2β itself and modulate receptor trafficking and endocytosis were also investigated. Indeed, our results suggested that inhibition of either PKA or extracellular signal regulated kinase pathway accelerates CRH-R2β endocytosis. Furthermore, Ucn 2-activated extracellular signal regulated kinase appeared to target β-arrestin1 and modulate, through phosphorylation at Ser412, β-arrestin1 translocation to the plasma membrane and CRH-R2β internalization kinetics. Loss of this “negative feedback” mechanism through inhibition of the extracellular signal regulated kinase activity resulted in significant attenuation of Ucn 2-induced cAMP response, whereas Akt phosphorylation was not affected by altered receptor endocytosis. These findings reveal a complex interplay between the signaling molecules that allow “fine-tuning” of CRH-R2β functional responses and regulate signal integration.

Abstract: In the last decades some reports reveal the neuropeptide neurotensin (NT) as an immune mediator in the Central Nervous System and in the gastrointestinal tract, however its effects on skin immunity were not identified. The present study investigates the effect of NT on signal transduction and on pro/anti-inflammatory function of skin dendritic cells. Furthermore, we investigated how neurotensin can modulate the inflammatory responses triggered by LPS in skin dendritic cells. We observed that fetal-skin dendritic cells (FSDCs) constitutively express NTR1 and NTR3 (neurotensin receptors) and that LPS treatment induces neurotensin expression. In addition, NT downregulated the activation of the inflammatory signaling pathways NF-κB and JNK, as well as, the expression of the cytokines IL-6, TNF-α, IL-10 and the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), while the survival pathway ERK and epidermal growth factor (EGF) were upregulated. Simultaneous dendritic cells exposure to LPS and NT induced a similar cytokine profile to that one induced by NT alone. However, cells pre-treated with NT and then incubated with LPS, completely changed their cytokine profile, upregulating the cytokines tested, without changes on growth factor expression. Overall, our results could open new perspectives in the design of new therapies for skin diseases, like diabetic wound healing, where neuropeptide exposure seems to be beneficial.

Abstract: The TCR signal transduction is initiated by the activation of Src-family kinases (SFK) which phosphorylate Immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAM) present in the intracellular parts of the T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling subunits. Numerous data suggest that after stimulation TCR interacts with membrane rafts and thus it gains access to SFK and other important molecules involved in signal transduction. However, the precise mechanism of this process is unclear. One of the key questions is how SFK access TCR and what is the importance of non-raft and membrane raft-associated SFK for the initiation and maintenance of the TCR signaling. To answer this question we targeted a negative regulator of SFK, C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) to membrane rafts, recently described “heavy rafts” or non-raft membrane. Our data show that only Csk targeted into “classical” raft but not to “heavy raft” or non-raft membrane effectively inhibits TCR signaling, demonstrating the critical role of membrane raft-associated SFK in this process.

Abstract: Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignancy of bone and patients often develop pulmonary metastases. Despite the advances in surgical and medical management, the mechanisms underlying human osteosarcoma progression and metastasis remain to be elucidated. Gene expression profiles were compared by the cDNA microarray technique between two different human osteosarcoma sublines, MNNG/HOS and 143B, which differ greatly in spontaneous pulmonary metastatic potential. Here we report an enhanced expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 in the highly metastatic human osteosarcoma cell line 143B. Moreover, the in vitro invasion activity of 143B cells was MMP-1-dependent. The activator protein (AP)-1 binding site in the MMP-1 gene promoter was required for the constitutive expression of MMP-1 in 143B cells. Two AP-1 components, c-Jun and Fra-1, were phosphorylated, and bound to the AP-1 binding site of the MMP-1 promoter in 143B cells. Activated c-Jun and Fra-1 were essential for MMP-1 gene expression in 143B cells. Mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways including the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase activate c-Jun and Fra-1 and thereby regulate c-Jun/Fra-1 mediated events, establishing the mitogen-activated protein kinase/AP-1/MMP-1 axis as important in 143B cells. These data suggest that MMP-1 plays a central role in osteosarcoma invasion. Accordingly, MMP-1 might be a biomarker and therapeutic target for invasive osteosarcomas and pulmonary metastases.

Abstract: Mitochondria play central roles in cell life as a source of energy and in cell death by inducing apoptosis. Many important functions of mitochondria change in cancer, and these organelles can be a target of chemotherapy. The widely used anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) causes cell death, inhibition of cell cycle/proliferation and mitochondrial impairment. However, the mechanism of such impairment is not completely understood. In our study we used confocal and two-photon fluorescence imaging together with enzymatic and respirometric analysis to study short- and long-term effects of doxorubicin on mitochondria in various human carcinoma cells. We show that short-term (<30 min) effects include i) rapid changes in mitochondrial redox potentials towards a more oxidized state (flavoproteins and NADH), ii) mitochondrial depolarization, iii) elevated matrix calcium levels, and iv) mitochondrial ROS production, demonstrating a complex pattern of mitochondrial alterations. Significant inhibition of mitochondrial endogenous and uncoupled respiration, ATP depletion and changes in the activities of marker enzymes were observed after 48 h of DOX treatment (long-term effects) associated with cell cycle arrest and death.

Abstract: In the present study, we describe the role of cytoplasmic terminal (C-tail) domain in regulating coupling to adenylyl cyclase, signaling, and apoptosis in human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells transfected with wild type (wt)-hSSTR3 and C-tail deleted mutants. Cells transfected with wt-hSSTR3 and C-tail mutants show comparable membrane expression; however, display decreased expression in presence of agonist. wt-hSSTR3 exists as preformed homodimer at cell surface in basal conditions and decreases in response to agonist. Cells expressing C-tail mutants also show evidence of homodimerization with the same intensity as wt-hSSTR3. The agonist-dependent inhibition of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) was lost in cells expressing C-tail mutants. Agonist treatment in cells expressing wt-hSSTR3 resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation, increased expression of PARP-1, and TUNEL positivity in proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells. The agonist mediated increase in membrane expression of protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) seen with wt-hSSTR3 was diminished in C-tail mutants, which was accompanied with the loss of receptor's ability to induce apoptosis. Taken together, our data provide new insights into C-tail-dependent regulation of cell signaling and apoptosis by hSSTR3.

Abstract: BCR-ABL kinase activates downstream signaling pathways, including the PI3K-Akt/mTOR and the MAPK pathway. IRS1 has been previously described as constitutively phosphorylated and associated with BCR-ABL in K562 cells, suggesting that IRS1 has role in the BCR-ABL signaling pathways. In this study, we analyzed the effect of IRS1 silencing, by shRNA-lentiviral delivery, in K562 cells, a CML cell line that presents the BCR-ABL. IRS1 silencing decreased cell proliferation and colony formation in K562 cells, which correlates with the delay of these cells at the G0/G1 phase and a decrease in the S phase of the cell cycle. Furthermore, IRS1 silencing in K562 cells resulted in a decrease of Akt, P70S6K and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Nevertheless, apoptosis was unaffected by IRS1 knockdown and no alterations were found in the phosphorylation of BAD and in the expression of BCL2 and BAX. BCR-ABL and CRKL phosphorylation levels remained unaffected upon IRS1 silencing, and no synergistic effect was observed with imatinib treatment and IRS1 knockdown, indicating that IRS1 is downstream from BCR-ABL. In conclusion, we demonstrated that inhibition of IRS1 is capable of inducing the downregulation of Akt/mTOR and MAPK pathways and further decreasing proliferation, and clonogenicity and induces to cell cycle delay at G0/G1 phase in BCR-ABL cells.

Abstract: The protein DLK2, highly homologous to DLK1, belongs to the EGF-like family of membrane proteins, which includes NOTCH receptors and their DSL-ligands. The molecular mechanisms by which DLK proteins regulate cell differentiation and proliferation processes are not fully established yet. In previous reports, we demonstrated that DLK1 interacts with itself and with specific EGF-like repeats of the NOTCH1 extracellular region involved in the binding to NOTCH1 canonical ligands. Moreover, the interaction of DLK1 with NOTCH1 caused an inhibition of basal NOTCH signaling in preadipocytes and mesenchymal multipotent cells. In this work, we demonstrate, for the first time, that DLK2 interacts with itself, with DLK1, and with the same NOTCH1 receptor region as DLK1 does. We demonstrate also that the interaction of DLK2 with NOTCH1 similarly results in an inhibition of NOTCH signaling in preadipocytes and Mouse Embryo fibloblasts. In addition, we demonstrate that a membrane DLK1 variant, lacking the sequence recognized by the protease TACE, also inhibits NOTCH signaling. Furthermore, both DLK1 and DLK2 are able to decrease NOTCH activity also when triggered by specific NOTCH ligands. However, the decrease in NOTCH signaling induced by overexpression of Dlk2 is reversed by the overexpression of Dlk1, and viceversa. We conclude that DLK1 and DLK2 act as inhibitory non-canonical protein ligands for the NOTCH1 receptor that modulate NOTCH signaling.

Abstract: Cultivation methods used to investigate microbial calorie restriction often result in carbon and energy starvation. This study aims to dissect cellular responses to calorie restriction and starvation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by using retentostat cultivation. In retentostats, cells are continuously supplied with a small, constant carbon and energy supply, sufficient for maintenance of cellular viability and integrity but insufficient for growth. When glucose-limited retentostats cultivated under extreme calorie restriction were subjected to glucose starvation, calorie-restricted and glucose-starved cells were found to share characteristics such as increased heat-shock tolerance and expression of quiescence-related genes. However, they also displayed strikingly different features. While calorie-restricted yeast cultures remained metabolically active and viable for prolonged periods of time, glucose starvation resulted in rapid consumption of reserve carbohydrates, population heterogeneity due to appearance of senescent cells and, ultimately, loss of viability. Moreover, during starvation, calculated rates of ATP synthesis from reserve carbohydrates were 2–3 orders of magnitude lower than steady-state ATP-turnover rates calculated under extreme calorie restriction in retentostats. Stringent reduction of ATP turnover during glucose starvation was accompanied by a strong down-regulation of genes involved in protein synthesis. These results demonstrate that extreme calorie restriction and carbon starvation represent different physiological states in S. cerevisiae.

Abstract: It is very challenging and complicated to predict protein locations at the sub-subcellular level. The key to enhancing the prediction quality for protein sub-subcellular locations is to grasp the core features of a protein that can discriminate among proteins with different subcompartment locations. In this study, a different formulation of pseudoamino acid composition by the approach of discrete wavelet transform feature extraction was developed to predict submitochondria and subchloroplast locations. As a result of jackknife cross-validation, with our method, it can efficiently distinguish mitochondrial proteins from chloroplast proteins with total accuracy of 98.8% and obtained a promising total accuracy of 93.38% for predicting submitochondria locations. Especially the predictive accuracy for mitochondrial outer membrane and chloroplast thylakoid lumen were 82.93% and 82.22%, respectively, showing an improvement of 4.88% and 27.22% when other existing methods were compared. The results indicated that the proposed method might be employed as a useful assistant technique for identifying sub-subcellular locations. We have implemented our algorithm as an online service called SubIdent (http://bioinfo.ncu.edu.cn/services.aspx).

Abstract: Membrane fusion between the lamellar bodies and plasma membrane is an obligatory event in the secretion of lung surfactant. Previous studies have postulated a role for annexin A7 (A7) in membrane fusion during exocytosis in some cells including alveolar type II cells. However, the intracellular trafficking of A7 during such fusion is not described. In this study, we investigated association of endogenous A7 with lamellar bodies in alveolar type II cells following treatment with several secretagogues of lung surfactant. Biochemical studies with specific antibodies showed increased membrane-association of cell A7 in type II cells stimulated with agents that increase secretion through different signaling mechanisms. Immuno-fluorescence studies showed increased co-localization of A7 with ABCA3, the lamellar body marker protein. Because these agents increase surfactant secretion through activation of PKC and PKA, we also investigated the effects of PKC and PKA inhibitors, bisindolylmaleimideI (BisI) and H89, respectively, on A7 partitioning. Western blot analysis showed that these inhibitors prevented secretagogue-mediated A7 increase in the membrane fractions. These inhibitors also blocked increased co-localization of A7 with ABCA3 in secretagogue-treated cells, as revealed by immuno-fluorescence studies. In vitro studies with recombinant A7 showed phosphorylation with PKC and PKA. The cell A7 was also phosphorylated in cells treated with surfactant secretagogues. Thus, our studies demonstrate that annexin A7 relocates to lamellar bodies in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. We suggest that activation of protein kinase promotes phosphorylation and membrane-association of A7 presumably to facilitate membrane fusion during lung surfactant secretion.

Abstract: FoxO3 is a member of FoxO family transcription factors that mediate cellular functions downstream of AKT. FoxO3 phosphorylation by AKT generates binding sites for 14-3-3, which in-turn regulates FoxO3 transcriptional activity and localization. We examine here the functional significance of AKT–FoxO3 interaction and further detail the mechanistic aspects of FoxO3 regulation by AKT and 14-3-3. Our data show that AKT overexpression increases the steady-state levels of FoxO3 protein in a manner dependent on AKT activity and its ability to bind FoxO3. Characterization of the AKT–FoxO3 interaction shows that the three AKT phosphorylation-site-recognition motifs (RxRxxS/T) present on FoxO3, which are required for FoxO3 phosphorylation, are dispensable for AKT binding, suggesting that AKT has a docking point on FoxO3 distinct from the phosphorylation-recognition motifs. Development of a FoxO3 mutant deficient in 14-3-3 binding (P34A), which can be phosphorylated by AKT, established that 14-3-3 binding and not AKT phosphorylation per se controls FoxO3 transcriptional activity. Intriguingly, 14-3-3 binding was found to stabilize FoxO3 by inhibiting its dephosphorylation and degradation rates. Collectively, our data support a model where both AKT and 14-3-3 positively regulate FoxO3 in addition to their established negative roles and that 14-3-3 availability could dictate the fate of phosphorylated FoxO3 toward degradation or recycling.

Abstract: In order to generate neural stem cells with increased ability to survive after transplantation in brain parenchyma we developed a chimeric receptor (ChR) that binds to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) via its ectodomain and activates the insulin-like growth factor receptor type 1 ‎‎(IGF1R) signalling cascade. Activation of this pro-survival pathway in response to ligand broadly available in the brain might increase neuroregenerative potential of transplanted precursors. The ChR was produced by fusing a MOG-specific single ‎chain antibody with the extracellular boundary of the IGF1R transmembrane segment. The ChR is expressed on the cellular surface, predominantly as a monomer, and is not N-glycosylated. To show MOG-dependent functionality of the ChR, neuroblastoma cells B104 expressing this ChR were stimulated with monolayers of cells expressing recombinant MOG. The ChR undergoes MOG-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation and homodimerisation. It promotes insulin and IGF-independent growth of the oligodendrocyte progenitor cell line CG4. The proposed mode of the ChR activation is by MOG-induced dimerisation which promotes kinase domain transphosphorylation, by-passing the requirement of conformation changes known to be important for IGF1R activation. Another ChR, which contains a segment of the β-chain ectodomain, was produced in an attempt to recapitulate some of these conformational changes, but proved non-functional.

Abstract: Scutellaria baicalensis (SB) and SB-derived polyphenols possess anti-proliferative activities in several cancers, including pancreatic cancer (PaCa). However, the precise molecular mechanisms have not been fully defined. SB extract and SB-derived polyphenols (wogonin, baicalin, and baicalein) were used to determine their anti-proliferative mechanisms. Baicalein significantly inhibited the proliferation of PaCa cell lines in a dose-dependent manner, whereas wogonin and baicalin exhibited a much less robust effect. Treatment with baicalein induced apoptosis with release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, and activation of caspase-3 and -7 and PARP. The general caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk reversed baicalein-induced apoptosis, indicating a caspase-dependent mechanism. Baicalein decreased expression of Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family, presumably through a transcriptional mechanism. Genetic knockdown of Mcl-1 resulted in marked induction of apoptosis. The effect of baicalein on apoptosis was significantly attenuated by Mcl-1 over-expression, suggesting a critical role of Mcl-1 in this process. Our results provide evidence that baicalein induces apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells through down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein.

Abstract: Background
Neurite outgrowth is an important aspect of neuronal plasticity and regeneration after neuronal injury. Alpha-lipoic acid (LA) has been used as a therapeutic approach for a variety of neural disorders. We recently reported that LA prevents local anesthetics-induced neurite loss. In this study, we hypothesized that LA administration promotes neurite outgrowth.
Methods
To test our hypothesis, we treated mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells and primary neurons with LA. Neurite outgrowth was evaluated by examination of morphological changes and by immunocytochemistry for β-tubulin-3. ROS production was examined, as were the phosphorylation levels of ERK and Akt. In separate experiments, we determined the effects of the inhibition of ERK or PI3K/Akt as well as ROS production on LA-induced neurite outgrowth.
Results
LA promoted significantly neurite outgrowth in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. LA stimulation significantly increased the phosphorylation levels of both Akt and ERK and transiently induced ROS production. PI3K/Akt inhibition did not affect LA-induced neurite outgrowth. However, the inhibition of ERK activation completely abolished LA-induced neurite outgrowth. Importantly, the prevention of ROS production by antioxidants attenuated LA-stimulated ERK activation and completely abolished LA-promoted neurite outgrowth.
Conclusion
Our data suggest that LA stimulates neurite outgrowth through the activation of ERK signaling, an effect mediated through a ROS-dependent mechanism.

Abstract: Parathyroid hormone (PTH) functions as a major mediator of bone remodeling and as an essential regulator of calcium homeostasis. In this study, we investigated the role of PTH in the regulation of the cell cycle in human colon adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cells. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that PTH (10−8M, 12–24h) treatment increases the number of cells in the G0/G1 phase and diminishes the number in both phases S and G2/M. In addition, analysis by Western blot showed that the hormone increases the expression of the inhibitory protein p27Kip1 and diminishes the expression of cyclin D1, cyclin D3 and CDK6. However, the amounts of CDK4, p21Cip1, p15INK4B and p16INK4A were not different in the absence or presence of PTH. Inhibitors of PKC (Ro-318220, bisindolylmaleimide and chelerythine), but not JNK (SP600125) and PP2A (okadaic acid and calyculin A), reversed PTH response in Caco-2 cells. Taken together, our results suggest that PTH induces G0/G1 phase arrest of Caco-2 intestinal cells and changes the expression of proteins involved in cell cycle regulation via the PKC signaling pathway.

Abstract: A balance between the proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein APP through the amyloidogenic and the non-amyloidogenic pathways controls the production and release of amyloid β-protein, whose accumulation in the brain is associated to the onset of Alzheimer Disease. APP is also expressed on circulating platelets. The regulation of APP processing in these cells is poorly understood. In this work we show that platelets store considerable amounts of APP fragments, including sAPPα, that can be released upon stimulation of platelets. Moreover, platelet stimulation also promotes the proteolysis of intact APP expressed on the cell surface. This process is supported by an ADAM metalloproteinase, and causes the release of sAPPα. Processing of intact platelet APP is promoted also by treatment with calmodulin antagonist W7. W7-induced APP proteolysis occurs through the non-amyloidogenic pathway, is mediated by a metalloproteinase, and causes the release of sAPPα. Co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down experiments revealed a physical association between calmodulin and APP. These results document a novel role of calmodulin in the regulation of non-amyloidogenic processing of APP.

ERp29 regulates response to doxorubicin by a PERK-mediated mechanism,

Abstract: ERp29 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) luminal protein with a putative secretion factor/escort chaperone function. Accumulated evidence has implicated ERp29 in the thyroglobulin secretion, polyoma virus transport and recently in carcinogenesis. ERp29 levels were elevated in the tumors of various origins and under the conditions of genotoxic stress, such as ionizing radiation. Here we report the induction of ERp29 during the treatment of cells with doxorubicin, a commonly used antineoplastic agent. Experiments in the p53 −/− cells and p53 knockout mouse revealed that doxorubicin effect on ERp29 is p53 dependent. The increase of ERp29 level appears to activate a negative feedback loop where the elevated amounts of ERp29 augment cell viability as shown by a clonogenic cell survival assay. To elucidate the mechanisms behind the doxorubicin effects we have studied the impact of ERp29 on the interaction with the ER stress-activated eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-alpha kinase 3 (PERK) that was shown to facilitate tumor cells' resistance to drug toxicity. Co-immunoprecipitation demonstrated physical interaction of ERp29 with PERK and moreover, overexpression of ERp29 enhanced endogenous levels of PERK. Our results identify ERp29 as a novel regulator of PERK and provide evidence for the role of ER resident factors in the regulation of chemotherapeutic efficacy. These findings show that PERK may represent a nodal point between ER stress and chemotherapeutic response.

Abstract: Bcl-2 plays a prominent role in regulating the function of mitochondria during respiration and in determining the threshold of apoptotic sensitivity. Despite its relevance, the mechanism through which these processes are achieved is still unknown. Using surface plasmon resonance technology to monitor Bcl-2 multimerisation we discovered that a simple dimeric model does not fit with experimental data. A molecular model of the experimentally observed Bcl-2 homomeric complex has been developed. Accordingly, using a panel of mutants we identified in the loop a critical region for the process of Bcl-2 multimerisation. Our results indicate that the Bcl-2 loop posttranscriptional changes can modulate its ability to make homo and hetero-complexes, ultimately leading to functional modulation, suggesting an intriguing relationship between the ability of Bcl-2 to form multimeric complexes and its multi-functional role as a membrane channel.

eNOS activation mediated by AMPK after stimulation of endothelial cells with histamine or thrombin is dependent on LKB1,

Abstract: Reports on the role of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in thrombin-mediated activation of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) in endothelial cells have been conflicting. Previously, we have shown that under culture conditions that allow reduction of ATP-levels after stimulation, activation of AMPK contributes to eNOS phosphorylation and activation in endothelial cells after treatment with thrombin. In this paper we examined the signaling pathways mediating phosphorylation and activation of eNOS after stimulation of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) with histamine and the role of LKB1-AMPK in the signaling. In Morgan's medium 199 intracellular ATP was lowered by treatment with histamine or the ionophore A23187 while in medium RMPI 1640 ATP was unchanged after identical treatment. In medium 199 inhibition of Ca+2/CaM kinase kinase (CaMKK) by STO-609 only partially inhibited AMPK phosphorylation but after gene silencing of LKB1 with siRNA there was a total inhibition of AMPK phosphorylation by STO-609 after treatment with either histamine or thrombin, demonstrating phosphorylation of AMPK by both upstream kinases, LKB1 and CaMKK. Downregulation of AMPK with siRNA partially inhibited eNOS phosphorylation caused by histamine in cells maintained in medium 199. Downregulation of LKB1 by siRNA inhibited both phosphorylation and activity of eNOS and addition of the AMPK inhibitor Compound C had no further effect on eNOS phosphorylation. When experiments were carried out in medium 1640, STO-609 totally prevented the phosphorylation of AMPK without affecting eNOS phosphorylation. AMPKα2 downregulation resulted in a loss of the integrity of the endothelial monolayer and increased expression of GRP78, indicative of endoplasmic reticular (ER) stress. Downregulation of AMPKα1 had no such effect. The results show that culture conditions affect endothelial signal transduction pathways after histamine stimulation. Under conditions where intracellular ATP is lowered by histamine, AMPK is activated by both LKB1 and CaMKK and, in turn, mediates eNOS phosphorylation in an LKB1 dependent manner. Both AMPKα1 and −α2 are involved in the signaling. Under conditions where intracellular ATP is unchanged after histamine treatment, CaMKK alone activates AMPK and eNOS is phosphorylated and activated independent of AMPK.
