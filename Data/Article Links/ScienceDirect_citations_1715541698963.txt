Abstract: Neuregulins are growth factors that signal via the ErbB3 and ErbB4 receptors. Here we show using immunohistochemistry that they are often expressed in the nucleus of a range of tumour types including soft tissue and breast. The Neuregulin 1 type I-β3 (NRG1-β3) isoform localises to two sub-nuclear compartments in animal cells, nucleoli and spliceosomes. We used NRG1-β3 tagged with photoactivatable GFP and demonstrated that this re-localised from nucleoli to spliceosomes over 90min. Tyrosine kinase activity was not required for retaining the NRG1-β3 within the nucleus. Mutation of the lysines 14 and 16 or 15 and 16 together prevented nucleolar uptake while four positively charged residues were identified which were required for spliceosome uptake. Molecular modelling suggests that three of these may form a binding site. We showed using a kinome array that NRG1-β3 and a mutant exclusively localising to spliceosomes increased phosphorylation and/or expression of the HER4 and HER2 receptors. Using a transcriptomic analysis the same two constructs induced expression of several messenger RNAs and we confirmed the increased expression at the protein level of the most highly induced, Heat Shock Protein 70B′. These results suggest that Neuregulin activates receptor signalling in spliceosomes leading to altered gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae are members of the normal human nasal microbiota with the ability to cause invasive infections. Bacterial invasion requires translocation across the epithelium; however, mechanistic understanding of this process is limited. Examining the epithelial response to murine colonization by S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, we observed the TLR-dependent downregulation of claudins 7 and 10, tight junction components key to the maintenance of epithelial barrier integrity. When modeled in vitro, claudin downregulation was preceded by upregulation of SNAIL1, a transcriptional repressor of tight junction components, and these phenomena required p38 MAPK and TGF-β signaling. Consequently, downregulation of SNAIL1 expression inhibited bacterial translocation across the epithelium. Furthermore, disruption of epithelial barrier integrity by claudin 7 inhibition in vitro or TLR stimulation in vivo promoted bacterial translocation. These data support a general mechanism for epithelial opening exploited by invasive pathogens to facilitate movement across the epithelium to initiate disease.

Abstract: Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), a multifunctional kinase, is a regulator of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated septic shock. Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is also required for LPS-induced activation of p38, which is a crucial determinant for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in endotoxemia. Here, we show that attenuation of endotoxemia induced by GSK-3 inhibition is caused by the ASK1 reduction-mediated inhibition of p38, a representative downstream kinase of ASK1. LPS-stimulated activation of p38 was blocked by the reduction of ASK1 via the knockdown of GSK-3β. In addition, compared with L929 control cells, ASK1 protein was reduced in L929 cells stably expressing Wnt-3a and in which β-catenin was active, due to the inhibition of GSK-3β activity. GSK-3β inhibition-mediated ASK1 reduction was also confirmed by reduced ASK1 in GSK-3β-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) and MCF7 GSK-3β siRNA cells. Furthermore, ASK1 protein stability was also attenuated in MCF7 GSK-3β siRNA cells compared with GFP control cells. Consistent with stability data, a much stronger ubiquitination of ASK1 was observed in cells in which GSK-3β was knocked down. These findings suggest that GSK-3β crosstalks with p38 kinase via the regulation of ASK1 protein stability in endotoxemia.

Abstract: The Notch signaling pathway plays important roles in tumorigenesis in a context-dependent manner. In human cervical cancer, alterations in Notch signaling have been reported, and both tumor-suppressing and tumor-promoting roles of Notch signaling have been proposed; however, the precise molecular mechanisms governing these roles in cervical cancer remain controversial. MAML is a transcriptional co-activator originally identified by its role in Notch signaling. Recent evidence suggests that it also plays a role in other signaling pathways, such as the p53 and β-catenin pathways. MAML is required for stable formation of Notch transcriptional complexes at the promoters of Notch target genes. Chromosomal translocations affecting MAML have been shown to promote tumorigenesis. In this study, we used a truncated dominant-negative MAML1 (DN-MAML) to investigate the role of MAML in HPV-positive cervical cancer cell lines. Three human cervical cancer cell lines (HeLa, SiHa and CaSki) expressed all Notch receptors and the Notch target genes Hes1 and MAML1. Among these 3 cell lines, constitutive appearance of cleaved Notch1 was found only in CaSki cells, which suggests that Notch1 is constitutively activated in this cell line. Gamma secretase inhibitor (GSI) treatment, which suppresses Notch receptor activation, completely abrogated this form of Notch1 but had no effect on cell viability. Overexpression of DN-MAML by retroviral transduction in CaSki cells resulted in significant decreases in the mRNA levels of Hes1 and Notch1 but had no effects on the levels of MAML1, p53 or HPV E6/E7. DN-MAML expression induced increased viability of CaSki cells without any effect on cell cycle progression or cell proliferation. In addition, clonogenic assay experiments revealed that overexpression of DN-MAML resulted in increased colony formation compared to the overexpression of the control vector. When the status of the NF-κB pathway was investigated, CaSki cells overexpressing DN-MAML exhibited loss of phospho-IκBα, decreased total IκBα and nuclear localization of NF-κB p65, which suggests that the NF-κB pathway is hyperactivated. Furthermore, increased level of cleaved Notch1 was detected when DN-MAML was expressed. When DN-MAML-overexpressing cells were treated with GSI, significantly decreased cell viability was observed, indicating that inhibition of Notch signaling using GSI treatment and DN-MAML expression negatively affects cell viability. Taken together, targeting Notch signaling using DN-MAML and GSI treatment may present a novel method to control cell viability in cervical cancer cells.

Abstract: Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is dysregulated in gastric cancer. The biologic function of mTORC1 in gastric carcinogenesis is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that disruption of mTORC1 function by RNA interference-mediated downregulation of raptor substantially inhibited gastric cancer cell proliferation through induction of G0/G1-phase cell cycle arrest. The anti-proliferative effect was accompanied by concomitant downregulation of activator protein-1 and upregulation of Smad2/3 transcriptional activities. In addition, the expression of cyclin D3 and p21Waf1, which stabilizes cyclin D/cdk4 complex for G1–S transition, was reduced by raptor knockdown. In conclusion, disruption of mTORC1 inhibits gastric cancer cell proliferation through multiple pathways. This discovery may have an implication in the application of mTORC1-directed therapy for the treatment of gastric cancer.

Abstract: It has been previously reported that serum levels of 70-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70) are elevated in peripheral artery disease. The aim of the present study was to examine whether increased serum Hsp70 levels are related to the extent of arterial calcification and standard laboratory parameters of patients with peripheral artery disease, as well as to markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein), atherosclerosis (homocysteine), and calcification (fetuin-a). One hundred eighty chronic atherosclerotic patients with significant carotid stenosis and/or lower extremity vascular disease were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Systemic atherosclerosis and calcification was assessed by ultrasound (carotid intima–media thickness (IMT), presence of calcification at the abdominal aorta, carotid and femoral bifurcations, and aortic and mitral cardiac valves). Standard serum markers of inflammation, diabetes, renal function, ankle-brachial indexes, and traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis were noted. Serum Hsp70 levels were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Standard laboratory parameters (clinical chemistry), C-reactive protein (CRP), and homocysteine levels were determined by an autoanalyzer using the manufacturer’s kits. Fetuin-a levels were measured by radial immunodiffusion. Patients’ median age was 64 (57–71) years, 69% were men, and 34.5% had diabetes. Serum heat shock protein 70 levels were significantly higher in patients with more severe arterial calcification (p < 0.02) and showed significant positive correlations with serum bilirubin (r = 0.23, p = 0.002) and homocysteine levels (r = 0.18, p = 0.02). Serum Hsp70 did not correlate with body mass index, IMT, CRP, or fetuin-a levels in this cohort. Logistic regression analysis confirmed the association between sHsp70 and calcification score (OR, 2.189; CI, 1.156–4.144, p = 0.016) and this correlation remained significant (OR, 2.264; CI, 1.021–5.020, p = 0.044) after the adjustment for age, sex, eGFR, smoking, CRP, and homocysteine levels. Our data show that serum Hsp70 levels correlate with the severity of atherosclerosis in patients with carotid artery disease and chronic lower limb ischemia. These data support a putative role for plasma Hsp70 in the development of arterial calcification. Nevertheless, further studies are required to investigate the usefulness of circulating Hsp70 level as a marker of atherosclerotic calcification.

Abstract: Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is a conserved molecular chaperone that functions as part of complexes in which different client proteins target it to diverse sets of substrates. In this paper, HSP90 complexes were investigated in γ-proteobacteria from mild (Shewanella oneidensis) and cold environments (Shewanella frigidimarina and Psychrobacter frigidicola), to determine changes in HSP90 interactions with client proteins in response to the adaptation to cold environments. HSP90 participation in cold adaptation was determined using the specific inhibitor 17-allylamino-geldanamycin. Then, HSP90 was immunoprecipitated from bacterial cultures, and the proteins in HSP90 complexes were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. According to HSP90-associated protein analysis, only 15 common proteins were found in both species from the same genus, S. oneidensis and S. frigidimarina, whereas a significant higher number of common proteins were found in both psychrophilic species S. frigidimarina and P. frigidicola 21 (p < 0.001). Only two HSP90-interacting proteins, the chaperone proteins DnaK and GroEL, were common to the three species. Interestingly, some proteins related to energy metabolism (isocitrate lyase, succinyl-CoA synthetase, alcohol dehydrogenase, NAD(+) synthase, and malate dehydrogenase) and some translation factors only interacted with HSP90 in psychrophilic bacteria. We can conclude that HSP90 and HSP90-associated proteins might take part in the mechanism of adaptation to cold environments, and interestingly, organisms living in similar environments conserve similar potential HSP90 interactors in opposition to phylogenetically closely related organisms of the same genus but from different environments.

Abstract: Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a 125-kDa non-receptor type tyrosine kinase that localizes to focal adhesions. FAK overexpression is frequently found in invasive and metastatic cancers of the breast, colon, thyroid, and prostate, but its role in osteolytic metastasis is not well understood. In this study, we have analyzed anti-tumor effects of the novel FAK Tyr397 inhibitor TAE226 against bone metastasis in breast cancer by using TAE226. Oral administration of TAE226 in mice significantly decreased bone metastasis and osteoclasts involved which were induced by MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and increased the survival rate of the mouse models of bone metastasis. TAE226 also suppressed the growth of subcutaneous tumors in vivo and the proliferation and migration of MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro. Significantly, TAE226 inhibited the osteoclast formation in murine pre-osteoclastic RAW264.7 cells, and actin ring and pit formation in mature osteoclasts. Moreover, TAE226 inhibited the receptor activator for nuclear factor κ B Ligand (RANKL) gene expression induced by parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) in bone stromal ST2 cells and blood free calcium concentration induced by PTHrP administration in vivo. These findings suggest that FAK was critically involved in osteolytic metastasis and activated in tumors, pre-osteoclasts, mature osteoclasts, and bone stromal cells and TAE226 can be effectively used for the treatment of cancer induced bone metastasis and other bone diseases.

Abstract: Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1), an important regulator of intracellular pH (pHi) and extracellular pH (pHe), has been shown to play a key role in breast cancer metastasis. However, the exact mechanism by which NHE1 mediates breast cancer metastasis is not yet well known. We showed here that inhibition of NHE1 activity, with specific inhibitor Cariporide, could suppress MDA-MB-231 cells invasion as well as the activity and expression of MT1-MMP. Overexpression of MT1-MMP resulted in a distinguished increase in MDA-MB-231 cells invasiveness, but treatment with Cariporide reversed the MT1-MMP-mediated enhanced invasiveness. To explore the role of MAPK signaling pathways in NHE1-mediated breast cancer metastasis, we compared the difference of constitutively phosphorylated ERK1/2, p38 MAPK and JNK in non-invasive MCF-7 cells and invasive MDA-MB-231cells. Interestingly, we found that the phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK in MDA-MB-231 cells were higher than in MCF-7 cells, but both MCF-7 cells and MDA-MB-231 cells expressed similar constitutively phosphorylated JNK. Treating MDA-MB-231 cells with Cariporide led to decreased phosphorylation level of both p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 in a time-dependent manner, but JNK activity was not influenced. Supplementation with MAPK inhibitor (MEK inhibitor PD98059, p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 and JNK inhibitor SP600125) or Cariporide all exhibited significant depression of MDA-MB-231 cells invasion and MT1-MMP expression. Furthermore, we co-treated MDA-MB-231 cells with MAPK inhibitor and Cariporide. The result showed that Cariporide synergistically suppressed invasion and MT1-MMP expression with MEK inhibitor and p38 MAPK inhibitor, but not be synergistic with the JNK inhibitor. These findings suggest that NHE1 mediates MDA-MB-231 cells invasion partly through regulating MT1-MMP in ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK signaling pathways dependent manner.

Abstract: Until now, no data are present about the effect of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)α activation on the prototype Th1 [chemokine (C–X–C motif) ligand (CXCL)10] (CXCL10) and Th2 [chemokine (C–C motif) ligand 2] (CCL2) chemokines secretion in thyroid cells. The role of PPARα and PPARγ activation on CXCL10 and CCL2 secretion was tested in Graves' disease (GD) and control primary thyrocytes stimulated with interferon (IFN)γ and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α. IFNγ stimulated both CXCL10 and CCL2 secretion in primary GD and control thyrocytes. TNFα alone stimulated CCL2 secretion, while had no effect on CXCL10. The combination of IFNγ and TNFα had a synergistic effect both on CXCL10 and CCL2 chemokines in GD thyrocytes at levels comparable to those of controls. PPARα activators inhibited the secretion of both chemokines (stimulated with IFNγ and TNFα) at a level higher (for CXCL10, about 60–72%) than PPARγ agonists (about 25–35%), which were confirmed to inhibit CXCL10, but not CCL2. Our data show that CCL2 is modulated by IFNγ and TNFα in GD and normal thyrocytes. Furthermore we first show that PPARα activators inhibit the secretion of CXCL10 and CCL2 in thyrocytes, suggesting that PPARα may be involved in the modulation of the immune response in the thyroid.

Abstract: Heat shock proteins (hsp) have been found to play a fundamental role in the recovery from multiple stress conditions and to offer protection from subsequent insults. The function of hsp during stress goes beyond their intracellular localization and chaperone role as they have been detected outside cells activating signaling pathways. Extracellular hsp are likely to act as indicators of the stress conditions, priming other cells, particularly of the immune system, to avoid the propagation of the insult. Some extracellular hsp, for instance Hsp70, are associated with export vesicles, displaying a robust activation of macrophages. We have coined the term Stress Observation System (SOS) for the mechanism for sensing extracellular hsp, which we propose is a form of cellular communication during stress conditions. An enigmatic and still poorly understood process is the mechanism for the release of hsp, which do not contain any consensus secretory signal. The export of hsp appears to be a very complex phenomenon encompassing different alternative pathways. Moreover, extracellular hsp may not come in a single flavor, but rather in a variety of physical conditions. This review addresses some of our current knowledge about the release and function of extracellular hsp, in particular those associated with vesicles.

Abstract: Numb was originally identified as an important cell fate determinant that is asymmetrically inherited during mitosis and controls the fate of sibling cells by inhibiting the Notch signaling pathway in neural tissue. The small intestinal epithelium originates from the division of stem cells that reside in the crypt, which further differentiate into goblet cells, absorptive cells, paneth cells, and enteroendocrine cells. However, Numb's involvement in the differentiation process of intestinal epithelium is largely unknown. In the present study, we confirm that both the Numb mRNA and protein isoforms are expressed in adult mouse intestinal mucosa. Numb protein is ubiquitously expressed throughout the crypt–villus axis of the small intestinal epithelium and is mainly localized to the cytoplasmic membrane. Down-regulation of endogenous Numb using RNA interference in cultured intestinal LS174T cells increased Notch signaling, leading to the up-regulation of Hes1 and the down-regulation of Hath1. Knockdown of Numb alleviated MUC2 protein expression and led to loss of the goblet cell phenotype in LS174Tl cells. Our results provide the first evidence that Numb, an important cell fate determinant, modulates intestinal epithelial cells towards the goblet cell phenotype by inhibiting the Notch signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Tetherin (BST-2 or CD317) is an interferon-inducible transmembrane protein that inhibits virus release from infected cells. Whereas HIV-1 Vpu and HIV-2 Env counteract human tetherin, most SIVs use Nef to antagonize the tetherin proteins of their nonhuman primate hosts. Here, we show that compensatory changes in the cytoplasmic domain of SIV gp41, acquired by a nef-deleted virus that regained a pathogenic phenotype in infected rhesus macaques, restore resistance to tetherin. These changes facilitate virus release in the presence of rhesus tetherin, but not human tetherin, and enhance virus replication in interferon-treated primary lymphocytes. The substitutions in gp41 result in a selective physical association with rhesus tetherin, and the internalization and sequestration of rhesus tetherin by a mechanism that depends on a conserved endocytosis motif in gp41. These results are consistent with HIV-2 Env antagonism of human tetherin and suggest that the ability to oppose tetherin is important for lentiviral pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Pore-forming toxins (PFTs) secreted by pathogenic bacteria are the most common bacterial protein toxins and are important virulence factors for infection. PFTs punch holes in host cell plasma membranes, and although cells can counteract the resulting membrane damage, the underlying mechanisms at play remain unclear. Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model, we demonstrate in vivo and in an intact epithelium that intestinal cells respond to PFTs by increasing levels of endocytosis, dependent upon RAB-5 and RAB-11, which are master regulators of endocytic and exocytic events. Furthermore, we find that RAB-5 and RAB-11 are required for protection against PFT and to restore integrity to the plasma membrane. One physical mechanism involved is the RAB-11-dependent expulsion of microvilli from the apical side of the intestinal epithelial cells. Specific vesicle-trafficking pathways thus protect cells against an attack by PFTs on plasma membrane integrity, via altered plasma membrane dynamics.

Abstract: Phospholipase modulators have been shown to affect the topology of lipid bilayers and the formation of tubulo-vesicular structures, but the specific endogenous phospholipases involved have yet to be identified. Here we show that TRPML1 (MLN1), a Ca2+-permeable channel, contributes to membrane remodeling through a serine lipase consensus domain, and thus represents a novel type of bifunctional protein. Remarkably, this serine lipase active site determines the ability of MLN1 to generate tubulo-vesicular extensions in mucolipin-1-expressing oocytes, human fibroblasts and model membrane vesicles. Our demonstration that MLN1 is involved in membrane remodeling and the formation of extensions suggests that it may play a role in the formation of cellular processes linked to the late endosome/lysosome (LE/L) pathway. MLN1 is absent or mutated in patients with mucolipidosis IV (MLIV), a lysosomal disorder with devastating neurological and other consequences. This study provides potential insight into the pathophysiology of MLIV.

Abstract: The ability of cells to adhere, spread and migrate is essential to many physiological processes, particularly in the immune system where cells must traffic to sites of inflammation and injury. By altering the levels of individual components of the VAMP3/Stx4/SNAP23 complex we show here that this SNARE complex regulates efficient macrophage adhesion, spreading and migration on fibronectin. During cell spreading this complex mediates the polarised exocytosis of VAMP3-positive recycling endosome membrane into areas of membrane expansion, where VAMP3's surface partner Q-SNARE complex Stx4/SNAP23 was found to accumulate. Lowering the levels of VAMP3 in spreading cells resulted in a more rounded cell morphology and most cells were found to be devoid of the typical ring-like podosome superstructures seen normally in spreading cells. In migrating cells lowering VAMP3 levels disrupted the polarised localisation of podosome clusters. The reduced trafficking of recycling endosome membrane to sites of cell spreading and the disorganised podosome localisation in migrating macrophages greatly reduced their ability to persistently migrate on fibronectin. Thus, this important SNARE complex facilitates macrophage adhesion, spreading, and persistent macrophage migration on fibronectin through the delivery of VAMP3-positive membrane with its cargo to expand the plasma membrane and to participate in organising adhesive podosome structures.

Abstract: Gastric adenocarcinoma is a major health problem world-wide, as this is the second most common cause of cancer death in the world. It has been estimated that infection by Helicobacter pylori cause at least half of the gastric cancers. Previously, we have demonstrated that H. pylori antigens directly activate NK cells to secrete IFN-γ. There is also a marked synergistic effect in NK cells stimulated with bacterial lysate and low levels of IL-12, a cytokine which is produced by macrophages and dendritic cells in the H. pylori-infected stomach. The present study was designed to investigate whether NK cells from gastric cancer patients display an altered ability to respond to components from H. pylori and other bacteria. The results show that NK cells from peripheral blood of gastric cancer patients have a severely suppressed ability to produce IFN-γ after stimulation with H. pylori lysate and the synthetic bacterial lipoprotein FSL-1. Furthermore, the synergistic effect of IL-12 and lysate is absent in gastric cancer patients, unless the concentration of IL-12 is increased 10-fold. We also demonstrate that there is a similar lack of IFN-γ production from NK cells isolated from the gastric mucosa of cancer patients. In addition, we propose that the observed suppression is due to tumour-derived TGF-β and that increased expression of the transcription factor GATA-3 may be responsible for the TGF-β induced suppression.

Abstract: Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) support life-long spermatogenesis by self-renewing and producing spermatogonia committed to differentiation. In vitro, SSCs form three-dimensional spermatogonial aggregates (clusters) when cultured with glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2); serial passaging of clusters results in long-term SSC maintenance and expansion. However, the role of these growth factors in controlling patterns of SSC division and fate decision has not been understood thoroughly. We report here that in a short-term culture, GDNF and FGF2 increase the number of dividing SSCs, but not the total SSC number, compared to a no-growth-factor condition. Since the total germ cell number increases with growth factors, these results suggest that GDNF and FGF2 promote a SSC division pattern that sustains the size of the stem cell pool while generating committed progenitors. Our data also show that SSC numbers increase when the cluster structure is disintegrated and cell–cell interaction in clusters is disrupted. Collectively, these results suggest that in this culture system, GDNF and FGF2 stimulate SSC divisions that promote self-renewal and differentiation in the SSC population, and imply that the destruction of the cluster structure, a potential in vitro niche, may contribute to SSC expansion.

Abstract: Summary
Plants and animals have evolved structurally related innate immune sensors, designated NLRs, to detect intracellular nonself molecules. NLRs are modular, consisting of N-terminal coiled-coil (CC) or TOLL/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains, a central nucleotide-binding (NB) domain, and C-terminal leucine-rich repeats (LRRs). The polymorphic barley mildew A (MLA) locus encodes CC-containing allelic immune receptors recognizing effectors of the pathogenic powdery mildew fungus. We report the crystal structure of an MLA receptor's invariant CC domain, which reveals a rod-shaped homodimer. MLA receptors also self-associate in vivo, but self-association appears to be independent of effector-triggered receptor activation. MLA CC mutants that fail to self-interact impair in planta cell death activity triggered by the CC domain alone and by an autoactive full-length MLA receptor that mimics its ATP-bound state. Thus, CC domain-dependent dimerization of the immune sensor defines a minimal functional unit and implies a role for the dimeric CC module in downstream immune signaling.

Abstract: In a previous study investigating the effects of low temperature on skeletal muscle differentiation, we demonstrated that C2C12 mouse myoblasts cultured at 30°C do not express myogenin, a myogenic regulatory factor (MRF), or fuse into multinucleated myotubes. At this low temperature, the myoblasts continuously express Id3, a negative regulator of MRFs, and do not upregulate muscle-specific microRNAs. In this study, we examined if insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and a stable form of vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid phosphate) could alleviate the low temperature-induced inhibition of myogenic differentiation in C2C12 cells. Although the addition of either IGF-I or vitamin C alone could promote myogenin expression in C2C12 cells at 30°C, elongated multinucleated myotubes were not formed unless both IGF-I and vitamin C were continuously administered. In human skeletal muscle cells, low temperature-induced blockage of myogenic differentiation was also ameliorated by exogenous IGF-I and vitamin C. In addition, we demonstrated that satellite cells of IGF-I overexpressing transgenic mice in single-fiber culture expressed myogenin at a higher level than those of wild-type mice at 30°C. This study suggests that body temperature plays an important role in myogenic differentiation of endotherms, but the sensitivity to low temperature could be buffered by certain factors in vivo, such as IGF-I and vitamin C.

Abstract: Pten is the most frequently mutated gene in uterine endometriod carcinoma (UEC) and its precursor complex atypical hyperplasia (CAH). Because the mutation frequency is similar in CAH and UEC, Pten mutations are thought to occur relatively early in endometrial tumorigenesis. Previous work from our laboratory using the Pten+/− mouse model has demonstrated somatic inactivation of the wild type allele of Pten in both CAH and UEC. In the present study, we injected adenoviruses expressing Cre into the uterine lumen of adult Pten floxed mice in an attempt to somatically delete both alleles of Pten specifically in the endometrium. Our results demonstrate that biallelic inactivation of Pten results in an increased incidence of carcinoma as compared to the Pten+/− mouse model. In addition, the carcinomas were more aggressive with extension beyond the uterus into adjacent tissues and were associated with decreased expression of nuclear ERα as compared to associated CAH. Primary cultures of epithelial and stromal cells were prepared from uteri of Pten floxed mice and Pten was deleted in vitro using Cre expressing adenovirus. Pten deletion was evident in both the epithelial and stromal cells and the treatment of the primary cultures with estrogen had different effects on Akt activation as well as Cyclin D3 expression in the two purified components. This study demonstrates that somatic biallelic inactivation of Pten in endometrial epithelium in vivo results in an increased incidence and aggressiveness of endometrial carcinoma compared to mice carrying a germline deletion of one allele and provides an important in vivo and in vitro model system for understanding the genetic underpinnings of endometrial carcinoma.

Abstract: High levels of the soluble form of E-cadherin can be found in the serum of cancer patients and are associated with poor prognosis. Despite the possible predictive value of soluble E-cadherin, little is understood concerning its patho-physiological consequences in tumor progression. In this study, we show that soluble E-cadherin facilitates cell survival via functional interaction with cellular E-cadherin. Exposure of cells to a recombinant form of soluble E-cadherin, at a concentration found in cancer patient's serum, prevents apoptosis due to serum/growth factor withdrawal, and inhibits epithelial lumen formation, a process that requires apoptosis. Further, soluble E-cadherin-mediated cell survival involves activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and EGFR-mediated activation of both phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. These results are evidence of a complex functional interplay between EGFR and E-cadherin and also suggest that the presence of soluble E-cadherin in cancer patients' sera might have relevance to cell survival and tumor progression.

Abstract: Podocytes are an important constituent of the glomerular filtration barrier. The function of these glomerular cells is affected by extracellular nucleotides through P2 receptors. The activation of P2 receptors may lead to the activation of NAD(P)H oxidase, the key enzyme in oxidative stress, with the intracellular pathways leading to intracellular ATP depletion associated with an increase in the intracellular AMP:ATP ratio. This deregulation of the energy balance activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to restore energy homeostasis. We investigated whether P2 receptor activation influences NAD(P)H oxidase-dependent rate of superoxide anion (O2•−) generation and AMPK activity in cultured mouse podocytes. The rate of O2•− generation was measured by chemiluminescence and changes in AMPK activity were determined by immunoblotting against AMPKα-Thr172-P. The addition of 100μM ATP induced a rapid and transient decrease in rate of O2•− generation and increased AMPK phosphorylation with maximal effects in the first minute (2.44±0.09 versus 1.62±0.06nmol/mg protein/min, P<0.05 and 0.64±0.04 versus 0.97±0.07, P<0.05, respectively). Both parameters returned to control levels at 10min. Suramin (300μM, P2 receptor antagonist) and compound C (100μM, AMPK inhibitor) completely, and STO-609 (25μM, CaMKK-β inhibitor) partially, prevented ATP action in rate of O2•− generation and AMPK phosphorylation. Various ATP analogues (10μM) mimicked the effects of ATP on rate of O2•− generation and AMPK phosphorylation. The data indicate that extracellular ATP, acting through P2 receptors upstream of CaMKK-β, modulates podocyte function through simultaneous effects on AMPK and NAD(P)H oxidase activities. This mechanism may play a role in restoring energy homeostasis after oxidative stress.

Abstract: Zebrafish embryos have evolved to cope with hypoxia during development. This includes the ability to completely suspend embryo development for extended periods until normoxia is restored. However, only a limited number of studies have examined the gene regulatory responses of zebrafish embryos to hypoxia. The High Mobility Group A1 protein encoded by the mammalian gene HMGA1 is widely expressed during embryo development but not in adults. Its expression can be induced in adult neurons by hypoxia/oxidative stress and it is commonly reactivated in many types of cancer. We report the identification by phylogenetic and conserved synteny analyses of an HMGA1 orthologue in zebrafish, hmga1 (hmg-i/y) and analysis of sodium azide as a chemical agent for inducing hypoxia-like responses in zebrafish embryos including temporary suspension of development (“suspended animation”). Evidence was only found for the existence of the “a” isoform of HMGA1 in fish. The “b” and “c” isoforms were not detected. We show that zebrafish hmga1 is expressed in a manner similar to in mammals including its induction by hypoxia during hatching stage and in adult zebrafish brain. However, earlier during development, hypoxia causes a decrease in hmga1 transcript levels. By analysis of conservation of the HMGA1a isoform binding site in zebrafish psen2 gene transcripts, we predict that a zebrafish equivalent of the PS2V isoform of human PSEN2 is not formed and we support this by RT-PCR analyses. Thus, analysis of hmga1 function in zebrafish embryogenesis may be valuable for understanding its wider role in vertebrate development, cancer and cellular responses to hypoxia but not for analysis of the action of HMGA1 in PS2V formation.

Abstract: Background
G-CSF based stem cell mobilization and stabilization of cardiac SDF-1 by DPP-IV-inhibition (dual stem cell therapy) improve heart function and survival after myocardial infarction. However, it is barely understood whether this new approach acts specifically through the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis, stimulation of resident cardiac stem cells and improved myocardial perfusion. Therefore, we aimed to clarify the role of the SDF1/CXCR4 axis with respect to the benefits of a dual stem cell based therapy.
Methodology/principal findings
After surgically induced ligation of the LAD, SDF-1/CXCR4 interactions were specifically blocked by the CXCR4 receptor antagonist AMD3100 in G-CSF and Diprotin A treated C57BL/6 mice. G-CSF+DipA treated and non-treated animals served as controls. Because AMD3100 is known to mobilize bone marrow derived stem cells (BMCs) in high concentrations, the optimal dosage (1.25mgperkgbodyweight) sufficient to block CXCR4 without stimulating mobilization was established. AMD3100 treatment of G-CSF and Diprotin A stimulated mice significantly decreased myocardial homing of circulating stem cells (FACS analysis) and inverted the beneficial effects of (i) cardiac remodeling (histological analyses), (ii) heart function (Millar tip catheterization) and (iii) survival (Kaplan–Meier curves). G-CSF treatment in combination with DPP-IV inhibition enhanced neovascularization at the infarct border zone which was related to an improved myocardial blood flow as measured by SPECT. Moreover, dual stem cell treatment effectively stimulated the pool of resident cardiac stem cells (FACS) which was reversed by AMD3100 treatment.
Conclusions/significance
Our data give final proof that homing through the SDF-1/CXCR-4 axis is essential for the success of dual stem cell therapy.

Glycogen synthase kinase-3 regulates endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced CHOP expression in neuronal cells,

Abstract: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, often resulting from cellular accumulation of misfolded proteins, occurs in many neurodegenerative disorders, in part because of the relatively long lifetime of neurons. Excessive accumulation of misfolded proteins activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) that dampens protein synthesis and promotes removal of misfolded proteins to support survival of ER-stressed cells. However, the UPR also initiates apoptotic signaling to kill cells if recovery is not achieved. Thus, there is much interest in identifying determinants of the life–death switch and interventions that promote recovery and survival. One intervention that has consistently been shown to protect cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis is application of inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3). Therefore, we examined where in the UPR pathway GSK3 inhibitors intercede to impede signaling towards apoptosis. Apoptosis following UPR activation can be mediated by activation of two transcription factors, ATF4 and ATF6, that activate expression of the death-inducing transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP/GADD153) following ER stress. We found that ER stress activated ATF6 and ATF4, but these responses were not inhibited by pretreatment with GSK3 inhibitors. However, inhibition of GSK3 effectively reduced the expression of CHOP, and this was apparent in several types of neural-related cells and was evident after application of several structurally diverse GSK3 inhibitors. Therefore, reduction of CHOP activation provides one mechanism by which inhibitors of GSK3 are capable of shifting cell fate towards survival instead of apoptosis following ER stress.

Human TopBP1 localization to the mitotic centrosome mediates mitotic progression,

Abstract: TopBP1 contains repeats of the BRCA1 C-terminal (BRCT) domain and plays important roles in DNA damage response, DNA replication, and other cellular regulatory functions during the interphase. In prometaphase, metaphase, and anaphase, TopBP1 localizes to the mitotic centrosomes, which function as spindle-poles for the bipolar separation of sister chromatids. The localization of TopBP1 to the mitotic centrosomes is mediated by amino acid residues 1259 to 1420 in the TopBP1 C-terminal region (TbpCtr). GST and DsRed2 tags fused to TbpCtr were localized in the mitotic centrosomes, thereby suggesting that TbpCtr functions as a mitosis-specific centrosome localization signal (CLS). Mutations of Ser 1273 and/or Lys 1317, which were predicted to interact with a putative phosphoprotein, inhibited CLS function. Ectopic expression of TbpCtr specifically eliminated endogenous TopBP1 from the mitotic centrosomes, whereas mutant TbpCtr derivatives, containing substitutions at Ser 1273 and/or Lys 1317, did not. The specific elimination of TopBP1 from the mitotic centrosomes prolonged the durations of prometaphase and metaphase and shortened the inter-kinetochore distances of metaphase sister chromatids while maintaining the spindle assembly checkpoint. These results suggest that the localization of TopBP1 to the mitotic centrosomes is necessary for proper mitotic progression.

Abstract: Re-modeling of epithelial tissues requires that the cells in the tissue rearrange their adhesive contacts in order to allow cells to migrate relative to neighboring cells. Desmosomes are prominent adhesive structures found in a variety of epithelial tissues that are believed to inhibit cell migration and invasion. Mechanisms regulating desmosome assembly and stability in migrating cells are largely unknown. In this study we established a cell culture model to examine the fate of desmosomal components during scratch wound migration. Desmosomes are rapidly assembled between epithelial cells at the lateral edges of migrating cells and structures are transported in a retrograde fashion while the structures become larger and mature. Desmosome assembly and dynamics in this system are dependent on the actin cytoskeleton prior to being associated with the keratin intermediate filament cytoskeleton. These studies extend our understanding of desmosome assembly and provide a system to examine desmosome assembly and dynamics during epithelial cell migration.

Abstract: A muscle progenitor cell population, other than muscle satellite cells, can be isolated and purified from porcine muscle tissue. We show the presence of at least two types of stem cells in porcine muscle: those that express α6 integrin and those that lack expression of this integrin type. By flow cytometry, we could select for myogenic stem cell populations expressing the neural cell adhesion molecule in the presence and absence of α6 integrin. The expression of α6 integrin showed an advantage in the formation of myotubes, possibly by an improved cell fusion capacity. This notion was strengthened by qRT-PCR analysis showing sustained PAX7, MYF5 and DESMIN expression and a strong myogenic differentiation capacity of this stem cell population. Selective inhibition of α6 integrin function, both by blocking antibodies and RNA interference, showed the importance of α6 integrin in myogenic differentiation of muscle stem cells. It is concluded that α6 integrin expression can be used as biomarker to select for highly myogenic cell populations in muscle tissue.

Abstract: Summary
Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common but difficult to treat infection of immunocompromised patients. MSL-109 is a human monoclonal IgG isolated from a CMV seropositive individual that recognizes the viral glycoprotein H (gH) surface antigen complexes that mediate entry. Although MSL-109 blocks CMV infection in vitro, it lacked sufficient efficacy in human trials, and CMV isolated from treated patients suggested the evolution of MSL-109 resistance. To understand how CMV escapes MSL-109, we characterized a MSL-109-resistant CMV strain. Our results elucidate a nongenetic escape mechanism in which the antibody is selectively taken up by infected cells and incorporated into assembling virions in a dose-dependent manner. The resistant virus then utilizes the Fc domain of the incorporated antibody to infect naive nonimmune cells. This resistance mechanism may explain the clinical failure of MSL-109, illustrate a general mechanism of viral antibody escape, and inform antiviral vaccine and therapeutic development.

Abstract: Summary
Type III secreted effectors (T3SEs), such as Pseudomonas syringae HopZ1, are essential bacterial virulence proteins injected into the host cytosol to facilitate infection. However, few direct targets of T3SEs are known. Investigating the target(s) of HopZ1 in soybean, a natural P. syringae host, we find that HopZ1 physically interacts with the isoflavone biosynthesis enzyme, 2-hydroxyisoflavanone dehydratase (GmHID1). P. syringae infection induces gmhid1 expression and production of daidzein, a major soybean isoflavone. Silencing gmhid1 increases susceptibility to P. syringae infection, supporting a role for GmHID1 in innate immunity. P. syringae expressing active but not the catalytic mutant of HopZ1 inhibits daidzein induction and promotes bacterial multiplication in soybean. HopZ1-enhanced P. syringae multiplication is at least partially dependent on GmHID1. Thus, GmHID1 is a virulence target of HopZ1 to promote P. syringae infection of soybean. This work highlights the isoflavonoid biosynthesis pathway as an antibacterial defense mechanism and a direct T3SE target.

Abstract: Summary
The prototypic arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), which naturally persists in rodents, represents a model for HIV, HBV, and HCV. Cleavage of the viral glycoprotein precursor by membrane-bound transcription factor peptidase, site 1 (Mbtps1 or site-1 protease), is crucial for the life cycle of arenaviruses and therefore represents a potential target for therapy. Recently, we reported a viable hypomorphic allele of Mbtps1 (woodrat) encoding a protease with diminished enzymatic activity. Using the woodrat allele, we examine the role of Mbtps1 during persistent LCMV infection. Surprisingly, Mbtps1 inhibition limits persistent but not acute viral infection and is associated with an organ/cell type-specific decrease in viral titers. Analysis of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells from woodrat mice supports their specific role in resolving persistent viral infection. These results support in vivo targeting of Mbtps1 in the treatment of arenavirus infections and demonstrate a critical role for dendritic cells in persistent viral infections.

Abstract: CCT is a member of the chaperonin family of molecular chaperones and consists of eight distinct subunit species which occupy fixed positions within the chaperonin rings. The activity of CCT is closely linked to the integrity of the cytoskeleton as newly synthesized actin and tubulin monomers are dependent upon CCT to reach their native conformations. Furthermore, an additional role for CCT involving interactions with assembling/assembled microfilaments and microtubules is emerging. CCT is also known to interact with other proteins, only some of which will be genuine folding substrates. Here, we identify the actin filament remodeling protein gelsolin as a CCT-binding partner, and although it does not behave as a classical folding substrate, gelsolin binds to CCT with a degree of specificity. In cultured cells, the levels of CCT monomers affect levels of gelsolin, suggesting an additional link between CCT and the actin cytoskeleton that is mediated via the actin filament severing and capping protein gelsolin.

Abstract: The heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a family of proteins whose expression is enhanced in response to environmental stressors. The Apostichopus japonicus hsp90 and hsp26 genes were cloned using expressed sequence tag and rapid amplification of cDNA ends techniques. The full-length cDNA of Aphsp90 and Aphsp26 contains 3,458 and 1,688 nucleotides encoding 720 and 236 amino acids, respectively. Multiple alignments indicated that the deduced amino acid sequences of ApHsp90 and ApHsp26 shared a high level of identity with Hsp90 and small SHPs (sHSPs) sequences of zebrafish, ant, acorn worms, etc., and shared identical structural features with Hsp90 and sHSPs. The expression profiles of these two genes under heat treatment were investigated by real-time quantitative PCR. It was found that the messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts of the two A. japonicus genes varied among different tissues under normal conditions and heat shock, and that the mRNA expression of the two genes was higher in the intestine compared to other tissues. Heat shock significantly elevated the expression of Aphsp90 and Aphsp26 mRNA in a temperature- and time-dependent manner. The results indicate that Aphsp90 and Aphsp26 played important roles in mediating the environmental stress in A. japonicus.

Abstract: Antibody titers to several heat shock proteins (anti-Hsps) have been reported to be associated with the severity and progression of cardiovascular disease. However, there are little data regarding anti-Hsp27 titers in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). A total of 400 patients with suspected CAD were recruited. Based on the results of coronary angiography, these patients were classified into CAD+ (n = 300) and CAD− (n = 100) groups defined as patients with ≥50% and <50% stenosis of any major coronary artery, respectively. Eighty-three healthy subjects were also recruited as the control group. Serum anti-Hsp27 IgG titers were measured using an in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. CAD+ patients had significantly higher anti-Hsp27 titers compared with both CAD− and control groups. Anti-Hsp27 titers were also higher in the CAD− group compared with the control group. With regard to the number of affected vessels in the CAD+ group, patients with three-vessel disease had higher anti-Hsp27 titers compared with both two-vessel disease (2VD) and one-vessel disease (1VD) subgroups. However, there was no significant difference between 1VD and 2VD subgroups. In multiple linear regression analysis, the number of narrowed vessels and smoking were significant independent determinants of serum anti-Hsp27 titers. The present findings indicate that serum anti-Hsp27 titers may be associated with the presence and severity of coronary artery disease.

Abstract: Tropomyosins are believed to function in part by stabilizing actin filaments. However, accumulating evidence suggests that fundamental differences in function exist between tropomyosin isoforms, which contributes to the formation of functionally distinct filament populations. We investigated the functions of the high-molecular-weight isoform Tm3 and examined the molecular properties of Tm3-containing actin filament populations. Overexpression of the Tm3 isoform specifically induced the formation of filopodia and changes in actin solubility. We observed alterations in actin-binding protein recruitment to filaments, co-incident with changes in expression levels, which can account for this functional outcome. Tm3-associated filaments recruit active actin depolymerizing factor and are bundled into filopodia by fascin, which is both up-regulated and preferentially associated with Tm3-containing filaments in the Tm3 overexpressing cells. This study provides further insight into the isoform-specific roles of different tropomyosin isoforms. We conclude that variation in the tropomyosin isoform composition of microfilaments provides a mechanism to generate functionally distinct filament populations.

Abstract: Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is thought to confer protection to cells via a cellular response to free radicals. This process may involve increased expression of heat shock proteins, in particular the highly inducible heat shock protein 72 (Hsp72). Healthy male volunteers (n = 16) were subjected to HBO for 1 h at 2.8 ATA. Inducible Hsp72 expression was measured by flow cytometry pre-, post- and 4 h-post HBO. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from whole blood via density centrifugation pre-, post- and 4 h post-HBO. PBMC were then subjected to an in vitro heat shock at 40°C or hypoxia at 37°C (5% O2) with a control at 37°C. Cells were then analysed for Hsp72 expression by flow cytometry. Monocytes showed no significant changes in Hsp72 expression following HBO. No detectable Hsp72 was seen in lymphocytes or neutrophils. Following in vitro hypoxic exposure, a significant increase in Hsp72 expression was observed in monocytes isolated immediately post- (p = 0.006) and 4 h post-HBO (p = 0.010) in comparison to control values. HBO does not induce Hsp72 expression in PBMC. The reported benefits of HBO in terms of pre-conditioning are not due to inducement of Hsp72 expression in circulating blood cells, but may involve an enhancement of the stress response.

Abstract: Gold nanoparticles are recently having much attention because of their increased applications in biomedical fields. In this paper, we demonstrated the photothermal efficacy of citrate capped gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) for the destruction of A431 cancer cells. Citrate capped AuNPs were synthesized successfully and characterized by UV–visible–NIR spectrophotometry and High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM). Further, AuNPs were conjugated with epidermal growth factor receptor antibody (anti-EGFR) and applied for the selective photothermal therapy (PTT) of human epithelial cancer cells, A431. PTT experiments were conducted in four groups, Group I—control cells, Group II—cells treated with laser light alone, Group III—cells treated with unconjugated AuNP and further laser irradiation and Group IV—anti-EGFR conjugated AuNP treated cells irradiated by laser light. After laser irradiation, cell morphology changes that were examined using phase contrast microscopy along with the relevant biochemical parameters like lactate dehydrogenase activity, reactive oxygen species generation and caspase-3 activity were studied for all the groups to determine whether cell death occurs due to necrosis or apoptosis. From these results we concluded that, these immunotargeted nanoparticles could selectively induce cell death via ROS mediated apoptosis when cells were exposed to a low power laser light.

Abstract: Chromatin remodeling is required for transcriptional activation and repression. MRG15 (MORF4L1), a chromatin modulator, is a highly conserved protein and is present in complexes containing histone acetyltransferases (HATs) as well as histone deacetylases (HDACs). Loss of expression of MRG15 in mice and Drosophila results in embryonic lethality and fibroblast and neural stem/progenitor cells cultured from Mrg15 null mouse embryos exhibit marked proliferative defects when compared with wild type cells. To determine the role of MRG15 in cell cycle progression we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation with an antibody to MRG15 on normal human fibroblasts as they entered the cell cycle from a quiescent state, and analyzed various cell cycle gene promoters. The results demonstrated a 3-fold increase in MRG15 occupancy at the cdc2 promoter during S phase of the cell cycle and a concomitant increase in acetylated histone H4. H4 lysine 12 was acetylated at 24 h post-serum stimulation while there was no change in acetylation of lysine 16. HDAC1 and 2 were decreased at this promoter during cell cycle progression. Over-expression of MRG15 in HeLa cells activated a cdc2 promoter–reporter construct in a dose-dependent manner, whereas knockdown of MRG15 resulted in decreased promoter activity. In order to implicate HAT activity, we treated cells with the HAT inhibitor anacardic acid and determined that HAT inhibition results in loss of expression of cdc2 mRNA. Further, chromatin immunoprecipitation with Tip60 localizes the protein to the same 110bp stretch of the cdc2 promoter pulled down by MRG15. Additionally, we determined that cotransfection of MRG15 with the known associated HAT Tip60 had a cooperative effect in activating the cdc2 promoter. These results suggest that MRG15 is acting in a HAT complex involving Tip60 to modify chromatin via acetylation of histone H4 at the cdc2 promoter to activate transcription.

Abstract: Summary
While plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), a natural type I interferon (IFN)-producing cell type, are regarded as critical for innate immunity to viruses, their role in defense against fungal infections remains unknown. We examined the interactions of pDCs with hyphae of the invasive human fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. Human pDCs spread over hyphae and inhibited their growth. Antifungal activity was retained in pDC lysates, did not require direct fungal contact, and was partially reversed by zinc. Incubation with hyphae resulted in pDC cytotoxicity, partly due to fungal gliotoxin secretion. Following hyphal stimulation, pDCs released proinflammatory cytokines via a TLR9-independent mechanism. Pulmonary challenge of mice with A. fumigatus resulted in a substantial influx of pDCs into lungs, and pDC-depleted mice were hypersusceptible to invasive aspergillosis. These data demonstrate the antifungal activity of pDCs against A. fumigatus and establish their nonredundant role in host defenses against invasive aspergillosis in vivo.

Abstract: It has been reported that pretreatment of rats with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) increases myocardial functional recovery in ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) hearts. However, the mechanisms by which LPS induces cardioprotection against I/R injury have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we pretreated rats with LPS (1.0 mg/kg) 24 h before they were subjected to I/R injury, and then examined the roles of heat shock protein-70 (HSP70) and nucleus factor-κB (NF-κB) in LPS-induced cardioprotection. We observed that pretreatment with low-dose LPS resulted in significantly increased levels of HSP70 in the myocardium, which could dramatically inhibit NF-κB translocation and reduce degradation of inhibitory κB. Inhibition of NF-κB, in turn, attenuated release of inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6) and reduced apoptosis of myocardium and infarct area following I/R injury. Moreover, HSP70 could ameliorate oxidative stress following I/R injury. To further investigate whether increase of HSP70 might be responsible for protection of the myocardium against I/R injury, we co-administered the HSP70 inhibitor, quercetin, with LPS before I/R injury. We found that LPS-induced cardioprotection was attenuated by co-administration with quercetin. Herein, we concluded that increased levels of HSP70 through LPS pretreatment led to inhibition of NF-κB activity in the myocardium after I/R injury. Our results indicated that LPS-induced cardioprotection was mediated partly through inhibition of NF-κB via increase of HSP70, and LPS pretreatment could provide a means of reducing myocardial I/R injury.

Abstract: Background
Members of the ErbB family of the receptor protein tyrosine kinase superfamily mediate heregulin (HRG)-induced cell responses. Here we investigated HRG activation of ErbB receptors, and the role of this activation in the development of the permeability barrier in airway epithelial cells (AECs).
Methods
Two airway epithelial-like cell lines, Calu-3 and 16HBE were exposed to HRG or no stimulus and were evaluated with respect to their paracellular permeability as determined by transepithelial electric resistance (TER) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran flux. Tight junctions (TJs) were assessed by immunocytochemical localization of occludin and zonula occludens-1.
Results
HRG promoted the development of the permeability barrier and TJ formation by monolayers of Calu-3 and 16HBE cells. Calu-3 cells expressed ErbB1, ErbB2, and ErbB3, but not ErbB4, on their surface. ErbB3 knockdown by small interference RNA (siRNA) blunted the effects of HRG on the permeability barrier. ErbB3 is known as a kinase-dead receptor and relies on other members of the family for its phosphorylation. To identify its heterodimerization partner, we knocked down the expression of other ErbB family receptors. We found that HRG's effect on the permeability barrier could be significantly attenuated by transfecting cells with ErbB2 siRNA but not with EGFR siRNA.
Conclusion
These results indicate that HRG activation of ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimers is essential for regulation of the permeability barrier in AECs.

Abstract: c-Myc is known to induce or potentiate apoptotic processes predominantly by triggering or enhancing the activity of caspases, but the activation mechanisms of caspases by c-Myc remain still poorly understood. Here we found that in MycER™ rat fibroblasts the activation of c-Myc led to an early activation and cleavage of the initiator caspase-8, and concurrent processing and activation of the effector caspases 3 and 7. Interestingly, the expression of cellular FLICE inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) mRNA and the encoded protein, c-FLIPL, a catalytically inactive homologue of caspase-8, were down-regulated prior to or coincidently with the activation of caspase-8. Of the other known initiators, caspase-9, involved in the mitochondrial pathway, was activated/processed surprisingly late, only after the effector caspases 3/7. Further, we studied the potential involvement of the Fas- and tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-mediated signaling in the activation of caspase-8 by c-Myc. Blocking of the function of these death receptors by neutralizing antibodies against Fas ligand and TNF-α did not prevent the processing of caspase-8 or cell death. c-Myc was neither found to induce any changes in the expression of TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) or its receptor. These data suggest that caspase-8 does not become activated through an extrinsic but an “intrinsic/intracellular” apoptotic pathway unleashed by the down-regulation of c-FLIP by c-Myc. Moreover, ectopic expression of c-FLIPL inhibited the c-Myc-induced apoptosis.

Abstract: Mutations in PKHD1 (polycystic kidney and hepatic disease gene 1) gene cause the autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD). Fibrocystin/polyductin (FPC), encoded by PKHD1, is a membrane-associated receptor-like protein. Although it is widely accepted that cystogenesis is mostly due to aberrant cell proliferation and apoptosis, it is still unclear how apoptosis is regulated. The aim of this study is to analyze the relationship among apoptosis, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) in FPC knockdown kidney cells. We show that PKHD1-silenced HEK293 cells demonstrate a higher PI3K/Akt activity. Selective inhibition of PI3K/Akt using LY294002 or wortmannin in these cells increases serum starvation-induced HEK293 cell apoptosis with a concomitant decrease in cell proliferation and higher caspase-3 activity. PI3K/Akt inhibition also leads to increased NF-κB activity in these cells. We conclude that the PI3K/Akt pathway is involved in apoptotic function in PKHD1-silenced cells, and PI3K/Akt inhibition correlates with upregulation of NF-κB activity. These observations provide a potential platform for determining FPC function and therapeutic investigation of ARPKD.

Abstract: Ceramide 1-phosphate (C1P) is a novel bioactive sphingolipid formed by ceramide kinase (CERK)-catalyzed phosphorylation of ceramide. It has been implicated in the regulation of such vital pathophysiological functions as phagocytosis and inflammation, but there have been no reports ascribing a biological function to CERK in vascular disorders. Here the potential role of CERK/C1P in neointimal formation was investigated using rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in primary culture and a rat carotid injury model. Exogenous C8-C1P stimulated cell proliferation, DNA synthesis, and cell cycle progression of rat aortic VSMCs in primary culture. In addition, wild-type CERK-transfected rat aortic VSMCs induced a marked increase in rat aortic VSMC proliferation and [3H]-thymidine incorporation when compared to empty vector transfectant. C8-C1P markedly activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) within 5min, and the activation could be prevented by U0126, a MEK inhibitor. Also, K1, a CERK inhibitor, decreased the ERK1/2 phosphorylation and cell proliferation on platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-stimulated rat aortic VSMCs. CERK expression and C1P levels were found to be potently increased during neointimal formation using a rat carotid injury model. However, ceramide levels decreased during the neointimal formation process. These findings suggest that C1P can induce neointimal formation via cell proliferation through the regulation of the ERK1/2 protein in rat aortic VSMCs and that CERK/C1P may regulate VSMC proliferation as an important pathogenic marker in the development of cardiovascular disorders.

Abstract: Pluripotent cells referred to as embryonic germ cells (EGCs) can be derived from the embryonic precursors of the mature gametes: the primordial germ cells (PGCs). A homozygous mutation (ter) of the dead-end homolog 1 gene (Dnd1) in the rat causes gonadal teratocarcinogenesis and sterility due to neoplastic transformation and loss of germ cells. We mated heterozygous ter/+ WKY-Dnd1ter/Ztm rats and were able to cultivate the first genital ridge-derived EGCs of the rat embryo at day 14.5 post coitum (pc). Genotyping revealed that ten EGC lines were Dnd1 deficient, while only one wild type cell line had survived in culture. This suggests that the inactivation of the putative tumor suppressor gene Dnd1 facilitates the immortalization of late EGCs in vitro.

Abstract: Recent work was conducted to predict the structure of functionally distinct regions of Avicennia marina peroxidase (AP) by using the structural coordinates of barley grains peroxidase as the template. This enzyme is utilized by all living organisms in many biosynthetic or degradable processes and in defense against oxidative stress. The homology model showed some distinct structural changes in the heme, calcium, and substrate-binding regions. Val53 was found to be an important coordinating residue between distal calcium ion and the distal heme site while Ser176 is coordinated to the proximal histidine through Ala174 and Leu172. Different ionic and hydrogen-bonded interactions were also observed in AP. Analyses of various substrate–enzyme interactions revealed that the substrate-binding pocket is provided by the residues, His41, Phe70, Gly71, Asp138, His139, and Lys176; the later three residues are not conserved in the peroxidase family. We have also performed structural comparison of the A. marina peroxidase with that of two class III salt-sensitive species, peanut and soybean. Four loop regions were found to have largest structural deviation. The overall protein sequence was also analyzed for the presence of probable post-translational modification sites and the functional significance of these sites were outlined.

Abstract: Summary
Virus entry into cells is typically initiated by binding of virally encoded envelope proteins to specific cell surface receptors. Studying infectivity of lentivirus pseudotypes lacking envelope binding, we still observed high infectivity for some cell types. On further investigation, we discovered that this infectivity is conferred by the soluble bovine protein S in fetal calf serum, or Gas6, its human homolog. Gas6 enhances native infectivity of pseudotypes of multiple viral envelope proteins. Gas6 mediates binding of the virus to target cells by bridging virion envelope phosphatidylserine to Axl, a TAM receptor tyrosine kinase on target cells. Phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells is known to involve bridging by Gas6. Replication of vaccinia virus, which was previously reported to use apoptotic mimicry to enter cells, is also enhanced by Gas6. These results reveal an alternative molecular mechanism of viral entry that can broaden host range and enhance infectivity of enveloped viruses.

Abstract: Summary
The integration of viral cDNA into the host genome is a critical step in the life cycle of HIV-1. This step is catalyzed by integrase (IN), a viral enzyme that is positively regulated by acetylation via the cellular histone acetyl transferase (HAT) p300. To investigate the relevance of IN acetylation, we searched for cellular proteins that selectively bind acetylated IN and identified KAP1, a protein belonging to the TRIM family of antiviral proteins. KAP1 binds acetylated IN and induces its deacetylation through the formation of a protein complex which includes the deacetylase HDAC1. Modulation of intracellular KAP1 levels in different cell types including T cells, the primary HIV-1 target, revealed that KAP1 curtails viral infectivity by selectively affecting HIV-1 integration. This study identifies KAP1 as a cellular factor restricting HIV-1 infection and underscores the relevance of IN acetylation as a crucial step in the viral infectious cycle.

Abstract: Recently we described a co-culture model of periodontal ligament (PDL) fibroblasts and SCC-25 lingual squamous carcinoma cells, which resulted in conversion of normal fibroblasts into carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and in epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) of SCC-25 cells. We have found a constitutive high interleukin-1β (IL1-β) expression in SCC-25 cells in normal and in co-cultured conditions. In our hypothesis a constitutive IL1-β expression in SCC-25 regulates gene expression in fibroblasts during co-culture. Co-cultures were performed between PDL fibroblasts and SCC-25 cells with and without dexamethasone (DEX) treatment; IL1-β processing was investigated in SCC-25 cells, tumor cells and PDL fibroblasts were treated with IL1-β. IL1-β signaling was investigated by western blot and immunocytochemistry. IL1-β-regulated genes were analyzed by real-time qPCR. SCC-25 cells produced 16kD active IL1-β, its receptor was upregulated in PDL fibroblasts during co-culture, which induced phosphorylation of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK-1), and nuclear translocalization of NFκBα. Several genes, including interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) interleukin-6 (IL-6) and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (COX-2) were induced in CAFs during co-culture. The most enhanced induction was found for IL-6 and COX-2. Treatment of PDL fibroblasts with IL1-β reproduced a time- and dose-dependent upregulation of IL1-receptor, IL-6 and COX-2. A further proof was achieved by DEX inhibition for IL1-β-stimulated IL-6 and COX-2 gene expression. Constitutive expression of IL1-β in the tumor cells leads to IL1-β-stimulated gene expression changes in tumor-associated fibroblasts, which are involved in tumor progression.

Abstract: During the branching morphogenesis process that builds epithelial trees, signaling from stimulatory and inhibitory growth factors is integrated to control branch initiation and extension into the surrounding stroma. Here, we examined the relative roles played by these stimulatory and inhibitory signals in the patterning of branch initiation and extension of model mammary epithelial tubules in culture. We found that although several growth factors could stimulate branching, they did not determine the sites at which new branches formed or the lengths to which branches extended. Instead, branch initiation and extension were defined by two separate signals downstream of the inhibitory morphogen, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β. Branch initiation was controlled by signaling through p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, whereas branch extension was controlled by Smad-mediated induction of a second diffusible inhibitor, Wnt5a. These data suggest that mammary epithelial branching is patterned predominately by repulsive signaling, and that TGFβ activates multiple inhibitory pathways to refine the architecture of the tree.

Protein nitration and nitrosylation by NO-donating aspirin in colon cancer cells: Relevance to its mechanism of action,

Abstract: Nitric oxide-donating aspirin (NO-ASA) is a promising agent for cancer prevention. Although studied extensively, its molecular targets and mechanism of action are still unclear. S-nitrosylation of signaling proteins is emerging as an important regulatory mechanism by NO. Here, we examined whether S-nitrosylation of the NF-κB, p53, and Wnt signaling proteins by NO-ASA might explain, in part, its mechanism of action in colon cancer. NO-ASA releases significant amounts of NO detected intracellularly in HCT116 and HT-29 colon cells. Using a modified biotin switch assay we demonstrated that NO-ASA S-nitrosylates the signaling proteins p53, β-catenin, and NF-κB, in colon cancer cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. NO-ASA suppresses NF-κB binding to its cognate DNA oligonucleotide, which occurs without changes in the nuclear levels of the NF-κB subunits p65 and p50 and is reversed by dithiothreitol that reduces ―S―NO to ―SH. In addition to S-nitrosylation, we documented both in vitro and in vivo widespread nitration of tyrosine residues of cellular proteins in response to NO-ASA. Our results suggest that the increased intracellular NO levels following treatment with NO-ASA modulate cell signaling by chemically modifying key protein members of signaling cascades. We speculate that S-nitrosylation and tyrosine nitration are responsible, at least in part, for the inhibitory growth effect of NO-ASA on cancer cell growth and that this may represent a general mechanism of action of NO-releasing agents.

Abstract: Recent reports have indicated that mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from bone marrow have a potential in vascular remodeling and angiogenesis. Here, we report a unique phenomenon that under serum-deprived conditions MSCs survive and replicate. Secretome analysis of MSCs grown under serum-deprived conditions (SD-MSCs) identified a significant upregulation of prosurvival and angiogenic factors including VEGF-A, ANGPTs, IGF-1, and HGF. An ex vivo rat aortic assay demonstrated longer neovascular sprouts generated from rat aortic rings cultured in SD-MSC-conditioned media compared to neovascular sprouts from aortas grown in MSC-conditioned media. With prolonged serum deprivation, a subpopulation of SD-MSCs began to exhibit an endothelial phenotype. This population expressed endothelial-specific proteins including VEGFR2, Tie2/TEK, PECAM/CD31, and eNOS and also demonstrated the ability to uptake acetylated LDL. SD-MSCs also exhibited enhanced microtubule formation in an in vitro angiogenesis assay. Modified chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) angiogenesis assays showed significantly higher angiogenic potential for SD-MSCs compared to MSCs. Analysis of CAMs grown with SD-MSCs identified human-specific CD31-positive cells in vascular structures. We conclude that under the stress of serum deprivation MSCs are highly angiogenic and a population of these cells has the potential to differentiate into endothelial-like cells.

Abstract: CXCL12/CXCR4 chemokine/receptor axis signaling has recently been found to play an important role in the remodeling of bone tissue, but little is known about the molecular mechanisms that are involved. The present study shows that CXCL12 is present at high levels both in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and primary osteoblasts (hOBs). When osteogenesis was induced, CXCL12 expression was strictly confined to mineralized nodules. To investigate what mechanisms contribute to the maintenance of a correct expression of CXCL12 in bone cellular context, we analyzed the relationship between CXCL12 and Slug, a transcription factor recently associated with osteoblast maturation. By gene silencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we showed that both proteins are required for the mineralization process and CXCL12 is transcriptionally and functionally regulated by Slug, which is recruited at specific sites to its gene promoter in vivo. These findings showed for the first time a positive correlation between CXCL12 signaling and Slug activity, thus corroborating the role of these two proteins in bone cellular context and suggesting a new potential target for bone tissue repair and regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Shigella, the Gram-negative enteroinvasive bacterium that causes shigellosis, relies on its type III secretion system (TTSS) and injected effectors to modulate host cell functions. However, consequences of the interaction between Shigella and lymphocytes have not been investigated. We show that Shigella invades activated human CD4+ T lymphocytes. Invasion requires a functional TTSS and results in inhibition of chemokine-induced T cell migration, an effect mediated by the TTSS effector IpgD, a phosphoinositide 4-phosphatase. Remarkably, IpgD injection into bystander T cells can occur in the absence of cell invasion. Upon IpgD-mediated hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), the pool of PIP2 at the plasma membrane is reduced, leading to dephosphorylation of the ERM proteins and their inability to relocalize at one T cell pole upon chemokine stimulus, likely affecting the formation of the polarized edge required for cell migration. These results reveal a bacterial TTSS effector-mediated strategy to impair T cell function.

Abstract: The assumption that cells are temporally organized systems, i.e. showing relevant dynamics of their state variables such as gene expression or protein and metabolite concentration, while tacitly given for granted at the molecular level, is not explicitly taken into account when interpreting biological experimental data. This conundrum stems from the (undemonstrated) assumption that a cell culture, the actual object of biological experimentation, is a population of billions of independent oscillators (cells) randomly experiencing different phases of their cycles and thus not producing relevant coordinated dynamics at the population level. Moreover the fact of considering reproductive cycle as by far the most important cyclic process in a cell resulted in lower attention given to other rhythmic processes. Here we demonstrate that growing yeast cells show a very repeatable and robust cyclic variation of the concentration of proteins with different cellular functions. We also report experimental evidence that the mechanism governing this basic oscillator and the cellular entrainment is resistant to external chemical constraints. Finally, cell growth is accompanied by cyclic dynamics of medium pH. These cycles are observed in batch cultures, different from the usual continuous cultures in which yeast metabolic cycles are known to occur, and suggest the existence of basic, spontaneous, collective and synchronous behaviors of the cell population as a whole.

Let-7b-mediated suppression of basigin expression and metastasis in mouse melanoma cells,

Abstract: Basigin (Bsg), also called extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN), is highly expressed on the surface of tumor cells and stimulates adjacent fibroblasts or tumor cells to produce matrix metalloproteinases (mmps). It has been shown that Bsg plays an important role in growth, development, cell differentiation, and tumor progression. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short endogenous non-protein coding RNAs of 20–25 nucleotides (nt) that function as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression by base-pairing to their target mRNAs and thereby mediate cleavage of target mRNAs or translational repression. In this study, let-7b, one of the let-7 family members, was investigated for its effect on the growth and invasiveness of the mouse melanoma cell line B16-F10. We have shown that let-7b can suppress the expression of Bsg in B16-F10 cells and also provided evidence that this suppression could result in the indirect suppression of mmp-9. The ability of B16-F10 cells transfected with let-7b to invade or migrate was significantly reduced. In addition, let-7b transfected B16-F10 cells displayed an inhibition of both cellular proliferation and colony formation. Furthermore, it was shown that the overexpression of let-7b in B16-F10 cells could reduce lung metastasis. Taken together, the present study identifies let-7b as a tumor suppressor that represses cancer cell proliferation and migration as well as tumor metastasis in mouse melanoma cells.

Abstract: The mechanisms underlying the inverse relationship between osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (MSC) are not known in detail. We have previously established two cell lines from mouse bone marrow that are committed to either osteogenic (osteoblasts and chondrocytes) (mMSCBone) or adipogenic (mMSCAdipo) lineage. To identify the molecular mechanism determining the lineage commitment, we compared the basal gene expression profile of mMSCBone versus mMSCAdipo using Affymetrix GeneChip® MG430A 2.0 Array. Gene annotation analysis based on biological function revealed an over-representation of skeletal development genes in mMSCBone while genes related to lipid metabolism and immune response were highly expressed in mMSCAdipo. In addition, there was a significant up-regulation of canonical Wnt signalling genes in mMSCBone compared to mMSCAdipo (p<0.006). Dual-luciferase assay and expression analysis of genes related to Wnt signalling demonstrated significant activation of Wnt signalling pathway in mMSCBone compared to mMSCAdipo. Reduced Wnt activity in mMSCAdipo was associated with increased expression of the Wnt inhibitor, secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (sFRP-1) at both mRNA and protein levels in mMSCAdipo. Interestingly, conditioned medium (CM) collected from mMSCAdipo (mMSC-CMAdipo) inhibited osteoblast differentiation of mMSC, while depletion of sFRP-1 protein from mMSC-CMAdipo abolished its inhibitory effect on osteoblast differentiation. Furthermore, treatment of mMSC with recombinant sFRP-1 resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of osteoblast and stimulation of adipocyte differentiation. In conclusion, cross-talk exists between different populations of MSC in the bone marrow, and Wnt signalling functions as a molecular switch that determines the balance between osteoblastogenesis and adipogenesis.

Abstract: Phenomena related to chronic kidney disease, such as atherosclerosis, aggravate with the introduction of dialysis. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and factors modifying their activity, such as their tissue inhibitors (TIMP) or neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), take part in the matrix turnover and the endothelial damage characteristic for atherogenesis. However, there are no data on the associations between these parameters and other known pro-atherogenic factors, or on the impact of various dialysis modalities on them. The aim of our study was to assess the serum concentrations of NGAL, MMP-7, MMP-9, and TIMP-1, as well as their correlations with human heat shock proteins (Hsp90α, anti-Hsp60), endothelial dysfunction (sE-selectin), and inflammation (hsCRP) in pediatric patients chronically dialyzed. Twenty-two children on automated peritoneal dialysis (APD), 17 patients on hemodialysis (HD) and 24 controls were examined. The serum concentrations of NGAL, MMP-7, MMP-9, TIMP-1, Hsp90α, anti-Hsp60, and sE-selectin were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The median values of NGAL, MMP-7, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and MMP-9/NGAL ratio were significantly elevated in all dialyzed children vs. controls and were higher in HD than in APD. The values of MMP-9/TIMP-1 and MMP-7/TIMP-1 ratios in the HD subjects were lower than those in the APD children. Hsp90α and anti-Hsp60 predicted the values of NGAL, MMPs, and TIMP-1. Additionally, sE-selectin was a predictor of NGAL levels, whereas NGAL predicted the MMP and TIMP-1 concentrations. The increased concentrations of examined parameters indicate the dysfunction of MMP/TIMP/NGAL system in the dialyzed children, more pronounced on hemodialysis. The discrepancies between dialysis modalities and correlations with heat shock proteins (HSPs) suggest that NGAL may be considered a novel stress protein, whereas MMP-7, MMP-9, and TIMP-1 may be regarded as indicators of stress response in the pediatric population on chronic dialysis.

Abstract: Inhibitors of proteasomes have been shown to affect endocytosis of multiple membrane receptors, in particular at the step of cargo sorting for lysosomal degradation. Here we demonstrate that the inhibition of proteasomes causes specific redistribution of an endosomal adaptor APPL1, which undergoes initial solubilization from APPL endosomes followed by clustering in the perinuclear region. MG132 treatment decreases APPL1 labeling of endosomes while the staining of the canonical early endosomes with EEA1 remains unaffected. Upon prolonged treatment with proteasome inhibitors, endogenous APPL1 localizes to the site of aggresome formation, with perinuclear APPL1 clusters encapsulated within a vimentin cage and co-localizing with aggregates positive for ubiquitin. The clustering of APPL1 is concomitant with increased ubiquitination and decreased solubility of this protein. We determined that the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 enhances polyubiquitination of APPL1, and the ubiquitin molecules attached to APPL1 are linked through lysine-63. Taken together, these results add APPL1 to only a handful of endogenous cellular proteins known to be recruited to aggresomes induced by proteasomal stress. Moreover, our studies suggest that the proteasome inhibitors that are already in clinical use affect the localization, ubiquitination and solubility of APPL1.

Abstract: Previously, we reported that oral feeding of 1% green tea polyphenols (GTPs) aggravated the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. In the present study, we assessed the toxicity of 1% GTPs in several organs from normal and DSS-exposed mice. Sixty-two male ICR mice were initially divided into four groups. Non-treated group (group 1, n = 15) was given standard diet and water, GTPs (group 2, n = 15) received 1% GTPs in diet and water, DSS (group 3, n = 15) received diet and 5% DSS in water, and GTPs + DSS group (group 4, n = 17) received 1% GTPs in diet and 5% DSS in water. We found that group 4 significantly increased (P < 0.05) kidney weight, the levels of serum creatinine and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances in both kidney and liver, as compared with those in group 3. The mRNA expression levels of antioxidant enzymes and heat-shock proteins (HSPs) in group 4 were lower than those of group 3. For instance, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), HSP27, and 90 mRNA in the kidney of group 4 were dramatically down-regulated as compared with those of group 3. Furthermore, 1% GTPs diet decreased the expression of HO-1, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and HSP90 in kidney and liver of non-treated mice. Taken together, our results indicate that high-dose GTPs diet disrupts kidney functions through the reduction of antioxidant enzymes and heat-shock protein expressions in not only colitis but also non-treated ICR mice.

Abstract: Cohesin, a hetero-tetrameric complex of SMC1, SMC3, Rad21 and Scc3, associates with chromatin after mitosis and holds sister chromatids together following DNA replication. Following DNA damage, cohesin accumulates at and promotes the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. In addition, phosphorylation of the SMC1/3 subunits contributes to DNA damage-induced cell cycle checkpoint regulation. The aim of this study was to determine the regulation and consequences of SMC1/3 phosphorylation as part of the cohesin complex. We show here that the ATM-dependent phosphorylation of SMC1 and SMC3 is mediated by H2AX, 53BP1 and MDC1. Depletion of RAD21 abolishes these phosphorylations, indicating that only the fully assembled complex is phosphorylated. Comparison of wild type SMC1 and SMC1S966A in fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching experiments shows that phosphorylation of SMC1 is required for an increased mobility after DNA damage in G2-phase cells, suggesting that ATM-dependent phosphorylation facilitates mobilization of the cohesin complex after DNA damage.

Abstract: Phosphatase and tensin homology deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) is a negative regulator of PI3K/Akt pathway, and here we investigated the effect of PTEN on lipogenesis in diabetic rats and high glucose-stimulated human renal proximal tubular cell line (HKC). Decreased PTEN and increased phospho-Akt were found in kidney of diabetic rats, and in vitro research revealed that high glucose attenuated PTEN expression in a time-dependent manner, concomitant with activation of Akt. Again, expression of PTEN significantly inhibited high glucose-caused increased phospho-Akt and lipogenic genes including SREBP-1, fatty acid synthase (FASN) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). Furthermore, we confirmed inhibition of TGF-β1 pathway with SB431542 blocked the effect of high glucose on PTEN down-regulation, an increase in phospho-Akt and lipogenesis. These above data suggest that decreased PTEN mediates high glucose-induced lipogenesis in renal proximal tubular cells and TGF-β1 might be involved in PTEN down-regulation.

Abstract: Endothelin-1 (ET-1), a potent vasoconstrictor peptide up-regulated during wound healing and fibrosis, induces myofibroblasts to contract tissue. Here we have used a liver injury model to test the hypothesis that TNFα may be an important stimulator of ET-1 production in hepatic wound healing. We examined primary rat hepatic stellate cells, isolated from either normal or injured livers and used standard methodology to measure preproET-1 mRNA and mature ET-1 peptide, specific kinases, and preproET-1 promoter activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis was used to determine basal binding of transcription factors to the preproET-1 promoter. TNFα induced preproET-1 expression in activated hepatic stellate cells in a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/AP-1-dependent fashion. TNFα activated JNK through an IκB kinase (IKK) pathway, which activated the transcriptional factor, c-Jun, leading to preproET-1 promoter mediated ET-1 transcription. The TNFα mediated induction of ET-1 synthesis also had functional effects, specifically mediating autocrine induced stellate cell contraction. TNFα stimulated activated stellate cells to produce ET-1 via a novel IKK–JNK-dependent signaling pathway. The resulting autocrine functional effects of ET-1 are likely to be important in the wound-healing process.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) contribute to tissue repair in vivo and form an attractive cell source for tissue engineering. Their regenerative potential is impaired by cellular senescence. The effects of oxidative stress on MSCs are still unknown. Our studies were to investigate into the proliferation potential, cytological features and the telomere linked stress response system of MSCs, subject to acute or prolonged oxidant challenge with hydrogen peroxide. Telomere length was measured using the telomere restriction fragment assay, gene expression was determined by rtPCR. Sub-lethal doses of oxidative stress reduced proliferation rates and induced senescent-morphological features and senescence-associated β-galactosidase positivity. Prolonged low dose treatment with hydrogen peroxide had no effects on cell proliferation or morphology. Sub-lethal and prolonged low doses of oxidative stress considerably accelerated telomere attrition. Following acute oxidant insult p21 was up-regulated prior to returning to initial levels. TRF1 was significantly reduced, TRF2 showed a slight up-regulation. SIRT1 and XRCC5 were up-regulated after oxidant insult and expression levels increased in aging cells. Compared to fibroblasts and chondrocytes, MSCs showed an increased tolerance to oxidative stress regarding proliferation, telomere biology and gene expression with an impaired stress tolerance in aged cells.

Abstract: Mechanisms underlying the vascular differentiation of human bone marrow stromal cells (HBMSCs) and their contribution to neovascularisation are poorly understood. We report the essential role of cell density-induced signals in directing HBMSCs along endothelial or smooth muscle lineages. Plating HBMSCs at high density rapidly induced Notch signaling, which initiated HBMSC commitment to a vascular progenitor cell population expressing markers for both vascular lineages. Notch also induced VEGF-A, which inhibited vascular smooth muscle commitment while consolidating differentiation to endothelial cells with cobblestone morphology and characteristic endothelial markers and functions. These mechanisms can be exploited therapeutically to regulate HBMSCs during neovascularisation.

Abstract: Hypoxia is one way of inducing differentiation due to the activation of the key regulatory factor, Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α). However, the action of HIF-1α on the differentiation of hESCs was unclear until now. To investigate the effect of hypoxia on the differentiation of hESCs, we compared the differentiation efficacy into vascular lineage cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. We observed HIF-1α expression and the related expression of pro-angiogenic factors VEGF, bFGF, Ang-1 and PDGF in hEBs cultured under hypoxic conditions. Along with this, differentiation efficacy into vascular lineage cells was improved under hypoxic conditions. When HIF-1α was blocked by echinomycin, both angiogenic factors and the differentiation efficacy were down-regulated, suggesting that the enhancement of differentiation efficacy was caused by intrinsic up-regulation of HIF-1α and these pro-angiogenic factors under hypoxic condition. This response might be primarily regulated by the HIF-1α signal pathway, and hypoxia might be the key to improving the differentiation of hESCs into vascular lineage cells. Therefore, this study demonstrated that microenvironmental changes (i.e., hypoxia) can improve differentiation efficacy of hESCs into a vascular lineage without exogenous factors via cell-intrinsic up-regulation of angiogenic factors. These facts will contribute to the regulation of stem cell fate.

Abstract: The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is frequently activated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Downstream signaling events involving the Wnt/β-catenin cascade occur through T-cell factor (TCF) proteins. The human TCF-4 gene is composed of 17 exons with multiple alternative splicing sites. However, the role of different TCF-4 isoforms in the pathogenesis of HCC is unknown. The purpose of this study was to identify and characterize TCF-4 isoforms in HCC. We identified 14 novel TCF-4 isoforms from four HCC cell lines. Functional analysis following transfection and expression in HCC cells revealed distinct effects on the phenotype. The TCF-4J isoform expression produced striking features of malignant transformation characterized by high cell proliferation rate, migration and colony formation even though its transcriptional activity was low. In contrast, the TCF-4K isoform displayed low TCF transcriptional activity; cell proliferation rate and colony formation were reduced as well. Interestingly, TCF-4J and TCF-4K differed by only five amino acids (the SxxSS motif). Thus, these studies suggest that conserved splicing motifs may have a major influence on the transcriptional activity and functional properties of TCF-4 isoforms and alter the characteristics of the malignant phenotype.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have shown potential clinical utility in cell therapy and tissue engineering, due to their ability to proliferate as well as to differentiate into multiple lineages, including osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic specifications. Therefore, it is crucial to assess the safety of MSCs while extensive expansion ex vivo is a prerequisite to obtain the cell numbers for cell transplantation. Here we show that MSCs derived from adult cynomolgus monkey can undergo spontaneous transformation following in vitro culture. In comparison with MSCs, the spontaneously transformed mesenchymal cells (TMCs) display significantly different growth pattern and morphology, reminiscent of the characteristics of tumor cells. Importantly, TMCs are highly tumorigenic, causing subcutaneous tumors when injected into NOD/SCID mice. Moreover, no multiple differentiation potential of TMCs is observed in vitro or in vivo, suggesting that spontaneously transformed adult stem cells may not necessarily turn into cancer stem cells. These data indicate a direct transformation of cynomolgus monkey MSCs into tumor cells following long-term expansion in vitro. The spontaneous transformation of the cultured cynomolgus monkey MSCs may have important implications for ongoing clinical trials and for models of oncogenesis, thus warranting a more strict assessment of MSCs prior to cell therapy.

Abstract: Signaling through the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is relevant in glioblastoma. We have determined the effects of the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 in glioblastoma cell lines and found that U87 and LN-229 cells were very sensitive to this drug, since their proliferation diminished and underwent a marked G1 arrest. T98 cells were a little more refractory to growth inhibition and A172 cells did not undergo a G1 arrest. This G1 arrest was associated with up-regulation of p27kip1, whose protein turnover was stabilized. EGFR autophosphorylation was blocked with AG1478 to the same extent in all the cell lines. Other small-molecule EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors employed in the clinic, such as gefitinib, erlotinib and lapatinib, were able to abrogate proliferation of glioblastoma cell lines, which underwent a G1 arrest. However, the EGFR monoclonal antibody, cetuximab had no effect on cell proliferation and consistently, had no effect on cell cycle either. Similarly, cetuximab did not inhibit proliferation of U87 ΔEGFR cells or primary glioblastoma cell cultures, whereas small-molecule EGFR inhibitors did. Activity of downstream signaling molecules of EGFR such as Akt and especially ERK1/2 was interrupted with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, whereas cetuximab treatment could not sustain this blockade over time. Small-molecule EGFR inhibitors were able to prevent phosphorylation of erbB3 and erbB4, whereas cetuximab only hindered EGFR phosphorylation, suggesting that EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors may mediate their anti-proliferative effects through other erbB family members. We can conclude that small-molecule EGFR inhibitors may be a therapeutic approach for the treatment of glioblastoma patients.

Abstract: Myofibroblasts participate in tissue repair processes in diverse mammalian organ systems. The deactivation of myofibroblasts is critical for termination of the reparative response and restoration of tissue structure and function. The current paradigm on normal tissue repair is the apoptotic clearance of terminally differentiated myofibroblasts; while, the accumulation of activated myofibroblasts is associated with progressive human fibrotic disorders. The capacity of myofibroblasts to undergo de-differentiation as a potential mechanism for myofibroblast deactivation has not been examined. In this report, we have uncovered a role for MyoD in the induction of myofibroblast differentiation by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1). Myofibroblasts demonstrate the capacity for de-differentiation and proliferation by modulation of endogenous levels of MyoD. We propose a model of reciprocal signaling between TGF-β1/ALK5/MyoD and mitogen(s)/ERK-MAPK/CDKs that regulate myofibroblast differentiation and de-differentiation, respectively. Our studies provide the first evidence for MyoD in controlling myofibroblast activation and deactivation. Restricted capacity for de-differentiation of myofibroblasts may underlie the progressive nature of recalcitrant human fibrotic disorders.

Abstract: Generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from somatic cells has been successfully achieved by ectopic expression of four transcription factors, Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc, also known as the Yamanaka factors. In practice, initial iPS colonies are picked based on their embryonic stem (ES) cell-like morphology, but often may go on to fail subsequent assays, such as the alkaline phosphate (AP) assay. In this study, we co-expressed through lenti-viral delivery the Yamanaka factors in amniotic fluid-derived (AF) cells. ES-like colonies were picked onto a traditional feeder layer and a high percentage AF-iPS with partial to no AP activity was found. Interestingly, we obtained an overwhelming majority of fully stained AP positive (AP+) AF-iPS colonies when colonies were first seeded on a feeder-free culture system, and then transferred to a feeder layer for expansion. Furthermore, colonies with no AP activity were not detected. This screening step decreased the variation seen between morphology and AP assay. We observed the AF-iPS colonies grown on the feeder layer with 28% AP+ colonies, 45% AP partially positive (AP+/−) colonies and 27% AP negative (AP−) colonies, while colonies screened by the feeder-free system were 84% AP+ colonies, 16% AP+/− colonies and no AP− colonies. The feeder-free screened AP+ AF-iPS colonies were also positive for pluripotent markers, OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81, SSEA-3 and SSEA-4 as well as having differentiation abilities into three germ layers in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we report a simplistic, one-step method for selection of AP+ AF-iPS cells via feeder-free screening.

Abstract: Summary
The human polyoma viruses JCV and BKV establish asymptomatic persistent infection in 65%–90% of humans but can cause severe illness under immunosuppressive conditions. The mechanisms by which these viruses evade immune recognition are unknown. Here we show that a viral miRNA identical in sequence between JCV and BKV targets the stress-induced ligand ULBP3, which is a protein recognized by the killer receptor NKG2D. Consequently, viral miRNA-mediated ULBP3 downregulation results in reduced NKG2D-mediated killing of virus-infected cells by natural killer (NK) cells. Importantly, when the activity of the viral miRNA was inhibited during infection, NK cells killed the infected cells more efficiently. Because NKG2D is also expressed by various T cell subsets, we propose that JCV and BKV use an identical miRNA that targets ULBP3 to escape detection by both the innate and adaptive immune systems, explaining how these viruses remain latent without being eliminated by the immune system.

Abstract: Gene encoding heat shock protein (Hsps) are induced following a thermal stress thanks to the activation of heat shock transcription factor (HSF) which interacts with heat shock elements (HSE) located within the sequence of Hsp promoters. This cellular and protective response (heat shock response (HSR)) is well known and evolutionarily conserved. Nevertheless, HSR does not function in all the cells produced during the life of a multicellular organism, e.g., early mouse embryos. Taking advantage of mouse transgenic and knockout models, we investigated the roles of trans (HSF 1 and 2) and cis (HSE) regulatory elements in the control of Hsp70.1 (Hspa1b) through several developmental steps from oocytes to blastocysts. Our studies confirm that, even in absence of any stress, HSF1 regulates Hsp70.1 in oocytes and early embryos. Our data emphasize the role of maternal and paternal HSFs in the developmentally regulated expression of Hsp70.1 observed when the zygotic genome activation occurs. Furthermore, in this unstressed developmental condition, affinity and binding to HSEs might be more permissive than in the stress response. Finally, submitting blastocyst to different stress conditions, we show that HSF2 is differentially required for Hsp expression and cell survival. Taken together, our findings indicate that the role of heat shock trans and cis regulatory elements evolve along the successive steps of early embryonic development.

Abstract: Direct cell–cell contact between haematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) and their cellular microenvironment is essential to maintain ‘stemness’. In cancer biology, focal adhesion (FA) proteins are involved in survival signal transduction in a wide variety of human tumours. To define the role of FA proteins in the haematopoietic microenvironment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), CD73-positive mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) were immunostained for paxillin, pFAK [Y397], and HSP90α/β and p130CAS, and analysed for reactivity, intensity and cellular localisation. Immunofluorescence microscopy allowed us to identify qualitative and quantitative differences, and subcellular localisation analysis revealed that in pathological MSCs, paxillin, pFAK [Y397], and HSP90α/β formed nuclear molecular complexes. Increased expression of paxillin, pFAK [Y397], and HSP90α/β and enhanced nuclear co-localisation of these proteins correlated with a consistent proliferative advantage in MSCs from patients with refractory anaemia with excess blasts (RAEB) and negatively impacted clonogenicity of HPCs. These results suggest that signalling via FA proteins could be implicated in HPC–MSC interactions. Further, because FAK is an HSP90α/β client protein, these results suggest the utility of HSP90α/β inhibition as a target for adjuvant therapy for myelodysplasia.

Abstract: The extraocular muscles (EOM) are spared from pathology in aging and many forms of muscular dystrophy. Despite many studies, this sparing remains an enigma. The EOM have a distinct embryonic lineage compared to somite-derived muscles, and we have shown that they continuously remodel throughout life, maintaining a population of activated satellite cells even in aging. These data suggested the hypothesis that there is a population of myogenic precursor cells (mpcs) in EOM that is different from those in limb, with either elevated numbers of stem cells and/or mpcs with superior proliferative capacity compared to mpcs in limb. Using flow cytometry, EOM and limb muscle mononuclear cells were compared, and a number of differences were seen. Using two different cell isolation methods, EOM have significantly more mpcs per mg muscle than limb skeletal muscle. One specific subpopulation significantly increased in EOM compared to limb was positive for CD34 and negative for Sca-1, M-cadherin, CD31, and CD45. We named these the EOMCD34 cells. Similar percentages of EOMCD34 cells were present in both newborn EOM and limb muscle. They were retained in aged EOM, whereas the population decreased significantly in adult limb muscle and were extremely scarce in aged limb muscle. Most importantly, the percentage of EOMCD34 cells was elevated in the EOM from both the mdx and the mdx/utrophin−/− (DKO) mouse models of DMD and extremely scarce in the limb muscles of these mice. In vitro, the EOMCD34 cells had myogenic potential, forming myotubes in differentiation media. After determining a media better able to induce proliferation in these cells, a fusion index was calculated. The cells isolated from EOM had a 40% higher fusion index compared to the same cells isolated from limb muscle. The EOMCD34 cells were resistant to both oxidative stress and mechanical injury. These data support our hypothesis that the EOM may be spared in aging and in muscular dystrophies due to a subpopulation of mpcs, the EOMCD34 cells, that are retained in significantly higher percentages in normal, mdx and DKO mice EOM, appear to be resistant to elevated levels of oxidative stress and toxins, and actively proliferate throughout life. Current studies are focused on further defining the EOMCD34 cell subtype molecularly, with the hopes that this may shed light on a cell type with potential therapeutic use in patients with sarcopenia, cachexia, or muscular dystrophy.

Abstract: Nucleoside transporters (NTs) play an essential role in the transport of nucleosides across cellular membranes. Equilibrative NTs (ENTs) allow facilitated diffusion of nucleosides and the prototypic ENT, hENT1, is primarily localized to the plasma membrane (PM). hENT1 is responsible for the uptake of nucleoside analog drugs used in treating viral infections and cancer, but despite its clinical importance, virtually nothing is known about the dynamics of the hENT1 life cycle including trafficking to the PM, endocytosis and degradation. Therefore, we followed the life cycle of tagged hENT1 (GFP- or FLAG-) transiently transfected into mammalian cells to gain insight into the sequence of events, timing and underlying mechanisms regulating the hENT1 life cycle. Protein translocation to the PM was examined using fixed and live cell confocal microscopy while endocytosis and degradation were analyzed by cell surface biotinylation and [35S] pulse chase analysis respectively. We determined that tagged hENT1 is trafficked to the PM in association with microtubules and incorporated in the plasma membrane where it subsequently undergoes clathrin-mediated endocytosis and recycling. Finally, internalized protein is degraded via the lysosomal pathway and observations suggest the complete life cycle of tagged hENT1 within these cells is approximately 14hours.

Abstract: Insulin resistance and hypertension have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease; however, little is known about the roles of insulin and mechanical force in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) remodeling. We investigated the contribution of mechanical stretch to insulin-induced VSMC proliferation. Thymidine incorporation was stimulated by insulin in stretched VSMCs, but not in un-stretched VSMCs. Insulin increased 2-deoxy-glucose incorporation in both stretched and un-stretched VSMCs. Mechanical stretch augmented insulin-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt phosphorylation. Inhibitors of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor tyrosine kinase and Src attenuated insulin-induced ERK and Akt phosphorylation, as well as thymidine incorporation, whereas 2-deoxy-glucose incorporation was not affected by these inhibitors. Moreover, stretch augmented insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 receptor expression, although it did not alter the expression of insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1. Insulin-induced ERK and Akt activation, and thymidine incorporation were inhibited by siRNA for the IGF-1 receptor. Mechanical stretch augments insulin-induced VSMC proliferation via upregulation of IGF-1 receptor, and downstream Src/EGF receptor-mediated ERK and Akt activation. Similar to in vitro experiment, IGF-1 receptor expression was also augmented in hypertensive rats. These results provide a basis for clarifying the molecular mechanisms of vascular remodeling in hypertensive patients with hyperinsulinemia.

Abstract: Unlike the well-characterized nuclear function of the Notch intracellular domain, it has been difficult to identify a nuclear role for the ligands of Notch. Here we provide evidence for the nuclear function of the Notch ligand Delta-like 1 in colon cancer (CC) cells exposed to butyrate. We demonstrate that the intracellular domain of Delta-like 1 (Dll1icd) augments the activity of Wnt signaling-dependent reporters and that of the promoter of the connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) gene. Data suggest that Dll1icd upregulates CTGF promoter activity through both direct and indirect mechanisms. The direct mechanism is supported by co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous Smad2/3 proteins and Dll1 and by chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses that revealed the occupancy of Dll1icd on CTGF promoter sequences containing a Smad binding element. The indirect upregulation of CTGF expression by Dll1 is likely due to the ability of Dll1icd to increase Wnt signaling, a pathway that targets CTGF. CTGF expression is induced in butyrate-treated CC cells and results from clonal growth assays support a role for CTGF in the cell growth-suppressive role of butyrate. In conclusion, integration of the Notch, Wnt, and TGFbeta/Activin signaling pathways is in part mediated by the interactions of Dll1 with Smad2/3 and Tcf4.

Abstract: Summary
The Lyme disease agent Borrelia burgdorferi is primarily transmitted to vertebrates by Ixodes ticks. The classical and alternative complement pathways are important in Borrelia eradication by the vertebrate host. We recently identified a tick salivary protein, designated P8, which reduced complement-mediated killing of Borrelia. We now discover that P8 interferes with the human lectin complement cascade, resulting in impaired neutrophil phagocytosis and chemotaxis and diminished Borrelia lysis. Therefore, P8 was renamed the tick salivary lectin pathway inhibitor (TSLPI). TSLPI-silenced ticks, or ticks exposed to TSLPI-immune mice, were hampered in Borrelia transmission. Moreover, Borrelia acquisition and persistence in tick midguts was impaired in ticks feeding on TSLPI-immunized, B. burgdorferi-infected mice. Together, our findings suggest an essential role for the lectin complement cascade in Borrelia eradication and demonstrate how a vector-borne pathogen co-opts a vector protein to facilitate early mammalian infection and vector colonization.

Abstract: ZNF689, a C2H2-type of zinc finger transcription factor, was suggested to play a key role in hepatocarcinogenesis. However, none of the target genes or potential roles of ZNF689 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have been elucidated. Here, we investigated the role of ZNF689 in HCC cell lines focusing on cell viability and apoptosis. We found that the knockdown of ZNF689 by its specific siRNA decreased cell viability of Huh7. Cell cycle analysis revealed that the ZNF689 knockdown increased the proportion of the sub-G1 population, accompanied by an increase of annexin V- and TUNEL-positive cells. Western blot analysis revealed that ZNF689 knockdown induced the expression of pro-apoptotic factors of Bcl-2 family, Bax, Bak and jBid. There was a correlation between the expression of ZNF689 and an anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) resistance of HCC cells. In vivo, ZNF689 siRNA reduced tumor viability in HepG2-bearing mice with statistical significance. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that nuclei of a significant portion of human HCC surgical specimens were positive for ZNF689. Taken together, our results indicate that ZNF689 blocks pro-apoptotic signaling by suppressing the Bak/Bax/Bid pathway, resulting in the progression of liver cancer and resistance to 5-FU. ZNF689 may be a promising chemotherapeutic target against liver cancer.

Abstract: The first event of differentiation in mammalian embryogenesis is the segregation of the inner cell mass and trophectoderm lineages in the blastocyst. Cellular and molecular events related to this process are still a controversial issue. During the years it was thought that first allocation of blastomeres before the blastocyst stage was done in the late eight-cell stage with the formation of inner and outer cells. Lately, many studies have pointed out that individual blastomeres at the four-cell stage differ in their developmental properties according to their position within the embryo. In this report, we wanted to elucidate whether these early decisions influence the production of mouse embryonic stem cell lines, so that a selective isolation of blastomeres at the four-cell stage to derive the lines could improve the efficiency of the derivation process. Results from blastomere tracking experiments support the idea of a different developmental potential of blastomeres within the four-cell stage embryo. However, we also show a high plasticity in the developmental pattern of blastomeres once isolated from the embryo, thus making all four-cell stage blastomeres equally competent to derive ESC lines.

Abstract: Translocation to cellular membranes is one of the hallmarks of PKC activation, occurring as a result of the generation of lipid secondary messengers in target membrane compartments. The activation-induced translocation of PKCs and binding to membranes is largely directed by their regulatory domains. We have previously reported that PKCη, a member of the novel subfamily and an epithelial specific isoform, is localized at the cytoplasm and ER/Golgi and is translocated to the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope upon short-term activation by PMA. Here we show that PKCη is shuttling between the cytoplasm and the nucleus and that upon etoposide induced DNA damage is tethered at the nuclear envelope. Although PKCη expression and its phosphorylation on the hydrophobic motif (Ser675) are increased by etoposide, this phosphorylation is not required for its accumulation at the nuclear envelope. Moreover, we demonstrate that the C1b domain is sufficient for translocation to the nuclear envelope. We further show that, similar to full-length PKCη, the C1b domain could also confer protection against etoposide-induced cell death. Our studies demonstrate translocation of PKCη to the nuclear envelope, and suggest that its spatial regulation could be important for its cellular functions including effects on cell death.

Abstract: Summary
The mammalian gastrointestinal tract and bloodstream are highly disparate biological niches that differ in concentrations of nutrients such as iron. However, some commensal-pathogenic microorganisms, such as the yeast Candida albicans, thrive in both environments. We report the evolution of a transcription circuit in C. albicans that controls iron uptake and determines its fitness in both niches. Our analysis of DNA-binding proteins that regulate iron uptake by this organism suggests the evolutionary intercalation of a transcriptional activator called Sef1 between two broadly conserved iron-responsive transcriptional repressors, Sfu1 and Hap43. Sef1 activates iron-uptake genes and promotes virulence in a mouse model of bloodstream infection, whereas Sfu1 represses iron-uptake genes and is dispensable for virulence but promotes gastrointestinal commensalism. Thus, C. albicans can alternate between genetic programs conferring resistance to iron depletion in the bloodstream versus iron toxicity in the gut, and this may represent a fundamental attribute of gastrointestinal commensal-pathogens.

Abstract: Factor for adipocyte differentiation 104 (fad104) is a regulator of adipogenesis and osteogenesis. Our previous study showed that fad104-deficient mice died immediately after birth, suggesting fad104 to be essential for neonatal survival. However, the cause of this rapid death is unclear. Here, we demonstrate the role of fad104 in neonatal survival. Phenotypic and morphological analyses showed that fad104-deficient mice died due to cyanosis-associated lung dysplasia including atelectasis. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry revealed that FAD104 was strongly expressed in ATII cells in the developing lung. Most importantly, the ATII cells in lungs were immature, and impaired the expression of surfactant-associated proteins. Collectively, these results indicate that fad104 has an indispensable role in lung maturation, especially the maturation and differentiation of ATII cells.

Abstract: POU4F2/Brn-3b transcription factor (referred to as Brn-3b) is elevated in >60% of breast cancers and profoundly alters growth and behaviour of cancer cells by regulating distinct subsets of target genes. Previous studies showed that Brn-3b was required to maximally transactivate small heat shock protein, HSPB1/Hsp-27 (referred to as Hsp-27), and consequently, Brn-3b expression correlated well with Hsp27 levels in human breast biopsies. In these studies, we showed that Brn-3b is increased in MCF7 breast cancer cells that survive following treatment with chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (Dox) with concomitant increases in Hsp-27 expression. Targeting of Brn-3b using short interfering RNA reduced Hsp-27 in Dox-treated cells, suggesting that Brn-3b regulates Hsp-27 expression under these conditions. Wound healing assays showed increased Brn-3b in Dox-treated migratory cells that also express Hsp-27. Interestingly, Hsp-27 phosphorylation and cellular localisation are also significantly altered at different times following Dox treatment. Thus, phospho-Hsp-27 (p-Hsp27) protein displayed widespread distribution after 24 hrs of Dox treatment but was restricted to the nucleus after 5 days. However, in drug-resistant cells (grown in Dox for > 1 month), p-Hsp-27 was excluded from nuclei and most of the cytoplasm and appeared to be associated with the cell membrane. Studies to determine how this protein promotes survival and migration in breast cancer cells showed that the protective effects were conferred by unphosphorylated Hsp-27 protein. Thus, complex and dynamic mechanisms underlie effects of Hsp-27 protein in breast cancer cells following treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs such as Dox, and this may contribute to invasiveness and drug resistance following chemotherapy.

Abstract: The WNT signaling pathway plays important roles in the self-renewal and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Little is known about WNT signaling in adipocyte differentiation of human MSCs. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that canonical and non-canonical WNTs differentially regulate in vitro adipocytogenesis in human MSCs. The expression of adipocyte gene PPARγ2, lipoprotein lipase, and adipsin increased during adipocytogenesis of hMSCs. Simultaneously, the expression of canonical WNT2, 10B, 13, and 14 decreased, whereas non-canonical WNT4 and 11 increased, and WNT5A was unchanged. A small molecule WNT mimetic, SB-216763, increased accumulation of β-catenin protein, inhibited induction of WNT4 and 11 and inhibited adipocytogenesis. In contrast, knockdown of β-catenin with siRNA resulted in spontaneous adipocytogenesis. These findings support the view that canonical WNT signaling inhibits and non-canonical WNT signaling promotes adipocytogenesis in adult human marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells.

Abstract: P-glycoprotein (P-gp) antagonists inhibit ceramide metabolism at the juncture of glycosylation. The purpose of this study was to test whether targeting P-gp would be a viable alternative to targeting glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) for enhancing ceramide cytotoxicity. A2780 wild-type, and multidrug-resistant 2780AD and NCI/ADR-RES human ovarian cancer cell lines and the cell-permeable ceramide analog, C6-ceramide (C6-cer), were employed. Compared to P-gp-poor A2780 cells, P-gp-rich 2780AD cells converted 3.7-fold more C6-cer to nontoxic C6-glucosylceramide (C6-GC), whereas cell-free GCS activities were equal. 2780AD cells displayed resistance to C6-cer (10μM) that was reversed by inclusion of the P-gp antagonist tamoxifen (5μM) but not by inclusion of a GCS inhibitor. Co-administration of C6-cer and P-gp antagonists was also effective in NCI/ADR-RES cells. For example, C6-cer, VX-710 (Biricodar), and cyclosporin A (cyc A) exposure resulted in viabilities of ~90% of control; however, C6-cer/VX-710 and C6-cer/cyc A additions were synergistic and resulted in viabilities of 22% and 17%, respectively. Further, whereas C6-ceramide and cyc A imparted 1.5- and 0-fold increases in caspase 3/7 activity, the combination produced a 3.5-fold increase. Although the upstream elements of cell death have not been elucidated, the novel C6-ceramide/P-gp antagonist combination merits further study and assessment of clinical translational potential.

Abstract: Mammalian ortholog of Scribble tumor suppressor has been reported to regulate cadherin-mediated epithelial cell adhesion by stabilizing the coupling of E-cadherin with catenins, but the molecular mechanism involved remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the localization of mouse Scribble at cadherin-based adherens junctions (AJs) and its phosphorylation state. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed that Scribble was localized at AJs as well as at the basolateral plasma membrane in epithelial cells. We found that Scribble was detected as two bands by Western blotting analysis and that the band shift to the higher molecular weight was dependent on its phosphorylation at Ser 1601. Triton X-100 treatment extracted Scribble localized on the basolateral membrane but not Scribble localized at AJs in cultured epithelial cells, and the Triton X-100-resistant Scribble was the Ser 1601-unphosphorylated form. Conversely, an in-house-generated antibody that predominantly recognized Ser 1601-phosphorylated Scribble only detected Scribble protein on the lateral plasma membrane. Furthermore, Ser 1601-unphosphorylated Scribble was selectively coprecipitated with E-cadherin–catenin complexes in E-cadherin-expressing mouse L fibroblasts. Taken together, these results suggest that the phosphorylation state of Scribble regulates its complex formation with the E-cadherin–catenin system and may control cadherin-mediated cell–cell adhesion.

Abstract: Differential cell migration and growth drives the organization of specific tissue forms and plays a critical role in embryonic development, tissue morphogenesis, and tumor invasion. Localized gradients of soluble factors and extracellular matrix have been shown to modulate cell migration and proliferation. Here we show that in addition to these factors, initial tissue geometry can feedback to generate differential proliferation, cell polarity, and migration patterns. We apply layer by layer polyelectrolyte assembly to confine multicellular organization and subsequently release cells to demonstrate the spatial patterns of cell migration and growth. The cell shapes, spreading areas, and cell–cell contacts are influenced strongly by the confining geometry. Cells within geometric ensembles are morphologically polarized. Symmetry breaking was observed for cells on the circular pattern and cells migrate toward the corners and in the direction parallel to the longest dimension of the geometric shapes. This migration pattern is disrupted when actomyosin based tension was inhibited. Cells near the edge or corner of geometric shapes proliferate while cells within do not. Regions of higher rate of cell migration corresponded to regions of concentrated growth. These findings demonstrate that multicellular organization can result in spatial patterns of migration and proliferation.

Abstract: Leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains 1 (LRIG1) is a recently discovered negative regulator of growth factor signaling. The LRIG1 integral membrane protein has been demonstrated to regulate various oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases, including epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR), by cell-autonomous mechanisms. Here, we investigated whether LRIG1 ectodomains were shed, and if LRIG1 could regulate cell proliferation and EGF signaling in a paracrine manner. Cells constitutively shed LRIG1 ectodomains in vitro, and shedding was modulated by known regulators of metalloproteases, including the ADAM17 specific inhibitor TAPI-2. Furthermore, shedding was enhanced by ectopic expression of Adam17. LRIG1 ectodomains appeared to be shed in vivo, as well, as demonstrated by immunoblotting of mouse and human tissue lysates. Ectopic expression of LRIG1 in lymphocytes suppressed EGF signaling in co-cultured fibroblastoid cells, demonstrating that shed LRIG1 ectodomains can function in a paracrine fashion. Purified LRIG1 ectodomains suppressed EGF signaling without any apparent downregulation of EGFR levels. Taken together, the results show that the LRIG1 ectodomain can be proteolytically shed and can function as a non-cell-autonomous regulator of growth factor signaling. Thus, LRIG1 or its ectodomain could have therapeutic potential in the treatment of growth factor receptor-dependent cancers.

Abstract: Climate warming involves not only a rise of air temperature means, but also more frequent heat waves in many regions on earth, and is predicted to intensify physiological stress especially in extremely changeable habitats like the intertidal. We investigated the heat-shock response (HSR) and enzymatic antioxidant defense levels of Patagonian shallow-water limpets, adapted to distinct tidal exposure conditions in the sub- and intertidal. Limpets were sampled in the temperate Northern Patagonia and the subpolar Magellan region. Expression levels of two Hsp70 genes and activities of the antioxidants superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were measured in submerged and 2- and 12-h air-exposed specimens. Air-exposed Patagonian limpets showed a tiered HSR increasing from South to North on the latitudinal gradient and from high to low shore levels on a tidal gradient. SOD activities in the Magellan region correlated with the tidal rhythm and were higher after 2 and 12 h when the tide was low at the experimental site compared to the 6 h value taken at high tide. This pattern was observed in intertidal and subtidal specimens, although subtidal individuals are little affected by tides. Our study shows that long-term thermal adaptation shapes the HSR in limpets, while the oxidative stress response is linked to the tidal rhythm. Close to the warm border of their distribution range, energy expenses to cope with stress might become overwhelming and represent one cause why the limpets are unable to colonize the shallow intertidal zone.

Abstract: Summary
Systemic acquired resistance (SAR), an inducible plant-defense response to local infection, requires the signaling molecule salicylic acid (SA) and the transcriptional coactivator NPR1, with concerted activation of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes. Arabidopsis sni1 is an npr1 suppressor and derepression of defense genes in sni1 causes reduced growth and fertility and increased homologous recombination. Characterizing suppressors of sni1, we identify the DNA damage repair proteins SSN2 and RAD51D as genetic and physical interactors with SNI1. During plant defense, SSN2 and possibly RAD51D replace the transcription repressor SNI1 at pathogenesis-related gene promoters. In the presence of SNI1, NPR1 is also required for SSN2 binding. Thus, coordinated action of SNI1, SSN2-RAD51D, and NPR1 ensures the tight control of plant immune gene expression. Given that the SSN2-RAD51D complex is conserved in eukaryotes, their dual function in homologous recombination and transcription regulation of plant-defense genes suggests a general link between these two stress responses.

Abstract: Upregulated ERK1/2 activity is correlated with androgen receptor (AR) downregulation in certain prostate cancer (PCa) that exhibits androgen deprivation-induced neuroendocrine differentiation, but its functional relevance requires elucidation. We found that sustained ERK1/2 activation using active Raf or MEK1/2 mutants is sufficient to induce AR downregulation at mRNA and protein levels in LNCaP. Downregulation of AR protein, but not mRNA, was blocked by proteasome inhibitors, MG132 and bortezomib, indicating that the pathway regulation is mediated at multiple points. Ectopic expression of a constitutively active AR inhibited Raf/MEK/ERK-mediated regulation of the differentiation markers, neuron-specific enolase and neutral endopeptidase, and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p16INK4A and p21CIP1, but not Rb phosphorylation and E2F1 expression, indicating that AR has a specific role in the pathway-mediated differentiation and growth inhibitory signaling. However, despite the sufficient role of Raf/MEK/ERK, its inhibition using U0126 or ERK1/2 knockdown could not block androgen deprivation-induced AR downregulation in an LNCaP neuroendocrine differentiation model, suggesting that additional signaling pathways are involved in the regulation. We additionally report that sustained Raf/MEK/ERK activity can downregulate full length as well as hormone binding domain-deficient AR isoforms in androgen-refractory C4-2 and CWR22Rv1, but not in LAPC4 and MDA-PCa-2b. Our study demonstrates a novel role of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in regulating AR expression in certain PCa types and provides an insight into PCa responses to its aberrant activation.

Abstract: The purpose of this work was to investigate if a coculture system of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) with endothelial cells (human umbilical vein endothelial cells, HUVEC) could modulate the phenotype and proliferation of harvested MSCs. In addition to previous investigations on the crosstalk between these two cell types, in the present work different relative cell ratios were analyzed for long, therapeutically relevant, culture periods. Moreover, MSCs osteogenic commitment was assessed in a non-osteogenic medium and in the presence of HUVECs through magnetic cell separation, cell quantification by flow cytometry, morphology by fluorescent microscopy, metabolic activity and gene expression of osteogenic markers. Collectively, the present findings demonstrate that, by coculturing MSCs with HUVECs, there was not only the promotion of osteogenic differentiation (and its enhancement, depending on the relative cell ratios used), but also a significant increase on MSCs proliferation. This augmentation in cell proliferation occurred independently of relative cell ratios, but was favored by higher relative amounts of HUVECs. Taken together, this data suggests that HUVECs not only modulate MSC phenotype but also their proliferation rate. Therefore, a coculture system of MSCs and HUVECs can a have a broad impact on bone tissue engineering approaches.

Abstract: The voltage-gated potassium channel, Kv1.3, plays an important role in regulating membrane excitability in diverse cell types ranging from T-lymphocytes to neurons. In the present study, we test the hypothesis that the C-terminal PDZ binding domain modulates the function and localization of Kv1.3. We created a mutant form of Kv1.3 that lacked the last three amino acids of the C-terminal PDZ-binding domain (Kv1.3ΔTDV). This form of Kv1.3 did not bind the PDZ domain containing protein, PSD95. We transfected wild type and mutant Kv1.3 into HEK293 cells and determined if the mutation affected current, Golgi localization, and surface expression of the channel. We found that cells transfected with Kv1.3ΔTDV had greater current and lower Golgi localization than those transfected with Kv1.3. Truncation of the C-terminal PDZ domain did not affect surface expression of Kv1.3. These findings suggest that PDZ-dependent interactions affect both Kv1.3 localization and function. The finding that current and Golgi localization changed without a corresponding change in surface expression suggests that PDZ interactions affect localization and function via independent mechanisms.

Abstract: Integrity of the epithelial barrier is determined by apical junctional complexes which also participate in the signalling pathways inducing intestinal cell differentiation. Lipid rafts (LR) have been proposed to play a role in the organization and the function of these intercellular complexes. This study investigated potential mechanisms by which LR could participate in the establishment of adherens junctions (AJ) and the initiation of enterocytic differentiation. We showed that the differentiation of epithelial cells in rat colons correlates with the emergence of LR. Using HT-29 cells we demonstrated that during the differentiation process, LR are required for the recruitment and the association of p120ctn to E-cadherin. Silencing of flotillin-1, a LR component, alters the recruitment of AJ proteins in LR and delays the expression of differentiation markers. Furthermore, the ability of p120ctn/E-cadherin complexes to support cell differentiation is altered in HT-29 Rac1N17 cells. These results show a contributory role of LR in the enterocytic differentiation process, which serve as signalling platforms for Rac1-mediated organization of AJ. A better understanding of the mechanism involved in the establishment of junctional complex and their role in enterocytic differentiation provides new insights into the regulation of intestinal homeostasis.
