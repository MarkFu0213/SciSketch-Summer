Abstract: Summary
Small non-coding RNAs called piRNAs serve as guides for an adaptable immune system that represses transposable elements in germ cells of Metazoa. In Drosophila the RDC complex, composed of Rhino, Deadlock and Cutoff (Cuff) bind chromatin of dual-strand piRNA clusters, special genomic regions, which encode piRNA precursors. The RDC complex is required for transcription of piRNA precursors, though the mechanism by which it licenses transcription remained unknown. Here, we show that Cuff prevents premature termination of RNA polymerase II. Cuff prevents cleavage of nascent RNA at poly(A) sites by interfering with recruitment of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex. Cuff also protects processed transcripts from degradation by the exonuclease Rat1. Our work reveals a conceptually different mechanism of transcriptional enhancement. In contrast to other factors that regulate termination by binding to specific signals on nascent RNA, the RDC complex inhibits termination in a chromatin-dependent and sequence-independent manner.

Abstract: Summary
TGF-β signaling regulates a variety of cellular processes, including proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, immune responses, and fibrogenesis. Here, we describe a lysine methylation-mediated mechanism that controls the pro-fibrogenic activity of TGF-β. We find that the methyltransferase Set9 potentiates TGF-β signaling by targeting Smad7, an inhibitory downstream effector. Smad7 methylation promotes interaction with the E3 ligase Arkadia and, thus, ubiquitination-dependent degradation. Depletion or pharmacological inhibition of Set9 results in elevated Smad7 protein levels and inhibits TGF-β-dependent expression of genes encoding extracellular matrix components. The inhibitory effect of Set9 on TGF-β-mediated extracellular matrix production is further demonstrated in mouse models of pulmonary fibrosis. Lung fibrosis induced by bleomycin or Ad-TGF-β treatment was highly compromised in Set9-deficient mice. These results uncover a complex regulatory interplay among multiple Smad7 modifications and highlight the possibility that protein methyltransferases may represent promising therapeutic targets for treating lung fibrosis.

Sequence Determinants of Intracellular Phase Separation by Complex Coacervation of a Disordered Protein,

Abstract: Summary
Liquid-liquid phase separation, driven by collective interactions among multivalent and intrinsically disordered proteins, is thought to mediate the formation of membrane-less organelles in cells. Using parallel cellular and in vitro assays, we show that the Nephrin intracellular domain (NICD), a disordered protein, drives intracellular phase separation via complex coacervation, whereby the negatively charged NICD co-assembles with positively charged partners to form protein-rich dense liquid droplets. Mutagenesis reveals that the driving force for phase separation depends on the overall amino acid composition and not the precise sequence of NICD. Instead, phase separation is promoted by one or more regions of high negative charge density and aromatic/hydrophobic residues that are distributed across the protein. Many disordered proteins share similar sequence characteristics with NICD, suggesting that complex coacervation may be a widely used mechanism to promote intracellular phase separation.

Abstract: Summary
N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) represents the most prevalent internal modification on mRNA and requires a multicomponent m6A methyltransferase complex in mammals. How their plant counterparts determine the global m6A modification landscape and its molecular link to plant development remain unknown. Here we show that FKBP12 INTERACTING PROTEIN 37 KD (FIP37) is a core component of the m6A methyltransferase complex, which underlies control of shoot stem cell fate in Arabidopsis. The mutants lacking FIP37 exhibit massive overproliferation of shoot meristems and a transcriptome-wide loss of m6A RNA modifications. We further demonstrate that FIP37 mediates m6A RNA modification on key shoot meristem genes inversely correlated with their mRNA stability, thus confining their transcript levels to prevent shoot meristem overproliferation. Our results suggest an indispensable role of FIP37 in mediating m6A mRNA modification, which is required for maintaining the shoot meristem as a renewable source for continuously producing all aerial organs in plants.

Abstract: Summary
The innate immune system distinguishes low-level homeostatic microbial stimuli from those of invasive pathogens, yet we lack understanding of how qualitatively similar microbial products yield context-specific macrophage functional responses. Using quantitative approaches, we found that NF-κB and MAPK signaling was activated at different concentrations of a stimulatory TLR4 ligand in both mouse and human macrophages. Above a threshold of ligand, MAPK were activated in a switch-like manner, facilitating production of inflammatory mediators. At ligand concentrations below this threshold, NF-κB signaling occurred, promoting expression of a restricted set of genes and macrophage priming. Among TLR-induced genes, we observed an inverse correlation between MAPK dependence and ligand sensitivity, highlighting the role of this signaling dichotomy in partitioning innate responses downstream of a single receptor. Our study reveals an evolutionarily conserved innate immune response system in which danger discrimination is enforced by distinct thresholds for NF-κB and MAPK activation, which provide sequential barriers to inflammatory mediator production.

Abstract: Summary
Recent studies suggest that the microprocessor (Drosha-DGCR8) complex can be recruited to chromatin to catalyze co-transcriptional processing of primary microRNAs (pri-miRNAs) in mammalian cells. However, the molecular mechanism of co-transcriptional miRNA processing is poorly understood. Here we find that HP1BP3, a histone H1-like chromatin protein, specifically associates with the microprocessor and promotes global miRNA biogenesis in human cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies reveal genome-wide co-localization of HP1BP3 and Drosha and HP1BP3-dependent Drosha binding to actively transcribed miRNA loci. Moreover, HP1BP3 specifically binds endogenous pri-miRNAs and facilitates the Drosha/pri-miRNA association in vivo. Knockdown of HP1BP3 compromises pri-miRNA processing by causing premature release of pri-miRNAs from the chromatin. Taken together, these studies suggest that HP1BP3 promotes co-transcriptional miRNA processing via chromatin retention of nascent pri-miRNA transcripts. This work significantly expands the functional repertoire of the H1 family of proteins and suggests the existence of chromatin retention factors for widespread co-transcriptional miRNA processing.

Abstract: Summary
Phosphorylation has been generally thought to activate the SR family of splicing factors for efficient splice-site recognition, but this idea is incompatible with an early observation that overexpression of an SR protein kinase, such as the CDC2-like kinase 1 (CLK1), weakens splice-site selection. Here, we report that CLK1 binds SR proteins but lacks the mechanism to release phosphorylated SR proteins, thus functionally inactivating the splicing factors. Interestingly, CLK1 overcomes this dilemma through a symbiotic relationship with the serine-arginine protein kinase 1 (SRPK1). We show that SRPK1 interacts with an RS-like domain in the N terminus of CLK1 to facilitate the release of phosphorylated SR proteins, which then promotes efficient splice-site recognition and subsequent spliceosome assembly. These findings reveal an unprecedented signaling mechanism by which two protein kinases fulfill separate catalytic features that are normally encoded in single kinases to institute phosphorylation control of pre-mRNA splicing in the nucleus.

Abstract: Summary
Immunological mediators that originate outside the nervous system can affect neuronal health. However, their roles in neurodegeneration remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the p38MAPK-mediated immune pathway activated in intestinal cells of Caenorhabditis elegans upon mitochondrial dysfunction protects neurons in a cell-non-autonomous fashion. Specifically, mitochondrial complex I dysfunction induced by rotenone activates the p38MAPK/CREB/ATF-7-dependent innate immune response pathway in intestinal cells of C. elegans. Activation of p38MAPK in the gut is neuroprotective. Enhancing the p38MAPK-mediated immune pathway in intestinal cells alone suppresses rotenone-induced dopaminergic neuron loss, while downregulating it in the intestine exacerbates neurodegeneration. The p38MAPK/ATF-7 immune pathway modulates autophagy and requires autophagy and the PTEN-induced putative kinase PINK-1 for conferring neuroprotection. Thus, mitochondrial damage induces the clearance of mitochondria by the immune pathway, protecting the organism from the toxic effects of mitochondrial dysfunction. We propose that mitochondria are subject to constant surveillance by innate immune mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
The neural crest is a transient, multipotent embryonic cell population in vertebrates giving rise to diverse cell types in adults via intermediate progenitors. The in vivo cell-fate potential and lineage segregation of these postembryonic progenitors is poorly understood, and it is unknown if and when the progenitors become fate restricted. We investigate the fate restriction in the neural crest-derived stem cells and intermediate progenitors in zebrafish, which give rise to three distinct adult pigment cell types: melanophores, iridophores, and xanthophores. By inducing clones in sox10-expressing cells, we trace and quantitatively compare the pigment cell progenitors at four stages, from embryogenesis to metamorphosis. At all stages, a large fraction of the progenitors are multipotent. These multipotent progenitors have a high proliferation ability, which diminishes with fate restriction. We suggest that multipotency of the nerve-associated progenitors lasting into metamorphosis may have facilitated the evolution of adult-specific traits in vertebrates.

Abstract: Summary
Cells undergoing xenobiotic or oxidative stress activate the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (Nrf2), which initiates an intrinsic “stress surveillance” pathway. We recently found that the cytokine IL-17D effects a form of extrinsic stress surveillance by inducing antitumor immunity, but how IL-17D is regulated remains unknown. Here, we show that Nrf2 induced IL-17D in cancer cell lines. Moreover, both Nrf2 and IL-17D were induced in primary tumors as well as during viral infection in vivo. Expression of IL-17D in tumors and virally infected cells is essential for optimal protection of the host as il17d−/− mice experienced a higher incidence of tumors and exacerbated viral infections compared to wild-type (WT) animals. Moreover, activating Nrf2 to induce IL-17D in established tumors led to natural killer cell-dependent tumor regression. These data demonstrate that Nrf2 can initiate both intrinsic and extrinsic stress surveillance pathways and highlight the use of Nrf2 agonists as immune therapies for cancer and infection.

Abstract: Summary
Developing tissues dictate the amount and type of innervation they require by secreting neurotrophins, which promote neuronal survival by activating distinct tyrosine kinase receptors. Here, we show that nerve growth factor (NGF) signaling through neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 1 (TrkA) directs innervation of the developing mouse femur to promote vascularization and osteoprogenitor lineage progression. At the start of primary ossification, TrkA-positive axons were observed at perichondrial bone surfaces, coincident with NGF expression in cells adjacent to centers of incipient ossification. Inactivation of TrkA signaling during embryogenesis in TrkAF592A mice impaired innervation, delayed vascular invasion of the primary and secondary ossification centers, decreased numbers of Osx-expressing osteoprogenitors, and decreased femoral length and volume. These same phenotypic abnormalities were observed in mice following tamoxifen-induced disruption of NGF in Col2-expressing perichondrial osteochondral progenitors. We conclude that NGF serves as a skeletal neurotrophin to promote sensory innervation of developing long bones, a process critical for normal primary and secondary ossification.

Abstract: Summary
Recent studies have suggested that human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) depend primarily on glycolysis and only increase oxidative metabolism during differentiation. Here, we demonstrate that both glycolytic and oxidative metabolism can support hPSC growth and that the metabolic phenotype of hPSCs is largely driven by nutrient availability. We comprehensively characterized hPSC metabolism by using 13C/2H stable isotope tracing and flux analysis to define the metabolic pathways supporting hPSC bioenergetics and biosynthesis. Although glycolytic flux consistently supported hPSC growth, chemically defined media strongly influenced the state of mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid metabolism. Lipid deficiency dramatically reprogramed pathways associated with fatty acid biosynthesis and NADPH regeneration, altering the mitochondrial function of cells and driving flux through the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway. Lipid supplementation mitigates this metabolic reprogramming and increases oxidative metabolism. These results demonstrate that self-renewing hPSCs can present distinct metabolic states and highlight the importance of medium nutrients on mitochondrial function and development.

Abstract: Summary
Adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and comparative gene identification 58 (CGI-58) are critical regulators of triacylglycerol (TAG) turnover. CGI-58 is thought to regulate TAG mobilization by stimulating the enzymatic activity of ATGL. However, it is not known whether this coactivation function of CGI-58 occurs in vivo. Moreover, the phenotype of human CGI-58 mutations suggests ATGL-independent functions. Through direct comparison of mice with single or double deficiency of CGI-58 and ATGL, we show here that CGI-58 knockdown causes hepatic steatosis in both the presence and absence of ATGL. CGI-58 also regulates hepatic diacylglycerol (DAG) and inflammation in an ATGL-independent manner. Interestingly, ATGL deficiency, but not CGI-58 deficiency, results in suppression of the hepatic and adipose de novo lipogenic program. Collectively, these findings show that CGI-58 regulates hepatic neutral lipid storage and inflammation in the genetic absence of ATGL, demonstrating that mechanisms driving TAG lipolysis in hepatocytes differ significantly from those in adipocytes.

Abstract: Summary
Inherited germline polymorphisms can cause gene expression levels in normal tissues to differ substantially between individuals. We present an analysis of the genetic architecture of normal adult skin from 470 genetically unique mice, demonstrating the effect of germline variants, skin tissue location, and perturbation by exogenous inflammation or tumorigenesis on gene signaling pathways. Gene networks related to specific cell types and signaling pathways, including sonic hedgehog (Shh), Wnt, Lgr family stem cell markers, and keratins, differed at these tissue sites, suggesting mechanisms for the differential susceptibility of dorsal and tail skin to development of skin diseases and tumorigenesis. The Pten tumor suppressor gene network is rewired in premalignant tumors compared to normal tissue, but this response to perturbation is lost during malignant progression. We present a software package for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) network analysis and demonstrate how network analysis of whole tissues provides insights into interactions between cell compartments and signaling molecules.

Abstract: Summary
The innate immune system is the first line of defense against Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC). Exposure of cells to GC lipooligosaccharides induces a strong immune response, leading to type I interferon (IFN) production via TLR4/MD-2. In addition to living freely in the extracellular space, GC can invade the cytoplasm to evade detection and elimination. Double-stranded DNA introduced into the cytosol binds and activates the enzyme cyclic-GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), which produces 2′3′-cGAMP and triggers STING/TBK-1/IRF3 activation, resulting in type I IFN expression. Here, we reveal a cytosolic response to GC DNA that also contributes to type I IFN induction. We demonstrate that complete IFN-β induction by live GC depends on both cGAS and TLR4. Type I IFN is detrimental to the host, and dysregulation of iron homeostasis genes may explain lower bacteria survival in cGAS−/− and TLR4−/− cells. Collectively, these observations reveal cooperation between TLRs and cGAS in immunity to GC infection.

Abstract: Summary
DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) is frequently mutated in hematological cancers; however, the underlying oncogenic mechanism remains elusive. Here, we report that the DNMT3A mutational hotspot at Arg882 (DNMT3AR882H) cooperates with NRAS mutation to transform hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and induce acute leukemia development. Mechanistically, DNMT3AR882H directly binds to and potentiates transactivation of stemness genes critical for leukemogenicity including Meis1, Mn1, and Hoxa gene cluster. DNMT3AR882H induces focal epigenetic alterations, including CpG hypomethylation and concurrent gain of active histone modifications, at cis-regulatory elements such as enhancers to facilitate gene transcription. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated ablation of a putative Meis1 enhancer carrying DNMT3AR882H-induced DNA hypomethylation impairs Meis1 expression. Importantly, DNMT3AR882H-induced gene-expression programs can be repressed through Dot1l inhibition, providing an attractive therapeutic strategy for DNMT3A-mutated leukemias.

Abstract: Summary
Never-in-mitosis A-related kinase 1 (Nek1) has established roles in apoptosis and cell cycle regulation. We show that human Nek1 regulates homologous recombination (HR) by phosphorylating Rad54 at Ser572 in late G2 phase. Nek1 deficiency as well as expression of unphosphorylatable Rad54 (Rad54-S572A) cause unresolved Rad51 foci and confer a defect in HR. Phospho-mimic Rad54 (Rad54-S572E), in contrast, promotes HR and rescues the HR defect associated with Nek1 loss. Although expression of phospho-mimic Rad54 is beneficial for HR, it causes Rad51 removal from chromatin and degradation of stalled replication forks in S phase. Thus, G2-specific phosphorylation of Rad54 by Nek1 promotes Rad51 chromatin removal during HR in G2 phase, and its absence in S phase is required for replication fork stability. In summary, Nek1 regulates Rad51 removal to orchestrate HR and replication fork stability.

Abstract: Summary
Although the function of the mammalian pancreas hinges on complex interactions of distinct cell types, gene expression profiles have primarily been described with bulk mixtures. Here we implemented a droplet-based, single-cell RNA-seq method to determine the transcriptomes of over 12,000 individual pancreatic cells from four human donors and two mouse strains. Cells could be divided into 15 clusters that matched previously characterized cell types: all endocrine cell types, including rare epsilon-cells; exocrine cell types; vascular cells; Schwann cells; quiescent and activated stellate cells; and four types of immune cells. We detected subpopulations of ductal cells with distinct expression profiles and validated their existence with immuno-histochemistry stains. Moreover, among human beta- cells, we detected heterogeneity in the regulation of genes relating to functional maturation and levels of ER stress. Finally, we deconvolved bulk gene expression samples using the single-cell data to detect disease-associated differential expression. Our dataset provides a resource for the discovery of novel cell type-specific transcription factors, signaling receptors, and medically relevant genes.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic adaptability is essential for tumor progression and includes cooperation between cancer cells with different metabolic phenotypes. Optimal glucose supply to glycolytic cancer cells occurs when oxidative cancer cells use lactate preferentially to glucose. However, using lactate instead of glucose mimics glucose deprivation, and glucose starvation induces autophagy. We report that lactate sustains autophagy in cancer. In cancer cells preferentially to normal cells, lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB), catalyzing the conversion of lactate and NAD+ to pyruvate, NADH and H+, controls lysosomal acidification, vesicle maturation, and intracellular proteolysis. LDHB activity is necessary for basal autophagy and cancer cell proliferation not only in oxidative cancer cells but also in glycolytic cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
NuA4 catalyzes the acetylation of nucleosomes at histone H4, which is a well-established epigenetic event, controlling many genomic processes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we report the crystal structures of the NuA4 core complex and a cryoelectron microscopy structure with the nucleosome. The structures show that the histone-binding pocket of the enzyme is rearranged, suggesting its activation. The enzyme binds the histone tail mainly through the target lysine residue, with a preference for a small residue at the −1 position. The complex engages the nucleosome at the dish face and orients its catalytic pocket close to the H4 tail to achieve selective acetylation. The combined data reveal a space-sequence double recognition mechanism of the histone tails by a modifying enzyme in the context of the nucleosome.

Abstract: Summary
Recent studies have shown that STAT3 negatively regulates the proliferation of muscle satellite cells (MuSCs) and injury-induced muscle regeneration. These studies have been largely based on STAT3 inhibitors, which may produce off-target effects and are not cell type-specific in vivo. Here, we examine the role of STAT3 in MuSCs using two different mouse models: a MuSC-specific Stat3 knockout line and a Stat3 (MuSC-specific)/dystrophin (Dmd) double knockout (dKO) line. Stat3−/− MuSCs from both mutant lines were defective in proliferation. Moreover, in both mutant strains, the MuSC pool shrank, and regeneration was compromised after injury, with defects more pronounced in dKO mice along with severe muscle inflammation and fibrosis. We analyzed the transcriptomes of MuSCs from dKO and Dmd−/− control mice and identified multiple STAT3 target genes, including Pax7. Collectively, our work reveals a critical role of STAT3 in adult MuSCs that regulates their self-renewal during injury-induced muscle regeneration.

Cortical Polarity of the RING Protein PAR-2 Is Maintained by Exchange Rate Kinetics at the Cortical-Cytoplasmic Boundary,

Abstract: Summary
Cell polarity arises through the spatial segregation of polarity regulators. PAR proteins are polarity regulators that localize asymmetrically to two opposing cortical domains. However, it is unclear how the spatially segregated PAR proteins interact to maintain their mutually exclusive partitioning. Here, single-molecule detection analysis in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos reveals that cortical PAR-2 diffuses only short distances, and, as a result, most PAR-2 molecules associate and dissociate from the cortex without crossing into the opposing domain. Our results show that cortical PAR-2 asymmetry is maintained by the local exchange reactions that occur at the cortical-cytoplasmic boundary. Additionally, we demonstrate that local exchange reactions are sufficient to maintain cortical asymmetry in a parameter-free mathematical model. These findings suggest that anterior and posterior PAR proteins primarily interact through the cytoplasmic pool and not via cortical diffusion.

Abstract: Summary
Uncovering phylogenetic patterns of cis-regulatory evolution remains a fundamental goal for evolutionary and developmental biology. Here, we characterize the evolution of regulatory loci in butterflies and moths using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) annotation of regulatory elements across three stages of head development. In the process we provide a high-quality, functionally annotated genome assembly for the butterfly, Heliconius erato. Comparing cis-regulatory element conservation across six lepidopteran genomes, we find that regulatory sequences evolve at a pace similar to that of protein-coding regions. We also observe that elements active at multiple developmental stages are markedly more conserved than elements with stage-specific activity. Surprisingly, we also find that stage-specific proximal and distal regulatory elements evolve at nearly identical rates. Our study provides a benchmark for genome-wide patterns of regulatory element evolution in insects, and it shows that developmental timing of activity strongly predicts patterns of regulatory sequence evolution.

Abstract: Summary
The complex biochemical effects of RAF inhibitors account for both the effectiveness and mechanisms of resistance to these drugs, but a unified mechanistic model has been lacking. Here we show that RAF inhibitors exert their effects via two distinct allosteric mechanisms. Drug resistance due to dimerization is determined by the position of the αC helix stabilized by inhibitor, whereas inhibitor-induced RAF priming and dimerization are the result of inhibitor-induced formation of the RAF/RAS-GTP complex. The biochemical effect of RAF inhibitor in cells is the combined outcome of the two mechanisms. Therapeutic strategies including αC-helix-IN inhibitors are more effective in multiple mutant BRAF-driven tumor models, including colorectal and thyroid BRAFV600E cancers, in which first-generation RAF inhibitors have been ineffective.

Abstract: Summary
We present a highly sensitive and selective chemical labeling and capture approach for genome-wide profiling of 5-hydroxylmethylcytosine (5hmC) using DNA isolated from ∼1,000 cells (nano-hmC-Seal). Using this technology, we assessed 5hmC occupancy and dynamics across different stages of hematopoietic differentiation. Nano-hmC-Seal profiling of purified Tet2-mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML) murine stem cells allowed us to identify leukemia-specific, differentially hydroxymethylated regions that harbor known and candidate disease-specific target genes with differential 5hmC peaks compared to normal stem cells. The change of 5hmC patterns in AML strongly correlates with differential gene expression, demonstrating the importance of dynamic alterations of 5hmC in regulating transcription in AML. Together, covalent 5hmC labeling offers an effective approach to study and detect DNA methylation dynamics in in vivo disease models and in limited clinical samples.

Abstract: Summary
Fascin is an F-actin-bundling protein shown to stabilize filopodia and regulate adhesion dynamics in migrating cells, and its expression is correlated with poor prognosis and increased metastatic potential in a number of cancers. Here, we identified the nuclear envelope protein nesprin-2 as a binding partner for fascin in a range of cell types in vitro and in vivo. Nesprin-2 interacts with fascin through a direct, F-actin-independent interaction, and this binding is distinct and separable from a role for fascin within filopodia at the cell periphery. Moreover, disrupting the interaction between fascin and nesprin-2 C-terminal domain leads to specific defects in F-actin coupling to the nuclear envelope, nuclear movement, and the ability of cells to deform their nucleus to invade through confined spaces. Together, our results uncover a role for fascin that operates independently of filopodia assembly to promote efficient cell migration and invasion.

KLF15 Enables Rapid Switching between Lipogenesis and Gluconeogenesis during Fasting,

Abstract: Summary
Hepatic lipogenesis is nutritionally regulated (i.e., downregulated during fasting and upregulated during the postprandial state) as an adaptation to the nutritional environment. While alterations in the expression level of the transcription factor SREBP-1c are known to be critical for nutritionally regulated lipogenesis, upstream mechanisms governing Srebf1 expression remain unclear. Here, we show that the fasting-induced transcription factor KLF15, a key regulator of gluconeogenesis, forms a complex with LXR/RXR, specifically on the Srebf1 promoter. This complex recruits the corepressor RIP140 instead of the coactivator SRC1, resulting in reduced Srebf1 and thus downstream lipogenic enzyme expression during the early and euglycemic period of fasting prior to hypoglycemia and PKA activation. Through this mechanism, KLF15 overexpression specifically ameliorates hypertriglyceridemia without affecting LXR-mediated cholesterol metabolism. These findings reveal a key molecular link between glucose and lipid metabolism and have therapeutic implications for the treatment of hyperlipidemia.

Abstract: Tail amputation (autotomy) in most lizards elicits a remarkable regenerative response leading to a new although simplified tail. No information on the trigger mechanism following wounding is known but cells from the stump initiate to proliferate and form a regenerative blastema. The present study shows that telomerases are mainly activated in the nuclei of various connective and muscle satellite cells of the stump, and in other tissues, probably responding to the wound signals. Western blotting detection also indicates that telomerase positive bands increases in the regenerating blastema in comparison to the normal tail. Light and ultrastructural immunocytochemistry localization of telomerase shows that 4–14 days post-amputation in lizards immunopositive nuclei of sparse cells located among the wounded tissues are accumulating into the forming blastema. These cells mainly include fibroblasts and fat cells of the connective tissue and satellite cells of muscles. Also some immature basophilic and polychromatophilic erytroblasts, lymphoblasts and myelocytes present within the Bone Marrow of the vertebrae show telomerase localization in their nuclei, but their contribution to the formation of the regenerative blastema remains undetermined. The study proposes that one of the initial mechanisms triggering cell proliferation for the formation of the blastema in lizards involve gene activation for the production of telomerase that stimulates the following signaling pathways for cell division and migration.

Abstract: Summary
During metazoan development, the temporal pattern of morphogen signaling is critical for organizing cell fates in space and time. Yet, tools for temporally controlling morphogen signaling within the embryo are still scarce. Here, we developed a photoactivatable Nodal receptor to determine how the temporal pattern of Nodal signaling affects cell fate specification during zebrafish gastrulation. By using this receptor to manipulate the duration of Nodal signaling in vivo by light, we show that extended Nodal signaling within the organizer promotes prechordal plate specification and suppresses endoderm differentiation. Endoderm differentiation is suppressed by extended Nodal signaling inducing expression of the transcriptional repressor goosecoid (gsc) in prechordal plate progenitors, which in turn restrains Nodal signaling from upregulating the endoderm differentiation gene sox17 within these cells. Thus, optogenetic manipulation of Nodal signaling identifies a critical role of Nodal signaling duration for organizer cell fate specification during gastrulation.

Abstract: Summary
A surface marker that distinctly identifies cardiac progenitors (CPs) is essential for the robust isolation of these cells, circumventing the necessity of genetic modification. Here, we demonstrate that a Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchor containing neurotrophic factor receptor, Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor receptor alpha 2 (Gfra2), specifically marks CPs. GFRA2 expression facilitates the isolation of CPs by fluorescence activated cell sorting from differentiating mouse and human pluripotent stem cells. Gfra2 mutants reveal an important role for GFRA2 in cardiomyocyte differentiation and development both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, the cardiac GFRA2 signaling pathway is distinct from the canonical pathway dependent on the RET tyrosine kinase and its established ligands. Collectively, our findings establish a platform for investigating the biology of CPs as a foundation for future development of CP transplantation for treating heart failure.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) induces necroptosis, a RIPK3/MLKL-dependent form of inflammatory cell death. In response to infection by Gram-negative bacteria, multiple receptors on macrophages, including TLR4, TNF, and type I IFN receptors, are concurrently activated, but it is unclear how they crosstalk to regulate necroptosis. We report that TLR4 activates CASPASE-8 to cleave and remove the deubiquitinase cylindromatosis (CYLD) in a TRIF- and RIPK1-dependent manner to disable necroptosis in macrophages. Inhibiting CASPASE-8 leads to CYLD-dependent necroptosis caused by the TNF produced in response to TLR4 ligation. While lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced necroptosis was abrogated in Tnf−/− macrophages, a soluble TNF antagonist was not able to do so in Tnf+/+ macrophages, indicating that necroptosis occurs in a cell-autonomous manner. Surprisingly, TNF-mediated auto-necroptosis of macrophages requires type I IFN, which primes the expression of key necroptosis-signaling molecules, including TNFR2 and MLKL. Thus, the TNF necroptosis pathway is regulated by both negative and positive crosstalk.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to be involved in many neurodegenerative diseases. The present study focused on the role of hsa-miR-144-3p in one of the neurodegenerative diseases, Parkinson’s disease (PD). Our study showed a remarkable down-regulation of miR-144-3p expression in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated SH-SY5Y cells. MiR-144-3p was then overexpressed and silenced in human SH-SY5Y cells by miRNA-mimics and miRNA-inhibitor transfections, respectively. Furthermore, β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) was identified as a target gene of miR-144-3p via a luciferase reporter assay. We found that miR-144-3p overexpression significantly inhibited the protein expression of APP. Since mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to be one of the major pathological events in PD, we also focused on the role of miR-144-3p and APP in regulating mitochondrial functions. Our study demonstrated that up-regulation of miR-144-3p increased expression of the key genes involved in maintaining mitochondrial function, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM). Moreover, there was also a significant increase in cellular ATP, cell viability and the relative copy number of mtDNA in the presence of miR-144-3p overexpression. In contrast, miR-144-3p silencing showed opposite effects. We also found that APP overexpression significantly decreased ATP level, cell viability, the relative copy number of mtDNA and the expression of these three genes, which reversed the effects of miR-144-3p overexpression. Taken together, these results show that miR-144-3p plays an important role in maintaining mitochondrial function, and its target gene APP is also involved in this process.

Abstract: Mutations in β-glucocerebrosidase (encoded by GBA1) cause Gaucher disease (GD), a lysosomal storage disorder, and increase the risk of developing Parkinson disease (PD). The pathogenetic relationship between the two disorders is unclear. Here, we characterised Ca2+ release in fibroblasts from type I GD and PD patients together with age-matched, asymptomatic carriers, all with the common N370S mutation in β-glucocerebrosidase. We show that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ release was potentiated in GD and PD patient fibroblasts but not in cells from asymptomatic carriers. ER Ca2+ signalling was also potentiated in fibroblasts from aged healthy subjects relative to younger individuals but not further increased in aged PD patient cells. Chemical or molecular inhibition of β-glucocerebrosidase in fibroblasts and a neuronal cell line did not affect ER Ca2+ signalling suggesting defects are independent of enzymatic activity loss. Conversely, lysosomal Ca2+ store content was reduced in PD fibroblasts and associated with age-dependent alterations in lysosomal morphology. Accelerated remodelling of Ca2+ stores by pathogenic GBA1 mutations may therefore feature in PD.

Abstract: Summary
The molecular clock relies on a delayed negative feedback loop of transcriptional regulation to generate oscillating gene expression. Although the principal components of the clock are present in all circadian neurons, different neuronal clusters have varying effects on rhythmic behavior, suggesting that the clocks they house are differently regulated. Combining biochemical and genetic techniques in Drosophila, we identify a phosphorylation program native to the master pacemaker neurons that regulates the timing of nuclear accumulation of the Period/Timeless repressor complex. GSK-3/SGG binds and phosphorylates Period-bound Timeless, triggering a CK2-mediated phosphorylation cascade. Mutations that block the hierarchical phosphorylation of Timeless in vitro also delay nuclear accumulation in both tissue culture and in vivo and predictably change rhythmic behavior. This two-kinase phosphorylation cascade is anatomically restricted to the eight master pacemaker neurons, distinguishing the regulatory mechanism of the molecular clock within these neurons from the other clocks that cooperate to govern behavioral rhythmicity.

Abstract: Summary
Estrogen receptor alpha-positive (ERα+) luminal tumors are the most frequent subtype of breast cancer. Stat1−/− mice develop mammary tumors that closely recapitulate the biological characteristics of this cancer subtype. To identify transforming events that contribute to tumorigenesis, we performed whole genome sequencing of Stat1−/− primary mammary tumors and matched normal tissues. This investigation identified somatic truncating mutations affecting the prolactin receptor (PRLR) in all tumor and no normal samples. Targeted sequencing confirmed the presence of these mutations in precancerous lesions, indicating that this is an early event in tumorigenesis. Functional evaluation of these heterozygous mutations in Stat1−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts showed that co-expression of truncated and wild-type PRLR led to aberrant STAT3 and STAT5 activation downstream of the receptor, cellular transformation in vitro, and tumor formation in vivo. In conclusion, truncating mutations of PRLR promote tumor growth in a model of human ERα+ breast cancer and warrant further investigation.

Abstract: Summary
In bacteria, RNA polymerase (RNAP) initiates transcription by synthesizing short transcripts that are either released or extended to allow RNAP to escape from the promoter. The mechanism of initial transcription is unclear due to the presence of transient intermediates and molecular heterogeneity. Here, we studied initial transcription on a lac promoter using single-molecule fluorescence observations of DNA scrunching on immobilized transcription complexes. Our work revealed a long pause (“initiation pause,” ∼20 s) after synthesis of a 6-mer RNA; such pauses can serve as regulatory checkpoints. Region sigma 3.2, which contains a loop blocking the RNA exit channel, was a major pausing determinant. We also obtained evidence for RNA backtracking during abortive initial transcription and for additional pausing prior to escape. We summarized our work in a model for initial transcription, in which pausing is controlled by a complex set of determinants that modulate the transition from a 6- to a 7-nt RNA.

Abstract: Oxidative stress drives cell death in a number of diseases including ischemic stroke and neurodegenerative diseases. A better understanding of how cells recover from oxidative stress is likely to lead to better treatments for stroke and other diseases. The recent evidence obtained in several models ties the process of lysosomal exocytosis to the clearance of protein aggregates and toxic metals. The mechanisms that regulate lysosomal exocytosis, under normal or pathological conditions, are only beginning to emerge. Here we provide evidence for the biphasic effect of oxidative stress on lysosomal exocytosis. Lysosomal exocytosis was measured using the extracellular levels of the lysosomal enzyme beta-hexosaminidase (ß-hex). Low levels or oxidative stress stimulated lysosomal exocytosis, but inhibited it at high levels. Deletion of the lysosomal ion channel TRPML1 eliminated the stimulatory effect of low levels of oxidative stress. The inhibitory effects of oxidative stress appear to target the component of lysosomal exocytosis that is driven by extracellular Ca2+. We propose that while moderate oxidative stress promotes cellular repair by stimulating lysosomal exocytosis, at high levels oxidative stress has a dual pathological effect: it directly causes cell damage and impairs damage repair by inhibiting lysosomal exocytosis. Harnessing these adaptive mechanisms may point to pharmacological interventions for diseases involving oxidative proteotoxicity or metal toxicity.

Abstract: In S-RNase-based self-incompatibility, S-RNase was previously thought to function as a selective RNase that inhibits pollen whose S-haplotype matches that in the pistil. In this study, we showed that S-RNase has a distinct effect on the regulation of Ca2+-permeable channel activity in the apical pollen tube in Pyrus pyrifolia. While non-self S-RNase has no effect, self S-RNase decreases the activity of Ca2+ channels and disrupts the Ca2+ gradient at the tip of the growing pollen tube during the gametophytic self-incompatibility (GSI) response. Extracellular Ca2+ influx was suppressed 5min after self S-RNase treatment, and self-pollen tube growth was reduced at 50min after self S-RNase treatment. In the self-incompatible response, the expression of Ca2+-related genes was inhibited before RNA degradation. Therefore, self S-RNase suppresses Ca2+ influx prior to arresting pollen tube growth via RNA degradation.

Abstract: Summary
MLKL, a key component downstream of RIPK3, is suggested to be a terminal executor of necroptosis. Genetic studies have revealed that Ripk3 ablation rescues embryonic lethality in Fadd- or Caspase-8-deficient mice. Given that RIPK3 has also been implicated in non-necroptotic pathways including apoptosis and inflammatory signaling, it remains unclear whether the lethality in Fadd−/− mice is indeed caused by necropotosis. Here, we show that genetic deletion of Mlkl rescues the developmental defect in Fadd-deficient mice and that Fadd−/−Mlkl−/− mice are viable and fertile. Mlkl−/−Fadd−/− mice display significantly accelerated lymphoproliferative disease characterized by lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly when compared to Ripk3−/− Fadd−/− mice. Mlkl−/−Fadd−/− bone-marrow-derived macrophages and dendritic cells have impaired NLRP3 inflammasome activation associated with defects in ASC speck formation and NF-κB-dependent NLRP3 transcription. Our findings reveal that MLKL and FADD play critical roles in preventing lymphoproliferative disease and activating the NLRP3 inflammasome.

Abstract: Summary
Aneuploidy and structural variations (SVs) generate cancer genomes containing a mixture of rearranged genomic segments with extensive somatic copy number alterations. However, existing methods can identify either SVs or allele-specific copy number alterations but not both simultaneously, which provides a limited view of cancer genome structure. Here, we introduce Weaver, an algorithm for the quantification and analysis of allele-specific copy numbers of SVs. Weaver uses a Markov random field to estimate joint probabilities of allele-specific copy numbers of SVs and their inter-connectivity based on paired-end whole-genome sequencing data. Weaver also predicts the timing of SVs relative to chromosome amplifications. We demonstrate the accuracy of Weaver using simulations and findings from whole-genome optical mapping. We apply Weaver to generate allele-specific copy numbers of SVs for MCF-7 and HeLa cell lines and identify recurrent SV patterns in 44 TCGA ovarian cancer whole-genome sequencing datasets. Our approach provides a more complete assessment of the complex genomic architectures inherent to many cancer genomes.

Abstract: Summary
Bioenergetic preferences of cancer cells foster tumor acidosis that in turn leads to dramatic reduction in glycolysis and glucose-derived acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA). Here, we show that the main source of this critical two-carbon intermediate becomes fatty acid (FA) oxidation in acidic pH-adapted cancer cells. FA-derived acetyl-CoA not only fuels the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and supports tumor cell respiration under acidosis, but also contributes to non-enzymatic mitochondrial protein hyperacetylation, thereby restraining complex I activity and ROS production. Also, while oxidative metabolism of glutamine supports the canonical TCA cycle in acidic conditions, reductive carboxylation of glutamine-derived α-ketoglutarate sustains FA synthesis. Concomitance of FA oxidation and synthesis is enabled upon sirtuin-mediated histone deacetylation and consecutive downregulation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase ACC2 making mitochondrial fatty acyl-CoA degradation compatible with cytosolic lipogenesis. Perturbations of these regulatory processes lead to tumor growth inhibitory effects further identifying FA metabolism as a critical determinant of tumor cell proliferation under acidosis.

Abstract: Summary
Highly proliferating cells are particularly dependent on glucose and glutamine for bioenergetics and macromolecule biosynthesis. The signals that respond to nutrient fluctuations to maintain metabolic homeostasis remain poorly understood. Here, we found that mTORC2 is activated by nutrient deprivation due to decreasing glutamine catabolites. We elucidate how mTORC2 modulates a glutamine-requiring biosynthetic pathway, the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) via regulation of expression of glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase 1 (GFAT1), the rate-limiting enzyme of the HBP. GFAT1 expression is dependent on sufficient amounts of glutaminolysis catabolites particularly α-ketoglutarate, which are generated in an mTORC2-dependent manner. Additionally, mTORC2 is essential for proper expression and nuclear accumulation of the GFAT1 transcriptional regulator, Xbp1s. Thus, while mTORC1 senses amino acid abundance to promote anabolism, mTORC2 responds to declining glutamine catabolites in order to restore metabolic homeostasis. Our findings uncover the role of mTORC2 in metabolic reprogramming and have implications for understanding insulin resistance and tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Allergic airway inflammation is one of the primary features of allergic asthma. Interleukin-33 (IL-33) is recognized as a key pro-inflammatory cytokine that mediates allergic airway inflammation, and its expression is elevated in this condition, but little is known about the regulatory mechanisms underlying IL-33 induction. Here, we show that the RNA binding protein Mex-3B plays a critical role in the induction of IL-33 in the development of allergic airway inflammation. We generated Mex3b−/− mice and found that they develop significantly less airway inflammation than wild-type mice due to reduced induction of IL-33. Furthermore, we show that Mex-3B directly upregulates IL-33 expression by inhibiting miR-487b-3p-mediated repression of IL-33. Moreover, we show that inhalation of an antisense oligonucleotide targeting Mex-3B suppresses allergic airway inflammation. Our data identify a signaling pathway that post-transcriptionally regulates IL-33 expression and suggest that Mex-3B could be a promising molecular target for the treatment of allergic asthma.

Abstract: Summary
Cells have evolved diverse mechanisms that maintain intracellular homeostasis in fluctuating environments. In bacteria, control is often exerted by bifunctional receptors acting as both kinase and phosphatase to regulate gene expression, a design known to provide robustness against noise. Yet how such antagonistic enzymatic activities are balanced as a function of environmental change remains poorly understood. We find that the bifunctional receptor that regulates K+ uptake in Escherichia coli is a dual sensor, which modulates its autokinase and phosphatase activities in response to both extracellular and intracellular K+ concentration. Using mathematical modeling, we show that dual sensing is a superior strategy for ensuring homeostasis when both the supply of and demand for a limiting resource fluctuate. By engineering standards, this molecular control system displays a strikingly high degree of functional integration, providing a reference for the vast numbers of receptors for which the sensing strategy remains elusive.

Abstract: Summary
In glioblastoma, invasion and proliferation are presumed to be mutually exclusive events; however, the molecular mechanisms that mediate this switch at the cellular level remain elusive. Previously, we have shown that phospho-OLIG2, a central-nervous-system-specific transcription factor, is essential for tumor growth and proliferation. Here, we show that the modulation of OLIG2 phosphorylation can trigger a switch between proliferation and invasion. Glioma cells with unphosphorylated OLIG2S10, S13, S14 are highly migratory and invasive, both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, unphosphorylated OLIG2 induces TGF-β2 expression and promotes invasive mesenchymal properties in glioma cells. Inhibition of the TGF-β2 pathway blocks this OLIG2-dependent invasion. Furthermore, ectopic expression of phosphomimetic Olig2 is sufficient to block TGF-β2-mediated invasion and reduce expression of invasion genes (ZEB1 and CD44). Our results not only provide a mechanistic insight into how cells switch from proliferation to invasion but also offer therapeutic opportunities for inhibiting dissemination of gliomas.

Abstract: Summary
In spinal muscular atrophy, a neurodegenerative disease caused by ubiquitous deficiency in the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein, sensory-motor synaptic dysfunction and increased excitability precede motor neuron (MN) loss. Whether central synaptic dysfunction and MN hyperexcitability are cell-autonomous events or they contribute to MN death is unknown. We addressed these issues using a stem-cell-based model of the motor circuit consisting of MNs and both excitatory and inhibitory interneurons (INs) in which SMN protein levels are selectively depleted. We show that SMN deficiency induces selective MN death through cell-autonomous mechanisms, while hyperexcitability is a non-cell-autonomous response of MNs to defects in pre-motor INs, leading to loss of glutamatergic synapses and reduced excitation. Findings from our in vitro model suggest that dysfunction and loss of MNs result from differential effects of SMN deficiency in distinct neurons of the motor circuit and that hyperexcitability does not trigger MN death.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) harbors the worst prognosis of any common solid tumor, and multiple failed clinical trials indicate therapeutic recalcitrance. Here, we use exome sequencing of patient tumors and find multiple conserved genetic alterations. However, the majority of tumors exhibit no clearly defined therapeutic target. High-throughput drug screens using patient-derived cell lines found rare examples of sensitivity to monotherapy, with most models requiring combination therapy. Using PDX models, we confirmed the effectiveness and selectivity of the identified treatment responses. Out of more than 500 single and combination drug regimens tested, no single treatment was effective for the majority of PDAC tumors, and each case had unique sensitivity profiles that could not be predicted using genetic analyses. These data indicate a shortcoming of reliance on genetic analysis to predict efficacy of currently available agents against PDAC and suggest that sensitivity profiling of patient-derived models could inform personalized therapy design for PDAC.

Abstract: Summary
Some neurons have the ability to enhance output voltage to input current with a preferred frequency, which is called resonance. Resonance is thought to be a basis for membrane potential oscillation. Although ion channels responsible for resonance have been reported, the precise mechanisms by which these channels work remain poorly understood. We have found that resonance is reduced but clearly present in the inferior olivary neurons of Cav3.1 T-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel knockout (KO) mice. The activation of Cav3.1 channels is strongly membrane potential dependent, but less frequency dependent. Residual resonance in Cav3.1 KO mice is abolished by a hyper-polarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel blocker, ZD7288, and is partially suppressed by voltage-dependent K+ channel blockers. Resonance is inhibited by ZD7288 in wild-type mice and impaired in HCN1 KO mice, suggesting that the HCN1 channel is essential for resonance. The ZD7288-sensitive current is nearly sinusoidal and strongly frequency dependent. These results suggest that Cav3.1 and HCN1 channels act as amplifying and resonating conductances, respectively.

Abstract: The repair and reconstruction of large bone defects remains as a significant clinical challenge mainly due to the insufficient vascularization. The prefabrication of vascular network based on cell sheet technique brings a promising potential for sufficient vascularization due to rich extracellular matrix (ECM) of cell sheets. However, the effect of different cell sheet ECM micro-environment on the formation of a vascular network has not been well understood. Here our goal is to study the effect of different cell sheets on the formation of a vascular network. First we cultured human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) under two culture conditions to obtain osteogenic differentiated cell sheet (ODCS) and undifferentiated cell sheet (UDCS), respectively. Then the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were seeded onto the surface of the two sheets at different seeding densities to fabricate pre-vascularized cell sheets. Our results indicated that the two sheets facilitated the alignment of HUVECs and promoted the formation of vascular networks. Quantitative analysis showed that the number of networks in ODCS was higher than that in the UDCS. The ECM of the two sheets was remodeled and rearranged during the tubulogenesis process. Furthermore, results showed that the optimal seeding density of HUVECs was 5×104cell/cm2. In summary, these results suggest that the vascularized ODCS has a promising potential to construct pre-vascularized tissue for bone repair.

Abstract: Summary
A significant challenge of functional genomics is to develop methods for genome-scale acquisition and analysis of cell biological data. Here, we present an integrated method that combines genome-wide genetic perturbation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with high-content screening to facilitate the genetic description of sub-cellular structures and compartment morphology. As proof of principle, we used a Rad52-GFP marker to examine DNA damage foci in ∼20 million single cells from ∼5,000 different mutant backgrounds in the context of selected genetic or chemical perturbations. Phenotypes were classified using a machine learning-based automated image analysis pipeline. 345 mutants were identified that had elevated numbers of DNA damage foci, almost half of which were identified only in sensitized backgrounds. Subsequent analysis of Vid22, a protein implicated in the DNA damage response, revealed that it acts together with the Sgs1 helicase at sites of DNA damage and preferentially binds G-quadruplex regions of the genome. This approach is extensible to numerous other cell biological markers and experimental systems.

Abstract: Summary
The scavenging of extracellular macromolecules by engulfment can sustain cell growth in a nutrient-depleted environment. Engulfed macromolecules are contained within vacuoles that are targeted for lysosome fusion to initiate degradation and nutrient export. We have shown that vacuoles containing engulfed material undergo mTORC1-dependent fission that redistributes degraded cargo back into the endosomal network. Here we identify the lipid kinase PIKfyve as a regulator of an alternative pathway that distributes engulfed contents in support of intracellular macromolecular synthesis during macropinocytosis, entosis, and phagocytosis. We find that PIKfyve regulates vacuole size in part through its downstream effector, the cationic transporter TRPML1. Furthermore, PIKfyve promotes recovery of nutrients from vacuoles, suggesting a potential link between PIKfyve activity and lysosomal nutrient export. During nutrient depletion, PIKfyve activity protects Ras-mutant cells from starvation-induced cell death and supports their proliferation. These data identify PIKfyve as a critical regulator of vacuole maturation and nutrient recovery during engulfment.

Abstract: Summary
Gene fusions are common cancer-causing mutations, but the molecular principles by which fusion protein products affect interaction networks and cause disease are not well understood. Here, we perform an integrative analysis of the structural, interactomic, and regulatory properties of thousands of putative fusion proteins. We demonstrate that genes that form fusions (i.e., parent genes) tend to be highly connected hub genes, whose protein products are enriched in structured and disordered interaction-mediating features. Fusion often results in the loss of these parental features and the depletion of regulatory sites such as post-translational modifications. Fusion products disproportionately connect proteins that did not previously interact in the protein interaction network. In this manner, fusion products can escape cellular regulation and constitutively rewire protein interaction networks. We suggest that the deregulation of central, interaction-prone proteins may represent a widespread mechanism by which fusion proteins alter the topology of cellular signaling pathways and promote cancer.

Abstract: The RNA-binding protein Rbfox3 is a well-known splicing regulator that is used as a marker for post-mitotic neurons in various vertebrate species. Although recent studies indicate a variable expression of Rbfox3 in non-neuronal tissues, including lung tissue, its cellular function in lung cancer remains largely unknown. Here, we report that the number of RBFOX3-positive cells in tumorous lung tissue is lower than that in normal lung tissue. As the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway is important in cancer progression, we investigated its role in RBFOX3 expression in A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells. TGF-β1 treatment inhibited RBFOX3 expression at the transcriptional level. Further, RBFOX3 depletion led to a change in the expression levels of a subset of proteins related to epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT), such as E-cadherin and Claudin-1, during TGF-β1-induced EMT. In immunofluorescence microscopic analysis, mesenchymal morphology was more prominent in RBFOX3-depleted cells than in control cells. These findings show that TGF-β-induced RBFOX3 inhibition plays an important role in EMT and propose a novel role for RBFOX3 in cancer progression.

Abstract: Summary
Mutant mitochondrial genomes (mtDNA) can be viewed as selfish genetic elements that persist in a state of heteroplasmy despite having potentially deleterious metabolic consequences. We sought to study regulation of selfish mtDNA dynamics. We establish that the large 3.1-kb deletion-bearing mtDNA variant uaDf5 is a selfish genome in Caenorhabditis elegans. Next, we show that uaDf5 mutant mtDNA replicates in addition to, not at the expense of, wild-type mtDNA. These data suggest the existence of a homeostatic copy-number control that is exploited by uaDf5 to “hitchhike” to high frequency. We also observe activation of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) in uaDf5 animals. Loss of UPRmt causes a decrease in uaDf5 frequency, whereas its constitutive activation increases uaDf5 levels. UPRmt activation protects uaDf5 from mitophagy. Taken together, we propose that mtDNA copy-number control and UPRmt represent two homeostatic response mechanisms that play important roles in regulating selfish mitochondrial genome dynamics.

Abstract: Summary
The homeostatic modulation of neurotransmitter release, termed presynaptic homeostatic potentiation (PHP), is a fundamental type of neuromodulation, conserved from Drosophila to humans, that stabilizes information transfer at synaptic connections throughout the nervous system. Here, we demonstrate that α2δ-3, an auxiliary subunit of the presynaptic calcium channel, is required for PHP. The α2δ gene family has been linked to chronic pain, epilepsy, autism, and the action of two psychiatric drugs: gabapentin and pregabalin. We demonstrate that loss of α2δ-3 blocks both the rapid induction and sustained expression of PHP due to a failure to potentiate presynaptic calcium influx and the RIM-dependent readily releasable vesicle pool. These deficits are independent of α2δ-3-mediated regulation of baseline calcium influx and presynaptic action potential waveform. α2δ proteins reside at the extracellular face of presynaptic release sites throughout the nervous system, a site ideal for mediating rapid, transsynaptic homeostatic signaling in health and disease.

Abstract: Summary
Signal transduction from a cell's surface to its interior requires dedicated signaling elements and a cellular environment conducive to signal propagation. Plant development, defense, and homeostasis rely on plasma membrane receptor-like kinases to perceive endogenous and environmental signals, but little is known about their immediate downstream targets and signaling modifiers. Using genetics, biochemistry, and live-cell imaging, we show that the VAP-RELATED SUPPRESSOR OF TMM (VST) family is required for ERECTA-mediated signaling in growth and cell-fate determination and reveal a role for ERECTA-LIKE2 in modulating signaling by its sister kinases. We show that VSTs are peripheral plasma membrane proteins that can form complexes with integral ER-membrane proteins, thereby potentially influencing the organization of the membrane milieu to promote efficient and differential signaling from the ERECTA-family members to their downstream intracellular targets.

Abstract: Summary
Interleukin-17 (IL-17)-producing helper T cells (Th17 cells) play an important role in autoimmune diseases. However, not all Th17 cells induce tissue inflammation or autoimmunity. Th17 cells require IL-23 receptor (IL-23R) signaling to become pathogenic. The transcriptional mechanisms controlling the pathogenicity of Th17 cells and IL-23R expression are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the canonical Notch signaling mediator RBPJ is a key driver of IL-23R expression. In the absence of RBPJ, Th17 cells fail to upregulate IL-23R, lack stability, and do not induce autoimmune tissue inflammation in vivo, whereas overexpression of IL-23R rescues this defect and promotes pathogenicity of RBPJ-deficient Th17 cells. RBPJ binds and trans-activates the Il23r promoter and induces IL-23R expression and represses anti-inflammatory IL-10 production in Th17 cells. We thus find that Notch signaling influences the development of pathogenic and non-pathogenic Th17 cells by reciprocally regulating IL-23R and IL-10 expression.

Abstract: Summary
The circadian clock is a ubiquitous timekeeping system that organizes the behavior and physiology of organisms over the day and night. Current models rely on transcriptional networks that coordinate circadian gene expression of thousands of transcripts. However, recent studies have uncovered phylogenetically conserved redox rhythms that can occur independently of transcriptional cycles. Here we identify the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), a critical source of the redox cofactor NADPH, as an important regulator of redox and transcriptional oscillations. Our results show that genetic and pharmacological inhibition of the PPP prolongs the period of circadian rhythms in human cells, mouse tissues, and fruit flies. These metabolic manipulations also cause a remodeling of circadian gene expression programs that involves the circadian transcription factors BMAL1 and CLOCK, and the redox-sensitive transcription factor NRF2. Thus, the PPP regulates circadian rhythms via NADPH metabolism, suggesting a pivotal role for NADPH availability in circadian timekeeping.

Abstract: Summary
Increased expression of vimentin intermediate filaments (VIFs) enhances directed cell migration, but the mechanism behind VIFs’ effect on motility is not understood. VIFs interact with microtubules, whose organization contributes to polarity maintenance in migrating cells. Here, we characterize the dynamic coordination of VIF and microtubule networks in wounded monolayers of retinal pigment epithelial cells. By genome editing, we fluorescently labeled endogenous vimentin and α-tubulin, and we developed computational image analysis to delineate architecture and interactions of the two networks. Our results show that VIFs assemble an ultrastructural copy of the previously polarized microtubule network. Because the VIF network is long-lived compared to the microtubule network, VIFs template future microtubule growth along previous microtubule tracks, thus providing a feedback mechanism that maintains cell polarity. VIF knockdown prevents cells from polarizing and migrating properly during wound healing. We suggest that VIFs’ templating function establishes a memory in microtubule organization that enhances persistence in cell polarization in general and migration in particular.

Abstract: Summary
MYCN amplification and MYC signaling are associated with high-risk neuroblastoma with poor prognosis. Treating these tumors remains challenging, although therapeutic approaches stimulating differentiation have generated considerable interest. We have previously shown that the MYCN-regulated miR-17∼92 cluster inhibits neuroblastoma differentiation by repressing estrogen receptor alpha. Here, we demonstrate that this microRNA (miRNA) cluster selectively targets several members of the nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) superfamily, and we present a unique NHR signature associated with the survival of neuroblastoma patients. We found that suppressing glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression in MYCN-driven patient and mouse tumors was associated with an undifferentiated phenotype and decreased survival. Importantly, MYCN inhibition and subsequent reactivation of GR signaling promotes neural differentiation and reduces tumor burden. Our findings reveal a key role for the miR-17∼92-regulated NHRs in neuroblastoma biology, thereby providing a potential differentiation approach for treating neuroblastoma patients.

Abstract: Summary
Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is an essential DNA virus sensor that triggers type I interferon (IFN) signaling by producing cGAMP to initiate antiviral immunity. However, post-translational regulation of cGAS remains largely unknown. We report that K48-linked ubiquitination of cGAS is a recognition signal for p62-depdendent selective autophagic degradation. The induction of TRIM14 by type I IFN accelerates cGAS stabilization by recruiting USP14 to cleave the ubiquitin chains of cGAS at lysine (K) 414. Knockout of TRIM14 impairs herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1)-triggered antiviral responses in a cGAS-dependent manner. Due to impaired type I IFN production, Trim14−/− mice are highly susceptible to lethal HSV-1 infection. Taken together, our findings reveal a positive feedback loop of cGAS signaling generated by TRIM14-USP14 and provide insights into the crosstalk between autophagy and type I IFN signaling in innate immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Elevated lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) expression is associated with poor outcome in tumor patients. Here we show that LDHA-associated lactic acid accumulation in melanomas inhibits tumor surveillance by T and NK cells. In immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice, tumors with reduced lactic acid production (Ldhalow) developed significantly slower than control tumors and showed increased infiltration with IFN-γ-producing T and NK cells. However, in Rag2–/–γc–/– mice, lacking lymphocytes and NK cells, and in Ifng–/– mice, Ldhalow and control cells formed tumors at similar rates. Pathophysiological concentrations of lactic acid prevented upregulation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) in T and NK cells, resulting in diminished IFN-γ production. Database analyses revealed negative correlations between LDHA expression and T cell activation markers in human melanoma patients. Our results demonstrate that lactic acid is a potent inhibitor of function and survival of T and NK cells leading to tumor immune escape.

Abstract: Summary
We adapted the yeast 2-hybrid assay to simultaneously uncover multiple transient protein interactions within a single screen by using a strategy termed DEEPN (dynamic enrichment for evaluation of protein networks). This approach incorporates high-throughput DNA sequencing and computation to follow competition among a plasmid population encoding interacting partners. To demonstrate the capacity of DEEPN, we identify a wide range of ubiquitin-binding proteins, including interactors that we verify biochemically. To demonstrate the specificity of DEEPN, we show that DEEPN allows simultaneous comparison of candidate interactors across multiple bait proteins, allowing differential interactions to be identified. This feature was used to identify interactors that distinguish between GTP- and GDP-bound conformations of Rab5.

Abstract: Summary
Bacteria must maintain mechanical integrity to withstand the large osmotic pressure differential across the cell membrane and wall. Although maintaining mechanical integrity is critical for proper cellular function, a fact exploited by prominent cell-wall-targeting antibiotics, the proteins that contribute to cellular mechanics remain unidentified. Here, we describe a high-throughput optical method for quantifying cell stiffness and apply this technique to a genome-wide collection of ∼4,000 Escherichia coli mutants. We identify genes with roles in diverse functional processes spanning cell-wall synthesis, energy production, and DNA replication and repair that significantly change cell stiffness when deleted. We observe that proteins with biochemically redundant roles in cell-wall synthesis exhibit different stiffness defects when deleted. Correlating our data with chemical screens reveals that reducing membrane potential generally increases cell stiffness. In total, our work demonstrates that bacterial cell stiffness is a property of both the cell wall and broader cell physiology and lays the groundwork for future systematic studies of mechanoregulation.

Abstract: Summary
Pro-apoptotic BAX is a cell fate regulator playing an important role in cellular homeostasis and pathological cell death. BAX is predominantly localized in the cytosol, where it has a quiescent monomer conformation. Following a pro-apoptotic trigger, cytosolic BAX is activated and translocates to the mitochondria to initiate mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. Here, cellular, biochemical, and structural data unexpectedly demonstrate that cytosolic BAX also has an inactive dimer conformation that regulates its activation. The full-length crystal structure of the inactive BAX dimer revealed an asymmetric interaction consistent with inhibition of the N-terminal conformational change of one protomer and the displacement of the C-terminal helix α9 of the second protomer. This autoinhibited BAX dimer dissociates to BAX monomers before BAX can be activated. Our data support a model whereby the degree of apoptosis induction is regulated by the conformation of cytosolic BAX and identify an unprecedented mechanism of cytosolic BAX inhibition.

Abstract: Summary
R-loops are three-stranded nucleic acid structures formed upon annealing of an RNA strand to one strand of duplex DNA. We profiled R-loops using a high-resolution, strand-specific methodology in human and mouse cell types. R-loops are prevalent, collectively occupying up to 5% of mammalian genomes. R-loop formation occurs over conserved genic hotspots such as promoter and terminator regions of poly(A)-dependent genes. In most cases, R-loops occur co-transcriptionally and undergo dynamic turnover. Detailed epigenomic profiling revealed that R-loops associate with specific chromatin signatures. At promoters, R-loops associate with a hyper-accessible state characteristic of unmethylated CpG island promoters. By contrast, terminal R-loops associate with an enhancer- and insulator-like state and define a broad class of transcription terminators. Together, this suggests that the retention of nascent RNA transcripts at their site of expression represents an abundant, dynamic, and programmed component of the mammalian chromatin that affects chromatin patterning and the control of gene expression.

Abstract: Glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPx3), an antioxidant enzyme, acts as a modulator of redox signaling, has immunomodulatory function, and catalyzes the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS). GPx3 has been identified as a tumor suppressor in many cancers. Although hyper-methylation of the GPx3 promoter has been shown to down-regulate its expression, other mechanisms by which GPx3 expression is regulated have not been reported. The aim of this study was to further elucidate the mechanisms of GPx3 regulation. GPx3 gene analysis predicted the presence of ten glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) on the GPx3 gene. This result prompted us to investigate whether GPx3 expression is regulated by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which is implicated in tumor response to chemotherapy. The corticosteroid dexamethasone (Dex) was used to examine the possible relationship between GR and GPx3 expression. Dex significantly induced GPx3 expression in H1299, H1650, and H1975 cell lines, which exhibit low levels of GPx3 expression under normal conditions. The results of EMSA and ChIP-PCR suggest that GR binds directly to GRE 6 and 7, both of which are located near the GPx3 promoter. Assessment of GPx3 transcription efficiency using a luciferase reporter system showed that blocking formation of the GR-GRE complexes reduced luciferase activity by 7-8-fold. Suppression of GR expression by siRNA transfection also induced down-regulation of GPx3. These data indicate that GPx3 expression can be regulated independently via epigenetic or GR-mediated mechanisms in lung cancer cells, and suggest that GPx3 could potentiate glucocorticoid (GC)-mediated anti-infla-mmatory signaling in lung cancer cells.

Abstract: To investigate the potential therapeutic effects of polyphenols in treating Pb induced renal dysfunction and intoxication and to explore the detailed underlying mechanisms. Wistar rats were divided into four groups: control groups (CT), Pb exposure groups (Pb), Pb plus Polyphenols groups (Pb+PP) and Polyphenols groups (PP). Animals were kept for 60 days and sacrificed for tests of urea, serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine. Histological evaluations were then performed. In vitro studies were performed using primary kidney mesangial cells to reveal detailed mechanisms. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) was used to evaluate cell viability. Pb induced cell apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and scavenging were tested by DCFH-DA. Expression level of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1-β (IL-1-β) and IL-6 were assayed by ELISA. Western blot and qPCR were used to measure the expression of ERK1/2, JNK1/2 and p38. Polyphenols have obvious protective effects on Pb induced renal dysfunction and intoxication both in vivo and in vitro. Polyphenols reduced Pb concentration and accumulation in kidney. Polyphenols also protected kidney mesangial cells from Pb induced apoptosis. Polyphenols scavenged Pb induced ROS generation and suppressed ROS-mediated ERK/JNK/p38 pathway. Downstream pro-inflammatory cytokines were inhibited in consistency. Polyphenol is protective in Pb induced renal intoxication and inflammatory responses. The underlying mechanisms lie on the antioxidant activity and ROS scavenging activity of polyphenols.

Abstract: Summary
An emerging therapeutic strategy for cancer is to induce selective lethality in a tumor by exploiting interactions between its driving mutations and specific drug targets. Here we use a multi-species approach to develop a resource of synthetic lethal interactions relevant to cancer therapy. First, we screen in yeast ∼169,000 potential interactions among orthologs of human tumor suppressor genes (TSG) and genes encoding drug targets across multiple genotoxic environments. Guided by the strongest signal, we evaluate thousands of TSG-drug combinations in HeLa cells, resulting in networks of conserved synthetic lethal interactions. Analysis of these networks reveals that interaction stability across environments and shared gene function increase the likelihood of observing an interaction in human cancer cells. Using these rules, we prioritize ∼105 human TSG-drug combinations for future follow-up. We validate interactions based on cell and/or patient survival, including topoisomerases with RAD17 and checkpoint kinases with BLM.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer immunotherapies are more effective in tumors with robust T cell infiltrates, but mechanisms to convert T cell-devoid tumors with active immunosuppression to those capable of recruiting T cells remain incompletely understood. Here, using genetically engineered mouse models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), we demonstrate that a single dose of agonistic CD40 antibody with chemotherapy rendered PDA susceptible to T cell-dependent destruction and potentiated durable remissions. CD40 stimulation caused a clonal expansion of T cells in the tumor, but the addition of chemotherapy optimized myeloid activation and T cell function. Although recent data highlight the requirement for innate sensors in cancer immunity, these canonical pathways—including TLRs, inflammasome, and type I interferon/STING—played no role in mediating the efficacy of CD40 and chemotherapy. Thus, CD40 functions as a non-redundant mechanism to convert the tumor microenvironment immunologically. Our data provide a rationale for a newly initiated clinical trial of CD40 and chemotherapy in PDA.

Abstract: Airway remodeling is a histopathological hallmark of chronic respiratory diseases that includes airway smooth muscle cell (ASMC) proliferation. Canonical transient receptor potential channel-3 (TRPC3)-encoded nonselective cation channels (NSCCs) are important native constitutively active channels that play significant roles in physiological and pathological conditions in ASMCs. Lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), known as lipoglycans and endotoxin, have been proven to be inducers of airway remodeling, though the mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesized that TRPC3 is important in LPS-induced airway remodeling by regulating ASMC proliferation. To test this hypothesis, mouse ASMCs were cultured with or without LPS for 48h. Cell viability, TRPC3 protein expression, NSCC currents and changes in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) were then analyzed using an MTT assay, western blotting, whole-cell patch clamp and calcium imaging, respectively. The results showed that LPS treatment significantly induced ASMC proliferation, up-regulation of TRPC3 protein expression and enhancement of NSCC currents, resting [Ca2+]i and ACh-elicited changes in [Ca2+]i. TRPC3 blocker Gd3+, TRPC3 blocking antibody or TRPC3 gene silencing by siRNA significantly inhibited LPS-induced up-regulation of TRPC3 protein, enhancement of NSCC currents, resting [Ca2+]i and ACh-elicited changes in [Ca2+]i, eventually inhibiting LPS-induced ASMCproliferation. These results demonstrated that TRPC3-mediated Ca2+ entry contributed to LPS-induced ASMC proliferation and identified TRPC3 as a possible key target in airway remodeling intervention.

Abstract: Summary
Synaptic ribbons are structures made largely of the protein Ribeye that hold synaptic vesicles near release sites in non-spiking cells in some sensory systems. Here, we introduce frameshift mutations in the two zebrafish genes encoding for Ribeye and thus remove Ribeye protein from neuromast hair cells. Despite Ribeye depletion, vesicles collect around ribbon-like structures that lack electron density, which we term “ghost ribbons.” Ghost ribbons are smaller in size but possess a similar number of smaller vesicles and are poorly localized to synapses and calcium channels. These hair cells exhibit enhanced exocytosis, as measured by capacitance, and recordings from afferent neurons post-synaptic to hair cells show no significant difference in spike rates. Our results suggest that Ribeye makes up most of the synaptic ribbon density in neuromast hair cells and is necessary for proper localization of calcium channels and synaptic ribbons.

Given that obesity impairs insulin action but paradoxically activates mTORC1, we tested whether insulin action and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) contribute to altered in vivo hepatic mitochondrial metabolism. Loss of hepatic insulin action for 2 weeks caused increased gluconeogenesis, mitochondrial anaplerosis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle oxidation, and ketogenesis. However, activation of mTORC1, induced by the loss of hepatic Tsc1, suppressed these fluxes. Only glycogen synthesis was impaired by both loss of insulin receptor and mTORC1 activation. Mice with a double knockout of the insulin receptor and Tsc1 had larger livers, hyperglycemia, severely impaired glycogen storage, and suppressed ketogenesis, as compared to those with loss of the liver insulin receptor alone. Thus, activation of hepatic mTORC1 opposes the catabolic effects of impaired insulin action under some nutritional states.

Abstract: Summary
The telomeric CTC1/STN1/TEN1 (CST) complex has been implicated in promoting replication recovery under replication stress at genomic regions, yet its precise role is unclear. Here, we report that STN1 is enriched at GC-rich repetitive sequences genome-wide in response to hydroxyurea (HU)-induced replication stress. STN1 deficiency exacerbates the fragility of these sequences under replication stress, resulting in chromosome fragmentation. We find that upon fork stalling, CST proteins form distinct nuclear foci that colocalize with RAD51. Furthermore, replication stress induces physical association of CST with RAD51 in an ATR-dependent manner. Strikingly, CST deficiency diminishes HU-induced RAD51 foci formation and reduces RAD51 recruitment to telomeres and non-telomeric GC-rich fragile sequences. Collectively, our findings establish that CST promotes RAD51 recruitment to GC-rich repetitive sequences in response to replication stress to facilitate replication restart, thereby providing insights into the mechanism underlying genome stability maintenance.

Abstract: Microglia are the resident immune cells in the central nervous system and many of their physiological functions are known to be linked to intracellular calcium (Ca2+) signaling. Here we show that isolated and purified mouse microglia—either freshly or cultured—display spontaneous and transient Ca2+ elevations lasting for around ten to twenty seconds and occurring at frequencies of around five to ten events per hour and cell. The events were absent after depletion of internal Ca2+ stores, by phospholipase C (PLC) inhibition or blockade of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs), but not by removal of extracellular Ca2+, indicating that Ca2+ is released from endoplasmic reticulum intracellular stores. We furthermore provide evidence that autocrine ATP release and subsequent activation of purinergic P2Y receptors is not the trigger for these events. Spontaneous Ca2+ transients did also occur after stimulation with Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and in glioma-associated microglia, but their kinetics differed from control conditions. We hypothesize that spontaneous Ca2+ transients reflect aspects of cellular homeostasis that are linked to regular and patho-physiological functions of microglia.

Abstract: Surface architecture of the buccal cavity and the surface organization of the luminal mucosa of the oesophagus, stomach, and intestine of the carnivorous fish M. flavolineatus from the Red Sea were studied by using SEM. The results revealed that M. flavolineatus has four kinds of teeth; curved-blunt, wedge-shaped, flattened crowns, molariform and papilliform. Three types of taste buds (type I, II and III) were recorded in the oropharyngeal cavity. It was observed that taste buds and teeth are co-located in the pharyngeal region. Characteristic patterns of microridges of the surface cells in the oral cavity and oesophagus were observed. Mucous cells are distributed in the lining of the mouth cavity, oesophagus, stomach, and intestine. Characteristic patterns of mucosal folds throughout the alimentary canal, concerning oesophagus, stomach, and intestine were revealed. Numerous gastric pits, which represents the emergence of the gastric glands, were recorded in the anterior and middle regions of the stomach. Complex patterns of the folds and mucous cells were recorded in the intestinal mucosa. These results were discussed with other teleost fishes.

Abstract: Summary
Clearance of entangled DNA from the anaphase mid-region must accurately proceed in order for chromosomes to segregate with high fidelity. Loss of Taz1 (fission yeast ortholog of human TRF1/TRF2) leads to stalled telomeric replication forks that trigger telomeric entanglements; the resolution of these entanglements fails at ≤20°C. Here, we investigate these entanglements and their promotion by the conserved replication/repair protein Rif1. Rif1 plays no role in taz1Δ fork stalling. Rather, Rif1 localizes to the anaphase mid-region and regulates the resolution of persisting DNA structures. This anaphase role for Rif1 is genetically separate from the role of Rif1 in S/G2, though both roles require binding to PP1 phosphatase, implying spatially and temporally distinct Rif1-regulated phosphatase substrates. Rif1 thus acts as a double-edged sword. Although it inhibits the resolution of taz1Δ telomere entanglements, it promotes the resolution of non-telomeric ultrafine anaphase bridges at ≤20°C. We suggest a unifying model for Rif1’s seemingly diverse roles in chromosome segregation in eukaryotes.

Abstract: Summary
The integrative physiology of inter-organ communication in lipophagy regulation is not well understood. Lipophagy and the cytosolic lipases ATGL and HSL contribute to lipid droplet (LD) mobilization; however, whether autophagy proteins engage with lipases to promote lipid utilization remains unknown. Here, we show that cold induces autophagy in proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons and activates lipophagy in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and liver in mice. Targeted activation of autophagy in POMC neurons via intra-hypothalamic rapamycin is sufficient to trigger lipid utilization in room temperature-housed mice. Conversely, inhibiting autophagy in POMC neurons or in peripheral tissues or denervating BAT blocks lipid utilization. Unexpectedly, the autophagosome marker LC3 is mechanistically coupled to ATGL-mediated lipolysis. ATGL exhibits LC3-interacting region (LIR) motifs, and mutating a single LIR motif on ATGL displaces ATGL from LD and disrupts lipolysis. Thus, cold-induced activation of central autophagy activates lipophagy and cytosolic lipases in a complementary manner to mediate lipolysis in peripheral tissues.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanisms underlying Zika virus (ZIKV)-related microcephaly and other neurodevelopment defects remain poorly understood. Here, we describe the derivation and characterization, including single-cell RNA-seq, of neocortical and spinal cord neuroepithelial stem (NES) cells to model early human neurodevelopment and ZIKV-related neuropathogenesis. By analyzing human NES cells, organotypic fetal brain slices, and a ZIKV-infected micrencephalic brain, we show that ZIKV infects both neocortical and spinal NES cells as well as their fetal homolog, radial glial cells (RGCs), causing disrupted mitoses, supernumerary centrosomes, structural disorganization, and cell death. ZIKV infection of NES cells and RGCs causes centrosomal depletion and mitochondrial sequestration of phospho-TBK1 during mitosis. We also found that nucleoside analogs inhibit ZIKV replication in NES cells, protecting them from ZIKV-induced pTBK1 relocalization and cell death. We established a model system of human neural stem cells to reveal cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental defects associated with ZIKV infection and its potential treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive neuroendocrine tumor, and no effective treatment is available to date. Mouse models of SCLC based on the inactivation of Rb1 and Trp53 show frequent amplifications of the Nfib and Mycl genes. Here, we report that, although overexpression of either transcription factor accelerates tumor growth, NFIB specifically promotes metastatic spread. High NFIB levels are associated with expansive growth of a poorly differentiated and almost exclusively E-cadherin (CDH1)-negative invasive tumor cell population. Consistent with the mouse data, we find that NFIB is overexpressed in almost all tested human metastatic high-grade neuroendocrine lung tumors, warranting further assessment of NFIB as a tumor progression marker in a clinical setting.

Abstract: Summary
Dietary iron intake and systemic iron balance are implicated in colorectal cancer (CRC) development, but the means by which iron contributes to CRC are unclear. Gene expression and functional studies demonstrated that the cellular iron importer, divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), is highly expressed in CRC through hypoxia-inducible factor 2α-dependent transcription. Colon-specific Dmt1 disruption resulted in a tumor-selective inhibitory effect of proliferation in mouse colon tumor models. Proteomic and genomic analyses identified an iron-regulated signaling axis mediated by cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), JAK1, and STAT3 in CRC progression. A pharmacological inhibitor of DMT1 antagonized the ability of iron to promote tumor growth in a CRC mouse model and a patient-derived CRC enteroid orthotopic model. Our studies implicate a growth-promoting signaling network instigated by elevated intracellular iron levels in tumorigenesis, offering molecular insights into how a key dietary component may contribute to CRC.

Abstract: Summary
The synchronized activity of six layers of cortical neurons is critical for sensory perception and the control of voluntary behavior, but little is known about the synaptic mechanisms of cortical synchrony across layers in behaving animals. We made single and dual whole-cell recordings from the primary somatosensory forepaw cortex in awake mice and show that L2/3 and L5 excitatory neurons have layer-specific intrinsic properties and membrane potential dynamics that shape laminar-specific firing rates and subthreshold synchrony. First, while sensory and movement-evoked synaptic input was tightly correlated across layers, spontaneous action potentials and slow spontaneous subthreshold fluctuations had laminar-specific timing; second, longer duration forepaw movement was associated with a decorrelation of subthreshold activity; third, spontaneous and sensory-evoked forepaw movements were signaled more strongly by L5 than L2/3 neurons. Together, our data suggest that the degree of translaminar synchrony is dependent upon the origin (sensory, spontaneous, and movement) of the synaptic input.

Abstract: Summary
Coordination of transcription in bacteria occurs at supra-operonic scales, but the extent, specificity, and mechanisms of such regulation are poorly understood. Here, we tackle this problem by profiling the transcriptome of the model organism Mycoplasma pneumoniae across 115 growth conditions. We identify three qualitatively different levels of co-expression corresponding to distinct relative orientations and intergenic properties of adjacent genes. We reveal that the degree of co-expression between co-directional adjacent operons, and more generally between genes, is tightly related to their capacity to be transcribed en bloc into the same mRNA. We further show that this genome-wide pervasive transcription of adjacent genes and operons is specifically repressed by DNA regions preferentially bound by RNA polymerases, by intrinsic terminators, and by large intergenic distances. Taken together, our findings suggest that the basal coordination of transcription is mediated by the physical entities and mechanical properties of the transcription process itself, and that operon-like behaviors may strongly vary from condition to condition.

Abstract: Summary
Faithful inheritance of eukaryotic genomes requires the orchestrated activation of multiple DNA replication origins (ORIs). Although origin firing is mechanistically conserved, how origins are specified and selected for activation varies across different model systems. Here, we provide a complete analysis of the nucleosomal landscape and replication program of the human parasite Leishmania major, building on a better evolutionary understanding of replication organization in Eukarya. We found that active transcription is a driving force for the nucleosomal organization of the L. major genome and that both the spatial and the temporal program of DNA replication can be explained as associated to RNA polymerase kinetics. This simple scenario likely provides flexibility and robustness to deal with the environmental changes that impose alterations in the genetic programs during parasitic life cycle stages. Our findings also suggest that coupling replication initiation to transcription elongation could be an ancient solution used by eukaryotic cells for origin maintenance.

Abstract: Summary
The flaviviruses dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) are severe health threats with rapidly expanding ranges. To identify the host cell dependencies of DENV and ZIKV, we completed orthologous functional genomic screens using RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 approaches. The screens recovered the ZIKV entry factor AXL as well as multiple host factors involved in endocytosis (RAB5C and RABGEF), heparin sulfation (NDST1 and EXT1), and transmembrane protein processing and maturation, including the endoplasmic reticulum membrane complex (EMC). We find that both flaviviruses require the EMC for their early stages of infection. Together, these studies generate a high-confidence, systems-wide view of human-flavivirus interactions and provide insights into the role of the EMC in flavivirus replication.

Abstract: Summary
In humans, Vγ9Vδ2 T cells respond to self and pathogen-associated, diphosphate-containing isoprenoids, also known as phosphoantigens (pAgs). However, activation and homeostasis of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that pAgs induced expression of the ecto-ATPase CD39, which, however, not only hydrolyzed ATP but also abrogated the γδ T cell receptor (TCR) agonistic activity of self and microbial pAgs (C5 to C15). Only mevalonate-derived geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP, C20) resisted CD39-mediated hydrolysis and acted as a regulator of CD39 expression and activity. GGPP enhanced macrophage differentiation in response to the tissue stress cytokine interleukin-15. In addition, GGPP-imprinted macrophage-like cells displayed increased capacity to produce IL-1β as well as the chemokine CCL2 and preferentially activated CD161-expressing CD4+ T cells in an innate-like manner. Our studies reveal a previously unrecognized immunoregulatory function of CD39 and highlight a particular role of GGPP among pAgs.

Abstract: Summary
Activation of the brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) stimulates energy expenditure through increasing of the resting metabolic rate (RMR), and this effect requires simultaneous suppression of the circulating and/or adipose RAS. To identify the mechanism by which the peripheral RAS opposes RMR control by the brain RAS, we examined mice with transgenic activation of the brain RAS (sRA mice). sRA mice exhibit increased RMR through increased energy flux in the inguinal adipose tissue, and this effect is attenuated by angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2) activation. AT2 activation in inguinal adipocytes opposes norepinephrine-induced uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) production and aspects of cellular respiration, but not lipolysis. AT2 activation also opposes inguinal adipocyte function and differentiation responses to epidermal growth factor (EGF). These results highlight a major, multifaceted role for AT2 within inguinal adipocytes in the control of RMR. The AT2 receptor may therefore contribute to body fat distribution and adipose depot-specific effects upon cardio-metabolic health.

Abstract: Summary
The body has the capacity to compensate for an occluded artery by creating a natural bypass upon increased fluid shear stress. How this mechanical force is translated into collateral artery growth (arteriogenesis) is unresolved. We show that extravasation of neutrophils mediated by the platelet receptor GPIbα and uPA results in Nox2-derived reactive oxygen radicals, which activate perivascular mast cells. These c-kit+/CXCR-4+ cells stimulate arteriogenesis by recruiting additional neutrophils as well as growth-promoting monocytes and T cells. Additionally, mast cells may directly contribute to vascular remodeling and vascular cell proliferation through increased MMP activity and by supplying growth-promoting factors. Boosting mast cell recruitment and activation effectively promotes arteriogenesis, thereby protecting tissue from severe ischemic damage. We thus find that perivascular mast cells are central regulators of shear stress-induced arteriogenesis by orchestrating leukocyte function and growth factor/cytokine release, thus providing a therapeutic target for treatment of vascular occlusive diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The precise molecular mechanisms that coordinate apoptosis and autophagy in cancer remain to be determined. Here, we provide evidence that the tumor suppressor promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) controls autophagosome formation at mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs) and, thus, autophagy induction. Our in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate how PML functions as a repressor of autophagy. PML loss promotes tumor development, providing a growth advantage to tumor cells that use autophagy as a cell survival strategy during stress conditions. These findings demonstrate that autophagy inhibition could be paired with a chemotherapeutic agent to develop anticancer strategies for tumors that present PML downregulation.

Abstract: Summary
How functionally diverse populations of pathogen-specific killer T cells are generated during an immune response remains unclear. Here, we propose that fine-tuning of CD8αβ co-receptor levels via histone acetylation plays a role in lineage fate. We show that lysine acetyltransferase 6A (KAT6A) is responsible for maintaining permissive Cd8 gene transcription and enabling robust effector responses during infection. KAT6A-deficient CD8+ T cells downregulated surface CD8 co-receptor expression during clonal expansion, a finding linked to reduced Cd8α transcripts and histone-H3 lysine 9 acetylation of the Cd8 locus. Loss of CD8 expression in KAT6A-deficient T cells correlated with reduced TCR signaling intensity and accelerated contraction of the effector-like memory compartment, whereas the long-lived memory compartment appeared unaffected, a result phenocopied by the removal of the Cd8 E8I enhancer element. These findings suggest a direct role of CD8αβ co-receptor expression and histone acetylation in shaping functional diversity within the cytotoxic T cell pool.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) has been instrumental to our current view of chromatin structure and function. It allows genome-wide mapping of histone marks, which demarcate biologically relevant domains. However, ChIP-seq is an ensemble measurement reporting the average occupancy of individual marks in a cell population. Consequently, our understanding of the combinatorial nature of chromatin states relies almost exclusively on correlation between the genomic distributions of individual marks. Here, we report the development of combinatorial-iChIP to determine the genome-wide co-occurrence of histone marks at single-nucleosome resolution. By comparing to a null model, we show that certain combinations of overlapping marks (H3K36me3 and H3K79me3) co-occur more frequently than would be expected by chance, while others (H3K4me3 and H3K36me3) do not, reflecting differences in the underlying chromatin pathways. We further use combinatorial-iChIP to illuminate aspects of the Set2-RPD3S pathway. This approach promises to improve our understanding of the combinatorial complexity of chromatin.

Abstract: Summary
Repetitive DNA is packaged into heterochromatin to maintain its integrity. We use CRISPR/Cas9 to induce DSBs in different mammalian heterochromatin structures. We demonstrate that in pericentric heterochromatin, DSBs are positionally stable in G1 and recruit NHEJ factors. In S/G2, DSBs are resected and relocate to the periphery of heterochromatin, where they are retained by RAD51. This is independent of chromatin relaxation but requires end resection and RAD51 exclusion from the core. DSBs that fail to relocate are engaged by NHEJ or SSA proteins. We propose that the spatial disconnection between end resection and RAD51 binding prevents the activation of mutagenic pathways and illegitimate recombination. Interestingly, in centromeric heterochromatin, DSBs recruit both NHEJ and HR proteins throughout the cell cycle. Our results highlight striking differences in the recruitment of DNA repair factors between pericentric and centromeric heterochromatin and suggest a model in which the commitment to specific DNA repair pathways regulates DSB position.

Abstract: Summary
Epithelial malignancies are effectively treated by antiangiogenics; however, acquired resistance is a major problem in cancer therapeutics. Epithelial tumors commonly have mutations in the MAPK/Pi3K-AKT pathways, which leads to high-rate aerobic glycolysis. Here, we show how multikinase inhibitor antiangiogenics (TKIs) induce hypoxia correction in spontaneous breast and lung tumor models. When this happens, the tumors downregulate glycolysis and switch to long-term reliance on mitochondrial respiration. A transcriptomic, metabolomic, and phosphoproteomic study revealed that this metabolic switch is mediated by downregulation of HIF1α and AKT and upregulation of AMPK, allowing uptake and degradation of fatty acids and ketone bodies. The switch renders mitochondrial respiration necessary for tumor survival. Agents like phenformin or ME344 induce synergistic tumor control when combined with TKIs, leading to metabolic synthetic lethality. Our study uncovers mechanistic insights in the process of tumor resistance to TKIs and may have clinical applicability.

Abstract: Summary
Network modules—topologically distinct groups of edges and nodes—that are preserved across datasets can reveal common features of organisms, tissues, cell types, and molecules. Many statistics to identify such modules have been developed, but testing their significance requires heuristics. Here, we demonstrate that current methods for assessing module preservation are systematically biased and produce skewed p values. We introduce NetRep, a rapid and computationally efficient method that uses a permutation approach to score module preservation without assuming data are normally distributed. NetRep produces unbiased p values and can distinguish between true and false positives during multiple hypothesis testing. We use NetRep to quantify preservation of gene coexpression modules across murine brain, liver, adipose, and muscle tissues. Complex patterns of multi-tissue preservation were revealed, including a liver-derived housekeeping module that displayed adipose- and muscle-specific association with body weight. Finally, we demonstrate the broader applicability of NetRep by quantifying preservation of bacterial networks in gut microbiota between men and women.

Abstract: Summary
A plethora of functional and genetic studies have suggested a key role for the IL-23 pathway in chronic intestinal inflammation. Currently, pathogenic actions of IL-23 have been ascribed to specific effects on immune cells. Herein, we unveil a protective role of IL-23R signaling. Mice deficient in IL-23R expression in intestinal epithelial cells (Il23RΔIEC) have reduced Reg3b expression, show a disturbed colonic microflora with an expansion of flagellated bacteria, and succumb to DSS colitis. Surprisingly, Il23RΔIEC mice show impaired mucosal IL-22 induction in response to IL-23. αThy-1 treatment significantly deteriorates colitis in Il23RΔIEC animals, which can be rescued by IL-22 application. Importantly, exogenous Reg3b administration rescues DSS-treated Il23RΔIEC mice by recruiting neutrophils as IL-22-producing cells, thereby restoring mucosal IL-22 levels. The study identifies a critical barrier-protective immune pathway that originates from, and is orchestrated by, IL-23R signaling in intestinal epithelial cells.

Abstract: Summary
Primary hyperoxaluria type I (PH1) is an autosomal-recessive inborn error of liver metabolism caused by alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT) deficiency. In silico modeling of liver metabolism in PH1 recapitulated accumulation of known biomarkers as well as alteration of histidine and histamine levels, which we confirmed in vitro, in vivo, and in PH1 patients. AGT-deficient mice showed decreased vascular permeability, a readout of in vivo histamine activity. Histamine reduction is most likely caused by increased catabolism of the histamine precursor histidine, triggered by rerouting of alanine flux from AGT to the glutamic-pyruvate transaminase (GPT, also known as the alanine-transaminase ALT). Alanine administration reduces histamine levels in wild-type mice, while overexpression of GPT in PH1 mice increases plasma histidine, normalizes histamine levels, restores vascular permeability, and decreases urinary oxalate levels. Our work demonstrates that genome-scale metabolic models are clinically relevant and can link genotype to phenotype in metabolic disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Kinesin motor proteins transport intracellular cargoes throughout cells by hydrolyzing ATP and moving along microtubule tracks. Intramolecular autoinhibitory interactions have been shown for several kinesins in vitro; however, the physiological significance of autoinhibition remains poorly understood. Here, we identified four mutations in the stalk region and motor domain of the synaptic vesicle (SV) kinesin UNC-104/KIF1A that specifically disrupt autoinhibition. These mutations augment both microtubule and cargo vesicle binding in vitro. In vivo, these mutations cause excessive activation of UNC-104, leading to decreased synaptic density, smaller synapses, and ectopic localization of SVs in the dendrite. We also show that the SV-bound small GTPase ARL-8 activates UNC-104 by unlocking the autoinhibition. These results demonstrate that the autoinhibitory mechanism is used to regulate the distribution of transport cargoes and is important for synaptogenesis in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the CNS and has a varying disease course as well as variable response to treatment. Biomarkers may therefore aid personalized treatment. We tested whether in vitro activation of MS patient-derived CD4+ T cells could reveal potential biomarkers. The dynamic gene expression response to activation was dysregulated in patient-derived CD4+ T cells. By integrating our findings with genome-wide association studies, we constructed a highly connected MS gene module, disclosing cell activation and chemotaxis as central components. Changes in several module genes were associated with differences in protein levels, which were measurable in cerebrospinal fluid and were used to classify patients from control individuals. In addition, these measurements could predict disease activity after 2 years and distinguish low and high responders to treatment in two additional, independent cohorts. While further validation is needed in larger cohorts prior to clinical implementation, we have uncovered a set of potentially promising biomarkers.

The N-Terminal Phosphorylation of RB by p38 Bypasses Its Inactivation by CDKs and Prevents Proliferation in Cancer Cells,

Abstract: Summary
Control of the G1/S phase transition by the Retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor is critical for the proliferation of normal cells in tissues, and its inactivation is one of the most fundamental events leading to cancer. Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) phosphorylation inactivates RB to promote cell cycle-regulated gene expression. Here we show that, upon stress, the p38 stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) maximizes cell survival by downregulating E2F gene expression through the targeting of RB. RB undergoes selective phosphorylation by p38 in its N terminus; these phosphorylations render RB insensitive to the inactivation by CDKs. p38 phosphorylation of RB increases its affinity toward the E2F transcription factor, represses gene expression, and delays cell-cycle progression. Remarkably, introduction of a RB phosphomimetic mutant in cancer cells reduces colony formation and decreases their proliferative and tumorigenic potential in mice.

Necroptosis Promotes Staphylococcus aureus Clearance by Inhibiting Excessive Inflammatory Signaling,

Abstract: Summary
Staphylococcus aureus triggers inflammation through inflammasome activation and recruitment of neutrophils, responses that are critical for pathogen clearance but are associated with substantial tissue damage. We postulated that necroptosis, cell death mediated by the RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL pathway, would function to limit pathological inflammation. In models of skin infection or sepsis, Mlkl−/− mice had high bacterial loads, an inability to limit interleukin-1b (IL-1b) production, and excessive inflammation. Similarly, mice treated with RIPK1 or RIPK3 inhibitors had increased bacterial loads in a model of sepsis. Ripk3−/− mice exhibited increased staphylococcal clearance and decreased inflammation in skin and systemic infection, due to direct effects of RIPK3 on IL-1b activation and apoptosis. In contrast to Casp1/4−/− mice with defective S. aureus killing, the poor outcomes of Mlkl−/− mice could not be attributed to impaired phagocytic function. We conclude that necroptotic cell death limits the pathological inflammation induced by S. aureus.
