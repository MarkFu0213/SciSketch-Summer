Abstract: In many different cell types neutral lipids can be stored in lipid droplets (LDs). Nowadays, LDs are viewed as dynamic organelles, which store and release fatty acids depending on energy demand (LD dynamics). Proteins like perilipin 2 (PLIN2) and PLIN5 decorate the LD membrane and are determinants of LD lipolysis and fat oxidation, thus affecting LD dynamics. Trained athletes and type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients both have high levels of intramyocellular lipid (IMCL). While IMCL content scales negatively with insulin resistance, athletes are highly insulin sensitive in contrast to T2D patients, the so-called athlete's paradox. Differences in LD dynamics may be an underlying factor explaining the athlete's paradox. We aimed to quantify PLIN2 and PLIN5 content at individual LDs as a reflection of the ability to switch between fatty acid release and storage depending on energy demand. Thus, we developed a novel fluorescent super-resolution microscopy approach and found that PLIN2 protein abundance at the LD surface was higher in T2D patients than in athletes. Localization of adipocyte triglyceride lipase (ATGL) to the LD surface was lower in LDs abundantly decorated with PLIN2. While PLIN5 abundance at the LD surface was similar in athletes and T2D patients, we have observed previously that the number of PLIN5 decorated LDs was higher in athletes, indicating more LDs in close association with mitochondria. Thus, in athletes interaction of LDs with mitochondria was more pronounced and LDs have the protein machinery to be more dynamic, while in T2D patients the LD pool is more inert. This observation contributes to our understanding of the athlete's paradox.

Abstract: The genome of the cabbage clubroot pathogen Plasmodiophora brassicae Woronin 1877 (Cercozoa, Rhizaria, SAR), possesses two expressed genes encoding the P450s that are phylogenetically related to the enzymes of oxylipin biosynthesis of the CYP74 clan. The cDNA of one of these genes (CYP50918A1) has been expressed in E. coli. The preferred substrate for the recombinant protein, the 13-hydroperoxide of α-linolenic acid (13-HPOT), was converted to the novel heterobicyclic oxylipins, plasmodiophorols A and B (1 and 2) at the ratio ca. 12:1. Compounds 1 and 2 were identified as the substituted 6-oxabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane and 2-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane (respectively) using the MS and NMR spectroscopy, as well as the chemical treatments. The 18O labelling experiments revealed the incorporation of a single 18O atom from [18O2]13-HPOT into the epoxide and ether functions of products 1 and 2 (respectively), but not into their OH groups. In contrast, the 18O from [18O2]water was incorporated only into the hydroxyl functions. One more minor polar product, plasmodiophorol C (3), identified as the cyclopentanediol, was formed through the hydrolysis of compounds 1 and 2. Plasmodiophorols A–C are the congeners of egregiachlorides, hybridalactone, ecklonialactones and related bicyclic oxylipins detected before in some brown and red algae. The mechanism of 13-HPOT conversions to plasmodiophorols A and B involving the epoxyallylic cation intermediate is proposed. The hydroperoxide bicyclase CYP50918A1 is the first enzyme controlling this kind of fatty acid hydroperoxide conversion.

Abstract: Objective
Apolipoprotein M (apoM) is an essential transporter of plasma Sphingosine-1-Phosphate (S1P), typically attached to all lipoprotein classes, but with a majority bound to high density lipoproteins (HDL). ApoM-deficient mice display an increased activity in brown adipose tissue and a concomitant fast turnover of triglycerides. In what manner apoM/S1P affect the triglyceride metabolism is however still unknown and explored in the present study.
Methods
Triglyceride turnover and potentially associated metabolic pathways were studied in the female human apoM transgenic mouse model (apoM-Tg) with increased plasma apoM and S1P levels. The model was compared with wild type (WT) mice.
Results
ApoM-Tg mice had a reduced plasma triglyceride turnover rate and a lower free fatty acid uptake in subcutaneous adipocytes compared to WT mice. Screening for potential molecular mechanisms furthermore revealed a reduction in plasma lipase activity in apoM-Tg animals. Overexpression of apoM also reduced the plasma levels of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21).
Conclusions
The study features the significant role of the apoM/S1P axis in maintaining a balanced triglyceride metabolism. Further, it also highlights the risk of inducing dyslipidaemia in patients receiving S1P-analouges and additionlly emphasizes the apoM/S1P axis as a potential therapeutic target in treatment of hypertriglyceridemia.

Abstract: Adipose tissue is important for systemic metabolic homeostasis in response to environmental changes, and adipogenesis involves dynamic transcriptional regulation. Ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes (TET1, 2 and 3) oxidize the 5-methylcytosine (5mC) in DNA to 5-hydroxylmethylcytosine (5hmC), which associates with transcriptional activation. Step by step, 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) are further generated by TETs and the cytosine can be restored through base-excision repair. It is still unclear how DNA demethylation is involved in adipogenesis. Through a phenotypic screen, we found TET inhibition decreased adipocyte differentiation from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Comparing with the undifferentiated MSCs, the differentiated adipocytes exhibited much higher levels of 5hmC and slightly increased 5fC and 5caC. Higher 5hmC was associated with better differentiation at single-cell level by image analysis. TET1 is upregulated in differentiation and depletion of it significantly impaired the gain of 5hmC. Furthermore, Tet1 depletion significantly hampered the adipocyte differentiation. Using RNA-seq, 5mC and 5hmC-DNA immunoprecipitation, we found that Tet1 knockout led to lower expression of genes associated with lipid metabolism and fat cell differentiation. Genes with loss of 5mC or gain of 5hmC in adipocytes include Lipe, Bmp4 and Rxra, etc. RXRα agonist partially rescued the inhibitory effect of Tet1 knockout for adipogenesis. So, Rxra is one of the critical TET1 modulated genes. Together, TET1-mediated active DNA demethylation plays an important role in adipogenesis.

Abstract: Autophagy is mediated by membrane-bound organelles and it is an intrinsic catabolic and recycling process of the cell, which is very important for the health of organisms. The biogenesis of autophagic membranes is still incompletely understood. In vitro studies suggest that Atg2 protein transports lipids presumably from the ER to the expanding autophagic structures. Autophagy research has focused heavily on proteins and very little is known about the lipid composition of autophagic membranes. Here we describe a method for immunopurification of autophagic structures from Drosophila melanogaster (an excellent model to study autophagy in a complete organism) for subsequent lipidomic analysis. Western blots of several organelle markers indicate the high purity of the isolated autophagic vesicles, visualized by various microscopy techniques. Mass spectrometry results show that phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is the dominant lipid class in wild type (control) membranes. We demonstrate that in Atg2 mutants (Atg2−), phosphatidylinositol (PI), negatively charged phosphatidylserine (PS), and phosphatidic acid (PA) with longer fatty acyl chains accumulate on stalled, negatively charged phagophores. Tandem mass spectrometry analysis of lipid species composing the lipid classes reveal the enrichment of unsaturated PE and phosphatidylcholine (PC) in controls versus PI, PS and PA species in Atg2−. Significant differences in the lipid profiles of control and Atg2− flies suggest that the lipid composition of autophagic membranes dynamically changes during their maturation. These lipidomic results also point to the in vivo lipid transport function of the Atg2 protein, pointing to its specific role in the transport of short fatty acyl chain PE species.

Abstract: Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles. Alterations in mitochondrial dynamics are causal or are linked to numerous neurodegenerative, neuromuscular, and metabolic diseases. It is generally thought that cells with altered mitochondrial structure are prone to mitochondrial dysfunction, increased reactive oxygen species generation and widespread oxidative damage. The objective of the current study was to investigate the relationship between mitochondrial dynamics and the master cellular antioxidant, glutathione (GSH). We reveal that mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking the mitochondrial fusion machinery display elevated levels of GSH, which limits oxidative damage. Moreover, targeted metabolomics and 13C isotopic labeling experiments demonstrate that cells lacking the inner membrane fusion GTPase OPA1 undergo widespread metabolic remodeling altering the balance of citric acid cycle intermediates and ultimately favoring GSH synthesis. Interestingly, the GSH precursor and antioxidant n-acetylcysteine did not increase GSH levels in OPA1 KO cells, suggesting that cysteine is not limiting for GSH production in this context. Post-mitotic neurons were unable to increase GSH production in the absence of OPA1. Finally, the ability to use glycolysis for ATP production was a requirement for GSH accumulation following OPA1 deletion. Thus, our results demonstrate a novel role for mitochondrial fusion in the regulation of GSH synthesis, and suggest that cysteine availability is not limiting for GSH synthesis in conditions of mitochondrial fragmentation. These findings provide a possible explanation for the heightened sensitivity of certain cell types to alterations in mitochondrial dynamics.

Abstract: Human membrane bound O-acyltransferase domain-containing 7 (MBOAT7), also known as lysophosphatidylinositol acyltransferase 1 (LPIAT1), is an enzyme involved in the acyl-chain remodeling of phospholipids via the Lands' cycle. The MBOAT7 rs641738 variant has been associated with the entire spectrum of fatty liver disease (FLD) and neurodevelopmental disorders, but the exact enzymatic activity and the catalytic site of the protein are still unestablished. Human wild type MBOAT7 and three MBOAT7 mutants missing in the putative catalytic residues (N321A, H356A, N321A + H356A) were produced into Pichia pastoris, and purified using Ni-affinity chromatography. The enzymatic activity of MBOAT7 wild type and mutants was assessed measuring the incorporation of radiolabeled fatty acids into lipid acceptors. MBOAT7 preferentially transferred 20:4 and 20:5 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI). On the contrary, MBOAT7 showed weak enzymatic activity for transferring saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, regardless the lipid substrate. Missense mutations in the putative catalytic residues (N321A, H356A, N321A + H356A) result in a loss of O-acyltransferase activity. Thus, MBOAT7 catalyzes the transfer of PUFAs to lipid acceptors. MBOAT7 shows the highest affinity for LPI, and missense mutations at the MBOAT7 putative catalytic dyad inhibit the O-acyltransferase activity of the protein. Our findings support the hypothesis that the association between the MBOAT7 rs641738 variant and the increased risk of NAFLD is mediated by changes in the hepatic phosphatidylinositol acyl-chain remodeling. Taken together, the increased knowledge of the enzymatic activity of MBOAT7 gives insights into the understanding on the basis of FLD.

Abstract: Ovarian cancer is the deadliest gynaecologic malignancy, and the five-year survival rate of patients is less than 35% worldwide. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a population of cells with stem-like characteristics that are thought to cause chemoresistance and recurrence. TRIM29 is aberrantly expressed in various cancers and associated with cancer development and progression. Previous studies showed that the upregulation of TRIM29 expression in pancreatic cancer is related to stem-like characteristics. However, the role of TRIM29 in ovarian cancer is poorly understood. In this study, we found that TRIM29 expression was increased at the translational level in both the cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells and clinical tissues. Increased TRIM29 expression was associated with a poor prognosis of patients with ovarian cancer. In addition, TRIM29 could enhance the CSC-like characteristics of the cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells. Recruitment of YTHDF1 to m6A-modified TRIM29 was involved in promoting TRIM29 translation in the cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells. Knockdown of YTHDF1 suppressed the CSC-like characteristics of the cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells, which could be rescued by ectopic expression of TRIM29. This study suggests TRIM29 may act as an oncogene to promote the CSC-like features of cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer in an m6A-YTHDF1-dependent manner. Due to the roles of TRIM29 and YTHDF1 in the promotion of CSC-like features, they may become potential therapeutic targets to combat the recurrence of ovarian cancer.

Abstract: The identification of novel physiological regulators that stimulate energy expenditure through brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity in substrate catalysis is of utmost importance to understand and treat metabolic diseases. Myoglobin (MB), known to store or transport oxygen in heart and skeletal muscles, has recently been found to bind fatty acids with physiological constants in its oxygenated form (i.e., MBO2). Here, we investigated the in vivo effect of MB expression on BAT activity. In particular, we studied mitochondrial function and lipid metabolism as essential determinants of energy expenditure in this tissue. We show in a MB-null (MBko) mouse model that MB expression in BAT impacts on the activity of brown adipocytes in a twofold manner: i) by elevating mitochondrial density plus maximal respiration capacity, and through that, by stimulating BAT oxidative metabolism along with the organelles` uncoupled respiration; and ii) by influencing the free fatty acids pool towards a palmitate-enriched composition and shifting the lipid droplet (LD) equilibrium towards higher counts of smaller droplets. These metabolic changes were accompanied by the up-regulated expression of thermogenesis markers UCP1, CIDEA, CIDEC, PGC1-α and PPAR-α in the BAT of MB wildtype (MBwt) mice. Along with the emergence of the “browning” BAT morphology, MBwt mice exhibited a leaner phenotype when compared to MBko littermates at 20 weeks of age. Our data shed novel insights into MB's role in linking oxygen and lipid-based thermogenic metabolism. The findings suggest potential new strategies of targeting the MB pathway to treat metabolic disorders related to diminishing energy expenditure.

Abstract: Fascial adipocytes are recently identified as a unique population of adipose cells, which have different developmental origins, anatomical locations, cytological and functional characteristics compared with subcutaneous or visceral adipocytes. Superficial fascia in rats (also in pigs but not obviously in mice) contains numbers of lineage committed preadipocytes which possess adipogenic potential in vivo. The present study aimed to investigate the physiological factors that contribute to fascial adipogenesis in rats. We detected that mast cells, adipose progenitor cells, and mature adipocytes distributed in certain fascia areas were closely associated with each other, and numerous heparin-loaded granules released from mast cells were distributed around fascial preadipocytes. The culture supernatants of rat peritoneal mast cells and RBL-2H3 mast cells contained 20–30 μg/ml of heparin, effectively activated PPAR-responsive luciferase activity, promoted mRNA and protein expressions of key adipogenic genes, and hence increased adipogenic differentiation of fascia- or epididymal adipose-derived stromal cells. Adipogenic effects of mast cell supernatants were mimicked by heparin but not by histamine or 5-hydroxytryptamine, and were antagonized by protamine sulfate. In rats, local administration of heparin-loaded microspheres for 30 days induced adipogenesis in local areas of superficial fascia. This adipogenic effects of heparin might be related by chain length of glucosamine units, because heparin stimulated stronger adipogenesis than dalteparin and enoxaparin with relatively short chains. Our findings suggested that mast cell and its granule heparin could serve as the endogenous physiological factors to initiate and accelerate local adipogenesis in superficial fascia, or in adipose tissue with the fascia naturally embedded inside.

Abstract: Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) plays an important role in cholesterol homeostasis by promoting the degradation of the LDL receptor (LDLR). PCSK9 loss-of-function mutations are associated with increased fasting plasma glucose levels and slightly elevated risk of type 2-diabetes. Considering the known detrimental effects of cholesterol accumulation in β-cell, and the widespread use of PCSK9 inhibitors to treat hypercholesterolemia, it is important to gain insight into the role of pancreatic PCSK9 in glucose homeostasis and β-cell function. We generated the first β-cell-specific KO of PCSK9 (βKO). PCSK9 mRNA and protein expression were reduced by 48% and 78% in βKO islets, respectively, indicating that β-cells constitute a major site of PCSK9 expression. In islets, loss of β-cell PCSK9 resulted in unchanged LDLR protein levels, but reduced LDLR mRNA, indicating that cholesterol internalization is enhanced and that β-cell PCSK9 promotes LDLR degradation. In contrast, whole body PCSK9 KO mice exhibited 2-fold higher LDLR protein levels in islets and a stable expression of cholesterogenic genes. Whole body KO and βKO mice presented normal glucose tolerance, insulin release in response to glucose load and insulin sensitivity. Ex vivo glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in presence or absence of fatty acids was similar in WT and KO islets. Like KO mice, individuals carrying loss-of-function PCSK9 variants may be protected from cholesterol-induced toxicity due to reduced circulating cholesterol levels. Using both whole body KO or βKO models, our data demonstrate that PCSK9 deletion in mouse does not have any toxic effect on β-cell function and glucose homeostasis.

Abstract: Endocannabinoids, such as anandamide (ANA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2AG), are lipid-signaling molecules that can be oxidized by lipid-peroxidizing enzymes, and this oxidation alters the bioactivity of these lipid mediators. Here, under strictly comparable experimental conditions, we explored whether ANA and 2AG function as substrates for four human (ALOX15, ALOX15B, ALOX12, ALOX5) and three mice Alox isoforms (Alox15, Alox12, Alox5) and compared the rates of product formation with those of arachidonic acid oxygenation. Except for ALOX5, the two endocannabinoids were more efficiently oxygenated than arachidonic acid by human ALOX isoforms. Mice Alox15 oxygenated ANA more efficiently than arachidonic acid, but the other mice Alox isoforms exhibited reduced reaction rates for endocannabinoid conversion. Like its human ortholog, mice Alox5 did not oxygenate ANA, but the formation of 5-HETE-containing 2AG derivatives was observed for this enzyme. 1AG and 2AG were similarly effective substrates for human ALOX isoforms. Molecular docking studies, the pattern of oxygenation products, and site-directed mutagenesis experiments suggested a similar substrate alignment of arachidonic acid and endocannabinoids at the active site of ALOX15 orthologs. The product specificity of arachidonic acid oxygenation was conserved for endocannabinoid metabolization, and the triad concept describing the molecular basis for the reaction specificity of ALOX15 orthologs is applicable for endocannabinoid oxygenation. Taken together, these data indicate that, except for ALOX5 orthologs, endocannabinoids are suitable substrates for most mammalian ALOX isoforms.

Abstract: Type-1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is associated with metabolic changes leading to alterations in glucose and lipid handling. While T1DM-associated effects on many major plasma lipids have been characterised, such effects on plasma free fatty acids (FFA) have not been fully examined. Using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, we measured the plasma concentrations of FFA species in individuals with T1DM (n = 44) and age/sex-matched healthy controls (n = 44). Relationships between FFA species and various parameters were evaluated. Plasma concentrations of myristate (14:0), palmitoleate (16:1), palmitate (16:0), linoleate (18:2), oleate (18:1c9), cis-vaccenate (18:1c11), eicosapentaenoate (20:5), arachidonate (20:4) and docosahexanoate (22:6) were reduced in the T1DM group (p < 0.0001 for all, except p = 0.0020 for eicosapentaenoate and p = 0.0068 for arachidonate); α-linolenate (18:3) and dihomo-γ-linolenate (20:3) concentrations were unchanged. The saturated/unsaturated FFA ratio, n-3/n-6 ratio, de novo lipogenesis index (palmitate (main lipogenesis product)/linoleate (only found in diet)) and elongase index (oleate/palmitoleate) were increased in the T1DM group (p = 0.0166, p = 0.0089, p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0008 respectively). The stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) index 1 (palmitoleate/palmitate) and index 2 (oleate/stearate) were reduced in T1DM (p < 0.0001 for both). The delta-(5)-desaturase (D5D) index (arachidonate/dihomo-γ-linolenate) was unchanged. Age and sex had no effect on plasma FFA concentrations in T1DM, while SCD1 index 1 was positively correlated (p = 0.098) and elongase index negatively correlated with age (p = 0.0363). HbA1c was negatively correlated with all plasma FFA concentrations measured except α-linolenate and dihomo-γ-linolenate. Correlations were observed between plasma FFA concentrations and cholesterol and HDL concentrations, but not LDL concentration or diabetes duration. Collectively, these results aid our understanding of T1DM and its effects on lipid metabolism.

Abstract: Recent meta-analyses suggest that high eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n−3) supplements may be beneficial in managing the symptoms of major depression. However, brain EPA levels are hundreds-fold lower than docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n−3), making the potential mechanisms of action of EPA in the brain less clear. Using a kinetic model the goal of this study was to determine how EPA impacts brain DHA levels. Following 8 weeks feeding of a 2% alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, 18:3n−3) or DHA diet (2% ALA + 2% DHA), 11-week-old Long Evans rats were infused with unesterified 13C-EPA at steady-state for 3 h with plasma collected at 30 min intervals and livers and brains collected after 3 h for determining DHA synthesis-accretion kinetics in multiple lipid fractions. Most of the newly synthesized liver 13C-DHA was in phosphatidylethanolamine (PE, 37%–56%), however, 75–80% of plasma 13C-DHA was found in triacylglycerols (TAG) at 14 ± 5 and 46 ± 12 nmol/g/day (p < 0.05) in the ALA and DHA group, respectively. In the brain, PE and phosphatidylserine (PS) accreted the most 13C-DHA, and DHA compared to ALA feeding shortened DHA half-lives in most lipid fractions, resulting in total brain DHA half-lives of 32 ± 6 and 96 ± 24 (days/g ± SEM), respectively (p < 0.05). EPA was predominantly converted and stored as PE-DHA in the liver, secreted to plasma as TAG-DHA and accumulated in brain as PE and PS-DHA. In conclusion, EPA is a substantial source for brain DHA turnover and suggests an important role for EPA in maintaining brain DHA levels.

Abstract: Rhodnius prolixus, a vector of Chagas disease, is a hematophagous insect that feeds exclusively on blood. Each blood meal is digested within the first fourteen days after feeding, providing substrates for lipid synthesis for storage and egg production. These events are precisely regulated and emerging evidence points to a key function of insulin-like peptides (ILPs) in this control. Here we investigated the role of insulin receptor in the regulation of nutrient metabolism in fed adult females. The expression of insulin receptor (RhoprIR) gene was determined in adult organs, and it was highest in ovaries and previtellogenic follicles. We generated insects with RNAi-mediated knockdown of RhoprIR to address the physiological role of this receptor. RhoprIR deficiency improved longevity and reduced triacylglycerol storage in the fat body, whereas blood digestion remained unchanged for seven days after blood meal. The lower lipid content was attributable to decreased de novo lipogenesis as well as reduced incorporation of hemolymph-derived fatty acids into newly synthesized lipids within this organ. Consistent with that, fat bodies from RhoprIR-deficient insects exhibited decreased gene expression levels of lipophorin receptor (RhoprLpR), glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 1 and 4 (RhoprGpat1 and RhoprGpat4), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (RhoprCpt1). Although hemolymph lipid profile was not affected by RhoprIR disruption, the concentration of circulating vitellogenin was increased. In line with these changes, RhoprIR-deficient females exhibited smaller ovaries and a marked reduction in oviposition. Taken together, these findings support a key role of insulin receptor in nutrient homeostasis, lipid synthesis and egg production following a blood meal.

Abstract: The expression of TMEM97, a regulator of cholesterol transport, has been reported to be enhanced in some tumour cells. We have recently shown that TMEM97 is involved in the proliferation of the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, probably through changes in store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). By using silencing and overexpression of TMEM97 in MDA-MB-231 cells (two manoeuvres that either reduce or increase the calcium influx, respectively), we show enhanced cholesterol uptake in these cells as compared to the non-tumoral breast cell line, MCF10A. The enhanced cholesterol uptake in MDA-MB-231 cells was inhibited by silencing TMEM97, while overexpression of this protein increased cholesterol uptake in MCF10A cells and, therefore, indicating that this protein plays a role in the enhanced cholesterol uptake in MDA-MB-231 cancer cell line. TMEM97 silencing and overexpression resulted in an increase and decrease in the association of cholesterol to the SOCE calcium channel Orai1, respectively. Interestingly, silencing of TMEM97 in MDA-MB-231 cells significantly reduced the co-localization of Orai1 with the SOCE regulatory protein STIM1. Finally, neither silencing nor overexpression of TMEM97 altered SOCE in MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with the cholesterol insensible mutant of Orai1(Y80E). Our results reveal a novel regulatory mechanism of SOCE that relies on TMEM97 activity that courses through the reduction of the cholesterol content in the plasma membrane, and subsequently, by impairing its interaction with Orai1.

Abstract: Current models of gene expression, which are based on single-molecule localization microscopy, acknowledge protein clustering and the formation of transcriptional condensates as a driving force of gene expression. However, these models largely omit the role of nuclear lipids and amongst them nuclear phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs) in particular. Moreover, the precise distribution of nuclear PIPs in the functional sub-nuclear domains remains elusive. The direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) provides an unprecedented resolution in biological imaging. Therefore, its use for imaging in the densely crowded cell nucleus is desired but also challenging. Here we present a dual-color dSTORM imaging and image analysis of nuclear PI(4,5)P2, PI(3,4)P2 and PI(4)P distribution while preserving the context of nuclear architecture. In the nucleoplasm, PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4)P2 co-pattern in close proximity with the subset of RNA polymerase II foci. PI(4,5)P2 is surrounded by fibrillarin in the nucleoli and all three PIPs are dispersed within the matrix formed by the nuclear speckle protein SON. PI(4,5)P2 is the most abundant nuclear PIP, while PI(4)P is a precursor for the biosynthesis of PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4)P2. Therefore, our data are relevant for the understanding the roles of nuclear PIPs and provide further evidence for the model in which nuclear PIPs represent a localization signal for the formation of lipo-ribonucleoprotein hubs in the nucleus. The discussed experimental pipeline is applicable for further functional studies on the role of other nuclear PIPs in the regulation of gene expression and beyond.

Abstract: Lipid droplets (LDs) perform several important functions like inflammatory responses, membrane trafficking, acts as secondary messengers, etc. rather than simply working as an energy reservoir. LDs have been implicated as a controlling factor in the progression of atherosclerosis followed by foam cell formation that derives from macrophages during the differentiation process. However, the role of LDs in monocyte differentiation or its further immunological function is still an area that mandates in-depth investigation. We report that LD dynamics is important for differentiation of monocytes and is absolutely required for sustained and prolonged functional activity of differentiated macrophages. In THP-1 cell line model system, we elucidated that increase in total LD content in monocyte by external lipid supplements, can induce monocyte differentiation independent of classical stimuli, PMA. Differential expression of PLIN2 and ATGL during the event, together with abrogation of de novo lipogenesis further confirmed the fact. Besides, an increase in LD content by free fatty acid supplement was able to exert a synergistic effect with PMA on differentiation and phagocytic activity compared to when they are used alone. Additionally, we have shown Rab5a to play a vital role in LDs biosynthesis/maturation in monocytes and thereby directly affecting differentiation of monocytes into macrophages via AKT pathway. Thus our study reveals the multi-faceted function of LDs during the process of monocyte to macrophage differentiation and thereby helping to maintain the functional activity.

Abstract: Endothelial cells, which help to maintain vascular homeostasis, can be functionally modulated by polyunsaturated fatty acids. Previously, we reported that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) reduced the viability of confluent EA.hy926 endothelial cells with caspase-3 activation. This study therefore examined the molecular mechanism by which DHA affects the viability of confluent cells, with a focus on the interaction between caspase-9, caspase-8, caspase-3, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) by Western blotting. Our results revealed that DHA induces apoptosis of confluent cells through both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, which requires activation of p38 MAPK, and involves activation of JNK, caspase-9, caspase-8 and caspase-3 with the exception that cleavage of caspase-8 was incomplete and truncated BID was not detected at the maximum time (8 h) examined. Apoptosis induced by high levels of DHA in healthy endothelial cells is achieved through positive feedback loops linking these MAPKs to multiple caspases, as well as negative feedback from p38 MAPK to JNK. However, only p38 MAPK is crucial in apoptosis induction in comparison with JNK or any other caspase examined. This study has expanded the knowledge on the molecular mechanism of DHA-induced apoptosis in human endothelial cells and has also implied the differential roles of MAP kinases and caspases in apoptosis.

Abstract: Chronic inflammation contributes toward the pathogenesis of numerous diseases including, but not limited to, obesity, autoimmunity, cardiovascular diseases, and cancers. The discovery of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), which are critical for resolving inflammation, has commenced investigation into targeting pathways of inflammation resolution to improve physiological outcomes. SPMs are predominately synthesized from the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids. Therefore, one viable strategy to promote inflammation resolution would be to increase dietary intake of EPA/DHA, which are deficient in select populations. However, there are inconsistencies between the use of EPA/DHA as dietary or pharmacological supplements and improved inflammatory status. Herein, we review the literature on the relationship between the high n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio, downstream SPM biosynthesis, and inflammatory endpoints. We highlight key studies that have investigated how dietary intake of EPA/DHA increase tissue SPMs and their effects on inflammation. We also discuss the biochemical pathways by which EPA/DHA drive SPM biosynthesis and underscore mechanistic gaps in knowledge about these pathways which include a neglect for host genetics/ethnic differences in SPM metabolism, sexual dimorphism in SPM levels, and potential competition from select dietary n-6 PUFAs for enzymes of SPM synthesis. Altogether, establishing how dietary PUFAs control SPM biosynthesis in a genetic- and sex-dependent manner will drive new precision nutrition studies with EPA/DHA to prevent chronic inflammation in select populations.

Abstract: The atherosclerosis “iron hypothesis” generates a fair amount of debate since it has been proposed. Here, we revisited the “iron hypothesis” by examining whether dietary iron overload would intensify iron deposition in plaques and thus lead to further exacerbation of atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE KO) mice. ApoE KO mice were fed either a normal chow diet (ND) or a high fat diet (HFD) supplemented with or without 2% carbonyl iron (Fe) for 16 weeks. However, contrary to our assumption, dietary iron overloading did not intensify, but rather diminished the atherosclerotic lesion area by 65.3%, which was accompanied by significantly decreased serum total cholesterol, triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol contents, together with hepatic lipid accumulation decline, despite the evident existence of aortic iron accumulation and the typical signs of iron overload in ApoE KO mice. Using isobaric tag for absolute quantification (iTRAQ) proteomics approach, hepatic CD36 and fatty acid binding proteins-mediated fatty acid (FA) uptake and trafficking impairment were identified as the key potential pathomechanisms by which iron overload diminishes atherosclerotic lesions. Furthermore, downstream hepatic FA de novo biosynthesis was enhanced and FA oxidation was inhibited to compensate for the FA deficiency triggered by iron overload-impaired fatty acid uptake and trafficking. Our findings suggested that dietary iron overload is not atherogenic in ApoE KO mice, and more research efforts are warranted to revisit the “iron hypothesis” of atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Rat costochondral cartilage growth plate chondrocytes exhibit cell sex-specific responses to 17β-estradiol (E2), testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Mechanistically, E2 and DHT stimulate proliferation and extracellular matrix synthesis in chondrocytes from female and male rats, respectively, by signaling through protein kinase C (PKC) and phospholipase C (PLC). Estrogen receptors (ERα; ERβ) and androgen receptors (ARs) are present in both male and female cells, but it is not known whether they interact to elicit sex-specific signaling. We used specific agonists and antagonists of these receptors to examine the relative contributions of ERs and ARs in membrane-mediated E2 signaling in female chondrocytes and DHT signaling in male chondrocytes. PKC activity in female chondrocytes was stimulated by agonists of ERα and ERβ and required intact caveolae; PKC activity was inhibited by the E2 enantiomer and by an inhibitor of ERβ. Western blots of cell lysates co-immunoprecipitated for ERα suggested the formation of a complex containing both ERα and ERß with E2 treatment. DHT and DHT agonists activated PKC in male cells, while AR inhibition blocked the stimulatory effect of DHT on PKC. Inhibition of ERα and ERβ also blocked PKC activation by DHT. Western blots of whole-cell lysates, plasma membranes, and caveolae indicated the translocation of AR to the plasma membrane and specifically to caveolae with DHT treatment. These results suggest that E2 and DHT promote chondrocyte differentiation via the ability of ARs and ERs to form a complex. The results also indicate that intact caveolae and palmitoylation of the membrane receptor(s) or membrane receptor complex containing ERα and ERβ is required for E2 and DHT membrane-associated PKC activity in costochondral cartilage cells.

Abstract: The molybdenum cofactor (Moco) represents an ancient metal‑sulfur cofactor, which participates as catalyst in carbon, nitrogen and sulfur cycles, both on individual and global scale. Given the diversity of biological processes dependent on Moco and their evolutionary age, Moco is traced back to the last universal common ancestor (LUCA), while Moco biosynthetic genes underwent significant changes through evolution and acquired additional functions. In this review, focused on eukaryotic Moco biology, we elucidate the benefits of gene fusions on Moco biosynthesis and beyond. While originally the gene fusions were driven by biosynthetic advantages such as coordinated expression of functionally related proteins and product/substrate channeling, they also served as origin for the development of novel functions. Today, Moco biosynthetic genes are involved in a multitude of cellular processes and loss of the according gene products result in severe disorders, both related to Moco biosynthesis and secondary enzyme functions.

Abstract: Alcohol constricts cerebral arteries via inhibition of voltage/calcium-gated, large conductance potassium (BK) channels in vascular myocytes. Using a rat model of high-cholesterol (high-CLR) diet and CLR enrichment of cerebral arteries in vitro, we recently showed that CLR protected against alcohol-induced constriction of cerebral arteries. The subcellular mechanism(s) underlying CLR protection against alcohol-induced constriction of the artery is unclear. Here we use a rat model of high-CLR diet and patch-clamp recording of BK channels in inside-out patches from cerebral artery myocytes to demonstrate that this diet antagonizes inhibition of BK currents by 50 mM ethanol. High-CLR-driven protection against alcohol inhibition of BK currents is reversed following CLR depletion in vitro. Similar to CLR accumulation in vivo, pre-incubation of arterial myocytes from normocholesterolemic rats in CLR-enriching media in vitro protects against alcohol-induced inhibition of BK current. However, application of CLR-enriching media to cell-free membrane patches does not protect against the alcohol effect. These different outcomes point to the involvement of cell signaling in CLR-alcohol interaction on BK channels. Incubation of myocytes with the PKC activators phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol, but not with the PKC inhibitor Gouml 6983, prior to patch excision precludes CLR enrichment from antagonizing alcohol action. Thus, PKC activation either disables the CLR target(s) or competes with elevated CLR. Favoring the latter possibility, 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol protects against alcohol-induced inhibition of BK currents in patches from myocytes with naïve CLR. Our findings document that CLR antagonism of alcohol-induced BK channel inhibition requires cell integrity and is enabled by a PKC-dependent mechanism(s).

Abstract: During analysis of components of baobab (Adansonia digitata) seed oil, several new fluorescent compounds were detected in HPLC chromatograms that were not found previously in any seed oils investigated so far. After preparative isolation of these compounds, structural analysis by NMR spectroscopy, UHPLC-HR-MS, GC-FID and spectroscopic methods were applied and allowed identification of these substances as series of N-acylserotonins containing saturated C22 to C26 fatty acids with minor contribution of C27 to C30 homologues. The main component was N-lignocerylserotonin and the content of odd carbon-atom-number fatty acids was unusually high among the homologues. The suggested structure of the investigated compounds was additionally confirmed by their chemical synthesis. Synthetic N-acylserotonins showed pronounced inhibition of membrane lipid peroxidation of liposomes prepared from chloroplast lipids, especially when the peroxidation was initiated by a water-soluble azo-initiator, AIPH. Comparative studies of the reaction rate constants of the N-acylserotonins and tocopherols with a stable radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) in solvents of different polarity revealed that N-acylserotonins showed similar activity to δ-tocopherol in this respect. The described compounds have been not reported before either in plants or in animals. This indicates that we have identified a new class of plant lipids with antioxidant properties that could have promising pharmacological activities.

Abstract: Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is specialized for uncoupled heat production through mitochondrion fueled majorly from fatty acids (FAs) of lipid droplets (LDs). How the interaction between the two organelles contributes the generation of heat remains elusive. Here, we report that LD-anchored mitochondria (LDAM) were observed in the BAT of mice raised at three different temperatures, 30 °C, 23 °C, and 6 °C. The biochemical analyses including Western blotting of electron transport chain subunits showed that LDAM were functional. Comparative proteomics analysis was conducted, which revealed differential expressions of proteins between LDAM and cytoplasmic mitochondria (CM) at different temperatures. Higher expressions of proteins at low temperature were observed for i) FA β-oxidation in LDAM including FA synthesis and uncoupling, ii) pseudo-futile cycle in CM, and iii) two shuttle systems: glycerol 3-phosphate in both CM and LDAM and citrate malate in CM. Together, these results suggest that LDs and LDAM form a preorganized and functional organelle complex that permits the rapid response to cold.

Abstract: The polar-lipid composition of the placenta reflects its cellular heterogeneity and metabolism. This study explored relationships between placental polar-lipid composition, gene expression and neonatal body composition. Placental tissue and maternal and offspring data were collected in the Southampton Women's Survey. Lipid and RNA were extracted from placental tissue and polar lipids measured by mass spectrometry, while gene expression was assessed using the nCounter analysis platform. Principal component analysis was used to identify patterns within placental lipid composition and these were correlated with neonatal body composition and placental gene expression. In the analysis of placental lipids, the first three principal components explained 19.1%, 12.7% and 8.0% of variation in placental lipid composition, respectively. Principal component 2 was characterised by high principal component scores for acyl-alkyl-glycerophosphatidylcholines and lipid species containing DHA. Principal component 2 was associated with placental weight and neonatal lean mass; this component was associated with gene expression of APOE, PLIN2, FATP2, FABP4, LEP, G0S2, PNPLA2 and SRB1. Principal components 1 and 3 were not related to birth outcomes but they were associated with the gene expression of lipid related genes. Principal component 1 was associated with expression of LEP, APOE, FATP2 and ACAT2. Principal component 3 was associated with expression of PLIN2, PLIN3 and PNPLA2. This study demonstrates that placentas of different sizes have specific differences in polar-lipid composition and related gene expression. These differences in lipid composition were associated with birth weight and neonatal lean mass, suggesting that placental lipid composition may influence prenatal lean mass accretion.

Abstract: How cells maintain vital membrane lipid homeostasis while obtaining most of their constituent fatty acids from a varied diet remains largely unknown. Here, we used transcriptomics, lipidomics, growth and respiration assays, and membrane property analyses in human HEK293 cells or human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) to show that the function of AdipoR2 is to respond to membrane rigidification by regulating many lipid metabolism genes. We also show that AdipoR2-dependent membrane homeostasis is critical for growth and respiration in cells challenged with saturated fatty acids. Additionally, we found that AdipoR2 deficiency causes transcriptome and cell physiological defects similar to those observed in SREBP-deficient cells upon SFA challenge. Finally, we compared several genes considered important for lipid homeostasis, namely AdipoR2, SCD, FADS2, PEMT and ACSL4, and found that AdipoR2 and SCD are the most important among these to prevent membrane rigidification and excess saturation when human cells are challenged with exogenous SFAs. We conclude that AdipoR2-dependent membrane homeostasis is one of the primary mechanisms that protects against exogenous SFAs.

Abstract: We previously demonstrated that astaxanthin (ASTX), a xanthophyll carotenoid, repressed ethanol-induced inflammation and oxidative stress in macrophages. We explored the role of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) in the inhibitory effect of ASTX on inflammation and oxidative stress in macrophages exposed to ethanol. Ethanol decreased mRNA and protein of SIRT1 while increasing those of HDAC4, which was attenuated by ASTX in RAW 264.7 macrophages and mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Inhibition of SIRT1 expression or activity augmented ethanol-induced Hdac4 expression, but SIRT1 activation elicited the opposite effect. Consistently, Hdac4 knockdown increased Sirt1 expression with decreases in ethanol-induced inflammatory gene expression, but its overexpression resulted in the opposite effects. Furthermore, BMDMs from mice with macrophage specific-deletion of Hdac4 (Hdac4MKO) showed significant decreases in ethanol-induced inflammatory genes and ROS accumulation but an increase in Sirt1 expression. Macrophage specific deletion of Hdac4 or ASTX abolished the changes in genes for mitochondrial biogenesis and glycolysis by ethanol. Ethanol increased mitochondrial respiration, ATP production, and proton leak, but decreased maximal respiration and spare respiratory capacity, all of which were abolished by ASTX in RAW 264.7 macrophages. The ethanol-induced alterations in mitochondrial respiration were abrogated in Hdac4MKO BMDMs. In conclusion, the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of ASTX in ethanol-treated macrophages may be mediated, at least partly, by its opposite effect on SIRT1 and HDAC4 to empower SIRT1 to counteract ethanol-induced activation of HDAC4.

Abstract: NIR, a novel INHAT, negatively regulates the transcription activity of tumor repressor p53. However, if NIR functions in the tumorigenesis dependent on the regulation of p53 remains unknown. Here, we report that NIR promotes progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) through regulating RB function. Firstly, we found that NIR expression is upregulated in the human CRC tissues and significantly associated with the poor outcome of the patients. Sequence alignment shows that NIR contains an RB-binding motif LxCxE in its INHAT-2 domain. We demonstrate that NIR interacts with RB via INHAT-2 in CRC cells and promotes RB degradation through proteasome-mediated pathway. Further, either full-length GFP-NIR or GFP-NIR-INHAT2 facilitates poly-ubiquitination of RB. In addition, NIR inhibits RB acetylation by INHAT-2, suggesting NIR might promote RB degradation through inhibiting RB acetylation. Importantly, endogenous NIR is downregulated upon DNA damage, which is consistent with the upregulation of total level and acetylation of RB. We further show that Flag-NIR inhibits DNA damage-induced RB acetylation. Thus, downregulation of NIR might contribute to maintain the cellular homeostasis under DNA damage. Consequently, depletion of NIR inhibits cell proliferation and tumor growth in mouse xenografts. Taken together, we demonstrate that NIR promotes CRC progression partially through inhibiting RB acetylation and promoting RB degradation. Targeting NIR may provide a potential therapeutic strategy for NIR-upregulated CRC patients.

Abstract: Low complexity regions are involved in the assembly and disassembly of P-bodies (PBs). Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains three genes encoding the protein kinase A (PKA) catalytic subunit: TPK1, TPK2 and TPK3. Tpk2 and Tpk3 isoforms localize to PBs upon glucose starvation showing different mechanisms and kinetics of accumulation. In contrast to the other two isoforms, Tpk2 harbors a glutamine-rich prion-like domain (PrLD) at the N-terminus. Here we show that the appearance of Tpk2 foci in response to glucose starvation, heat stress or stationary phase was dependent on its PrLD. Moreover, the PrLD of Tpk2 was necessary for efficient PB and stress granule aggregation during stress conditions and in quiescent cells. Deletion of PrLD does not affect the in vitro and in vivo kinase activity of Tpk2 or its interaction with the regulatory subunit Bcy1. We present evidence that the PrLD of Tpk2 serves as a scaffold domain for PB assembly in a manner that is independent of Pat1 phosphorylation by PKA. In addition, a mutant strain where Tpk2 lacks PrLD showed a decrease of turnover of mRNA during glucose starvation. This work therefore provides new insight into the mechanism of stress-induced cytoplasmic mRNP assembly, and the role of isoform specific domains in the regulation of PKA catalytic subunit specificity and dynamic localization to cytoplasmic RNPs granules.

Abstract: Neutral lipases-mediated lipolysis and acid lipases-moderated lipophagy are two main processes for degradation of lipid droplets (LDs). However, the individual and interactive roles of these metabolic pathways are not well known across vertebrates. This study explored the roles of lipolysis and lipophagy from the aspect of neutral and acid lipases in zebrafish. We established zebrafish strains deficient in either adipose triglyceride lipase (atgl−/−; AKO fish) or lysosomal acid lipase (lal−/−; LKO fish) respectively, and then inhibited lipolysis in the LKO fish and lipophagy in the AKO fish by feeding diets supplemented with the corresponding inhibitors Atglistatin and 3-Methyladenine, respectively. Both the AKO and LKO fish showed reduced growth, swimming activity, and oxygen consumption. The AKO fish did not show phenotypes in adipose tissue, but mainly accumulated triacylglycerol (TAG) in liver, also, they had large LDs in the hepatocytes, and did not stimulate lipophagy as a compensation response but maintained basal lipophagy. The LKO fish reduced total lipid accumulation in the body but had high cholesterol content in liver; also, they accumulated small LDs in the hepatocytes, and showed increased lipolysis, especially Atgl expression, as a compensatory mechanism. Simultaneous inhibition of lipolysis and lipophagy in zebrafish resulted in severe liver damage, with the potential to trigger mitophagy. Overall, our study illustrates that lipolysis and lipophagy perform individual and interactive roles in maintaining homeostasis of TAG and cholesterol metabolism. Furthermore, the interactive roles of lipolysis and lipophagy may be essential in regulating the functions and form of mitochondria.

Abstract: Full thickness models (FTM) are 3D in vitro skin cultures that resemble the native human skin (NHS) to a great extent. However, the barrier function of these skin models is reduced. The skin barrier is located in the stratum corneum (SC) and consists of corneocytes embedded in a lipid matrix. In this matrix, deviations in the composition of the FTMs lipid matrix may contribute to the impaired skin barrier when compared to NHS. One of the most abundant changes in lipid composition is an increase in monounsaturated lipids for which stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1) is responsible. To improve the SC lipid composition, we reduced SCD-1 activity during the generation of the FTMs. These FTMs were subsequently assessed on all major aspects, including epidermal homeostasis, lipid composition, lipid organization, and barrier functionality. We demonstrate that SCD-1 inhibition was successful and resulted in FTMs that better mimic the lipid composition of FTMs to NHS by a significant reduction in monounsaturated lipids. In conclusion, this study demonstrates an effective approach to normalize SC monounsaturated lipid concentration and may be a valuable tool in further optimizing the FTMs in future studies.

Abstract: Scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1) is a membrane lipoprotein receptor/lipid transporter involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, but its role in obesity and fatty liver development is unclear. Here, we determined the effects of SR-B1 deficiency on plasma metabolic and inflammatory parameters as well as fat deposition in adipose tissue and liver during obesity. To induce obesity, we performed high-fat diet (HFD) exposure for 12 weeks in male SR-B1 knock-out (SR-B1−/−, n = 14) and wild-type (WT, n = 12) mice. Compared to HFD-fed WT mice, plasma from HFD-fed SR-B1−/− animals exhibited increased total cholesterol, triglycerides (TG) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels. In addition, hypertrophied adipocytes and macrophage-containing crown-like structures (CLS) were observed in adipose tissue from HFD-fed SR-B1 deficient mice. Remarkably, liver from obese SR-B1−/− mice showed attenuated TG content, dysregulation in hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) expression, increased hepatic TG secretion, and altered hepatic fatty acid (FA) composition. In conclusion, we show that SR-B1 deficiency alters the metabolic environment of obese mice through modulation of liver and adipose tissue lipid accumulation. Our findings provide the basis for further elucidation of SR-B1's role in obesity and fatty liver, two major public health issues that increase the risk of advanced chronic diseases and overall mortality.

Abstract: Lysosomal acid lipase (LAL)-dependent lipolysis degrades cholesteryl ester (CE) and triglyceride in the lysosome. LAL deficiency in human and mice leads to hypercholesterolemia, hepatic CE deposition, and atherosclerosis. Despite its hepatocyte-specific deficiency leads to CE accumulation, the regulation of LAL in cholesterol metabolic disease remains elusive. For the in vitro study, the target gene Lipa was transfected with recombinant shRNA or lentiviral vector in Hepa1-6 cells. It was found that LAL silencing in cells affected lysosomal function by reducing LAL activity and proteolytic activity, and altered the expression of genes related to cholesterol metabolism and autophagy, leading to cholesterol accumulation; whereas LAL overexpression improved the above effects. To explore the impacts of hepatic LAL on cholesterol metabolic disease in vivo, apolipoprotein E deficient (ApoE−/−) mice were intravenously injected with lentivirus to achieve hepatic LAL overexpression and fed a Western diet for 16 weeks. The results showed that hepatic LAL overexpression significantly reduced plasma lipid levels, alleviated inflammation and oxidative status in plasma and liver, and attenuated hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in ApoE−/− mice. Mechanically, hepatic LAL promoted cholesterol transport and biliary excretion by increasing liver X receptor alpha (LXRα) and its downstream genes, and modulated the compliance of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway. Our data provide the original evidence of the validity of hepatic LAL in controlling cholesterol metabolism and liver homeostasis, suggesting that targeting hepatic LAL may provide a promising approach to rescue cholesterol metabolic disorders, such as hypercholesterolemia and liver disease.

Abstract: Background
Several studies revealed alterations of single sphingolipid species, such as chain length-specific ceramides, in plasma and serum of patients with kidney diseases. Here, we investigated whether such alterations occur in kidney tissue from patients and mice suffering from renal fibrosis, the common endpoint of chronic kidney diseases.
Methods
Human fibrotic kidney samples were collected from nephrectomy specimens with hydronephrosis and/or pyelonephritis. Healthy parts from tumor nephrectomies served as nonfibrotic controls. Mouse fibrotic kidney samples were collected from male C57BL/6J mice treated with an adenine-rich diet for 14 days or were subjected to 7 days of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). Kidneys of untreated mice and contralateral kidneys (UUO) served as respective controls. Sphingolipid levels were detected by LC-MS/MS. Fibrotic markers were analyzed by TaqMan® analysis and immunohistology.
Results
Very long-chain ceramides Cer d18:1/24:0 and Cer d18:1/24:1 were significantly downregulated in both fibrotic human kidney cortex and fibrotic murine kidney compared to respective control samples. These effects correlate with upregulation of COL1α1, COL3α1 and αSMA expression in fibrotic human kidney cortex and fibrotic mouse kidney.
Conclusion
We have shown that very long-chain ceramides Cer d18:1/24:0 and Cer d18:1/24:1 are consistently downregulated in fibrotic kidney samples from human and mouse. Our findings support the use of in vivo murine models as appropriate translational means to understand the involvement of ceramides in human kidney diseases. In addition, our study raises interesting questions about the possible manipulation of ceramide metabolism to prevent progression of fibrosis and the use of ceramides as potential biomarkers of chronic kidney disease.

Abstract: Plin5 is abundantly expressed in the heart where it binds to lipid droplets (LDs) and facilitates physical interaction between LDs and mitochondria. We isolated cardiomyocytes from adult Plin5+/+ and Plin5−/− mice to study the role of Plin5 for fatty acid uptake, LD accumulation, fatty acid oxidation, and tolerance to hypoxia. Cardiomyocytes isolated from Plin5−/− mice cultured with oleic acid stored less LDs than Plin5+/+, but comparable levels to Plin5+/+ cardiomyocytes when adipose triglyceride lipase activity was inhibited. The ability to oxidize fatty acids into CO2 was similar between Plin5+/+ and Plin5−/− cardiomyocytes, but Plin5−/− cardiomyocytes had a transient increase in intracellular fatty acid oxidation intermediates. After pre-incubation with oleic acids, Plin5−/− cardiomyocytes retained a higher content of glycogen and showed improved tolerance to hypoxia compared to Plin5+/+. In isolated, perfused hearts, deletion of Plin5 had no important effect on ventricular pressures or infarct size after ischemia. Old Plin5−/− mice had reduced levels of cardiac triacylglycerides, increased heart weight, and apart from modest elevated expression of mRNAs for beta myosin heavy chain Myh7 and the fatty acid transporter Cd36, other genes involved in fatty acid oxidation, glycogen metabolism and glucose utilization were essentially unchanged by removal of Plin5. Plin5 seems to facilitate cardiac LD storage primarily by repressing adipose triglyceride lipase activity without altering cardiac fatty acid oxidation capacity. Expression of Plin5 and cardiac LD content of isolated cardiomyocytes has little importance for tolerance to acute hypoxia and ischemia, which contrasts the protective role for Plin5 in mouse models during myocardial ischemia.

Abstract: Psoriasis is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease linked to increased cardiovascular risk. Functional impairment of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) may contribute to excessive cardiovascular mortality in psoriasis patients. Anti-cytokine therapies with biologics have been efficiently used for the management of psoriasis, however little data is available on the effects of biologic anti-psoriatic therapies on the composition and functionality of HDL. Blood samples were taken from 17 healthy volunteers and from 27 real-world psoriasis patients at baseline (no therapy with biologics) and after short-term (3 to 6 months) and intermediate-term (1 to 2 years) therapy. The biologics used included anti-interleukin (IL)-12/23p40 (ustekinumab), anti-IL17A (secukinumab) or anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (etanercept or adalimumab) antibodies. We observed that in psoriasis patients at baseline, metrics of HDL function including cholesterol efflux capacity of apolipoprotein B-depleted serum (p = 0.021), paraoxonase (p < 0.001) and lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (p < 0.001) activities were impaired, when compared to controls. Unexpectedly, we observed that short- and especially intermediate-term therapy with biologics markedly reduced HDL cholesterol efflux capacity (p < 0.001) and rendered HDL pro-inflammatory (p < 0.001), but increased paraoxonase (p = 0.009) and lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (p = 0.019) activities. All biologics caused similar changes in HDL composition, subclass distribution and cholesterol efflux capacity. Our results provide evidence that anti-psoriatic therapy with biologic agents is associated with changes in HDL functionality, particle composition and subclass distribution.

Abstract: Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) hydrolyse acylglycerols, cholesteryl and retinyl esters. HSL is a key lipase in mice testis, as HSL deficiency results in male sterility. The present work study the effects of the deficiency and lack of HSL on the localization and expression of SR-BI, LDLr, and ABCA1 receptors/transporters involved in uptake and efflux of cholesterol in mice testis, to determine the impact of HSL gene dosage on testis morphology, lipid homeostasis and fertility. The results of this work show that the lack of HSL in mice alters testis morphology and spermatogenesis, decreasing sperm counts, sperm motility and increasing the amount of Leydig cells and lipid droplets. They also show that there are differences in the localization of HSL, SR-BI, LDLr and ABCA1 in HSL+/+, HSL+/− and HSL−/− mice. The deficiency or lack of HSL has effects on protein and mRNA expression of genes involved in lipid metabolisms in mouse testis. HSL−/− testis have augmented expression of SR-BI, LDLr, ABCA1 and LXRβ, a critical sterol sensor that regulate multiple genes involved in lipid metabolism; whereas LDLr expression decreased in HSL+/− mice. Plin2, Abca1 and Ldlr mRNA levels increased; and LXRα (Nr1h3) and LXRβ (Nr1h2) decreased in testis from HSL−/− compared with HSL+/+; with no differences in Scarb1. Together these data suggest that HSL deficiency or lack in mice testis induces lipid homeostasis alterations that affect the cellular localization and expression of key receptors/transporter involved in cellular cholesterol uptake and efflux (SR-BI, LDRr, ABCA1); alters normal cellular function and impact fertility.

Abstract: Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is an aggressive malignancy of gastrointestinal tract. Due to uncontrolled growth, GBC cells rapidly synthesize biomolecules including lipids. The lipids are integral component of cell membrane with a wide range of cellular functions. In this study, we measured the clinicopathological features in 40 cases of histologically confirmed GBC and 16 cases of chronic cholecystitis (CC). The female to male ratio in the GBC and CC groups were 3.44:1 and 2.2:1, respectively. The GBC patients exhibited well to poorly differentiated tumor. In the CC group, all patients showed cholecystitis with no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy. The majority of GBC and CC patients reported pain. Using 1H NMR spectroscopy, we observed 4-folds increase in the level of choline containing phospholipids (CCPLs) in the gallbladder of GBC patients as compared to CC patients. Other lipid metabolites such as cholesterol ester, C18-cholesterol and saturated fatty acids were insignificantly changed between GBC and CC patients. Moreover, the level of CCPLs in the GBC patients with BMI <25 kg/m2 was significantly higher as compared to CC patients. Further, a significant increase in the CCPLs level was observed in GBC female patients in comparison to CC patients. From the computational analyses, we observed that the genes involved in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) indirectly interact with the RELA, which encodes the NF-κB p65 subunit. The genes involved in the PtdCho biosynthesis were also correlated with the overall and disease-free survival of cholangiocarcinoma patients. The study opens new window for exploring the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of CCPLs in GBC patients.

Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the fastest-growing causes of cancer-related mortalities worldwide and this trend is mimicked by the surge of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Altered hepatic lipid metabolism promotes HCC development through inflammation and activation of oncogenes. GDF11 is a member of the TGF-β superfamily and recent data have implicated GDF11 as an anti-aging factor that can alleviate high-fat diet induced obesity, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and NAFLD. However, its role in hepatic lipid metabolism is still not fully delineated. The aim of the present study was to characterize the role of GDF11 in hepatic and HCC cells lipid accumulation. To achieve this, we performed imaging, biochemical, lipidomic, and transcriptomic analyses in primary hepatocytes and in HCC cells treated with GDF11 to study the GDF11-activated signaling pathways. GDF11 treatment rapidly triggered ALK5-dependent SMAD2/3 nuclear translocation and elevated lipid droplets in HCC cells, but not in primary hepatocytes. In HCC cells, ALK5 inhibition hampered GDF11-mediated SMAD2/3 signaling and attenuated lipid accumulation. Using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, we detected increased accumulation of longer acyl-chain di/tri-acylglycerols and glycerophospholipids. Unbiased transcriptomic analysis identified TGF-β and PI3K-AKT signaling among the top pathways/cellular processes activated in GDF11 treated HCC cells. In summary, GDF11 supplementation promotes pro-lipogenic gene expression and lipid accumulation in HCC cells. Integration of our “omics” data pointed to a GDF11-induced upregulation of de novo lipogenesis through activation of ALK5/SMAD2/3/PI3K-AKT pathways. Thus, GDF11 could contribute to metabolic reprogramming and dysregulation of lipid metabolism in HCC cells, without effects on healthy hepatocytes.

Abstract: DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) is an essential fatty acid that is required for the normal development and function of the brain. Because of its inability to synthesize adequate amounts of DHA from the precursors, the brain has to acquire DHA from plasma through the blood brain barrier (BBB). Recent studies demonstrated the presence of a transporter at the BBB that specifically transports DHA into the brain in the form of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC-DHA). However, the mechanism by which LPC-DHA is generated in the plasma is not known. Our previous studies showed that there are at least three different enzymes - lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), endothelial lipase (EL), and hepatic lipase (HL), which can generate LPC-DHA from sn-2 DHA phosphatidylcholine. Here we determined the relative contributions of these enzymes in the delivery of DHA to the brain by measuring the brain DHA levels in the mice deficient in each of these enzymes. The results show that the brain DHA levels of LCAT-deficient mice or EL-deficient mice were not significantly lower than those of their littermates. However, brain DHA was significantly decreased in HL deficient mice (13.5% of total fatty acids) compared to their littermates (17.1%) (p < 0.002), and further decreased to 8.3% of total fatty acids in mice deficient in both HL and EL. These results suggest that HL activity may be the major source for the generation of LPC-DHA in the plasma necessary for transport into the brain, and EL might contribute to this process in the absence of HL.

Abstract: Lithium is regarded as a unique therapeutic agent for the management of bipolar disorder (BD). In efforts to explain the favourable effects of lithium in BD, a wide range of mechanisms was suggested. Among those, the effect of clinically relevant concentrations of lithium on the plasma membrane was extensively studied. However, the biophysical properties of brain membranes isolated from experimental animals exposed to acute, short-term and chronic lithium have not been performed to-date. In this study, we compared the biophysical parameters and level of lipid peroxidation in membranes isolated from forebrain cortex (FBC) of therapeutic lithium-treated and/or sleep-deprived rats. Lithium interaction with FBC membranes was characterized by appropriate fluorescent probes. DPH (1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene) and TMA-DPH (1-(4-trimethylammoniumphenyl)-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene p-toluenesulphonate) were used for characterization of the hydrophobic lipid core and Laurdan (6-dodecanoyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene) for the membrane-water interface. Lipid peroxidation was determined by immunoblot analysis of 4-HNE-(4-hydroxynonenal)-protein adducts. The organization of polar head-group region of FBC membranes, measured by Laurdan generalized polarization, was substantially altered by sleep deprivation and augmented by lithium treatment. Hydrophobic membrane interior characterized by steady-state anisotropy of DPH and TMA-DPH fluorescence was unchanged. Chronic lithium had a protective effect against peroxidative damage of membrane lipids in FBC. In summary, lithium administration at a therapeutic level and/or sleep deprivation as an animal model of mania resulted in changes in rat FBC membrane properties.

Abstract: Fatty acid metabolism and oxidation capacity in the placenta, which likely affects the rate and composition of lipid delivered to the fetus remains poorly understood. Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are critical for fetal growth and brain development. We determined the impact of maternal obesity on placental fatty acid oxidation, esterification and transport capacity by measuring PhosphatidylCholine (PC) and LysoPhosphatidylCholine (LPC) containing DHA by mass spectrometry in mother-placenta-baby triads as well as placental free carnitine and acylcarnitine metabolites in women with normal and obese pre-pregnancy BMI. Placental protein expression of enzymes involved in beta-oxidation and esterification pathways, MFSD2a (lysophosphatidylcholine transporter) and OCTN2 (carnitine transporter) expression in syncytiotrophoblast microvillous (MVM) and basal (BM) membranes were determined by Western Blot. Maternal obesity was associated with decreased umbilical cord plasma DHA in LPC and PC fractions in male, but not female, fetuses. Basal membrane MFSD2a protein expression was increased in placenta of males of obese mothers. In female placentas, despite an increased MVM OCTN2 expression, maternal obesity was associated with a reduced MUFA-carnitine levels and increased esterification enzymes. We speculate that lower DHA-PL in fetal circulation of male offspring of obese mothers, despite a significant increase in transporter expression for LPC-DHA, may lead to low DHA needed for brain development contributing to neurological consequences that are more prevalent in male children. Female placentas likely have reduced beta-oxidation capacity and appear to store FA through greater placental esterification, suggesting impaired placenta function and lipid transfer in female placentas of obese mothers.

Abstract: Background
Cholesterol crystallization within an atherosclerotic plaque significantly contributes to the acceleration of plaque rupture – a problematic event due to the current lack of specific treatments to prevent such formations. Modelling this pathogenic process is also difficult due to the lack of suitable experimental models that enable quantitative analysis of crystal formation and bioactivity screening of potential therapeutic compounds.
Aim
To develop an in vitro human cell model of cholesterol crystallization combined with an imaging system that incorporates both quantitative analysis and real-time continuous imaging of cholesterol crystal formation.
Methods and results
An enhanced in vitro model of cholesterol crystallization was developed through the use of acetylated low-density lipoprotein (AcLDL) and 7-ketocholesterol as agents of foam cell induction within a human THP-1 monocytic cell line. Advanced confocal and polarizing microscopies were incorporated into the model so as to allow for quantitation of cholesterol crystallization, with the lipid-loaded group producing significantly greater numbers of cholesterol crystals than the untreated group. The utility of this system was also demonstrated by investigating the effects of the cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin and therapeutic bile compound ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), showing that these drugs influence different aspects of cholesterol crystal formation.
Conclusions
The in vitro human THP-1 monocyte model of cholesterol crystallization provides an effective and efficient means of quantitating cholesterol crystallization in the pre-clinical stage of research. The model also allows for the screening of potentially therapeutic compounds that may be used in attenuating or preventing cholesterol crystallization.

Abstract: Dysfunctions of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) play crucial roles in vascular remodeling in hypertension, which correlates with pathologically elevated cyclic stretch due to increased arterial pressure. Recent researches reported that autophagy, a life-sustaining process, was increased in hypertension. However, the mechanobiological mechanism of VSMC autophagy and its potential roles in vascular remodeling are still unclear. Using renal hypertensive rats in vivo and FX5000 stretch application Unit in vitro, the autophagy of VSMCs was detected. The results showed that LC3II remarkably enhanced in hypertensive rats and 15% cyclic stretch (mimic the pathologically increased mechanical stretch in hypertension), and the activity of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) was suppressed in 15% cyclic stretch. Administration of autophagy inhibitors, bafilomycin A1 and chloroquine, repressed VSMC proliferation efficiently, but did not affect the degradation of two important nuclear envelope (NE) proteins, lamin A/C and emerin. Using RNA interference to decline the expression of lamin A/C and emerin, respectively, we discovered that autophagy was upregulated under both static and 5% cyclic stretch conditions, accompanying with the decreased mTOR activity. During 15% cyclic stretch application, mTOR inhibition was responsible for autophagy elevation. Chloroquine administration in vivo inhibited the expression of PCNA (marker of proliferation) of abdominal aorta in hypertensive rats. Altogether, these results demonstrated that pathological cyclic stretch suppresses the expression of lamin A/C and emerin which subsequently represses mTOR pathway so as to induce autophagy activation. Blocking autophagic flux may be a practicable way to relieve the pathological vascular remodeling in hypertensive.

Abstract: The arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase (ALOX12) enzyme catalyzes polyunsaturated fatty acids and facilitates generation of bioactive lipid mediators associated with various biological processes and disease pathologies. The human genome assembly revealed that the ALOX12 gene overlaps an antisense non-coding gene designated as ALOX12-antisense 1 (ALOX12-AS1). This arrangement indicates that the uncharacterized ALOX12-AS1 long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) may bind to the sense coding ALOX12 mRNA to form an antisense-sense duplex providing the basis of a novel ALOX12 regulatory mechanism. Therefore, this study was designed to determine whether the interaction of ALOX12-AS1 with ALOX12 mRNA functions as an anti-sense/sense duplex-mediated regulatory mechanism controlling the cellular content of ALOX12. Our findings indicate that two major isoforms of ALOX12-AS1 lncRNA are ubiquitously expressed in a variety of primary adult human tissues and different transformed cell types. RNA-FISH revealed cell-type-specific cytosolic as well as nuclear and nucleolar localization of the lncRNA. Interestingly, phorbol ester-induced nucleo-cytoplasmic translocation of the lncRNA in monocytic THP-1 cells resulted in a reduction of ALOX12 protein without a concomitant change in its mRNA level. This indicated ALOX12-AS1 operates via an antisense-sense duplex-mediated translational downregulation mechanism. This deduction was validated by demonstrating sense/antisense duplex formation and an association of the duplex with ribosomal proteins in HEK293 cells. Overall, this study revealed a hitherto unknown mechanism of antisense lncRNA-mediated translational downregulation of ALOX12 that adds to the existing regulatory mechanisms for the modulation of potent bioactive lipid mediators that contribute to both health and disease.

Abstract: Docosahexaenoyl ethanolamide (DHEA), the ethanolamine conjugate of the n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid, is endogenously present in the human circulation and in tissues. Its immunomodulating properties have been (partly) attributed to an interaction with the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme. Recently, we discovered that COX-2 converts DHEA into two oxygenated metabolites, 13- and 16-hydroxylated-DHEA (13- and 16-HDHEA, respectively). It remained unclear whether these oxygenated metabolites also display immunomodulating properties like their parent DHEA. In the current study we investigated the immunomodulating properties of 13- and 16-HDHEA in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. The compounds reduced production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-1Ra, but did not affect nitric oxide (NO) and IL-6 release. Transcriptome analysis showed that the compounds inhibited the LPS-mediated induction of pro-inflammatory genes (InhbA, Ifit1) and suggested potential inhibition of regulators such as toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), MyD88, and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), whereas anti-inflammatory genes (SerpinB2) and potential regulators IL-10, sirtuin 1 (Sirt-1), fluticasone propionate were induced. Additionally, transcriptome analysis of 13-HDHEA suggests a potential anti-angiogenic role. In contrast to the known oxylipin-lowering effects of DHEA, liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analyses revealed that 13- and 16-HDHEA did not affect oxylipin formation. Overall, the anti-inflammatory effects of 13-HDHEA and 16-HDHEA are less pronounced compared to their parent molecule DHEA. Therefore, we propose that COX-2 metabolism of DHEA acts as a regulatory mechanism to limit the anti-inflammatory properties of DHEA.

Abstract: Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complex comprises an extended family of intracellular protein serine/threonine phosphatases, that participate in different signaling transduction pathways. Different functions of PP2As are determined by the variety of regulatory subunits. In this study, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated loss-of-function screen revealed that PPP2R2A downregulation suppressed cell growth in NSCLC cells. AMOTL2 was identified and confirmed as a novel binding partner of PPP2R2A in NSCLC cells by mass spectrometry, CO-IP, GST pull-down and immunofluorescence. Upregulation of AMOTL2 also led to cell proliferation delay in human and mouse lung tumor cells. The proto-oncogene JUN is a key subunit of activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor which plays crucial role in regulating tumorigenesis and its activity is negatively regulated by the phosphorylation at T239. Our results showed that either AMOTL2 upregulation or PPP2R2A downregulation led to great increase in JUN T239 phosphorylation. AMOTL2 bound PPP2R2A in cytoplasm, which reduced nuclear localization of PPP2R2A. In conclusion, AMOTL2 and PPP2R2A act respectively as negative and positive regulator of cell growth in NSCLC cells and function in the AMOTL2-PPP2R2A-JUN axis, in which AMOTL2 inhibits the entry of PPP2R2A into the nucleus to dephosphorylate JUN at T239.

Abstract: How cells maintain vital membrane lipid homeostasis while obtaining most of their constituent fatty acids from a varied diet remains largely unknown. Here, we report the first whole-organism (Caenorhabditis elegans) forward genetic screen to identify genes essential for tolerance to dietary saturated fatty acids (SFAs). We found that only the PAQR-2/IGLR-2 pathway, homologous to the human adiponectin receptor 2 (AdipoR2) pathway, is uniquely essential to prevent SFA-mediated toxicity. When provided a SFA-rich diet, worms lacking either protein accumulate an excess of SFAs in their membrane phospholipids, which is accompanied by membrane rigidification. Additionally, we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to show that the interaction between PAQR-2 and IGLR-2 is regulated by membrane fluidity, suggesting a mechanism by which this protein complex senses membrane properties. We also created versions of PAQR-2 that lacked parts of the cytoplasmic N-terminal domain and showed that these were still functional, though still dependent on the interaction with IGLR-2. We conclude that membrane homeostasis via the PAQR-2/IGLR-2 fluidity sensor is the only pathway specifically essential for the non-toxic uptake of dietary SFAs in C. elegans.

Abstract: Podocytopathy and associated nephrotic syndrome (NS) have been reported in a knockout mouse strain (Asah1fl/fl/PodoCre) with a podocyte-specific deletion of α subunit (the main catalytic subunit) of acid ceramidase (Ac). However, the pathogenesis of podocytopathy of these mice remains unknown. The present study tested whether exosome release from podocytes is enhanced due to Asah1 gene knockout, which may serve as a pathogenic mechanism switching on podocytopathy and associated NS in Asah1fl/fl/PodoCre mice. We first demonstrated the remarkable elevation of urinary exosome excretion in Asah1fl/fl/PodoCre mice compared with WT/WT mice, which was accompanied by significant Annexin-II (an exosome marker) accumulation in glomeruli of Asah1fl/fl/PodoCre mice, as detected by immunohistochemistry. In cell studies, we also confirmed that Asah1 gene knockout enhanced exosome release in the primary cultures of podocyte isolated from Asah1fl/fl/PodoCre mice compared to WT/WT mice. In the podocytes from Asah1fl/fl/PodoCre mice, the interactions of lysosome and multivesicular body (MVB) were demonstrated to be decreased in comparison with those from their control littermates, suggesting reduced MVB degradation that may lead to increase in exosome release. Given the critical role of transient receptor potential mucolipin 1 (TRPML1) channel in Ca2+-dependent lysosome trafficking and consequent lysosome-MVB interaction, we tested whether lysosomal Ca2+ release through TRPML1 channels is inhibited in the podocytes of Asah1fl/fl/PodoCre mice. By GCaMP3 Ca2+ imaging, it was found that lysosomal Ca2+ release through TRPML1 channels was substantially suppressed in podocytes with Asah1 gene deletion. As an Ac product, sphingosine was found to rescue TRPML1 channel activity and thereby recover lysosome-MVB interaction and reduce exosome release of podocytes from Asah1fl/fl/PodoCre mice. Combination of N, N-dimethylsphingosine (DMS), a potent sphingosine kinase inhibitor, and sphingosine significantly inhibited urinary exosome excretion of Asah1fl/fl/PodoCre mice. Moreover, rescue of Aash1 gene expression in podocytes of Asah1fl/fl/PodoCre mice showed normal ceramide metabolism and exosome secretion. Based on these results, we conclude that the normal expression of Ac importantly contributes to the control of TRPML1 channel activity, lysosome-MVB interaction, and consequent exosome release from podocytes. Asah1 gene defect inhibits TRPML1 channel activity and thereby enhances exosome release, which may contribute to the development of podocytopathy and associated NS.

Abstract: Background
Extremely preterm infants are at risk of developing retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) that can cause impaired vision or blindness. Changes in blood lipids have been associated with ROP. This study aimed to monitor longitudinal changes in the serum sphingolipidome of extremely preterm infants and investigate the relationship to development of severe ROP.
Methods
This is a prospective study that included 47 infants born <28 gestational weeks. Serum samples were collected from cord blood and at postnatal days 1, 7, 14, and 28, and at postmenstrual weeks (PMW) 32, 36, and 40. Serum sphingolipids and phosphatidylcholines were extracted and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Associations between sphingolipid species and ROP were assessed using mixed models for repeated measures.
Results
The serum concentration of all investigated lipid classes, including ceramide, mono- di- and trihexosylceramide, sphingomyelin, and phosphatidylcholine displayed distinct temporal patterns between birth and PMW40. There were also substantial changes in the lipid species composition within each class. Among the analyzed sphingolipid species, sphingosine-1-phosphate showed the strongest association with severe ROP, and this association was independent of gestational age at birth and weight standard deviation score change.
Conclusions
The serum phospho- and sphingolipidome undergoes significant remodeling during the first weeks of the preterm infant's life. Low postnatal levels of the signaling lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate are associated with the development of severe ROP.

Abstract: Objective
Discovery of specific markers that reflect altered hepatic fatty acid oxidation could help to detect an individual's risk of fatty liver, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease at an early stage. Lipid and protein metabolism are intimately linked, but our understanding of this crosstalk remains limited.
Methods
In male Wistar rats, we used synthetic fatty acid analogues (3-thia fatty acids) as a tool to induce hepatic fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis, to gain new insight into the link between fatty acid oxidation, amino acid metabolism and TCA cycle-related intermediate metabolites in liver and plasma.
Results
Rats treated with 3-thia fatty acids had 3-fold higher hepatic, but not adipose and skeletal muscle, expression of the thioesterase 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase (Hibch), which controls the formation of 3-hydroxyisobutyrate (3-HIB) in the valine degradation pathway. Consequently, 3-thia fatty acid-stimulated hepatic fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis was accompanied by decreased plasma 3-HIB and increased methylmalonic acid (MMA) concentrations further downstream in BCAA catabolism. The higher plasma MMA corresponded to higher MMA-CoA hydrolase activity and hepatic expression of GTP-specific succinyl-CoA synthase (Suclg2) and succinate dehydrogenase (Sdhb), and lower MMA-CoA mutase activity. Plasma 3-HIB correlated positively to plasma and hepatic concentrations of TAG, plasma total fatty acids, plasma NEFA and insulin/glucose ratio, while the reverse correlations were seen for MMA.
Conclusion
Our study provides new insight into TCA cycle-related metabolic changes associated with altered hepatic fatty acid flux, and identifies 3-HIB and MMA as novel circulating markers reflective of mitochondrial β-oxidation in male Wistar rats.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder involving neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques. The tau phosphorylation responsible for neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid deposition which causes plaques are both accelerated through the activity of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO). In addition to these pathological pathways, 5-LO has also been linked to the neuro-inflammation associated with disease progression as well as to dysbiosis in the gut. Interestingly, gut dysbiosis itself has been correlated to AD development. Not only do gut metabolites have direct effects on the brain, but pro-inflammatory mediators such as LPS, BMAA and bacterial amyloids produced in the gut due to dysbiosis reach the brain causing increased neuro-inflammation. While microbial dysbiosis and 5-LO exert detrimental effects in the brain, the cause/effect relationship between these factors remain unknown. These issues may be addressed using mouse models of AD in the context of different knockout mice in the 5-LO pathway in specific pathogen-free, germ-free as well as gnotobiotic conditions.

Abstract: Hypercholesterolemia has strong heritability and about 40–60% of hypercholesterolemia is caused by genetic risk factors. A number of monogenic genes have been identified so far for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). However, in the general population, more than 90% of individuals with LDL cholesterol over 190 mg/dL do not carry known FH mutations. Large scale whole-exome sequencing has identified thousands of variants that are predicted to be loss-of-function (LoF) and each individual has a median of about twenty rare LoF variants and several hundreds more common LoF variants. However, majority of those variants have not been characterized and their functional consequence remains largely unknown. Rs77542162 is a common missense variant in ABCA6 and is strongly associated with hypercholesterolemia in different populations. ABCA6 is a cholesterol responsive gene and has been suggested to play a role in lipid metabolism. However, whether and how rs77542162 and ABCA6 regulate lipoprotein metabolism remain unknown. In current study, we systemically characterized the function of rs77542162 and ABCA6 in cultured cells and in vivo of rodents. We found that Abca6 is specifically expressed on the basolateral surface of hepatocytes in mouse liver. The rs77542162 variant disrupts ABCA6 protein stability and results in loss of functional protein. However, we found no evidence that Abca6 plays a role in lipoprotein metabolism in either normal mice or hypercholesterolemia mice or hamsters. Thus, our results suggest that Abca6 does not regulate lipoprotein metabolism in rodents and highlight the challenge and importance of functional characterization of disease-associated variants in animal models.

Abstract: Sphingomyelin (SM) is one major phospholipids on lipoproteins. It is enriched on apolipoprotein B-containing particles, including very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and its catabolites, low-density lipoprotein (LDL). SM is synthesized by sphingomyelin synthase 1 and 2 (SMS1 and SMS2) which utilizes ceramide and phosphatidylcholine, as two substrates, to produce SM and diacylglyceride. SMS1 and SMS2 activities are co-expressed in all tested tissues, including the liver where VLDL is produced. Thus, neither Sms1 gene knockout (KO) nor Sms2 KO approach is sufficient to evaluate the effect of SMS on VLDL metabolism. We prepared liver-specific Sms1 KO/global Sms2 KO mice to evaluate the effect of hepatocyte SM biosynthesis in lipoprotein metabolism. We found that hepatocyte total SMS depletion significantly reduces cellular sphingomyelin levels. Also, we found that the deficiency induces cellular glycosphingolipid levels which is specifically related with SMS1 but not SMS2 deficiency. To our surprise, hepatocyte total SMS deficiency has marginal effect on hepatocyte ceramide, diacylglyceride, and phosphatidylcholine levels. Importantly, total SMS deficiency decreases plasma triglyceride but not apoB levels and reduces larger VLDL concentration. The reduction of triglyceride levels also was observed when the animals were on a high fat diet. Our results show that hepatocyte total SMS blocking can reduce VLDL-triglyceride production and plasma triglyceride levels. This phenomenon could be related with a reduction of atherogenicity.

Abstract: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of visual disorder in aged people and may lead to complete blindness with ageing. The major clinical feature of AMD is the presence of cholesterol enriched deposits underneath the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. The deposits can induce oxidative stress and inflammation. It has been suggested that abnormal cholesterol homeostasis contributes to the pathogenesis of AMD. However, the functional role of defective cholesterol homeostasis in AMD remains elusive. STARD proteins are a family of proteins that contain a steroidogenic acute regulatory protein-related lipid transfer domain. There are fifteen STARD proteins in mammals and some, such as STARD3, are responsible for cholesterol trafficking. Previously there was no study of STARD proteins in retinal cholesterol metabolism and trafficking. Here we examined expression of the Stard3 gene in mouse retinal and RPE cells at ages of 2 and 20 months. We found that expression of Stard 3 gene transcripts in both mouse RPE and retina was significantly decreased at age of 20 months when compared to that of age 2 months old. We created a stable ARPE-19 cell line overexpressing STARD3 and found this resulted in increased cholesterol efflux, reduced accumulation of intracellular oxidized LDL, increased antioxidant capacity and lower levels of inflammatory cytokines. The data suggested that STARD3 is a potential target for AMD through promoting the removal of intracellular cholesterol and slowing the disease progression.

Abstract: Lysosome Associated Protein Transmembrane 4B (LAPTM4B) is a four-membrane spanning ceramide interacting protein that regulates mTORC1 signaling. Here, we show that LAPTM4B is sorted into intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) of multivesicular endosomes (MVEs) and released in small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) into conditioned cell culture medium and human urine. Efficient sorting of LAPTM4B into ILV membranes depends on its third transmembrane domain containing a sphingolipid interaction motif (SLim). Unbiased lipidomic analysis reveals a strong enrichment of glycosphingolipids in sEVs secreted from LAPTM4B knockout cells and from cells expressing a SLim-deficient LAPTM4B mutant. The altered sphingolipid profile is accompanied by a distinct SLim-dependent co-modulation of ether lipid species. The changes in the lipid composition of sEVs derived from LAPTM4B knockout cells is reflected by an increased stability of membrane nanodomains of sEVs. These results identify LAPTM4B as a determinant of the glycosphingolipid profile and membrane properties of sEVs.

Abstract: The α-tocopherol-derived long-chain metabolite (α-LCM) α-13′-carboxychromanol (α-13′-COOH) is formed via enzymatic degradation of α-tocopherol (α-TOH) in the liver. In the last decade, α-13′-COOH has emerged as a new regulatory metabolite revealing more potent or even different effects compared with its vitamin precursor α-TOH. The detection of α-13′-COOH in human serum has further strengthened the concept of its physiological relevance as a potential regulatory molecule. Here, we present a new facet on the interaction of α-13′-COOH with macrophage foam cell formation. We found that α-13′-COOH (5 μM) increases angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) mRNA expression in human THP-1 macrophages in a time- and dose-dependent manner, while α-TOH (100 μM) showed no effects. Interestingly, the mRNA level of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) was not influenced by α-13′-COOH, but α-TOH treatment led to a reduction of LPL mRNA expression. Both compounds also revealed different effects on protein level: while α-13′-COOH reduced the secreted amount of LPL protein via induction of ANGPTL4 cleavage, i.e. activation, the secreted amount of LPL in the α-TOH-treated samples was diminished due to the inhibition of mRNA expression. In line with this, both compounds reduced the catalytic activity of LPL. However, α-13′-COOH but not α-TOH attenuated VLDL-induced lipid accumulation by 35%. In conclusion, only α-13′-COOH revealed possible antiatherogenic effects due to the reduction of VLDL-induced foam cell formation in THP-1 macrophages. Our results provide further evidence for the role of α-13′-COOH as a functional metabolite of its vitamin E precursor.

Abstract: Lipid droplet (LD) is a vital organelle governing lipid homeostasis and Rab18 has been linked to lipid metabolism. However, the mechanisms of Rab18-mediated LD dynamics in myoblast cells remain elusive. Here, we report that Rab18 plays an important role in oleic acid (OA)-induced LD accumulation in mouse myoblast C2C12 cells. Rab18 was translocated from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to LDs during LD accumulation, which was regulated by perilipin 2 (PLIN2), a major LD protein. LD-associated Rab18 bound with the C terminus of PLIN2 and the LD localization of Rab18 was diminished when PLIN2 was depleted. Moreover, loss of function of Rab18 led to reduced triacylglycerol (TAG) level and fewer but larger LDs. In contrast, overexpression of Rab18 resulted in elevated TAG content and LD number. Furthermore, LD-associated Rab18 interacted with acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 3 (ACSL3), which in turn promoted the LD localization of this protein. These data show that Rab18 interacts with PLIN2 and forms a complex with PLIN2 and ACSL3, which plays a critical role in LD accumulation and dynamics of myoblast cells.

Abstract: Neuronostatin is a peptide hormone encoded by the somatostatin gene. Biological effects of neuronostatin are mediated through activation of GPR107. There is evidence indicating that neuronostatin modulates energy homeostasis by suppressing food intake and insulin secretion, while stimulating glucagon secretion. While it was found that neuronostatin receptor is expressed in white adipose tissue, the role of neuronostatin in controlling adipose tissue formation is unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of neuronostatin on proliferation and differentiation of rat primary preadipocytes and 3T3-L1 cells. We found that neuronostatin receptor GPR107 is expressed in rat preadipocytes and 3T3-L1 cells. Neuronostatin promotes proliferation of preadipocytes via AKT activation. Downregulation of GPR107 mRNA expression and protein production results in an attenuation of neuronostatin-induced stimulation of preadipocyte proliferation. Moreover, neuronostatin reduces intracellular lipid content and the expression of adipogenesis-modulating genes C/ebpα, C/ebpβ, Pparγ, and Fabp4. In summary, these results show that neuronostatin, AKT-dependently, stimulates the proliferation of preadipocytes via GPR107. In contrast, neuronostatin inhibits the differentiation of preadipocytes into mature adipocytes.

Abstract: Endocytosis and intracellular trafficking constitute important regulatory features associated with G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) function. GPCR endocytosis involves several remodeling events at the plasma membrane orchestrated by a concerted interplay of a large number of proteins and membrane lipids. Although considerable literature exists on the protein framework underlying GPCR endocytosis, the role of membrane lipids in this process remains largely unexplored. In order to explore the role of membrane cholesterol (an essential and important lipid in higher eukaryotes) in GPCR endocytosis, we monitored the effect of acute cholesterol depletion using methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) on endocytosis and intracellular trafficking of the serotonin1A receptor, an important neurotransmitter GPCR. Our results show that the serotonin1A receptor exhibits agonist-induced clathrin-mediated endocytosis with a concentration-dependent inhibition in internalization with increasing concentrations of MβCD, which was restored upon cholesterol replenishment. Interestingly, subsequent to internalization under these conditions, serotonin1A receptors were re-routed toward lysosomal degradation, instead of endosomal recycling observed under normal conditions, thereby implicating membrane cholesterol in modulation of intracellular trafficking of the receptor. This raises the possibility of a novel cholesterol-dependent role of intracellular sorting proteins in GPCR trafficking. These results differ from our previous observations on the endocytosis of the serotonin1A receptor upon statin-induced chronic cholesterol depletion, in terms of endocytic pathway. We conclude that analysis of complex cellular trafficking events such as GPCR endocytosis under acute and chronic cholesterol depletion conditions should be carried out with caution due to fundamental differences underlying these processes.

Abstract: The biogenesis of peroxisomes in relation to the trafficking of proteins to peroxisomes has been extensively examined. However, the supply of phospholipids, which is needed to generate peroxisomal membranes in mammals, remains unclear. Therefore, we herein investigated metabolic alterations induced by clofibric acid, a peroxisome proliferator, in the synthesis of phospholipids, particularly phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) molecular species, and their relationship with the biogenesis of peroxisomal membranes. The subcutaneous administration of clofibric acid to rats at a relatively low dose (130 mg/kg) once a day time-dependently and gradually increased the integrated perimeter of peroxisomes per 100 μm2 hepatocyte cytoplasm (PA). A strong correlation was observed between the content (μmol/mg DNA) of PE containing arachidonic acid (20:4) and PA (r2 = 0.9168). Moreover, the content of PE containing octadecenoic acid (18:1) positively correlated with PA (r2 = 0.8094). The treatment with clofibric acid markedly accelerated the formation of 16:0–20:4 PE by increasing the production of 20:4 and the activity of acyl chain remodeling of pre-existing PE molecular species. Increases in the acyl chain remodeling of PE by clofibric acid were mainly linked to the up-regulated expression of the Lpcat3 gene. On the other hand, clofibric acid markedly increased the formation of palmitic acid (16:0)–18:1 PE through de novo synthesis. These results suggest that the enhanced formation of particular PE molecular species is related to increases in the mass of peroxisomal membranes in peroxisome proliferation in the liver.

Abstract: N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), and in particular docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have many beneficial metabolic effects, including reducing epidermal thickness in patients with psoriasis. The positive impacts of DHA in psoriasis could be mediated by its interactions with the PPAR signaling pathway, as well as by its secretion of anti-inflammatory bioactive metabolites, but the detailed metabolism is still not understood. In the present study, we evaluated the influence of DHA on the main features of psoriasis and its effects on the PPAR signaling pathway, in a psoriatic in vitro skin model. Healthy and psoriatic skin substitutes were produced according to the tissue-engineered self-assembly method, using culture media supplemented with 10 μM of DHA. The presence of DHA led to a reduction in the abnormal cell differentiation of psoriatic keratinocytes, seen in the increased expression of filaggrin and keratin 10. DHA was incorporated into the membrane phospholipids of the epidermis and transformed principally into eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Furthermore, the addition of DHA into the culture medium led to a decrease in the levels of lipid mediators derived from n-6 PUFAs, mainly prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE). Finally, DHA supplementation rebalanced the expression of PPAR receptors and caused a decrease in the secretion of TNF-α. Altogether, our results show that DHA possesses the ability to attenuate the psoriatic characteristics of psoriatic skin substitutes, mostly by restoring epidermal cell differentiation and proliferation, as well as by reducing inflammation.

Abstract: Different strategies to boost NAD+ levels are considered promising means to promote healthy aging and ameliorate dysfunctional metabolism. CD38 is a NAD+-dependent enzyme involved in the regulation of different cell functions. In the context of systemic energy metabolism, it has been demonstrated that brown adipocytes, the parenchymal cells of brown adipose tissue (BAT) as well as beige adipocytes that emerge in white adipose tissue (WAT) depots in response to catabolic conditions, are important to maintain metabolic homeostasis. In this study we aim to understand the functional relevance of CD38 for NAD+ and energy metabolism in BAT and WAT, also using a CD38−/− mouse model. During cold exposure, an increase in NAD+ levels occurred in BAT of wild type mice, together with a marked downregulation of CD38, as detected at the mRNA and protein level. CD38 downregulation was observed also in WAT of cold-exposed mice, where it was accompanied by a strong increase in NADP(H) levels. Accordingly, NAD kinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities were enhanced in WAT (but not in BAT). Increased NAD+ levels were observed in BAT/WAT from CD38−/− compared with wild type mice, in line with CD38 being a major NAD+-consumer in AT. CD38−/− mice kept at 6 °C had higher levels of Ucp1 and Pgc-1α in BAT and WAT, and increased levels of phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase in BAT, compared with wild type mice. These results demonstrate that CD38, by modulating cellular NAD(P)+ levels, is involved in the regulation of thermogenic responses in cold-activated BAT and WAT.

Abstract: Accumulation of excess cholesterol and cholesteryl ester in macrophage ‘foam’ cells within the arterial intima characterises early ‘fatty streak’ atherosclerotic lesions, and is accompanied by epigenetic changes, including altered expression of microRNA sequences which determine of gene and protein expression. This study established that exposure to lipoproteins, including acetylated LDL, induced macrophage expression of microRNA hsa-let-7d-5p, a sequence previously linked with tumour suppression, and repressed expression of one of its target genes, high mobility group AT hook 2 (HMGA2). A let-7d-5p mimic repressed expression of HMGA2 (18%; p < 0.05) while a marked increase (2.9-fold; p < 0.05) in expression of HMGA2 was noted in the presence of let-7d-5p inhibitor. Under these conditions, let-7d-5p mimic significantly (p < 0.05) decreased total (10%), free (8%) and cholesteryl ester (21%) mass, while the inhibitor significantly (p < 0.05) increased total (29%) and free cholesterol (29%) mass, compared with the relevant controls. Let-7d-5p inhibition significantly (p < 0.05) increased endogenous biosynthesis of cholesterol (38%) and cholesteryl ester (39%) pools in macrophage ‘foam’ cells, without altering the cholesterol efflux pathway, or esterification of exogenous radiolabelled oleate. Let-7d-5p inhibition in sterol-loaded cells increased the level of HMGA2 protein (32%; p < 0.05), while SiRNA knockdown of this protein (29%; p < 0.05) resulted in a (21%, p < 0.05) reduction in free cholesterol mass. Thus, induction of let-7d-5p, and repression of its target HMGA2, in macrophages is a protective response to the challenge of increased cholesterol influx into these cells; dysregulation of this response may contribute to atherosclerosis and other disorders such as cancer.

Abstract: Mitochondria are dynamic organelles crucial for cell function and survival implicated in oxidative energy production whose central functions are tightly controlled by lipids. StarD7 is a lipid transport protein involved in the phosphatidylcholine (PC) delivery to mitochondria. Previous studies have shown that StarD7 knockdown induces alterations in mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with a reduction in PC content, however whether StarD7 modulates mitochondrial dynamics remains unexplored. Here, we generated HTR-8/SVneo stable cells expressing the precursor StarD7.I and the mature processed StarD7.II isoforms. We demonstrated that StarD7.I overexpression altered mitochondrial morphology increasing its fragmentation, whereas no changes were observed in StarD7.II-overexpressing cells compared to the control (Ct) stable cells. StarD7.I (D7.I) stable cells were able to transport higher fluorescent PC analog to mitochondria than Ct cells, yield mitochondrial fusions, maintained the membrane potential, and produced lower levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Additionally, the expression of Dynamin Related Protein 1 (Drp1) and Mitofusin (Mfn2) proteins were increased, whereas the amount of Mitofusin 1 (Mfn1) decreased. Moreover, transfections with plasmids encoding Drp1-K38A, Drp1-S637D or Drp1-S637A mutants indicated that mitochondrial fragmentation in D7.I cells occurs in a fission-dependent manner via Drp1. In contrast, StarD7 silencing decreased Mfn1 and Mfn2 fusion proteins without modification of Drp1 protein level. These cells increased ROS levels and presented donut-shape mitochondria, indicative of metabolic stress. Altogether our findings provide novel evidence indicating that alterations in StarD7.I expression produce significant changes in mitochondrial morphology and dynamics.

Abstract: A high intake in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (C20:5 n-3), is cardioprotective. Dietary PUFAs incorporate into membrane phospholipids, which may modify the function of membrane proteins. We investigated the consequences of the membrane incorporation of several PUFAs on the key antiatherogenic ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux pathway. Human THP-1 macrophages were incubated with EPA, arachidonic acid (AA) (C20:4 n-6) or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (C22:6 n-3) for a long time to mimic a chronic exposure. EPA 70 μM, but not AA 50 μM or DHA 15 μM, increased ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein (apo) AI by 28% without altering aqueous diffusion. No variation in ABCA1 expression or localization was observed after EPA treatment. EPA incorporation did not affect the phenotype of THP-1 macrophages. The membrane phospholipids composition of EPA cells displayed higher levels of both EPA and its elongation product docosapentaenoic acid, which was associated with drastic lower levels of AA. Treatment by EPA increased the ATPase activity of the transporter, likely through a PKA-dependent mechanism. Eicosanoids were not involved in the stimulated ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux from EPA-enriched macrophages. In addition, EPA supplementation increased the apo AI binding capacity from macrophages by 38%. Moreover, the increased apo AI binding in EPA-enriched macrophages can be competed. In conclusion, EPA membrane incorporation increased ABCA1 functionality in cholesterol-normal human THP-1 macrophages, likely through a combination of different mechanisms. This beneficial in vitro effect may partly contribute to the cardioprotective effect of a diet enriched with EPA highlighted by several recent clinical trials.

Abstract: Bacterial membranes are primarily composed of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and cardiolipin (CL). In the canonical PE biosynthesis pathway, phosphatidylserine (PS) is decarboxylated by the Psd enzyme. CL formation typically depends on CL synthases (Cls) using two PG molecules as substrates. Only few bacteria produce phosphatidylcholine (PC), the hallmark of eukaryotic membranes. Most of these bacteria use phospholipid N-methyltransferases to successively methylate PE to PC and/or a PC synthase (Pcs) to catalyze the condensation of choline and CDP-diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG) to PC. In this study, we show that membranes of Pseudomonas species able to interact with eukaryotes contain PE, PG, CL and PC. More specifically, we report on PC formation and a poorly characterized CL biosynthetic pathway in the plant pathogen P. syringae pv. tomato. It encodes a Pcs enzyme responsible for choline-dependent PC biosynthesis. CL formation is catalyzed by a promiscuous phospholipase D (PLD)-type enzyme (PSPTO_0095) that we characterized in vivo and in vitro. Like typical bacterial CL biosynthesis enzymes, it uses PE and PG for CL production. This enzyme is also able to convert PE and glycerol to PG, which is then combined with another PE molecule to synthesize CL. In addition, the enzyme is capable of converting ethanolamine or methylated derivatives into the corresponding phospholipids such as PE both in P. syringae and in E. coli. It can also hydrolyze CDP-DAG to yield phosphatidic acid (PA). Our study adds an example of a promiscuous Cls enzyme able to synthesize a suite of products according to the available substrates.

Abstract: White (WAT) and brown (BAT) adipose tissue, the two main types of adipose organ, are responsible for lipid storage and non-shivering thermogenesis, respectively. Thermogenesis is a process mediated by mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) which uncouples oxidative phosphorylation from ATP production, leading to the conversion of free fatty acids to heat. This process can be triggered by exposure to low ambient temperatures, caloric excess, and the immune system. Recently mitochondrial thermogenesis has also been associated with plasma lipoprotein transport system. Specifically, apolipoprotein (APO) E3 is shown to have a bimodal effect on WAT thermogenesis that is highly dependent on its site of expression. Similarly, APOE2 and APOE4 differentially affect BAT and WAT mitochondrial metabolic activity in processes highly modulated by APOA1. Furthermore, the absence of classical APOA1 containing HDL (APOA1-HDL), is associated with no measurable non-shivering thermogenesis in WAT of mice fed high fat diet. Based on these previous observations which indicate important regulatory roles for both APOA1 and APOE in adipose tissue mitochondrial metabolic activity, here we sought to investigate the potential roles of these apolipoproteins in BAT and WAT metabolic activation in mice, following stimulation by cold exposure (7 °C). Our data indicate that APOA1-HDL promotes metabolic activation of BAT only in the presence of very low levels (virtually undetectable) of APOE3-containing HDL (APOE3-HDL), which acts as an inhibitor in this process. In contrast, induction of WAT thermogenesis is subjected to a more complicated regulation which requires the combined presence of both APOA1-HDL and APOE3-HDL.

Abstract: Adipogenesis is described as the process of conversion of pre-adipocytes into differentiated lipid-laden adipocytes. Adipogenesis is known to be regulated by a myriad of transcription factors and co-regulators. However, there is a dearth of information regarding the mechanisms that regulate these transcription factors and hence control adipogenesis. PPARγ is the master transcriptional regulator of adipogenesis and its expression is essential for adipocyte differentiation. Herein, we identified that scaffold/matrix attachment region-binding protein 1 (SMAR1) negatively regulates adipogenesis. We observed that SMAR1 gets downregulated during adipocyte differentiation and knockdown of SMAR1 promotes lipid accumulation and adipocyte differentiation. Mechanistically, we have shown that SMAR1 suppresses PPARγ through recruitment of the HDAC1/mSin3a repressor complex to the PPARγ promoter. We further identified cell division cycle 20 (cdc20) mediated proteasomal degradation of SMAR1 during adipogenesis. Moreover, knockdown of cdc20 resulted in stabilization of SMAR1 and a reduction in adipocyte differentiation. Taken together, our observations suggest that SMAR1 functions as a negative regulator of adipogenesis by inhibiting PPARγ expression in differentiating adipocytes.

Abstract: Inducible beige adipocytes are emerging as an interesting issue in obesity and metabolism research. There is a neglected possibility that brown adipocytes are equally activated when external stimuli induce the formation of beige adipocytes. Thus, the question is whether beige adipocytes have the same functions as brown adipocytes when brown adipose tissue (BAT) is lacking. This question has not been well studied. Therefore we determine the beneficial effects of beige adipocytes upon cold challenge or CL316243 treatments in animal models of interscapular BAT (iBAT) ablation by surgical denervation. We found that denervated iBAT were activated by cold exposure and CL316243 treatments. The data show that beige adipocytes partly contribute to the improvement of impaired glucose metabolism resulting from denervated iBAT. Thus, we further used iBAT-removal animal models to abolish iBAT functions completely. We found that beige adipocytes upon cold exposure or CL316243 treatments improved impaired glucose metabolism and enhanced glucose uptake in iBAT-removal mice. The insulin signaling was activated in iBAT-removal mice upon cold exposure. Both the activation of insulin signaling and up-regulation of glucose transporter expression were observed in iBAT-removal mice with CL316243 treatments. The data show that inducible beige adipocytes may have different mechanisms to improve impaired glucose metabolism. Inducible beige adipocytes can also enhance energy expenditure and lipolytic activity of white adipose tissues when iBAT is lacking. We provide direct evidences for the beneficial effect of inducible beige adipocytes in glucose metabolism and energy expenditure in the absence of iBAT in vivo.

Abstract: Mitochondrial abundance and thermogenic capacity are two imperative components that distinguish brown, beige and white adipose tissues. Most importantly, the lipid composition is vital for maintaining the quantity, quality and function of mitochondria. Therefore, we employed quantitative lipidomics to probe the mitochondrial lipidome of adipose tissues. The mitochondrial lipidome reveals β3-adrenergic stimulation and aging drastically altered the levels of phosphatidylcholine (PC)/phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) ratio and acyl chain desaturation. Precisely, PC36:2 and PE38:4 levels correlate with the increased brown and beige fat activity in young mice. While aging increased lysoPC species in white adipose tissue (WAT) mitochondria, CL-316,243 administration reduced lysoPC species and increased lyso-PE18:1 and 18:2 content during WAT browning. Also, non-thermogenic mitochondria accumulate sphingomyelin (SM), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidic acid (PA) and ether-linked PC (ePC). Similarly, enrichment of phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and cardiolipin (CL) levels are associated with thermogenic mitochondria. Also, our in vitro experiment supports that blocking the de novo sphingolipid synthesis pathway by myriocin, SPT1 inhibitor increased the thermogenic capacity and oxygen consumption rate in mature adipocytes. Overall, our study suggests mitochondria of brown, beige and white adipose tissues own a unique pattern of lipid molecular species and their levels are altered by aging and CL-316,243 administration.

Abstract: Sphingomyelin synthase related protein (SMSr) has no SM synthase activity but has ceramide phosphorylethanolamine (CPE) synthase activity in vitro. Although SMSr is ubiquitously expressed in all tested tissues, the CPE levels in most mammalian tissues or cells are extremely low or undetectable. Therefore, SMSr seems not to be a functional CPE synthase in vivo and its real biological function needs to be elucidated. In this study, we utilized purified recombinant SMSr and adenovirus-mediated SMSr in vivo expression to show that SMSr has phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipases C (PE-PLC) activity, i.e., it can generate DAG through PE hydrolysis in the absence of ceramide. Further, we found that SMSr has no phosphatidylcholine (PC)-PLC, phosphatidylserine (PS)-PLC, phosphatidylglycerol (PG)-PLC, and phosphatidic phosphatase (PAP) activities, indicating that SMSr-mediated PE-PLC activity has specificity. We conclude that SMSr is a mammalian PE-PLC. Importantly, SMSr can regulate steady state levels of PE in vivo, and it should be a new tool for PE-related biological study.

Abstract: Hedgehog (Hh) pathway plays a central role in vertebrate embryonic development and carcinogenesis. The G-protein coupled receptor-like protein Smoothened (SMO) is one of the major members in Hh pathway. Covalent modification of cholesterol on the 95th asparagine (D95) of human SMO, which is regulated by Hh and PTCH1, is critical for SMO activation. However, it is not known whether SMO cholesterylation is regulated by other proteins. In this study, we identified Emopamil binding protein (EBP, also known as 3-beta-hydroxysteroid-Delta(8),Delta(7)-isomerase) as a SMO-interacting protein. Overexpression of EBP suppressed SMO cholesterylation and Hh pathway activity, whereas genetic disruption of EBP enhanced SMO cholesterylation and the downstream signaling. EBP-mediated inhibition of SMO cholesterylation was independent of its isomerase activity, but dependent on the C-terminus of EBP that was required for SMO binding. The X-linked dominant chondrodysplasia punctate 2 (CDPX2)-associated EBP mutants inhibited SMO cholesterylation too. Together, this study shows that EBP modulates SMO cholesterylation through direct binding and suggests a possible mechanism of CDPX2 pathogenesis.

Contribution of DHA diols (19,20-DHDP) produced by cytochrome P450s and soluble epoxide hydrolase to the beneficial effects of DHA supplementation in the brains of rotenone-induced rat models of Parkinson's disease,

Abstract: Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has been shown to have neuroprotective effects in Parkinson's disease, but the underlying mechanism has not been fully elucidated. DHA is metabolized to DHA epoxides (EDPs) and hydroxides by cytochrome P450s (P450s), and EDPs are further hydroxylated to the corresponding diols, dihydroxydocosapentaenoic acids (DHDPs) by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). In the present study, we investigated the roles of these DHA metabolites in the beneficial effects of DHA supplementation on a rotenone-induced rat model of Parkinson's disease. Metabolite analysis by LC-MS revealed that CYP2A1, 2C11, 2C13, 2C23, and 2E1 contributed to the formation of EDPs, and these P450s and sEH were expressed in the rat brain. We found that DHA supplementation in rats improved the motor dysfunction induced by rotenone. In addition, DHA reversed the decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase and the increase in lipid peroxidation generated by rotenone in the striatum. DHA supplementation also induced mRNA expression of antioxidant genes, such as sod1 and catalase, and Nrf2 protein expression in the striatum. However, these effects of DHA supplementation were eliminated by cosupplementation with the sEH inhibitor TPPU. Supplementation with DHA increased the amount of 19,20-DHDP in the rat brain, while the amount of EDPs was not significantly increased. In addition, TPPU suppressed the increase in DHDPs and increased EDPs in the brain. In PC12 cells, 19,20-DHDP increased the mRNA levels of sod1 and catalase along with Nrf2 induction. This study suggests that DHA metabolites—DHDPs generated by P450s and sEH—have an important role in improving rotenone-induced Parkinson's disease.

Abstract: 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) is an arachidonic acid derived lipid mediator which can originate both from 15-lipoxygenase (15-LOX) activity and cyclooxygenase (COX) activity. The enzymatic source determines the enantiomeric profile of the 15-HETE formed. 15-HETE is the most abundant arachidonic acid metabolite in the human lung and has been suggested to influence the pathophysiology of asthma. Mast cells are central effectors in asthma, but there are contradictory reports on whether 15-HETE originates from 15-LOX or COX in human mast cells. This prompted the current study where the pathway of 15-HETE biosynthesis was examined in three human mast cell models; the cell line LAD2, cord blood derived mast cells (CBMC) and tissue isolated human lung mast cells (HLMC). Levels and enantiomeric profiles of 15-HETE and levels of the downstream metabolite 15-KETE, were analyzed by UPLC-MS/MS after stimulation with anti-IgE or calcium ionophore A23187 in the presence and absence of inhibitors of COX isoenzymes. We found that 15-HETE was produced by COX-1 in human mast cells under these experimental conditions. Unexpectedly, chiral analysis showed that the 15(R) isomer was predominant and gradually accumulated, whereas the 15(S) isomer was metabolized by the 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase. We conclude that during physiological conditions, i.e., without addition of exogenous arachidonic acid, both enantiomers of 15-HETE are produced by COX-1 in human mast cells but that the 15(S) isomer is selectively depleted by undergoing further metabolism. The study highlights that 15-HETE cannot be used as an indicator of 15-LOX activity for cellular studies, unless chirality and sensitivity to pharmacologic inhibition is determined.

Abstract: Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a complex and rare pathology, which is mainly associated to mutations in the NPC1 gene. This disease is phenotypically characterized by the abnormal accumulation of multiple lipid species in the acidic compartments of the cell. Due to the complexity of stored material, a clear molecular mechanism explaining NPC pathophysiology is still not established. Abnormal sphingosine accumulation was suggested as the primary factor involved in the development of NPC, followed by the accumulation of other lipid species. To provide additional mechanistic insight into the role of sphingosine in NPC development, fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy were used to study the biophysical properties of biological membranes using different cellular models of NPC. Addition of sphingosine to healthy CHO-K1 cells, in conditions where other lipid species are not yet accumulated, caused a rapid decrease in plasma membrane and lysosome membrane fluidity, suggesting a direct effect of sphingosine rather than a downstream event. Changes in membrane fluidity caused by addition of sphingosine were partially sustained upon impaired trafficking and metabolization of cholesterol in these cells, and could recapitulate the decrease in membrane fluidity observed in NPC1 null Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells (CHO-M12) and in cells with pharmacologically induced NPC phenotype (treated with U18666A). In summary, these results show for the first time that the fluidity of the membranes is altered in models of NPC and that these changes are in part caused by sphingosine, supporting the role of this lipid in the pathophysiology of NPC.

Abstract: Although most mammalian fatty acids (FAs) are straight-chain, there also exist branched-chain FAs such as iso- and anteiso-FAs, especially in the meibomian glands. Meibum lipids, which are secreted from the meibomian glands and are important for dry eye prevention, contain abundant branched-chain lipids, such as cholesteryl esters and wax esters with chain-lengths of ≥C21 (very-long-chain; VLC). However, the exact tissue distribution of branched-chain lipids or the enzymes involved in the production of branched-chain VLCFAs has remained poorly understood. Here, we revealed that FA elongases ELOVL1, ELOVL3, and ELOVL7, of the seven mammalian ELOVL isozymes, elongated saturated branched-chain acyl-CoAs. ELOVL3 was highly active toward iso-C17:0 and anteiso-C17:0 acyl-CoAs and elongated them up to iso-C23:0 and anteiso-C25:0 acyl-CoAs, respectively. ELOVL1 elongated both iso- and anteiso-C23:0 acyl-CoAs to C25:0 acyl-CoAs. By establishing a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method capable of separating branched- and straight-chain lipids, we showed that essentially all of the cholesteryl esters and 88% of the wax esters in the mouse meibomian glands are branched. In Elovl1 mutant mice, the levels of ≥C24:0 branched-chain cholesteryl esters and ≥C25:0 branched-chain wax esters were decreased, indicating that ELOVL1 indeed elongates branched-chain VLC acyl-CoAs in vivo. In addition, substantial amounts of ceramides containing branched-chain FAs were present in the skin, meibomian glands, and liver. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms that create FA and lipid diversity.

Abstract: The nutrient sensors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) closely interact in the regulation of adipocyte lipid storage. The precise mechanisms underlying this interaction and whether this extends to other metabolic processes and the endocrine function of adipocytes are still unknown. We investigated herein the involvement of mTORC1 as a mediator of the actions of the PPARγ ligand rosiglitazone in subcutaneous inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) mass, endocrine function, lipidome, transcriptome and branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism. Mice bearing regulatory associated protein of mTOR (Raptor) deletion and therefore mTORC1 deficiency exclusively in adipocytes and littermate controls were fed a high-fat diet supplemented or not with the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone (30 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks and evaluated for iWAT mass, lipidome, transcriptome (Rnaseq), respiration and BCAA metabolism. Adipocyte mTORC1 deficiency not only impaired iWAT adiponectin transcription, synthesis and secretion, PEPCK mRNA levels, triacylglycerol synthesis and BCAA oxidation and mRNA levels of related proteins but also completely blocked the upregulation in these processes induced by pharmacological PPARγ activation with rosiglitazone. Mechanistically, adipocyte mTORC1 deficiency impairs PPARγ transcriptional activity by reducing PPARγ protein content, as well as by downregulating C/EBPα, a co-partner and facilitator of PPARγ. In conclusion, mTORC1 and PPARγ are essential partners involved in the regulation of subcutaneous adipose tissue adiponectin production and secretion and BCAA oxidative metabolism.

Abstract: Lipid rafts are membrane microdomains featuring high cholesterol, sphingolipid, and protein content. These microdomains recruit various receptors, ion channels, and signaling molecules for coordination of various cellular functions, including synaptic transmission, immune response, cytoskeletal organization, adhesion, and migration. Many of these processes also depend on Ca2+ intake. We have previously shown in Jurkat cells that activity of transient receptor potential vanilloid, type 6 (TRPV6) calcium channel, and TRPV6-mediated Ca2+ influx, depend on lipid raft integrity. In this study, using the transwell cell migration assay and time-lapse video microscopy with Jurkat cells, we found that lipid raft destruction was associated with: inhibited cell adhesion and migration; and decreased mean speed, maximum speed, and trajectory length. Using String Server, we constructed a Protein Interaction Network (PIN). The network indicated that TRPV6 proteins interact with the highest probability (0.9) with Src family kinase members (SFKs) involved in processes related to cell migration. Analysis of detergent-resistant membrane fractions and immunoelectron microscopy data confirmed an association in lipid rafts between TRPV6 and Lck kinase, an SFKs member. Destruction of lipid rafts led to uncoupling of TRPV6 clusters with Lck and their departure from the plasma membrane into the cytosol of the cells. Src family kinases are generally associated with their roles in tumor invasion and progression, epithelial-mesenchymal transitions, angiogenesis, and metastatic development. We suggest that a functional interaction between TRPV6 calcium channels and SFKs members in lipid rafts is one of necessary elements of migration and oncogenic signaling in leukemia cells.

Abstract: Staphyloxanthin (STX) is a saccharolipid derived from a carotenoid in Staphylococcus aureus involved in oxidative-stress tolerance and antimicrobial peptide resistance. STX influences the biophysical properties of the bacterial membrane and has been associated to the formation of lipid domains in the regulation of methicillin-resistance. In this work, a targeted metabolomics and biophysical characterization study was carried out to investigate the biosynthetic pathways of carotenoids, and their impact on the membrane biophysical properties. Five different S. aureus strains were investigated, including three wild-type strains containing the crtM gene related to STX biosynthesis, a crtM-deletion mutant, and a crtMN plasmid-complemented variant. LC-DAD-MS/MS analysis of extracts allowed the identification of 34 metabolites related to carotenogenesis in S. aureus at different growth phases (8, 24 and 48 h), showing the progression of these metabolites as the bacteria advances into the stationary phase. For the first time, 22 members of a large family of carotenoids were identified, including STX and STX-homologues, as well as Dehydro-STX and Dehydro-STX-homologues. Moreover, thermotropic behavior of the CH2 stretch of lipid acyl chains in live cells by FTIR, show that the presence of STX increases acyl chain order at the bacterial growth temperature. Indeed, the cooperative melting event of the bacterial membrane, which occurs around 15 °C in the native strains, shifts with increased carotenoid content.

Abstract: Temporal expression patterns and activity of two cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) isoforms were analysed during early chick embryogenesis to evaluate their roles in development. COX-2 inhibition with etoricoxib resulted in significant structural anomalies such as anophthalmia (born without one or both eyes), phocomelia (underdeveloped or truncated limbs), and gastroschisis (an opening in the abdominal wall), indicating its significance in embryogenesis. Furthermore, the levels of PGE2, PGD2, PGF2α, and TXB2 were assessed using quantitative LC-MS/MS to identify which effector prostanoid (s) had their synthesis initiated by COX-2. COX-2 inhibition was only shown to reduce the level of PGE2 significantly, and hence it could be inferred that the later could be largely under the regulation of activated COX-2 in chick embryos. The compensatory increase in the activity of COX-1 observed in the etoricoxib-treated group helped to maintain the levels of PGD2, PGF2α, and TXB2. Though the roles of these three prostanoids in embryogenesis need to be further clarified, it appears that their contribution to the observed developmental anomalies is minimal. This study has shown that COX-2 is functionally active during chick embryogenesis, and it plays a central role in the structural configuration of several organs and tissues through its downstream effector molecule PGE2.

Abstract: Eukaryotic unicellular pathogens from the genus Plasmodium are the etiological agents of malaria, a disease that persists over a wide range of vertebrate species, including humans. During its dynamic lifecycle, survival in the different hosts depends on the parasite's ability to establish a suitable environmental milieu. To achieve this, specific host processes are exploited to support optimal growth, including extensive modifications to the infected host cell. These modifications include the formation of novel membranous structures, which are induced by the parasite. Consequently, to maintain a finely tuned and dynamic lipid environment, the organisation and distribution of lipids to different cell sites likely requires specialised lipid transfer proteins (LTPs). Indeed, several parasite and host-derived LTPs have been identified and shown to be essential at specific stages. Here we describe the roles of LTPs in parasite development and adaptation to its host including how the latest studies are profiting from the improved genetic, lipidomic and imaging toolkits available to study Plasmodium parasites. Lastly, a list of predicted Plasmodium LTPs is provided to encourage research in this field.

Abstract: Inflammation is a constant in Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), although their relationship is unclear. In a transgenic zebrafish system with chronic systemic overexpression of human IL6 (IL6-OE) we show that inflammation can cause intra-hepatic accumulation of triglycerides. Transcriptomics and proteomics analysis of the IL6-OE liver revealed a deregulation of glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway, especially a striking down regulation of the glycolytic enzyme aldolase b. Metabolomics analysis by mass spectrometry showed accumulation of hexose monophosphates and their derivatives, which can act as precursors for triglyceride synthesis. Our results suggest that IL6-driven repression of glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, specifically aldolase b, may be a novel mechanism for fatty liver. This mechanism may be relevant for NAFLD in lean individuals, an emerging class of NAFLD prevalent more in Asian Indian populations.

Abstract: Linoleic acid (LNA)-derived 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE) is a bioactive lipid mediator that regulates multiple signaling processes in vivo. 13-HODE is also produced when LNA is oxidized during food processing. However, the absorption and incorporation kinetics of dietary 13-HODE into tissues is not known. The present study measured unesterified d4-13-HODE plasma bioavailability and incorporation into rat liver, adipose, heart and brain following gavage or intravenous (IV) injection (n = 3 per group). Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that d4-13-HODE was absorbed within 20 min of gavage, and continued to incorporate into plasma esterified lipid fractions throughout the 90 min monitoring period (incorporation half-life of 71 min). Following IV injection, unesterified d4-13-HODE was rapidly eliminated from plasma with a half-life of 1 min. Analysis of tracer incorporation kinetics into rat tissues following IV injection or gavage revealed that the esterified tracer preferentially incorporated into liver, adipose and heart compared to unesterified d4-13-HODE. No tracer was detected in the brain. This study demonstrates that dietary 13-HODE is absorbed, and incorporated into peripheral tissues from esterified plasma lipid pools. Understanding the chronic effects of dietary 13-HODE exposure on peripheral tissue physiology and metabolism merits future investigation.

Abstract: Bioactive N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) include palmitoylethanolamide, oleoylethanolamide, and anandamide, which exert anti-inflammatory, anorexic, and cannabimimetic actions, respectively. The degradation of NAEs has been attributed to two hydrolases, fatty acid amide hydrolase and NAE acid amidase (NAAA). Acid ceramidase (AC) is a lysosomal enzyme that hydrolyzes ceramide (N-acylsphingosine), which resembles NAAA in structure and function. In the present study, we examined the role of AC in the degradation of NAEs. First, we demonstrated that purified recombinant human AC can hydrolyze various NAEs with lauroylethanolamide (C12:0-NAE) as the most reactive NAE substrate. We then used HEK293 cells metabolically labeled with [14C]ethanolamine, and revealed that overexpressed AC lowered the levels of 14C-labeled NAE. As analyzed with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, AC overexpression decreased the amounts of different NAE species. Furthermore, suppression of endogenous AC in LNCaP prostate cells by siRNA increased the levels of various NAEs. Lastly, tissue homogenates from mice genetically lacking saposin D, a presumable activator protein of AC, showed much lower hydrolyzing activity for NAE as well as ceramide than the homogenates from wild-type mice. These results demonstrate the ability of AC to hydrolyze NAEs and suggest its physiological role as a third NAE hydrolase.

Abstract: Obesity is a disease characterized by imbalance between energy intake and expenditure, excessive energy store in white adipocytes, but brown and beige adipocytes consume energy to relieve obesity. In this study, we want to explore the role of the histone H3 methyltransferase Ezh2 in the differentiation of white, brown and beige adipocytes with Ezh2 conditional knockout mice (Ezh2flox/floxPrx1-cre) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). The results showed that Ezh2-deficient mice have a leaner phenotype and less white adipose tissues. The morphological changes in the adipose tissue included smaller white adipose tissue depots, white adipocytes with smaller diameter, smaller lipid droplets inside the brown adipocytes and more beige adipocytes in the Ezh2-deficient mice compared with the control. The differentiation markers of white adipocytes in Ezh2 knockout mice decreased; Ucp1 and other browning markers increased in brown and beige adipocytes. The Ezh2 knockout mice could better tolerate cold stimulation, and they can also resist obesity and insulin resistance induced by a high-fat diet. The Ezh2 inhibitor GSK126 could inhibit the differentiation of MEFs into white adipocytes but promote their differentiation into brown/beige adipocytes. The H3K27me3 demethylase Jmjd3/UTX inhibitor GSKJ4 inhibited MEFs' differentiation into brown/beige adipocytes. These results showed that Ezh2 promotes the differentiation of white adipocytes and inhibits the differentiation of brown and beige adipocytes in vivo and in vitro through its methylase activity and this may represent new knowledge for obesity therapeutic strategy.

A regulatory role of scavenger receptor class B type 1 in endocytosis and lipid droplet formation induced by liposomes containing phosphatidylethanolamine in HEK293T cells,

Abstract: We have recently reported that phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)-containing liposomes are endocytosed and then induce lipid droplets (LDs) in HEK293T cells. In this study, we elucidated a mechanism responsible for endocytosis of PE-containing liposomes and induction of LDs. By using fluorescence-labeled liposomes and flow cytometry, we found that PE-containing liposomes were very efficiently internalized in HEK293T cells. However, Block lipid transporter-1 (BLT-1) only marginally suppressed the uptake of these liposomes, indicating that entire liposomes were mostly taken up in these cells. They were therefore inferred to express abundant PE receptors responsible for endocytosis of PE-containing liposomes. We examined the expression of 52 candidate genes through transcriptomic analyses and eventually narrowed it down to four candidate genes, which were abundantly expressed in HEK293T cells. Among siRNAs targeting these candidates, scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1) siRNA showed the most profound reduction in PE liposomal uptake. Conversely, the expression of SR-B1 by transfection of an expression plasmid enhanced the uptake of PE-containing liposomes. After the internalization of PE-containing liposomes, they were colocalized with endosomes/lysosomes and SR-B1, which indicates that these liposomes are taken up in HEK293T cells at least partially through the endosomal/lysosomal pathway. A specific anti-SR-B1-antibody blocked the uptake of PE-containing liposomes in HEK293T cells while LD formation in these cells induced by PE-containing liposomes was suppressed by treatment with SR-B1 siRNA. These results demonstrate that SR-B1 functions as a receptor for the endocytosis of PE-containing liposomes and regulates the formation of LDs induced by PE-containing liposomes in HEK293T cells.

Abstract: In eukaryotic organisms, two unrelated acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) enzymes, DGAT1 and DGAT2, catalyze the final step of the triacylglycerol biosynthetic pathway. Both enzymes are highly expressed in lipogenic tissues, such as adipose tissue, small intestine and the liver. DGAT2 has a prominent role in hepatocyte lipid metabolism synthesizing triacylglycerols that are utilized for very low-density lipoprotein assembly. However, due to the lack of useful antibodies to detect endogenous DGAT2 protein, it has been difficult to determine how this enzyme functions at the cellular level. We have unsuccessfully tested many commercial antibodies as well as our own “in-house” antibodies. There is currently no evidence that DGAT2 undergoes processing such that antigenic epitopes to these antibodies are removed. As an alternative, many studies have utilized epitope tagged versions of DGAT2 overexpressed in cells. These approaches can provide valuable information about a protein, but can be subject to artifacts, such as mislocalization, misregulation, protein aggregation and abnormal protein-protein interactions. In this study, we used gene editing with CRISPR/Cas9 to add three consecutive FLAG epitopes to the C-terminus of endogenous DGAT2 in HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells, derived from a human hepatocellular carcinoma, have been routinely used as a cell model to study human hepatocyte lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. Using this system allowed us to successfully detect DGAT2 expressed from its endogenous locus in HepG2 cells by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibodies.

Abstract: Thermogenesis (non-exercise activity) in brown adipose tissue (BAT) promotes energy expenditure because of its higher number of mitochondria than white adipose tissue (WAT). The main function of thermogenesis in BAT can counteract obesity through the dissipation of calories as heat. N-butylidenephthalide (BP) is a natural derivative from Angelica sinensis, a Chinese herb that has been used for thousands of years. In this report, we demonstrated that BP improved the metabolic profiles of mice with high fat diet-induced obesity (DIO) by preventing weight gain, improving serum blood parameters, enhancing energy expenditure, stimulating white fat browning, and reversing hepatic steatosis. Further investigations demonstrated that BP administration upregulated the mRNA expression of beige (CD137, TMEM26) and brown fat selected genes (UCP1, PRDM16, PGC-1α, PPARγ) in white adipose tissues. In vitro studies, BP treatment increased multilocular lipid droplet levels, induced β-adrenergic receptor (cAMP/PKA) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling (AMPK/acetyl-CoA carboxylase/SIRT1), and increased oxygen consumption in murine differentiated beige adipocytes, and the effects of BP were blocked by an AMPK inhibitor. BP promoted the interaction of AMPK with PGC-1α in beige adipocytes. Our findings provide novel insights into the application of BP in regulating energy metabolism and suggest its utility for clinical use in the treatment of obesity and related diseases.

Abstract: The structural challenges faced by eukaryotic cells through the cell cycle are key for understanding cell viability and proliferation. We tested the hypothesis that the biosynthesis of structural lipids is linked to the cell cycle. If true, this would suggest that the cell's structure is important for progress through and perhaps even control of the cell cycle. Lipidomics (31P NMR and MS), proteomics (Western immunoblotting) and transcriptomics (RT-qPCR) techniques were used to profile the lipid fraction and characterise aspects of its metabolism at seven stages of the cell cycle of the model eukaryote, Desmodesmus quadricauda. We found considerable, transient increases in the abundance of phosphatidylethanolamine during the G1 phase (+35%, ethanolamine phosphate cytidylyltransferase increased 2·5×) and phosphatidylglycerol (+100%, phosphatidylglycerol synthase increased 22×) over the G1/pre-replication phase boundary. The relative abundance of phosphatidylcholine fell by ~35% during the G1. N-Methyl transferases for the conversion of phosphatidylethanolamine into phosphatidylcholine were not found in the de novo transcriptome profile, though a choline phosphate transferase was found, suggesting that the Kennedy pathway is the principal route for the synthesis of PC. The fatty acid profiles of the four most abundant lipids suggested that these lipids were not generally converted between one another. This study shows for the first time that there are considerable changes in the biosynthesis of the three most abundant phospholipid classes in the normal cell cycle of D. quadricauda, by margins large enough to elicit changes to the physical properties of membranes.

Abstract: In the liver, contact sites between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria (named MAMs) may be crucial hubs for the regulation of lipid metabolism, thus contributing to the exacerbation or prevention of fatty liver. We hypothesized that tether proteins located at MAMs could play a key role in preventing triglyceride accumulation in hepatocytes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) occurrence. To test this, we explored the role of two key partners in building MAM integrity and functionality, the glucose-regulated protein 75 (Grp75) and mitofusin 2 (Mfn2), which liver contents are altered in obesity and NAFLD. Grp75 or Mfn2 expression was either silenced using siRNA or overexpressed with adenoviruses in Huh7 cells. Silencing of Grp75 and Mfn2 resulted in decreased ER-mitochondria interactions, mitochondrial network fusion state and mitochondrial oxidative capacity, while overexpression of the two proteins induced mirror impacts on these parameters. Furthermore, Grp75 or Mfn2 silencing decreased cellular cholesterol content and enhanced triglyceride secretion in ApoB100 lipoproteins, while their overexpression led to reverse effects. Cellular phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylethanolamine ratio was decreased only upon overexpression of the proteins, potentially contributing to altered ApoB100 assembly and secretion. Despite the opposite differences, both silencing and overexpression of Grp75 or Mfn2 induced triglyceride storage, although a fatty acid challenge was required to express the alteration upon protein silencing. Among the mechanisms potentially involved in this phenotype, ER stress was closely associated with altered triglyceride metabolism after Grp75 or Mfn2 overexpression, while blunted mitochondrial FA oxidation capacity may be the main defect causing triglyceride accumulation upon Grp75 or Mfn2 silencing. Further studies are required to decipher the link between modulation of Grp75 or Mfn2 expression, change in MAM integrity and alteration of cholesterol content of the cell. In conclusion, Grp75 or Mfn2 silencing and overexpression in Huh7 cells contribute to altering MAM integrity and cholesterol storage in opposite directions, but all promote triglyceride accumulation through distinct cellular pathways. This study also highlights that besides Mfn2, Grp75 could play a central role in hepatic lipid and cholesterol metabolism in obesity and NAFLD.

Abstract: Collecting duct cells are physiologically subject to the hypertonic environment of the kidney. This condition is necessary for kidney maturation and function but represents a stress condition that requires active strategies to ensure epithelial integrity. Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells develop the differentiated phenotype of collecting duct cells when subject to hypertonicity, serving as a model to study epithelial preservation and homeostasis in this particular environment. The integrity of epithelia is essential to achieve the required functional barrier. One of the mechanisms that ensure integrity is cell extrusion, a process initiated by sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) to remove dying or surplus cells while maintaining the epithelium barrier. Both types start with the activation of S1P receptor type 2, located in neighboring cells. In this work, we studied the effect of cell differentiation induced by hypertonicity on cell extrusion in MDCK cells, and we provide new insights into the associated molecular mechanism. We found that the different stages of differentiation influence the rate of apoptotic cell extrusion. Besides, we used a novel methodology to demonstrate that S1P increase in extruding cells of differentiated monolayers. These results show for first time that cell extrusion is triggered by the single-cell synthesis of S1P by sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2), but not SphK1, of the extruding cell itself. Moreover, the inhibition or knockdown of SphK2 prevents cell extrusion and cell-cell junction protein degradation, but not apoptotic nuclear fragmentation. Thus, we propose SphK2 as the biochemical key to ensure the preservation of the epithelial barrier under hypertonic stress.

Abstract: SBF (Swi4/Swi6 Binding Factor) complex is a crucial regulator of G1/S transition in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, we show that SBF complex is required for myriocin resistance, an inhibitor of sphingolipid synthesis. This phenotype was not shared with MBF complex mutants nor with deletion of the Swi4p downstream targets, CLN1/CLN2. Based on data mining results, we selected putative Swi4p targets related to sphingolipid metabolism and studied their gene transcription as well as metabolite levels during progression of the cell cycle. Genes which encode key enzymes for the synthesis of long chain bases (LCBs) and ceramides were periodically transcribed during the mitotic cell cycle, having a peak at G1/S, and required SWI4 for full transcription at this stage. In addition, HPLC-MS/MS data indicated that swi4Δ cells have decreased levels of sphingolipids during progression of the cell cycle, particularly, dihydrosphingosine (DHS), C24-phytoceramides and C24-inositolphosphoryl ceramide (IPC) while it had increased levels of mannosylinositol phosphorylceramide (MIPC). Furthermore, we demonstrated that both inhibition of de novo sphingolipid synthesis by myriocin or SWI4 deletion caused partial arrest at the G2/M phase. Importantly, our lipidomic data demonstrated that the sphingolipid profile of WT cells treated with myriocin resembled that of swi4Δ cells, with lower levels of DHS, IPC and higher levels of MIPC. Taken together, these results show that SBF complex plays an essential role in the regulation of sphingolipid homeostasis, which reflects in the correct progression through the G2/M phase of the cell cycle.

Abstract: N-Arachidonoyl-ethanolamine (AEA) is an endocannabinoid (eCB) and endogenous lipid mimicking many of the effects of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, notably on brain functions, appetite, pain and inflammation. The eCBs and eCB-like compounds contain fatty acids, the main classes being the monoacylglycerols and the N-acyl-ethanolamines (NAEs). Thus, each long chain fatty acid likely exists under the form of a monoacylglycerol and NAE, as it is the case for arachidonic acid (AA) and linoleic acid (LA). Following their biosynthesis, AA and AEA can be further metabolized into additional eicosanoids, notably by the 15-lipoxygenase pathway. Thus, we postulated that NAEs possessing a 1Z,4Z-pentadiene motif, near their omega end, would be transformed into their 15-lipoxygenase metabolites. As a proof of concept, we investigated N-linoleoyl-ethanolamine (LAE). We successfully synthesized LEA and LEA-d4 as well as their 15-lipoxygenase-derived derivatives, namely 13-hydroxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoyl-N-ethanolamine (13-HODE-EA) and 13-HODE-EA-d4, using Novozyme 435 immobilized on acrylic resin and soybean lipoxygenase respectively. We also show that both human 15-lipoxygenase-1 and -2 can biosynthesize 13-HODE-EA. Co-incubation of LEA and LA with either human 15-lipoxygenase led to the biosynthesis of 13-HODE-EA and 13-HODE in a ratio equal to or greater than 3:1, indicating that LEA is preferred to LA by these enzymes. Finally, we show that 13-HODE-EA is found in human saliva and skin and is a weak although selective TRPV1 agonist. The full biological importance of 13-HODE-EA remains to be explored.

Abstract: Objective
The purpose of this study was to explore the role of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) in atherosclerosis and the underlying mechanism.
Methods
The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets were used to divide differentially expressed lncRNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs), and mRNAs. The expression of PCA3, miR-140-5p, RFX7 and ABCA1 were determined by qPCR or Western blot in ox-LDL-treated macrophages. Macrophage lipid accumulation s was evaluated using the Oil Red O staining and high-performance liquid chromatography. Target relationships among PCA3, miR-140-5p, RFX7, and ABCA1 promoter area were validated via dual-luciferase reporter gene assay or chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. The apoE−/− mouse model in vivo was designed to evaluate the effect of PCA3 on the reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) and atherosclerosis.
Results
PCA3 was down-regulated in foam cells, whereas miR-140-5p was highly expressed. Overexpression of PCA3 promoted ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux and reduced lipid accumulation in macrophages. Besides, RFX7 bound to the ABCA1 promoter and increased ABCA1 expression. Targeted relationships and interactions on the expression between miR-140-5p and PCA3 or RFX7 were elucidated. PCA3 up-regulated ABCA1 expression by binding to miR-140-5p to up-regulate RFX7 and ABCA1 expression in macrophages. PCA3 promoted RCT and impeded the progression of atherosclerosis by sponging miR-140-5p in apoE−/− mice. Meanwhile, miR-140-5p also inhibit ABCA1 expression via downregulation of RFX7 to impede RCT and aggravate atherosclerosis.
Conclusions
lncRNA PCA3 promotes ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux to inhibit atherosclerosis through sponging miR-140-5p and up-regulating RFX7.

Abstract: Plant lipid transfer proteins are a large family that can be found in all land plants. They have a hydrophobic cavity that allows them to harbor lipids and facilitates their traffic between membranes. However, in humans, this plant protein family is responsible for the main food allergies in the Mediterranean area. Nevertheless, not only the protein itself but also its ligand is relevant for allergic sensitization. The main aim of the present work is to analyse the natural ligands carried by four allergenic LTPs (Tri a 14, Art v 3, Par j 2, and Ole e 7), compared with the previously identified ligand of Pru p 3 (CPT-PHS ligand), and clarify their role within the immunological reactions. Results showed that the ligands of the LTPs studied shared a chemical identity, in which the presence of a polar head was essential to the protein-ligand binding. This ligand was transported through a skin cellular model, and phosphorylated phytosphingosine could be detected as result of cell metabolism. Since sphingosine kinase 1 was overexpressed in keratinocytes incubated with the LTP-ligand complex, this enzyme might be responsible for the phosphorylation of the phytosphingosine fraction of the CPT-PHS ligand. This way, phytosphingosine-1-phosphate could be mimicking the role of the human inflammatory mediator sphingosine-1-phosphate, explaining why LTPs are associated with more severe allergic responses. In conclusion, this work contributes to the understanding of the chemical nature and behavior of lipid ligands carried by allergens, which would help to gain insight into their role during allergic sensitization.

Vasodilation and blood pressure-lowering effect mediated by 5,6-EEQ lactone in 5/6 nephrectomy hypertensive rats,

Abstract: Microvascular dysfunction is a key contributor to vascular hypertension, one of the most common chronic diseases in the world. Microvascular dysfunction leads to the loss of nitric oxide-mediated endothelial dilation and the subsequent compensatory function of endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing (EDH) factors in the regulation of vascular tone. Previously, we showed that lactone metabolite derived from arachidonic acid induces endothelial-dependent vasodilation in isolated human microvessels. Based on structural similarities, we hypothesize that additional lactone metabolites formed from eicosapentaenoic fatty acid (EPA) may bear EDH properties.
Aim
To elucidate the vasodilatory and blood pressure (BP)-reducing characteristics of the 5,6-EEQ (5,6-epoxyeicosatetraenoic acids) lactone (EPA-L) in hypertensive 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6Nx) rats.
Methods
5/6Nx hypertensive rats intravenously administrated with EPA-L for five days. BP, blood and urine chemistry, and kidney function were detected and analyzed. Vascular dilation was detected using a pressure myograph with or without Ca2+ − activated K+ (KCa) endothelial channel inhibitors. KCNN3 and KCNN4 gene expression (mRNA) detected in mesenteric arteries from 5/6Nx and NT rats.
Results
EPA-L administration to 5/6Nx rats significantly (p < 0.05) reduced BP and heart rate without affecting kidney function. 5/6Nx rat mesenteric arterioles exhibited a lower dilation response to acetylcholine (10-7 mol/l) than normotensive (NT) vessels, while EPA-L administration restored the vessel relaxation response. The EPA-L-driven relaxation of mesenteric arteries was significantly reduced by pretreatment with TRAM-34 and apamin. However, KCa channel expression did not significantly differ between 5/6Nx and NT mesenteric arteries.
Conclusion
EPA-L reduces BP by improving microvessel dilation involving calcium-dependent potassium endothelial channels.

Abstract: Background and aims
Whether there is a gender difference in the impact of elevated plasma Lp(a) levels on recurrent coronary events remains unclear. We, therefore, evaluated the association between Lp(a) levels and the occurrence of major adverse coronary events in a large series of coronary patients (32% women).
Methods
This single-center prospective cohort study investigated 3034 consecutive patients admitted to the Coronary Care Unit with a diagnosis of coronary ischemia. According to the inclusion criteria, 2374 patients completed the follow-up (mean of 2 years). The end-points were non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), revascularization and coronary deaths.
Results
Elevated Lp(a) levels were significantly associated with rate of revascularization, but not with non-fatal MI and cardiac death. According to Lp(a) stratification (≤30 mg/dl, >30–50 mg/dl and ≥50 mg/dl), there was a significant rise of revascularization events in the whole sample of participants, with a trend in hazard ratio (HR) of 1.23 (95% CI 1.04–1.46) and a 6% rise for every 10 mg/dl increment in Lp(a) levels. This effect was mainly driven by women (HR 2.04, 95%CI 1.33–3.12) who showed a 14% incremental risk for every 10 mg/dl rise in Lp(a) levels.
Conclusions
In patients with coronary artery disease, elevated plasma Lp(a) levels were found to be a potentially useful predictor of the need for coronary revascularizations, especially in women.
