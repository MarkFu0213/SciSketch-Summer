Abstract: Summary
Recent successes in tumor immunotherapies have highlighted the importance of tumor immunity. However, most of the work conducted to date has been on T cell immunity, while the role of B cell immunity in cancer remains more elusive. In this study, immunogenetic repertoire profiling for tumor-infiltrating B and T cells in gastric cancers was carried out to help reveal the architecture of B cell immunity in cancer. Humoral immunity in cancer was shown to involve oligoclonal expansions of tumor-specific and private B cell repertoires. We find that B cell repertoires in cancer are shaped by somatic hypermutation (SHM) either with or without positive selection biases, the latter of which tended to be auto-reactive. Importantly, we identified sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) as major functional B cell antigens among gastric tumors. Furthermore, natural anti-sulfated GAG antibodies discovered in gastric cancer tissues showed robust growth-suppressive functions against a wide variety of human malignancies of various organs.

Abstract: Summary
Despite numerous observations linking protracted exposure to low-dose (LD) radiation and leukemia occurrence, the effects of LD irradiation on hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) remain poorly documented. Here, we show that adult HSCs are hypersensitive to LD irradiation. This hyper-radiosensitivity is dependent on an immediate increase in the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that also promotes autophagy and activation of the Keap1/Nrf2 antioxidant pathway. Nrf2 activation initially protects HSCs from the detrimental effects of ROS, but protection is transient, and increased ROS levels return, promoting a long-term decrease in HSC self-renewal. In vivo, LD total body irradiation (TBI) does not decrease HSC numbers unless the HSC microenvironment is altered by an inflammatory insult. Paradoxically, such an insult, in the form of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) preconditioning, followed by LD-TBI facilitates efficient bone marrow transplantation without myeloablation. Thus, LD irradiation has long-term detrimental effects on HSCs that may result in hematological malignancies, but LD-TBI may open avenues to facilitate autologous bone marrow transplantation.

Abstract: Summary
Targeted cancer therapies that use genetics are successful, but principles for selectively targeting tumor metabolism that is also dependent on the environment remain unknown. We now show that differences in rate-controlling enzymes during the Warburg effect (WE), the most prominent hallmark of cancer cell metabolism, can be used to predict a response to targeting glucose metabolism. We establish a natural product, koningic acid (KA), to be a selective inhibitor of GAPDH, an enzyme we characterize to have differential control properties over metabolism during the WE. With machine learning and integrated pharmacogenomics and metabolomics, we demonstrate that KA efficacy is not determined by the status of individual genes, but by the quantitative extent of the WE, leading to a therapeutic window in vivo. Thus, the basis of targeting the WE can be encoded by molecular principles that extend beyond the status of individual genes.

Abstract: Summary
Proper brain function requires a substantial energy supply, up to 20% of whole-body energy in humans, and brain activation produces large dynamic variations in energy demand. While local increases in cerebral blood flow are well known, the cellular responses to energy demand are controversial. During brain excitation, glycolysis of glucose to lactate temporarily exceeds the rate of mitochondrial fuel oxidation; although the increased energy demand occurs mainly within neurons, some have suggested this glycolysis occurs mainly in astrocytes, which then shuttle lactate to neurons as their primary fuel. Using metabolic biosensors in acute hippocampal slices and brains of awake mice, we find that neuronal metabolic responses to stimulation do not depend on astrocytic stimulation by glutamate release, nor do they require neuronal uptake of lactate; instead they reflect increased direct glucose consumption by neurons. Neuronal glycolysis temporarily outstrips oxidative metabolism, and provides a rapid response to increased energy demand.

Abstract: Summary
The RNAi pathway provides both innate immunity and efficient gene-knockdown tools in many eukaryotic species, but curiously not in zebrafish. We discovered that RNAi is less effective in zebrafish at least partly because Argonaute2-catalyzed mRNA slicing is impaired. This defect is due to two mutations that arose in an ancestor of most teleost fish, implying that most fish lack effective RNAi. Despite lacking efficient slicing activity, these fish have retained the ability to produce miR-451, a microRNA generated by a cleavage reaction analogous to slicing. This ability is due to a G–G mismatch within the fish miR-451 precursor, which substantially enhances its cleavage. An analogous G–G mismatch (or sometimes also a G–A mismatch) enhances target slicing, despite disrupting seed pairing important for target binding. These results provide a strategy for restoring RNAi to zebrafish and reveal unanticipated opposing effects of a seed mismatch with implications for mechanism and guide-RNA design.

Abstract: Summary
Many eukaryotic genes generate linear mRNAs and circular RNAs, but it is largely unknown how the ratio of linear to circular RNA is controlled or modulated. Using RNAi screening in Drosophila cells, we identify many core spliceosome and transcription termination factors that control the RNA outputs of reporter and endogenous genes. When spliceosome components were depleted or inhibited pharmacologically, the steady-state levels of circular RNAs increased while expression of their associated linear mRNAs concomitantly decreased. Upon inhibiting RNA polymerase II termination via depletion of the cleavage/polyadenylation machinery, circular RNA levels were similarly increased. This is because readthrough transcripts now extend into downstream genes and are subjected to backsplicing. In total, these results demonstrate that inhibition or slowing of canonical pre-mRNA processing events shifts the steady-state output of protein-coding genes toward circular RNAs. This is in part because nascent RNAs become directed into alternative pathways that lead to circular RNA production.

Abstract: Summary
Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, whose products form a critical inhibitor of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). Loss of TSC1/2 gene function renders an mTOR-overactivated state. Clinically, TSC manifests with epilepsy, intellectual disability, autism, and sleep dysfunction. Here, we report that mouse models of TSC have abnormal circadian rhythms. We show that mTOR regulates the proteostasis of the core clock protein BMAL1, affecting its translation, degradation, and subcellular localization. This results in elevated levels of BMAL1 and a dysfunctional clock that displays abnormal timekeeping under constant conditions and exaggerated responses to phase resetting. Genetically lowering the dose of BMAL1 rescues circadian behavioral phenotypes in TSC mouse models. These findings indicate that BMAL1 deregulation is a feature of the mTOR-activated state and suggest a molecular mechanism for mitigating circadian phenotypes in a neurodevelopmental disorder.

Abstract: Summary
Aversive stimuli can impact motivation and support associative learning as reinforcers. However, the neural circuitry underlying the processing of aversive reinforcers has not been elucidated. Here, we report that a subpopulation of central amygdala (CeA) GABAergic neurons expressing protein kinase C-delta (PKC-δ+) displays robust responses to aversive stimuli during negative reinforcement learning. Importantly, projections from PKC-δ+ neurons of the CeA to the substantia innominata (SI) could bi-directionally modulate negative reinforcement learning. Moreover, consistent with the idea that SI-projecting PKC-δ+ neurons of the CeA encode aversive information, optogenetic activation of this pathway produces conditioned place aversion, a behavior prevented by simultaneous ablating of SI glutamatergic neurons. Taken together, our data define a cell-type-specific neural circuitry modulating associative learning by encoding aversive reinforcement signals.

Abstract: Summary
The archetypal T cell-dependent antigen is sheep red blood cells (SRBCs), which have defined much of what we know about humoral immunity. Early studies using solubilized or sonicated SRBCs argued that the intact structure of SRBCs was important for optimal antibody responses. However, the reason for the requirement of intact SRBCs for the response to polyvalent protein antigen remained unknown. Here, we report that the immune response to SRBCs is driven by cytosolic recognition of SRBC RNA through the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR)-mitochondrial anti-viral signaling adaptor (MAVS) pathway. Following the uptake of SRBCs by antigen-presenting cells, the MAVS signaling complex governs the differentiation of both T follicular cells and antibody-producing B cells. Importantly, the involvement of the RLR-MAVS pathway precedes that of endosomal Toll-like receptor pathways, yet both are required for optimal effect.

Abstract: Summary
There exist similarities and differences in metabolism and physiology between normal proliferative cells and tumor cells. Once a cell enters the cell cycle, metabolic machinery is engaged to facilitate various processes. The kinetics and regulation of these metabolic changes have not been properly evaluated. To correlate the orchestration of these processes with the cell cycle, we analyzed the transition from quiescence to proliferation of a non-malignant murine pro-B lymphocyte cell line in response to IL-3. Using multiplex mass-spectrometry-based proteomics, we show that the transition to proliferation shares features generally attributed to cancer cells: upregulation of glycolysis, lipid metabolism, amino-acid synthesis, and nucleotide synthesis and downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation and the urea cycle. Furthermore, metabolomic profiling of this transition reveals similarities to cancer-related metabolic pathways. In particular, we find that methionine is consumed at a higher rate than that of other essential amino acids, with a potential link to maintenance of the epigenome.

Abstract: Summary
Therapy of advanced melanoma is changing dramatically. Following mutational and biological subclassification of this heterogeneous cancer, several targeted and immune therapies were approved and increased survival significantly. To facilitate further advancements through pre-clinical in vivo modeling, we have established 459 patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and live tissue samples from 384 patients representing the full spectrum of clinical, therapeutic, mutational, and biological heterogeneity of melanoma. PDX have been characterized using targeted sequencing and protein arrays and are clinically annotated. This exhaustive live tissue resource includes PDX from 57 samples resistant to targeted therapy, 61 samples from responders and non-responders to immune checkpoint blockade, and 31 samples from brain metastasis. Uveal, mucosal, and acral subtypes are represented as well. We show examples of pre-clinical trials that highlight how the PDX collection can be used to develop and optimize precision therapies, biomarkers of response, and the targeting of rare genetic subgroups.

Abstract: Summary
The oncogenic AKT kinase is a key regulator of apoptosis, cell growth, and cell-cycle progression. Despite its important role in proliferation, it remains largely unknown how AKT is mechanistically linked to the cell cycle. We show here that cyclin F, a substrate receptor F-box protein for the SCF (Skp1/Cul1/F-box) family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, is a bona fide AKT substrate. Cyclin F expression oscillates throughout the cell cycle, a rare feature among the 69 human F-box proteins, and all of its known substrates are involved in proliferation. AKT phosphorylation of cyclin F enhances its stability and promotes assembly into productive E3 ligase complexes. Importantly, expression of mutant versions of cyclin F that cannot be phosphorylated by AKT impair cell-cycle entry. Our data suggest that cyclin F transmits mitogen signaling through AKT to the core cell-cycle machinery. This discovery has potential implications for proliferative control in malignancies where AKT is activated.

Abstract: Summary
Peripheral nerve regeneration after injury requires a broad program of transcriptional changes. We investigated the basis for the enhanced nerve regenerative capacity of the CAST/Ei mouse strain relative to C57BL/6 mice. RNA sequencing of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) showed a CAST/Ei-specific upregulation of Ascl1 after injury. Ascl1 overexpression in DRG neurons of C57BL/6 mice enhanced their neurite outgrowth. Ascl1 is regulated by miR-7048-3p, which is downregulated in CAST/Ei mice. Inhibition of miR-7048-3p enhances neurite outgrowth. Following injury, CAST/Ei neurons largely retained their mature neuronal profile as determined by single-cell RNA- seq, whereas the C57BL/6 neurons acquired an immature profile. These findings suggest that one facet of the enhanced regenerative phenotype is preservation of neuronal identity in response to injury.

Abstract: Summary
The use of sensory information to drive specific behaviors relies on circuits spanning long distances that wire up through a range of axon-target recognition events. Mechanisms assembling poly-synaptic circuits and the extent to which parallel pathways can “cross-wire” to compensate for loss of one another remain unclear and are crucial to our understanding of brain development and models of regeneration. In the visual system, specific retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) project to designated midbrain targets connected to downstream circuits driving visuomotor reflexes. Here, we deleted RGCs connecting to pupillary light reflex (PLR) midbrain targets and discovered that axon-target matching is tightly regulated. RGC axons of the eye-reflex pathway avoided vacated PLR targets. Moreover, downstream PLR circuitry is maintained; hindbrain and peripheral components retained their proper connectivity and function. These findings point to a model in which poly-synaptic circuit development reflects independent, highly stringent wiring of each parallel pathway and downstream station.

Abstract: Summary
Nucleosomes are disrupted during transcription and other active processes, but the structural intermediates during nucleosome disruption in vivo are unknown. To identify intermediates, we mapped subnucleosomal protections in Drosophila cells using Micrococcal Nuclease followed by sequencing. At the first nucleosome position downstream of the transcription start site, we identified unwrapped intermediates, including hexasomes that lack either proximal or distal contacts. Inhibiting topoisomerases or depleting histone chaperones increased unwrapping, whereas inhibiting release of paused RNAPII or reducing RNAPII elongation decreased unwrapping. Our results indicate that positive torsion generated by elongating RNAPII causes transient loss of histone-DNA contacts. Using this mapping approach, we found that nucleosomes flanking human CTCF insulation sites are similarly disrupted. We also identified diagnostic subnucleosomal particle remnants in cell-free human DNA data as a relic of transcribed genes from apoptosing cells. Thus identification of subnucleosomal fragments from nuclease protection data represents a general strategy for structural epigenomics.

Abstract: Summary
It is well established that mRNAs encoding secretory or membrane-bound proteins are translated on the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The extent to which mRNAs that encode cytosolic proteins associate with the ER, however, remains controversial. To address this question, we quantified the number of cytosolic protein-encoding mRNAs that co-localize with the ER using single-molecule RNA imaging in fixed and living cells. We found that a small but significant number of mRNAs that encode cytosolic proteins associate with the ER and show that this interaction is translation dependent. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cytosolic protein-encoding transcripts can remain on the ER with dwell times consistent with multiple rounds of translation and have higher ribosome occupancies than transcripts translated in the cytosol. These results advance our understanding of the diversity and dynamics of localized translation on the ER.

Abstract: Summary
Antisense RNAs are non-coding RNAs that can regulate their corresponding sense RNAs and are generally produced from specific promoters. We uncover here a family of antisense RNAs, named START RNAs, produced during cellular senescence by transcriptional read-through at convergent protein-coding genes. Importantly, START RNAs repress the expression of their corresponding sense RNAs. In proliferative cells, we found that the Pol II elongation rate is limited downstream of TTS at START loci, allowing transcription termination to occur before Pol II reaches the convergent genes, thus preventing antisense RNA production and interference with the expression of the convergent genes. START RNAs are repressed by H2A.Z histone variant, whose local occupancy decreases in senescence. Our results thus uncover a mechanism of gene expression regulation relying on read-through antisense transcript production at convergent genes, underlining the functional importance of chromatin regulation in the control of RNA pol II elongation rate at intergenic regions.

Abstract: Summary
The bacterial and plant stringent response involves production of the signaling molecules guanosine tetraphosphate and guanosine pentaphosphate ((p)ppGpp), leading to global reorganization of gene expression. The function of the stringent response has been well characterized in stress conditions, but its regulatory role during unstressed growth is less studied. Here, we demonstrate that (p)ppGpp-deficient strains of S. elongatus have globally deregulated biosynthetic capacity, with increased transcription rate, translation rate, and cell size in unstressed conditions in light and impaired viability in darkness. Synthetic restoration of basal guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp) levels is sufficient to recover transcriptional balance and appropriate cell size in light and to rescue viability in light/dark conditions, but it is insufficient to enable efficient dark-induced transcriptional shutdown. Our work underscores the importance of basal ppGpp signaling for regulation of cyanobacterial physiology in the absence of stress and for viability in energy-limiting conditions, highlighting that basal (p)ppGpp level is essential in cyanobacteria in the environmental light/dark cycle.

Abstract: Summary
Although much progress has been made in understanding type II theta rhythm generation under urethane anesthesia, less is known about the mechanisms underlying type I theta generation during active exploration. To better understand the contributions of cholinergic and NMDA receptor activation to type I theta generation, we recorded hippocampal theta oscillations from freely moving mice with local infusion of cholinergic or NMDA receptor antagonists to either the hippocampus or the entorhinal cortex (EC). We found that cholinergic receptors in the hippocampus, but not the EC, and NMDA receptors in the EC, but not the hippocampus, are critical for open-field theta generation and Y-maze performance. We further found that muscarinic M1 receptors located on pyramidal neurons, but not interneurons, are critical for cholinergic modulation of hippocampal synapses, theta generation, and Y-maze performance. These results suggest that hippocampus and EC neurons recruit cholinergic-dependent and NMDA-receptor-dependent mechanisms, respectively, to generate theta oscillations to support behavioral performance.

Abstract: Summary
Bacteria use type VI secretion systems (T6SSs) to manipulate host cells during pathogenesis or to kill competing bacteria, which, in some cases, increases horizontal gene transfer. These functions largely depend on T6SS regulation, dynamics, and the set of effectors that the system delivers into the target cells. Here, we show that Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 assembles a highly dynamic T6SS capable of killing and lysing bacterial cells. T6SS function depends on conserved T6SS components as well as Acinetobacter-specific genes of unknown function. Five different effectors, encoded next to VgrG or PAAR proteins and their cognate immunity proteins, cause distinct changes in the prey cells, resulting in various degrees of their lysis. Prey lysis correlates with the rate of DNA transfer from prey to predator, suggesting that lytic effectors are required for efficient T6SS-dependent horizontal gene transfer in naturally competent bacteria.

Abstract: Cardiomyocyte apoptosis is initiated by various cellular insults and accumulated cardiomyocyte apoptosis leads to the pathogenesis of heart failure. Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) provoke apoptotic cascades. Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) is an important antioxidant enzyme that converts cellular ROS into harmless products. In this study, we demonstrate that MnSOD is down-regulated upon hydrogen peroxide treatment or ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Enhanced expression of MnSOD attenuates cardiomyocyte apoptosis and myocardial infarction induced by I/R injury. Further, we show that miR-23a directly regulates the expression of MnSOD. miR-23a regulates cardiomyocyte apoptosis by suppressing the expression of MnSOD. Our study reveals a novel model regulating cardiomyocyte apoptosis which is composed of miR-23a and MnSOD. Our study provides a new method to tackling apoptosis related cardiac diseases.

Abstract: The brainstem locus coeruleus (LC), the primary norepinephrinergic (NE) nucleus in the brain, has been implicated in the abuse of drugs such as opioids. However, whether and how the LC-NE system is involved in cocaine addiction remains elusive. Here, we demonstrated cocaine-evoked synaptic plasticity of glutamatergic transmission onto LC neurons as one of the earliest traces occurring after a single injection of cocaine. Twenty-four hours after mice were injected intraperitoneally with cocaine, the evoked α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) mediated synaptic transmission onto LC neurons were strongly potentiated without major effect on N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) mediated synaptic transmission. Compared with saline-pretreated mice, AMPAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) of cocaine-pretreated mice showed a marked inward rectification, demonstrating the insertion of GluR2-lacking AMPARs to plasma membrane. In addition, the single injection of cocaine did not affect presynaptic glutamate release probability measured by paired pulse ratio. Furthermore, we found that the cocaine-induced potentiation of AMPAR EPSCs could be blocked by prazosin, an inhibitor of α1-adrenoreceptor (AR), indicating that cocaine increases AMPAR transmission via α1-ARs. These results reveal that LC-NE serves as an initial target of drug intake.

Abstract: Summary
The transcription factor hepatic leukemia factor (HLF) is strongly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and is thought to influence both HSC self-renewal and leukemogenesis. However, the physiological role of HLF in hematopoiesis and HSC function is unclear. Here, we report that mice lacking Hlf are viable with essentially normal hematopoietic parameters, including an intact HSC pool during steady-state hematopoiesis. In contrast, when challenged through transplantation, Hlf-deficient HSCs showed an impaired ability to reconstitute hematopoiesis and became gradually exhausted upon serial transplantation. Transcriptional profiling of Hlf-deficient HSCs revealed changes associated with enhanced cellular activation, and cell-cycle analysis demonstrated a significant reduction of quiescent HSCs. Accordingly, toxic insults targeting dividing cells completely eradicated the HSC pool in Hlf-deficient mice. In summary, our findings point to HLF as a critical regulator of HSC quiescence and as an essential factor for maintaining the HSC pool during regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Piezo2 is a mechanically activated ion channel required for touch discrimination, vibration detection, and proprioception. Here, we discovered that Piezo2 is extensively spliced, producing different Piezo2 isoforms with distinct properties. Sensory neurons from both mice and humans express a large repertoire of Piezo2 variants, whereas non-neuronal tissues express predominantly a single isoform. Notably, even within sensory ganglia, we demonstrate the splicing of Piezo2 to be cell type specific. Biophysical characterization revealed substantial differences in ion permeability, sensitivity to calcium modulation, and inactivation kinetics among Piezo2 splice variants. Together, our results describe, at the molecular level, a potential mechanism by which transduction is tuned, permitting the detection of a variety of mechanosensory stimuli.

Abstract: Summary
The spleen plays an important role in protective immunity to bloodborne pathogens. Macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) in the spleen marginal zone capture microbial antigens to trigger adaptive immune responses. Marginal zone macrophages (MZMs) can also act as a replicative niche for intracellular pathogens, providing a platform for mounting the immune response. Here, we describe a role for RANK in the coordinated function of antigen-presenting cells in the spleen marginal zone and triggering anti-viral immunity. Targeted deletion of RANK results in the selective loss of CD169+ MZMs, which provide a niche for viral replication, while RANK signaling in DCs promotes the recruitment and activation of anti-viral memory CD8 T cells. These studies reveal a role for the RANKL/RANK signaling axis in the orchestration of protective immune responses in the spleen marginal zone that has important implications for the host response to viral infection and induction of acquired immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) induce the formation of lipids in neurons that are transferred to glia, where they form lipid droplets (LDs). We show that glial and neuronal monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), fatty acid transport proteins (FATPs), and apolipoproteins are critical for glial LD formation. MCTs enable glia to secrete and neurons to absorb lactate, which is converted to pyruvate and acetyl-CoA in neurons. Lactate metabolites provide a substrate for synthesis of fatty acids, which are processed and transferred to glia by FATP and apolipoproteins. In the presence of high ROS, inhibiting lactate transfer or lowering FATP or apolipoprotein levels decreases glial LD accumulation in flies and in primary mouse glial-neuronal cultures. We show that human APOE can substitute for a fly glial apolipoprotein and that APOE4, an Alzheimer’s disease susceptibility allele, is impaired in lipid transport and promotes neurodegeneration, providing insights into disease mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
Gene expression levels are important quantitative traits that link genotypes to molecular functions and fitness. In Drosophila, population-genetic studies have revealed substantial adaptive evolution at the genomic level, but the evolutionary modes of gene expression remain controversial. Here, we present evidence that adaptation dominates the evolution of gene expression levels in flies. We show that 64% of the observed expression divergence across seven Drosophila species are adaptive changes driven by directional selection. Our results are derived from time-resolved data of gene expression divergence across a family of related species, using a probabilistic inference method for gene-specific selection. Adaptive gene expression is stronger in specific functional classes, including regulation, sensory perception, sexual behavior, and morphology. Moreover, we identify a large group of genes with sex-specific adaptation of expression, which predominantly occurs in males. Our analysis opens an avenue to map system-wide selection on molecular quantitative traits independently of their genetic basis.

Abstract: Summary
Cognitive dysfunction and decreased mobility from aging and neurodegenerative conditions, such as Parkinson and Alzheimer diseases, are major biomedical challenges in need of more effective therapies. Increasing brain resilience may represent a new treatment strategy. Klotho, a longevity factor, enhances cognition when genetically and broadly overexpressed in its full, wild-type form over the mouse lifespan. Whether acute klotho treatment can rapidly enhance cognitive and motor functions or induce resilience is a gap in our knowledge of its therapeutic potential. Here, we show that an α-klotho protein fragment (αKL-F), administered peripherally, surprisingly induced cognitive enhancement and neural resilience despite impermeability to the blood-brain barrier in young, aging, and transgenic α-synuclein mice. αKL-F treatment induced cleavage of the NMDAR subunit GluN2B and also enhanced NMDAR-dependent synaptic plasticity. GluN2B blockade abolished αKL-F-mediated effects. Peripheral αKL-F treatment is sufficient to induce neural enhancement and resilience in mice and may prove therapeutic in humans.

Abstract: Summary
Both transcriptional regulation and signaling pathways play crucial roles in neuronal differentiation and plasticity. Caenorhabditis elegans possesses 19 GABAergic motor neurons (MNs) called D MNs, which are divided into two subgroups: DD and VD. DD, but not VD, MNs reverse their cellular polarity in a developmental process called respecification. UNC-30 and UNC-55 are two critical transcription factors in D MNs. By using chromatin immunoprecipitation with CRISPR/Cas9 knockin of GFP fusion, we uncovered the global targets of UNC-30 and UNC-55. UNC-30 and UNC-55 are largely converged to regulate over 1,300 noncoding and coding genes, and genes in multiple biological processes, including cAMP metabolism, are co-regulated. Increase in cAMP levels may serve as a timing signal for respecification, whereas UNC-55 regulates genes such as pde-4 to keep the cAMP levels low in VD. Other genes modulating DD respecification such as lin-14, irx-1, and oig-1 are also found to affect cAMP levels.

Abstract: Summary
Regulatory T (Treg) cell infiltration constitutes a prominent feature of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). However, the immunomodulatory function of Treg cells in PDA is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that Treg cell ablation is sufficient to evoke effective anti-tumor immune response in early and advanced pancreatic tumorigenesis in mice. This response is dependent on interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-producing cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. We show that Treg cells engage in extended interactions with tumor-associated CD11c+ dendritic cells (DCs) and restrain their immunogenic function by suppressing the expression of costimulatory ligands necessary for CD8+ T cell activation. Consequently, tumor-associated CD8+ T cells fail to display effector activities when Treg cell ablation is combined with DC depletion. We propose that tumor-infiltrating Treg cells can promote immune tolerance by suppressing tumor-associated DC immunogenicity. The therapeutic manipulation of this axis might provide an effective approach for the targeting of PDA.

Abstract: Summary
Although dendritic cells are among the human cell population best equipped for cell-intrinsic antiviral immune defense, they seem highly susceptible to infection with the Zika virus (ZIKV). Using highly purified myeloid dendritic cells isolated from individuals with naturally acquired acute infection, we here show that ZIKV induces profound perturbations of transcriptional signatures relative to healthy donors. Interestingly, we noted a remarkable downregulation of antiviral interferon-stimulated genes and innate immune sensors, suggesting that ZIKV can actively suppress interferon-dependent immune responses. In contrast, several host factors known to support ZIKV infection were strongly upregulated during natural ZIKV infection; these transcripts included AXL, the main entry receptor for ZIKV; SOCS3, a negative regulator of ISG expression; and IDO-1, a recognized inducer of regulatory T cell responses. Thus, during in vivo infection, ZIKV can transform the transcriptome of dendritic cells in favor of the virus to render these cells highly conducive to ZIKV infection.

Abstract: The secretion of the goblet cells in the intestine of Trachemys scripta elegans was studied in situ by histochemical methods to analyze the diversity of sugar chains, with particular regard to the acidic glycans. Conventional histochemical stains (Periodic acid-Schiff, Alcian Blue pH 2.5, High Iron Diamine) and binding with ten FITC-labelled lectins combined with chemical and enzymatic pre-treatments were used to characterize the oligosaccharidic chains. The intestine can be divided into three regions, i.e. a duodenum, a small intestine and a large intestine. Goblet cells were observed in all the three tracts and presented an acidic secretion. WGA, LFA, PNA and SBA binding was observed only after desulfation. Glycans secreted by the three tracts consist mainly of sulfosialomucins with 1,2-linked fucose, mannosylated, glucosaminylated and subterminal galactosyl/galactosaminylated residuals. Differences among tracts are quantitative rather than qualitative, with sulfated, galactosaminylated and glycosaminylated residuals increasing from duodenum to large intestine, and galactosylated and fucosylated residuals showing an opposite trend. Variation is observed also between apices and bases of villi in both duodenum and small intestine, where sulphation decreases from the base to the apex and glycosylation shows an opposite trend. Functional implication of these findings is discussed in a comparative context.

Abstract: Summary
Cell migration is essential for morphogenesis, organ formation, and homeostasis, with relevance for clinical conditions. The migration of primordial germ cells (PGCs) is a useful model for studying this process in the context of the developing embryo. Zebrafish PGC migration depends on the formation of cellular protrusions in form of blebs, a type of protrusion found in various cell types. Here we report on the mechanisms allowing the inflation of the membrane during bleb formation. We show that the rapid expansion of the protrusion depends on membrane invaginations that are localized preferentially at the cell front. The formation of these invaginations requires the function of Cdc42, and their unfolding allows bleb inflation and dynamic cell-shape changes performed by migrating cells. Inhibiting the formation and release of the invaginations strongly interfered with bleb formation, cell motility, and the ability of the cells to reach their target.

Abstract: Summary
As a pivotal mitotic regulator, polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is under highly coordinated and multi-layered regulation. However, the pathways that control PLK1’s activity and function have just begun to be elucidated. PLK1 has recently been shown to be functionally modulated by post-translational modifications (PTMs), including phosphorylation and ubiquitination. Herein, we report that SUMOylation plays an essential role in regulating PLK1’s mitotic function. We found that Ubc9 was recruited to PLK1 upon initial phosphorylation and activation by CDK1/cyclin B. By in vivo and in vitro SUMOylation assays, PLK1 was identified as a physiologically relevant small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO)-targeted protein, preferentially modified by SUMO-1. We further showed that K492 on PLK1 is essential for SUMOylation. SUMOylation causes PLK1’s nuclear import and significantly increases its protein stability, both of which are critical for normal mitotic progression and genomic integrity. Our findings suggest that SUMOylation is an important regulatory mechanism governing PLK1’s mitotic function.

Abstract: Summary
Axonal targeting of signaling receptors is essential for neuronal responses to extracellular cues. Here, we report that retrograde signaling by target-derived nerve growth factor (NGF) is necessary for soma-to-axon transcytosis of TrkA receptors in sympathetic neurons, and we define the molecular underpinnings of this positive feedback regulation that enhances neuronal sensitivity to trophic factors. Activated TrkA receptors are retrogradely transported in signaling endosomes from distal axons to cell bodies, where they are inserted on soma surfaces and promote phosphorylation of resident naive receptors, resulting in their internalization. Endocytosed TrkA receptors are then dephosphorylated by PTP1B, an ER-resident protein tyrosine phosphatase, prior to axonal transport. PTP1B inactivation prevents TrkA exit from soma and causes receptor degradation, suggesting a “gatekeeper” mechanism that ensures targeting of inactive receptors to axons to engage with ligand. In mice, PTP1B deletion reduces axonal TrkA levels and attenuates neuron survival and target innervation under limiting NGF (NGF+/−) conditions.

Abstract: Summary
The gastric lamina propria is largely uncharted immunological territory. Here we describe the evolution and composition of the gastric, small intestinal, and colonic lamina propria mononuclear phagocyte system during the steady state and infection with the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori. We show that monocytes, CX3CR1hi macrophages, and CD11b+ dendritic cells are recruited to the infected stomach in a CCR2-dependent manner. All three populations, but not BATF3-dependent CD103+ DCs, sample red fluorescent protein (RFP)+ Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). Mice reconstituted with human hematopoietic stem cells recapitulate several features of the myeloid cell-H. pylori interaction. The differentiation in and/or recruitment to gastrointestinal, lung, and lymphoid tissues of CD11b+ DCs requires NLRP3, but not apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a carboxy-terminal CARD (ASC) or caspase-1, during steady-state and chronic infection. NLRP3−/− mice fail to generate Treg responses to H. pylori and control the infection more effectively than wild-type mice. The results demonstrate a non-canonical inflammasome-independent function of NLRP3 in DC development and immune regulation.

Abstract: Summary
ARID1A, an SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling gene, is commonly mutated in cancer and hypothesized to be tumor suppressive. In some hepatocellular carcinoma patients, ARID1A was highly expressed in primary tumors but not in metastatic lesions, suggesting that ARID1A can be lost after initiation. Mice with liver-specific homozygous or heterozygous Arid1a loss were resistant to tumor initiation while ARID1A overexpression accelerated initiation. In contrast, homozygous or heterozygous Arid1a loss in established tumors accelerated progression and metastasis. Mechanistically, gain of Arid1a function promoted initiation by increasing CYP450-mediated oxidative stress, while loss of Arid1a within tumors decreased chromatin accessibility and reduced transcription of genes associated with migration, invasion, and metastasis. In summary, ARID1A has context-dependent tumor-suppressive and oncogenic roles in cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in the Golgi SNARE (SNAP [soluble NSF attachment protein] receptor) protein Membrin (encoded by the GOSR2 gene) cause progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME). Membrin is a ubiquitous and essential protein mediating ER-to-Golgi membrane fusion. Thus, it is unclear how mutations in Membrin result in a disorder restricted to the nervous system. Here, we use a multi-layered strategy to elucidate the consequences of Membrin mutations from protein to neuron. We show that the pathogenic mutations cause partial reductions in SNARE-mediated membrane fusion. Importantly, these alterations were sufficient to profoundly impair dendritic growth in Drosophila models of GOSR2-PME. Furthermore, we show that Membrin mutations cause fragmentation of the presynaptic cytoskeleton coupled with transsynaptic instability and hyperactive neurotransmission. Our study highlights how dendritic growth is vulnerable even to subtle secretory pathway deficits, uncovers a role for Membrin in synaptic function, and provides a comprehensive explanatory basis for genotype-phenotype relationships in GOSR2-PME.

Abstract: Summary
To characterize susceptibility to HIV infection, we phenotyped infected tonsillar T cells by single-cell mass cytometry and created comprehensive maps to identify which subsets of CD4+ T cells support HIV fusion and productive infection. By comparing HIV-fused and HIV-infected cells through dimensionality reduction, clustering, and statistical approaches to account for viral perturbations, we identified a subset of memory CD4+ T cells that support HIV entry but not viral gene expression. These cells express high levels of CD127, the IL-7 receptor, and are believed to be long-lived lymphocytes. In HIV-infected patients, CD127-expressing cells preferentially localize to extrafollicular lymphoid regions with limited viral replication. Thus, CyTOF-based phenotyping, combined with analytical approaches to distinguish between selective infection and receptor modulation by viruses, can be used as a discovery tool.

Abstract: Summary
The NMDA spike is a long-lasting nonlinear phenomenon initiated locally in the dendritic branches of a variety of cortical neurons. It plays a key role in synaptic plasticity and in single-neuron computations. Combining dynamic system theory and computational approaches, we now explore how the timing of synaptic inhibition affects the NMDA spike and its associated membrane current. When impinging on its early phase, individual inhibitory synapses strongly, but transiently, dampen the NMDA spike; later inhibition prematurely terminates it. A single inhibitory synapse reduces the NMDA-mediated Ca2+ current, a key player in plasticity, by up to 45%. NMDA spikes in distal dendritic branches/spines are longer-lasting and more resilient to inhibition, enhancing synaptic plasticity at these branches. We conclude that NMDA spikes are highly sensitive to dendritic inhibition; sparse weak inhibition can finely tune synaptic plasticity both locally at the dendritic branch level and globally at the level of the neuron’s output.

Abstract: Summary
We developed an RNA-sequencing-based pipeline to discover differentially expressed cell-surface molecules in neuroblastoma that meet criteria for optimal immunotherapeutic target safety and efficacy. Here, we show that GPC2 is a strong candidate immunotherapeutic target in this childhood cancer. We demonstrate high GPC2 expression in neuroblastoma due to MYCN transcriptional activation and/or somatic gain of the GPC2 locus. We confirm GPC2 to be highly expressed on most neuroblastomas, but not detectable at appreciable levels in normal childhood tissues. In addition, we demonstrate that GPC2 is required for neuroblastoma proliferation. Finally, we develop a GPC2-directed antibody-drug conjugate that is potently cytotoxic to GPC2-expressing neuroblastoma cells. Collectively, these findings validate GPC2 as a non-mutated neuroblastoma oncoprotein and candidate immunotherapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
A typical pathogen presents a combination of Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands during infection. Although individual TLR pathways have been well characterized, the nature of this “combinatorial code” in pathogen sensing remains unclear. Here, we conducted a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of primary macrophages stimulated with all possible pairwise combinations of four different TLR ligands to understand the requirements, kinetics, and outcome of combined pathway engagement. We find that signal integration between TLR pathways leads to non-additive responses for a subset of immune mediators with sustained expression (>6 hr) properties and T cell polarizing function. To identify the underlying regulators, we conducted a focused RNAi screen and identified four genes—Helz2, Phf11d, Sertad3, and Zscan12—which preferentially affect the late phase response of TLR-induced immune effector expression. This study reveals key molecular details of how contemporaneous signaling through multiple TLRs, as would often be the case with pathogen infection, produce biological outcomes distinct from the single ligands typically used to characterize TLR pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Cell-cell contact formation constitutes an essential step in evolution, leading to the differentiation of specialized cell types. However, remarkably little is known about whether and how the interplay between contact formation and fate specification affects development. Here, we identify a positive feedback loop between cell-cell contact duration, morphogen signaling, and mesendoderm cell-fate specification during zebrafish gastrulation. We show that long-lasting cell-cell contacts enhance the competence of prechordal plate (ppl) progenitor cells to respond to Nodal signaling, required for ppl cell-fate specification. We further show that Nodal signaling promotes ppl cell-cell contact duration, generating a positive feedback loop between ppl cell-cell contact duration and cell-fate specification. Finally, by combining mathematical modeling and experimentation, we show that this feedback determines whether anterior axial mesendoderm cells become ppl or, instead, turn into endoderm. Thus, the interdependent activities of cell-cell signaling and contact formation control fate diversification within the developing embryo.

Abstract: Summary
Dysregulated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) promotes cancer, but underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We describe an mTOR-driven mouse model that displays hepatosteatosis progressing to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Longitudinal proteomic, lipidomics, and metabolomic analyses revealed that hepatic mTORC2 promotes de novo fatty acid and lipid synthesis, leading to steatosis and tumor development. In particular, mTORC2 stimulated sphingolipid (glucosylceramide) and glycerophospholipid (cardiolipin) synthesis. Inhibition of fatty acid or sphingolipid synthesis prevented tumor development, indicating a causal effect in tumorigenesis. Increased levels of cardiolipin were associated with tubular mitochondria and enhanced oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, increased lipogenesis correlated with elevated mTORC2 activity and HCC in human patients. Thus, mTORC2 promotes cancer via formation of lipids essential for growth and energy production.

Abstract: Summary
NK cells can reduce anti-viral T cell immunity during chronic viral infections, including infection with the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). However, regulating factors that maintain the equilibrium between productive T cell and NK cell immunity are poorly understood. Here, we show that a large viral load resulted in inhibition of NK cell activation, which correlated with increased expression of Qa-1b, a ligand for inhibitory NK cell receptors. Qa-1b was predominantly upregulated on B cells following LCMV infection, and this upregulation was dependent on type I interferons. Absence of Qa-1b resulted in increased NK cell-mediated regulation of anti-viral T cells following viral infection. Consequently, anti-viral T cell immunity was reduced in Qa-1b- and NKG2A-deficient mice, resulting in increased viral replication and immunopathology. NK cell depletion restored anti-viral immunity and virus control in the absence of Qa-1b. Taken together, our findings indicate that lymphocytes limit NK cell activity during viral infection in order to promote anti-viral T cell immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Regulation of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor trafficking in response to neuronal activity is critical for synaptic function and plasticity. Here, we show that neuronal activity induces the binding of ephrinB2 and ApoER2 receptors at the postsynapse to regulate de novo insertion of AMPA receptors. Mechanistically, the multi-PDZ adaptor glutamate-receptor-interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) binds ApoER2 and bridges a complex including ApoER2, ephrinB2, and AMPA receptors. Phosphorylation of ephrinB2 in a serine residue (Ser-9) is essential for the stability of such a complex. In vivo, a mutation on ephrinB2 Ser-9 in mice results in a complete disruption of the complex, absence of ApoER2 downstream signaling, and impaired activity-induced and ApoER2-mediated AMPA receptor insertion. Using compound genetics, we show the requirement of this complex for long-term potentiation (LTP). Together, our findings uncover a cooperative ephrinB2 and ApoER2 signaling at the synapse, which serves to modulate activity-dependent AMPA receptor dynamic changes during synaptic plasticity.

Abstract: Summary
The Hippo/Yki and RB/E2F pathways both regulate tissue growth by affecting cell proliferation and survival, but interactions between these parallel control systems are poorly defined. In this study, we demonstrate that interaction between Drosophila E2F1 and Sd disrupts Yki/Sd complex formation and thereby suppresses Yki target gene expression. RBF modifies these effects by reducing E2F1/Sd interaction. This regulation has significant effects on apoptosis, organ size, and progenitor cell proliferation. Using a combination of DamID-seq and RNA-seq, we identified a set of Yki targets that play a diversity of roles during development and are suppressed by E2F1. Further, we found that human E2F1 competes with YAP for TEAD1 binding, affecting YAP activity, indicating that this mode of cross-regulation is conserved. In sum, our study uncovers a previously unknown mechanism in which RBF and E2F1 modify Hippo signaling responses to modulate apoptosis, organ growth, and homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
In contrast to extracellular chemotactic gradients, how cell-adhesion molecules contribute to directing cell migration remains more elusive. Here we studied the collective migration of Drosophila larval epidermal cells (LECs) along the anterior-posterior axis and propose a migrating cell group-autonomous mechanism in which an atypical cadherin Dachsous (Ds) plays a pivotal role. In each abdominal segment, the amount of Ds in each LEC varied along the axis of migration (Ds imbalance), which polarized Ds localization at cell boundaries. This Ds polarity was necessary for coordinating the migratory direction. Another atypical cadherin, Fat (Ft), and an unconventional myosin Dachs, both of which bind to Ds, also showed biased cell-boundary localizations, and both were required for the migration. Altogether, we propose that the Ds imbalance within the migrating tissue provides the directional cue and that this is decoded by Ds-Ft-mediated cell-cell contacts, which restricts lamellipodia formation to the posterior end of the cell.

Abstract: Summary
Inhibiting transmission of Plasmodium is a central strategy in malarial eradication, and the biological process of gamete fusion during fertilization is a proven target for this approach. The lack of a structure or known molecular function of current anti-malarial vaccine targets has previously been a hindrance in the development of transmission-blocking vaccines. Structure/function studies have indicated that the conserved gamete membrane fusion protein HAP2 is a class II viral fusion protein. Here, we demonstrate that targeting a function-critical site of the fusion/cd loop with species-specific antibodies reduces Plasmodium berghei transmission in vivo by 58.9% and in vitro fertilization by up to 89.9%. A corresponding reduction in P. falciparum transmission (75.5%/36.4% reductions in intensity/prevalence) is observed in complimentary field studies. These results emphasize conserved mechanisms of fusion in Apicomplexa, while highlighting an approach to design future anti-malarial transmission-blocking vaccines.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin remodeling is required for genome function and is facilitated by ATP-dependent complexes, such as nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD). Among its core components is the chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 3 (CHD3) whose functional significance is not well established. Here, we show that CHD3 co-localizes with the other NuRD subunits, including HDAC1, near the H3K9ac-enriched promoters of the NuRD target genes. The tandem PHD fingers of CHD3 bind histone H3 tails and posttranslational modifications that increase hydrophobicity of H3K9—methylation or acetylation (H3K9me3 or H3K9ac)—enhance this interaction. Binding of CHD3 PHDs promotes H3K9Cme3-nucleosome unwrapping in vitro and perturbs the pericentric heterochromatin structure in vivo. Methylation or acetylation of H3K9 uniquely alleviates the intra-nucleosomal interaction of histone H3 tails, increasing H3K9 accessibility. Collectively, our data suggest that the targeting of covalently modified H3K9 by CHD3 might be essential in diverse functions of NuRD.

Abstract: Summary
Most cellular stresses induce protein translation inhibition and stress granule formation. Here, using Drosophila S2 cells, we investigate the role of G3BP/Rasputin in this process. In contrast to arsenite treatment, where dephosphorylated Ser142 Rasputin is recruited to stress granules, we find that, upon amino acid starvation, only the phosphorylated Ser142 form is recruited. Furthermore, we identify Sec16, a component of the endoplasmic reticulum exit site, as a Rasputin interactor and stabilizer. Sec16 depletion results in Rasputin degradation and inhibition of stress granule formation. However, in the absence of Sec16, pharmacological stabilization of Rasputin is not enough to rescue the assembly of stress granules. This is because Sec16 specifically interacts with phosphorylated Ser142 Rasputin, the form required for stress granule formation upon amino acid starvation. Taken together, these results demonstrate that stress granule formation is fine-tuned by specific signaling cues that are unique to each stress. These results also expand the role of Sec16 as a stress response protein.

Abstract: Summary
The adaptive immune response involves T cell differentiation and migration to sites of inflammation. T cell trafficking is initiated by rolling on inflamed endothelium. Tethers and slings, discovered in neutrophils, facilitate cell rolling at high shear stress. Here, we demonstrate that the ability to form tethers and slings during rolling is highly inducible in T helper 1 (Th1), Th17, and regulatory T (Treg) cells but less in Th2 cells. In vivo, endogenous Treg cells rolled stably in cremaster venules at physiological shear stress. Quantitative dynamic footprinting nanoscopy of Th1, Th17, and Treg cells uncovered the formation of multiple tethers per cell. Human Th1 cells also showed tethers and slings. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed the induction of cell migration and cytoskeletal genes in sling-forming cells. We conclude that differentiated CD4 T cells stabilize rolling by inducible tether and sling formation. These phenotypic changes approximate the adhesion phenotype of neutrophils and support CD4 T cell access to sites of inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
The organization of Rhodopsin-family G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) at the cell surface is controversial. Support both for and against the existence of dimers has been obtained in studies of mostly individual receptors. Here, we use a large-scale comparative study to examine the stoichiometric signatures of 60 receptors expressed by a single human cell line. Using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer- and single-molecule microscopy-based assays, we found that a relatively small fraction of Rhodopsin-family GPCRs behaved as dimers and that these receptors otherwise appear to be monomeric. Overall, the analysis predicted that fewer than 20% of ∼700 Rhodopsin-family receptors form dimers. The clustered distribution of the dimers in our sample and a striking correlation between receptor organization and GPCR family size that we also uncover each suggest that receptor stoichiometry might have profoundly influenced GPCR expansion and diversification.

Abstract: Summary
Dendritic spines receive the majority of excitatory inputs in many mammalian neurons, but their biophysical properties and exact role in dendritic integration are still unclear. Here, we study spine electrical properties in cultured hippocampal neurons using an improved genetically encoded voltage indicator (ArcLight) and two-photon glutamate uncaging. We find that back-propagating action potentials (bAPs) fully invade dendritic spines. However, uncaging excitatory post-synaptic potentials (uEPSPs) generated by glutamate photorelease, ranging from 4 to 27 mV in amplitude, are attenuated by up to 4-fold as they propagate to the parent dendrites. Finally, the simultaneous occurrence of bAPs and uEPSPs results in sublinear summation of membrane potential. Our results demonstrate that spines can behave as electric compartments, reducing the synaptic inputs injected into the cell, while receiving bAPs are unmodified. The attenuation of EPSPs by spines could have important repercussions for synaptic plasticity and dendritic integration.

Abstract: Summary
Dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages (Mϕs) share close developmental pathways and functional features, leading to blurring of the boundaries between these two cell lineages. However, a deeper understanding of DC and Mϕ ontogeny and more refined phenotypic and functional characterizations have helped to delineate pre-DC-derived conventional DCs (cDCs), including cDC1s and cDC2s, from monocyte-derived Mϕs. Here, we further refine DC/Mϕ cell classification and report that classically defined cDC2s contain a discrete population of monocyte-derived migratory antigen-presenting cells with Mϕ phenotype but functional DC features, including cross-presentation.

Abstract: Summary
γ-secretase inhibitors (GSI) are drugs developed to decrease amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) production by inhibiting intramembranous cleavage of β-amyloid protein precursor (βAPP). However, a large phase 3 trial of semagacestat, a potential non-transition state analog (non-TSA) GSI, in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) was terminated due to unexpected aggravation of cognitive deficits and side effects. Here, we show that some semagacestat effects are clearly different from a phenotype caused by a loss of function of presenilins, core proteins in the γ-secretase complex. Semagacestat increases intracellular byproduct peptides, produced along with Aβ through serial γ-cleavage of βAPP, as well as intracellular long Aβ species, in cell-based and in vivo studies of AD model mice. Other potential non-TSA GSIs, but not L685,458, a TSA GSI, have similar effects. Furthermore, semagacestat inhibits release of de novo intramembranous γ-byproducts to the soluble space. Thus, semagacestat is a pseudo-GSI, and therefore, the semagacestat clinical trial did not truly test the Aβ hypothesis.

Abstract: Summary
The biophysical framework of collective cell migration has been extensively investigated in recent years; however, it remains elusive how chemical inputs from neighboring cells are integrated to coordinate the collective movement. Here, we provide evidence that propagation waves of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase activation determine the direction of the collective cell migration. A wound-healing assay of Mardin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells revealed two distinct types of ERK activation wave, a “tidal wave” from the wound, and a self-organized “spontaneous wave” in regions distant from the wound. In both cases, MDCK cells collectively migrated against the direction of the ERK activation wave. The inhibition of ERK activation propagation suppressed collective cell migration. An ERK activation wave spatiotemporally controlled actomyosin contraction and cell density. Furthermore, an optogenetic ERK activation wave reproduced the collective cell migration. These data provide new mechanistic insight into how cells sense the direction of collective cell migration.

Abstract: Summary
In eukaryotes, most RNA molecules are exported into the cytoplasm after transcription. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) reside and function primarily inside the nucleus, but nuclear localization of mRNAs has been considered rare in both animals and plants. Here we show that Arabidopsis anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) coactivator genes CDC20 and CCS52B (CDH1 ortholog) are co-expressed with their target cyclin B genes (CYCBs) during mitosis. CYCB transcripts can be exported and translated; however, CDC20 and CCS52B mRNAs are confined to the nucleus at prophase, and the cognate proteins are not translated until the redistribution of the mRNAs to the cytoplasm after nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) at prometaphase. The 5′ untranslated region (UTR) plays dual roles in CDC20 mRNA nuclear localization and translation. Mitotic accumulation of CDC20 and CCS52B transcripts enables the timely and rapid activation of APC/C, while the nuclear sequestration of these transcripts at prophase appears to protect cyclins from precocious degradation.

Abstract: Summary
Proper organization of the mitotic spindle is key to genetic stability, but molecular components of inter-microtubule bridges that crosslink kinetochore fibers (K-fibers) are still largely unknown. Here we identify a kinase-independent function of class II phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase α (PI3K-C2α) acting as limiting scaffold protein organizing clathrin and TACC3 complex crosslinking K-fibers. Downregulation of PI3K-C2α causes spindle alterations, delayed anaphase onset, and aneuploidy, indicating that PI3K-C2α expression is required for genomic stability. Reduced abundance of PI3K-C2α in breast cancer models initially impairs tumor growth but later leads to the convergent evolution of fast-growing clones with mitotic checkpoint defects. As a consequence of altered spindle, loss of PI3K-C2α increases sensitivity to taxane-based therapy in pre-clinical models and in neoadjuvant settings.

Abstract: Summary
In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Ero1 catalyzes disulfide bond formation and promotes glutathione (GSH) oxidation to GSSG. Since GSSG cannot be reduced in the ER, maintenance of the ER glutathione redox state and levels likely depends on ER glutathione import and GSSG export. We used quantitative GSH and GSSG biosensors to monitor glutathione import into the ER of yeast cells. We found that glutathione enters the ER by facilitated diffusion through the Sec61 protein-conducting channel, while oxidized Bip (Kar2) inhibits transport. Increased ER glutathione import triggers H2O2-dependent Bip oxidation through Ero1 reductive activation, which inhibits glutathione import in a negative regulatory loop. During ER stress, transport is activated by UPR-dependent Ero1 induction, and cytosolic glutathione levels increase. Thus, the ER redox poise is tuned by reciprocal control of glutathione import and Ero1 activation. The ER protein-conducting channel is permeable to small molecules, provided the driving force of a concentration gradient.

Abstract: Summary
We define how chronic cigarette smoke-induced time-dependent epigenetic alterations can sensitize human bronchial epithelial cells for transformation by a single oncogene. The smoke-induced chromatin changes include initial repressive polycomb marking of genes, later manifesting abnormal DNA methylation by 10 months. At this time, cells exhibit epithelial-to-mesenchymal changes, anchorage-independent growth, and upregulated RAS/MAPK signaling with silencing of hypermethylated genes, which normally inhibit these pathways and are associated with smoking-related non-small cell lung cancer. These cells, in the absence of any driver gene mutations, now transform by introducing a single KRAS mutation and form adenosquamous lung carcinomas in mice. Thus, epigenetic abnormalities may prime for changing oncogene senescence to addiction for a single key oncogene involved in lung cancer initiation.

Abstract: Summary
Flaviviruses are enveloped, positive-sensed single-stranded RNA viruses that remodel host membranes, incorporating both viral and host factors facilitating viral replication. In this study, we identified a key role for the membrane-bending host protein Reticulon 3.1 (RTN3.1A) during the replication cycle of three flaviviruses: West Nile virus (WNV), Dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus (ZIKV). We observed that, during infection, RTN3.1A is redistributed and recruited to the viral replication complex, a recruitment facilitated via the WNV NS4A protein, however, not DENV or ZIKV NS4A. Critically, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of RTN3.1A expression attenuated WNV, DENV, and ZIKV replication and severely affected the stability and abundance of the NS4A protein, coinciding with a significant alternation and reduction of viral membrane structures in the endoplasmic reticulum. These observations identified a crucial role of RTN3.1A for the viral remodelling of host membranes during efficient flavivirus replication and the stabilization of viral proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum.

Abstract: Recent studies on molecular carcinogenesis suggest that the chemo-resistance of some cancers is largely due to presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs), which affect the chemotherapy outcome for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, currently no consensus on a CSC phenotype in HCC has been obtained. Here, we examined Sox12 as a novel CSC marker in HCC. Sox12+ versus Sox12− cells were purified from HCC cell lines. The Sox12+ cells were compared with Sox12− HCC cells for tumor sphere formation, chemo-resistance, tumor formation after serial adoptive transplantations in nude mice, and the frequency of developing distal metastasis. We found that compared to Sox12− HCC cells, Sox12+ HCC cells generated significantly more tumor spheres in culture, were more chemo-resistant to cisplatin, were detected in circulation more frequently, and formed distal tumor more frequently. Moreover, Sox12 appeared to functionally contribute to the stemness of HCC cells. Thus, we conclude that Sox12 may be a novel marker for enriching CSCs in HCC.

Abstract: Summary
Upon recognition of auto-antigens, thymocytes are negatively selected or diverted to a regulatory T cell (Treg) fate. CCR7 is required for negative selection of auto-reactive thymocytes in the thymic medulla. Here, we describe an unanticipated contribution of CCR7 to intrathymic Treg generation. Ccr7−/− mice have increased Treg cellularity because of a hematopoietic but non-T cell autonomous CCR7 function. CCR7 expression by thymic dendritic cells (DCs) promotes survival of mature Sirpα− DCs. Thus, CCR7 deficiency results in apoptosis of Sirpα− DCs, which is counterbalanced by expansion of immature Sirpα+ DCs that efficiently induce Treg generation. CCR7 deficiency results in enhanced intrathymic generation of Tregs at the neonatal stage and in lymphopenic adults, when Treg differentiation is critical for establishing self-tolerance. Together, these results reveal a complex function for CCR7 in thymic tolerance induction, where CCR7 not only promotes negative selection but also governs intrathymic Treg generation via non-thymocyte intrinsic mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor microenvironments are a driver of resistance to anti-cancer drugs. Dissecting cell-microenvironment interactions into tractable units of study presents a challenge. Here, we assess the impact of hundreds of tumor-inspired microenvironments, in parallel, on lapatinib responses in four cancer cell lines. Combinations of ECM and soluble factors were printed on stiffness-tunable substrata to generate a collection of controlled microenvironments in which to explore cell-based functional responses. Proliferation, HER2 protein expression and phosphorylation, and morphology were measured in single cells. Using dimension reduction and linear modeling, the effects of microenvironment constituents were identified and then validated empirically. Each of the cell lines exhibits unique microenvironment-response patterns. Fibronectin, type IV collagen, and matrix rigidity are significant regulators of lapatinib resistance in HER2-amplified breast cancer cells. Small-molecule inhibitors were identified that could attenuate microenvironment-imposed resistance. Thus, we demonstrate a strategy to identify resistance- and sensitivity-driving microenvironments to improve the efficacy of anti-cancer therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
A gradual restriction in lineage potential of multipotent stem/progenitor cells is a hallmark of adult hematopoiesis, but the underlying molecular events governing these processes remain incompletely understood. Here, we identified robust expression of the leukemia-associated transcription factor hepatic leukemia factor (Hlf) in normal multipotent hematopoietic progenitors, which was rapidly downregulated upon differentiation. Interference with its normal downregulation revealed Hlf as a strong negative regulator of lymphoid development, while remaining compatible with myeloid fates. Reciprocally, we observed rapid lymphoid commitment upon reduced Hlf activity. The arising phenotypes resulted from Hlf binding to active enhancers of myeloid-competent cells, transcriptional induction of myeloid, and ablation of lymphoid gene programs, with Hlf induction of nuclear factor I C (Nfic) as a functionally relevant target gene. Thereby, our studies establish Hlf as a key regulator of the earliest lineage-commitment events at the transition from multipotency to lineage-restricted progeny, with implications for both normal and malignant hematopoiesis.

Abstract: Summary
The transcription factor Tcf1 is essential for the development of natural killer (NK) cells. However, its precise role has not been clarified. Our combined analysis of Tcf1-deficient and transgenic mice indicated that Tcf1 guides NK cells through three stages of development. Tcf1 expression directed bone marrow progenitors toward the NK cell lineage and ensured the survival of NK-committed cells, and its downregulation was needed for terminal maturation. Impaired survival of NK-committed cells was due to excessive expression of granzyme B (GzmB) and other granzyme family members, which induced NK cell self-destruction during maturation and following activation with cytokines or target cells. Mechanistically, Tcf1 binding reduced the activity of a Gzmb-associated regulatory element, and this accounted for the reduced Gzmb expression in Tcf1-expressing NK cells. These data identify an unexpected requirement to limit the expression of cytotoxic effector molecules for the normal expansion and function of NK cells.

Abstract: Summary
Hebbian and homeostatic forms of plasticity operate on different timescales to regulate synaptic strength. The degree of mechanistic overlap between these processes and their mutual influence are still incompletely understood. Here, we report that homeostatic synaptic strengthening induced by prolonged network inactivity compromised the ability of CA1 synapses to exhibit LTP. This effect could not be accounted for by an obvious deficit in the postsynaptic capacity for LTP expression, since neither the fraction of silent synapses nor the ability to induce LTP by two-photon glutamate uncaging were reduced by the homeostatic process. Rather, optical quantal analysis reveals that homeostatically strengthened synapses display a reduced capacity to maintain glutamate release fidelity during repetitive stimulation, ultimately impeding the induction, and thus expression, of LTP. By regulating the short-term dynamics of glutamate release, the homeostatic process thus influences key aspects of dynamic network function and exhibits features of metaplasticity.

Abstract: Summary
Low-pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (LPAIVs) have caused a global concern to public health since the first novel LPAIV H7N9 outbreak occurred. The receptor-binding properties of the viral hemagglutinin are one key factor for efficient transmission and infection in humans. Recent evidence shows that H4 subtype viruses have been widely circulating in domestic poultry and human asymptomatic infections might have occurred. Here, we evaluated the receptor-binding properties of two representative isolates, avian H4N6 (containing Q226 and G228) and swine H4N6 (containing L226 and S228), and found that the avian isolate preferentially binds to avian receptors, whereas the swine isolate preferentially binds to human receptors. The Q226L and G228S substitutions are pivotal for the receptor-binding switch, which resulted in similar human receptor-binding features to the pandemic H2 and H3, implying that H4 has the potential to cause human infections. This early-warning study calls for future extensive surveillance.

Abstract: Summary
Proper regulation of mTORC1 and mTORC2 upon nutrient starvation is critical for cancer cell survival. Upregulation of Sestrin2 in response to glutamine deprivation rescues cell death by suppressing mTORC1. However, the contribution of mTORC2 to Sestrin2-mediated mTORC1 suppression remains unclear. Here, we report that both Sestrin2 and mTORC2 are upregulated in glutamine-depleted lung cancer cells. Moreover, glutamine depletion caused Sestrin2 to associate with mTORC2, which was required for the increase in Sestrin2 protein stability and the reduction in mTORC1 activity. Ultimately, differential regulation of mTORC1 and 2 by Sestrin2 reprogramed lipid metabolism and enabled glutamine-depleted lung cancer cells to survive by maintaining energy and redox balance. Importantly, combined inhibition of glutamine utilization and Sestrin2 induced lung cancer cell death both in vitro and in vivo. This study shows that differential Sestrin2-mediated regulation of mTORC1 and mTORC2 is necessary for the survival of glutamine-depleted lung cancer cells.

Abstract: Histone-modifying enzymes are key players in the field of cellular differentiation. Here, we used GSK-J4 to profile important target genes that are responsible for neural differentiation. Embryoid bodies were treated with retinoic acid (10 μM) to induce neural differentiation in the presence or absence of GSK-J4. To profile GSKJ4-target genes, we performed RNA sequencing for both normal and demethylase-inhibited cells. A total of 47 and 58 genes were up- and down-regulated, respectively, after GSK-J4 exposure at a log2-fold-change cut-off value of 1.2 (p-value < 0.05). Functional annotations of all of the differentially expressed genes revealed that a significant number of genes were associated with the suppression of cellular proliferation, cell cycle progression and induction of cell death. We also identified an enrichment of potent motifs in selected genes that were differentially expressed. Additionally, we listed upstream transcriptional regulators of all of the differentially expressed genes. Our data indicate that GSK-J4 affects cellular biology by inhibiting cellular proliferation through cell cycle suppression and induction of cell death. These findings will expand the current understanding of the biology of histone-modifying enzymes, thereby promoting further investigations to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
The separation of germline from somatic lineages is fundamental to reproduction and species preservation. Here, we show that Drosophila Germ cell-less (GCL) is a critical component in this process by acting as a switch that turns off a somatic lineage pathway. GCL, a conserved BTB (Broad-complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-a-brac) protein, is a substrate-specific adaptor for Cullin3-RING ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL3GCL). We show that CRL3GCL promotes PGC fate by mediating degradation of Torso, a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and major determinant of somatic cell fate. This mode of RTK degradation does not depend upon receptor activation but is prompted by release of GCL from the nuclear envelope during mitosis. The cell-cycle-dependent change in GCL localization provides spatiotemporal specificity for RTK degradation and sequesters CRL3GCL to prevent it from participating in excessive activities.

Abstract: Summary
Aggregation of polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin exon 1 (HttEx1) in Huntington’s disease (HD) proceeds from soluble oligomers to late-stage inclusions. The nature of the aggregates and how they lead to neuronal dysfunction is not well understood. We employed mass spectrometry (MS)-based quantitative proteomics to dissect spatiotemporal mechanisms of neurodegeneration using the R6/2 mouse model of HD. Extensive remodeling of the soluble brain proteome correlated with insoluble aggregate formation during disease progression. In-depth and quantitative characterization of the aggregates uncovered an unprecedented complexity of several hundred proteins. Sequestration to aggregates depended on protein expression levels and sequence features such as low-complexity regions or coiled-coil domains. In a cell-based HD model, overexpression of a subset of the sequestered proteins in most cases rescued viability and reduced aggregate size. Our spatiotemporally resolved proteome resource of HD progression indicates that widespread loss of cellular protein function contributes to aggregate-mediated toxicity.

Abstract: Summary
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master regulator of cellular metabolism, is a potential target for type 2 diabetes. Although extensive in vitro studies have revealed the complex regulation of AMPK, much remains unknown about the regulation in vivo. We therefore developed transgenic mice expressing a highly sensitive fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based biosensor for AMPK, called AMPKAR-EV. AMPKAR-EV allowed us to readily examine the role of LKB1, a canonical stimulator of AMPK, in drug-induced activation and inactivation of AMPK in vitro. In transgenic mice expressing AMPKAR-EV, the AMP analog AICAR activated AMPK in muscle. In contrast, the antidiabetic drug metformin activated AMPK in liver, highlighting the organ-specific action of AMPK stimulators. Moreover, we found that AMPK was activated primarily in fast-twitch muscle fibers after tetanic contraction and exercise. These observations suggest that the AMPKAR-EV mouse will pave a way to understanding the heterogeneous responses of AMPK among cell types in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) are among the most responsive solid cancers to conventional chemotherapy. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we developed a mouse TGCT model featuring germ cell-specific Kras activation and Pten inactivation. The resulting mice developed malignant, metastatic TGCTs composed of teratoma and embryonal carcinoma, the latter of which exhibited stem cell characteristics, including expression of the pluripotency factor OCT4. Consistent with epidemiological data linking human testicular cancer risk to in utero exposures, embryonic germ cells were susceptible to malignant transformation, whereas adult germ cells underwent apoptosis in response to the same oncogenic events. Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with genotoxic chemotherapy not only prolonged survival and reduced tumor size but also selectively eliminated the OCT4-positive cancer stem cells. We conclude that the chemosensitivity of TGCTs derives from the sensitivity of their cancer stem cells to DNA-damaging chemotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription initiation entails chromatin opening followed by pre-initiation complex formation and RNA polymerase II recruitment. Subsequent polymerase elongation requires additional signals, resulting in increased residence time downstream of the start site, a phenomenon referred to as pausing. Here, we harnessed single-molecule footprinting to quantify distinct steps of initiation in vivo throughout the Drosophila genome. This identifies the impact of promoter structure on initiation dynamics in relation to nucleosomal occupancy. Additionally, perturbation of transcriptional initiation reveals an unexpectedly high turnover of polymerases at paused promoters—an observation confirmed at the level of nascent RNAs. These observations argue that absence of elongation is largely caused by premature termination rather than by stable polymerase stalling. In support of this non-processive model, we observe that induction of the paused heat shock promoter depends on continuous initiation. Our study provides a framework to quantify protein binding at single-molecule resolution and refines concepts of transcriptional pausing.

Abstract: Summary
We have developed a high-throughput, microfluidics-based platform to perform kinetic analysis of viral infections in individual cells. We have analyzed thousands of individual poliovirus infections while varying experimental parameters, including multiplicity of infection, cell cycle, viral genotype, and presence of a drug. We make several unexpected observations masked by population-based experiments: (1) viral and cellular factors contribute uniquely and independently to viral infection kinetics; (2) cellular factors cause wide variation in replication start times; and (3) infections frequently begin later and replication occurs faster than predicted by population measurements. We show that mutational load impairs interaction of the viral population with the host, delaying replication start times and explaining the attenuated phenotype of a mutator virus. We show that an antiviral drug can selectively extinguish the most-fit members of the viral population. Single-cell virology facilitates discovery and characterization of virulence determinants and elucidation of mechanisms of drug action eluded by population methods.

Abstract: Summary
The control of targeted reaching is thought to be shaped by distinct subtypes of local GABAergic inhibitory neurons in primary forelimb motor cortex (M1). However, little is known about their action potential firing dynamics during reaching. To address this, we recorded the activity of parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) GABAergic neurons identified from a larger population of fast-spiking units and putative excitatory regular-spiking units in layer 5 of the mouse forelimb M1 during an M1-dependent, sensory-triggered reaching task. PV+ neurons showed short latency responses to the acoustic cue and vibrotactile trigger stimulus and an increase in firing at reaching onset that scaled with the amplitude of reaching. Unexpectedly, PV+ neurons fired before regular-spiking units at reach onset and showed high overall firing rates during both sensory-triggered and spontaneous reaches. Our data suggest that increasing M1 PV+ neuron firing rates may play a role in the initiation of voluntary reaching.

Abstract: Summary
Alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs is prominent in the mammalian brain, where it is thought to expand proteome diversity. For example, alternative splicing of voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (VGCC) α1 subunits can generate thousands of isoforms with differential properties and expression patterns. However, the impact of this molecular diversity on brain function, particularly on synaptic transmission, which crucially depends on VGCCs, is unclear. Here, we investigate how two major splice isoforms of P/Q-type VGCCs (Cav2.1[EFa/b]) regulate presynaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons. We find that the efficacy of P/Q-type VGCC isoforms in supporting synaptic transmission is markedly different, with Cav2.1[EFa] promoting synaptic depression and Cav2.1[EFb] synaptic facilitation. Following a reduction in network activity, hippocampal neurons upregulate selectively Cav2.1[EFa], the isoform exhibiting the higher synaptic efficacy, thus effectively supporting presynaptic homeostatic plasticity. Therefore, the balance between VGCC splice variants at the synapse is a key factor in controlling neurotransmitter release and presynaptic plasticity.

Abstract: Summary
Central nervous system (CNS) chemical protection depends upon discrete control of small-molecule access by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Curiously, some drugs cause CNS side-effects despite negligible transit past the BBB. To investigate this phenomenon, we asked whether the highly BBB-enriched drug efflux transporter MDR1 has dual functions in controlling drug and endogenous molecule CNS homeostasis. If this is true, then brain-impermeable drugs could induce behavioral changes by affecting brain levels of endogenous molecules. Using computational, genetic, and pharmacologic approaches across diverse organisms, we demonstrate that BBB-localized efflux transporters are critical for regulating brain levels of endogenous steroids and steroid-regulated behaviors (sleep in Drosophila and anxiety in mice). Furthermore, we show that MDR1-interacting drugs are associated with anxiety-related behaviors in humans. We propose a general mechanism for common behavioral side effects of prescription drugs: pharmacologically challenging BBB efflux transporters disrupts brain levels of endogenous substrates and implicates the BBB in behavioral regulation.

Abstract: Summary
The medial habenula-interpeduncular nucleus (MHb-IPN) pathway, which connects the limbic forebrain to the midbrain, has recently been implicated in aversive behaviors. The MHb-IPN circuit is characterized by a unique topographical organization, an excitatory role of GABA, and a prominent co-release of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. However, little is known about synaptic plasticity in this pathway. An application of a high-frequency stimulation resulted in a long-lasting potentiation of glutamate release in IPN neurons. Our experiments reveal that a Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptor (CPAR)-dependent release of GABA from IPN neurons and a retrograde activation of GABAB receptors on MHb terminals result in a long-lasting enhancement of glutamate release. Strikingly, adolescent IPN neurons lacked CPARs and exhibited an inability to undergo plasticity. In addition, fear conditioning suppressed an activity-dependent potentiation of MHb-IPN synapses, whereas fear extinction reversed this plasticity deficit, suggesting a role of the MHb-IPN synaptic plasticity in the regulation of aversive behaviors.

Abstract: Summary
Heterochromatin is integral to cell identity maintenance by impeding the activation of genes for alternate cell fates. Heterochromatic regions are associated with histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) or H3K27me3, but these modifications are also found in euchromatic regions that permit transcription. We discovered that resistance to sonication is a reliable indicator of the heterochromatin state, and we developed a biophysical method (gradient-seq) to discriminate subtypes of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 domains in sonication-resistant heterochromatin (srHC) versus euchromatin. These classifications are more accurate than the histone marks alone in predicting transcriptional silence and resistance of alternate fate genes to activation during direct cell conversion. Our proteomics of H3K9me3-marked srHC and functional screens revealed diverse proteins, including RBMX and RBMXL1, that impede gene induction during cellular reprogramming. Isolation of srHC with gradient-seq provides a genome-wide map of chromatin structure, elucidating subtypes of repressed domains that are uniquely predictive of diverse other chromatin properties.

Abstract: Summary
Covalent nucleotide modifications in noncoding RNAs affect a plethora of biological processes, and new functions continue to be discovered even for well-known modifying enzymes. To systematically compare the functions of a large set of noncoding RNA modifications in gene regulation, we carried out ribosome profiling in budding yeast to characterize 57 nonessential genes involved in tRNA modification. Deletion mutants exhibited a range of translational phenotypes, with enzymes known to modify anticodons, or non-tRNA substrates such as rRNA, exhibiting the most dramatic translational perturbations. Our data build on prior reports documenting translational upregulation of the nutrient-responsive transcription factor Gcn4 in response to numerous tRNA perturbations, and identify many additional translationally regulated mRNAs throughout the yeast genome. Our data also uncover unexpected roles for tRNA-modifying enzymes in regulation of TY retroelements, and in rRNA 2′-O-methylation. This dataset should provide a rich resource for discovery of additional links between tRNA modifications and gene regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Endurance exercise is an effective therapeutic intervention with substantial pro-healthspan effects. Male Drosophila respond to a ramped daily program of exercise by inducing conserved physiological responses similar to those seen in mice and humans. Female flies respond to an exercise stimulus but do not experience the adaptive training response seen in males. Here, we use female flies as a model to demonstrate that differences in exercise response are mediated by differences in neuronal activity. The activity of octopaminergic neurons is specifically required to induce the conserved cellular and physiological changes seen following endurance training. Furthermore, either intermittent, scheduled activation of octopaminergic neurons or octopamine feeding is able to fully substitute for exercise, conferring a suite of pro-healthspan benefits to sedentary Drosophila. These experiments indicate that octopamine is a critical mediator of adaptation to endurance exercise in Drosophila.

Abstract: Summary
Improvement of chilling tolerance is a major target in rice breeding. The signaling pathways regulating chilling consist of complex networks, including key transcription factors and their targets. However, it remains largely unknown how transcription factors are activated by chilling stress. Here, we report that the transcription factor OsbHLH002/OsICE1 is phosphorylated by OsMAPK3 under chilling stress. The osbhlh002-1 knockout mutant and antisense transgenic plants showed chilling hypersensitivity, whereas OsbHLH002-overexpressing plants exhibited enhanced chilling tolerance. OsbHLH002 can directly target OsTPP1, which encodes a key enzyme for trehalose biosynthesis. OsMAPK3 interacts with OsbHLH002 to prevent its ubiquitination by the E3 ligase OsHOS1. Under chilling stress, active OsMAPK3 phosphorylates OsbHLH002, leading to accumulation of phospho-OsbHLH002, which promotes OsTPP1 expression and increases trehalose content and resistance to chilling damage. Taken together, these results indicate that OsbHLH002 is phosphorylated by OsMAPK3, which enhances OsbHLH002 activation to its target OsTPP1 during chilling stress.

Abstract: The periodontal ligament (PDL) is the connective tissue between tooth root and alveolar bone containing mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). It has been suggested that human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs) differentiate into osteo/cementoblast and ligament progenitor cells. The periodontitis is a representative oral disease where the PDL tissue is collapsed, and regeneration of this tissue is important in periodontitis therapy. Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) stimulates proliferation and differentiation of fibroblastic MSCs into various cell lineages. We evaluated the dose efficacy of FGF-2 for cytodifferentiation of hPDLSCs into ligament progenitor. The fibrous morphology was highly stimulated even at low FGF-2 concentrations, and the expression of teno/ligamentogenic markers, scleraxis and tenomodulin in hPDLSCs increased in a dose dependent manner of FGF-2. In contrast, expression of the osteo/cementogenic markers decreased, suggesting that FGF-2 might induce and maintain the ligamentogenic potential of hPDLSCs. Although the stimulation of tenocytic maturation by TGF-β1 was diminished by FGF-2, the inhibition of the expression of early ligamentogenic marker by TGF-β1 was redeemed by FGF-2 treatment. The stimulating effect of BMPs on osteo/cementogenesis was apparently suppressed by FGF-2. These results indicate that FGF-2 predominantly differentiates the hPDLSCs into teno/ligamentogenesis, and has an antagonistic effect on the hard tissue differentiation induced by BMP-2 and BMP-4.

Abstract: Summary
Rac1 is a small RhoGTPase switch that orchestrates actin branching in space and time and protrusion/retraction cycles of the lamellipodia at the cell front during mesenchymal migration. Biosensor imaging has revealed a graded concentration of active GTP-loaded Rac1 in protruding regions of the cell. Here, using single-molecule imaging and super-resolution microscopy, we show an additional supramolecular organization of Rac1. We find that Rac1 partitions and is immobilized into nanoclusters of 50–100 molecules each. These nanoclusters assemble because of the interaction of the polybasic tail of Rac1 with the phosphoinositide lipids PIP2 and PIP3. The additional interactions with GEFs and possibly GAPs, downstream effectors, and other partners are responsible for an enrichment of Rac1 nanoclusters in protruding regions of the cell. Our results show that subcellular patterns of Rac1 activity are supported by gradients of signaling nanodomains of heterogeneous molecular composition, which presumably act as discrete signaling platforms.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in the fetus and adult possess distinct molecular landscapes that regulate cell fate and change their susceptibility to initiation and progression of hematopoietic malignancies. Here, we applied in-depth quantitative proteomics to comprehensively describe and compare the proteome of fetal and adult HSPCs. Our data uncover a striking difference in complexity of the cellular proteomes, with more diverse adult-specific HSPC proteomic signatures. The differential protein content in fetal and adult HSPCs indicate distinct metabolic profiles and protein complex stoichiometries. Additionally, adult characteristics include an arsenal of proteins linked to viral and bacterial defense, as well as protection against ROS-induced protein oxidation. Further analyses show that interferon α, as well as Neutrophil elastase, has distinct functional effects in fetal and adult HSPCs. This study provides a rich resource aimed toward an enhanced mechanistic understanding of normal and malignant hematopoiesis during fetal and adult life.

Abstract: Summary
Human centromeres are defined by alpha satellite DNA arrays that are distinct and chromosome specific. Most human chromosomes contain multiple alpha satellite arrays that are competent for centromere assembly. Here, we show that human centromeres are defined by chromosome-specific RNAs linked to underlying organization of distinct alpha satellite arrays. Active and inactive arrays on the same chromosome produce discrete sets of transcripts in cis. Non-coding RNAs produced from active arrays are complexed with CENP-A and CENP-C, while inactive-array transcripts associate with CENP-B and are generally less stable. Loss of CENP-A does not affect transcript abundance or stability. However, depletion of array-specific RNAs reduces CENP-A and CENP-C at the targeted centromere via faulty CENP-A loading, arresting cells before mitosis. This work shows that each human alpha satellite array produces a unique set of non-coding transcripts, and RNAs present at active centromeres are necessary for kinetochore assembly and cell-cycle progression.

Abstract: Summary
Membraneless RNA granules originate via phase separation events driven by multivalent interactions. As RNA is the defining component of such granules, we examined how RNA contributes to granule assembly. Expansion of hexanucleotide GGGGCC (G4C2) repeats in the first intron of C9ORF72 is the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (C9-ALS/FTD). We describe a biophysical phenomenon whereby G4C2 RNA (rG4C2) promotes the phase separation of RNA granule proteins in vitro and in cells. The ability of rG4C2 to promote phase separation is dependent on repeat length and RNA structure because rG4C2 must assume a G-quadruplex conformation to promote granule assembly. We demonstrate a central role for RNA in promoting phase separations and implicate rG4C2 G-quadruplex structures in the pathogenesis of C9-ALS/FTD.

Abstract: Background
Testosterone deficiency in elderly men increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. In bilateral orchiectomized (ORX) animals, impaired cardiac Ca2+ regulation was observed, and this impairment could be improved by testosterone replacement, indicating the important role of testosterone in cardiac Ca2+ regulation. However, the temporal changes of Ca2+ dyshomeostasis in testosterone-deprived conditions are unclear. Moreover, the effects of early vs. late testosterone replacement are unknown. We hypothesized that the longer the deprivation of testosterone, the greater the impairment of cardiac Ca2+ homeostasis, and that early testosterone replacement can effectively reduce this adverse effect.
Methods
Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into twelve groups, four sets of three. The first set were ORX for 2, 4 and 8 weeks, the second set were sham-operated groups of the same periods, the third set were ORX for 8 weeks coupled with a subcutaneous injection of vehicle (control), testosterone during weeks 1–8 (early replacement) or testosterone during weeks 5–8 (late replacement), and finally the 12-week sham-operated, ORX and ORX treated with testosterone groups. Cardiac Ca2+ transients (n=4-5/group), L-type calcium current (ICa-L) (n=4/group), Ca2+ regulatory proteins (n=6/group) and cardiac function (n=5/group) were determined.
Results
In the ORX rats, impaired cardiac Ca2+ transients and reduced ICa-L were observed initially 4 weeks after ORX as shown by decreased Ca2+ transient amplitude, rising rate and maximum and average decay rates. No alteration of Ca2+ regulatory proteins such as the L-type Ca2+ channels, ryanodine receptor type 2, Na+-Ca2+ exchangers and SERCA2a were observed. Early testosterone replacement markedly improved cardiac Ca2+ transients, whereas late testosterone replacement did not. The cardiac contractility was also improved after early testosterone replacement.
Conclusions
Impaired cardiac Ca2+ homeostasis is time-dependent after testosterone deprivation. Early testosterone replacement improves cardiac Ca2+ transient regulation and contractility, suggesting the necessity of early intervention in conditions of testosterone-deprivation.

Abstract: Summary
Many adult stem cells display prolonged quiescence, promoted by cues from their niche. Upon tissue damage, a coordinated transition to the activated state is required because non-physiological breaks in quiescence often lead to stem cell depletion and impaired regeneration. Here, we identify cadherin-mediated adhesion and signaling between muscle stem cells (satellite cells [SCs]) and their myofiber niche as a mechanism that orchestrates the quiescence-to-activation transition. Conditional removal of N-cadherin and M-cadherin in mice leads to a break in SC quiescence, with long-term expansion of a regeneration-proficient SC pool. These SCs have an incomplete disruption of the myofiber-SC adhesive junction and maintain niche residence and cell polarity, yet show properties of SCs in a state of transition from quiescence toward full activation. Among these is nuclear localization of β-catenin, which is necessary for this phenotype. Injury-induced perturbation of niche adhesive junctions is therefore a likely first step in the quiescence-to-activation transition.

Abstract: Summary
Developmental morphogenesis, tissue injury, and oncogenic transformation can cause the detachment of epithelial cells. These cells are eliminated by a specialized form of apoptosis (anoikis). While the processes that contribute to this form of cell death have been studied, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we tested the role of the cJUN NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway using murine models with compound JNK deficiency in mammary and kidney epithelial cells. These studies demonstrated that JNK is required for efficient anoikis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, JNK-promoted anoikis required pro-apoptotic members of the BCL2 family of proteins. We show that JNK acts through a BAK/BAX-dependent apoptotic pathway by increasing BIM expression and phosphorylating BMF, leading to death of detached epithelial cells.

Abstract: Summary
Localized protein synthesis is a mechanism for developing axons to react acutely and in a spatially restricted manner to extracellular signals. As such, it is important for many aspects of axonal development, but its role in the formation of presynapses remains poorly understood. We found that the induced assembly of presynaptic terminals required local protein synthesis. Newly synthesized proteins were detectable at nascent presynapses within 15 min of inducing synapse formation in isolated axons. The transcript for the t-SNARE protein SNAP25, which is required for the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane, was recruited to presynaptic sites and locally translated. Inhibition of intra-axonal SNAP25 synthesis affected the clustering of SNAP25 and other presynaptic proteins and interfered with the release of synaptic vesicles from presynaptic sites. This study reveals a critical role for the axonal synthesis of SNAP25 in the assembly of presynaptic terminals.

Abstract: Summary
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have emerged as important signaling molecules that play crucial roles in carcinogenesis and cytotoxic responses. Nrf2 is the master regulator of ROS balance. Thus, uncovering mechanisms of Nrf2 regulation is important for the development of alternative treatment strategies for cancers. Here, we demonstrate that iASPP, a known p53 inhibitor, lowers ROS independently of p53. Mechanistically, iASPP competes with Nrf2 for Keap1 binding via a DLT motif, leading to decreased Nrf2 ubiquitination and increased Nrf2 accumulation, nuclear translocation, and antioxidative transactivation. This iASPP-Keap1-Nrf2 axis promotes cancer growth and drug resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, iASPP is an antioxidative factor and represents a promising target to improve cancer treatment, regardless of p53 status.

Abstract: Summary
Eukaryotic gene transcription is regulated at many steps, including RNA polymerase II (Pol II) recruitment, transcription initiation, promoter-proximal Pol II pause release, and transcription termination; however, mechanisms regulating transcription during productive elongation remain poorly understood. Enhancers, which activate gene transcription, themselves undergo Pol II-mediated transcription, but our understanding of enhancer transcription and enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) remains incomplete. Here we show that transcription at intragenic enhancers interferes with and attenuates host gene transcription during productive elongation. While the extent of attenuation correlates positively with nascent eRNA expression, the act of intragenic enhancer transcription alone, but not eRNAs, explains the attenuation. Through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletions, we demonstrate a physiological role for intragenic enhancer-mediated transcription attenuation in cell fate determination. We propose that intragenic enhancers not only enhance transcription of one or more genes from a distance but also fine-tune transcription of their host gene through transcription interference, facilitating differential utilization of the same regulatory element for disparate functions.

Abstract: Summary
Certain BH3-only proteins transiently bind and activate Bak and Bax, initiating their oligomerization and the permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane, a pivotal step in the mitochondrial pathway to apoptosis. Here we describe the first crystal structures of an activator BH3 peptide bound to Bak and illustrate their use in the design of BH3 derivatives capable of inhibiting human Bak on mitochondria. These BH3 derivatives compete for the activation site at the canonical groove, are the first engineered inhibitors of Bak activation, and support the role of key conformational transitions associated with Bak activation.

Abstract: Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are currently being evaluated as a cell-based therapy for tissue injury and degenerative diseases. Recently, several methods have been suggested to further enhance the therapeutic functions of MSCs, including genetic modifications with tissue- and/or disease-specific genes. The objective of this study was to examine the efficiency and stability of transduction using an adenoviral vector in human MSCs. Additionally, we aimed to assess the effects of transduction on the proliferation and multipotency of MSCs. The results indicate that MSCs can be transduced by adenoviruses in vitro, but high viral titers are necessary to achieve high efficiency. In addition, transduction at a higher multiplicity of infection (MOI) was associated with attenuated proliferation and senescence-like morphology. Furthermore, transduced MSCs showed a diminished capacity for adipogenic differentiation while retaining their potential to differentiate into osteocytes and chondrocytes. This work could contribute significantly to clinical trials of MSCs modified with therapeutic genes.

Abstract: Summary
We report the results of a DREAM challenge designed to predict relative genetic essentialities based on a novel dataset testing 98,000 shRNAs against 149 molecularly characterized cancer cell lines. We analyzed the results of over 3,000 submissions over a period of 4 months. We found that algorithms combining essentiality data across multiple genes demonstrated increased accuracy; gene expression was the most informative molecular data type; the identity of the gene being predicted was far more important than the modeling strategy; well-predicted genes and selected molecular features showed enrichment in functional categories; and frequently selected expression features correlated with survival in primary tumors. This study establishes benchmarks for gene essentiality prediction, presents a community resource for future comparison with this benchmark, and provides insights into factors influencing the ability to predict gene essentiality from functional genetic screens. This study also demonstrates the value of releasing pre-publication data publicly to engage the community in an open research collaboration.

Abstract: Summary
Poor bone quality contributes to bone fragility in diabetes, aging, and osteogenesis imperfecta. However, the mechanisms controlling bone quality are not well understood, contributing to the current lack of strategies to diagnose or treat bone quality deficits. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling is a crucial mechanism known to regulate the material quality of bone, but its cellular target in this regulation is unknown. Studies showing that osteocytes directly remodel their perilacunar/canalicular matrix led us to hypothesize that TGF-β controls bone quality through perilacunar/canalicular remodeling (PLR). Using inhibitors and mice with an osteocyte-intrinsic defect in TGF-β signaling (TβRIIocy−/−), we show that TGF-β regulates PLR in a cell-intrinsic manner to control bone quality. Altogether, this study emphasizes that osteocytes are key in executing the biological control of bone quality through PLR, thereby highlighting the fundamental role of osteocyte-mediated PLR in bone homeostasis and fragility.
