Abstract: Summary
The p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) is known as an essential apoptosis inducer. Here, we report the seemingly paradoxical finding that PUMA is a proangiogenic factor critically required for the proliferation and survival of vascular and microglia cells. Strikingly, Puma deficiency by genetic deletion or small hairpin RNA knockdown inhibited developmental and pathological angiogenesis and reduced microglia numbers in vivo, whereas Puma gene delivery increased angiogenesis and cell survival. Mechanistically, we revealed that PUMA plays a critical role in regulating autophagy by modulating Erk activation and intracellular calcium level. Our findings revealed an unexpected function of PUMA in promoting angiogenesis and warrant more careful investigations into the therapeutic potential of PUMA in treating cancer and degenerative diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Growing evidence suggests that aggregation-prone proteins are both harmful and functional for a cell. How do cellular systems balance the detrimental and beneficial effect of protein aggregation? We reveal that aggregation-prone proteins are subject to differential transcriptional, translational, and degradation control compared to nonaggregation-prone proteins, which leads to their decreased synthesis, low abundance, and high turnover. Genetic modulators that enhance the aggregation phenotype are enriched in genes that influence expression homeostasis. Moreover, genes encoding aggregation-prone proteins are more likely to be harmful when overexpressed. The trends are evolutionarily conserved and suggest a strategy whereby cellular mechanisms specifically modulate the availability of aggregation-prone proteins to (1) keep concentrations below the critical ones required for aggregation and (2) shift the equilibrium between the monomeric and oligomeric/aggregate form, as explained by Le Chatelier’s principle. This strategy may prevent formation of undesirable aggregates and keep functional assemblies/aggregates under control.

Abstract: Summary
Drosophila neuroblasts (NBs) have emerged as a model for stem cell biology that is ideal for genetic analysis but is limited by the lack of cell-type-specific gene expression data. Here, we describe a method for isolating large numbers of pure NBs and differentiating neurons that retain both cell-cycle and lineage characteristics. We determine transcriptional profiles by mRNA sequencing and identify 28 predicted NB-specific transcription factors that can be arranged in a network containing hubs for Notch signaling, growth control, and chromatin regulation. Overexpression and RNA interference for these factors identify Klumpfuss as a regulator of self-renewal. We show that loss of Klumpfuss function causes premature differentiation and that overexpression results in the formation of transplantable brain tumors. Our data represent a valuable resource for investigating Drosophila developmental neurobiology, and the described method can be applied to other invertebrate stem cell lineages as well.

Abstract: Summary
DNA methylation is a mechanism of epigenetic regulation that is common to all vertebrates. Functional studies underscore its relevance for tissue homeostasis, but the global dynamics of DNA methylation during in vivo differentiation remain underexplored. Here we report high-resolution DNA methylation maps of adult stem cell differentiation in mouse, focusing on 19 purified cell populations of the blood and skin lineages. DNA methylation changes were locus specific and relatively modest in magnitude. They frequently overlapped with lineage-associated transcription factors and their binding sites, suggesting that DNA methylation may protect cells from aberrant transcription factor activation. DNA methylation and gene expression provided complementary information, and combining the two enabled us to infer the cellular differentiation hierarchy of the blood lineage directly from genome-scale data. In summary, these results demonstrate that in vivo differentiation of adult stem cells is associated with small but informative changes in the genomic distribution of DNA methylation.

Abstract: Summary
Glioblastoma (GBM) is a brain tumor that carries a dismal prognosis and displays considerable heterogeneity. We have recently identified recurrent H3F3A mutations affecting two critical amino acids (K27 and G34) of histone H3.3 in one-third of pediatric GBM. Here, we show that each H3F3A mutation defines an epigenetic subgroup of GBM with a distinct global methylation pattern, and that they are mutually exclusive with IDH1 mutations, which characterize a third mutation-defined subgroup. Three further epigenetic subgroups were enriched for hallmark genetic events of adult GBM and/or established transcriptomic signatures. We also demonstrate that the two H3F3A mutations give rise to GBMs in separate anatomic compartments, with differential regulation of transcription factors OLIG1, OLIG2, and FOXG1, possibly reflecting different cellular origins.

Abstract: Summary
Pathogens that reside in the phagosomes of infected cells persist despite the presence of potent T cell responses. We addressed the mechanism of immune evasion by using a mouse model of Salmonella typhimurium (ST). Recombinants of ST were generated that translocated antigen to the cytosol or phagosomes of infected cells. We find that the kinetics of antigen presentation and CD8+ T cell priming is accelerated by cytosolic antigen delivery, although the magnitude of CD8+ T cell response is not influenced by antigenic location. More importantly, only those targets that readily display antigen on the cell surface, owing to antigenic translocation to the cytosol, are recognized and killed by CD8+ T cells. Thus, vaccination approaches developed to control phagosomal pathogens should incorporate methods for modulating antigen presentation such that infected target cells can be readily recognized by CD8+ T cells.

Abstract: Summary
Planar cell polarity (PCP) refers to the collective orientation of cells within the epithelial plane. We show that progenitor cells forming the ducts of the embryonic pancreas express PCP proteins and exhibit an active PCP pathway. Planar polarity proteins are acquired at embryonic day 11.5 synchronously to apicobasal polarization of pancreas progenitors. Loss of function of the two PCP core components Celsr2 and Celsr3 shows that they control the differentiation of endocrine cells from polarized progenitors, with a prevalent effect on insulin-producing beta cells. This results in a decreased glucose clearance. Loss of Celsr2 and 3 leads to a reduction of Jun phosphorylation in progenitors, which, in turn, reduces beta cell differentiation from endocrine progenitors. These results highlight the importance of the PCP pathway in cell differentiation in vertebrates. In addition, they reveal that tridimensional organization and collective communication of cells are needed in the pancreatic epithelium in order to generate appropriate numbers of endocrine cells.

Abstract: Summary
Recent genome-wide studies in metazoans have shown that RNA polymerase II (Pol II) accumulates to high densities on many promoters at a rate-limited step in transcription. However, the status of this Pol II remains an area of debate. Here, we compare quantitative outputs of a global run-on sequencing assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing assays and demonstrate that the majority of the Pol II on Drosophila promoters is transcriptionally engaged; very little exists in a preinitiation or arrested complex. These promoter-proximal polymerases are inhibited from further elongation by detergent-sensitive factors, and knockdown of negative elongation factor, NELF, reduces their levels. These results not only solidify the notion that pausing occurs at most promoters, but demonstrate that it is the major rate-limiting step in early transcription at these promoters. Finally, the divergent elongation complexes seen at mammalian promoters are far less prevalent in Drosophila, and this specificity in orientation correlates with directional core promoter elements, which are abundant in Drosophila.

Sox2 in the Dermal Papilla Niche Controls Hair Growth by Fine-Tuning BMP Signaling in Differentiating Hair Shaft Progenitors,

Abstract: Summary
How dermal papilla (DP) niche cells regulate hair follicle progenitors to control hair growth remains unclear. Using Tbx18Cre to target embryonic DP precursors, we ablate the transcription factor Sox2 early and efficiently, resulting in diminished hair shaft outgrowth. We find that DP niche expression of Sox2 controls the migration speed of differentiating hair shaft progenitors. Transcriptional profiling of Sox2 null DPs reveals increased Bmp6 and decreased BMP inhibitor Sostdc1, a direct Sox2 transcriptional target. Subsequently, we identify upregulated BMP signaling in knockout hair shaft progenitors and demonstrate that Bmp6 inhibits cell migration, an effect that can be attenuated by Sostdc1. A shorter and Sox2-negative hair type lacks Sostdc1 in the DP and shows reduced migration and increased BMP activity of hair shaft progenitors. Collectively, our data identify Sox2 as a key regulator of hair growth that controls progenitor migration by fine-tuning BMP-mediated mesenchymal-epithelial crosstalk.

Abstract: Summary
The formation of tubular structures from epithelial sheets is a key process of organ formation in all animals, but the cytoskeletal rearrangements that cause the cell shape changes that drive tubulogenesis are not well understood. Using live imaging and super-resolution microscopy to analyze the tubulogenesis of the Drosophila salivary glands, I find that an anisotropic plasma membrane distribution of the protein Crumbs, mediated by its large extracellular domain, determines the subcellular localization of a supracellular actomyosin cable in the cells at the placode border, with myosin II accumulating at edges where Crumbs is lowest. Laser ablation shows that the cable is under increased tension, implying an active involvement in the invagination process. Crumbs anisotropy leads to anisotropic distribution of aPKC, which in turn can negatively regulate Rok, thus preventing the formation of a cable where Crumbs and aPKC are localized.

Abstract: Summary
The methylcytosine hydroxylase Tet2 has been implicated in hematopoietic differentiation and the formation of myeloid malignancies when mutated. An ideal system to study the role of Tet2 in myelopoeisis is CEBPα-induced transdifferentiation of pre-B cells into macrophages. Here we found that CEBPα binds to upstream regions of Tet2 and that the gene becomes activated. Tet2 knockdowns impaired the upregulation of macrophage markers as well as phagocytic capacity, suggesting that the enzyme is required for both early and late stage myeloid differentiation. A slightly weaker effect was seen in primary cells with a Tet2 ablation. Expression arrays of transdifferentiating cells with Tet2 knockdowns permitted the identification of a small subset of myeloid genes whose upregulation was blunted. Activation of these target genes was accompanied by rapid increases of promoter hydroxy-methylation. Our observations indicate that Tet2 helps CEBPα rapidly derepress myeloid genes during the conversion of pre-B cells into macrophages.

Abstract: Summary
Iron is an essential cofactor with unique redox properties. Iron-regulatory proteins 1 and 2 (IRP1/2) have been established as important regulators of cellular iron homeostasis, but little is known about the role of other pathways in this process. Here we report that the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulates iron homeostasis by modulating transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) stability and altering cellular iron flux. Mechanistic studies identify tristetraprolin (TTP), a protein involved in anti-inflammatory response, as the downstream target of mTOR that binds to and enhances degradation of TfR1 mRNA. We also show that TTP is strongly induced by iron chelation, promotes downregulation of iron-requiring genes in both mammalian and yeast cells, and modulates survival in low-iron states. Taken together, our data uncover a link between metabolic, inflammatory, and iron-regulatory pathways, and point toward the existence of a yeast-like TTP-mediated iron conservation program in mammals.

Abstract: Summary
We report that t(1;19) ALL cells universally exhibit expression of and dependence on the cell surface receptor ROR1. We further identify t(1;19) ALL cell sensitivity to the kinase inhibitor dasatinib due to its inhibition of the pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) signaling complex. These phenotypes are a consequence of developmental arrest at an intermediate/late stage of B-lineage maturation. Additionally, inhibition of pre-BCR signaling induces further ROR1 upregulation, and we identify distinct ROR1 and pre-BCR downstream signaling pathways that are modulated in a counterbalancing manner—both leading to AKT phosphorylation. Consistent with this, AKT phosphorylation is transiently eliminated after dasatinib treatment, but is partially restored following dasatinib potentiation of ROR1 expression. Consequently, ROR1 silencing accentuates dasatinib killing of t(1;19) ALL cells.

Abstract: Summary
Microglia are the primary immune cells in the brain. Under physiological conditions, they typically stay in a “resting” state, with ramified processes continuously extending to and retracting from surrounding neural tissues. Whether and how such highly dynamic resting microglia functionally interact with surrounding neurons are still unclear. Using in vivo time-lapse imaging of both microglial morphology and neuronal activity in the optic tectum of larval zebrafish, we found that neuronal activity steers resting microglial processes and facilitates their contact with highly active neurons. This process requires the activation of pannexin-1 hemichannels on neurons. Reciprocally, such resting microglia-neuron contact reduces both spontaneous and visually evoked activities of contacted neurons. Our findings reveal an instructive role for neuronal activity in resting microglial motility and suggest the function for microglia in homeostatic regulation of neuronal activity in the healthy brain.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin interactions play important roles in transcription regulation. To better understand the underlying evolutionary and functional constraints of these interactions, we implemented a systems approach to examine RNA polymerase-II-associated chromatin interactions in human cells. We found that 40% of the total genomic elements involved in chromatin interactions converged to a giant, scale-free-like, hierarchical network organized into chromatin communities. The communities were enriched in specific functions and were syntenic through evolution. Disease-associated SNPs from genome-wide association studies were enriched among the nodes with fewer interactions, implying their selection against deleterious interactions by limiting the total number of interactions, a model that we further reconciled using somatic and germline cancer mutation data. The hubs lacked disease-associated SNPs, constituted a nonrandomly interconnected core of key cellular functions, and exhibited lethality in mouse mutants, supporting an evolutionary selection that favored the nonrandom spatial clustering of the least-evolving key genomic domains against random genetic or transcriptional errors in the genome. Altogether, our analyses reveal a systems-level evolutionary framework that shapes functionally compartmentalized and error-tolerant transcriptional regulation of human genome in three dimensions.

Abstract: Summary
Cell organization requires motor-dependent transport of specific cargos along cytoskeletal elements. How the delivery cycle is coordinated with other events is poorly understood. Here we define the in vivo delivery cycle of myosin-V in its essential function of secretory vesicle transport along actin cables in yeast. We show that myosin-V is activated by binding a secretory vesicle and that myosin-V mutations that compromise vesicle binding render the motor constitutively active. About ten motors associate with each secretory vesicle for rapid transport to sites of cell growth. Once transported, the motors remain associated with the secretory vesicles until they undergo exocytosis. Motor release is temporally regulated by vesicle-bound Rab-GTP hydrolysis and requires vesicle tethering by the exocyst complex but does not require vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. All components of this transport cycle are conserved in vertebrates, so these results should be generally applicable to other myosin-V delivery cycles.

An Analogue of Resveratrol HS-1793 Exhibits Anticancer Activity Against MCF-7 Cells Via Inhibition of Mitochondrial Biogenesis Gene Expression,

Abstract: Resveratrol is a phytoalexin and polyphenol derived from grapes, berries, and peanuts. It has been shown to mediate death of a wide variety of cancer cells. Although resveratrol is considered an important potential chemotherapeutic agent, it is required at high doses to achieve a biologically or physiologically significant effect, which may be impractical for treating cancer. Thus, a more stable and potent derivative of resveratrol, with more effective tumoricidal activity, must be developed. A novel resveratrol analog, HS-1793, has recently been synthesized and was determined to exhibit a greater decrease in cancer cell viability than resveratrol. However, the underlying mechanism of HS-1793-induced cancer cell death remains unknown. We thus investigated the mechanism by which HS-1793 induces cell death and assessed whether this occurs through a mitochondrial-mediated mechanism. Using the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, we determined that HS-1793 treatment significantly increased cell death at a relatively low dose compared with resveratrol. HS-1793 treatment more significantly decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, cellular ATP concentration, and cellular oxygen consumption rate than resveratrol treatment. At the molecular level, HS-1793 treatment down-regulated the expression of major mitochondrial biogenesis-regulating proteins, including mitochondrial transcriptional factor A (TFAM), Tu translation elongation factor (TUFM), and single-stranded DNA-binding protein. We conclude that HS-1793 acts by regulating the expression of TFAM and TUFM, leading to a block in normal mitochondrial function, which sensitizes cancer cells to cell death. We therefore propose that HS-1793 can be a useful chemosensitization agent, which together with other such agents can efficiently target cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
Oncogenic Myc alters mitochondrial metabolism, making it dependent on exogenous glutamine (Gln) for cell survival. Accordingly, Gln deprivation selectively induces apoptosis in MYC-overexpressing cells via unknown mechanisms. Using MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma as a model, we identify PUMA, NOXA, and TRB3 as executors of Gln-starved cells. Gln depletion in MYC-transformed cells induces apoptosis through ATF4-dependent, but p53-independent, PUMA and NOXA induction. MYC-transformed cells depend on both glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase and glutamate dehydrogenase to maintain Gln homeostasis and suppress apoptosis. Consequently, either ATF4 agonists or glutaminolysis inhibitors potently induce apoptosis in vitro and inhibit tumor growth in vivo. These results reveal mechanisms whereby Myc sensitizes cells to apoptosis, and validate ATF4 agonists and inhibitors of Gln metabolism as potential Myc-selective cancer therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
To ensure equal chromosome segregation during mitosis, the macromolecular kinetochore must remain attached to depolymerizing microtubules, which drive chromosome movements. How kinetochores associate with depolymerizing microtubules, which undergo dramatic structural changes forming curved protofilaments, has yet to be defined in vertebrates. Here, we demonstrate that the conserved kinetochore-localized Ska1 complex tracks with depolymerizing microtubule ends and associates with both the microtubule lattice and curved protofilaments. In contrast, the Ndc80 complex, a central player in the kinetochore-microtubule interface, binds only to the straight microtubule lattice and lacks tracking activity. We demonstrate that the Ska1 complex imparts its tracking capability to the Ndc80 complex. Finally, we present a structure of the Ska1 microtubule-binding domain that reveals its interaction with microtubules and its regulation by Aurora B. This work defines an integrated kinetochore-microtubule interface formed by the Ska1 and Ndc80 complexes that associates with depolymerizing microtubules, potentially by interacting with curved microtubule protofilaments.

Abstract: Summary
Fluorescence can be harnessed to monitor microbial fate and to investigate functional outcomes of individual microbial cell-host cell encounters at portals of entry in native tissue environments. We illustrate this concept by introducing fluorescent Aspergillus reporter (FLARE) conidia that simultaneously report phagocytic uptake and fungal viability during cellular interactions with the murine respiratory innate immune system. Our studies using FLARE conidia reveal stepwise and cell-type-specific requirements for CARD9 and Syk, transducers of C-type lectin receptor and integrin signals, in neutrophil recruitment, conidial uptake, and conidial killing in the lung. By achieving single-event resolution in defined leukocyte populations, the FLARE method enables host cell profiling on the basis of pathogen uptake and killing and may be extended to other pathogens in diverse model host organisms to query molecular, cellular, and pharmacologic mechanisms that shape host-microbe interactions.

Abstract: Summary
A two-step, automated, high-throughput RNAi silencing screen was used to identify host cell factors required during vaccinia virus infection. Validation and analysis of clustered hits revealed previously unknown processes during virus entry, including a mechanism for genome uncoating. Viral core proteins were found to be already ubiquitinated during virus assembly. After entering the cytosol of an uninfected cell, the viral DNA was released from the core through the activity of the cell’s proteasomes. Next, a Cullin3-based ubiquitin ligase mediated a further round of ubiquitination and proteasome action. This was needed in order to initiate viral DNA replication. The results accentuate the value of large-scale RNAi screens in providing directions for detailed cell biological investigation of complex pathways. The list of cell functions required during poxvirus infection will, moreover, provide a resource for future virus-host cell interaction studies and for the discovery of antivirals.

Abstract: Quantitative RNA analyses of autopsy materials to diagnose the cause and mechanism of death are challenging tasks in the field of forensic molecular pathology. Alterations in mRNA profiles can be induced by cellular stress responses during supravital reactions as well as by lethal insults at the time of death. Here, we demonstrate that several gene transcripts encoding heat shock proteins (HSPs), a gene family primarily responsible for cellular stress responses, can be differentially expressed in the occipital region of postmortem human cerebral cortices with regard to the cause of death. HSPA2 mRNA levels were higher in subjects who died due to mechanical asphyxiation (ASP), compared with those who died by traumatic injury (TI). By contrast, HSPA7 and A13 gene transcripts were much higher in the TI group than in the ASP and sudden cardiac death (SCD) groups. More importantly, relative abundances between such HSP mRNA species exhibit a stronger correlation to, and thus provide more discriminative information on, the death process than does routine normalization to a housekeeping gene. Therefore, the present study proposes alterations in HSP mRNA composition in the occipital lobe as potential forensic biological markers, which may implicate the cause and process of death.

Abstract: Summary
The E. coli chromosome is condensed into insulated regions termed macrodomains (MDs), which are essential for genomic packaging. How chromosomal MDs are specifically organized and compacted is unknown. Here, we report studies revealing the molecular basis for Terminus-containing (Ter) chromosome condensation by the Ter-specific factor MatP. MatP contains a tripartite fold with a four-helix bundle DNA-binding motif, ribbon-helix-helix and C-terminal coiled-coil. Strikingly, MatP-matS structures show that the MatP coiled-coils form bridged tetramers that flexibly link distant matS sites. Atomic force microscopy and electron microscopy studies demonstrate that MatP alone loops DNA. Mutation of key coiled-coil residues destroys looping and causes a loss of Ter condensation in vivo. Thus, these data reveal the molecular basis for a protein-mediated DNA-bridging mechanism that mediates condensation of a large chromosomal domain in enterobacteria.

Abstract: c-Met, the high affinity receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), is one of the most frequently activated tyrosine kinases in many human cancers and a target for cancer therapy. However, inhibitory targeting of c-Met with antibodies has proven difficult, because most antibodies have intrinsic agonist activity. Therefore, the strategy for reducing the agonism is critical for successful development of cancer therapies based on anti-c-Met antibodies. Here we developed a mechanism-based assay method for rapid screening of anti-c-Met antibodies, involving the determination of Akt phosphorylation and c-Met degradation for agonism and efficacy, respectively. Using the method, we identified an antibody, F46, that binds to human c-Met with high affinity (Kd = 2.56 nM) and specificity, and induces the degradation of c-Met in multiple cancer cells (including MKN45, a gastric cancer cell line) with minimal activation of c-Met signaling. F46 induced c-Met internalization in both HGF-dependent and HGF-independent cells, suggesting that the degradation of c-Met results from antibody-mediated receptor internalization. Furthermore, F46 competed with HGF for binding to c-Met, resulting in the inhibition of both HGF-mediated invasion and angiogenesis. Consistently, F46 inhibited the proliferation of MKN45 cells, in which c-Met is constitutively activated in an HGF-independent manner. Xenograft analysis revealed that F46 markedly inhibits the growth of subcutaneously implanted gastric and lung tumors. These results indicate that F46, identified by a novel mechanism-based assay, induces c-Met degradation with minimal agonism, implicating a potential role of F46 in therapy of human cancers.

Abstract: Circadian clock genes are regulated by a transcriptional-translational feedback loop. In Arabidopsis, LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) and CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) transcripts are highly expressed in the morning. Translated LHY and CCA1 proteins repress the expression of TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 (TOC1),which peaks in the evening. TOC1 protein induces expression of LHY and CCA1, forming a negative feedback loop which is believed to constitute the oscillatory mechanism of the clock. The rhythmic oscillation of mouse clock genes mPERIOD 1 (mPER1) and mPER2 has been correlated with regular alteration of chromatin structure through histone acetylation/deacetylation. However, little is known about the relationship between the transcriptional activity of Arabidopsis clock genes and their chromatin status. Here, we report that histone H3 acetylation (H3Ac) and H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3) levels at LHY, CCA1,and TOC1 are positively correlated with the rhythmic transcript levels of these genes, whereas H3K36me2 level shows a negative correlation. Thus, our study suggests rhythmic transcription of Arabidopsis clock genes might be regulated by rhythmic histone modification, and it provides a platform for future identification of clock-controlling histone modifiers.

Abstract: Summary
Endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane (ER-PM) junctions are conserved structures defined as regions of the ER that tightly associate with the plasma membrane. However, little is known about the mechanisms that tether these organelles together and why such connections are maintained. Using a quantitative proteomic approach, we identified three families of ER-PM tethering proteins in yeast: Ist2 (related to mammalian TMEM16 ion channels), the tricalbins (Tcb1/2/3, orthologs of the extended synaptotagmins), and Scs2 and Scs22 (vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated proteins). Loss of all six tethering proteins results in the separation of the ER from the PM and the accumulation of cytoplasmic ER. Importantly, we find that phosphoinositide signaling is misregulated at the PM, and the unfolded protein response is constitutively activated in the ER in cells lacking ER-PM tether proteins. These results reveal critical roles for ER-PM contacts in cell signaling, organelle morphology, and ER function.

Abstract: Summary
The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway plays critical roles in metazoan development and in cancer. How the Hh ligand is secreted and spreads to distant cells is unclear, given its covalent modification with a hydrophobic cholesterol molecule, which makes it stick to membranes. We demonstrate that Hh ligand secretion from vertebrate cells is accomplished via two distinct and synergistic cholesterol-dependent binding events, mediated by two proteins that are essential for vertebrate Hh signaling: the membrane protein Dispatched (Disp) and a member of the Scube family of secreted proteins. Cholesterol modification is sufficient for a heterologous protein to interact with Scube and to be secreted in a Scube-dependent manner. Disp and Scube recognize different structural aspects of cholesterol similarly to how Niemann-Pick disease proteins 1 and 2 interact with cholesterol, suggesting a hand-off mechanism for transferring Hh from Disp to Scube. Thus, Disp and Scube cooperate to dramatically enhance the secretion and solubility of the cholesterol-modified Hh ligand.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear IKKα regulates gene transcription by phosphorylating specific substrates and has been linked to cancer progression and metastasis. However, the mechanistic connection between tumorigenesis and IKKα activity remains poorly understood. We have now analyzed 288 human colorectal cancer samples and found a significant association between the presence of nuclear IKK and malignancy. Importantly, the nucleus of tumor cells contains an active IKKα isoform with a predicted molecular weight of 45 kDa (p45-IKKα) that includes the kinase domain but lacks several regulatory regions. Active nuclear p45-IKKα forms a complex with nonactive IKKα and NEMO that mediates phosphorylation of SMRT and histone H3. Proteolytic cleavage of FL-IKKα into p45-IKKα is required for preventing the apoptosis of CRC cells in vitro and sustaining tumor growth in vivo. Our findings identify a potentially druggable target for treating patients with advance refractory CRC.

GADD45G Functions in Male Sex Determination by Promoting p38 Signaling and Sry Expression,

Abstract: Summary
Male sex determination in mammals is induced by Sry, a gene whose regulation is poorly understood. Here we show that mice mutant for the stress-response gene Gadd45g display complete male-to-female sex reversal. Gadd45g and Sry have a strikingly similar expression pattern in the genital ridge, and they are coexpressed in gonadal somatic cells. In Gadd45g mutants, Sry expression is delayed and reduced, and yet Sry seemed to remain poised for expression, because its promoter is demethylated on schedule and is occupied by active histone marks. Instead, p38 MAPK signaling is impaired in Gadd45g mutants. Moreover, the transcription factor GATA4, which is required for Sry expression, binds to the Sry promoter in vivo in a MAPK-dependent manner. The results suggest that a signaling cascade, involving GADD45G → p38 MAPK → GATA4 → SRY, regulates male sex determination.

Abstract: Summary
Fossil data suggest that limbs evolved from fish fins by sequential elaboration of their distal endoskeleton, giving rise to the autopod close to the tetrapod origin. This elaboration may have occurred by a simultaneous reduction of the distal ectodermal fold of fish fins. Modulation of 5′Hoxd gene transcription, through tetrapod-specific digit enhancers, has been suggested as a possible evolutionary mechanism involved in these morphological transformations. Here, we overexpress hoxd13a in zebrafish to investigate the impact of increasing 5′Hoxd expression during fin development. This overexpression causes increased proliferation, distal expansion of chondrogenic tissue and finfold reduction. In addition, we also show that the tetrapod-specific 5′Hoxd enhancer CsC promotes similar expression in zebrafish fins and mouse limbs. Our results support the idea that modulation of 5′Hoxd gene expression, by acquisition of novel enhancer elements, offered the substrate for the evolution of fins and the origin of tetrapod limbs.

Abstract: Summary
Gene-distal enhancers are critical for tissue-specific gene expression, but their genomic determinants within a specific lineage at different stages of development are unknown. Here we profile chromatin state maps, transcription factor occupancy, and gene expression profiles during human erythroid development at fetal and adult stages. Comparative analyses of human erythropoiesis identify developmental stage-specific enhancers as primary determinants of stage-specific gene expression programs. We find that erythroid master regulators GATA1 and TAL1 act cooperatively within active enhancers but confer little predictive value for stage specificity. Instead, a set of stage-specific coregulators collaborates with master regulators and contributes to differential gene expression. We further identify and validate IRF2, IRF6, and MYB as effectors of an adult-stage expression program. Thus, the combinatorial assembly of lineage-specific master regulators and transcriptional coregulators within developmental stage-specific enhancers determines gene expression programs and temporal regulation of transcriptional networks in a mammalian genome.

Abstract: Summary
Tumors successfully adapt to constantly changing intra- and extracellular environments, but the wirings of this process are still largely elusive. Here, we show that heat-shock-protein-90-directed protein folding in mitochondria, but not cytosol, maintains energy production in tumor cells. Interference with this process activates a signaling network that involves phosphorylation of nutrient-sensing AMP-activated kinase, inhibition of rapamycin-sensitive mTOR complex 1, induction of autophagy, and expression of an endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response. This signaling network confers a survival and proliferative advantage to genetically disparate tumors, and correlates with worse outcome in lung cancer patients. Therefore, mitochondrial heat shock protein 90s are adaptive regulators of tumor bioenergetics and tractable targets for cancer therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Gametes are among the most highly specialized cells produced during development. Although gametogenesis culminates in transcriptional quiescence in plants and animals, regulatory mechanisms controlling this are unknown. Here, we confirm that gamete differentiation in the single-celled yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is accompanied by global transcriptional shutoff following the completion of meiosis. We show that Jhd2, a highly conserved JARID1-family histone H3K4 demethylase, activates protein-coding gene transcription in opposition to this programmed transcriptional shutoff, sustaining the period of productive transcription during spore differentiation. Moreover, using genome-wide nucleosome, H3K4me, and transcript mapping experiments, we demonstrate that JHD2 globally represses intergenic noncoding transcription during this period. The widespread transcriptional defects of JHD2 mutants are associated with precocious differentiation and the production of stress-sensitive spores, demonstrating that Jhd2 regulation of the global postmeiotic transcriptional program is critical for the production of healthy meiotic progeny.

Abstract: Summary
Energy release from cellular storage is mandatory for survival during fasting. This is achieved through lipolysis and liver gluconeogenesis. We show here that in the mouse, gut-derived serotonin (GDS) is upregulated during fasting and that it favors both mechanisms. In adipocytes, GDS signals through the Htr2b receptor to favor lipolysis by increasing phosphorylation and activity of hormone-sensitive lipase. In hepatocytes, GDS signaling through Htr2b promotes gluconeogenesis by enhancing activity of two rate-limiting gluconeogenic enzymes, FBPase and G6Pase. In addition, GDS signaling in hepatocytes prevents glucose uptake in a Glut2-dependent manner, thereby further favoring maintenance of blood glucose levels. As a result, inhibition of GDS synthesis can improve glucose intolerance caused by high-fat diet. Hence, GDS opposes deleterious consequences of food deprivation by favoring lipolysis and liver gluconeogenesis while preventing glucose uptake by hepatocytes. As a result, pharmacological inhibition of its synthesis may contribute to improve type 2 diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
Direct detection of circulating nutrients by the central nervous system has been implicated in the regulation of energy balance, and the mediobasal hypothalamus is considered as the primary sensing site mediating these effects. Neurons sensitive to energy-related signals have also been identified outside the hypothalamus, particularly within the caudomedial nucleus of the solitary tract (cmNTS) in brainstem, but the consequences of direct cmNTS nutrient detection on energy balance remain poorly characterized. Here we determined the behavioral and metabolic consequences of direct L-leucine detection by the cmNTS and investigated the intracellular signaling and neurochemical pathways implicated in cmNTS L-leucine sensing in rats. Our results support the distributed nature of central nutrient detection, evidence a role for the cmNTS S6K1 pathway in the regulation of meal size and body weight, and suggest that the cmNTS integrates direct cmNTS nutrient detection with gut-derived, descending forebrain, and adiposity signals of energy availability to regulate food intake.

Abstract: Summary
A significant portion of the genome is transcribed as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), several of which are known to control gene expression. The repertoire and regulation of lncRNAs in disease-relevant tissues, however, has not been systematically explored. We report a comprehensive strand-specific transcriptome map of human pancreatic islets and β cells, and uncover >1100 intergenic and antisense islet-cell lncRNA genes. We find islet lncRNAs that are dynamically regulated and show that they are an integral component of the β cell differentiation and maturation program. We sequenced the mouse islet transcriptome and identify lncRNA orthologs that are regulated like their human counterparts. Depletion of HI-LNC25, a β cell-specific lncRNA, downregulated GLIS3 mRNA, thus exemplifying a gene regulatory function of islet lncRNAs. Finally, selected islet lncRNAs were dysregulated in type 2 diabetes or mapped to genetic loci underlying diabetes susceptibility. These findings reveal a new class of islet-cell genes relevant to β cell programming and diabetes pathophysiology.

Abstract: CD38, an ADP ribosyl cyclase, is a 45 kDa type II transmembrane protein having a short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain and a long C-terminal extracellular domain, expressed on the surface of various cells including macrophages, lymphocytes, and pancreatic β cells. It is known to be involved in cell adhesion, signal transduction and calcium signaling. In addition to its transmembrane form, CD38 is detectable in biological fluids in soluble forms. The mechanism by which CD38 is solubilized from the plasma membrane is not yet clarified. In this study, we found that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced CD38 upregulation and its extracellular release in J774 macrophage cells. Furthermore, it also increased CD38 expression at the mRNA level by activating the Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway. However, LPS decreased the levels of CD38 in the plasma membrane by releasing CD38 into the culture supernatant. LPS-induced CD38 release was blocked by the metalloproteinase-9 inhibitor indicating that MMP-9 solubilizes CD38. In conclusion, the present findings demonstrate a potential mechanism by which C38 is solubilized from the plasma membrane.

Abstract: Summary
Senescence is a cellular response preventing tumorigenesis. The Ras oncogene is frequently activated or mutated in human cancers, but Ras activation is insufficient to transform primary cells. In a search for cooperating oncogenes, we identify the lysine demethylase JMJD2A/KDM4A. We show that JMJD2A functions as a negative regulator of Ras-induced senescence and collaborates with oncogenic Ras to promote cellular transformation by negatively regulating the p53 pathway. We find CHD5, a known tumor suppressor regulating p53 activity, as a target of JMJD2A. The expression of JMJD2A inhibits Ras-mediated CHD5 induction leading to a reduced activity of the p53 pathway. In addition, we show that JMJD2A is overexpressed in mouse and human lung cancers. Depletion of JMJD2A in the human lung cancer cell line A549 bearing an activated K-Ras allele triggers senescence. We propose that JMJD2A is an oncogene that represents a target for Ras-expressing tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Triplex structure-forming GAA/TTC repeats pose a dual threat to the eukaryotic genome integrity. Their potential to expand can lead to gene inactivation, the cause of Friedreich’s ataxia disease in humans. In model systems, long GAA/TTC tracts also act as chromosomal fragile sites that can trigger gross chromosomal rearrangements. The mechanisms that regulate the metabolism of GAA/TTC repeats are poorly understood. We have developed an experimental system in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that allows us to systematically identify genes crucial for maintaining the repeat stability. Two major groups of mutants defective in DNA replication or transcription initiation are found to be prone to fragility and large-scale expansions. We demonstrate that problems imposed by the repeats during DNA replication in actively dividing cells and during transcription initiation in nondividing cells can culminate in genome instability. We propose that similar mechanisms can mediate detrimental metabolism of GAA/TTC tracts in human cells.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatic glucose production (HGP) maintains blood glucose levels during fasting but can also exacerbate diabetic hyperglycemia. HGP is dynamically controlled by a signaling/transcriptional network that regulates the expression/activity of gluconeogenic enzymes. A key mediator of gluconeogenic gene transcription is PGC-1α. PGC-1α's activation of gluconeogenic gene expression is dependent upon its acetylation state, which is controlled by the acetyltransferase GCN5 and the deacetylase Sirt1. Nevertheless, whether other chromatin modifiers—particularly other sirtuins—can modulate PGC-1α acetylation is currently unknown. Herein, we report that Sirt6 strongly controls PGC-1α acetylation. Surprisingly, Sirt6 induces PGC-1α acetylation and suppresses HGP. Sirt6 depletion decreases PGC-1α acetylation and promotes HGP. These acetylation effects are GCN5 dependent: Sirt6 interacts with and modifies GCN5, enhancing GCN5's activity. Leprdb/db mice, an obese/diabetic animal model, exhibit reduced Sirt6 levels; ectopic re-expression suppresses gluconeogenic genes and normalizes glycemia. Activation of hepatic Sirt6 may therefore be therapeutically useful for treating insulin-resistant diabetes.

Regulation of Endocytic Clathrin Dynamics by Cargo Ubiquitination,

Abstract: Summary
Some endocytic cargoes control clathrin-coated pit (CCP) maturation, but it is not known how such regulation is communicated. We found that μ-opioid neuropeptide receptors signal to their enclosing CCPs by ubiquitination. Nonubiquitinated receptors delay CCPs at an intermediate stage of maturation, after clathrin lattice assembly is complete but before membrane scission. Receptor ubiquitination relieves this inhibition, effectively triggering CCP scission and producing a receptor-containing endocytic vesicle. The ubiquitin modification that conveys this endocytosis-promoting signal is added to the receptor’s first cytoplasmic loop, catalyzed by the Smurf2 ubiquitin ligase, and coordinated with activation-dependent receptor phosphorylation and clustering through Smurf2 recruitment by the endocytic adaptor beta-arrestin. Epsin1 detects the signal at the CCP and is required for ubiquitin-promoted scission. This cargo-to-coat communication system mediates a biochemical checkpoint that ensures appropriate receptor ubiquitination for later trafficking, and it controls specific receptor loading into CCPs by sensing when a sufficient quorum is reached.

Abstract: Summary
It is unclear how cancer cells coordinate glycolysis and biosynthesis to support rapidly growing tumors. We found that the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1), commonly upregulated in human cancers due to loss of TP53, contributes to biosynthesis regulation in part by controlling intracellular levels of its substrate, 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG), and product, 2-phosphoglycerate (2-PG). 3-PG binds to and inhibits 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase in the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), while 2-PG activates 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase to provide feedback control of 3-PG levels. Inhibition of PGAM1 by shRNA or a small molecule inhibitor PGMI-004A results in increased 3-PG and decreased 2-PG levels in cancer cells, leading to significantly decreased glycolysis, PPP flux and biosynthesis, as well as attenuated cell proliferation and tumor growth.

Abstract: Summary
Elimination of aberrantly folded polypeptides from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) system promotes cell survival under stress conditions. This quality control mechanism requires movement of misfolded proteins across the ER membrane for targeting to the cytosolic proteasome, a process facilitated by a “holdase” complex, consisting of Bag6 and the cofactors Ubl4A and Trc35. This multiprotein complex also participates in several other protein quality control processes. Here, we report SGTA as a component of the Bag6 system, which cooperates with Bag6 to channel dislocated ERAD substrates that are prone to aggregation. Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and biochemical assays, we demonstrate that SGTA contains a noncanonical ubiquitin-like-binding domain that interacts specifically with an unconventional ubiquitin-like protein/domain in Ubl4A at least in part via electrostatics. This interaction helps recruit SGTA to Bag6, enhances substrate loading to Bag6, and thus prevents the formation of nondegradable protein aggregates in ERAD.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic evidence indicates that Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sgs1, Top3, and Rmi1 resolve topologically linked intermediates arising from DNA replication and recombination. Using purified proteins, we show that Sgs1, Top3, Rmi1, and replication protein A (RPA) coordinate catenation and decatenation of dsDNA through sequential passage of single strands of DNA, establishing a unique pathway for dsDNA decatenation in eukaryotic cells. Sgs1 is required for dsDNA unwinding and, unexpectedly, also has a structural role in DNA strand passage. RPA promotes DNA unwinding by Sgs1 by trapping ssDNA, and it stimulates DNA strand passage by Top3. Paradoxically, Rmi1 has a unique regulatory capacity that slows DNA relaxation by Top3 but stimulates DNA decatenation. We establish that Rmi1 stabilizes the “open” Top3-DNA covalent complex formed as a transient intermediate of strand passage. This concerted activity of the Sgs1-Top3-Rmi1-RPA represents an important mechanism for disentangling structures resulting from the topological features of duplex DNA.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells are often undesired targets of chemotherapies, leading to hematopoietic suppression requiring careful clinical management. Whether microRNAs control hematopoietic injury response is largely unknown. We report an in vivo gain-of-function screen and the identification of miR-150 as an inhibitor of hematopoietic recovery upon 5-fluorouracil-induced injury. Utilizing a bone marrow transplant model with a barcoded microRNA library, we screened for barcode abundance in peripheral blood of recipient mice before and after 5-fluorouracil treatment. Overexpression of screen-candidate miR-150 resulted in significantly slowed recovery rates across major blood lineages, with associated impairment of bone marrow clonogenic potential. Conversely, platelets and myeloid cells from miR-150 null marrow recovered faster after 5-fluorouracil treatment. Heterozygous knockout of c-myb, a conserved target of miR-150, partially phenocopied miR-150-forced expression. Our data highlight the role of microRNAs in controlling hematopoietic injury response and demonstrate the power of in vivo functional screens for studying microRNAs in normal tissue physiology.

Abstract: A series of histochemical procedures were employed to localise and characterise glycoprotein (GP) classes produced by the epithelial cells, the type A and the type B mucous goblet cells (MGCs) and the club cells in the epidermis of Labeo rohita. The epithelial cells secreted GPs with oxidizable vicinal diols and GPs with sialic acid residues without O-acyl substitution in low concentrations. The type A MGCs and the type B MGCs, in contrast, produced these GPs in high concentrations. Further, these MGCs produced GPs with O-sulphate esters as well. GPs with O-sulphate esters were produced in high concentration by the type A MGCs and in low concentration by the type B MGCs. The club cells produced GPs with oxidizable vicinal diols in trace amounts. Production of more than one type of GPs suggested a basis for functional discrimination in their role in the mucous secretions at the skin surface. This is considered an adaptation to environment inhabited by the fish and is discussed in relation to their role in lubrication, protection and inhibition of the invasion and proliferation of pathogenic micro-organisms.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular injury causes a myriad of processes that affect proteostasis. We describe nucleocytoplasmic coagulation (NCC), an intracellular disulfide-dependent protein crosslinking event occurring upon late-stage cell death that orchestrates the proteolytic removal of misfolded proteins. In vitro and in vivo models of neuronal injury show that NCC involves conversion of soluble intracellular proteins, including tubulin, into insoluble oligomers. These oligomers, also seen in human brain tissue following neurotrauma, act as a cofactor and substrate for the plasminogen-activating system. In plasminogen−/− mice, levels of misfolded β-tubulin were elevated and its clearance delayed following neurotrauma, demonstrating a requirement for plasminogen in the removal of NCC constituents. While additional in vivo studies will further dissect this phenomenon, our study clearly shows that NCC, a process analogous to the formation of thrombi, generates an aggregated protein scaffold that limits release of cellular components and recruits clearance mechanisms to the site of injury.

Abstract: Summary
Satb1 and Satb2 have been recently described as regulators of embryonic stem (ES) cell pluripotency and as silencing factors in X chromosome inactivation. The influence of the pluripotency machinery on X chromosome inactivation and the lack of an X chromosome inactivation defect in Satb1−/− and Satb2−/− mice raise the question of whether or not Satb proteins are directly and/or redundantly involved in this process. Here, we analyzed X chromosome inactivation in fibroblastic cells that were derived from female Satb1−/−Satb2−/− embryos. By fluorescence in situ hybridization to visualize Xist RNA and by immunohistochemistry to detect H3K27me3 histone modifications, we found that female Satb1−/−Satb2−/− fibroblastic cells contain proper Barr bodies. Moreover, we did not detect an upregulation of X-linked genes, suggesting that Satb proteins are dispensable for X chromosome inactivation in mice.

Abstract: Summary
Packaging of DNA into nucleosomes and the formation of higher-order chromatin structures determine DNA accessibility and activity of genome domains. We identified an RNA-dependent mechanism maintaining the open chromatin structure within euchromatic regions in Drosophila cells. The mechanism of reversible chromatin opening, reconstituted in vitro, depends on the Drosophila decondensation factor 31 (Df31) that specifically binds to RNA and localizes to euchromatic regions. Df31 is capable to tether a heterogeneous pool of short, single-stranded RNAs to chromatin. This class of chromatin-associated RNA (caRNA) is stably linked to chromatin and is largely composed of snoRNAs, which are preferentially bound by Df31. We suggest that the Df31-mediated linkage of snoRNAs and chromatin, forms a RNA-chromatin network resulting in the establishment of open chromatin domains. Analysis of caRNAs in human cells also reveals a strong enrichment of snoRNAs, implying a conserved role for these molecules in higher-order structures of chromatin.

Abstract: Summary
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) thiol oxidases initiate a disulfide relay to oxidatively fold secreted proteins. We found that combined loss-of-function mutations in genes encoding the ER thiol oxidases ERO1α, ERO1β, and PRDX4 compromised the extracellular matrix in mice and interfered with the intracellular maturation of procollagen. These severe abnormalities were associated with an unexpectedly modest delay in disulfide bond formation in secreted proteins but a profound, 5-fold lower procollagen 4-hydroxyproline content and enhanced cysteinyl sulfenic acid modification of ER proteins. Tissue ascorbic acid content was lower in mutant mice, and ascorbic acid supplementation improved procollagen maturation and lowered sulfenic acid content in vivo. In vitro, the presence of a sulfenic acid donor accelerated the oxidative inactivation of ascorbate by an H2O2-generating system. Compromised ER disulfide relay thus exposes protein thiols to competing oxidation to sulfenic acid, resulting in depletion of ascorbic acid, impaired procollagen proline 4-hydroxylation, and a noncanonical form of scurvy.

Abstract: Summary
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is implicated in converting stationary epithelial tumor cells into motile mesenchymal cells during metastasis. However, the involvement of EMT in metastasis is still controversial, due to the lack of a mesenchymal phenotype in human carcinoma metastases. Using a spontaneous squamous cell carcinoma mouse model, we show that activation of the EMT-inducing transcription factor Twist1 is sufficient to promote carcinoma cells to undergo EMT and disseminate into blood circulation. Importantly, in distant sites, turning off Twist1 to allow reversion of EMT is essential for disseminated tumor cells to proliferate and form metastases. Our study demonstrates in vivo the requirement of “reversible EMT” in tumor metastasis and may resolve the controversy on the importance of EMT in carcinoma metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) integrates signals from nutrients and insulin via two distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. Disruption of mTORC2 impairs the insulin-induced activation of Akt, an mTORC2 substrate. Here, we found that mTORC2 can also regulate insulin signaling at the level of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). Despite phosphorylation at the mTORC1-mediated serine sites, which supposedly triggers IRS-1 downregulation, inactive IRS-1 accumulated in mTORC2-disrupted cells. Defective IRS-1 degradation was due to attenuated expression and phosphorylation of the ubiquitin ligase substrate-targeting subunit, Fbw8. mTORC2 stabilizes Fbw8 by phosphorylation at Ser86, allowing the insulin-induced translocation of Fbw8 to the cytosol where it mediates IRS-1 degradation. Thus, mTORC2 negatively feeds back to IRS-1 via control of Fbw8 stability and localization. Our findings reveal that in addition to persistent mTORC1 signaling, heightened mTORC2 signals can promote insulin resistance due to mTORC2-mediated degradation of IRS-1.

Abstract: Summary
The inherent cytotoxicity of aberrantly folded protein aggregates contributes substantially to the pathogenesis of amyloid diseases. It was recently shown that a class of evolutionary conserved proteins, called MOAG-4/SERF, profoundly alter amyloid toxicity via an autonomous but yet unexplained mode. We show that the biological function of human SERF1a originates from its atypical ability to specifically distinguish between amyloid and nonamyloid aggregation. This inherently unstructured protein directly affected the aggregation kinetics of a broad range of amyloidogenic proteins in vitro, while being inactive against nonamyloid aggregation. A representative biophysical analysis of the SERF1a:α-synuclein (aSyn) complex revealed that the amyloid-promoting activity resulted from an early and transient interaction, which was sufficient to provoke a massive increase of soluble aSyn amyloid nucleation templates. Therefore, the autonomous amyloid-modifying activity of SERF1a observed in living organisms relies on a direct and dedicated manipulation of the early stages in the amyloid aggregation pathway.

Abstract: Summary
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) guide RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) that contains an Argonaute family protein to complementary target messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Via RISC, miRNAs silence the expression of target mRNAs by shortening the poly(A) tail—which leads to mRNA decay—and by repressing translation. It has been suggested that GW182, an Argonaute-associating protein, plays the central role in such microRNA actions. Here we show that, although GW182 is obligatory for poly(A) shortening, translational repression by microRNAs occurs even in the absence of GW182. Yet, GW182 is also capable of inducing translational repression independently. Both of these translational repression mechanisms block formation of 48S and 80S ribosomal complexes. Thus microRNAs utilize at least three distinct silencing pathways: GW182-mediated deadenylation and GW182-dependent and -independent repression of early translation initiation. Differential contribution from these multiple pathways may explain previous, apparently contradictory observations of how microRNAs inhibit protein synthesis.

Abstract: Summary
The T7 phage-encoded small protein Gp2 is a non-DNA-binding transcription factor that interacts with the jaw domain of the Escherichia coli (Ec) RNA polymerase (RNAp) β′ subunit and inhibits transcriptionally proficient promoter-complex (RPo) formation. Here, we describe the high-resolution solution structure of the Gp2-Ec β′ jaw domain complex and show that Gp2 and DNA compete for binding to the β′ jaw domain. We reveal that efficient inhibition of RPo formation by Gp2 requires the amino-terminal σ70 domain region 1.1 (R1.1), and that Gp2 antagonizes the obligatory movement of R1.1 during RPo formation. We demonstrate that Gp2 inhibits RPo formation not just by steric occlusion of the RNAp-DNA interaction but also through long-range antagonistic effects on RNAp-promoter interactions around the RNAp active center that likely occur due to repositioning of R1.1 by Gp2. The inhibition of Ec RNAp by Gp2 thus defines a previously uncharacterized mechanism by which bacterial transcription is regulated by a viral factor.

Abstract: Summary
Vertebrate body segmentation is controlled by the segmentation clock, a molecular oscillator involving transcriptional oscillations of cyclic genes in presomitic mesoderm cells. The rapid and highly dynamic nature of this oscillating system has proved challenging for study at the single-cell level. We achieved visualization of clock activity with a cellular level of resolution in living embryos, allowing direct comparison of oscillations in neighbor cells. We provide direct evidence that presomitic mesoderm cells oscillate asynchronously in zebrafish Notch pathway mutants. By tracking oscillations in mitotic cells, we reveal that a robust cell-autonomous, Notch-independent mechanism resumes oscillations after mitosis. Finally, we find that cells preferentially divide at a certain oscillation phase, likely reducing the noise generated by cell division in cell synchrony and suggesting an intriguing relationship between the mitotic cycle and clock oscillation.

Abstract: Summary
Inflammation can promote or inhibit cancer progression. In this study we have addressed the role of the proinflammatory cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) during skin carcinogenesis. Using conditional loss- and gain-of-function mouse models for Notch and Wnt signaling, respectively, we demonstrate that TSLP-mediated inflammation protects against cutaneous carcinogenesis by acting directly on CD4 and CD8 T cells. Genetic ablation of TSLP receptor (TSLPR) perturbs T-cell-mediated protection and results in the accumulation of CD11b+Gr1+ myeloid cells. These promote tumor growth by secreting Wnt ligands and augmenting β-catenin signaling in the neighboring epithelium. Epithelial specific ablation of β-catenin prevents both carcinogenesis and the accumulation of CD11b+Gr1+ myeloid cells, suggesting tumor cells initiate a feed-forward loop that induces protumorigenic inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
MicroRNAs typically function at the level of posttranscriptional gene silencing within the cytoplasm; however, increasing evidence suggests that they may also function in nuclear, Argonaut-containing complexes, to directly repress target gene transcription. We have investigated the role of microRNAs in mediating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses. ER stress triggers the activation of three signaling molecules: Ire-1α/β, PERK, and ATF6, whose function is to facilitate adaption to the ensuing stress. We demonstrate that PERK induces miR-211, which in turn attenuates stress-dependent expression of the proapoptotic transcription factor chop/gadd153. MiR-211 directly targets the proximal chop/gadd153 promoter, where it increases histone methylation and represses chop expression. Maximal chop accumulation ultimately correlates with miR-211 downregulation. Our data suggest a model in which PERK-dependent miR-211 induction prevents premature chop accumulation and thereby provides a window of opportunity for the cell to re-establish homeostasis prior to apoptotic commitment.

Abstract: Summary
Vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin homophilic adhesion controls endothelial barrier permeability through assembly of adherens junctions (AJs). We observed that loss of VE-cadherin-mediated adhesion induced the activation of Src and phospholipase C (PLC)γ2, which mediated Ca2+ release from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores, resulting in activation of calcineurin (CaN), a Ca2+-dependent phosphatase. Downregulation of CaN activity induced phosphorylation of serine 162 in end binding (EB) protein 3. This phospho-switch was required to destabilize the EB3 dimer, suppress microtubule (MT) growth, and assemble AJs. The phospho-defective S162A EB3 mutant, in contrast, induced MT growth in confluent endothelial monolayers and disassembled AJs. Thus, VE-cadherin outside-in signaling regulates cytosolic Ca2+ homeostasis and EB3 phosphorylation, which are required for assembly of AJs. These results identify a pivotal function of VE-cadherin homophilic interaction in modulating endothelial barrier through the tuning of MT dynamics.

Abstract: Pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP) is the biologically active form of vitamin B6and is de novo synthesized from three substrates, dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), riburose 5-phosphate (RBP), and ammonia hydrolysed from glutamine. Glutamine amidotransferase (PdxT) catalyzes the production of ammonia from glutamine, while PdxS catalyzes the following condensation of ribulose 5-phosphate (Ru5P), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), and ammonia. PdxS exists as a hexamer or dodecamer depending on species and makes a 1:1 complex with PdxT. Pyrococcus horikoshii PdxS has a 37 amino acids insertion region, which is found in some archaeal PdxS proteins, but its structure and function are unknown. To provide further structural information on the role of the insertion region, the oligomeric state, and ligand binding mode of P. horikoshii PdxS, the crystal structure of PdxS from P. horikoshii was solved in two forms: (i) apo form, (ii) ribose 5-phosphate (R5P) complex and the quaternary structure of PdxS in solution was determined by analytical gel filtration. P. horikoshii PdxS forms hexamer in solution based on analytical gel filtration data. When we superimpose the structure of P. horikoshii PdxS with other dodecamer structures of PdxS, the additional insertion is located apart from the active site and induces a steric clash on the hexamer-hexamer interface of PdxS proteins. Our results suggest that the additional insertion perturbs dodecamer formation of P. horikoshii PdxS.

Abstract: Summary
Apical actomyosin activity in animal epithelial cells influences tissue morphology and drives morphogenetic movements during development. The molecular mechanisms leading to myosin II accumulation at the apical membrane and its exclusion from other membranes are poorly understood. We show that in the nonmetazoan Dictyostelium discoideum, myosin II localizes apically in tip epithelial cells that surround the stalk, and constriction of this epithelial tube is required for proper morphogenesis. IQGAP1 and its binding partner cortexillin I function downstream of α- and β-catenin to exclude myosin II from the basolateral cortex and promote apical accumulation of myosin II. Deletion of IQGAP1 or cortexillin compromises epithelial morphogenesis without affecting cell polarity. These results reveal that apical localization of myosin II is a conserved morphogenetic mechanism from nonmetazoans to vertebrates and identify a hierarchy of proteins that regulate the polarity and organization of an epithelial tube in a simple model organism.

Abstract: Summary
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), including embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells, are potentially useful in regenerative therapies for heart disease. For medical applications, clinical-grade cardiac cells must be produced from hPSCs in a defined, cost-effective manner. Cell-based screening led to the discovery of KY02111, a small molecule that promotes differentiation of hPSCs to cardiomyocytes. Although the direct target of KY02111 remains unknown, results of the present study suggest that KY02111 promotes differentiation by inhibiting WNT signaling in hPSCs but in a manner that is distinct from that of previously studied WNT inhibitors. Combined use of KY02111 and WNT signaling modulators produced robust cardiac differentiation of hPSCs in a xeno-free, defined medium, devoid of serum and any kind of recombinant cytokines and hormones, such as BMP4, Activin A, or insulin. The methodology has potential as a means for the practical production of human cardiomyocytes for regeneration therapies.

Abstract: Summary
In the mouse liver, circadian transcriptional rhythms are necessary for metabolic homeostasis. Whether dynamic epigenomic modifications are associated with transcript oscillations has not been systematically investigated. We found that several antisense RNA, lincRNA, and microRNA transcripts also showed circadian oscillations in adult mouse livers. Robust transcript oscillations often correlated with rhythmic histone modifications in promoters, gene bodies, or enhancers, although promoter DNA methylation levels were relatively stable. Such integrative analyses identified oscillating expression of an antisense transcript (asPer2) to the gene encoding the circadian oscillator component Per2. Robust transcript oscillations often accompanied rhythms in multiple histone modifications and recruitment of multiple chromatin-associated clock components. Coupling of cycling histone modifications with nearby oscillating transcripts thus established a temporal relationship between enhancers, genes, and transcripts on a genome-wide scale in a mammalian liver. The results offer a framework for understanding the dynamics of metabolism, circadian clock, and chromatin modifications involved in metabolic homeostasis.

Abstract: Cerebellar granule neurons migrate from the external granule cell layer (EGL) to the internal granule cell layer (IGL) during postnatal morphogenesis. This migration process through 4 different layers is a complex mechanism which is highly regulated by many secreted proteins. Although chemokines are well-known peptides that trigger cell migration, but with the exception of CXCL12, which is responsible for prenatal EGL formation, their functions have not been thoroughly studied in granule cell migration. In the present study, we examined cerebellar CXCL14 expression in neonatal and adult mice. CXCL14 mRNA was expressed at high levels in adult mouse cerebellum, but the protein was not detected. Nevertheless, Western blotting analysis revealed transient expression of CXCL14 in the cerebellum in early postnatal days (P1, P8), prior to the completion of granule cell migration. Looking at the distribution of CXCL14 by immunohistochemistry revealed a strong immune reactivity at the level of the Purkinje cell layer and molecular layer which was absent in the adult cerebellum. In functional assays, CXCL14 stimulated transwell migration of cultured granule cells and enhanced the spreading rate of neurons from EGL microexplants. Taken together, these results revealed the transient expression of CXCL14 by Purkinje cells in the developing cerebellum and demonstrate the ability of the chemokine to stimulate granule cell migration, suggesting that it must be involved in the postnatal maturation of the cerebellum.

Abstract: Summary
D-cyclins represent components of cell cycle machinery. To test the efficacy of targeting D-cyclins in cancer treatment, we engineered mouse strains that allow acute and global ablation of individual D-cyclins in a living animal. Ubiquitous shutdown of cyclin D1 or inhibition of cyclin D-associated kinase activity in mice bearing ErbB2-driven mammary carcinomas triggered tumor cell senescence, without compromising the animals’ health. Ablation of cyclin D3 in mice bearing Notch1-driven T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL) triggered tumor cell apoptosis. Such selective killing of leukemic cells can also be achieved by inhibiting cyclin D associated kinase activity in mouse and human T-ALL models. Inhibition of cyclin D-kinase activity represents a highly-selective anticancer strategy that specifically targets cancer cells without significantly affecting normal tissues.

Abstract: Summary
D-type cyclins form complexes with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK4/6) and promote cell cycle progression. Although cyclin D functions appear largely tissue specific, we demonstrate that cyclin D3 has unique functions in lymphocyte development and cannot be replaced by cyclin D2, which is also expressed during blood differentiation. We show that only combined deletion of p27Kip1 and retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (Rb) is sufficient to rescue the development of Ccnd3−/− thymocytes. Furthermore, we show that a small molecule targeting the kinase function of cyclin D3:CDK4/6 inhibits both cell cycle entry in human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and disease progression in animal models of T-ALL. These studies identify unique functions for cyclin D3:CDK4/6 complexes and suggest potential therapeutic protocols for this devastating blood tumor.

Abstract: Summary
We established a collection of 7,000 transgenic lines of Drosophila melanogaster. Expression of GAL4 in each line is controlled by a different, defined fragment of genomic DNA that serves as a transcriptional enhancer. We used confocal microscopy of dissected nervous systems to determine the expression patterns driven by each fragment in the adult brain and ventral nerve cord. We present image data on 6,650 lines. Using both manual and machine-assisted annotation, we describe the expression patterns in the most useful lines. We illustrate the utility of these data for identifying novel neuronal cell types, revealing brain asymmetry, and describing the nature and extent of neuronal shape stereotypy. The GAL4 lines allow expression of exogenous genes in distinct, small subsets of the adult nervous system. The set of DNA fragments, each driving a documented expression pattern, will facilitate the generation of additional constructs for manipulating neuronal function.

Abstract: Summary
The fidelity of chromosome segregation depends on the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). In the presence of unattached kinetochores, anaphase is delayed when three SAC components (Mad2, Mad3/BubR1, and Bub3) inhibit Cdc20, the activating subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C). We analyzed the role of Cdc20 autoubiquitination in the SAC of budding yeast. Reconstitution with purified components revealed that a Mad3-Bub3 complex synergizes with Mad2 to lock Cdc20 on the APC/C and stimulate Cdc20 autoubiquitination, while inhibiting ubiquitination of substrates. SAC-dependent Cdc20 autoubiquitination required the Mnd2/Apc15 subunit of the APC/C. General inhibition of Cdc20 ubiquitination in vivo resulted in high Cdc20 levels and a failure to establish a SAC arrest, suggesting that SAC establishment depends on low Cdc20 levels. Specific inhibition of SAC-dependent ubiquitination, by deletion of Mnd2, allowed establishment of a SAC arrest but delayed release from the arrest, suggesting that Cdc20 ubiquitination is also required for SAC inactivation.

Abstract: Summary
Complete dissociation of sister chromatid cohesion and subsequent induction of poleward movement of disjoined sisters are two essential events underlying chromosome segregation; however, how cells coordinate these two processes is not well understood. Here, we developed a fluorescence-based sensor for the protease separase that mediates cohesin cleavage. We found that separase undergoes an abrupt activation shortly before anaphase onset in the vicinity of chromosomes. This activation profile of separase depends on the abilities of two of its binding proteins, securin and cyclin B1, to inhibit its protease activity and target it to chromosomes. Subsequent to its proteolytic activation, separase then binds to and inhibits a subset of cyclin B1-cdk1, which antagonizes cdk1-mediated phosphorylation on chromosomes and facilitates poleward movement of sisters in anaphase. Therefore, by consecutively acting as a protease and a cdk1 inhibitor, separase coordinates two key processes to achieve simultaneous and abrupt separation of sister chromatids.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin diminution is the programmed elimination of specific DNA sequences during development. It occurs in diverse species, but the function(s) of diminution and the specificity of sequence loss remain largely unknown. Diminution in the nematode Ascaris suum occurs during early embryonic cleavages and leads to the loss of germline genome sequences and the formation of a distinct genome in somatic cells. We found that ∼43 Mb (∼13%) of genome sequence is eliminated in A. suum somatic cells, including ∼12.7 Mb of unique sequence. The eliminated sequences and location of the DNA breaks are the same in all somatic lineages from a single individual and between different individuals. At least 685 genes are eliminated. These genes are preferentially expressed in the germline and during early embryogenesis. We propose that diminution is a mechanism of germline gene regulation that specifically removes a large number of genes involved in gametogenesis and early embryogenesis.

Abstract: We previously showed that silencing of NbBPS1 encoding an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized protein results in pleiotrophic developmental defects and cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana [Kang et al. (2008)]. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of the cell death caused by NbBPS1 silencing. Affected leaf cells exhibited morphological markers of programmed cell death (PCD) and accumulated excessive amounts of reactive oxygen species. NbBPS1 silencing caused dramatic induction of the ER stress marker genes BiP-like protein (BLP) genes, HSP70,and Bax Inhibitor-1. Furthermore, NbBPS1 deficiency led to relocalization of bZIP28 transcription factor from the ER membrane to the nucleus, similar to the bZIP28 relocalization during tunicamycin-induced ER stress. Abnormal accumulation of vesicles and increased autophagy activity were also observed in the affected leaf cells. These results suggest that inactivation of NbBPS1 function in the ER leads to ER stress, autophagy, and PCD activation in N. benthamiana.

Abstract: Summary
Little is known about the mechanisms governing neonatal growth and maturation of organs. Here we demonstrate that calcineurin/Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells (Cn/NFAT) signaling regulates neonatal pancreatic development in mouse and human islets. Inactivation of calcineurin b1 (Cnb1) in mouse islets impaired dense core granule biogenesis, decreased insulin secretion, and reduced cell proliferation and mass, culminating in lethal diabetes. Pancreatic β cells lacking Cnb1 failed to express genes revealed to be direct NFAT targets required for replication, insulin storage, and secretion. In contrast, glucokinase activation stimulated Cn-dependent expression of these genes. Calcineurin inhibitors, such as tacrolimus, used for human immunosuppression, induce diabetes. Tacrolimus exposure reduced Cn/NFAT-dependent expression of factors essential for insulin dense core granule formation and secretion and neonatal β cell proliferation, consistent with our genetic studies. Discovery of conserved pathways regulating β cell maturation and proliferation suggests new strategies for controlling β cell growth or replacement in human islet diseases.

Abstract: Ghrelin, the endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor, has been found in the cerebellum of many vertebrates and in the gastrointestinal tract of African ostrich chicks, but little is known about its distribution in the cerebellum of the African ostrich. In the present study, the distribution and morphological characteristics of ghrelin-producing cells in the cerebellum of the African ostrich were investigated using immunohistochemistry. The results indicate that the cerebellum is divided into two sections: the outer cerebellar cortex and the inner medulla of cerebellum. The cerebellar cortex comprises a molecular layer, a Purkinje cell layer and a granular layer; ghrelin-immunopositive (ghrelin-ip) cells were localized throughout the entire cerebellum, but sparsely in the medulla. The greatest number of ghrelin-ip cells was found in the stratum granulosum, and the density decreased gradually from the molecular layer to the Purkinje cell layer in the cerebellar cortex. The ghrelin-ip cells were fusiform or irregular polygons and their cytoplasm was stained intensely. These results clearly demonstrate the presence of ghrelin-ip cells in the cerebellum of the African ostrich. It is speculated that ghrelin may have a physiological function in the cerebellum.

Abstract: Summary
Caloric restriction (CR) mitigates many detrimental effects of aging and prolongs life span. CR has been suggested to increase mitochondrial biogenesis, thereby attenuating age-related declines in mitochondrial function, a concept that is challenged by recent studies. Here we show that lifelong CR in mice prevents age-related loss of mitochondrial oxidative capacity and efficiency, measured in isolated mitochondria and permeabilized muscle fibers. We find that these beneficial effects of CR occur without increasing mitochondrial abundance. Whole-genome expression profiling and large-scale proteomic surveys revealed expression patterns inconsistent with increased mitochondrial biogenesis, which is further supported by lower mitochondrial protein synthesis with CR. We find that CR decreases oxidant emission, increases antioxidant scavenging, and minimizes oxidative damage to DNA and protein. These results demonstrate that CR preserves mitochondrial function by protecting the integrity and function of existing cellular components rather than by increasing mitochondrial biogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The migration of cortical interneurons is characterized by extensive morphological changes that result from successive cycles of nucleokinesis and neurite branching. Their molecular bases remain elusive, and the present work describes how p27Kip1 controls cell-cycle-unrelated signaling pathways to regulate these morphological remodelings. Live imaging reveals that interneurons lacking p27Kip1 show delayed tangential migration resulting from defects in both nucleokinesis and dynamic branching of the leading process. At the molecular level, p27Kip1 is a microtubule-associated protein that promotes polymerization of microtubules in extending neurites, thereby contributing to tangential migration. Furthermore, we show that p27Kip1 controls actomyosin contractions that drive both forward translocation of the nucleus and growth cone splitting. Thus, p27Kip1 cell-autonomously controls nucleokinesis and neurite branching by regulating both actin and microtubule cytoskeletons.

Abstract: The regulation of Ca2+ release by luminal Ca2+ has been well studied for the ryanodine and IP3 receptors but has been less clear for the NAADP-regulated channel. In view of conflicting reports, we have re-examined the issue by manipulating luminal Ca2+ with the membrane-permeant, low affinity Ca2+ buffer, TPEN, and monitoring NAADP-induced Ca2+ release in sea urchin egg homogenate. NAADP-induced Ca2+ release was almost entirely blocked by TPEN (IC50 17–25μM) which suppressed the maximal extent of Ca2+ release without altering NAADP sensitivity. In contrast, Ca2+ release via IP3 receptors was 3- to 30-fold less sensitive to TPEN whereas that evoked by ionomycin was essentially unaffected. The effect of TPEN on NAADP-induced Ca2+ release was not due to an increase in the luminal pH or chelation of trace metals since it could not be mimicked by NH4Cl or phenanthroline. The fact that TPEN had no effect upon ionophore-induced Ca2+ release also argued against a substantial reduction in the driving force for Ca2+ efflux. We propose that, in the sea urchin egg, luminal Ca2+ is important for gating native NAADP-regulated two-pore channels.

Abstract: Summary
Chronic activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and p70 S6 kinase (S6K) in response to hypernutrition contributes to obesity-associated metabolic pathologies, including hepatosteatosis and insulin resistance. Sestrins are stress-inducible proteins that activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and suppress mTORC1-S6K activity, but their role in mammalian physiology and metabolism has not been investigated. We show that Sestrin2—encoded by the Sesn2 locus, whose expression is induced upon hypernutrition—maintains metabolic homeostasis in liver of obese mice. Sesn2 ablation exacerbates obesity-induced mTORC1-S6K activation, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and hepatosteatosis, all of which are reversed by AMPK activation. Furthermore, concomitant ablation of Sesn2 and Sesn3 provokes hepatic mTORC1-S6K activation and insulin resistance even in the absence of nutritional overload and obesity. These results demonstrate an important homeostatic function for the stress-inducible Sestrin protein family in the control of mammalian lipid and glucose metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
JMJD3 (KDM6B) antagonizes Polycomb silencing by demethylating lysine 27 on histone H3. The interplay of methyltransferases and demethylases at this residue is thought to underlie critical cell fate transitions, and the dynamics of H3K27me3 during neurogenesis posited for JMJD3 a critical role in the acquisition of neural fate. Despite evidence of its involvement in early neural commitment, however, its role in the emergence and maturation of the mammalian CNS remains unknown. Here, we inactivated Jmjd3 in the mouse and found that its loss causes perinatal lethality with the complete and selective disruption of the pre-Bötzinger complex (PBC), the pacemaker of the respiratory rhythm generator. Through genetic and electrophysiological approaches, we show that the enzymatic activity of JMJD3 is selectively required for the maintenance of the PBC and controls critical regulators of PBC activity, uncovering an unanticipated role of this enzyme in the late structuring and function of neuronal networks.

Abstract: Summary
Generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is a process whose mechanistic underpinnings are only beginning to emerge. Here, we applied in-depth quantitative proteomics to monitor proteome changes during the course of reprogramming of fibroblasts to iPSCs. We uncover a two-step resetting of the proteome during the first and last 3 days of reprogramming, with multiple functionally related proteins changing in expression in a highly coordinated fashion. This comprised several biological processes, including changes in the stoichiometry of electron transport-chain complexes, repressed vesicle-mediated transport during the intermediate stage, and an EMT-like process in the late phase. In addition, we demonstrate that the nucleoporin Nup210 is essential for reprogramming by its permitting of rapid cellular proliferation and subsequent progression through MET. Along with the identification of proteins expressed in a stage-specific manner, this study provides a rich resource toward an enhanced mechanistic understanding of cellular reprogramming.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells provides energy and multiple intermediates critical for cell growth. Hypoxia in tumors represents a hostile environment that can encourage these transformations. We report that glycogen metabolism is upregulated in tumors in vivo and in cancer cells in vitro in response to hypoxia. In vitro, hypoxia induced an early accumulation of glycogen, followed by a gradual decline. Concordantly, glycogen synthase (GYS1) showed a rapid induction, followed by a later increase of glycogen phosphorylase (PYGL). PYGL depletion and the consequent glycogen accumulation led to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels that contributed to a p53-dependent induction of senescence and markedly impaired tumorigenesis in vivo. Metabolic analyses indicated that glycogen degradation by PYGL is important for the optimal function of the pentose phosphate pathway. Thus, glycogen metabolism is a key pathway induced by hypoxia, necessary for optimal glucose utilization, which represents a targetable mechanism of metabolic adaptation.

Abstract: Summary
The ABCA1 protein mediates the transfer of cellular cholesterol across the plasma membrane to apolipoprotein A-I. Loss-of-function mutations in the ABCA1 gene induce Tangier disease and familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia, both cardiovascular conditions characterized by abnormally low levels of serum cholesterol, increased cholesterol in macrophages, and subsequent formation of vascular plaque. Increased intracellular cholesterol levels are also frequently found in cancer cells. Here, we demonstrate anticancer activity of ABCA1 efflux function, which is compromised following inhibition of ABCA1 gene expression by oncogenic mutations or cancer-specific ABCA1 loss-of-function mutations. In concert with elevated cholesterol synthesis found in cancer cells, ABCA1 deficiency allows for increased mitochondrial cholesterol, inhibits release of mitochondrial cell death-promoting molecules, and thus facilitates cancer cell survival, suggesting that elevated mitochondrial cholesterol is essential to the cancer phenotype.

Abstract: Summary
By diversifying the biological effector functions of antibodies, class switch DNA recombination (CSR) plays a critical role in the maturation of the immune response. It is initiated by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)-mediated deoxycytosine deamination, yielding deoxyuridine (dU), and dU glycosylation by uracil DNA glycosylase (Ung) in antibody switch (S) region DNA. Here we showed that the translesion DNA synthesis polymerase Rev1 directly interacted with Ung and targeted in an AID-dependent and Ung-independent fashion the S regions undergoing CSR. Rev1−/− Ung+/+ B cells reduced Ung recruitment to S regions, DNA-dU glycosylation, and CSR. Together with an S region spectrum of mutations similar to that of Rev1+/+ Ung−/− B cells, this suggests that Rev1 operates in the same pathway as Ung, as emphasized by further decreased CSR in Rev1−/− Msh2−/− B cells. Rescue of CSR in Rev1−/− B cells by a catalytically inactive Rev1 mutant shows that the important role of Rev1 in CSR is mediated by Rev1’s scaffolding function, not its enzymatic function.

Abstract: Xenopus laevis oocytes exposed to amyloid-β aggregate generated oscillatory electric activity (blips) that was recorded by two-microelectrode voltage-clamp. The cells exhibited a series of “spontaneous” blips ranging in amplitude from 3.8 ± 0.9 nA at the beginning of the recordings to 6.8 ± 1.7 nA after 15 min of exposure to 1 μM aggregate. These blips were similar in amplitude to those induced by the channel-forming antimicrobial agents amphotericin B (7.8 ± 1.2 nA) and gramicidin (6.3 ± 1.1 nA). The amyloid aggregate-induced currents were abolished when extracellular Ca2+was removed from the bathing solution, suggesting a central role for this cation in generating the spontaneous electric activity. The amyloid aggregate also affected the Ca2+-dependent Cl-currents of oocytes, as shown by increased amplitude of the transient-outward chloride current (Tout) and the serum-activated, oscillatory Cl-currents. Electron microcopy revealed that amyloid aggregate induced the dissociation of the follicular cells that surround the oocyte, thus leading to a failure in the electro-chemical communication between these cells. This was also evidenced by the suppression of the oscillatory Ca2+-dependent ATP-currents, which require proper coupling between oocytes and the follicular cell layer. These observations, made using the X. laevis oocytes as a versatile experimental model, may help to understand the effects of amyloid aggregate on cellular communication.

Abstract: Summary
Many cellular proteins perform their roles within macromolecular assemblies. Hence, an understanding of how these multiprotein complexes form is a fundamental question in cell biology. We developed a translation-controlled pulse-chase system that allows time-resolved isolation of newly forming multiprotein complexes in chemical quantities suitable for biochemical and cell biological analysis. The “pulse” is triggered by an unnatural amino acid, which induces immediate translation of an amber stop codon repressed mRNA encoding the protein of interest with a built-in tag for detection and purification. The “chase” is elicited by stopping translation of this bait via a riboswitch in the respective mRNA. Over the course of validating our method, we discovered a distinct time-resolved assembly step during NPC biogenesis and could directly monitor the spatiotemporal maturation of preribosomes via immunofluorescence detection and purification of a pulse-labeled ribosomal protein. Thus, we provide an innovative strategy to study dynamic protein assembly within cellular networks.

Abstract: Summary
Widespread changes in gene expression drive tumorigenesis, yet our knowledge of how aberrant epigenomic and transcriptome profiles arise in cancer cells is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that metabolic transformation plays an important role. Butyrate is the primary energy source of normal colonocytes and is metabolized to acetyl-CoA, which was shown to be important not only for energetics but also for HAT activity. Due to the Warburg effect, cancerous colonocytes rely on glucose as their primary energy source, so butyrate accumulated and functioned as an HDAC inhibitor. Although both mechanisms increased histone acetylation, different target genes were upregulated. Consequently, butyrate stimulated the proliferation of normal colonocytes and cancerous colonocytes when the Warburg effect was prevented from occurring, whereas it inhibited the proliferation of cancerous colonocytes undergoing the Warburg effect. These findings link a common metabolite to epigenetic mechanisms that are differentially utilized by normal and cancerous cells because of their inherent metabolic differences.

Abstract: Summary
Over 6,000 fragments from the genome of Drosophila melanogaster were analyzed for their ability to drive expression of GAL4 reporter genes in the third-instar larval imaginal discs. About 1,200 reporter genes drove expression in the eye, antenna, leg, wing, haltere, or genital imaginal discs. The patterns ranged from large regions to individual cells. About 75% of the active fragments drove expression in multiple discs; 20% were expressed in ventral, but not dorsal, discs (legs, genital, and antenna), whereas ∼23% were expressed in dorsal but not ventral discs (wing, haltere, and eye). Several patterns, for example, within the leg chordotonal organ, appeared a surprisingly large number of times. Unbiased searches for DNA sequence motifs suggest candidate transcription factors that may regulate enhancers with shared activities. Together, these expression patterns provide a valuable resource to the community and offer a broad overview of how transcriptional regulatory information is distributed in the Drosophila genome.

Abstract: Summary
BRAFV600E drives tumors by dysregulating ERK signaling. In these tumors, we show that high levels of ERK-dependent negative feedback potently suppress ligand-dependent mitogenic signaling and Ras function. BRAFV600E activation is Ras independent and it signals as a RAF-inhibitor-sensitive monomer. RAF inhibitors potently inhibit RAF monomers and ERK signaling, causing relief of ERK-dependent feedback, reactivation of ligand-dependent signal transduction, increased Ras-GTP, and generation of RAF-inhibitor-resistant RAF dimers. This results in a rebound in ERK activity and culminates in a new steady state, wherein ERK signaling is elevated compared to its initial nadir after RAF inhibition. In this state, ERK signaling is RAF inhibitor resistant, and MEK inhibitor sensitive, and combined inhibition results in enhancement of ERK pathway inhibition and antitumor activity.

Abstract: Summary
In a screen designed to identify novel inducers of autophagy, we discovered that STAT3 inhibitors potently stimulate the autophagic flux. Accordingly, genetic inhibition of STAT3 stimulated autophagy in vitro and in vivo, while overexpression of STAT3 variants, encompassing wild-type, nonphosphorylatable, and extranuclear STAT3, inhibited starvation-induced autophagy. The SH2 domain of STAT3 was found to interact with the catalytic domain of the eIF2α kinase 2 EIF2AK2, best known as protein kinase R (PKR). Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of STAT3 stimulated the activating phosphorylation of PKR and consequent eIF2α hyperphosphorylation. Moreover, PKR depletion inhibited autophagy as initiated by chemical STAT3 inhibitors or free fatty acids like palmitate. STAT3-targeting chemicals and palmitate caused the disruption of inhibitory STAT3-PKR interactions, followed by PKR-dependent eIF2α phosphorylation, which facilitates autophagy induction. These results unravel an unsuspected mechanism of autophagy control that involves STAT3 and PKR as interacting partners.

Abstract: Thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) is a member of the pyridine nucleotide-disulfide reductase family, which mainly functions in the thioredoxin system. TrxR is found in all living organisms and exists in two major ubiquitous isoenzymes in higher eukaryotic cells; One is cytosolic and the other mitochondrial. Mitochondrial TrxR functions to protect mitochondria from oxidative stress, where reactive oxidative species are mainly generated, while cytosolic TrxR plays a role to maintain optimal oxido-reductive status in cytosol. In this study, we report differential physiological functions of these two TrxRs in C. elegans. trxr-1, the cytosolic TrxR, is highly expressed in pharynx, vulva and intestine, whereas trxr-2, the mitochondrial TrxR, is mainly expressed in pharyngeal and body wall muscles. Deficiency of the non-selenoprotein trxr-2 caused defects in longevity and delayed development under stress conditions, while deletion mutation of the selenoprotein trxr-1 resulted in interference in acidification of lysosomal compartment in intestine. Interestingly, the acidification defect of trxr-1(jh143) deletion mutant was rescued, not only by selenocystein-containing wild type TRXR-1, but also cysteine-substituted mutant TRXR-1. Both trxr-1 and trxr-2 were up-regulated when worms were challenged by environmental stress such as heat shock. These results suggest that trxr-1 and trxr-2 function differently at organismal level presumably by their differential sub-cellular localization in C. elegans.

Abstract: Summary
Eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis requires hundreds of trans-acting factors and dozens of RNAs. Although most factors required for ribosome biogenesis have been identified, little is known about their regulation. Here, we reveal that the yeast deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp10 is localized to the nucleolus and that ubp10Δ cells have reduced pre-rRNAs, mature rRNAs, and translating ribosomes. Through proteomic analyses, we found that Ubp10 interacts with proteins that function in rRNA production and ribosome biogenesis. In particular, we discovered that the largest subunit of RNA polymerase I (RNAPI) is stabilized via Ubp10-mediated deubiquitination and that this is required in order to achieve optimal levels of ribosomes and cell growth. USP36, the human ortholog of Ubp10, complements the ubp10Δ allele for RNAPI stability, pre-rRNA processing, and cell growth in yeast, suggesting that deubiquitination of RNAPI may be conserved in eukaryotes. Our work implicates Ubp10/USP36 as a key regulator of rRNA production through control of RNAPI stability.

Abstract: Summary
DNA methylation, mediated by the combined action of three DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B), is essential for mammalian development and is a major contributor to cellular transformation. To elucidate how DNA methylation is targeted, we mapped the genome-wide localization of all DNMTs and methylation, and examined the relationships among these markers, histone modifications, and nucleosome structure in a pluripotent human tumor cell line in its undifferentiated and differentiated states. Our findings reveal a strong link between DNMTs and transcribed loci, and that DNA methylation is not a simple sum of DNMT localization patterns. A comparison of the epigenomes of normal and cancerous stem cells, and pluripotent and differentiated states shows that the presence of at least two DNMTs is strongly associated with loci targeted for DNA hypermethylation. Taken together, these results shed important light on the determinants of DNA methylation and how it may become disrupted in cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
Bortezomib therapy has proven successful for the treatment of relapsed/refractory, relapsed, and newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM); however, dose-limiting toxicities and the development of resistance limit its long-term utility. Here, we show that P5091 is an inhibitor of deubiquitylating enzyme USP7, which induces apoptosis in MM cells resistant to conventional and bortezomib therapies. Biochemical and genetic studies show that blockade of HDM2 and p21 abrogates P5091-induced cytotoxicity. In animal tumor model studies, P5091 is well tolerated, inhibits tumor growth, and prolongs survival. Combining P5091 with lenalidomide, HDAC inhibitor SAHA, or dexamethasone triggers synergistic anti-MM activity. Our preclinical study therefore supports clinical evaluation of USP7 inhibitor, alone or in combination, as a potential MM therapy.

Abstract: Summary
The molecular chaperone Hsp90 is a hub of protein homeostasis and regulatory circuitry. Hsp90 function is regulated by posttranslational modifications including acetylation in mammals; however, whether this regulation is conserved remains unknown. In fungi, Hsp90 governs the evolution of drug resistance by stabilizing signal transducers. Here, we establish that pharmacological inhibition of lysine deacetylases (KDACs) blocks the emergence and maintenance of Hsp90-dependent resistance to the most widely deployed antifungals, the azoles, in the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans and the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. S. cerevisiae Hsp90 is acetylated on lysine 27 and 270, and key KDACs for drug resistance are Hda1 and Rpd3. Compromising KDACs alters stability and function of Hsp90 client proteins, including the drug-resistance regulator calcineurin. Thus, we establish acetylation as a mechanism of posttranslational control of Hsp90 function in fungi, functional redundancy between KDACs Hda1 and Rpd3, as well as a mechanism governing fungal drug resistance with broad therapeutic potential.

Here, transcriptome profiling and differentiation assay revealed a requirement of PARG for retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-mediated transcription. Mechanistically, PARG accumulates early at promoters of RAR-responsive genes upon retinoic acid treatment to promote the formation of an appropriate chromatin environment suitable for transcription. Silencing of PARG or knockout of its enzymatic activity maintains the H3K9me2 mark at the promoter of the RAR-dependent genes, leading to the absence of preinitiation complex formation. In the absence of PARG, we found that the H3K9 demethylase KDM4D/JMJD2D became PARsylated. Mutation of two glutamic acids located in the Jumonji N domain of KDM4D inhibited PARsylation. PARG becomes dispensable for ligand-dependent transcription when either a PARP inhibitor or a non-PARsylable KDM4D/JMJD2D mutant is used. Our results define PARG as a coactivator regulating chromatin remodeling during RA-dependent gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we describe the embryonic central nervous system expression of 5,000 GAL4 lines made using molecularly defined cis-regulatory DNA inserted into a single attP genomic location. We document and annotate the patterns in early embryos when neurogenesis is at its peak, and in older embryos where there is maximal neuronal diversity and the first neural circuits are established. We note expression in other tissues, such as the lateral body wall (muscle, sensory neurons, and trachea) and viscera. Companion papers report on the adult brain and larval imaginal discs, and the integrated data sets are available online (http://www.janelia.org/gal4-gen1). This collection of embryonically expressed GAL4 lines will be valuable for determining neuronal morphology and function. The 1,862 lines expressed in small subsets of neurons (<20/segment) will be especially valuable for characterizing interneuronal diversity and function, because although interneurons comprise the majority of all central nervous system neurons, their gene expression profile and function remain virtually unexplored.

Abstract: The hematopoietic cell malignancy is one of the most prevalent type of cancer and the disease has multiple pathologic molecular signatures. Research on the origin of hematopoietic cancer stem cells and the mode of subsequent maintenance and differentiation needs robust animal models that can reproduce the transformation and differentiation event in vivo. Here, we show that co-transduction of MYC and PIM2 proto-oncogenes into mouse bone marrow cells readily establishes permanent cell lines that can induce lethal myeloid sarcoma in vivo. Unlike the previous doubly transgenic mouse model in which coexpression of MYC and PIM2 transgenes exclusively induced B cell lymphoma, we were able to show that the same combination of genes can also transform primary bone marrow myeloid cells in vitro resulting in permanent cell lines which induce myeloid sarcoma upon in vivo transplantation. By inducing cancerous transformation of fresh bone marrow cells in a controlled environment, the model we established will be useful for detailed study of the molecular events involved in initial transformation process of primary myeloid bone marrow cells and provides a model that can give insight to the molecular pathologic characteristics of human myeloid sarcoma, a rare presentation of solid tumors of undifferentiated myeloid blast cells associated with various types of myeloid leukemia.

Abstract: Summary
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as a class of regulators of gene expression through posttranscriptional degradation or translational repression in living cells. Increasing evidence points to the important relationship between miRNAs and environmental stress responses, but the regulatory mechanisms in plants are poorly understood. Here, we found that Arabidopsis thaliana intronic miR400 was cotranscribed with its host gene (At1g32583) and downregulated by heat treatment. Intriguingly, an alternative splicing (AS) event that occurred in the intron (306 bp) where MIR400 was located was specifically induced by heat stress. A 100 bp fragment was excised, and the remaining 206 bp intron containing MIR400 transcripts was retained in the host gene. The stress-induced AS event thus resulted in greater accumulation of miR400 primary transcripts and a low level of mature miR400. Together, these results provide the direct evidence that AS acts as a regulatory mechanism linking miRNAs and environmental stress in plants.

Abstract: Summary
The developmental origin of adipose tissue and what controls its distribution is poorly understood. By lineage tracing and gene expression analysis in mice, we provide evidence that mesenchymal precursors expressing Myf5—which are thought to give rise only to brown adipocytes and skeletal muscle—also give rise to a subset of white adipocytes. Furthermore, individual brown and white fats contain a mixture of adipocyte progenitor cells derived from Myf5+ and Myf5neg lineages, the number of which varies with depot location. Subsets of white adipocytes originating from both Myf5+ and Myf5neg precursors respond to β3-adrenoreceptor stimulation, suggesting “brite” adipocytes may also have multiple origins. We additionally find that deleting PTEN with myf5-cre causes lipomatosis and partial lipodystrophy by selectively expanding the Myf5+ adipocyte lineages. Thus, the spectrum of adipocytes arising from Myf5+ precursors is broader than previously thought, and differences in PI3K activity between adipocyte lineages alter body fat distribution.

TRAF2 Sets a Threshold for Extrinsic Apoptosis by Tagging Caspase-8 with a Ubiquitin Shutoff Timer,

Abstract: Summary
Apoptotic caspase activation mechanisms are well defined, yet inactivation modes remain unclear. The death receptors (DRs), DR4, DR5, and Fas, transduce cell-extrinsic apoptotic signals by recruiting caspase-8 into a death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). At the DISC, Cullin3-dependent polyubiquitination on the small catalytic subunit of caspase-8 augments stimulation. Here we report that tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) interacts with caspase-8 at the DISC, downstream of Cullin3. TRAF2 directly mediates RING-dependent, K48-linked polyubiquitination on the large catalytic domain of caspase-8. This modification destines activated caspase-8 molecules to rapid proteasomal degradation upon autoprocessing and cytoplasmic translocation. TRAF2 depletion lowers the signal threshold for DR-mediated apoptosis, altering cell life versus death decisions in vitro and in vivo. Thus, TRAF2 sets a critical barrier for cell-extrinsic apoptosis commitment by tagging activated caspase-8 with a K48-ubiquitin shutoff timer. These results may have important implications for caspase regulation mechanisms.

TGF-β Type II Receptor/MCP-5 Axis: At the Crossroad between Joint and Growth Plate Development,

Abstract: Summary
Despite its clinical significance, the mechanisms of joint morphogenesis are elusive. By combining laser-capture microdissection for RNA sampling with microarrays, we show that the setting in which joint-forming interzone cells develop is distinct from adjacent growth plate chondrocytes and is characterized by downregulation of chemokines, such as monocyte-chemoattractant protein-5 (MCP-5). Using in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro approaches, we show that low levels of interzone-MCP-5 are essential for joint formation and contribute to proper growth plate organization. Mice lacking the TGF-β-type-II-receptor (TβRII) in their limbs (Tgfbr2Prx1KO), which lack joint development and fail chondrocyte hypertrophy, show upregulation of interzone-MCP-5. In vivo and ex vivo blockade of the sole MCP-5 receptor, CCR2, led to the rescue of joint formation and growth plate maturation in Tgfbr2Prx1KO but an acceleration of growth plate mineralization in control mice. Our study characterized the TβRII/MCP-5 axis as an essential crossroad for joint development and endochondral growth.
