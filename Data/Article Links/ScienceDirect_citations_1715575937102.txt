Abstract: Summary
Additively manufactured (AM) three-dimensional (3D) mesostructures exhibit geometrically optimal mechanical, thermal, and optical properties that could drive future microrobotics, energy harvesting, and biosensing technologies at the micrometer to millimeter scale. We present a strategy for transforming AM mesostructures into 3D electronics by growing nanoscale conducting films on 3D-printed polymers. This highly generalizable method utilizes precision atomic layer deposition (ALD) of conducting metal oxides on ultrasmooth photopolymer lattices printed by high-resolution microstereolithography. We demonstrate control of 3D electronic transport by tuning conformal growth of ultrathin amorphous and crystalline conducting metal oxides. To understand the scaling of 3D electrical properties, we apply graph theory to compute network resistance and precisely design the 3D mesostructures' conductivity. Finally, we demonstrate 3D-enhanced multimodal sensing of chemical, thermal, and mechanical stimuli, geometrically boosting sensitivity by 100× over 2D films and enabling a new class of low-power, 3D-printable sensors.

Frameshift mutation S368fs in the gene encoding cytoskeletal β-actin leads to ACTB-associated syndromic thrombocytopenia by impairing actin dynamics,

Abstract: Heterozygous dominant mutations in the ubiquitously produced cytoskeletal β–actin isoform lead to a broad range of human disease phenotypes, which are currently classified as three distinct clinical entities termed Baraitser-Winter–Cerebrofrontofacial syndrome (BWCFF), ACTB–associated pleiotropic malformation syndrome with intellectual disability (ACTB–PMSID), and ACTB–associated syndromic thrombocytopenia (ACTB–AST). The latter two are distinguishable from BWCFF by the presence of milder craniofacial features and less pronounced developmental abnormalities, or the absence of craniofacial features in combination with a characteristic thrombocytopenia with platelet anisotropy. Production and correct function of β–actin is required for multiple essential processes in all types of cells. Directed cell migration, cytokinesis and morphogenesis are amongst the functions that are supported by β–actin. Here we report the recombinant production and biochemical characterization of the ACTB–AST mutant p.S368fs, resulting in an altered sequence in the C–terminal region of β–actin that includes a replacement of the last 8 residues and an elongation of the molecule by 4 residues. The mutation affects a region important for actin polymerization and actin–profilin interaction. Accordingly, we measured markedly reduced rates of nucleation and polymerization during spontaneous actin assembly and lower affinity of p.S368fs for human profilin–1. The reduced affinity is also reflected in the lower propensity of profilin–1 to extend the nucleation phase of p.S368fs. While localized in close proximity to actin–cofilin and actin–myosin interfaces, we determined only minor effects of the mutation on the interaction of mutant filaments with cofilin and myosin family members. However, allosteric effects on sites distant from the mutation manifest themselves in a 7.9 °C reduction in thermal denaturation temperature, a 2–fold increase in the observed IC50 for DNase–I, and changes in nucleotide exchange kinetics. Our results support a disease mechanism involving impaired actin dynamics and function through disruption of actin–profilin interactions and further exacerbated by allosteric perturbations.

Abstract: Fibrosis is a physiological process of tissue repair that turns into pathological when becomes chronic, damaging the functional structure of the tissue. In this review we outline the current status of extracellular vesicles as modulators of the fibrotic process at different levels. In adipose tissue, extracellular vesicles mediate the intercellular communication not only between adipocytes, but also between adipocytes and other cells of the stromal vascular fraction. Thus, they could be altering essential processes for the functionality of adipose tissue, such as adipocyte hypertrophy/hyperplasia, tissue plasticity, adipogenesis and/or inflammation, and ultimately trigger fibrosis. This process is particularly important in obesity, and may eventually, influence the development of obesity-associated alterations. In this regard, obesity is now recognized as an independent risk factor for the development of chronic kidney disease, although the role of extracellular vesicles in this connection has not been explored so far. Nonetheless, the role of extracellular vesicles in the onset and progression of renal fibrosis has been highlighted due to the critical role of fibrosis as a common feature of kidney diseases. In fact, the content of extracellular vesicles disturbs cellular signaling cascades involved in fibrosis in virtually all types of renal cells. What is certain is that the study of extracellular vesicles is complex, as their isolation and manipulation is still difficult to reproduce, which complicates the overview of their physiopathological effects. Nevertheless, new strategies have been developed to exploit the potential of extracellular vesicles and their cargo, both as biomarkers and as therapeutic tools to prevent the progression of fibrosis towards an irreversible event.

Abstract: Summary
Jumping-droplet condensation on rough superhydrophobic surfaces exhibits increased heat-transfer rates when compared with dropwise condensation on smooth hydrophobic surfaces. However, the performance of superhydrophobic surfaces is limited by the low individual droplet growth rates associated with their extreme apparent advancing contact angles. Here, we report that biphilic surfaces having smooth, low-surface-energy spots on a superhydrophobic background exhibit a 10× higher jumping-droplet condensation heat-transfer coefficient when compared with homogeneous superhydrophobic surfaces. Our detailed condensation heat-transfer modeling coupled with numerical simulations of binary and coordinated droplet coalescence show that spot wettability should not be optimized toward minimizing droplet nucleation energy barriers. Rather, spot wettability should be optimized to minimize droplet adhesion while maximizing individual droplet growth rates. Model-predicted design optimization of a variety of biphilic surfaces is validated against experiments. Our findings provide design guidelines for biphilic surface development to maximize condensation heat transfer.

Abstract: Summary
Development of alternative refrigeration technologies that are efficient and have zero global warming potential is a promising pathway to reduce the effect of the rising global cooling demand on climate change. We use lessons from flow batteries and thermally regenerative electrochemical cycles to introduce an electrochemical refrigeration technology based on the Brayton cycle: Brayton electrochemical refrigeration (BECR). Although the proof of concept is demonstrated elsewhere, here we report an analytical framework that elucidates the key parameters involved in BECR and how it may be elevated on the technology readiness scale. We first analyze the ideal BECR cycle to demonstrate the technology’s performance (cooling load and coefficient of performance) in the reversible limit, identify two main practical considerations, and then analyze the non-ideal BECR cycle to simulate realistic performance. Whenever possible, we introduce dimensionless figures of merit to help streamline future concerted research efforts that seek to improve the state of the art.

Abstract: Summary
Sulfide glasses are emerging as potential electrolytes for solid-state batteries. The mechanical behavior of these materials can significantly impact cell performance, and it is thus imperative to understand their deformation and fracture mechanisms. Previous work mainly reports properties obtained under quasi-static loading conditions, but very little is known about deformation under dynamic conditions. The current investigation shows that the sulfide glass mechanical behavior is dominated by viscoplasticity, differing substantially from polycrystalline oxide and sulfide solid electrolytes. Finite element modeling indicates that the sulfide glass stiffness is high enough to maintain good contact with softer lithium metal electrodes under moderate stack pressures. The observed viscoplasticity also implies that battery operating conditions will play an important role in electro-chemo-mechanical processes that are associated with dendritic lithium penetration. In general, the rate-dependent mechanical behavior of the sulfide glass electrolytes documented here offers a new dimension for designing next-generation all-solid-state batteries.

Abstract: Summary
Suffering from the adhesion of condensing water droplets, surface condensation performance is severely degraded. On a biphilic surface, condensing droplets efficiently nucleate while spontaneously being effectively removed from the surface due to the coalescence-induced droplet jumping phenomenon, significantly improving the surface condensation performance. However, it remains a challenge to appropriately tune the biphilic surface structure to maximize the droplet jumping performance and improve the condensation. Here, we report an experimentally verified droplet jumping theory that can optimize the biphilic surface structure, maximizing the droplet jumping height on the biphilic surface. Effects of surface orientation and air pressure are also investigated. The heat flux on the optimized biphilic surface can be enhanced by ∼43% and ∼139% compared with that on the superhydrophobic surface and a normal copper plate under atmospheric conditions, respectively, while that of the water collection flux can be improved by ∼61% and ∼273%, respectively.

Abstract: Introduction
The novel SARS-CoV-2 infection has been spreading around the world since January 2020 causing the Corona Virus Disease 2019. Leukopenia, lymphopenia and hypercoagulability with elevated D- Dimers have been described in COVID-19 patients to date. This study aimed to clarify if some blood parameters can be used as biomarkers to facilitate diagnosis and establish prognosis. Methods: We selected patients who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and had had a hemogram performed between the March 15 and April 15, 2020. Socio-demographic and analytical data were obtained from 274 patients at admission in two Portuguese public hospitals. We then analyzed the hemogram parameters at admission in the intensive care and collected data on patient survival during the SARS-CoV-2 disease follow-up. The data were analyzed using appropriate statistical tests. Results: Patients requiring the intensive care unit (ICU) present an increase in leukocytes and neutrophils (+3.1 × 109/L and +6.4 × 109/L, respectively), a lymphocyte decrease and a platelet rise (-1.6 × 109/L and +60.8 × 109/L, respectively). The erythrocytes, hemoglobin and median globular volume tend to decrease (-0.5 × 1012, - 1.2 g/dL; -3 fL, respectively). The lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) at admission was significantly higher (+58.1 U/L). The age, sex, platelets, lymphocyte count neutrophil counts, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, erythrocytes and cell hemoglobin concentration mean (CHCM) are independently associated with mortality (odds ratio (OR) = 0.046, p < 0.001; OR = 0.2364, p = 0.045; OR = 9.106, p = 0.001; OR = 0.194, p = 0.033; OR = 0.062, p = 0.003; OR = 0.098, p = 0.002; OR = 9.021, p < 0.001; OR = 7.016, p = 0.007, respectively).
Conclusion
The hematological data at admission in the health care system can predict the mortality of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and we recommend its use in the clinical decisions and patient prognosis evaluation.

Abstract: Summary
The inhibition of droplet bounce on solid interfaces is of great importance in many fields, particularly in pesticide spraying, as undesired rebound often causes pesticide waste and weakens its performance. Here, we synthesize a natural triterpenoid-derived amphiphile that can self-assemble into chiral helical ribbons in a cooperative nuclear-elongation manner, with a realization of chirality transfer and amplification from molecular to supramolecular level. These helical ribbons are able to inhibit droplet rebound on a hydrophobic surface regardless of whether the inclined angle of substrate is 0°, 30°, or 60°. The physical entanglements between helical ribbons and the rough micro-/nanostructures of the surface are proposed to be responsible for this inhibition and the consumption of impact kinetic energy. Benefiting from such entanglements, droplets were able to deposit on plant leaves, i.e., rice leaf and leek leaf, in a real environment. This work introduces an alternative strategy using supramolecular assemblies as additives to inhibit droplet bounce.

Abstract: Summary
Conventional synthesis techniques for high entropy materials often require prolonged processes or the use of complex fabrication steps. Here, we report on a scalable method to synthesize high entropy hydroxide and oxide nanoparticles using electrochemical synthesis in an aqueous environment. The current density parameter was set to create a non-equilibrium condition where the hydrogen evolution reaction results in a turbulent environment facilitating the formation of nanoparticles within the electrolyte. Using this approach, we demonstrate the synthesis of both binary (Fe, Mn) and quinary (Fe, Mn, Ni, Ca, Mg) metal hydroxide and oxide nanoparticles. The chemical and microscopy analysis shows that the high entropy nanoparticles can be synthesized as a hydroxide without any post processing and as an oxide through a calcination process with atomic scale mixing of all elements. The synthesis of high entropy nanoparticles is important for applications targeting catalysis, energy storage and conversion, filtration, and environmental engineering.

Abstract: Metastasis or the progression of malignancy poses a major challenge in cancer therapy and is the principal reason for increased mortality. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of the basement membrane (BM) allows cells of epithelial phenotype to transform into a mesenchymal-like (quasi-mesenchymal) phenotype and metastasize via the lymphovascular system through a metastatic cascade by intravasation and extravasation. This helps in the progression of carcinoma from the primary site to distant organs. Collagen, laminin, and integrin are the prime components of BM and help in tumor cell metastasis, which makes them ideal cancer drug targets. Further, recent studies have shown that collagen, laminin, and integrin can be used as a biomarker for metastatic cells. In this review, we have summarized the current knowledge of such therapeutics, which are either currently in preclinical or clinical stages and could be promising cancer therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
Using water as a refrigerant for innovative cycle-cooling technology is desirable, since water not only is economically and environmentally unrivaled, but also owns a latent heat that is 16-fold that of commercial halohydrocarbon. However, water-based refrigeration has been limited by a phase transition point far from room temperature and intractable volume change upon vaporization. Here, we use a synergy between nanoconfinement and mechanical pressures in regulating the phase transition of water and report a giant mechanocaloric effect in nanoconfined water by thermodynamic analysis and atomistic calculations. The estimated isothermal entropy changes are as high as 1,066 J kg−1 K−1 and adiabatic temperature changes can reach tens of kelvins near room temperature for water confined in slit nanopores. Practical utility of this effect is supported by the robustly high refrigerant performance of water-filled nanoporous carbon matrices. This effect is potentially extendable to other polar liquids and opens new prospects for liquid-state caloric effects.

Abstract: Summary
A cost-effective and long stability catalyst with decent electrochemical activity would play a crucial role in accelerating applications of metal-air batteries. Here, we report quintuple nitrogen and oxygen co-coordinated Zr sites on graphene (Zr-N/O-C) by using a ball-milling, solid-solution-assisted pyrolysis method. The as-prepared Zr-N/O-C catalyst with 2.93 wt % Zr shows a half-wave potential of 0.910 V, an onset potential of 1.000 V in 0.1 M KOH, impressive durability (95.1% remains after 16,000 s), and long-term stability (5 mV loss over 10,000 cycles). Zn-air batteries with the Zr-N/O-C electrode exhibit a maximum power density of 217.9 mW cm−2 and a high cycling life of over 1,000 h, exceeding the counterpart equipped with a Pt/C benchmark. Theoretical simulations demonstrate that nitrogen and oxygen dual-ligand confinement effectively tunes the d-band center and balances key intermediates binding energy of intrinsic quintuple coordination Zr sites.

Abstract: Intermediary metabolism of tumors is characterized, in part, by a dysregulation of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway at its rate-controlling enzyme providing the molecular basis for tumor membranes (mitochondria, plasma membrane) to become enriched with cholesterol (Bloch, 1965; Feo et al., 1975; Brown and Goldstein, 1980; Goldstein and Brown, 1990). Cholesterol enriched tumor mitochondria manifest preferential citrate export, thereby providing a continuous supply of substrate precursor for the tumor’s dysregulated cholesterogenesis via a “truncated” Krebs/TCA cycle (Kaplan et al., 1986; Coleman et al., 1997). Proliferating tumors shed elevated amounts of plasma membrane-derived extracellular vesicles (pmEV) compared with normal tissues (van Blitterswijk et al., 1979; Black, 1980). Coordination of these metabolic phenomena in tumors supports the enhanced intercalation of cholesterol within the plasma membrane lipid bilayer’s cytoplasmic face, the promotion of outward protrusions from the plasma membrane, and the evolution of cholesterol enriched pmEV. The pmEV shed by tumors possess elevated cholesterol and concentrated cell surface antigen clusters found on the tumor cells themselves (Kim et al., 2002). Upon exfoliation, saturation of the extracellular milieu with tumor-derived pmEV could allow early onset mammalian immune surveillance mechanisms to become “blind” to an evolving cancer and lose their ability to detect and initiate strategies to destroy the cancer. However, a molecular mechanism is lacking that would help explain how cholesterol enrichment of the pmEV inner lipid bilayer might allow the tumor cell to evade the host immune system. We offer a hypothesis, endorsed by published mathematical modeling of biomembrane structure as well as by decades of in vivo data with diverse cancers, that a cholesterol enriched inner bilayer leaflet, coupled with a logarithmic expansion in surface area of shed tumor pmEV load relative to its derivative cancer cell, conspire to force exposure of otherwise unfamiliar membrane integral protein domains as antigenic epitopes to the host’s circulating immune surveillance system, allowing the tumor cells to evade destruction. We provide elementary numerical estimations comparing the amount of pmEV shed from tumor versus normal cells.

Abstract: Summary
Alkyl pyridinium salts have been used in dipolar cycloaddition reactions with π-unsaturated compounds and in reductive single-electron transfer reactions as convenient radical precursors. Here, we report a distinct reaction pathway involving triplet diradical intermediates in the coupling reaction between alkyl pyridinium ylides and electrophilic N-heterocyclic molecules. We demonstrate that alkyl pyridinium ylides generated from alkyl pyridinium salts under basic aqueous conditions can undergo addition into iminoamido N-heterocycles, generating triplet diradical intermediates that can lead to C–H alkylated products. The proposed reaction mechanism is supported by electron paramagnetic resonance and radical scavenging experiments. Notably, a wide substrate scope and excellent level of functional group tolerance are attained under cost-effective and straightforward conditions, which reveal the amenability of this protocol in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries.

Abstract: Summary
Impurity doping is a promising strategy to afford colloidal nanocrystals exhibiting novel optical, catalytic, and electronic characteristics. However, some significant properties of noble metal-doped nanocrystals (NMD-NCs) remain unknown. Here, we report the electroluminescence (EL) from NMD-NCs. By doping silver impurity into cadmium selenide colloidal quantum wells (CQWs), dual-emission emitters are achieved and a light-emitting diode (LED) with a luminance of 1,339 cd m−2 is reported. In addition, the proposed energy gap engineering to manage exciton recombination is a feasible scheme for tunable EL emissions (e.g., the dopant emission is tuned from 606 to 761 nm). Furthermore, an organic-inorganic hybrid white LED based on CQWs is realized, reaching a color rendering index of 82. Moreover, flexible CQW-LEDs are reported. The findings present a step to unveil the EL property of NMD-NCs, which can be extended to other noble metal impurities, and pave the pathway for NMD-NCs as a class of electronic materials for EL applications.

Abstract: Summary
Biocompatible aggregation-induced emission (AIE) materials from natural resources are of great interest for a variety of potential applications. Here, we report the unconventional AIE nature of the green tea polyphenol epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which is investigated by observing the disappearance and reoccurrence of fluorescence when EGCG is dissolved and recrystallized in aqueous solutions. The intermolecular through-space conjugation and structural rigidification induced by multiple intermolecular H-bonds play critical roles in the AIE phenomenon. This inspires the development of a multicolored, monodisperse, photostable, and non-toxic nano-AIE luminogen (nano-AIEgen), which is simply prepared by polyphenol-amine-based crosslinking in aqueous solutions, demonstrating great potential for living cell bioimaging. Our strategy to develop nano-AIEgens using AIE-active hydrophilic natural products—e.g., plant polyphenols, such as tannic acid, that exhibit similar AIE characteristics—can help push the boundary of the exploration of various novel, large-scale, biocompatible, water-soluble, and degradable AIE materials from natural resources.

Abstract: Summary
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is the most widely used white pigment for coatings, plastics, papers, and cosmetics, but its high price, high-pollution production process, and potential cancer risks have led to scientists and engineers attempting to find alternatives. However, little progress has been made thus far. Herein, we report the fabrication of TiO2-free coatings by mixing common solvent-based or waterborne resins and hollow glass beads of specific sizes. The TiO2-free white coatings exhibit much higher solar reflectance (∼0.96) and longwave infrared near-normal emittance (∼0.94) than many TiO2-based coatings, thus realizing highly efficient subambient cooling of ∼7.8°C at night and ∼7.1°C under direct sunlight. Specifically, the scalable and self-adaptive subambient radiative cooling and above-ambient solar heating coatings (ΔTcooling-heating = 9.5°C) are demonstrated when reversible thermochromic microcapsules are added, which significantly expands the scope of year-round energy-saving applications.

Abstract: Accumulating evidence suggests that mural pericytes, apart from stabilizing the associated microvessels, play additional roles in regeneration of local cellular elements. Herein, the mechanistic basis for such diverse and at times contradictory roles adopted by pericytes in the brain is reviewed. Core concepts of an emerging model are discussed wherein mural pericytes reside in a metastable “archival state” that conceals a neural progenitor identity. Upon angiogenic remodeling, a selected subpopulation of pericytes reclaim the progenitor state during transdifferentiation and contribute to neural regeneration. The genomic basis for neural transdifferentiation of pericytes is reviewed with reference to the extant literature.

Abstract: Summary
Achieving high selectivity and activity with the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is significant for developing efficient energy conversion techniques and chemical production. Here, we report that selective ORRs can be achieved by tuning short-range order in amorphous and crystalline NiO nanosheets (a-NiO NSs and c-NiO NSs, respectively). X-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis reveals that the short-range order of a-NiO NSs and c-NiO NSs mainly adopt the NiO5 pyramidal and NiO6 octahedral structures, respectively. The a-NiO NSs for electrochemical H2O2 production in 0.1 M KOH exhibits both high selectivity over 90% and high activity (1 mA cm−2 at 0.66 V versus RHE), while c-NiO NSs tends to catalyze ORRs through 4-electron pathways to generate H2O. Theoretical calculations indicate that the changed short-range order of a-NiO NSs leads to alteration of Ni d-orbital states, which can regulate the adsorption orientation and strength of ∗OOH intermediates to achieve high selectivity and activity of 2-electron ORRs.

Abstract: Summary
The modulation of the recognition site has great potential for the development of high-performance fluorescent sensors, but the regulation of preferential combination between the recognition site and the target molecules has rarely been studied. Here, to boost the response speed of the fluorescent probe, the recognition site is regulated via design of the electron-withdrawing ability of the adjacent R-benzene group. The interaction between the ester bond and hydrazine (N2H4) is precisely modulated to promote effective combination between them in the pre-chemical approach part of the process. The strong electrostatic combination capability, the moderate shielding effect, and the favorable inverse Gibbs free energy barrier together ensure an improved light-up time of 2–3 s for the F-CN probe. The present investigation may facilitate further exploration of fluorescent probes for ultrasensitive and rapid chemical sensing, as well as additional work on interaction modulation for various applications.

KT2 alleviates ulcerative colitis by reducing Th17 cell differentiation through the miR-302c-5p/STAT3 axis,

Abstract: Background
The abnormal differentiation of Th17 cells aggravates ulcerative colitis (UC). Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) exert pivotal protection functions against UC. KT2 is a cationic AMP that mediates colon cancer development. However, KT2′s function in UC remains unclear.
Methods
The UC mouse model was induced by administering 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium, and the mice were given an enema of KT2. KT2′s function in UC and Th17 cell differentiation in vivo was evaluated through various molecular experiments. The KT2′s function in Th17 cell differentiation in vitro was evaluated by the proportion of CD4+ IL-17+ T cells, IL-17 levels, and RORγt expression levels. Meanwhile, the mechanism was assessed through quantitative real-time PCR, various loss-of-function assays, and dual-luciferase reporter gene assay.
Results
KT2 restrained Th17 cell differentiation in both in vivo and in vitro UC models and slowed the UC process. KT2 elevated miR-302c-5p expression, as well as restrained Th17 cell differentiation by increasing miR-302c-5p. Meanwhile, miR-302c-5p interacted with the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and negatively regulated its expression. Furthermore, our data revealed that KT2 restrained the activation of STAT3 by elevating miR-302c-5p, thereby inhibiting Th17 cell differentiation.
Conclusion
KT2 alleviates UC by repressing Th17 cell differentiation through the miR-302c-5p/STAT3 axis.

Abstract: Summary
Effective mitigation technology to prevent the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is required before achieving population immunity through vaccines. Here we demonstrate a virus-blocking textile (VBT) that repulses SARS-CoV-2 by applying repulsive Coulomb force to respiratory particles, powered by human body triboelectric energy harvesting. We show that SARS-CoV-2 has negative charges, and a human body generates high output current of which peak-to-peak value reaches 259.6 μA at most, based on triboelectric effect. Thereby, the human body can sustainably power a VBT to have negative electrical potential, and the VBT highly blocks SARS-CoV-2 by repulsion. In an acrylic chamber study, we found that the VBT blocks SARS-CoV-2 by 99.95%, and SARS-CoV-2 in the VBT is 13-fold reduced. Our work provides technology that may prevent the spread of virus based on repulsive Coulomb force and triboelectric energy harvesting.

Abstract: Summary
Deep UV transparent thin films have recently attracted considerable attention owing to their potential in UV and organic-based optoelectronics. Here, we report the achievement of a deep UV transparent and highly conductive thin film based on Si-doped Ga2O3 (SGO) with high conductivity of 2500 S/cm. The SGO thin films exhibit high transparency over a wide spectrum ranging from visible light to deep UV wavelength and, meanwhile, have a very low work-function of approximately 3.2 eV. A combination of photoemission spectroscopy and theoretical studies reveals that the delocalized conduction band derived from Ga 4s orbitals is responsible for the Ga2O3 films’ high conductivity. Furthermore, Si is shown to act as an efficient shallow donor, yielding high mobility up to approximately 60 cm2/Vs. The superior optoelectronic properties of SGO films make it a promising material for use as electrodes in high-power electronics and deep UV and organic-based optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: Summary
The electrochemical reduction of CO2 from flue gas or direct air capture to relevant syngas mixtures is a promising route toward mitigation of environmental pollution and production of bulk chemicals and fuels. Among the different cell types, gas-fed zero-gap electrolyzers are promising as energy-efficient and scalable devices. We herein investigate the influence of operational parameters related to cathode water management, such as cell orientation, gas humidification, and cathode compression onto CO2R. By a stepwise optimization of our not yet fully optimized electrolyzer, stability could be improved by a factor of 3 up to 10 h at 3 V and 300 mA cm−2. Faradic efficiency for CO after 2 h of electrolysis was increased from 14% to over 60%. Controlling the water management is a key parameter as high water input leads to flooding of the electrodes, whereas lower values decrease the performance of the anion exchange membrane and reduce catalyst wetting.

Abstract: Summary
Worthington jet generated by a drop impacting onto an aqueous pool will make the secondary droplets and aerosols splash into the air, causing air pollution, bodily injury, pathogen transmission, and other hazards. Previous studies inhibited Worthington jet by significantly increasing viscosity or reducing droplet impact velocity, which cannot be applied in most practical cases. Herein, we demonstrate that surfactant solutions of tiny concentrations can effectively inhibit the Worthington jet. The nonequilibrium surface adsorption of surfactants at the liquid-gas interface during the impact process produces a strong surface tension gradient, which weakens the energy of the rebound jet and inhibits the generation of secondary droplets. This convenient and efficient method for inhibiting the Worthington jet can be applied to eliminate the aerosol spread of pathogens and pollutants, as well as the damage and waste caused by liquid splashes.

Abstract: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are becoming promising tools for clinical application, either as sources of disease-specific molecular signatures for the unraveling of disease pathophysiology and establishment of novel biomarkers, or as platforms for cell-free nanotherapy. Yet, an unsolved issue is to define standardized techniques for EV isolation allowing data comparison across laboratories worldwide. Considering the difficulties to find this necessary consensus, it has to be stressed out that the outcome of the downstream analysis might be deeply biased by the isolation method, among other variables. Thus, it is crucial that the researcher is aware of the strengths and weaknesses of each method keeping their intended use in mind, and to sufficiently report the methodology details for the results to be comparable and solid. This review aims to present the most widely used EV isolation methods, from the initial differential ultracentrifugation (dUC) to newest approaches.

Abstract: Summary
In the search for stable materials with high porosity, attention has moved toward atomic networks that utilize molecular linkages. PAF-1, with linkages of biphenyl moieties, forms an amorphous network with phenomenal porosity and stability. Until now there still has been no clear picture of its atomic structure. We report here on a study using both neutron scattering and molecular dynamics simulation methods. We demonstrate that PAF-1 forms a continuous random network, in which tetrahedral carbon sites are connected by the biphenyl linkers. The molecular dynamics simulations show local structure with avoidance of close contacts between hydrogen atoms. We observe a distinct peak in the scattering at Q = 0.45 Å−1, corresponding to the first sharp diffraction peak in amorphous silica. This suggests there is structural analogy between the amorphous tetrahedral networks of PAF-1 and silica.

Abstract: Summary
Synthesis and characterization of metallacycles is an important research issue because they have acted as important building blocks and key intermediates in synthetic and catalytic chemistry. However, spiro rare-earth metallacyclopent-3-enes and metallacyclopentadienes are two kinds of untouched species. Herein, we report the construction of the spiro rare-earth metallacyclopent-3-enes 2 by ligand-based 4e- reduction of spiro rare-earth metallacyclopentadienes 3 with excess lithium. Complexes 3 represent a class of spiro rare-earth metallacyclopentadienes and could be easily synthesized from the reaction of 1,4-dilithio-1,3-butadiene 1 with 0.5 equiv of ScCl3. X-ray characterization and theoretical analyses (molecular orbitals [Mos], nucleus-independent chemical shift [NICS], anisotropy of induced current density [AICD], isochemical shielding surface [ICSS], and isomerization stabilization energy [ISE]) are performed to visualize the structure and bond characteristics of 2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the Li cations play a vital role in stabilizing its geometric and electronic structures. Therefore, this work promotes the cooperative development of rare-earth organometallic chemistry and coordination chemistry.

Abstract: Summary
Organic solar cells (OSCs) suffer from severe upscaling loss due to the inevitable formation of inhomogeneities and the intrinsically low charge mobilities of organic materials limiting the charge extraction efficiency, especially in the situation where cell width reaches centimeter scale. Here, we report the introduction of a nematic liquid crystal donor, BTR-Cl, into a typical non-fullerene blending system of PM6:BTP-eC9. The participation of BTR-Cl contributes to a significantly improved crystallinity and ordering of the host components and facilitates efficient three-dimensional charge transport in the active layer. Simultaneously improved fill factor and current density are thus achieved in BTR-Cl-doped OSCs, corresponding to a superior efficiency of 18.31%. More importantly, a high efficiency of 16.88% along with a robust fill factor of 73.4% is retained when enlarging the effective device area from 0.034 to 1.01 cm2, highlighting the importance of three-dimensional charge transport in reducing the upscaling loss of OSCs.

Abstract: Summary
The development of high-entropy ceramic nanomaterials has significant scientific and technological potential, yet studies on these materials are rare. Here, we successfully synthesize (Hf0.25Ta0.25Nb0.25Ti0.25)C high-entropy metal carbide (HEC-1) nanowires—a class of high-entropy ceramic nanomaterials—via a facile bamboo-based carbothermal method with an Fe-Ni catalyst. The growth of HEC-1 nanowires occurs through a classical vapor-liquid-solid mechanism based on the solubility of metal, carbon, and HEC-1 in the Fe-Ni alloy. After high-temperature treatment, HEC-1 nanowires show good thermal stability without morphological evolution below 1,600°C, while they evolve into “pearl-necklace”’-like nanostructures or particles above 1,600°C due to the Rayleigh instability mechanism. After high-pressure treatments, HEC-1 nanowires are broken into nanorods above 1 GPa, in which brittle fracture without any dislocations, slip bands, or amorphous shear bands is directly observed at nano and atomic scales.

Abstract: Summary
Direct imaging of the dynamics of polymeric assemblies in organic solvents is an outstanding challenge. Herein, we apply liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (LCTEM) to study polymeric nanomaterials in organic solvents. LCTEM is distinct from other TEM methods as it can be applied to characterize the morphology of nanomaterials in organic solvents. To enable this demonstration, we examined electron-solvent interactions for two common organic solvents, N,N-dimethylformamide and methanol, and compared these solvents to water. For each solvent, we developed Monte Carlo simulations and kinetic radiolysis models, providing scattering and chemical insight, respectively. Guided by theoretical results, we applied LCTEM and postmortem mass spectral imaging of poly(styrene)-b-poly(4-vinylpyridine) assemblies in each solvent. Then, a worm-to-micelle transformation in poly(styrene)-b-poly(4-vinylpyridine) was triggered via organic solvent mixing during LCTEM, enabling an experiment not possible through a cryogenic TEM time series. Our work provides a pathway for an expanded examination of nanomaterials in organic solvents via LCTEM, a neglected research area despite the obvious prevalence of such materials across chemistry and materials science.

Abstract: Summary
For any electrode process, the active species reaching the reaction sites of the electrode surface will ultimately become a controlling step, and this depends on the diffusion layer and its thickness. The diffusion layer, however, is not readily modified other than by introducing vigorous stirring. In lithium-ion-based energy storage, the supply of lithium ion to the reaction sites is certainly a rate-limiting step. Herein, we report an unusual type of “forced convection” by introducing a functionalized molecule in the electrode to break the traditional diffusion limit resulting in an alternative mode of mass transfer. The functionalized molecule, methylene blue phosphotungstate (MB-PW12), is designed with multiple redox properties that can “adsorb” and “release” lithium ion during its redox processes. By implanting the MB-PW12 in sulfur cathode matrix, forced lithium-ion flux can be realized, and this also favors polysulfides adsorption and catalysis, thus boosting the sulfur conversion reactions.

Abstract: Summary
Heterocyclobutane-1,3-diyls bridge the gap between organic and inorganic chemistry and are known for the majority of group 13–15 elements. The kinetically stabilized compounds have been employed in the activation of small molecules, akin to conventional transition metal complexes, and are thus cost-efficient alternatives for future processes. Here, we present the synthesis and characterization of a particularly unusual example of a heterocyclobutane-1,3-diyl, [RC(μ-NR′)2P], that blurs the line between biradical, zwitterion, and phosphinidene. While the reaction with AuCl and an NHC (N-heterocyclic carbene) shows resemblance to biradicals, the reaction with an alkyne to form a phosphirene is characteristic for phosphinidenes. Quantum chemical investigations allow for the classification of the amidinate-based heterocycle [RC(μ-NR′)2P] next to comparable literature examples.

Abstract: Summary
Achieving long life with energy-dense lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries requires improving the reversibility of Li plating and stripping. The formation of soluble polysulfide intermediates, which degrade the Li-metal anode by reducing into insulating Li2S and Li2S2, create a unique problem in the Li-S system. Here, we show that the introduction of ammonium tetrathiomolybdate ((NH4)2MoS4) and ammonium tetrathiotungstate ((NH4)2WS4) as cathode additives stabilize Li deposition by (1) complexing with polysulfides and acting as a polysulfide buffer, thereby mitigating the corrosive shuttle effect and (2) forming a stable and passivating Mo/W-enriched solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the Li surface. The resulting stabilization of Li electrodeposition enables a nearly 3-fold improvement in the cycle of anode-free full cells. This work demonstrates that the rich chemistry between thiometallate complexes and polysulfide species can be exploited to solve the formidable challenges with achieving a realistic Li-S battery and, more generally, metal-chalcogen batteries.

Abstract: Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is the major route through which cells internalise various substances and recycle membrane components. Via the coordinated action of many proteins, the membrane bends and invaginates to form a vesicle that buds off—along with its contents—into the cell. The contribution of the actin cytoskeleton to this highly dynamic process in mammalian cells is not well understood. Unlike in yeast, where there is a strict requirement for actin in CME, the significance of the actin cytoskeleton to mammalian CME is variable. However, a growing number of studies have established the actin cytoskeleton as a core component of mammalian CME, and our understanding of its contribution has been increasing at a rapid pace. In this review, we summarise the state-of-the-art regarding our understanding of the endocytic cytoskeleton, its physiological significance, and the questions that remain to be answered.

Abstract: Summary
Vacancy-ordered halide double perovskites are promising non-toxic and stable alternatives for their lead- and tin (II)-based counterparts in electronic and optoelectronic applications. Despite extensive theoretical studies on this emerging family of materials, efforts devoted to the chemical modulation of their thin-film properties and their potential application in electronic devices remain rare. Here, we develop a facile one-step solution processing strategy to tune the film quality of cesium tin (IV) iodide (Cs2SnI6) perovskite and demonstrate its feasibility in thin-film transistor (TFT) application. We reveal critical roles of precursor stoichiometric ratio and solvent engineering in achieving uniform and highly crystalline Cs2SnI6 films with superior electron mobility. We further modulate the electronic properties by incorporating an external manganese (Mn2+) dopant, achieving high-performance air-stable n-channel TFTs and all-perovskite complementary inverters. We anticipate that the present study would pave the way for expanding the environmentally friendly and stable perovskites toward widespread applications.

Abstract: Summary
Rechargeable aqueous zinc-ion batteries have emerged as potential alternatives to lithium-ion batteries in grid energy storage due to their intrinsic safety, economy, and high capacity of zinc anode. Unfortunately, dendrite growth, limited reversibility, and corrosion of metal zinc anodes in aqueous systems seriously hamper the application of zinc-ion batteries. Herein, ultrathin and high-toughness membranes composed of eco-friendly biomass nanofibers are constructed for substituting glass-fiber separators in rechargeable zinc-ion batteries. The presence of this robust biomass membrane lowers separator thickness to 9 μm, which can prevent the pierce of zinc dendrite, manipulate crystallographic orientation during zinc deposition, and improve the anti-corrosion property of zinc. Thus, this robust biomass membrane enables excellent electrochemical performance and sheds light on a multifunctional design for improving metal zinc anode performance from separators beyond zinc itself.

Abstract: Summary
To approach the theoretical efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the defects in perovskites should be managed. Among different types of defects, halide vacancies easily form on the surface of perovskite grains (PGs), hindering perovskite stability and the charge-transport process by trapping charge carriers. In this work, oxidized black phosphorus quantum dots (O-BPQDs) are incorporated into a perovskite to resolve these issues. Oxygen atoms of the O-BPQDs interact with uncoordinated Pb (halide vacancies), forming grain interconnections. These interactions reduce halide vacancies and suppress the overall recombination kinetics. Along with defect reduction, the O-BPQDs offer an efficient charge-transport channel across individual PGs. We achieve a best power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.34% for SnO2-based PSCs and of 23.1% for TiO2-based PSCs. These PSCs exhibit moisture stability in a relative humidity (RH) 40% environment comparable to 3D/2D perovskites. Our strategy provides practical applicability and versatility for PSCs to approach the theoretical PCE value.

Abstract: Summary
The large-scale synthesis of supported multinuclear catalysts with controllable metal nuclearity and constituent composition remains a formidable challenge. We report the stepwise assembly of supported atom-precise bimetallic ligand-mediated metal ensembles (LMMEs) by exploiting the underlying principles of coordination chemistry and solid-state chemistry. Lewis di-basic 2-methylimidazole is used to bridge multiple Cu2+ and M2+ (M = Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) ions within ZSM-5 zeolites. We observe the metal constituent composition of the LMMEs by mass spectroscopy. The adjacent metal nuclei in the LMMEs offer substantial synergistic effects that enhance the catalytic performance by at least an order of magnitude in the model catalytic “click” reaction. It is envisaged that this stepwise assembly approach to develop supported multinuclear catalysts with atom precision could effectively bridge homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis.

Abstract: Summary
With high theoretical capacity, tin phosphide (Sn4P3) has recently garnered attention as the anode for potassium-ion batteries (PIBs). However, its application is limited by the rapid capacity decay, which is highly correlated with the stability of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Here, we explore how the solvation structure of electrolytes affects the interphase components for the Sn4P3 anode, thus determining the cycle stability. The decomposition of FSI− and ester solvents, particularly EC, may result in the SEI layer being enriched with poly(CO3) and K-F, leading to a more stable cycling capability of K/Sn4P3 batteries in the KFSI-EC:DMC:EMC electrolyte. Moreover, a compact and uniform SEI layer promotes cycle stability. Theoretical analysis of the solvation structure epitomizes that the KFSI-EC:DMC:EMC electrolyte can generate a stable SEI layer due to K+ interacting more with FSI− anions and EC solvent. The finding of this work helps us comprehend how SEI layer components affect the capacity of Sn4P3 anodes in PIBs.

Abstract: Summary
Many strategies have been developed to improve the Li-ion storage performance of silicon (Si)-based anodes. Unfortunately, production and application of the Si-based anodes are still severely impeded by high cost, complex synthesis and poor practical performance. Herein, we demonstrate a cost-effective strategy for large-scale production of Si-based anodes by pyrolyzing economical gelatin and ball-milled micron-sized Si particles. During the pyrolysis process, the good water solubility and film-forming property of gelatin enable it to form continuous carbon networks with enhanced dual-interfacial bonding between Si particles and current collectors. As a result, the obtained Si anode exhibits an integrated dense structure with ultrahigh Si content and excellent mechanical flexibility. The BMSi@GC anode delivers a high initial coulombic efficiency (88.2%) with high capacities (2,738 mAh g−1, 2,157 mAh cm−3, and 2.74 mAh cm−2). Moreover, a BMSi@GC//LiCoO2 pouch cell shows high energy densities (537 Wh kg−1 and 585.1 Wh L−1) with good cycling performance.

Abstract: Summary
The formation of thermodynamically accessible metallacycle is crucial to achieve site-selective C–H bond activation. Here, we report an isocyanide-bridging C–H activation through the formation of a five-membered palladacycle. As such, a proximal C–H bond in aldehyde moiety is activated selectively. The subsequent palladium shift and intramolecular C=N bond insertion construct a valuable isoindolinone framework. Compared with conventional isocyanide-promoted C–H bond activation, both carbon and nitrogen atoms in isocyanide are engaged in new bond formations. Notably, three types of isoindolinones can be obtained selectively by variations of the reaction conditions. Mechanistic studies shed light on the reaction pathways. Moreover, the synthetic potential of current methodology is demonstrated by providing concise routes to key intermediates of indoprofen, indobufen, aristolactams, lennoxamine, and falipamil.

Abstract: In mammalian females, oocytes are stored in the ovary and meiosis is arrested at the diplotene stage of prophase I. When females reach puberty oocytes are selectively recruited in cycles to grow, overcome the meiotic arrest, complete the first meiotic division and become mature (ready for fertilization). At a molecular level, the master regulator of prophase I arrest and meiotic resumption is the maturation-promoting factor (MPF) complex, formed by the active form of cyclin dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) and Cyclin B1. However, we still do not have complete information regarding the factors implicated in MPF activation. In this study we document that out of three mammalian serum-glucocorticoid kinase proteins (SGK1, SGK2, SGK3), mouse oocytes express only SGK1 with a phosphorylated (active) form dominantly localized in the nucleoplasm. Further, suppression of SGK1 activity in oocytes results in decreased CDK1 activation via the phosphatase cell division cycle 25B (CDC25B), consequently delaying or inhibiting nuclear envelope breakdown. Expression of exogenous constitutively active CDK1 can rescue the phenotype induced by SGK1 inhibition. These findings bring new insights into the molecular pathways acting upstream of MPF and a better understanding of meiotic resumption control by presenting a new key player SGK1 in mammalian oocytes.

Abstract: Metabolic alterations have been observed in many cancer types. The deregulated metabolism has thus become an emerging hallmark of the disease, where the metabolism is frequently rewired to aerobic glycolysis. This has led to the concept of “metabolic reprogramming”, which has therefore been extensively studied. Over the years, it has been characterized the enhancement of aerobic glycolysis, where key mutations in some of the enzymes of the TCA cycle, and the increased glucose uptake, are used by cancer cells to achieve a “metabolic phenotype” useful to gain a proliferation advantage. Many studies have highlighted in detail the signaling pathways and the molecular mechanisms responsible for the glycolytic switch. However, glycolysis is not the only metabolic process that cancer cells rely on. Oxidative Phosphorylation (OXPHOS), gluconeogenesis or the beta-oxidation of fatty acids (FAO) may be involved in the development and progression of several tumors. In some cases, these metabolisms are even more crucial than aerobic glycolysis for the tumor survival. This review will focus on the contribution of these alterations of metabolism to the development and survival of cancers. We will also analyze the molecular mechanisms by which the balance between these metabolic processes may be regulated, as well as some of the therapeutical approaches that can derive from their study.

Abstract: Summary
Stimuli-responsive smart luminescent materials capable of dynamic color emission with distinct spectral profile/intensity are highly desirable for anti-counterfeiting applications. Here, we report the dynamic manipulation of photoluminescence from metal halide CsPbX3 (X = Br, I) perovskite quantum dots (PeQDs) inside a glass medium by tuning local temperature fields in real time in combination with the efficient photothermal material CsYb2F7@glass. Benefiting from the effective protection of the inorganic glass matrix and low exciton binding energy of PeQDs, it is feasible to realize stable and reversible ON/OFF full-spectral emissions of PeQDs upon commercial 980 nm laser stimulation. The dynamic combination of downshifting PeQDs and upconverting lanthanide-doped CsYb2F7 can be elaborately designed to produce a series of erasable photochromic anti-counterfeiting patterns and multi-dimensional optical encodings.

Abstract: Summary
To survive extreme weather, antifreeze beetles have a smart thermal management system, which relies on light absorption by the black surface and energy storage by antifreeze proteins. Inspired by the energy storage behavior of antifreeze proteins, we design a composite film, which is fabricated via impregnation of organic phase change material (PCM) in a surface-modified MXene/bacterial-cellulose aerogel. The resulting composite aerogel-based PCM film shows an increased loading capacity of organic PCM, increased phase change latent heat, and enhanced mechanical properties. Combining these thermal insulation and thermal energy storage properties, a submillimeter-thick film with an aerogel layer can maintain a comfortable temperature range for more than 800 s. This is more than double compared to the system without the films, and is a proof of concept for bioinspired photothermal-conversion/thermal-storage integration.

Abstract: Tetraspanin proteins organize membrane nanodomains related to cell adhesion and migration. An essential feature conserved along the superfamily is their cone-shaped tertiary structure, which allows tetraspanins to be enriched in highly curved membrane structures. Their conical shape, together with their ability to associate to transmembrane receptors and to bind to cystoskeletal and signaling scaffolds, are key in their ability to regulate endosomal network dynamics and Extracellular Vesicle biogenesis and cargo selection. Recent evidence suggests that tetraspanins have a relevant impact in mitochondria turnover and regulation of cellular metabolism. In this review we highlight those reports that point to tetraspanins as key regulators in the communication between the endosomal network, EVs and the cellular metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
There is an urgent need for alternative compact technologies that can derive and store energy from the sun, especially the large amount of solar heat that is not effectively used for power generation. Here, we report a combination of solution- and neat-film-based molecular solar thermal (MOST) systems, where solar energy can be stored as chemical energy and released as heat, with microfabricated thermoelectric generators to produce electricity when solar radiation is not available. The photophysical properties of two MOST couples are characterized both in liquid with a catalytical cycling setup and in a phase-interconvertible neat film. Their suitable photophysical properties let us combine them individually with a microelectromechanical ultrathin thermoelectric chip to use the stored solar energy for electrical power generation. The generator can produce, as a proof of concept, a power output of up to 0.1 nW (power output per unit volume up to 1.3 W m−3). Our results demonstrate that such a molecular thermal power generation system has a high potential to store and transfer solar power into electricity and is thus potentially independent of geographical restrictions.

Abstract: Nonmuscle myosin II minifilaments have emerged as central elements for force generation and mechanosensing by mammalian cells. Each minifilament can have a different composition and activity due to the existence of the three nonmuscle myosin II paralogs A, B and C and their respective phosphorylation pattern. We have used CRISPR/Cas9-based knockout cells, quantitative image analysis and mathematical modeling to dissect the dynamic processes that control the formation and activity of heterotypic minifilaments and found a strong asymmetry between paralogs A and B. Loss of NM IIA completely abrogates regulatory light chain phosphorylation and reduces the level of assembled NM IIB. Activated NM IIB preferentially co-localizes with pre-formed NM IIA minifilaments and stabilizes the filament in a force-dependent mechanism. NM IIC is only weakly coupled to these processes. We conclude that NM IIA and B play clearly defined complementary roles during assembly of functional minifilaments. NM IIA is responsible for the formation of nascent pioneer minifilaments. NM IIB incorporates into these and acts as a clutch that limits the force output to prevent excessive NM IIA activity. Together these two paralogs form a balanced system for regulated force generation.

Abstract: Summary
Direct air capture of CO2 is often presented as a promising technology to help mitigate climate change, although proposed processes are highly energy intensive. We analyze Carbon Engineering’s 1 Mt-CO2/year natural-gas-powered direct air capture (DAC) process, which requires 273.2 MW per plant, where we find that 252 MW are irreversibly lost, corresponding to a second-law efficiency of 7.8%. Our component-level analysis details the mechanisms by which these losses of thermodynamic work potential occur in the most energy-intensive plant segments. Here, we emphasize the effects of chemical exergy dissipation in the air contactor, where stored chemical exergy is released as low-grade heat into the environment. Other major losses occur in the calciner and its preheat cyclones due to the high temperature demanded by its internal chemical reaction, as well as in the water knockout system, CO2 compression system, and power island. Finally, we illustrate the issues arising from the use of natural gas as a feedstock for heat and power, and suggest directions to pursue for further analysis and process improvements, which we consider imperative to make this DAC process a viable option for large-scale CO2 removal toward IPCC targets.

Abstract: Summary
The Li+/Ni2+ mixing in LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) leads to fast battery capacity decay. Here we report a dual-gradient nickel-rich layered cathode material (D-NMC811), using nickel-based metal organic framework of Ni-MOF-74. The formation of a protective layer with rock salt phase due to the reduced nickel oxidation state on the surface of the primary particles resists internal strain and suppresses further phase transition, thus alleviating crack generation. After 300 cycles at ⅓ C, a high half-cell capacity retention of 88.50% with 0.038% decay per cycle is observed. The full-cell battery displays a high capacity retention of >86.7% with a Coulombic efficiency of >99.86% at ⅓ C after 300 cycles. The 300 mAh pouch cell delivers an energy density of 216.4 Wh/kg. After 500 cycles at 1.0 C, it still displays 84.1% capacity retention while the battery with conventional NMC811 only shows a retention of 53.0% after 400 cycles.

Abstract: Summary
The exploration of environmentally friendly and highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts is vital to large-scale, electrochemical renewable-fuels generation. Here, we report an iron single-atom catalyst (SAC) confined in a covalent organic framework (Fe-SAC@COF), which constitutes an unusual Fe–NO coordination in the skeleton. The as-prepared Fe-SAC@COF exhibits a high mass activity of 9.20 A mg−1, which is 1.95 times higher than Ni species of the same coordination and 5.05 times higher than nanoparticulate Fe counterpart. Moreover, it shows, to the best of our knowledge, a record-low overpotential (290 mV) and Tafel slope (40 mV dec−1) among the reported atomically dispersed Fe-based catalysts and surpasses the benchmark Ir/C catalyst. The density functional theory calculation shows that the Fe–NO coordination exhibits low binding energy of oxygenated intermediates, which leads to an outstanding electrocatalytic OER performance. This work provides design strategies toward unusually coordinated SACs by prudent COF confinement for advanced electrocatalysis.

Abstract: To understand general features in evolution of kinetochore organization, investigating a wide range of mitotic mechanisms in various non-model eukaryotes is necessary. A binucleate flagellate Giardia intestinalis is a representative of highly divergent eukaryotic lineage of Metamonads. FIB/SEM tomography was used to investigate ultrastructural details of its mitotic architecture, including kinetochores. Giardia undergoes semi-open mitosis, with the nuclear envelope remaining intact except for polar fenestrae, allowing microtubules to enter the nucleoplasm. At the onset of mitosis, the nuclear envelope bends inward, forming a concave depression at the spindle poles. Spindle microtubules emanate from a cytoplasmic fuzzy microtubule organizing center near the flagellar basal bodies. Kinetochoral microtubules enter the nucleoplasm and bind to kinetochores. A small bipartite kinetochore composed of a dense inner disk, approximately 46 nm in diameter, and a two-armed outer fork, is attached to just one microtubule. To our knowledge, this is the first in situ evidence of a one-microtubule attachment to a kinetochore, which could represent a basic eukaryotic situation.

Abstract: Summary
Microalgae are natural biocatalysts of hydrogen production. Their ability to convert solar energy to valuable compounds with minimal ecological footprint potentially places them as significant contributors to the clean-energy transition. Currently, algal hydrogen production, although promising, is not scalable because it is limited to oxygen-free conditions and is short-lived due to electron loss to other processes, mainly carbon fixation. Here, we show that a strain defective in thylakoid proton gradient regulation, Δpgr5, bypasses both challenges simultaneously, leading to a prolonged 12-day hydrogen production under ambient mixotrophic conditions in a 1-L setup. We report that Δpgr5 possess a repressed ability to fixate carbon and that this limitation is counterbalanced by an enhanced chloroplast-mitochondrion energetic exchange. This unique physiology supports the simplistic, yet robust and scalable, hydrogen production capability of Δpgr5.

Abstract: Background
Rare bleeding disorders (RBD) are inherited coagulopathies, whose hemostatic control is based upon replacement therapy. Marstacimab (PF-06741086) is a human monoclonal IgG that targets the Kunitz2 domain of tissue factor pathway inhibitor [TFPI]. Marstacimab is currently in development for bleeding prophylaxis in patients with hemophilia.
Objectives
To assess the potential impact of Marstacimab upon thrombin generation (TG) in RBD patients' plasma samples.
Results
Our cohort included 18 RBD patients, with severe deficiencies: 5 Von Willebrand Disease (VWD) type 3, 4 FVII, 3 FXI, 2 FXIII deficiency and 1 patient with: FX, FV + FVIII, Fibrinogen, combined vitamin K dependent factors' deficiency. Citrated samples from RBD patients were collected and spiked with Marstacimab, TG was measured by calibrated automated thrombogram. Among all patients a reduced baseline TG was observed as compared to controls. Improvement of median (lag time, peak and ETP was observed in Marstacimab spiked samples from 8 min, 99 nM, 1116 nMx min to 5.5 min, 194 nM,1614 nMx min, respectively. None of the values measured among RBD patients exceeded normal controls.
Conclusion
These in vitro data suggest that Marstacimab may serve as a promising approach for restoring the hemostatic balance in various RBD, though potential clinical implications should be further investigated.

Abstract: Summary
Polaritons are unique hybrid light-matter states that offer an alternative way to manipulate chemical processes. In this work, we show that singlet fission dynamics can be accelerated under strong light-matter coupling. For superexchange-mediated singlet fission, state mixing speeds up the dynamics in cavities when the lower polariton is close in energy to the multiexcitonic state. This effect is more pronounced in non-conventional singlet fission materials in which the energy gap between the bright singlet exciton and the multiexcitonic state is large (>0.1 eV). In this case, the dynamics is dominated by the polaritonic modes and not by the bare-molecule-like dark states, and, additionally, the resonant enhancement due to strong coupling is robust even for energetically broad molecular states. The present results provide a new strategy to expand the range of suitable materials for efficient singlet fission by making use of strong light-matter coupling.

Abstract: Summary
The low ionization potentials make alkali atoms obliging electron donors in industrial reduction chemistry as important, general cocatalysts. Interaction between potassium atoms and nitrogen molecules co-adsorbed on metal surfaces is of interest as a model of catalytic promotion of dissociation of a reluctant precursor, N2, which is considered the rate-limiting step in the Haber-Bosch ammonia synthesis. Although the atomic-scale insight into the co-adsorption of K and N2 on metals is fundamentally important for understanding the alkali promotion chemistry, the high mobility of K atoms, the weak chemisorption of N2, and the extreme pressures and temperatures in the Haber-Bosch process obstruct investigation of their atomic-scale interactions. By scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional theory, we characterize the N2 adsorption, collective interactions, and tunneling electron-induced desorption on K/Ag(111) surface. Our study reveals the fundamental collective interactions of alkali promoters with the N2 feedstock of consequence to heterogeneous catalysis.

Abstract: Actin contributes to an exceptionally wide range of cellular processes through the assembly and disassembly of highly dynamic and ordered structures. Visualizing these structures in cells can help us understand how the molecular players of the actin machinery work together to produce force-generating systems. In recent years, cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has become the method of choice for structural analysis of the cell interior at the molecular scale. Here we review advances in cryo-ET workflows that have enabled this transformation, especially the automation of sample preparation procedures, data collection, and processing. We discuss new structural analyses of dynamic actin assemblies in cryo-preserved cells, which have provided mechanistic insights into actin assembly and function at the nanoscale. Finally, we highlight the latest visual proteomics studies of actin filaments and their interactors reaching sub-nanometer resolutions in cells.

Abstract: Summary
Piezoelectric polymers have attracted a great deal of attention for flexible electromechanical applications but still suffer from low piezoelectric coefficients (∼−24 pC/N) in commercial films. Here, we propose a dielectric micro-capacitance strategy to enhance piezoelectricity via texturing well-aligned MXene (Ti3C2Tx) sheets into a poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) matrix using a scalable blade-coating technique. This aligned MXene/PVDF composite presents a piezoelectric coefficient of −63.3 pC/N due to its improved permittivity. More importantly, a modified model of the piezo-composite is put forward to further understand the interfacial polarization and dielectric relaxation effect in this percolation system for designing piezo-composites with better performances. Notably, this work might motivate new design principles and approaches to regulate electric behavior and promote piezoelectricity in electroactive polymers.

Abstract: Summary
The conformational isomerism originated from the rotation of single bonds significantly affects the properties of conjugated molecules. However, the relatively low energy barrier of the rotation of single bonds often renders a dynamic equilibrium of multiple conformers, raising the challenges of distinguishing the accurate conformation and controlling the conformational interconversion. Here, multiple non-covalent interactions induced by the fluorine atom are introduced into the conjugated molecule to generate two metastable rotamers. The interconversion is readily controlled by solvent, wherein tetrahydrofuran and chloroform show split trends. The isomerically pure powder can be obtained from appropriate solutions. Furthermore, the film-formation process hardly affects the conformation because of the multiple non-covalent interactions. Eventually, this work unravels the effect of rotational isomerisms on optoelectronic properties in thin-film-based devices, paving the way to tune the performance of organic semiconductors by controlling the molecular conformation with multiple non-covalent interactions.

Abstract: Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) protein is mostly known as a tumor suppressor that regulates Wnt signaling, but is also an important cytoskeletal protein. Mutations in the APC gene are linked to colorectal cancer and various neurological disorders and intellectual disabilities. Cytoskeletal functions of APC appear to have significant contributions to both types of these disorders. As a cytoskeletal protein, APC can regulate both actin and microtubule cytoskeletons, which together form the main machinery for cell migration. As APC is a multifunctional protein with numerous interaction partners, the complete picture of how APC regulates cell motility is still unavailable. However, some molecular mechanisms begin to emerge. Here, we review available information about roles of APC in cell migration and propose a model explaining how microtubules, using APC as an intermediate, can initiate leading edge protrusion in response to external signals by stimulating Arp2/3 complex-dependent nucleation of branched actin filament networks via a series of intermediate events.

Abstract: Summary
Release of radioactive organic iodide into atmosphere without any treatment will seriously endanger the environment and life safety. However, removal of radioactive organic iodides is challenging due to their extremely low concentration combined with harsh operational conditions such as high humidity and acidic conditions. Here, we report the generation of mesopores from a metal-organic framework, enabling a record adsorption of >2.8 g/g at room temperature and >0.87 g/g at 423 K toward CH3I under dynamic conditions as demonstrated by breakthrough experiments. Even under humid and acidic conditions, its adsorption performance is maintained. The complete removal of CH3I (expressed by retention time) using this material under humid and acidic conditions is as long as 100 min/g, suggesting its potential application in sequestrating radioactive organic iodide. The excellent adsorption performance is mainly due to (1) physical adsorption and (2) the methylation reaction between pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid and CH3I.

Abstract: Summary
Nature uses efficient strategies to produce complex structures for hydration-induced reversible deformation. One such example is camel hair, a keratinous fiber with remarkable water-triggered shape memory. Herein, we unravel the effect of non-uniform structures on the shape memory of camel hair. By extraction and quantitative analysis of the deformation of camel hair, we describe that the shape memory of camel hair is a bending mode instead of shrinking along the long fiber axis. The shape memory process is based on anisotropic swelling, caused by the non-uniform distribution of disulfide bonds and the non-uniform thickness of the cortex layer along the cross-section. This natural actuation structure inspires the design of complex shape-memory materials with simple simulation strategies and has better biocompatibility to meet the requirements of biological applications.

Abstract: Summary
Strategies for slowing magnetic relaxation via local environmental design are vital for developing next-generation spin-based technologies (e.g., quantum information processing). Herein, we demonstrate a technique to do so via chemical design of a local magnetic environment. We show that embedding the open-shell complex (Ph4P)2[Co(SPh)4] in solid-state matrices of the isostructural, open-shell species (Ph4P)2[M(SPh)4] (M = Ni2+, S = 1; M = Fe2+, S = 2; M = Mn2+, S = 5/2) will slow magnetic relaxation for the embedded [Co(SPh)4]2– ion by three orders of magnitude. Magnetometry, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and computational analyses reveal that integer spin and large, positive zero-field splitting (D) values for the diluent produce a quiet, local magnetic field that slows relaxation rates for the embedded Co molecules. These results will enable the investigation of magnetic systems for which strictly diamagnetic congeners are either synthetically inaccessible or are not isostructural.

Biochemical characterization of actin assembly mechanisms with ALS-associated profilin variants,

Abstract: Eight separate mutations in the actin-binding protein profilin-1 have been identified as a rare cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Profilin is essential for many neuronal cell processes through its regulation of lipids, nuclear signals, and cytoskeletal dynamics, including actin filament assembly. Direct interactions between profilin and actin monomers inhibit actin filament polymerization. In contrast, profilin can also stimulate polymerization by simultaneously binding actin monomers and proline-rich tracts found in other proteins. Whether the ALS-associated mutations in profilin compromise these actin assembly functions is unclear. We performed a quantitative biochemical comparison of the direct and formin mediated impact for the eight ALS-associated profilin variants on actin assembly using classic protein-binding and single-filament microscopy assays. We determined that the binding constant of each profilin for actin monomers generally correlates with the actin nucleation strength associated with each ALS-related profilin. In the presence of formin, the A20T, R136W, Q139L, and C71G variants failed to activate the elongation phase of actin assembly. This diverse range of formin-activities is not fully explained through profilin-poly-L-proline (PLP) interactions, as all ALS-associated variants bind a formin-derived PLP peptide with similar affinities. However, chemical denaturation experiments suggest that the folding stability of these profilins impact some of these effects on actin assembly. Thus, changes in profilin protein stability and alterations in actin filament polymerization may both contribute to the profilin-mediated actin disruptions in ALS.

Abstract: Polymerization of deoxygenated sickle hemoglobin (HbS) leads to erythrocyte sickling. Enhancing activity of the erythrocyte glycolytic pathway has anti-sickling potential as this reduces 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) and increases ATP, factors that decrease HbS polymerization and improve erythrocyte membrane integrity. These factors can be modulated by mitapivat, which activates erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PKR) and improves sickling kinetics in SCD patients. We investigated mechanisms by which mitapivat may impact SCD by examining its effects in the Townes SCD mouse model. Control (HbAA) and sickle (HbSS) mice were treated with mitapivat or vehicle. Surprisingly, HbSS had higher PKR protein, higher ATP, and lower 2,3-DPG levels, compared to HbAA mice, in contrast with humans with SCD, in whom 2,3-DPG is elevated compared to healthy subjects. Despite our inability to investigate 2,3-DPG-mediated sickling and hemoglobin effects, mitapivat yielded potential benefits in HbSS mice. Mitapivat further increased ATP without significantly changing 2,3-DPG or hemoglobin levels, and decreased levels of leukocytosis, erythrocyte oxidative stress, and the percentage of erythrocytes that retained mitochondria in HbSS mice. These data suggest that, even though Townes HbSS mice have increased PKR activity, further activation of PKR with mitapivat yields potentially beneficial effects that are independent of changes in sickling or hemoglobin levels.

Abstract: Summary
Rechargeable aprotic lithium–oxygen (Li–O2) batteries are promising candidates for next-generation energy-storage devices. However, their practical application is limited by poor cycle performance because of difficulties in realizing high reaction efficiencies for both the oxygen (positive) and lithium (negative) electrodes. Herein, effective automated high-throughput robotic experiments with machine-learning methodologies using Bayesian optimization were performed to accelerate the discovery of an electrolyte suitable for realizing high reaction efficiencies for both electrodes. As a result, we identified the specific electrolyte composition (1.5 M LiNO3, 0.1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide, 0.1 M LiBr, 0.5 mM LiCl, and 10 mM lithium bis(oxalate)borate in dimethylamide, with 5 vol.% 1,3-dioxolane) that enhanced the discharge/charge performance of the Li–O2 batteries, realizing stability over 100 cycles with capacity of 0.5 mAh/cm2. Studies empowered by data-driven high-throughput-screening methods offer new opportunities for efficiently identifying electrolyte compositions and accelerating the development of next-generation rechargeable batteries.

Abstract: Summary
The electrification revolution in the automobile and other industries demands annual production capacity of batteries of at least 102 GWh, which presents a twofold challenge: supply of key materials such as cobalt and nickel and recycling when batteries are retired from use. Pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical recycling are currently used in industry but suffer from complexity, high costs, and secondary pollution. Here we report a molten-salt-based method for direct recycling (MSDR) that is environmentally benign and creates value on the basis of a techno-economic analysis using real-world data and price information. We also experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of MSDR by upcycling a low-nickel polycrystalline LiNi0.5Mn0.3Co0.2O2 (NMC) cathode material into Ni-rich (Ni > 65%) single-crystal NMCs with increased energy density (>10% increase) and outstanding electrochemical performance (>94% capacity retention after 500 cycles). This work may open opportunities for closed-loop recycling of electric vehicle batteries and manufacturing of next-generation NMC cathode materials.

Abstract: Summary
Carbon materials have attracted extensive attention in the past decades due to the rich configurations and outstanding properties. Numerous efforts have been dedicated to obtaining two-dimensional (2D) materials inheriting the properties of graphene. Herein, from first-principles calculations, we report a novel 2D carbon allotrope with a hybridized sp2-sp3 network, i.e., “grapheneplus (graphene+)”. Both the Dirac properties of graphene and the negative Poisson’s ratio (NPR) of penta-graphene are inherited in graphene+. The NPR behavior manifests itself along the out-of-plane direction only when it is stretched, namely, out-of-plane half-auxeticity, which is different from the already known NPR behavior. Besides, the Dirac nodes form a nodal loop that remains robust regardless of the application of uniaxial/biaxial strain and electric field. In addition, graphene+ is found to be energetically more stable than penta-graphene, which promises a potentially easier synthesis. In short, graphene+ could act as a strong competitor to graphene.

Abstract: Amino Acids are not only major nutrient sources, but also serve as chemical signals to control cellular growth. Rab1A recently emerged as a key component in amino acid sensing and signaling to activate the mTOR complex1 (mTORC1). In a recently published study [1], we generated tamoxifen-inducible, conditional whole-body Rab1A knockout in adult mice. These mice are viable but develop hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance. Interestingly, Rab1A ablation selectively reduces insulin expression and pancreatic beta-cell population. Mechanistically, branched chain amino acids (BCAA), through the Rab1A-mTORC1 complex, promote the stability and nuclear localization of Pdx1, a master transcription factor that controls growth, function and identity of pancreatic beta-cells. These findings reveal a role and underlying mechanism by which amino acids control body’s glucose level through a beta-cell specific function by the Rab1A-mTORC1-Pdx1 signaling axis, which has implications in both diabetes and cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) based on metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have been extensively studied for carbon capture to combat global warming. Here we report the introduction of machine learning to get more insights. Random forest models are first trained by literature data on CO2/CH4 separation, which reveal the optimum MOF structure with pore size >1 nm and surface area of ∼800 m2 g−1. Then, representative MOFs are blended into Pebax-2533 and polymer of intrinsic microporosity-1 to fabricate MMMs. The membranes demonstrate CO2 separation performances that not only agree well with model prediction, but also exceed the 2008 Robeson upper bound. In addition, knowledge transfer from CO2/CH4 to CO2/N2 separations shows better agreement with literature data compared to direct modeling, so it enables fast and resource-saving machine learning. This work applies machine learning to solve domain-specific problems and may provide implications for other membrane development.

Abstract: Summary
Metal halide perovskites with efficient and stable self-trapped exciton emission have attracted considerable attention for next-generation solid-state lighting owing to their ultrabroadband emission. However, it remains challenging to widen the color gamut and realize high color-rendering index due to the lack of highly saturated red color-emitting inorganic lead-free perovskite materials with narrow full width at half-maximum. Here, we report a lanthanide-codoped system (Cs2NaInCl6:Sb3+/Ho3+) that enables efficient blue and red emissions with photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 99% and 72%, respectively. The energy transfer efficiency in Ho3+-doped Cs2NaInCl6:Sb is up to 73%, which can overcome the weak absorption cross-section of the f-f transition of lanthanide ion and improve its luminescence performance. Benefitting from the efficient energy-transfer channel from the self-trapped excitons to Ho3+, the emission color is continuously tuned from blue to red by controlling the Ho3+-doping concentration.

Abstract: Summary
Grid-level storage of seasonal excess can be an important asset to renewable electricity. By applying the freeze-thaw thermal cycling strategy, here, we report Al-Ni molten salt batteries with effective capacity recovery over 90% after a period of 1–8 weeks as a proof-of-concept. We explore three activation methods of the nickel cathode in a molten-salt battery: (1) heat treating the cathode granules under H2/N2, (2) incorporating a partially charged NiCl2/Ni cathode, and (3) doping the molten salt electrolyte with sulfur. In particular, sulfur doping, a cost-efficient method suitable for large-scale applications, is not only effective in activating the Ni cathode initially but also invaluable for energy retention during thermal cycling. Overall, these Al-Ni molten salt batteries under thermal cycling show high retention in cell capacity over weeks, setting a direction for scalable seasonal storage.

Abstract: Summary
Artificial spin ices (ASIs) composed of coupled nanomagnets offer the possibility to create designer geometrical frustration and manipulate inter-nanomagnet interactions. In particular, by using a dimer motif consisting of two strongly coupled single-domain nanomagnets as a building block, we can control and realize intriguing antiferromagnetic physical states in which the magnetic charge is not conserved. Here we create a dimer kagome ASI system within which the antiferromagnetic order is controlled by tuning lattice geometry. Different disordered antiferromagnetic phases and the inter-nanomagnet interactions are visualized directly in demagnetized lattices with different lattice parameters. Monte Carlo simulations establish that the collective ground state consists of disordered antiferromagnetic dimers across the lattice when the intra-dimer interaction is dominant. However, for lattices governed by intra-triad-unit interactions, the ground state exhibits a long-range spin-ordered state in which the vertex magnetic charge is uniform across all triads.

Abstract: Summary
The low-temperature direct ammonia fuel cell (DAFC) is an attractive option for zero-emission transportation. However, the demonstration of high-performance and durable DAFCs and the identification of their suitable market are not yet reported. Here, we show a high-performance DAFC enabled by a hydrophobic spinel cathode, which achieves peak power density of 410 mW cm−2 and continuous operation for 80 h at 300 mA cm−2. We assemble five 50 cm2 cells into a 75 W DAFC stack, showing a comparable area-specific performance to that of the single cell. The best combination of performance and durability for the single cell and, particularly, the demonstration of, to the best of our knowledge, the world’s first DAFC bipolar stack constitute a significant development of DAFC technology. We also perform an in-depth techno-economic analysis of a 2 kW, 10 kWh DAFC system serving for drones. DAFC systems with the performance obtained herein could be a competitive power source alongside hydrogen fuel cells and Li-ion batteries.

Abstract: Summary
Flexible thermoelectric generators (f-TEGs) are promising solutions to power supply for wearable devices. However, the high fabrication costs and low output power density of conventional f-TEGs limit their applications. Here, we present a bulk-material-based f-TEG featuring multifunctional copper electrodes for heat concentration and dissipation and fabrics for comfort and heat-leakage reduction. When worn on the forehead, our f-TEG’s maximum output power density (based on the device’s area) reaches 48 μW/cm2 at a wind speed of 2 m/s and an ambient temperature of 15°C. A light-emitting diode (LED) powered by our f-TEG headband with 100 pairs of thermoelectric pillars can illuminate a paper for reading in a dark room at 17.5°C without an external heat sink or forced convection at the cold side. This work provides a general design approach for high-performance f-TEGs at a low cost. The device-level perspectives fill the critical knowledge gap between state-of-the-art material innovations and practical thermoelectric applications.

Abstract: Summary
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has been widely studied as an efficient process in energy conversion, yet the majority of studies focus on the strategies to boost the intrinsic activity of the catalyst, rather than considering the enhancement of its mass transfer ability. Herein, we produce efficient NiFe-based OER electrocatalysts with rich oxygen vacancies and abundant transport channels by an argon plasma-engraving strategy. Compared with pristine NiFe, the obtained best NiFe-plasma catalyst yields a 12.5-fold increased current density (from 80 to ∼1,000 mA cm−2) at an overpotential of 300 mV, surpassing most OER catalysts in alkaline solution. Density functional theory calculations disclose that the introduction of oxygen vacancies improve the intrinsic activity and electronic conductivity, while finite element method calculations demonstrate that the construction of catalytic interface and the creation of nanoscale transport channels facilitates mass transfer.

Abstract: Tropomodulin and tropomyosin are important components of sarcomeric thin filaments in striated muscles. Tropomyosin decorates the side of actin filaments and enhances tropomodulin capping at the pointed ends of the filaments. Their functional relationship has been extensively characterized in vitro, but in vivo and cellular studies in mammals are often complicated by the presence of functionally redundant isoforms. Here, we used the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which has a relatively simple composition of tropomodulin and tropomyosin genes, and demonstrated that tropomodulin (unc-94) and tropomyosin (lev-11) are mutually dependent on each other in their sarcomere localization and regulation of sarcomeric actin assembly. Mutation of tropomodulin caused sarcomere disorganization with formation of actin aggregates. However, the actin aggregation was suppressed when tropomyosin was depleted in the tropomodulin mutant. Tropomyosin was mislocalized to the actin aggregates in the tropomodulin mutants, while sarcomere localization of tropomodulin was lost when tropomyosin was depleted. These results indicate that tropomodulin and tropomyosin are interdependent in the regulation of organized sarcomeric assembly of actin filaments in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Lithium-ion batteries rely on particulate porous electrodes to realize high performance, especially fast-charging capabilities. To minimize the particle-wise reaction heterogeneities, a deeper understanding of these electrodes at mesoscale, i.e., hundreds of particles, is necessary. Here, we report that the seemingly random reaction heterogeneities are actually controlled by the interplay between non-equilibrium material thermodynamics and electrochemical kinetics. Our operando experiments reveal that, under constant current, autonomous dynamic loops exist that control the intra- and inter-particle phase-transformation dynamics that determine the true local current density. The combined theoretical and experimental analyses reveal that unlike other phase-transforming electrodes, not all phase-separation processes in graphite electrodes can be suppressed by high currents. Our results highlight the necessity to examine the concentration-dependent exchange current density for intercalation electrodes undergoing phase-transformation processes. Incorporating non-equilibrium thermodynamics into classical electrochemical models and electro-analytical techniques will ensure self-consistent understandings of practical electrodes toward precision design.

Abstract: Summary
The design and synthesis of separation materials for lanthanides with extremely similar properties have always been a significant challenge. Here, a two-dimensional (2D) metal–organic framework (MOF) with crystal faces similar to the [002] of ZIF-8, which theory suggests should not be stable, is predicted and synthesized by solvent evaporation between graphene layers to prepare a 2D vertical heterostructure membrane. Theoretically, the pristine cluster of 2D MOFs contains one small and 1/4 large crown pores, and the small pores can selectively adsorb lanthanide elements, causing the selective penetration of lanthanide ions. Experimentally, the selectivity of lanthanide is obtained through the membrane with La3+/Yb3+ ≈55.79 and La3+/Ce3+ ≈6.02. The interlayer entrapment of graphene stabilizes the structure of the 2D MOF, and the intercalation of the 2D MOF expands and fixes the interlayer spacing of graphene oxide, improving the stability in strong acids, the selectivity, and the ion transmittance of the membrane.

Abstract: Summary
Macroscopic supramolecular assembly (MSA) refers to rapid molecular recognition between macroscopic components (>10 μm). Normally, MSA of rigid materials relies on a so-called “flexible spacing coating” beneath surface groups to provide high molecular mobility to realize multivalent binding. However, design principle of such coatings remains elusive. Here, we report an intuitive metric based on self-healing phenomena to judge whether a film can be a “flexible spacing coating” and apply this metric to extend film systems for MSA of rigid materials. The correlation between MSA and self-healing based on poly(ethylenimine)/poly(acrylic acid) films is revealed by similar dependence of assembly ratios and healing performance on film rigidity. Films capable of self-healing within 30 s can be used as flexible spacing coating for MSA. This metric is applied to three different film systems and proven effective to design coatings for MSA of rigid materials, which is applied in advanced manufacture of heterogeneous structure.

Abstract: Summary
Despite their widespread study, lithium metal anodes still face the bottleneck problem of low average Coulombic efficiency. Herein, we adopt an electroless plating method and introduce additive (vanillin) to develop nanoscale silver hosts. The uniform nanoscale silver layer is conducive to seamless Li/Ag alloying process, thereby enabling flat lithium deposition. Since the Li/Ag alloying process occurs after the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), the seamless alloying process stabilizes the SEI, which improves the reversibility of the lithium metal anode. On this basis, a 3D-printed copper host-coated dense nanoscale silver layer is constructed, which reduces the effective current density and hence lowers the polarization of lithium deposition or stripping. Moreover, the 3D structure induces the epitaxial growth of lithium and thus alleviates the volume change of lithium metal. As a result, an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.61% is achieved in the Li/3D Ag half-cell.

Abstract: Summary
Alkali metals are expected to be used for rechargeable metal anode batteries owing to their low electrode potentials and large capacities. However, they face the well-known fatal problem of “dendritic growth” while charging. Here, we present a detailed investigation on electrolytes where alkaline earth salts are introduced to inhibit dendrite growth in alkali metal electrodeposition. Specifically, focusing on CaTFSA2 as an exemplary additive, we reveal that dendrite-free morphology upon alkali metal electrodeposition can be attained by modifying the solvation structures in dual-cation electrolytes. Addition of Ca2+ promotes alkali cation (Li+ or Na+) to form the contact ion pairs (CIPs) with the counter anions, which replaces the solvent-separated ion pairs that commonly exist in single-cation electrolytes. The strong binding of the CIPs slows the desolvation kinetics of alkali cations and, consequently, realizes a severely constrained alkali metal electrodeposition in a reaction-limited process that is required for the dendrite-free morphology.

Abstract: Abnormal coagulation dynamics, including disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, pulmonary embolism, venous thromboembolism and risk of thrombosis are often associated with the severity of COVID-19. However, very little is known about the contribution of platelets in above pathogenesis. In order to decipher the pathophysiology of thrombophilia in COVID-19, we recruited severely ill patients from ICU, based on the above symptoms and higher D-dimer levels, and compared these parameters with their asymptomatic counterparts. Elevated levels of platelet-derived microparticles and platelet-leukocyte aggregates suggested the hyperactivation of platelets in ICU patients. Strikingly, platelet transcriptome analysis showed a greater association of IL-6 and TNF signalling pathways in ICU patients along with higher plasma levels of IL-6 and TNFα. In addition, upregulation of pathways like blood coagulation and hemostasis, as well as inflammation coexisted in platelets of these patients. Further, the increment of necrotic pathway and ROS-metabolic processes in platelets was suggestive of its procoagulant phenotype in ICU patients. This study suggests that higher plasma IL-6 and TNFα may trigger platelet activation and coagulation, and in turn aggravate thrombosis and hypercoagulation in severe COVID-19 patients. Therefore, the elevated IL-6 and TNFα, may serve as potential risk factors for platelet activation and thrombophilia in these patients.

Abstract: Summary
Fe3+ is essential for human physiological function. However, excess amounts of Fe3+ are dangerous. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with high porosity, stability, and facile tunability are promising for adsorption and environmental applications. In this study, we show that thiol-functionalized Zr-MOFs can remove Fe3+ with the highest adsorption capacity (481 mg g−1) and fastest kinetics (1.07 g mg−1 h−1) reported so far, to the best of our knowledge. The MOFs, containing a high density of sulfur, are highly selective for Fe3+, rapidly purifying water with excess Fe3+ to a drinkable level. Density functional theory and projected density of states calculations confirm that Fe3+ has the largest adsorption energy on our MOFs compared with the other competitive metals tested. In addition, we find that unpaired d electrons in the Fe3+ contribute to the adsorption. Therefore, the post-functionalized Zr-MOFs with high stability, capacity, kinetics, selectivity, and recyclability are promising adsorbents for the purification of water contaminated with heavy metal ions.

Abstract: Cells release membrane-delimited particles into the environment. These particles are called “extracellular vesicles” (EVs), and EVs are present in fluids contacting cells, including body fluids and conditioned culture media. Because EVs change and contribute to health and disease, EVs have become a hot topic. From the thousands of papers now published on EVs annually, one easily gets the impression that EVs provide biomarkers for all diseases, and that EVs are carriers of all relevant biomolecules and are omnipotent therapeutics. At the same time, EVs are heterogeneous, elusive and difficult to study due to their physical properties and the complex composition of their environment. This overview addresses the current challenges encountered when working with EVs, and how we envision that most of these challenges will be overcome in the near future. Right now, an infrastructure is being developed to improve the reproducibility of EV measurement results. This infrastructure comprises expert task forces of the International Society of Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) developing guidelines and recommendations, instrument calibration, standardized and transparent reporting, and education. Altogether, these developments will support the credibility of EV research by introducing robust reproducibility, which is a prerequisite for understanding their biological significance and biomarker potential.

Iron metabolism in the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum: A role for ferric chelate reductases,

Abstract: Iron is the most abundant transition metal in all living organisms and is essential for several cellular activities, including respiration, oxygen transport, energy production and regulation of gene expression. Iron starvation is used by professional phagocytes, from Dictyostelium to macrophages, as a form of defense mechanism against intracellular pathogens. Previously, we showed that Dictyostelium cells express the proton-driven iron transporter Nramp1 (Natural Resistance-Associated Macrophage Protein 1) and the homolog NrampB (Nramp2) in membranes of macropinosomes and phagosomes or of the contractile vacuole network, respectively. The Nramp-driven transport of iron across membranes is selective for ferrous ions. Since iron is mostly present as ferric ions in growth media and in engulfed bacteria, we have looked for proteins with ferric reductase activity. The Dictyostelium genome does not encode for classical STEAP (Six-Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of Prostate) ferric reductases, but harbors three genes encoding putative ferric chelate reductase belonging to the Cytochrome b561 family containing a N terminus DOMON domain (DOpamine β-MONooxygenase N-terminal domain). We have cloned the three genes, naming them fr1A, fr1B and fr1C. fr1A and fr1B are mainly expressed in the vegetative stage while fr1C is highly expressed in the post aggregative stage. All three reductases are localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, but Fr1A is also found in endolysosomal vesicles, in the Golgi and, to a much lower degree, in the plasma membrane, whereas Fr1C is homogeneously distributed in the plasma membrane and in macropinosomal and phagosomal membranes. To gain insight in the function of the three genes we generated KO mutants, but gene disruption was successful only for two of them (fr1A and fr1C), being very likely lethal for fr1B. fr1A- shows a slight delay in the aggregation stage of development, while fr1C- gives rise to large multi-tipped streams during aggregation and displays a strong delay in fruiting body formation. The two single mutants display altered cell growth under conditions of ferric ions overloading and, in the ability to reduce Fe3+, confirming a role of these putative ferric reductases in iron reduction and transport from endo-lysosomal vesicles to the cytosol.

Estimation of expression of BAALC gene (Brain and Acute Leukemia, Cytoplasmic) mRNA level is one of the predictive markers which has been identified in multiple studies. In this study, we examined the clinical and prognostic value of BAALC gene expression in 149 adult CN-AML patients. We also utilized multi-omics databases to ascertain the association of BAALC gene expression with comprehensive molecular and clinicopathologic features in AML. BAALC overexpression was associated with CD34 positivity on leukemic blasts (p = 0.0026) and the absence of NPM1 gene mutation (p < 0.0001), presence of RUNX1 gene mutation (p < 0.001) and poor patient outcomes, particularly in NPM1–wild type/FLT3-ITD negative adult CN-AML patients. Additionally, BAALC expression was associated with the alteration of methylation of its promoter. Further, pathway analysis revealed that BAALC expression is correlated with MYC targets and Ras signalling. We conclude that high BAALC expression associates with poor patient outcome in NPM1–wild type/FLT3-ITD negative adult CN-AML patients.

Abstract: Summary
Carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a promising technology for mitigating greenhouse gas emission and achieving carbon neutrality. However, coupling CO2RR with other reactions to produce high value-added chemicals remains a challenge. In this work, we report self-assembled nanofibers composed of ultrathin AuCu alloy nanowires possessing a Boerdijk-Coxeter structure with (111)-dominant facets for the electrosynthesis of urea by coupling CO2RR with nitrite reduction reaction (NO2−RR). The rich structural defects and AuCu bimetallic alloy composition provide a large number of highly catalytically active sites. The constructed AuCu nanofibers display excellent urea synthesis performance in the electrolyte solution containing 0.01 M KNO2 with continuous drumming of CO2, achieving a high urea yield rate of up to 3,889.6 μg h−1 mg−1cat. and a high faradic efficiency of 24.7% at −1.55 V (versus Ag/AgCl). This work provides a feasible method for the rational design of self-assembled bimetallic nanofibers for electrosynthesis of urea under ambient conditions.

Abstract: Sepsis remains an important health problem worldwide due to inefficient treatments often resulting in multi-organ failure. Neutrophil recruitment is critical during sepsis. While neutrophils are required to combat invading bacteria, excessive neutrophil recruitment contributes to tissue damage due to their arsenal of molecular weapons that do not distinguish between host and pathogen. Thus, neutrophil recruitment needs to be fine-tuned to ensure bacterial killing, while avoiding neutrophil-inflicted tissue damage. We recently showed that the actin-binding protein HS1 promotes neutrophil extravasation; and hypothesized that HS1 is also a critical regulator of sepsis progression. We evaluated the role of HS1 in a model of lethal sepsis induced by cecal-ligation and puncture. We found that septic HS1-deficient mice had a better survival rate compared to WT mice due to absence of lung damage. Lungs of septic HS1-deficient mice showed less inflammation, fibrosis, and vascular congestion. Importantly, systemic CLP-induced neutrophil recruitment was attenuated in the lungs, the peritoneum and the cremaster in the absence of HS1. Lungs of HS1-deficient mice produced significantly more interleukin-10. Compared to WT neutrophils, those HS1-deficient neutrophils that reached the lungs had increased surface levels of Gr-1, ICAM-1, and L-selectin. Interestingly, HS1-deficient neutrophils had similar F-actin content and phagocytic activity, but they failed to polymerize actin and deform in response to CXCL-1 likely explaining the reduced systemic neutrophil recruitment in HS1-deficient mice. Our data show that HS1 deficiency protects against sepsis by attenuating neutrophil recruitment to amounts sufficient to combat bacterial infection, but insufficient to induce tissue damage.

Abstract: Summary
Possessing a characteristic sandwich-type structure, metallocenes have been widely used by the chemistry community. However, the direct catalytic C−H heteroarylation of metallocenes still remains underexplored. Here, we report an efficient catalytic protocol for C−H heteroarylation of group 8 metallocenes (M = Fe, Ru) under light irradiation. This intermolecular cross coupling features directing group free, mild conditions and a wide substrate scope. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that the newly formed C−C bond is constructed through electrophilic radical substitution of the metallocene with a heteroaryl radical, which is generated via an oxidative quenching pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Two-dimensional (2D) π-conjugated polymers are promising electronic materials with diverse properties controlled by varying the structure of organic building blocks. We here report an organic framework with perchlorotriphenylmethyl (PTM) radical nodes, synthesized through dehalogenative thermolysis polymerization of tris(iodotetrachlorophenyl)methane. The resulting C-C-linked P2PTM is characterized by X-ray photoelectron, NMR, Raman, and FTIR spectroscopies and X-ray diffraction. Exfoliated, layered 2D sheets can be imaged with TEM and AFM. N2 adsorption experiment indicates a permanent porosity with a surface area of 150 m2/g, and dynamic vapor sorption shows a specific adsorption of one chloroform molecule per P2PTM unit cell, in line with modeling. DFT calculations predict degenerate Mott-insulating antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic states, while the semi-metallic closed-shell configuration is less stable by ∼1 eV. Experimentally, P2PTM is a low-bandgap black solid with moderate electrical conductivity (∼4 × 10−4 S cm−1), gate-modulated ambipolar charge transport and paramagnetic behavior down to 1.9 K.

Abstract: Summary
Micro-supercapacitors are poised to serve as on-chip power sources for electronics. However, the challenge to simultaneously increase their power, energy, and lifetime demands new material combinations beyond current carbon-based systems. Here, we demonstrate that electro-deposition of an open-shell conjugated polymer with reduced graphene oxide achieves electrodes with capacitance up to 186 mF cm−2 (372 F cm−3). The extended delocalization within the open-shell polymer stabilizes redox states and facilitates a 3 V wide potential window, while the hierarchical electrode structure promotes ultrafast kinetics. The micro-supercapacitor shows a high power density of 227 mW cm−2 with an energy density of 10.5 μWh cm−2 and stability of 84% capacitance retention after 11,000 cycles. These attributes allow operation at 120 Hz for fast charging and alternating current (AC) line filtering applications, which may be suitable to replace bulky electrolytic capacitors or serve as high-endurance energy storage for wireless electronics.

Abstract: Summary
Molybdenum and tungsten carbides (Mo2C and WC) are promising catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but their electrocatalytic activities are still inferior to theoretical predictions. Herein, density functional theory (DFT) calculations imply that WC-Mo2C heterostructure may exert a high HER performance since the hybridization of WC and Mo2C can optimize the proton adsorption energy and energy barrier for water dissociation. To test this predication, we prepare the WC-Mo2C heterostructure on a flexible carbon cloth (CC). The obtained WC-Mo2C@CC exhibits notable HER activity (η10 = 122 mV; η500 = 309 mV) and stability (continuous 100 h at 500 mA cm−2) in alkaline media. Furthermore, a solar-panel-driven electrolyzer, including the WC-Mo2C@CC cathode and a NiFe-LDH@Nif anode, operates at 10 mA cm−2 with a cell voltage of 1.51 V in 10 M KOH at 70°C, demonstrating its potential for practical applications. Overall, this work offers an atomic-level insight into designing advanced carbide HER electrocatalysts.

Abstract: Podosomes are highly dynamic actin-rich structures in a variety of cell types, especially monocytic cells. They fulfill multiple functions such as adhesion, mechanosensing, or extracellular matrix degradation, thus allowing cells to detect and respond to a changing environment. These abilities are based on an intricate architecture that enables podosomes to sense mechanical properties of their substratum and to transduce them intracellularly in order to generate an appropriate cellular response. These processes are enabled through the tightly orchestrated interplay of more than 300 different components that are dynamically recruited during podosome formation and turnover. In this review, we discuss the different phases of the podosome life cycle and the current knowledge on regulatory factors that impact on the genesis, activity, dissolution and reemergence of podosomes. We also highlight mechanoregulatory processes that become important during these different stages, on the level of individual podosomes, and also at podosome sub- and superstructures.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding charge carrier extraction from the perovskite photoactive layer is critical to optimizing the design of perovskite solar cells. Herein, we demonstrate a simple time-resolved photoluminescence method to characterize the kinetics of charge transport across the bulk perovskite and charge transfer from the perovskite layer to the interlayers, elucidating the dependence of these dynamics on film thickness, grain boundaries (GBs), and interlayers. Using asymmetric laser excitation, we selectively probe charge transport by generating charges both close to and far from the heterojunction interface and correlate these results with device performance. We observe that both film thickness and GBs affect the asymmetry between electron and hole charge transport across the bulk perovskite and charge transfer from the bulk perovskite to the respective interlayers.

Abstract: Summary
Soft robotics, characterized by structural compliance, offers advantages when handling fragile objects and interacting with humans. Modeling the mechanical behavior of soft robots, however, is often overlooked in previous studies due to the difficulty of capturing their nonlinear deformation. In this work, we present a highly efficient predictor for pneumatic actuation utilizing a combination of data-driven surrogate modeling and physics-based optimization. This hybrid methodology explicitly captures the nonlinear mechanics of pneumatic components, which greatly accelerates the searching of static equilibrium, and thus help elucidate how the overall grasping system will interact with the environment. We have additively manufactured and tested a robotic device on various objects. Results show that our model can predict pneumatic actuation very closely matching to that of the experiments with orders of magnitude faster computational speed than traditional numerical simulations. Moreover, the proposed framework can be extended to model various soft robotic devices with nonlinear actuation components.
