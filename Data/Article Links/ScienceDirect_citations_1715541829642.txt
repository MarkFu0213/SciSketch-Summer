Abstract: Summary
A causal role of gene amplification in tumorigenesis is well known, whereas amplification of DNA regulatory elements as an oncogenic driver remains unclear. In this study, we integrated next-generation sequencing approaches to map distant estrogen response elements (DEREs) that remotely control the transcription of target genes through chromatin proximity. Two densely mapped DERE regions located on chromosomes 17q23 and 20q13 were frequently amplified in estrogen receptor-α-positive luminal breast cancer. These aberrantly amplified DEREs deregulated target gene expression potentially linked to cancer development and tamoxifen resistance. Progressive accumulation of DERE copies was observed in normal breast progenitor cells chronically exposed to estrogenic chemicals. These findings may extend to other DNA regulatory elements, the amplification of which can profoundly alter target transcriptome during tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Summary
To bridge the gap between in vivo and in vitro molecular mechanisms, we dissected the transcriptional control of the endogenous histone gene cluster (His-C) by single-cell imaging. A combination of quantitative immunofluorescence, RNA FISH, and FRAP measurements revealed atypical promoter recognition complexes and differential transcription kinetics directing histone H1 versus core histone gene expression. While H1 is transcribed throughout S phase, core histones are only transcribed in a short pulse during early S phase. Surprisingly, no TFIIB or TFIID was detectable or functionally required at the initiation complexes of these promoters. Instead, a highly stable, preloaded TBP/TFIIA “pioneer” complex primes the rapid initiation of His-C transcription during early S phase. These results provide mechanistic insights for the role of gene-specific core promoter factors and implications for cell cycle-regulated gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
In contrast to its close homolog CDK4, the cell cycle kinase CDK6 is expressed at high levels in lymphoid malignancies. In a model for p185BCR-ABL+ B-acute lymphoid leukemia, we show that CDK6 is part of a transcription complex that induces the expression of the tumor suppressor p16INK4a and the pro-angiogenic factor VEGF-A. This function is independent of CDK6’s kinase activity. High CDK6 expression thus suppresses proliferation by upregulating p16INK4a, providing an internal safeguard. However, in the absence of p16INK4a, CDK6 can exert its full tumor-promoting function by enhancing proliferation and stimulating angiogenesis. The finding that CDK6 connects cell-cycle progression to angiogenesis confirms CDK6’s central role in hematopoietic malignancies and could underlie the selection pressure to upregulate CDK6 and silence p16INK4a.

Abstract: Summary
Posttranslational modification with the small ubiquitin-related modifier SUMO depends on the sequential activities of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes. While regulation by E3 ligases and SUMO proteases is well understood, current knowledge of E2 regulation is very limited. Here, we describe modification of the budding yeast E2 enzyme Ubc9 by sumoylation (Ubc9*SUMO). Although less than 1% of Ubc9 is sumoylated at Lys153 at steady state, a sumoylation-deficient mutant showed significantly reduced meiotic SUMO conjugates and abrogates synaptonemal complex formation. Biochemical analysis revealed that Ubc9*SUMO is severely impaired in its classical activity but promoted SUMO chain assembly in the presence of Ubc9. Ubc9*SUMO cooperates with charged Ubc9 (Ubc9∼SUMO) by noncovalent backside SUMO binding and by positioning the donor SUMO for optimal transfer. Thus, sumoylation of Ubc9 converts an active enzyme into a cofactor and reveals a mechanism for E2 regulation that orchestrates catalytic (Ubc9∼SUMO) and noncatalytic (Ubc9*SUMO) functions of Ubc9.

Abstract: Summary
The formation of the vascular system is essential for embryonic development and homeostasis. However, transcriptional control of this process is not fully understood. Here we report an evolutionarily conserved role for the transcription factor CASZ1 (CASTOR) in blood vessel assembly and morphogenesis. In the absence of CASZ1, Xenopus embryos fail to develop a branched and lumenized vascular system, and CASZ1-depleted human endothelial cells display dramatic alterations in adhesion, morphology, and sprouting. Mechanistically, we show that CASZ1 directly regulates Epidermal Growth Factor-Like Domain 7 (Egfl7). We further demonstrate that defects of CASZ1- or EGFL7-depleted cells are in part due to diminished RhoA expression and impaired focal adhesion localization. Moreover, these abnormal endothelial cell behaviors in CASZ1-depleted cells can be rescued by restoration of Egfl7. Collectively, these studies show that CASZ1 is required to directly regulate an EGFL7/RhoA-mediated pathway to promote vertebrate vascular development.

Abstract: Summary
Limited clinical benefits derived from anti-VEGF therapy have driven the identification of new targets involved in tumor angiogenesis. Here, we report an integrative meta-analysis to define the transcriptional program underlying angiogenesis in human cancer. This approach identified ELTD1, an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor whose expression is induced by VEGF/bFGF and repressed by DLL4 signaling. Extensive analysis of multiple cancer types demonstrates significant upregulation of ELTD1 in tumor-associated endothelial cells, with a higher expression correlating with favorable prognosis. Importantly, ELTD1 silencing impairs endothelial sprouting and vessel formation in vitro and in vivo, drastically reducing tumor growth and greatly improving survival. Collectively, these results provide insight into the regulation of tumor angiogenesis and highlight ELTD1 as key player in blood vessel formation.

Abstract: Summary
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are derived from mammalian embryos during the transition from totipotency, when individual blastomeres can make all lineages, to pluripotency, when they are competent to make only embryonic lineages. ESCs maintained with inhibitors of MEK and GSK3 (2i) are thought to represent an embryonically restricted ground state. However, we observed heterogeneous expression of the extraembryonic endoderm marker Hex in 2i-cultured embryos, suggesting that 2i blocked development prior to epiblast commitment. Similarly, 2i ESC cultures were heterogeneous and contained a Hex-positive fraction primed to differentiate into trophoblast and extraembryonic endoderm. Single Hex-positive ESCs coexpressed epiblast and extraembryonic genes and contributed to all lineages in chimeras. The cytokine LIF, necessary for ESC self-renewal, supported the expansion of this population but did not directly support Nanog-positive epiblast-like ESCs. Thus, 2i and LIF support a totipotent state comparable to early embryonic cells that coexpress embryonic and extraembryonic determinants.

Abstract: Summary
The miR-294 and miR-302 microRNAs promote the abbreviated G1 phase of the embryonic stem cell (ESC) cell cycle and suppress differentiation induced by let-7. Here, we evaluated the role of the retinoblastoma (Rb) family proteins in these settings. Under normal growth conditions, miR-294 promoted the rapid G1-S transition independent of the Rb family. In contrast, miR-294 suppressed the further accumulation of cells in G1 in response to nutrient deprivation and cell-cell contact in an Rb-dependent fashion. We uncovered five additional miRNAs (miR-26a, miR-99b, miR-193, miR-199a-5p, and miR-218) that silenced ESC self-renewal in the absence of other miRNAs, all of which were antagonized by miR-294 and miR-302. Four of the six differentiation-inducing miRNAs induced an Rb-dependent G1 accumulation. However, all six still silenced self-renewal in the absence of the Rb proteins. These results show that the miR-294/miR-302 family acts through Rb-dependent and -independent pathways to regulate the G1 restriction point and the silencing of self-renewal, respectively.

Abstract: Summary
Fusion of haploid cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae generates zygotes. We observe that the zygote midzone includes a septin annulus and differentially affects redistribution of supramolecular complexes and organelles. Redistribution across the midzone of supramolecular complexes (polysomes and Sup35p-GFP [PSI+]) is unexpectedly delayed relative to soluble proteins; however, in [psi-] × [PSI+] crosses, all buds eventually receive Sup35p-GFP [PSI+]. Encounter between parental mitochondria is further delayed until septins relocate to the bud site, where they are required for repolarization of the actin cytoskeleton. This delay allows rationalization of the longstanding observation that terminal zygotic buds preferentially inherit a single mitochondrial genotype. The rate of redistribution of complexes and organelles determines whether their inheritance will be uniform.

Abstract: Summary
Bacterial persisters are phenotypic variants that form from the action of stress response pathways triggering toxin-mediated antibiotic tolerance. Although persisters form during normal growth from native stresses, the pathways responsible for this phenomenon remain elusive. Here we have discovered that carbon source transitions stimulate the formation of fluoroquinolone persisters in Escherichia coli. Further, through a combination of genetic, biochemical, and flow cytometric assays in conjunction with a mathematical model, we have reconstructed a molecular-level persister formation pathway from initial stress (glucose exhaustion) to the activation of a metabolic toxin-antitoxin (TA) module (the ppGpp biochemical network) resulting in inhibition of DNA gyrase activity, the primary target of fluoroquinolones. This pathway spans from initial stress to antibiotic target and demonstrates that TA behavior can be exhibited by a metabolite-enzyme interaction (ppGpp-SpoT), in contrast to classical TA systems that involve only protein and/or RNA.

Abstract: Summary
How the brain perceives sensory information and generates meaningful behavior depends critically on its underlying circuitry. The protocerebral bridge (PB) is a major part of the insect central complex (CX), a premotor center that may be analogous to the human basal ganglia. Here, by deconstructing hundreds of PB single neurons and reconstructing them into a common three-dimensional framework, we have constructed a comprehensive map of PB circuits with labeled polarity and predicted directions of information flow. Our analysis reveals a highly ordered information processing system that involves directed information flow among CX subunits through 194 distinct PB neuron types. Circuitry properties such as mirroring, convergence, divergence, tiling, reverberation, and parallel signal propagation were observed; their functional and evolutional significance is discussed. This layout of PB neuronal circuitry may provide guidelines for further investigations on transformation of sensory (e.g., visual) input into locomotor commands in fly brains.

Abstract: Summary
The essential helicase-like protein Sen1 mediates termination of RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) transcription at snoRNAs and other noncoding RNAs in yeast. A mutation in the Pol II subunit Rpb1 that increases the elongation rate increases read-through transcription at Sen1-mediated terminators. Termination and growth defects in sen1 mutant cells are partially suppressed by a slowly transcribing Pol II mutant and are exacerbated by a faster-transcribing Pol II mutant. Deletion of the nuclear exosome subunit Rrp6 allows visualization of noncoding RNA intermediates that are terminated but not yet processed. Sen1 mutants or faster-transcribing Pol II increase the average lengths of preprocessed snoRNA, CUT, and SUT transcripts, while slowed Pol II transcription produces shorter transcripts. These connections between transcription rate and Sen1 activity support a model whereby kinetic competition between elongating Pol II and Sen1 helicase establishes the temporal and spatial window for early Pol II termination.

Abstract: In plants, transgenes with inverted repeats are used to induce efficient RNA silencing, which is also frequently induced by highly transcribed sense transgenes. RNA silencing induced by sense transgenes is dependent on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 (RDR6), which converts single-stranded (ss) RNA into double-stranded (ds) RNA. By contrast, it has been proposed that RNA silencing induced by self-complementary hairpin RNA (hpRNA) does not require RDR6, because the hpRNA can directly fold back on itself to form dsRNA. However, it is unclear whether RDR6 plays a role in hpRNA-induced RNA silencing by amplifying dsRNA to spread RNA silencing within the plant. To address the efficiency of hpRNA-induced RNA silencing in the presence or absence of RDR6, Wild type (WT, Col-0) and rdr6-11 Arabidopsis thaliana lines expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) were generated and transformed with a GFP-RNA interference (RNAi) construct. Whereas most GFP-RNAi-transformed WT lines exhibited almost complete silencing of GFP expression in the T1 generation, various levels of GFP expression remained among the GFP-RNAi-transformed rdr6-11 lines. Homozygous expression of GFP-RNAi in the T3 generation was not sufficient to induce complete GFP silencing in several rdr6-11 lines. Our results indicate that RDR6 is required for efficient hpRNA-induced RNA silencing in plants.

Abstract: Summary
Carriers of BRCA1 germline mutations are predisposed to breast and ovarian cancers. Accumulated evidence shows that BRCA1 is quickly recruited to DNA lesions and plays an important role in the DNA damage response. However, the mechanism by which BRCA1 is recruited to DNA damage sites remains elusive. BRCA1 forms a Ring-domain heterodimer with BARD1, a major partner of BRCA1 that contains tandem BRCA1 C-terminus (BRCT) motifs. Here, we identify the BRCTs of BARD1 as a poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR)-binding module. The binding of the BARD1 BRCTs to PAR targets the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer to DNA damage sites. Thus, our study uncovers a PAR-dependent mechanism of rapid recruitment of BRCA1/BARD1 to DNA damage sites.

Abstract: Summary
Despite success with BRAFV600E inhibitors, therapeutic responses in patients with metastatic melanoma are short-lived because of the acquisition of drug resistance. We identified a mechanism of intrinsic multidrug resistance based on the survival of a tumor cell subpopulation. Treatment with various drugs, including cisplatin and vemurafenib, uniformly leads to enrichment of slow-cycling, long-term tumor-maintaining melanoma cells expressing the H3K4-demethylase JARID1B/KDM5B/PLU-1. Proteome-profiling revealed an upregulation in enzymes of mitochondrial oxidative-ATP-synthesis (oxidative phosphorylation) in this subpopulation. Inhibition of mitochondrial respiration blocked the emergence of the JARID1Bhigh subpopulation and sensitized melanoma cells to therapy, independent of their genotype. Our findings support a two-tiered approach combining anticancer agents that eliminate rapidly proliferating melanoma cells with inhibitors of the drug-resistant slow-cycling subpopulation.

Abstract: Summary
Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays critical roles during embryogenesis, tissue homeostasis, and regeneration. How Wnt-receptor complex activity is regulated is not yet fully understood. Here, we identify the Ly6 family protein LY6/PLAUR domain-containing 6 (Lypd6) as a positive feedback regulator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. lypd6 enhances Wnt signaling in zebrafish and Xenopus embryos and in mammalian cells, and it is required for wnt8-mediated patterning of the mesoderm and neuroectoderm during zebrafish gastrulation. Lypd6 is GPI anchored to the plasma membrane and physically interacts with the Wnt receptor Frizzled8 and the coreceptor Lrp6. Biophysical and biochemical evidence indicates that Lypd6 preferentially localizes to raft membrane domains, where Lrp6 is phosphorylated upon Wnt stimulation. lypd6 knockdown or mislocalization of the Lypd6 protein to nonraft membrane domains shifts Lrp6 phosphorylation to these domains and inhibits Wnt signaling. Thus, Lypd6 appears to control Lrp6 activation specifically in membrane rafts, which is essential for downstream signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are critical determinants of the fate of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and hematopoiesis. Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), which is induced by oxidative stress, is a known regulator of intracellular ROS. Txnip−/− old mice exhibited elevated ROS levels in hematopoietic cells and showed a reduction in hematopoietic cell population. Loss of TXNIP led to a dramatic reduction of mouse survival under oxidative stress. TXNIP directly regulated p53 protein by interfering with p53- mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) interactions and increasing p53 transcriptional activity. Txnip−/− mice showed downregulation of the antioxidant genes induced by p53. Introduction of TXNIP or p53 into Txnip−/− bone marrow cells rescued the HSC frequency and greatly increased survival in mice following oxidative stress. Overall, these data indicate that TXNIP is a regulator of p53 and plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of the hematopoietic cells by regulating intracellular ROS during oxidative stress.

Abstract: Summary
Laforin or malin deficiency causes Lafora disease, characterized by altered glycogen metabolism and teenage-onset neurodegeneration with intractable and invariably fatal epilepsy. Plant starches possess small amounts of metabolically essential monophosphate esters. Glycogen contains similar phosphate amounts, which are thought to originate from a glycogen synthase error side reaction and therefore lack any specific function. Glycogen is also believed to lack monophosphates at glucosyl carbon C6, an essential phosphorylation site in plant starch metabolism. We now show that glycogen phosphorylation is not due to a glycogen synthase side reaction, that C6 is a major glycogen phosphorylation site, and that C6 monophosphates predominate near centers of glycogen molecules and positively correlate with glycogen chain lengths. Laforin or malin deficiency causes C6 hyperphosphorylation, which results in malformed long-chained glycogen that accumulates in many tissues, causing neurodegeneration in brain. Our work advances the understanding of Lafora disease pathogenesis and suggests that glycogen phosphorylation has important metabolic function.

Abstract: Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is a major problem in our society. The development of new treatment options for OA is limited, because the pathophysiological mechanisms are not clearly understood, especially on the molecular level. Aquaporin 1 (AQP1) is a specific protein channels for water transport; it is expressed in articular chondrocytes, human synovitis, in chondrocytes of patients with rheumatoid arthritis or OA and in chondrocyte-like cells of human intervertebral disc. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of AQP1, through immunohistochemistry, immunocytochemistry and Western blot, in experimentally induced OA knee menisci. AQP1 was studied in vivo in knee OA menisci from 36 rats that underwent medial or lateral meniscectomy, and in vitro on fibrochondrocytes derived from knee OA menisci rats. OA in rats was experimentally induced and tested by histomorphometric analysis. Histological results demonstrated structural alterations in OA menisci accompanied by a very strong AQP1 immunohistochemical and immunocytochemical staining. The Western blot analysis confirmed a strong expression of AQP1 in OA fibrochondrocytes cells. The results of the present research suggest that an activation of AQP1, induced by the OA process, may represent an endogenous mechanism, which can be used to control the tissue degeneration within OA articular joints.

Abstract: Summary
Cytokinesis entails cell invagination by a contractile actomyosin ring. In epithelia, E-cadherin-mediated adhesion connects the cortices of contacting cells; thus, it is unclear how invagination occurs, how the new junction forms, and how tissue integrity is preserved. Investigations in Drosophila embryos first show that apicobasal cleavage is polarized: invagination is faster from the basal than from the apical side. Ring contraction but not its polarized constriction is controlled by septin filaments and Anillin. Polarized cleavage is due instead to mechanical anchorage of the ring to E-cadherin complexes. Formation of the new junction requires local adhesion disengagement in the cleavage furrow, followed by new E-cadherin complex formation at the new interface. E-cadherin disengagement depends on the tension exerted by the cytokinetic ring and by neighboring cells. We uncover intrinsic and extrinsic forces necessary for cytokinesis and present a framework for understanding how tissue cohesion is preserved during epithelial division.

Abstract: Summary
ERdj5 is a member of the protein disulfide isomerase family of proteins localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of mammalian cells. To date, only a limited number of substrates for ERdj5 are known. Here we identify a number of endogenous substrates that form mixed disulfides with ERdj5, greatly expanding its client repertoire. ERdj5 previously had been thought to exclusively reduce disulfides in proteins destined for dislocation to the cytosol for degradation. However, we demonstrate here that for one of the identified substrates, the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), ERdj5 is required not for degradation, but rather for efficient folding. Our results demonstrate that the crucial role of ERdj5 is to reduce non-native disulfides formed during productive folding and that this requirement is dependent on its interaction with BiP. Hence, ERdj5 acts as the ER reductase, both preparing misfolded proteins for degradation and catalyzing the folding of proteins that form obligatory non-native disulfides.

Abstract: Summary
Crosstalk between H2B ubiquitylation (H2Bub) and H3 K4 methylation plays important roles in coordinating functions of diverse cofactors during transcription activation. The underlying mechanism for this trans-tail signaling pathway is poorly defined in higher eukaryotes. Here, we show the following: (1) ASH2L in the MLL complex is essential for H2Bub-dependent H3 K4 methylation. Deleting or mutating K99 of the N-terminal winged helix (WH) motif in ASH2L abrogates H2Bub-dependent regulation. (2) Crosstalk can occur in trans and does not require ubiquitin to be on nucleosomes or histones to exert regulatory effects. (3) trans-regulation by ubiquitin promotes MLL activity for all three methylation states. (4) MLL3, an MLL homolog, does not respond to H2Bub, highlighting regulatory specificity for MLL family histone methyltransferases. Altogether, our results potentially expand the classic histone crosstalk to nonhistone proteins, which broadens the scope of chromatin regulation by ubiquitylation signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Chromodomain Helicase DNA binding protein 5 (CHD5) is a tumor suppressor mapping to 1p36, a genomic region that is frequently deleted in human cancer. Although CHD5 belongs to the CHD family of chromatin-remodeling proteins, whether its tumor-suppressive role involves an interaction with chromatin is unknown. Here we report that Chd5 binds the unmodified N terminus of H3 through its tandem plant homeodomains (PHDs). Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation studies reveal preferential binding of Chd5 to loci lacking the active mark H3K4me3 and also identify Chd5 targets implicated in cancer. Chd5 mutations that abrogate H3 binding are unable to inhibit proliferation or transcriptionally modulate target genes, which leads to tumorigenesis in vivo. Unlike wild-type Chd5, Chd5-PHD mutants are unable to induce differentiation or efficiently suppress the growth of human neuroblastoma in vivo. Our work defines Chd5 as an N-terminally unmodified H3-binding protein and provides functional evidence that this interaction orchestrates chromatin-mediated transcriptional programs critical for tumor suppression.

Abstract: Summary
There is widespread interest in macrophages as a therapeutic target in cancer. Here, we demonstrate that trabectedin, a recently approved chemotherapeutic agent, induces rapid apoptosis exclusively in mononuclear phagocytes. In four mouse tumor models, trabectedin caused selective depletion of monocytes/macrophages in blood, spleens, and tumors, with an associated reduction of angiogenesis. By using trabectedin-resistant tumor cells and myeloid cell transfer or depletion experiments, we demonstrate that cytotoxicity on mononuclear phagocytes is a key component of its antitumor activity. Monocyte depletion, including tumor-associated macrophages, was observed in treated tumor patients. Trabectedin activates caspase-8-dependent apoptosis; selectivity for monocytes versus neutrophils and lymphocytes is due to differential expression of signaling and decoy TRAIL receptors. This unexpected property may be exploited in different therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Recognition of the multiple roles of Hedgehog signaling in cancer has prompted intensive efforts to develop targeted pathway inhibitors. Leading inhibitors in clinical development act by binding to a common site within Smoothened, a critical pathway component. Acquired Smoothened mutations, including SMOD477G, confer resistance to these inhibitors. Here, we report that itraconazole and arsenic trioxide, two agents in clinical use that inhibit Hedgehog signaling by mechanisms distinct from that of current Smoothened antagonists, retain inhibitory activity in vitro in the context of all reported resistance-conferring Smoothened mutants and GLI2 overexpression. Itraconazole and arsenic trioxide, alone or in combination, inhibit the growth of medulloblastoma and basal cell carcinoma in vivo, and prolong survival of mice with intracranial drug-resistant SMOD477G medulloblastoma.

Abstract: Summary
Polarized movement of auxin generates concentration gradients within plant tissues to control cell division patterns and growth direction by modulating microtubule organization. In this study, we identify a reverse mechanism, wherein microtubules influence polar auxin transport. We show that the microtubule-associated protein CLASP interacts with the retromer component sorting nexin 1 (SNX1) to mediate an association between endosomes and microtubules. clasp-1 null mutants display aberrant SNX1 endosomes, as do wild-type plants treated with microtubule-depolymerizing drugs. Consistent with SNX1’s role in trafficking of the auxin efflux carrier PIN-FORMED2 (PIN2), clasp-1 mutant plants have enhanced PIN2 degradation, and PIN2 movement to lytic vacuoles is rapidly induced by depolymerization of microtubules. clasp-1 mutants display aberrant auxin distribution and exhibit numerous auxin-related phenotypes. In addition to mechanistically linking auxin transport and microtubules, our data identify a ubiquitous endosome-microtubule association in plants.

IGF-1 Activates a Cilium-Localized Noncanonical Gβγ Signaling Pathway that Regulates Cell-Cycle Progression,

Abstract: Summary
Primary cilia undergo cell-cycle-dependent assembly and disassembly. Emerging data suggest that ciliary resorption is a checkpoint for S phase reentry and that the activation of phospho(T94)Tctex-1 couples these two events. However, the environmental cues and molecular mechanisms that trigger these processes remain unknown. Here, we show that insulin-like growth-1 (IGF-1) accelerates G1-S progression by causing cilia to resorb. The mitogenic signals of IGF-1 are predominantly transduced through IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) on the cilia of fibroblasts and epithelial cells. At the base of the cilium, phosphorylated IGF-1R activates an AGS3-regulated Gβγ signaling pathway that subsequently recruits phospho(T94)Tctex-1 to the transition zone. Perturbing any component of this pathway in cortical progenitors induces premature neuronal differentiation at the expense of proliferation. These data suggest that during corticogenesis, a cilium-transduced, noncanonical IGF-1R-Gβγ-phospho(T94)Tctex-1 signaling pathway promotes the proliferation of neural progenitors through modulation of ciliary resorption and G1 length.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular stress results in profound changes in RNA and protein synthesis. How cells integrate this intrinsic, p53-centered program with extracellular signals is largely unknown. We demonstrate that TGF-β1 signaling interferes with the stress response through coordinate transcriptional and translational repression of p53 levels, which reduces p53-activated transcription, and apoptosis in precancerous cells. Mechanistically, E2F-4 binds constitutively to the TP53 gene and induces transcription. TGF-β1-activated Smads are recruited to a composite Smad/E2F-4 element by an E2F-4/p107 complex that switches to a Smad corepressor, which represses TP53 transcription. TGF-β1 also causes dissociation of ribosomal protein RPL26 and elongation factor eEF1A from p53 mRNA, thereby reducing p53 mRNA association with polyribosomes and p53 translation. TGF-β1 signaling is dominant over stress-induced transcription and translation of p53 and prevents stress-imposed downregulation of Smad proteins. Thus, crosstalk between the TGF-β and p53 pathways defines a major node of regulation in the cellular stress response, enhancing drug resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) and kinetochores perform distinct tasks, yet their shared ability to bind several proteins suggests their functions are intertwined. Among these shared proteins is Mad1p, a component of the yeast spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). Here we describe a role for Mad1p in regulating nuclear import that employs its ability to sense a disruption of kinetochore-microtubule interactions during mitosis. We show that kinetochore-microtubule detachment arrests nuclear import mediated by the transport factor Kap121p through a mechanism that requires Mad1p cycling between unattached, metaphase kinetochores and binding sites at the NPC. This signaling pathway requires the Aurora B-like kinase Ipl1p, and the resulting transport changes inhibit the nuclear import of Glc7p, a phosphatase that acts as an Ipl1p antagonist. We propose that a distinct branch of the SAC exists in which Mad1p senses unattached kinetochores and, by altering NPC transport activity, regulates the nuclear environment of the spindle.

Abstract: Summary
A dysfunctional bone marrow (BM) microenvironment is thought to contribute to the development of hematologic diseases. However, functional replacement of pathologic BM microenvironment through BM transplantation has not been possible. Furthermore, the study of hematopoietic inductive BM microenvironment is hampered by the lack of a functional nonhematopoietic reconstitution system. Here, we show that a deficiency of SH2-containing inositol-5′-phosphatase-1 (SHIP) in a nonhematopoietic host microenvironment enables its functional reconstitution by wild-type donor cells. This microenvironment reconstitution normalizes hematopoiesis in peripheral blood and BM and alleviates pathology of spleen and lung in the SHIP-deficient recipients. SHIP-deficient BM contains a significantly smaller population of multipotent stromal cells with distinct properties, which may contribute to the reconstitution by wild-type cells. We further demonstrate that it is the nonhematopoietic donor cells that are responsible for the reconstitution. Thus, we have established a nonhematopoietic BM microenvironment reconstitution system to functionally study specific cell types in hematopoietic niches.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding how smell or taste translates into behavior remains challenging. We have developed a behavioral paradigm in Drosophila larvae to investigate reception and processing of appetitive olfactory inputs in higher-order olfactory centers. We found that the brief presentation of appetitive odors caused fed larvae to display impulsive feeding of sugar-rich food. Deficiencies in the signaling of neuropeptide F (NPF), the fly counterpart of neuropeptide Y (NPY), blocked appetitive odor-induced feeding by disrupting dopamine (DA)-mediated higher-order olfactory processing. We have identified a small number of appetitive odor-responsive dopaminergic neurons (DL2) whose activation mimics the behavioral effect of appetitive odor stimulation. Both NPF and DL2 neurons project to the secondary olfactory processing center; NPF and its receptor NPFR1 mediate a gating mechanism for reception of olfactory inputs in DL2 neurons. Our findings suggest that eating for reward value is an ancient behavior and that fly larvae are useful for studying neurobiology and the evolution of olfactory reward-driven behavior.

Abstract: Summary
Superfamily ATPases in type IV pili, type 2 secretion, and archaella (formerly archaeal flagella) employ similar sequences for distinct biological processes. Here, we structurally and functionally characterize prototypical superfamily ATPase FlaI in Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, showing FlaI activities in archaeal swimming-organelle assembly and movement. X-ray scattering data of FlaI in solution and crystal structures with and without nucleotide reveal a hexameric crown assembly with key cross-subunit interactions. Rigid building blocks form between N-terminal domains (points) and neighboring subunit C-terminal domains (crown ring). Upon nucleotide binding, these six cross-subunit blocks move with respect to each other and distinctly from secretion and pilus ATPases. Crown interactions and conformations regulate assembly, motility, and force direction via a basic-clamp switching mechanism driving conformational changes between stable, backbone-interconnected moving blocks. Collective structural and mutational results identify in vivo functional components for assembly and motility, phosphate-triggered rearrangements by ATP hydrolysis, and molecular predictors for distinct ATPase superfamily functions.

Abstract: Occurrence of a solitary cilium was an unexpected discovery while studying the ultrastructure of epididymal epithelium in equidae. Primary cilia were detected in epididymal basal cells of all individuals of the equines studied – horses, donkey and mules – independently from age and tract of the duct, emerging from the basal cell surface and insinuating into the intercellular spaces. More rarely solitary cilia occurred also at the luminal surface of the principal cells. The ciliary apparatus was constituted by a structurally typical basal body continuous with the finger-like ciliary shaft extending from the cell surface, and an adjacent centriole oriented at right angles to the basal body. The cilium was structured as the typical primary, non-motile cilia found in many mammalian cells, having a 9+0 microtubular pattern. The basal diplosome was randomly associated with other cellular organelles including the Golgi complex, the endoplasmic reticulum, the microfilament network, the plasma membrane, vesicles and pits. Primary ciliogenesis is a new and unexpected finding in the epididymal epithelium. A monitoring role of luminal factors and extracellular liquids might be attributed to this organelle, likely acting as chemical receptor of the luminal environment, thus modulating the epithelial function by a cell-to-cell crosstalk involving the entire epithelium.

Abstract: Summary
Loss of chromosome end protection through telomere erosion is a hallmark of aging and senescence. Here we developed an experimental system that mimics physiological telomere deprotection in human cells and discovered that the telomere deprotection response is functionally distinct from the genomic DNA damage response. We found that, unlike genomic breaks, deprotected telomeres that are recognized as DNA damage but remain in the fusion-resistant intermediate state activate differential ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) signaling where CHK2 is not phosphorylated. Also unlike genomic breaks, we found that deprotected telomeres do not contribute to the G2/M checkpoint and are instead passed through cell division to induce p53-dependent G1 arrest in the daughter cells. Telomere deprotection is therefore an epigenetic signal passed between cell generations to ensure that replication-associated telomere-dependent growth arrest occurs in stable diploid G1 phase cells before genome instability can occur.

Abstract: Summary
Although Numb exhibits its tumor-suppressive function in breast cancer in part by binding to and stabilizing p53, it is unknown how the Numb-p53 interaction is regulated in cells. We found that Numb is methylated in its phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain by the lysine methyltransferase Set8. Moreover, methylation uncouples Numb from p53, resulting in increased p53 ubiquitination and degradation. While Numb promotes apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner, the apoptotic function is abolished when Numb is methylated by Set8 or the Lys methylation sites in Numb are mutated. Conversely, the Numb-p53 interaction and Numb-mediated apoptosis are significantly enhanced by depletion of Set8 from cancer cells or by treating the cells with doxorubicin, a chemotherapeutic drug that causes a reduction in the mRNA and protein levels of Set8. Our work identifies the Set8-Numb-p53 signaling axis as an important regulatory pathway for apoptosis and suggests a therapeutic strategy by targeting Numb methylation.

Abstract: Summary
The prevalence of intellectual disability is around 3%; however, the etiology of the disease remains unclear in most cases. We identified a series of patients with X-linked intellectual disability presenting mutations in the Rad6a (Ube2a) gene, which encodes for an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. Drosophila deficient for dRad6 display defective synaptic function as a consequence of mitochondrial failure. Similarly, mouse mRad6a (Ube2a) knockout and patient-derived hRad6a (Ube2a) mutant cells show defective mitochondria. Using in vitro and in vivo ubiquitination assays, we show that RAD6A acts as an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that, in combination with an E3 ubiquitin ligase such as Parkin, ubiquitinates mitochondrial proteins to facilitate the clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria in cells. Hence, we identify RAD6A as a regulator of Parkin-dependent mitophagy and establish a critical role for RAD6A in maintaining neuronal function.

Abstract: Summary
The genome of a cancer cell carries somatic mutations that are the cumulative consequences of the DNA damage and repair processes operative during the cellular lineage between the fertilized egg and the cancer cell. Remarkably, these mutational processes are poorly characterized. Global sequencing initiatives are yielding catalogs of somatic mutations from thousands of cancers, thus providing the unique opportunity to decipher the signatures of mutational processes operative in human cancer. However, until now there have been no theoretical models describing the signatures of mutational processes operative in cancer genomes and no systematic computational approaches are available to decipher these mutational signatures. Here, by modeling mutational processes as a blind source separation problem, we introduce a computational framework that effectively addresses these questions. Our approach provides a basis for characterizing mutational signatures from cancer-derived somatic mutational catalogs, paving the way to insights into the pathogenetic mechanism underlying all cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Accelerated glucose metabolism is a common feature of cancer cells. Hexokinases catalyze the first committed step of glucose metabolism. Hexokinase 2 (HK2) is expressed at high level in cancer cells, but only in a limited number of normal adult tissues. Using Hk2 conditional knockout mice, we showed that HK2 is required for tumor initiation and maintenance in mouse models of KRas-driven lung cancer, and ErbB2-driven breast cancer, despite continued HK1 expression. Similarly, HK2 ablation inhibits the neoplastic phenotype of human lung and breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Systemic Hk2 deletion is therapeutic in mice bearing lung tumors without adverse physiological consequences. Hk2 deletion in lung cancer cells suppressed glucose-derived ribonucleotides and impaired glutamine-derived carbon utilization in anaplerosis.

Abstract: The interaction between the dual roles of sugar as a metabolic fuel and a regulatory molecule was unveiled by examining the changes in sugar signaling upon oxygen deprivation, which causes the drastic alteration in the cellular energy status. In our study, the expression of anaerobically induced genes is commonly responsive to sugar, either under the control of hexokinase or non-hexokinase mediated signaling cascades. Only sugar regulation via the hexokinase pathway was susceptible for O2 deficiency or energy deficit conditions evoked by uncoupler. Examination of sugar regulation of those genes under anaerobic conditions revealed the presence of multiple paths underlying anaerobic induction of gene expression in rice, subgrouped into three distinct types. The first of these, which was found in type-1 genes, involved neither sugar regulation nor additional anaerobic induction under anoxia, indicating that anoxic induction is a simple result from the release of sugar repression by O2-deficient conditions. In contrast, type-2 genes also showed no sugar regulation, albeit with enhanced expression under anoxia. Lastly, expression of type-3 genes is highly enhanced with sugar regulation sustained under anoxia. Intriguingly, the inhibition of the mitochondrial ATP synthesis can reproduce expression pattern of a specific set of anaerobically induced genes, implying that rice cells may sense O2 deprivation, partly via perception of the perturbed cellular energy status. Our study of interaction between sugar signaling and anaerobic conditions has revealed that sugar signaling and the cellular energy status are likely to communicate with each other and influence anaerobic induction of gene expression in rice.

Abstract: Summary
c-Myc oncogenic activity is thought to be mediated in part by its ability to generate DNA replication stress and subsequent genomic instability when deregulated. Previous studies have demonstrated a nontranscriptional role for c-Myc in regulating DNA replication. Here, we analyze the mechanisms by which c-Myc deregulation generates DNA replication stress. We find that overexpression of c-Myc alters the spatiotemporal program of replication initiation by increasing the density of early-replicating origins. We further show that c-Myc deregulation results in elevated replication-fork stalling or collapse and subsequent DNA damage. Notably, these phenotypes are independent of RNA transcription. Finally, we demonstrate that overexpression of Cdc45 recapitulates all c-Myc-induced replication and damage phenotypes and that Cdc45 and GINS function downstream of Myc.

Abstract: Summary
The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase signal-transduction cascade is one of the key pathways regulating proliferation and differentiation in development and disease. ERK signaling is required for human embryonic stem cells’ (hESCs’) self-renewing property. Here, we studied the convergence of the ERK signaling cascade at the DNA by mapping genome-wide kinase-chromatin interactions for ERK2 in hESCs. We observed that ERK2 binding occurs near noncoding genes and histone, cell-cycle, metabolism, and pluripotency-associated genes. We find that the transcription factor ELK1 is essential in hESCs and that ERK2 co-occupies promoters bound by ELK1. Strikingly, promoters bound by ELK1 without ERK2 are occupied by Polycomb group proteins that repress genes involved in lineage commitment. In summary, we propose a model wherein extracellular-signaling-stimulated proliferation and intrinsic repression of differentiation are integrated to maintain the identity of hESCs.

Abstract: Mammalian spermatogenesis is a complex process involving an intrinsic genetic program of germ cell-specific and -predominant genes. In the present study, we analyzed the Ly-1 reactive clone (Lyar) gene in the mouse. Lyar, which is known to be expressed abundantly in the testis, encodes a nucleolar protein that contains a LYAR-type C2HC zinc finger motif and three nuclear localization signals. We herein confirmed that Lyar is expressed predominantly in the testis, and further showed that this expression is specific to germ cells. Protein analyses with an anti-LYAR antibody demonstrated that the LYAR protein is present in spermatocytes and spermatids, but not in sperm. To assess the functional role of LYAR in vivo, we used a genetrap mutagenesis approach to establish a LYAR-null mouse model. Lyar mutant mice were born live and developed normally. Male mutant mice lacking LYAR were fully fertile and showed intact spermatogenesis. Taken together, our results demonstrate that LYAR is strongly preferred in male germ cells, but has a dispensable role in spermatogenesis and fertility.

Abstract: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) produced by the oxidative burst in activated macrophages and neutrophils cause oxidative stress- implicated diseases. Quercetin is flavonoid that occurs naturally in plants and is widely used as a nutritional supplement due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, we investigated antioxidant activities and mechanisms of action in zymosan-induced macrophages of quercetin and quercetin-related flavonoids such as quercitrin, isoquercitrin, quercetin 3-O-β-(2"-galloyl)- rhamnopyranoside (QGR) and quercetin 3-O-β-(2"-galloyl)- glucopyranoside (QGG) as well as gallic acid, a building moiety of QGR and QGG. QGR and QGG exhibited stronger antioxidant activities compared with quercetin, whereas quercitrin, isoquercitrin and gallic acid exhibited weak-to- no antioxidant activities, assessed by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl- hydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging, superoxide production, superoxide scavenging, nitric oxide (NO) production, peroxynitrite (ONOO-) scavenging and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. Regarding mechanisms, the quercetin- containing flavonoids QGR and QGG differentially targeted compared with quercetin in the NF-κB signaling pathway that inhibited the DNA binding activity of the NF-κB complex without affecting the degradation and phosphorylation of kBa and NF-κB phosphorylation. In addition, QGR and QGG inhibited CRE and activator protein (AP-1) transcriptional activity and JNK phosphorylation by inhibiting the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) signaling in a different manner than quercetin. Our results showed that although QGR and QGG exhibited stronger antioxidant activities than querce-tin in macrophages, their mechanisms of action in terms of the NF-κB, PKA and PKC signaling pathways were different.

Abstract: Summary
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) is a transcription factor that regulates genes involved in fatty acid catabolism. Here, we provide evidence that PPARα is constitutively expressed in nuclei of hippocampal neurons and, surprisingly, controls calcium influx and the expression of various plasticity-related genes via direct transcriptional regulation of cyclic AMP response element binding (CREB). Accordingly, Pparα-null, but not Pparβ-null, mice are deficient in CREB and memory-associated proteins and have decreased spatial learning and memory. Small hairpin RNA knockdown of PPARα in the hippocampus suppressed CREB and NR2A, rendering wild-type animals markedly poor in consolidating spatial memory, whereas introduction of PPARα to the hippocampus of Pparα-null mice increased hippocampal CREB and NR2A and improved spatial learning and memory. Through detailed analyses of CREB and NR2A activity, as well as spatial learning and memory in bone marrow chimeric animals lacking PPARα in the CNS, we uncover a mechanism for transcriptional control of Creb and associated plasticity genes by PPARα.

Atrial Identity Is Determined by a COUP-TFII Regulatory Network,

Abstract: Summary
Atria and ventricles exhibit distinct molecular profiles that produce structural and functional differences between the two cardiac compartments. However, the factors that determine these differences remain largely undefined. Cardiomyocyte-specific COUP-TFII ablation produces ventricularized atria that exhibit ventricle-like action potentials, increased cardiomyocyte size, and development of extensive T tubules. Changes in atrial characteristics are accompanied by alterations of 2,584 genes, of which 81% were differentially expressed between atria and ventricles, suggesting that a major function of myocardial COUP-TFII is to determine atrial identity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays using E13.5 atria identified classic atrial-ventricular identity genes Tbx5, Hey2, Irx4, MLC2v, MLC2a, and MLC1a, among many other cardiac genes, as potential COUP-TFII direct targets. Collectively, our results reveal that COUP-TFII confers atrial identity through direct binding and by modulating expression of a broad spectrum of genes that have an impact on atrial development and function.

Abstract: Summary
In vitro, topographical and biophysical cues arising from the extracellular matrix (ECM) direct skeletal stem cell (SSC) commitment and differentiation. However, the mechanisms by which the SSC-ECM interface is regulated and the outcome of such interactions on stem cell fate in vivo remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that conditional deletion of the membrane-anchored metalloproteinase MT1-MMP (Mmp14) in mesenchymal progenitors, but not in committed osteoblasts, redirects SSC fate decisions from osteogenesis to adipo- and chondrogenesis. By effecting ECM remodeling, MT1-MMP regulates stem cell shape, thereby activating a β1-integrin/RhoGTPase signaling cascade and triggering the nuclear localization of the transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ, which serve to control SSC lineage commitment. These data identify a critical MT1-MMP/integrin/YAP/TAZ axis operative in the stem cell niche that oversees SSC fate determination.

Abstract: Summary
Craniofacial malformations are common structural birth defects and usually associate with abnormal development of pharyngeal arches. Although some microRNAs have been found to be implicated in chondrogenesis in vitro, few have been shown to be essential for cartilage and bone development at the whole organism level. In this study, we report that mir92a is highly enriched in the chondrogenic progenitors and that its inactivation results in loss of pharyngeal cartilage elements due to poor proliferation, impaired differentiation, and unsustainable survival of chondrogenic progenitors. The Bmp antagonist gene noggin3 (nog3) is a direct target of mir92a. Inactivation of mir92a stabilizes nog3 mRNA, leading to repression of Bmp signaling and abnormal behaviors of chondrogenic progenitors. In contrast, ectopic expression of mir92a duplex decreases nog3 mRNA levels and, as a result, derepresses Bmp signaling and promotes cell apoptosis. Therefore, mir92a acts to maintain Bmp activity during pharyngeal cartilage formation by targeting nog3.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies have mapped protein occupancies at many genomic loci. However, a detailed picture of the complexity of coregulators (CoRs) bound to a defined enhancer along with a transcription factor is missing. To address this, we used biotin-DNA pull-down assays coupled with mass spectrometry-immunoblotting to identify at least 17 CoRs from nuclear extracts bound to 17β-estradiol (E2)-liganded estrogen receptor-α on estrogen response elements (EREs). Unexpectedly, these complexes initially are biochemically stable and contain certain atypical corepressors. Addition of ATP dynamically converts these complexes to an “activated” state by phosphorylation events, primarily mediated by DNA-dependent protein kinase. Importantly, a “natural” ERE-containing enhancer and nucleosomal EREs recruit similar complexes. We further discovered the mechanism whereby H3K4me3 stimulates ERα-mediated transcription as compared with unmodified nucleosomes. H3K4me3 templates promote specific CoR dynamics in the presence of ATP and AcCoA, as manifested by CBP/p300 and SRC-3 dismissal and SAGA and TFIID stabilization/recruitment.

Abstract: Summary
EGFR and Hippo signaling pathways both control growth and, when dysregulated, contribute to tumorigenesis. We find that EGFR activates the Hippo pathway transcription factor Yorkie and demonstrate that Yorkie is required for the influence of EGFR on cell proliferation in Drosophila. EGFR regulates Yorkie through the influence of its Ras-MAPK branch on the Ajuba LIM protein Jub. Jub is epistatic to EGFR and Ras for Yorkie regulation, Jub is subject to MAPK-dependent phosphorylation, and EGFR-Ras-MAPK signaling enhances Jub binding to the Yorkie kinase Warts and the adaptor protein Salvador. An EGFR-Hippo pathway link is conserved in mammals, as activation of EGFR or RAS activates the Yorkie homolog YAP, and EGFR-RAS-MAPK signaling promotes phosphorylation of the Ajuba family protein WTIP and also enhances WTIP binding to the Warts and Salvador homologs LATS and WW45. Our observations implicate the Hippo pathway in EGFR-mediated tumorigenesis and identify a molecular link between these pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Genomic imprinting directs the allele-specific marking and expression of loci according to their parental origin. Differential DNA methylation at imprinted control regions (ICRs) is established in gametes and, although largely preserved through development, can be experimentally reset by fusing somatic cells with embryonic germ cell (EGC) lines. Here, we show that the Ten-Eleven Translocation proteins Tet1 and Tet2 participate in the efficient erasure of imprints in this model system. The fusion of B cells with EGCs initiates pluripotent reprogramming, in which rapid re-expression of Oct4 is accompanied by an accumulation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) at several ICRs. Tet2 was required for the efficient reprogramming capacity of EGCs, whereas Tet1 was necessary to induce 5-methylcytosine oxidation specifically at ICRs. These data show that the Tet1 and Tet2 proteins have discrete roles in cell-fusion-mediated pluripotent reprogramming and imprint erasure in somatic cells.

Abstract: Perlecan is a widely distributed, heparan sulphate proteoglycan with roles in the sequestration of FGFs, PDGF, VEGF through which it promotes cell proliferation and matrix production. Perlecan also stabilises extracellular matrices through interaction with a diverse range of matrix components. This study examined the distribution of perlecan in an ovine partial transection tendinopathy model. In normal tendon, perlecan was immunolocalised to small blood vessels in intrafascicular regions in the tendon-bone and muscle-tendon attachments and to linear arrays of oval shaped tenocytes in the tendon mid-region. Partial transection in the mid-tendon region significantly increased perlecan accumulation within the fascicles, in granulation tissue filling the transection site and in the tendon-bone and tendon-muscle attachments. The accumulation of perlecan in the transected tendon and its known roles in matrix stabilisation and cell proliferation indicate possible roles in tendon remodelling and repair. Perlecan domain-1 has been used as a growth factor delivery vehicle for FGF-2, BMP-2 and BMP-7 in regenerative medicine but has yet to be evaluated in infraspinatus tendon repair. A better understanding of perlecan's contributions to pathobiological processes in remodelling tendon may be useful in such regenerative strategies in the future.

Abstract: Summary
Circulating levels of insulin and glucagon reflect the nutritional state of animals and elicit regulatory responses in the liver that maintain glucose and lipid homeostasis. The transcription factor Foxa2 activates lipid metabolism and ketogenesis during fasting and is inhibited via insulin-PI3K-Akt signaling-mediated phosphorylation at Thr156 and nuclear exclusion. Here we show that, in addition, Foxa2 is acetylated at the conserved residue Lys259 following inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs) class I–III and the cofactors p300 and SirT1 are involved in Foxa2 acetylation and deacetylation, respectively. Physiologically, fasting states and glucagon stimulation are sufficient to induce Foxa2 acetylation. Introduction of the acetylation-mimicking (K259Q) or -deficient (K259R) mutations promotes or inhibits Foxa2 activity, respectively, and adenoviral expression of Foxa2-K259Q augments expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis. Our study reveals a molecular mechanism by which glucagon signaling activates a fasting response through acetylation of Foxa2.

Abstract: Summary
ALIX plays a role in nucleocapsid release during viral infection, as does lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA). However, the mechanism remains unclear. Here we report that LBPA is recognized within an exposed site in ALIX Bro1 domain predicted by MODA, an algorithm for discovering membrane-docking areas in proteins. LBPA interactions revealed a strict requirement for a structural calcium tightly bound near the lipid interaction site. Unlike other calcium– and phospholipid-binding proteins, the all-helical triangle-shaped fold of the Bro1 domain confers selectivity for LBPA via a pair of hydrophobic residues in a flexible loop, which undergoes a conformational change upon membrane association. Both LBPA and calcium binding are necessary for endosome association and virus infection, as are ALIX ESCRT binding and dimerization capacity. We conclude that LBPA recruits ALIX onto late endosomes via the calcium-bound Bro1 domain, triggering a conformational change in ALIX to mediate the delivery of viral nucleocapsids to the cytosol during infection.

Abstract: Summary
Upon stimulation by pathogen-associated inflammatory signals, TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) induces type I interferon expression and modulates nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling. Here, we describe the 2.4 Å-resolution crystal structure of nearly full-length TBK1 in complex with specific inhibitors. The structure reveals a dimeric assembly created by an extensive network of interactions among the kinase, ubiquitin-like, and scaffold/dimerization domains. An intact TBK1 dimer undergoes K63-linked polyubiquitination on lysines 30 and 401, and these modifications are required for TBK1 activity. The ubiquitination sites and dimer contacts are conserved in the close homolog inhibitor of κB kinase ε (IKKε) but not in IKKβ, a canonical IKK that assembles in an unrelated manner. The multidomain architecture of TBK1 provides a structural platform for integrating ubiquitination with kinase activation and IRF3 phosphorylation. The structure of TBK1 will facilitate studies of the atypical IKKs in normal and disease physiology and further the development of more specific inhibitors that may be useful as anticancer or anti-inflammatory agents.

Abstract: Summary
The classical model of hematopoiesis predicts a dichotomous lineage restriction of multipotent hematopoietic progenitors (MPPs) into common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) and common myeloid progenitors (CMPs). However, this idea has been challenged by the identification of lymphoid progenitors retaining partial myeloid potential (e.g., LMPPs), implying that granulocytes can arise within both the classical lymphoid and the myeloid branches. Here, we resolve this issue by using cell-surface CD133 expression to discriminate functional progenitor populations. We show that eosinophilic and basophilic granulocytes as well as erythrocytes and megakaryocytes derive from a common erythro-myeloid progenitor (EMP), whereas neutrophilic granulocytes arise independently within a lympho-myeloid branch with long-term progenitor function. These findings challenge the concept of a CMP and restore dichotomy to the classical hematopoietic model.

Abstract: Summary
Calorie restriction (CR) extends life span in diverse species. Mitochondria play a key role in CR adaptation; however, the molecular details remain elusive. We developed and applied a quantitative mass spectrometry method to probe the liver mitochondrial acetyl-proteome during CR versus control diet in mice that were wild-type or lacked the protein deacetylase SIRT3. Quantification of 3,285 acetylation sites—2,193 from mitochondrial proteins—rendered a comprehensive atlas of the acetyl-proteome and enabled global site-specific, relative acetyl occupancy measurements between all four experimental conditions. Bioinformatic and biochemical analyses provided additional support for the effects of specific acetylation on mitochondrial protein function. Our results (1) reveal widespread reprogramming of mitochondrial protein acetylation in response to CR and SIRT3, (2) identify three biochemically distinct classes of acetylation sites, and (3) provide evidence that SIRT3 is a prominent regulator in CR adaptation by coordinately deacetylating proteins involved in diverse pathways of metabolism and mitochondrial maintenance.

Abstract: Summary
The ability of cells to respond to changes in nutrient availability is critical for an adequate control of metabolic homeostasis. Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a central complex kinase in these processes. The signaling adaptor p62 binds raptor, and integral component of the mTORC1 pathway. p62 interacts with TNF receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and is required for mTORC1 translocation to the lysosome and its subsequent activation. Here we show that TRAF6 is recruited to and activates mTORC1 through p62 in amino acid-stimulated cells. We also show that TRAF6 is necessary for the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosomes and that the TRAF6-catalyzed K63 ubiquitination of mTOR regulates mTORC1 activation by amino acids. TRAF6, through its interaction with p62 and activation of mTORC1, modulates autophagy and is an important mediator in cancer cell proliferation. Interfering with the p62-TRAF6 interaction serves to modulate autophagy and nutrient sensing.

Abstract: Summary
Fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs) are not growth factors, but instead bind to voltage-gated Na+ channels (NaV) and regulate their function. Mutations in FGF14, an FHF that is the locus for spinocerebellar ataxia 27 (SCA27), are believed to be pathogenic because of a dominant-negative reduction of NaV currents in cerebellar granule cells. Here, we demonstrate that FGF14 also regulates members of the presynaptic CaV2 Ca2+ channel family. Knockdown of FGF14 in granule cells reduced Ca2+ currents and diminished vesicular recycling, a marker for presynaptic Ca2+ influx. As a consequence, excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) at the granule cell to Purkinje cell synapse were markedly diminished. Expression of the SCA27-causing FGF14 mutant in granule cells exerted a dominant-negative reduction in Ca2+ currents, vesicular recycling, and the resultant EPSCs in Purkinje cells. Thus, FHFs are multimodal, regulating several discrete neuronal signaling events. SCA27 most likely results at least in part from dysregulation of Ca2+ channel function.

Abstract: Summary
Fgf8 encodes a key signaling factor, and its precise regulation is essential for embryo patterning. Here, we identified the regulatory modules that control Fgf8 expression during mammalian embryogenesis. These enhancers are interspersed with unrelated genes along a large region of 220 kb; yet they act on Fgf8 only. Intriguingly, this region also contains additional genuine enhancer activities that are not transformed into gene expression. Using genomic engineering strategies, we showed that these multiple and distinct regulatory modules act as a coherent unit and influence genes depending on their position rather than on their promoter sequence. These findings highlight how the structure of a locus regulates the autonomous intrinsic activities of the regulatory elements it contains and contributes to their tissue and target specificities. We discuss the implications of such regulatory systems regarding the evolution of gene expression and the impact of human genomic structural variations.

Abstract: The sperm structure of the enigmatic mecopteran species Caurinus dectes (Boreidae) is described for the first time. Diagnostic features are the bi-layered acrosome, a cylindric nucleus provided with two longitudinal opposite grooves, and a simple 9+2 axoneme which degenerates in the posterior tail end. The results are conform with the monophyly of Mecoptera including Boreidae. A possible autapomorphy of the order is the presence of the two longitudinal opposite grooves along the nucleus, and the presence of two electron-dense fibres beneath the axoneme. Some apparently plesiomorphic features are preserved in the sperm of Caurinus. Features characterizing the distal part of the flagellum, including the presence of an axial cylindrical structure and the distinctive type of axoneme degeneration, are potential synapomorphies of Caurinus and Boreus, i.e. autapomorphic traits of Boreidae.

Abstract: Summary
A new influenza-like virus genome (H17N10) was recently discovered in bats and offers a new perspective about the origin and evolution of influenza viruses. The viral envelope glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) is responsible for influenza virus receptor binding, fusion, and entry into the cell; therefore, the structure and function of HA H17 was characterized. The 2.70 Å resolution crystal structure revealed that H17 has a typical influenza A virus HA fold, but with some special features, including a distorted putative sialic acid (SA) binding site and low thermostability. No binding to either the canonical human α2,6 SA-linkage or avian α2,3 SA-linkage receptor was observed. Furthermore, H17 glycan binding was not detected using a chip covering more than 600 glycans. Our results demonstrate that H17 is unique among characterized HAs and that the bat-derived influenza virus may use a different entry mechanism compared to canonical influenza viruses.

Abstract: Summary
The prostate tumor suppressor NKX3.1 augments response to DNA damage and enhances survival after DNA damage. Within minutes of DNA damage, NKX3.1 undergoes phosphorylation at tyrosine 222, which is required for a functional interaction with ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase. NKX3.1 binds to the N-terminal region of ATM, accelerates ATM activation, and hastens the formation of γhistone2AX. NKX3.1 enhances DNA-dependent ATM kinase activation by both the MRN complex and H2O2 in a DNA-damage-independent manner. ATM, bound to the NKX3.1 homeodomain, phosphorylates NKX3.1, leading to ubiquitination and degradation. Thus, NKX3.1 and ATM have a functional interaction leading to ATM activation and then NKX3.1 degradation in a tightly regulated DNA damage response specific to prostate epithelial cells. These findings demonstrate a mechanism for the tumor-suppressor properties of NKX3.1, demonstrate how NKX3.1 may enhance DNA integrity in prostate stem cells and may help to explain how cells differ in their sensitivity to DNA damage.

Abstract: De novo zinc single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (Zn-SAD) phasing has been demonstrated with the 1.9 Å resolution data of glucose isomerase and 2.6 Å resolution data of Staphylococcus aureus Fur (SaFur) collected using in-house Cu Kα X-ray source. The successful in-house ZnSAD phasing of glucose isomerase, based on the anomalous signals of both zinc ions introduced to crystals by soaking and native sulfur atoms, drove us to determine the structure of SaFur, a zinc-containing transcription factor, by Zn-SAD phasing using in-house X-ray source. The abundance of zinc-containing proteins in nature, the easy zinc derivatization of the protein surface, no need of synchrotron access, and the successful experimental phasing with the modest 2.6 Å resolution SAD data indicate that inhouse Zn-SAD phasing can be widely applicable to structure determination.

Abstract: CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), a multivalent zinc-finger protein, is involved in different aspects of regulation including promoter activation or repression, gene silencing, chromatin insulation, gene imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, cell growth or differentiation and tumor genesis. However, the molecular mechanisms of CTCF nuclear import remains unclear. In this study, we showed that the expression of CTCF influenced the intracellular distribution of itself, which might go through transport receptor - import 13 (IPO13). We further confirmed that there is a CTCF target site in ipo13 -774~-573 bp promoter region and CTCF regulates the expression of IPO13. Besides, GST pull-down and Co-IP experiments demonstrated that CTCF interacts with IPO13. Immunofluorescence staining showed that IPO13 influenced intracellular distribution of CTCF. In all, we conclude that CTCF regulates the expression of IPO13, which, in turn, mediates the nuclear import of CTCF.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanisms underlying cell-type-specific response to morphogens or signaling molecules during embryonic development are poorly understood. To learn how response to the liver-inductive Wnt2bb signal is achieved, we identify an endoderm-enriched, single transmembrane protein, epithelial-cell-adhesion-molecule (EpCAM), as an endoderm-specific Wnt derepressor in zebrafish. hi2151/epcam mutants exhibit defective liver development similar to prt/wnt2bb mutants. EpCAM directly binds to Kremen1 and disrupts the Kremen1-Dickkopf2 (Dkk2) interaction, which prevents Kremen1-Dkk2-mediated removal of Lipoprotein-receptor-related protein 6 (Lrp6) from the cell surface. These data lead to a model in which EpCAM derepresses Lrp6 and cooperates with Wnt ligand to activate Wnt signaling through stabilizing membrane Lrp6 and allowing Lrp6 clustering into active signalosomes. Thus, EpCAM cell autonomously licenses and cooperatively activates Wnt2bb signaling in endodermal cells. Our results identify EpCAM as the key molecule and its functional mechanism to confer endodermal cells the competence to respond to the liver-inductive Wnt2bb signal.

Abstract: The S100s are a large group of Ca2+ sensors found exclusively in vertebrates. Transcriptomic and genomic data from the major radiations of mammals were used to derive the evolution of the mammalian S100s genes. In human and mouse, S100s and S100 fused-type proteins are in a separate clade from other Ca2+ sensor proteins, indicating that an ancient bifurcation between these two gene lineages has occurred. Furthermore, the five genomic loci containing S100 genes have remained largely intact during the past 165 million years since the shared ancestor of egg-laying and placental mammals. Nonetheless, interesting births and deaths of S100 genes have occurred during mammalian evolution. The S100A7 loci exhibited the most plasticity and phylogenetic analyses clarified relationships between the S100A7 proteins encoded in the various mammalian genomes. Phylogenetic analyses also identified four conserved subgroups of S100s that predate the rise of warm-blooded vertebrates: A2/A3/A4/A5/A6, A1/A10/A11/B/P/Z, A13/A14/A16, and A7s/A8/A9/A12/G. The similarity between genomic location and phylogenetic clades suggest that these subfamilies arose by a series of tandem gene duplication events. Examination of annotated S100s in lower vertebrates suggests that the ancestral S100 was a member of the A1/A10/A11/B/P/Z subgroup and arose near the emergence of vertebrates approximately 500 million years ago.

Abstract: Summary
Classic “position-effect” experiments repositioned genes near telomeres to demonstrate that the epigenetic landscape can dramatically alter gene expression. Here, we show that systematic gene knockout collections provide an exceptional resource for interrogating position effects, not only near telomeres but at every genetic locus. Because a single reporter gene replaces each deleted gene, interrogating this reporter provides a sensitive probe into different chromatin environments while controlling for genetic context. Using this approach, we find that, whereas systematic replacement of yeast genes with the kanMX marker does not perturb the chromatin landscape, chromatin differences associated with gene position account for 35% of kanMX activity. We observe distinct chromatin influences, including a Set2/Rpd3-mediated antagonistic interaction between histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylation and the Rap1 transcriptional activation site in kanMX. This interaction explains why some yeast genes have been resistant to deletion and allows successful generation of these deletion strains through the use of a modified transformation procedure. These findings demonstrate that chromatin regulation is not governed by a uniform “histone code” but by specific interactions between chromatin and genetic factors.

Abstract: Summary
The basal (ligand-independent) kinase activity of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) promotes trans-phosphorylation on activation loop tyrosines upon ligand-induced receptor dimerization, thus upregulating intrinsic kinase activity and triggering intracellular signaling. To understand the molecular determinants of intrinsic kinase activity, we used X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy to analyze pathogenic FGF receptor mutants with gradations in gain-of-function activity. These structural analyses revealed a “two-state” dynamic equilibrium model whereby the kinase toggles between an “inhibited,” structurally rigid ground state and a more dynamic and heterogeneous active state. The pathogenic mutations have different abilities to shift this equilibrium toward the active state. The increase in the fractional population of FGF receptors in the active state correlates with the degree of gain-of-function activity and clinical severity. Our data demonstrate that the fractional population of RTKs in the active state determines intrinsic kinase activity and underscore how a slight increase in the active population of kinases can have grave consequences for human health.

Abstract: Summary
Evidence suggests the bactericidal activity of mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species (mROS) directly contributes to killing phagocytozed bacteria. Infection-responsive components that regulate this process remain incompletely understood. We describe a role for the mitochondria-localizing enzyme encoded by Immunoresponsive gene 1 (IRG1) during the utilization of fatty acids as a fuel for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and associated mROS production. In a zebrafish infection model, infection-responsive expression of zebrafish irg1 is specific to macrophage-lineage cells and is regulated cooperatively by glucocorticoid and JAK/STAT signaling pathways. Irg1-depleted macrophage-lineage cells are impaired in their ability to utilize fatty acids as an energy substrate for OXPHOS-derived mROS production resulting in defective bactericidal activity. Additionally, the requirement for fatty acid β-oxidation during infection-responsive mROS production and bactericidal activity toward intracellular bacteria is conserved in murine macrophages. These results reveal IRG1 as a key component of the immunometabolism axis, connecting infection, cellular metabolism, and macrophage effector function.

Abstract: Thioacetamide (TAA) has been used in development of animal models of acute hepatic encephalopathy (AHE). This experimental study was designed to evaluate effects of oral administration of vitamin C, vitamin E and their combination on liver and brain enzymes and their histologic and ultrastructure changes. Eighty Wistar rats were included and divided into five groups (16 each). Group 1 (control) received saline once intraperitoneally (IP) then administered orally saline and corn oil for 3 days. Group 2 [hepatotoxic (TAA)] were received TAA (300mg/kg) once intraperitoneally (IP). Group 3 (vitamin C and TAA) received TAA (300mg/kg) once intraperitoneally (IP) and then administered orally vitamin C (100mg/kg) daily for 3 days. Group 4 (vitamin E and TAA) received TAA (300mg/kg) once intraperitoneally (IP) and then administered orally vitamin E (200mg/kg) daily for 3 days. Group 5 (vitamin C and vitamin E and TAA) received TAA (300mg/kg) once intraperitoneally (IP) and then administered orally vitamin C (100mg/kg) in combination with vitamin E (200mg/kg) daily for 3 days. All rats were sacrificed 24h after last treatment under anesthesia. Blood samples were collected and serum was obtained for analysis of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), total protein, triglyceride, cholesterol using spectrophotometer and ELISA kits. Liver and brain were extracted and tissue homogenate was used to measure malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH) and nitric oxide (NO). Histological and ultrastructure examination were done. TAA induced significant increase of MDA and decreased in GSH and NO in both liver and brain homogenate with more liver affection, and increased in serum levels of AST, ALT, triglyceride, cholesterol and decreased in total protein. Furthermore, there is decrease in serum levels of AST, ALT, triglyceride, cholesterol and tissue levels of MDA and elevated serum total protein and tissue GSH and NO under the umbrella of vitamin C and vitamin E and their combination, although vitamin E is more efficient. These data showed protective effect of vitamins C and E, especially vitamin E against oxidative stress and hepatic and brain damage, and histological architecture of the liver in rats’ model of acute hepatic encephalopathy elicited by TAA.

Abstract: Summary
Homeologous recombination between divergent DNA sequences is inhibited by DNA mismatch repair. In Escherichia coli, MutS and MutL respond to DNA mismatches within recombination intermediates and prevent strand exchange via an unknown mechanism. Here, using purified proteins and DNA substrates, we find that in addition to mismatches within the heteroduplex region, secondary structures within the displaced single-stranded DNA formed during branch migration within the recombination intermediate are involved in the inhibition. We present a model that explains how higher-order complex formation of MutS, MutL, and DNA blocks branch migration by preventing rotation of the DNA strands within the recombination intermediate. Furthermore, we find that the helicase UvrD is recruited to directionally resolve these trapped intermediates toward DNA substrates. Thus, our results explain on a mechanistic level how the coordinated action between MutS, MutL, and UvrD prevents homeologous recombination and maintains genome stability.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved membrane trafficking process. Induction of autophagy in response to nutrient limitation or cellular stress occurs by similar mechanisms in organisms from yeast to mammals. Unlike yeast, metazoan cells rely more on growth factor signaling for a wide variety of cellular activities including nutrient uptake. How growth factor availability regulates autophagy is poorly understood. Here we show that, upon growth factor limitation, the p110β catalytic subunit of the class IA phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) dissociates from growth factor receptor complexes and increases its interaction with the small GTPase Rab5. This p110β-Rab5 association maintains Rab5 in its guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound state and enhances the Rab5-Vps34 interaction that promotes autophagy. p110β mutants that fail to interact with Rab5 are defective in autophagy promotion. Hence, in mammalian cells, p110β acts as a molecular sensor for growth factor availability and induces autophagy by activating a Rab5-mediated signaling cascade.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) carries a dismal prognosis and lacks a human cell model of early disease progression. When human PDAC cells are injected into immunodeficient mice, they generate advanced-stage cancer. We hypothesized that if human PDAC cells were converted to pluripotency and then allowed to differentiate back into pancreatic tissue, they might undergo early stages of cancer. Although most induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines were not of the expected cancer genotype, one PDAC line, 10–22 cells, when injected into immunodeficient mice, generated pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) precursors to PDAC that progressed to the invasive stage. The PanIN-like cells secrete or release proteins from many genes that are known to be expressed in human pancreatic cancer progression and that predicted an HNF4α network in intermediate-stage lesions. Thus, rare events allow iPSC technology to provide a live human cell model of early pancreatic cancer and insights into disease progression.

Abstract: Summary
Glial progenitor cells (GPCs) are a potential source of malignant gliomas. We used A2B5-based sorting to extract tumorigenic GPCs from human gliomas spanning World Health Organization grades II–IV. Messenger RNA profiling identified a cohort of genes that distinguished A2B5+ glioma tumor progenitor cells (TPCs) from A2B5+ GPCs isolated from normal white matter. A core set of genes and pathways was substantially dysregulated in A2B5+ TPCs, which included the transcription factor SIX1 and its principal cofactors, EYA1 and DACH2. Small hairpin RNAi silencing of SIX1 inhibited the expansion of glioma TPCs in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a critical and unrecognized role of the SIX1-EYA1-DACH2 system in glioma genesis or progression. By comparing the expression patterns of glioma TPCs with those of normal GPCs, we have identified a discrete set of pathways by which glial tumorigenesis may be better understood and more specifically targeted.

Abstract: As the molecular composition of calcium-release activated calcium (CRAC) channels has been unknown for two decades, elucidation of selective inhibitors has been considerably hampered. By the identification of the two key components of CRAC channels, STIM1 and Orai1 have emerged as promising targets for CRAC blockers. The aim of this study was to thoroughly characterize the effects of two selective CRAC channel blockers on currents derived from STIM1/Orai heterologoulsy expressed in HEK293 cells. The novel compounds GSK-7975A and GSK-5503A were tested for effects on STIM1 mediated Orai1 or Orai3 currents by whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and for the effects on STIM1 oligomerisation or STIM1/Orai coupling by FRET microscopy. To investigate their site of action, inhibitory effects of these molecules were explored using Orai pore mutants. The GSK blockers inhibited Orai1 and Orai3 currents with an IC50 of approximately 4μM and exhibited a substantially slower rate of onset than the typical pore blocker La3+, together with almost no current recovery upon wash-out over 4min. For the less Ca2+-selective Orai1 E106D pore mutant, ICRAC inhibition was significantly reduced. FRET experiments indicated that neither STIM1–STIM1 oligomerization nor STIM1–Orai1 coupling was affected by these compounds. These CRAC channel blockers are acting downstream of STIM1 oligomerization and STIM1/Orai1 interaction, potentially via an allosteric effect on the selectivity filter of Orai. The elucidation of these CRAC current blockers represents a significant step toward the identification of CRAC channel-selective drug compounds.

Abstract: Summary
Iron regulatory proteins (Irps) 1 and 2 posttranscriptionally control the expression of transcripts that contain iron-responsive element (IRE) sequences, including ferritin, ferroportin, transferrin receptor, and hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF2α). We report here that mice with targeted deletion of Irp1 developed pulmonary hypertension and polycythemia that was exacerbated by a low-iron diet. Hematocrits increased to 65% in iron-starved mice, and many polycythemic mice died of abdominal hemorrhages. Irp1 deletion enhanced HIF2α protein expression in kidneys of Irp1−/− mice, which led to increased erythropoietin (EPO) expression, polycythemia, and concomitant tissue iron deficiency. Increased HIF2α expression in pulmonary endothelial cells induced high expression of endothelin-1, likely contributing to the pulmonary hypertension of Irp1−/− mice. Our results reveal why anemia is an early physiological consequence of iron deficiency, highlight the physiological significance of Irp1 in regulating erythropoiesis and iron distribution, and provide important insights into the molecular pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension.

Abstract: Summary
Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) have evolved as a focal point for linking lipid synthesis with other pathways that regulate cell growth and survival. Here, we have uncovered a polycistrionic microRNA (miRNA) locus that is activated directly by SREBP-2. Two of the encoded miRNAs, miR-182 and miR-96, negatively regulate the expression of Fbxw7 and Insig-2, respectively, and both are known to negatively affect nuclear SREBP accumulation. Direct manipulation of this miRNA pathway alters nuclear SREBP levels and endogenous lipid synthesis. Thus, we have uncovered a mechanism for the regulation of intracellular lipid metabolism mediated by the concerted action of a pair of miRNAs that are expressed from the same SREBP-2-regulated miRNA locus, and each targets a different protein of the multistep pathway that regulates SREBP function. These studies reveal an miRNA “operon” analogous to the classic model for genetic control in bacterial regulatory systems.

Abstract: Summary
Inhibitors of Apoptosis Protein (IAPs) are guardian ubiquitin ligases that keep classic proapoptotic proteins in check. Systematic identification of additional IAP substrates is challenged by the heterogeneity and sheer number of ubiquitinated proteins (>5,000). Here we report a powerful catalytic tagging tool, the NEDDylator, which fuses a NEDD8 E2-conjugating enzyme, Ubc12, to the ubiquitin ligase, XIAP or cIAP1. This permits transfer of the rare ubiquitin homolog NEDD8 to the ubiquitin E3 substrates, allowing them to be efficiently purified for LC-MS/MS identification. We have identified >50 potential IAP substrates of both cytosolic and mitochondrial origin that bear hallmark N-terminal IAP binding motifs. These substrates include the recently discovered protein phosphatase PGAM5, which we show is proteolytically processed, accumulates in cytosol during apoptosis, and sensitizes cells to death. These studies reveal mechanisms and antagonistic partners for specific IAPs, and provide a powerful technology for labeling binding partners in transient protein-protein complexes.

Abstract: Summary
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play complex roles in aging, having both damaging effects and signaling functions. Transiently elevating mitochondrial stress, including mitochondrial ROS (mtROS), elicits beneficial responses that extend lifespan. However, these adaptive, longevity-signaling pathways remain poorly understood. We show here that Tel1p and Rad53p, homologs of the mammalian DNA damage response kinases ATM and Chk2, mediate a hormetic mtROS longevity signal that extends yeast chronological lifespan. This pathway senses mtROS in a manner distinct from the nuclear DNA damage response and ultimately imparts longevity by inactivating the histone demethylase Rph1p specifically at subtelomeric heterochromatin, enhancing binding of the silencing protein Sir3p, and repressing subtelomeric transcription. These results demonstrate the existence of conserved mitochondria-to-nucleus stress-signaling pathways that regulate aging through epigenetic modulation of nuclear gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic switches are critical components of developmental circuits. Because temperate bacteriophages are vastly abundant and greatly diverse, they are rich resources for understanding the mechanisms and evolution of switches and the molecular control of genetic circuitry. Here, we describe a new class of small, compact, and simple switches that use site-specific recombination as the key decision point. The phage attachment site attP is located within the phage repressor gene such that chromosomal integration results in removal of a C-terminal tag that destabilizes the virally encoded form of the repressor. Integration thus not only confers prophage stability but also is a requirement for lysogenic establishment. The variety of these self-contained integration-dependent immunity systems in different genomic contexts suggests that these represent ancestral states in switch evolution from which more-complex switches have evolved. They also provide a powerful toolkit for building synthetic biological circuits.

Abstract: Summary
Gene expression profiling has uncovered the transcription factor Sox4 with upregulated activity during TGF-β-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in normal and cancerous breast epithelial cells. Sox4 is indispensable for EMT and cell survival in vitro and for primary tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Among several EMT-relevant genes, Sox4 directly regulates the expression of Ezh2, encoding the Polycomb group histone methyltransferase that trimethylates histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) for gene repression. Ablation of Ezh2 expression prevents EMT, whereas forced expression of Ezh2 restores EMT in Sox4-deficient cells. Ezh2-mediated H3K27me3 marks associate with key EMT genes, representing an epigenetic EMT signature that predicts patient survival. Our results identify Sox4 as a master regulator of EMT by governing the expression of the epigenetic modifier Ezh2.

Direct Binding of SAS-6 to ZYG-1 Recruits SAS-6 to the Mother Centriole for Cartwheel Assembly,

Abstract: Summary
Assembly of SAS-6 dimers to form the centriolar cartwheel requires the ZYG-1/Plk4 kinase. Here, we show that ZYG-1 recruits SAS-6 to the mother centriole independently of its kinase activity; kinase activity is subsequently required for cartwheel assembly. We identify a direct interaction between ZYG-1 and the SAS-6 coiled coil that explains its kinase activity-independent function in SAS-6 recruitment. Perturbing this interaction, or the interaction between an adjacent segment of the SAS-6 coiled coil and SAS-5, prevented SAS-6 recruitment and cartwheel assembly. SAS-6 mutants with alanine substitutions in a previously described ZYG-1 target site or in 37 other residues, either phosphorylated by ZYG-1 in vitro or conserved in closely related nematodes, all supported cartwheel assembly. We propose that ZYG-1 binding to the SAS-6 coiled coil recruits the SAS-6-SAS-5 complex to the mother centriole, where a ZYG-1 kinase activity-dependent step, whose target is unlikely to be SAS-6, triggers cartwheel assembly.

Abstract: Summary
Fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis is induced in response to feeding and insulin. This lipogenic induction involves coordinate transcriptional activation of lipogenic enzymes, including fatty acid synthase and glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase. We recently reported the importance of USF-1 phosphorylation and subsequent acetylation in insulin-induced lipogenic gene activation. Here, we show that Brg1/Brm-associated factor (BAF) 60c is a specific chromatin remodeling component for lipogenic gene transcription in liver. In response to insulin, BAF60c is phosphorylated at S247 by atypical PKCζ/λ, which causes translocation of BAF60c to the nucleus and allows a direct interaction of BAF60c with USF-1 that is phosphorylated by DNA-PK and acetylated by P/CAF. Thus, BAF60c is recruited to form the lipoBAF complex to remodel chromatin structure and to activate lipogenic genes. Consequently, BAF60c promotes lipogenesis in vivo and increases triglyceride levels, demonstrating its role in metabolic adaption to activate the lipogenic program in response to feeding and insulin.

Abstract: Anuran external gills were assessed for motility and striated muscle content in 16 species from seven families. Motility of three kinds was observed. Pulsatory movements related to heart beat rhythm were common. In embryos developing to a late stage before hatching, movements of the whole embryo were frequent, with gills rearranging as a consequence. The only clearly active movement, presumably muscle driven, was ‘gill flicking’, a posterior movement of the entire gill into the body either on one side only, or both together, followed by a return to the normal spread-out position. Some species may actively spread their gills when hanging from the water surface film, but we did not observe this. In some species, active gill movement developed over time, but we were not able to follow all species over such a developmental sequence. The relationship between active motility and muscle content was good in most cases. Observations on late stage embryos of the aromobatid Mannophryne trinitatis are presented for the first time. In one species, we noted spread external gills being used to adhere hatchlings to a surface.

Abstract: Summary
In long-lived C. elegans insulin/IGF-1 pathway mutants, the life-extending FOXO transcription factor DAF-16 is present throughout the animal, but we find that its activity in a single tissue can delay the aging of other tissues and extend the animal’s life span. To better understand the topography of DAF-16 action among the tissues, we analyzed a collection of DAF-16-regulated genes. DAF-16 regulated most of these genes in a cell-autonomous fashion, often using tissue-specific GATA factors to direct their expression to specific tissues. DAF-16 could also act cell nonautonomously to influence gene expression. DAF-16 affected gene expression in other cells, at least in part, via the lipid-gene regulator MDT-15. DAF-16, and probably MDT-15, could act cell nonautonomously in the endoderm to ameliorate the paralysis caused by expressing Alzheimer’s Aβ protein in muscles. These findings suggest that MDT-15-dependent intercellular signals, possibly lipid signals, can help to coordinate tissue physiology, enhance proteostasis, and extend life in response to DAF-16/FOXO activity.

Abstract: Summary
Glutamine is an essential nutrient for cancer cell survival and proliferation, yet the signaling pathways that sense glutamine levels remain uncharacterized. Here, we report that the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)-associated protein, α4, plays a conserved role in glutamine sensing. α4 promotes assembly of an adaptive PP2A complex containing the B55α regulatory subunit via providing the catalytic subunit upon glutamine deprivation. Moreover, B55α is specifically induced upon glutamine deprivation in a ROS-dependent manner to activate p53 and promote cell survival. B55α activates p53 through direct interaction and dephosphorylation of EDD, a negative regulator of p53. Importantly, the B55α-EDD-p53 pathway is essential for cancer cell survival and tumor growth under low glutamine conditions in vitro and in vivo. This study delineates a previously unidentified signaling pathway that senses glutamine levels as well as provides important evidence that protein phosphatase complexes are actively involved in signal transduction.

Abstract: Summary
Vegf signaling specifies arterial fate during early vascular development by inducing the transcription of Delta-like 4 (Dll4), the earliest Notch ligand gene expressed in arterial precursor cells. Dll4 expression precedes that of Notch receptors in arteries, and factors that direct its arterial-specific expression are not known. To identify the transcriptional program that initiates arterial Dll4 expression, we characterized an arterial-specific and Vegf-responsive enhancer of Dll4. Our findings demonstrate that Notch signaling is not required for initiation of Dll4 expression in arteries and suggest that Notch instead functions as a maintenance factor. Importantly, we find that Vegf signaling activates MAP kinase (MAPK)-dependent E26 transformation-specific sequence (ETS) factors in the arterial endothelium to drive expression of Dll4 and Notch4. These findings identify a Vegf/MAPK-dependent transcriptional pathway that specifies arterial identity by activating Notch signaling components and illustrate how signaling cascades can modulate broadly expressed transcription factors to achieve tissue-specific transcriptional outputs.

Abstract: Summary
KRIT1 (Krev/Rap1 Interaction Trapped-1) mutations are observed in ∼40% of autosomal-dominant cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs), a disease occurring in up to 0.5% of the population. We show that KRIT1 functions as a switch for β1 integrin activation by antagonizing ICAP1 (Integrin Cytoplasmic Associated Protein-1)-mediated modulation of “inside-out” activation. We present cocrystal structures of KRIT1 with ICAP1 and ICAP1 with integrin β1 cytoplasmic tail to 2.54 and 3.0 Å resolution (the resolutions at which I/σI = 2 are 2.75 and 3.0 Å, respectively). We find that KRIT1 binds ICAP1 by a bidentate surface, that KRIT1 directly competes with integrin β1 to bind ICAP1, and that KRIT1 antagonizes ICAP1-modulated integrin activation using this site. We also find that KRIT1 contains an N-terminal Nudix domain, in a region previously designated as unstructured. We therefore provide insights to integrin regulation and CCM-associated KRIT1 function.

Abstract: Mammalian eggs undergo a prolonged series of low frequency Ca2+ oscillations at fertilization. These Ca2+ oscillations are the immediate cause of egg activation. The Ca2+ oscillations in mouse eggs have been shown to be driven by increased InsP3 production. Substantial evidence now indicates that a sperm-derived phospholipase C-zeta (PLCζ) is the key molecule that causes these Ca2+ oscillations at fertilization. The fertilizing sperm is envisaged to introduce this essential molecule into the egg following gamete fusion. This review summarizes our current knowledge of how sperm PLCζ causes these oscillations and why it is so much more effective at triggering InsP3 production and Ca2+ oscillations in eggs, than other somatic isoforms of PLC. The molecular features of PLCζ and how they relate to the pattern of Ca2+ oscillations seen at fertilization are considered. We also discuss the evidence that PLCζ does not hydrolyze the conventional source of PI(4,5)P2 in the plasma membrane to make InsP3, but instead uses a distinct pool of PI(4,5)P2 present on intracellular vesicles. This leads us to suggest that sperm PLCζ may be targeted to these cytoplasmic vesicles by directly interacting with a specific but as yet unidentified egg PLCζ-binding protein.

Abstract: Summary
RNA-protein (RNP) interactions generally are required for RNA function. At least 5% of human genes code for RNA-binding proteins. Whereas many approaches can identify the RNA partners for a specific protein, finding the protein partners for a specific RNA is difficult. We present a machine-learning method that scores a protein’s binding potential for an RNA structure by utilizing the chemical context profiles of the interface from known RNP structures. Our approach is applicable even when only a single RNP structure is available. We examined 801 mammalian proteins and find that 37 (4.6%) potentially bind transfer RNA (tRNA). Most are enzymes involved in cellular processes unrelated to translation and were not known to interact with RNA. We experimentally tested six positive and three negative predictions for tRNA binding in vivo, and all nine predictions were correct. Our computational approach provides a powerful complement to experiments in discovering new RNPs.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity is a highly heritable disease driven by complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Human genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a number of loci contributing to obesity; however, a major limitation of these studies is the inability to assess environmental interactions common to obesity. Using a systems genetics approach, we measured obesity traits, global gene expression, and gut microbiota composition in response to a high-fat/high-sucrose (HF/HS) diet of more than 100 inbred strains of mice. Here we show that HF/HS feeding promotes robust, strain-specific changes in obesity that are not accounted for by food intake and provide evidence for a genetically determined set point for obesity. GWAS analysis identified 11 genome-wide significant loci associated with obesity traits, several of which overlap with loci identified in human studies. We also show strong relationships between genotype and gut microbiota plasticity during HF/HS feeding and identify gut microbial phylotypes associated with obesity.

Abstract: Summary
Cell fate is governed by combinatorial actions of transcriptional regulators assembling into multiprotein complexes. However, the molecular details of how these complexes form are poorly understood. One such complex, which contains the basic-helix-loop-helix heterodimer SCL:E47 and bridging proteins LMO2:LDB1, critically regulates hematopoiesis and induces T cell leukemia. Here, we report the crystal structure of (SCL:E47)bHLH:LMO2:LDB1LID bound to DNA, providing a molecular account of the network of interactions assembling this complex. This reveals an unexpected role for LMO2. Upon binding to SCL, LMO2 induces new hydrogen bonds in SCL:E47, thereby strengthening heterodimer formation. This imposes a rotation movement onto E47 that weakens the heterodimer:DNA interaction, shifting the main DNA-binding activity onto additional protein partners. Along with biochemical analyses, this illustrates, at an atomic level, how hematopoietic-specific SCL sequesters ubiquitous E47 and associated cofactors and supports SCL’s reported DNA-binding-independent functions. Importantly, this work will drive the design of small molecules inhibiting leukemogenic processes.

Abstract: Summary
The “CTCF code” hypothesis posits that CTCF pleiotropic functions are driven by recognition of diverse sequences through combinatorial use of its 11 zinc fingers (ZFs). This model, however, is supported by in vitro binding studies of a limited number of sequences. To study CTCF multivalency in vivo, we define ZF binding requirements at ∼50,000 genomic sites in primary lymphocytes. We find that CTCF reads sequence diversity through ZF clustering. ZFs 4–7 anchor CTCF to ∼80% of targets containing the core motif. Nonconserved flanking sequences are recognized by ZFs 1–2 and ZFs 8–11 clusters, which also stabilize CTCF broadly. Alternatively, ZFs 9–11 associate with a second phylogenetically conserved upstream motif at ∼15% of its sites. Individually, ZFs increase overall binding and chromatin residence time. Unexpectedly, we also uncovered a conserved downstream DNA motif that destabilizes CTCF occupancy. Thus, CTCF associates with a wide array of DNA modules via combinatorial clustering of its 11 ZFs.

Abstract: The cell cycle plays an important role in the development and adaptation of multicellular organisms; specifically, it allows them to optimally adjust their architecture in response to environmental changes. Kip-related proteins (KRPs) are important negative regulators of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which positively control the cell cycle during plant development. The Arabidopsis genome possesses seven KRP genes with low sequence similarity and distinct expression patterns; however, why Arabidopsis needs seven KRP genes and how these genes function in cell cycle regulation are unknown. Here, we focused on the characterization of KRP3, which was found to have unique functions in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) and leaves. KRP3 protein was localized to the SAM, including the ground meristem and vascular tissues in the ground part of the SAM and cotyledons. In addition, KRP3 protein was stabilized when treated with MG132, an inhibitor of the 26S proteasome, indicating that the protein may be regulated by 26S proteasome-mediated protein degradation. KRP3-overexpressing (KRP3 OE) transgenic plants showed reduced organ size, serrated leaves, and reduced fertility. Interestingly, the KRP3 OE transgenic plants showed a significant reduction in the size of the SAM with alterations in cell arrangement. In addition, compared to the wild type, the KRP3 OE transgenic plants had a higher DNA ploidy level in the SAM and leaves. Taken together, our data suggest that KRP3 plays important regulatory roles in the cell cycle and endoreduplication in the SAM and leaves.

Abstract: Summary
ATP competitive inhibitors of the BRAFV600E oncogene paradoxically activate downstream signaling in cells bearing wild-type BRAF (BRAFWT). In this study, we investigate the biochemical mechanism of wild-type RAF (RAFWT) activation by multiple catalytic inhibitors using kinetic analysis of purified BRAFV600E and RAFWT enzymes. We show that activation of RAFWT is ATP dependent and directly linked to RAF kinase activity. These data support a mechanism involving inhibitory autophosphorylation of RAF’s phosphate-binding loop that, when disrupted either through pharmacologic or genetic alterations, results in activation of RAF and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. This mechanism accounts not only for compound-mediated activation of the MAPK pathway in BRAFWT cells but also offers a biochemical mechanism for BRAF oncogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Timely and accurate assembly of the mitotic spindle is critical for the faithful segregation of chromosomes, and centrosome separation is a key step in this process. The timing of centrosome separation varies dramatically between cell types; however, the mechanisms responsible for these differences and its significance are unclear. Here, we show that activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling determines the timing of centrosome separation. Premature separation of centrosomes decreases the requirement for the major mitotic kinesin Eg5 for spindle assembly, accelerates mitosis, and decreases the rate of chromosome missegregation. Importantly, EGF stimulation impacts upon centrosome separation and mitotic progression to different degrees in different cell lines. Cells with high EGFR levels fail to arrest in mitosis upon Eg5 inhibition. This has important implications for cancer therapy because cells with high centrosomal response to EGF are more susceptible to combinatorial inhibition of EGFR and Eg5.

Abstract: Summary
How adhesive contacts with neighbors may affect epithelial cell cytokinesis is unknown. We report that in Drosophila, septins are specifically required for planar (but not orthogonal) cytokinesis. During planar division, cytokinetic furrowing initiates basally, resulting in a contractile ring displaced toward the adherens junction (AJ). The formation of new AJ between daughter cells requires the disengagement of E-Cadherin complexes between mitotic and neighboring cells at the cleavage furrow, followed by the assembly of E-Cadherin complexes on the daughter-daughter interface. The strength of adhesion with neighbors directly impacts both the kinetics of AJ disengagement and the length of the new AJ. Loss of septins causes a reduction in the contractility of the actomyosin ring and prevents local disengagement of AJ in the cleavage furrow. By modulating the strength of tension induced by neighbors, we uncover a mechanical function for septins to overcome the extrinsic tension induced by neighboring interphasic cells.

Abstract: The present investigation report the effect of a bradykinin-potentiating factor (BPF) on gentamicin-induced oxidative stress in rat liver and kidney. BPF is a peptide fraction isolated from the venom of the Egyptian scorpion (Buthus occitanus) has been demonstrated to have antioxidant, free radical scavenger and anti-inflammatory effects. Thirty male Rattus norvegicus (130–150g) were included and divided into three equal groups as follows: Group I (control), group II was (ip) injected with gentamicin alone (80mg/kg/day) for 15days, group III was given (ip) injection of BPF (1mg/kg/day) one hour prior to gentamicin treatment for 15days with the same dose of gentamicin as group II. Both organs were subjected to histopathological analysis with the light microscope. The activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), asparate aminotransferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in serum were measured as indicators of the liver function. As parameters of the kidney function, creatinine, uric acid and urea concentrations were determined. Also, malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), super oxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were determined in both tissues. Gentamicin caused a significant decrease or inhibition in the activities of GSH, SOD, and CAT, with significant increase in the level of MDA, ALT, AST, ALP, as well as creatinine, uric acid and urea concentrations in versus to control groups in both liver and kidney. Co-administration of gentamicin and BPF significantly increased the activity of GSH, SOD, and CAT, with significant decrease in the level of MDA and maintained serum (ALT); (AST); (ALP), creatinine, uric acid and urea concentrations as the same level as control group. Moreover, administration of gentamicin resulted in damage to liver and kidney structures. Administration of BPF before gentamicin exposure prevented severe alterations of biochemical parameters and disruptions of liver and kidney structures. In conclusion, this study obviously demonstrated that pretreatment with BPF significantly attenuated the physiological and histopathological alterations induced by gentamicin. Also, the present study identifies new areas of research for development of better therapeutic agents for liver, kidney, and other organs dysfunctions and diseases.

Abstract: Summary
A fundamental question in developmental biology is whether there are mechanisms to detect stem cells with mutations that, although not adversely affecting viability, would compromise their ability to contribute to further development. Here, we show that cell competition is a mechanism regulating the fitness of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We find that ESCs displaying defective bone morphogenetic protein signaling or defective autophagy or that are tetraploid are eliminated at the onset of differentiation by wild-type cells. This elimination occurs in an apoptosis-dependent manner and is mediated by secreted factors. Furthermore, during this process, we find that establishment of differential c-Myc levels is critical and that c-Myc overexpression is sufficient to induce competitive behavior in ESCs. Cell competition is, therefore, a process that allows recognition and elimination of defective cells during the early stages of development and is likely to play important roles in tissue homeostasis and stem cell maintenance.

Abstract: Summary
Posttranslational modifications play central roles in myriad biological pathways including circadian regulation. We employed a circadian proteomic approach to demonstrate that circadian timing of phosphorylation is a critical factor in regulating complex GSK3β-dependent pathways and identified O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) as a substrate of GSK3β. Interestingly, OGT activity is regulated by GSK3β; hence, OGT and GSK3β exhibit reciprocal regulation. Modulating O-GlcNAcylation levels alter circadian period length in both mice and Drosophila; conversely, protein O-GlcNAcylation is circadianly regulated. Central clock proteins, Clock and Period, are reversibly modified by O-GlcNAcylation to regulate their transcriptional activities. In addition, O-GlcNAcylation of a region in PER2 known to regulate human sleep phase (S662–S674) competes with phosphorylation of this region, and this interplay is at least partly mediated by glucose levels. Together, these results indicate that O-GlcNAcylation serves as a metabolic sensor for clock regulation and works coordinately with phosphorylation to fine-tune circadian clock.
