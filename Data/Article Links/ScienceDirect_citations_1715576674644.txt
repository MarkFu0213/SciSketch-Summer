Abstract: Summary
Lactic acid has emerged as an important modulator of immune cell function. It can be produced by both gut microbiota and the host metabolism at homeostasis and during disease states. The production of lactic acid in the gut microenvironment is vital for tissue homeostasis. In the present study, we examined how lactic acid integrates cellular metabolism to shape the epigenome of macrophages during pro-inflammatory response. We found that lactic acid serves as a primary fuel source to promote histone H3K27 acetylation, which allows the expression of immunosuppressive gene program including Nr4a1. Consequently, macrophage pro-inflammatory function was transcriptionally repressed. Furthermore, the histone acetylation induced by lactic acid promotes a form of long-term immunosuppression (“trained immunosuppression”). Pre-exposure to lactic acid induces lipopolysaccharide tolerance. These findings thus indicate that lactic acid sensing and its effect on chromatin remodeling in macrophages represent a key homeostatic mechanism that can provide a tolerogenic tissue microenvironment.

Abstract: The discovery of the Spemann-Mangold organizer strongly influenced subsequent research on embryonic induction, with research aiming to elucidate the molecular characteristics of organizer activity being currently underway. Herein, we review the history of research on embryonic induction, and describe how the mechanisms of induction phenomena and developmental processes have been investigated. Classical experiments investigating the differentiation capacity and inductive activity of various embryonic regions were conducted by many researchers, and important theories of region-specific induction and the concept for chain of induction were proposed. The transition from experimental embryology to developmental biology has enabled us to understand the mechanisms of embryonic induction at the molecular level. Consequently, many inducing substances and molecules such as transcriptional factors and peptide growth factors involved in the organizer formation were identified. One of peptide growth factors, activin, acts as a mesoderm- and endoderm-inducing substance. Activin induces several tissues and organs from the undifferentiated cell mass of amphibian embryos in a concentration-dependent manner. We review the extent to which we can control in vitro organogenesis from undifferentiated cells, and discuss the application to stem cell-based regenerative medicine based on insights gained from animal experiments, such as in amphibians.

Abstract: Summary
Viral pandemics and epidemics pose a significant global threat. While macaque models of viral disease are routinely used, it remains unclear how conserved antiviral responses are between macaques and humans. Therefore, we conducted a cross-species analysis of transcriptomic data from over 6,088 blood samples from macaques and humans infected with one of 31 viruses. Our findings demonstrate that irrespective of primate or viral species, there are conserved antiviral responses that are consistent across infection phase (acute, chronic, or latent) and viral genome type (DNA or RNA viruses). Leveraging longitudinal data from experimental challenges, we identify virus-specific response kinetics such as host responses to Coronaviridae and Orthomyxoviridae infections peaking 1–3 days earlier than responses to Filoviridae and Arenaviridae viral infections. Our results underscore macaque studies as a powerful tool for understanding viral pathogenesis and immune responses that translate to humans, with implications for viral therapeutic development and pandemic preparedness.

Abstract: Summary
Despite recent advances in single-cell genomics, the lack of maps for single-cell candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) in non-mammal species has limited our exploration of conserved regulatory programs across vertebrates and invertebrates. Here, we developed a combinatorial-hybridization-based method for single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) named CH-ATAC-seq, enabling the construction of single-cell accessible chromatin landscapes for zebrafish, Drosophila, and earthworms (Eisenia andrei). By integrating scATAC censuses of humans, monkeys, and mice, we systematically identified 152 distinct main cell types and around 0.8 million cell-type-specific cCREs. Our analysis provided insights into the conservation of neural, muscle, and immune lineages across species, while epithelial cells exhibited a higher organ-origin heterogeneity. Additionally, a large-scale gene regulatory network (GRN) was constructed in four vertebrates by integrating scRNA-seq censuses. Overall, our study provides a valuable resource for comparative epigenomics, identifying the evolutionary conservation and divergence of gene regulation across different species.

Abstract: Summary
Severe forms of malaria are associated with systemic inflammation and host metabolism disorders; however, the interplay between these outcomes is poorly understood. Using a Plasmodium chabaudi model of malaria, we demonstrate that interferon (IFN) γ boosts glycolysis in splenic monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MODCs), leading to itaconate accumulation and disruption in the TCA cycle. Increased itaconate levels reduce mitochondrial functionality, which associates with organellar nucleic acid release and MODC restraint. We hypothesize that dysfunctional mitochondria release degraded DNA into the cytosol. Once mitochondrial DNA is sensitized, the activation of IRF3 and IRF7 promotes the expression of IFN-stimulated genes and checkpoint markers. Indeed, depletion of the STING-IRF3/IRF7 axis reduces PD-L1 expression, enabling activation of CD8+ T cells that control parasite proliferation. In summary, mitochondrial disruption caused by itaconate in MODCs leads to a suppressive effect in CD8+ T cells, which enhances parasitemia. We provide evidence that ACOD1 and itaconate are potential targets for adjunct antimalarial therapy.

Abstract: Summary
We investigate the bacterial and fungal composition and functionality of the Ju|’hoansi intestinal microbiome (IM). The Juǀʼhoansi are a hunter-gatherer community residing in northeastern Namibia. They formerly subsisted by hunting and gathering but have been increasingly exposed to industrial dietary sources, medicines, and lifestyle features. They present an opportunity to study the evolution of the human IM in situ, from a predominantly hunter-gatherer to an increasingly Western urban-forager-farmer lifestyle. Their bacterial IM resembles that of typical hunter-gatherers, being enriched for genera such as Prevotella, Blautia, Faecalibacterium, Succinivibrio, and Treponema. Fungal IM inhabitants include animal pathogens and plant saprotrophs such as Fusarium, Issatchenkia, and Panellus. Our results suggest that diet and culture exert a greater influence on Ju|’hoansi IM composition than age, self-identified biological sex, and medical history. The Ju|’hoansi exhibit a unique core IM composition that diverges from the core IMs of other populations.

Abstract: Lactate serves not merely as an energy substrate for skeletal muscle but also regulates myogenic differentiation, leading to an elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. The present study was focused on exploring the effects of lactate and ROS/p38 MAPK in promoting C2C12 myoblasts differentiation. Our results demonstrated that lactate increased C2C12 myoblasts differentiation at a range of physiological concentrations, accompanied by enhanced ROS contents. We used n-acetylcysteine (NAC, a ROS scavenger) pretreatment and found that it delayed lactate-induced C2C12 myoblast differentiation by upregulating Myf5 expression on days 5 and 7 and lowering MyoD and MyoG expression. The finding implies that lactate accompanies ROS-dependent manner to promote C2C12 myoblast differentiation. Additionally, lactate significantly increased p38 MAPK phosphorylation to promote C2C12 cell differentiation, but pretreatment with SB203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor) reduced lactate-induced C2C12 myoblasts differentiation. whereas lactate pretreatment with NAC inhibited p38 MAPK phosphorylation in C2C12 cells, demonstrating that lactate mediated ROS and regulated the p38 MAPK signalling pathway to promote C2C12 cell differentiation. In conclusion, our results suggest that the promotion of C2C12 myoblasts differentiation by lactate is dependent on ROS and the p38 MAPK signalling pathway. These observations reveal a beneficial role for lactate in increasing myogenesis through ROS-sensitive mechanisms as well as providing new ideas regarding the positive impact of ROS in improving the function of skeletal muscle.

Abstract: Summary
Immunomodulatory effects of long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) and their activating enzyme, acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase long-chain family (ACSL), in the tumor microenvironment remain largely unknown. Here, we find that ACSL5 functions as an immune-dependent tumor suppressor. ACSL5 expression sensitizes tumors to PD-1 blockade therapy in vivo and the cytotoxicity mediated by CD8+ T cells in vitro via regulation of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I)-mediated antigen presentation. Through screening potential substrates for ACSL5, we further identify that elaidic acid (EA), a trans LCFA that has long been considered harmful to human health, phenocopies to enhance MHC-I expression. EA supplementation can suppress tumor growth and sensitize PD-1 blockade therapy. Clinically, ACSL5 expression is positively associated with improved survival in patients with lung cancer, and plasma EA level is also predictive for immunotherapy efficiency. Our findings provide a foundation for enhancing immunotherapy through either targeting ACSL5 or metabolic reprogramming of antigen presentation via dietary EA supplementation.

Abstract: Summary
The structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) protein complexes—cohesin, condensin, and the Smc5/6 complex (Smc5/6)—are essential for chromosome function. At the molecular level, these complexes fold DNA by loop extrusion. Accordingly, cohesin creates chromosome loops in interphase, and condensin compacts mitotic chromosomes. However, the role of Smc5/6’s recently discovered DNA loop extrusion activity is unknown. Here, we uncover that Smc5/6 associates with transcription-induced positively supercoiled DNA at cohesin-dependent loop boundaries on budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) chromosomes. Mechanistically, single-molecule imaging reveals that dimers of Smc5/6 specifically recognize the tip of positively supercoiled DNA plectonemes and efficiently initiate loop extrusion to gather the supercoiled DNA into a large plectonemic loop. Finally, Hi-C analysis shows that Smc5/6 links chromosomal regions containing transcription-induced positive supercoiling in cis. Altogether, our findings indicate that Smc5/6 controls the three-dimensional organization of chromosomes by recognizing and initiating loop extrusion on positively supercoiled DNA.

Abstract: Summary
Lysine acetylation is a dynamic post-translational modification of proteins. Extensive studies have revealed that the acetylation modulated by histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs) plays a crucial role in regulating protein function. However, there has been limited focus on how HDACs regulate jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis in plants. Here, we uncover that the protein stability of OsLOX14, a critical enzyme involved in JA biosynthesis, is regulated by a histone deacetylase, OsHDA706, and is hindered by a viral protein. Our results show that OsHDA706 deacetylates OsLOX14 and enhances the stability of OsLOX14, leading to JA accumulation and an improved broad-spectrum rice antiviral defense. Furthermore, we found that the viral protein P2, encoded by the destructive rice stripe virus, disrupts the association of OsHDA706-OsLOX14, promoting viral infection. Overall, our findings reveal how HDAC manipulates the interplay of deacetylation and protein stability of a JA biosynthetic enzyme to enhance plant antiviral responses.

Abstract: Summary
Attenuated inflammatory response is a property of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Moreover, whether the attenuated inflammatory status is involved in ESC differentiation is also unknown. Here, we found that autophagy-related protein ATG5 is essential for both attenuated inflammatory response and differentiation of mouse ESCs and that attenuation of inflammatory signaling is required for mouse ESC differentiation. Mechanistically, ATG5 recruits FBXW7 to promote ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation of β-TrCP1, resulting in the inhibition of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling and inflammatory response. Moreover, differentiation defects observed in ATG5-depleted mouse ESCs are due to β-TrCP1 accumulation and hyperactivation of NF-κB signaling, as loss of β-TrCP1 and inhibition of NF-κB signaling rescued the differentiation defects. Therefore, this study reveals a previously uncharacterized mechanism maintaining the attenuated inflammatory response in mouse ESCs and further expands the understanding of the biological roles of ATG5.

Abstract: In skeletal muscle (SM), inward Ca2+-currents have no apparent role in excitation-contraction coupling (e-c coupling), however the Ca2+-channel blocker can affect twitch and tetanic muscle in mammalian SM. Experiments were conducted to study how diltiazem (DLZ) facilitates e-c coupling and inhibits contraction. 1) In complete Extensor Digitorum Longus (EDL) muscle and single intact fibres, 0.03 mM DLZ causes twitch potentiation and decreases force during tetanic activity, with increased fatigue. 2) In split open fibres isolated from EDL fibres, DLZ inhibits sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+-loading in a dose-dependent manner and has a potentiating effect on caffeine-induced SR Ca2+-release. 3) In isolated light SR (LSR) vesicles, SERCA1 hydrolytic activity is not affected by DLZ up to 0.2 mM. However, ATP-dependent Ca2+-uptake was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner at a concentration where e-c coupling is changed. 4) The passive Ca2+-efflux from LSR was reduced by half with 0.03 mM diltiazem, indicating that SR leaking does not account for the decreased Ca2+-uptake. 5) The denaturation profile of the SERCA Ca2+-binding domain has lower thermal stability in the presence of DLZ in a concentration-dependent manner, having no effect on the nucleotide-binding domain. We conclude that the effect of DLZ on SM is exerted by crossing the sarcolemma and interacting directly with the SERCA Ca2+-binding domain, affecting SR Ca2+-loading during relaxation, which has a consequence on SM contractility. Diltiazem effect on SM could be utilized as a tool to understand SM e-c coupling and muscle fatigue.

Abstract: The Greek tortoise, inhabiting harsh desert environments, provides a compelling case for investigating skin adaptations to extreme conditions. We have utilized light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and immunofluorescence analysis to describe the structure of the arid-adapted limb skin in the Greek tortoise. Our aim was to identify the cell types that reflect the skin adaptation of this tortoise to arid conditions. Utilizing seven antibodies, we localized and elucidated the functions of various skin cells, shedding light on how the tortoise adapts to adverse environmental conditions. Our findings unveiled numerous scales on the limbs, varying in size and color, acting as protective armor against abrasions, bites, and other potential threats in their rocky habitats. The epidermis comprises four layers: stratum basalis, stratum spinosum, peri-corneous layer, and stratum corneum. Cytokeratin 14 (CK14) was explicitly detected in the basal layer of the epidermis, suggesting a role in maintaining epidermal integrity and cellular function. Langerhans cells were observed between epidermal cells filled with ribosomes and Birbeck granules. Numerous dendritic-shaped Langerhans cells revealed through E-Cadherin signify strong immunity in tortoises' skin. Melanophores were identified using the Melan-A antibody, labeling the cytoplasm, and the SOX10 antibody, labeling the nucleus, providing comprehensive insights into melanophores morphology and distribution. Two types of melanophores were found: dendritic below the stratum basalis of the epidermis and clustered oval melanophores in the deep dermal layer. Varied melanophores distribution resulted in a spotted skin pattern, potentially offering adaptive camouflage and protection against environmental challenges. Numerous myofibroblasts were discerned through alpha-smooth actin (α-SMA) expression, indicating that the Greek tortoise's skin possesses a robust tissue repair and remodeling capacity. B-cell lymphocytes detected via CD20 immunostaining exhibited sporadic distribution in the dermis, concentrating in lymphoid aggregates and around vessels, implying potential roles in local immune responses and inflammation modulation. Employing Tom20 to identify skin cells with abundant mitochondria revealed a notable presence in melanophores and the basal layer of the epidermis, suggesting high metabolic activity in these cell types and potentially influencing cellular functions. These findings contribute to our comprehension of tortoise skin anatomy and physiology, offering insights into the remarkable adaptations of this species finely tuned to their specific environmental habitats.

Abstract: Summary
Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) studies of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have demonstrated the roles of rare promoter de novo variants (DNVs). However, most promoter DNVs in ASD are not located immediately upstream of known ASD genes. In this study analyzing WGS data of 5,044 ASD probands, 4,095 unaffected siblings, and their parents, we show that promoter DNVs within topologically associating domains (TADs) containing ASD genes are significantly and specifically associated with ASD. An analysis considering TADs as functional units identified specific TADs enriched for promoter DNVs in ASD and indicated that common variants in these regions also confer ASD heritability. Experimental validation using human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) showed that likely deleterious promoter DNVs in ASD can influence multiple genes within the same TAD, resulting in overall dysregulation of ASD-associated genes. These results highlight the importance of TADs and gene-regulatory mechanisms in better understanding the genetic architecture of ASD.

Abstract: Background
Peiminine (PMI) is an active alkaloid sourced from Fritillaria thunbergii, which has been shown to suppress the development of a variety of tumors. Whereas, the roles and precise mechanism of PMI in breast cancer (BC) development remain not been clarified.
Methods
The cytotoxic effect of PMI on MCF-10A and BC cell lines (MCF-7 and BT-549) were assessed by MTT and LDH release assay. Cell proliferation was evaluated by EdU staining. Levels of Malondialdehyde (MDA), reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathione (GSH) activity and iron assay were measured by Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits, respectively. Transmission Electron Microscope was performed to observe mitochondrial morphological structure. Immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and western blot were conducted to examine protein levels, respectively. Xenograft model was used to confirm cellular findings.
Results
PMI treatment reduced the viability and enhanced LDH level of MCF-7 and BT-549 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, and further suppressed cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Subsequently, PMI administration resulted in significant increases of ROS, MDA and iron levels, reduction of GSH activity as well as mitochondrial shrinkage and GPX4 reduction, while all these phenomena could be rescued by ferrostatin-1. Mechanistically, PMI treatment led to promoted Nrf2 expression and its nuclear translocation, as well as it’s downstream protein HO-1 and NQO1 expressions. Notably, ML-385, a Nrf2 specific inhibitor, greatly reversed the anti-tumor effects and pro-ferroptosis role of PMI in BC cells.
Conclusion
Taking these finding together, PMI could stimulate ferroptosis to inhibit BC tumor growth by activating Nrf2-HO-1 signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) catalyzes the final step of triglyceride (TG) synthesis. DGAT2 deletion in mice lowers liver TGs, and DGAT2 inhibitors are under investigation for the treatment of fatty liver disease. Here, we show that DGAT2 inhibition also suppressed SREBP-1 cleavage, reduced fatty acid synthesis, and lowered TG accumulation and secretion from liver. DGAT2 inhibition increased phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) levels in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and inhibited SREBP-1 cleavage, while DGAT2 overexpression lowered ER PE concentrations and increased SREBP-1 cleavage in vivo. ER enrichment with PE blocked SREBP-1 cleavage independent of Insigs, which are ER proteins that normally retain SREBPs in the ER. Thus, inhibition of DGAT2 shunted diacylglycerol into phospholipid synthesis, increasing the PE content of the ER, resulting in reduced SREBP-1 cleavage and less hepatic steatosis. This study reveals a new mechanism that regulates SREBP-1 activation and lipogenesis that is independent of sterols and SREBP-2 in liver.

Abstract: Summary
SUCNR1 is an auto- and paracrine sensor of the metabolic stress signal succinate. Using unsupervised molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (170.400 ns) and mutagenesis across human, mouse, and rat SUCNR1, we characterize how a five-arginine motif around the extracellular pole of TM-VI determines the initial capture of succinate in the extracellular vestibule (ECV) to either stay or move down to the orthosteric site. Metadynamics demonstrate low-energy succinate binding in both sites, with an energy barrier corresponding to an intermediate stage during which succinate, with an associated water cluster, unlocks the hydrogen-bond-stabilized conformationally constrained extracellular loop (ECL)-2b. Importantly, simultaneous binding of two succinate molecules through either a “sequential” or “bypassing” mode is a frequent endpoint. The mono-carboxylate NF-56-EJ40 antagonist enters SUCNR1 between TM-I and -II and does not unlock ECL-2b. It is proposed that occupancy of both high-affinity sites is required for selective activation of SUCNR1 by high local succinate concentrations.

Abstract: Summary
The spontaneous migration of bone marrow neutrophils (BMNs) is typically induced by distant tumor cells during the early stage of the tumor and critically controls tumor progression and metastases. Therefore, identifying the key molecule that prevents this process is extremely important for suppressing tumors. Interleukin-37 (IL-37) can suppress pro-inflammatory cytokine generation via an IL-1R8- or Smad3-mediated pathway. Here, we demonstrate that human neutrophil IL-37 is responsively reduced by tumor cells and the recombinant IL-37 isoform d (IL-37d) significantly inhibits spontaneous BMN migration and tumor lesion formation in the lung by negatively modulating CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBPβ) in a Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC)-inducing lung cancer mouse model. Mechanistically, IL-37d promotes C/EBPβ ubiquitination degradation by facilitating ubiquitin ligase COP1 recruitment and disrupts C/EBPβ DNA binding abilities, thereby reducing neutrophil ATP generation and migration. Our work reveals an anti-tumor mechanism for IL-37 via destabilization of C/EBPβ to prevent spontaneous BMN migration and tumor progression.

Abstract: Summary
How mechanical allodynia following nerve injury is encoded in patterns of neural activity in the spinal cord dorsal horn (DH) remains incompletely understood. We address this in mice using the spared nerve injury model of neuropathic pain and in vivo electrophysiological recordings. Surprisingly, despite dramatic behavioral over-reactivity to mechanical stimuli following nerve injury, an overall increase in sensitivity or reactivity of DH neurons is not observed. We do, however, observe a marked decrease in correlated neural firing patterns, including the synchrony of mechanical stimulus-evoked firing, across the DH. Alterations in DH temporal firing patterns are recapitulated by silencing DH parvalbumin+ (PV+) interneurons, previously implicated in mechanical allodynia, as are allodynic pain-like behaviors. These findings reveal decorrelated DH network activity, driven by alterations in PV+ interneurons, as a prominent feature of neuropathic pain and suggest restoration of proper temporal activity as a potential therapeutic strategy to treat chronic neuropathic pain.

Abstract: Summary
Cerebellar involvement in both motor and non-motor functions manifests in specific regions of the human cerebellum, revealing the functional heterogeneity within it. One compelling theory places the heterogeneity within the cerebellar functional hierarchy along the sensorimotor-association (SA) axis. Despite extensive neuroimaging studies, evidence for the cerebellar SA axis from different modalities and scales was lacking. Thus, we establish a significant link between the cerebellar SA axis and spatio-molecular profiles. Utilizing the gene set variation analysis, we find the intermediate biological principles the significant genes leveraged to scaffold the cerebellar SA axis. Interestingly, we find these spatio-molecular profiles notably associated with neuropsychiatric dysfunction and recent evolution. Furthermore, cerebello-cerebral interactions at genetic and functional connectivity levels mirror the cerebral cortex and cerebellum’s SA axis. These findings can provide a deeper understanding of how the human cerebellar SA axis is shaped and its role in transitioning from sensorimotor to association functions.

Abstract: Summary
The precise roles of chromatin organization at osteoporosis risk loci remain largely elusive. Here, we combined chromatin interaction conformation (Hi-C) profiling and self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (STARR-seq) to qualify enhancer activities of prioritized osteoporosis-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We identified 319 SNPs with biased allelic enhancer activity effect (baaSNPs) that linked to hundreds of candidate target genes through chromatin interactions across 146 loci. Functional characterizations revealed active epigenetic enrichment for baaSNPs and prevailing osteoporosis-relevant regulatory roles for their chromatin interaction genes. Further motif enrichment and network mapping prioritized several putative, key transcription factors (TFs) controlling osteoporosis binding to baaSNPs. Specifically, we selected one top-ranked TF and deciphered that an intronic baaSNP (rs11202530) could allele-preferentially bind to YY2 to augment PAPSS2 expression through chromatin interactions and promote osteoblast differentiation. Our results underline the roles of TF-mediated enhancer-promoter contacts for osteoporosis, which may help to better understand the intricate molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying osteoporosis risk loci.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy is crucial for degrading and recycling cellular components. Fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes is pivotal, directing autophagic cargo to degradation. This process is driven by STX17-SNAP29-VAMP8 and STX7-SNAP29-YKT6 in mammalian cells. However, the interaction between STX17 and YKT6 and its significance remain to be revealed. In this study, we challenge the notion that STX17 and YKT6 function independently in autophagosome-lysosome fusion. YKT6, through its SNARE domain, forms a complex with STX17 and SNAP29 on autophagosomes, enhancing autophagy flux. VAMP8 displaces YKT6 from this complex, leading to the formation of the fusogenic complex STX17-SNAP29-VAMP8. We demonstrated that the YKT6-SNAP29-STX17 complex facilitates both lipid and content mixing driven by STX17-SNAP29-VAMP8, suggesting a priming role of YKT6 for efficient membrane fusion. Our results provide a potential regulation mechanism of autophagosome-lysosome fusion, highlighting the importance of YKT6 and its interactions with STX17 and SNAP29 in promoting autophagy flux.

Abstract: Summary
Organisms sensing environmental cues and internal states and integrating the sensory information to control fecundity are essential for survival and proliferation. The present study finds that a moderate cold temperature of 11°C reduces egg laying in Caenorhabditis elegans. ASEL and AWC neurons sense the cold via GCY-20 signaling and act antagonistically on egg laying through the ASEL and AWC/AIA/HSN circuits. Upon cold stimulation, ASEL and AWC release glutamate to activate and inhibit AIA interneurons by acting on highly and lowly sensitive ionotropic GLR-2 and GLC-3 receptors, respectively. AIA inhibits HSN motor neuron activity via acetylcholinergic ACR-14 receptor signaling and suppresses egg laying. Thus, ASEL and AWC initiate and reduce the cold suppression of egg laying. ASEL’s action on AIA and egg laying dominates AWC’s action. The biased opposite actions of these neurons on egg laying provide animals with a precise adaptation of reproductive behavior to environmental temperatures.

Abstract: Summary
LMNA gene mutation can cause muscular dystrophy, and post-translational modification plays a critical role in regulating its function. Here, we identify that lamin A is palmitoylated at cysteine 522, 588, and 591 residues, which are reversely catalyzed by palmitoyltransferase zinc finger DHHC-type palmitoyltransferase 5 (ZDHHC5) and depalmitoylase α/β hydrolase domain 7 (ABHD7). Furthermore, the metabolite lactate promotes palmitoylation of lamin A by inhibiting the interaction between it and ABHD7. Interestingly, low-level palmitoylation of lamin A promotes, whereas high-level palmitoylation of lamin A inhibits, murine myoblast differentiation. Together, these observations suggest that ABHD7-mediated depalmitoylation of lamin A controls myoblast differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Spatial single-cell omics provides a readout of biochemical processes. It is challenging to capture the transient lipidome/metabolome from cells in a native tissue environment. We employed water gas cluster ion beam secondary ion mass spectrometry imaging ([H2O]n>28K-GCIB-SIMS) at ≤3 μm resolution using a cryogenic imaging workflow. This allowed multiple biomolecular imaging modes on the near-native-state liver at single-cell resolution. Our workflow utilizes desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) to build a reference map of metabolic heterogeneity and zonation across liver functional units at tissue level. Cryogenic dual-SIMS integrated metabolomics, lipidomics, and proteomics in the same liver lobules at single-cell level, characterizing the cellular landscape and metabolic states in different cell types. Lipids and metabolites classified liver metabolic zones, cell types and subtypes, highlighting the power of spatial multi-omics at high spatial resolution for understanding celluar and biomolecular organizations in the mammalian liver.

Abstract: The Na+, K+ ATPases play a fundamental role in the homeostatic functions of astrocytes. After a brief historic prologue and discussion of the subunit composition and localization of the astrocytic Na+, K+ ATPases, the review focuses on the role of the astrocytic Na+, K+ pumps in extracellular K+ and glutamate homeostasis, intracellular Na+ and Ca2+ homeostasis and signaling, regulation of synaptic transmission and neurometabolic coupling between astrocytes and neurons. Loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the astrocytic α2 Na+, K+ ATPase cause a rare monogenic form of migraine with aura (familial hemiplegic migraine type 2). On the other hand, the α2 Na+, K+ ATPase is upregulated in spinal cord and brain samples from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer disease patients, respectively. In the last part, the review focuses on i) the migraine relevant phenotypes shown by familial hemiplegic migraine type 2 knock-in mice with 50 % reduced expression of the astrocytic α2 Na+, K+ ATPase and the insights into the pathophysiology of migraine obtained from these genetic mouse models, and ii) the evidence that upregulation of the astrocytic α2 Na+, K+ ATPase in mouse models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer disease promotes neuroinflammation and contributes to progressive neurodegeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Metazoan gene expression regulation involves pausing of RNA polymerase (Pol II) in the promoter-proximal region of genes and is stabilized by DSIF and NELF. Upon depletion of elongation factors, NELF appears to accompany elongating Pol II past pause sites; however, prior work indicates that NELF prevents Pol II elongation. Here, we report cryoelectron microscopy structures of Pol II-DSIF-NELF complexes with NELF in two distinct conformations corresponding to paused and poised states. The paused NELF state supports Pol II stalling, whereas the poised NELF state enables transcription elongation as it does not support a tilted RNA-DNA hybrid. Further, the poised NELF state can accommodate TFIIS binding to Pol II, allowing for Pol II reactivation at paused or backtracking sites. Finally, we observe that the NELF-A tentacle interacts with the RPB2 protrusion and is necessary for pausing. Our results define how NELF can support pausing, reactivation, and elongation by Pol II.

Abstract: Summary
Tumors employ diverse strategies for immune evasion. Unraveling the mechanisms by which tumors suppress anti-tumor immunity facilitates the development of immunotherapies. Here, we have identified tumor-secreted fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) as a pivotal immune suppressor. FGF21 is upregulated in multiple types of tumors and promotes tumor progression. Tumor-secreted FGF21 significantly disrupts anti-tumor immunity by rewiring cholesterol metabolism of CD8+T cells. Mechanistically, FGF21 sustains the hyperactivation of AKT-mTORC1-sterol regulatory-element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) signal axis in the activated CD8+T cells, resulting in the augment of cholesterol biosynthesis and T cell exhaustion. FGF21 knockdown or blockade using a neutralizing antibody normalizes AKT-mTORC1 signaling and reduces excessive cholesterol accumulation in CD8+T cells, thus restoring CD8+T cytotoxic function and robustly suppressing tumor growth. Our findings reveal FGF21 as a “secreted immune checkpoint” that hampers anti-tumor immunity, suggesting that inhibiting FGF21 could be a valuable strategy to enhance the cancer immunotherapy efficacy.

Abstract: Summary
To maintain mitochondrial homeostasis, damaged or excessive mitochondria are culled in coordination with the physiological state of the cell. The integrated stress response (ISR) is a signaling network that recognizes diverse cellular stresses, including mitochondrial dysfunction. Because the four ISR branches converge to common outputs, it is unclear whether mitochondrial stress detected by this network can regulate mitophagy, the autophagic degradation of mitochondria. Using a whole-genome screen, we show that the heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) branch of the ISR selectively induces mitophagy. Activation of the HRI branch results in mitochondrial localization of phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2, which we show is sufficient to induce mitophagy. The HRI mitophagy pathway operates in parallel with the mitophagy pathway controlled by the Parkinson’s disease related genes PINK1 and PARKIN and is mechanistically distinct. Therefore, HRI repurposes machinery that is normally used for translational initiation to trigger mitophagy in response to mitochondrial damage.

Abstract: Summary
During genome duplication, replication forks (RFs) can be stalled by different obstacles or by depletion of replication factors or nucleotides. A limited number of histone post-translational modifications at stalled RFs are involved in RF protection and restart. Provided the recent observation that the SIN3A histone deacetylase complex reduces transcription-replication conflicts, we explore the role of the SIN3A complex in protecting RFs under stressed conditions. We observe that Sin3A protein is enriched at replicating DNA in the presence of hydroxyurea. In this situation, Sin3A-depleted cells show increased RF stalling, H3 acetylation, and DNA breaks at stalled RFs. Under Sin3A depletion, RF recovery is impaired, and DNA damage accumulates. Importantly, these effects are partially dependent on the MUS81 endonuclease, which promotes DNA breaks and MRE11-dependent DNA degradation of such breaks. We propose that chromatin deacetylation triggered by the SIN3A complex limits MUS81 cleavage of stalled RFs, promoting genome stability when DNA replication is challenged.

Abstract: Chloride ions (Cl−) play a pivotal role in synaptic inhibition in the central nervous system, primarily mediated through ionotropic mechanisms. A recent breakthrough emphathizes the significant influence of astrocytic intracellular chloride concentration ([Cl−]i) regulation, a field still in its early stages of exploration. Typically, the [Cl−]i in most animal cells is maintained at lower levels than the extracellular chloride [Cl−]o, a critical balance to prevent cell swelling due to osmotic pressure. Various Cl− transporters are expressed differently across cell types, fine-tuning the [Cl−]i, while Cl− gradients are utilised by several families of Cl− channels. Although the passive distribution of ions within cells is governed by basic biophysical principles, astrocytes actively expend energy to sustain [Cl−]i at much higher levels than those achieved passively, and much higher than neuronal [Cl−]i. Beyond the role in volume regulation, astrocytic [Cl−]i is dynamically linked to brain states and influences neuronal signalling in actively behaving animals. As a vital component of brain function, astrocytic [Cl−]i also plays a role in the development of disorders where inhibitory transmission is disrupted. This review synthesises the latest insights into astrocytic [Cl−]i, elucidating its role in modulating brain function and its implications in various pathophysiological conditions.

Abstract: Summary
The lateral root angle or gravitropic set-point angle (GSA) is an important trait for root system architecture (RSA) that determines the radial expansion of the root system. The GSA therefore plays a crucial role for the ability of plants to access nutrients and water in the soil. Only a few regulatory pathways and mechanisms that determine GSA are known. These mostly relate to auxin and cytokinin pathways. Here, we report the identification of a small molecule, mebendazole (MBZ), that modulates GSA in Arabidopsis thaliana roots and acts via the activation of ethylene signaling. MBZ directly acts on the serine/threonine protein kinase CTR1, which is a negative regulator of ethylene signaling. Our study not only shows that the ethylene signaling pathway is essential for GSA regulation but also identifies a small molecular modulator of RSA that acts downstream of ethylene receptors and that directly activates ethylene signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Oocytes are arrested in prophase I. In vertebrates, meiotic resumption is triggered by hormonal stimulation that results in cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) downregulation leading to Cdk1 activation. Yet the pathways connecting PKA to Cdk1 remain unclear. Here, we identify molecular events triggered by PKA downregulation occurring upstream of Cdk1 activation. We describe a two-step regulation controlling cyclin B1 and Mos accumulation, which depends on both translation and stabilization. Cyclin B1 accumulation is triggered by PKA inhibition upstream of Cdk1 activation, while its translation requires Cdk1 activity. Conversely, Mos translation initiates in response to the hormone, but the protein accumulates only downstream of Cdk1. Furthermore, two successive translation waves take place, the first controlled by PKA inhibition and the second by Cdk1 activation. Notably, Arpp19, an essential PKA effector, does not regulate the early PKA-dependent events. This study elucidates how PKA downregulation orchestrates multiple pathways that converge toward Cdk1 activation and induce the oocyte G2/M transition.

Abstract: Summary
ERp18 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident thioredoxin (Trx) family protein, similar to cytosolic Trx1. The Trx-like domain occupies a major portion of the whole ERp18 structure, which is postulated to be an ER paralog of cytosolic Trx1. Here, we elucidate that zinc ion (Zn2+) binds ERp18 through its catalytic motif, triggering oligomerization of ERp18 from a monomer to a trimer. While the monomeric ERp18 has disulfide oxidoreductase activity, the trimeric ERp18 acquires scavenger activity for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the ER. Depletion of ERp18 thus causes the accumulation of H2O2, which is produced during the oxidative folding of nascent polypeptides in the ER. ERp18 knockdown in C. elegans without Prx4 and GPx7/8, both of which are also known to have H2O2 scavenging activity in the ER, shortened the lifespan, suggesting that ERp18 may form a primitive and essential H2O2 scavenging system for the maintenance of redox homeostasis in the ER.

Abstract: Summary
EGF receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have achieved clinical success in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). However, tumors often show profound but transient initial response and then gain resistance. We identify transcription factor ZNF263 as being significantly decreased in osimertinib-resistant or drug-tolerant persister LUAD cells and clinical residual tumors. ZNF263 overexpression improves the initial response of cells and delays the formation of persister cells with osimertinib treatment. We further show that ZNF263 binds and recruits DNMT1 to the EGFR gene promoter, suppressing EGFR transcription with DNA hypermethylation. ZNF263 interacts with nuclear EGFR, impairing the EGFR-STAT5 interaction to enhance AURKA expression. Overexpressing ZNF263 also makes tumor cells with wild-type EGFR expression or refractory EGFR mutations more susceptible to EGFR inhibition. More importantly, lentivirus or adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated ZNF263 overexpression synergistically suppresses tumor growth and regrowth with osimertinib treatment in xenograft animal models. These findings suggest that enhancing ZNF263 may achieve complete response in LUAD with EGFR-targeted therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Legumes establish a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing rhizobia by developing nodules. Nodules are modified lateral roots that undergo changes in their cellular development in response to bacteria, but the transcriptional reprogramming that occurs in these root cells remains largely uncharacterized. Here, we describe the cell-type-specific transcriptome response of Medicago truncatula roots to rhizobia during early nodule development in the wild-type genotype Jemalong A17, complemented with a hypernodulating mutant (sunn-4) to expand the cell population responding to infection and subsequent biological inferences. The analysis identifies epidermal root hair and stele sub-cell types associated with a symbiotic response to infection and regulation of nodule proliferation. Trajectory inference shows cortex-derived cell lineages differentiating to form the nodule primordia and, posteriorly, its meristem, while modulating the regulation of phytohormone-related genes. Gene regulatory analysis of the cell transcriptomes identifies new regulators of nodulation, including STYLISH 4, for which the function is validated.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations that cause familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD) are found in amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin, the catalytic component of γ-secretase, that together produce amyloid β-peptide (Aβ). Nevertheless, whether Aβ is the primary disease driver remains controversial. We report here that FAD mutations disrupt initial proteolytic events in the multistep processing of APP substrate C99 by γ-secretase. Cryoelectron microscopy reveals that a substrate mimetic traps γ-secretase during the transition state, and this structure aligns with activated enzyme-substrate complex captured by molecular dynamics simulations. In silico simulations and in cellulo fluorescence microscopy support stabilization of enzyme-substrate complexes by FAD mutations. Neuronal expression of C99 and/or presenilin-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans leads to synaptic loss only with FAD-mutant transgenes. Designed mutations that stabilize the enzyme-substrate complex and block Aβ production likewise led to synaptic loss. Collectively, these findings implicate the stalled process—not the products—of γ-secretase cleavage of substrates in FAD pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Axons undergo striking changes in their content and distribution of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) and ion channels during myelination that underlies the switch from continuous to saltatory conduction. These changes include the removal of a large cohort of uniformly distributed CAMs that mediate initial axon-Schwann cell interactions and their replacement by a subset of CAMs that mediate domain-specific interactions of myelinated fibers. Here, using rodent models, we examine the mechanisms and significance of this removal of axonal CAMs. We show that Schwann cells just prior to myelination locally activate clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) in axons, thereby driving clearance of a broad array of axonal CAMs. CAMs engineered to resist endocytosis are persistently expressed along the axon and delay both PNS and CNS myelination. Thus, glia non-autonomously activate CME in axons to downregulate axonal CAMs and presumptively axo-glial adhesion. This promotes the transition from ensheathment to myelination while simultaneously sculpting the formation of axonal domains.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) is a major pro-inflammatory cytokine, important in many diseases, that sensitizes nociceptors through its action on a variety of ion channels, including voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channels. We show here that TNF-α acutely upregulates sensory neuron excitability and current density of threshold channel NaV1.7. Using electrophysiological recordings and live imaging, we demonstrate that this effect on NaV1.7 is mediated by p38 MAPK and identify serine 110 in the channel’s N terminus as the phospho-acceptor site, which triggers NaV1.7 channel insertion into the somatic membrane. We also show that the N terminus of NaV1.7 is sufficient to mediate this effect. Although acute TNF-α treatment increases NaV1.7-carrying vesicle accumulation at axonal endings, we did not observe increased channel insertion into the axonal membrane. These results identify molecular determinants of TNF-α-mediated regulation of NaV1.7 in sensory neurons and demonstrate compartment-specific effects of TNF-α on channel insertion in the neuronal plasma membrane.

Abstract: To explore the role of Ras-association domain family 1 A (RASSF1A) in TGFβ2-induced changes of lens epithelial cells (LECs) behavior. The human LEC line SRA01/04 cells were treated with TGFβ2 in the presence or absence of RASSF1A and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). qRT-PCR and western blot were performed to analysis mRNA and proteins expression. Cell proliferation was evaluated using MTT assay and colony formation assay. Transwell and scratch-wound healing assays were conducted to detected cell migration ability. RASSF1A was downregulated in TGFβ2-induced SRA01/04 cells. RASSF1A overexpression inhibited the cell viability, colony formation and migration abilities of SRA01/04 cells induced by TGFβ2. Overexpression of RASSF1A suppressed TGFβ2-induced EMT of SRA01/04 cells, which was manifested as inhibition of EMT-related proteins α-SMA, Vimentin, Snail and Fn expression. Moreover, RASSF1A down-regulated the expression of HDAC6. Importantly, HDAC6 reversed the effects of RASSF1A on SRA01/04 cells. These findings indicate that RASSF1A prevented TGFβ2-induced proliferation, migration, and EMT of LECs by regulating HDAC6 expression, suggesting that RASSF1A holds promise as a potential target for cataracts treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Wnt signaling is a critical determinant of cell lineage development. This study used Wnt dose-dependent induction programs to gain insights into molecular regulation of stem cell differentiation. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of hiPSCs responding to a dose escalation protocol with Wnt agonist CHIR-99021 during the exit from pluripotency to identify cell types and genetic activity driven by Wnt stimulation. Results of activated gene sets and cell types were used to build a multiple regression model that predicts the efficiency of cardiomyocyte differentiation. Cross-referencing Wnt-associated gene expression profiles to the Connectivity Map database, we identified the small-molecule drug, tranilast. We found that tranilast synergistically activates Wnt signaling to promote cardiac lineage differentiation, which we validate by in vitro analysis of hiPSC differentiation and in vivo analysis of developing quail embryos. Our study provides an integrated workflow that links experimental datasets, prediction models, and small-molecule databases to identify drug-like compounds that control cell differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Inflammation is closely associated with many neurodegenerative disorders. Yet, whether inflammation causes, exacerbates, or responds to neurodegeneration has been challenging to define because the two processes are so closely linked. Here, we disentangle inflammation from the axon damage it causes by individually blocking cytotoxic T cell function and axon degeneration. We model inflammatory damage in mouse skin, a barrier tissue that, despite frequent inflammation, must maintain proper functioning of a dense array of axon terminals. We show that sympathetic axons modulate skin inflammation through release of norepinephrine, which suppresses activation of γδ T cells via the β2 adrenergic receptor. Strong inflammatory stimulation—modeled by application of the Toll-like receptor 7 agonist imiquimod—causes progressive γδ T cell-mediated, Sarm1-dependent loss of these immunosuppressive sympathetic axons. This removes a physiological brake on T cells, initiating a positive feedback loop of enhanced inflammation and further axon damage.

Abstract: Summary
The pandemic HIV-1, HIV-1 group M, emerged from a single spillover event of its ancestral lentivirus from a chimpanzee. During human-to-human spread worldwide, HIV-1 diversified into multiple subtypes. Here, our interdisciplinary investigation mainly sheds light on the evolutionary scenario of the viral budding system of HIV-1 subtype C (HIV-1C), a most successfully spread subtype. Of the two amino acid motifs for HIV-1 budding, the P(T/S)AP and YPxL motifs, HIV-1C loses the YPxL motif. Our data imply that HIV-1C might lose this motif to evade immune pressure. Additionally, the P(T/S)AP motif is duplicated dependently of the level of HIV-1 spread in the human population, and >20% of HIV-1C harbored the duplicated P(T/S)AP motif. We further show that the duplication of the P(T/S)AP motif is caused by the expansion of the CTG triplet repeat. Altogether, our results suggest that HIV-1 has experienced a two-step evolution of the viral budding process during human-to-human spread worldwide.

Abstract: Summary
Utilization of lipids as energy substrates after birth causes cardiomyocyte (CM) cell-cycle arrest and loss of regenerative capacity in mammalian hearts. Beyond energy provision, proper management of lipid composition is crucial for cellular and organismal health, but its role in heart regeneration remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate widespread sphingolipid metabolism remodeling in neonatal hearts after injury and find that SphK1 and SphK2, isoenzymes producing the same sphingolipid metabolite sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), differently regulate cardiac regeneration. SphK2 is downregulated during heart development and determines CM proliferation via nuclear S1P-dependent modulation of histone acetylation. Reactivation of SphK2 induces adult CM cell-cycle re-entry and cytokinesis, thereby enhancing regeneration. Conversely, SphK1 is upregulated during development and promotes fibrosis through an S1P autocrine mechanism in cardiac fibroblasts. By fine-tuning the activity of each SphK isoform, we develop a therapy that simultaneously promotes myocardial repair and restricts fibrotic scarring to regenerate the infarcted adult hearts.

Abstract: The necroptotic effector molecule MLKL accumulates in neurons over the lifespan of mice, and its downregulation has the potential to improve cognition through neuroinflammation, and changes in the abundance of synaptic proteins and enzymes in the central nervous system. Notwithstanding, direct evidence of cell-autonomous effects of MLKL expression on neuronal physiology and metabolism are lacking. Here, we tested whether the overexpression of MLKL in the absence of cell death in the neuronal cell line Neuro-2a recapitulates some of the hallmarks of aging at the cellular level. Using genetically-encoded fluorescent biosensors, we monitored the cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ levels, along with the cytosolic concentrations of several metabolites involved in energy metabolism (lactate, glucose, ATP) and oxidative stress (oxidized/reduced glutathione). We found that MLKL overexpression marginally decreased cell viability, however, it led to reduced cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ elevations in response to Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space. On the contrary, Ca2+ signals were elevated after mobilizing Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum. Transient elevations in cytosolic Ca2+, mimicking neuronal stimulation, lead to higher lactate levels and lower glucose concentrations in Neuro-2a cells when overexpressing MLKL, which suggest enhanced neuronal glycolysis. Despite these alterations, energy levels and glutathione redox state in the cell bodies remained largely preserved after inducing MLKL overexpression for 24–48 h. Taken together, our proof-of-concept experiments are consistent with the hypothesis that MLKL overexpression in the absence of cell death contributes to both Ca2+ and metabolic dyshomeostasis, which are cellular hallmarks of brain aging.

Abstract: Summary
Axotomized spinal motoneurons (MNs) lose presynaptic inputs following peripheral nerve injury; however, the cellular mechanisms that lead to this form of synapse loss are currently unknown. Here, we delineate a critical role for neuronal kinase dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK)/MAP3K12, which becomes activated in axotomized neurons. Studies with conditional knockout mice indicate that DLK signaling activation in injured MNs triggers the induction of phagocytic microglia and synapse loss. Aspects of the DLK-regulated response include expression of C1q first from the axotomized MN and then later in surrounding microglia, which subsequently phagocytose presynaptic components of upstream synapses. Pharmacological ablation of microglia inhibits the loss of cholinergic C boutons from axotomized MNs. Together, the observations implicate a neuronal mechanism, governed by the DLK, in the induction of inflammation and the removal of synapses.

Abstract: Cigarette smoke extract (CSE) is known as a significant contributor to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Propofol, an anesthetic agent, has been studied for its potential protective effects against lung damage. This study aimed to elucidate the protective mechanisms of propofol against CSE-induced damage in human bronchial epithelial 16HBE cells. In CSE-induced 16HBE cells treated by propofol with or without transfection of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) interference plasmids, CCK-8 assay and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay evaluated cytotoxicity. TUNEL assay and Western blot appraised cell apoptosis. ELISA and relevant assay kits severally measured inflammatory and oxidative stress levels. DCFH-DA fluorescent probe detected intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) activity. Immunofluorescence staining and Western blot estimated pyroptosis. Also, Western blot analyzed the expression of Nrf2/NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) signaling-related proteins. Propofol was found to enhance the viability, reduce LDH release, and alleviate the apoptosis, inflammatory response, oxidative stress and pyroptosis in CSE-induced 16HBE cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Meanwhile, propofol decreased NLRP3 expression while raised Nrf2 expression. Further, after Nrf2 was silenced, the impacts of propofol on Nrf2/NLRP3 signaling, LDH release, apoptosis, inflammatory response, oxidative stress and pyroptosis in CSE-exposed 16HBE cells were eliminated. Conclusively, propofol may exert protective effects against CSE-induced damage in 16HBE cells, partly through the modulation of the Nrf2/NLRP3 signaling pathway, suggesting a potential therapeutic role for propofol in CSE-induced bronchial epithelial cell damage.

Abstract: Summary
Under stress conditions, translationally stalled mRNA and associated proteins undergo liquid-liquid phase separation and condense into cytoplasmic foci called stress granules (SGs). Many viruses hijack SGs for their pathogenesis; however, whether pathogenic bacteria also exploit this pathway remains unknown. Here, we report that members of the OspC family of Shigella flexneri induce SG formation in infected cells. Mechanistically, the OspC effectors target multiple subunits of the host translation initiation factor 3 complex by ADP-riboxanation. The modification of eIF3 leads to translational arrest and thus the formation of SGs. Furthermore, OspC-mediated SGs are beneficial for S. flexneri replication within infected host cells, and bacterial strains unable to induce SGs are attenuated for virulence in a murine model of infection. Our findings reveal a mechanism by which bacterial pathogens induce SG assembly by inactivating host translational machinery and promote bacterial proliferation in host cells.

Abstract: Summary
Follicular lymphoma (FL) is a generally incurable malignancy that evolves from developmentally blocked germinal center (GC) B cells. To promote survival and immune escape, tumor B cells undergo significant genetic changes and extensively remodel the lymphoid microenvironment. Dynamic interactions between tumor B cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME) are hypothesized to contribute to the broad spectrum of clinical behaviors observed among FL patients. Despite the urgent need, existing clinical tools do not reliably predict disease behavior. Using a multi-modal strategy, we examined cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic factors governing progression and therapeutic outcomes in FL patients enrolled onto a prospective clinical trial. By leveraging the strengths of each platform, we identify several tumor-specific features and microenvironmental patterns enriched in individuals who experience early relapse, the most high-risk FL patients. These features include stromal desmoplasia and changes to the follicular growth pattern present 20 months before first progression and first relapse.

Abstract: Summary
Animals are known to exhibit innate and learned forms of defensive behaviors, but it is unclear whether animals can escape through methods other than these forms. In this study, we develop the delayed escape task, in which male rats temporarily hold the information required for future escape, and we demonstrate that this task, in which the subject extrapolates from past experience without direct experience of its behavioral outcome, does not fall into either of the two forms of behavior. During the holding period, a subset of neurons in the rostral-to-striatum claustrum (rsCla), only when pooled together, sustain enhanced population activity without ongoing sensory stimuli. Transient inhibition of rsCla neurons during the initial part of the holding period produces prolonged inhibition of the enhanced activity. The transient inhibition also attenuates the delayed escape behavior. Our data suggest that the rsCla activity bridges escape-inducing stimuli to the delayed onset of escape.

Abstract: Summary
The tumor suppressor p53 controls cell fate decisions and prevents malignant transformation, but its functions in antiviral immunity remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that p53 metabolically promotes antiviral innate immune responses to RNA viral infection. p53-deficient macrophages or mice display reduced expression of glutamine fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase 2 (GFPT2), a key enzyme of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP). Through transcriptional upregulation of GFPT2, p53 drives HBP activity and de novo synthesis of UDP-GlcNAc, which in turn leads to the O-GlcNAcylation of mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) and UBX-domain-containing protein 1 (UBXN1) during virus infection. Moreover, O-GlcNAcylation of UBXN1 blocks its interaction with MAVS, thereby further liberating MAVS for tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3 binding to activate TANK-binding kinase 1-interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 3 signaling cascades and IFN-β production. Genetic or pharmaceutical inhibition of GFPT efficiently reduces MAVS activation and abrogates the antiviral innate immunity promoted by p53 in vitro and in vivo. Our findings reveal that p53 drives HBP activity and O-GlcNAcylation of UBXN1 and MAVS to enhance IFN-β-mediated antiviral innate immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Drug resistance is the leading problem in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) therapy. The contribution of histone methylation in mediating malignant phenotypes of NSCLC is well known. However, the role of histone methylation in NSCLC drug-resistance mechanisms remains unclear. Here, our data show that EZH2 and G9a, two histone methyltransferases, are involved in the drug resistance of NSCLC. Gene manipulation results indicate that the combination of EZH2 and G9a promotes tumor growth and mediates drug resistance in a complementary manner. Importantly, clinical study demonstrates that co-expression of both enzymes predicts a poor outcome in patients with NSCLC. Mechanistically, G9a and EZH2 interact and promote the silencing of the tumor-suppressor gene SMAD4, activating the ERK/c-Myc signaling pathway. Finally, SU08, a compound targeting both EZH2 and G9a, is demonstrated to sensitize resistant cells to therapeutic drugs by regulating the SMAD4/ERK/c-Myc signaling axis. These findings uncover the resistance mechanism and a strategy for reversing NSCLC drug resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Adenosine (Ado) mediates immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment and exhausted CD8+ CAR-T cells express CD39 and CD73, which mediate proximal steps in Ado generation. Here, we sought to enhance CAR-T cell potency by knocking out CD39, CD73, or adenosine receptor 2a (A2aR) but observed only modest effects. In contrast, overexpression of Ado deaminase (ADA-OE), which metabolizes Ado to inosine (INO), induced stemness and enhanced CAR-T functionality. Similarly, CAR-T cell exposure to INO augmented function and induced features of stemness. INO induced profound metabolic reprogramming, diminishing glycolysis, increasing mitochondrial and glycolytic capacity, glutaminolysis and polyamine synthesis, and reprogrammed the epigenome toward greater stemness. Clinical scale manufacturing using INO generated enhanced potency CAR-T cell products meeting criteria for clinical dosing. These results identify INO as a potent modulator of CAR-T cell metabolism and epigenetic stemness programming and deliver an enhanced potency platform for cell manufacturing.

Abstract: Summary
Human trophoblast stem cells (hTSCs) and related trophoblast organoids are state-of-the-art culture systems that facilitate the study of trophoblast development and human placentation. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we evaluate how organoids derived from freshly isolated first-trimester trophoblasts or from established hTSC cell lines reproduce developmental cell trajectories and transcriptional regulatory processes defined in vivo. Although organoids from primary trophoblasts and hTSCs overall model trophoblast differentiation with accuracy, specific features related to trophoblast composition, trophoblast differentiation, and transcriptional drivers of trophoblast development show levels of misalignment. This is best illustrated by the identification of an expanded progenitor state in stem cell-derived organoids that is nearly absent in vivo and transcriptionally shares both villous cytotrophoblast and extravillous trophoblast characteristics. Together, this work provides a comprehensive resource that identifies strengths and limitations of current trophoblast organoid platforms.

Abstract: Summary
To maintain an effective barrier, intestinal progenitor cells must divide at a rate that matches the loss of dead and dying cells. Otherwise, epithelial breaches expose the host to systemic infection by gut-resident microbes. Unlike most pathogens, Vibrio cholerae blocks tissue repair by arresting progenitor proliferation in the Drosophila model. At present, we do not understand how V. cholerae circumvents such a critical antibacterial defense. We find that V. cholerae blocks epithelial repair by activating the growth inhibitor bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway in progenitors. Specifically, we show that interactions between V. cholerae and gut commensals initiate BMP signaling via host innate immune defenses. Notably, we find that V. cholerae also activates BMP and arrests proliferation in zebrafish intestines, indicating an evolutionarily conserved link between infection and failure in tissue repair. Our study highlights how enteric pathogens engage host immune and growth regulatory pathways to disrupt intestinal epithelial repair.

Abstract: Summary
During kidney development, nephron epithelia arise de novo from fate-committed mesenchymal progenitors through a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). Downstream of fate specification, transcriptional mechanisms that drive establishment of epithelial morphology are poorly understood. We used human iPSC-derived renal organoids, which recapitulate nephrogenesis, to investigate mechanisms controlling renal MET. Multi-ome profiling via snRNA-seq and ATAC-seq of organoids identified dynamic changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility driven by activators and repressors throughout MET. CRISPR interference identified that paired box 8 (PAX8) is essential for initiation of MET in human renal organoids, contrary to in vivo mouse studies, likely by activating a cell-adhesion program. While Wnt/β-catenin signaling specifies nephron fate, we find that it must be attenuated to allow hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-beta (HNF1B) and TEA-domain (TEAD) transcription factors to drive completion of MET. These results identify the interplay between fate commitment and morphogenesis in the developing human kidney, with implications for understanding both developmental kidney diseases and aberrant epithelial plasticity following adult renal tubular injury.

Abstract: Summary
Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is reported to bind to many RNAs and has become a central player in reports of how long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate gene expression. Yet, there is a growing discrepancy between the biochemical evidence supporting specific lncRNA-PRC2 interactions and functional evidence demonstrating that PRC2 is often dispensable for lncRNA function. Here, we revisit the evidence supporting RNA binding by PRC2 and show that many reported interactions may not occur in vivo. Using denaturing purification of in vivo crosslinked RNA-protein complexes in human and mouse cell lines, we observe a loss of detectable RNA binding to PRC2 and chromatin-associated proteins previously reported to bind RNA (CTCF, YY1, and others), despite accurately mapping bona fide RNA-binding sites across others (SPEN, TET2, and others). Taken together, these results argue for a critical re-evaluation of the broad role of RNA binding to orchestrate various chromatin regulatory mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
The mystery of appendage regeneration has fascinated humans for centuries, while the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we establish a transcriptional landscape of regenerating leg in the American cockroach, Periplaneta americana, an ideal model in appendage regeneration studies showing remarkable regeneration capacity. Through a large-scale in vivo screening, we identify multiple signaling pathways and transcription factors controlling leg regeneration. Specifically, zfh-2 and bowl contribute to blastema cell proliferation and morphogenesis in two transcriptional cascades: bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/JAK-STAT-zfh-2-B-H2 and Notch-drm/bowl-bab1. Notably, we find zfh-2 is working as a direct target of BMP signaling to promote cell proliferation in the blastema. These mechanisms might be conserved in the appendage regeneration of vertebrates from an evolutionary perspective. Overall, our findings reveal that two crucial transcriptional cascades orchestrate distinct cockroach leg regeneration processes, significantly advancing the comprehension of molecular mechanism in appendage regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Molecular chaperones are critical for protein homeostasis and are implicated in several human pathologies such as neurodegeneration and cancer. While the binding of chaperones to nascent and misfolded proteins has been studied in great detail, the direct interaction between chaperones and RNA has not been systematically investigated. Here, we provide the evidence for widespread interaction between chaperones and RNA in human cells. We show that the major chaperone heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) binds to non-coding RNA transcribed by RNA polymerase III (RNA Pol III) such as tRNA and 5S rRNA. Global chromatin profiling revealed that HSP70 binds genomic sites of transcription by RNA Pol III. Detailed biochemical analyses showed that HSP70 alleviates the inhibitory effect of cognate tRNA transcript on tRNA gene transcription. Thus, our study uncovers an unexpected role of HSP70-RNA interaction in the biogenesis of a specific class of non-coding RNA with wider implications in cancer therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
The acidic metabolic byproducts within the tumor microenvironment (TME) hinder T cell effector functions. However, their effects on T cell infiltration remain largely unexplored. Leveraging the comprehensive The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset, we pinpoint 16 genes that correlate with extracellular acidification and establish a metric known as the “tumor acidity (TuAci) score” for individual patients. We consistently observe a negative association between the TuAci score and T lymphocyte score (T score) across various human cancer types. Mechanistically, extracellular acidification significantly impedes T cell motility by suppressing podosome formation. This phenomenon can be attributed to the reduced expression of methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) and the modification of RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A), resulting in a subsequent decrease in the expression of integrin β1 (ITGB1). Importantly, enforced ITGB1 expression leads to enhanced T cell infiltration and improved antitumor activity. Our study suggests that modulating METTL3 activity or boosting ITGB1 expression could augment T cell infiltration within the acidic TME, thereby improving the efficacy of cell therapy.

Abstract: Summary
The nature and function of perisaccadic receptive field (RF) remapping have been controversial. We use a delayed saccade task to reduce previous confounds and examine the remapping time course in the lateral intraparietal area and frontal eye fields. In the delay period, the RF shift direction turns from the initial fixation to the saccade target. In the perisaccadic period, RFs first shift toward the target (convergent remapping), but around the time of saccade onset/offset, the shifts become predominantly toward the post-saccadic RF locations (forward remapping). Thus, unlike forward remapping that depends on the corollary discharge (CD) of the saccade command, convergent remapping appears to follow attention from the initial fixation to the target. We model the data with attention-modulated and CD-gated connections and show that both sets of connections emerge automatically in neural networks trained to update stimulus retinal locations across saccades. Our work thus unifies previous findings into a mechanism for transsaccadic visual stability.

Abstract: Summary
Flavonoids are a class of secondary metabolites widely distributed in plants. Regiospecific modification by methylation and glycosylation determines flavonoid diversity. A rare flavone glycoside, diosmin (luteolin-4′-methoxyl-7-O-glucosyl-rhamnoside), occurs in Chrysanthemum indicum. How Chrysanthemum plants evolve new biosynthetic capacities remains elusive. Here, we assemble a 3.11-Gb high-quality C. indicum genome with a contig N50 value of 4.39 Mb and annotate 50,606 protein-coding genes. One (CiCOMT10) of the tandemly repeated O-methyltransferase genes undergoes neofunctionalization, preferentially transferring the methyl group to the 4′-hydroxyl group of luteolin with ortho-substituents to form diosmetin. In addition, CiUGT11 (UGT88B3) specifically glucosylates 7-OH group of diosmetin. Next, we construct a one-pot cascade biocatalyst system by combining CiCOMT10, CiUGT11, and our previously identified rhamnosyltransferase, effectively producing diosmin with over 80% conversion from luteolin. This study clarifies the role of transferases in flavonoid diversity and provides important gene elements essential for producing rare flavone.

Abstract: Summary
Macrophage recruitment to the injured nerve initiates a cascade of events, including myelin debris clearance and nerve trophic factor secretion, which contribute to proper nerve tissue repair. However, the mechanism of macrophage recruitment is still unclear. Here, by comparing wild-type with Mlkl−/− and Sarm1−/− mice, two mouse strains with impaired myelin debris clearance after peripheral nerve injury, we identify interleukin-17B (IL-17B) as a key regulator of macrophage recruitment. Schwann-cell-secreted IL-17B acts in an autocrine manner and binds to IL-17 receptor B to promote macrophage recruitment, and global or Schwann-cell-specific IL-17B deletion reduces macrophage infiltration, myelin clearance, and axon regeneration. We also show that the IL-17B signaling pathway is defective in the injured central nerves. These results reveal an important role for Schwann cell autocrine signaling during Wallerian degeneration and point to potential mechanistic targets for accelerating myelin clearance and improving demyelinating disease.

Abstract: Summary
Quantifying and predicting growth rate phenotype given variation in gene expression and environment is complicated by epistatic interactions and the vast combinatorial space of possible perturbations. We developed an approach for mapping expression-growth rate landscapes that integrates sparsely sampled experimental measurements with an interpretable machine learning model. We used mismatch CRISPRi across pairs and triples of genes to create over 8,000 titrated changes in E. coli gene expression under varied environmental contexts, exploring epistasis in up to 22 distinct environments. Our results show that a pairwise model previously used to describe drug interactions well-described these data. The model yielded interpretable parameters related to pathway architecture and generalized to predict the combined effect of up to four perturbations when trained solely on pairwise perturbation data. We anticipate this approach will be broadly applicable in optimizing bacterial growth conditions, generating pharmacogenomic models, and understanding the fundamental constraints on bacterial gene expression. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
Glucose uptake increases during B cell activation and antibody-secreting cell (ASC) differentiation, but conflicting findings prevent a clear metabolic profile at different stages of B cell activation. Deletion of the glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1) gene in mature B cells (GLUT1-cKO) results in normal B cell development, but it reduces germinal center B cells and ASCs. GLUT1-cKO mice show decreased antigen-specific antibody titers after vaccination. In vitro, GLUT1-deficient B cells show impaired activation, whereas established plasmablasts abolish glycolysis, relying on mitochondrial activity and fatty acids. Transcriptomics and metabolomics reveal an altered anaplerotic balance in GLUT1-deficient ASCs. Despite attempts to compensate for glucose deprivation by increasing mitochondrial mass and gene expression associated with glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and hexosamine synthesis, GLUT1-deficient ASCs lack the metabolites for energy production and mitochondrial respiration, limiting protein synthesis. We identify GLUT1 as a critical metabolic player defining the germinal center response and humoral immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Without new transcription, gene expression across the oocyte-to-embryo transition (OET) relies instead on regulation of mRNA poly(A) tails to control translation. However, how tail dynamics shape translation across the OET in mammals remains unclear. We perform long-read RNA sequencing to uncover poly(A) tail lengths across the mouse OET and, incorporating published ribosome profiling data, provide an integrated, transcriptome-wide analysis of poly(A) tails and translation across the entire transition. We uncover an extended wave of global deadenylation during fertilization in which short-tailed, oocyte-deposited mRNAs are translationally activated without polyadenylation through resistance to deadenylation. Subsequently, in the embryo, mRNAs are readenylated and translated in a surge of global polyadenylation. We further identify regulation of poly(A) tail length at the isoform level and stage-specific enrichment of mRNA sequence motifs among regulated transcripts. These data provide insight into the stage-specific mechanisms of poly(A) tail regulation that orchestrate gene expression from oocyte to embryo in mammals.

Abstract: Summary
Influenza A virus (IAV) represents a constant public health threat. The single-stranded, segmented RNA genome of IAV is replicated in host cell nuclei as a series of 8 ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs) with RNA structures known to exert essential function to support viral replication. Here, we investigate RNA secondary structures and RNA interactions networks of the IAV genome and construct an in vivo structure model for each of the 8 IAV genome segments. Our analyses reveal an overall in vivo and in virio resemblance of the IAV genome conformation but also wide disparities among long-range and intersegment interactions. Moreover, we identify a long-range RNA interaction that exerts an essential role in genome packaging. Disrupting this structure displays reduced infectivity, attenuating virus pathogenicity in mice. Our findings characterize the in vivo RNA structural landscape of the IAV genome and reveal viral RNA structures that can be targeted to develop antiviral interventions.

Abstract: Summary
There are limited methods to stably analyze the interactions between cancer cells and glial cells in vitro, which hinders our molecular understanding. Here, we develop a simple and stable culture method of mouse glial cells, termed mixed-glial culture on/in soft substrate (MGS), which serves well as a platform to study cancer-glia interactions. Using this method, we find that human lung cancer cells become overly dependent on metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) signaling in the brain microenvironment. Mechanistically, interactions with astrocytes induce mGluR1 in cancer cells through the Wnt-5a/prickle planar cell polarity protein 1 (PRICKLE1)/RE1 silencing transcription factor (REST) axis. Induced mGluR1 directly interacts with and stabilizes the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in a glutamate-dependent manner, and these cells then become responsive to mGluR1 inhibition. Our results highlight increased dependence on mGluR1 signaling as an adaptive strategy and vulnerability of human lung cancer brain metastasis.

Retinal I/R injury model was established in vivo, and the histological changes was examined by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and immunofluorescent assay was performed to examine SOX9 expression. Oxygenation-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-induced retinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in 661 W cells was constructed as an in vitro cellular model of glaucoma. The production of cytokines, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and the antioxidant enzymes were assessed by their commercial kits. Cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid ROS was detected using DCFH-DA and C11-BODIPY 581/591 staining, respectively. Lipid peroxidation and Fe2+ level were detected to assess the ferroptosis level. Protein expression was examined by western blot. LM22B-10, the agonist of ERK signaling, was used to pretreat 661 W cells for mechanism investigation.
Results
SOX9 was aberrantly upregulated following retinal I/R injury both in vivo and in vitro. SOX9 knockdown exerted a protective role against OGD/R-triggered oxidative stress, inflammatory response and ferroptosis in 661 W cells. Further, ERK/p38 signaling was activated in 661 W cells following OGD/R induction, which was repressed by SOX9 knockdown, and the ERK signaling agonist partially counteracted the protective role of SOX9 knockdown against oxidative stress, inflammatory response and ferroptosis in OGD/R-induced 661 W cells.
Conclusion
Collectively, inhibiting SOX9 to block oxidative stress, inflammation and ferroptosis by inactivating ERK/p38 signaling might be effective to prevent retinal I/R injury, thereby alleviating glaucoma.

Abstract: Summary
RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) can backtrack during transcription elongation, exposing the 3′ end of nascent RNA. Nascent RNA sequencing can approximate the location of backtracking events that are quickly resolved; however, the extent and genome-wide distribution of more persistent backtracking are unknown. Consequently, we developed a method to directly sequence the extruded, “backtracked” 3′ RNA. Our data show that RNA Pol II slides backward more than 20 nt in human cells and can persist in this backtracked state. Persistent backtracking mainly occurs where RNA Pol II pauses near promoters and intron-exon junctions and is enriched in genes involved in translation, replication, and development, where gene expression is decreased if these events are unresolved. Histone genes are highly prone to persistent backtracking, and the resolution of such events is likely required for timely expression during cell division. These results demonstrate that persistent backtracking can potentially affect diverse gene expression programs.

Abstract: Intravesical infusion of chemotherapeutics is highly recommended by several clinical guidelines for treating nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). However, cytotoxic chemotherapeutics can cause a series of side effects, which greatly limits their application. Herein, a starvation therapy strategy was proposed, and elafibranor (ELA) was validated as a safe chemotherapeutic for NMIBC. The results showed that 20 μM ELA was sufficient to inhibit the proliferation and migration of bladder cancer cells and increase the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, 2 mg/kg ELA treatment blocked the growth of primary tumors in an immunodeficient model by inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis and improved the survival time of immunocompetent model mice. ELA treatment up to 10 mg/kg met the general safety requirements. We also established a patient-derived conditional reprogramming cell (CRC) model to assess the clinical translational potential of ELA. The antitumor effect and antitumor specificity of ELA treatment were confirmed. This work not only identified a promising chemotherapeutic for NMIBC but also provided a potential methodological system for drug discovery.

Abstract: Summary
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the basal lateral amygdala (BLA) has been established to correct symptoms of refractory post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, how BLA DBS operates in correcting PTSD symptoms and how the BLA elicits pathological fear and anxiety in PTSD remain unclear. Here, we discover that excitatory synaptic transmission from the BLA projection neurons (PNs) to the adBNST, and lateral central amygdala (CeL) is greatly suppressed in a mouse PTSD model induced by foot shock (FS). BLA DBS revises the weakened inputs from the BLA to these two areas to improve fear and anxiety. Optogenetic manipulation of the BLA-adBNST and BLA-CeL circuits shows that both circuits are responsible for anxiety but the BLA-CeL for fear in FS mice. Our results reveal that synaptic transmission dysregulation of the BLA-adBNST or BLA-CeL circuits is reversed by BLA DBS, which improves anxiety and fear in the FS mouse model.

Abstract: Summary
In eukaryotic genomes, rDNA generally resides as a highly repetitive and dynamic structure, making it difficult to study. Here, a synthetic rDNA array on chromosome III in budding yeast was constructed to serve as the sole source of rRNA. Utilizing the loxPsym site within each rDNA repeat and the Cre recombinase, we were able to reduce the copy number to as few as eight copies. Additionally, we constructed strains with two or three rDNA arrays and found that the presence of multiple arrays did not affect the formation of a single nucleolus. Although alteration of the position and number of rDNA arrays did impact the three-dimensional genome structure, the additional rDNA arrays had no deleterious influence on cell growth or transcriptomes. Overall, this study sheds light on the high plasticity of rDNA organization and opens up opportunities for future rDNA engineering.

Abstract: Summary
Activation of endosomal Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7, TLR9, and TLR11/12 is a key event in the resistance against the parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Endosomal TLR engagement leads to expression of interleukin (IL)-12 via the myddosome, a protein complex containing MyD88 and IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) 4 in addition to IRAK1 or IRAK2. In murine macrophages, IRAK2 is essential for IL-12 production via endosomal TLRs but, surprisingly, Irak2−/− mice are only slightly susceptible to T. gondii infection, similar to Irak1−/− mice. Here, we report that upon T. gondii infection IL-12 production by different cell populations requires either IRAK1 or IRAK2, with conventional dendritic cells (DCs) requiring IRAK1 and monocyte-derived DCs (MO-DCs) requiring IRAK2. In both populations, we identify interferon regulatory factor 5 as the main transcription factor driving the myddosome-dependent IL-12 production during T. gondii infection. Consistent with a redundant role of DCs and MO-DCs, mutations that affect IL-12 production in both cell populations show high susceptibility to infection in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
R2TP is a chaperone complex consisting of the AAA+ ATPases RUVBL1 and RUVBL2, as well as RPAP3 and PIH1D1 proteins. R2TP is responsible for the assembly of macromolecular complexes mainly acting through different adaptors. Using proximity-labeling mass spectrometry, we identified deleted in primary ciliary dyskinesia (DPCD) as an adaptor of R2TP. Here, we demonstrate that R2TP-DPCD influences ciliogenesis initiation through a unique mechanism by interaction with Akt kinase to regulate its phosphorylation levels rather than its stability. We further show that DPCD is a heart-shaped monomeric protein with two domains. A highly conserved region in the cysteine- and histidine-rich domains-containing proteins and SGT1 (CS) domain of DPCD interacts with the RUVBL2 DII domain with high affinity to form a stable R2TP-DPCD complex both in cellulo and in vitro. Considering that DPCD is one among several CS-domain-containing proteins found to associate with RUVBL1/2, we propose that RUVBL1/2 are CS-domain-binding proteins that regulate complex assembly and downstream signaling.

Abstract: Summary
KRASG12C inhibitors (adagrasib and sotorasib) have shown clinical promise in targeting KRASG12C-mutated lung cancers; however, most patients eventually develop resistance. In lung patients with adenocarcinoma with KRASG12C and STK11/LKB1 co-mutations, we find an enrichment of the squamous cell carcinoma gene signature in pre-treatment biopsies correlates with a poor response to adagrasib. Studies of Lkb1-deficient KRASG12C and KrasG12D lung cancer mouse models and organoids treated with KRAS inhibitors reveal tumors invoke a lineage plasticity program, adeno-to-squamous transition (AST), that enables resistance to KRAS inhibition. Transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses reveal ΔNp63 drives AST and modulates response to KRAS inhibition. We identify an intermediate high-plastic cell state marked by expression of an AST plasticity signature and Krt6a. Notably, expression of the AST plasticity signature and KRT6A at baseline correlates with poor adagrasib responses. These data indicate the role of AST in KRAS inhibitor resistance and provide predictive biomarkers for KRAS-targeted therapies in lung cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Blood-borne pathogens can cause systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) followed by protracted, potentially lethal immunosuppression. The mechanisms responsible for impaired immunity post-SIRS remain unclear. We show that SIRS triggered by pathogen mimics or malaria infection leads to functional paralysis of conventional dendritic cells (cDCs). Paralysis affects several generations of cDCs and impairs immunity for 3–4 weeks. Paralyzed cDCs display distinct transcriptomic and phenotypic signatures and show impaired capacity to capture and present antigens in vivo. They also display altered cytokine production patterns upon stimulation. The paralysis program is not initiated in the bone marrow but during final cDC differentiation in peripheral tissues under the influence of local secondary signals that persist after resolution of SIRS. Vaccination with monoclonal antibodies that target cDC receptors or blockade of transforming growth factor β partially overcomes paralysis and immunosuppression. This work provides insights into the mechanisms of paralysis and describes strategies to restore immunocompetence post-SIRS.

Abstract: Summary
Learning causal relationships is crucial for survival. The human brain’s functional flexibility allows for effective causal inference, underlying various learning processes. While past studies focused on environmental factors influencing causal inference, a fundamental question remains: can these factors be manipulated for strategic causal inference control? This paper presents a task control framework for orchestrating causal learning task design. It utilizes a two-player game setting where a neural network learns to manipulate task variables by interacting with a human causal inference model. Training the task controller to generate experimental designs, we confirm its ability to accommodate complexities of environmental causal structure. Experiments involving 126 human subjects successfully validate the impact of task control on performance and learning efficiency. Additionally, we find that task control policy reflects the intrinsic nature of human causal inference: one-shot learning. This framework holds promising potential for applications paving the way for targeted behavioral outcomes in humans.

Abstract: Summary
Oct4 is a pioneer transcription factor regulating pluripotency. However, it is not well known whether Oct4 has an impact on epidermal cells. We generated OCT4 knockout clonal cell lines using immortalized human skin keratinocytes to identify a functional role for the protein. Here, we report that Oct4-deficient cells transitioned into a mesenchymal-like phenotype with enlarged size and shape, exhibited accelerated migratory behavior, decreased adhesion, and appeared arrested at the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint. Oct4 absence had a profound impact on cortical actin organization, with loss of microfilaments from the cell membrane, increased puncta deposition in the cytoplasm, and stress fiber formation. E-cadherin, β-catenin, and ZO1 were almost absent from cell-cell contacts, while fibronectin deposition was markedly increased in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Mapping of the transcriptional and chromatin profiles of Oct4-deficient cells revealed that Oct4 controls the levels of cytoskeletal, ECM, and differentiation-related genes, whereas epithelial identity is preserved through transcriptional and non-transcriptional mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
The Piwi/Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway protects genome integrity in animal germ lines. Maturation of piRNAs involves nucleolytic processing at both 5′ and 3′ ends. The ribonuclease PARN-1 and its orthologs mediate piRNA 3′ trimming in worms, insects, and mammals. However, the significance of this evolutionarily conserved processing step is not fully understood. Employing C. elegans as a model, we recently discovered that 3′ trimming protects piRNAs against non-templated nucleotide additions and degradation. Here, we find that worms lacking PARN-1 accumulate an uncharacterized RNA species termed anti-piRNAs, which are antisense to piRNAs. Anti-piRNAs associate with Piwi proteins, are 17–19 nucleotides long, and begin with 5′ guanine or adenine. Untrimmed pre-piRNAs are misdirected by the terminal nucleotidyltransferase RDE-3 and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase EGO-1, leading to the formation of anti-piRNAs. This work identifies a class of small RNAs in parn-1 mutants and provides insight into the activities of RDE-3, EGO-1, and Piwi proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Actin cytoskeleton remodeling sustains the ability of cytotoxic T cells to search for target cells and eliminate them. We here investigated the relationship between energetic status, actin remodeling, and functional fitness in human CD8+ effector T cells. Cell spreading during migration or immunological synapse assembly mirrored cytotoxic activity. Morphological and functional fitness were boosted by interleukin-2 (IL-2), which also stimulated the transcription of glycolytic enzymes, actin isoforms, and actin-related protein (ARP)2/3 complex subunits. This molecular program scaled with F-actin content and cell spreading. Inhibiting glycolysis impaired F-actin remodeling at the lamellipodium, chemokine-driven motility, and adhesion, while mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation blockade impacted cell elongation during confined migration. The severe morphological and functional defects of ARPC1B-deficient T cells were only partially corrected by IL-2, emphasizing ARP2/3-mediated actin polymerization as a crucial energy state integrator. The study therefore underscores the tight coordination between metabolic and actin remodeling programs to sustain the cytotoxic activity of CD8+ T cells.

Abstract: Diabetes is a global problem that threatens human health. Cell therapy methods using stem cells, and tissue engineering of pancreatic islets as new therapeutic approaches have increased the chances of successful diabetes treatment. In this study, to differentiate Wharton's Jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells (WJ-MSCs) into insulin-producing cells (IPCs) with improved maturity, and function, platelet-rich plasma (PRP)-Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-Polycaprolactone (PCL)/PCL scaffold was designed. The two-dimensional (2D) control group included cell culture without differentiation medium, and the experimental groups included 2D, and three-dimensional (3D) groups with pancreatic beta cell differentiation medium. WJ-MSCs-derived IPCs on PRP-PVP-PCL/PCL scaffold took round cluster morphology, the typical pancreatic islets morphology. Real-time PCR, immunocytochemistry, and flowcytometry data showed a significant increase in pancreatic marker genes in WJ-MSCs-derived IPCs on the PRP-PVP-PCL/PCL scaffold compared to the 2D-experimental group. Also, using the ELISA assay, a significant increase in the secretion of insulin, and C-peptide was measured in the WJ-MSCs-derived IPCs of the 3D-experimental group compared to the 2D experimental group, the highest amount of insulin (38 µlU/ml), and C-peptide (43 pmol/l) secretion was in the 3D experimental group, and in response to 25 mM glucose solution, which indicated a significant improvement in the functional level of the WJ-MSCs-derived IPCs in the 3D group. The results showed that the PRP-PVP-PCL/PCL scaffold can provide an appropriate microenvironment for the engineering of pancreatic islets, and the generation of IPCs.

Abstract: Summary
Elevated interleukin (IL)-1β levels, NLRP3 inflammasome activity, and systemic inflammation are hallmarks of chronic metabolic inflammatory syndromes, but the mechanistic basis for this is unclear. Here, we show that levels of plasma IL-1β are lower in fasting compared to fed subjects, while the lipid arachidonic acid (AA) is elevated. Lipid profiling of NLRP3-stimulated mouse macrophages shows enhanced AA production and an NLRP3-dependent eicosanoid signature. Inhibition of cyclooxygenase by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs decreases eicosanoid, but not AA, production. It also reduces both IL-1β and IL-18 production in response to NLRP3 activation. AA inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activity in human and mouse macrophages. Mechanistically, AA inhibits phospholipase C activity to reduce JNK1 stimulation and hence NLRP3 activity. These data show that AA is an important physiological regulator of the NLRP3 inflammasome and explains why fasting reduces systemic inflammation and also suggests a mechanism to explain how nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs work.

Abstract: Summary
The neural mechanisms underlying novelty detection are not well understood, especially in relation to behavior. Here, we present single-unit responses from the primary auditory cortex (A1) from two monkeys trained to detect deviant tones amid repetitive ones. Results show that monkeys can detect deviant sounds, and there is a strong correlation between late neuronal responses (250–350 ms after deviant onset) and the monkeys’ perceptual decisions. The magnitude and timing of both neuronal and behavioral responses are increased by larger frequency differences between the deviant and standard tones and by increasing the number of standard tones preceding the deviant. This suggests that A1 neurons encode novelty detection in behaving monkeys, influenced by stimulus relevance and expectations. This study provides evidence supporting aspects of predictive coding in the sensory cortex.

Abstract: Summary
The cotyledons of etiolated seedlings from terrestrial flowering plants must emerge from the soil surface, while roots must penetrate the soil to ensure plant survival. We show here that the soil emergence-related transcription factor PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 3 (PIF3) controls root penetration via transducing external signals perceived by the receptor kinase FERONIA (FER) in Arabidopsis thaliana. The loss of FER function in Arabidopsis and soybean (Glycine max) mutants resulted in a severe defect in root penetration into agar medium or hard soil. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) profiling of Arabidopsis roots identified a distinct cell clustering pattern, especially for root cap cells, and identified PIF3 as a FER-regulated transcription factor. Biochemical, imaging, and genetic experiments confirmed that PIF3 is required for root penetration into soil. Moreover, FER interacted with and stabilized PIF3 to modulate the expression of mechanosensitive ion channel PIEZO and the sloughing of outer root cap cells.

Abstract: Summary
Brassinosteroid (BR) signaling leads to the nuclear accumulation of the BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT 1 (BZR1) transcription factor, which plays dual roles in activating or repressing the expression of thousands of genes. BZR1 represses gene expression by recruiting histone deacetylases, but how it activates transcription of BR-induced genes remains unclear. Here, we show that BR reshapes the genome-wide chromatin accessibility landscape, increasing the accessibility of BR-induced genes and reducing the accessibility of BR-repressed genes in Arabidopsis. BZR1 physically interacts with the BRAHMA-associated SWI/SNF (BAS)-chromatin-remodeling complex on the genome and selectively recruits the BAS complex to BR-activated genes. Depletion of BAS abrogates the capacities of BZR1 to increase chromatin accessibility, activate gene expression, and promote cell elongation without affecting BZR1’s ability to reduce chromatin accessibility and expression of BR-repressed genes. Together, these data identify that BZR1 recruits the BAS complex to open chromatin and to mediate BR-induced transcriptional activation of growth-promoting genes.

Abstract: Ribisin A has been shown to have neurotrophic activity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of ribisin A on injured PC12 cells and elucidate its mechanism. In this project, PC12 cells were induced by H2O2 to establish an injury model. After treatment with ribisin A, the neuroprotective mechanism of ribisin A was investigated by methyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay, Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), flow cytometric analysis, fluorescent probe analysis, and western blot. We found that ribisin A decreased the rate of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, increased cellular superoxide dismutase (SOD) level, decreased the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), Ca2+ expression and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Moreover, ribisin A significantly increased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and inhibited apoptosis of PC12 cells. Meanwhile, ribisin A activated the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and its downstream molecule CREB by upregulating the expression of Trk A and Trk B, the upstream molecules of the ERK signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Thrombosis represents the leading cause of death and disability upon major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). Numerous pathological conditions such as COVID-19 and metabolic disorders can lead to a heightened thrombotic risk; however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Our study illustrates that 2-methylbutyrylcarnitine (2MBC), a branched-chain acylcarnitine, is accumulated in patients with COVID-19 and in patients with MACEs. 2MBC enhances platelet hyperreactivity and thrombus formation in mice. Mechanistically, 2MBC binds to integrin α2β1 in platelets, potentiating cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) activation and platelet hyperresponsiveness. Genetic depletion or pharmacological inhibition of integrin α2β1 largely reverses the pro-thrombotic effects of 2MBC. Notably, 2MBC can be generated in a gut-microbiota-dependent manner, whereas the accumulation of plasma 2MBC and its thrombosis-aggravating effect are largely ameliorated following antibiotic-induced microbial depletion. Our study implicates 2MBC as a metabolite that links gut microbiota dysbiosis to elevated thrombotic risk, providing mechanistic insight and a potential therapeutic strategy for thrombosis.

Abstract: Summary
Atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1), combined with carboplatin and etoposide (CE), is now a standard of care for extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). A clearer understanding of therapeutically relevant SCLC subsets could identify rational combination strategies and improve outcomes. We conduct transcriptomic analyses and non-negative matrix factorization on 271 pre-treatment patient tumor samples from IMpower133 and identify four subsets with general concordance to previously reported SCLC subtypes (SCLC-A, -N, -P, and -I). Deeper investigation into the immune heterogeneity uncovers two subsets with differing neuroendocrine (NE) versus non-neuroendocrine (non-NE) phenotypes, demonstrating immune cell infiltration hallmarks. The NE tumors with low tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) but high T-effector signals demonstrate longer overall survival with PD-L1 blockade and CE versus CE alone than non-NE tumors with high TAM and high T-effector signal. Our study offers a clinically relevant approach to discriminate SCLC patients likely benefitting most from immunotherapies and highlights the complex mechanisms underlying immunotherapy responses.

Abstract: Summary
The NLRP3 inflammasome is essential for caspase-1 activation and the release of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-18, and gasdermin-D in myeloid cells. However, research on species-specific NLRP3’s physiological impact is limited. We engineer mice with the human NLRP3 gene, driven by either the human or mouse promoter, via syntenic replacement at the mouse Nlrp3 locus. Both promoters facilitate hNLRP3 expression in myeloid cells, but the mouse promoter responds more robustly to LPS. Investigating the disease impact of differential NLRP3 regulation, we introduce the D305N gain-of-function mutation into both humanized lines. Chronic inflammation is evident with both promoters; however, CNS outcomes vary significantly. Despite poor response to LPS, the human promoter results in D305N-associated aseptic meningitis, mirroring human pathology. The mouse promoter, although leading to increased CNS expression post-LPS, does not induce meningitis in D305N mutants. Therefore, human-like NLRP3 expression may be crucial for accurate modeling of its role in disease pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Adipose tissue homeostasis relies on the interplay between several regulatory lineages, such as type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), T helper 2 (Th2) cells, regulatory T cells, eosinophils, and type 2 macrophages. Among them, ILC2s are numerically the dominant source of type 2 cytokines and are considered as major regulators of adiposity. Despite the overlap in immune effector molecules and sensitivity to alarmins (thymic stromal lymphopoietin and interleukin-33) between ILC2s and resident memory Th2 lymphocytes, the role of the adaptive axis of type 2 immunity remains unclear. We show that mice deficient in CD27, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, are more resistant to obesity and associated disorders. A comparative analysis of the CD4 compartment of both strains revealed higher numbers of fat-resident memory Th2 cells in the adipose tissue of CD27 knockout mice, which correlated with decreased programmed cell death protein 1-induced apoptosis. Our data point to a non-redundant role for Th2 lymphocytes in obesogenic conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Human embryo implantation is remarkably inefficient, and implantation failure remains among the greatest obstacles in treating infertility. Gene expression data from human embryos have accumulated rapidly in recent years; however, identification of the subset of genes that determine successful implantation remains a challenge. We leverage clinical morphologic grading—known for decades to correlate with implantation potential—and transcriptome analyses of matched embryonic and abembryonic samples to identify factors and pathways enriched and depleted in human blastocysts of good and poor morphology. Unexpectedly, we discovered that the greatest difference was in the state of extraembryonic primitive endoderm (PrE) development, with relative deficiencies in poor morphology blastocysts. Our results suggest that implantation success is most strongly influenced by the embryonic compartment and that deficient PrE development is common among embryos with decreased implantation potential. Our study provides a valuable resource for those investigating the markers and mechanisms of human embryo implantation.

Abstract: Summary
The harsh climate of Arabia has posed challenges in generating ancient DNA from the region, hindering the direct examination of ancient genomes for understanding the demographic processes that shaped Arabian populations. In this study, we report whole-genome sequence data obtained from four Tylos-period individuals from Bahrain. Their genetic ancestry can be modeled as a mixture of sources from ancient Anatolia, Levant, and Iran/Caucasus, with variation between individuals suggesting population heterogeneity in Bahrain before the onset of Islam. We identify the G6PD Mediterranean mutation associated with malaria resistance in three out of four ancient Bahraini samples and estimate that it rose in frequency in Eastern Arabia from 5 to 6 kya onward, around the time agriculture appeared in the region. Our study characterizes the genetic composition of ancient Arabians, shedding light on the population history of Bahrain and demonstrating the feasibility of studies of ancient DNA in the region.

Abstract: The prevalent use of abamectin (ABM) has latterly raised safety attention as it has different toxicities to non-target living organisms. Citrus fruits are widely renowned for their nutritional and health-promoting qualities, and their peels are full of phenolic constituents. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the modulatory effectiveness of Citrus reticulata peel extract (CPE) against abamectin-induced hepatotoxicity and oxidative injury. Rats were distributed into 4 groups as follows: control, CPE (400 mg/kg bw orally for 14 days), ABM (2 mg/kg bw for 5 days), and CPE + ABM at the doses mentioned above. Results revealed that GC-MS analysis of CPE has 19 identified components with significant total phenolic and flavonoid contents. Treatment with ABM in rats displayed significant variations in enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants, oxidative stress markers (MDA, H2O2, PCC), liver and kidney function biomarkers, hematological parameters, lipids, and protein profile as well as histopathological abnormalities, inflammation and apoptosis (TNF-α, Caspase-3, NF-κB, and Bcl-2 genes) in rats’ liver. Supplementation of CPE solo dramatically improved the antioxidant state and reduced oxidative stress. C. reticulata peel extract pretreatment alleviated ABM toxicity by modulating most of the tested parameters compared to the ABM group. Conclusively, CPE had potent antioxidant activity and could be used in the modulation of ABM hepatotoxicity presumably due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and gene-regulating capabilities.

Abstract: Summary
We trapped catalytically engaged topoisomerase IIβ (TOP2B) in covalent DNA cleavage complexes (TOP2Bccs) and mapped their positions genome-wide in cultured mouse cortical neurons. We report that TOP2Bcc distribution varies with both nucleosome and compartmental chromosome organization. While TOP2Bccs in gene bodies correlate with their level of transcription, highly expressed genes that lack the usually associated chromatin marks, such as H3K36me3, show reduced TOP2Bccs, suggesting that histone posttranslational modifications regulate TOP2B activity. Promoters with high RNA polymerase II occupancy show elevated TOP2B chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing signals but low TOP2Bccs, indicating that TOP2B catalytic engagement is curtailed at active promoters. Surprisingly, either poisoning or inhibiting TOP2B increases nascent transcription at most genes and enhancers but reduces transcription within long genes. These effects are independent of transcript length and instead correlate with the presence of intragenic enhancers. Together, these results clarify how cells modulate the catalytic engagement of topoisomerases to affect transcription.

Abstract: Summary
That uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) is the sole mediator of adipocyte thermogenesis is a conventional viewpoint that has primarily been inferred from the attenuation of the thermogenic output of mice genetically lacking Ucp1 from birth (germline Ucp1−/−). However, germline Ucp1−/− mice harbor secondary changes within brown adipose tissue. To mitigate these potentially confounding ancillary changes, we constructed mice with inducible adipocyte-selective Ucp1 disruption. We find that, although germline Ucp1−/− mice succumb to cold-induced hypothermia with complete penetrance, most mice with the inducible deletion of Ucp1 maintain homeothermy in the cold. However, inducible adipocyte-selective co-deletion of Ucp1 and creatine kinase b (Ckb, an effector of UCP1-independent thermogenesis) exacerbates cold intolerance. Following UCP1 deletion or UCP1/CKB co-deletion from mature adipocytes, moderate cold exposure triggers the regeneration of mature brown adipocytes that coordinately restore UCP1 and CKB expression. Our findings suggest that thermogenic adipocytes utilize non-paralogous protein redundancy—through UCP1 and CKB—to promote cold-induced energy dissipation.

Abstract: Summary
Functional interplay between the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) and the ubiquitin system underlies the ubiquitin-dependent cargo-sorting pathway of the eukaryotic endomembrane system, yet its evolutionary origin remains unclear. Here, we show that a UEV-Vps23 protein family, which contains UEV and Vps23 domains, mediates an ancient ESCRT and ubiquitin system interplay in Asgard archaea. The UEV binds ubiquitin with high affinity, making the UEV-Vps23 a sensor for sorting ubiquitinated cargo. A steadiness box in the Vps23 domain undergoes ubiquitination through an Asgard E1, E2, and RING E3 cascade. The UEV-Vps23 switches between autoinhibited and active forms, regulating the ESCRT and ubiquitin system interplay. Furthermore, the shared sequence and structural homology among the UEV-Vps23, eukaryotic Vps23, and archaeal CdvA suggest a common evolutionary origin. Together, this work expands our understanding of the ancient ESCRT and ubiquitin system interplay that likely arose antedating divergent evolution between Asgard archaea and eukaryotes.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an inflammation-associated cancer arising from viral or non-viral etiologies including steatotic liver diseases (SLDs). Expansion of immunosuppressive myeloid cells is a hallmark of inflammation and cancer, but their heterogeneity in HCC is not fully resolved and might underlie immunotherapy resistance. Here, we present a high-resolution atlas of innate immune cells from patients with HCC that unravels an SLD-associated contexture characterized by influx of inflammatory and immunosuppressive myeloid cells, including a discrete population of THBS1+ regulatory myeloid (Mreg) cells expressing monocyte- and neutrophil-affiliated genes. THBS1+ Mreg cells expand in SLD-associated HCC, populate fibrotic lesions, and are associated with poor prognosis. THBS1+ Mreg cells are CD163+ but distinguished from macrophages by high expression of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM1), which contributes to their immunosuppressive activity and promotes HCC tumor growth in vivo. Our data support myeloid subset-targeted immunotherapies to treat HCC.

Abstract: Summary
Peptidoglycan recognition protein 1 (PGLYRP1) is a pattern-recognition protein that mediates antibacterial actions and innate immune responses. Its expression and role in neuroinflammatory conditions remain unclear. We observed the upregulation of PGLYRP1 in inflamed human and mouse spinal cord and brain, with microglia being the primary cellular source. Experiments using a recombinant PGLYRP1 protein show that PGLYRP1 potentiates reactive gliosis, neuroinflammation, and consequent behavioral changes in multiple animal models of neuroinflammation. Furthermore, shRNA-mediated knockdown of Pglyrp1 gene expression attenuates this inflammatory response. In addition, we identify triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cell-1 (TREM1) as an interaction partner of PGLYRP1 and demonstrate that PGLYRP1 promotes neuroinflammation through the TREM1-Syk-Erk1/2-Stat3 axis in cultured glial cells. Taken together, our results reveal a role for microglial PGLYRP1 as a neuroinflammation mediator. Finally, we propose that PGLYRP1 is a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in various neuroinflammatory diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The Argonaute nuclease from the thermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus (PfAgo) contributes to host defense and represents a promising biotechnology tool. Here, we report the structure of a PfAgo-guide DNA-target DNA ternary complex at the cleavage-compatible state. The ternary complex is predominantly dimerized, and the dimerization is solely mediated by PfAgo at PIWI-MID, PIWI-PIWI, and PAZ-N interfaces. Additionally, PfAgo accommodates a short 14-bp guide-target DNA duplex with a wedge-type N domain and specifically recognizes 5′-phosphorylated guide DNA. In contrast, the PfAgo-guide DNA binary complex is monomeric, and the engagement of target DNA with 14-bp complementarity induces sufficient dimerization and activation of PfAgo, accompanied by movement of PAZ and N domains. A closely related Argonaute from Thermococcus thioreducens adopts a similar dimerization configuration with an additional zinc finger formed at the dimerization interface. Dimerization of both Argonautes stabilizes the catalytic loops, highlighting the important role of Argonaute dimerization in the activation and target cleavage.
