Abstract: Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, with metastatic progression remaining the single largest cause of lung cancer mortality. Hence it is imperative to determine reliable biomarkers for lung cancer prognosis. We performed quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis to explore epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) inducers that regulate EMT process in three patients with advanced lung cancer disease. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARGC1A) was uniformly the topmost overexpressed gene in all three human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patient samples. Further evaluation in human normal lung and metastatic lung cancer cell lines revealed that the expression of PPARGC1A was upregulated in metastatic lung cancer cell lines. Metagenomic analysis revealed direct correlation among PPARGC1A, zinc-finger transcription factor snail homolog 1 (SNAI1), and metastatic lung disease. Upregulation of PPARGC1A transcript expression was independent of a differential upregulation of the upstream AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) activation or steady state expression of the silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1). Xenograft tail vein colonization assays proved that the high expression of PPARGC1A was a prerequisite for metastatic progression of lung cancer to brain. Our results indicate that PPARGC1A might be a potential biomarker for lung cancer prognosis.

Abstract: Nrf2 is presented in dendritic cells (DCs) and contributes to the maintenance of redox homeostasis. However, the expression pattern and function of Nrf2 in the maturation of DCs in the glioma-infiltrated microenvironment remain unrevealed. Our study aims to investigate the roles of Nrf2 in glioma cell-tamed DCs and their impact on the downstream T cell proliferation and cytotoxicity to glioma cells. It was showed that the inducible maturation of DCs was significantly suppressed after stimulation with tumor-conditioned medium (TCM) prepared from glioma cells (LN-18 and U118MG), as suggested by the decreased CD80, CD86 and IL-12 p70 expression and higher levels of IL-10 than the normal astrocyte medium treated DCs. Moreover, the TCM-exposed DCs had significantly increased expression and transcriptional activity of Nrf2 compared to the negative control. Nrf2 inhibition in DC cells substantially antagonized the inhibitory effects of TCM on the maturation and activation of DC cells, reflected by the elevated maturation markers and IL-12 p70. We further confirmed that Nrf2 inhibition in TCM-exposed DC cells promoted the proliferation of T cells as evaluated by the CFSE-labeled assay and Th1 response shown by the elevated production of IFN-γ. The cytotoxic T lymphocyte assay revealed that Nrf2 genetic suppression in DC cells greatly enhanced the capacity of T cells in the cytotoxicity to glioma cells dependent on the E:T ratio. Collectively, our study demonstrated that Nrf2 inhibition in DCs in glioma-exposed microenvironment could enhance the maturation of DCs and the subsequent activation of T cells and their cytotoxicity on glioma cells.

Abstract: Quiescence is a common character in stem cells. Low cellular activity in these cells may function to minimize the potential damaging effects of oxidative stress, reduce the number of cells needed for tissue replenishment, and as a consequence, perhaps occupy unique niches. Quiescent stem cells are found in many adult human tissues, the hematopoietic stem cells are paradigmatic, and more recently it appears that stem cell of the germ line in many animals display quiescence characters. Here we explore the diversity of quiescence phenotypes in primordial germ cells, leveraging the diverse mechanisms of germ cell formation to extract evolutionary significance to common processes.

Abstract: Summary
Loss of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) significantly contributes to hearing loss. Otic progenitor cell transplantation is a potential strategy to replace lost SGNs. Understanding how key transcription factors promote SGN differentiation in otic progenitors accelerates efforts for replacement therapies. A pro-neural transcription factor, Neurogenin1 (Neurog1), is essential for SGN development. Using an immortalized multipotent otic progenitor (iMOP) cell line that can self-renew and differentiate into otic neurons, NEUROG1 was enriched at the promoter of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) and neurogenic differentiation 1 (NeuroD1) genes. Changes in H3K9ac and H3K9me3 deposition at the Cdk2 and NeuroD1 promoters suggested epigenetic regulation during iMOP proliferation and differentiation. In self-renewing iMOP cells, overexpression of NEUROG1 increased CDK2 to drive proliferation, while knockdown of NEUROG1 decreased CDK2 and reduced proliferation. In iMOP-derived neurons, overexpression of NEUROG1 accelerated acquisition of neuronal morphology, while knockdown of NEUROG1 prevented differentiation. Our findings suggest that NEUROG1 can promote proliferation or neuronal differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
The FUS gene has been linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). FUS is a ubiquitous RNA-binding protein, and the mechanisms leading to selective motoneuron loss downstream of ALS-linked mutations are largely unknown. We report the transcriptome analysis of human purified motoneurons, obtained from FUS wild-type or mutant isogenic induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Gene ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes identified significant enrichment of pathways previously associated to sporadic ALS and other neurological diseases. Several microRNAs (miRNAs) were also deregulated in FUS mutant motoneurons, including miR-375, involved in motoneuron survival. We report that relevant targets of miR-375, including the neural RNA-binding protein ELAVL4 and apoptotic factors, are aberrantly increased in FUS mutant motoneurons. Characterization of transcriptome changes in the cell type primarily affected by the disease contributes to the definition of the pathogenic mechanisms of FUS-linked ALS.

Abstract: Summary
Gram-positive bacteria endow their peptidoglycan with glycopolymers that are crucial for viability and pathogenesis. However, the cellular machinery that executes this function is not well understood. While decades of genetic and phenotypic work have highlighted the LytR-CpsA-Psr (LCP) family of enzymes as cell-wall glycopolymer transferases, their in vitro characterization has been elusive, largely due to a paucity of tools for functional assays. In this report, we synthesized authentic undecaprenyl diphosphate-linked wall teichoic acid (WTA) intermediates and built an assay system capable of monitoring LCP-mediated glycopolymer transfer. We report that all Bacillus subtilis LCP enzymes anchor WTAs to peptidoglycan in vitro. Furthermore, we probed the catalytic requirements and substrate preferences for these LCP enzymes and elaborated in vitro conditions for facile tests of enzyme function. This work sheds light on the molecular features of glycopolymer transfer and aims to aid drug discovery and development programs exploiting this promising antibacterial target.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial superoxide (O2⋅−) underlies much oxidative damage and redox signaling. Fluorescent probes can detect O2⋅−, but are of limited applicability in vivo, while in cells their usefulness is constrained by side reactions and DNA intercalation. To overcome these limitations, we developed a dual-purpose mitochondrial O2⋅− probe, MitoNeoD, which can assess O2⋅− changes in vivo by mass spectrometry and in vitro by fluorescence. MitoNeoD comprises a O2⋅−-sensitive reduced phenanthridinium moiety modified to prevent DNA intercalation, as well as a carbon-deuterium bond to enhance its selectivity for O2⋅− over non-specific oxidation, and a triphenylphosphonium lipophilic cation moiety leading to the rapid accumulation within mitochondria. We demonstrated that MitoNeoD was a versatile and robust probe to assess changes in mitochondrial O2⋅− from isolated mitochondria to animal models, thus offering a way to examine the many roles of mitochondrial O2⋅− production in health and disease.

Abstract: Summary
Antibody-mediated rejection is characterized by donor-specific antibody produced by B cells. However, to our knowledge, B cell invasion and antibody in the inflamed retina after transplantation of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells has not been reported. To determine if RPE transplantation could be performed using allografts, we established in vivo immune rejection models with induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-RPE allografts and determined whether RPE-specific antibody could be detected in these models. We detected alloantibodies in the serum from recipient monkeys that had immune attacks in the retina in an immunofluorescent assay using the transplanted iPSC-RPE cells as the antigen. In addition to T cell and antigen-presenting cell immunity, peripheral blood cells and lymph nodes in animal models with allogeneic iPSC-RPE cells also had activated B cells, which were probably secreting alloantibodies. Using serum and transplanted cells, alloreactive antibody can be detected for the diagnosis of immune rejection after transplantation.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) can be generated through directed differentiation or transdifferentiation. Employing two strategies, we generated induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-HLCs and hiHeps from the same donor cell line. Both types of HLCs clustered distinctly from each other during gene expression profiling. In particular, differences existed in gene expression for phase II drug metabolism and lipid accumulation, underpinned by H3K27 acetylation status in iPSC-HLCs and hiHeps. While distinct phenotypes were achieved in vitro, both types of HLCs demonstrated similar phenotypes following transplantation into Fah-deficient mice. In conclusion, functional HLCs can be obtained from the same donor using two strategies. Global gene expression defined the differences between those populations in vitro. Importantly, both HLCs displayed partial but markedly improved hepatic function following transplantation in vivo, demonstrating plasticity and the potential for cell-based modeling in the dish and cell-based therapy in the future.

Abstract: Summary
Bone-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) differentiate into multiple lineages including chondro- and osteogenic fates and function in establishing the hematopoietic compartment of the bone marrow. Here, we analyze the emergence of different MSC types during mouse limb and long bone development. In particular, PDGFRαposSCA-1pos (PαS) cells and mouse skeletal stem cells (mSSCs) are detected within the PDGFRαposCD51pos (PαCD51) mesenchymal progenitors, which are the most abundant progenitors in early limb buds and developing long bones until birth. Long-bone-derived PαS cells and mSSCs are most prevalent in newborn mice, and molecular analysis shows that they constitute distinct progenitor populations from the earliest stages onward. Differential expression of CD90 and CD73 identifies four PαS subpopulations that display distinct chondro- and osteogenic differentiation potentials. Finally, we show that cartilage constructs generated from CD90pos PαS cells are remodeled into bone organoids encompassing functional endothelial and hematopoietic compartments, which makes these cells suited for bone tissue engineering.

Abstract: Extracellular matrix composition and stiffness are known to be critical determinants of cell behavior, modulating processes including differentiation, traction generation, and migration. Recent studies have demonstrated that the ECM composition can modulate how cells migrate in response to gradients in environmental stiffness, altering a cell's ability to undergo durotaxis. These observations were limited to single varieties of extracellular matrix, but typically cells are exposed to environments containing complex mixtures of extracellular matrix proteins. Here, we investigate migration of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts on mechanical gradients coated with one or more type of extracellular matrix protein. Our results show that NIH 3T3 fibroblasts exhibit durotaxis on fibronectin-coated mechanical gradients but not on those coated with laminin, demonstrating that extracellular matrix type can act as a regulator of cell response to mechanical gradients. Interestingly, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were also observed to migrate randomly on gradients coated with a mixture of both fibronectin and laminin, suggesting that there may be a complex interplay in the cellular response to mechanical gradients in the presence of multiple extracellular matrix signals. These findings indicate that specific composition of available adhesion ligands is a critical determinant of a cell's migratory response to mechanical gradients.

Abstract: Summary
Gene expression studies suggest that aging of the human brain is determined by a complex interplay of molecular events, although both its region- and cell-type-specific consequences remain poorly understood. Here, we extensively characterized aging-altered gene expression changes across ten human brain regions from 480 individuals ranging in age from 16 to 106 years. We show that astrocyte- and oligodendrocyte-specific genes, but not neuron-specific genes, shift their regional expression patterns upon aging, particularly in the hippocampus and substantia nigra, while the expression of microglia- and endothelial-specific genes increase in all brain regions. In line with these changes, high-resolution immunohistochemistry demonstrated decreased numbers of oligodendrocytes and of neuronal subpopulations in the aging brain cortex. Finally, glial-specific genes predict age with greater precision than neuron-specific genes, thus highlighting the need for greater mechanistic understanding of neuron-glia interactions in aging and late-life diseases.

Abstract: Kashin–Beck disease (KBD) is a chronic, endemic osteochondropathy. Its etiopathogenesis is still obscure until now. Epidemiological observation has shown that low selenium play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of KBD. Extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) and C-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) superfamily, play an important role in cell proliferation and differentiation. Nuclear factor-ĸB (NF-ĸB), an important signaling mediator for inflammatory and immune responses, is involved in the regulation of osteoclastogenesis. In the present study, we investigated the expression of ERK and JNK signal molecular, as well as nuclear factor-ĸB in the pathogenesis of Kashin-Beck disease, evaluated the effect of selenium on ERK signal pathway. The expression levels of ERK and JNK signal pathway, as well as nuclear factor-ĸB were investigated for 218 patients and 209 controls by immunoblot analysis in whole blood. Evaluated the effect of selenium on ERK signal pathway by Na2SeO3 treatment. The protein levels of pRaf-1, pMek1/2 and pErk1/2 decreased significantly in KBD patients, p-JNK and NF-ĸB increased in KBD patients. Furthermore, Na2SeO3 treatment improved the reduction of proteins in ERK signal pathway. These findings indicated that ERK and JNK signaling pathways, as well as the expression level of NF-κB signaling molecular are important contributor to the pathogenesis of KBD. Selenium stimulates the phosphorylation of the ERK signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations activating KRAS underlie many forms of cancer, but are refractory to therapeutic targeting. Here, we develop Poloppin, an inhibitor of protein-protein interactions via the Polo-box domain (PBD) of the mitotic Polo-like kinases (PLKs), in monotherapeutic and combination strategies to target mutant KRAS. Poloppin engages its targets in biochemical and cellular assays, triggering mitotic arrest with defective chromosome congression. Poloppin kills cells expressing mutant KRAS, selectively enhancing death in mitosis. PLK1 or PLK4 depletion recapitulates these cellular effects, as does PBD overexpression, corroborating Poloppin's mechanism of action. An optimized analog with favorable pharmacokinetics, Poloppin-II, is effective against KRAS-expressing cancer xenografts. Poloppin resistance develops less readily than to an ATP-competitive PLK1 inhibitor; moreover, cross-sensitivity persists. Poloppin sensitizes mutant KRAS-expressing cells to clinical inhibitors of c-MET, opening opportunities for combination therapy. Our findings exemplify the utility of small molecules modulating the protein-protein interactions of PLKs to therapeutically target mutant KRAS-expressing cancers.

Abstract: Gravity plays an important role in normal tissue maintenance. The ability of stem cells to repair tissue loss in space through regeneration and differentiation remains largely unknown. To investigate the impact of microgravity on blood vessel formation from pluripotent stem cells, we employed the embryoid body (EB) model for vasculogenesis and simulated microgravity by clinorotation. We first differentiated mouse embryonic stem cells into cystic EBs containing two germ layers and then analyzed vessel formation under clinorotation. We observed that endothelial cell differentiation was slightly reduced under clinorotation, whereas vascular branch morphogenesis was markedly enhanced. EB-derived endothelial cells migrated faster, displayed multiple cellular processes, and had higher Cdc42 and Rac1 activity when subjected to clinorotation. Genetic analysis and rescue experiments demonstrated that Cdc42 but not Rac1 is required for microgravity-induced vascular branch morphogenesis. Furthermore, affinity pull-down assay and mass spectrometry identified Rap1GDS1 to be a Cdc42 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, which was upregulated by clinorotation. shRNA-mediated knockdown of Rap1GDS1 selectively suppressed Cdc42 activation and inhibited both baseline and microgravity-induced vasculogenesis. This was rescued by ectopic expression of constitutively active Cdc42. Taken together, these results support the notion that simulated microgravity activates Cdc42 via Rap1GDS1 to promote vascular branch morphogenesis.

Abstract: The novel class of dual-family immunophilins (henceforth abbreviated as DFI) represents naturally occurring chimera of classical FK506-binding protein (FKBP) and cyclophilin (CYN), connected by a flexible linker that may include a three-unit tetratricopeptide (TPR) repeat. Here, I report a comprehensive analysis of all current DFI sequences and their host organisms. DFIs are of two kinds: CFBP (cyclosporin- and FK506-binding protein) and FCBP (FK506- and cyclosporin-binding protein), found in eukaryotes. The CFBP type occurs in select bacteria that are mostly extremophiles, such as psychrophilic, thermophilic, halophilic, and sulfur-reducing. Essentially all DFI organisms are unicellular. I suggest that DFIs are specialized bifunctional chaperones that use their flexible interdomain linker to associate with large polypeptides or multisubunit megacomplexes to promote simultaneous folding or renaturation of two clients in proximity, essential in stressful and denaturing environments. Analysis of sequence homology and predicted 3D structures of the FKBP and CYN domains as well as the TPR linkers upheld the modular nature of the DFIs and revealed the uniqueness of their TPR domain. The CFBP and FCBP genes appear to have evolved in parallel pathways with no obvious single common ancestor. The occurrence of both types of DFI in multiple unrelated phylogenetic clades supported their selection in metabolic and environmental niche roles rather than a traditional taxonomic relationship. Nonetheless, organisms with these rare immunophilins may define an operational taxonomic unit (OTU) bound by the commonality of chaperone function.

Abstract: Summary
Several groups have reported the existence of a form of pluripotency that resembles that of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), i.e., a naive state, in human pluripotent stem cells; however, the characteristics vary between reports. The nuclear receptor ESRRB is expressed in mESCs and plays a significant role in their self-renewal, but its expression has not been observed in most naive-like human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). In this study, we modified several methods for converting hiPSCs into a naive state through the transgenic expression of several reprogramming factors. The resulting cells express the components of the core transcriptional network of mESCs, including ESRRB, at high levels, which suggests the existence of naive-state hiPSCs that are similar to mESCs. We also demonstrate that these cells differentiate more readily into neural cells than do conventional hiPSCs. These features may be beneficial for their use in disease modeling and regenerative medicine.

Abstract: Summary
The pathogenesis of human Ebola virus disease (EVD) is complex. EVD is characterized by high levels of virus replication and dissemination, dysregulated immune responses, extensive virus- and host-mediated tissue damage, and disordered coagulation. To clarify how host responses contribute to EVD pathophysiology, we performed multi-platform ’omics analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma from EVD patients. Our results indicate that EVD molecular signatures overlap with those of sepsis, imply that pancreatic enzymes contribute to tissue damage in fatal EVD, and suggest that Ebola virus infection may induce aberrant neutrophils whose activity could explain hallmarks of fatal EVD. Moreover, integrated biomarker prediction identified putative biomarkers from different data platforms that differentiated survivors and fatalities early after infection. This work reveals insight into EVD pathogenesis, suggests an effective approach for biomarker identification, and provides an important community resource for further analysis of human EVD severity.

Abstract: Summary
RHOA, a founding member of the Rho GTPase family, is critical for actomyosin dynamics, polarity, and morphogenesis in response to developmental cues, mechanical stress, and inflammation. In murine small intestinal epithelium, inducible RHOA deletion causes a loss of epithelial polarity, with disrupted villi and crypt organization. In the intestinal crypts, RHOA deficiency results in reduced cell proliferation, increased apoptosis, and a loss of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) that mimic effects of radiation damage. Mechanistically, RHOA loss reduces YAP signaling of the Hippo pathway and affects YAP effector epiregulin (EREG) expression in the crypts. Expression of an active YAP (S112A) mutant rescues ISC marker expression, ISC regeneration, and ISC-associated Wnt signaling, but not defective epithelial polarity, in RhoA knockout mice, implicating YAP in RHOA-regulated ISC function. EREG treatment or active β-catenin Catnblox(ex3) mutant expression rescues the RhoA KO ISC phenotypes. Thus, RHOA controls YAP-EREG signaling to regulate intestinal homeostasis and ISC regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
miR-184 is a highly evolutionary conserved microRNA (miRNA) from fly to human. The importance of miR-184 was underscored by the discovery that point mutations in miR-184 gene led to corneal/lens blinding disease. However, miR-184-related function in vivo remained unclear. Here, we report that the miR-184 knockout mouse model displayed increased p63 expression in line with epidermal hyperplasia, while forced expression of miR-184 by stem/progenitor cells enhanced the Notch pathway and induced epidermal hypoplasia. In line, miR-184 reduced clonogenicity and accelerated differentiation of human epidermal cells. We showed that by directly repressing cytokeratin 15 (K15) and FIH1, miR-184 induces Notch activation and epidermal differentiation. The disease-causing miR-184C57U mutant failed to repress K15 and FIH1 and to induce Notch activation, suggesting a loss-of-function mechanism. Altogether, we propose that, by targeting K15 and FIH1, miR-184 regulates the transition from proliferation to early differentiation, while mis-expression or mutation in miR-184 results in impaired homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
During liver development, hepatoblasts and liver non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) such as liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) constitute the liver bud where they proliferate and differentiate. Accordingly, we reasoned that liver NPCs would support the maturation of hepatocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), which usually exhibit limited functions. We found that the transforming growth factor β and Rho signaling pathways, respectively, regulated the proliferation and maturation of LSEC and HSC progenitors isolated from mouse fetal livers. Based on these results, we have established culture systems to generate LSECs and HSCs from hiPSCs. These hiPSC-derived NPCs exhibited distinctive phenotypes and promoted self-renewal of hiPSC-derived liver progenitor cells (LPCs) over the long term in the two-dimensional culture system without exogenous cytokines and hepatic maturation of hiPSC-derived LPCs. Thus, a functional human liver model can be constructed in vitro from the LPCs, LSECs, and HSCs derived from hiPSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Chronic alcohol abuse results in alcohol-related neurodegeneration, and critical gaps in our knowledge hinder therapeutic development. Neural stem cells (NSCs) are a subpopulation of cells within the adult brain that contribute to brain maintenance and recovery. While it is known that alcohol alters NSCs, little is known about how NSC response to alcohol is related to sex, brain region, and stage of differentiation. Understanding these relationships will aid in therapeutic development. Here, we used an inducible transgenic mouse model to track the stages of differentiation of adult endogenous NSCs and observed distinct NSC behaviors in three brain regions (subventricular zone, subgranular zone, and tanycyte layer) after long-term alcohol consumption. Particularly, chronic alcohol consumption profoundly affected the survival of NSCs in the subventricular zone and altered NSC differentiation in all three regions. Significant differences between male and female mice were further discovered.

Abstract: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive pulmonary vascular disease which is associated with pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (PAEC) dysfunction and pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells proliferation. Moreover, inflammation is contributing a critical role in EC dysfunction and remains elusive. Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) is a master transcriptional regulator in various cardiovascular pathologies; but, NF-κB's role in EC dysfunction in unknown. Our previous study using cardiac and lung specific IκBα mutant mice (3M and IKBM) showed that PAH induced right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) was prevented in monocrotaline (MCT) treated 3M and IKBM mice, compared to the wild-type mice. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as a new class of post-transcriptional regulators in vascular remodeling; but, NF-κB regulated miRNA modulation in EC dysfunction is unknown. Using miRNA array analysis, we identified miR-130a which is upregulated in MCT-induced PAH mouse model, as a possible candidate to study. We showed that overexpressing miR-130a in lung microvascular endothelial cells (MVEC) promoted activation of α-smooth muscle actin, a critical component in endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition in EC remodeling. In this study, we demonstrated that bone morphogenetic protein receptor 2 (BMPR2) was a target for miR-130a and miR-130a was regulated by NF-κB which controlled apoptosis and vascular genes in MVEC. The findings reveal that NF-κB-mediated miR-130a modulation is critical in lung vascular remodeling.

Abstract: Summary
Riboswitches are structural elements found in mRNA molecules that couple small-molecule binding to regulation of gene expression, usually by controlling transcription or translation. We have determined high-resolution crystal structures of the ykkC guanidine III riboswitch from Thermobifida fusca. The riboswitch forms a classic H-type pseudoknot that includes a triple helix that is continuous with a central core of conserved nucleotides. These form a left-handed helical ramp of inter-nucleotide interactions, generating the guanidinium cation binding site. The ligand is hydrogen bonded to the Hoogsteen edges of two guanine bases. The binding pocket has a side opening that can accommodate a small side chain, shown by structures with bound methylguanidine, aminoguanidine, ethylguanidine, and agmatine. Comparison of the new structure with those of the guanidine I and II riboswitches reveals that evolution generated three different structural solutions for guanidine binding and subsequent gene regulation, although with some common elements.

Abstract: Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is an aggressive type of brainstem cancer occurring mainly in children, for which there currently is no effective therapy. Current efforts to develop novel therapeutics for this tumor make use of primary cultures of DIPG cells, maintained either as adherent monolayer in serum containing medium, or as neurospheres in serum-free medium. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that the response of DIPG cells to targeted therapies in vitro is mainly determined by the culture conditions. We show that particular culture conditions induce the activation of different receptor tyrosine kinases and signal transduction pathways, as well as major changes in gene expression profiles of DIPG cells in culture. These differences correlate strongly with the observed discrepancies in response to targeted therapies of DIPG cells cultured as either adherent monolayers or neurospheres. With this research, we provide an argument for the concurrent use of both culture conditions to avoid false positive and false negative results due to the chosen method.

Abstract: The 37kDa/67kDa laminin receptor (LRP/LR) serves various physiological and pathological roles such as enhancing tumour-related processes including metastasis, angiogenesis, cellular viability and telomerase activation in cancerous cell lines. The present study investigates the effect of siRNA mediated downregulation of LRP/LR on pancreatic cancer (AsPC-1) and neuroblastoma (IMR-32) cells. MTT and BrdU assays revealed that siRNA mediated downregulation of LRP resulted in a significant reduction in cell viability and cell proliferation. In addition, knock-down of LRP resulted in phosphatidylserine externalization, diminished nuclear integrity and significantly enhanced caspase-3 activity, which is indicative of apoptosis. LRP downregulation resulted in a significant increase in caspase-8 activity in IMR-32 cells and enhanced caspase-8 and 9 activity in AsPC-1 cells. These data recommend siRNA mediated knock-down of LRP as a potential therapeutic avenue for the treatment of pancreatic cancer and neuroblastoma.

Abstract: The heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70, human HSPA1A) plays indispensable roles in cellular stress responses and protein quality control (PQC). In the framework of PQC, it cooperates with the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) to clear damaged and dysfunctional proteins in the cell. Moreover, Hsp70 itself is rapidly degraded following the recovery from stress. It was demonstrated that its fast turnover is mediated via ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome. At the same time, the effect of Hsp70 on the functional state of proteasomes has been insufficiently investigated. Here, we characterized the direct effect of recombinant Hsp70 on the activity of 20S and 26S proteasomes and studied Hsp70 degradation by the 20S proteasome in vitro. We have shown that the activity of purified 20S proteasomes is decreased following incubation with recombinant human Hsp70. On the other hand, high concentrations of Hsp70 activated 26S proteasomes. Finally, we obtained evidence that in addition to previously reported ubiquitin-dependent degradation, Hsp70 could be cleaved independent of ubiquitination by the 20S proteasome. The results obtained reveal novel aspects of the interplay between Hsp70 and proteasomes.

Abstract: Summary
Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation) is a post-translational modification of proteins mediated by PARP family members, such as PARP-1. Although PARylation has been studied extensively, few examples of definitive biological roles for site-specific PARylation have been reported. Here we show that C/EBPβ, a key pro-adipogenic transcription factor, is PARylated by PARP-1 on three amino acids in a conserved regulatory domain. PARylation at these sites inhibits C/EBPβ’s DNA binding and transcriptional activities and attenuates adipogenesis in various genetic and cell-based models. Interestingly, PARP-1 catalytic activity drops precipitously during the first 48 hr of differentiation, corresponding to a release of C/EBPβ from PARylation-mediated inhibition. This promotes the binding of C/EBPβ at enhancers controlling the expression of adipogenic target genes and continued differentiation. Depletion or chemical inhibition of PARP-1, or mutation of the PARylation sites on C/EBPβ, enhances these early adipogenic events. Collectively, our results provide a clear example of how site-specific PARylation drives biological outcomes.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the availability of whole-genome sequences for almost all model organisms, making faithful predictions of gene expression levels based solely on the corresponding promoter sequences remains a challenge. Plasmid-based approaches and methods involving selection markers are not ideal due to copy-number fluctuations and their disruptive nature. Here, we present a genome editing method using the CRISPR/Cas9 complex and elucidate insights into the activity of canonical promoters in live yeast cells. The method involves the introduction of a novel cut site into a specific genomic location, followed by the integration of an edited sequence into the same location in a scarless manner. Using this method to edit the GAL1 and GAL80 promoter sequences, we found that the relative positioning of promoter elements was critically important for setting promoter activity levels in single cells. The method can be extended to other organisms to decode genotype-phenotype relationships in various gene networks.

Abstract: Obesity is often associated with high systemic and local activity of renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Mesenchymal stem cells of adipose tissue are the main source of adipocytes. The aim of this study was to clarify how local RAS could control adipose differentiation of human adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs). We examined the distribution of angiotensin receptor expressing cells in human adipose tissue and found that type 1 and type 2 receptors are co-expressed in its stromal compartment, which is known to contain mesenchymal stem cells. To study the expression of receptors specifically in ADSCs we have isolated them from adipose tissue. Up to 99% of cultured ADSCs expressed angiotensin II (AngII) receptor type 1 (AT1). Using the analysis of Ca2+ mobilization in single cells we found that only 5.2±2.7% of ADSCs specifically respond to serial Ang II applications via AT1 receptor and expressed this receptor constantly. This AT1const ADSCs subpopulation exhibited increased adipose competency, which was triggered by endogenous AngII. Inhibitory and expression analyses showed that AT1const ADSCs highly co-express AngII type 2 receptor (AT2), which was responsible for increased adipose competency of this ADSC subpopulation.

Abstract: In this review, we provide an up-to-date compilation of published human spermatogonial markers, with focus on the three nuclear subtypes Adark, Apale and B. In addition, we have extended our recently published list of putative spermatogonial markers with protein expression and RNA-sequencing data from the Human Protein Atlas and supported these by literature evidence. Most importantly, we have put substantial effort in acquiring a comprehensive list of new and potentially interesting markers by refiltering the raw data of 15 published germ cell expression datasets (four human, eleven rodent) and subsequent building of intersections to acquire a robust, cross-species set of spermatogonia-enriched or -specific transcripts.

Abstract: Summary
Ground-state pluripotency is a cell state in which pluripotency is established and maintained through efficient repression of endogenous differentiation pathways. Self-renewal and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are influenced by ESC-associated microRNAs (miRNAs). Here, we provide a comprehensive assessment of the “miRNome” of ESCs cultured under conditions favoring ground-state pluripotency. We found that ground-state ESCs express a distinct set of miRNAs compared with ESCs grown in serum. Interestingly, most “ground-state miRNAs” are encoded by an imprinted region on chromosome 12 within the Dlk1-Dio3 locus. Functional analysis revealed that ground-state miRNAs embedded in the Dlk1-Dio3 locus (miR-541-5p, miR-410-3p, and miR-381-3p) promoted pluripotency via inhibition of multi-lineage differentiation and stimulation of self-renewal. Overall, our results demonstrate that ground-state pluripotency is associated with a unique miRNA signature, which supports ground-state self-renewal by suppressing differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Recent studies have uncovered thousands of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in human pancreatic β cells. β cell lncRNAs are often cell type specific and exhibit dynamic regulation during differentiation or upon changing glucose concentrations. Although these features hint at a role of lncRNAs in β cell gene regulation and diabetes, the function of β cell lncRNAs remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the function of β cell-specific lncRNAs and transcription factors using transcript knockdowns and co-expression network analysis. This revealed lncRNAs that function in concert with transcription factors to regulate β cell-specific transcriptional networks. We further demonstrate that the lncRNA PLUTO affects local 3D chromatin structure and transcription of PDX1, encoding a key β cell transcription factor, and that both PLUTO and PDX1 are downregulated in islets from donors with type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance. These results implicate lncRNAs in the regulation of β cell-specific transcription factor networks.

Abstract: Interaction between islet cell subtypes and the extracellular matrix influences beta-cell function in mammals. The tissue architecture of rodent islets is very different to that of human islets; cell-to-cell communication and interaction with the extracellular matrix may vary between species. In this work, we have compared the responses of the human EndoC-βH1 cell line to non-human and human-derived growth matrices in terms of growth morphology, gene expression and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). EndoC-βH1 cells demonstrated a greater tendency to form cell clusters when cultured in a human microenvironment and exhibited reduced alpha cell markers at the mRNA level; mean expression difference − 0.23 and − 0.51; p = 0.009 and 0.002 for the Aristaless-related homeobox (ARX) and Glucagon (GCG) genes respectively. No differences were noted in the protein expression of mature beta cell markers such as Pdx1 and NeuroD1 were noted in EndoC-βH1 cells grown in a human microenvironment but cells were however more sensitive to glucose (4.3-fold increase in insulin secretion following glucose challenge compared with a 1.9-fold increase in cells grown in a non-human microenvironment; p = 0.0003). Our data suggests that the tissue origin of the cellular microenvironment has effects on the function of EndoC-βH1 cells in vitro, and the use of a more human-like culture microenvironment may bring benefits in terms of increased physiological relevance.

Abstract: Summary
The integrity of eukaryotic genomes requires rapid and regulated chromatin replication. How this is accomplished is still poorly understood. Using purified yeast replication proteins and fully chromatinized templates, we have reconstituted this process in vitro. We show that chromatin enforces DNA replication origin specificity by preventing non-specific MCM helicase loading. Helicase activation occurs efficiently in the context of chromatin, but subsequent replisome progression requires the histone chaperone FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription). The FACT-associated Nhp6 protein, the nucleosome remodelers INO80 or ISW1A, and the lysine acetyltransferases Gcn5 and Esa1 each contribute separately to maximum DNA synthesis rates. Chromatin promotes the regular priming of lagging-strand DNA synthesis by facilitating DNA polymerase α function at replication forks. Finally, nucleosomes disrupted during replication are efficiently re-assembled into regular arrays on nascent DNA. Our work defines the minimum requirements for chromatin replication in vitro and shows how multiple chromatin factors might modulate replication fork rates in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
In autoantibody-mediated diseases such as pemphigus, serum antibodies lead to disease. Genetic analysis of B cells has allowed characterization of antibody repertoires in such diseases but would be complemented by proteomic analysis of serum autoantibodies. Here, we show using proteomic analysis that the serum autoantibody repertoire in pemphigus is much more polyclonal than that found by genetic studies of B cells. In addition, many B cells encode pemphigus autoantibodies that are not secreted into the serum. Heavy chain variable gene usage of serum autoantibodies is not shared among patients, implying targeting of the coded proteins will not be a useful therapeutic strategy. Analysis of autoantibodies in individual patients over several years indicates that many antibody clones persist but the proportion of each changes. These studies indicate a dynamic and diverse autoantibody response not revealed by genetic studies and explain why similar overall autoantibody titers may give variable disease activity.

Abstract: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), characterized by excessive proliferation and apoptosis resistance of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs), is closely associated with the imbalance in vasoactive mediators and massive remodeling of pulmonary vasculature. DJ-1/park7, a multifunctional protein, plays a critical defense role in several cytobiological activity, such as transcriptional regulation, anti-oxidative stress and tumor formation. In this study, we investigated the effects of DJ-1 on hypoxia-induced PAH model rats and PASMCs, as well as its possible molecular mechanism. First, the low expressions of DJ-1 and caveolin-1 (Cav-1) were synchronously detected in lung tissue of PAH model rats and hypoxia-induced PASMCs by Western blot. Then, the DJ-1 wild type (WT) or Knock out (KO) rats were exposed to chronic hypoxia to mimic a hypoxic PAH condition. The protein level of Cav-1 was markedly decreased in the tissue of DJ-1 KO rats, and additionally lower in tissue of the hypoxia group than that in the normoxia group for DJ-1 WT and KO rats. In vivo, hemodynamic data showed that the pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP), right ventricle systolic pressure (RVSP) and pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (PASP), as well as the weight of the right ventricle/left ventricle plus septum (RV/LV+S) ratio of PAH model rats were higher in the DJ-1 KO group than those in the DJ-1 WT group. Moreover, knockout of DJ-1 also results in the phenotype switch from contractile to synthetic PASMC, which is reflected by reduced calponin and SM22α expressions. In vitro, DJ-1 overexpression reversed hypoxia-induced elevation of PASMC cell proliferation, migration and Ca2+ concentration, which were not obviously observed in Cav-1 shRNA (sh-Cav-1) and DJ-1 co-transfected cells. Then the increased levels of calponin and SM22α were detected in the DJ-1 group; similarly those levels were not changed in the DJ-1+sh-Cav-1 group. Finally, the expression of TGFβ1, p-Smad2 and p-Smad3 were obviously decreased in the ad-DJ-1 group, however those were all elevated in the DJ-1 and sh-Cav-1 co-transfected groups. In conclusion, these results indicate that DJ-1 may alleviate hypoxia-induced PASMCs injury by Cav-1 through inhibiting the TGFβ/Smad signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) and Staphylococcus aureus are part of the natural flora of humans and other mammals. We found that spent media from the CoNS species Staphylococcus caprae can inhibit agr-mediated quorum sensing by all classes of S. aureus. A biochemical assessment of the inhibitory activity suggested that the S. caprae autoinducing peptide (AIP) was responsible, and mass spectrometric analysis identified the S. caprae AIP as an eight-residue peptide (YSTCSYYF). Using a murine model of intradermal MRSA infection, the therapeutic efficacy of synthetic S. caprae AIP was evident by a dramatic reduction in both dermonecrotic injury and cutaneous bacterial burden relative to controls. Competition experiments between S. caprae and MRSA demonstrated a significant reduction in MRSA burden using murine models of both skin colonization and intradermal infection. Our findings indicate that important interactions occur between commensals that can impact disease outcomes and potentially shape the composition of the natural flora.

Abstract: Summary
A suitable source of progenitor cells is required to attenuate disease or affect cure. We present an “interrupted reprogramming” strategy to generate “induced progenitor-like (iPL) cells” using carefully timed expression of induced pluripotent stem cell reprogramming factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc; OSKM) from non-proliferative Club cells. Interrupted reprogramming allowed controlled expansion yet preservation of lineage commitment. Under clonogenic conditions, iPL cells expanded and functioned as a bronchiolar progenitor-like population to generate mature Club cells, mucin-producing goblet cells, and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-expressing ciliated epithelium. In vivo, iPL cells can repopulate CFTR-deficient epithelium. This interrupted reprogramming process could be metronomically applied to achieve controlled progenitor-like proliferation. By carefully controlling the duration of expression of OSKM, iPL cells do not become pluripotent, and they maintain their memory of origin and retain their ability to efficiently return to their original phenotype. A generic technique to produce highly specified populations may have significant implications for regenerative medicine.

Abstract: Summary
Histone deacetylase (HDAC) catalytic activity is regulated by formation of co-regulator complexes and post-translational modification. Whether these mechanisms are transformed in cancer and how this affects the binding and selectivity of HDAC inhibitors (HDACis) is unclear. In this study, we developed a method that identified a 3- to 16-fold increase in HDACi selectivity for HDAC3 in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells in comparison with luminal subtypes that was not predicted by current practice measurements with recombinant proteins. We found this increase was caused by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation of HDAC3, was independent of HDAC3 complex composition or subcellular localization, and was associated with a 5-fold increase in HDAC3 enzymatic activity. This study points to HDAC3 and the JNK axes as targets in TNBC, highlights how HDAC phosphorylation affects HDACi binding and selectivity, and outlines a method to identify changes in individual HDAC isoforms catalytic activity, applicable to any disease state.

Abstract: Summary
Interactions between the host and its microbiota are of mutual benefit and promote health. Complex molecular pathways underlie this dialog, but the identity of microbe-derived molecules that mediate the mutualistic state remains elusive. Helicobacter hepaticus is a member of the mouse intestinal microbiota that is tolerated by the host. In the absence of an intact IL-10 signaling, H. hepaticus induces an IL-23-driven inflammatory response in the intestine. Here we investigate the interactions between H. hepaticus and host immune cells that may promote mutualism, and the microbe-derived molecule(s) involved. Our results show that H. hepaticus triggers early IL-10 induction in intestinal macrophages and produces a large soluble polysaccharide that activates a specific MSK/CREB-dependent anti-inflammatory and repair gene signature via the receptor TLR2. These data identify a host-bacterial interaction that promotes mutualistic mechanisms at the intestinal interface. Further understanding of this pathway may provide novel prevention and treatment strategies for inflammatory bowel disease.

Abstract: Summary
Transplantation of rod photoreceptors, derived either from neonatal retinae or pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), can restore rod-mediated visual function in murine models of inherited blindness. However, humans depend more upon cone photoreceptors that are required for daylight, color, and high-acuity vision. Indeed, macular retinopathies involving loss of cones are leading causes of blindness. An essential step for developing stem cell-based therapies for maculopathies is the ability to generate transplantable human cones from renewable sources. Here, we report a modified 2D/3D protocol for generating hPSC-derived neural retinal vesicles with well-formed ONL-like structures containing cones and rods bearing inner segments and connecting cilia, nascent outer segments, and presynaptic structures. This differentiation system recapitulates human photoreceptor development, allowing the isolation and transplantation of a pure population of stage-matched cones. Purified human long/medium cones survive and become incorporated within the adult mouse retina, supporting the potential of photoreceptor transplantation for treating retinal degeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding molecules involved in differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells is important in advancing hPSCs for cell therapy and drug testing. Here, we report that LGR5, a leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor, plays a critical role in hPSC differentiation into cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells. LGR5 expression was transiently upregulated during the early stage of cardiomyocyte differentiation, and knockdown of LGR5 resulted in reduced expression of cardiomyocyte-associated markers and poor cardiac differentiation. In contrast, knockdown of LGR5 promoted differentiation of endothelial-like cells with increased expression of endothelial cell markers and appropriate functional characteristics, including the ability to form tube-like structures and to take up acetylated low-density lipoproteins. Furthermore, knockdown of LGR5 significantly reduced the proliferation of differentiated cells and increased the nuclear translocation of β-catenin and expression of Wnt signaling-related genes. Therefore, regulation of LGR5 may facilitate efficient generation of cardiomyocytes or endothelial cells from hPSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Loss of the tumor suppressors RB1 and TP53 and MYC amplification are frequent oncogenic events in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). We show that Myc expression cooperates with Rb1 and Trp53 loss in the mouse lung to promote aggressive, highly metastatic tumors, that are initially sensitive to chemotherapy followed by relapse, similar to human SCLC. Importantly, MYC drives a neuroendocrine-low “variant” subset of SCLC with high NEUROD1 expression corresponding to transcriptional profiles of human SCLC. Targeted drug screening reveals that SCLC with high MYC expression is vulnerable to Aurora kinase inhibition, which, combined with chemotherapy, strongly suppresses tumor progression and increases survival. These data identify molecular features for patient stratification and uncover a potential targeted treatment approach for MYC-driven SCLC.

Abstract: Summary
Human bone marrow stromal cells, or mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs), need expansion prior to use as cell-based therapies in immunological and tissue repair applications. Aging and expansion of BM-MSCs induce epigenetic changes that can impact therapeutic outcomes. By applying sequencing-based methods, we reveal that the breadth of DNA methylation dynamics associated with aging and expansion is greater than previously reported. Methylation changes are enriched at known distal transcription factor binding sites such as enhancer elements, instead of CpG-rich regions, and are associated with changes in gene expression. From this, we constructed hypo- and hypermethylation-specific regulatory networks, including a sub-network of BM-MSC master regulators and their predicted target genes, and identified putatively disrupted signaling pathways. Our genome-wide analyses provide a broader overview of age- and expansion-induced DNA methylation changes and a better understanding of the extent to which these changes alter gene expression and functionality of human BM-MSCs.

Abstract: Phytochemicals extracted from flowers, roots and bark, leaves, and other plant sources have been used extensively throughout human history with varying levels of efficacy in prevention and treatment of disease. Recently, advanced methods for characterization and clinical use of these materials have allowed modern understanding of their properties to be used as immunomodulatory agents that act by enhancement of endogenous cytoprotective mechanisms, avoiding interference with normal physiologic signaling and highly effective medical treatment with minimal adverse side effects. Simple methods have been identified for improving their biological effects, such as thermal conditioning by heating or freezing—prominent example being heat treatment of lycopene and tetrahydrocannabinol. The present investigation shows improvement of the ability of heat to augment splenocyte proliferation, natural killer (NK) cell activities, and antioxidant capacity of the flavonoid luteolin-7-O-β-glucoside (L7G) in comparison with the native (non heat-treated) molecule, while further demonstrating that both the native and the heat-treated variants exhibit comparable antioxidant properties, as evidenced by their effects in macrophages by inhibition of nitric oxide production and lysosomal enzyme activity in experiments that strengthen lysosomal membrane integrity. Outcomes of these studies suggest that heat-treated L7G shows promise for use in immunotherapy, including anti-cancer regimens, as shown by its improvement of NK cell cytotoxicity.

Abstract: Advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs) formation is correlated with the pathogenesis of diabetic neuronal damage, but its links with oxidative stress are still not well understood. Metformin, one of the most widely used anti-diabetic drugs, exerts its effects in part by activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Once activated, AMPK regulates many pathways central to metabolism and energy balance including, glucose uptake, glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation. AMPK is also present in neurons, but its role remains unclear. Here, we show that AGE exposure decreases cell viability of human neural stem cells (hNSCs), and that the AMPK agonist metformin reverses this effect, via AMPK-dependent downregulation of RAGE levels. Importantly, hNSCs co-treated with metformin were significantly rescued from AGE-induced oxidative stress, as reflected by the normalization in levels of reactive oxygen species. In addition, compared to AGE-treated hNSCs, metformin co-treatment significantly reversed the activity and mRNA transcript level changes of SOD1/2 and Gpx. Furthermore, hNSCs exposed to AGEs had significantly lower mRNA levels among other components of normal cellular oxidative defenses (GSH, Catalase and HO-1), which were all rescued by co-treatment with metformin. This metformin-mediated protective effect on hNSCs for of both oxidative stress and oxidative defense genes by co-treatment with metformin was blocked by the addition of an AMPK antagonist (Compound C). These findings unveil the protective role of AMPK-dependent metformin signaling during AGE mediated oxidative stress in hNSCs, and suggests patients undergoing AGE-mediated neurodegeneration may benefit from the novel therapeutic use of metformin.

Abstract: The kidney is an organ that plays a major role in the excretion of numerous compounds such as drugs and chemicals. However, a great number of pharmacological molecules are nephrotoxic, affecting the efficiency of the treatment and increasing morbidity or mortality. Focusing on glomerular filtration, we propose in this study a simple and reproducible in vitro human model that is able to bring to light a functional podocyte injury, correlated with morphologic/phenotypic changes after drug exposure. This model was used for the evaluation of paracellular permeability of FITC-dextran molecules as well as FITC-BSA after different treatments. Puromycin aminonucleoside and adriamycin, compounds known to induce proteinuria in vivo and that serve here as positive nephrotoxic drug controls, were able to induce an important increase in fluorescent probe passage through the cell monolayer. Different molecules were then evaluated for their potential effect on podocyte filtration. Our results demonstrated that a drug effect could be time dependent, stable or scalable and relatively specific. Immunofluorescence studies indicated that these functional perturbations were due to cytoskeletal perturbations, monolayer disassembly or could be correlated with a decrease in nephrin expression and/or ZO-1 relocation. Taken together, our results demonstrated that this in vitro human model represents an interesting tool for the screening of the renal toxicity of drugs.

Abstract: Summary
Acetyl-CoA is a key metabolic intermediate with an important role in transcriptional regulation. The nuclear-cytosolic acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2) was found to sustain the growth of hypoxic tumor cells. It generates acetyl-CoA from acetate, but exactly which pathways it supports is not fully understood. Here, quantitative analysis of acetate metabolism reveals that ACSS2 fulfills distinct functions depending on its cellular location. Exogenous acetate uptake is controlled by expression of both ACSS2 and the mitochondrial ACSS1, and ACSS2 supports lipogenesis. The mitochondrial and lipogenic demand for two-carbon acetyl units considerably exceeds the uptake of exogenous acetate, leaving it to only sparingly contribute to histone acetylation. Surprisingly, oxygen and serum limitation increase nuclear localization of ACSS2. We find that nuclear ACSS2 recaptures acetate released from histone deacetylation for recycling by histone acetyltransferases. Our work provides evidence for limited equilibration between nuclear and cytosolic acetyl-CoA and demonstrates that ACSS2 retains acetate to maintain histone acetylation.

Abstract: Pluripotent stem cell activity is essential to maintain regeneration and homeostasis in the Drosophila midgut following environmental challenges. Although multiple pathways have been implicated in epithelial renewal, the underlying regulatory mechanisms and correlations between relevant genes and pathways remain elusive. In this study, we show that the zinc finger protein CG12744 plays an important role in the differentiation and regeneration of epithelial cells in response to oral infection with Erwinia carotovora carotovora 15. Knocking down CG12744 in enteroblasts decreased the post-infection proportion of enteroblasts and enterocytes and increased the post-infection number of enteroendocrine cells. In addition, in precursors, CG12744 affected the Osa, jun-N-terminal kinase and bone morphogenetic protein signaling pathways to control enterocyte differentiation. Finally, CG12744 maintained epithelial architecture and cell fate in enterocytes following an acute infectious challenge.

Abstract: Neoadjuvant (or induction) chemotherapy can be used for cervical cancer patients with locally advanced disease; this treatment is followed by radical surgery and/or radiation therapy. Cisplatin is considered to be the most active platinum agent drug for this cancer, with a response rate of 20%. In order to understand how the cisplatin treatment affects the stress response, in this work, we performed an exploratory study to analyze a number of stress proteins before and after cisplatin neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The study involved 14 patients; the pre- and post-chemotherapy paired biopsies were examined by hematoxylin and eosin staining and by immunohistochemistry. The proteins evaluated were p53, P16/INK4A, MSH2, nuclear protein transcriptional regulator 1 (NUPR1), and HSPB1 (total: HSPB1/t and phosphorylated: HSPB1/p). These proteins were selected because there is previous evidence of their relationship with drug resistance. The formation of platinum-DNA adducts was also studied. There was a great variation in the expression levels of the mentioned proteins in the pre-chemotherapy biopsies. After chemotherapy, p53 was not significantly affected by cisplatin, as well as P16/INK4A and MSH2 while nuclear NUPR1 content tended to decrease (p = 0.056). Cytoplasmic HSPB1/t expression levels decreased significantly following cisplatin therapy while nuclear HSPB1/t and HSPB1/p tended to increase. Since the most significant changes following chemotherapy appeared in the HSPB1 expression levels, the changes were confirmed by Western blot. The platinum-DNA adducts were observed in HeLa cell in apoptosis; however, in the tumor samples, the platinum-DNA adducts were observed in morphologically healthy tumor cells; these cells displayed nuclear HSPB1/p. Further mechanistic studies should be performed to reveal how HSPB1/p is related with drug resistance. When the correlations of the markers with the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy were examined, only high pre-chemotherapy levels of cytoplasmic HSPB1/p correlated with a poor clinical and pathological response to neoadjuvant cisplatin chemotherapy (p = 0.056) suggesting that this marker could be useful opening its study in a larger number of cases.

Abstract: Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling is necessary for a health adipose tissue (AT) expansion and also has a role during weight loss. We investigate the ECM alteration during weight cycling (WC) in mice and the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) was assessed using GM6001, an MMP inhibitor, during weight loss (WL). Obesity was induced in mice by a high-fat diet. Obese mice were subject to caloric restriction for WL followed by reintroduction to high-fat diet for weight regain (WR), resulting in a WC protocol. In addition, mice were treated with GM6001 during WL period and the effects were observed after WR. Activity and expression of MMPs was intense during WL. MMP inhibition during WL results in inflammation and collagen content reduction. MMP inhibition during WL period interferes with the period of subsequent expansion of AT resulting in improvements in local inflammation and systemic metabolic alterations induced by obesity. Our results suggest that MMPs inhibition could be an interesting target to improve adipose tissue inflammation during WL and to support weight cyclers.

Abstract: Summary
Diseases at the molecular level are complex and patient dependent, necessitating development of strategies that enable precision treatment to optimize clinical outcomes. Organoid technology has recently been shown to have the potential to recapitulate the in vivo characteristics of the original individual’s tissue in a three-dimensional in vitro culture system. Here, we present a quantitative mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analysis and a comparative transcriptomic analysis of human colorectal tumor and healthy organoids derived, in parallel, from seven patients. Although gene and protein signatures can be derived to distinguish the tumor organoid population from healthy organoids, our data clearly reveal that each patient possesses a distinct organoid signature at the proteomic level. We demonstrate that a personalized patient-specific organoid proteome profile can be related to the diagnosis of a patient and with future development contribute to the generation of personalized therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Rab small GTPases control membrane trafficking through effectors that recruit downstream mediators such as motor proteins. Subcellular trafficking typically involves multiple Rabs, with each specific step mediated by a distinct Rab protein. We describe a collaboration between two distinct Rab-protein-orchestrated trafficking circuits in bladder epithelial cells (BECs) that expels intracellular uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) from their intracellular niche. RAB11a and RAB27b and their trafficking circuitry are simultaneously involved in UPEC expulsion. While RAB11a recruits its effector RAB11FIP3 and cytoskeletal motor Dynein, RAB27b mobilizes the effector MyRIP and motor Myosin VIIa to mediate bacterial expulsion. This collaboration is coordinated by deposition of the exocyst complex on bacteria-containing vesicles, an event triggered by the innate receptor Toll-like receptor 4. Both RAB11a and RAB27b are recruited and activated by the exocyst complex components SEC6/SEC15. Thus, the cell autonomous defense system can mobilize and coalesce multiple subcellular trafficking circuitries to combat infections.

Abstract: Summary
High-purity cardiomyocytes (CMs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are promising for drug development and myocardial regeneration. However, most hiPSC-derived CMs morphologically and functionally resemble immature rather than adult CMs, which could hamper their application. Here, we obtained high-quality cardiac tissue-like constructs (CTLCs) by cultivating hiPSC-CMs on low-thickness aligned nanofibers made of biodegradable poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) polymer. We show that multilayered and elongated CMs could be organized at high density along aligned nanofibers in a simple one-step seeding process, resulting in upregulated cardiac biomarkers and enhanced cardiac functions. When used for drug assessment, CTLCs were much more robust than the 2D conventional control. We also demonstrated the potential of CTLCs for modeling engraftments in vitro and treating myocardial infarction in vivo. Thus, we established a handy framework for cardiac tissue engineering, which holds high potential for pharmaceutical and clinical applications.

Abstract: Summary
Microglia play key roles in brain development, homeostasis, and function, and it is widely assumed that the adult population is long lived and maintained by self-renewal. However, the precise temporal and spatial dynamics of the microglial population are unknown. We show in mice and humans that the turnover of microglia is remarkably fast, allowing the whole population to be renewed several times during a lifetime. The number of microglial cells remains steady from late postnatal stages until aging and is maintained by the spatial and temporal coupling of proliferation and apoptosis, as shown by pulse-chase studies, chronic in vivo imaging of microglia, and the use of mouse models of dysregulated apoptosis. Our results reveal that the microglial population is constantly and rapidly remodeled, expanding our understanding of its role in the maintenance of brain homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Our ultimate goal of in vitro derivation of Schwann cells (SCs) from adult bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) is such that they may be used autologously to assist post-traumatic nerve regeneration. Existing protocols for derivation of SC-like cells from BMSCs fall short in the stability of the acquired phenotype and the functional capacity to myelinate axons. Our experiments indicated that neuro-ectodermal progenitor cells among the human hBMSCs could be selectively expanded and then induced to differentiate into SC-like cells. Co-culture of the SC-like cells with embryonic dorsal root ganglion neurons facilitated contact-mediated signaling that accomplished the switch to fate-committed SCs. Microarray analysis and in vitro myelination provided evidence that the human BMSC-derived SCs were functionally mature. This was reinforced by repair and myelination phenotypes observable in vivo with the derived SCs seeded into a nerve guide as an implant across a critical gap in a rat model of sciatic nerve injury.

Abstract: Summary
Bactericidal antibiotics alter microbial metabolism as part of their lethality and can damage mitochondria in mammalian cells. In addition, antibiotic susceptibility is sensitive to extracellular metabolites, but it remains unknown whether metabolites present at an infection site can affect either treatment efficacy or immune function. Here, we quantify local metabolic changes in the host microenvironment following antibiotic treatment for a peritoneal Escherichia coli infection. Antibiotic treatment elicits microbiome-independent changes in local metabolites, but not those distal to the infection site, by acting directly on host cells. The metabolites induced during treatment, such as AMP, reduce antibiotic efficacy and enhance phagocytic killing. Moreover, antibiotic treatment impairs immune function by inhibiting respiratory activity in immune cells. Collectively, these results highlight the immunomodulatory potential of antibiotics and reveal the local metabolic microenvironment to be an important determinant of infection resolution.

Abstract: Summary
In late mitosis and G1, origins of DNA replication must be “licensed” for use in the upcoming S phase by being encircled by double hexamers of the minichromosome maintenance proteins MCM2–7. A “licensing checkpoint” delays cells in G1 until sufficient origins have been licensed, but this checkpoint is lost in cancer cells. Inhibition of licensing can therefore kill cancer cells while only delaying normal cells in G1. In a high-throughput cell-based screen for licensing inhibitors we identified a family of 2-arylquinolin-4-amines, the most potent of which we call RL5a. The binding of the origin recognition complex (ORC) to origin DNA is the first step of the licensing reaction. We show that RL5a prevents ORC forming a tight complex with DNA that is required for MCM2–7 loading. Formation of this ORC-DNA complex requires ATP, and we show that RL5a inhibits ORC allosterically to mimic a lack of ATP.

Abstract: Summary
The dynamics of epithelial stem cells (SCs) that contribute to the formation and maintenance of the cornea are poorly understood. Here, we used K14CreERT2-Confetti (Confetti) mice, sophisticated imaging, and computational modeling to trace the origins and fate of these cells during embryogenesis and adult life. We show that keratin-14 (K14+)-expressing progenitors are defined and widely distributed across the E16.5 cornea, after which they undergo cycles of proliferation and dispersal prior to eyelid opening. K14+ clonal patches disappear from the central cornea and are replaced by limbal-derived K14+ streaks, a finding that aligned with bromodeoxyuridine label-retaining studies. We also elucidated the mechanism by which SC clones are lost during life and propose this is due to population asymmetry and neutral drift. Finally, we established that the occurrence of an equatorial migratory mid-line is a consequence of apoptosis in a narrow nasal-temporal region, the site where eyelids meet during blinking.

Abstract: The pathological progression of osteoarthritis (OA) involves degradation of articular cartilage matrix. Type II collagen is the main component of cartilage matrix, which is degraded by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β mediated by MMP-13. Nebivolol, a licensed drug used for the treatment of hypertension in clinics, displays its anti-inflammatory capacity in various conditions. However, whether Nebivolol has a protective effect on cartilage matrix degradation has not been reported before. In this study, we investigated the effects of Nebivolol on regulating the expression of MMP-13 and degradation of type II collagen. Our results indicate that Nebivolol alleviated the increase in gene expression, protein expression, and activity of MMP-13 induced by IL-1β. Importantly, IL-1β strikingly reduced the levels of type II collagen in cell culture supernatants, which was reversed by treatment with Nebivolol in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanistically, Nebivolol was found to alleviate the increased levels of phosphorylated IκBα and reduced levels of total IκBα induced by IL-1β, which subsequently mitigated p65 nuclear translocation and the transcriptional activity of NF-κB. Furthermore, our results indicated that IL-1β treatment resulted in a significant increase in expression of the transcriptional factor interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) at both the mRNA and protein levels, which was significantly ameliorated by treatment with Nebivolol. The combination of these findings suggests that Nebivolol can potentially be applied in human OA treatment.

Abstract: Stem cell therapy is considered a promising approach in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) seem to be the most effective in ALS animal models. The umbilical cord (UC) is a source of highly proliferating fetal MSCs, more easily collectable than other MSCs. Recently we demonstrated that human (h) UC-MSCs, double labeled with fluorescent nanoparticles and Hoechst-33258 and transplanted intracerebroventricularly (ICV) into SOD1G93A transgenic mice, partially migrated into the spinal cord after a single injection. This prompted us to assess the effect of repeated ICV injections of hUC-MSCs on disease progression in SOD1G93A mice. Although no transplanted cells migrated to the spinal cord, a partial but significant protection of motor neurons (MNs) was found in the lumbar spinal cord of hUC-MSCs-treated SOD1G93A mice, accompanied by a shift from a pro-inflammatory (IL-6, IL-1β) to anti-inflammatory (IL-4, IL-10) and neuroprotective (IGF-1) environment in the lumbar spinal cord, probably linked to the activation of p-Akt survival pathway in both motor neurons and reactive astrocytes. However, this treatment neither prevented the muscle denervation nor delayed the disease progression of mice, emphasizing the growing evidence that protecting the motor neuron perikarya is not sufficient to delay the ALS progression.

Abstract: Organisms’ reactions to adverse events result in the generation of immune effectors, which, in the case of insects, may be produced from the direct activation of pathways such as Toll, Jak-STAT, Imd, or RNAi or may be derived from the crosstalk of different intracellular pathways. One such pathway, the unfolded protein response (UPR), has the primary objective of restoring homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum. In addition, the UPR participates in signaling crosstalk with the immune pathways, generating protection against pathogenic organisms. Dengue virus is a plus-strand RNA virus belonging to the Flavivirus genus that uses the ER as a replication site; during the infection, there are indicators of the activation of the UPR, which in turn, induces the synthesis of internal membranes and preferential translation of viral proteins enhancing the replication. One of the dengue virus proteins, the NS4B can block the pathway of α/β interferon in mammals. However, what happen in insects is interesting because the lack of the main antiviral pathway, the interferon and the role of the NS4B protein in the UPR-immunity relationship can be better understood. Thus, in this study, we demonstrated that the DENV2/16681 NS4B protein is capable of modulating the immune effectors that result from the activation of the UPR in insect cells.

Abstract: Summary
Accurately predicting cardioactive effects of new molecular entities for therapeutics remains a daunting challenge. Immense research effort has been focused toward creating new screening platforms that utilize human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes and three-dimensional engineered cardiac tissue constructs to better recapitulate human heart function and drug responses. As these new platforms become increasingly sophisticated and high throughput, the drug screens result in larger multidimensional datasets. Improved automated analysis methods must therefore be developed in parallel to fully comprehend the cellular response across a multidimensional parameter space. Here, we describe the use of machine learning to comprehensively analyze 17 functional parameters derived from force readouts of hPSC-derived ventricular cardiac tissue strips (hvCTS) electrically paced at a range of frequencies and exposed to a library of compounds. A generated metric is effective for then determining the cardioactivity of a given drug. Furthermore, we demonstrate a classification model that can automatically predict the mechanistic action of an unknown cardioactive drug.

Abstract: Stress-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis contributes to the pathogenesis of a variety of cardiovascular diseases, but how stress induces cardiomyocyte apoptosis remains largely unclear. The present study aims to investigate the effects of Axin1 up-regulated 1 (Axud1), a novel pro-apoptotic protein, on the cardiomyocyte survival and the underlying mechanisms. To this end, a rat model under restraint stress (RS) was established and in vitro stress-induced cardiomyocytes culture was achieved. Our data showed that Axud1 was upregulated in the rat myocardia after exposure to RS. Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 was decreased, whereas pro-apoptotic Bax and Cleaved caspase-3 (Cc3) were increased in a time-dependent manner. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling was observed to be interestingly activated in heart undergoing RS. In addition, the treatment of norepinephrine (NE) to in vitro cardiomyocytes increased Axud1 level and induced cell apoptosis. Wnt/β-catenin signaling was consistently activated. Knockdown of Axud1 using specific siRNA blunted NE-induced cardiomyocytes apoptosis and also inactivated the Wnt/β-catenin signaling. XAV-939, an inhibitor of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, partially reversed the pro-apoptotic effect of NE. In conclusion, Axud1 accelerated stress-induced cardiomyocytes apoptosis through activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Our data provided novel evidence that therapeutic strategies against Axud1 or Wnt/β-catenin signaling might be promising in relation to RS-induced myocardial injury.

Abstract: Summary
Brain swelling is a major predictor of mortality in pediatric cerebral malaria (CM). However, the mechanisms leading to swelling remain poorly defined. Here, we combined neuroimaging, parasite transcript profiling, and laboratory blood profiles to develop machine-learning models of malarial retinopathy and brain swelling. We found that parasite var transcripts encoding endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR)-binding domains, in combination with high parasite biomass and low platelet levels, are strong indicators of CM cases with malarial retinopathy. Swelling cases presented low platelet levels and increased transcript abundance of parasite PfEMP1 DC8 and group A EPCR-binding domains. Remarkably, the dominant transcript in 50% of swelling cases encoded PfEMP1 group A CIDRα1.7 domains. Furthermore, a recombinant CIDRα1.7 domain from a pediatric CM brain autopsy inhibited the barrier-protective properties of EPCR in human brain endothelial cells in vitro. Together, these findings suggest a detrimental role for EPCR-binding CIDRα1 domains in brain swelling.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) exhibit broad immune modulatory activity in vivo and can suppress T cell proliferation and dendritic cell activation in vitro. Currently, most MSC for clinical usage are derived from younger donors, due to ease of procurement and to the superior immune modulatory activity. However, the use of MSC from multiple unrelated donors makes it difficult to standardize study results and compare outcomes between different clinical trials. One solution is the use of MSC derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC); as iPSC-derived MSC have nearly unlimited proliferative potential and exhibit in vitro phenotypic stability. Given the value of dogs as a spontaneous disease model for pre-clinical evaluation of stem cell therapeutics, we investigated the functional properties of canine iPSC-derived MSC (iMSC), including immune modulatory properties and potential for teratoma formation. We found that canine iMSC downregulated expression of pluripotency genes and appeared morphologically similar to conventional MSC. Importantly, iMSC retained a stable phenotype after multiple passages, did not form teratomas in immune deficient mice, and did not induce tumor formation in dogs following systemic injection. We concluded therefore that iMSC were phenotypically stable, immunologically potent, safe with respect to tumor formation, and represented an important new source of cells for therapeutic modulation of inflammatory disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in FOXP1 have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders including intellectual disability and autism; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain ill-defined. Here, we demonstrate with RNA and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing that FOXP1 directly regulates genes controlling neurogenesis. We show that FOXP1 is expressed in embryonic neural stem cells (NSCs), and modulation of FOXP1 expression affects both neuron and astrocyte differentiation. Using a murine model of cortical development, FOXP1-knockdown in utero was found to reduce NSC differentiation and migration during corticogenesis. Furthermore, transplantation of FOXP1-knockdown NSCs in neonatal mice after hypoxia-ischemia challenge demonstrated that FOXP1 is also required for neuronal differentiation and functionality in vivo. FOXP1 was found to repress the expression of Notch pathway genes including the Notch-ligand Jagged1, resulting in inhibition of Notch signaling. Finally, blockade of Jagged1 in FOXP1-knockdown NSCs rescued neuronal differentiation in vitro. Together, these data support a role for FOXP1 in regulating embryonic NSC differentiation by modulating Notch signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Most plant bacterial pathogens rely on type III effectors to cause diseases. Although it is well known that the plant hormone salicylic acid (SA) plays an essential role in defense, whether the master regulator of SA signaling, NPR1, is targeted by any plant pathogen effectors is unknown. SA facilitates the reduction of cytosolic NPR1 oligomers into monomers, which enter the nucleus and function as transcriptional coactivators of plant defense genes. We show that SA promotes the interaction between the Pseudomonas syringae type III effector AvrPtoB and NPR1. In the presence of SA, AvrPtoB mediates the degradation of NPR1 via the host 26S proteasome in a manner dependent on AvrPtoB's E3 ligase activity. Intriguingly, we found that NPR1 plays an important role in MAMP-triggered immunity (MTI), inducing the expression of MTI marker genes. Thus, this work uncovers a strategy in which AvrPtoB targets NPR1 and represses NPR1-dependent SA signaling, thereby subverting plant innate immunity.

Abstract: Summary
During gastrulation, the neuroectoderm cells form the neural tube and neural crest. The nervous system contains significantly more microRNAs than other tissues, but the role of microRNAs in controlling the differentiation of neuroectodermal cells into neural tube epithelial (NTE) cells and neural crest cells (NCCs) remains unknown. Using embryonic stem cell (ESC) neural differentiation systems, we found that miR-29b was upregulated in NTE cells and downregulated in NCCs. MiR-29b promoted the differentiation of ESCs into NTE cells and inhibited their differentiation into NCCs. Accordingly, the inhibition of miR-29b significantly inhibited the differentiation of NTE cells. A mechanistic study revealed that miR-29b targets DNA methyltransferase 3a (Dnmt3a) to regulate neural differentiation. Moreover, miR-29b mediated the function of Pou3f1, a critical neural transcription factor. Therefore, our study showed that the Pou3f1-miR-29b-Dnmt3a regulatory axis was active at the initial stage of neural differentiation and regulated the determination of cell fate.

Abstract: Summary
Staphylococcus aureus commonly colonizes the epidermis, but the mechanisms by which the host senses virulent, but not commensal, S. aureus to trigger inflammation remain unclear. Using a murine epicutaneous infection model, we found that S. aureus-expressed phenol-soluble modulin (PSM)α, a group of secreted virulence peptides, is required to trigger cutaneous inflammation. PSMα induces the release of keratinocyte IL-1α and IL-36α, and signaling via IL-1R and IL-36R was required for induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-17. The levels of released IL-1α and IL-36α, as well as IL-17 production by γδ T cells and ILC3 and neutrophil infiltration to the site of infection, were greatly reduced in mice with total or keratinocyte-specific deletion of the IL-1R and IL-36R signaling adaptor Myd88. Further, Il17a−/−f−/− mice showed blunted S. aureus-induced inflammation. Thus, keratinocyte Myd88 signaling in response to S. aureus PSMα drives an IL-17-mediated skin inflammatory response to epicutaneous S. aureus infection.

Abstract: Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease severely affecting patients’ physical and psychological well-being. Aberrant keratin expression in psoriasis plays a crucial role in keratinocyte dysfunction and disease development. Little is yet known about the mechanism of this keratin dysregulation. VEGF (Vascular endothelial growth factor) is significantly elevated in psoriatic patients and VEGFRs are detected on keratinocytes, leading to our hypothesis that this keratin dysregulation may be regulated by VEGF. In this study, we showed that VEGFR2 was overexpressed in psoriatic epidermis and was correlated with K (keratin) 6, K16&K17 upregulation and K1&K10 downregulation. VEGF increased both mRNA and protein levels of K6, K16&K17 and decreased those of K1&K10 in NHEKs (normal human epidermal keratinocytes). Further we identified activation of STAT3, ERK1/2, and p38 pathways in VEGF-treated NHEKs. Using specific pathway antagonists and siRNAs we found that VEGF induced K6, K16&K17 via these three pathways and reduced K1&K10 via ERK1/2. Finally, VEGF-induced aberrant keratin expression pattern and epidermal thickening were confirmed in a VEGF-local-injection mouse model. Collectively, we demonstrated that VEGF was associated with aberrant keratin expression pattern in psoriasis and provided a new insight into the role of VEGF in psoriasis pathogenesis, indicating VEGF as a potential therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
Viruses accomplish their replication by exploiting many cellular resources, including metabolites and energy. Similarly to other (+)RNA viruses, tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) induces major changes in infected cells. However, the source of energy required to fuel TBSV replication is unknown. We find that TBSV co-opts the cellular glycolytic ATP-generating pyruvate kinase (PK) directly into the viral replicase complex to boost progeny RNA synthesis. The co-opted PK generates high levels of ATP within the viral replication compartment at the expense of a reduction in cytosolic ATP pools. The ATP generated by the co-opted PK is used to promote the helicase activity of recruited cellular DEAD-box helicases, which are involved in the production of excess viral (+)RNA progeny. Altogether, recruitment of PK and local production of ATP within the replication compartment allow the virus replication machinery an access to plentiful ATP, facilitating robust virus replication.

Abstract: Summary
Repopulation of brain circuits by neural precursors is a potential therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative disorders; however, choice of cell is critical. Previously, we introduced a two-step culture system that generates a high yield of neural precursors from small samples of adult canine skin. Here, we probe their gene and protein expression profiles in comparison with dermal fibroblasts and brain-derived neural stem cells and characterize their neuronal potential. To date, we have produced >50 skin-derived neural precursor (SKN) lines. SKNs can be cultured in a highly replicable fashion and uniformly express a panel of identifying markers. Upon differentiation, they self-upregulate neural specification genes, generating neurons with basic electrophysiological functionality. This unique population of neural precursors, derived from mature skin, overcomes many of the practical issues that have limited clinical translation of alternative cell types. Easily accessible, neuronally committed, and patient specific, SKNs may have potential for the treatment of brain disorders.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem-cell based therapies have been proposed as novel treatments for intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration. The development of these treatment strategies, however, has been hindered by the incomplete understanding of the origin, biological properties of nucleus pulposus (NP) derived stem/progenitor cells and their effects on the IVD degeneration. The goal of this study is to explore the biological properties of NP stem/progenitor cells isolated from degenerated IVD (D-NPMSCs) regarding immunotype, proliferative capacity, multi-lineage differentiation abilities, and the expression of NP specific cell surface markers compared to human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs). Our results indicate that although D-NPMSCs shared the mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) characteristics with UCMSCs, significant differences exist in phenotype signatures and biological capacities between D-NPMSCs and UCMSCs. D-NPMSCs expressed lower expression levels of CD29 and CD105, the phenotype markers of MSCs, and exhibited reduced proliferation capability and differentiation potentials, which might account for the distinct NP microenvironment and the poor capacity for disc regeneration. This study will lay a foundation for further understanding the mechanism of stem cell-based therapy for IVD degeneration.

Abstract: The expression of p63 in surface ectodermal cells during development of the cornea, skin, oral mucosa and olfactory placodes is integral to the process of cellular self-renewal and the maintenance of the epithelial stem cell status. Here, we used TALEN technology to generate a p63 knock-in (KI) human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cell line in which p63 expression can be visualized via enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression. The KI-hiPS cells maintained pluripotency and expressed the stem cell marker gene, ΔNp63α. They were also able to successfully differentiate into functional corneal epithelial cells as assessed by p63 expression in reconstructed corneal epithelium. This approach enables the tracing of p63-expressing cell lineages throughout epithelial development, and represents a promising application in the field of stem cell research.

Abstract: Summary
The unprecedented 2013–2016 outbreak of Ebola virus (EBOV) resulted in over 11,300 human deaths. Host resistance to RNA viruses requires RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling through the adaptor protein, mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), but the role of RLR-MAVS in orchestrating anti-EBOV responses in vivo is not known. Here we apply a systems approach to MAVS−/− mice infected with either wild-type or mouse-adapted EBOV. MAVS controlled EBOV replication through the expression of IFNα, regulation of inflammatory responses in the spleen, and prevention of cell death in the liver, with macrophages implicated as a major cell type influencing host resistance. A dominant role for RLR signaling in macrophages was confirmed following conditional MAVS deletion in LysM+ myeloid cells. These findings reveal tissue-specific MAVS-dependent transcriptional pathways associated with resistance to EBOV, and they demonstrate that EBOV adaptation to cause disease in mice involves changes in two distinct events, RLR-MAVS antagonism and suppression of RLR-independent IFN-I responses.

Abstract: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) polarization represents a key regulatory process of tumor progression. However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) and TAMs in lung adenocarcinoma cells. THP-1 monocytes were differentiated into macrophages using PMA. PMA-treated THP-1 cells were co-cultured with human A549 cells culture supernatant. SPP1 expression in TAMs isolated from lung adenocarcinoma tissues and PMA-treated THP-1 cells were measured. Macrophage polarization was identified by flow cytometric analysis. Cell migration and apoptosis were assessed by Transwell migration assays and flow cytometric analysis, respectively. SPP1 is highly expressed in tumor tissues and TAMs isolated from patients with an advanced TNM stage, and also in PMA-treated THP-1 cells. Co-culture with A549 cells strongly induced SPP-1 expression as well as M2 polarization of THP-1 cells, but it had little effect on short hairpin SPP1 (shSPP1)-transfected THP-1 cells. Interestingly, programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), a critical regulator of M2 polarization, was downregulated in SPP1 knockdown THP-1 cells. Inhibition of PD-L1 induced a greater decline of the M2 markers IL-10 and Arg-1 but an increase in the M1 markers IL-12 and TNF-α. In addition, SPP1 knockdown in THP-1 cells can mitigate migration but promote apoptosis of A549 cells, and PD-L1 inhibition can further enhance this effect. THP-1 cells co-cultured with A549 cells attenuated CD4+ T-cell activation, whereas SPP1 inhibition restored T-cell activation. These results highlight the importance of SPP1 in mediating macrophage polarization and lung cancer evasion, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for lung cancer.

Abstract: The class Ia anti-arrhythmic drug ajmaline is used clinically to unmask latent type I ECG in Brugada syndrome (BrS) patients, although its mode of action is poorly characterised. Our aims were to identify ajmaline's mode of action in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes (CMs), and establish a simple BrS hiPSC platform to test whether differences in ajmaline response could be determined between BrS patients and controls. Control hiPSCs were differentiated into spontaneously contracting cardiac clusters. It was found using multi electrode array (MEA) that ajmaline treatment significantly lengthened cluster activation-recovery interval. Patch clamping of single CMs isolated from clusters revealed that ajmaline can block both INa and IKr. Following generation of hiPSC lines from BrS patients (absent of pathogenic SCN5A sodium channel mutations), analysis of hiPSC-CMs from patients and controls revealed that differentiation and action potential parameters were similar. Comparison of cardiac clusters by MEA showed that ajmaline lengthened activation-recovery interval consistently across all lines. We conclude that ajmaline can block both depolarisation and repolarisation of hiPSC-CMs at the cellular level, but that a more refined integrated tissue model may be necessary to elicit differences in its effect between BrS patients and controls.

Abstract: Summary
Development of safe and effective stem cell-based therapies for brain repair requires an in-depth understanding of the in vivo properties of neural grafts generated from human stem cells. Replacing dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease remains one of the most anticipated applications. Here, we have used a human PITX3-EGFP embryonic stem cell line to characterize the connectivity of stem cell-derived midbrain dopamine neurons in the dopamine-depleted host brain with an unprecedented level of specificity. The results show that the major A9 and A10 subclasses of implanted dopamine neurons innervate multiple, developmentally appropriate host targets but also that the majority of graft-derived connectivity is non-dopaminergic. These findings highlight the promise of stem cell-based procedures for anatomically correct reconstruction of specific neuronal pathways but also emphasize the scope for further refinement in order to limit the inclusion of uncharacterized and potentially unwanted cell types.

Abstract: Summary
The interaction between oxysterols and the G protein-coupled receptor Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 2 (EBI2) fine-tunes immune cell migration, a mechanism efficiently targeted by several disease-modifying treatments developed to treat multiple sclerosis (MS), such as natalizumab. We previously showed that memory CD4+ T lymphocytes migrate specifically in response to 7α,25-dihydroxycholesterol (7α,25-OHC) via EBI2 in the MS murine model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. However, the EBI2 expression profile in human lymphocytes in both healthy and MS donors is unknown. Here, we characterize EBI2 biology in human lymphocytes. We observed that EBI2 is functionally expressed on memory CD4+ T cells and is enhanced under natalizumab treatment. These data suggest a significant role for EBI2 in human CD4+ T cell migration, notably in patients with MS. Better knowledge of EBI2 involvement in autoimmunity may therefore lead to an improved understanding of the physiopathology of MS.

Abstract: Summary
In lower vertebrates, stem/progenitor cells located in a peripheral domain of the retina, called the ciliary margin zone (CMZ), cooperate with retinal domain progenitors to build the mature neural retina. In mammals, it is believed that the CMZ lacks neurogenic potential and that the retina develops from one pool of multipotent retinal progenitor cells (RPCs). Here we identify a population of Msx1-expressing progenitors in the mouse CMZ that is both molecularly and functionally distinct from RPCs. Using genetic lineage tracing, we report that Msx1 progenitors have unique developmental properties compared with RPCs. Msx1 lineages contain both neural retina and non-neural ciliary epithelial progenies and overall generate fewer photoreceptors than classical RPC lineages. Furthermore, we show that the endocytic adaptor protein Numb regulates the balance between neural and non-neural fates in Msx1 progenitors. These results uncover a population of CMZ progenitors, distinct from classical RPCs, that also contributes to mammalian retinogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Accumulating evidence suggests that cancer cells with stem cell-like phenotypes drive disease progression and therapeutic resistance in glioblastoma (GBM). NOTCH regulates self-renewal and resistance to chemoradiotherapy in GBM stem cells. However, NOTCH-targeted γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) exhibited limited efficacy in GBM patients. We found that farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) significantly improved sensitivity to GSIs. This combination showed significant antineoplastic and radiosensitizing activities in GBM stem cells, whereas non-stem GBM cells were resistant. These combinatorial effects were mediated, at least partially, through inhibition of AKT and cell-cycle progression. Using subcutaneous and orthotopic GBM models, we showed that the combination of FTIs and GSIs, but not either agent alone, significantly reduced tumor growth. With concurrent radiation, this combination induced a durable response in a subset of orthotopic tumors. These findings collectively suggest that the combination of FTIs and GSIs is a promising therapeutic strategy for GBM through selectively targeting the cancer stem cell subpopulation.

Abstract: Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer the potential to generate tissues with ethnic diversity enabling toxicity testing on selected populations. Recently, it has been reported that endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) derived from umbilical cord blood (CB) or adult peripheral blood (PB) afford a practical and efficient cellular substrate for iPSC generation. However, differences between EPCs from different blood sources have rarely been studied. In the current study, we derived EPCs from blood mononuclear cells (MNCs) and reprogrammed EPCs into iPSCs. We also explored differences between CB-EPCs and PB-EPCs at the molecular and cellular levels through a combination of transcriptomic analysis and cell biology techniques. EPC colonies in CB-MNCs emerged 5–7days earlier, were 3-fold higher in number, and consistently larger in size than in PB-MNCs. Similarly, iPSC colonies generated from CB-EPCs was 2.5-fold higher in number than from PB-EPCs, indicating CB-EPCs have a higher reprogramming efficiency than PB-EPCs. Transcriptomic analysis using microarrays found a total of 1133 genes differentially expressed in CB-EPCs compared with PB-EPCs, with 675 genes upregulated and 458 downregulated. Several canonical pathways were impacted, among which the human embryonic stem cell pluripotency pathway was of particular interest. The differences in the gene expression pattern between CB-EPCs and PB-EPCs provide a molecular basis for the discrepancies seen in their derivation and reprogramming efficiencies, and highlight the advantages of using CB as the cellular source for the generation of iPSCs and their derivative tissues for ethnic-related toxicological applications.

Abstract: Summary
The nitric oxide (NO)-cyclic GMP pathway contributes to human stem cell differentiation, but NO free radical production can also damage DNA, necessitating a robust DNA damage response (DDR) to ensure cell survival. How the DDR is affected by differentiation is unclear. Differentiation of stem cells, either inducible pluripotent or embryonic derived, increased residual DNA damage as determined by γ-H2AX and 53BP1 foci, with increased S-phase-specific chromosomal aberration after exposure to DNA-damaging agents, suggesting reduced homologous recombination (HR) repair as supported by the observation of decreased HR-related repair factor foci formation (RAD51 and BRCA1). Differentiated cells also had relatively increased fork stalling and R-loop formation after DNA replication stress. Treatment with NO donor (NOC-18), which causes stem cell differentiation has no effect on double-strand break (DSB) repair by non-homologous end-joining but reduced DSB repair by HR. Present studies suggest that DNA repair by HR is impaired in differentiated cells.

Abstract: Summary
Memory is formed by synapse-to-nucleus communication that leads to regulation of gene transcription, but the identity and organizational logic of signaling pathways involved in this communication remain unclear. Here we find that the transcription cofactor CRTC1 is a critical determinant of sustained gene transcription and memory strength in the hippocampus. Following associative learning, synaptically localized CRTC1 is translocated to the nucleus and regulates Fgf1b transcription in an activity-dependent manner. After both weak and strong training, the HDAC3-N-CoR corepressor complex leaves the Fgf1b promoter and a complex involving the translocated CRTC1, phosphorylated CREB, and histone acetyltransferase CBP induces transient transcription. Strong training later substitutes KAT5 for CBP, a process that is dependent on CRTC1, but not on CREB phosphorylation. This in turn leads to long-lasting Fgf1b transcription and memory enhancement. Thus, memory strength relies on activity-dependent changes in chromatin and temporal regulation of gene transcription on specific CREB/CRTC1 gene targets.

Abstract: Summary
We describe the development and characterization of a mouse and human epithelial cell monolayer platform of the small and large intestines, with a broad range of potential applications including the discovery and development of minimally systemic drug candidates. Culture conditions for each intestinal segment were optimized by correlating monolayer global gene expression with the corresponding tissue segment. The monolayers polarized, formed tight junctions, and contained a diversity of intestinal epithelial cell lineages. Ion transport phenotypes of monolayers from the proximal and distal colon and small intestine matched the known and unique physiology of these intestinal segments. The cultures secreted serotonin, GLP-1, and FGF19 and upregulated the epithelial sodium channel in response to known biologically active agents, suggesting intact secretory and absorptive functions. A screen of over 2,000 pharmacologically active compounds for inhibition of potassium ion transport in the mouse distal colon cultures led to the identification of a tool compound.

Abstract: Summary
Loss of cone photoreceptors, crucial for daylight vision, has the greatest impact on sight in retinal degeneration. Transplantation of stem cell-derived L/M-opsin cones, which form 90% of the human cone population, could provide a feasible therapy to restore vision. However, transcriptomic similarities between fetal and stem cell-derived cones remain to be defined, in addition to development of cone cell purification strategies. Here, we report an analysis of the human L/M-opsin cone photoreceptor transcriptome using an AAV2/9.pR2.1:GFP reporter. This led to the identification of a cone-enriched gene signature, which we used to demonstrate similar gene expression between fetal and stem cell-derived cones. We then defined a cluster of differentiation marker combination that, when used for cell sorting, significantly enriches for cone photoreceptors from the fetal retina and stem cell-derived retinal organoids, respectively. These data may facilitate more efficient isolation of human stem cell-derived cones for use in clinical transplantation studies.

Abstract: Summary
C2c1 is a type V-B CRISPR-Cas system dual-RNA-guided DNA endonuclease. Here, we report the crystal structure of Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris C2c1 in complex with a chimeric single-molecule guide RNA (sgRNA). AacC2c1 exhibits a bi-lobed architecture consisting of a REC and NUC lobe. The sgRNA scaffold forms a tetra-helical structure, distinct from previous predictions. The crRNA is located in the central channel of C2c1, and the tracrRNA resides in an external surface groove. Although AacC2c1 lacks a PAM-interacting domain, our analysis revealed that the PAM duplex has a similar binding position found in Cpf1. Importantly, C2c1-sgRNA system is highly sensitive to single-nucleotide mismatches between guide RNA and target DNA. The resulting reduction in off-target cleavage renders C2c1 a valuable addition to the current arsenal of genome-editing tools. Together, our findings indicate that sgRNA assembly is achieved through a mechanism distinct from that reported previously for Cas9 or Cpf1 endonucleases.

Abstract: Summary
Neural stem cell activity in the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) decreases with aging, thought to occur by a unidirectional decline. However, by analyzing the V-SVZ transcriptome of male mice at 2, 6, 18, and 22 months, we found that most of the genes that change significantly over time show a reversal of trend, with a maximum or minimum expression at 18 months. In vivo, MASH1+ progenitor cells decreased in number and proliferation between 2 and 18 months but increased between 18 and 22 months. Time-lapse lineage analysis of 944 V-SVZ cells showed that age-related declines in neurogenesis were recapitulated in vitro in clones. However, activated type B/type C cell clones divide slower at 2 to 18 months, then unexpectedly faster at 22 months, with impaired transition to type A neuroblasts. Our findings indicate that aging of the V-SVZ involves significant non-monotonic changes that are programmed within progenitor cells and are observable independent of the aging niche.

Abstract: Summary
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder and the leading cause of cognitive impairment. Due to insufficient understanding of the disease mechanisms, there are no efficient therapies for AD. Most studies have focused on neuronal cells, but astrocytes have also been suggested to contribute to AD pathology. We describe here the generation of functional astrocytes from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from AD patients with PSEN1 ΔE9 mutation, as well as healthy and gene-corrected isogenic controls. AD astrocytes manifest hallmarks of disease pathology, including increased β-amyloid production, altered cytokine release, and dysregulated Ca2+ homeostasis. Furthermore, due to altered metabolism, AD astrocytes show increased oxidative stress and reduced lactate secretion, as well as compromised neuronal supportive function, as evidenced by altering Ca2+ transients in healthy neurons. Our results reveal an important role for astrocytes in AD pathology and highlight the strength of iPSC-derived models for brain diseases.

Abstract: Breast cancer is a common malignancy and a major cause of death in women worldwide. The immunomodulatory role of B cells is being increasingly recognized in autoimmune diseases and cancers. In recent years, immunotherapeutic strategies that upregulate the patient's own antitumor T cell responses have shown promise in treating solid tumors and are being developed for breast cancer. In this study, we discovered that the B cells in breast cancer patients were enriched with interferon (IFN)-γ-expressing cells and presented high potency for IFN-γ production. These IFN-γ-expressing B cells were enriched in, but did not completely overlap with, the CD21lo/medCD27+IgM-IgD-IgG+IgA- B cell subset, which was consistent with IgG-expressing memory B cells. Compared to CD27+IgG- B cells, the CD27+IgG+ B cells expressed significantly higher IFN-γ expression. Given that B cells demonstrate important antigen-presenting function to T cells, we incubated CD27+IgG- B cells and CD27+IgG+ B cells with autologous CD4+ T cells. Compared to the CD4+ T cells that were incubated with CD27+IgG- B cells, the CD4+ T cells that were incubated with CD27+IgG+ B cells presented significantly higher TBX21 and lower FOXP3 expression, suggesting that the CD27+IgG+ B cells, but not the CD27+IgG- B cells, promoted Th1 and suppressed regulatory T cell responses. IFN-γ-expressing B cells were further enriched in the intratumoral environment of breast cancer patients. Together, we discovered that breast cancer patients presented an upregulation of IFN-γ-expressing proinflammatory B cells with the potency to promote Th1 responses.

Abstract: Angiogenesis plays an important role in tumor growth and progression in solid tumors. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the most critical and specific factors that stimulate both physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Here, we report a novel role of BRG1, the core subunit of SWI/SNF family complexes, in angiogenesis. In this study, we demonstrate that BRG1 is overexpressed in colorectal cancer and decreased expression of BRG1 not only blocks cell proliferation but remarkably inhibits the ability of HUVECs to form capillary-like structures. Moreover, our study shows that BRG1 can regulate the expression of VEGF-A by interacting with HIF-1α. Furthermore, we find VEGF-A is overexpressed in colorectal cancer and is positively correlated with BRG1 expression. Taken together, our study demonstrated that BRG1 can promote VEGF-A expression and angiogenesis in colorectal cancer and BRG1 may be a novel drug target for the treatment of colorectal cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The relevance of topographic cues for commitment of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that groove-ridge structures with a periodicity in the submicrometer range induce elongation of iPSC colonies, guide the orientation of apical actin fibers, and direct the polarity of cell division. Elongation of iPSC colonies impacts also on their intrinsic molecular patterning, which seems to be orchestrated from the rim of the colonies. BMP4-induced differentiation is enhanced in elongated colonies, and the submicron grooves impact on the spatial modulation of YAP activity upon induction with this morphogen. Interestingly, TAZ, a YAP paralog, shows distinct cytoskeletal localization in iPSCs. These findings demonstrate that topography can guide orientation and organization of iPSC colonies, which may affect the interaction between mechanosensors and mechanotransducers in iPSCs.

Abstract: The development of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) holds great promise for regenerative medicine. However the iPSC induction efficiency is still very low and with lengthy reprogramming process. We utilized the highly potent transactivation domain (TAD) of MYC protein to engineer the human OCT4 fusion proteins. Applying the MYC-TAD-OCT4 fusion proteins in mouse iPSC generation leads to shorter reprogramming dynamics, with earlier activation of pluripotent markers in reprogrammed cells than wild type OCT4 (wt-OCT4). Dramatic enhancement of iPSC colony induction efficiency and shortened reprogramming dynamics were observed when these MYC-TAD-OCT4 fusion proteins were used to reprogram primary human cells. The OCT4 fusion proteins induced human iPSCs are pluripotent. We further show that the MYC Box I (MBI) is dispensable while both MBII and the linking region between MBI/II are essential for the enhanced reprogramming activity of MYC-TAD-OCT4 fusion protein. Consistent with an enhanced transcription activity, the engineered OCT4 significantly stimulated the expression of genes specifically targeted by OCT4-alone, OCT4/SOX2, and OCT4/SOX2/KLF4 during human iPSC induction, compared with the wt-OCT4. The MYC-TAD-OCT4 fusion proteins we generated will be valuable tools for studying the reprogramming mechanisms and for efficient iPSC generation for humans as well as for other species.

Abstract: Pteronotus personatus as an insectivore bat and has a diet that consists of a high protein diet, whereas the diet of Anoura geoffroyi, a predominantly nectarivore bat, is rich in simple sugars like sucrose, glucose and fructose. Considering that diet influences the activation of different pathways, which may influence morphological adaptations in the gastrointestinal system, the aim of this study was to compare the morphology of the endocrine pancreas in P. personatus and A. geoffroyi. For this, histological, stereological and immunohistochemical methods were used. In P. personatus, the average diameter of the pancreatic islet was 40.47μm±13.94, while in A. geoffroyi was 88.16μm±36.40. The total number of pancreatic islets in P. personatus was 26150±2346 and in A. geoffroyi was 15970±1666. In P. personatus, the volume density of the pancreatic islets was 3.4%± 2.6, whereas in A. geoffroyi the volume density was 6.1%±3.7. In addition, the immunodensity of the α, β and δ cells, in P. personatus was 25.8%±11.9, 35.5%±13.5, 3.9%±0.7, respectively, and in A. geoffroyi was 33.10%±12.7, 55.08%±7.4, 6.2%±4.6, respectively. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate differences in the pancreatic weight/body, weight ratio, diameter and volume density of pancreatic islets and in immunodensity of the β and α cells between both species, which have different dietary habits.

Abstract: The localization of galectin-3, a β-galactoside-binding animal lectin, was immunohistochemically studied in the ovaries of pigs to determine its expression in ovarian folliculogenesis. Various stages of ovarian follicles were identified in the ovaries of adult pigs. Galectin-3 was immunostained in the squamous follicular cells surrounding oocytes in primordial follicles and in the unilaminar granulosa cells of primary follicles, but not in oocytes of multilaminar follicles (including primary, secondary, and tertiary Graafian follicles). As in adult ovaries, galectin-3 immunoreactivity was prominent in the unilaminar follicles in neonatal ovaries. Galectin-3 was also immunolocalized in the luteal cells in the corpus luteum and granulosa cells of atretic follicles as well as in interstitial macrophages in porcine ovaries. Collectively, these results suggest that galectin-3 is transiently expressed in follicular cells in the unilaminar ovarian follicles (primordial and primary) but not in multilaminar ovarian follicles (primary to tertiary), implying that galectin-3 is embryologically involved in ovum generation.

Abstract: Epithelial–mesenchymal transition(EMT) is the main reason for peritoneal fibrosis and the mechanism underlying peritoneal EMT were extensively studied in recent years. Recent researches showed that miRNAs were so important in the development of organ EMT and fibrosis, the role of microRNAs on peritoneal dialysis have also been studied. In the current study, we investigated microRNA-23(miR-23) expression in high glucose(HG) induced EMT in human mesotheial peritoneal cells(HPMCs). We found that HG promoted EMT, which was characterized by the upregulation of mesenchymal markers α-SMA and FN and downregulation of epithelial marker E-cadherin. The expression miR-23 showed a significant upregulation when treated with HG. Enhanced expression of miR-23 could aggravate HG induced EMT by targeting VDR, inhibition of miR-23 in HPMCs could reverse HG induced EMT by targeting VDR. Furthermore, VDRshRNA exacerbated the EMT process and reversed miR-23 inhibitor-attenuated EMT process in HPMCs. These data manifested that miR-23 played a key role in HG-induced EMT of HPMCs by targeting VDR.

Abstract: Primary hepatocytes are widely used in the study of dynamic events like regulation of gene expression, as they are superior to most cell-lines. However, the culturing of the hepatocytes often results in loss of phenotype, e.g. the expression of the cytochrome p450s (CYP). The present study investigated the impact of serum in the culture medium of porcine primary hepatocytes (PPH) on markers of dedifferentiation as well as the impact on CYP induction. The effects were studied in both freshly isolated primary hepatocytes as well as cryopreserved. The exclusion of serum in the culturing media were not introducing significant dedifferentiation as judged by the gene expression of α-fetoprotein, albumin, glucose-6-phosphatase and the constitutive expression of selected transcription factors and CYP. The induction of CYP2B22 and CYP3A29 by phenobarbital and rifampicin, were greater in hepatocytes cultured without serum. The same were not observed for TCDD induced CYP1A2 expression. In conclusion, PPH cultured under serum free conditions results in little or no dedifferentiation, while being more responsive to known CYP inducers. Hence, it can be suggested that PPH cultured under serum free conditions provides a reliable hepatocyte model to investigate CYP gene regulation.
