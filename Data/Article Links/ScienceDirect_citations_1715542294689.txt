Abstract: Heat-related illness and injury are becoming a growing safety concern for the farmers, construction workers, miners, firefighters, manufacturing workers, and other outdoor workforces who are exposed to heat stress in their routine lives. A primary response by a cell to an acute heat shock (HS) exposure is the induction of heat-shock proteins (HSPs), which chaperone and facilitate cellular protein folding and remodeling processes. While acute HS is well studied, the effect of repeated bouts of hyperthermia and the sustained production of HSPs in the myoblast-myotube model system of C2C12 cells are poorly characterized. In C2C12 myoblasts, we found that robust HS (43 °C, dose/time) significantly decreased the proliferation by 50% as early as on day 1 and maintained at the same level on days 2 and 3 of HS. This was accompanied by an accumulation of cells at G2 phase with reduced cell number in G1 phase indicating cell cycle arrest. FACS analysis indicates that there was no apparent change in apoptosis (markers) and cell death upon repeated HS. Immunoblot analysis and qPCR demonstrated a significant increase in the baseline expression of HSP25, 70, and 90 (among others) in cells after a single HS (43 °C) for 60 min as a typical HS response. Importantly, the repeated HS for 60 min each on days 2 and 3 maintained the elevated levels of HSPs compared to the control cells. Further, the continuous HS exposure resulted in significant inhibition of the differentiation of C2C12 myocytes to myotubes and only 1/10th of the cells underwent differentiation in HS relative to control. This was associated with significantly higher levels of HSPs and reduced expression of myogenin and Myh2 (P < 0.05), the genes involved in the differentiation process. Finally, the cell migration (scratch) assay indicated that the wound closure was significantly delayed in HS cells relative to the control cells. Overall, these results suggest that a repeated HS may perturb the active process of proliferation, motility, and differentiation processes in an in vitro murine myoblast-myotube model.

Abstract: The heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a copious and ubiquitous molecular chaperone which plays an essential role in many cellular biological processes. The objective of this study was to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Hsp90AA1 gene and to determine their association with heat stress traits in Chinese Holstein cattle breed. Direct sequencing was used to identify new SNPs. Luciferase reporter assay methods were used to assess g.− 87G > C and g.4172A > G loci in the promoter activity and 3′-UTR, respectively. Quantitative real-time PCR was utilized to quantify the gene expression profile. Five SNPs were identified in 130 multiparous lactating cows: one SNP in the promoter, three SNPs in the coding region, and one in 3′-UTR were novel and reported for the first time in this study. As a result of promoter assay using dual luciferase assay system, the genotype CC showed the highest transcription activity region (13.67 ± 0.578) compared to the wild-type GG (3.24 ± 0.103). On the other hand, the result revealed that one of the selected microRNAs (dme-miR-2279-5p) was found to interact with the Hsp90AA1 3′-UTR sequence and to suppress the reporter activity markedly in the presence of the allele G (2.480 ± 0.136). The expression of Hsp90AA1 in cow bearing mutant allele C was higher (4.18 ± 0.928) than cows bearing wild-type allele G (1.008 ± 0.0.129) in stress season. In summary, there was an association between genetic variations in the Hsp90AA1 and thermoresistance. This association could be used as a marker in genetic selection for heat tolerance in Chinese Holstein cattle breeds.

Abstract: FAM20C mutations compromise the mineralization of skeleton and tooth in both human and mouse. Putatively, the mineralization disorder is attributed to the elevated fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), which reduced the serum phosphorus by suppressing the reabsorption of phosphorus in kidney. Besides the regulation on systemic phosphorus homeostasis, FAM20C was also implicated to regulate cell behaviors and gene expression through a cell-autonomous manner. To identify the primary effects of Fam20c on dental mesenchymal cells, mouse Fam20c-deficient dental mesenchymal cells were generated by removing the floxed alleles from the immortalized mouse Fam20cf/f dental mesenchymal cells with Cre-expressing lentivirus. The removal of Fam20c exerted no impact on cell morphology, but suppressed the proliferation and mobility of the dental mesenchymal cells. Fam20c deficiency also significantly reduced the expression of Osterix, Runx2, type I Collagen a 1 (Col1a1), Alkaline phosphatase (Alpl) and the members of the small integrin-binding ligand, N-linked glycoprotein (SIBLING) family, but increased Fgf23 expression. Consistently, the in vitro mineralization of Fam20c-deficient dental mesenchymal cells was severely disabled. However, supplements of the non-collagenous proteins from wild type rat dentin failed to rescue the compromised mineralization, suggesting that the roles of FAM20C in tooth mineralization are more than phosphorylating local matrices and regulating systemic phosphorus metabolism. Moreover, the down-regulated BMP signaling pathways in the Fam20c deficient dental mesenchymal cells revealed that the kinase activity of FAM20C might be required to maintain BMP signaling. In summary, our study discloses that Fam20c indeed regulates cell behaviors and cell signaling pathway in a cell-autonomous manner.

Abstract: In patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC), surgery is complemented with systemic therapy – chemotherapy and radiochemotherapy. Although the patients’ overall survival has been significantly improved, tumor resistance is still a frequent cause of chemotherapy failure. Several factors contribute to chemoresistance of tumor cells including changes related with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The present study was designed to verify the presence of EMT markers in paired CRC primary cell lines obtained from primary tumor sites and lymph node metastases of three patients and to investigate the effect of irinotecan and oxaliplatin treatment on these markers as well. The samples of the higher stage of CRC and positive for angioinvasion were selected and qPCR, western blot analysis, migration assay, cytotoxicity testing was performed. Results confirmed the increased expression of several markers characteristic of EMT and invasiveness in lymph node metastatic cells, with a significant variability between individual samples. Irinotecan and oxaliplatin decreased migration activity of the cells and to the varying degree affected the expression of EMT and invasiveness markers. In conclusion, in CRC EMT is present in metastatic cells over a phenotypic continuum whose expression is altered heterogeneously upon irinotecan and oxaliplatin treatment.

Abstract: The cardiac microvascular reperfusion injury is characterized by the microvascular endothelial cells (CMECs) oxidative damage which is responsible for the progression of cardiac dysfunction. However, few strategies are available to reverse such pathologies. This study aimed to explore the mechanism by which oxidative stress induced CMECs death and the beneficial actions of melatonin on CMECs survival, with a special focused on IP3R-[Ca2+]c/VDAC-[Ca2+]m damage axis and the MAPK/ERK survival signaling. We found that oxidative stress induced by H2O2 significantly activated cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) that enhanced IP3R and VDAC transcription and expression, leading to [Ca2+]c and [Ca2+]m overload. High concentration of [Ca2+]m suppressed ΔΨm, opened mPTP, and released cyt-c into cytoplasm where it activated mitochondria-dependent death pathway. However, melatonin could protect CMECs against oxidative stress injury via stimulation of MAPK/ERK that inactivated CREB and therefore blocked IP3R/VDAC upregulation and [Ca2+]c/[Ca2+]m overload, sustaining mitochondrial structural and function integrity and ultimately blockading mitochondrial-mediated cellular death. In summary, these findings confirmed the mechanisms by which oxidative injury induced CMECs mitochondrial-involved death and provided an attractive and effective way to enhance CMECs survival.

Abstract: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling is activated in retinal degeneration disease. Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), an important mediator of the unfolded protein response (UPR), is a key element that maintains cell survival and proliferation in hypoxic conditions. Our previous studies showed that a small ribosomal protein L41 (RPL41) inhibits ATF4 by inducing its phosphorylation and degradation. In the present study, the effects of mini-peptide RPL41 on retinal neovascularization (RNV) in oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) mice was investigated. We induced OIR in C57BL/6 mice and obtained retinas from normoxia, OIR, OIR control (treated with PBS), and OIR treated (treated with RPL41) mice. Our results showed that ER stress signaling was activated and ATF4 was overexpressed in the retinas of OIR mice. After intravitreal injection of RPL41, the size of RNV and vaso-obliteration, and the number of preretinal neovascular cell nuclei in the retinas of OIR mice were significantly decreased. Western blot analysis and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) showed ATF4 and VEGF expression decreased after intravitreal injection of RPL41. Furthermore, the expression levels of inflammatory genes including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 were significantly decreased compared with the OIR control mice. In conclusion, RPL41 prevented pathologic neovascularization and exerted anti-inflammatory effects by degrading the important ER stress factor ATF4, thus, RPL41 could be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of neovascular eye diseases, especially retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).

Abstract: Summary
At the base of the intestinal crypt, long-lived Lgr5+ stem cells are intercalated by Paneth cells that provide essential niche signals for stem cell maintenance. This unique epithelial anatomy makes the intestinal crypt one of the most accessible models for the study of adult stem cell biology. The glycosylation patterns of this compartment are poorly characterized, and the impact of glycans on stem cell differentiation remains largely unexplored. We find that Paneth cells, but not Lgr5+ stem cells, express abundant terminal N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc). Employing an enzymatic method to edit glycans in cultured crypt organoids, we assess the functional role of LacNAc in the intestinal crypt. We discover that blocking access to LacNAc on Paneth cells leads to hyperproliferation of the neighboring Lgr5+ stem cells, which is accompanied by the downregulation of genes that are known as negative regulators of proliferation.

Abstract: Summary
The role of membrane lipids in modulating eukaryotic transporter assembly and function remains unclear. We investigated the effect of membrane lipids in the structure and transport activity of the purine transporter UapA from Aspergillus nidulans. We found that UapA exists mainly as a dimer and that two lipid molecules bind per UapA dimer. We identified three phospholipid classes that co-purified with UapA: phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylinositol (PI). UapA delipidation caused dissociation of the dimer into monomers. Subsequent addition of PI or PE rescued the UapA dimer and allowed recovery of bound lipids, suggesting a central role of these lipids in stabilizing the dimer. Molecular dynamics simulations predicted a lipid binding site near the UapA dimer interface. Mutational analyses established that lipid binding at this site is essential for formation of functional UapA dimers. We propose that structural lipids have a central role in the formation of functional, dimeric UapA.

Abstract: Summary
The HIV-1-encoded accessory protein Vpu exerts several immunomodulatory functions, including counteraction of the host restriction factor tetherin, downmodulation of CD4, and inhibition of NF-κB activity to facilitate HIV-1 infection. However, the relative contribution of individual Vpu functions to HIV-1 infection in vivo remained unclear. Here, we used a humanized mouse model and HIV-1 strains with selective mutations in vpu to demonstrate that the anti-tetherin activity of Vpu is a prerequisite for efficient viral spread during the early phase of infection. Mathematical modeling and gain-of-function mutations in SIVcpz, the simian precursor of pandemic HIV-1, corroborate this finding. Blockage of interferon signaling combined with transcriptome analyses revealed that basal tetherin levels are sufficient to control viral replication. These results establish tetherin as a key effector of the intrinsic immune defense against HIV-1, and they demonstrate that Vpu-mediated tetherin antagonism is critical for efficient viral spread during the initial phase of HIV-1 replication.

Abstract: Summary
Due to their role in many diseases, enzymes of the ubiquitin system have recently become interesting drug targets. Despite efforts, primary screenings of compound libraries targeting E2 enzymes and E3 ligases have been strongly limited by the lack of robust and fast high-throughput assays. Here we report a label-free high-throughput screening assay for ubiquitin E2 conjugating enzymes and E3 ligases based on MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The MALDI-TOF E2/E3 assay allows testing E2 enzymes and E3 ligases for their ubiquitin transfer activity, identifying E2/E3 active pairs, inhibitor potency and specificity and screening compound libraries in vitro without chemical or fluorescent probes. We demonstrate that the MALDI-TOF E2/E3 assay is a universal tool for drug discovery screening in the ubiquitin pathway as it is suitable for working with all E3 ligase families and requires a reduced amount of reagents, compared with standard biochemical assays.

Abstract: Heat shock cognate 70 (HSC70) is a class of highly conserved proteins which functions as a molecular chaperon, participates in tolerance processes, and is involved in protein folding, degradation, targeting, translocation, and protein complex remodeling. In this study, the mRNA expression level of the Haliotis diversicolor HSC70 (HdHSC70) gene was detected by quantitative real-time PCR in different tissues and under different stresses. The results showed that the HdHSC70 gene was ubiquitously expressed in seven selected tissues. The highest expression level was detected in gills (P < 0.05). The expression level of the HdHSC70 gene was significantly upregulated by thermal stress, hypoxia stress, Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection, and combined thermal and hypoxia stress. The upregulation occurred at the early stage of stress. These results indicated that the HdHSC70 is an important component in the immune system of H. diversicolor and is involved in the early stress response. Meanwhile, 5′-flanking region sequence (2013 bp) of the HdHSC70 gene was cloned; it contains a putative core promoter region, heat shock element, CpG, and transcription elements including NF-1, Sp1, Oct-1, interferon consensus sequence binding protein (ICSBP), etc. In HEK 293T cells, the 5′-flanking region sequence is able to drive expression of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), proving its promoter function. The promoter activity increased after high-temperature treatment, which may be the immediate reason why the expression of the HdHSC70 gene was significantly upregulated by thermal stress. After the ICSBP-binding site was mutated, we found the luciferase activity significantly reduced, which suggested that the ICSBP-binding site has a certain enhancement effect on the activity of the HdHSC70 promoter.

Abstract: Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram-negative coccobacillus found primarily in hospital settings that has recently emerged as a source of hospital-acquired infections, including bacterial pneumonia. The hLF(1-11) peptide comprising the first 11 N-terminal residues of human lactoferrin exerts antimicrobial activity in vivo and was highly effective against multidrug-resistant A. baumannii strains in vitro and in vivo. Pyroptosis is a caspase-1-dependent inflammatory cell death process and is induced by various microbial infections. In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms that regulate pyroptosis induced by A. baumannii in macrophages. Our results revealed that A. baumannii induced pyroptosis through caspase-1 activation and IL-1β production. We also found that caspase-1 activation and IL-1β maturation in A. baumannii-triggered pyroptotic cell death were reduced by hLF(1-11) treatment. Moreover, hLF(1-11) inhibited the A. baumannii-induced caspase-1 activation and pyroptosis of pulmonary alveolar macrophages in vivo.

Abstract: Although resident cardiac stem cells have been reported, regeneration of functional cardiomyocytes (CMs) remains a challenge. The present study identifies an alternative progenitor source for CM regeneration without the need for genetic manipulation or invasive heart biopsy procedures. Unlike limb skeletal muscles, masseter muscles (MM) in the mouse head are developed from Nkx2–5 mesodermal progenitors. Adult masseter muscle satellite cells (MMSCs) display heterogeneity in developmental origin and cell phenotypes. The heterogeneous MMSCs that can be characterized by cell sorting based on stem cell antigen-1 (Sca1) show different lineage potential. While cardiogenic potential is preserved in Sca1+ MMSCs as shown by expression of cardiac progenitor genes (including Nkx2–5), skeletal myogenic capacity is maintained in Sca1- MMSCs with Pax7 expression. Sca1+ MMSC-derived beating cells express cardiac genes and exhibit CM-like morphology. Electrophysiological properties of MMSC-derived CMs are demonstrated by calcium transients and action potentials. These findings show that MMSCs could serve as a novel cell source for cardiomyocyte replacement.

Abstract: Summary
Bacteria use quorum sensing (QS) to regulate gene expression. We identified a group A Streptococcus (GAS) strain possessing the QS system sil, which produces functional bacteriocins, through a sequential signaling pathway integrating host and bacterial signals. Host cells infected by GAS release asparagine (ASN), which is sensed by the bacteria to alter its gene expression and rate of proliferation. We show that upon ASN sensing, GAS upregulates expression of the QS autoinducer peptide SilCR. Initial SilCR expression activates the autoinduction cycle for further SilCR production. The autoinduction process propagates throughout the GAS population, resulting in bacteriocin production. Subcutaneous co-injection of mice with a bacteriocin-producing strain and the globally disseminated M1T1 GAS clone results in M1T1 killing within soft tissue. Thus, by sensing host signals, a fraction of a bacterial population can trigger an autoinduction mechanism mediated by QS, which acts on the entire bacterial community to outcompete other bacteria within the infection.

Abstract: Summary
Alport syndrome is a hereditary glomerular disease caused by mutation in type IV collagen α3–α5 chains (α3–α5(IV)), which disrupts trimerization, leading to glomerular basement membrane degeneration. Correcting the trimerization of α3/α4/α5 chain is a feasible therapeutic approach, but is hindered by lack of information on the regulation of intracellular α(IV) chain and the absence of high-throughput screening (HTS) platforms to assess α345(IV) trimer formation. Here, we developed sets of split NanoLuc-fusion α345(IV) proteins to monitor α345(IV) trimerization of wild-type and clinically associated mutant α5(IV). The α345(IV) trimer assay, which satisfied the acceptance criteria for HTS, enabled the characterization of intracellular- and secretion-dependent defects of mutant α5(IV). Small interfering RNA-based and chemical screening targeting the ER identified several chemical chaperones that have potential to promote α345(IV) trimer formation. This split luciferase-based trimer formation assay is a functional HTS platform that realizes the feasibility of targeting α345(IV) trimers to treat Alport syndrome.

Abstract: Summary
The protein level of OCT4, a core pluripotency transcription factor, is vital for embryonic stem cell (ESC) maintenance, differentiation, and somatic cell reprogramming. However, how OCT4 protein levels are controlled during reprogramming remains largely unknown. Here, we identify ubiquitin conjugation sites of OCT4 and report that disruption of WWP2-catalyzed OCT4 ubiquitination or ablation of Wwp2 significantly promotes the efficiency of pluripotency induction from mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Mechanistically, disruption of WWP2-mediated OCT4 ubiquitination elevates OCT4 protein stability and H3K4 methylation level during the reprogramming process. Furthermore, we reveal that OCT4 directly activates expression of Ash2l-b, and that ASH2L-B is a major isoform of ASH2L highly expressed in ESCs and required for somatic cell reprogramming. Together, this study emphasizes the importance of ubiquitination manipulation of the reprogramming factor and its interplay with the epigenetic regulator for successful reprogramming, opening a new avenue to improve the efficiency of pluripotency induction.

Abstract: TLR expression in neutrophils and monocytes is associated with increased cytokine synthesis, resulting in increased inflammation. However, the inflammatory pathway related to TLR and cathelicidin expression in these cells from CKD patients is unclear. To evaluate TLR4, cathelicidin, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10 and MCP-1 expression in neutrophils and monocytes from HD and CKD patients. Blood samples were drawn from 47 CKD and 43 HD patients and 71 age and gender-matched healthy volunteers (CONT). TLR4 was analyzed using flow cytometry. Cathelicidin, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10 and MCP-1 were analyzed via ELISA.TLR4 expression in neutrophils was higher in HD patients than in stage 3 and 4 CKD patients. In these cells, we observed a positive correlation between TLR4 and cathelicidin, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10 and MCP-1 levels. In monocytes, TLR4 expression was significantly higher in CKD 3 and 4 groups than in the control and HD groups and positively and negatively correlated with IL-6 and MCP-1 and cathelicidin, respectively. TNF-α, IL-6 and MCP-1 serum levels were higher in HD and CKD patients than in control. Cathelicidin and IL-10 levels were only higher in HD patients. IL-6 serum levels were positively correlated with all cytokines, and cathelicidin was negatively correlated with MCP-1 (r = − 0.35; p < 0.01) and positively correlated with IL-10 (r = 0.37; p = 0.001). These results suggest that a uremic environment induces high TLR4, cathelicidin and cytokine expression and may increase inflammation. Thus, future studies should be conducted to evaluate whether TLR4 and cathelicidin should be targets for anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: Differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells towards definitive endoderm (DE) is the critical first step for generating cells comprising organs such as the gut, liver, pancreas and lung. This in-vitro differentiation process generates a heterogeneous population with a proportion of cells failing to differentiate properly and maintaining expression of pluripotency factors such as Oct4. RNA sequencing of single cells collected at four time points during a 4-day DE differentiation identified high expression of metallothionein genes in the residual Oct4-positive cells that failed to differentiate to DE. Using X-ray fluorescence microscopy and multi-isotope mass spectrometry, we discovered that high intracellular zinc level corresponds with persistent Oct4 expression and failure to differentiate. This study improves our understanding of the cellular heterogeneity during in-vitro directed differentiation and provides a valuable resource to improve DE differentiation efficiency.

Abstract: Summary
Increasing demand for clinical retinal degeneration therapies featuring human ESC/iPSC-derived retinal tissue and cells warrants proof-of-concept studies. Here, we established two mouse models of end-stage retinal degeneration with immunodeficiency, NOG-rd1-2J and NOG-rd10, and characterized disease progress and immunodeficient status. We also transplanted human ESC-derived retinal sheets into NOG-rd1-2J and confirmed their long-term survival and maturation of the structured graft photoreceptor layer, without rejection or tumorigenesis. We recorded light responses from the host ganglion cells using a multi-electrode array system; this result was consistent with whole-mount immunostaining suggestive of host-graft synapse formation at the responding sites. This study demonstrates an application of our mouse models and provides a proof of concept for the clinical use of human ESC-derived retinal sheets.

Abstract: Summary
Many cancer-related proteins are controlled by composite post-translational modifications (PTMs), but prevalent strategies only target one type of modification. Here we describe a designed peptide that controls two types of modifications of the p53 tumor suppressor, based on the discovery of a protein complex that suppresses p53 (suppresome). We found that Morn3, a cancer-testis antigen, recruits different PTM enzymes, such as sirtuin deacetylase and ubiquitin ligase, to confer composite modifications on p53. The molecular functions of Morn3 were validated through in vivo assays and chemico-biological intervention. A rationally designed Morn3-targeting peptide (Morncide) successfully activated p53 and suppressed tumor growth. These findings shed light on the regulation of protein PTMs and present a strategy for targeting two modifications with one molecule.

Abstract: Summary
The brain of Down syndrome (DS) patients exhibits fewer interneurons in the cerebral cortex, but its underlying mechanism remains unknown. By morphometric analysis of cortical interneurons generated from DS and euploid induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), we found that DS GABA neurons are smaller and with fewer neuronal processes. The proportion of calretinin over calbindin GABA neurons is reduced, and the neuronal migration capacity is decreased. Such phenotypes were replicated following transplantation of the DS GABAergic progenitors into the mouse medial septum. Gene expression profiling revealed altered cell migratory pathways, and correction of the PAK1 pathway mitigated the cell migration deficit in vitro. These results suggest that impaired migration of DS GABAergic neurons may contribute to the reduced number of interneurons in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus in DS patients.

Abstract: Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) signaling via G protein-coupled LPA receptors mediates various biological effects in cancer cells. This study aimed to investigate the roles of LPA receptors in the regulation of cellular functions during tumor progression in osteosarcoma cells. Long-term cisplatin (CDDP)-treated MG63-C and MG63-R7-C cells were generated from osteosarcoma MG-63 and highly-migratory MG63-R7 cells, respectively. LPAR2 and LPAR3 expression levels were significantly higher in MG63-C cells than in MG-63 cells, while LPAR1 expression was reduced. MG63-C cells were highly motile, compared with MG-63 cells. MG63-C cell motility was suppressed by LPA2 knockdown and enhanced by the LPA1/LPA3 antagonist, dioctanoylglycerol pyrophosphate. LPAR2 and LPAR3 expression levels were significantly elevated in MG63-R7-C cells in comparison with MG63-R7 cells. MG63-R7-C cells were found to be highly invasive, correlating with metalloproteinase-2 activation. MG63-R7-C cells formed large colonies, whereas colony formation was absent from MG63-R7 cells. Notably, MG63-R7-C cell activities were inhibited by LPA2 knockdown. These results suggest that LPA signaling via LPA2 plays an important role in the acquisition of malignant properties during tumor progression in MG-63 cells.

Abstract: Distal airway stem cells (DASCs) in the mouse lung can differentiate into bronchioles and alveoli. However, it remains unclear whether the same stem cells exist in the human lung. Here, we found that human lung epithelial (HuL) cells, derived from normal, peripheral lung tissue, in monolayer, mostly express both the N-terminally truncated isoform of p63 (∆Np63), a marker for airway basal cells, and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), a marker for alveolar epithelial cells, even though these two molecules are usually expressed in a mutually exclusive way. Three-dimensionally cultured HuL cells differentiated to form bronchiole-like and alveolus-like organoids. We also uncovered a few bronchiolar epithelial cells expressing both ∆Np63 and TTF-1 in the human lung, suggesting that these cells are the cells of origin for HuL cells. Taken together, ΔNp63+ TTF-1+ peripheral airway epithelial cells are possibly the human counterpart of mouse DASCs and may offer potential for future regenerative medicine.

Abstract: GLUT4 is unique among specialized glucose transporters in being exclusively expressed in muscle and adipocytes. In the absence of insulin the distribution of GLUT4 is preferentially intracellular and insulin stimulation results in the movement of GLUT4 containing vesicles to the plasma membrane. This process is responsible for the insulin stimulation of glucose uptake in muscle and fat. While signalling pathways triggering the translocation of GLUT4 are well understood, the mechanisms regulating the intracellular retention of GLUT4 are less well understood. Here we report a role for β-catenin in this process. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes in which β-catenin is depleted, the levels of GLUT4 at and near the plasma membrane rise in unstimulated cells while the subsequent increase in GLUT4 at the plasma membrane upon insulin stimulation is reduced. Small molecule approaches to acutely activate or inhibit β-catenin give results that support the results obtained with siRNA and these changes are accompanied by matching changes in glucose transport into these cells. Together these results indicate that β-catenin is a previously unrecognized regulator of the mechanisms that control the insulin sensitive pool of GLUT4 transporters inside these adipocyte cells.

Abstract: Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), a pivotal component of the tumor microenvironment, contribute to tumor growth and metastasis. PSC-derived factors are essential for triggering the generation and maintenance of cancer stem cells (CSCs). However, the mechanisms by which paracrine signals regulate CSC-like properties such as glycolytic metabolism have not been fully elucidated. Here, we report that two pancreatic cancer cell lines, Panc-1 and MiaPaCa-2, reacted differently when treated with hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) secreted from PSCs. MiaPaCa-2 cells showed little response with regard to CSC-like properties after HGF treatment. We have shown that in Panc-1 cells by activating its cognate receptor c-MET, paracrine HGF resulted in YAP nuclear translocation and HIF-1α stabilization, thereby promoting the expression of CSC pluripotency markers NANOG, OCT-4 and SOX-2 and tumor sphere formation ability. Furthermore, HGF/c-MET/YAP/HIF-1α signaling enhanced the expression of Hexokinase 2 (HK2) and promoted glycolytic metabolism, which may facilitate CSC-like properties. Collectively, our study demonstrated that HGF/c-MET modulates tumor metabostemness by regulating YAP/HIF-1α and may hold promise as a potential therapeutic target against pancreatic cancer.

Abstract: Dysfunction of the microRNA (miRNA) network has been emerging as a main regulator in ischemic stroke. Recently, studies have linked the deregulation of miR-122 to ischemic stroke. However, the specific role and molecular mechanism of miR-122 in ischemic stroke remain to be further investigated. Here, we found that miR-122 was decreased in mouse N2A neuroblastoma (N2A) cells after oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and mouse brain after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). OGD treatment significantly increased N2A cell death and Caspase-3 activity, and decreased Bcl-2 protein expression. In addition, MCAO treatment induced severe mouse brain infarction, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and long-term neurological deficit. Gain-of-miR-122 function significantly suppressed OGD- and MCAO-induced injures in vitro and in vivo. Subsequently, miR-122 was validated to directly bind to the predicted 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of FOXO3 gene, and the inhibitory effects of miR-122 on ischemic injury in vitro and in vivo were overturned by FOXO3 overexpression. Moreover, our results further revealed that miR-122-FOXO3 axis functioned via the heat shock protein 70 (HSP-70)-mediated NF-κB pathway. Collectively, our data suggest that miR-122 inhibits ischemic neuronal death through the HSP-70-dependent NF-κB pathway by targeting FOXO3. These findings raise the possibility that this regulatory net may contribute to the pathogenesis of the ischemic brain injury in stroke.

Abstract: The use of mice that are mosaic for reporter gene expression underlies many lineage-tracing studies in stem cell biology. For example, using mosaic LacZ reporter mice, it was shown that limbal epithelial stem cells (LESCs) around the periphery of the cornea maintain radial sectors of the corneal epithelium and that radial stripe numbers declined with age. Originally, the corneal results were interpreted as progressive, age-related loss or irreversible inactivation of some LESC clones. In this study we used computer simulations to show that these results could also be explained by stochastic replacement of LESCs by neighbouring LESCs, leading to neutral drift of LESC populations. This was shown to reduce the number of coherent clones of LESCs and hence would coarsen the mosaic pattern in the corneal epithelium without reducing the absolute number of LESCs. Simulations also showed that corrected stripe numbers declined more slowly when LESCs were grouped non-randomly and that mosaicism was rarely lost unless simulated LESC numbers were unrealistically low. Possible reasons why age-related changes differ between mosaic corneal epithelia and other systems, such as adrenal cortices and intestinal crypts, are discussed.

Abstract: Apical and basolateral cell membranes are separated by tight junctions (TJs). Microvilli are limited to the apical cell membrane. TJs and microvilli are the landmarks for epithelial cell polarity. However, the direct relationship between TJ proteins (TJPs) and the components of microvilli remains unclear. In this study, we investigated whether occludin, which is considered to be a functional TJP, is involved in microvillus formation. In occludin knockout mouse hepatic cells (OcKO cells), the microvillus density was less than that in wild-type (WT) cells and the length of microvilli was short. Immunoreactivity of ezrin was decreased in OcKO cells compared with that in WT cells. Although there was no change in the expression level of ezrin, phosphorylation of ezrin was decreased in OcKO cells. The microvillus density and the length of microvilli were increased in OcKO cells by transfection of full-length mouse occludin and COOH-terminal domains of occludin. These results suggested that occludin induced microvillus formation via phosphorylation of ezrin and that the COOH-terminal domain of occludin, which is localized in non-TJ areas, might be able to induce microvilli formation. Our results provide new insights into the function of occludin.

Abstract: The canonical function of small heat-shock proteins (sHSPs) is to interact with proteins destabilized under conditions of cellular stress. While the breadth of interactions made by many sHSPs is well-known, there is currently little knowledge about what structural features of the interactors form the basis for their recognition. Here, we have identified 83 in vivo interactors of the sole sHSP in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, HSP16.6, reflective of stable associations with soluble proteins made under heat-shock conditions. By performing bioinformatic analyses on these interactors, we identify primary and secondary structural elements that are enriched relative to expectations from the cyanobacterial genome. In addition, by examining the Synechocystis interactors and comparing them with those identified to bind sHSPs in other prokaryotes, we show that sHSPs associate with specific proteins and biological processes. Our data are therefore consistent with a picture of sHSPs being broadly specific molecular chaperones that act to protect multiple cellular pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Although skeletal muscle cells can be generated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), transgene-free protocols include only limited options for their purification and expansion. In this study, we found that fluorescence-activated cell sorting-purified myogenic progenitors generated from healthy controls and Pompe disease iPSCs can be robustly expanded as much as 5 × 1011-fold. At all steps during expansion, cells could be cryopreserved or differentiated into myotubes with a high fusion index. In vitro, cells were amenable to maturation into striated and contractile myofibers. Insertion of acid α-glucosidase cDNA into the AAVS1 locus in iPSCs using CRISPR/Cas9 prevented glycogen accumulation in myotubes generated from a patient with classic infantile Pompe disease. In vivo, the expression of human-specific nuclear and sarcolemmar antigens indicated that myogenic progenitors engraft into murine muscle to form human myofibers. This protocol is useful for modeling of skeletal muscle disorders and for using patient-derived, gene-corrected cells to develop cell-based strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Although the functional roles of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been increasingly identified, few lncRNAs that control the naïve state of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are known. Here, we report a naïve-state-associated lncRNA, LincU, which is intrinsically activated by Nanog in mESCs. LincU-deficient mESCs exhibit a primed-like pluripotent state and potentiate the transition from the naïve state to the primed state, whereas ectopic LincU expression maintains mESCs in the naïve state. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that LincU binds and stabilizes the DUSP9 protein, an ERK-specific phosphatase, and then constitutively inhibits the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, which critically contributes to maintenance of the naïve state. Importantly, we reveal the functional role of LincU to be evolutionarily conserved in human. Therefore, our findings unveil LincU as a conserved lncRNA that intrinsically restricts MAPK/ERK activity and maintains the naïve state of ESCs.

Abstract: Summary
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) interacts through its extracellular domain with seven different growth factors. These factors induce different structures within the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane (JM) segment of the dimeric receptor and propagate different growth factor-dependent signals to the cell interior. How this process occurs is unknown. Here we apply diverse experimental and computational tools to show that growth factor identity is encoded by the EGFR transmembrane (TM) helix into discrete helix dimer populations that differ in both cross-location and cross-angle. Helix dimers with smaller cross-angles at multiple cross locations are decoded to induce an EGF-type coiled coil in the adjacent JM, whereas helix dimers with larger cross-angles at fewer cross locations induce the TGF-α-type coiled coil. We propose an updated model for how conformational coupling across multiple EGFR domains results in growth factor-specific information transfer, and demonstrate that this model applies to both EGFR and the related receptor ErbB2.

Abstract: Summary
Early endoderm progenitors naturally possess robust propagating potential to develop a majority of meter-long gastrointestinal tracts and are therefore considered as a promising source for therapy. Here, we demonstrated the reproducible generation of human CDX2+ posterior gut endoderm cells (PGECs) from five induced pluripotent stem cell clones by manipulating FGF, TGF, and WNT signaling. Transcriptome analysis suggested that putative PGECs harbored an intermediate signature profile between definitive endoderm and organ-specific endoderm. We found that combinatorial EGF, VEGF, FGF2, Chir99021, and A83-01 treatments selectively amplify storable PGECs up to 1021 cell scale without any gene transduction or feeder use. PGECs, compared with induced pluripotent stem cells, showed stable differentiation propensity into multiple endodermal lineages without teratoma formation. Furthermore, transplantation of PGEC-derived liver bud organoids showed therapeutic potential against fulminant liver failure. Together, the robustly amplified PGECs may be a promising cellular source for endoderm-derived organoids in studying human development, modeling disease, and, ultimately, therapy.

Abstract: Guanylate-binding protein-1 (GBP-1) is an interferon-inducible large GTPase involved in the epithelial barrier at tight junctions. To investigate the role of GBP-1 in the epithelial barrier, primary human salivary gland duct epithelial cells were treated with the the proinflammatory cytokines IFNγ, IL-1β, TNFα and the growth factor TGF-β. Treatment with IFNγ, IL-1β, or TNFα markedly enhanced GBP-1 and the epithelial barrier function, and induced not only CLDN-7 but also the tricellular tight junction molecule lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR). Knockdown of GBP-1 by its siRNA induced endocytosis of tight junction molecules, and prevented the increases of CLDN-7 and LSR with the upregulation of the epithelial barrier function induced by treatment with IFNγ or TNFα. Treatment with a PKCα inhibitor induced expression of GBP-1, CLDN-7 and LSR and enhanced the epithelial barrier function. In almost intact salivary gland ducts from patients with IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) indicated significant infiltration of IgG-positive plasma cells, expression of GBP-1, CLDN-7 and LSR was increased. These findings indicated that GBP-1 might play a crucial role in barrier function of normal human salivary gland duct epithelium and perform a preventive role in the duct epithelium of IgG4-RD disease.

Abstract: Summary
Intracellular signals triggered by DNA breakage flow through proteins containing BRCT (BRCA1 C-terminal) domains. This family, comprising 23 conserved phosphopeptide-binding modules in man, is inaccessible to small-molecule chemical inhibitors. Here, we develop Bractoppin, a drug-like inhibitor of phosphopeptide recognition by the human BRCA1 tandem (t)BRCT domain, which selectively inhibits substrate binding with nanomolar potency in vitro. Structure-activity exploration suggests that Bractoppin engages BRCA1 tBRCT residues recognizing pSer in the consensus motif, pSer-Pro-Thr-Phe, plus an abutting hydrophobic pocket that is distinct in structurally related BRCT domains, conferring selectivity. In cells, Bractoppin inhibits substrate recognition detected by Förster resonance energy transfer, and diminishes BRCA1 recruitment to DNA breaks, in turn suppressing damage-induced G2 arrest and assembly of the recombinase, RAD51. But damage-induced MDC1 recruitment, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) generation, and TOPBP1 recruitment remain unaffected. Thus, an inhibitor of phosphopeptide recognition selectively interrupts BRCA1 tBRCT-dependent signals evoked by DNA damage.

Abstract: The host actin cytoskeleton is utilized by an assortment of pathogenic bacteria to colonize and cause disease in their hosts. Two prominently studied actin-hijacking bacteria are enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and Listeria monocytogenes. EPEC form actin-rich pedestals atop its host cells to move across the intestinal epithelia, while Listeria monocytogenes generate branched actin networks arranged as actin clouds around the bacteria and as comet tails for propulsion within and amongst their host cells. Previous mass spectrometry analysis revealed that a member of the calponin family of actin-bundling proteins, transgelin/SM22 was enriched in EPEC pedestals. To validate that finding and examine the role of SM22 during infections, we initially immunolocalized SM22 in EPEC and L. monocytogenes infected cells, used siRNA to deplete SM22 and EGFP-SM22 to overexpress SM22, then quantified the alterations to the bacterially generated actin structures. SM22 concentrated at all bacterially-generated actin structures. Depletion of SM22 resulted in fewer pedestals and comet tails and caused comet tails to shorten. The decrease in comet tail abundance caused a proportional increase in actin clouds whereas overexpression of SM22 reversed the actin cloud to comet tail proportions and increased comet tail length, while not influencing EPEC pedestal abundance. Thus, we demonstrate that SM22 plays a role in regulating the transitions and morphological appearance of bacterially generated actin-rich structures during infections.

Abstract: Neutrophil cytosolic factor 4 (NCF4) is a member of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase subunit. This protein functions as an essential factor in the host defense against the progression of bacterial infection. To explore the variability of the NCF4 gene and the susceptibility of cows to mastitis, NCF4 functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) and its targeted microRNA (miRNA) were identified. One SNP g.18475 A>G in the 3′UTR of NCF4 was found within the binding seed region of bta-miR-2426. We constructed two recombinant pMIR-REPORT™ vectors with the A or G allele in the g.18475 locus and transiently co-transfected the vectors in human embryo kidney 293T (HEK 293T) cells, along with bta-miR-2426 mimics. A luciferase assay indicated that this SNP affects the binding of NCF4 and bta-miR-2426. In addition, the association analysis results showed that cows with the GG genotype in SNP g.18475 A>G had a relatively lower SCS value than cows with the AA genotype. Finally, quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) results showed that the cows with genotype GG had a relatively higher expression of NCF4 mRNA compared to the cows with genotype AA. NCF4 expression was regulated by the miRNA–mRNA interaction mechanism, and an important role for NCF4 in mastitis susceptibility in dairy cow was suggested.

Abstract: For reasons not completely clear, natural killer (NK) cells from tumor patients displayed multiple exhaustion features and could not be completely restored even when the inhibitory signals from the intratumoral environment had ceased to exist. Here, we found that the circulating NK cells from bladder cancer patients presented significantly reduced cytotoxicity than the circulating NK cells from healthy volunteers. This impairment in cytotoxicity resulted in part from an overrepresentation of Tim-3+ NK cells in bladder cancer patients. Interestingly, patients with higher frequency of Tim-3+ NK cells tended to present higher frequency of Gal-9+ cells in tumor. Exogenous Gal-9 significantly reduced the cytotoxicity of Tim-3+, but not Tim-3-, NK cells. Patients with better prognosis presented lower levels of Tim-3+ NK cells and Gal-9+ tumor cells. We then attempted to improve the cytotoxicity of NK cells using a combination of exogenous cytokines. IL-2 + IL-15 and IL-2 + IL-21 significantly enhanced, but could not completely restore, the cytotoxicity of NK cells in bladder cancer patients. Notably, when the cytokine concentration increased from intermediate levels to high levels, the cytotoxicity of NK cells from healthy volunteers significantly increased with a strong upward trend, whereas the cytotoxicity of NK cells from bladder cancer patients plateaued at intermediate levels. Further examination revealed that high cytokine concentration significantly increased the Tim-3 expression in NK cells from bladder cancer patients. Blocking Tim-3 not only improved the cytotoxicity of NK cells from bladder cancer patients, but also eliminated the plateauing effect when the NK cells were stimulated with high concentrations of cytokines. Together, these data suggested that proinflammatory cytokines could moderately improve NK cell cytotoxicity in bladder cancer patients. However, the effect was limited due to a concurrent upregulation of Tim-3.

Abstract: Zebrafish pou5f3 (previously named pou2), a close homologue of mouse Oct4, encodes a PouV-family transcription factor. pou5f3 has been implicated in diverse aspects of developmental regulation during embryogenesis. In the present study, we addressed the molecular function of Pou5f3 as a transcriptional regulator and the mechanism by which pou5f3 expression is transcriptionally regulated. We examined the influence of effector genes on the expression of the luciferase gene under the control of the upstream 2.1-kb regulatory DNA of pou5f3 (Luc-2.2) in HEK293T and P19 cells. We first confirmed that Pou5f3 functions as a transcriptional activator both in cultured cells and embryos, which confirmed autoregulation of pou5f3 in embryos. It was further shown that Luc-2.2 was activated synergistically by pou5f3 and sox3, which is similar to the co-operative activity of Oct4 and Sox2 in mice, although synergy between pou5f3 and sox2 was less obvious in this zebrafish system. The effects of pou5f3 deletion constructs on the regulation of Luc-2.2 expression revealed different roles for the three subregions of the N-terminal region in Pou5f3 in terms of its regulatory functions and co-operativity with Sox3. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed that Pou5f3 and Sox3 proteins specifically bind to adjacent sites in the 2.1-kb DNA and that there is an interaction between the two proteins. The synergy with sox3 was unique to pou5f3—the other POU factor genes examined did not show such synergy in Luc-2.2 regulation. Finally, functional interaction was observed between pou5f3 and sox3 in embryos in terms of the regulation of dorsoventral patterning and convergent extension movement. These findings together demonstrate co-operative functions of pou5f3 and sox3, which are frequently coexpressed in early embryos, in the regulation of early development.

Abstract: Summary
Invasive fungal infections are accompanied by high mortality rates that range up to 90%. At present, only three different compound classes are available for use in the clinic, and these often suffer from low bioavailability, toxicity, and drug resistance. These issues emphasize an urgent need for novel antifungal agents. Herein, we report the identification of chemically versatile benzamide and picolinamide scaffolds with antifungal properties. Chemogenomic profiling and biochemical assays with purified protein identified Sec14p, the major phosphatidylinositol/phosphatidylcholine transfer protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as the sole essential target for these compounds. A functional variomics screen identified resistance-conferring residues that localized to the lipid-binding pocket of Sec14p. Determination of the X-ray co-crystal structure of a Sec14p-compound complex confirmed binding in this cavity and rationalized both the resistance-conferring residues and the observed structure-activity relationships. Taken together, these findings open new avenues for rational compound optimization and development of novel antifungal agents.

Abstract: Summary
Drosophila POU/Oct transcription factors are required for many developmental processes, but their putative regulation of adult stem cell activity has not been investigated. Here, we show that Nubbin (Nub)/Pdm1, homologous to mammalian OCT1/POU2F1 and related to OCT4/POU5F1, is expressed in gut epithelium progenitor cells. We demonstrate that the nub-encoded protein isoforms, Nub-PB and Nub-PD, play opposite roles in the regulation of intestinal stem cell (ISC) maintenance and differentiation. Depletion of Nub-PB in progenitor cells increased ISC proliferation by derepression of escargot expression. Conversely, loss of Nub-PD reduced ISC proliferation, suggesting that this isoform is necessary for ISC maintenance, analogous to mammalian OCT4/POU5F1 functions. Furthermore, Nub-PB is required in enteroblasts to promote differentiation, and it acts as a tumor suppressor of Notch RNAi-driven hyperplasia. We suggest that a dynamic and well-tuned expression of Nub isoforms in progenitor cells is required for maintaining gut epithelium homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), one of the most lethal genetic disorders, involves progressive muscle degeneration resulting from the absence of DYSTROPHIN. Lack of DYSTROPHIN expression in DMD has critical consequences in muscle satellite stem cells including a reduced capacity to generate myogenic precursors. Here, we demonstrate that the c-isoform of PITX2 transcription factor modifies the myogenic potential of dystrophic-deficient satellite cells. We further show that PITX2c enhances the regenerative capability of mouse DYSTROPHIN-deficient satellite cells by increasing cell proliferation and the number of myogenic committed cells, but importantly also increasing dystrophin-positive (revertant) myofibers by regulating miR-31. These PITX2-mediated effects finally lead to improved muscle function in dystrophic (DMD/mdx) mice. Our studies reveal a critical role for PITX2 in skeletal muscle repair and may help to develop therapeutic strategies for muscular disorders.

Abstract: Schwann cell apoptosis is one of the characteristics of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a multifunctional signaling pathway that regulates cell apoptosis in various types of tissues and cells. To investigate whether the mTOR pathway is involved in cell apoptosis in the Schwann cells of DPN, diabetic mice and rat Schwann cells (RSC96) were chosen to detect phospho-mTOR (Ser 2448), phospho-S6K1 (Thr 389), phospho-4EBP1 (Thr 37/46), Bcl-2, Bax and cleaved caspase-3 by diverse pathological and biological techniques. The results showed that phospho-mTOR (Ser 2448) was decreased in the sciatic nerves of diabetic mice, concomitant with decreased Bcl-2, increased Bax, cleaved caspase-3 and cell apoptosis. In addition, high glucose treatment for 72 h caused a 35.95% decrease in the phospho-mTOR (Ser 2448)/mTOR ratio, a 65.50% decrease in the phospho-S6K1 (Thr 389)/S6K1 ratio, a 3.67-fold increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and a 1.47-fold increase in the cleaved caspase-3/caspase-3 ratio. Furthermore, mTORC1 inhibition, rather than mTORC2 inhibition, resulted in mitochondrial controlled apoptosis in RSC96 cells by silencing RAPTOR or RICTOR. Again, suppression of the mTORC1 pathway by a chemical inhibitor led to mitochondrial controlled apoptosis in cultured RSC96 cells in vitro. By contrast, activation of the mTORC1 pathway with MHY1485 prevented decreased phospho-S6K1 (Thr 389) levels caused by high glucose and cell apoptosis. Additionally, constitutive activation of S6K1 avoided high glucose-induced cell apoptosis in RSC96 cells. In summary, our findings suggest that activating mTORC1/S6K1 signaling in Schwann cells may be a promising strategy for the prevention and treatment of DPN.

Abstract: The bZIP transcription factor E4BP4 is a survival factor that is known to be elevated in diseased heart and promote cell survival. In this study the role of E4BP4 on angiotensin-II (AngII)-induced apoptosis has been examined in in vitro cell model. H9c2 cardiomyoblast cells that overexpressed E4BP4 were exposed to AngII to observe the cardio-protective effects of E4BP4 on hypertension related apoptosis. The results from TUNEL assays revealed that E4BP4 significantly attenuated AngII-induced apoptosis. Further analysis by Western blot and RT-PCR showed that E4BP4 inhibited AngII-induced IGF-II mRNA expression and cleavage of caspase-3 through the PI3K-Akt pathway. In addition, E4BP4 enhanced calcium reuptake into the sacroplasmic reticulum by down-regulating PP2A and by up-regulating the phosphorylation of PKA and PLB proteins. Our findings indicate that E4BP4 functions as a survival factor in cardiomyoblasts by inhibiting IGF-II transcription and by regulating calcium cycling.

Abstract: Extracellular Hsp70 (eHsp70) can act as damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) via Toll-like receptors TLR2 and TLR4, and stimulate immune and inflammatory responses leading to sterile inflammation and propagation of already existing inflammation. It was found elevated in the blood of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), who might suffer occasional bacterial colonizations and infections. We used a monocytic THP-1 cell line as a cellular model of systemic compartment of COPD to assess inflammatory effects of eHsp70 when present alone or together with bacterial products lypopolysaccharide (LPS) and lypoteichoic acid (LTA). THP-1 cells were differentiated into macrophage-like cells and treated with various concentrations of recombinant human Hsp70 protein (rhHsp70), LPS (TLR4 agonist), LTA (TLR2 agonist), and their combinations for 4, 12, 24, and 48 h. Concentrations of IL-1α, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α were determined by ELISA. Cell viability was assessed by MTS assay, and mode of cell death by luminometric measurements of caspases-3/7, -8, and -9 activities. rhHsp70 showed cell protecting effect by suppressing caspases-3/7 activation, while LPS provoked cytotoxicity through caspases-8 and -3/7 pathway. Regarding inflammatory processes, rhHsp70 alone induced secretion of IL-1α and IL-8, but had modulatory effects on release of all four cytokines when applied together with LPS or LTA. Combined effect with LPS was mainly synergistic, and with LTA mainly antagonistic, although it was cytokine- and time-dependent. Our results confirmed pro-inflammatory function of extracellular Hsp70, and suggest its possible implication in COPD exacerbations caused by bacterial infection through desensitization or inappropriate activation of TLR2 and TLR4 receptors.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular replacement therapies for neurological conditions use human embryonic stem cell (hESC)- or induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neurons to replace damaged or diseased populations of neurons. For the spinal cord, significant progress has been made generating the in-vitro-derived motor neurons required to restore coordinated movement. However, there is as yet no protocol to generate in-vitro-derived sensory interneurons (INs), which permit perception of the environment. Here, we report on the development of a directed differentiation protocol to derive sensory INs for both hESCs and hiPSCs. Two developmentally relevant factors, retinoic acid in combination with bone morphogenetic protein 4, can be used to generate three classes of sensory INs: the proprioceptive dI1s, the dI2s, and mechanosensory dI3s. Critical to this protocol is the competence state of the neural progenitors, which changes over time. This protocol will facilitate developing cellular replacement therapies to reestablish sensory connections in injured patients.

Abstract: Summary
In both academia and the pharmaceutical industry, large-scale assays for drug discovery are expensive and often impractical, particularly for the increasingly important physiologically relevant model systems that require primary cells, organoids, whole organisms, or expensive or rare reagents. We hypothesized that data from a single high-throughput imaging assay can be repurposed to predict the biological activity of compounds in other assays, even those targeting alternate pathways or biological processes. Indeed, quantitative information extracted from a three-channel microscopy-based screen for glucocorticoid receptor translocation was able to predict assay-specific biological activity in two ongoing drug discovery projects. In these projects, repurposing increased hit rates by 50- to 250-fold over that of the initial project assays while increasing the chemical structure diversity of the hits. Our results suggest that data from high-content screens are a rich source of information that can be used to predict and replace customized biological assays.

However, little is known about the final steps of their biosynthesis, in which diverse building blocks from primary metabolism are attached to glycosides of the dideoxysugar ascarylose, the ascarosides. We combine metabolomic analysis of natural isolates of P. pacificus with genome-wide association mapping to identify a putative carboxylesterase, Ppa-uar-1, that is required for attachment of a pyrimidine-derived moiety in the biosynthesis of ubas#1, a major dauer pheromone component. Comparative metabolomic analysis of wild-type and Ppa-uar-1 mutants showed that Ppa-uar-1 is required specifically for the biosynthesis of ubas#1 and related metabolites. Heterologous expression of Ppa-UAR-1 in C. elegans yielded a non-endogenous ascaroside, whose structure confirmed that Ppa-uar-1 is involved in modification of a specific position in ascarosides. Our study demonstrates the utility of natural variation-based approaches for uncovering biosynthetic pathways.

Abstract: Chronic diseases are characterized by the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such than TNF-α and are frequently correlated with muscle wasting conditions. Among the pleiotropic effects of TNF-α within the cell, its binding to TNFR1 receptor has been shown to activate sphingomyelinases leading to the production of ceramides. Sphingomyelinases and TNF receptor have been localized within caveolae which are specialized RAFT enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids. Because of their inverted omega shape, maintained by the oligomerization of specialized proteins, caveolins and cavins, caveolae serve as membrane reservoir therefore providing mechanical protection to plasma membranes. Although sphingolipids metabolites, caveolins and TNF-α/TNFR1 have been shown to independently interfere with muscle physiology, no data have clearly demonstrated their concerted action on muscle cell regeneration. In this context, our study aimed at studying the molecular mechanisms induced by TNF-α at the level of caveolae in LHCN-M2 human muscle satellite cells. Here we showed that TNF-α-induced production of ROS and nSMase activation requires caveolin. More strikingly, we have demonstrated that TNF-α induces the formation of additional caveolae at the plasma membrane of myoblasts. Furthermore, TNF-α prevents myoblast fusion suggesting that inflammation could modulate caveolae organization/function and satellite cell function.

Abstract: Angiogenesis is a process encompassing several steps such as endothelial cells proliferation, differentiation and migration to form a vascular network, involving different signal transduction pathways. Among these, ERK1/2 signaling mediates VEGF-dependent signaling pathway. Here we report that the water extract of Ruta graveolens (RGWE), widely known as a medicinal plant, is able to impair in a dose-dependent manner, cell network formation without affecting cell viability. Biochemical analysis showed that the major component of RGWE is rutin, unable to reproduce RGWE effect. We found that RGWE inhibits ERK1/2 phosphorylation and that this event is crucial in cell network formation since the transfection of HUVEC with a constitutively active MEK (caMEK), the ERK1/2 activator, induces a robust cell network formation as compared to untransfected and/or mock transfected cells and, more importantly, caMEK transfected cells became unresponsive to RGWE. Moreover, RGWE inhibits VEGF and nestin gene expression, necessary for vessel formation, and the caMEK transfection induces their higher expression. In conclusion, we report that RGWE is able to significantly impair vessels network formation without affecting cell viability, preventing ERK1/2 activation and, in turn, down-regulating VEGF and nestin expression. These findings point to RGWE as a potential therapeutic tool capable to interfere with pathologic angiogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Arterial diseases continue to pose a major health concern but in vitro studies are limited because explanted cells can exhibit poor proliferative capacity and a loss of specificity. Here, we find that two transcription factors, MYCN and SOX17, induce and indefinitely expand in culture precursors of human arterial endothelial cells (expandable arterial endothelial precursors [eAEPs]). The eAEPs are derived from CD34+ cells found in umbilical cord blood or adult bone marrow. Independent eAEP lines differ in their proclivity to undergo an endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT), a hallmark event in a broad array of vascular diseases and disorders. Some cell lines spontaneously become mesenchymal over time in culture, an effect exacerbated by inhibition of the fibroblast growth factor receptor, while others do not readily convert. These distinctions were exploited to identify genes that correlate with resistance to an EndoMT and to elucidate transcriptional changes that underpin the transition.

Abstract: Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) have been described in naïve or primed pluripotent states. Domestic dogs are useful translational models in regenerative medicine, but their embryonic stem cells (cESCs) remain narrowly investigated. Primed-like cESCs expanded in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor and fibroblast growth factor 2 (LIF-FGF2) acquire features of naïve pluripotency when exposed to chemical inhibitors and LIF (2iL). However, proliferation of cESCs is influenced by the pluripotent state and is comparatively slower than human or mouse PSCs. We propose that different metabolic pathway activities support ATP generation and biomass accumulation necessary for LIF-FGF2 and 2iL cESC proliferation. We found that 2iL cESCs have greater respiratory capacity, altered mitochondrial chain complex stoichiometry and elevated mitochondrial polarization state. Yet, 2iL-enriched cESCs exhibited immature ultrastructure, including previously unrecognized changes to cristae organization. Enhanced ATP level in 2iL cESCs is associated with altered retrograde signalling, whereas LIF-FGF2 cESCs exhibit a lipogenic phenotype. Inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation impaired proliferation and ATP production in 2iL cESCs but not LIF-FGF2 cESCs, which remained sensitive to glycolysis inhibition. Our study reveals distinct bioenergetic mechanisms contributing to steady-state expansion of distinct canine pluripotent states that can be exploited to improve derivation and culture of canine PSCs.

Abstract: Diacylglycerol lipase alpha (DAGLA), which catalyzes the hydrolysis of diacylglycerol to 2-arachidonoylglycerol and free fatty acid, is required for axonal growth during the brain development and for retrograde synaptic signaling at mature synapses. So far, no information was found regarding the possible role of DAGLA in human tumorigenesis. Thus, the current study sought to clarify the contribution of DAGLA in oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs) and assess the clinical possibilities for OSCC treatment. Using real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry, we found a significant up-regulation of DAGLA in OSCCs compared with normal cells and tissues both at mRNA and protein expression levels. Knockdown models in OSCC-derived cell lines for DAGLA (siDAGLA) and treatment with a lipase inhibitor (orlistat) showed several depressed cellular functions, including cellular proliferation and migratory activities through cell-cycle arrest at G1 phase. Furthermore, we found that DAGLA-positive OSCC samples were correlated highly with the primary tumoral size. We concluded that DAGLA may be a key determinant in tumoral progression and might be a therapeutic target for OSCCs.

Abstract: Primary rodent neurons and immortalised cell lines have overwhelmingly been used for in vitro studies of traumatic injury to peripheral and central neurons, but have some limitations of physiological accuracy. Motor neurons (MN) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) enable the generation of cell models with features relevant to human physiology. To facilitate this, it is desirable that MN protocols both rapidly and efficiently differentiate human iPSCs into electrophysiologically active MNs. In this study, we present a simple, rapid protocol for differentiation of human iPSCs into functional spinal (lower) MNs, involving only adherent culture and use of small molecules for directed differentiation, with the ultimate aim of rapid production of electrophysiologically functional cells for short-term neural injury experiments. We show successful differentiation in two unrelated iPSC lines, by quantifying neural-specific marker expression, and by evaluating cell functionality at different maturation stages by calcium imaging and patch clamping. Differentiated neurons were shown to be electrophysiologically altered by uniaxial mechanical deformation. Spontaneous network activity decreased with applied stretch, indicating aberrant network connectivity. These results demonstrate the feasibility of this rapid, simple protocol for differentiating iPSC-derived MNs, suitable for in vitro neural injury studies focussing on electrophysiological alterations caused by mechanical deformation or trauma.

Abstract: Heat shock factor 4 controls the transcription of small heat shock proteins (e.g., HSP25, alpha B-cyrstallin, and r-crystallin), that play important roles in modulating lens proteostasis. However, the molecular mechanism underlying HSF4-mediated transcription is still unclear. Using yeast two hybrid, we found that HSF4 interacts with the ATP-dependent DEXD/H-box RNA helicase UAP56, and their interaction in lens epithelial cell line was further confirmed by GST-pull down assay. UAP56 is a vital regulator of pre-mRNA splicing and mature mRNA nuclear export. The immunofluorescence assay showed that HSF4 and UBA56 co-localize with each other in the nucleus of lens epithelial cells. Ectopic UAP56 upregulated HSF4-controlled HSP25 and alpha B-crystallin proteins expression, while knocking down UAP56 by shRNA reversed it. Moreover, UAP56 interacts with and facilitates the nuclear exportation of HSP25 and alpha B-crystallin mRNA without impacting their total mRNA expression level. In lens tissues, both UAP56 and HSF4 are expressed in the same nucleus of lens fiber cells, and their expression levels are simultaneously reduced with fiber cell maturation. Taken together, these data suggested that UAP56 is a novel regulator of HSF4 and might upregulate HSF4’s downstream mRNA maturation and nuclear exportation.

Abstract: Summary
Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) are two closely related flaviviruses that lead to different clinical outcomes. The mechanism for the distinct pathogenesis of ZIKV and DENV is poorly understood. Here, we investigate ZIKV and DENV infection of macrophages using a human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived macrophage model and discover key virus-specific responses. ZIKV and DENV productively infect hPSC-derived macrophages. DENV, but not ZIKV, infection of macrophages strongly activates macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) secretion and decreases macrophage migration. Neutralization of MIF leads to improved migratory ability of DENV-infected macrophages. In contrast, ZIKV-infected macrophages exhibit prolonged migration and express low levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Mechanistically, ZIKV disrupts the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-MIF positive feedback loop by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway. Our results demonstrate the utility of hPSC-derived macrophages in infectious disease modeling and suggest that the distinct impact of ZIKV and DENV on macrophage immune response may underlie different pathogenesis of Zika and dengue diseases.

Abstract: Competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) regulate RNA transcripts by competing for shared miRNAs and play critical roles in disease development. Psoriasis is a long-lasting, recurring chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by hyperproliferation of keratinocytes. The keratinocyte response is triggered by the activation of inflammatory cytokines, like interleukin-22 (IL-22). We used lncRNA array analysis to detect differentially expressed lncRNAs in skin (HaCaT) cells treated with or without IL-22. We used hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining to determine the pathological changes in skin cells and immunohistochemistry to evaluate the expression of S100A7. We used qRT-PCR and Western blotting to detect the expression levels of MSX2P1 and S100A7. We down-regulated the expression of MSX2P1 by infecting with lentiviral-vector shRNA. We measured cell proliferation, cell cycle status, and apoptosis by the CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry, and Annexin Ⅴ-FITC/PI staining, respectively. In addition, we used the luciferase reporter gene assay to determine the relationships between MSX2P1 or miR-6731-5p and S100A7, respectively. LncRNA array analysis revealed that 103 lncRNAs were up-regulated and 51 were down-regulated. Furthermore, qRT-PCR showed that the mRNAs levels of MSX2P1 was significantly altered in HaCaT cells treated with IL-22, compared with control cells; and MSX2P1 was mainly in the cytoplasm. Based on the IL-22-stimulated lncRNA-associated ceRNA network, we selected MSX2P1-miR-6731-5p-S100A7 for further study. H&E staining exhibited characteristic features specific to psoriatic lesions. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated significantly increased expression levels of S100A7 in psoriatic lesions, compared with normal skin tissue. We observed a positive correlation between lncRNA-MSX2P1 expression and S100A7 expression. In addition, miR-6731-5p suppressed proliferation, accelerated apoptosis in IL-22-stimulated keratinocytes, and decreased the expressions of S100A7, IL-12β, IL-23, HLA-C, CCHCR1, TNF-α, and NF-κB proteins. Our data demonstrated that MSX2P1 facilitate the progression and growth of IL-22-stimulated keratinocytes by inhibiting miR-6731-5p and activating S100A7. We speculate that the biological network of MSX2P1-miR-6731-5p-S100A7 is a potential novel therapeutic target for the future treatment of psoriasis.

Abstract: Summary
Pig cloning by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) remains extremely inefficient, and many cloned embryos undergo abnormal development. Here, by profiling transcriptome expression, we observed dysregulated chromosome-wide gene expression in every chromosome and identified a considerable number of genes that are aberrantly expressed in the abnormal cloned embryos. In particular, XIST, a long non-coding RNA gene, showed high ectopic expression in abnormal embryos. We also proved that nullification of the XIST gene in donor cells can normalize aberrant gene expression in cloned embryos and enhance long-term development capacity of the embryos. Furthermore, the increased quality of XIST-deficient embryos was associated with the global H3K9me3 reduction. Injection of H3K9me demethylase Kdm4A into NT embryos could improve the development of pre-implantation stage embryos. However, Kdm4A addition also induced XIST derepression in the active X chromosome and thus was not able to enhance the in vivo long-term developmental capacity of porcine NT embryos.

Abstract: Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved lysosomal degradation process, and is involved in various cellular processes. Here we studied the role of two pore channel 2 (TPC2), a lysosomal non-selective Na+/Ca2+ channel, in autophagy progression. We found that TPC overexpression in 4T1 mouse breast cancer cell line or in HeLa human cervical cancer cell line inhibited the fusion between autophagosome and lysosome, resulting in the accumulation of autophagosomes accompanied with increased lysosomal pH and TFEB nuclear localization. Interestingly, we also found that extracellular vesicle (EV) secretion was markedly decreased in TPC2 overexpressing cells but was induced in TPC2 knockdown cells. In addition, migration of TPC2 knockdown cells, not TPC2 overexpressing cells, was inhibited. Taken together, these results support a role of TPC2 in autophagy progression and EV trafficking in cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
Histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes regulate diverse biological function, including gene expression, rendering them potential targets for intervention in a number of diseases, with a handful of compounds approved for treatment of certain hematologic cancers. Among the human zinc-dependent HDACs, the most recently discovered member, HDAC11, is the only member assigned to subclass IV. It is the smallest protein and has the least well understood biological function. Here, we show that HDAC11 cleaves long-chain acyl modifications on lysine side chains with remarkable efficiency. We further show that several common types of HDAC inhibitors, including the approved drugs romidepsin and vorinostat, do not inhibit this enzymatic activity. Macrocyclic hydroxamic acid-containing peptides, on the other hand, potently inhibit HDAC11 demyristoylation activity. These findings should be taken carefully into consideration in future investigations of the biological function of HDAC11 and will serve as a foundation for the development of selective chemical probes targeting HDAC11.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreatic duct epithelial cells have been suggested as a source of progenitors for pancreatic growth and regeneration. However, genetic lineage-tracing experiments with pancreatic duct-specific Cre expression have given conflicting results. Using immunofluorescence and flow cytometry, we show heterogeneous expression of both HNF1β and SOX9 in adult human and murine ductal epithelium. Their expression was dynamic and diminished significantly after induced replication. Purified pancreatic duct cells formed organoid structures in 3D culture, and heterogeneity of expression of Hnf1β and Sox9 was maintained even after passaging. Using antibodies against a second cell surface molecule CD51 (human) or CD24 (mouse), we could isolate living subpopulations of duct cells enriched for high or low expression of HNF1β and SOX9. Only the CD24high (Hnfβ high/Sox9 high) subpopulation was able to form organoids.

Abstract: Continuous spermatogenesis in post-pubertal mammals is dependent on spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), which balance self-renewing divisions that maintain stem cell pool with differentiating divisions that sustain continuous sperm production. Rodent stem and progenitor spermatogonia are described by their clonal arrangement in the seminiferous epithelium (e.g., Asingle, Apaired or Aaligned spermatogonia), molecular markers (e.g., ID4, GFRA1, PLZF, SALL4 and others) and most importantly by their biological potential to produce and maintain spermatogenesis when transplanted into recipient testes. In contrast, stem cells in the testes of higher primates (nonhuman and human) are defined by description of their nuclear morphology and staining with hematoxylin as Adark and Apale spermatogonia. There is limited information about how dark and pale descriptions of nuclear morphology in higher primates correspond with clone size, molecular markers or transplant potential. Do the apparent differences in stem cells and spermatogenic lineage development between rodents and primates represent true biological differences or simply differences in the volume of research and the vocabulary that has developed over the past half century? This review will provide an overview of stem, progenitor and differentiating spermatogonia that support spermatogenesis; identifying parallels between rodents and primates where they exist as well as features unique to higher primates.

Abstract: The persistent proliferation of hypoxia-induced vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in the arterial wall underlie the development of atherosclerosis. However, the mechanism that regulates the behavior of VSMCs, which involve in actin aggregation, and impedes their migration is still elusive. Here, we report that bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) leads to enrichment of CD44 and F-actin stress fiber and secretion of matrix metalloproteinases-2 (MMP-2) during hypoxia in vitro and following artificial hypoxia-induced atherosclerosis exacerbation in vivo. To test this hypothesis, fluorescence immunostaining, immune-hybridization and flow cytometry analyses were performed to understand the relationship among BMP-2, CD44 and MMP-2 linkage. The cellular actin cytoskeleton was reduced, and smaller adhesion plaques were formed in hypoxia-induced T/G HA-VSMC cell line, but BMP-2 against disruption of F-actin and increase the motility and migration behaviors of VSMC during hypoxic cultured. Aggregation of F-actin dependents on the interaction between the cell surface integral membrane protein CD44 and Vinculin which enhanced by rBMP-2. This activity of Actin/CD44/ linkage was inhibited by competing with the active site of the CD44 using recombined the hemopexin-like C-terminal domain (PEX) of MMP-2. These results lead to the proliferation and migration of VSMCs were inhibited in response to MMP-2 activity when the cell is in a hypoxic environment. Collectively, our discovery indicates that BMP-2 could enhance migration and proliferation of hypoxia-induced VSMCs via the Actin/CD44/MMP-2 molecular pathway.

Here we have detected these sulfur species, making use of our observation that isolated yeast cytosol alone is unable to thiolate tRNAs but can do so upon addition of mitochondria. Mitochondria were found to utilize the cysteine desulfurase Nfs1 to produce sulfur-containing species with masses ranging from 700 to 1,100 Da. Mitochondria exported these species via the Atm1 transporter in the inner membrane. Once exported to the cytosol, these sulfur species promoted cytosolic tRNA thiolation with no further requirement of mitochondria. Furthermore, we found that the Isu1/2 scaffolds but not the Ssq1 chaperone of the mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster machinery were required for cytosolic tRNA thiolation, and thus the sulfur utilization pathway bifurcates at the Isu1/2 site for intra-organellar use in mitochondria or export to the cytosol.

Abstract: The present study was undertaken to study the effect of ammonia, urea, non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA), and β-hydroxybutyric acid (β-OHB) on oocyte development and granulosa cell (GC) growth parameter of ovine (Ovis aries). Ovine oocytes were matured in vitro in the presence of different concentration of ammonia, urea, NEFA, and β-OHB for 24 h, in vitro inseminated and evaluated for cleavage and blastocyst yield. Same concentrations of ammonia, urea, NEFA, and β-OHB were examined on growth parameters and hormone secretion activity of granulosa cells in vitro. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to evaluate the expression of steroidogenic genes (steroidogenic cytochrome P-450 (CYP11A1, CYP19A1)), cell proliferation-related genes (GDF9, FSHr), and apoptosis-related genes (BCL-2 and BAX). The maturation, cleavage, and blastocyst production rates were significantly lowered in media containing either 200μm ammonia or 5mM urea or high combo NEFA or 1μm β-OHB. Exposure of granulosa cell to 400μm ammonia or 1μm β-OHB or very high combo or 6mM urea significantly decreased all the parameters examined compared to lower levels of all nutritional and metabolic stressors. Elevated concentration of metabolic stressors induced GC apoptosis through the BAX/BCL-2 pathway and reduced the steroidogenic gene messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and cell proliferation gene mRNA expression. These results suggested that the decreased function of GCs may cause ovarian dysfunction and offered an improved understanding of the molecular mechanism responsible for the low fertility in metabolic stressed condition.

Abstract: Summary
Chemically induced pluripotent stem cells (CiPSCs) may provide an alternative and attractive source for stem cell-based therapy. Sufficient telomere lengths are critical for unlimited self-renewal and genomic stability of pluripotent stem cells. Dynamics and mechanisms of telomere reprogramming of CiPSCs remain elusive. We show that CiPSCs acquire telomere lengthening with increasing passages after clonal formation. Both telomerase activity and recombination-based mechanisms are involved in the telomere elongation. Telomere lengths strongly indicate the degree of reprogramming, pluripotency, and differentiation capacity of CiPSCs. Nevertheless, telomere damage and shortening occur at a late stage of lengthy induction, limiting CiPSC formation. We find that histone crotonylation induced by crotonic acid can activate two-cell genes, including Zscan4; maintain telomeres; and promote CiPSC generation. Crotonylation decreases the abundance of heterochromatic H3K9me3 and HP1α at subtelomeres and Zscan4 loci. Taken together, telomere rejuvenation links to reprogramming and pluripotency of CiPSCs. Crotonylation facilitates telomere maintenance and enhances chemically induced reprogramming to pluripotency.

Abstract: Summary
Histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation is unevenly distributed in mammalian chromosomes. However, the molecular mechanism controlling the uneven distribution and its biological significance remain to be elucidated. Here, we show that JMJD1A and JMJD1B preferentially target H3K9 demethylation of gene-dense regions of chromosomes, thereby establishing an H3K9 hypomethylation state in euchromatin. JMJD1A/JMJD1B-deficient embryos died soon after implantation accompanying epiblast cell death. Furthermore, combined loss of JMJD1A and JMJD1B caused perturbed expression of metabolic genes and rapid cell death in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). These results indicate that JMJD1A/JMJD1B-meditated H3K9 demethylation has critical roles for early embryogenesis and ESC maintenance. Finally, genetic rescue experiments clarified that H3K9 overmethylation by G9A was the cause of the cell death and perturbed gene expression of JMJD1A/JMJD1B-depleted ESCs. We summarized that JMJD1A and JMJD1B, in combination, ensure early embryogenesis and ESC viability by establishing the correct H3K9 methylated epigenome.

Abstract: Gastric cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies worldwide. Chronic Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection can induce an inflammatory response that promotes atrophic gastritis, a preceding event to cancer development. The type 1 regulatory T (Tr1) cells have recently emerged as a critical participant in maintaining self-tolerance. In this study, we examined Tr1 cells in H. pylori infection and gastric cancer development. While H. pylori-uninfected (uninfected) subjects presented low Tr1 frequency in the peripheral blood, H. pylori-infected asymptomatic (infected) individuals and H. pylori-infected gastric cancer (cancer) individuals both presented elevated Tr1 frequency. Although the Tr1 cells from infected asymptomatic subjects were functionally more potent than those from uninfected healthy subjects, the Tr1 cells in cancer individuals demonstrated several functional impairments, such as reduced interleukin 10 (IL-10) expression, lower secretion of cytolytic factors including granzyme B and perforin, and lower capacity to suppress CD4+CD25- T cell and CD8+ T cell proliferation. In addition, the frequency and function of Tr1 cells were positively correlated with the disease-free survival of the gastric cancer patients. These results suggest that Tr1 cells might be involved in the regulating immune responses in H. pylori infection and gastric cancer development. The fact that Tr1 cells could suppress inflammation and produce cytotoxic molecules at the same time has made them attractive potential candidates for future immunotherapies.

Abstract: Over-activation of beta-catenin/TCF signaling is very common in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The molecular mechanisms leading to the aberrant activation of beta-catenin/TCF signaling are not fully understood. In this study, it was found that CDK7 was up-regulated in HCC tissues and its expression inversely correlated with the survival of HCC patients. Functional study showed that CDK7 promoted the growth and migration of HCC cells, and knocking down the expression of CDK7 inhibited the growth of HCC cells in both liquid culture and soft agar. Mechanistically, CDK7 interacted with beta-catenin, enhanced the interaction between beta-catenin and TCF4, and activated beta-catenin/TCF signaling. Taken together, this study demonstrated the oncogenic roles of CDK7 in HCC and suggested that CDK7 might be a promising therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
Transition metals are essential, but deregulation of their metabolism causes toxicity. Here, we report that the compound NSC319726 binds copper to induce oxidative stress and arrest glioblastoma-patient-derived cells at picomolar concentrations. Pharmacogenomic analysis suggested that NSC319726 and 65 other structural analogs exhibit lethality through metal binding. Although NSC319726 has been reported to function as a zinc ionophore, we report here that this compound binds to copper to arrest cell growth. We generated and validated pharmacogenomic predictions: copper toxicity was substantially inhibited by hypoxia, through an hypoxia-inducible-factor-1α-dependent pathway; copper-bound NSC319726 induced the generation of reactive oxygen species and depletion of deoxyribosyl purines, resulting in cell-cycle arrest. These results suggest that metal-induced DNA damage may be a consequence of exposure to some xenobiotics, therapeutic agents, as well as other causes of copper dysregulation, and reveal a potent mechanism for targeting glioblastomas.

Abstract: A non-resolving inflammation of the endothelium is recognised to be an important process leading to atherosclerosis. In diabetes, this process is thought to account for a significant number of cardiovascular disease-associated death and disability. However, the molecular mechanisms by which diabetes contributes to endothelial inflammation remain to be established. Whilst there is some evidence linking hyperglycaemia-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation by the mitochondrial electron-transport chain to oxidative stress, cellular injury and apoptosis in the endothelium, a clear link to endothelium inflammation has not yet been established. The mitochondrial molecular stress protein Hsp60 is known to be secreted from mammalian cells and is capable of activating pro-inflammatory mediators on target cells expressing Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Hsp60 is also known to be elevated in serum of diabetes patients and has been shown to be upregulated by hyperglycaemic growth conditions in cultured human HeLa cells. This study shows that Hsp60 induced in human acute monocyte leukaemia cell line (THP-1) cells grown under hyperglycaemic conditions (25mM glucose) was able to be secreted into growth media. Furthermore, the secretion of Hsp60 from THP-1 cells was able to be inhibited by 5,5-(N-N-dimethyl)-amiloride hydrochloride (DMA), an exosomal inhibitor. Interestingly, the conditioned media obtained from THP-1 cells grown in the presence of 25mM glucose was able to induce the secretion of TNF-α in human vascular endothelium cell line (HUVEC). When conditioned media was immuno-depleted of Hsp60, there was a significant reduction in the release of TNF-α from the HUVEC cells. This suggests that a potential link may exist between hyperglycaemia-induced expression of Hsp60 in monocyte cells and vascular inflammation. Circulating levels of Hsp60 due to mitochondrial stress in diabetes patients could therefore be an important modulator of inflammation in endothelial cells and thus contribute to the increased incidences of atherosclerosis in diabetes mellitus.

Abstract: Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling controls skeletal muscle cell differentiation, growth, and metabolism by sensing the intracellular energy status and nutrients. Recently, leucyl-tRNA synthetase (Lars) was identified as an intracellular sensor of leucine involved in the activation of mTOR signaling. However, there is still no evidence for the activation of mTOR signaling by Lars and its physiological roles in skeletal muscle cells. In this study, we determined the potential roles of Lars for the activation of mTOR signaling, skeletal muscle cell differentiation, hypertrophy, and metabolism using small interfering (si)-RNA knockdown. siRNA-mediated knockdown of Lars decreased phosphorylated p70 S6 kinase and inhibited the differentiation of C2C12 mouse myoblasts into myotubes, as evidenced by a decreased fusion index and decreased mRNA and protein expression levels of myogenic markers. Importantly, si-Lars decreased the level of Insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2) mRNA expression from the early stages of differentiation, indicating the possibility of an association between the mTOR–IGF2 axis and Lars. However, Lars knockdown did not decrease phosphorylated mTOR in differentiated myotubes, nor did it affect the hypertrophy of myotubes as evidenced by measuring their diameters and detecting the mRNA and protein expression of hypertrophy markers. Similarly, an extracellular flux analyzer showed that Lars knockdown did not affect the metabolism (glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration) of myotubes. These results demonstrate that Lars is required for skeletal muscle differentiation through the activation of mTOR signaling, but not for hypertrophy or metabolic alteration of myotubes.

Abstract: The role of Hedgehog (HH)/ glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (GLI1) pathway has been implicated in a variety of cancer entities, and the targeted pathway inhibition mediated by GLI1 is of therapeutic relevance. However, its oncogenicity and cross-talks with other cancer pathways including PI3K/Akt/NFκB, which modulates the HH/GLI1 signal strength, have rarely been explored in colorectal adenocarcinoma. We assessed the expression of GLI1 and its relationship with other cancer stemness genes, cell cycle markers, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), PI3K/Akt/NFκB signaling pathway genes, and HIF1α in 100 paraffin-embedded colorectal adenocarcinoma tissue samples using immunohistochemistry. We further addressed the effect of GLI1 on EMT, cell cycle, and its putative interaction with the PI3K/Akt/NFκB cascade in colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines. The expression of GLI1 in colorectal adenocarcinoma tissues was found to correlate with the clinical stages, and distant metastasis. Moreover, GLI1 was found to be an independent predictor of poor overall survival and disease-free survival in colorectal adenocarcinoma. GLI1-expressing cancer cells also expressed their representative cancer stem-like cell (CSC) markers (SOX9 and CD133), as well as HIF1α. GLI1 expression was also strongly linked to EMT-related and PI3K/Akt/NFκB signaling genes. Downregulation of GLI1 by inhibitor treatment in colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines resulted in reduced expression of CSC markers, cell clonogenicity, S-phase subpopulations, as well as the migration and invasion ability. Importantly, Akt inhibitor Perifosine significantly inhibited the expression of pAkt and GLI1 in colorectal adenocarcinoma cells. Combination of GLI1 inhibitor GANT61 and NFκB p65 inhibitor QZN exhibited much higher inhibition compared to using any of them individually on colorectal adenocarcinoma cells. We suggested that GLI1 may be a novel stem cell marker, and cancer stemness was activated via PI3K/Akt/NFκB pathway. In addition, co-targeting GLI1 and PI3K/Akt/NFκB signaling simultaneously might provide an alternative therapeutic strategy for colorectal adenocarcinoma patients.

Abstract: Hyperglycemia induced oxidative stress inside the cells. Myricitrin, as an antioxidant plant-derived component, may be useful in hyperglycemia. Hence, the aim of this study was conducted to evaluate the antioxidant effects of myricitrin on hyperglycemia-induced oxidative damage in myotubes (C2C12 cells). In this experimental study, mouse myoblast cell line (C2C12) was obtained and divided into five groups: control, hyperglycemia, hyperglycemia + myricitrin 1, 3, and 10 μM. After treatment period for 48 h, cells were collected, homogenized, and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min. All samples were kept at − 80°C until experimental and real-time PCR assessments were performed. Hyperglycemia increased malondialdehyde (MDA) (p < 0.05), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) (p < 0.001), and cellular apoptosis, and decreased levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) (p < 0.01), myotube glycogen content (p < 0.05), glucose transporter type 4 (Glut-4), and cellular viability (p < 0.001). Myricitrin administration improved SOD (p < 0.05), CAT (p < 0.01), muscle cell’s glycogen content (p < 0.01), Glut-4 gene expression (p < 0.001), Thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) (p < 0.05), and Bax to Bcl-2 ratio (p < 0.001), and reduced MDA (p < 0.05) compared to hyperglycemia group. In conclusion, hyperglycemic condition induced oxidative stress along with cellular apoptosis, and myricitrin improved these disorders. Also, low and moderate doses of myricitrin are more efficient on skeletal muscle cells exposed to hyperglycemic statues than a high concentration of this antioxidant agent.

Abstract: The human rhomboid family-1 gene (RHBDF1) is an oncogene in breast and head and neck squamous cancers. Here, we show that RHBDF1 plays a significant role in colorectal cancer (CRC) formation and that the RHBDF1 expression level is higher in CRC than in corresponding normal tissues. Moreover, RHBDF1 promotes cell proliferation, invasion and migration in vitro. Furthermore, through overexpression and silencing of RHBDF1 and the mediator complex, our study demonstrates that RHBDF1 may positively regulate adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) in the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway to increase the expression levels of MMP-14 and Twist, which act as important epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) stimulating factors. Additionally, RHBDF1 may regulate c-myc and CyclinD1 expression to influence cell proliferation. Finally, RHBDF1 overexpression and silencing influence CRC growth in BALB/c nude mice. In summary, our findings demonstrate that the regulatory effects of RHBDF1 on EMT and on cell proliferation are partially attributable to the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway.

Abstract: Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is an evolutionarily well-conserved molecular chaperone involved in several cellular processes such as folding of proteins, modulating protein-protein interactions, and transport of proteins across the membrane. Binding partners of Hsp70 (known as “clients”) are identified on an individual basis as researchers discover their particular protein of interest binds to Hsp70. A full complement of Hsp70 interactors under multiple stress conditions remains to be determined. A promising approach to characterizing the Hsp70 “interactome” is the use of protein epitope tagging and then affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry (AP-MS/MS). AP-MS analysis is a widely used method to decipher protein-protein interaction networks and identifying protein functions. Conventionally, the proteins are overexpressed ectopically which interferes with protein complex stoichiometry, skewing AP-MS/MS data. In an attempt to solve this issue, we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing to integrate a tandem-affinity (TAP) epitope tag into the genomic locus of HSC70. This system offers several benefits over existing expression systems including native expression, no requirement for selection, and homogeneity between cells. This cell line, freely available to chaperone researchers, will aid in small and large-scale protein interaction studies as well as the study of biochemical activities and structure-function relationships of the Hsc70 protein.

Abstract: Summary
Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived atrial cardiomyocytes (CMs) hold great promise for elucidating underlying cellular mechanisms that cause atrial fibrillation (AF). In order to use atrial-like hiPSC-CMs for arrhythmia modeling, it is essential to better understand the molecular and electrophysiological phenotype of these cells. We performed comprehensive molecular, transcriptomic, and electrophysiologic analyses of retinoic acid (RA)-guided hiPSC atrial-like CMs and demonstrate that RA results in differential expression of genes involved in calcium ion homeostasis that directly interact with an RA receptor, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor 2 (COUP-TFII). We report a mechanism by which RA generates an atrial-like electrophysiologic signature through the downstream regulation of calcium channel gene expression by COUP-TFII and modulation of calcium handling. Collectively, our results provide important insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms that regulate atrial-like hiPSC-CM electrophysiology and support the use of atrial-like CMs derived from hiPSCs to model AF.

Abstract: Human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are widely used for in vitro disease modeling. One of the challenges in the field is represented by the ability of converting human PSCs into specific disease-relevant cell types. The nervous system is composed of a wide variety of neuronal types with selective vulnerability in neurodegenerative diseases. This is particularly relevant for motor neuron diseases, in which different motor neurons populations show a different susceptibility to degeneration. Here we developed a fast and efficient method to convert human induced Pluripotent Stem Cells into cranial motor neurons of the branchiomotor and visceral motor subtype. These populations represent the motor neuron subgroup that is primarily affected by a severe form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with bulbar onset and worst prognosis. This goal was achieved by stable integration of an inducible vector, based on the piggyBac transposon, allowing controlled activation of Ngn2, Isl1 and Phox2a (NIP). The NIP module effectively produced electrophysiologically active cranial motor neurons. Our method can be easily extended to PSCs carrying disease-associated mutations, thus providing a useful tool to shed light on the cellular and molecular bases of selective motor neuron vulnerability in pathological conditions.

Abstract: Autophagy is upregulated under stress conditions to degrade superfluous proteins and recycle damaged organelles including damaged mitochondria. However, the occurrence of mitochondrial autophagy and its contribution remain to be elucidated during renal ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI). In this study, mitophagosomes and engulfed mitochondria were frequently observed by electron microscopy after renal IRI vs. control. Meanwhile, the increase of lipidated microtubule associated protein light chain 3 (LC3-II) and decrease of mitochondrial proteins were detected by western blot, suggesting the presence of mitophagy. Drp1 translocated to mitochondria and was phosphorylated at S616 in response to IRI. Interestingly, we found that inhibiting drp1 phosphorylation with mdivi-1 significantly suppressed IRI-induced mitophagy without affecting general autophagy. Furthermore, our results showed that downregulation of mitophagy significantly exacerbated cell apoptosis and markedly aggravated kidney dysfunction induced by IRI. Taken together, these data indicate that mitophagy was activated via Drp1-dependent pathway and such mitophagic clearance of damaged mitochondria protects cells from IRI-induced apoptosis.

Abstract: Hemoglobins (Hbs) are evolutionarily conserved small globular proteins with characteristic 3-over-3 α-helical sandwich structure that is typically known as “globin fold”. Hbs have been found to be involved in diverse biological functions and the characteristic property of oxygen transportation is relatively a recent adaptation. Drosophila genome possesses three globin genes (glob1, glob2, and glob3) and it was previously reported that adequate expression of glob1 is required for various aspects of development, and also to regulate the cellular level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The present study illustrates the explicit role of glob1 gene in Drosophila development. We demonstrate a dynamic expression pattern of glob1 in larval tissues which largely concentrate around F-actin rich structures and also co-precipitate. Reduced expression of glob1 leads to developmental abnormalities which appeared to be largely mediated by inappropriately formed F-actin based cytoskeletal structures. Our subsequent analysis in FLP/FRT mediated somatic clones establishes specific role of Drosophila glob1 in maintenance of the integrity of F-actin based cytoskeleton during development. For the first time, we report interaction between Glob1 and actin, and propose a novel role of glob1 in maintenance of F-actin based cytoskeleton in Drosophila.

Abstract: Volumetric muscle defect, caused by trauma or combat injuries, is a major health concern leading to severe morbidity. It is characterized by partial or full thickness loss of muscle and its bio-scaffold, resulting in extensive fibrosis and scar formation. Therefore, the ideal therapeutic option is to use stem cells combined with bio-scaffolds to restore muscle. For this purpose, muscle-derived stem cells (MDSCs) are a great candidate due to their unique multi-lineage differentiation potential. In this study, we evaluated the regeneration potential of MDSCs for muscle loss repair using a novel in situ fibrin gel casting. Muscle defect was created by a partial thickness wedge resection in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of NSG mice which created an average of 25% mass loss. If untreated, this defect leads to severe muscle fibrosis. Next, MDSCs were delivered using a novel in situ fibrin gel casting method. Our results demonstrated MDSCs are able to engraft and form new myofibers in the defect when casted along with fibrin gel. LacZ labeled MDSCs were able to differentiate efficiently into new myofibers and significantly increase muscle mass. This was also accompanied by significant reduction of fibrotic tissue in the engrafted muscles. Furthermore, transplanted cells also contributed to new vessel formation and satellite cell seeding. These results confirmed the therapeutic potential of MDSCs and feasibility of direct in situ casting of fibrin/MDSC mixture to repair muscle mass defects.

Abstract: Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are heat shock proteins sized 12–43 kDa that can protect proteins from denaturation, particularly under high temperature; sHSPs thus increase the heat tolerance capability of an organisms enabling survival in adverse climates. sHSP20 is overexpressed in Oenococcus oeni in response to low temperatures. However, we found that overexpression of sHSP20 in Escherichia coli BL21 increased the microbial survival ratio at 50°C by almost 2 h. Adding sHSP20 to the glutamate dehydrogenase solution significantly increased the stability of the enzyme at high temperature (especially at 60–70 °C), low pH values (especially below 6.0), and high concentration of metal ions of Ga2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, and Fe3+. Notably, the coexpression of sHSP20 significantly enhanced soluble expression of laccase from Phomopsis sp. XP-8 (CCTCCM209291) in E. coli without codon optimization, as well as the activity and heat stability of the expressed enzyme. In addition to the chaperone activity of sHSP20 in the gene containing host in vivo and the enzyme heat stability in vitro, our study indicated the capability of coexpression of sHSP20 to increase the efficiency of prokaryotic expression of fungal genes and the activity of expressed enzymes.Graphical abstractᅟGraphical abstract

Abstract: Physalis alkekengi var. francheti is an indigenous herb well known for its anti-inflammatory, sedative, antipyretic, and expectorant properties. However, the information regarding the impacts of P. alkekengi fruits (PAF) in modulation of oxidative stress and learning memory are still unknown. This study therefore evaluated the antioxidant properties of ethyl acetate (EA) fraction of PAF and its impacts on learning and memory. The antioxidant activities of PAF were evaluated in LPS-induced BV2 microglial cells. The potent EA fraction then investigated and confirmed for its involvement of HO-1 pathway using hemin (HO-1 inducer) and ZnPP (HO-1 inhibitor) through Western blotting, DCFH-DA, and/or Griess assay. The involvements of PI3K/Akt, MEK, and p38 MAPK also investigated. Furthermore, we applied EA fraction to the animals at 100 and 200 mg/kg doses to check if the extract could improve scopolamine-induced memory deficits in passive avoidance and elevated plus maze tests. Our results demonstrated that the fractions from PAF significantly inhibited the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by LPS in concentration-dependent manners. In comparison to other fractions, the EA fraction exhibited potent effect in suppressing intracellular ROS generation. Besides, EA fraction also induced the expression of HO-1 in time- and concentration-dependent manners. ZnPP significantly reversed the suppressive effect of EA fraction on LPS-induced ROS generation and NO production, which confirm the involvement of HO-1 signaling in EA-fraction-mediated antioxidant activities. Consistently, blocking of PI3K/Akt, MEK, and p38 MAPK pathways by PAF-EA suppressed the production of intracellular ROS, indicating their potential participation. In addition, one of the major constituents of EA fraction, luteolin-7-O-β-D-glucoside, also demonstrated HO-1-dependent antioxidant effects in BV2 cells. Further, the EA fraction significantly (p < 0.05) improves scopolamine-induced memory deficits in mice. Taken together, our findings highlight the antioxidant effects of EA fraction of PAF which may be beneficial in treatment of different neurodegenerative diseases associated with free radicals.

Abstract: A variety of solid tumors are surrounded by a hypoxic microenvironment, which is known to be associated with high metastatic capability and resistance to various clinical therapies, contributing to a poor survival rate for cancer patients. Although the majority of previous studies on tumor-associated hypoxia have focused on acute hypoxia, chronic hypoxia more closely mimics the actual hypoxic microenvironment of a tumor. In this study, two novel hypoxia-resistant gastric cancer (HRGC) cell lines which could grow normally in 2% oxygen were established. The long non-coding RNA UCA1 was upregulated in HRGC cells, which promoted their migration. Bioinformatics analysis and a luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-7-5p could bind to specific sites of UCA1 to regulate the target EGFR through competitive endogenous RNA function. UCA1 directly interacted with miR-7-5p and decreased the binding of miR-7-5p to the EGFR 3′-untranslated region, which suppressed the degradation of EGFR mRNA by miR-7-5p. Therefore, long-term hypoxia induced UCA1 to promote cell migration by enhancing the expression of EGFR. This study thus reveals a new mechanism by which a hypoxic microenvironment promotes tumor metastasis, and highlights UCA1 as a potential biomarker for predicting the metastasis of gastric cancer to guide clinical treatment.

Abstract: The calcium binding protein S100B has been implicated in diabetic neuronal and vascular complications but has not been examined in the development of diabetes. S100B knock out (S100B KO) and wild-type (WT) mice were injected with 40 mg/kg body weight streptozotocin (STZ) for 5 days. Blood and pancreatic tissue samples were obtained to examine islet structure and function, the profile of glucose and insulin and expression of glucose transporter 2 (Glut2), S100B and its receptor, the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). Primary islet β-cells cultures from WT mice were used to test the apoptotic potential of S100B. S100B KO mice were resistant to STZ induced-diabetes with lower urine volume, food and water intake compared to WT mice. S100B increased in the WT islet following diabetes but did not co-localize with beta or peri-islet Schwann cells but with CD3 + T lymphocytes. S100B KO mice exhibited enhanced glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, prevented β-cell destruction and functional impairment in response to STZ treatment. S100B deficiency was associated with decreased Glut2 and RAGE. In primary β-cell cultures from WT mice, S100B induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and RAGE-dependent apoptosis. In the STZ diabetic animal model, abrogation of S100B enhances insulin sensitivity and reduces pancreatic islet, and β-cell destruction. S100B may be a promising target for pharmacological interventions aimed at repressing diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
Glycosylceramides that activate CD1d-restricted invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells have potential therapeutic applications for augmenting immune responses against cancer and infections. Previous studies using mouse models identified sphinganine variants of α-galactosylceramide as promising iNKT cell activators that stimulate cytokine responses with a strongly proinflammatory bias. However, the activities of sphinganine variants in mice have generally not translated well to studies of human iNKT cell responses. Here, we show that strongly proinflammatory and anti-tumor iNKT cell responses were achieved in mice by a variant of α-galactosylceramide that combines a sphinganine base with a hydrocinnamoyl ester on C6″ of the sugar. Importantly, the activities observed with this variant were largely preserved for human iNKT cell responses. Structural and in silico modeling studies provided a mechanistic basis for these findings and suggested basic principles for capturing useful properties of sphinganine analogs of synthetic iNKT cell activators in the design of immunotherapeutic agents.

Abstract: Liver fibrosis, an important health concern associated to chronic liver injury that provides a permissive environment for cancer development, is characterized by the persistent deposition of extracellular matrix components mainly derived from activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Brg1, the core subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, has been proved to associated with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis which may progress to cirrhosis. Herein, we determined whether Brg1 regulates liver fibrosis and examined its mechanism by focusing on HSCs activation. In this study, we demonstrate that Brg1 is elevated in human and mouse fibrotic liver tissues and Brg1 mediate the profibrotic response in activated HSCs. Our data indicate that Brg1 regulates the activation of HSCs through TGFβ/Smad signal pathway. Moreover, Brg1 deficiency mice displayed decreased HSCs activation in vitro and liver fibrogenesis after chronic damage by CCl4 administration. In addition, Brg1 expression is positively correlated with liver fibrosis in cirrhotic patients and may be a prognostic factor in HCC. Collectively, we demonstrate that Brg1 promotes liver fibrosis by activating HSCs and may represent a potential target for anti-fibrotic therapies.

Abstract: Increasing evidence suggests that mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I participates in carcinogenesis and cancer progression by providing energy and maintaining mitochondrial function. However, the role of complex I in ovarian cancer is largely unknown. In this study we showed that metformin, considered to be an inhibitor of complex I, simultaneously inhibited cell growth and induced mitochondrial-related apoptosis in human ovarian cancer cells. Metformin interrupted cellular energy metabolism mainly by causing damage to complex I that impacted mitochondrial function. Additionally, treatment with metformin increased the activation of sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), a mitochondrial deacetylase. We demonstrated that SIRT3 overexpression aggravated metformin-induced apoptosis, energy stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, treatment with metformin or SIRT3 overexpression increased activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a major sensor of cellular energy status. AMPK compensated for energy loss by increasing glycolysis. The impact of this was assessed by reducing glucose levels in the media or by using inhibitors (2-deoxyglucose, Compound C) of glycolysis and AMPK. The combination of these factors with metformin intensified cytotoxicity through further downregulation of ATP. Our study outlines an important role for SIRT3 in the antitumor effect of mitochondrial complex I inhibitors in human ovarian cancer cells. This effect appears to be mediated by induction of energy stress and apoptosis. Strategies that target the mitochondria could be enhanced by modulating glycolysis to further aggravate energy stress that may increase the antitumor effect.

Abstract: Summary
The gap in knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into the mesenchymal cell lineages hinders the application of hPSCs for cell-based therapy. In this study, we identified a critical role of muscle segment homeobox 2 (MSX2) in initiating and accelerating the molecular program that leads to mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (MSC) differentiation from hPSCs. Genetic deletion of MSX2 impairs hPSC differentiation into MSCs. When aided with a cocktail of soluble molecules, MSX2 ectopic expression induces hPSCs to form nearly homogeneous and fully functional MSCs. Mechanistically, MSX2 induces hPSCs to form neural crest cells, an intermediate cell stage preceding MSCs, and further differentiation by regulating TWIST1 and PRAME. Furthermore, we found that MSX2 is also required for hPSC differentiation into MSCs through mesendoderm and trophoblast. Our findings provide novel mechanistic insights into lineage specification of hPSCs to MSCs and effective strategies for applications of stem cells for regenerative medicine.

Abstract: Summary
Protein kinases are dynamic, adopting different conformational states that are critical for their catalytic activity. We assess a range of structural features derived from the conserved αC helix and DFG motif to define the conformational space of the catalytic domain of protein kinases. We then construct Kinformation, a random forest classifier, to annotate the conformation of 3,708 kinase structures in the PDB. Our classification scheme captures known active and inactive kinase conformations and defines an additional conformational state, thereby refining the current understanding of the kinase conformational space. Furthermore, network analysis of the small molecules recognized by each conformation captures chemical substructures that are associated with each conformation type. Our description of the kinase conformational space is expected to improve modeling of protein kinase structures, as well as guide the development of conformation-specific kinase inhibitors with optimal pharmacological profiles.

Abstract: To study delayed genetic and epigenetic radiation effects, which may trigger radiation-induced carcinogenesis, we have established single-cell clones from irradiated and non-irradiated primary human fibroblasts. Stable clones were endowed with the same karyotype in all analyzed metaphases after 20 population doublings (PDs), whereas unstable clones displayed mosaics of normal and abnormal karyotypes. To account for variation in radiation sensitivity, all experiments were performed with two different fibroblast strains. After a single X-ray dose of 2 Gy more than half of the irradiated clones exhibited radiation-induced genome instability (RIGI). Irradiated clones displayed an increased rate of loss of chromosome Y (LOY) and copy number variations (CNVs), compared to controls. CNV breakpoints clustered in specific chromosome regions, in particular 3p14.2 and 7q11.21, coinciding with common fragile sites. CNVs affecting the FHIT gene in FRA3B were observed in independent unstable clones and may drive RIGI. Bisulfite pyrosequencing of control clones and the respective primary culture revealed global hypomethylation of ALU, LINE-1, and alpha-satellite repeats as well as rDNA hypermethylation during in vitro ageing. Irradiated clones showed further reduced ALU and alpha-satellite methylation and increased rDNA methylation, compared to controls. Methylation arrays identified several hundred differentially methylated genes and several enriched pathways associated with in vitro ageing. Methylation changes in 259 genes and the MAP kinase signaling pathway were associated with delayed radiation effects (after 20 PDs). Collectively, our results suggest that both genetic (LOY and CNVs) and epigenetic changes occur in the progeny of exposed cells that were not damaged directly by irradiation, likely contributing to radiation-induced carcinogenesis. We did not observe epigenetic differences between stable and unstable irradiated clones. The fact that the DNA methylation (DNAm) age of clones derived from the same primary culture varied greatly suggests that DNAm age of a single cell (represented by a clone) can be quite different from the DNAm age of a tissue. We propose that DNAm age reflects the emergent property of a large number of individual cells whose respective DNAm ages can be highly variable.

Abstract: Summary
The production of germ cells in vitro would open important new avenues for stem biology and human medicine, but the mechanisms of germ cell differentiation are not well understood. The chicken, as a great model for embryology and development, was used in this study to help us explore its regulatory mechanisms. In this study, we reported a comprehensive genome-wide DNA methylation landscape in chicken germ cells, and transcriptomic dynamics was also presented. By uncovering DNA methylation patterns on individual genes, some genes accurately modulated by DNA methylation were found to be associated with cancers and virus infection, e.g., AKT1 and CTNNB1. Chicken-unique markers were also discovered for identifying male germ cells. Importantly, integrated epigenetic mechanisms were explored during male germ cell differentiation, which provides deep insight into the epigenetic processes associated with male germ cell differentiation and possibly improves treatment options to male infertility in animals and humans.

Abstract: Nod-like receptor pyrin domain-containing proteins (NLRPs) are known to take part in the pathogenesis of chronic liver diseases, including liver fibrosis. However, no known direct role of NLRP6, a member of NLRPs, has been reported in liver fibrosis. Here, we found that NLRP6 expression was decreased in fibrotic and cirrhotic livers. In a human hepatic stellate cell line, LX-2, overexpression of NLRP6 suppressed cell proliferation, hydroxyproline accumulation, as well as the expression of type I and type III collagens (Col-I and Col-III), α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP2 and MMP9), whereas NLRP6 knockdown displayed reverse effects. Furthermore, NLRP6 significantly suppressed the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 (p-Smad2/3) and enhanced the expression of protein phosphatase magnesium dependent 1 A (PPM1A), the only phosphatase for Smad2/3. NLRP6 overexpression abrogated TGF-β1-stimulated hydroxyproline accumulation and p-Smad2/3. Co-immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that NLRP6 was able to form a complex with PPM1A. NLRP6 overexpression did not change the level of p-Smad2/3 in LX-2 cells with PPM1A knockdown. These data indicated that PPM1A was required for the inhibitory effects of NLRP6 on TGF-β1/Smad2/3 signaling. In conclusion, our results suggest that NLRP6 exerts anti-fibrotic effects in LX-2 cells via regulating PPM1A/Smad2/3 and that NLRP6 may be an effective target in the treatment of liver fibrosis.

Abstract: Summary
We show that a human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) population cultured on a low-adhesion substrate developed two hPSC subtypes with different colony morphologies: flat and domed. Notably, the dome-like cells showed higher active proliferation capacity and increased several pluripotent genes’ expression compared with the flat monolayer cells. We further demonstrated that cell-matrix adhesion mediates the interaction between cell morphology and expression of KLF4 and KLF5 through a serum response factor (SRF)-based regulatory double loop. Our results provide a mechanistic view on the coupling among adhesion, stem cell morphology, and pluripotency, shedding light on the critical role of cell-matrix adhesion in the induction and maintenance of hPSC.

Abstract: Cell biology considers most animal tissues as assemblies of “individual” cells that rely on different contact-dependent communication mechanisms, including synapses, gap junctions or – a recent awareness - membrane nano- and microtubes. However, by protease-mediated singularization of dense 2D/ 3D cell cultures and tissue explants, we show here that cell collectives stay connected via a continuous meshwork of F-actin-based membrane tubes, resembling tunneling nanotube (TNT)-based networks observed between dispersed cell cultures. Fusion of respective tubes was accompanied by the ingrowth of microtubules and the invasion of mitochondria and lysosomes. Remarkably, in homology to the plasmodesmata-based plant symplast, we found evidence for expanded, membrane-based syncytia in animal tissues by observing dye transfer among the highly interlinked cells. This approach allows for the first time to visualize and quantify membrane continuity-based connections among densely packed cells and to assess their potential physiological and pathological impact closer to the in vivo situation.

Abstract: Summary
Underlying the development of malaria parasites within erythrocytes and the resulting pathogenicity is a hardwired program that secures proper timing of gene transcription and production of functionally relevant proteins. How stage-specific gene expression is orchestrated in vivo remains unclear. Here, using the assay for transposase accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq), we identified ∼4,000 regulatory regions in P. falciparum intraerythrocytic stages. The vast majority of these sites are located within 2 kb upstream of transcribed genes and their chromatin accessibility pattern correlates positively with abundance of the respective mRNA transcript. Importantly, these regions are sufficient to drive stage-specific reporter gene expression and DNA motifs enriched in stage-specific sets of regulatory regions interact with members of the P. falciparum AP2 transcription factor family. Collectively, this study provides initial insights into the in vivo gene regulatory network of P. falciparum intraerythrocytic stages and should serve as a valuable resource for future studies.

Abstract: Summary
Programmed cell death (PCD) plays critical roles in plant immunity but must be regulated to prevent excessive damage. The E3 ubiquitin ligase SPL11 negatively regulates PCD and immunity in plants. We show that SPL11 cell-death suppressor 2 (SDS2), an S-domain receptor-like kinase, positively regulates PCD and immunity in rice by engaging and regulating SPL11 and related kinases controlling defense responses. An sds2 mutant shows reduced immune responses and enhanced susceptibility to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Conversely, SDS2 over-expression induces constitutive PCD accompanied by elevated immune responses and enhanced resistance to M. oryzae. SDS2 interacts with and phosphorylates SPL11, which in turn ubiquitinates SDS2, leading to its degradation. In addition, SDS2 interacts with related receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases, OsRLCK118/176, that positively regulate immunity by phosphorylating the NADPH oxidase OsRbohB to stimulate ROS production. Thus, a plasma membrane-resident protein complex consisting of SDS2, SPL11, and OsRLCK118/176 controls PCD and immunity in rice.

Abstract: A dedicated UNC45, Cro1, She4 (UCS) domain-containing protein assists in the Hsp90-mediated folding of the myosin head. Only weak sequence conservation exists between the single UCS protein of simple eukaryotes (She4 in budding yeast) and the two UCS proteins of higher organisms (the general cell and striated muscle UNC45s; UNC45-GC and UNC45-SM, respectively). In vertebrates, UNC45-GC facilitates cytoskeletal functions, whereas the 55% identical UNC45-SM assists assembly of the contractile apparatus of cardiac and skeletal muscles. A Saccharomyces cerevisiae she4Δ mutant, totally lacking any UCS protein, was engineered to express as its sole Hsp90 either the Hsp90α or the Hsp90β isoforms of human cytosolic Hsp90. A transient induction of the human UNC45-GC, but not UNC45-SM, could rescue the defective endocytosis in these she4Δ cells at 39 °C, irrespective of whether they possessed Hsp90α or Hsp90β. UNC45-GC-mediated rescue of the localisation of a Myo5-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion to cortical patches at 39°C was more efficient in the yeast containing Hsp90α, though this may relate to more efficient functioning of Hsp90α as compared to Hsp90β in these strains. Furthermore, inducible expression of UNC45-GC, but not UNC45-SM, could partially rescue survival at a more extreme temperature (45 °C) that normally causes she4Δ mutant yeast cells to lyse. The results indicate that UCS protein function has been most conserved—yeast to man—in the UNC45-GC, not UNC45-SM. This may reflect UNC45-GC being the vertebrate UCS protein that assists formation of the actomyosin complexes needed for cytokinesis, cell morphological change, and organelle trafficking—events also facilitated by the myosins in yeast.

Abstract: Summary
Skin/soft tissue infections (SSTIs) caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) represent serious healthcare burdens worldwide. The host initially controls these infections with a pro-inflammatory infiltrate. However, once established, MRSA viability remains constant. To clear established MRSA SSTIs, the host must transition into the post-inflammatory resolution phase marked by infiltration of alternatively activated macrophages. Here we show that the host nuclear receptor, peroxisome proliferation activator receptor γ (PPARγ), is essential for this transition and MRSA clearance. Chemical PPARγ inhibition or genetic ablation of PPARγ in myeloid cells results in an extended inflammatory phase and exacerbated MRSA SSTIs. Conversely, treating mice with PPARγ agonists hastens the onset of the resolution phase and improves MRSA clearance in a myeloid-dependent fashion. The resolving fibrotic abscess lacks abundant glucose and oxygen but is replete with antimicrobial peptides, which together contribute to MRSA clearance. Thus, PPARγ agonists may serve as viable treatment options for complicated MRSA SSTIs.

Abstract: Summary
The gut microbiota play important roles in lipid metabolism and absorption. However, the contribution of the small bowel microbiota of mammals to these diet-microbe interactions remains unclear. We determine that germ-free (GF) mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity and malabsorb fat with specifically impaired lipid digestion and absorption within the small intestine. Small bowel microbes are essential for host adaptation to dietary lipid changes by regulating gut epithelial processes involved in their digestion and absorption. In addition, GF mice conventionalized with high-fat diet-induced jejunal microbiota exhibit increased lipid absorption even when fed a low-fat diet. Conditioned media from specific bacterial strains directly upregulate lipid absorption genes in murine proximal small intestinal epithelial organoids. These findings indicate that proximal gut microbiota play key roles in host adaptability to dietary lipid variations through mechanisms involving both the digestive and absorptive phases and that these functions may contribute to conditions of over- and undernutrition.
