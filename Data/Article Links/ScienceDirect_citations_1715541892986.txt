Abstract: Summary
The Piwi/Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway protects the germline from the activity of foreign sequences such as transposons. Remarkably, tens of thousands of piRNAs arise from a minimal number of discrete genomic regions. The extent to which clustering of these small RNA genes contributes to their coordinated expression remains unclear. We show that C. elegans SNPC-4, the Myb-like DNA-binding subunit of the small nuclear RNA activating protein complex, binds piRNA clusters in a germline-specific manner and is required for global piRNA expression. SNPC-4 localization is mutually dependent with localization of piRNA biogenesis factor PRDE-1. SNPC-4 exhibits an atypical widely distributed binding pattern that “coats” piRNA domains. Discrete peaks within the domains occur frequently at RNA-polymerase-III-occupied transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, which have been implicated in chromatin organization. We suggest that SNPC-4 binding establishes a positive expression environment across piRNA domains, providing an explanation for the conserved clustering of individually transcribed piRNA genes.

Abstract: Summary
How cancer cells shift metabolism to aerobic glycolysis is largely unknown. Here, we show that deficiency of α/β-hydrolase domain-containing 5 (Abhd5), an intracellular lipolytic activator that is also known as comparative gene identification 58 (CGI-58), promotes this metabolic shift and enhances malignancies of colorectal carcinomas (CRCs). Silencing of Abhd5 in normal fibroblasts induces malignant transformation. Intestine-specific knockout of Abhd5 in ApcMin/+ mice robustly increases tumorigenesis and malignant transformation of adenomatous polyps. In colon cancer cells, Abhd5 deficiency induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition by suppressing the AMPKα-p53 pathway, which is attributable to increased aerobic glycolysis. In human CRCs, Abhd5 expression falls substantially and correlates negatively with malignant features. Our findings link Abhd5 to CRC pathogenesis and suggest that cancer cells develop aerobic glycolysis by suppressing Abhd5-mediated intracellular lipolysis.

Abstract: Summary
ADF/cofilins drive cytoskeletal dynamics by promoting the disassembly of “aged” ADP-actin filaments. Mammals express several ADF/cofilin isoforms, but their specific biochemical activities and cellular functions have not been studied in detail. Here, we demonstrate that the muscle-specific isoform cofilin-2 promotes actin filament disassembly in sarcomeres to control the precise length of thin filaments in the contractile apparatus. In contrast to other isoforms, cofilin-2 efficiently binds and disassembles both ADP- and ATP/ADP-Pi-actin filaments. We mapped surface-exposed cofilin-2-specific residues required for ATP-actin binding and propose that these residues function as an “actin nucleotide-state sensor” among ADF/cofilins. The results suggest that cofilin-2 evolved specific biochemical and cellular properties that allow it to control actin dynamics in sarcomeres, where filament pointed ends may contain a mixture of ADP- and ATP/ADP-Pi-actin subunits. Our findings also offer a rationale for why cofilin-2 mutations in humans lead to myopathies.

Abstract: Summary
Phosphoinositides (PIPs) play key roles in signaling and disease. Using high-resolution quantitative mass spectrometry, we identified PIP-interacting proteins and profiled their binding specificities toward all seven PIP variants. This analysis revealed 405 PIP-binding proteins, which is greater than the total number of phospho- or ubiquitin-binding domains. Translocation and inhibitor assays of identified PIP-binding proteins confirmed that our methodology targets direct interactors. The PIP interactome encompasses proteins from diverse cellular compartments, prominently including the nucleus. Our data set revealed a consensus motif for PI(3,4,5)P3-interacting pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, which enabled in silico identification of phosphoinositide interactors. Members of the dedicator of cytokinesis family C exhibited specificity toward both PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(4,5)P2. Structurally, this dual specificity is explained by a decreased number of positively charged residues in the L1 subdomain compared with DOCK1. The presented PIP-binding proteome and its specificity toward individual PIPs should be a valuable resource for the community.

Abstract: Summary
Human resistin is a cytokine that induces low-grade inflammation by stimulating monocytes. Resistin-mediated chronic inflammation can lead to obesity, atherosclerosis, and other cardiometabolic diseases. Nevertheless, the receptor for human resistin has not been clarified. Here, we identified adenylyl cyclase-associated protein 1 (CAP1) as a functional receptor for human resistin and clarified its intracellular signaling pathway to modulate inflammatory action of monocytes. We found that human resistin directly binds to CAP1 in monocytes and upregulates cyclic AMP (cAMP) concentration, protein kinase A (PKA) activity, and NF-κB-related transcription of inflammatory cytokines. Overexpression of CAP1 in monocytes enhanced the resistin-induced increased activity of the cAMP-dependent signaling. Moreover, CAP1-overexpressed monocytes aggravated adipose tissue inflammation in transgenic mice that express human resistin from their monocytes. In contrast, suppression of CAP1 expression abrogated the resistin-mediated inflammatory activity both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, CAP1 is the bona fide receptor for resistin leading to inflammation in humans.

Abstract: Summary
Proteins and ribonucleoproteins containing a nuclear export signal (NES) assemble with the exportin Xpo1p (yeast CRM1) and Gsp1p-GTP (yeast Ran-GTP) in the nucleus and exit through the nuclear pore complex. In the cytoplasm, Yrb1p (yeast RanBP1) displaces NES from Xpo1p. Efficient export of NES-cargoes requires Yrb2p (yeast RanBP3), a primarily nuclear protein containing nucleoporin-like phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeats and a low-affinity Gsp1p-binding domain (RanBD). Here, we show that Yrb2p strikingly accelerates the association of Gsp1p-GTP and NES to Xpo1p. We have solved the crystal structure of the Xpo1p-Yrb2p-Gsp1p-GTP complex, a key assembly intermediate that can bind cargo rapidly. Although the NES-binding cleft of Xpo1p is closed in this intermediate, our data suggest that preloading of Gsp1p-GTP onto Xpo1p by Yrb2p, conformational flexibility of Xpo1p, and the low affinity of RanBD enable active displacement of Yrb2p RanBD by NES to occur effectively. The structure also reveals the major binding sites for FG repeats on Xpo1p.

Prostaglandin E2 Reverses Curcumin-Induced Inhibition of Survival Signal Pathways in Human Colorectal Carcinoma (HCT-15) Cell Lines,

Abstract: Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) promotes tumor-persistent inflammation, frequently resulting in cancer. Curcumin is a diphenolic turmeric that inhibits carcinogenesis and induces apoptosis. PGE2 inhibits curcumin-induced apoptosis; however, the underlying inhibitory mechanisms in colon cancer cells remain unknown. The aim of the present study is to investigate the survival role of PGE2 and whether addition of exogenous PGE2 affects curcumin-induced cell death. HCT-15 cells were treated with curcumin and PGE2, and protein expression levels were investigated via Western blot. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, lipid peroxidation, and intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels were confirmed using specific dyes. The nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) DNA-binding was measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). PGE2 inhibited curcumin-induced apoptosis by suppressing oxidative stress and degradation of PARP and lamin B. However, exposure of cells to the EP2 receptor antagonist, AH6809, and the PKA inhibitor, H89, before treatment with PGE2 or curcumin abolished the protective effect of PGE2 and enhanced curcumin-induced cell death. PGE2 activates PKA, which is required for cAMP-mediated transcriptional activation of CREB. PGE2 also activated the Ras/Raf/Erk pathway, and pretreatment with PD98059 abolished the protective effect of PGE2. Furthermore, curcumin treatment greatly reduced phosphorylation of CREB, followed by a concomitant reduction of NF-κB (p50 and p65) subunit activation. PGE2 markedly activated nuclear translocation of NF-κB. EMSA confirmed the DNA-binding activities of NF-κB subunits. These results suggest that inhibition of curcumin-induced apoptosis by PGE2 through activation of PKA, Ras, and NF-κB signaling pathways may provide a molecular basis for the reversal of curcumin-induced colon carcinoma cell death.

Abstract: Insect odorant receptors (ORs) are heteromeric complexes of an odor-specific receptor protein (OrX) and a ubiquitous co-receptor protein (Orco). The ORs operate as non-selective cation channels, also conducting Ca2+ ions. The Orco protein contains a conserved putative calmodulin (CaM)-binding motif indicating a role of CaM in its function. Using Ca2+ imaging to monitor OR activity we investigated the effect of CaM inhibition on the function of OR proteins. Ca2+ responses elicited in Drosophila olfactory sensory neurons by stimulation with the synthetic OR agonist VUAA1 were reduced and prolonged by CaM inhibition with the potent antagonist W7 but not with the weak antagonist W5. A similar effect was observed for Orco proteins heterologously expressed in CHO cells when CaM was inhibited with W7, trifluoperazine or chlorpromazine, or upon overexpression of CaM-EF-hand mutants. With the Orco CaM mutant bearing a point mutation in the putative CaM site (K339N) the Ca2+ responses were akin to those obtained for wild type Orco in the presence of W7. There was no uniform effect of W7 on Ca2+ responses in CHO cells expressing complete ORs (Or22a/Orco, Or47a/Orco, Or33a/Orco, Or56a/Orco). For Or33a and Or47a we observed no significant effect of W7, while it caused a reduced response in cells expressing Or22a and a shortened response for Or56a.

Potent functional uncoupling between STIM1 and Orai1 by dimeric 2-aminodiphenyl borinate analogs,

Abstract: The coupling of ER Ca2+-sensing STIM proteins and PM Orai Ca2+ entry channels generates “store-operated” Ca2+ signals crucial in controlling responses in many cell types. The dimeric derivative of 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borinate (2-APB), DPB162-AE, blocks functional coupling between STIM1 and Orai1 with an IC50 (200nM) 100-fold lower than 2-APB. Unlike 2-APB, DPB162-AE does not affect L-type or TRPC channels or Ca2+ pumps at maximal STIM1–Orai1 blocking levels. DPB162-AE blocks STIM1-induced Orai1 or Orai2, but does not block Orai3 or STIM2-mediated effects. We narrowed the DPB162-AE site of action to the STIM–Orai activating region (SOAR) of STIM1. DPB162-AE does not prevent the SOAR–Orai1 interaction but potently blocks SOAR-mediated Orai1 channel activation, yet its action is not as an Orai1 channel pore blocker. Using the SOAR-F394H mutant which prevents both physical and functional coupling to Orai1, we reveal DPB162-AE rapidly restores SOAR–Orai binding but only slowly restores Orai1 channel-mediated Ca2+ entry. With the same SOAR mutant, 2-APB induces rapid physical and functional coupling to Orai1, but channel activation is transient. We infer that the actions of both 2-APB and DPB162-AE are directed toward the STIM1–Orai1 coupling interface. Compared to 2-APB, DPB162-AE is a much more potent and specific STIM1/Orai1 functional uncoupler. DPB162-AE provides an important pharmacological tool and a useful mechanistic probe for the function and coupling between STIM1 and Orai1 channels.

Abstract: Summary
Tumors constitute highly suppressive microenvironments in which infiltrating T cells are “exhausted” by inhibitory receptors such as PD-1. Here we identify TIGIT as a coinhibitory receptor that critically limits antitumor and other CD8+ T cell-dependent chronic immune responses. TIGIT is highly expressed on human and murine tumor-infiltrating T cells, and, in models of both cancer and chronic viral infection, antibody coblockade of TIGIT and PD-L1 synergistically and specifically enhanced CD8+ T cell effector function, resulting in significant tumor and viral clearance, respectively. This effect was abrogated by blockade of TIGIT’s complementary costimulatory receptor, CD226, whose dimerization is disrupted upon direct interaction with TIGIT in cis. These results define a key role for TIGIT in inhibiting chronic CD8+ T cell-dependent responses.

Abstract: Summary
Similar to the mammalian intestine, the Drosophila adult midgut has resident stem cells that support growth and regeneration. How the niche regulates intestinal stem cell activity in both mammals and flies is not well understood. Here, we show that the conserved germinal center protein kinase Misshapen restricts intestinal stem cell division by repressing the expression of the JAK-STAT pathway ligand Upd3 in differentiating enteroblasts. Misshapen, a distant relative to the prototypic Warts activating kinase Hippo, interacts with and activates Warts to negatively regulate the activity of Yorkie and the expression of Upd3. The mammalian Misshapen homolog MAP4K4 similarly interacts with LATS (Warts homolog) and promotes inhibition of YAP (Yorkie homolog). Together, this work reveals that the Misshapen-Warts-Yorkie pathway acts in enteroblasts to control niche signaling to intestinal stem cells. These findings also provide a model in which to study requirements for MAP4K4-related kinases in MST1/2-independent regulation of LATS and YAP.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR-Cas is a prokaryotic adaptive immune system that provides sequence-specific defense against foreign nucleic acids. Here we report the structure and function of the effector complex of the Type III-A CRISPR-Cas system of Thermus thermophilus: the Csm complex (TtCsm). TtCsm is composed of five different protein subunits (Csm1–Csm5) with an uneven stoichiometry and a single crRNA of variable size (35–53 nt). The TtCsm crRNA content is similar to the Type III-B Cmr complex, indicating that crRNAs are shared among different subtypes. A negative stain EM structure of the TtCsm complex exhibits the characteristic architecture of Type I and Type III CRISPR-associated ribonucleoprotein complexes. crRNA-protein crosslinking studies show extensive contacts between the Csm3 backbone and the bound crRNA. We show that, like TtCmr, TtCsm cleaves complementary target RNAs at multiple sites. Unlike Type I complexes, interference by TtCsm does not proceed via initial base pairing by a seed sequence.

Abstract: Summary
Akt activation is a hallmark of human cancers. Here, we report a critical mechanism for regulation of Akt activity by the splicing kinase SRPK1, a downstream Akt target for transducing growth signals to regulate splicing. Surprisingly, we find that SRPK1 has a tumor suppressor function because ablation of SRPK1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts induces cell transformation. We link the phenotype to constitutive Akt activation from genome-wide phosphoproteomics analysis and discover that downregulated SRPK1 impairs the recruitment of the Akt phosphatase PHLPP1 (pleckstrin homology (PH) domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase) to Akt. Interestingly, SRPK1 overexpression is also tumorigenic because excess SRPK1 squelches PHLPP1. Thus, aberrant SRPK1 expression in either direction induces constitutive Akt activation, providing a mechanistic basis for previous observations that SRPK1 is downregulated in some cancer contexts and upregulated in others.

Abstract: Summary
Equal chromosome segregation requires proper assembly of many proteins, including Bub3, onto kinetochores to promote kinetochore-microtubule interactions. By screening for mitotic regulators in the spindle envelope and matrix (Spemix), we identify a conserved Bub3 interacting and GLE-2-binding sequence (GLEBS) containing ZNF207 (BuGZ) that associates with spindle microtubules and regulates chromosome alignment. Using its conserved GLEBS, BuGZ directly binds and stabilizes Bub3. BuGZ also uses its microtubule-binding domain to enhance the loading of Bub3 to kinetochores that have assumed initial interactions with microtubules in prometaphase. This enhanced Bub3 loading is required for proper chromosome alignment and metaphase to anaphase progression. Interestingly, we show that microtubules are required for the highest kinetochore loading of Bub3, BubR1, and CENP-E during prometaphase. These findings suggest that BuGZ not only serves as a molecular chaperone for Bub3 but also enhances its loading onto kinetochores during prometaphase in a microtubule-dependent manner to promote chromosome alignment.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian neocortex size primarily reflects the number and mode of divisions of neural stem and progenitor cells. Cortical stem cells (apical progenitors) switching from symmetric divisions, which expand their population, to asymmetric divisions, which generate downstream neuronal progenitors (basal progenitors), start expressing Tis21, a so-called antiproliferative/prodifferentiative gene. Tis21 encodes a small (17.5 kDa), functionally poorly characterized protein and a relatively large (2 kb), highly conserved 3′ UTR. Here, we show that mice lacking the Tis21 3′ UTR develop a microcephalic neocortex with fewer neurons, notably in the upper layers. This reflects a progressive decrease in basal progenitors, which in turn is due to a fraction of apical progenitors prematurely switching from asymmetric self-renewing to symmetric self-consuming divisions. This switch is caused by the markedly increased Tis21 protein level resulting from lack of microRNA-, notably miR-92-, dependent restriction of Tis21 expression. Our data show that a premature onset of consumptive neural stem cell divisions can lead to microcephaly.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria maintain cellular homeostasis by coordinating ATP synthesis with metabolic activity, redox signaling, and apoptosis. Excessive levels of mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) promote mitochondrial dysfunction, triggering numerous metabolic disorders. However, the molecular basis for the harmful effects of excessive ROS formation is largely unknown. Here, we identify a link between mitochondrial stress and ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, which supports cellular surveillance both in Caenorhabditis elegans and humans. Worms defective in respiration with elevated ROS levels are limited in turnover of a GFP-based substrate protein, demonstrating that mitochondrial stress affects the ubiquitin/proteasome system (UPS). Intriguingly, we observed similar proteolytic defects for disease-causing IVD and COX1 mutations associated with mitochondrial failure in humans. Together, these results identify a conserved link between mitochondrial metabolism and ubiquitin-dependent proteostasis. Reduced UPS activity during pathological conditions might potentiate disease progression and thus provides a valuable target for therapeutic intervention.

Specificity Protein 1 Expression Contributes to Bcl-w-Induced Aggressiveness in Glioblastoma Multiforme,

Abstract: We already had reported that Bcl-w promotes invasion or migration in gastric cancer cells and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) by activating matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) via specificity protein 1 (Sp1) or β-cateinin, respectively. High expression of Bcl-w also has been reported in GBM which is the most common malignant brain tumor and exhibits aggressive and invasive behavior. These reports propose that Bcl-w-induced signaling is strongly associated with aggressive characteristic of GBM. We demonstrated that Sp1 protein or mRNA expression is induced by Bcl-w using Western blotting or RT-PCR, respectively, and markedly elevated in high-grade glioma specimens compared with low-grade glioma tissues using tissue array. However, relationship between Bcl-w-related signaling and aggressive characteristic of GBM is poorly characterized. This study suggested that Bcl-w-induced Sp1 activation promoted expression of glioma stem-like cell markers, such as Musashi, Nanog, Oct4 and sox-2, as well as neurosphere formation and invasiveness, using western blotting, neurosphere formation assay, or invasion assay, culminating in their aggressive behavior. Therefore, Bcl-w-induced Sp1 activation is proposed as a putative marker for aggressiveness of GBM.

Abstract: Summary
Composed of up to 1,000 phospho-anhydride bond-linked phosphate monomers, inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) is one of the most ancient, conserved, and enigmatic molecules in biology. Here we demonstrate that polyP functions as a hitherto unrecognized chaperone. We show that polyP stabilizes proteins in vivo, diminishes the need for other chaperone systems to survive proteotoxic stress conditions, and protects a wide variety of proteins against stress-induced unfolding and aggregation. In vitro studies reveal that polyP has protein-like chaperone qualities, binds to unfolding proteins with high affinity in an ATP-independent manner, and supports their productive refolding once nonstress conditions are restored. Our results uncover a universally important function for polyP and suggest that these long chains of inorganic phosphate may have served as one of nature’s first chaperones, a role that continues to the present day.

Abstract: Summary
Genome control is operated by transcription factors (TFs) controlling their target genes by binding to promoters and enhancers. Conceptually, the interactions between TFs, their binding sites, and their functional targets are represented by gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Deciphering in vivo GRNs underlying organ development in an unbiased genome-wide setting involves identifying both functional TF-gene interactions and physical TF-DNA interactions. To reverse engineer the GRNs of eye development in Drosophila, we performed RNA-seq across 72 genetic perturbations and sorted cell types and inferred a coexpression network. Next, we derived direct TF-DNA interactions using computational motif inference, ultimately connecting 241 TFs to 5,632 direct target genes through 24,926 enhancers. Using this network, we found network motifs, cis-regulatory codes, and regulators of eye development. We validate the predicted target regions of Grainyhead by ChIP-seq and identify this factor as a general cofactor in the eye network, being bound to thousands of nucleosome-free regions.

Abstract: Turnover of the cartilage extracellular matrix depends exclusively on chondrocytes and varies in response to load and osmolarity fluctuations. Obesity can affect chondrocyte physiology; adipokines, insulin and proinflammatory cytokines levels are all altered in the obese and are related to matrix turnover impairments and thus to osteoarthritis. TRPV4, a mechanosensitive cation channel, is responsible for reacting to hypotonic variations. In this study, the presence and activity of TRPV4 channels in bovine chondrocytes were evaluated using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique and fluorescence measurements to perform characterisations of these channels and to determine intracellular calcium responses. The expression of TRPV4 was determined by RT-PCR. The TRPV4 regulation by hypotonic shock, insulin and adipokines were analysed. Hypoosmolarity induced a Gd3+-, ruthenium red-, and HC-067047-sensitive current, predominantly inward, an intracellular Ca2+ concentration increase and a membrane depolarisation. The current had a reversal potential of +28±4mV and exhibited preferential permeability to Ca2+; 4αPDD, a specific TRPV4 agonist, evoked the same response. TNFα, IL-1β, insulin, and, to a lesser degree, leptin and resistin attenuated the TRPV4-mediated effects; in contrast, adiponectin did not affect them. These results confirm the function of TRPV4 in bovine articular chondrocytes and its regulation by obesity-associated mediators.

Abstract: Summary
SLX4 binds to three nucleases (XPF-ERCC1, MUS81-EME1, and SLX1), and its deficiency leads to genomic instability, sensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, and Fanconi anemia. However, it is not understood how SLX4 and its associated nucleases act in DNA crosslink repair. Here, we uncover consequences of mouse Slx4 deficiency and reveal its function in DNA crosslink repair. Slx4-deficient mice develop epithelial cancers and have a contracted hematopoietic stem cell pool. The N-terminal domain of SLX4 (mini-SLX4) that only binds to XPF-ERCC1 is sufficient to confer resistance to DNA crosslinking agents. Recombinant mini-SLX4 enhances XPF-ERCC1 nuclease activity up to 100-fold, directing specificity toward DNA forks. Mini-SLX4-XPF-ERCC1 also vigorously stimulates dual incisions around a DNA crosslink embedded in a synthetic replication fork, an essential step in the repair of this lesion. These observations define vertebrate SLX4 as a tumor suppressor, which activates XPF-ERCC1 nuclease specificity in DNA crosslink repair.

Abstract: Thymosin beta4 (TB4) has multiple functions in cellular response in processes as diverse as embryonic organ development and the pathogeneses of disease, especially those associated with cardiac coronary vessels. However, the specific roles played by TB4 during heart valve development in vertebrates are largely unknown. Here, we identified a novel function of TB4 in endothelialmesenchymal transformation (EMT) in cardiac valve endocardial cushions in zebrafish. The expressions of thymosin family members in developing zebrafish embryos were determined by whole mount in situ hybridization. Of the thymosin family members only zTB4 was expressed in the developing heart region. Cardiac valve development at 48 h post fertilization was defected in zebrafish TB4 (zTB4) morpholino-injected embryos (morphants). In zTB4 morphants, abnormal linear heart tube development was observed. The expressions of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 4, notch1b, and hyaluronic acid synthase (HAS) 2 genes were also markedly reduced in atrio-ventricular canal (AVC). Endocardial cells in the AVC region were stained with anti-Zn5 antibody reactive against Dm-grasp (an EMT marker) to observe EMT in developing cardiac valves in zTB4 morphants. EMT marker expression in valve endothelial cells was confirmed after transfection with TB4 siRNA in the presence of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) by RT-PCR and immunofluorescent assay. Zn5-positive endocardial AVC cells were not observed in zTB4 morphants, and knockdown of TB4 suppressed TGF-β-induced EMT in ovine valve endothelial cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate that TB4 plays a pivotal role in cardiac valve formation by increasing EMT.

Abstract: Summary
Given the intimate link between inflammation and dysregulated cell proliferation in cancer, we investigated cytokine-triggered gene expression in different cell cycle stages. Transcriptome analysis revealed that G1 release through cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) and CDK4 primes and cooperates with the cytokine-driven gene response. CDK6 physically and functionally interacts with the NF-κB subunit p65 in the nucleus and is found at promoters of many transcriptionally active NF-κB target genes. CDK6 recruitment to distinct chromatin regions of inflammatory genes was essential for proper loading of p65 to its cognate binding sites and for the function of p65 coactivators, such as TRIP6. Furthermore, cytokine-inducible nuclear translocation and chromatin association of CDK6 depends on the kinase activity of TAK1 and p38. These results have widespread biological implications, as aberrant CDK6 expression or activation that is frequently observed in human tumors modulates NF-κB to shape the cytokine and chemokine repertoires in chronic inflammation and cancer.

IMP3 RNP Safe Houses Prevent miRNA-Directed HMGA2 mRNA Decay in Cancer and Development,

Abstract: Summary
The IMP3 RNA-binding protein is associated with metastasis and poor outcome in human cancer. Using solid cancer transcriptome data, we found that IMP3 correlates with HMGA2 mRNA expression. Cytoplasmic IMP3 granules contain HMGA2, and IMP3 dose-dependently increases HMGA2 mRNA. HMGA2 is regulated by let-7, and let-7 antagomiRs make HMGA2 refractory to IMP3. Removal of let-7 target sites eliminates IMP3-dependent stabilization, and IMP3-containing bodies are depleted of Ago1-4 and miRNAs. The relationship between Hmga2 mRNA and IMPs also exists in the developing limb bud, where IMP1-deficient embryos show dose-dependent Hmga2 mRNA downregulation. Finally, IMP3 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) contain other let-7 target mRNAs, including LIN28B, and a global gene set enrichment analysis demonstrates that miRNA-regulated transcripts in general are upregulated following IMP3 induction. We conclude that IMP3 RNPs may function as cytoplasmic safe houses and prevent miRNA-directed mRNA decay of oncogenes during tumor progression.

Abstract: Summary
Somatic mutations in DNMT3A, which encodes a de novo DNA methyltransferase, are found in ∼30% of normal karyotype acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases. Most mutations are heterozygous and alter R882 within the catalytic domain (most commonly R882H), suggesting the possibility of dominant-negative consequences. The methyltransferase activity of R882H DNMT3A is reduced by ∼80% compared with the WT enzyme. In vitro mixing of WT and R882H DNMT3A does not affect the WT activity, but coexpression of the two proteins in cells profoundly inhibits the WT enzyme by disrupting its ability to homotetramerize. AML cells with the R882H mutation have severely reduced de novo methyltransferase activity and focal hypomethylation at specific CpGs throughout AML cell genomes.

Abstract: Summary
Synchrony of the mammalian circadian clock is achieved by complex transcriptional and translational feedback loops centered on the BMAL1:CLOCK heterodimer. Modulation of circadian feedback loops is essential for maintaining rhythmicity, yet the role of transcriptional coactivators in driving BMAL1:CLOCK transcriptional networks is largely unexplored. Here, we show diurnal hepatic steroid receptor coactivator 2 (SRC-2) recruitment to the genome that extensively overlaps with the BMAL1 cistrome during the light phase, targeting genes that enrich for circadian and metabolic processes. Notably, SRC-2 ablation impairs wheel-running behavior, alters circadian gene expression in several peripheral tissues, alters the rhythmicity of the hepatic metabolome, and deregulates the synchronization of cell-autonomous metabolites. We identify SRC-2 as a potent coregulator of BMAL1:CLOCK and find that SRC-2 targets itself with BMAL1:CLOCK in a feedforward loop. Collectively, our data suggest that SRC-2 is a transcriptional coactivator of the BMAL1:CLOCK oscillators and establish SRC-2 as a critical positive regulator of the mammalian circadian clock.

Dual Regulation of Fbw7 Function and Oncogenic Transformation by Usp28,

Abstract: Summary
Fbw7, the substrate recognition subunit of SCF(Fbw7) ubiquitin ligase, mediates the turnover of multiple proto-oncoproteins and promotes its own degradation. Fbw7-dependent substrate ubiquitination is antagonized by the Usp28 deubiquitinase. Here, we show that Usp28 preferentially antagonizes autocatalytic ubiquitination and stabilizes Fbw7, resulting in dose-dependent effects in Usp28 knockout mice. Monoallelic deletion of Usp28 maintains stable Fbw7 but drives Fbw7 substrate degradation. In contrast, complete knockout triggers Fbw7 degradation and leads to the accumulation of Fbw7 substrates in several tissues and embryonic fibroblasts. On the other hand, overexpression of Usp28 stabilizes both Fbw7 and its substrates. Consequently, both complete loss and ectopic expression of Usp28 promote Ras-driven oncogenic transformation. We propose that dual regulation of Fbw7 activity by Usp28 is a safeguard mechanism for maintaining physiological levels of proto-oncogenic Fbw7 substrates, which is equivalently disrupted by loss or overexpression of Usp28.

Abstract: Summary
Listeria monocytogenes (LM), a facultative intracellular Gram-positive pathogen, can cause life-threatening infections in humans. In mice, the signaling cascade downstream of the myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) is essential for proper innate immune activation against LM, as MyD88-deficient mice succumb early to infection. Here, we show that MyD88 signaling in dendritic cells (DCs) is sufficient to mediate the protective innate response, including the production of proinflammatory cytokines, neutrophil infiltration, bacterial clearance, and full protection from lethal infection. We also demonstrate that MyD88 signaling by DCs controls the infection rates of CD8α+ cDCs and thus limits the spread of LM to the T cell areas. Furthermore, in mice expressing MyD88 in DCs, inflammatory monocytes, which are required for bacterial clearance, are activated independently of intrinsic MyD88 signaling. In conclusion, CD11c+ conventional DCs critically integrate pathogen-derived signals via MyD88 signaling during early infection with LM in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1)- and inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase 2 (IKK2)-dependent signaling plays a crucial role in the development of obesity-associated insulin and leptin resistance not only in peripheral tissues but also in the CNS. Here, we demonstrate that constitutive JNK activation in agouti-related peptide (AgRP)-expressing neurons of the hypothalamus is sufficient to induce weight gain and adiposity in mice as a consequence of hyperphagia. JNK activation increases spontaneous action potential firing of AgRP cells and causes both neuronal and systemic leptin resistance. Similarly, activation of IKK2 signaling in AgRP neurons also increases firing of these cells but fails to cause obesity and leptin resistance. In contrast to JNK activation, IKK2 activation blunts insulin signaling in AgRP neurons and impairs systemic glucose homeostasis. Collectively, these experiments reveal both overlapping and nonredundant effects of JNK- and IKK-dependent signaling in AgRP neurons, which cooperate in the manifestation of the metabolic syndrome.

Abstract: Plant breeders have focused on improving plant architecture as an effective means to increase crop yield. Here, we identify the main-effect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for plant shape-related traits in rice (Oryza sativa) and find candidate genes by applying whole genome re-sequencing of two parental cultivars using next-generation sequencing. To identify QTLs influencing plant shape, we analyzed six traits: plant height, tiller number, panicle diameter, panicle length, flag leaf length, and flag leaf width. We performed QTL analysis with 178 F7 recombinant in-bred lines (RILs) from a cross of japonica rice line ‘SNUSG1’ and indica rice line ‘Milyang23’. Using 131 molecular markers, including 28 insertion/deletion markers, we identified 11 main- and 16 minor-effect QTLs for the six traits with a threshold LOD value > 2.8. Our sequence analysis identified fifty-four candidate genes for the main-effect QTLs. By further comparison of coding sequences and meta-expression profiles between japonica and indica rice varieties, we finally chose 15 strong candidate genes for the 11 main-effect QTLs. Our study shows that the whole-genome sequence data substantially enhanced the efficiency of polymorphic marker development for QTL fine-mapping and the identification of possible candidate genes. This yields useful genetic resources for breeding high-yielding rice cultivars with improved plant architecture.

Abstract: Ca2+ is an essential inorganic macronutrient, involved in regulating major physiological processes in plants. It has been well established as a second messenger and is predominantly stored in the cell wall, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria and vacuoles. In the cytosol, the concentration of this ion is maintained at nano-molar range. Upon requirement, Ca2+ is released from intra-cellular as well as extracellular compartments such as organelles and cell wall. In this study, we report for the first time, a whole genome transcriptome response to short (5 D) and long (14 D) term Ca2+ starvation and restoration in rice. Our results manifest that short and long term Ca2+ starvation involves a very different response in gene expression with respect to both the number and function of genes involved. A larger number of genes were up- or down-regulated after 14 D (5588 genes) than after 5 D (798 genes) of Ca2+ starvation. The functional classification of these genes indicated their connection with various metabolic pathways, ion transport, signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, and other processes related to growth and development. The results obtained here will enable to understand how changes in Ca2+ concentration or availability are interpreted into adaptive responses in plants.

Abstract: Summary
Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a tumor-predisposing genetic disorder. Plexiform neurofibromas are common NF1 tumors carrying a risk of malignant transformation, which is typically fatal. Little is known about mechanisms mediating initiation and identity of specific cell type that gives rise to neurofibromas. Using cell-lineage tracing, we identify a population of GAP43+ PLP+ precursors in embryonic nerve roots as the cells of origin for these tumors and report a non-germline neurofibroma model for preclinical drug screening to identify effective therapies. The identity of the tumor cell of origin and facility for isolation and expansion provides fertile ground for continued analysis to define factors critical for neurofibromagenesis. It also provides unique approaches to develop therapies to prevent neurofibroma formation in NF1 patients.

Abstract: Summary
The response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress relies on activation of unfolded protein response (UPR) sensors, and the outcome of the UPR depends on the duration and strength of signal. Here, we demonstrate a mechanism that attenuates the activity of the UPR sensor inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α). A resident ER protein disulfide isomerase, PDIA6, limits the duration of IRE1α activity by direct binding to cysteine 148 in the lumenal domain of the sensor, which is oxidized when IRE1 is activated. PDIA6-deficient cells hyperrespond to ER stress with sustained autophosphorylation of IRE1α and splicing of XBP1 mRNA, resulting in exaggerated upregulation of UPR target genes and increased apoptosis. In vivo, PDIA6-deficient C. elegans exhibits constitutive UPR and fails to complete larval development, a program that normally requires the UPR. Thus, PDIA6 activity provides a mechanism that limits UPR signaling and maintains it within a physiologically appropriate range.

Abstract: Summary
Chemotaxis, migration toward soluble chemical cues, is critical for processes such as wound healing and immune surveillance and is exhibited by various cell types, from rapidly migrating leukocytes to slow-moving mesenchymal cells. To study mesenchymal chemotaxis, we observed cell migration in microfluidic chambers that generate stable gradients of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Surprisingly, we found that pathways implicated in amoeboid chemotaxis, such as PI3K and mammalian target of rapamycin signaling, are dispensable for PDGF chemotaxis. Instead, we find that local inactivation of Myosin IIA, through a noncanonical Ser1/2 phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain, is essential. This site is phosphorylated by PKCα, which is activated by an intracellular gradient of diacylglycerol generated by PLCγ. Using a combination of live imaging and gradients of activators/inhibitors in the microfluidic chambers, we demonstrate that this signaling pathway and subsequent inhibition of Myosin II activity at the leading edge are required for mesenchymal chemotaxis.

Abstract: Summary
Accurate cell division depends on tightly regulated ubiquitylation events catalyzed by the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C). Among its many substrates, the APC/C triggers the degradation of proteins that stabilize the mitotic spindle, and loss or accumulation of such spindle assembly factors can result in aneuploidy and cancer. Although critical for cell division, it has remained poorly understood how the timing of spindle assembly factor degradation is established during mitosis. Here, we report that active spindle assembly factors are protected from APC/C-dependent degradation by microtubules. In contrast, those molecules that are not bound to microtubules are highly susceptible to proteolysis and turned over immediately after APC/C activation. The correct timing of spindle assembly factor degradation, as achieved by this regulatory circuit, is required for accurate spindle structure and function. We propose that the localized stabilization of APC/C substrates provides a mechanism for the selective disposal of cell-cycle regulators that have fulfilled their mitotic roles.

Abstract: Summary
Telomeric repeat binding factor 2 (TRF2), which plays a central role in telomere capping, is frequently increased in human tumors. We reveal here that TRF2 is expressed in the vasculature of most human cancer types, where it colocalizes with the Wilms’ tumor suppressor WT1. We further show that TRF2 is a transcriptional target of WT1 and is required for proliferation, migration, and tube formation of endothelial cells. These angiogenic effects of TRF2 are uncoupled from its function in telomere capping. Instead, TRF2 binds and transactivates the promoter of the angiogenic tyrosine kinase platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ). These findings reveal an unexpected role of TRF2 in neoangiogenesis and delineate a distinct function of TRF2 as a transcriptional regulator.

Abstract: Summary
In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling (IIS) reduction hyperactivates the transcription factors DAF-16 and heat shock factor 1 (HSF-1), creating long-lived, stress-resistant worms that are protected from proteotoxicity. How DAF-16 executes its distinct functions in response to IIS reduction is largely obscure. Here, we report that NHL-1, a member of the TRIM-NHL protein family, acts in chemosensory neurons to promote stress resistance in distal tissues by DAF-16 activation but is dispensable for the activation of HSF-1. The expression of nhl-1 is regulated by the IIS, defining a neuronal regulatory circuit that controls the organismal stress response. The knockdown of nhl-1 protects nematodes that express the Alzheimer-disease-associated Aβ peptide from proteotoxicity but has no effect on lifespan. Our findings indicate that DAF-16- and HSF-1-regulated heat-responsive mechanisms are differentially controlled by neurons and show that one neuronal protein can be involved in the activation of different stress responses in remote tissues.

Abstract: Summary
Smad4 is a major tumor suppressor currently thought to function constitutively in the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)-signaling pathway. Here, we report that Smad4 activity is directly regulated by the Wnt and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) pathways through GSK3 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation sites. FGF activates MAPK, which primes three sequential GSK3 phosphorylations that generate a Wnt-regulated phosphodegron bound by the ubiquitin E3 ligase β-TrCP. In the presence of FGF, Wnt potentiates TGF-β signaling by preventing Smad4 GSK3 phosphorylations that inhibit a transcriptional activation domain located in the linker region. When MAPK is not activated, the Wnt and TGF-β signaling pathways remain insulated from each other. In Xenopus embryos, these Smad4 phosphorylations regulate germ-layer specification and Spemann organizer formation. The results show that three major signaling pathways critical in development and cancer are integrated at the level of Smad4.

Abstract: Summary
In Drosophila embryos, a nuclear gradient of the Dorsal (Dl) transcription factor directs differential gene expression along the dorsoventral (DV) axis, translating it into distinct domains that specify future mesodermal, neural, and ectodermal territories. However, the mechanisms used to differentially position gene expression boundaries along this axis are not fully understood. Here, using a combination of approaches, including mutant phenotype analyses and chromatin immunoprecipitation, we show that the transcription factor Suppressor of Hairless, Su(H), helps define dorsal boundaries for many genes expressed along the DV axis. Synthetic reporter constructs also provide molecular evidence that Su(H) binding sites support repression and act to counterbalance activation through Dl and the ubiquitous activator Zelda. Our study highlights a role for broadly expressed repressors, like Su(H), and organization of transcription factor binding sites within cis-regulatory modules as important elements controlling spatial domains of gene expression to facilitate flexible positioning of boundaries across the entire DV axis.

Crosstalk between the Rb Pathway and AKT Signaling Forms a Quiescence-Senescence Switch,

Abstract: Summary
Cell-cycle arrest in quiescence and senescence is largely orchestrated by the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor-suppressor pathway, but the mechanisms underlying the quiescence-senescence switch remain unclear. Here, we show that the crosstalk between the Rb-AKT-signaling pathways forms this switch by controlling the overlapping functions of FoxO3a and FoxM1 transcription factors in cultured fibroblasts. In the absence of mitogenic signals, although FoxM1 expression is repressed by the Rb pathway, FoxO3a prevents reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by maintaining SOD2 expression, leading to quiescence. However, if the Rb pathway is activated in the presence of mitogenic signals, FoxO3a is also inactivated by AKT, thus reducing SOD2 expression and consequently allowing ROS production. This situation elicits senescence through irreparable DNA damage. We demonstrate that this pathway operates in mouse liver, indicating that this machinery may contribute more broadly to tissue homeostasis in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Patients with germline fumarate hydratase (FH) mutation are predisposed to develop aggressive kidney cancer with few treatment options and poor therapeutic outcomes. Activity of the proto-oncogene ABL1 is upregulated in FH-deficient kidney tumors and drives a metabolic and survival signaling network necessary to cope with impaired mitochondrial function and abnormal accumulation of intracellular fumarate. Excess fumarate indirectly stimulates ABL1 activity, while restoration of wild-type FH abrogates both ABL1 activation and the cytotoxicity caused by ABL1 inhibition or knockdown. ABL1 upregulates aerobic glycolysis via the mTOR/HIF1α pathway and neutralizes fumarate-induced proteotoxic stress by promoting nuclear localization of the antioxidant response transcription factor NRF2. Our findings identify ABL1 as a pharmacologically tractable therapeutic target in glycolytically dependent, oxidatively stressed tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Signaling pathways and small RNAs direct diverse cellular events, but few examples are known of defined signaling pathways directly regulating small RNA biogenesis. We show that ERK phosphorylates Dicer on two conserved residues in its RNase IIIb and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding domains and that phosphorylation of these residues is necessary and sufficient to trigger Dicer’s nuclear translocation in worms, mice, and human cells. Phosphorylation of Dicer on either site inhibits Dicer function in the female germline and dampens small RNA repertoire. Our data demonstrate that ERK phosphorylates and inhibits Dicer during meiosis I for oogenesis to proceed normally in Caenorhabditis elegans and that this inhibition is released before fertilization for embryogenesis to proceed normally. The conserved Dicer residues, their phosphorylation by ERK, and the consequences of the resulting modifications implicate an ERK-Dicer nexus as a fundamental component of the oocyte-to-embryo transition and an underlying mechanism coupling extracellular cues to small RNA production.

Abstract: Summary
Maf1 is a conserved repressor of RNA polymerase (Pol) III transcription; however, its physiological role in the context of a multicellular organism is not well understood. Here, we show that C. elegans MAFR-1 is functionally orthologous to human Maf1, represses the expression of both RNA Pol III and Pol II transcripts, and mediates organismal fecundity and lipid homeostasis. MAFR-1 impacts lipid transport by modulating intestinal expression of the vitellogenin family of proteins, resulting in cell-nonautonomous defects in the developing reproductive system. MAFR-1 levels inversely correlate with stored intestinal lipids, in part by influencing the expression of the lipogenesis enzymes fasn-1/FASN and pod-2/ACC1. Animals fed a high carbohydrate diet exhibit reduced mafr-1 expression and mutations in the insulin signaling pathway genes daf-18/PTEN and daf-16/FoxO abrogate the lipid storage defects associated with deregulated mafr-1 expression. Our results reveal physiological roles for mafr-1 in regulating organismal lipid homeostasis, which ensure reproductive success.

Abstract: Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant bone tumor with a very poor prognosis. Treating osteosarcoma remains a challenge due to its high transitivity. Tenascin-C, with large molecular weight variants including different combinations of its alternative spliced FNIII repeats, is specifically over expressed in tumor tissues. This study examined the expression of Tenascin-C FNIIIA1 in osteosarcoma tissues, and estimated the effect of mechanical stimulation on A1 expression in MG-63 cells. Through immunohistochemical analysis, we found that the A1 protein was expressed at a higher level in osteosarcoma tissues than in adjacent normal tissues. By cell migration assay, we observed that there was a significant correlation between A1 expression and MG-63 cell migra-tion. The relation is that Tenascin-C FNIIIA1 can promote MG-63 cell migration. According to our further study into the effect of mechanical stimulation on A1 expression in MG-63 cells, the mRNA and protein levels of A1 were significantly up-regulated under mechanical stress with the mTOR molecule proving indispensable. Meanwhile, 4E-BP1 and S6K1 (downstream molecule of mTOR) are necessary for A1 normal expression in MG-63 cells whether or not mechanical stress has been encountered. We found that Tenascin-C FNIIIA1 is over-expressed in osteosar-coma tissues and can promote MG-63 cell migration. Furthermore, mechanical stress can facilitate MG-63 cell migration though facilitating A1 overexpression with the necessary molecules (mTOR, 4E-BP1 and S6K1). In con-clusion, high expression of A1 may promote the meta-stasis of osteosarcoma by facilitating MG-63 cell migration. Tenascin-C FNIIIA1 could be used as an indicator in metastatic osteosarcoma patients.

Abstract: Summary
Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics provides a powerful approach to globally investigate the biological function of individual cell types in mammalian organs. Here, we applied this technology to the in-depth analysis of purified hepatic cell types from mouse. We quantified 11,520 proteins, making this the most comprehensive proteomic resource of any organ to date. Global protein copy number determination demonstrated that a large proportion of the hepatocyte proteome is dedicated to fatty acid and xenobiotic metabolism. We identified as-yet-unknown components of the TGF-β signaling pathway and extracellular matrix in hepatic stellate cells, uncovering their regulative role in liver physiology. Moreover, our high-resolution proteomic data set enabled us to compare the distinct functional roles of hepatic cell types in cholesterol flux, cellular trafficking, and growth factor receptor signaling. This study provides a comprehensive resource for liver biology and biomedicine.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy promotes tumor growth by generating nutrients from the degradation of intracellular structures. Here we establish, using shRNAs, a dominant-negative mutant, and a pharmacologic inhibitor, mefenamic acid (MFA), that the Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 3 (TRPM3) channel promotes the growth of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and stimulates MAP1LC3A (LC3A) and MAP1LC3B (LC3B) autophagy. Increased expression of TRPM3 in RCC leads to Ca2+ influx, activation of CAMKK2, AMPK, and ULK1, and phagophore formation. In addition, TRPM3 Ca2+ and Zn2+ fluxes inhibit miR-214, which directly targets LC3A and LC3B. The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL) represses TRPM3 directly through miR-204 and indirectly through another miR-204 target, Caveolin 1 (CAV1).

Mgr2 Functions as Lateral Gatekeeper for Preprotein Sorting in the Mitochondrial Inner Membrane,

Abstract: Summary
The majority of preproteins destined for mitochondria carry N-terminal presequences. The presequence translocase of the inner mitochondrial membrane (TIM23 complex) plays a central role in protein sorting. Preproteins are either translocated through the TIM23 complex into the matrix or are laterally released into the inner membrane. We report that the small hydrophobic protein Mgr2 controls the lateral release of preproteins. Mgr2 interacts with preproteins in transit through the TIM23 complex. Overexpression of Mgr2 delays preprotein release, whereas a lack of Mgr2 promotes preprotein sorting into the inner membrane. Preproteins with a defective inner membrane sorting signal are translocated into the matrix in wild-type mitochondria but are released into the inner membrane in Mgr2-deficient mitochondria. We conclude that Mgr2 functions as a lateral gatekeeper of the mitochondrial presequence translocase, providing quality control for the membrane sorting of preproteins.

Abstract: Summary
Proper niche architecture is critical for stem cell function, yet only few upstream regulators are known. Here, we report that the Hox transcription factor Abdominal-B (Abd-B), active in premeiotic spermatocytes of Drosophila testes, is essential for positioning the niche to the testis anterior by regulating integrin in neighboring somatic cyst cells. Abd-B also non-cell-autonomously controls critical features within the niche, including centrosome orientation and division rates of germline stem cells. By using genome-wide binding studies, we find that Abd-B mediates its effects on integrin localization by directly controlling at multiple levels the signaling activity of the Sev ligand Boss via its direct targets src42A and sec63, two genes involved in protein trafficking and recycling. Our data show that Abd-B, through local signaling between adjucent cell types, provides positional cues for integrin localization, which is critical for placement of the distant stem cell niche and stem cell activity.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in KRAS are prevalent in human cancers and universally predictive of resistance to anticancer therapeutics. Although it is widely accepted that acquisition of an activating mutation endows RAS genes with functional autonomy, recent studies suggest that the wild-type forms of Ras may contribute to mutant Ras-driven tumorigenesis. Here, we show that downregulation of wild-type H-Ras or N-Ras in mutant K-Ras cancer cells leads to hyperactivation of the Erk/p90RSK and PI3K/Akt pathways and, consequently, the phosphorylation of Chk1 at an inhibitory site, Ser 280. The resulting inhibition of ATR/Chk1 signaling abrogates the activation of the G2 DNA damage checkpoint and confers specific sensitization of mutant K-Ras cancer cells to DNA damage chemotherapeutic agents in vitro and in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Ubiquitination of transcription activators has been reported to regulate transcription via both proteolytic and nonproteolytic routes, yet the function of the ubiquitin (Ub) signal in the nonproteolytic process is poorly understood. By use of the heterologous transcription activator LexA-VP16 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we show that monoubiquitin fusion of the activator prevents stable interactions between the activator and DNA, leading to transcription inhibition without activator degradation. We identify the AAA+ ATPase Cdc48 and its cofactors as the Ub receptor responsible for extracting the monoubiquitinated activator from DNA. Our results suggest that deubiquitination of the activator is critical for transcription activation. These findings with LexA-VP16 extend in both yeast and mammalian cells to native transcription activators Met4 and R-Smads, respectively, that are known to be oligo-ubiquitinated. The results illustrate a role for Ub and Cdc48 in transcriptional regulation and gene expression that is independent of proteolysis.

Abstract: Summary
Nephrons, the functional units of the kidney, develop from progenitor cells (cap mesenchyme [CM]) surrounding the epithelial ureteric bud (UB) tips. Reciprocal signaling between UB and CM induces nephrogenesis and UB branching. Although low nephron number is implicated in hypertension and renal disease, the mechanisms that determine nephron number are obscure. To test the importance of nephron progenitor cell number, we genetically ablated 40% of these cells, asking whether this would limit kidney size and nephron number or whether compensatory mechanisms would allow the developing organ to recover. The reduction in CM cell number decreased the rate of branching, which in turn allowed the number of CM cells per UB tip to normalize, revealing a self-correction mechanism. However, the retarded UB branching impaired kidney growth, leaving a permanent nephron deficit. Thus, the number of fetal nephron progenitor cells is an important determinant of nephron endowment, largely via its effect on UB branching.

Abstract: Summary
The myogenic regulatory genes Myf5, Mrf4, Myod, and Myogenin likely arose by gene duplications during evolution, presumably to address the more demanding requirements of the vertebrate body plan. Two cell lineages were proposed to be regulated independently by Myf5 and Myod to safeguard against tissue failure. Here we report severe muscle loss following ablation of Myf5-expressing cells. Using both lineage-specific and ubiquitous reporter alleles, we show that the remaining muscles in Myf5Cre-DTA embryos arise mainly from Myf5+ escaper cells. Elimination of Myf5Cre-DTA cells on a Myod null background did not result in the total absence of skeletal muscles, as would be expected if a Myod+/Myf5-independent cell population played a major role in this scenario. Therefore, these observations are incompatible with a previously proposed functional two-lineage model. These findings will have an impact on the interpretation of phenotypes obtained using similar strategies in other tissues.

Abstract: Summary
Posttranscriptional regulatory programs governing diverse aspects of RNA biology remain largely uncharacterized. Understanding the functional roles of RNA cis-regulatory elements is essential for decoding complex programs that underlie the dynamic regulation of transcript stability, splicing, localization, and translation. Here, we describe a combined experimental/computational technology to reveal a catalog of functional regulatory elements embedded in 3′ UTRs of human transcripts. We used a bidirectional reporter system coupled with flow cytometry and high-throughput sequencing to measure the effect of short, noncoding, vertebrate-conserved RNA sequences on transcript stability and translation. Information-theoretic motif analysis of the resulting sequence-to-gene-expression mapping revealed linear and structural RNA cis-regulatory elements that positively and negatively modulate the posttranscriptional fates of human transcripts. This combined experimental/computational strategy can be used to systematically characterize the vast landscape of posttranscriptional regulatory elements controlling physiological and pathological cellular state transitions.

Abstract: Summary
The gut microbiome and daily feeding/fasting cycle influence host metabolism and contribute to obesity and metabolic diseases. However, fundamental characteristics of this relationship between the feeding/fasting cycle and the gut microbiome are unknown. Our studies show that the gut microbiome is highly dynamic, exhibiting daily cyclical fluctuations in composition. Diet-induced obesity dampens the daily feeding/fasting rhythm and diminishes many of these cyclical fluctuations. Time-restricted feeding (TRF), in which feeding is consolidated to the nocturnal phase, partially restores these cyclical fluctuations. Furthermore, TRF, which protects against obesity and metabolic diseases, affects bacteria shown to influence host metabolism. Cyclical changes in the gut microbiome from feeding/fasting rhythms contribute to the diversity of gut microflora and likely represent a mechanism by which the gut microbiome affects host metabolism. Thus, feeding pattern and time of harvest, in addition to diet, are important parameters when assessing the microbiome’s contribution to host metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Formative cell divisions are critical for multicellular patterning. In the early plant embryo, such divisions follow from orienting the division plane. A major unanswered question is how division plane orientation is genetically controlled, and in particular whether this relates to cell geometry. We have generated a complete 4D map of early Arabidopsis embryogenesis and used computational analysis to demonstrate that several divisions follow a rule that uses the smallest wall area going through the center of the cell. In other cases, however, cell division clearly deviates from this rule, which invariably leads to asymmetric cell division. By analyzing mutant embryos and through targeted genetic perturbation, we show that response to the hormone auxin triggers a deviation from the “shortest wall” rule. Our work demonstrates that a simple default rule couples division orientation to cell geometry in the embryo and that genetic regulation can create patterns by overriding the default rule.

Abstract: Summary
The underlying molecular genetic basis of combined hyperlipidemia, the most common atherogenic lipid disorder, is poorly characterized. Rare, nonconservative mutations in the Wnt coreceptor, LRP6, underlie autosomal dominant atherosclerosis, combined hyperlipidemia, and fatty liver disease. Mice with LRP6R611C mutation similarly developed elevated plasma LDL and TG levels and fatty liver. Further investigation showed that LRP6R611C mutation triggers hepatic de novo lipogenesis, lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis, and apoB secretion by an Sp1-dependent activation of IGF1, AKT, and both mTORC1 and mTORC2. These pathways were normalized after in vitro treatment of primary hepatocytes from LRP6R611C mice with either the IGF1R antagonist PPP, rapamycin, or rmWnt3a. Strikingly, in vivo administration of rmWnt3a to LRP6R611C mice normalized the altered expression of enzymes of DNL and cholesterol biosynthesis, and restored plasma TG and LDL levels to normal. These findings identify Wnt signaling as a regulator of plasma lipids and a target for treatment of hyperlipidemia.

Abstract: Summary
Gestational diabetes (GDM) results from failure of the β cells to adapt to increased metabolic demands; however, the cause of GDM and the extremely high rate of progression to type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains unknown. Using metabolomics, we show that the furan fatty acid metabolite 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropanoic acid (CMPF) is elevated in the plasma of humans with GDM, as well as impaired glucose-tolerant and T2D patients. In mice, diabetic levels of plasma CMPF induced glucose intolerance, impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and decreased glucose utilization. Mechanistically, we show that CMPF acts directly on the β cell, causing impaired mitochondrial function, decreasing glucose-induced ATP accumulation, and inducing oxidative stress, resulting in dysregulation of key transcription factors and ultimately reduced insulin biosynthesis. Importantly, specifically blocking its transport through OAT3 or antioxidant treatment could prevent CMPF-induced β cell dysfunction. Thus, CMPF provides a link between β cell dysfunction and GDM/T2D that could be targeted therapeutically.

Abstract: We identified four basic amino acid residues as nuclear localization signals (NLS) in the C-terminal domain of the prototype foamy viral (PFV) integrase (IN) protein that were essential for viral replication. We constructed seven point mutants in the C-terminal domain by changing the lysine and arginine at residues 305, 308, 313, 315, 318, 324, and 329 to threonine or proline, respectively, to identify residues conferring NLS activity. Our results showed that mutation of these residues had no effect on expression assembly, release of viral particles, or in vitro recombinant IN enzymatic activity. However, mutations at residues 305 (R → T), 313(R → T), 315(R → P), and 329(R → T) lead to the production of defective viral particles with loss of infectivity, whereas non-defective mutations at residues 308(R → T), 318(K → T), and 324(K → T) did not show any adverse effects on subsequent production or release of viral particles. Sub-cellular fractionation and immunostaining for viral protein PFV-IN and PFV-Gag localization revealed predominant cytoplasmic localization of PFV-IN in defective mutants, whereas cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of PFV-IN was observed in wild type and non-defective mutants. However sub-cellular localization of PFV-Gag resulted in predominant nuclear localization and less presence in the cytoplasm of the wild type and non-defective mutants. But defective mutants showed only nuclear localization of Gag. Therefore, we postulate that four basic arginine residues at 305, 313, 315 and 329 confer the karyoplilic properties of PFV-IN and are essential for successful viral integration and replication.

Abstract: Summary
DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs), highly toxic lesions that covalently link the Watson and Crick strands of the double helix, are repaired by a complex, replication-coupled pathway in higher eukaryotes. The earliest DNA processing event in ICL repair is the incision of parental DNA on either side of the ICL (“unhooking”), which allows lesion bypass. Incisions depend critically on the Fanconi anemia pathway, whose activation involves ubiquitylation of the FANCD2 protein. Using Xenopus egg extracts, which support replication-coupled ICL repair, we show that the 3′ flap endonuclease XPF-ERCC1 cooperates with SLX4/FANCP to carry out the unhooking incisions. Efficient recruitment of XPF-ERCC1 and SLX4 to the ICL depends on FANCD2 and its ubiquitylation. These data help define the molecular mechanism by which the Fanconi anemia pathway promotes a key event in replication-coupled ICL repair.

Abstract: Summary
The circadian clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that controls daily rhythms. For the proper circadian gene expression, dynamic changes in chromatin structure are important. Although chromatin modifiers have been shown to play a role in circadian gene expression, the in vivo role of circadian signal-modulated chromatin modifiers at an organism level remains to be elucidated. Here, we provide evidence that the lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) is phosphorylated by protein kinase Cα (PKCα) in a circadian manner and the phosphorylated LSD1 forms a complex with CLOCK:BMAL1 to facilitate E-box-mediated transcriptional activation. Knockin mice bearing phosphorylation-defective Lsd1SA/SA alleles exhibited altered circadian rhythms in locomotor behavior with attenuation of rhythmic expression of core clock genes and impaired phase resetting of circadian clock. These data demonstrate that LSD1 is a key component of the molecular circadian oscillator, which plays a pivotal role in rhythmicity and phase resetting of the circadian clock.

Abstract: Summary
Global patterns of DNA methylation, mediated by the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), are disrupted in all cancers by mechanisms that remain largely unknown, hampering their development as therapeutic targets. Combinatorial acute depletion of all DNMTs in a pluripotent human tumor cell line, followed by epigenome and transcriptome analysis, revealed DNMT functions in fine detail. DNMT3B occupancy regulates methylation during differentiation, whereas an unexpected interplay was discovered in which DNMT1 and DNMT3B antithetically regulate methylation and hydroxymethylation in gene bodies, a finding confirmed in other cell types. DNMT3B mediated non-CpG methylation, whereas DNMT3L influenced the activity of DNMT3B toward non-CpG versus CpG site methylation. Altogether, these data reveal functional targets of each DNMT, suggesting that isoform selective inhibition would be therapeutically advantageous.

Abstract: Summary
JNK and p38 phosphorylate a diverse set of substrates and, consequently, can act in a context-dependent manner to either promote or inhibit tumor growth. Elucidating the functions of specific substrates of JNK and p38 is therefore critical for our understanding of these kinases in cancer. ATF2 is a phosphorylation-dependent transcription factor and substrate of both JNK and p38. Here, we show ATF2 suppresses tumor formation in an orthotopic model of liver cancer and cellular transformation in vitro. Furthermore, we find that suppression of tumorigenesis by JNK requires ATF2. We identify a transcriptional program activated by JNK via ATF2 and provide examples of JNK- and ATF2-dependent genes that block cellular transformation. Significantly, we also show that ATF2-dependent gene expression is frequently downregulated in human cancers, indicating that amelioration of JNK-ATF2-mediated suppression may be a common event during tumor development.

Abstract: Summary
Interchromosomal associations can regulate gene expression, but little is known about the molecular basis of such associations. In response to antigen stimulation, naive T cells can differentiate into Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells expressing IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-17, respectively. We previously reported that in naive T cells, the IFN-γ locus is associated with the Th2 cytokine locus. Here we show that the Th2 locus additionally associates with the IL-17 locus. This association requires a DNase I hypersensitive region (RHS6) at the Th2 locus. RHS6 and the IL-17 promoter both bear Oct-1 binding sites. Deletion of either of these sites or Oct-1 gene impairs the association. Oct-1 and CTCF bind their cognate sites cooperatively, and CTCF deficiency similarly impairs the association. Finally, defects in the association lead to enhanced IL-17 induction. Collectively, our data indicate Th17 lineage differentiation is restrained by the Th2 locus via interchromosomal associations organized by Oct-1 and CTCF.

Abstract: Summary
There is good evidence for functional interactions between splicing and transcription in eukaryotes, but how and why these processes are coupled remain unknown. Prp5 protein (Prp5p) is an RNA-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) required for prespliceosome formation in yeast. We demonstrate through in vivo RNA labeling that, in addition to a splicing defect, the prp5-1 mutation causes a defect in the transcription of intron-containing genes. We present chromatin immunoprecipitation evidence for a transcriptional elongation defect in which RNA polymerase that is phosphorylated at Ser5 of the largest subunit’s heptad repeat accumulates over introns and that this defect requires Cus2 protein. A similar accumulation of polymerase was observed when prespliceosome formation was blocked by a mutation in U2 snRNA. These results indicate the existence of a transcriptional elongation checkpoint that is associated with prespliceosome formation during cotranscriptional spliceosome assembly. We propose a role for Cus2p as a potential checkpoint factor in transcription.

Abstract: Summary
RNase L is an ankyrin repeat domain-containing dual endoribonuclease-pseudokinase that is activated by unusual 2,′5′-oligoadenylate (2-5A) second messengers and which impedes viral infections in higher vertebrates. Despite its importance in interferon-regulated antiviral innate immunity, relatively little is known about its precise mechanism of action. Here we present a functional characterization of 2.5 Å and 3.25 Å X-ray crystal and small-angle X-ray scattering structures of RNase L bound to a natural 2-5A activator with and without ADP or the nonhydrolysable ATP mimetic AMP-PNP. These studies reveal how recognition of 2-5A through interactions with the ankyrin repeat domain and the pseudokinase domain, together with nucleotide binding, imposes a rigid intertwined dimer configuration that is essential for RNase catalytic and antiviral functions. The involvement of the pseudokinase domain of RNase L in 2-5A sensing, nucleotide binding, dimerization, and ribonuclease functions highlights the evolutionary adaptability of the eukaryotic protein kinase fold.

Abstract: Summary
One promising approach for in vivo studies of cell proliferation is the FUCCI system (fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator). Here, we report the development of a Drosophila-specific FUCCI system (Fly-FUCCI) that allows one to distinguish G1, S, and G2 phases of interphase. Fly-FUCCI relies on fluorochrome-tagged degrons from the Cyclin B and E2F1 proteins, which are degraded by the ubiquitin E3-ligases APC/C and CRL4Cdt2, during mitosis or the onset of S phase, respectively. These probes can track cell-cycle patterns in cultured Drosophila cells, eye and wing imaginal discs, salivary glands, the adult midgut, and probably other tissues. To support a broad range of experimental applications, we have generated a toolkit of transgenic Drosophila lines that express the Fly-FUCCI probes under control of the UASt, UASp, QUAS, and ubiquitin promoters. The Fly-FUCCI system should be a valuable tool for visualizing cell-cycle activity during development, tissue homeostasis, and neoplastic growth.

Abstract: Summary
Prdm16 is a transcription factor that regulates the thermogenic gene program in brown and beige adipocytes. However, whether Prdm16 is required for the development or physiological function of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in vivo has been unclear. By analyzing mice that selectively lacked Prdm16 in the brown adipose lineage, we found that Prdm16 was dispensable for embryonic BAT development. However, Prdm16 was required in young mice to suppress the expression of white-fat-selective genes in BAT through recruitment of the histone methyltransferase Ehmt1. Additionally, Prdm16 deficiency caused a severe adult-onset decline in the thermogenic character of interscapular BAT. This resulted in BAT dysfunction and cold sensitivity but did not predispose the animals to obesity. Interestingly, the loss of brown fat identity due to ablation of Prdm16 was accelerated by concurrent deletion of the closely related Prdm3 gene. Together, these results show that Prdm16 and Prdm3 control postnatal BAT identity and function.

Abstract: Summary
Treatment of fractured bones involves correction of displacement or angulation, known as reduction. However, angulated long-bone fractures in infants often heal and regain proper morphology spontaneously, without reduction. To study the mechanism underlying spontaneous regeneration of fractured bones, we left humeral fractures induced in newborn mice unstabilized, and rapid realignment of initially angulated bones was seen. This realignment was surprisingly not mediated by bone remodeling, but instead involved substantial movement of the two fragments prior to callus ossification. Analysis of gene expression profiles, cell proliferation, and bone growth revealed the formation of a functional, bidirectional growth plate at the concave side of the fracture. This growth plate acts like a mechanical jack, generating opposing forces that straighten the two fragments. Finally, we show that muscle force is important in this process, as blocking muscle contraction disrupts growth plate formation, leading to premature callus ossification and failed reduction.

Abstract: Summary
Healthy aging depends on removal of damaged cellular material that is in part mediated by autophagy. The nutritional status of cells affects both aging and autophagy through as-yet-elusive metabolic circuitries. Here, we show that nucleocytosolic acetyl-coenzyme A (AcCoA) production is a metabolic repressor of autophagy during aging in yeast. Blocking the mitochondrial route to AcCoA by deletion of the CoA-transferase ACH1 caused cytosolic accumulation of the AcCoA precursor acetate. This led to hyperactivation of nucleocytosolic AcCoA-synthetase Acs2p, triggering histone acetylation, repression of autophagy genes, and an age-dependent defect in autophagic flux, culminating in a reduced lifespan. Inhibition of nutrient signaling failed to restore, while simultaneous knockdown of ACS2 reinstated, autophagy and survival of ach1 mutant. Brain-specific knockdown of Drosophila AcCoA synthetase was sufficient to enhance autophagic protein clearance and prolong lifespan. Since AcCoA integrates various nutrition pathways, our findings may explain diet-dependent lifespan and autophagy regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Epithelial reorganization involves coordinated changes in cell shapes and movements. This restructuring occurs during formation of placodes, ectodermal thickenings that initiate the morphogenesis of epithelial organs including hair, mammary gland, and tooth. Signaling pathways in ectodermal placode formation are well known, but the cellular mechanisms have remained ill defined. We established imaging methodology for live visualization of embryonic skin explants during the first wave of hair placode formation. We found that the vast majority of placodal cells were nonproliferative throughout morphogenesis. We show that cell compaction and centripetal migration are the main cellular mechanisms associated with hair placode morphogenesis and that inhibition of actin remodeling suppresses placode formation. Stimulation of both ectodysplasin/NF-κB and Wnt/β-catenin signaling increased cell motility and the number of cells committed to placodal fate. Thus, cell fate choices and morphogenetic events are controlled by the same molecular pathways, providing the framework for coordination of these two processes.

Abstract: We have examined cytokeratin distribution and their nature in toe pads of the Himalayan tree-frog Philautus annandalii. Toe pads are expanded tips of digits and show modifications of their ventral epidermis for adhesion. The toe pad epidermal cells, being organized into 3–4 rows, possess keratin bundles, especially in surface nanostructures that are involved in adhesion. Immunohistochemical localization using a pan-cytokeratin antibody revealed that cytokeratin immunoreactivity is the strongest in the mid- to basal cell rows of the epidermis, which parallels our previous ultrastructural observation of dense keratin bundles present in this part of the epidermis. The remainder of the epidermis (i.e., the superficial cell layer) showed little immunoreactivity. Immunoblot analysis revealed that toe-pads possessed keratins prominently in the molecular mass of 50kDa. Possible presence of keratin 5 in toe pad epidermis has been correlated with its usual distribution pattern in mammalian epidermis.

Abstract: Summary
The C-type lectin CD161 is expressed by a large proportion of human T lymphocytes of all lineages, including a population known as mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells. To understand whether different T cell subsets expressing CD161 have similar properties, we examined these populations in parallel using mass cytometry and mRNA microarray approaches. The analysis identified a conserved CD161++/MAIT cell transcriptional signature enriched in CD161+CD8+ T cells, which can be extended to CD161+ CD4+ and CD161+TCRγδ+ T cells. Furthermore, this led to the identification of a shared innate-like, TCR-independent response to interleukin (IL)-12 plus IL-18 by different CD161-expressing T cell populations. This response was independent of regulation by CD161, which acted as a costimulatory molecule in the context of T cell receptor stimulation. Expression of CD161 hence identifies a transcriptional and functional phenotype, shared across human T lymphocytes and independent of both T cell receptor (TCR) expression and cell lineage.

Abstract: Intracellular Ca2+ concentrations are tightly regulated, and elevated levels sustained over periods of time can cause cellular deterioration. The putative role of dysregulated intracellular Ca2+ in Alzheimer's disease had led to the hypothesis that controlling intracellular Ca2+ may forestall cognitive decline. Lithium has been shown to reduce intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. Two well-characterized neuronal targets of lithium that may affect intracellular Ca2+ levels are N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and inositol monophosphatase (IMP). Results from a recent single-center placebo-controlled randomized trial suggest that long-term lithium treatment at subtherapeutic doses may have the potential to delay the progression of disease, and observational studies have shown that lithium reduces the prevalence of dementia in subjects with bipolar disorder on long-term lithium therapy. I am advancing the hypothesis that lithium may protect against cognitive decline by stabilizing intracellular Ca2+ through a dual, synergistic mechanism of targeting both extracellular and intracellular sites, via antagonizing NMDA-receptors and inhibiting IMP. Insights derived from this hypothesis could lead to an improved understanding of the molecular pathology of Alzheimer's disease, and have implications on the evaluation and use of therapeutics that alter intracellular Ca2+ levels.

Abstract: Summary
Although thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are localized in the nucleus, only a few dozen have been functionally characterized. Here we show that nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1), an essential lncRNA for the formation of nuclear body paraspeckles, is induced by influenza virus and herpes simplex virus infection as well as by Toll-like receptor3-p38 pathway-triggered poly I:C stimulation, resulting in excess formation of paraspeckles. We found that NEAT1 facilitates the expression of antiviral genes including cytokines such as interleukin-8 (IL8). We found that splicing factor proline/glutamine-rich (SFPQ), a NEAT1-binding paraspeckle protein, is a repressor of IL8 transcription, and that NEAT1 induction relocates SFPQ from the IL8 promoter to the paraspeckles, leading to transcriptional activation of IL8. Together, our data show that NEAT1 plays an important role in the innate immune response through the transcriptional regulation of antiviral genes by the stimulus-responsive cooperative action of NEAT1 and SFPQ.

Abstract: Summary
Patients with Down syndrome (DS) invariably develop Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology in their 40s. We have recently found that overexpression of a chromosome 21-encoded microRNA-155 results in decreased levels of the membrane trafficking component, SNX27, diminishing glutamate receptor recycling and thereby impairing synaptic functions in DS. Here, we report a function of SNX27 in regulating β-amyloid (Aβ) generation by modulating γ-secretase activity. Downregulation of SNX27 using RNAi increased Aβ production, whereas overexpression of full-length SNX27, but not SNX27ΔPDZ, reversed the RNAi-mediated Aβ elevation. Moreover, genetic deletion of Snx27 promoted Aβ production and neuronal loss, whereas overexpression of SNX27 using an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector reduced hippocampal Aβ levels in a transgenic AD mouse model. SNX27 associates with the γ-secretase complex subunit presenilin 1; this interaction dissociates the γ-secretase complex, thus decreasing its proteolytic activity. Our study establishes a molecular mechanism for Aβ-dependent pathogenesis in both DS and AD.

Abstract: Summary
Blockade of colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) limits macrophage infiltration and improves response of mammary carcinomas to chemotherapy. Herein we identify interleukin (IL)-10 expression by macrophages as the critical mediator of this phenotype. Infiltrating macrophages were the primary source of IL-10 within tumors, and therapeutic blockade of IL-10 receptor (IL-10R) was equivalent to CSF-1 neutralization in enhancing primary tumor response to paclitaxel and carboplatin. Improved response to chemotherapy was CD8+ T cell-dependent, but IL-10 did not directly suppress CD8+ T cells or alter macrophage polarization. Instead, IL-10R blockade increased intratumoral dendritic cell expression of IL-12, which was necessary for improved outcomes. In human breast cancer, expression of IL12A and cytotoxic effector molecules were predictive of pathological complete response rates to paclitaxel.

Abstract: Summary
Sorting and degradation of receptors and associated signaling molecules maintain homeostasis of conserved signaling pathways during cell specification and tissue development. Yet, whether machineries that sort signaling proteins act preferentially on different receptors and ligands in different contexts remains mysterious. Here, we show that Vacuolar protein sorting 25, Vps25, a component of ESCRT-II (Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport II), directs preferential endosome-mediated modulation of FGF signaling in limbs. By ENU-induced mutagenesis, we isolated a polydactylous mouse line carrying a hypomorphic mutation of Vps25 (Vps25ENU). Unlike Vps25-null embryos we generated, Vps25ENU/ENU mutants survive until late gestation. Their limbs display FGF signaling enhancement and consequent hyperactivation of the FGF-SHH feedback loop causing polydactyly, whereas WNT and BMP signaling remain unperturbed. Notably, Vps25ENU/ENU Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts exhibit aberrant FGFR trafficking and degradation; however, SHH signaling is unperturbed. These studies establish that the ESCRT-II machinery selectively limits FGF signaling in vertebrate skeletal patterning.

Abstract: Summary
The serine, glycine, one-carbon (SGOC) metabolic network is implicated in cancer pathogenesis, but its general functions are unknown. We carried out a computational reconstruction of the SGOC network and then characterized its expression across thousands of cancer tissues. Pathways including methylation and redox metabolism exhibited heterogeneous expression indicating a strong context dependency of their usage in tumors. From an analysis of coexpression, simultaneous up- or downregulation of nucleotide synthesis, NADPH, and glutathione synthesis was found to be a common occurrence in all cancers. Finally, we developed a method to trace the metabolic fate of serine using stable isotopes, high-resolution mass spectrometry, and a mathematical model. Although the expression of single genes didn’t appear indicative of flux, the collective expression of several genes in a given pathway allowed for successful flux prediction. Altogether, these findings identify expansive and heterogeneous functions for the SGOC metabolic network in human cancer.

Abstract: Summary
We have solved two families of crystal structures of the human Dicer “platform-PAZ-connector helix” cassette in complex with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). The structures possess two adjacently positioned pockets: a 2 nt 3′-overhang-binding pocket within the PAZ domain (3′ pocket) and a phosphate-binding pocket within the platform domain (phosphate pocket). One family of complexes contains a knob-like α-helical protrusion, designated “hDicer-specific helix,” that separates the two pockets and orients the bound siRNA away from the surface of Dicer, which could be indicative of a product release/transfer state. In the second complex, the helical protrusion is melted/disordered and the bound siRNA is aligned toward the surface of Dicer, suggestive of a cleavage-competent state. These structures allow us to propose that the transition from the cleavage-competent to the postulated product release/transfer state may involve release of the 5′-phosphate from the phosphate pocket while retaining the 3′ overhang in the 3′ pocket.

Abstract: Merkel cells (MCs) have been proposed to form a part of the MC-neurite complex with sensory neurons. Many transient receptor potential (TRP) channels have been identified in mammals; however, the activation properties of these channels in oral mucosal MCs remain to be clarified. We investigated the biophysical and pharmacological properties of TRP vanilloid (TRPV)-1, TRPV2, TRPV4, TRP ankyrin (TRPA)-1, and TRP melastatin (TRPM)-8 channels, which are sensitive to osmotic and mechanical stimuli by measurement of intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) using fura-2. We also analyzed their localization patterns through immunofluorescence. MCs showed immunoreaction for TRPV1, TRPV2, TRPV4, TRPA1, and TRPM8 channels. In the presence of extracellular Ca2+, the hypotonic test solution evoked Ca2+ influx. The [Ca2+]i increases were inhibited by TRPV1, TRPV2, TRPV4, or TRPA1 channel antagonists, but not by the TRPM8 channel antagonist. Application of TRPV1, TRPV2, TRPV4, TRPA1, or TRPM8 channel selective agonists elicited transient increases in [Ca2+]i only in the presence of extracellular Ca2+. The results indicate that membrane stretching in MCs activates TRPV1, TRPV2, TRPV4, and TRPA1 channels, that it may be involved in synaptic transmission to sensory neurons, and that MCs could contribute to the mechanosensory transduction sequence.

Abstract: The mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) has long been known to have a role in mitochondrial calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis under pathological conditions as a mediator of the mitochondrial permeability transition and the activation of the consequent cell death mechanism. However, its role in the context of mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis is not yet clear. Several studies that were based on PPIF inhibition or knock out suggested that mPTP is involved in the Ca2+ efflux mechanism, while other observations have revealed the opposite result. The c subunit of the mitochondrial F1/FO ATP synthase has been recently found to be a fundamental component of the mPTP. In this work, we focused on the contribution of the mPTP in the Ca2+ efflux mechanism by modulating the expression of the c subunit. We observed that forcing mPTP opening or closing did not impair mitochondrial Ca2+ efflux. Therefore, our results strongly suggest that the mPTP does not participate in mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis in a physiological context in HeLa cells.

Abstract: Summary
RNA helicases are important regulators of gene expression that act by remodeling RNA secondary structures and RNA-protein interactions. Here, we demonstrate that MOV10 has an ATP-dependent 5′ to 3′ in vitro RNA unwinding activity and determine the RNA-binding sites of MOV10 and its helicase mutants using PAR-CLIP. We find that MOV10 predominantly binds to 3′ UTRs upstream of regions predicted to form local secondary structures and provide evidence that MOV10 helicase mutants are impaired in their ability to translocate 5′ to 3′ on their mRNA targets. MOV10 interacts with UPF1, the key component of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway. PAR-CLIP of UPF1 reveals that MOV10 and UPF1 bind to RNA in close proximity. Knockdown of MOV10 resulted in increased mRNA half-lives of MOV10-bound as well as UPF1-regulated transcripts, suggesting that MOV10 functions in UPF1-mediated mRNA degradation as an RNA clearance factor to resolve structures and displace proteins from 3′ UTRs.

Abstract: In this study, we investigated the presence of ovoid or ellipsoidal amylin-immunoreactive cells of the pancreatic islets of the black-spotted frog Rana (Pelophylax) nigromaculata. Using double immunofluorescent staining, all amylin-immunoreactive cells were shown to be immuno-negative for insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin, and they were often observed in peripheral regions of clusters of insulin-immunoreactive cells. Under immunoelectron microscopy, amylin-immunoreactive signals were detected on the secretory granules in a specific type of endocrine cells. From our results, we conclude that the amylin-immunoreactive cells correspond to X cells among the 4 distinct types of endocrine cells (B, A/PP, D, and X) previously identified in the frog. Amylin secreted from X cells may regulate the hormone secretion from A/PP cells and/or B cells through a paracrine mechanism.

A Divergent Role of the SIRT1-TopBP1 Axis in Regulating Metabolic Checkpoint and DNA Damage Checkpoint,

Abstract: Summary
DNA replication is executed only when cells have sufficient metabolic resources and undamaged DNA. Nutrient limitation and DNA damage cause a metabolic checkpoint and DNA damage checkpoint, respectively. Although SIRT1 activity is regulated by metabolic stress and DNA damage, its function in these stress-mediated checkpoints remains elusive. Here we report that the SIRT1-TopBP1 axis functions as a switch for both checkpoints. With glucose deprivation, SIRT1 is activated and deacetylates TopBP1, resulting in TopBP1-Treslin disassociation and DNA replication inhibition. Conversely, SIRT1 activity is inhibited under genotoxic stress, resulting in increased TopBP1 acetylation that is important for the TopBP1-Rad9 interaction and activation of the ATR-Chk1 pathway. Mechanistically, we showed that acetylation of TopBP1 changes the conformation of TopBP1, thereby facilitating its interaction with distinct partners in DNA replication and checkpoint activation. Taken together, our studies identify the SIRT1-TopBP1 axis as a key signaling mode in the regulation of the metabolic checkpoint and the DNA damage checkpoint.

Abstract: Summary
Somatic mutations in IDH1/IDH2 and TET2 result in impaired TET2-mediated conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). The observation that WT1 inactivating mutations anticorrelate with TET2/IDH1/IDH2 mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) led us to hypothesize that WT1 mutations may impact TET2 function. WT1 mutant AML patients have reduced 5hmC levels similar to TET2/IDH1/IDH2 mutant AML. These mutations are characterized by convergent, site-specific alterations in DNA hydroxymethylation, which drive differential gene expression more than alterations in DNA promoter methylation. WT1 overexpression increases global levels of 5hmC, and WT1 silencing reduced 5hmC levels. WT1 physically interacts with TET2 and TET3, and WT1 loss of function results in a similar hematopoietic differentiation phenotype as observed with TET2 deficiency. These data provide a role for WT1 in regulating DNA hydroxymethylation and suggest that TET2 IDH1/IDH2 and WT1 mutations define an AML subtype defined by dysregulated DNA hydroxymethylation.

Abstract: Summary
Defining the molecular networks that drive breast cancer has led to therapeutic interventions and improved patient survival. However, the aggressive triple-negative breast cancer subtype (TNBC) remains recalcitrant to targeted therapies because its molecular etiology is poorly defined. In this study, we used a forward genetic screen to discover an oncogenic network driving human TNBC. SCYL1, TEX14, and PLK1 (“STP axis”) cooperatively trigger degradation of the REST tumor suppressor protein, a frequent event in human TNBC. The STP axis induces REST degradation by phosphorylating a conserved REST phospho-degron and bridging REST interaction with the ubiquitin-ligase βTRCP. Inhibition of the STP axis leads to increased REST protein levels and impairs TNBC transformation, tumor progression, and metastasis. Expression of the STP axis correlates with low REST protein levels in human TNBCs and poor clinical outcome for TNBC patients. Our findings demonstrate that the STP-REST axis is a molecular driver of human TNBC.

Glutamate Acts as a Key Signal Linking Glucose Metabolism to Incretin/cAMP Action to Amplify Insulin Secretion,

Abstract: Summary
Incretins, hormones released by the gut after meal ingestion, are essential for maintaining systemic glucose homeostasis by stimulating insulin secretion. The effect of incretins on insulin secretion occurs only at elevated glucose concentrations and is mediated by cAMP signaling, but the mechanism linking glucose metabolism and cAMP action in insulin secretion is unknown. We show here, using a metabolomics-based approach, that cytosolic glutamate derived from the malate-aspartate shuttle upon glucose stimulation underlies the stimulatory effect of incretins and that glutamate uptake into insulin granules mediated by cAMP/PKA signaling amplifies insulin release. Glutamate production is diminished in an incretin-unresponsive, insulin-secreting β cell line and pancreatic islets of animal models of human diabetes and obesity. Conversely, a membrane-permeable glutamate precursor restores amplification of insulin secretion in these models. Thus, cytosolic glutamate represents the elusive link between glucose metabolism and cAMP action in incretin-induced insulin secretion.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription factors establish neural diversity and wiring specificity; however, how they orchestrate changes in cell morphology remains poorly understood. The Drosophila Roundabout (Robo) receptors regulate connectivity in the CNS, but how their precise expression domains are established is unknown. Here, we show that the homeodomain transcription factor Hb9 acts upstream of Robo2 and Robo3 to regulate axon guidance in the Drosophila embryo. In ventrally projecting motor neurons, hb9 is required for robo2 expression, and restoring Robo2 activity in hb9 mutants rescues motor axon defects. Hb9 requires its conserved repressor domain and functions in parallel with Nkx6 to regulate robo2. Moreover, hb9 can regulate the medio-lateral position of axons through robo2 and robo3, and restoring robo3 expression in hb9 mutants rescues the lateral position defects of a subset of neurons. Altogether, these data identify Robo2 and Robo3 as key effectors of Hb9 in regulating nervous system development.

Abstract: Summary
The liver and pancreas arise from common endodermal progenitors. How these distinct cell fates are specified is poorly understood. Here we describe prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) as a regulator of endodermal fate specification during development. Modulating PGE2 activity has opposing effects on liver versus pancreas specification in zebrafish embryos as well as mouse endodermal progenitors. The PGE2 synthetic enzyme cox2a and receptor ep2a are patterned such that cells closest to PGE2 synthesis acquire a liver fate, whereas more distant cells acquire a pancreas fate. PGE2 interacts with the bmp2b pathway to regulate fate specification. At later stages of development, PGE2 acting via the ep4a receptor promotes outgrowth of both the liver and pancreas. PGE2 remains important for adult organ growth, as it modulates liver regeneration. This work provides in vivo evidence that PGE2 may act as a morphogen to regulate cell-fate decisions and outgrowth of the embryonic endodermal anlagen.

Abstract: Summary
Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are an important constituent of the macrophage glycocalyx and extracellular microenvironment. To examine their role in atherogenesis, we inactivated the biosynthetic gene N-acetylglucosamine N-deacetylase-N-sulfotransferase 1 (Ndst1) in macrophages and crossbred the strain to Ldlr−/− mice. When placed on an atherogenic diet, Ldlr−/−Ndst1f/fLysMCre+ mice had increased atherosclerotic plaque area and volume compared to Ldlr−/− mice. Diminished sulfation of heparan sulfate resulted in enhanced chemokine expression; increased macrophages in plaques; increased expression of ACAT2, a key enzyme in cholesterol ester storage; and increased foam cell conversion. Motif analysis of promoters of upregulated genes suggested increased type I interferon signaling, which was confirmed by elevation of STAT1 phosphorylation induced by IFN-β. The proinflammatory macrophages derived from Ndst1f/fLysMCre+ mice also sensitized the animals to diet-induced obesity. We propose that macrophage HSPGs control basal activation of macrophages by maintaining type I interferon reception in a quiescent state through sequestration of IFN-β.

Abstract: Infrared neural stimulation (INS) is a promising neurostimulation technique that can activate neural tissue with high spatial precision and without the need for exogenous agents. However, little is understood about how infrared light interacts with neural tissue on a cellular level, particularly within the living brain. In this study, we use calcium sensitive dye imaging on macroscopic and microscopic scales to explore the spatiotemporal effects of INS on cortical calcium dynamics. The INS-evoked calcium signal that was observed exhibited a fast and slow component suggesting activation of multiple cellular mechanisms. The slow component of the evoked signal exhibited wave-like properties suggesting network activation, and was verified to originate from astrocytes through pharmacology and 2-photon imaging. We also provide evidence that the fast calcium signal may have been evoked through modulation of glutamate transients.

Abstract: Summary
Intense noise exposure causes hearing loss by inducing degeneration of spiral ganglia neurites that innervate cochlear hair cells. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) exhibits axon-protective effects in cultured neurons; however, its ability to block degeneration in vivo has been difficult to establish due to its poor cell permeability and serum instability. Here, we describe a strategy to increase cochlear NAD+ levels in mice by administering nicotinamide riboside (NR), a recently described NAD+ precursor. We find that administration of NR, even after noise exposure, prevents noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and spiral ganglia neurite degeneration. These effects are mediated by the NAD+-dependent mitochondrial sirtuin, SIRT3, since SIRT3-overexpressing mice are resistant to NIHL and SIRT3 deletion abrogates the protective effects of NR and expression of NAD+ biosynthetic enzymes. These findings reveal that administration of NR activates a NAD+-SIRT3 pathway that reduces neurite degeneration caused by noise exposure.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding cells as integrated systems requires that we systematically decipher how single genes affect multiple biological processes and how processes are functionally linked. Here, we used multiprocess phenotypic profiling, combining high-resolution 3D confocal microscopy and multiparametric image analysis, to simultaneously survey the fission yeast genome with respect to three key cellular processes: cell shape, microtubule organization, and cell-cycle progression. We identify, validate, and functionally annotate 262 genes controlling specific aspects of those processes. Of these, 62% had not been linked to these processes before and 35% are implicated in multiple processes. Importantly, we identify a conserved role for DNA-damage responses in controlling microtubule stability. In addition, we investigate how the processes are functionally linked. We show unexpectedly that disruption of cell-cycle progression does not necessarily affect cell size control and that distinct aspects of cell shape regulate microtubules and vice versa, identifying important systems-level links across these processes.

Abstract: The oscillation of intracellular calcium (Ca2+) concentration is a primary event in numerous biological processes in plants, including stress response. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), an emerging gasotransmitter, was found to have positive effects in plants responding to chromium (Cr6+) stress through interacting with Ca2+ signaling. While Ca2+ resemblances H2S in mediating biotic and abiotic stresses, crosstalk between the two pathways remains unclear. In this study, Ca2+ signaling interacted with H2S to produce a complex physiological response, which enhanced the Cr6+ tolerance in foxtail millet (Setaria italica). Results indicate that Cr6+ stress activated endogenous H2S synthesis as well as Ca2+ signaling. Moreover, toxic symptoms caused by Cr6+ stress were strongly moderated by 50μM H2S and 20mM Ca2+. Conversely, treatments with H2S synthesis inhibitor and Ca2+ chelators prior to Cr6+-exposure aggravated these toxic symptoms. Interestingly, Ca2+ upregulated expression of two important factors in metal metabolism, MT3A and PCS, which participated in the biosynthesis of heavy metal chelators, in a H2S-dependent manner to cope with Cr6+ stress. These findings also suggest that the H2S dependent pathway is a component of the Ca2+ activating antioxidant system and H2S partially contributes Ca2+-activating antioxidant system.

Abstract: Summary
The fragile X mental retardation protein FMRP regulates translation of its bound mRNAs through incompletely defined mechanisms. FMRP has been linked to the microRNA pathway, and we show here that it associates with the RNA helicase MOV10, also associated with the microRNA pathway. FMRP associates with MOV10 directly and in an RNA-dependent manner and facilitates MOV10’s association with RNAs in brain and cells, suggesting a cooperative interaction. We identified the RNAs recognized by MOV10 using RNA immunoprecipitation and iCLIP. Examination of the fate of MOV10 on RNAs revealed a dual function for MOV10 in regulating translation: it facilitates microRNA-mediated translation of some RNAs, but it also increases expression of other RNAs by preventing AGO2 function. The latter subset was also bound by FMRP in close proximity to the MOV10 binding site, suggesting that FMRP prevents MOV10-mediated microRNA suppression. We have identified a mechanism for FMRP-mediated translational regulation through its association with MOV10.

Abstract: Summary
The basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor Hand2 plays critical roles during cardiac morphogenesis via expression and function within myocardial, neural crest, and epicardial cell populations. Here, we show that Hand2 plays two essential Notch-dependent roles within the endocardium. Endocardial ablation of Hand2 results in failure to develop a patent tricuspid valve, intraventricular septum defects, and hypotrabeculated ventricles, which collectively resemble the human congenital defect tricuspid atresia. We show endocardial Hand2 to be an integral downstream component of a Notch endocardium-to-myocardium signaling pathway and a direct transcriptional regulator of Neuregulin1. Additionally, Hand2 participates in endocardium-to-endocardium-based cell signaling, with Hand2 mutant hearts displaying an increased density of coronary lumens. Molecular analyses further reveal dysregulation of several crucial components of Vegf signaling, including VegfA, VegfR2, Nrp1, and VegfR3. Thus, Hand2 functions as a crucial downstream transcriptional effector of endocardial Notch signaling during both cardiogenesis and coronary vasculogenesis.

Erk Signaling Suppresses Embryonic Stem Cell Self-Renewal to Specify Endoderm,

Abstract: Summary
Fgf signaling via Erk activation has been associated with both neural induction and the generation of a primed state for the differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to all somatic lineages. To dissect the role of Erk in both ESC self-renewal and lineage specification, we explored the requirements for this pathway in various in vitro differentiation settings. A combination of pharmacological inhibition of Erk signaling and genetic loss of function reveal a role for Erk signaling in endodermal, but not neural differentiation. Neural differentiation occurs normally despite a complete block to Erk phosphorylation. In support of this, Erk activation in ESCs derepresses primitive endoderm (PrE) gene expression as a consequence of inhibiting the pluripotent/epiblast network. The early response to Erk activation correlates with functional PrE priming, whereas sustained Erk activity results in PrE differentiation. Taken together, our results suggest that Erk signaling suppresses pluripotent gene expression to enable endodermal differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers regulate chromatin structure during multiple stages of transcription. We report that RSC, an essential chromatin remodeler, is recruited to the open reading frames (ORFs) of actively transcribed genes genome wide, suggesting a role for RSC in regulating transcription elongation. Consistent with such a role, Pol II occupancy in the ORFs of weakly transcribed genes is drastically reduced upon depletion of the RSC catalytic subunit Sth1. RSC inactivation also reduced histone H3 occupancy across transcribed regions. Remarkably, the strongest effects on Pol II and H3 occupancy were confined to the genes displaying the greatest RSC ORF enrichment. Additionally, RSC recruitment to the ORF requires the activities of the SAGA and NuA4 HAT complexes and is aided by the activities of the Pol II CTD Ser2 kinases Bur1 and Ctk1. Overall, our findings strongly implicate ORF-associated RSC in governing Pol II function and in maintaining chromatin structure over transcribed regions.

Abstract: Summary
Chromosomal inversion between 3q21 and 3q26 results in high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this study, we identified a mechanism whereby a GATA2 distal hematopoietic enhancer (G2DHE or −77-kb enhancer) is brought into close proximity to the EVI1 gene in inv(3)(q21;q26) inversions, leading to leukemogenesis. We examined the contribution of G2DHE to leukemogenesis by creating a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic model that recapitulates the inv(3)(q21;q26) allele. Transgenic mice harboring a linked BAC developed leukemia accompanied by EVI1 overexpression—neoplasia that was not detected in mice bearing the same transgene but that was missing the GATA2 enhancer. These results establish the mechanistic basis underlying the pathogenesis of a severe form of leukemia through aberrant expression of the EVI1 proto-oncogene.

Macrophage CGI-58 Deficiency Activates ROS-Inflammasome Pathway to Promote Insulin Resistance in Mice,

Abstract: Summary
Overnutrition activates a proinflammatory program in macrophages to induce insulin resistance (IR), but its molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that saturated fatty acid and lipopolysaccharide, two factors implicated in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced IR, suppress macrophage CGI-58 expression. Macrophage-specific CGI-58 knockout (MaKO) in mice aggravates HFD-induced glucose intolerance and IR, which is associated with augmented systemic/tissue inflammation and proinflammatory activation of adipose tissue macrophages. CGI-58-deficient macrophages exhibit mitochondrial dysfunction due to defective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ signaling. Consequently, they overproduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) to potentiate secretion of proinflammatory cytokines by activating NLRP3 inflammasome. Anti-ROS treatment or NLRP3 silencing prevents CGI-58-deficient macrophages from oversecreting proinflammatory cytokines and from inducing proinflammatory signaling and IR in the cocultured fat slices. Anti-ROS treatment also prevents exacerbation of inflammation and IR in HFD-fed MaKO mice. Our data thus establish CGI-58 as a suppressor of overnutrition-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages.
