Abstract: A novel spectrally selective Cr/AlCrN/AlCrNO/AlCrN/AlCrNO/AlCrO multilayer coating was deposited on stainless steel substrates using cathodic arc ion plating. In this tandem absorber coating, Cr, AlCrN, AlCrNO and AlCrO act as the reflector layer, semi-absorbing layer, the main absorbing layer and the antireflection layer, respectively. The spectral properties of this multilayer coating during long-term annealing in air have been investigated with the aim of evaluating the thermal stability of this aperiodic metal-dielectric multilayer stacks. An average absorptance of 0.90 and emittance of 0.15 are achieved in this multilayer coatings fabricated with optimized parameters. More importantly, the coating exhibits an outstanding thermal stability with a selectivity of 0.94/0.11 even after annealed at 500 °C for 1000 h in air. The microstructure analysis indicate that the multilayer coating consists of aperiodic AlCrN and AlCrON layers in addition to the Cr and AlCrO layers. After the long-term annealing, small amounts of AlN, CrN and Cr2N nanocrystallites are observed to be homogeneously embedded in the AlCrN and AlCrON amorphous matrices. The nanoparticles in the AlCrN and AlCrON layers can effectively scatter the incident light into a broadband wavelength range, increasing the optical path length in the absorbing layers and thus resulting in a pronounced enhancement in the absorptivity. A handful of Cr2O3 and Al2O3 nanograins are observed to embedd in the amorphous AlCrO antireflection layer, which can efficitively reflect the solar infrared radiation and the thermal emittance from the substrate and thus result in pretty low infrared emissivity. The good thermal stability is attributed to the excellent thermal stability of the cermet-based amorphous matrices and the sluggish atomic diffusion in the nanoparticles, which could effectively slow down the inward diffusion of oxygen and avoid agglomeration of naonparticles. These results suggest that the AlCrON-based selective absorbing coating is a good candidate for photo-thermal conversion at high temperatures.

Abstract: Objective/background
The quality of life (QOL) of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients and their caregivers decreases during the first 8 days after HSCT.
Methods
This prospective pilot study collected preliminary data on the impact of posttransplant living arrangements (hospital hospitality house [HHH] vs. hotel, apartment, or house [“hotel”]) and other factors on the QOL of HSCT patients and their caregivers. The predefined primary end point was QOL of patients and their caregivers on Day 30 (QOL30) as measured by the linear analog self-assessment (LASA).
Results
Forty-four HSCT patients participated (HHH 23, hotel 21; allogeneic 18, autologous 26). No significant differences in QOL30 (mean LASA score) were noted between patient groups (55.6 [HHH] vs. 72.2 [hotel], p = .06) or between caregiver groups (77.8 [HHH] vs. 88.9 [hotel], p = .20). Multivariate analysis for QOL30 showed that baseline QOL (p = .006) and age (p = .049) were significant predictors of QOL30 after adjustment for sex, post-HSCT living place, and transplant type. Older patients (≥60 years) had a significantly lower QOL30 than younger patients (mean score, 51.6 vs. 75.3; p = .02).
Conclusion
Efforts to improve QOL30 of HSCT patients and caregivers in the confined environment of an HHH should focus on patients with low baseline QOL and older patients.

Abstract: Quantum-dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) usually suffer from a strong recombination effect or low stability, resulting in a low efficiency and limiting their practical application. A facile liquid-phase synthesis of antimonene quantum dots (AMQDs) with unique morphology and size distribution is demonstrated, and applied as an effective photoactive material in QDSSCs for the first time. The intrinsic advantages of AMQDs, in association with a strong light–matter interaction, moderate energy band-gap in the visible range and antioxidation properties, enable an impressive photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) to be obtained, where the hysteresis-free AMQD-based solar cells can reach up to 3.07%. Furthermore, the as-fabricated solar cell shows a long-term stability, where the PCE value maintains to more than 90% of the initial value after 1000 h. In view of highly cost-effective synthesis and outstanding photoelectrochemical performance, we anticipate that AMQDs will have a promising future in solar cells and related photonics applications. AMQDs may provide a new direction for the rapidly developing photovoltaic technology, which is necessary for further developments in this field.

Abstract: The authors report here a significant progress in side-pumped solar laser slope efficiency by pumping a 3.0 mm diameter, 30 mm length Nd:YAG single-crystal laser rod through a heliostat-parabolic mirror solar energy collection and concentration system with 0.9 m2 effective collection area. A large fused silica aspheric lens allowed an efficient focusing of the concentrated solar power from the focal zone of the parabolic mirror into the laser rod mounted within a novel two-dimensional semi-cylindrical pump cavity. 15.3 W continuous-wave 1064 nm solar laser power was measured, resulting in 5.40% slope efficiency and 2.43% solar-to-laser conversion efficency, being 2.08 and 2.30 times, respectively, more than the previous records by side-pumping configuration. The 5.40% slope efficiency is also 1.08 times more than the previous record with Nd:YAG single-crystal rod by end-side-pumping approach. By adopting an asymmetric laser resonator, this novel side-pumping scheme also enabled an efficient production of high-quality solar laser beams in either TEM11 (4.0 W), TEM01* (doughnut-shaped, 2.9 W), TEM10 (3.2 W) or TEM00 (2.8 W) mode profiles.

Abstract: Background
Gene fusions and products have been identified as oncogenic drivers in many cancers, making them attractive diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets. However, the landscape of fusion transcripts in bladder cancer has not been fully characterized.
Methods
To identify fusion transcripts with potential therapeutic or diagnostic values, TCGA bladder urothelial carcinoma RNA-sequencing dataset was used. In order to avoid false positives, we applied multiple criteria including filtering out fusions detected in normal samples from GTEx dataset. We validated a subset of candidate fusions with a collection of bladder cancer and adjacent normal samples.
Result
We identified 19,547 high confidence fusion genes from 414 bladder cancer samples. After filtering off M/M fusions, fusions in GTEx normal samples, and occurrence frequency <5, we obtained a list of 271 gene fusions, 13 of which were novel and specific to cancer samples. Six of those fusions were validated using cell lines and clinical samples. We discovered that two chimeric RNAs, BCL2L2-PABPN1 and CHFR-GOLGA3, were detected to be expressed significantly higher in bladder cancer samples compared to adjacent normal samples. Impressively, the wild-type of the parental genes were not differentially expressed. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that these two fusions are generated by cis-splicing between adjacent genes. These two fusions were detected mainly in the fraction of cell nucleus, suggesting a potential long noncoding RNA role.
Conclusion
Our findings provide a panoramic view of the landscape of chimeric RNAs in bladder cancer. Some frequent chimeric RNAs are generated by intergenic splicing, and represent a new repertoire for potential biomarkers.

Abstract: We present high stability of semi-transparent methyl ammonium (MA) lead triiodide perovskite (MAPbI3) solar cells with sputter–deposited polycrystalline NiOx hole transport layer (HTL) and indium tin oxide (ITO) back contact. We have demonstrated high thermal stability of the MAPbI3 perovskite devices with the NiOx HTL and glass encapsulations, showing no performance degradation at 85 °C over 1000 h in dark. They showed instability, however, under 1 sun illumination at ∼30 °C. Here, we demonstrate that the combination of the NiOx HTL and the ITO for both top and bottom electrodes of the perovskite solar cells can solve this instability problem. This approach resulted in highly stable semitransparent devices with the average visible light transmittance (AVT) above 11% and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.5%, showing steady power output nearly 4000 h of continuous operation at MPPT under 1 sun illumination. While the use of poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl) (PTAA) HTL resulted in the semitransparent devices with higher PCE of 13.6%, their device stabilities were much inferior to the NiOx HTL based devices. These results indicated that a rather classical MA based perovskite, MAPbI3, is indeed a stable photovoltaic material with the proper choice of the interface layers and electrode materials, and the use of the sputter–deposited NiOx HTL together with the ITO back contact is one of the key elements to overcome the stability problem in the lead halide perovskite solar cells.

Abstract: In this work, we use ultra-thin thickness-controllable spatial atomic layer deposited (ALD) aluminium oxide (AlOx) tunnel layers, which contain high negative fixed charges (Qf), capped by highly boron-doped polysilicon layers to form tunnel layer passivated contacts. The high Qf of the tunnel layers is expected to enhance the carrier selectivity of these passivated hole-extracting contacts. The dependence of the ALD AlOx tunnel layer contact passivation performance on its thickness is investigated. Furthermore, two different thermal charge activation conditions, i.e., fast firing using a belt furnace at 700 and 800 °C are compared. The best measured recombination current density J0 and implied open-circuit voltage iVoc of the developed AlOx/polysilicon passivated contacts with a symmetrical AlOx/SiNx stack passivation are 6.6 fA/cm2 and 723 mV, respectively. Based on the measured J0 and on the measured total contact resistivity of the passivated contact, the practical efficiency limit of a rear-side full area passivated contact solar cell with a conventionally diffused front side is calculated to be as high as 23.2%. Additionally, three rear-side metallization schemes: (1) thermally evaporated full-area silver contacts; (2) screen-printed non-firing-through aluminium contacts and (3) screen-printed firing-through silver-aluminium contacts, are compared. Finally, rear-emitter solar cells, using a rear-side hole-selective AlOx tunnel layer passivated contact, are fabricated, which shows an efficiency of up to 20.5%. While the proposed hole-selective passivated contact scheme appears to be promising based on the simulation prediction, the efficiency of the fabricated cells is largely limited by the non-optimized front-side reflectance and recombination losses as well as the use of non-optimized rear-side metallization schemes.

Abstract: Optical films with antireflective and self-cleaning surfaces have much potential for applications in solar cells, architectural glasses, and outdoor displays. Here we demonstrate the fabrication of novel self-cleaning antireflection (AR) thin films by depositing plasma-polymerized fluorocarbon (PPFC) which is fluorinated polymer consisting carbon and fluorine formed under plasma environment on Nb2O5/SiO2/Nb2O5 (NSN) trilayers using mid-range frequency power source in a continuous roll-to-roll sputtering system. The reflectance of PPFC/NSN films with a PPFC thickness of 70 nm was 1.71% at a wavelength of 528 nm, and the PPFC/NSN films showed low reflectance in a wide range in the visible region. The PPFC/NSN AR films exhibited a water-repelling surface with water contact angle of 105° after the application of a top fluorocarbon layer with low surface energy. We tested and confirmed the AR and self-cleaning functions of the PPFC/NSN films through the incorporation to perovskite solar cells (PSC). The short-circuit current density and power conversion efficiency of PPFC/NSN/HC-PET/PSC were 20.6 mA cm−2 and 17%. By attaching a self-cleaning AR films to both side of PSC, photocurrent collection of the device was improved and applicability of protective films to PSC was demonstrated.

Abstract: Animals require different types of muscle for survival, for example for circulation, motility, reproduction and digestion. Much emphasis in the muscle field has been placed on understanding how transcriptional regulation generates diverse types of muscle during development. Recent work indicates that alternative splicing and RNA regulation are as critical to muscle development, and altered function of RNA-binding proteins causes muscle disease. Although hundreds of genes predicted to bind RNA are expressed in muscles, many fewer have been functionally characterized. We present a cross-species view summarizing what is known about RNA-binding protein function in muscle, from worms and flies to zebrafish, mice and humans. In particular, we focus on alternative splicing regulated by the CELF, MBNL and RBFOX families of proteins. We discuss the systemic nature of diseases associated with loss of RNA-binding proteins in muscle, focusing on mis-regulation of CELF and MBNL in myotonic dystrophy. These examples illustrate the conservation of RNA-binding protein function and the marked utility of genetic model systems in understanding mechanisms of RNA regulation.

Abstract: To date, most metal oxide-based photocathodes used in photoelectrochemical cells for water splitting contain copper cations in its composition, which can be reduced to metal Cu under cathodic bias leading to deactivation of the photoelectrode. Here, a Cu-free photocathode composed by a ternary heterostructure of Bi2O3/Al2Bi24O39/Al2Bi48O75 nanowires is reported with a narrow band gap energy (1.83 eV) and suitable conduction band edge potential (−0.98 VRHE) for water reduction to hydrogen. Photoelectrochemical measurements display that the highest photocurrent density of − 4.85 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE under simulated sunlight is achieved by tuning the Bi:Al molar ratio of photocathode to 21:1. The photocurrent onset potential of the Bi2O3/BiAl oxides photoelectrode was estimated to be 0.57 VRHE at pH 7, which is comparable to that of silicon. Controlled potential photoelectrolysis at 0 VRHE showed a stable photocurrent of about − 2 mA cm−2 for 2 h of continuous operation. The H2 measured at this time was 696 μmol cm−2, which corresponds to a Faradaic efficiency of 93%. Finally, this work gives a new generation of Cu-free photocathodes and demonstrates a promising future of BiAl oxides in constructing photoelectrochemical devices for water splitting.

Abstract: Organo-metal halide perovskites are promising new-generation photovoltaic materials owing to their efficient electrical/optical characteristics. Despite having high efficiency, perovskites are toxic due to the presence of lead and instable in air ambient. Therefore, the toxicity and instability call for more efforts in this area. Here, methylammonium-zinc-lead iodide (MAZn0.2Pb0.8I3) is synthesized in air ambient as lead-less and more stable perovskite material for applying as the active layer of solar cells. 1.65 eV optical band gap and 51 nm minority carrier diffusion length (Ldiff) have been obtained with the help of UV–Visible spectroscopy (UV–Vis) and steady-state photocarrier grating (SSPG) technique respectively. Structural, chemical bonding and surface studies are done by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) respectively. The sample has been stored in dark air ambient with average relative humidity of 45% at room temperature (27 °C) for 60 days and the properties of 60 days aged sample is investigated and compared with characteristics of 60 days aged MAPbI3. The results confirm MAZn0.2Pb0.8I3 is more stable than MAPbI3.

MicroRNA-137 inhibits autophagy and chemosensitizes pancreatic cancer cells by targeting ATG5,

Abstract: Purpose
Autophagy play an important role in tumor chemotherapy resistance. It has been reported that miR-137 expression was reducedand involved in the regulation of sensitivity of PC cells to chemotherapy. However, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. In this study, we hypothesized that miR-137 might sensitize PC cells to chemotherapy thought regulating cell autophagy.
Methods
Cell survival was determined with MTT assay. Apoptotic cells were assessed with flow cytometric analysis. Fluorescence intensity of GFP-LC3 and RFP-GFP-LC3 were examined with immunofluorescence analysis to determine the autophagy and autophagic flux level. Western blotting assay was used to determine protein expression levels of LC3II/LC3I, P62, FUNDC1 and ATG5. mRNA expression level of miR-137 was detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to evaluate the directly binding of miR-137 with its targets. Xenograft model was setup to evaluate tumor growth.
Results
The results showed that doxorubicin (Dox) induced autophagy but downregulated the expression level of miR-137 in pancreatic cancer (PC) cells. In turn, overexpression of miR-137 enhanced the effect of Dox on decreasing cell survival, inducing cell apoptosis and inhibiting autophagy rather than influencing autophagic flux in PC cells. Further mechanistic study identified that ATG5 was a direct target of miR-137. Moreover, overexpression of ATG5 dramatically reversed the promotion of apoptosis and inhibition of autophagy mediated by higher expression level of miR-137. We also demonstrated that miR-137 sensitized PANC-1 cells to Dox through inhibiting ATG5 and autophagy in vivo.
Conclusions
Our findings demonstrated for the first time that miR-137 was able to promote sensitivity of PC cells to chemotherapy via inhibition of autophagy mediated by ATG5. Therefore, miR-137 may act as a potential therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer.

Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the contact properties with screen printed fire-through (FT) metal pastes on phosphorus doped (n+) polysilicon (poly-Si) layers. Two different pastes are evaluated for their contact resistivity and contact recombination on n+ doped poly-Si and on n+ doped c-Si. We present excellent contact resistivity (ρc) values ~ 1.5 mΩ-cm2 measured by the transfer length method (TLM) for metal contacts with doped poly-Si layer. The recombination at the metallized contacts is evaluated by analyzing the photoluminescence of the samples together with the Griddler software. In this work, we report ultra-low saturation current density values of 35 fA/cm2 under the metal contacts. We demonstrate that solar cells with a rear passivated contact show an average + 16 mV improvement in cell open circuit voltage as compared to the standard cells when using well-suited rear metal pastes. Efficiency of 21.8% is reported for cells printed with the best performing paste on large-area (244.3 cm2) commercially available n-type Czochralski grown Si wafers.

Abstract: Controlling the semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs) size can alter their optical and electronic properties, which is an important feature for many optoelectronic device applications. In this study, we demonstrated a simple and economical approach to synthesize size-controlled Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) NPs and their application as an absorber layer in solar cells. The size of the CZTS NPs has been controlled from 2.5 to 8 ( ± 0.5) nm by variation of the amine to the precursor mole ratio. The impact of the particle size on the structural, optical, and electrical performance of the devices are studied systematically. XRD and Raman spectroscopy measurements reveal the formation of pure kesterite phase of the CZTS. Moreover, the UV–vis spectroscopy data show that the CZTS NP films have a high optical absorption coefficient (104 cm−1) in the visible region, and its optical band gap is in the range of 1.50–1.62 eV. The power conversion efficiency of a solar cell fabricated using CZTS NPs is enhanced considerably from 3.6% to 4.8% with an increase of nanoparticles size, within an active area of 1.0 ± 0.1 cm2. The maximum external quantum efficiency of 59% is obtained for the solar cell with CZTS thin film comprising 8 nm particles. The observed changes in the device performance parameters might be due to the variation of the thin film microstructure.

Abstract: Although microglial reaction to heat shock is considered to be protective, heat shock is still a potential hazard caused by high temperatures. Recent studies indicate that the inhibition of the 90-kDa heat shock protein (HSP90) increasing the protective heat shock response and suppressing inflammatory signalling pathways in several diseases. Nevertheless, the effects of heat shock on microglial pro-inflammatory responses are not completely identical. Here, we aim to investigate the effect of the HSP90 inhibitor ganetespib on microglial pro-inflammatory responses following heat shock. HSP90 isoforms were determined by transfecting N9 microglial cells (N9 cells) with enzymatically prepared siRNA (esiRNAs). We found that heat shock significantly increased the secretion of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and nitric oxide (NO), and the phosphorylation of extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK), Janus-activated kinase 2 (JAK2), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor alpha (IκB-α) and p65 nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (p65 NF-κB) in N9 cells. These increases, except for phospho-p65, were attenuated efficiently in a dose-dependent manner by ganetespib pretreatment. Furthermore, the suppression of heat shock–evoked cytokines and NO production, and the phosphorylation of ERK, JAK2 and STAT3 in cytosols and/or nuclei were also observed by administering esiRNA HSP90β, but not HSP90α, in heat shock–treated N9 cells. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that the HSP90 inhibitor ganetespib blocks pro-inflammatory responses in heat shock–treated N9 cells via a signalling mechanism involving HSP90β and STAT3.

Abstract: In the present work, sputtered In2S3 buffer layers are deposited on Cu(In,Ga)Se2 absorbers with no or minimal sputter damage. Buffer deposition at slower sputter rates (0.22 Å/s) with H2S as a reactive gas improved the interface quality and uniformity. We obtained crystalline In2S3 films at room temperature with the deposition parameters used in this work. Elemental intermixing effect at the In2S3/CIGSe heterointerface at different annealing temperatures was mapped in 3-dimensions using atom probe tomography (APT). APT results revealed the induced sputter damage during buffer layer deposition, and the effect of diffusion and segregation of elements at the heterointerface. Knowledge of elemental redistribution at the buffer-absorber heterointerface can help better understand the relation of the chemical intermixing with electrical performance of the cell. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) reveal accelerated Cu+ doping of the In2S3 buffer at 225 °C. Cu-depletion on CIGSe surface up to a few nanometers improves the cell performance. However, at higher annealing temperature of 275 °C, CuIn5S8 and Cu(InxGa1-x)5Se8 phases are formed which is detrimental for cell performance. Na diffusing from the CIGSe absorber segregates at the In2S3/CIGSe heterojunction. This actively suppresses the formation of charged antisites defects, lowering the recombination in the space charged region. Cu-depletion at CIGSe surface, Cu and Na diffusion in In2S3 and passivation of interfacial defect states by Na, giving an efficiency of 13.84% (14.83% with CdS-reference) for sputtered In2S3 buffer layers. Consequently, this work elucidates the chemistry of buried hetero-interfaces and their significance to improve the electrical performance of solar cells.

Abstract: GaNxP1-x and GaNxP1-x-yAsy highly mismatched alloys (x ≤ 0.025 and y ≤ 0.4), promising candidates for intermediate band solar cell applications, were studied by optical absorption in a broad temperature range. Incorporation of N to a GaP matrix results in a splitting of the conduction band into two E- and E+ subbands forming an intermediate band gap. The analysis of temperature dependent absorption measurements of GaNP within the band anticrossing (BAC) model framework shows, with the assumption that the N-localized level position is independent of the temperature, the intermediate band position does not vary significantly with the temperature. At the same time the position of the valence band remains virtually unchanged by the incorporated N in GaNP. Subsequent addition of As atoms into GaNP allows for a shift of both valence and conduction bands, what is seen in the BAC analysis of GaNPAs absorption spectra, making it possible to tune the band alignment of GaNPAs-based solar cells. The analysis within the BAC model allows also to show the thermal shift of conduction and valence bands independently.

Abstract: The extrahepatic CYP enzymes, CYP1B1 and CYP2U1, have been predominantly found in both astrocytes and brain microvessels. We investigated the alteration in the production of hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) from arachidonic acid (AA) mainly via CYP1B1 and CYP2U1 by glutamate. CYP1B1 and CYP2U1 mRNA levels were dose-dependently induced by glutamate in human U251 glioma cells and hCMEC/D3 blood-brain barrier cells. The increases in the CYP1B1 and CYP2U1 mRNA levels and the binding of CREB to CYP1B1 and CYP2U1 promoters following glutamate treatment were attenuated by mGlu5 receptor antagonist. The mRNA levels of CYP1B1 and CYP2U1 were increased in the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum from adult rats that received a subcutaneous injection of monosodium l-glutamate at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days of age; meanwhile, the protein levels of CYP1B1 and CYP2U1 in the astrocytes were induced by glutamate. Glutamate treatment significantly increased the production of 5-HETE, 8-HETE, 11-HETE, and 20-HETE in the cortex and cerebellum. These data suggested that the neuron-astrocyte reciprocal signaling can change the CYP-mediated AA metabolism (e.g. EETs and HETEs) in astrocytes via its specific receptor.

Abstract: We present a novel method to analyze the local current-voltage I-V characteristics of both solar cells and cell precursors. The method, which we call “Suns-ILIT”, is based on illuminated lock-in thermography (ILIT) measurements and photoluminescence imaging (PLI) in open-circuit conditions with varying illumination intensities. Compared to conventional techniques for the determination of local solar cell parameters, the advantage of Suns-ILIT lies in the high accuracy while imposing minimal requirements on the sample. In particular, no electrical contact to the sample is needed. We derive the necessary equations from the contributions to the power dissipation and investigate the impact of the Peltier heating and cooling on the final outcome. The method is applied to a standard multicrystalline silicon PERC solar cell for demonstration.

Abstract: Negatively charged ultrathin Al2O3 film deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique has been widely applied in photovoltaic industry because of its excellent passivation effect on both p and n type silicon surfaces. In this study, we have observed an enhancement of the Al2O3 passivation on the surface of p type gallium doped Czochralski silicon under illumination, with a rapid effective lifetime increase by ~90%. However, such passivation effect is not stable in dark circumstance at room temperature, with a slow effective lifetime degradation to the initial value. Furthermore, we have confirmed that the enhancement process under illumination and the degradation process in dark are both thermally activated with activation energies of 0.31 ± 0.02 eV and 0.50 ± 0.07 eV, respectively. The capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements based on the Al/Al2O3/p-Si capacitor demonstrate that the negative charge at the interface between ultrathin Al2O3 film and p-Si substrate increases from 7.4 × 1011 cm−2 to 9.1 × 1012 cm−2 after 1 h's illumination and then returns to the initial value in dark at room temperature after 3 h. This light induced enhancement effect is wavelength dependent and the cut-off wavelength is in the range of 780–800 nm. Based on these results, we have proposed a model to explain the light-soaking enhanced passivation of Al2O3 on crystalline silicon surface based on a charge trapping and de-trapping process.

Abstract: Stem cells or Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have now been identified in different type of tissues by using surface markers. Functional assays such as ALDEFLUOR and side population which are marker independent have been additional approaches. However, whether all these approaches identify the same population of cells remain uncertain. To address this issue we have used hematopoietic stem cells as a model. Peripheral blood stem cells enumerated by CD34 are used routinely in bone marrow transplantation which supports the recovery of bone marrow after ablative chemotherapy or radiation. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) were obtained from normal donor bone marrow (n = 5) and G-CSF stimulated peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) (n = 5) from patients undergoing leukapheresis prior to bone marrow transplantation. The stem cells were identified by combining CD34 expression with functional assays (ALDEFLUOR and side population). The cell cycle profile was further determined by simultaneous labeling of these cells with Hoechst and Pyronin Y. The simultaneous analysis showed that both CD34+ and CD34- cells co-exist with ALDH1A1+ cells but side population did not segregate with CD34+ cells. Though stem cell populations identified by functional assays were different, the cell cycle analysis showed that both ALDH1A1+ and CD34+ cells were in the G1 phase of cell cycle rather than in the quiescent (G0) phase.

Abstract: Development of resistance poses a significant challenge to effective first-line platinum based therapy for epithelial ovarian cancer patients. Cancer Stem Cells are envisaged as a critical underlying factor for therapy resistance. Thus, there is a critical need for developing approaches to diminish the enrichment of cancer stem cells and acquirement of resistance. Administration of metformin, a commonly prescribed drug against Type II diabetes exhibited promising effect in the management of ovarian cancer. However, the effect of long term administration of low dose of metformin as an adjuvant to cisplatin and paclitaxel during acquirement of chemoresistant phenotype has not been investigated so far. Using two isogenic cellular chemoresistant models (A2780 and OAW42) developed in the presence or absence of metformin, we demonstrated the ability of metformin to impede the development of resistance through increased drug sensitivity, increased proliferation, and reduced migratory abilities of the resistant cells. Metformin introduction also decreased the cancer stem cell population, expression of specific biomarkers and pluripotent genes. Further metabolic profiling of these cells using 1H-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy revealed significant modulation in taurine and histidine levels in resistant cells developed in the presence of metformin. Intriguingly, taurine treatment considerably reduced the cancer stem cell population and chemoresistance in resistant cells, indicating a novel role of taurine in differentiation of ovarian cancer stem cells. Altogether this is the first report on the potential role of metformin for targeting the cancer stem cell population via up regulation of taurine, leading to impediment in the acquirement of chemoresistance.

Abstract: The main aim of this study is to prepare and characterize PCM/diatomite composites with impregnation method using unmodified and microwave modified diatomite. The effect of microwave modification of diatomite on composites was investigated. In this study, lauric acid (LA) was used as the phase change material and the prepared PCM/diatomite composites were analysed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and laser diffraction particle size analyser. Thermal stability of composites was demonstrated by thermal resistance test. The results show that the composites prepared with microwave-modified diatomite have higher heat capacities than those prepared with unmodified diatomite. According to the DSC analysis, composites with modified diatomite have melting and freezing temperatures of 40.4 and 39.5 °C, respectively. These composites also have the latent heats of melting and freezing of 55.7 and −49.9 J/g, respectively. According to the analysis and thermal resistance test, it was seen that composites were prepared successfully. After the determination of better thermal energy storage properties of microwave-modified diatomite containing composites than unmodified diatomite containing composites, we recommend that these composites can be used for thermal energy storage applications.

Abstract: In recent years, considerable efforts have been devoted to developing novel electron-selective materials for crystalline Si (c-Si) solar cells with the attempts to simplify the fabrication process and improve efficiency. In this study, ZnO:Al (AZO) is co-sputtered with SiO2 to form AZO:SiO2 films with different SiO2 content. These nanometer-scale films, deposited on top of thin intrinsic hydrogenated amorphous silicon films and capped with low-work-function metal (such as Al and Mg), are demonstrated to function effectively as electron-selective contacts in c-Si solar cells. On the one hand, AZO:SiO2 plays an important role in such electron-selective contact and its thickness is a critical parameter, with a thickness of 2 nm showing the best performance. On the other hand, at the optimal thickness of AZO:SiO2, the open circuit voltage (VOC) of the solar cells is found to be relatively insensitive to material properties of AZO:SiO2. Whereas, regarding the fill factor (FF), AZO without SiO2 content exhibits to be the optimal choice. By using AZO/Al as electron-selective contact, we successfully realize a 19.5%-efficient solar cell with VOC over 700 mV and FF around 75%, which is the best result among c-Si solar cells using ZnO as electron-selective contact. Also, this work implies that efficient carrier-selective film can be made by magnetron sputtering method.

Abstract: All-polymer solar cells (All-PSCs) have attracted a lot of attention in the recent years due to broad absorption spectra, adjustable chemical structures, high morphological stability, better donor-acceptor compatibility and better mechanical durability. This review summarizes the recent development of perylene diimides (PDI)-based electron acceptors used in all-PSCs because these polymers are promising candidates. The photovoltaic performances of non-fullerene polymer acceptors were compared, and the structure-performance relationship was discussed when the same donor material was used.

Abstract: The single-layer (C4H9NH3)2PbBr4 hybrid perovskite has attracted enormous attentions because of the enhanced stability. However, the toxic lead in this single-layer material is a hard problem, which seriously restricts its application. Herein, the Pb atom is substituted by introducing Sn atom, and Br atom also is substituted by BH4 superatom to obtain the lead-free single-layer (C4H9NH3)2Sn(BH4)4 hybrid halide perovskite. The calculated results by density functional theory (DFT) based first-principles calculations show that this single-layer lead-free hybrid halide perovskite has the lattice parameters of a = 8.38 Å and b = 8.25 Å, negative formation energy, and small cleavage energy, revealing that it is formed perovskite and can be stripped out from its bulk material by mechanical peeling or exfoliation method. Moreover, its direct band gap and effective electron (hole) masses can be tuned from 2.92 to 3.60 eV, and from 0.29 (0.26) to 0.72 (0.55) me under the strain of −5% ~ 10%, respectively. Based on these results, we expect that the single-layer lead-free (C4H9NH3)2Sn(BH4)4 hybrid halide perovskite is very useful for fabricating high-performance semiconductor devices.

Abstract: The complexity of T cell activation to maintain homeostasis and provide host defense is highlighted by the intricate step-wise process which is coordinated by multiple cell types. Crucial to T cell activation is the requirement of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as macrophages at each step of the activation and effector stages. Macrophages are central regulators in T cell activation and are involved in each step including initiating the series of events leading to T cell activation. Macrophages identify and present foreign antigens in classes I and II major histocompatibility complexes (MHC) to T cells, which recognize the MHC-antigen complex through their T cell receptor. This initial step is all in vain if additional costimulatory and cytokine signaling does not occur concurrently. Macrophages can mediate and provide the required costimulatory signaling and cytokine secretion required for effective T cell activation. While other cell types, especially other APCs, may be capable of playing a role during different stages of T cell activation, this review will focus on how macrophages can modulate T cell activation and effector function. This is in no way an attempt to minimize the role of other APCs but instead to bring to light to the role macrophages can play during this process. Here, the role macrophages play in cancer to either activate or inhibit T cells based on macrophage phenotype, costimulatory molecules, and cytokine secretion is highlighted as an example of how macrophages can significantly alter T cell activation and effector function in human disease.

Abstract: Until now the Dark Lock-in Thermography (DLIT) based "Local I-V" method for analyzing the inhomogeneity of the two-diode parameters of solar cells was applied mostly to multicrystalline silicon cells. In this contribution it is applied to three high-efficiency monocrystalline cells of the hetero junction type (HJT), one showing very good and two showing slightly degraded cell parameters. It is shown that the degradation of the lower performing cells is mainly due to additional local J02-type current contributions, which are partly stemming from surface injuries and mainly degrade the fill factor. It can be estimated that the local inhomogeneous dark current contributions, which can be imaged and quantified by DLIT, degrade the efficiency of the best cell only by 0.1%, but that of the stronger degraded cells by 0.3% and 0.6% (absolute) respectively. Under reduced illumination intensity the differences between the cells are even higher. The possibilities and limitations of the "Local I-V" evaluation of solar cells for investigating high-efficiency cells are discussed.

Abstract: Large energy storage capacity and high thermal charging/discharging rate are crucial for microencapsulated phase change materials (MEPCM) in thermal energy storage application. The microcapsules with dodecanol core and melamine-formaldehyde (MF) resin shell modified by graphene oxide (GO) and carbon nanotube (CNT) hybrid filler were prepared via in-situ polymerization. The effect of the combination of GO and CNT on morphology and thermal properties of the microcapsules was investigated, and the mechanism for heat transfer enhancement was further studied from both macroscopic and microscopic views. The results indicated that the addition of GO and CNTs largely enhanced the thermal conductivity of the microcapsules, and the GO-CNT hybrid filler was superior to individual GO or CNT. Particularly, with a hybrid filler loading of 0.6 wt%, the thermal conductivity of the microcapsule was improved by 195% with the latent heat slightly decreased. The prepared microcapsules were dispersed into water to form a latent functional thermal fluid, and its photo-thermal conversion performance was studied. The excellent thermal properties and photo-thermal conversion performance made the microcapsule dispersed slurry a potential fluid in direct absorption solar collectors.

Abstract: A novel heterostructure of PbO2 tipped Co3O4 nanowire arrays (NWs) is fabricated by the combination of hydrothermal synthesis and electrochemical deposition. The hydrothermal process is used to fabricate the Co3O4 nanowire arrays (NWs) on the Ti sheet substrates, and subsequently the PbO2 nanoparticles were preferentially adhered on the sharptip of Co3O4 NWs using an electrochemical deposition method. It is found that the as-constructed PbO2/Co3O4 composites exhibit large electroactive areas, low charge transfer resistance, high efficiency regarding the generation of hydroxyl radicals. The photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties of as-constructed PbO2/Co3O4 composites were evaluated by the decolorization of dye (reactive brilliant blue KN-R) in aqueous solution. The PEC measurement indicated that as-constructed PbO2/Co3O4 composites have higher PEC acitivity, better reproducibility and obvious photoelectric synergism, as compared with bare Co3O4 NWs. The promoted PEC ability for the PbO2/Co3O4 composites can be ascribed to the construction of heterointerface between PbO2 and Co3O4. The present work offered attractive perspectives for applications of the PbO2 tipped Co3O4 NWs in the photoanode regarding the treatment of refractory organic pollutant.

Abstract: We report on the effects of using an atomic layer deposited ZnO transparent buffer layer with > 106 Ω cm resistivity on the performance of CdZnS/CdTe solar cells grown by metalorganic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD). The buffer film thickness is adjusted by optical modelling to suppress the reflection losses at the front contact. A clear improvement, up to 1.8% in conversion efficiency, was obtained in comparison to reference devices without the ZnO buffer layer, thanks to the enhancement of the current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF). Device spectral response showed improved collection for most of the visible region. Reflectance measurements confirmed that the ZnO film reduced the optical reflectance around the transparent front contact. This effect permitted light management through the front contact leading to an improvement of the Jsc and hence the photovoltaic conversion efficiency. These results are intriguing since the literature on CdTe solar cells did not previously report improvement to the photocurrent and device response through controlling the highly-resistive transparent buffer layer.

Abstract: Single-cell parallel sequencing allows us to explore how genetic and epigenetic variations correlate of gene expression in the same cell. Beads-based approach and non-beads-based approach are the two present methods to separate DNA and RNA from the same cell. However, systematic difference between the two methods are lacking. In our study, we compared the performances of the two methods using transcriptome and methylome profiles generated simultaneously from single mouse oocytes. Our results showed that the beads-based approach could capture maximum quantity of mRNA but loss of DNA was inevitable, while the non-beads-based approach could obtain more DNA due to the undamaged nucleus obtained but at a cost of partial loss of mRNA. As the sequencing coverage of methylome sequencing in a single cell was relatively low, single-cell whole genome bisulfite sequencing (scWGBS) was preferable to generate the methylome map in single-cell parallel sequencing in comparison to single-cell reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (scRRBS). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to compare the two methods of single-cell parallel sequencing which offers a basic idea for deciding between the two methods and a direction of single-cell parallel sequencing development.

Abstract: Heat storage is a key technology in solar thermal power, helps solar thermal power eliminate the instability in energy supply for the grid, and provides continuous and stable high-quality electrical energy to improve power system efficiency and extend system life. Molten salt is an important material for heat storage and heat transfer in solar thermal power. In recent years, nanofluid technology has been applied to investigate heat storage and transfer materials, such as molten salt, to improve heat capacity. However, the nanofluid technology is hampered by the easy agglomeration of nanoparticles in molten salts, and this phenomenon degrades the performance of the molten salt nanofluids. To reduce or prevent agglomeration, a two-step method with high-temperature melting in preparing molten salt nanofluids is developed recently. Molten salt nanofluids obtained by high-temperature melting show good stability and long time to agglomerate. This paper presented the study on the thermophysical properties of molten salt nanofluids prepared by high-temperature melting method. The molten salt nanofluids possessed low-melting point salt as base liquid and SiO2 with a diameter of 20 nm as nanoparticles. The specific heat of this type of molten salt nanofluid was tested, and the optimum concentration of nanoparticles was determined. Results showed that the specific heat capacities of the molten salt nanofluid samples with different mass fractions of nanoparticles were higher than those of pure molten salt. The average specific heat of molten salt nanofluid with a mass fraction of 0.5% was the highest at 1.950 J/(g K), which was 24.5% more than that of pure molten salt. The thermophysical properties of molten salt nanofluids with a mass fraction of 0.5% and prepared by high-temperature melting were experimentally tested and compared with those of pure molten salt. These properties included melting point, primary crystallization point, thermal conductivity, viscosity, latent heat, and density. The molten salt nanofluids showed good performance for heat storage and transfer.

Abstract: High-throughput next-generation sequencing technologies have led to a rapid increase in the number of sequence variants identified in clinical practice via diagnostic genetic tests. Current bioinformatic analysis pipelines fail to take adequate account of the possible splicing effects of such variants, particularly where variants fall outwith canonical splice site sequences, and consequently the pathogenicity of such variants may often be missed. The regulation of splicing is highly complex and as a result, in silico prediction tools lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity for reliable use. Variants of all kinds can be linked to aberrant splicing in disease and the need for correct identification and diagnosis grows ever more crucial as novel splice-switching antisense oligonucleotide therapies start to enter clinical usage. RT-PCR provides a useful targeted assay of the splicing effects of identified variants, while minigene assays, massive parallel reporter assays and animal models can also be used for more detailed study of a particular splicing system, given enough time and resources. However, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) has the potential to be used as a rapid diagnostic tool in genomic medicine. By utilising data science approaches and machine learning, it may prove possible to finally understand and interpret the ‘splicing code’ and apply this knowledge in human disease diagnostics.

Abstract: Thymidine phosphorylase (TP; EC 2.4.2.4) catalyzes the reversible phosphorolysis of thymidine, deoxyuridine, and their analogues to their respective nucleobases and 2-deoxy-α-d-ribose-1-phosphate (dRib-1-P). TP is a key enzyme in the pyrimidine salvage pathways. Activity of the enzyme is crucial in angiogenesis, cancer chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and tumor imaging, Nevertheless, a complete set of kinetic parameters has never been reported for any human TP. This study describes the kinetic mechanism and regulation of native human hepatic TP. The liver is a main site of pyrimidine metabolism and contains high levels of TP. Initial velocity and product inhibition studies demonstrated that the basic mechanism of this enzyme is a sequential random bi-bi mechanism. Initial velocity studies showed an intersecting pattern, consistent with substrate-enzyme-co-substrate complex formation, and a binding pattern indicating that the binding of the substrate interferes with the binding of the co-substrate and vice versa. Estimated kinetic parameters were KThymidine = 284 ± 55, KPi = 5.8 ± 1.9, KThymine = 244 ± 69, and KdRib-1-P = 90 ± 33 μM. Thymine was a product activator, but becomes a substrate inhibitor at concentrations eight times higher than its Km. dRib-1-P was a non-competitive product inhibitor of the forward reaction. It bounded better to the Enzyme●Pi complex than the free enzyme, but had better affinity to the free enzyme than the Enzyme●Thymidine complex. In the reverse reaction, dRib-1-P enhanced the binding of thymine. The enhancement of the thymine binding along with the fact that dRib-1-P was a non-competitive product inhibitor suggests the presence of another binding site for dRib-1-P on the enzyme.

Abstract: The optical constants of many metals commonly used in solar cells, e.g. as contacts, rear side planar reflectors, or more complex nanopatterned light-trapping structures, can vary depending on deposition method, thickness and other factors, and as such are not documented consistently in the literature. In the case of nanometallic light-trapping structures specifically designed to improve absorption in a solar cell, the choice of optical constants used in simulations significantly affects the predicted enhancement, as well as the structure's optimal dimensions. The trade-off between coupling into guided modes in the photovoltaic material and the number of photons absorbed parasitically in the metal leads to small differences in the optical constants giving significantly different results for the quantum efficiency and photogenerated current. This work documents several optical constant sources for silver, aluminium, gold and titanium, and the effect this has on plasmon quality factors. The effect of choosing different optical constant sources on modelling outcomes is quantified by considering the optimization of a test structure comprising a grid of metal nanodisks on the front surface of a thinned-down GaAs cell. Finally, we define a new spectrally-integrated figure of merit for comparing the expected performance of metals in light-trapping structures based on their optical constants, which we name the spectral absorption enhancement factor (SAEF).

Abstract: Objective/Background
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is one of the commonest leukemias affecting adults. CD39 inhibits T-cell and Natural killer (NK) cell responses by hydrolyzing adenosine triphosphate and adenosine diphosphate, suppressing the immune system. We investigated expression of CD39 on CD4+ T Lymphocytes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients and its relationship with deletion 6q, its association with disease stage and survival.
Methods
Thirty CLL patients and 20 matched controls were included in the study. Bone marrow studies with immunophenotyping, CD39, CD38, and ZAP-70, and detection of del 6q by FISH were performed.
Results
CD39+ CD4+ T helper cells in CLL patients were significantly expressed compared with the controls (p < .001). Levels of CD39+ CD4+ T cells were significantly expressed in high risk CLL patients. Del 6q was detected in 63.3% of patients and it correlated with CD39, CD38, and ZAP-70, and advanced stage disease. There was a significant relation between response to treatment and CD39 expression and del 6q, also there was a significant difference in overall survival (OS) between patients with and without Del 6q.
Conclusion
CD39 expression on CD4+ Tcells and del 6q act as prognostic markers in CLL. Blocking or inhibition of CD39 may be a target for new immune therapy for CLL.

Abstract: Fully printable HTL free perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are the most attractive candidates for large scale production, due to their low cost and high stability. In this kind of PSCs, perovskite precursor solutions are dropped on the three layer mesoscopic scaffolds, so it is important to improve the crystallinity as well as the penetrability into the mesoscopic scaffolds. Thiourea that has two NH2 groups and one S-donor can form hydrogen bond with the perovskite crystals or lewis acid-base adducts to retard the growth of perovskite crystals. In this work, it is found that thiourea facilitate the penetrability of perovskite precursor solution into the mesoscopic scaffolds and the crystallinity of perovskite crystals. It is suggested that such effects are associated with the cross-liker function and with the retarding function of thiourea. With adding thiourea into the perovskite precursor solution, electron transfer from perovskite crystals to FTO and the recombination resistance are enhanced, so that the performance of thiourea based device was improved from 10.20% (the pristine device) to 13.03%. Along with this, the thiourea can reduce iodine molecule to I− ion, so that perovskite films with thiourea have a higher stability than the pristine film.

Abstract: Open-cell porous metal foams and nanofluids are among the solar absorbers for radiation absorption in solar collectors. The optical properties of absorbers have an important role in the thermal performance of direct and volumetric absorption solar collectors. In the present work, porous foam and nanofluid are made from the same materials and their optical properties are measured experimentally. The spectrophotometric experiments are performed on the produced porous metal foams and water based nanofluids from two materials namely SiC and CuO. In water-saturated porous foams, the effect of porosity (90% and 95%), pore diameter (10PPI-30PPI) and type of material (CuO and SiC) are survived while the influence of volume fraction and kind of nanoparticles in water based nanofluids are examined. Obtained results indicate that in SiC and CuO nanofluids, by increasing concentration from 0.01 vol% to 0.1 vol%, extinction coefficient increases by 20% and 176%, respectively. Moreover, the extinction coefficient in porous foams increases by decreasing the porosity and pore diameter. Comparing the results of nanofluid with porous foam of the same material shows that there is no significant difference in extinction coefficient for CuO nanofluid (0.1 vol%) and CuO porous foam (90%, 30PPI) while the extinction coefficient of SiC porous foam (90%, 20PPI) is 4 times higher than its nanofluid (0.1 vol%).

Abstract: Electronic transport mechanisms in Sb2Se3 thin-film solar cells were investigated using temperature-dependent current-voltage (J-V) measurements. Sb2Se3 thin films were deposited via the vapor transporting deposition method using a double-temperature-zone tubular furnace system, and comparative studies were performed for Sb2Se3 films formed on substrates located at three different positions away from the furnace center. The device efficiency varied from 3.83 to 6.24%. First, structural properties obtained by X-ray diffraction, Raman and scanning electron microscopy measurements verified the optimal Sb2Se3 film quality for the cell with the highest efficiency. Then, temperature-dependent saturation current and open-circuit voltage (Voc) measurements revealed that the dominant carrier recombination occurred in the CdS/Sb2Se3 interface region, which possibly influenced the Voc for all cells: the highest Voc for the optimal Sb2Se3 cell was at least partly due to it having the lowest CdS/Sb2Se3 interface recombination rate. Finally, the reverse bias current relationship revealed that non-ohmic shunt current (space-charge-limited current, SCLC) plays an important role in affecting the performance of solar cells, as lower-efficiency cells had higher non-ohmic shunt current.

Abstract: The use of aligned one-dimensional nanostructures as scaffolds in organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite photodetectors (PDs) has attracted significant attention due to their large surface area-to-volume ratio and efficient electron transport capability in the radial direction. Here, we report CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) perovskite photodetectors (PDs) with Ga-doped ZnO nanorods (GZO NRs), prepared by the water bath method, as a scaffold-structure electron transport layer (ETL). Our MoO3 hole transport layer (HTL) based perovskite PDs using GZO NRs as a scaffold showed a larger light/dark current (Iph/Idark) ratio, higher responsivity and detectivity than those of the undoped ZnO NRs/MAPbI3 devices at zero bias. These enhancements are attributed to the incorporation of Ga atoms into the ZnO NRs, which reduce the density defect states of ZnO NRs and improves the performance of MAPbI3 perovskite PDs. In addition, by taking advantage of the GZO NRs scaffold structure, a HTL-free perovskite PD was prepared by using graphite electrodes. The graphite-connected device shows self-powered PD performances with an Iph/Idark ratio of ~2.5 × 103, responsivity of above 0.3 A/W and detectivity of 1.3 × 1012 Jones, all of which are comparable with those of MoO3 HTL based perovskite PDs.

Abstract: In the present study, Folic Acid (FA) ligand was used to functionalize Temozolomide-loaded Poly (ethylene Glycol)–Poly (Butylene Adipate)–Poly (ethylene Glycol)-coated magnetite nanoparticles (TMZ-SPION-PEG-PBA-PEG) for targeted chemotherapy of glioma cells. Four types of nanoparticles were synthesized with the hydrodynamic diameters of 24–49 nm. Using MTT, Prussian blue, and ICP-OES assays, the cytotoxicity effect and cellular uptake of nanoparticles were evaluated in C6 cancer cells and OLN-93 normal cells. Moreover, in vitro anti-tumor efficacy of nanoparticles was evaluated through colony formation, quantitative real-time PCR, and flow cytometry analysis. As compared to OLN-93 cells TMZ-SPION-PEG-PBA-PEG-FA nanoparticles showed an increase in the cytotoxicity of the loaded TMZ in C6 cells within 24 and 48 h treatment (P < 0.0001), while such effect was not observed in the case of non-targeting nanoparticles. The colony formation, flow cytometry, and real-time PCR assays showed that TMZ-SPION-PEG-PBA-PEG-FA led to the enhancement of inhibitory effects to C6 cells compared to TMZ alone (P < 0.05). These results suggested that TMZ-SPION-PEG-PBA-PEG-FA could effectively slow down cell proliferation, due to the targeting effect and the high accumulation of TMZ in C6 cells via an FA-receptor mediated endocytosis. In conclusion, TMZ-loaded magnetite FA-conjugated PEG-PBA-PEG NPs could be used as a targeted drug delivery system for targeted therapy of brain glioma.

Abstract: The composition of the active layer of a benchmark functional glass/ITO/[P3HT:PCBM][1.1:1]/Al organic solar cell has been studied by neutron reflectometry (NR) and hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES). Thermal annealing was performed in several steps and NR and HAXPES were recorded for every temperature. By fitting the NR results to a model composed of several layers, the scattering length density (SLD) distribution through the sample was obtained, and from this SLD profile, the evolution of the composition of the active layer as a function of temperature was established. For the outer layers, HAXPES results confirm the composition evolution. The results show that PCBM tends to segregate reducing the initial concentration of PCBM in the central part of the active layer and increasing its concentration towards both interfaces. The effect of the Al electrode as studied by HAXPES on the nearest zone of the active layer (up to 50 nm) is to stabilize the P3HT depletion in this area, an effect which is not affected by thermal annealing.

Abstract: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a novel class of gene regulators playing multifaceted roles in physiological processes as well as pathological conditions such as cancer. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a small subset of tumor cells that constitute the origin and development of various malignant tumors. CSCs have been identified in a wide spectrum of human tumors and could act as a critical link underlying the processes of tumor metastasis and recurrence. Mounting evidence indicates that lncRNAs are aberrantly expressed in diverse CSCs and regulate CSC properties at different molecular levels. Here, we very briefly summarize the recent findings on the potential roles of lncRNAs in regulating various functions of CSCs, and elaborate on how can lncRNAs impact CSC properties via interacting with other macromolecules at the epigenetic, transcriptional, and post-transcriptional levels. This mini-review also highlights the understanding of the modular regulatory principles of lncRNA interactions in CSCs.

Abstract: In the past few years, carrier-induced degradation (CID) in p-type multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) has been receiving significant attention. Recently, it has been reported that this material is also susceptible to degradation under dark anneal at moderate temperatures. In the first part of this study, we investigate the impact of the dark anneal temperature on mc-Si wafers. We identify both degradation and regeneration of the effective lifetime, where higher temperatures lead to faster rates and lower degradation extent. A fitting model is developed to describe the kinetics of these processes, where the degradation and regeneration process are assumed to happen simultaneously. An Arrhenius analysis of the degradation and regeneration rates, extracted from the proposed model, determines activation energies of 1.08 ± 0.05 eV for the degradation process and 1.11 ± 0.04 eV for the regeneration one. An improvement of the minority carrier effective lifetime of up to 40% is observed after a long dark anneal process. This improvement is associated with enhancement of both the bulk and surface passivation. Temperature- and injection-dependent lifetime spectroscopy measurements indicate that the recombination parameters of the associated defect causing the degradation in the dark are similar to those determined for the CID-related defect; therefore, it seems both defects have a similar nature. In the second part of the study, the effect of the illumination intensity at room temperature on the degradation/regeneration is studied. Surprisingly, an improvement in the effective lifetime is found, followed by a very slow degradation. The proposed model is found to be suitable to fit these measurements. The extracted rates suggest that the observed behavior is due to a regeneration that is much faster than the degradation. The reported findings provide new insights into CID in p-type mc-Si that will help improve understanding and assist in developing mitigation solutions.

Abstract: In this work, six soluble polymers based on 4,9-dihydro-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b']dithiophene (IDT) and various electron-deficient moieties were synthesized via Stille coupling reaction. Aromatic cycles such as benzene (Ph), naphthalene (Na), and anthracene (An) incorporated into the polymer chain induce steric hindrance and generate strongly hypsochromic effect to achieve short-wavelength absorption band. As a result, one of the synthesized polymer (P(IDT-Na)) presents a single absorption peak at 433 nm and yellow color in the neutral state, which can turn into highly transmissive blue upon oxidation. On the other hand, due to the strong electron-deficient characteristics of 2,1,3-benzothidiazole (Tz), P(IDT-Tz) presents low band gap and very strong absorption located at long-wavelength visible band to give the neutral polymer a blue color. All these synthesized polymers also possess good properties. Then, these yellow and blue-to-transmissive ECPs are chosen for generating green-to-transmissive electrochromics via solution co-processing. The derived co-processed mixtures present desirably fine-tuning green color with the blending ratios, and excellent switching properties. Additionally, electrochromic devices based on these mixtures on ITO glass and flexible PET also give and confirm the fine-tuning of green color behavior and high-performance properties, implying that the blending strategy on soluble ECPs can be an efficient way for subtle green color control.

Abstract: The thermal emissivity of solar cell cover glasses with differences in glass composition or manufacture and surface texture are evaluated using specular and specular+diffuse infrared reflectance at different angles of incidences. Non-textured and textured glasses all exhibit similar emissivity at all angles of incidence regardless of composition and patterning. Both diffuse and specular reflectance must be included for textured glass at any angle of incidence and may be needed for planar glass at a high angle of incidences to properly determine emissivity.

Abstract: Multi-functional semiconducting nanostructures are gaining popularity for application in photoelectronics, energy storage devices and also in industrial and environmental remediation functions. In this regard, CuxIn2-xS3 nanostructures were investigated in detail for their photoelectrical and photocatalytic performance. Their physico-chemical characteristics were at first studied using X-ray diffraction, Raman, UV–vis absorbance, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and high resolution electron microscopic tools. CuxIn2-xS3 based flip chip Schottky diodes were demonstrated to attest their improved conductivity and enhanced photoelectrical performance. The photo switching capabilities of a type II p-n CdTe/CuxIn2-xS3 heterojunction was also investigated. In both the device configurations, the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics revealed the forward current and rectification ratio to improve under lower threshold voltages. The time-dependent photoresponse characteristics affirmed the stability of diodes, augmenting the improved/effective separation of photo generated electron hole pairs under illumination. Additionally, the photocatalytic performances of CuxIn2-xS3 nanostructures were inferred under visible light conditions through effective remediation of methylene blue (MB) dye molecules. The obtained results infer the Cu interaction in tetragonal lattice of CuxIn2-xS3 to promote the surface induced charge transfer mechanism in respective nanostructures, thereby enhancing their photoelectronic and photocatalytic functionalities.

Abstract: The benefit of sophisticated rear surface passivation quality in highly efficient solar cell structures made of boron-doped oxygen-rich Cz-Si wafers (e.g. PERC) can be reduced if bulk lifetime becomes a limiting factor due to boron-oxygen related light-induced degradation (BO-LID). A permanent lifetime recovery can be achieved through a regeneration treatment under illumination at elevated temperature. To evaluate the applicability of BO mitigation by means of regeneration at industrial relevant conditions, industrially-made PERC solar cell precursors were processed in a coupled fast firing and regeneration tool where the latter comprises an illuminated zone through which the solar cells transit on a belt. The treatment was evaluated by a subsequent intentional degradation. The results show that untreated solar cells suffer from BO-LID while properly treated samples are almost free of BO-LID demonstrating the applicability of a fast (around 15–30 s) and coupled regeneration process in mass production. Furthermore, it is found that fluctuations in precursor quality and/or variations in firing conditions are of minor significance for the BO-LID mitigation process. The firing conditions process window (peak firing temperature and belt velocity) overlaps with the treatment conditions window having the benefit of independent optimization.

Abstract: In this work, copper indium gallium selenide (Cu(In,Ga)Se2; CIGS) absorbers were grown on polyimide (PI)/molybdenum substrates by a three-stage co-evaporation process at various temperatures, film formation was systemically studied using various advanced characterization methods such as transmission electron microscopy, micro-Raman spectroscopy, Kelvin probe force microscopy, and atom probe tomography. The CIGS films on PI were found to exhibit considerable physical and electrical variations with respect to the process temperature of three-stage co-evaporation. In particular, when the process temperature reached 400 °C, the CIGS absorber on PI began to exhibit controlled microstructure and intergrain properties. By adjusting the microstructure and intergrain properties of the absorber films by means of the process temperature of three-stage co-evaporation, flexible CIGS solar cells on PI with an efficiency of 16.7% (with anti-refection coating) were achieved.

Abstract: Poly(4-vinyltriphenylamine) (PVTPA) was synthesized, and cross-linked poly(4-vinyltriphenylamine) (PVTPA-CLn) films with a thickness of 260 nm (CL1), 510 nm (CL2), and 680 nm (CL3) were prepared by electropolymerization. Using the PVTPA-CL2 and PVTPA-CL3 films as active materials, the electrochromic devices (ECDs) were fabricated. The structures of the devices were indium tin oxide (ITO) glass/gel electrolyte/PVTPA-CL2/ITO glass (ECD 1) and ITO glass/gel electrolyte/PVTPA-CL3/ITO glass (ECD 2). The electrochromic properties of the PVTPA, PVTPA-CLn films, and ECDs were investigated. Among them, the PVTPA-CL2 and PVTPA-CL3 films exhibited reversible color changes from colorless to gray-green and from colorless to black upon electrochemical doping and dedoping, respectively. The optical contrast of the PVTPA-CL2 and PVTPA-CL3 films were 81.0% and 84.3% at 750 nm, respectively. The ECD 1 could reversibly change between colorless and gray-green under different voltages, and it exhibited 78.3% optical contrast at 750 nm. Notably, ECD 2 could reversibly change between colorless and black under different voltages, and it exhibited 85.0% optical contrast at 750 nm. ECD 1 had shorter switching time than ECD 2, its coloring and bleaching times were 9.5 and 7.3 s, respectively. Both ECD 1 and ECD 2 exhibited reasonable electrochemical cyclic stability.

Abstract: Thermochromic asphalt binder is an innovative and promising road material in adjusting surface temperature of pavement. Instead, durability of this material under natural environment remains to be unknown. In this paper, weathering aging effects on rheological and chemical evolutions of thermochromic asphalt binder were evaluated by complex modulus (G*) master curve, crossover frequency (ωc), non-recoverable creep compliance (Jnr), zero shear viscosity (ZSV), DSR Function value (DSRFn) and carbonyl and sulfoxide indexes. The results indicated that unlike blank sample, rheological indexes of thermochromic asphalt binder were not always increasing or decreasing with growth of weathering aging time, but there was a turning point during the weathering aging. Furthermore, the effects of weathering aging on rheological properties of thermochromic asphalt binder were much less than blank sample. Growth rates and amplitudes of carbonyl and sulfoxide indexes of thermochromic asphalt binder were also much lower than those of blank sample, which illustrates superior weathering aging resistance of thermochromic asphalt binder. In addition, weathering aging behaviors of thermochromic asphalt binder were dependent on combined effects of asphalt matrix and thermochromic powder.

Abstract: Renewable energy has been rapidly developing because of the increasing severity of pollution and energy crises. In particular, solar thermal power generation technology has been attracting considerable attention globally due to its large scale, low unit cost, and environment-friendliness. Thus, it has been quickly progressing. The intermittence and instability of solar energy can be solved by combination of solar thermal power with heat storage technology. Mixed molten salts stand out as heat transfer and storage materials due to their wide temperature range, low vapor pressure, high heat capacity, low viscosity, and economical environmental protection. In the present study, a new kind of quaternary nitrate molten salt was presented. The salt was Hitec salt with Ca(NO3)2 additive and has a low melting point, high decomposition point, and low cost. The thermophysical properties of the proposed salt, such as melting point, decomposition point, crystallization point, specific heat, density, thermal conductivity, and thermal stability, were measured. Results showed that the melting, crystallization, and decomposition points of the Hitec salt with Ca(NO3)2 additive were 83.1 °C, 163.1 °C, and 628.5 °C, respectively. The proper working temperature range of the new salt was 200–565 °C, which was wider than those of Hitec salt (200–450 °C) and solar salt (290–565 °C). The average specific heat and thermal conductivity of the Hitec salt with Ca(NO3)2 additive were approximately 1.52 J/(g K) and 0.655 W/(m K), respectively, which showed better heat storage and heat transfer performance than did Hitec salt (1.40 J/(g K) specific heat, 0.350 W/(m K) thermal conductivity) and solar salt (1.50 J/(g K) specific heat, 0.520 W/(m K) thermal conductivity). An experimental study was conducted on the stability of mixed molten salts at 565 °C for 1200 h and 120 times for quenching/heating at 200–500 °C, and the Hitec salt with Ca(NO3)2 additive exhibited good thermal stability.

Abstract: Laser ablation of rear dielectrics of PERC (Passivated Emitter and Rear Cell) type silicon solar cells is by far the most cost-effective method to open a variety of patterns for local contact formation. In this paper, rear dielectric ablation of p-type PERC solar cells with an implanted phosphorus emitter is investigated using two laser sources with green wavelength and with pulse durations in the nanosecond (ns) and femtosecond (fs) range. The ns laser source emits 38 ns pulses and the ablation behaviour is linear for the entire range of available pulse fluences. The fs laser source emits 480 fs pulses and has two operating regimes, gentle and strong, based on the incoming pulse fluence. To evaluate the impact of laser induced damages on PERC solar cells, four different laser conditions are considered: fs gentle regime, fs strong regime, ns low fluence and ns high fluence. The solar cells’ one-sun I–V parameters show that the cells processed in the fs strong regime have a severe reduction in the open-circuit voltage by almost 40 mV, fill factor loss by ~7% and efficiency loss by 3–4%. Fill factor loss analysis shows that a loss of almost 7% absolute comes entirely from J02 recombination, revealing a possibility of severe damage to the front side emitter. The solar cells processed with the other three laser conditions have comparable I–V characteristics. SEM analysis of the front surface of samples with laser treated rear surface shows that the fs strong regime produces severe damage to the front-surface texture resulting in lower Jsc, whereas this effect is not observed for the other laser conditions.

Abstract: Erythropoietin (EPO) is a secreted hormone that stimulates the production of red blood cells, and the level of EPO is increased under hypoxia. The expression of EPO is regulated not only by the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) but also partly through epigenetic modifications, including histone acetylation and methylation. In this study, we report that histone H3K9 demethylase JMJD1 A is regulated by HIF-2α in HepG2 cells under hypoxia. Knockdown or over-expression of JMJD1 A can decrease or increase EPO expression, respectively. JMJD1 A can interact with HIF-2α to form a co-activator complex, which binds to the hypoxia response elements of EPO and increases EPO expression by catalyzing demethylation of H3K9me2, a transcription suppression marker. The results demonstrate that JMJD1 A is a co-activator of EPO expression.

Abstract: Cell death plays two major complementary roles in T cell biology: mediating the removal of cells that are targeted by T cells and the removal of T cells themselves. T cells serve as major actors in the adaptive immune response and function by selectively killing cells which are infected or dysfunctional. This feature is highly involved during homeostatic maintenance, and is relied upon and modulated in the context of cancer immunotherapy. The vital recognition and elimination of both autoreactive T cells and cells which are unable to recognize threats is a highly selective and regulated process. Moreover, detection of potential threats will result in the activation and expansion of T cells, which on resolution of the immune response will need to be eliminated. The culling of these T cells can be executed via a multitude of cell death pathways which are used in context-specific manners. Failure of these processes may result in an accumulation of misdirected or dysfunctional T cells, leading to complications such as autoimmunity or cancer. This review will focus on the role of cell death regulation in the maintenance of T cell homeostasis, as well as T cell-mediated elimination of infected or dysfunctional cells, and will summarize and discuss the current knowledge of the cellular mechanisms which are implicated in these processes.

Abstract: We developed a framework to predict and model the photodegradation of adhesion and cohesion of a silicone encapsulant for concentrator photovoltaic applications. Silicone encapsulant specimens were artificially weathered under narrow band UV filters to determine the effects of individual wavelengths within the UV spectrum on the photodegradation of the cohesion of encapsulant material and its adhesion with adjacent interfaces. The threshold wavelength, signifying the upper bound of the damaging action spectrum for the silicone, was identified from the results. In addition, specimens were artificially weathered with different relative humidities to understand the effects of moisture on the rate of photodegradation. The adhesion energy was measured using a fracture mechanics approach. The complementary delaminated surfaces were characterized to determine the failure pathway and chemistry changes resulting from photodegradation. A previously developed model was modified to account for the effects of damaging wavelengths in the terrestrial solar spectrum and reciprocity law failure due to varying UV intensity during weathering. With these modifications, the model showed good agreement with the behavior of the silicone encapsulant exposed in an outdoor solar concentrator simulating concentrator photovoltaics operating conditions. Similar studies can be adopted to develop models that can have high predictive accuracies based on accelerated aging studies.

Abstract: Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is one of the major complications of pregnancy, which can lead to serious short-term and long-term diseases. High-mobility group box 3 (HMGB3) has been found to contribute to the development of many cancers. However, the role of HMGB3 in the pathogenesis of FGR is blank. Here, we measured the expression level of HMGB3 in the placenta tissues of six normal pregnancies and five FGR patients by western blotting and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). CCK8 assay, transwell assay and flow cytometry were used to detect the functional effects of overexpression and silencing of HMGB3 on the HTR8/SVneo trophoblast cell line. The results showed that the protein levels of HMGB3 were significantly decreased in FGR placentas compared to normal controls, while mRNA levels of HMGB3 were not significantly altered. Furthermore, when overexpressed of protein HMGB3 of the trophoblast cells, the proliferation and migration abilities were significantly promoted, and the apoptosis abilities of these cells were statistically inhibited. Cell functional experiments showed the opposite results when the expression of HMGB3 was silent. And the expression of cell function-related genes PCNA, Ki67, Tp53, Bax, MMP-2 and E-cadherin was observed to show corresponding changes by qRT-PCR. The results of mass spectrometry showed that HMGB3 may directly or indirectly interact with 71 proteins. In summary, our results indicated that HMGB3 might be of very great significance to the pathogenesis of FGR and might play the role by leading the dysfunction of placental villous trophoblast cells and through the interaction with some other proteins.

Abstract: Ni(OH)2/TiO2 nanorod composite porous film with a novel structure and remarkable electrochromic (EC) behavior was prepared on a fluorine doped tin oxide (F:SnO2; FTO) coated glass substrate by hydrothermal and solvothermal techniques. A pure Ni(OH)2 porous film was also prepared on another FTO substrate by the solvothermal technique for comparison. The growth process of Ni(OH)2 on the surface of TiO2 nanorod layer was investigated carefully. The component, morphology and microstructure of the films, as well as their EC performances including transmittance, cyclic voltammetry (CV), cycle life and response time were characterized. Compared with those of the pure Ni(OH)2 film, the EC performances of Ni(OH)2/TiO2 composite film have exhibited obvious enhancement owing to the good interface bonding, Ni(OH)2 porous structure, TiO2 nanorod layer and interpenetrating structure. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the transmittance contrast in near infrared light area was distinctly improved, and even exceeded 95% after the 100th cycle, promising the Ni(OH)2/TiO2 nanorod composite porous film a potential EC application in near infrared light area in the future.

Abstract: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress caused by β-amyloid protein (Aβ) may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD). Our previous data have indicated that tanshinone IIA (tan IIA) protected primary neurons from Aβ induced neurotoxicity. To further explore the neuroprotection of tan IIA, here we study the effects of tan IIA on the ER stress response in oligomeric Aβ1-42 (oAβ1-42)-induced SH-SY5Y cell injury. Our data showed that tan IIA pretreatment could increase cell viability and inhibit apoptosis caused by oAβ1-42. Furthermore, tan IIA markedly suppressed ER dilation and prevented oAβ1-42-induced abnormal expression of glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), as well as inhibited the activation of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways. Moreover, tan IIA ameliorated oAβ1-42-induced Bcl-2/Bax ratio reduction, prevented cytochrome c translocation into cytosol from mitochondria, reduced oAβ1-42-induced cleavage of caspase-9 and caspase-3, suppressed caspase-3/7 activity, and increased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and ATP content. Meanwhile, oAβ1-42-induced cell apoptosis and activation of ER stress can also be attenuated by the inhibitor of ER stress 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA). Taken together, these data indicated that tan IIA protects SH-SY5Y cells against oAβ1-42-induced apoptosis through attenuating ER stress, modulating CHOP and JNK pathways, decreasing the expression of cytochrome c, cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved caspase-3, as well as increasing the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax, MMP and ATP content. Our results strongly suggested that tan IIA may be effective in treating AD associated with ER stress.

Abstract: As a binary semiconductor, Sb2Se3 possesses appropriate band gap, high absorption coefficient and remarkable air and moisture stability, promising for light absorption material in a practical solar cell. This study demonstrates that interfacial enginnering of TiO2/Sb2Se3 by CdS is able to considerably enhance the photovoltaic performance in planar heterojunction solar cells. Mechanistic investigations show that the optimized energy alignment upon the introduction interfacial layer is responsible for the improved device performance. With this approach, Sb2Se3 based solar cell delivers a power conversion efficiency of 3.9% with a high current density of 27.2 mA cm−2, which is the highest efficiency in solution processed Sb2Se3 solar cells. This research provides basic understanding regarding the interfacial engineering of Sb2Se3 solar cell and practical strategy for improving the device efficiency.

Abstract: During their outdoor service, photovoltaic (PV) modules are exposed to different set of external stresses that can affect their efficiency and lifetime such as UV irradiation, temperature and humidity cycles, rain, snow and wind loads, hail, sand and/or salt. Moreover, internal stresses such as choice of materials and design (additives, morphology and compatibility of materials) can drive degradation of PV modules as well. The failure data collection started already in 1980s and is still ongoing. Most of these studies are focused mainly on power data or categorizing PV failure modes concerning solely climate, EVA or cell-technology. However, relationship between climate, degradation of polymeric materials and degradation of PV modules has not been reported so far. Hence, within this study a lot of effort was put into finding the appropriate data and publications with as many as possible data on PV, climate and materials degradation. As a result, a great overview of climate and polymeric materials induced PV failure modes is given. Based on the reported data, the topic of new, climate-based design of PV modules is discussed. This paper provides numerous number of selected references that can be beneficial in further studies on degradation of PV modules, design of PV modules and choice of materials.

Abstract: In this study, the potential of SiC-TiC nano-composites as solar absorbers has been studied. For solar thermal applications, materials with high solar absorptance and low emittance are ideally sought for (spectral selectivity). A semi-molecular sol-gel synthesis route leading to nanometric homogenous composites was described. The resulting SiC-TiC nanocomposite powder was sintered at different temperatures to produce samples with various relative densities (from 57% to 96%). The samples morphology and composition were characterized by several techniques including Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy-Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), carbon and oxygen elemental analyses. The link between the surface roughness and the relative density was precised and the effects on the optical properties (0.25–25 µm wavelength range) were studied. Comparisons were made with pure SiC and pure TiC samples with various relative densities. Overall, the sample emittance was found to strongly decrease with the increase in the relative density, leading to a great increase in the spectral selectivity, despite a little decrease in the solar absorptance. The TiC-SiC composite has an intermediate reflectance compared to the pure SiC and the pure TiC samples. With an absorptance of 0.76, an emittance of 0.44 and a selectivity of 1.74, the denser SiC-TiC could be a good candidate for bulk solar applications.

Abstract: In this paper, bifacial n-type silicon wafer solar cells with a front boron-diffused emitter and a rear phosphorus-diffused back surface field are investigated. The cell structure is abbreviated as nFAB (n-type Front and Back Contact). Three different process flows are evaluated for the fabrication of nFAB cells: (1) process flow with a silicon nitride diffusion mask deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD), (2) process flow with a silicon oxynitride diffusion mask also deposited by PECVD, and (3) process flow using single-sided atmospheric pressure chemical vapour deposition (APCVD), without diffusion masks. An average batch efficiency of 21.3% was measured (front side illumination only) for all three nFAB process flows. However, the reverse bias I-V characteristics are observed to be remarkably different and dependent on the process flow, especially with regards to the masking processes. For process flow 1 that uses a silicon nitride PECVD mask, the reverse bias I-V characteristics are poor with a severe breakdown occurring at − 5 V and a reverse current of 18 A at −10 V. Process flow 2 with a silicon oxynitride PECVD mask leads to significantly improved reverse characteristics with a reverse current of 1 A at −10 V. For the APCVD process flow without diffusion masks, excellent reverse bias characteristics are observed with a reverse current of only 3 mA at −10 V. Reverse-biased electroluminescence imaging is used to determine the breakdown regions of the cells for the different process flows and to analyse the impact of the diffusion masking step on the cells’ breakdown characteristics.

Abstract: This paper investigates an evacuated heat pipe solar collector (HPSC) experimentally. The main aim was to study the efficiency of the HPSC. An experimental apparatus for testing solar heat pipe collectors was designed and built at Vali-e-Asr University. By using the two-step method, copper oxide and deionized water was prepared. The structural and optical properties of the nanostructure were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and UV–visible analysis. Water or MgO-water nanofluid with varying concentrations was used as working fluids. The effect of the working fluid flow rates was also investigated and discussed. The effect of concentration of nanofluid was studied experimentally on the performance of solar heat pipe collector. The thermal performance of HPDC is determined through the experimental results by using this apparatus. The results reveal that the efficiency of the collector increases as the coolant flow rate increases. The efficiency of the heat pipe solar collector with MgO nanofluid is higher than ones with pure water. Also, performance enhances with the increase in the concentration of the nanofluid.

Abstract: ISG15 (interferon-stimulated gene 15) exists as free ISG15 or conjugated ISG15 modifying its target proteins via ISGylation. Few proteins have been identified and studied as ISGylation targets, and their relevance is not completely clear. Here, we isolated ISG15 from MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells using immunoprecipitation and identified non-muscle myosin IIA (NMIIA) using mass spectrometry as endogenously associated with ISG15. The identification of NMIIA as an ISG15-interacting protein was important, because levels of NMIIA mRNA were not deregulated in all breast cancers, and because our in silico analysis indicated that NMIIA was the target of different posttranslational modifications and had an interactome associated with cytoskeletal remodeling. Furthermore, our experimental assays of co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence confirmed that ISG15 was covalently associated with NMIIA in the cytoplasm of breast cancer cells and that interferon γ (IFN-γ) increased this association without alterations in the NMIIA levels. Thus, NMIIA ISGylation is regulated by IFN-γ, and this modification may modulate its interactions with proteins that remodel the cytoskeleton, participating in the growth and progression of mammary tumors.

Abstract: The low heat dissipation efficiency will cause damage to the electronic devices. Here, we proposed a radiative cooling foil with simple double-layer structure composed of a transparent fluorinated polyimide embedding SiO2 microspheres and a silver layer(FPI@SiO2/Ag). The foil was prepared by a simple in-situ polymerization, and the thermal analysis shows that the foil has an outstanding thermal stability with the glass transition temperature of 194∘C. We experimentally and theoretically performed the investigation of spectra, thermal radiative property, and cooling performance at different condition. We demonstrated that the 3 wt% FPI@SiO2/Ag foil can achieve radiative cooling to 4.6 ± 0.2∘C under direct sunlight. The foil shows a strong broadband thermal radiation with emissivity approaching 0.94 ± 0.03 at 8–13 μm wavelengths and 0.92 ± 0.03 at 2.5–25 μm wavelengths, yet ultralow solar absorptivity with 0.07 ± 0.02. The radiative cooling foil that can withstand high temperature is very attractive to apply regardless of the terrestrial structure and the space lander.

Abstract: Background
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) is the only treatment option with curative potential in patients with myelofibrosis (MF). The aim of our study was to evaluate the safety of splenectomy before alloHSCT in MF patients who failed to achieve significant spleen response after ruxolitinib therapy.
Methods
Splenectomy was performed in 12 patients for alloHSCT with myelofibrosis—primary (6 patients), post-polycythemia vera (3 patients). or postessential thrombocythemia (3 patients) between 2016 and 2018. The patients were prospectively included in the study if persistence of splenomegaly ≥ 25 cm was documented after at least 3 months of ruxolitinib therapy. In eight patients subsequent alloHSCT was performed.
Results
Median length of hospital stay was 11 (8–30) days, median follow-up after splenectomy was 20.0 (0.6–31.1) months. No deaths were documented, perioperative morbidity was 50%. Three patients experienced portal vein thrombosis and one experienced splenic vein thrombosis. One patient developed pancreonecrosis and subdiaphragmatic abscess. Mean leukocyte count was significantly higher 1 month after splenectomy than before, 10.7 ± 1.7 versus 6.9 ± 2.3 × 109/L (p = 0.03). Platelets rate significantly elevated starting Day + 7 after splenectomy (p = 0.01). Median time between splenectomy and alloHSCT was 2.6 (0.17–4.5) months. All patients achieved engraftment. In early posttransplant period no cases of severe sepsis, intraabdominal infections were documented. One patient died after alloHSCT due to thrombotic microangiopathy. Seven patients are alive in disease complete remission. No relapses after alloHSCT were observed. Two-year overall survival in the whole group is 90% (95%CI 98–43%).
Conclusion
Splenectomy before alloHSCT might be a promising option in patients who failed to achieve significant spleen response after ruxolitinib therapy.

Abstract: Based on the frequent over-expression of c-Myc in hematologic malignancies and its crucial role in the regulation of diverse oncogenic pathways involved in leukomogenesis, intense interest has recently focused on this factor as an appealing therapeutically target in leukemia. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the anti-leukemic property of small molecule inhibitor of c-Myc 10058-F4 in two distinct acute leukemia cell lines consist of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)-derived NB4 cells (with wild-type PTEN) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)-derived Nalm-6 cells (with down-regulated PTEN). 10058-F4 effectively reduced survival of leukemic cells; however, we found a different cell sensitivity pattern in the tested cell lines. To the best of our knowledge, no study has addressed the underlying mechanisms responsible for leukemic cell resistance to 10058-F4, and we propose for the first time that the effectiveness of c-Myc inhibition might be attenuated through over-activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) in less sensitive Nalm-6 cells. Notably, we failed to find an obvious correlation between PTEN status and cell sensitivity to the inhibitor in a panel of hematologic malignant cells. Beyond 10058-F4 cytotoxicity as a single agent, synergistic experiments also delineated that pharmaceutical targeting of c-Myc could potentiate the anti-cancer effect of both vincristine and Arsenic trioxide in ALL and APL cells, respectively. In conclusion, this study sheds light on the potent anti-leukemic characteristics of 10058-F4 and provide an interesting evidence to the application of this agent in combination with PI3K inhibitors especially in acute leukemia with over-activated PI3K, irrespective of PTEN status.

Abstract: Polypyrrole (PPy) film doped with p-toluenesulfonate has been grown on indium doped tin oxide (ITO) coated glass by electrochemical polymerization. The PPy film, aluminum (Al) sheet and KCl solution are assembled into a bi-functional electrochemical device exhibiting self-powered electrochromic device and self-rechargeable battery characteristics. As an electrochromic device, the maximum optical modulation of the PPy/Al device is 59.0% at the wavelength of 698.5 nm. The original black device will become yellow after connecting its two electrodes with a response time of 6.5 s. As a battery, the capacity of the PPy/Al device is 75.25 mAh g−1 when it was initially discharged at a constant current density of 1.0 A g−1. The open circuit voltage of the PPy/Al device is 0.94 V. The charging-discharging processes of the PPy/Al device accompany a clear color change. So the capacity of the PPy/Al device can be known from the color of the device. The PPy/Al device can recover its color and capacity after disconnecting its two electrodes, which is attributed to the spontaneous transformation of PPy film from its neutral state (yellow) to p-type doped state (black) by the oxidation of oxygen.

Abstract: Recently, there has been attractive attention over the defect-engineering where the optimum extent of oxygen deficiency has been considered as an effective route towards enhancing the solar-driven water oxidation photocurrent. In this study, a nanoplate-like tungsten oxide with dual oxygen and tungsten vacancies (WO3-x) was successfully fabricated on tungsten foil by acid-mediated hydrothermal treatment to highly improve the photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance of WO3-x photoanode. Thermal annealing at 550 °C in air led to an oxygen deficient surface with a sub-stoichiometric by phase transformation from orthorhombic WO3·.nH2O to γ-monoclinic. However, the optimum number of oxygen vacancies in WO3-x fabricated at 2 h (W-2 h) with compact, porous and uniform nanoplate film that provide a large surface area for efficient charge collecting capability, caused an enhanced photocurrent density of 4.12 mA/cm2 (41.2 mA/W) at 1.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl, as compared to W-3 h (2.59 mA/cm2, or 25.9 mA/W) and W-30 min (1.79 mA/cm2 or 17.9 mA/W). Finally, local variations in dual oxygen and tungsten vacancies and in the electronic band structure of a WO3-x thin film was analyzed with ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-DRS).

Abstract: An investigation on a new type of shape-stabilized phase change material (PCM) prepared by impregnating eutectic salt hydrate (Na2SO4·10H2O-Na2CO3·10H2O with 1:1 in mass ratio) into expanded vermiculite (EV) is carried out in this study. The maximum mass percentage of Na2SO4·10H2O-Na2CO3·10H2O eutectic within the composite is determined as 60%. The chemical composition of EV is measured by X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometer (XRF). The specific surface area of EV and raw vermiculite (RV) is characterized by Brunauer-Aemmett-Teller (BET) method. The results from Scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) tests reveal that eutectic salt hydrate fully filled in the multilayer structure of EV and had good compatibility among the components of the composites. The phase change temperature and the melting enthalpy of the composites are 23.98 °C and 110.3 J/g respectively, which are measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Good thermal and structural reliability are also demonstrated by thermal gravimetric analysis (TG) techniques and thermal cycling tests. Moreover, the low thermal conductivity with 0.192 W/ (m K) tested by the Hot Disk via transient plane source method certifies that the composite is very applicable for insulation. The composite PCM is then tested in a reduced-scale test chamber outfitted with four thin PCM panels as insulated wallboards. The indoor temperature variations of the PCM room is compared with another identical chamber without PCM layer for evaluating the thermal regulating performance. The results show that the composite has the function of maintaining the indoor temperature at a comfortable range for a longer period and distinctly influenced the time delay. All analysis results indicate that the low-cost salt hydrate/EV composite can exert a great deal of influence on insulation in building energy conservation.

Abstract: Large bone defects and bone loss after fractures remain significant challenges for orthopedic surgeons. Our study aims to find an available, applicable and biological treatment for bone regeneration overcoming the limitations in ESC/iPSC technology. We directly reprogrammed the mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) into osteoblast cells using different combinations of Yamanaka factors with human lim mineralization protein-3 (hLMP-3). LMP is an intracellular LIM-domain protein acting as an effective positive regulator of the osteoblast differentiation. After transduction, cells were cultured in osteogenic medium, and then examined for osteoblast formation. The expression of osteogenic markers (BMP2, Runx2 and Osterix) during reprogramming and in vitro mineralization assay revealed that the best reprogramming cocktail was (c-Myc – Oct4) with hLMP-3. In addition, both immunofluorescent staining and western blot analysis confirmed that osteocalcin (OCN) expression increased in the cells treated with the c-Myc/Oct4/hLMP3 cocktail than using hLMP-3 alone. Furthermore, this reprogramming cocktail showed efficient healing in an induced femoral bone defect in rat animal model one month after transplantation. In the present study, we reported for the first time the effect of combining Yamanaka factors with hLMP-3 to induce osteoblast cells from MEF both in vitro and in vivo.

Abstract: Solar panels are usually covered with anti-reflection coatings (ARCs) that operate optimally for normal light incidence. Thus, ARCs effectiveness declines with increasing incident angles. In this contribution, we propose and design a polymer-based ARC that can be customized to operate optimally under a specific incident angle. It finds its application in building-applied photovoltaic (BAPV) and building-integrated PV (BIPV) systems where solar panels are installed on various building facets at arbitrary angles. A sample of the designed coating is fabricated using Polyurethane (PU) as a transparent polymer in a low-cost process. Our experiments show a 5.6% enhancement in the real outdoor conversion efficiency of a glass-covered Si solar cell equipped with the designed ARC under the targeted incident angle, wherein it is compared with a case in which our designed ARC is substituted by a plain PU-based sheet ARC of an equal thickness.

Doping and composition studies of crystalline layers are used as a guide for low-temperature, high growth-rate, MBE grown polycrystalline CdTe solar cells on various n-type emitters and different back-contacts. The best resulting devices reach efficiencies of 14.7% under AM 1.5 g, without an anti-reflection coating.

Abstract: Solar selective absorber coatings, combining of nanostructured, ternary transition metal spinel structure and composite oxides were prepared by a series of transition metal (Co, Ni and Cu) based nitrate salts. A single-layered structure of crystalline phase spinel-type oxide AB2O4 in the framework of simple wet chemical route and dip coating method was prepared in the crystalline structure of CuxNiyCoz-x-yO4. The X-ray diffraction profile of the oxide film was found to coincide with that of crystalline [Cu2+0.31Co3+0.16Co2+0.53]A[Cu2+0.17Ni3+0.16Co3+1.67]BO4 in the ICDD database. Precursor salts were heated at a particular temperature to form hydroxy nitrate solution followed by suitable solvent with different binders to form adherent sol for dip coating technique. By optimizing sol concentration, withdrawal speed and annealing temperature, uniform absorber layer with solar absorptance of 0.91 and emittance of 0.14 were achieved in a single layer coating with a composite oxide formation. The optical, structural and morphological properties of the optimized coatings of single layer CuxNiyCoz-x-yO4 spinel and composite oxide have been characterized by UV–Vis–NIR spectrophotometer, emissometer, X-ray diffraction, field emission - scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.

Abstract: Background
The expression of p38 MAPK is high in breast cancer while its subunit p38γ had been rarely reported. We aimed to explain the effect of p38γ in breast cancer from the perspective of metabolomics.
Methods
In this study, we detected the expression of p38γ in 28 breast carcinoma and para-tumor samples. Following MDA-MB-231 cell transfection with p38γ siRNAs and pc-DNA-3.1, cell viability, apoptosis, metastasis were determined through CCK-8, the cytometry analysis, transwell assay and wound healing assay. Finally, gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC–MS) was used for analysis the differential metabolites.
Results
The expression of p38γ was significantly up-regulated in breast cancer tissues. The transfection of si-p38γs could inhibit MDA-MB-231 cell propagation, metastasis, and induced cell apoptosis while overexpressed p38γ could promote the cell propagation, metastasis, and inhibit cell apoptosis. A total of 238 metabolites were identified and 72 of them differentially expressed in three groups (all P < 0.05, FDR < 0.05). Then the metabolites were enriched in the metabolism pathway, 85 pathways were included and 27 were significant (all P < 0.05, FDR < 0.05).
Conclusions
p38γ was up-regulated in breast cancer, which exerts a great influence on the cell growth, cell mobility, invasiveness, and apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells and also affected the metabolism.

Abstract: Daytime passive radiative cooling can achieve a cooling surface by reflecting the sunlight and radiating the heat to the outer space without consuming any energy. Aluminum phosphate (AlPO4) is a novel inorganic daytime passive radiative cooling material which has high solar reflectivity and high mid-infrared emissivity. The influence of heat treatment temperatures on crystallization behavior and optical properties are investigated by X-ray diffraction and spectrographs. The results demonstrate that increased heat treatment temperature will result in increased reflectivity but decreased mid-infrared emissivity. The effect of polyhedral structural differences between tridymite-type AlPO4 and cristobalite-type AlPO4 on mid-infrared and selective emissivity are discussed and analyzed. Furthermore, the tridymite-type AlPO4 fabricated at 700 °C possesses high solar reflectivity of 97% and selective emission with an emissivity of 0.90 across 8–13 µm. When made into coating, the optimum cooling effect could reach a temperature drop of ~4.2 °C lower than the ambient temperature and ~4.8 °C compared with commercial heat insulation coating under direct sunlight. This proves that AlPO4 is a promising energy-saving material for daytime passive radiative cooling application. Thus, it can greatly lower the indoor temperature and improve comfortability of people's living in buildings.

In the first part of this paper, the surface morphology of epitaxial layers grown on textured surfaces is studied. Because of the epitaxial growth, a pyramids-rounding effect is observed as a result of {311} and {911} facet propagation. The growth pattern was quantified and modelled. In the second part of this paper, the optical performance of semi-device test structures is evaluated. The trend of the optical results in bifacial solar cell structures indicates that a final pyramid angle at the rear side around 20° gives the maximum light absorption in the wafer substrate. In this work we demonstrate that the epitaxial growth of the emitter on the textured rear side of these devices can already give a pyramid angle of 25° without having to introduce any additional polishing steps to modify the morphology of the textured surface. In the last part of this paper, we present the electrical results for semi-device structures created to quantify the recombination losses in the passivated and metallized regions of those p-type epitaxial emitters. These results indicate that by introducing a rear epitaxial emitter in the bifacial n-type PERT cell structure, we can increase the implied Voc up to 17 mV compared to a diffused emitter with the same sheet resistance.

Abstract: Objective/Background
Glioblastoma (GB) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults. Ki-67 is a nonhistone nuclear protein that is expressed by cells entering the mitotic cycle and is associated with the transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA). In gliomas, the extent of expression of Ki-67 is roughly proportional to the histologic grade. Over the years, association studies were conducted trying to link the poor outcome in different types of malignant tumors to the Ki-67 proliferative index. This study is designed to investigate the relationship between the proliferation marker, Ki-67, and the overall survival amongst glioblastoma patients diagnosed between 2006 and 2012 at a single institution in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
Methods
This is a retrospective cohort study which investigated the status of Ki-67 labeling index in glioblastoma patients diagnosed at King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, between 2006 and 2012. The Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was used to assess the overall survival (OS) and the Mantel–Cox log-rank test was used to compare the survival curves. Multivariate analysis using Cox proportional-hazards model was used to investigate other factors that might influence the overall survival.
Results
A total of 44 glioblastoma patients were included in the study. The median age at diagnosis was 56 (1–91) years. The 12-month survival rate for all glioblastoma patients was 48%. The median survival for patients with Ki-67 labeling index of ≤27%, and >27% was 11 months and 14 months, respectively.
Conclusion
The difference between the survival curves of patients with Ki-67 labeling index of ≤27%, and Ki-67 of >27% was statistically insignificant (p = .130). Therefore, Ki-67 labeling index alone cannot predict survival in glioblastoma patients.

Abstract: Switching ability for infrared-light (IR) of commercial glass is of great interest for realizing practical smart windows which enable energy savings. In this article, we report on highly oriented growth of vanadium dioxide (VO2) films on ZnO-buffered glass substrates by means of biased reactive sputtering technique and their high switching ability for IR against temperature based on the insulator-metal transition (IMT). In addition, lower shift of transition temperature down to 55 °C was realized without deterioration of IMT properties in which resistance change nearly three orders of magnitude was kept. Shortening of in-plane V-V atoms distance through the effect of in-plane compressive stress responsible for energetic ion irradiation to biased substrate was supposed to contribute the achievement of controlled IMT temperatures. Large switching of around 50% for transmittance of IR with wavelength of 2.5 µm was realized under controlled phase transition temperatures. We emphasized that high biasing power enabled the shift of transition temperature for IR to nearly room temperature (～38 °C) by combination of the shortening of V-V distance and the oxygen defect formation, while the IMT reveals gradual change at biasing power higher than certain threshold value.

Abstract: Continuous epidemiological surveillance of existing and emerging viruses and their associated disorders is gaining importance in light of their abilities to cause unpredictable outbreaks as a result of increased travel and vaccination choices by steadily growing and aging populations. Close surveillance of outbreaks and herd immunity are also at the forefront, even in industrialized countries, where previously eradicated viruses are now at risk of re-emergence due to instances of strain recombination, contractions in viral vector geographies, and from their potential use as agents of bioterrorism. There is a great need for the rational design of current and future vaccines targeting viruses, with a strong focus on vaccine targeting of adaptive immune effector memory T cells as the gold standard of immunity conferring long-lived protection against a wide variety of pathogens and malignancies. Here, we review viruses that have historically caused large outbreaks and severe lethal disorders, including respiratory, gastric, skin, hepatic, neurologic, and hemorrhagic fevers. To observe trends in vaccinology against these viral disorders, we describe viral genetic, replication, transmission, and tropism, host-immune evasion strategies, and the epidemiology and health risks of their associated syndromes. We focus on immunity generated against both natural infection and vaccination, where a steady shift in conferred vaccination immunogenicity is observed from quantifying activated and proliferating, long-lived effector memory T cell subsets, as the prominent biomarkers of long-term immunity against viruses and their associated disorders causing high morbidity and mortality rates.

Abstract: Laser gas assisted texturing of tungsten surface is carried out towards achieving increased solar absorption at the surface. Morphological and metallurgical changes at the textured surface are examined using the analytical tools. Hydrophobic characteristics of the surface are assessed incorporating the water droplet contact angle measurement technique. The influence of environmental dust on the laser textured surface is investigated mimicking the humid air ambient. The adhesion of the dry mud on the textured surface is determined through measurement of tangential forces required to remove the dry mud from the surface. It is found that laser gas assisted processing results in surface texture composing of micro/nano pillars and formation of WO3 compounds in the treated layer. Hydrophobicity of the surface improves significantly after the laser texturing; in which case, the water droplet contact angle increases from 64° to 94°. The dry mud and dried liquid solution residues influence the UV visible absorption of the laser textured surface. In this case, absorption reduces almost 20% because of scattering of incident UV visible radiation by the residues at the textured surface.

Abstract: In this work, a novel nanocomposite phase change material (PCM) has been designed to greatly enhance the thermal energy storage capacity and thermal conductivity. It is the first time that two-dimensional montmorillonite nanosheets (2D-MMT) have been used in encapsulating stearic acid (SA) latex particles thus to prepare composite phase change materials (PCM), which is featured by the very thin shell and ultra-high content of active core materials. It was prepared through the self-assembly of positively charged MMT nanosheets on the negatively SA latex surfaces under a strong electrostatic attraction, leading to the formation of a core-shell structural composite PCM. The microstructure, thermal performances and cycling stability of this 2D-MMT/SA composites have been researched via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), zeta potential measurement and thermal constant analyzer. The experimental results have shown that 2D-MMT/SA composite contained an ultra-high mass fraction (> 80%) of SA due to the very thin MMT nanosheets shell, thus to have a tremendous latent heat storage capacity (184.88 J/g). In addition, the thermal conductivity of this PCM composite can reach to 159.46% of SA at most on account of the relatively high thermal conductivity of MMT nanosheets. Moreover, the protective 2D-MMT shell provided an excellent shape stability to the composite thus to restrict the leakage of PCM effectively. The composite also exhibited a stable cycling performance in the heating/cooling test. It is demonstrated that this 2D-MMT/SA composite would be of great promise for solar energy storage in sustainable energy field because of the very low cost, ultra-high latent heat storage capacity, promoted thermal conductivity, excellent structural stability and outstanding cycling performance.

Abstract: In this work, highly crystallized and lengths up to a centimeter organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) microwires (MWs) have been prepared via a solution-based blade coating and slow solvent evaporation method. And a two-step growth mechanism was proposed to explain the formation and growth of the MAPbI3 MWs. Further, the as-prepared MWs were used to fabricate photodetectors and their photoresponse characteristics were tested and detailedly analyzed. The results reveal that the devices presented stable and repeatable photocurrent responses. A high on/off photocurrent ratio of 0.84 × 104, a photoresponsivity of 0.04 A/W, a specific detectivity of 0.6 × 1012 Jones, and a fast response speed of 178/173 μs were realized in the prepared MAPbI3 photodetectors. More importantly, even without encapsulation, the proposed photodetectors demonstrate remarkable operation stability, above 80% of the photocurrent has been retained after a long running time (50,000 s, 45–55% humidity). After 60 days storage without encapsulation in air ambient, the proposed photodetectors can be efficiently sustained, demonstrating a strong ability to resist the water and oxygen degradation, greatly superior to reference photodetectors constructed with MAPbI3 thin films. This work opens up an exciting opportunity for using MAPbI3 MWs for high-performance and low-cost photodetectors applications.

Abstract: A predictive simulation framework, combining process and device simulation, is developed in order to assist in BBr3 boron tube furnace diffusion process optimization for n-type silicon wafer solar cells. After an appropriate calibration, the influence of the tube diffusion process parameters (drive-in temperature, oxidation temperature, etc) on the final solar cell efficiency can be predicted. The key process parameters of BBr3 tube furnace diffusion are identified and their sensitivity on the final solar cell efficiency is calculated. An efficiency gain of 0.6% absolute to 20.0% is realized by optimizing only the front-side boron diffused layer of the front and back contacted cells. The efficiency is further improved to 20.9% by introduction of a local back-surface field design. A further optimization potential of up to 0.2% absolute is predicted by modifying the boron diffusion profile.

Abstract: This study focused on developing single-atom silver-manganese catalysts for converting the increasingly concerning CO2 to highly demanded methane (CH4) with renewable solar energy via artificial photosynthesis. The performances of the Ag supported manganese oxides (Ag/HMO) and the single-atom silver-manganese catalysts (Ag-HMO) were tested and compared under the same conditions. The activity of Ag-HMO reached as high as 0.61 mol mol−1 catalysts, which was 1.53 times higher than that of Ag/HMO. The single-atom Ag chains in Ag-HMO promoted the electron transfer from Ag to HMO, the adsorption of visible light and the activation of adsorbed CO2, thus enhancing the photocatalytic performances. This research will be beneficial for the practical application of solar energy with plasmonic photocatalyst.

Abstract: End-of-life photovoltaic modules can be hazardous wastes if they contain hazardous materials. The main problem arising from this type of waste is the presence of environmentally toxic substances and the poor biodegradability of the waste, which occupies great volumes when landfilled. For these reasons, photovoltaic modules have to be treated before landfilling as required by the legislation. The subject of this paper is the polycrystalline silicon type photovoltaic modules. They were treated with a physical and a chemical process. The physical process was aimed at the recovery of glass, metals, and the polyvinyl fluoride film. The modules were initially shredded with a knife mill and then processed with heavy medium separation, milling, and sieving. The glass (76%) and 100% of the metals were recovered respectively, at a grade of about 100% and 67%. Finally, a flow sheet of the physical process was proposed. The chemical process was aimed at identifying the best conditions which allow the dissolution of the EVA (ethylene vinyl acetate), that is the polymer that attaches the three layers that make up the module, namely the glass, the polycrystalline silicon, and the polyvinyl fluoride support. The experimental factors investigated were: type of solvent, thermal pretreatment, treatment time, temperature, and ultrasound. The best conditions to completely dissolve EVA in less than 60 min were the use of toluene as a solvent at 60 °C combined with the use of ultrasound at 200 W, while the pretreatment at 200 °C appeared to be useless.

Abstract: Electrochromic smart devices with controllable optical property are the most promising alternative to traditional windows and curtains. State of the art preparation and commercialization of large-scale electrochromic films are mainly based on vapor phase deposition, but massive application is limited by high price (due to complex preparation process). Here, an all-solution technology is developed for large-area low-cost preparation of electrochromic films. A WO3/ITO dispersion was successfully developed; high electrical conductivity ITO nanoparticle networks along with ITO coating on glass can serve as extended 3-dimensional electrode, which can form microelectrical field and act as the pathways for electron diffusion to WO3 nanorods. In fact, experiment results show that the surface resistance of WO3/ITO nanocomposite film decreased to 32% of the pure WO3. In other words, the optimum WO3/ITO nanocomposite films in this study with “distributed conductive structure” and submicrometer-sized voids morphology have improved the electrochromic properties remarkably. Our optimized WO3/ITO films exhibit higher optical modulation than pristine WO3 (ΔT = 81.7% vs 62.5% at 630 nm) and a faster switching speed (tb = 6 s vs 22 s).

Abstract: Light and elevated temperature induced degradation (LeTID) is currently a severe issue in crystalline silicon photovoltaics, which has led to numerous efforts to both understand the mechanism and to mitigate it. Here we show that a low-temperature dark anneal performed as the last step in typical solar cell processing influences greatly LeTID characteristics, both the strength of the degradation and the degradation kinetics. While a relatively short anneal in the temperature range of 200–240 °C can be detrimental to LeTID by doubling the degradation intensity, an optimized anneal at 300 °C shows the opposite trend providing an efficient means to eliminate LeTID. Furthermore, we show that the simulated recombination activity of metal precipitation and dissolution during the dark anneal correlates with the experiments, suggesting a possible explanation for the LeTID mechanism.

Abstract: As an important electron transport layer, titanium dioxide is intensively studied in the polymer solar cells. Titanium dioxide exists as two main polymorphs which are anatase and rutile. However, the impacts of the presence of either or both of these phases on the performance of polymer solar cells remain unclear. In this work, high quality TiO2 films with controllable polymorphs are deposited via sputtering under room temperature. Pure phase of anatase and rutile are obtained. The distinguishing characteristics of the films were analyzed and PSCs with the structure of ITO/TiO2/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/MoOx/Ag were made. We found a better electron extraction efficiency of anatase which may originated from the band alignment of TiO2 in between ITO and active layer and smaller electron effective mass of anatase. Moreover, the anatase possesses a closer refractive index with ITO and high transparency in the short wavelength range which make it efficiently utilize the induced light. The efficiency of the PSCs has achieved 4.01% for rutile device and 8.26% for anatase device.

Abstract: Ovarian cancer is typically diagnosed at advanced stages (III or IV), with metastasis ensuing at stage III. Complete remission is infrequent and is not achieved in almost half of the women diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Consequently, management and treatment of this disease is challenging as many patients are faced with tumour recurrence disseminating to surrounding organs further complicated with acquired chemo-resistance. The cancer stem cell theory proposes the idea that a drug resistant subset of tumour cells drive tumour progression, metastasis and ultimately, recurrent disease. In the ovarian cancer field, cancer stem cells remain elusive with significant gaps in our knowledge. The characteristics and specific role of ovarian cancer stem cells in recurrence still requires further research since different studies often arrive at contradictory conclusions. Here we present a review and critical analysis of current research conducted in the field of ovarian cancer stem cells and their potential role in drug resistance including several signalling pathways within these cells that affect the viability of targeted therapies.

Abstract: In this work, a novel microencapsulated phase change material based on sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate as core and poly(ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate) as shell was successfully synthesized by interfacial polymerization in a water-in-oil emulsion system. The morphology, microstructure, surface elemental distribution, chemical composition and crystalline structure of the resultant microcapsules were determined by scanning and transmission electron microscopies, energy dispersive spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Besides, their thermal properties were also investigated systematically by differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetry analysis. The results showed that the microcapsules presented almost spherical profiles with a diameter of about 1.0 µm and a well-defined core-shell structure. Meanwhile, the microcapsules possessed phase change temperature of 46.44 °C and latent heat of 107.0 kJ·kg−1 at the core material/monomer mass ratio of 4/2. Due to the protective effect of shell material, the thermal stability of the microcapsules was improved. In addition, the thermal cycling test revealed that the microcapsules had good thermal reliability. Considering the above results, this synthetic technique can be considered as a feasible way to prepare microencapsulated salt hydrates and is expected to extend to the encapsulation of other hydrophilic substances. And the obtained microcapsules have great potential as a solar energy storage material.

Abstract: Phase change material emulsion (PCME) is a latent functionally thermal fluid prepared by dispersing a phase change material into a carrier fluid with the aid of surfactants. The PCME has a high specific heat capacity and enhanced heat transfer performance in the phase change region, and it shows great potential as a novel heat transfer fluid in air-conditioning systems and solar thermal systems. There have been few literature reviews on PCMEs. In this paper, a comprehensive summary of the research on PCMEs, including the fabrication process, thermophysical properties, rheological behavior, heat transfer performance, and applications in solar thermal systems, is presented. Additionally, directions for further studies and applications of PCMEs are proposed.

Abstract: Encapsulated paraffin-type phase change materials are considered important candidates for thermal energy storage applications. In this paper, we present icosane coated in a layer-by-layer fashion using the weak polyelectrolytes poly(acrylic acid) and poly(allylamine) in order to create ultra-thin cross-linkable and robust polymer encapsulations with storage capacities close to the pristine icosane. After coating, SEM images displayed an average particle size between 20 and 50 µm. Generally, smooth surface structures of the coated particles compared to uncoated icosane-surfactant particles, 1H NMR and FT-IR spectra as well as fluorescence imaging confirmed the successful encapsulation. Calculations of the PCM content revealed that the final product consisted of 88.6% core material. Accordingly, the resulting PCM capsules showed high storage capacities of 199.1 J g−1 close to the original value of pristine icosane (223.6 J g−1). Thermal stability was confirmed by TGA, revealing an increased resistance to thermal degradation of the coated particles (T10, bulk = 175.7 °C and T10, capsule = 186.8 °C). Moreover, repeatability and reliability of the phase change behavior were confirmed in thermal cycling experiments including 100 heating-cooling cycles with no observable influence on the performance of our material.

Abstract: Objective/background
Early coagulopathy in isolated severe traumatic brain injury occurs despite the lack of severe bleeding, shock, and fluid administration. We aimed to correlate coagulation activation/inhibition, thrombin generation and fibrinolysis with the development of acute trauma induced coagulopathy (TIC) and its effects on early mortality in isolated severe traumatic brain injury (iSTBI) patients.
Methods
A prospective screening of iSTBI patients was done for two years. History of anticoagulants, liver disease, hypotension, extracranial injuries, transfusion, brain death were excluded. TIC was defined as international normalized ratio (INR) ≥ 1.27 and/or prothrombin time (PT) ≥ 16.7 seconds and/or activated partial thromboplastin Time (aPTT) ≥ 28.8 seconds on admission following iSTBI. Analysis of tissue factor (TF), tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), protein C (PC), protein S (PS), thrombin/antithrombin complex (TAT), soluble fibrin monomer (sFM), tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) was done. Cases were categorized as presence or absence of TIC and 20 healthy controls participants were included.
Results
A total of 120 cases met the inclusion criteria, aged 35.7 ± 12.12 years, 96% males. TIC was identified in 50 (41.6%). TIC occurred independently of age, sex, Glasgow coma scale (GCS) but was associated with acidosis (60%; p = .01). Following iSTBI significant decline was seen in coagulation activation. Thrombin generation and fibrinolysis were markedly increased. TF, TFPI, PC and PS were low in TIC compared with control. Significant depletion of PS was seen in TIC versus No-TIC. TBI patients with depleted PS had an odds ratio (OR) of 7.10 (1.61–31.2) for TIC. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis depicted area under the curve (AUC) of 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63–0.84) with a cut-off of ≥74 of PS (specificity 63.9%, sensitivity 72.7%). In-hospital mortality was higher in TIC group (44%) compared with no-TIC (20%) with OR of 4.73 (95% CI 1.68–13.3) and hazard ratio [HR] of 2.8 (95 % CI 1.2–6.4).
Conclusion
Incidence of TIC in iSTBI is 41.6%, with 4.7 times odds for mortality. Traumatic brain injury causes enhanced coagulation activation, inadequate inhibition, exacerbation of thrombin generation, and subsequent increased fibrinolysis. ROC curve analysis revealed a cut-off of PS ≤ 74 with specificity 63.8%, sensitivity 72.7% for development of TIC.

Abstract: T cell function is dictated by a delicate balance of stimuli that shapes T-cell phenotype, the latter characterizable using a number of immunogenic assays. Thanks to advancements in next-generation sequencing technology, and the intersection between genetics, engineering, computer science, biostatistics, and immunology, it is now possible to profile immune cells residing in any organ or disease site at single cell resolution. Herein we review the most common approaches available to describe T cell activation, T cell molecular heterogeneity, and T cell function. We present informatic tools useful to both seasoned bioinformaticians and novices alike, providing a comprehensive overview of the in silico methods used to study T cell biology. With the goal of making this manuscript useful to a broad range of readers, we focus only on freely available tools and algorithms, and we describe the concepts using simple and direct language. We hope this work will serve to assist and inspire researchers interested in T cell biology.

Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Early growth response factor 1 (Egr1) plays a crucial role in cancer progression. However, its precise role in HCC has not been clear. Here, we identified the aggravating role of Egr1 in cell proliferation of HCC firstly. The expression of Egr1 was significantly increased in HCC tissues. Functionally, overexpression of Egr1 enhanced, whereas silenced Egr1 expression attenuated HCC cells proliferation in vitro. Mechanistically, up-regulated Egr1 induced cell proliferation through activating Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1/Smad signaling pathway concomitantly with upregulation of p-Smad2 and p-Smad3. Secondly, miR-181a-5p was down-regulated in clinical HCC specimens and its expression was inversely correlated with Egr1 expression. Functionally, overexpression of miR-181a-5p inhibited, whereas decreased expression of miR-181a-5p promoted HCC cells proliferation in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR-181a-5p overexpression directly suppressed Egr1, resulting in a down-regulated TGF-β1/Smad pathway. Besides, the silenced Egr1 expression could rescue the enhanced cell proliferation induced by miR-181a-5p inhibitor. Thus, we concluded that miR-181a-5p is a negative regulator of Egr1 that can suppress tumor proliferation in HCC through targeting Egr1/TGF-β1/Smad pathway, which may be a potential therapeutic approach of HCC.

Abstract: Two novel all-in-one electrochromic devices have been fabricated on the basis of low-cost and environmentally benign marine brown algae laminaria japonica, and jellyfish, which were both utilized as electronic component (gel electrolytes) in combination with electrochromic viologen bis(3-hydroxypropyl) viologen dibromide, and electron mediators 1,1′-ferrocene dicarboxylic acid and 1,1′-ferrocenedimethanol. The electrochromic performance of the as-fabricated devices was tested. The two biological ECDs exhibited driving voltages as low as 1.1 V, which is superior to many traditional viologen-based ECDs. Moreover, following the principles of green chemistry, no waste and organic solvents were introduced during the room-temperature device assembly. Based on abundant content of biological tissues, the device can be presented as a proof-of-concept to find potential applications in the fields of low-cost, green and large-scale ECDs.

Abstract: Perovskite solar cells have shown an impressive performance evolution during the last years. This technology has been mostly tested under laboratory conditions using small area devices. In this work, the outdoor photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells was evaluated under real tropical weather conditions. Specifically, two perovskite modules with active area of 17 and 50 cm2 were fabricated, encapsulated and tested. Taking a commercial silicon panel as reference, both technologies were evaluated for 500 h correlating the in-situ I-V measurements with atmospheric variables measured every minute during the light hours. To obtain the performance and the average outdoor efficiency of devices, we proposed a new adapted methodology based on the standard IEC 61853-1, showing the photovoltaic parameters performance through maps, to graphically visualize their behavior in a broad range of atmospheric conditions. Additionally, we demonstrated that the power delivery and short circuit current of both technologies correlate linearly with the atmospheric variables. Moreover, the open circuit voltage of perovskite technology exhibited a nonlinear behavior and an improved performance with temperature at high irradiance regimes. This work presents reliable information concerning perovskite solar technology performance under real outdoor operation conditions, being this crucial to identify competitive advantages of this technology and the aspects to be improved.
