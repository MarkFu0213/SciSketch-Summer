Abstract: Summary
The initiation of DNA replication involves cell cycle-dependent assembly and disassembly of protein complexes, including the origin recognition complex (ORC) and CDC6 AAA+ ATPases. We report that multiple short linear protein motifs (SLiMs) within intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in ORC1 and CDC6 mediate cyclin-CDK-dependent and independent protein-protein interactions, conditional on the cell cycle phase. A domain within the ORC1 IDR is required for interaction between the ORC1 and CDC6 AAA+ domains in G1, whereas the same domain prevents CDC6-ORC1 interaction during mitosis. Then, during late G1, this domain facilitates ORC1 destruction by a SKP2-cyclin A-CDK2-dependent mechanism. During G1, the CDC6 Cy motif cooperates with cyclin E-CDK2 to promote ORC1-CDC6 interactions. The CDC6 IDR regulates self-interaction by ORC1, thereby controlling ORC1 protein levels. Protein phosphatase 1 binds directly to a SLiM in the ORC1 IDR, causing ORC1 de-phosphorylation upon mitotic exit, increasing ORC1 protein, and promoting pre-RC assembly.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial functions across different tissues are regulated in a coordinated fashion to optimize the fitness of an organism. Mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) can be nonautonomously elicited by mitochondrial perturbation in neurons, but neuronal signals that propagate such response and its physiological significance remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that in C. elegans, loss of neuronal fzo-1/mitofusin induces nonautonomous UPRmt through multiple neurotransmitters and neurohormones, including acetylcholine, serotonin, glutamate, tyramine, and insulin-like peptides. Neuronal fzo-1 depletion also triggers nonautonomous mitochondrial fragmentation, which requires autophagy and mitophagy genes. Systemic activation of UPRmt and mitochondrial fragmentation in C. elegans via perturbing neuronal mitochondrial dynamics improves resistance to pathogenic Pseudomonas infection, which is supported by transcriptomic signatures of immunity and stress-response genes. We propose that C. elegans surveils neuronal mitochondrial dynamics to coordinate systemic UPRmt and mitochondrial connectivity for pathogen defense and optimized survival under bacterial infection.

Abstract: Summary
The ATPase Prp16 governs equilibrium between the branching (B∗/C) and exon ligation (C∗/P) conformations of the spliceosome. Here, we present the electron cryomicroscopy reconstruction of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae C-complex spliceosome at 2.8 Å resolution and identify a novel C-complex intermediate (Ci) that elucidates the molecular basis for this equilibrium. The exon-ligation factors Prp18 and Slu7 bind to Ci before ATP hydrolysis by Prp16 can destabilize the branching conformation. Biochemical assays suggest that these pre-bound factors prime the C complex for conversion to C∗ by Prp16. A complete model of the Prp19 complex (NTC) reveals how the branching factors Yju2 and Isy1 are recruited by the NTC before branching. Prp16 remodels Yju2 binding after branching, allowing Yju2 to remain tethered to the NTC in the C∗ complex to promote exon ligation. Our results explain how Prp16 action modulates the dynamic binding of step-specific factors to alternatively stabilize the C or C∗ conformation and establish equilibrium of the catalytic spliceosome.

Abstract: Summary
A near-constant feature of stress responses is a downregulation or arrest of the cell cycle, resulting in transient growth slowdown. To investigate the role of growth slowdown in the hyperosmotic shock response of S. cerevisiae, we perturbed the G1/S checkpoint protein Sic1 to enable osmo-stress response activation with diminished growth slowdown. We document that in this mutant, adaptation to stress is accelerated rather than delayed. This accelerated recovery of the mutant proceeds by liquidation of internal glycogen stores, which are then shunted into the osmo-shock response. Therefore, osmo-adaptation in wild-type cells is delayed because growth slowdown prevents full accessibility to cellular glycogen stores. However, faster adaptation comes at the cost of acute sensitivity to subsequent osmo-stresses. We suggest that stress-induced growth slowdown acts as an arbiter to regulate the resources devoted to osmo-shock, balancing short-term adaptation with long-term robustness.

Abstract: Summary
A body of data supports the existence of core (α2–α5) dimers of BAK and BAX in the oligomeric, membrane-perturbing conformation of these essential apoptotic effector molecules. Molecular structures for these dimers have only been captured for truncated constructs encompassing the core domain alone. Here, we report a crystal structure of BAK α2–α8 dimers (i.e., minus its flexible N-terminal helix and membrane-anchoring C-terminal segment) that has been obtained through the activation of monomeric BAK with the detergent C12E8. Core dimers are evident, linked through the crystal by contacts via latch (α6–α8) domains. This crystal structure shows activated BAK dimers with the extended latch domain present. Our data provide direct evidence for the conformational change converting BAK from inert monomer to the functional dimer that destroys mitochondrial integrity. This dimer is the smallest functional unit for recombinant BAK or BAX described so far.

Abstract: Introduction
The effects of the maternal nutritional environment on the growth and metabolism of the offspring, and its impacts on health in adult life are defined as metabolic programming. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) on the morphology of muscle fiber and neuromuscular junction (NMJ) of the offspring of rats submitted to RYGB.
Methods
Three-week-old Wistar rats were separated into two groups: 1) CAF SHAM which received a cafeteria diet and was submitted to a sham operation and 2) CAF RYGB, which received a cafeteria diet and was submitted to RYGB. The first generation (F1) offspring (male) was named according to the treatment of mothers as CAF SHAM-F1 and CAF RYGB-F1 and received a standard diet after weaning. At 17 weeks, the animals were euthanized, and the extensor digitorum longus muscle (EDL) was collected and processed in light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy for morphological and morphometric analysis.
Results
The CAF RYGB-F1 group showed a reduction in the weight of the EDL muscle and also a reduction in the area of type I, IIa and IIb fibers and a nucleus/fiber ratio. This same group also showed an increase in the capillary density and myofibrillar disorganization and in the Z-line, as well as a reduction in the area of the NMJs.
Conclusion
The RYGB surgery in mothers produced morphological changes in the skeletal striated muscles of the offspring.

Abstract: Summary
Although medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is known to play important roles in social behaviors, how early social experiences affect the mPFC and its subcortical circuit remains unclear. We report that mice singly housed (SH) for 8 weeks after weaning show a social recognition deficit, even after 4 weeks of resocialization. In SH mice, prefrontal infralimbic (IL) neurons projecting to the shell region of nucleus accumbens (NAcSh) show decreased excitability compared with group-housed (GH) mice. NAcSh-projecting IL neurons are activated when GH mice encounter a familiar conspecific, which is not observed in SH mice. Chemogenetic inhibition of NAcSh-projecting IL neurons in normal mice impairs social recognition without affecting social preference, whereas activation of these neurons reverses social recognition deficit in SH mice. Our findings demonstrate that early social experience critically affects mPFC IL-NAcSh projection, the activation of which is required for social recognition by encoding information for social familiarity.

Abstract: Summary
As one of the most popular nutrient supplements, creatine has been highly used to increase muscle mass and improve exercise performance. Here, we report an adverse effect of creatine using orthotopic mouse models, showing that creatine promotes colorectal and breast cancer metastasis and shortens mouse survival. We show that glycine amidinotransferase (GATM), the rate-limiting enzyme for creatine synthesis, is upregulated in liver metastases. Dietary uptake, or GATM-mediated de novo synthesis of creatine, enhances cancer metastasis and shortens mouse survival by upregulation of Snail and Slug expression via monopolar spindle 1 (MPS1)-activated Smad2 and Smad3 phosphorylation. GATM knockdown or MPS1 inhibition suppresses cancer metastasis and benefits mouse survival by downregulating Snail and Slug. Our findings call for using caution when considering dietary creatine to improve muscle mass or treat diseases and suggest that targeting GATM or MPS1 prevents cancer metastasis, especially metastasis of transforming growth factor beta receptor mutant colorectal cancers.

Abstract: Summary
mRNA translation is coupled to multiprotein complex assembly in the cytoplasm or to protein delivery into intracellular compartments. Here, by combining systematic RNA immunoprecipitation and single-molecule RNA imaging in yeast, we have provided a complete depiction of the co-translational events involved in the biogenesis of a large multiprotein assembly, the nuclear pore complex (NPC). We report that binary interactions between NPC subunits can be established during translation, in the cytoplasm. Strikingly, the nucleoporins Nup1/Nup2, together with a number of nuclear proteins, are instead translated at nuclear pores, through a mechanism involving interactions between their nascent N-termini and nuclear transport receptors. Uncoupling this co-translational recruitment further triggers the formation of cytoplasmic foci of unassembled polypeptides. Altogether, our data reveal that distinct, spatially segregated modes of co-translational interactions foster the ordered assembly of NPC subunits and that localized translation can ensure the proper delivery of proteins to the pore and the nucleus.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian chromatin is the site of both RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription and coupled RNA processing. However, molecular details of such co-transcriptional mechanisms remain obscure, partly because of technical limitations in purifying authentic nascent transcripts. We present a new approach to characterize nascent RNA, called polymerase intact nascent transcript (POINT) technology. This three-pronged methodology maps nascent RNA 5′ ends (POINT-5), establishes the kinetics of co-transcriptional splicing patterns (POINT-nano), and profiles whole transcription units (POINT-seq). In particular, we show by depletion of the nuclear exonuclease Xrn2 that this activity acts selectively on cleaved 5′ P-RNA at polyadenylation sites. Furthermore, POINT-nano reveals that co-transcriptional splicing either occurs immediately after splice site transcription or is delayed until Pol II transcribes downstream sequences. Finally, we connect RNA cleavage and splicing with either premature or full-length transcript termination. We anticipate that POINT technology will afford full dissection of the complexity of co-transcriptional RNA processing.

Abstract: Summary
Developing strategies to activate tumor-cell-intrinsic immune response is critical for improving tumor immunotherapy by exploiting tumor vulnerability. KDM4A, as a histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) demethylase, has been found to play a critical role in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) growth and metastasis. Here we report that KDM4A inhibition promoted heterochromatin compaction and induced DNA replication stress, which elicited antitumor immunity in SCC. Mechanistically, KDM4A inhibition promoted the formation of liquid-like HP1γ puncta on heterochromatin and stall DNA replication, which activated tumor-cell-intrinsic cGAS-STING signaling through replication-stress-induced cytosolic DNA accumulation. Moreover, KDM4A inhibition collaborated with PD1 blockade to inhibit SCC growth and metastasis by recruiting and activating CD8+ T cells. In vivo lineage tracing demonstrated that KDM4A inhibition plus PD1 blockade efficiently eliminated cancer stem cells. Altogether, our results demonstrate that targeting KDM4A can activate anti-tumor immunity and enable PD1 blockade immunotherapy by aggravating replication stress in SCC cells.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular senescence is a complex stress response implicated in aging. Autophagy can suppress senescence but is counterintuitively necessary for full senescence. Although its anti-senescence role is well described, to what extent autophagy contributes to senescence establishment and the underlying mechanisms is poorly understood. Here, we show that selective autophagy of multiple regulatory components coordinates the homeostatic state of senescence. We combined a proteomic analysis of autophagy components with protein stability profiling, identifying autophagy substrate proteins involved in several senescence-related processes. Selective autophagy of KEAP1 promoted redox homeostasis during senescence. Furthermore, selective autophagy limited translational machinery components to ameliorate senescence-associated proteotoxic stress. Lastly, selective autophagy of TNIP1 enhanced senescence-associated inflammation. These selective autophagy networks appear to operate in vivo senescence during human osteoarthritis. Our data highlight a caretaker role of autophagy in the stress support network of senescence through regulated protein stability and unravel the intertwined relationship between two important age-related processes.

Abstract: Summary
Primary cilia play a pivotal role in signal transduction and development and are known to serve as signaling hubs. Recent studies have shown that primary cilium dysfunction influences adipogenesis, but the mechanisms are unclear. Here, we show that mesenchymal progenitors C3H10T1/2 depleted of trichoplein, a key regulator of cilium formation, have significantly longer cilia than control cells and fail to differentiate into adipocytes. Mechanistically, the elongated cilia prevent caveolin-1- and/or GM3-positive lipid rafts from being assembled around the ciliary base where insulin receptor proteins accumulate, thereby inhibiting the insulin-Akt signaling. We further generate trichoplein knockout mice, in which adipogenic progenitors display elongated cilia and impair the lipid raft dynamics. The knockout mice on an extended high-fat diet exhibit reduced body fat and smaller adipocytes than wild-type (WT) mice. Overall, our results suggest a role for primary cilia in regulating adipogenic signal transduction via control of the lipid raft dynamics around cilia.

Abstract: Summary
The INK4a/ARF locus encodes important cell-cycle regulators p14ARF, p15INK4b, and p16INK4a. The neighboring gene desert to this locus is the most reproducible GWAS hotspot that harbors one of the densest enhancer clusters in the genome. However, how multiple enhancers that overlap with GWAS variants regulate the INK4a/ARF locus is unknown, which is an important step in linking genetic variation with associated diseases. Here, we show that INK4a/ARF promoters interact with a subset of enhancers in the cluster, independent of their H3K27ac and eRNA levels. Interacting enhancers transcriptionally control each other and INK4a/ARF promoters over long distances as an interdependent single unit. The deletion of even a single interacting enhancer results in an unexpected collapse of the entire enhancer cluster and leads to EZH2 enrichment on promoters in an ANRIL-independent manner. Dysregulated genes genome-wide mimic 9p21-associated diseases under these scenarios. Our results highlight intricate dependencies of promoter-interacting enhancers on each other.

Abstract: Summary
Basal breast cancer is associated with younger age, early relapse, and a high mortality rate. Here, we use unbiased droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to elucidate the cellular basis of tumor progression during the specification of the basal breast cancer subtype from the luminal progenitor population in the MMTV-PyMT (mouse mammary tumor virus-polyoma middle tumor-antigen) mammary tumor model. We find that basal-like cancer cells resemble the alveolar lineage that is specified upon pregnancy and encompass the acquisition of an aberrant post-lactation developmental program of involution that triggers remodeling of the tumor microenvironment and metastatic dissemination. This involution mimicry is characterized by a highly interactive multicellular network, with involution cancer-associated fibroblasts playing a pivotal role in extracellular matrix remodeling and immunosuppression. Our results may partially explain the increased risk and poor prognosis of breast cancer associated with childbirth.

Abstract: Summary
Septal parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) and calbindin-expressing (CB+) projections inhibit low-threshold and fast-spiking interneurons, respectively, in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC). We investigate how the two inputs control neuronal activity in the MEC in freely moving mice. Stimulation of PV+ and CB+ terminals causes disinhibition of spatially tuned MEC neurons, but exerts differential effects on temporal coding and burst firing. Thus, recruitment of PV+ projections disrupts theta-rhythmic firing of MEC neurons, while stimulation of CB+ projections increases burst firing of grid cells and enhances phase precession in a cell-type-specific manner. Inactivation of septal PV+ or CB+ neurons differentially affects context, reference, and working memory. Together, our results reveal how specific connectivity of septal GABAergic projections with MEC interneurons translates into differential modulation of MEC neuronal coding.

Abstract: Summary
Leucyl-tRNA synthetase 1 (LARS1) mediates activation of leucine-dependent mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) as well as ligation of leucine to its cognate tRNAs, yet its mechanism of leucine sensing is poorly understood. Here we describe leucine binding-induced conformational changes of LARS1. We determine different crystal structures of LARS1 complexed with leucine, ATP, and a reaction intermediate analog, leucyl-sulfamoyl-adenylate (Leu-AMS), and find two distinct functional states of LARS1 for mTORC1 activation. Upon leucine binding to the synthetic site, H251 and R517 in the connective polypeptide and 50FPYPY54 in the catalytic domain change the hydrogen bond network, leading to conformational change in the C-terminal domain, correlating with RagD association. Leucine binding to LARS1 is increased in the presence of ATP, further augmenting leucine-dependent interaction of LARS1 and RagD. Thus, this work unveils the structural basis for leucine-dependent long-range communication between the catalytic and RagD-binding domains of LARS1 for mTORC1 activation.

Abstract: Summary
Upon pathogen detection, the innate immune system triggers signaling events leading to upregulation of pro-inflammatory and anti-microbial mRNA transcripts. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) interact with these critical mRNAs and regulate their fates at the post-transcriptional level. One such RBP is ELAVL1. Although significant progress has been made in understanding how embryonic lethal vision-like protein 1 (ELAVL1) regulates mRNAs, its target repertoire and binding distribution within an immunological context remain poorly understood. We overlap four high-throughput approaches to define its context-dependent targets and determine its regulatory impact during immune activation. ELAVL1 transitions from binding overwhelmingly intronic sites to 3′ UTR sites upon immune stimulation of cells, binding previously and newly expressed mRNAs. We find that ELAVL1 mediates the RNA stability of genes that regulate pathways essential to pathogen sensing and cytokine production. Our findings reveal the importance of examining RBP regulatory impact under dynamic transcriptomic events to understand their post-transcriptional regulatory roles within specific biological circuitries.

Abstract: Summary
Parkinson’s disease is characterized by both hypokinetic and hyperkinetic symptoms. While increased subthalamic burst discharges have a direct causal relationship with the hypokinetic manifestations (e.g., rigidity and bradykinesia), the origin of the hyperkinetic symptoms (e.g., resting tremor and propulsive gait) has remained obscure. Neuronal burst discharges are presumed to be autonomous or less responsive to synaptic input, thereby interrupting the information flow. We, however, demonstrate that subthalamic burst discharges are dependent on cortical glutamatergic synaptic input, which is enhanced by A-type K+ channel inhibition. Excessive top-down-triggered subthalamic burst discharges then drive highly correlative activities bottom-up in the motor cortices and skeletal muscles. This leads to hyperkinetic behaviors such as tremors, which are effectively ameliorated by inhibition of cortico-subthalamic AMPAergic synaptic transmission. We conclude that subthalamic burst discharges play an imperative role in cortico-subcortical information relay, and they critically contribute to the pathogenesis of both hypokinetic and hyperkinetic parkinsonian symptoms.

Abstract: Summary
Stimulation of adipose tissue thermogenesis is regarded as a promising avenue in the treatment of obesity. However, pharmacologic engagement of this process has proven difficult. Using the Connectivity Map (CMap) approach, we identified the phytochemical hyperforin (HPF) as an anti-obesity agent. We found that HPF efficiently promoted thermogenesis by stimulating AMPK and PGC-1α via a Ucp1-dependent pathway. Using LiP-SMap (limited proteolysis-mass spectrometry) combined with a microscale thermophoresis assay and molecular docking analysis, we confirmed dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase (Dlat) as a direct molecular target of HPF. Ablation of Dlat significantly attenuated HPF-mediated adipose tissue browning both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, genome-wide association study analysis indicated that a variation in DLAT is significantly associated with obesity in humans. These findings suggest that HPF is a promising lead compound in the pursuit of a pharmacological approach to promote energy expenditure in the treatment of obesity.

Abstract: Summary
The process of hematopoiesis is subject to substantial ontogenic remodeling that is accompanied by alterations in cellular fate during both development and disease. We combine state-of-the-art mass spectrometry with extensive functional assays to gain insight into ontogeny-specific proteomic mechanisms regulating hematopoiesis. Through deep coverage of the cellular proteome of fetal and adult lympho-myeloid multipotent progenitors (LMPPs), common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs), and granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs), we establish that features traditionally attributed to adult hematopoiesis are conserved across lymphoid and myeloid lineages, whereas generic fetal features are suppressed in GMPs. We reveal molecular and functional evidence for a diminished granulocyte differentiation capacity in fetal LMPPs and GMPs relative to their adult counterparts. Our data indicate an ontogeny-specific requirement of myosin activity for myelopoiesis in LMPPs. Finally, we uncover an ontogenic shift in the monocytic differentiation capacity of GMPs, partially driven by a differential expression of Irf8 during fetal and adult life.

Abstract: LINC01089, a newly discovered long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), has been reported to inhibit the progression of various types of cancers. This study aimed to characterize LINC01089 in the pathogenesis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). LINC01089 expression in LUAD tissues or/and cells and its association with the overall survival of LUAD patients was analyzed in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-LUAD database, by qRT-PCR or by Kaplan-Meier’s curve. Databases of StarBase, LncBase, and DEmiRNA were used to predict and confirm the interaction between LINC01089 and potential LINC01089-targeted microRNAs (miRNAs). The expressions of these miRNAs in LUAD tissues or/and cells were determined by qRT-PCR, and dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed to validate lncRNA-miRNA interaction. The expressions of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) and Cleaved caspase-3 in LUAD cells were analyzed by Western blot. LINC01089 improved overall survival of LUAD patients and was low-expressed in LUAD. Upregulating LINC01089 expression reduced LUAD cell viability, inhibited colony formation, enhanced apoptosis, accompanied by downregulated Bcl-2 and miR-543 and upregulated Bax and Cleaved caspase-3. MiR-543 was determined as a target gene of LINC01089, and was high-expressed in LUAD tissues. Upregulating miR-543 expression induced the opposite effects to LINC01089 upregulation on these cellular biological behaviors and the expressions of Bcl-2, Bax and Cleaved caspase-3. Moreover, the effects of miR-543 upregulation and LINC01089 upregulation were mutually counteracted by each other. LINC01089 inhibited lung adenocarcinoma cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis via sponging miR-543.

Abstract: Summary
Depletion of architectural factors globally alters chromatin structure but only modestly affects gene expression. We revisit the structure-function relationship using the inactive X chromosome (Xi) as a model. We investigate cohesin imbalances by forcing its depletion or retention using degron-tagged RAD21 (cohesin subunit) or WAPL (cohesin release factor). Cohesin loss disrupts the Xi superstructure, unveiling superloops between escapee genes with minimal effect on gene repression. By contrast, forced cohesin retention markedly affects Xi superstructure, compromises spreading of Xist RNA-Polycomb complexes, and attenuates Xi silencing. Effects are greatest at distal chromosomal ends, where looping contacts with the Xist locus are weakened. Surprisingly, cohesin loss creates an Xi superloop, and cohesin retention creates Xi megadomains on the active X chromosome. Across the genome, a proper cohesin balance protects against aberrant inter-chromosomal interactions and tempers Polycomb-mediated repression. We conclude that a balance of cohesin eviction and retention regulates X inactivation and inter-chromosomal interactions across the genome.

Abstract: Even though mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known for cartilage regeneration, their therapeutic efficacy needs to be enhanced. In the present study, we produced genome-edited silent information regulator 2 type 1 (Sirt1)-overexpressing MSCs, and evaluated their therapeutic potential in a damaged cartilage mouse liver fibrosis model. The Sirt1 gene was successfully inserted into a ‘safe harbor’ genomic locus in amniotic mesenchymal stem cells (AMMs), and the chondrogenic properties of the Sirt1 gene overexpressing AMMs (AMM/S) were characterized using quantitative PCR and histology. Therapeutic potentials were investigated in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model. Chondrocyte-differentiated AMM/S expressed cartilage-specific genes and were positive for Safranin O staining. Transplantation of AMM/S attenuated CIA progression and suppressed T helper (Th)-17 cell activation while increasing the Treg cell population in CIA mice. Pro-inflammatory factors, such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were significantly decreased in AMM/S-injected joint tissues. In conclusion, genome-edited AMM/S may represent a safe and alternative therapeutic option for the treatment and repair of damaged cartilage, or in inflammatory joint arthritis.

Abstract: Summary
We describe a cellular contractile mechanism employed by fibroblasts and mesenchymal cancer cells to migrate in 3D collagen gels. During 3D spreading, fibroblasts strongly deform the matrix. They protrude, polarize, and initiate migration in the direction of highest extracellular matrix (ECM) deformation (prestrain). This prestrain is maintained through anterior cellular contractions behind the leading edge prior to protrusion, coordinating a distinct 3D migration cycle that varies between cell types. Myosin IIA is required for strain polarization, generating anterior contractions, and maintaining prestrain for efficient directional cell migration. Local matrix severing disrupts the matrix prestrain, suppressing directional protrusion. We show that epithelial cancer and endothelial cells rarely demonstrate the sustained prestrain or anterior contractions. We propose that mesenchymal cells sense ECM stiffness in 3D and generate their own matrix prestrain. This requires myosin IIA to generate polarized periodic anterior contractions for maintaining a 3D migration cycle.

Abstract: Summary
Soluble “SOSIP”-stabilized envelope (Env) trimers are promising HIV-vaccine immunogens. However, they induce high-titer responses against the glycan-free trimer base, which is occluded on native virions. To delineate the effect on base responses of priming with immunogens targeting the fusion peptide (FP) site of vulnerability, here, we quantify the prevalence of trimer-base antibody responses in 49 non-human primates immunized with various SOSIP-stabilized Env trimers and FP-carrier conjugates. Trimer-base responses account for ∼90% of the overall trimer response in animals immunized with trimer only, ∼70% in animals immunized with a cocktail of SOSIP trimer and FP conjugate, and ∼30% in animals primed with FP conjugates before trimer immunization. Notably, neutralization breadth in FP-conjugate-primed animals correlates inversely with trimer-base responses. Our data provide methods to quantify the prevalence of trimer-base responses and reveal that FP-conjugate priming, either alone or as part of a cocktail, can reduce the trimer-base response and improve the neutralization outcome.

Abstract: Summary
The heterogeneity and molecular characteristics of progenitor cells, especially glial progenitors, in the developing human cerebral cortex remain elusive. Here, we find that EGFR expression begins to sharply increase after gestational week (GW) 20, which corresponds to the beginning stages of human gliogenesis. In addition, EGFR+ cells are mainly distributed in the germinal zone and frequently colocalize with the stemness marker SOX2 during this period. Then, by performing single-cell RNA sequencing on these EGFR+ cells, we successfully enriched and characterized various glial- and neuronal-lineage progenitor cells and validated their phenotypes in fixed slices. Notably, we identified two subgroups with molecular characteristics similar to those of astrocytes, and the immunostaining results show that these cells are mainly distributed in the outer subventricular zone and might originate from the outer radial glial cells. In short, the EGFR-sorting strategy and molecular signatures in the diverse lineages provide insights into human glial development.

Abstract: Summary
Although many of the factors, epigenetic changes, and cell cycle stages that distinguish repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) by homologous recombination (HR) from non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) are known, the underlying mechanisms that determine pathway choice are incompletely understood. Previously, we found that the transcription factor Sp1 is recruited to DSBs and is necessary for repair. Here, we demonstrate that Sp1 localizes to DSBs in G1 and is necessary for recruitment of the NHEJ repair factor, 53BP1. Phosphorylation of Sp1-S59 in early S phase evicts Sp1 and 53BP1 from the break site; inhibition of that phosphorylation results in 53BP1 and Sp1 remaining at DSBs in S phase cells, precluding BRCA1 binding and suppressing HR. Expression of Sp1-S59A increases sensitivity of BRCA1+/+ cells to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition similar to BRCA1 deficiency. These data demonstrate how Sp1 integrates the cell cycle and DSB repair pathway choice to favor NHEJ.

Abstract: Summary
Stromal-interaction molecules (STIM1/2) sense endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ depletion and activate Orai channels. However, the choreography of interactions between native STIM/Orai proteins under physiological agonist stimulation is unknown. We show that the five STIM1/2 and Orai1/2/3 proteins are non-redundant and function together to ensure the graded diversity of mammalian Ca2+ signaling. Physiological Ca2+ signaling requires functional interactions between STIM1/2, Orai1/2/3, and IP3Rs, ensuring that receptor-mediated Ca2+ release is tailored to Ca2+ entry and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) activation. The N-terminal Ca2+-binding ER-luminal domains of unactivated STIM1/2 inhibit IP3R-evoked Ca2+ release. A gradual increase in agonist intensity and STIM1/2 activation relieves IP3R inhibition. Concomitantly, activated STIM1/2 C termini differentially interact with Orai1/2/3 as agonist intensity increases. Thus, coordinated and omnitemporal functions of all five STIM/Orai and IP3Rs translate the strength of agonist stimulation to precise levels of Ca2+ signaling and NFAT induction, ensuring the fidelity of complex mammalian Ca2+ signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Mismatch negativity (MMN) is a differential electrophysiological response measuring cortical adaptability to unpredictable stimuli. MMN is consistently attenuated in patients with psychosis. However, the genetics of MMN are uncharted, limiting the validation of MMN as a psychosis endophenotype. Here, we perform a transcriptome-wide association study of 728 individuals, which reveals 2 genes (FAM89A and ENGASE) whose expression in cortical tissues is associated with MMN. Enrichment analyses of neurodevelopmental expression signatures show that genes associated with MMN tend to be overexpressed in the frontal cortex during prenatal development but are significantly downregulated in adulthood. Endophenotype ranking value calculations comparing MMN and three other candidate psychosis endophenotypes (lateral ventricular volume and two auditory-verbal learning measures) find MMN to be considerably superior. These results yield promising insights into sensory processing in the cortex and endorse the notion of MMN as a psychosis endophenotype.

Abstract: Summary
Evidence regarding intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct (IPNB) as a type of precancerous lesion of cholangiocarcinoma is limited. Moreover, a reproducible in vivo model is lacking, and IPNB pathogenesis remains unclear. Here, we use a doxycycline-inducible tetracycline (Tet)-on mice model to control fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10) expression, which regulates branching and tubule formation. FGF10-induced IPNB mimics the multifocal and divergent human IPNB phenotypes via the FGF10-FGF receptor 2 (FGFR2)-RAS-extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway. A paracrine/autocrine growth factor is sufficient to initiate and maintain IPNB originating from the peribiliary glands, including biliary stem/progenitor cells. With KrasG12D, p53, or p16 mutations or both, Fgf10-induced IPNB shows stepwise carcinogenesis, causing associated invasive carcinoma. Fgf10-induced papillary changes and progression are suppressed by the inhibition of the FGF10-FGFR2-RAS-ERK signaling pathway, demonstrating that the signal is a therapeutic target for IPNB and associated carcinoma.

Abstract: Summary
Ogt catalyzed O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAcylation, O-GlcNAc) plays an important function in diverse biological processes and diseases. However, the roles of Ogt in regulating neurogenesis remain largely unknown. Here, we show that Ogt deficiency or depletion in adult neural stem/progenitor cells (aNSPCs) leads to the diminishment of the aNSPC pool and aberrant neurogenesis and consequently impairs cognitive function in adult mice. RNA sequencing reveals that Ogt deficiency alters the transcription of genes relating to cell cycle, neurogenesis, and neuronal development. Mechanistic studies show that Ogt directly interacts with Notch1 and catalyzes the O-GlcNAc modification of Notch TM/ICD fragment. Decreased O-GlcNAc modification of TM/ICD increases the binding of E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch to TM/ICD and promotes its degradation. Itch knockdown rescues neurogenic defects induced by Ogt deficiency in vitro and in vivo. Our findings reveal the essential roles and mechanisms of Ogt and O-GlcNAc modification in regulating mammalian neurogenesis and cognition.

Abstract: Summary
As vaccine-induced non-neutralizing antibodies may cause antibody-dependent enhancement of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection, we test a vaccine that induces only specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) without specific antibodies. We construct a DNA vaccine expressing a ubiquitinated and rearranged ZIKV non-structural protein 3 (NS3). The protein is immediately degraded and processed in the proteasome for presentation via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I for CTL generation. We immunize Ifnar1−/− adult mice with the ubiquitin/NS3 vaccine, impregnate them, and challenge them with ZIKV. Our data show that the vaccine greatly reduces viral titers in reproductive organs and other tissues of adult mice. All mice immunized with the vaccine survived after ZIKV challenge. The vaccine remarkably reduces placenta damage and levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and it fully protects fetuses from damage. CD8+ CTLs are essential in protection, as demonstrated via depletion experiments. Our study provides a strategy to develop safe and effective vaccines against viral infections.

Abstract: Summary
Various human diseases and pregnancy-related disorders reflect endometrial dysfunction. However, rodent models do not share fundamental biological processes with the human endometrium, such as spontaneous decidualization, and no existing human cell cultures recapitulate the cyclic interactions between endometrial stromal and epithelial compartments necessary for decidualization and implantation. Here we report a protocol differentiating human pluripotent stem cells into endometrial stromal fibroblasts (PSC-ESFs) that are highly pure and able to decidualize. Coculture of PSC-ESFs with placenta-derived endometrial epithelial cells generated organoids used to examine stromal-epithelial interactions. Cocultures exhibited specific endometrial markers in the appropriate compartments, organization with cell polarity, and hormone responsiveness of both cell types. Furthermore, cocultures recapitulate a central feature of the human decidua by cyclically responding to hormone withdrawal followed by hormone retreatment.

Abstract: Summary
Dysregulated mTORC1 signaling alters a wide range of cellular processes, contributing to metabolic disorders and cancer. Defining the molecular details of downstream effectors is thus critical for uncovering selective therapeutic targets. We report that mTORC1 and its downstream kinase S6K enhance eIF4A/4B-mediated translation of Wilms’ tumor 1-associated protein (WTAP), an adaptor for the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methyltransferase complex. This regulation is mediated by 5′ UTR of WTAP mRNA that is targeted by eIF4A/4B. Single-nucleotide-resolution m6A mapping revealed that MAX dimerization protein 2 (MXD2) mRNA contains m6A, and increased m6A modification enhances its degradation. WTAP induces cMyc-MAX association by suppressing MXD2 expression, which promotes cMyc transcriptional activity and proliferation of mTORC1-activated cancer cells. These results elucidate a mechanism whereby mTORC1 stimulates oncogenic signaling via m6A RNA modification and illuminates the WTAP-MXD2-cMyc axis as a potential therapeutic target for mTORC1-driven cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Metastasis is facilitated by the formation of a “premetastatic niche,” which is fostered by primary tumor-derived factors. Colorectal cancer (CRC) metastasizes mainly to the liver. We show that the premetastatic niche in the liver is induced by bacteria dissemination from primary CRC. We report that tumor-resident bacteria Escherichia coli disrupt the gut vascular barrier (GVB), an anatomical structure controlling bacterial dissemination along the gut-liver axis, depending on the virulence regulator VirF. Upon GVB impairment, bacteria disseminate to the liver, boost the formation of a premetastatic niche, and favor the recruitment of metastatic cells. In training and validation cohorts of CRC patients, we find that the increased levels of PV-1, a marker of impaired GVB, is associated with liver bacteria dissemination and metachronous distant metastases. Thus, PV-1 is a prognostic marker for CRC distant recurrence and vascular impairment, leading to liver metastases.

Abstract: Summary
During self-renewal, cell-type-defining features are drastically perturbed in mitosis and must be faithfully reestablished upon G1 entry, a process that remains largely elusive. Here, we characterized at a genome-wide scale the dynamic transcriptional and architectural resetting of mouse pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) upon mitotic exit. We captured distinct waves of transcriptional reactivation with rapid induction of stem cell genes and transient activation of lineage-specific genes. Topological reorganization at different hierarchical levels also occurred in an asynchronous manner and showed partial coordination with transcriptional resetting. Globally, rapid transcriptional and architectural resetting associated with mitotic retention of H3K27 acetylation, supporting a bookmarking function. Indeed, mitotic depletion of H3K27ac impaired the early reactivation of bookmarked, stem-cell-associated genes. However, 3D chromatin reorganization remained largely unaffected, suggesting that these processes are driven by distinct forces upon mitotic exit. This study uncovers principles and mediators of PSC molecular resetting during self-renewal.

Abstract: Summary
Adenosine-to-inosine editing is catalyzed by ADAR1 at thousands of sites transcriptome-wide. Despite intense interest in ADAR1 from physiological, bioengineering, and therapeutic perspectives, the rules of ADAR1 substrate selection are poorly understood. Here, we used large-scale systematic probing of ∼2,000 synthetic constructs to explore the structure and sequence context determining editability. We uncover two structural layers determining the formation and propagation of A-to-I editing, independent of sequence. First, editing is robustly induced at fixed intervals of 35 bp upstream and 30 bp downstream of structural disruptions. Second, editing is symmetrically introduced on opposite sites on a double-stranded structure. Our findings suggest a recursive model for RNA editing, whereby the structural alteration induced by the editing at one site iteratively gives rise to the formation of an additional editing site at a fixed periodicity, serving as a basis for the propagation of editing along and across both strands of double-stranded RNA structures.

Abstract: Summary
The shoot apical meristem allows for reiterative formation of new aerial structures throughout the life cycle of a plant. We use single-cell RNA sequencing to define the cellular taxonomy of the Arabidopsis vegetative shoot apex at the transcriptome level. We find that the shoot apex is composed of highly heterogeneous cells, which can be partitioned into 7 broad populations with 23 transcriptionally distinct cell clusters. We delineate cell-cycle continuums and developmental trajectories of epidermal cells, vascular tissue, and leaf mesophyll cells and infer transcription factors and gene expression signatures associated with cell fate decisions. Integrative analysis of shoot and root apical cell populations further reveals common and distinct features of epidermal and vascular tissues. Our results, thus, offer a valuable resource for investigating the basic principles underlying cell division and differentiation in plants at single-cell resolution.

Abstract: Summary
Invasive or penetrative growth is critical for developmental and reproductive processes (e.g., pollen tube penetration of pistils) and disease progression (e.g., cancer metastasis and fungal hyphae invasion). The invading or penetrating cells experience drastic changes in mechanical pressure from the surroundings and must balance growth with cell integrity. Here, we show that Arabidopsis pollen tubes sense and/or respond to mechanical changes via a cell-surface receptor kinase Buddha's Paper Seal 1 (BUPS1) while emerging from compressing female tissues. BUPS1-defective pollen tubes fail to maintain cell integrity after emergence from these tissues. The mechano-transduction function of BUPS1 is established by using a microfluidic channel device mimicking the mechanical features of the in vivo growth path. BUPS1-based mechano-transduction activates Rho-like GTPase from Plant 1 (ROP1) GTPase to promote exocytosis that facilitates secretion of BUPS1’s ligands for mechanical signal amplification and cell wall rigidification in pollen tubes. These findings uncover a membrane receptor-based mechano-transduction system for cells to cope with the physical challenges during invasive or penetrative growth.

Abstract: Summary
Antibodies that target the glycan cap epitope on the ebolavirus glycoprotein (GP) are common in the adaptive response of survivors. A subset is known to be broadly neutralizing, but the details of their epitopes and basis for neutralization are not well understood. Here, we present cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of diverse glycan cap antibodies that variably synergize with GP base-binding antibodies. These structures describe a conserved site of vulnerability that anchors the mucin-like domains (MLDs) to the glycan cap, which we call the MLD anchor and cradle. Antibodies that bind to the MLD cradle share common features, including use of IGHV1-69 and IGHJ6 germline genes, which exploit hydrophobic residues and form β-hairpin structures to mimic the MLD anchor, disrupt MLD attachment, destabilize GP quaternary structure, and block cleavage events required for receptor binding. Our results provide a molecular basis for ebolavirus neutralization by broadly reactive glycan cap antibodies.

Abstract: Summary
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the latest respiratory pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although infection initiates in the proximal airways, severe and sometimes fatal symptoms of the disease are caused by infection of the alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells of the distal lung and associated inflammation. In this study, we develop primary human lung epithelial infection models to understand initial responses of proximal and distal lung epithelium to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Differentiated air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures of proximal airway epithelium and alveosphere cultures of distal lung AT2 cells are readily infected by SARS-CoV-2, leading to an epithelial cell-autonomous proinflammatory response with increased expression of interferon signaling genes. Studies to validate the efficacy of selected candidate COVID-19 drugs confirm that remdesivir strongly suppresses viral infection/replication. We provide a relevant platform for study of COVID-19 pathobiology and for rapid drug screening against SARS-CoV-2 and emergent respiratory pathogens.

Abstract: Summary
Viral genetic tools that target specific brain cell types could transform basic neuroscience and targeted gene therapy. Here, we use comparative open chromatin analysis to identify thousands of human-neocortical-subclass-specific putative enhancers from across the genome to control gene expression in adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. The cellular specificity of reporter expression from enhancer-AAVs is established by molecular profiling after systemic AAV delivery in mouse. Over 30% of enhancer-AAVs produce specific expression in the targeted subclass, including both excitatory and inhibitory subclasses. We present a collection of Parvalbumin (PVALB) enhancer-AAVs that show highly enriched expression not only in cortical PVALB cells but also in some subcortical PVALB populations. Five vectors maintain PVALB-enriched expression in primate neocortex. These results demonstrate how genome-wide open chromatin data mining and cross-species AAV validation can be used to create the next generation of non-species-restricted viral genetic tools.

Abstract: Metabolic impairments in childhood are known to promote the development of type 2 diabetes and/or obesity in adulthood. These impairments may result from perinatal exposure to harmful environmental factors, such as pesticide residues or the consumption of a “western” diet. In the present study, we sought to determine whether an obesogenic profile, metabolic disorders and liver damage in offspring (observed during young adulthood) were related to maternal exposure to the pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) and/or a high-fat diet (HFD) starting 4 months before conception and ending at weaning. After the end of exposure, 51 male rat pups were left to develop under normal conditions and were studied in young adulthood. Despite the absence of direct exposure to harmful factors (other than through the dam's milk), maternal exposure to CPF or an HFD was associated with changes in the offspring's metabolic activity in the liver in the offspring. This indirect exposure to CPF was associated with a relative reduction in the expression of genes coding for enzymes involved in lipid or glucose metabolism but did induce histopathological changes in the offspring at adulthood. Maternal exposure to an HFD alone or to CPF alone gave similar results in offspring, changes in the same direction. Exposure of the mother to HFD did not exacerbate CPF effects. Co-exposure to both CPF and HFD did not increase the observed effects compared to each factor taken separately.

Abstract: Summary
Adipose tissue mass and adiposity change throughout the lifespan. During aging, while visceral adipose tissue (VAT) tends to increase, peripheral subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) decreases significantly. Unlike VAT, which is linked to metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, SAT has beneficial effects. However, the molecular details behind the aging-associated loss of SAT remain unclear. Here, by comparing scRNA-seq of total stromal vascular cells of SAT from young and aging mice, we identify an aging-dependent regulatory cell (ARC) population that emerges only in SAT of aged mice and humans. ARCs express adipose progenitor markers but lack adipogenic capacity; they secrete high levels of pro-inflammatory chemokines, including Ccl6, to inhibit proliferation and differentiation of neighboring adipose precursors. We also found Pu.1 to be a driving factor for ARC development. We identify an ARC population and its capacity to inhibit differentiation of neighboring adipose precursors, correlating with aging-associated loss of SAT.

Abstract: Summary
Pseudomonas syringae, a Gram-negative plant pathogen, expresses multitudinous transcriptional regulators to control the type III secretion system (T3SS) and response to diverse environmental challenges. Although the mechanisms of virulence-associated regulators of P. syringae have been studied for decades, the overall crosstalk underlying these regulators is still elusive. Here, we identify five T3SS regulators (EnvZ-OmpR, CbrAB2, PhoPQ, PilRS, and MgrA), and find that the two-component systems EnvZ-OmpR and CbrAB2 negatively regulate the T3SS. To elucidate crosstalk between 16 virulence-associated regulators in P. syringae, we map an online intricate network called “PSRnet” (Pseudomonas syringae regulatory network) by combining the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of these 16 regulators by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and their binding loci by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq). Consequently, we identify 238 and 153 functional genes involved in the T3SS and other virulence-related pathways in KB and MM media, respectively. Our results provide insights into the mechanism of plant infections caused by P. syringae.

Abstract: Summary
Naive CD8+ T cell activation results in an autonomous program of cellular proliferation and differentiation. However, the mechanisms that underpin this process are unclear. Here, we profile genome-wide changes in chromatin accessibility, gene transcription, and the deposition of a key chromatin modification (H3K27me3) early after naive CD8+ T cell activation. Rapid upregulation of the histone demethylase KDM6B prior to the first cell division is required for initiating H3K27me3 removal at genes essential for subsequent T cell differentiation and proliferation. Inhibition of KDM6B-dependent H3K27me3 demethylation limits the magnitude of an effective primary virus-specific CD8+ T cell response and the formation of memory CD8+ T cell populations. Accordingly, we define the early spatiotemporal events underpinning early lineage-specific chromatin reprogramming that are necessary for autonomous CD8+ T cell proliferation and differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a debilitating neurological disorder marked by degeneration of spinal motor neurons and muscle atrophy. SMA results from mutations in survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1), leading to deficiency of survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. Current therapies increase SMN protein and improve patient survival but have variable improvements in motor function, making it necessary to identify complementary strategies to further improve disease outcomes. Here, we perform a genome-wide RNAi screen using a luciferase-based activity reporter and identify genes involved in regulating SMN gene expression, RNA processing, and protein stability. We show that reduced expression of Transcription Export complex components increases SMN levels through the regulation of nuclear/cytoplasmic RNA transport. We also show that the E3 ligase, Neurl2, works cooperatively with Mib1 to ubiquitinate and promote SMN degradation. Together, our screen uncovers pathways through which SMN expression is regulated, potentially revealing additional strategies to treat SMA.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria have an independent genome (mtDNA) and protein synthesis machinery that coordinately activate for mitochondrial generation. Here, we report that the Krebs cycle intermediate fumarate links metabolism to mitobiogenesis through binding to malic enzyme 2 (ME2). Mechanistically, fumarate binds ME2 with two complementary consequences. First, promoting the formation of ME2 dimers, which activate deoxyuridine 5′-triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (DUT). DUT fosters thymidine generation and an increase of mtDNA. Second, fumarate-induced ME2 dimers abrogate ME2 monomer binding to mitochondrial ribosome protein L45, freeing it for mitoribosome assembly and mtDNA-encoded protein production. Methylation of the ME2-fumarate binding site by protein arginine methyltransferase-1 inhibits fumarate signaling to constrain mitobiogenesis. Notably, acute myeloid leukemia is highly dependent on mitochondrial function and is sensitive to targeting of the fumarate-ME2 axis. Therefore, mitobiogenesis can be manipulated in normal and malignant cells through ME2, an unanticipated governor of mitochondrial biomass production that senses nutrient availability through fumarate.

Abstract: Summary
The Tre1 G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) was discovered to be required for Drosophila germ cell (GC) coalescence almost two decades ago, yet the molecular events both upstream and downstream of Tre1 activation remain poorly understood. To gain insight into these events, we describe a bona fide null allele and both untagged and tagged versions of Tre1. We find that the primary defect with complete Tre1 loss is the failure of GCs to properly navigate, with GC mis-migration occurring from early stages. We find that Tre1 localizes with F-actin at the migration front, along with PI(4,5)P2; dPIP5K, an enzyme that generates PI(4,5)P2; and dWIP, a protein that binds activated Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP), which stimulates F-actin polymerization. We show that Tre1 is required for polarized accumulation of F-actin, PI(4,5)P2, and dPIP5K. Smoothened also localizes with F-actin at the migration front, and Hh, through Smo, increases levels of Tre1 at the plasma membrane and Tre1’s association with dPIP5K.

Abstract: Summary
Devil facial tumor disease (DFTD) and its lack of available therapies are propelling the Tasmanian devil population toward extinction. This study demonstrates that cholesterol homeostasis and carbohydrate energy metabolism sustain the proliferation of DFTD cells in a cell-type-dependent manner. In addition, we show that the liver-X nuclear receptor-β (LXRβ), a major cholesterol cellular sensor, and its natural ligand 24S-hydroxycholesterol promote the proliferation of DFTD cells via a metabolic switch toward aerobic glycolysis. As a proof of concept of the role of cholesterol homeostasis on DFTD proliferation, we show that atorvastatin, an FDA-approved statin-drug subtype used against human cardiovascular diseases that inhibits cholesterol synthesis, shuts down DFTD energy metabolism and prevents tumor growth in an in vivo DFTD-xenograft model. In conclusion, we show that intervention against cholesterol homeostasis and carbohydrate-dependent energy metabolism by atorvastatin constitutes a feasible biochemical treatment against DFTD, which may assist in the conservation of the Tasmanian devil.

Abstract: Summary
It is well established that seizures beget seizures, yet the cellular processes that underlie progressive epileptogenesis remain unclear. Here, we use optogenetics to briefly activate targeted populations of mouse piriform cortex (PCx) principal neurons in vivo. After just 3 or 4 days of stimulation, previously subconvulsive stimuli trigger massive, generalized seizures. Highly recurrent allocortices are especially prone to “optokindling.” Optokindling upsets the balance of recurrent excitation and feedback inhibition. To understand how this balance is disrupted, we then selectively reactivate the same neurons in vitro. Surprisingly, we find no evidence of heterosynaptic potentiation; instead, we observe a marked, pathway-specific decrease in feedback inhibition. We find no loss of inhibitory interneurons; rather, decreased GABA synthesis in feedback inhibitory neurons appears to underlie weakened inhibition. Optokindling will allow precise identification of the molecular processes by which brain activity patterns can progressively and pathologically disrupt the balance of cortical excitation and inhibition.

Abstract: Summary
How genes interact with the environment to shape phenotypic variation and evolution is a fundamental question intriguing to biologists from various fields. Existing linear models built on single genes are inadequate to reveal the complexity of genotype-environment (G-E) interactions. Here, we develop a conceptual model for mechanistically dissecting G-E interplay by integrating previously disconnected theories and methods. Under this integration, evolutionary game theory, developmental modularity theory, and a variable selection method allow us to reconstruct environment-induced, maximally informative, sparse, and casual multilayer genetic networks. We design and conduct two mapping experiments by using a desert-adapted tree species to validate the biological application of the model proposed. The model identifies previously uncharacterized molecular mechanisms that mediate trees’ response to saline stress. Our model provides a tool to comprehend the genetic architecture of trait variation and evolution and trace the information flow of each gene toward phenotypes within omnigenic networks.

Abstract: Summary
Caspase-11 sensing of intracellular lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plays critical roles during infections and sepsis. However, the key cell types that sense intracellular LPS and their contributions to the host responses at the organismal level are not completely clear. Here, we show that macrophage/monocyte-specific caspase-11 plays a dominant role in mediating the pathological manifestations of endotoxemia, including gasdermin D (GSDMD) activation, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-18, and damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) release, tissue damage, and death. Surprisingly, caspase-11 expression in CD11c+ cells and intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) plays minor detrimental roles in LPS shock. In contrast, caspase-11 expression in neutrophils is dispensable for LPS-induced lethality. Importantly, caspase-11 sensing of intracellular LPS in LyzM+ myeloid cells and MRP8+ neutrophils, but not CD11c+ cells and IECs, is necessary for bacterial clearance and host survival during intracellular bacterial infection. Thus, we reveal hierarchical cell-type-specific roles of caspase-11 that govern the host-protective and host-detrimental functions of the cytosolic LPS surveillance.

Abstract: Summary
Serine metabolism promotes tumor oncogenesis and regulates immune cell functions, but whether it also contributes to antiviral innate immunity is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that virus-infected macrophages display decreased expression of serine synthesis pathway (SSP) enzymes. Suppressing the SSP key enzyme phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) by genetic approaches or by treatment with the pharmaceutical inhibitor CBR-5884 and by exogenous serine restriction enhanced IFN-β-mediated antiviral innate immunity in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic experiments showed that virus infection or serine metabolism deficiency increased the expression of the V-ATPase subunit ATP6V0d2 by inhibiting S-adenosyl methionine-dependent H3K27me3 occupancy at the promoter. ATP6V0d2 promoted YAP lysosomal degradation to relieve YAP-mediated blockade of the TBK1-IRF3 axis and, thus, enhance IFN-β production. These findings implicate critical functions of PHGDH and the key immunometabolite serine in blunting antiviral innate immunity and also suggest manipulation of serine metabolism as a therapeutic strategy against virus infection.

Abstract: Background
The roles of transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 1 (TRPV1) and subfamily A, member 1 (TRPA1) in mechanisms of gastrointestinal motility are complex. This study aimed to clarify the effects of several TRPV1 and TRPA1 ligands on the electrical potentials generated by pacemaker cells in the mouse-isolated ileum.
Method
The pacemaker potentials of ileal segments of mice were recorded extracellularly using a 60-channel microelectrode array. The dominant frequencies, average waveform periods and propagation velocities were quantified. The effects of TRPV1 and TRPA1 agonist and antagonist were compared with the baseline recordings.
Results
The electrophysiological recordings showed that capsaicin (30 μM to 3 mM), resiniferatoxin (300 μM), capsazepine (100–300 μM), allyl isothiocyanate (300 μM), isovelleral (300 μM), icilin (300 μM), A-967,079 (10 μM), AP18 (20 μM) and HC-030,031 (50 μM) significantly reduced the pacemaker frequency and increased the waveform period relative to the baseline. Conversely, ruthenium red (300 μM) significantly increased the pacemaker frequency and reduced the waveform period. Capsaicin (3 mM) and AP18 (20 μM) also significantly reduced the propagation velocity. However, all tested antagonists failed to inhibit the effects of agonists. AMG9810 (300 μM), but not A-967,079 (300 μM), significantly inhibited the increases in pacemaker frequency caused by increased temperatures.
Conclusion
Our findings suggest that TRPV1 and TRPA1 play a minor role in regulating pacemaker potentials and that at non-specific actions at other TRP and ion channels most likely contributed to the overall effects on the electrophysiological recordings that we observed.

Abstract: Summary
To fully decipher the immunogenicity of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Spike protein, it is essential to assess which part is highly immunogenic in a systematic way. We generate a linear epitope landscape of the Spike protein by analyzing the serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) response of 1,051 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with a peptide microarray. We reveal two regions rich in linear epitopes, i.e., C-terminal domain (CTD) and a region close to the S2′ cleavage site and fusion peptide. Unexpectedly, we find that the receptor binding domain (RBD) lacks linear epitope. We reveal that the number of responsive peptides is highly variable among patients and correlates with disease severity. Some peptides are moderately associated with severity and clinical outcome. By immunizing mice, we obtain linear-epitope-specific antibodies; however, no significant neutralizing activity against the authentic virus is observed for these antibodies. This landscape will facilitate our understanding of SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral responses and might be useful for vaccine refinement.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear speckles are prominent nuclear bodies that contain proteins and RNA involved in gene expression. Although links between nuclear speckles and gene activation are emerging, the mechanisms regulating association of genes with speckles are unclear. We find that speckle association of p53 target genes is driven by the p53 transcription factor. Focusing on p21, a key p53 target, we demonstrate that speckle association boosts expression by elevating nascent RNA amounts. p53-regulated speckle association did not depend on p53 transactivation functions but required an intact proline-rich domain and direct DNA binding, providing mechanisms within p53 for regulating gene-speckle association. Beyond p21, a substantial subset of p53 targets have p53-regulated speckle association. Strikingly, speckle-associating p53 targets are more robustly activated and occupy a distinct niche of p53 biology compared with non-speckle-associating p53 targets. Together, our findings illuminate regulated speckle association as a mechanism used by a transcription factor to boost gene expression.

Abstract: The principal purpose of tissue engineering is to stimulate the injured or unhealthy tissues to revive their primary function through the simultaneous use of chemical agents, cells, and biocompatible materials. Still, choosing the appropriate protein as a growth factor (GF) for tissue engineering is vital to fabricate artificial tissues and accelerate the regeneration procedure. In this study, the angiogenesis and osteogenesis-related proteins’ interactions are studied using their related network. Three major biological processes, including osteogenesis, angiogenesis, and angiogenesis regulation, were investigated by creating a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network (45 nodes and 237 edges) of bone regeneration efficient proteins. Furthermore, a gene ontology and a centrality analysis were performed to identify essential proteins within a network. The higher degree in this network leads to higher interactions between proteins and causes a considerable effect. The most highly connected proteins in the PPI network are the most remarkable for their employment. The results of this study showed that three significant proteins including prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), TEK receptor tyrosine kinase (TEK), and fibroblast growth factor 18 (FGF18) were involved simultaneously in osteogenesis, angiogenesis, and their positive regulatory. Regarding the available literature, the results of this study confirmed that PTGS2 and FGF18 could be used as a GF in bone tissue engineering (BTE) applications to promote angiogenesis and osteogenesis. Nevertheless, TEK was not used in BTE applications until now and should be considered in future works to be examined in-vitro and in-vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Myeloid lineage cells use TLRs to recognize and respond to diverse microbial ligands. Although unique transcription factors dictate the outcome of specific TLR signaling, whether lineage-specific differences exist to further modulate the quality of TLR-induced inflammation remains unclear. Comprehensive analysis of global gene transcription in human monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages, and monocyte-derived dendritic cells stimulated with various TLR ligands identifies multiple lineage-specific, TLR-responsive gene programs. Monocytes are hyperresponsive to TLR7/8 stimulation that correlates with the higher expression of the receptors. While macrophages and monocytes express similar levels of TLR4, macrophages, but not monocytes, upregulate interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in response to TLR4 stimulation. We find that TLR4 signaling in macrophages uniquely engages transcription factor IRF1, which facilitates the opening of ISG loci for transcription. This study provides a critical mechanistic basis for lineage-specific TLR responses and uncovers IRF1 as a master regulator for the ISG transcriptional program in human macrophages.

Abstract: Summary
Type I interferons (IFNs) induce hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in response to viral infection. Induction of these ISGs must be regulated for an efficient and controlled antiviral response, but post-transcriptional controls of these genes have not been well defined. Here, we identify a role for the RNA base modification N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in the regulation of ISGs. Using ribosome profiling and quantitative mass spectrometry, coupled with m6A-immunoprecipitation and sequencing, we identify a subset of ISGs, including IFITM1, whose translation is enhanced by m6A and the m6A methyltransferase proteins METTL3 and METTL14. We further determine that the m6A reader YTHDF1 increases the expression of IFITM1 in an m6A-binding-dependent manner. Importantly, we find that the m6A methyltransferase complex promotes the antiviral activity of type I IFN. Thus, these studies identify m6A as having a role in post-transcriptional control of ISG translation during the type I IFN response for antiviral restriction.

Abstract: Summary
Neutrophils with immunoregulatory properties, also referred to as type-2 neutrophils (N2), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), or tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs), comprise a heterogeneous subset of cells that arise from unknown precursors in response to poorly understood cues. Here, we find that, in several models of liver autoimmunity, pharmacologically induced, autoantigen-specific T regulatory type-1 (TR1) cells and TR1-cell-induced B regulatory (Breg) cells use five immunoregulatory cytokines to coordinately recruit neutrophils into the liver and program their transcriptome to generate regulatory neutrophils. The liver-associated neutrophils from the treated mice, unlike their circulating counterparts or the liver neutrophils of sick mice lacking antigen-specific TR1 cells, are proliferative, can transfer disease protection to immunocompromised hosts engrafted with pathogenic effectors, and blunt antigen-presentation and local autoimmune responses via cathelin-related anti-microbial peptide (CRAMP), a cathelicidin, in a CRAMP-receptor-dependent manner. These results, thus, identify antigen-specific regulatory T cells as drivers of tissue-restricted regulatory neutrophil formation and CRAMP as an effector of regulatory neutrophil-mediated immunoregulation.

Abstract: Summary
Glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) resist current glioblastoma (GBM) therapies. GSCs rely highly on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), whose function requires mitochondrial translation. Here we explore the therapeutic potential of targeting mitochondrial translation and report the results of high-content screening with putative blockers of mitochondrial ribosomes. We identify the bacterial antibiotic quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D) as an effective suppressor of GSC growth. Q/D also decreases the clonogenicity of GSCs in vitro, consequently dysregulating the cell cycle and inducing apoptosis. Cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) reveals that Q/D binds to the large mitoribosomal subunit, inhibiting mitochondrial protein synthesis and functionally dysregulating OXPHOS complexes. These data suggest that targeting mitochondrial translation could be explored to therapeutically suppress GSC growth in GBM and that Q/D could potentially be repurposed for cancer treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe neurological disorder, with impaired brain development caused by mutations in MECP2; however, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. We know from previous work that MeCP2 facilitates the processing of a specific microRNA, miR-199a, by associating with the Drosha complex to regulate neuronal functions. Here, we show that the MeCP2/miR-199a axis regulates neural stem/precursor cell (NS/PC) differentiation. A shift occurs from neuronal to astrocytic differentiation of MeCP2- and miR-199a-deficient NS/PCs due to the upregulation of a miR-199a target, Smad1, a downstream transcription factor of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. Moreover, miR-199a expression and treatment with BMP inhibitors rectify the differentiation of RTT patient-derived NS/PCs and development of brain organoids, respectively, suggesting that facilitation of BMP signaling accounts for the impaired RTT brain development. Our study illuminates the molecular pathology of RTT and reveals the MeCP2/miR-199a/Smad1 axis as a potential therapeutic target for RTT.

Abstract: Summary
Exposure to prolonged stress in critical developmental periods induces heightened vulnerability to psychiatric disorders, which may have sex-specific consequences. Here we investigate the neuronal circuits mediating behavioral changes in mice after chronic adolescent social isolation stress. Escalated aggression is exhibited in stressed males, while social withdrawal is shown in stressed females. In vivo multichannel recordings of free-moving animals indicate that pyramidal neurons in prefrontal cortex (PFC) from stressed males exhibit the significantly decreased spike activity during aggressive attacks, while PFC pyramidal neurons from stressed females show a blunted increase of discharge rates during sociability tests. Chemogenetic and electrophysiological evidence shows that PFC hypofunctioning and BLA principal neuron hyperactivity contribute to the elevated aggression in stressed males, while PFC hypofunctioning and VTA dopamine neuron hypoactivity contribute to the diminished sociability in stressed females. These results establish a framework for understanding the circuit and physiological mechanisms underlying sex-specific divergent effects of stress.

Abstract: Summary
Across the animal kingdom, adult tissue homeostasis is regulated by adult stem cell activity, which is commonly dysregulated in human cancers. However, identifying key regulators of stem cells in the milieu of thousands of genes dysregulated in a given cancer is challenging. Here, using a comparative genomics approach between planarian adult stem cells and patient-derived glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), we identify and demonstrate the role of DEAD-box helicase DDX56 in regulating aspects of stemness in four stem cell systems: planarians, mouse neural stem cells, human GSCs, and a fly model of glioblastoma. In a human GSC line, DDX56 localizes to the nucleolus, and using planarians, when DDX56 is lost, stem cells dysregulate expression of ribosomal RNAs and lose nucleolar integrity prior to stem cell death. Together, a comparative genomic approach can be used to uncover conserved stemness regulators that are functional in both normal and cancer stem cells.

Abstract: Isolation of high-quality human postnatal stem cells from accessible sources is an important goal for dental tissue engineering. Stem cells from developing organs are a better cell source but are hard to obtain. With extensive caries that are difficult to restore, the extracted deciduous tooth with an immature apex is a developing organ for investigation. In the present study, a cell population from the tip of apical pulp of human deciduous teeth with an immature apex was isolated and termed apical pulp-derived cells of deciduous teeth (De-APDCs). De-APDCs expressed STRO-1, CD44, CD90 and CD105 but not CD34 or CD45. Furthermore, De-APDCs demonstrated a significantly higher clonogenic and proliferative ability and osteo/dentinogenic differentiation capacity than dental pulp cells from exfoliated deciduous teeth (De-DPCs) (P < 0.05). Differentiation potential toward adipogenic, neurogenic and chondrogenic lineages was also observed in induced De-APDCs. In addition, after De-APDCs were seeded into hydroxyapatite/tricalcium phosphate (HA/TCP) scaffolds and transplanted into nude mice, they were able to regenerate dentin/pulp-like structures aligned with human odontoblast-like cells. In conclusion, De-APDCs, which are derived from a developing tissue, represent an accessible and prospective cell source for tooth regeneration.

Abstract: Objective
To investigate whether miR-105 can regulate the osteogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADSCs) by targeting SOX9.
Methods
The hADSCs were grouped for subsequent transfection and induction of osteogenic differentiation as follows: control, miR-NC, miR-105 mimics, miR-105 inhibitors, SOX9, SOX9 siRNA, miR-105 mimics + SOX9 and miR-105 inhibitors + SOX9 siRNA groups. Next, hADSCs were stained for alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and Alizarin Red S staining (ARS) was performed. Osteogenic differentiation-related genes and miR-105 expression were assessed by qRT-PCR, while SOX9 protein expression was determined by Western blotting.
Results
MiR-105 expression was increased and SOX9 protein expression was decreased during the osteogenic differentiation of hADSCs. A dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed SOX9 to be a target gene of miR-105. Compared with the control group, the miR-105 mimics and SOX9 siRNA groups had elevated BMP2, OPN, OCN, BSP, Osx and Runx2 mRNA expression with reduced SOX9 expression, as well as increased ARS intensity and ALP activity. After transfection of miR-105 inhibitors/SOX9 into hADSCs, the results were the opposite. Overexpressing SOX9 reversed the effect of miR-105 in promoting the osteogenic differentiation of hADSCs.
Conclusion
MiR-105 could target SOX9 to improve the expression of osteogenic differentiation genes and thus enhance the osteogenic differentiation of hADSCs.

Abstract: Summary
The Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is an essential epigenetic regulator that deposits repressive H3K27me3. PRC2 subunits form two holocomplexes—PRC2.1 and PRC2.2—but the roles of these two PRC2 assemblies during differentiation are unclear. We employed auxin-inducible degradation to deplete PRC2.1 subunit MTF2 or PRC2.2 subunit JARID2 during differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to neural progenitors (NPCs). Depletion of either MTF2 or JARID2 resulted in incomplete differentiation due to defects in gene regulation. Distinct sets of Polycomb target genes were derepressed in the absence of MTF2 or JARID2. MTF2-sensitive genes were marked by H3K27me3 in ESCs and remained silent during differentiation, whereas JARID2-sensitive genes were preferentially active in ESCs and became newly repressed in NPCs. Thus, MTF2 and JARID2 contribute non-redundantly to Polycomb silencing, suggesting that PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 have distinct functions in maintaining and establishing, respectively, Polycomb repression during differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Proper chromosome segregation into two future daughter cells requires the mitotic spindle to elongate in anaphase. However, although some candidate proteins are implicated in this process, the molecular mechanism that drives spindle elongation in human cells is unknown. Using combined depletion and inactivation assays together with CRISPR technology to explore redundancy between multiple targets, we discovered that the force-generating mechanism of spindle elongation consists of EG5/kinesin-5 together with the PRC1-dependent motor KIF4A/kinesin-4, with contribution from kinesin-6 and kinesin-8. Disruption of EG5 and KIF4A leads to total failure of chromosome segregation due to blocked spindle elongation, despite poleward chromosome motion. Tubulin photoactivation, stimulated emission depletion (STED), and expansion microscopy show that perturbation of both proteins impairs midzone microtubule sliding without affecting microtubule stability. Thus, two mechanistically distinct sliding modules, one based on a self-sustained and the other on a crosslinker-assisted motor, power the mechanism that drives spindle elongation in human cells.

Abstract: Summary
Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDK1–4) inhibit the TCA cycle by phosphorylating pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). Here, we show that PDK family is dispensable for murine embryonic development and that BCKDK serves as a compensatory mechanism by inactivating PDC. First, we knocked out all four Pdk genes one by one. Surprisingly, Pdk total KO embryos developed and were born in expected ratios but died by postnatal day 4 because of hypoglycemia or ketoacidosis. Moreover, PDC was phosphorylated in these embryos, suggesting that another kinase compensates for PDK family. Bioinformatic analysis implicated branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase (Bckdk), a key regulator of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) catabolism. Indeed, knockout of Bckdk and Pdk family led to the loss of PDC phosphorylation, an increase in PDC activity and pyruvate entry into the TCA cycle, and embryonic lethality. These findings reveal a regulatory crosstalk hardwiring BCAA and glucose catabolic pathways, which feed the TCA cycle.

Abstract: Summary
Dopaminergic projections exert widespread influence over multiple brain regions and modulate various behaviors including movement, reward learning, and motivation. It is increasingly appreciated that dopamine neurons are heterogeneous in their gene expression, circuitry, physiology, and function. Current approaches to target dopamine neurons are largely based on single gene drivers, which either label all dopamine neurons or mark a subset but concurrently label non-dopaminergic neurons. Here, we establish a mouse line with Flpo recombinase expressed from the endogenous Slc6a3 (dopamine active transporter [DAT]) locus. DAT-P2A-Flpo mice can be used together with Cre-expressing mouse lines to efficiently and selectively label dopaminergic subpopulations using Cre/Flp-dependent intersectional strategies. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by generating DAT-P2A-Flpo;NEX-Cre mice that specifically label Neurod6-expressing dopamine neurons, which project to the nucleus accumbens medial shell. DAT-P2A-Flpo mice add to a growing toolbox of genetic resources that will help parse the diverse functions mediated by dopaminergic circuits.

Abstract: Summary
Impairment of the p53 pathway is a critical event in cancer. Therefore, reestablishing p53 activity has become one of the most appealing anticancer therapeutic strategies. Here, we disclose the p53-activating anticancer drug (3S)-6,7-bis(hydroxymethyl)-5-methyl-3-phenyl-1H,3H-pyrrolo[1,2-c]thiazole (MANIO). MANIO demonstrates a notable selectivity to the p53 pathway, activating wild-type (WT)p53 and restoring WT-like function to mutant (mut)p53 in human cancer cells. MANIO directly binds to the WT/mutp53 DNA-binding domain, enhancing the protein thermal stability, DNA-binding ability, and transcriptional activity. The high efficacy of MANIO as an anticancer agent toward cancers harboring WT/mutp53 is further demonstrated in patient-derived cells and xenograft mouse models of colorectal cancer (CRC), with no signs of undesirable side effects. MANIO synergizes with conventional chemotherapeutic drugs, and in vitro and in vivo studies predict its adequate drug-likeness and pharmacokinetic properties for a clinical candidate. As a single agent or in combination, MANIO will advance anticancer-targeted therapy, particularly benefiting CRC patients harboring distinct p53 status.

Abstract: Summary
Sex differences in multiple sclerosis (MS) incidence and severity have long been recognized. However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms for why male sex is associated with more aggressive disease remain poorly defined. Using a T cell adoptive transfer model of chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), we find that male Th17 cells induce disease of increased severity relative to female Th17 cells, irrespective of whether transferred to male or female recipients. Throughout the disease course, a greater frequency of male Th17 cells produce IFNγ, a hallmark of pathogenic Th17 responses. Intriguingly, XY chromosomal complement increases the pathogenicity of male Th17 cells. An X-linked immune regulator, Jarid1c, is downregulated in pathogenic male murine Th17 cells, and functional experiments reveal that it represses the severity of Th17-mediated EAE. Furthermore, Jarid1c expression is downregulated in CD4+ T cells from MS-affected individuals. Our data indicate that male sex chromosomal complement critically regulates Th17 cell pathogenicity.

Abstract: Summary
The Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) complex detects and processes DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Its DNA binding and processing activities are regulated by transitions between an ATP-bound state and a post-hydrolysis cutting state that is nucleolytically active. Mre11 endonuclease activity is stimulated by Sae2, whose lack increases MRX persistence at DSBs and checkpoint activation. Here we show that the Rif2 protein inhibits Mre11 endonuclease activity and is responsible for the increased MRX retention at DSBs in sae2Δ cells. We identify a Rad50 residue that is important for Rad50-Rif2 interaction and Rif2 inhibition of Mre11 nuclease. This residue is located near a Rad50 surface that binds Sae2 and is important in stabilizing the Mre11-Rad50 (MR) interaction in the cutting state. We propose that Sae2 stimulates Mre11 endonuclease activity by stabilizing a post-hydrolysis MR conformation that is competent for DNA cleavage, whereas Rif2 antagonizes this Sae2 function and stabilizes an endonuclease inactive MR conformation.

Abstract: Summary
The bone-marrow (BM) niche is the spatial environment composed by a network of multiple stromal components regulating adult hematopoiesis. We use multi-omics and computational tools to analyze multiple BM environmental compartments and decipher their mutual interactions in the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) xenografts. Under homeostatic conditions, we find a considerable overlap between niche populations identified using current markers. Our analysis defines eight functional clusters of genes informing on the cellular identity and function of the different subpopulations and pointing at specific stromal interrelationships. We describe how these transcriptomic profiles change during human AML development and, by using a proximity-based molecular approach, we identify early disease onset deregulated genes in the mesenchymal compartment. Finally, we analyze the BM proteomic secretome in the presence of AML and integrate it with the transcriptome to predict signaling nodes involved in niche alteration in AML.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer immunotherapy focuses on inhibitors of checkpoint proteins, such as programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Unlike RAS-mutated lung cancers, EGFR mutant tumors have a generally low response to immunotherapy. Because treatment outcomes vary by EGFR allele, intrinsic and microenvironmental factors may be involved. Among all non-immunological signaling pathways surveyed in patients’ datasets, EGFR signaling is best associated with high PD-L1. Correspondingly, active EGFRs stabilize PD-L1 transcripts and depletion of PD-L1 severely inhibits EGFR-driven tumorigenicity and metastasis in mice. The underlying mechanisms involve the recruitment of phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1) to a cytoplasmic motif of PD-L1, which enhances PLC-γ1 activation by EGFR. Once stimulated, PLC-γ1 activates calcium flux, Rho GTPases, and protein kinase C, collectively promoting an aggressive phenotype. Anti-PD-L1 antibodies can inhibit these intrinsic functions of PD-L1. Our results portray PD-L1 as a molecular amplifier of EGFR signaling and improve the understanding of the resistance of EGFR+ tumors to immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Hotspot mutation of IKZF3 (IKZF3-L162R) has been identified as a putative driver of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), but its function remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate its driving role in CLL through a B cell-restricted conditional knockin mouse model. Mutant Ikzf3 alters DNA binding specificity and target selection, leading to hyperactivation of B cell receptor (BCR) signaling, overexpression of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) target genes, and development of CLL-like disease in elderly mice with a penetrance of ~40%. Human CLL carrying either IKZF3 mutation or high IKZF3 expression was associated with overexpression of BCR/NF-κB pathway members and reduced sensitivity to BCR signaling inhibition by ibrutinib. Our results thus highlight IKZF3 oncogenic function in CLL via transcriptional dysregulation and demonstrate that this pro-survival function can be achieved by either somatic mutation or overexpression of this CLL driver. This emphasizes the need for combinatorial approaches to overcome IKZF3-mediated BCR inhibitor resistance.

Abstract: In eukaryotic cells, organelles are distributed and positioned in proximity to each other through molecular tether proteins. Among these, the mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum cortex anchor (MECA) is a well-known tethering complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that tethers mitochondria to the plasma membrane and plays a key role in mitochondrial fission. The main components of MECA are Num1 and Mdm36, and it is known that Mdm36 binds to Num1 to enhance mitochondrial tethering. To better understand the biochemical characteristics of the Num1-Mdm36 complex at the molecular level, we purified the coiled-coil domain of Num1, full-length Mdm36, and Num1-Mdm36 complex and identified the oligomeric state and stoichiometric characteristics of the Num1-Mdm36 complex by chemical crosslinking, size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multi-angle light scattering, and isothermal titration calorimetry. Mdm36 exists as a dimer and interacts preferentially with Num1 with a stoichiometry of 2:2, forming a heterotetrameric complex. Furthermore, we narrowed down the specific binding region of Num1, which is essential for interacting with Mdm36, and showed that their binding affinity is strong enough to tether both mitochondrial and plasma membranes. Our biochemical characterizations suggest a stoichiometric model of the Num1-Mdm36 complex at the mitochondria-plasma membrane contact site in budding yeast.

Abstract: Summary
Receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) mediates cell death and inflammatory signaling and is increased in multiple sclerosis (MS) brain samples. Here, we investigate the role of glial RIPK1 kinase activity in mediating MS pathogenesis. We demonstrate RIPK1 levels correlate with MS disease progression. We find microglia are susceptible to RIPK1-mediated cell death and identify an inflammatory gene signature that may contribute to the neuroinflammatory milieu in MS patients. We uncover a distinct role for RIPK1 in astrocytes in regulating inflammatory signaling in the absence of cell death and confirm RIPK1-kinase-dependent regulation in human glia. Using a murine MS model, we show RIPK1 inhibition attenuates disease progression and suppresses deleterious signaling in astrocytes and microglia. Our results suggest RIPK1 kinase activation in microglia and astrocytes induces a detrimental neuroinflammatory program that contributes to the neurodegenerative environment in progressive MS.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the mechanisms underlying how T cells become dysfunctional in a tumor microenvironment (TME) will greatly benefit cancer immunotherapy. We found that increased CD36 expression in tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells, which was induced by TME cholesterol, was associated with tumor progression and poor survival in human and murine cancers. Genetic ablation of Cd36 in effector CD8+ T cells exhibited increased cytotoxic cytokine production and enhanced tumor eradication. CD36 mediated uptake of fatty acids by tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in TME, induced lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis, and led to reduced cytotoxic cytokine production and impaired antitumor ability. Blocking CD36 or inhibiting ferroptosis in CD8+ T cells effectively restored their antitumor activity and, more importantly, possessed greater antitumor efficacy in combination with anti-PD-1 antibodies. This study reveals a new mechanism of CD36 regulating the function of CD8+ effector T cells and therapeutic potential of targeting CD36 or inhibiting ferroptosis to restore T cell function.

Abstract: Summary
The β-barrel assembly machine (BAM) integrates β-barrel proteins into the outer membrane (OM) of Gram-negative bacteria. An essential BAM subunit (BamA) catalyzes integration by promoting the formation of a hybrid-barrel intermediate state between its own β-barrel domain and that of its client proteins. Here we show that in addition to catalyzing the integration of β-barrel proteins, BamA functions as a polypeptide export channel. In vivo structural mapping via intermolecular disulfide crosslinking showed that the extracellular “passenger” domain of a member of the “autotransporter” superfamily of virulence factors traverses the OM through the BamA β-barrel lumen. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a highly conserved residue within autotransporter β-barrels is required to position the passenger inside BamA to initiate translocation and that during translocation, the passenger stabilizes the hybrid-barrel state. Our results not only establish a new function for BamA but also unify the divergent functions of BamA and other “Omp85” superfamily transporters.

Abstract: Summary
Bacterial small RNAs (sRNAs) regulate the expression of hundreds of transcripts via base pairing mediated by the Hfq chaperone protein. sRNAs and the mRNA sites they target are heterogeneous in sequence, length, and secondary structure. To understand how Hfq can flexibly match diverse sRNA and mRNA pairs, we developed a single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) platform that visualizes the target search on timescales relevant in cells. Here we show that unfolding of target secondary structure on Hfq creates a kinetic energy barrier that determines whether target recognition succeeds or aborts before a stable anti-sense complex is achieved. Premature dissociation of the sRNA can be alleviated by strong RNA-Hfq interactions, explaining why sRNAs have different target recognition profiles. We propose that the diverse sequences and structures of Hfq substrates create an additional layer of information that tunes the efficiency and selectivity of non-coding RNA regulation in bacteria.

Extensive remodeling of the airways is a major characteristic of chronic inflammatory lung diseases such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). To elucidate the importance of a deregulated immune response in the airways for remodeling processes, we established a matching Drosophila model. Here, triggering the Imd (immune deficiency) pathway in tracheal cells induced organ-wide remodeling. This structural remodeling comprises disorganization of epithelial structures and comprehensive epithelial thickening. We show that these structural changes do not depend on the Imd pathway’s canonical branch terminating on nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation. Instead, activation of a different segment of the Imd pathway that branches off downstream of Tak1 and comprises activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and forkhead transcription factor of the O subgroup (FoxO) signaling is necessary and sufficient to mediate the observed structural changes of the airways. Our findings imply that targeting JNK and FoxO signaling in the airways could be a promising strategy to interfere with disease-associated airway remodeling processes.

Abstract: Summary
The sequestration of damaged mitochondria within double-membrane structures termed autophagosomes is a key step of PINK1/Parkin mitophagy. The ATG4 family of proteases are thought to regulate autophagosome formation exclusively by processing the ubiquitin-like ATG8 family (LC3/GABARAPs). We discover that human ATG4s promote autophagosome formation independently of their protease activity and of ATG8 family processing. ATG4 proximity networks reveal a role for ATG4s and their proximity partners, including the immune-disease protein LRBA, in ATG9A vesicle trafficking to mitochondria. Artificial intelligence-directed 3D electron microscopy of phagophores shows that ATG4s promote phagophore-ER contacts during the lipid-transfer phase of autophagosome formation. We also show that ATG8 removal during autophagosome maturation does not depend on ATG4 activity. Instead, ATG4s can disassemble ATG8-protein conjugates, revealing a role for ATG4s as deubiquitinating-like enzymes. These findings establish non-canonical roles of the ATG4 family beyond the ATG8 lipidation axis and provide an AI-driven framework for rapid 3D electron microscopy.

Abstract: Summary
DNA polymerase ε (Polε) carries out high-fidelity leading strand synthesis owing to its exonuclease activity. Polε polymerase and exonuclease activities are balanced, because of partitioning of nascent DNA strands between catalytic sites, so that net resection occurs when synthesis is impaired. In vivo, DNA synthesis stalling activates replication checkpoint kinases, which act to preserve the functional integrity of replication forks. We show that stalled Polε drives nascent strand resection causing fork functional collapse, averted via checkpoint-dependent phosphorylation. Polε catalytic subunit Pol2 is phosphorylated on serine 430, influencing partitioning between polymerase and exonuclease active sites. A phosphormimetic S430D change reduces exonucleolysis in vitro and counteracts fork collapse. Conversely, non-phosphorylatable pol2-S430A expression causes resection-driven stressed fork defects. Our findings reveal that checkpoint kinases switch Polε to an exonuclease-safe mode preventing nascent strand resection and stabilizing stalled replication forks. Elective partitioning suppression has implications for the diverse Polε roles in genome integrity maintenance.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer cells adapt their metabolism to support elevated energetic and anabolic demands of proliferation. Folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism is a critical metabolic process underpinning cellular proliferation supplying carbons for the synthesis of nucleotides incorporated into DNA and RNA. Recent research has focused on the nutrients that supply one-carbons to the folate cycle, particularly serine. Tryptophan is a theoretical source of one-carbon units through metabolism by IDO1, an enzyme intensively investigated in the context of tumor immune evasion. Using in vitro and in vivo pancreatic cancer models, we show that IDO1 expression is highly context dependent, influenced by attachment-independent growth and the canonical activator IFNγ. In IDO1-expressing cancer cells, tryptophan is a bona fide one-carbon donor for purine nucleotide synthesis in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we show that cancer cells release tryptophan-derived formate, which can be used by pancreatic stellate cells to support purine nucleotide synthesis.

Abstract: Summary
DNA-induced liquid-liquid phase separation of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) triggers a potent response to detect pathogen infection and promote innate immune signaling. Whether and how pathogens manipulate cGAS-DNA condensation to mediate immune evasion is unknown. We report the identification of a structurally related viral tegument protein family, represented by ORF52 and VP22 from gamma- and alpha-herpesvirinae, respectively, that employs a conserved mechanism to restrict cGAS-DNA phase separation. ORF52/VP22 proteins accumulate into, and effectively disrupt, the pre-formed cGAS-DNA condensation both in vitro and in cells. The inhibition process is dependent on DNA-induced liquid-liquid phase separation of the viral protein rather than a direct interaction with cGAS. Moreover, highly abundant ORF52 proteins carried within viral particles are able to target cGAS-DNA phase separation in early infection stage. Our results define ORF52/VP22-type tegument proteins as a family of inhibitors targeting cGAS-DNA phase separation and demonstrate a mechanism for how viruses overcome innate immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Recent studies have demonstrated that selective activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) in the cerebellum by deletion of the mTORC1 upstream repressors TSC1 or phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in Purkinje cells (PCs) causes autism-like features and cognitive deficits. However, the molecular mechanisms by which overactivated mTORC1 in the cerebellum engenders these behaviors remain unknown. The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 2 (4E-BP2) is a central translational repressor downstream of mTORC1. Here, we show that mice with selective ablation of 4E-BP2 in PCs display a reduced number of PCs, increased regularity of PC action potential firing, and deficits in motor learning. Surprisingly, although spatial memory is impaired in these mice, they exhibit normal social interaction and show no deficits in repetitive behavior. Our data suggest that, downstream of mTORC1/4E-BP2, there are distinct cerebellar mechanisms independently controlling social behavior and memory formation.

Abstract: Summary
Prdm12 is a key transcription factor in nociceptor neurogenesis. Mutations of Prdm12 cause congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP) from failure of nociceptor development. However, precisely how deletion of Prdm12 during development or adulthood affects nociception is unknown. Here, we employ tissue- and temporal-specific knockout mouse models to test the function of Prdm12 during development and in adulthood. We find that constitutive loss of Prdm12 causes deficiencies in proliferation during sensory neurogenesis. We also demonstrate that conditional knockout from dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) during embryogenesis causes defects in nociception. In contrast, we find that, in adult DRGs, Prdm12 is dispensable for most pain-sensation and injury-induced hypersensitivity. Using transcriptomic analysis, we find mostly unique changes in adult Prdm12 knockout DRGs compared with embryonic knockout and that PRDM12 is likely a transcriptional activator in the adult. Overall, we find that the function of PRDM12 changes over developmental time.

Abstract: Summary
Spinal cord injury (SCI) often results in spasticity. There is currently no effective therapy for spasticity. Here, we describe a method to efficiently differentiate human pluripotent stem cells from spinal GABA neurons. After transplantation into the injured rat spinal cord, the DREADD (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drug)-expressing spinal progenitors differentiate into GABA neurons, mitigating spasticity-like response of the rat hindlimbs and locomotion deficits in 3 months. Administering clozapine-N-oxide, which activates the grafted GABA neurons, further alleviates spasticity-like response, suggesting an integration of grafted GABA neurons into the local neural circuit. These results highlight the therapeutic potential of the spinal GABA neurons for SCI.

Abstract: Summary
Cell types are the basic building units of multicellular life, with extensive diversities. The evolution of cell types is a crucial layer of comparative cell biology but is thus far not comprehensively studied. We define a compendium of cell atlases using single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data from seven animal species and construct a cross-species cell-type evolutionary hierarchy. We present a roadmap for the origin and diversity of major cell categories and find that muscle and neuron cells are conserved cell types. Furthermore, we identify a cross-species transcription factor (TF) repertoire that specifies major cell categories. Overall, our study reveals conservation and divergence of cell types during animal evolution, which will further expand the landscape of comparative genomics.

Abstract: Acute stress is a feature of our daily events that affects cardiovascular system and predisposes to hypertension. H2S is now considered as a vasorelaxant gasotransmitter although it was considered as a toxic agent. In present work we studied the effect of H2S releasing Na2S in acute stress induced hypertension and cardiac damage. Rats were divided into five groups: control, Na2S, acute stress, half dose of Na2S (6  mg/kg), and finally full dose of Na2S (12  mg/kg) to acute stressed rats. BP was measured then blood samples were taken for estimation of cortisol, cardiac enzymes markers, IL-6 and H2S. Finally, animals were sacrificed, hearts and thoracic aortae were excised for histological assessment, estimation of MDA, SOD and RNA extraction of CSE. Acute stress significantly elevated BP, cortisol, cardiac enzymes markers, IL-6, and tissue levels of MDA. It also, induced cardiac cell damage with congested B.V., extravasation of blood and decreased eNOs. Moreover, acute stress reduced H2S levels, RNA expression of CSE and SOD in cardiac tissues. Na2S significantly decreased BP, serum levels of cortisol, cardiac enzymes markers, IL-6, and tissue levels of MDA. Also, Na2S elevated serum H2S, RNA expression of CSE, SOD in cardiac tissue and increased eNOs activity.

Abstract: Summary
How amphipathic phospholipids are shuttled between the membrane bilayer remains an essential but elusive process, particularly at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). One prominent phospholipid shuttling process concerns the biogenesis of APOB-containing lipoproteins within the ER lumen, which may require bulk trans-bilayer movement of phospholipids from the cytoplasmic leaflet of the ER bilayer. Here, we show that TMEM41B, present in the lipoprotein export machinery, encodes a previously conceptualized ER lipid scramblase mediating trans-bilayer shuttling of bulk phospholipids. Loss of hepatic TMEM41B eliminates plasma lipids, due to complete absence of mature lipoproteins within the ER, but paradoxically also activates lipid production. Mechanistically, scramblase deficiency triggers unique ER morphological changes and unsuppressed activation of SREBPs, which potently promotes lipid synthesis despite stalled secretion. Together, this response induces full-blown nonalcoholic hepatosteatosis in the TMEM41B-deficient mice within weeks. Collectively, our data uncovered a fundamental mechanism safe-guarding ER function and integrity, dysfunction of which disrupts lipid homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
The 3′ untranslated regions (3′ UTRs) of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are non-coding sequences involved in many aspects of mRNA metabolism, including intracellular localization and translation. Incorrect processing and delivery of mRNA cause severe developmental defects and have been implicated in many neurological disorders. Here, we use deep sequencing to show that in sympathetic neuron axons, the 3′ UTRs of many transcripts undergo cleavage, generating isoforms that express the coding sequence with a short 3′ UTR and stable 3′ UTR-derived fragments of unknown function. Cleavage of the long 3′ UTR of Inositol Monophosphatase 1 (IMPA1) mediated by a protein complex containing the endonuclease argonaute 2 (Ago2) generates a translatable isoform that is necessary for maintaining the integrity of sympathetic neuron axons. Thus, our study provides a mechanism of mRNA metabolism that simultaneously regulates local protein synthesis and generates an additional class of 3′ UTR-derived RNAs.

Abstract: Summary
The huntingtin (HTT) protein transports various organelles, including vesicles containing neurotrophic factors, from embryonic development throughout life. To better understand how HTT mediates axonal transport and why this function is disrupted in Huntington’s disease (HD), we study vesicle-associated HTT and find that it is dimethylated at a highly conserved arginine residue (R118) by the protein arginine methyltransferase 6 (PRMT6). Without R118 methylation, HTT associates less with vesicles, anterograde trafficking is diminished, and neuronal death ensues—very similar to what occurs in HD. Inhibiting PRMT6 in HD cells and neurons exacerbates mutant HTT (mHTT) toxicity and impairs axonal trafficking, whereas overexpressing PRMT6 restores axonal transport and neuronal viability, except in the presence of a methylation-defective variant of mHTT. In HD flies, overexpressing PRMT6 rescues axonal defects and eclosion. Arginine methylation thus regulates HTT-mediated vesicular transport along the axon, and increasing HTT methylation could be of therapeutic interest for HD.

Abstract: Summary
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the most common progressive neurological disorder compromising motor functions. However, nonmotor symptoms, such as gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction, precede those affecting movement. Evidence of an early involvement of the GI tract and enteric nervous system highlights the need for better understanding of the role of gut microbiota in GI complications in PD. Here, we investigate the gut microbiome of patients with PD using metagenomics and serum metabolomics. We integrate these data using metabolic modeling and construct an integrative correlation network giving insight into key microbial species linked with disease severity, GI dysfunction, and age of patients with PD. Functional analysis reveals an increased microbial capability to degrade mucin and host glycans in PD. Personalized community-level metabolic modeling reveals the microbial contribution to folate deficiency and hyperhomocysteinemia observed in patients with PD. The metabolic modeling approach could be applied to uncover gut microbial metabolic contributions to PD pathophysiology.

Abstract: Summary
Antibody repertoire sequencing enables researchers to acquire millions of B cell receptors and investigate these molecules at the single-nucleotide level. This power and resolution in studying humoral responses have led to its wide applications. However, most of these studies were conducted with a limited number of samples. Given the extraordinary diversity, assessment of these key features with a large sample set is demanded. Thus, we collect and systematically analyze 2,152 high-quality heavy-chain antibody repertoires. Our study reveals that 52 core variable genes universally contribute to more than 99% of each individual’s repertoire; a distal interspersed preferences characterize V gene recombination; the number of public clones between two repertoires follows a linear model, and the positive selection dominates at RGYW motif in somatic hypermutations. Thus, this population-level analysis resolves some critical features of the antibody repertoire and may have significant value to the large cadre of scientists.

Abstract: Summary
Single-cell assays have revealed the importance of heterogeneity in many biological systems. However, limited sensitivity is a major hurdle for uncovering cellular variation. To overcome it, we developed CloneSeq, combining clonal expansion inside 3D hydrogel spheres and droplet-based RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). We show that clonal cells maintain similar transcriptional profiles and cell states. CloneSeq of lung cancer cells revealed cancer-specific subpopulations, including cancer stem-like cells, that were not revealed by scRNA-seq. Clonal expansion within 3D soft microenvironments supported cellular stemness of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) even without pluripotent media, and it improved epigenetic reprogramming efficiency of mouse embryonic fibroblasts. CloneSeq of ESCs revealed that the differentiation decision is made early during Oct4 downregulation and is maintained during early clonal expansion. Together, we show CloneSeq can be adapted to different biological systems to discover rare subpopulations by leveraging the enhanced sensitivity within clones.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin remodelers often show broad expression patterns in multiple cell types yet can elicit cell-specific effects in development and diseases. Arid1a binds DNA and regulates gene expression during tissue development and homeostasis. However, it is unclear how Arid1a achieves its functional specificity in regulating progenitor cells. Using the tooth root as a model, we show that loss of Arid1a impairs the differentiation-associated cell cycle arrest of tooth root progenitors through Hedgehog (Hh) signaling regulation, leading to shortened roots. Our data suggest that Plagl1, as a co-factor, endows Arid1a with its cell-type/spatial functional specificity. Furthermore, we show that loss of Arid1a leads to increased expression of Arid1b, which is also indispensable for odontoblast differentiation but is not involved in regulation of Hh signaling. This study expands our knowledge of the intricate interactions among chromatin remodelers, transcription factors, and signaling molecules during progenitor cell fate determination and lineage commitment.
