Abstract: Summary
Glioma contains malignant cells in diverse states. Here, we combine spatial transcriptomics, spatial proteomics, and computational approaches to define glioma cellular states and uncover their organization. We find three prominent modes of organization. First, gliomas are composed of small local environments, each typically enriched with one major cellular state. Second, specific pairs of states preferentially reside in proximity across multiple scales. This pairing of states is consistent across tumors. Third, these pairwise interactions collectively define a global architecture composed of five layers. Hypoxia appears to drive the layers, as it is associated with a long-range organization that includes all cancer cell states. Accordingly, tumor regions distant from any hypoxic/necrotic foci and tumors that lack hypoxia such as low-grade IDH-mutant glioma are less organized. In summary, we provide a conceptual framework for the organization of cellular states in glioma, highlighting hypoxia as a long-range tissue organizer.

Abstract: Summary
Neutrophils, the most abundant and efficient defenders against pathogens, exert opposing functions across cancer types. However, given their short half-life, it remains challenging to explore how neutrophils adopt specific fates in cancer. Here, we generated and integrated single-cell neutrophil transcriptomes from 17 cancer types (225 samples from 143 patients). Neutrophils exhibited extraordinary complexity, with 10 distinct states including inflammation, angiogenesis, and antigen presentation. Notably, the antigen-presenting program was associated with favorable survival in most cancers and could be evoked by leucine metabolism and subsequent histone H3K27ac modification. These neutrophils could further invoke both (neo)antigen-specific and antigen-independent T cell responses. Neutrophil delivery or a leucine diet fine-tuned the immune balance to enhance anti-PD-1 therapy in various murine cancer models. In summary, these data not only indicate the neutrophil divergence across cancers but also suggest therapeutic opportunities such as antigen-presenting neutrophil delivery.

Abstract: Summary
Development of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) into neurons requires intricate regulation of transcription, splicing, and translation, but how these processes interconnect is not understood. We found that polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1) controls splicing of DPF2, a subunit of BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) chromatin remodeling complexes. Dpf2 exon 7 splicing is inhibited by PTBP1 to produce the DPF2-S isoform early in development. During neuronal differentiation, loss of PTBP1 allows exon 7 inclusion and DPF2-L expression. Different cellular phenotypes and gene expression programs were induced by these alternative DPF2 isoforms. We identified chromatin binding sites enriched for each DPF2 isoform, as well as sites bound by both. In ESC, DPF2-S preferential sites were bound by pluripotency factors. In neuronal progenitors, DPF2-S sites were bound by nuclear factor I (NFI), while DPF2-L sites were bound by CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF). DPF2-S sites exhibited enhancer modifications, while DPF2-L sites showed promoter modifications. Thus, alternative splicing redirects BAF complex targeting to impact chromatin organization during neuronal development.

Abstract: Summary
In addition to long-distance molecular motor-mediated transport, cellular vesicles also need to be moved at short distances with defined directions to meet functional needs in subcellular compartments but with unknown mechanisms. Such short-distance vesicle transport does not involve molecular motors. Here, we demonstrate, using synaptic vesicle (SV) transport as a paradigm, that phase separation of synaptic proteins with vesicles can facilitate regulated, directional vesicle transport between different presynaptic bouton sub-compartments. Specifically, a large coiled-coil scaffold protein Piccolo, in response to Ca2+ and via its C2A domain-mediated Ca2+ sensing, can extract SVs from the synapsin-clustered reserve pool condensate and deposit the extracted SVs onto the surface of the active zone protein condensate. We further show that the Trk-fused gene, TFG, also participates in COPII vesicle trafficking from ER to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment via phase separation. Thus, phase separation may play a general role in short-distance, directional vesicle transport in cells.

Abstract: Summary
Centriole biogenesis, as in most organelle assemblies, involves the sequential recruitment of sub-structural elements that will support its function. To uncover this process, we correlated the spatial location of 24 centriolar proteins with structural features using expansion microscopy. A time-series reconstruction of protein distributions throughout human procentriole assembly unveiled the molecular architecture of the centriole biogenesis steps. We found that the process initiates with the formation of a naked cartwheel devoid of microtubules. Next, the bloom phase progresses with microtubule blade assembly, concomitantly with radial separation and rapid cartwheel growth. In the subsequent elongation phase, the tubulin backbone grows linearly with the recruitment of the A-C linker, followed by proteins of the inner scaffold (IS). By following six structural modules, we modeled 4D assembly of the human centriole. Collectively, this work provides a framework to investigate the spatial and temporal assembly of large macromolecules.

Abstract: Summary
The hippocampus is critical for episodic memory. Although hippocampal activity represents place and other behaviorally relevant variables, it is unclear how it encodes numerous memories of specific events in life. To study episodic coding, we leveraged the specialized behavior of chickadees—food-caching birds that form memories at well-defined moments in time whenever they cache food for subsequent retrieval. Our recordings during caching revealed very sparse, transient barcode-like patterns of firing across hippocampal neurons. Each “barcode” uniquely represented a caching event and transiently reactivated during the retrieval of that specific cache. Barcodes co-occurred with the conventional activity of place cells but were uncorrelated even for nearby cache locations that had similar place codes. We propose that animals recall episodic memories by reactivating hippocampal barcodes. Similarly to computer hash codes, these patterns assign unique identifiers to different events and could be a mechanism for rapid formation and storage of many non-interfering memories.

Abstract: Summary
Many patient-derived tumor models have emerged recently. However, their potential to guide personalized drug selection remains unclear. Here, we report patient-derived tumor-like cell clusters (PTCs) for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), capable of conducting 100–5,000 drug tests within 10 days. We have established 283 PTC models with an 81% success rate. PTCs contain primary tumor epithelium self-assembled with endogenous stromal and immune cells and show a high degree of similarity to the original tumors in phenotypic and genotypic features. Utilizing standardized culture and drug-response assessment protocols, PTC drug-testing assays reveal 89% overall consistency in prospectively predicting clinical outcomes, with 98.1% accuracy distinguishing complete/partial response from progressive disease. Notably, PTCs enable accurate prediction of clinical outcomes for patients undergoing anti-PD1 therapy by combining cell viability and IFN-γ value assessments. These findings suggest that PTCs could serve as a valuable preclinical model for personalized medicine and basic research in NSCLC.

Abstract: Summary
In polycystic kidney disease (PKD), microscopic tubules expand into macroscopic cysts. Among the world’s most common genetic disorders, PKD is inherited via heterozygous loss-of-function mutations but is theorized to require additional loss of function. To test this, we establish human pluripotent stem cells in allelic series representing four common nonsense mutations, using CRISPR base editing. When differentiated into kidney organoids, homozygous mutants spontaneously form cysts, whereas heterozygous mutants (original or base corrected) express no phenotype. Using these, we identify eukaryotic ribosomal selective glycosides (ERSGs) as PKD therapeutics enabling ribosomal readthrough of these same nonsense mutations. Two different ERSGs not only prevent cyst initiation but also limit growth of pre-formed cysts by partially restoring polycystin expression. Furthermore, glycosides accumulate in cyst epithelia in organoids and mice. Our findings define the human polycystin threshold as a surmountable drug target for pharmacological or gene therapy interventions, with relevance for understanding disease mechanisms and future clinical trials.

Abstract: Summary
Alveolar epithelial type I cells (AT1s) line the gas exchange barrier of the distal lung and have been historically challenging to isolate or maintain in cell culture. Here, we engineer a human in vitro AT1 model system via directed differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We use primary adult AT1 global transcriptomes to suggest benchmarks and pathways, such as Hippo-LATS-YAP/TAZ signaling, enriched in these cells. Next, we generate iPSC-derived alveolar epithelial type II cells (AT2s) and find that nuclear YAP signaling is sufficient to promote a broad transcriptomic shift from AT2 to AT1 gene programs. The resulting cells express a molecular, morphologic, and functional phenotype reminiscent of human AT1 cells, including the capacity to form a flat epithelial barrier producing characteristic extracellular matrix molecules and secreted ligands. Our results provide an in vitro model of human alveolar epithelial differentiation and a potential source of human AT1s.

Abstract: Summary
Parietal cells (PCs) produce gastric acid to kill pathogens and aid digestion. Dysregulated PC census is common in disease, yet how PCs differentiate is unclear. Here, we identify the PC progenitors arising from isthmal stem cells, using mouse models and human gastric cells, and show that they preferentially express cell-metabolism regulator and orphan nuclear receptor Estrogen-related receptor gamma (Esrrg, encoding ERRγ). Esrrg expression facilitated the tracking of stepwise molecular, cellular, and ultrastructural stages of PC differentiation. EsrrgP2ACreERT2 lineage tracing revealed that Esrrg expression commits progenitors to differentiate into mature PCs. scRNA-seq indicated the earliest Esrrg+ PC progenitors preferentially express SMAD4 and SP1 transcriptional targets and the GTPases regulating acid-secretion signal transduction. As progenitors matured, ERRγ-dependent metabolic transcripts predominated. Organoid and mouse studies validated the requirement of ERRγ for PC differentiation. Our work chronicles stem cell differentiation along a single lineage in vivo and suggests ERRγ as a therapeutic target for PC-related disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Ubiquitylation regulates most proteins and biological processes in a eukaryotic cell. However, the site-specific occupancy (stoichiometry) and turnover rate of ubiquitylation have not been quantified. Here we present an integrated picture of the global ubiquitylation site occupancy and half-life. Ubiquitylation site occupancy spans over four orders of magnitude, but the median ubiquitylation site occupancy is three orders of magnitude lower than that of phosphorylation. The occupancy, turnover rate, and regulation of sites by proteasome inhibitors are strongly interrelated, and these attributes distinguish sites involved in proteasomal degradation and cellular signaling. Sites in structured protein regions exhibit longer half-lives and stronger upregulation by proteasome inhibitors than sites in unstructured regions. Importantly, we discovered a surveillance mechanism that rapidly and site-indiscriminately deubiquitylates all ubiquitin-specific E1 and E2 enzymes, protecting them against accumulation of bystander ubiquitylation. The work provides a systems-scale, quantitative view of ubiquitylation properties and reveals general principles of ubiquitylation-dependent governance.

Abstract: Summary
Generation of chimeric antigen receptor macrophages (CAR-Ms) from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) offers new prospects for cancer immunotherapy but is currently challenged by low differentiation efficiency and limited function. Here, we develop a highly efficient monolayer-based system that can produce around 6,000 macrophages from a single hPSC within 3 weeks. Based on CAR structure screening, we generate hPSC-CAR-Ms with stable CAR expression and potent tumoricidal activity in vitro. To overcome the loss of tumoricidal activity of hPSC-CAR-Ms in vivo, we use interferon-γ and monophosphoryl lipid A to activate an innate immune response that repolarizes the hPSC-CAR-Ms to tumoricidal macrophages. Moreover, through combined activation of T cells by hPSC-CAR-Ms, we demonstrate that activating a collaborative innate-adaptive immune response can further enhance the anti-tumor effect of hPSC-CAR-Ms in vivo. Collectively, our study provides feasible methodologies that significantly improve the production and function of hPSC-CAR-Ms to support their translation into clinical applications.

Abstract: Summary
Remyelination failure in diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS) was thought to involve suppressed maturation of oligodendrocyte precursors; however, oligodendrocytes are present in MS lesions yet lack myelin production. We found that oligodendrocytes in the lesions are epigenetically silenced. Developing a transgenic reporter labeling differentiated oligodendrocytes for phenotypic screening, we identified a small-molecule epigenetic-silencing-inhibitor (ESI1) that enhances myelin production and ensheathment. ESI1 promotes remyelination in animal models of demyelination and enables de novo myelinogenesis on regenerated CNS axons. ESI1 treatment lengthened myelin sheaths in human iPSC-derived organoids and augmented (re)myelination in aged mice while reversing age-related cognitive decline. Multi-omics revealed that ESI1 induces an active chromatin landscape that activates myelinogenic pathways and reprograms metabolism. Notably, ESI1 triggered nuclear condensate formation of master lipid-metabolic regulators SREBP1/2, concentrating transcriptional co-activators to drive lipid/cholesterol biosynthesis. Our study highlights the potential of targeting epigenetic silencing to enable CNS myelin regeneration in demyelinating diseases and aging.

Abstract: Summary
Antigen presentation defects in tumors are prevalent mechanisms of adaptive immune evasion and resistance to cancer immunotherapy, whereas how tumors evade innate immunity is less clear. Using CRISPR screens, we discovered that IGSF8 expressed on tumors suppresses NK cell function by interacting with human KIR3DL2 and mouse Klra9 receptors on NK cells. IGSF8 is normally expressed in neuronal tissues and is not required for cell survival in vitro or in vivo. It is overexpressed and associated with low antigen presentation, low immune infiltration, and worse clinical outcomes in many tumors. An antibody that blocks IGSF8-NK receptor interaction enhances NK cell killing of malignant cells in vitro and upregulates antigen presentation, NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and T cell signaling in vivo. In syngeneic tumor models, anti-IGSF8 alone, or in combination with anti-PD1, inhibits tumor growth. Our results indicate that IGSF8 is an innate immune checkpoint that could be exploited as a therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
Taurine is used to bolster immunity, but its effects on antitumor immunity are unclear. Here, we report that cancer-related taurine consumption causes T cell exhaustion and tumor progression. The taurine transporter SLC6A6 is correlated with aggressiveness and poor outcomes in multiple cancers. SLC6A6-mediated taurine uptake promotes the malignant behaviors of tumor cells but also increases the survival and effector function of CD8+ T cells. Tumor cells outcompete CD8+ T cells for taurine by overexpressing SLC6A6, which induces T cell death and malfunction, thereby fueling tumor progression. Mechanistically, taurine deficiency in CD8+ T cells increases ER stress, promoting ATF4 transcription in a PERK-JAK1-STAT3 signaling-dependent manner. Increased ATF4 transactivates multiple immune checkpoint genes and induces T cell exhaustion. In gastric cancer, we identify a chemotherapy-induced SP1-SLC6A6 regulatory axis. Our findings suggest that tumoral-SLC6A6-mediated taurine deficiency promotes immune evasion and that taurine supplementation reinvigorates exhausted CD8+ T cells and increases the efficacy of cancer therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Ubiquitin-dependent unfolding of the CMG helicase by VCP/p97 is required to terminate DNA replication. Other replisome components are not processed in the same fashion, suggesting that additional mechanisms underlie replication protein turnover. Here, we identify replisome factor interactions with a protein complex composed of AAA+ ATPases SPATA5-SPATA5L1 together with heterodimeric partners C1orf109-CINP (55LCC). An integrative structural biology approach revealed a molecular architecture of SPATA5-SPATA5L1 N-terminal domains interacting with C1orf109-CINP to form a funnel-like structure above a cylindrically shaped ATPase motor. Deficiency in the 55LCC complex elicited ubiquitin-independent proteotoxicity, replication stress, and severe chromosome instability. 55LCC showed ATPase activity that was specifically enhanced by replication fork DNA and was coupled to cysteine protease-dependent cleavage of replisome substrates in response to replication fork damage. These findings define 55LCC-mediated proteostasis as critical for replication fork progression and genome stability and provide a rationale for pathogenic variants seen in associated human neurodevelopmental disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Apelin is a key hormone in cardiovascular homeostasis that activates the apelin receptor (APLNR), which is regarded as a promising therapeutic target for cardiovascular disease. However, adverse effects through the β-arrestin pathway limit its pharmacological use. Here, we report cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of APLNR-Gi1 complexes bound to three agonists with divergent signaling profiles. Combined with functional assays, we have identified “twin hotspots” in APLNR as key determinants for signaling bias, guiding the rational design of two exclusive G-protein-biased agonists WN353 and WN561. Cryo-EM structures of WN353- and WN561-stimulated APLNR-G protein complexes further confirm that the designed ligands adopt the desired poses. Pathophysiological experiments have provided evidence that WN561 demonstrates superior therapeutic effects against cardiac hypertrophy and reduced adverse effects compared with the established APLNR agonists.

Abstract: Summary
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) share many clinical, pathological, and genetic features, but a detailed understanding of their associated transcriptional alterations across vulnerable cortical cell types is lacking. Here, we report a high-resolution, comparative single-cell molecular atlas of the human primary motor and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices and their transcriptional alterations in sporadic and familial ALS and FTLD. By integrating transcriptional and genetic information, we identify known and previously unidentified vulnerable populations in cortical layer 5 and show that ALS- and FTLD-implicated motor and spindle neurons possess a virtually indistinguishable molecular identity. We implicate potential disease mechanisms affecting these cell types as well as non-neuronal drivers of pathogenesis. Finally, we show that neuron loss in cortical layer 5 tracks more closely with transcriptional identity rather than cellular morphology and extends beyond previously reported vulnerable cell types.

Abstract: Summary
Hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs) are a ubiquitous class of protein in the extracellular matrices and cell walls of plants and algae, yet little is known of their native structures or interactions. Here, we used electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the structure of the hydroxyproline-rich mastigoneme, an extracellular filament isolated from the cilia of the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The structure demonstrates that mastigonemes are formed from two HRGPs (a filament of MST1 wrapped around a single copy of MST3) that both have hyperglycosylated poly(hydroxyproline) helices. Within the helices, O-linked glycosylation of the hydroxyproline residues and O-galactosylation of interspersed serine residues create a carbohydrate casing. Analysis of the associated glycans reveals how the pattern of hydroxyproline repetition determines the type and extent of glycosylation. MST3 possesses a PKD2-like transmembrane domain that forms a heteromeric polycystin-like cation channel with PKD2 and SIP, explaining how mastigonemes are tethered to ciliary membranes.

Abstract: Summary
The gut microbiota has been found to play an important role in the progression of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), but the mechanisms have not been established. Here, by developing a click-chemistry-based enrichment strategy, we identified several microbial-derived bile acids, including the previously uncharacterized 3-succinylated cholic acid (3-sucCA), which is negatively correlated with liver damage in patients with liver-tissue-biopsy-proven metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). By screening human bacterial isolates, we identified Bacteroides uniformis strains as effective producers of 3-sucCA both in vitro and in vivo. By activity-based protein purification and identification, we identified an enzyme annotated as β-lactamase in B. uniformis responsible for 3-sucCA biosynthesis. Furthermore, we found that 3-sucCA is a lumen-restricted metabolite and alleviates MASH by promoting the growth of Akkermansia muciniphila. Together, our data offer new insights into the gut microbiota-liver axis that may be leveraged to augment the management of MASH.

Abstract: Summary
Mastigonemes, the hair-like lateral appendages lining cilia or flagella, participate in mechanosensation and cellular motion, but their constituents and structure have remained unclear. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of native mastigonemes isolated from Chlamydomonas at 3.0 Å resolution. The long stem assembles as a super spiral, with each helical turn comprising four pairs of anti-parallel mastigoneme-like protein 1 (Mst1). A large array of arabinoglycans, which represents a common class of glycosylation in plants and algae, is resolved surrounding the type II poly-hydroxyproline (Hyp) helix in Mst1. The EM map unveils a mastigoneme axial protein (Mstax) that is rich in heavily glycosylated Hyp and contains a PKD2-like transmembrane domain (TMD). Mstax, with nearly 8,000 residues spanning from the intracellular region to the distal end of the mastigoneme, provides the framework for Mst1 assembly. Our study provides insights into the complexity of protein and glycan interactions in native bio-architectures.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanisms governing the maintenance of blood-producing hematopoietic stem and multipotent progenitor cells (HSPCs) are incompletely understood, particularly those regulating fate, ensuring long-term maintenance, and preventing aging-associated stem cell dysfunction. We uncovered a role for transitory free cytoplasmic iron as a rheostat for adult stem cell fate control. We found that HSPCs harbor comparatively small amounts of free iron and show the activation of a conserved molecular response to limited iron—particularly during mitosis. To study the functional and molecular consequences of iron restriction, we developed models allowing for transient iron bioavailability limitation and combined single-molecule RNA quantification, metabolomics, and single-cell transcriptomic analyses with functional studies. Our data reveal that the activation of the limited iron response triggers coordinated metabolic and epigenetic events, establishing stemness-conferring gene regulation. Notably, we find that aging-associated cytoplasmic iron loading reversibly attenuates iron-dependent cell fate control, explicating intervention strategies for dysfunctional aged stem cells.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a small double-stranded DNA virus that chronically infects 296 million people. Over half of its compact genome encodes proteins in two overlapping reading frames, and during evolution, multiple selective pressures can act on shared nucleotides. This study combines an RNA-based HBV cell culture system with deep mutational scanning (DMS) to uncouple cis- and trans-acting sequence requirements in the HBV genome. The results support a leaky ribosome scanning model for polymerase translation, provide a fitness map of the HBV polymerase at single-nucleotide resolution, and identify conserved prolines adjacent to the HBV polymerase termination codon that stall ribosomes. Further experiments indicated that stalled ribosomes tether the nascent polymerase to its template RNA, ensuring cis-preferential RNA packaging and reverse transcription of the HBV genome.

Abstract: Summary
A central question for regenerative neuroscience is whether synthetic neural circuits, such as those built from two species, can function in an intact brain. Here, we apply blastocyst complementation to selectively build and test interspecies neural circuits. Despite approximately 10–20 million years of evolution, and prominent species differences in brain size, rat pluripotent stem cells injected into mouse blastocysts develop and persist throughout the mouse brain. Unexpectedly, the mouse niche reprograms the birth dates of rat neurons in the cortex and hippocampus, supporting rat-mouse synaptic activity. When mouse olfactory neurons are genetically silenced or killed, rat neurons restore information flow to odor processing circuits. Moreover, they rescue the primal behavior of food seeking, although less well than mouse neurons. By revealing that a mouse can sense the world using neurons from another species, we establish neural blastocyst complementation as a powerful tool to identify conserved mechanisms of brain development, plasticity, and repair.

Abstract: Summary
Tauopathies are age-associated neurodegenerative diseases whose mechanistic underpinnings remain elusive, partially due to a lack of appropriate human models. Here, we engineered human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neuronal lines to express 4R Tau and 4R Tau carrying the P301S MAPT mutation when differentiated into neurons. 4R-P301S neurons display progressive Tau inclusions upon seeding with Tau fibrils and recapitulate features of tauopathy phenotypes including shared transcriptomic signatures, autophagic body accumulation, and reduced neuronal activity. A CRISPRi screen of genes associated with Tau pathobiology identified over 500 genetic modifiers of seeding-induced Tau propagation, including retromer VPS29 and genes in the UFMylation cascade. In progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) brains, the UFMylation cascade is altered in neurofibrillary-tangle-bearing neurons. Inhibiting the UFMylation cascade in vitro and in vivo suppressed seeding-induced Tau propagation. This model provides a robust platform to identify novel therapeutic strategies for 4R tauopathy.

Abstract: Summary
Neonatal spinal cord tissues exhibit remarkable regenerative capabilities as compared to adult spinal cord tissues after injury, but the role of extracellular matrix (ECM) in this process has remained elusive. Here, we found that early developmental spinal cord had higher levels of ECM proteins associated with neural development and axon growth, but fewer inhibitory proteoglycans, compared to those of adult spinal cord. Decellularized spinal cord ECM from neonatal (DNSCM) and adult (DASCM) rabbits preserved these differences. DNSCM promoted proliferation, migration, and neuronal differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and facilitated axonal outgrowth and regeneration of spinal cord organoids more effectively than DASCM. Pleiotrophin (PTN) and Tenascin (TNC) in DNSCM were identified as contributors to these abilities. Furthermore, DNSCM demonstrated superior performance as a delivery vehicle for NPCs and organoids in spinal cord injury (SCI) models. This suggests that ECM cues from early development stages might significantly contribute to the prominent regeneration ability in spinal cord.

Abstract: Summary
Diminished hepatocyte regeneration is a key feature of acute and chronic liver diseases and after extended liver resections, resulting in the inability to maintain or restore a sufficient functional liver mass. Therapies to restore hepatocyte regeneration are lacking, making liver transplantation the only curative option for end-stage liver disease. Here, we report on the structure-based development and characterization (nuclear magnetic resonance [NMR] spectroscopy) of first-in-class small molecule inhibitors of the dual-specificity kinase MKK4 (MKK4i). MKK4i increased liver regeneration upon hepatectomy in murine and porcine models, allowed for survival of pigs in a lethal 85% hepatectomy model, and showed antisteatotic and antifibrotic effects in liver disease mouse models. A first-in-human phase I trial (European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials [EudraCT] 2021-000193-28) with the clinical candidate HRX215 was conducted and revealed excellent safety and pharmacokinetics. Clinical trials to probe HRX215 for prevention/treatment of liver failure after extensive oncological liver resections or after transplantation of small grafts are warranted.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer immunotherapy has transformed treatment possibilities, but its effectiveness differs significantly among patients, indicating the presence of alternative pathways for immune evasion. Here, we show that ITPRIPL1 functions as an inhibitory ligand of CD3ε, and its expression inhibits T cells in the tumor microenvironment. The binding of ITPRIPL1 extracellular domain to CD3ε on T cells significantly decreased calcium influx and ZAP70 phosphorylation, impeding initial T cell activation. Treatment with a neutralizing antibody against ITPRIPL1 restrained tumor growth and promoted T cell infiltration in mouse models across various solid tumor types. The antibody targeting canine ITPRIPL1 exhibited notable therapeutic efficacy against naturally occurring tumors in pet clinics. These findings highlight the role of ITPRIPL1 (or CD3L1, CD3ε ligand 1) in impeding T cell activation during the critical “signal one” phase. This discovery positions ITPRIPL1 as a promising therapeutic target against multiple tumor types.

Abstract: Summary
Progress in understanding early human development has been impeded by the scarcity of reference datasets from natural embryos, particularly those with spatial information during crucial stages like gastrulation. We conducted high-resolution spatial transcriptomics profiling on 38,562 spots from 62 transverse sections of an intact Carnegie stage (CS) 8 human embryo. From this spatial transcriptomic dataset, we constructed a 3D model of the CS8 embryo, in which a range of cell subtypes are identified, based on gene expression patterns and positional register, along the anterior-posterior, medial-lateral, and dorsal-ventral axis in the embryo. We further characterized the lineage trajectories of embryonic and extra-embryonic tissues and associated regulons and the regionalization of signaling centers and signaling activities that underpin lineage progression and tissue patterning during gastrulation. Collectively, the findings of this study provide insights into gastrulation and post-gastrulation development of the human embryo.

Abstract: Summary
Chloroplast genes encoding photosynthesis-associated proteins are predominantly transcribed by the plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP). PEP is a multi-subunit complex composed of plastid-encoded subunits similar to bacterial RNA polymerases (RNAPs) stably bound to a set of nuclear-encoded PEP-associated proteins (PAPs). PAPs are essential to PEP activity and chloroplast biogenesis, but their roles are poorly defined. Here, we present cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of native 21-subunit PEP and a PEP transcription elongation complex from white mustard (Sinapis alba). We identify that PAPs encase the core polymerase, forming extensive interactions that likely promote complex assembly and stability. During elongation, PAPs interact with DNA downstream of the transcription bubble and with the nascent mRNA. The models reveal details of the superoxide dismutase, lysine methyltransferase, thioredoxin, and amino acid ligase enzymes that are subunits of PEP. Collectively, these data provide a foundation for the mechanistic understanding of chloroplast transcription and its role in plant growth and adaptation.

Abstract: Summary
Following the fertilization of an egg by a single sperm, the egg coat or zona pellucida (ZP) hardens and polyspermy is irreversibly blocked. These events are associated with the cleavage of the N-terminal region (NTR) of glycoprotein ZP2, a major subunit of ZP filaments. ZP2 processing is thought to inactivate sperm binding to the ZP, but its molecular consequences and connection with ZP hardening are unknown. Biochemical and structural studies show that cleavage of ZP2 triggers its oligomerization. Moreover, the structure of a native vertebrate egg coat filament, combined with AlphaFold predictions of human ZP polymers, reveals that two protofilaments consisting of type I (ZP3) and type II (ZP1/ZP2/ZP4) components interlock into a left-handed double helix from which the NTRs of type II subunits protrude. Together, these data suggest that oligomerization of cleaved ZP2 NTRs extensively cross-links ZP filaments, rigidifying the egg coat and making it physically impenetrable to sperm.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer immunotherapy remains limited by poor antigenicity and a regulatory tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, we create “onion-like” multi-lamellar RNA lipid particle aggregates (LPAs) to substantially enhance the payload packaging and immunogenicity of tumor mRNA antigens. Unlike current mRNA vaccine designs that rely on payload packaging into nanoparticle cores for Toll-like receptor engagement in immune cells, systemically administered RNA-LPAs activate RIG-I in stromal cells, eliciting massive cytokine/chemokine response and dendritic cell/lymphocyte trafficking that provokes cancer immunogenicity and mediates rejection of both early- and late-stage murine tumor models. In client-owned canines with terminal gliomas, RNA-LPAs improved survivorship and reprogrammed the TME, which became “hot” within days of a single infusion. In a first-in-human trial, RNA-LPAs elicited rapid cytokine/chemokine release, immune activation/trafficking, tissue-confirmed pseudoprogression, and glioma-specific immune responses in glioblastoma patients. These data support RNA-LPAs as a new technology that simultaneously reprograms the TME while eliciting rapid and enduring cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is best known for thermogenesis. Rodent studies demonstrated that enhanced BAT thermogenesis is tightly associated with increased energy expenditure, reduced body weight, and improved glucose homeostasis. However, human BAT is protective against type 2 diabetes, independent of body weight. The mechanism underlying this dissociation remains unclear. Here, we report that impaired mitochondrial catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) in BAT, by deleting mitochondrial BCAA carriers (MBCs), caused systemic insulin resistance without affecting energy expenditure and body weight. Brown adipocytes catabolized BCAA in the mitochondria as nitrogen donors for the biosynthesis of non-essential amino acids and glutathione. Impaired mitochondrial BCAA-nitrogen flux in BAT resulted in increased oxidative stress, decreased hepatic insulin signaling, and decreased circulating BCAA-derived metabolites. A high-fat diet attenuated BCAA-nitrogen flux and metabolite synthesis in BAT, whereas cold-activated BAT enhanced the synthesis. This work uncovers a metabolite-mediated pathway through which BAT controls metabolic health beyond thermogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Infections of the lung cause observable sickness thought to be secondary to inflammation. Signs of sickness are crucial to alert others via behavioral-immune responses to limit contact with contagious individuals. Gram-negative bacteria produce exopolysaccharide (EPS) that provides microbial protection; however, the impact of EPS on sickness remains uncertain. Using genome-engineered Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) strains, we compared EPS-producers versus non-producers and a virulent Escherichia coli (E. coli) lung infection model in male and female mice. EPS-negative P. aeruginosa and virulent E. coli infection caused severe sickness, behavioral alterations, inflammation, and hypothermia mediated by TLR4 detection of the exposed lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in lung TRPV1+ sensory neurons. However, inflammation did not account for sickness. Stimulation of lung nociceptors induced acute stress responses in the paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei by activating corticotropin-releasing hormone neurons responsible for sickness behavior and hypothermia. Thus, EPS-producing biofilm pathogens evade initiating a lung-brain sensory neuronal response that results in sickness.

Abstract: Summary
Chloroplasts are green plastids in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic algae and plants responsible for photosynthesis. The plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP) plays an essential role during chloroplast biogenesis from proplastids and functions as the predominant RNA polymerase in mature chloroplasts. The PEP-centered transcription apparatus comprises a bacterial-origin PEP core and more than a dozen eukaryotic-origin PEP-associated proteins (PAPs) encoded in the nucleus. Here, we determined the cryo-EM structures of Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) PEP-PAP apoenzyme and PEP-PAP transcription elongation complexes at near-atomic resolutions. Our data show the PEP core adopts a typical fold as bacterial RNAP. Fifteen PAPs bind at the periphery of the PEP core, facilitate assembling the PEP-PAP supercomplex, protect the complex from oxidation damage, and likely couple gene transcription with RNA processing. Our results report the high-resolution architecture of the chloroplast transcription apparatus and provide the structural basis for the mechanistic and functional study of transcription regulation in chloroplasts.

Abstract: Summary
Biological dinitrogen (N2) fixation is a key metabolic process exclusively performed by prokaryotes, some of which are symbiotic with eukaryotes. Species of the marine haptophyte algae Braarudosphaera bigelowii harbor the N2-fixing endosymbiotic cyanobacteria UCYN-A, which might be evolving organelle-like characteristics. We found that the size ratio between UCYN-A and their hosts is strikingly conserved across sublineages/species, which is consistent with the size relationships of organelles in this symbiosis and other species. Metabolic modeling showed that this size relationship maximizes the coordinated growth rate based on trade-offs between resource acquisition and exchange. Our findings show that the size relationships of N2-fixing endosymbionts and organelles in unicellular eukaryotes are constrained by predictable metabolic underpinnings and that UCYN-A is, in many regards, functioning like a hypothetical N2-fixing organelle (or nitroplast).

Abstract: Summary
The Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), widely recognized as the gold-standard reference map of human genetic variation, has largely overlooked tandem repeat (TR) expansions, despite the fact that TRs constitute ∼6% of our genome and are linked to over 50 human diseases. Here, we introduce the TR-gnomAD (https://wlcb.oit.uci.edu/TRgnomAD), a biobank-scale reference of 0.86 million TRs derived from 338,963 whole-genome sequencing (WGS) samples of diverse ancestries (39.5% non-European samples). TR-gnomAD offers critical insights into ancestry-specific disease prevalence using disparities in TR unit number frequencies among ancestries. Moreover, TR-gnomAD is able to differentiate between common, presumably benign TR expansions, which are prevalent in TR-gnomAD, from those potentially pathogenic TR expansions, which are found more frequently in disease groups than within TR-gnomAD. Together, TR-gnomAD is an invaluable resource for researchers and physicians to interpret TR expansions in individuals with genetic diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Cysteine-focused chemical proteomic platforms have accelerated the clinical development of covalent inhibitors for a wide range of targets in cancer. However, how different oncogenic contexts influence cysteine targeting remains unknown. To address this question, we have developed “DrugMap,” an atlas of cysteine ligandability compiled across 416 cancer cell lines. We unexpectedly find that cysteine ligandability varies across cancer cell lines, and we attribute this to differences in cellular redox states, protein conformational changes, and genetic mutations. Leveraging these findings, we identify actionable cysteines in NF-κB1 and SOX10 and develop corresponding covalent ligands that block the activity of these transcription factors. We demonstrate that the NF-κB1 probe blocks DNA binding, whereas the SOX10 ligand increases SOX10-SOX10 interactions and disrupts melanoma transcriptional signaling. Our findings reveal heterogeneity in cysteine ligandability across cancers, pinpoint cell-intrinsic features driving cysteine targeting, and illustrate the use of covalent probes to disrupt oncogenic transcription-factor activity.

Abstract: Summary
Autonomic parasympathetic neurons (parasymNs) control unconscious body responses, including “rest-and-digest.” ParasymN innervation is important for organ development, and parasymN dysfunction is a hallmark of autonomic neuropathy. However, parasymN function and dysfunction in humans are vastly understudied due to the lack of a model system. Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived neurons can fill this void as a versatile platform. Here, we developed a differentiation paradigm detailing the derivation of functional human parasymNs from Schwann cell progenitors. We employ these neurons (1) to assess human autonomic nervous system (ANS) development, (2) to model neuropathy in the genetic disorder familial dysautonomia (FD), (3) to show parasymN dysfunction during SARS-CoV-2 infection, (4) to model the autoimmune disease Sjögren’s syndrome (SS), and (5) to show that parasymNs innervate white adipocytes (WATs) during development and promote WAT maturation. Our model system could become instrumental for future disease modeling and drug discovery studies, as well as for human developmental studies.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO) is essential for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal; however, the mechanism by which mitochondrial metabolism controls HSC fate remains unknown. Here, we show that within the hematopoietic lineage, HSCs have the largest mitochondrial NADPH pools, which are required for proper HSC cell fate and homeostasis. Bioinformatic analysis of the HSC transcriptome, biochemical assays, and genetic inactivation of FAO all indicate that FAO-generated NADPH fuels cholesterol synthesis in HSCs. Interference with FAO disturbs the segregation of mitochondrial NADPH toward corresponding daughter cells upon single HSC division. Importantly, we have found that the FAO-NADPH-cholesterol axis drives extracellular vesicle (EV) biogenesis and release in HSCs, while inhibition of EV signaling impairs HSC self-renewal. These data reveal the existence of a mitochondrial NADPH-cholesterol axis for EV biogenesis that is required for hematopoietic homeostasis and highlight the non-stochastic nature of HSC fate determination.

Abstract: Summary
Many of the world’s most devastating crop diseases are caused by fungal pathogens that elaborate specialized infection structures to invade plant tissue. Here, we present a quantitative mass-spectrometry-based phosphoproteomic analysis of infection-related development by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, which threatens global food security. We mapped 8,005 phosphosites on 2,062 fungal proteins following germination on a hydrophobic surface, revealing major re-wiring of phosphorylation-based signaling cascades during appressorium development. Comparing phosphosite conservation across 41 fungal species reveals phosphorylation signatures specifically associated with biotrophic and hemibiotrophic fungal infection. We then used parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) to identify phosphoproteins regulated by the fungal Pmk1 MAPK that controls plant infection by M. oryzae. We define 32 substrates of Pmk1 and show that Pmk1-dependent phosphorylation of regulator Vts1 is required for rice blast disease. Defining the phosphorylation landscape of infection therefore identifies potential therapeutic interventions for the control of plant diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) response in human cancers is closely linked to the gut microbiota. Here, we report that the abundance of commensal Lactobacillus johnsonii is positively correlated with the responsiveness of ICB. Supplementation with Lactobacillus johnsonii or tryptophan-derived metabolite indole-3-propionic acid (IPA) enhances the efficacy of CD8+ T cell-mediated αPD-1 immunotherapy. Mechanistically, Lactobacillus johnsonii collaborates with Clostridium sporogenes to produce IPA. IPA modulates the stemness program of CD8+ T cells and facilitates the generation of progenitor exhausted CD8+ T cells (Tpex) by increasing H3K27 acetylation at the super-enhancer region of Tcf7. IPA improves ICB responsiveness at the pan-cancer level, including melanoma, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer. Collectively, our findings identify a microbial metabolite-immune regulatory pathway and suggest a potential microbial-based adjuvant approach to improve the responsiveness of immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
To understand biological processes, it is necessary to reveal the molecular heterogeneity of cells by gaining access to the location and interaction of all biomolecules. Significant advances were achieved by super-resolution microscopy, but such methods are still far from reaching the multiplexing capacity of proteomics. Here, we introduce secondary label-based unlimited multiplexed DNA-PAINT (SUM-PAINT), a high-throughput imaging method that is capable of achieving virtually unlimited multiplexing at better than 15 nm resolution. Using SUM-PAINT, we generated 30-plex single-molecule resolved datasets in neurons and adapted omics-inspired analysis for data exploration. This allowed us to reveal the complexity of synaptic heterogeneity, leading to the discovery of a distinct synapse type. We not only provide a resource for researchers, but also an integrated acquisition and analysis workflow for comprehensive spatial proteomics at single-protein resolution.

Abstract: Summary
Accumulating evidence suggests that cardiovascular disease (CVD) is associated with an altered gut microbiome. Our understanding of the underlying mechanisms has been hindered by lack of matched multi-omic data with diagnostic biomarkers. To comprehensively profile gut microbiome contributions to CVD, we generated stool metagenomics and metabolomics from 1,429 Framingham Heart Study participants. We identified blood lipids and cardiovascular health measurements associated with microbiome and metabolome composition. Integrated analysis revealed microbial pathways implicated in CVD, including flavonoid, γ-butyrobetaine, and cholesterol metabolism. Species from the Oscillibacter genus were associated with decreased fecal and plasma cholesterol levels. Using functional prediction and in vitro characterization of multiple representative human gut Oscillibacter isolates, we uncovered conserved cholesterol-metabolizing capabilities, including glycosylation and dehydrogenation. These findings suggest that cholesterol metabolism is a broad property of phylogenetically diverse Oscillibacter spp., with potential benefits for lipid homeostasis and cardiovascular health.

Abstract: Summary
Nephron progenitor cells (NPCs) self-renew and differentiate into nephrons, the functional units of the kidney. Here, manipulation of p38 and YAP activity allowed for long-term clonal expansion of primary mouse and human NPCs and induced NPCs (iNPCs) from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). Molecular analyses demonstrated that cultured iNPCs closely resemble primary human NPCs. iNPCs generated nephron organoids with minimal off-target cell types and enhanced maturation of podocytes relative to published human kidney organoid protocols. Surprisingly, the NPC culture medium uncovered plasticity in human podocyte programs, enabling podocyte reprogramming to an NPC-like state. Scalability and ease of genome editing facilitated genome-wide CRISPR screening in NPC culture, uncovering genes associated with kidney development and disease. Further, NPC-directed modeling of autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) identified a small-molecule inhibitor of cystogenesis. These findings highlight a broad application for the reported iNPC platform in the study of kidney development, disease, plasticity, and regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Mapping the intricate spatial relationships between the many different molecules inside a cell is essential to understanding cellular functions in all their complexity. Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy offers the required spatial resolution but struggles to reveal more than four different targets simultaneously. Exchanging labels in subsequent imaging rounds for multiplexed imaging extends this number but is limited by its low throughput. Here, we present a method for rapid multiplexed super-resolution microscopy that can, in principle, be applied to a nearly unlimited number of molecular targets by leveraging fluorogenic labeling in conjunction with transient adapter-mediated switching for high-throughput DNA-PAINT (FLASH-PAINT). We demonstrate the versatility of FLASH-PAINT with four applications: mapping nine proteins in a single mammalian cell, elucidating the functional organization of primary cilia by nine-target imaging, revealing the changes in proximity of thirteen different targets in unperturbed and dissociated Golgi stacks, and investigating and quantifying inter-organelle contacts at 3D super-resolution.

Abstract: Summary
Unlike those of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), and ssRNA viruses, the mechanism of genome packaging of dsRNA viruses is poorly understood. Here, we combined the techniques of high-resolution cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), cellular cryoelectron tomography (cryo-ET), and structure-guided mutagenesis to investigate genome packaging and capsid assembly of bluetongue virus (BTV), a member of the Reoviridae family of dsRNA viruses. A total of eleven assembly states of BTV capsid were captured, with resolutions up to 2.8 Å, with most visualized in the host cytoplasm. ATPase VP6 was found underneath the vertices of capsid shell protein VP3 as an RNA-harboring pentamer, facilitating RNA packaging. RNA packaging expands the VP3 shell, which then engages middle- and outer-layer proteins to generate infectious virions. These revealed “duality” characteristics of the BTV assembly mechanism reconcile previous contradictory co-assembly and core-filling models and provide insights into the mysterious RNA packaging and capsid assembly of Reoviridae members and beyond.

Abstract: Summary
SARS-CoV-2 and other sarbecoviruses continue to threaten humanity, highlighting the need to characterize common mechanisms of viral immune evasion for pandemic preparedness. Cytotoxic lymphocytes are vital for antiviral immunity and express NKG2D, an activating receptor conserved among mammals that recognizes infection-induced stress ligands (e.g., MIC-A/B). We found that SARS-CoV-2 evades NKG2D recognition by surface downregulation of MIC-A/B via shedding, observed in human lung tissue and COVID-19 patient serum. Systematic testing of SARS-CoV-2 proteins revealed that ORF6, an accessory protein uniquely conserved among sarbecoviruses, was responsible for MIC-A/B downregulation via shedding. Further investigation demonstrated that natural killer (NK) cells efficiently killed SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and limited viral spread. However, inhibition of MIC-A/B shedding with a monoclonal antibody, 7C6, further enhanced NK-cell activity toward SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Our findings unveil a strategy employed by SARS-CoV-2 to evade cytotoxic immunity, identify the culprit immunevasin shared among sarbecoviruses, and suggest a potential novel antiviral immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Lysine lactylation is a post-translational modification that links cellular metabolism to protein function. Here, we find that AARS1 functions as a lactate sensor that mediates global lysine lacylation in tumor cells. AARS1 binds to lactate and catalyzes the formation of lactate-AMP, followed by transfer of lactate to the lysince acceptor residue. Proteomics studies reveal a large number of AARS1 targets, including p53 where lysine 120 and lysine 139 in the DNA binding domain are lactylated. Generation and utilization of p53 variants carrying constitutively lactylated lysine residues revealed that AARS1 lactylation of p53 hinders its liquid-liquid phase separation, DNA binding, and transcriptional activation. AARS1 expression and p53 lacylation correlate with poor prognosis among cancer patients carrying wild type p53. β-alanine disrupts lactate binding to AARS1, reduces p53 lacylation, and mitigates tumorigenesis in animal models. We propose that AARS1 contributes to tumorigenesis by coupling tumor cell metabolism to proteome alteration.

Abstract: Summary
Gut inflammation involves contributions from immune and non-immune cells, whose interactions are shaped by the spatial organization of the healthy gut and its remodeling during inflammation. The crosstalk between fibroblasts and immune cells is an important axis in this process, but our understanding has been challenged by incomplete cell-type definition and biogeography. To address this challenge, we used multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) to profile the expression of 940 genes in 1.35 million cells imaged across the onset and recovery from a mouse colitis model. We identified diverse cell populations, charted their spatial organization, and revealed their polarization or recruitment in inflammation. We found a staged progression of inflammation-associated tissue neighborhoods defined, in part, by multiple inflammation-associated fibroblasts, with unique expression profiles, spatial localization, cell-cell interactions, and healthy fibroblast origins. Similar signatures in ulcerative colitis suggest conserved human processes. Broadly, we provide a framework for understanding inflammation-induced remodeling in the gut and other tissues.

Abstract: Summary
Attention filters sensory inputs to enhance task-relevant information. It is guided by an “attentional template” that represents the stimulus features that are currently relevant. To understand how the brain learns and uses templates, we trained monkeys to perform a visual search task that required them to repeatedly learn new attentional templates. Neural recordings found that templates were represented across the prefrontal and parietal cortex in a structured manner, such that perceptually neighboring templates had similar neural representations. When the task changed, a new attentional template was learned by incrementally shifting the template toward rewarded features. Finally, we found that attentional templates transformed stimulus features into a common value representation that allowed the same decision-making mechanisms to deploy attention, regardless of the identity of the template. Altogether, our results provide insight into the neural mechanisms by which the brain learns to control attention and how attention can be flexibly deployed across tasks.

Abstract: Summary
Microglia are brain-resident macrophages that shape neural circuit development and are implicated in neurodevelopmental diseases. Multiple microglial transcriptional states have been defined, but their functional significance is unclear. Here, we identify a type I interferon (IFN-I)-responsive microglial state in the developing somatosensory cortex (postnatal day 5) that is actively engulfing whole neurons. This population expands during cortical remodeling induced by partial whisker deprivation. Global or microglial-specific loss of the IFN-I receptor resulted in microglia with phagolysosomal dysfunction and an accumulation of neurons with nuclear DNA damage. IFN-I gain of function increased neuronal engulfment by microglia in both mouse and zebrafish and restricted the accumulation of DNA-damaged neurons. Finally, IFN-I deficiency resulted in excess cortical excitatory neurons and tactile hypersensitivity. These data define a role for neuron-engulfing microglia during a critical window of brain development and reveal homeostatic functions of a canonical antiviral signaling pathway in the brain.

Abstract: Summary
Biomolecules incur damage during stress conditions, and damage partitioning represents a vital survival strategy for cells. Here, we identified a distinct stress granule (SG), marked by dsRNA helicase DHX9, which compartmentalizes ultraviolet (UV)-induced RNA, but not DNA, damage. Our FANCI technology revealed that DHX9 SGs are enriched in damaged intron RNA, in contrast to classical SGs that are composed of mature mRNA. UV exposure causes RNA crosslinking damage, impedes intron splicing and decay, and triggers DHX9 SGs within daughter cells. DHX9 SGs promote cell survival and induce dsRNA-related immune response and translation shutdown, differentiating them from classical SGs that assemble downstream of translation arrest. DHX9 modulates dsRNA abundance in the DHX9 SGs and promotes cell viability. Autophagy receptor p62 is activated and important for DHX9 SG disassembly. Our findings establish non-canonical DHX9 SGs as a dedicated non-membrane-bound cytoplasmic compartment that safeguards daughter cells from parental RNA damage.

Abstract: Summary
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell transplant (HSCT) of CCR5 null (CCR5Δ32) cells can be curative for HIV-1-infected patients. However, because allogeneic HSCT poses significant risk, CCR5Δ32 matched bone marrow donors are rare, and CCR5Δ32 transplant does not confer resistance to the CXCR4-tropic virus, it is not a viable option for most patients. We describe a targeted Cas9/AAV6-based genome editing strategy for autologous HSCT resulting in both CCR5- and CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 resistance. Edited human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) maintain multi-lineage repopulation capacity in vivo, and edited primary human T cells potently inhibit infection by both CCR5-tropic and CXCR4-tropic HIV-1. Modification rates facilitated complete loss of CCR5-tropic replication and up to a 2,000-fold decrease in CXCR4-tropic replication without CXCR4 locus disruption. This multi-factor editing strategy in HSPCs could provide a broad approach for autologous HSCT as a functional cure for both CCR5-tropic and CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 infections.

Abstract: Summary
Proprioception tells the brain the state of the body based on distributed sensory neurons. Yet, the principles that govern proprioceptive processing are poorly understood. Here, we employ a task-driven modeling approach to investigate the neural code of proprioceptive neurons in cuneate nucleus (CN) and somatosensory cortex area 2 (S1). We simulated muscle spindle signals through musculoskeletal modeling and generated a large-scale movement repertoire to train neural networks based on 16 hypotheses, each representing different computational goals. We found that the emerging, task-optimized internal representations generalize from synthetic data to predict neural dynamics in CN and S1 of primates. Computational tasks that aim to predict the limb position and velocity were the best at predicting the neural activity in both areas. Since task optimization develops representations that better predict neural activity during active than passive movements, we postulate that neural activity in the CN and S1 is top-down modulated during goal-directed movements.

Abstract: Summary
The vasculature of the central nervous system is a 3D lattice composed of laminar vascular beds interconnected by penetrating vessels. The mechanisms controlling 3D lattice network formation remain largely unknown. Combining viral labeling, genetic marking, and single-cell profiling in the mouse retina, we discovered a perivascular neuronal subset, annotated as Fam19a4/Nts-positive retinal ganglion cells (Fam19a4/Nts-RGCs), directly contacting the vasculature with perisomatic endfeet. Developmental ablation of Fam19a4/Nts-RGCs led to disoriented growth of penetrating vessels near the ganglion cell layer (GCL), leading to a disorganized 3D vascular lattice. We identified enriched PIEZO2 expression in Fam19a4/Nts-RGCs. Piezo2 loss from all retinal neurons or Fam19a4/Nts-RGCs abolished the direct neurovascular contacts and phenocopied the Fam19a4/Nts-RGC ablation deficits. The defective vascular structure led to reduced capillary perfusion and sensitized the retina to ischemic insults. Furthermore, we uncovered a Piezo2-dependent perivascular granule cell subset for cerebellar vascular patterning, indicating neuronal Piezo2-dependent 3D vascular patterning in the brain.

Abstract: Summary
In mammals, the circadian clock network drives daily rhythms of tissue-specific homeostasis. To dissect daily inter-tissue communication, we constructed a mouse minimal clock network comprising only two nodes: the peripheral epidermal clock and the central brain clock. By transcriptomic and functional characterization of this isolated connection, we identified a gatekeeping function of the peripheral tissue clock with respect to systemic inputs. The epidermal clock concurrently integrates and subverts brain signals to ensure timely execution of epidermal daily physiology. Timely cell-cycle termination in the epidermal stem cell compartment depends upon incorporation of clock-driven signals originating from the brain. In contrast, the epidermal clock corrects or outcompetes potentially disruptive feeding-related signals to ensure the optimal timing of DNA replication. Together, we present an approach for cataloging the systemic dependencies of daily temporal organization in a tissue and identify an essential gate-keeping function of peripheral circadian clocks that guarantees tissue homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Liver injuries often occur in a zonated manner. However, detailed regenerative responses to such zonal injuries at cellular and molecular levels remain largely elusive. By using a fate-mapping strain, Cyp2e1-DreER, to elucidate liver regeneration after acute pericentral injury, we found that pericentral regeneration is primarily compensated by the expansion of remaining pericentral hepatocytes, and secondarily by expansion of periportal hepatocytes. Employing single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, immunostaining, and in vivo functional assays, we demonstrated that the upregulated expression of the mTOR/4E-BP1 axis and lactate dehydrogenase A in hepatocytes contributes to pericentral regeneration, while activation of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β1) signaling in the damaged area mediates fibrotic responses and inhibits hepatocyte proliferation. Inhibiting the pericentral accumulation of monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages through an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide-based strategy attenuates these cell-derived TGF-β1 signalings, thus improving pericentral regeneration. Our study provides integrated and high-resolution spatiotemporal insights into the cellular and molecular basis of pericentral regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Interspecies blastocyst complementation (IBC) provides a unique platform to study development and holds the potential to overcome worldwide organ shortages. Despite recent successes, brain tissue has not been achieved through IBC. Here, we developed an optimized IBC strategy based on C-CRISPR, which facilitated rapid screening of candidate genes and identified that Hesx1 deficiency supported the generation of rat forebrain tissue in mice via IBC. Xenogeneic rat forebrain tissues in adult mice were structurally and functionally intact. Cross-species comparative analyses revealed that rat forebrain tissues developed at the same pace as the mouse host but maintained rat-like transcriptome profiles. The chimeric rate of rat cells gradually decreased as development progressed, suggesting xenogeneic barriers during mid-to-late pre-natal development. Interspecies forebrain complementation opens the door for studying evolutionarily conserved and divergent mechanisms underlying brain development and cognitive function. The C-CRISPR-based IBC strategy holds great potential to broaden the study and application of interspecies organogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Due to the limitations of autologous chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells, alternative sources of cellular immunotherapy, including CAR macrophages, are emerging for solid tumors. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer an unlimited source for immune cell generation. Here, we develop human iPSC-derived CAR macrophages targeting prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) (CAR-iMacs), which express membrane-bound interleukin (IL)-15 and truncated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) for immune cell activation and a suicide switch, respectively. These allogeneic CAR-iMacs exhibit strong antitumor activity against human pancreatic solid tumors in vitro and in vivo, leading to reduced tumor burden and improved survival in a pancreatic cancer mouse model. CAR-iMacs appear safe and do not exhibit signs of cytokine release syndrome or other in vivo toxicities. We optimized the cryopreservation of CAR-iMac progenitors that remain functional upon thawing, providing an off-the-shelf, allogeneic cell product that can be developed into CAR-iMacs. Overall, our preclinical data strongly support the potential clinical translation of this human iPSC-derived platform for solid tumors, including pancreatic cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The membrane protein NINJ1 mediates plasma membrane rupture in pyroptosis and other lytic cell death pathways. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of a NINJ1 oligomer segmented from NINJ1 rings. Each NINJ1 subunit comprises amphipathic (⍺1, ⍺2) and transmembrane (TM) helices (⍺3, ⍺4) and forms a chain of subunits, mainly by the TM helices and ⍺1. ⍺3 and ⍺4 are kinked, and the Gly residues are important for function. The NINJ1 oligomer possesses a concave hydrophobic side that should face the membrane and a convex hydrophilic side formed by ⍺1 and ⍺2, presumably upon activation. This structural observation suggests that NINJ1 can form membrane disks, consistent with membrane fragmentation by recombinant NINJ1. Live-cell and super-resolution imaging uncover ring-like structures on the plasma membrane that are released into the culture supernatant. Released NINJ1 encircles a membrane inside, as shown by lipid staining. Therefore, NINJ1-mediated membrane disk formation is different from gasdermin-mediated pore formation, resulting in membrane loss and plasma membrane rupture.

Abstract: Summary
Knudson’s “two-hit” paradigm posits that carcinogenesis requires inactivation of both copies of an autosomal tumor suppressor gene. Here, we report that the glycolytic metabolite methylglyoxal (MGO) transiently bypasses Knudson’s paradigm by inactivating the breast cancer suppressor protein BRCA2 to elicit a cancer-associated, mutational single-base substitution (SBS) signature in nonmalignant mammary cells or patient-derived organoids. Germline monoallelic BRCA2 mutations predispose to these changes. An analogous SBS signature, again without biallelic BRCA2 inactivation, accompanies MGO accumulation and DNA damage in Kras-driven, Brca2-mutant murine pancreatic cancers and human breast cancers. MGO triggers BRCA2 proteolysis, temporarily disabling BRCA2’s tumor suppressive functions in DNA repair and replication, causing functional haploinsufficiency. Intermittent MGO exposure incites episodic SBS mutations without permanent BRCA2 inactivation. Thus, a metabolic mechanism wherein MGO-induced BRCA2 haploinsufficiency transiently bypasses Knudson’s two-hit requirement could link glycolysis activation by oncogenes, metabolic disorders, or dietary challenges to mutational signatures implicated in cancer evolution.

Abstract: Summary
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of druggable proteins encoded in the human genome, but progress in understanding and targeting them is hindered by the lack of tools to reliably measure their nuanced behavior in physiologically relevant contexts. Here, we developed a collection of compact ONE vector G-protein Optical (ONE-GO) biosensor constructs as a scalable platform that can be conveniently deployed to measure G-protein activation by virtually any GPCR with high fidelity even when expressed endogenously in primary cells. By characterizing dozens of GPCRs across many cell types like primary cardiovascular cells or neurons, we revealed insights into the molecular basis for G-protein coupling selectivity of GPCRs, pharmacogenomic profiles of anti-psychotics on naturally occurring GPCR variants, and G-protein subtype signaling bias by endogenous GPCRs depending on cell type or upon inducing disease-like states. In summary, this open-source platform makes the direct interrogation of context-dependent GPCR activity broadly accessible.

Abstract: Summary
Myelin, the insulating sheath that surrounds neuronal axons, is produced by oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS). This evolutionary innovation, which first appears in jawed vertebrates, enabled rapid transmission of nerve impulses, more complex brains, and greater morphological diversity. Here, we report that RNA-level expression of RNLTR12-int, a retrotransposon of retroviral origin, is essential for myelination. We show that RNLTR12-int-encoded RNA binds to the transcription factor SOX10 to regulate transcription of myelin basic protein (Mbp, the major constituent of myelin) in rodents. RNLTR12-int-like sequences (which we name RetroMyelin) are found in all jawed vertebrates, and we further demonstrate their function in regulating myelination in two different vertebrate classes (zebrafish and frogs). Our study therefore suggests that retroviral endogenization played a prominent role in the emergence of vertebrate myelin.

Abstract: Summary
Characterizing somatic mutations in the brain is important for disentangling the complex mechanisms of aging, yet little is known about mutational patterns in different brain cell types. Here, we performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 86 single oligodendrocytes, 20 mixed glia, and 56 single neurons from neurotypical individuals spanning 0.4–104 years of age and identified >92,000 somatic single-nucleotide variants (sSNVs) and small insertions/deletions (indels). Although both cell types accumulate somatic mutations linearly with age, oligodendrocytes accumulated sSNVs 81% faster than neurons and indels 28% slower than neurons. Correlation of mutations with single-nucleus RNA profiles and chromatin accessibility from the same brains revealed that oligodendrocyte mutations are enriched in inactive genomic regions and are distributed across the genome similarly to mutations in brain cancers. In contrast, neuronal mutations are enriched in open, transcriptionally active chromatin. These stark differences suggest an assortment of active mutagenic processes in oligodendrocytes and neurons.

The niche is typically considered as a pre-established structure sustaining stem cells. Therefore, the regulation of its formation remains largely unexplored. Whether distinct molecular mechanisms control the establishment versus maintenance of a stem cell niche is unknown. To address this, we compared perinatal and adult bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), a key component of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche. MSCs exhibited enrichment in genes mediating m6A mRNA methylation at the perinatal stage and downregulated the expression of Mettl3, the m6A methyltransferase, shortly after birth. Deletion of Mettl3 from developing MSCs but not osteoblasts led to excessive osteogenic differentiation and a severe HSC niche formation defect, which was significantly rescued by deletion of Klf2, an m6A target. In contrast, deletion of Mettl3 from MSCs postnatally did not affect HSC niche. Stem cell niche generation and maintenance thus depend on divergent molecular mechanisms, which may be exploited for regenerative medicine.

Abstract: Summary
The repertoire of modifications to bile acids and related steroidal lipids by host and microbial metabolism remains incompletely characterized. To address this knowledge gap, we created a reusable resource of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra by filtering 1.2 billion publicly available MS/MS spectra for bile-acid-selective ion patterns. Thousands of modifications are distributed throughout animal and human bodies as well as microbial cultures. We employed this MS/MS library to identify polyamine bile amidates, prevalent in carnivores. They are present in humans, and their levels alter with a diet change from a Mediterranean to a typical American diet. This work highlights the existence of many more bile acid modifications than previously recognized and the value of leveraging public large-scale untargeted metabolomics data to discover metabolites. The availability of a modification-centric bile acid MS/MS library will inform future studies investigating bile acid roles in health and disease.

Abstract: Summary
Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is an incurable group of early-onset dementias that can be caused by the deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau in patient brains. However, the mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration remain largely unknown. Here, we combined single-cell analyses of FTD patient brains with a stem cell culture and transplantation model of FTD. We identified disease phenotypes in FTD neurons carrying the MAPT-N279K mutation, which were related to oxidative stress, oxidative phosphorylation, and neuroinflammation with an upregulation of the inflammation-associated protein osteopontin (OPN). Human FTD neurons survived less and elicited an increased microglial response after transplantation into the mouse forebrain, which we further characterized by single nucleus RNA sequencing of microdissected grafts. Notably, downregulation of OPN in engrafted FTD neurons resulted in improved engraftment and reduced microglial infiltration, indicating an immune-modulatory role of OPN in patient neurons, which may represent a potential therapeutic target in FTD.

Abstract: Summary
Human tissue, which is inherently three-dimensional (3D), is traditionally examined through standard-of-care histopathology as limited two-dimensional (2D) cross-sections that can insufficiently represent the tissue due to sampling bias. To holistically characterize histomorphology, 3D imaging modalities have been developed, but clinical translation is hampered by complex manual evaluation and lack of computational platforms to distill clinical insights from large, high-resolution datasets. We present TriPath, a deep-learning platform for processing tissue volumes and efficiently predicting clinical outcomes based on 3D morphological features. Recurrence risk-stratification models were trained on prostate cancer specimens imaged with open-top light-sheet microscopy or microcomputed tomography. By comprehensively capturing 3D morphologies, 3D volume-based prognostication achieves superior performance to traditional 2D slice-based approaches, including clinical/histopathological baselines from six certified genitourinary pathologists. Incorporating greater tissue volume improves prognostic performance and mitigates risk prediction variability from sampling bias, further emphasizing the value of capturing larger extents of heterogeneous morphology.

Abstract: Summary
Neural stem cells (NSCs) must exit quiescence to produce neurons; however, our understanding of this process remains constrained by the technical limitations of current technologies. Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) of autofluorescent metabolic cofactors has been used in other cell types to study shifts in cell states driven by metabolic remodeling that change the optical properties of these endogenous fluorophores. Using this non-destructive, live-cell, and label-free strategy, we found that quiescent NSCs (qNSCs) and activated NSCs (aNSCs) have unique autofluorescence profiles. Specifically, qNSCs display an enrichment of autofluorescence localizing to a subset of lysosomes, which can be used as a graded marker of NSC quiescence to predict cell behavior at single-cell resolution. Coupling autofluorescence imaging with single-cell RNA sequencing, we provide resources revealing transcriptional features linked to deep quiescence and rapid NSC activation. Together, we describe an approach for tracking mouse NSC activation state and expand our understanding of adult neurogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
High-resolution electron microscopy of nervous systems has enabled the reconstruction of synaptic connectomes. However, we do not know the synaptic sign for each connection (i.e., whether a connection is excitatory or inhibitory), which is implied by the released transmitter. We demonstrate that artificial neural networks can predict transmitter types for presynapses from electron micrographs: a network trained to predict six transmitters (acetylcholine, glutamate, GABA, serotonin, dopamine, octopamine) achieves an accuracy of 87% for individual synapses, 94% for neurons, and 91% for known cell types across a D. melanogaster whole brain. We visualize the ultrastructural features used for prediction, discovering subtle but significant differences between transmitter phenotypes. We also analyze transmitter distributions across the brain and find that neurons that develop together largely express only one fast-acting transmitter (acetylcholine, glutamate, or GABA). We hope that our publicly available predictions act as an accelerant for neuroscientific hypothesis generation for the fly.

Abstract: Summary
FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3L), encoded by FLT3LG, is a hematopoietic factor essential for the development of natural killer (NK) cells, B cells, and dendritic cells (DCs) in mice. We describe three humans homozygous for a loss-of-function FLT3LG variant with a history of various recurrent infections, including severe cutaneous warts. The patients’ bone marrow (BM) was hypoplastic, with low levels of hematopoietic progenitors, particularly myeloid and B cell precursors. Counts of B cells, monocytes, and DCs were low in the patients’ blood, whereas the other blood subsets, including NK cells, were affected only moderately, if at all. The patients had normal counts of Langerhans cells (LCs) and dermal macrophages in the skin but lacked dermal DCs. Thus, FLT3L is required for B cell and DC development in mice and humans. However, unlike its murine counterpart, human FLT3L is required for the development of monocytes but not NK cells.

Abstract: Summary
This study has followed a birth cohort for over 20 years to find factors associated with neurodevelopmental disorder (ND) diagnosis. Detailed, early-life longitudinal questionnaires captured infection and antibiotic events, stress, prenatal factors, family history, and more. Biomarkers including cord serum metabolome and lipidome, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotype, infant microbiota, and stool metabolome were assessed. Among the 16,440 Swedish children followed across time, 1,197 developed an ND. Significant associations emerged for future ND diagnosis in general and for specific ND subtypes, spanning intellectual disability, speech disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and autism. This investigation revealed microbiome connections to future diagnosis as well as early emerging mood and gastrointestinal problems. The findings suggest links to immunodysregulation and metabolism, compounded by stress, early-life infection, and antibiotics. The convergence of infant biomarkers and risk factors in this prospective, longitudinal study on a large-scale population establishes a foundation for early-life prediction and intervention in neurodevelopment.

Abstract: Summary
We set out to exhaustively characterize the impact of the cis-chromatin environment on prime editing, a precise genome engineering tool. Using a highly sensitive method for mapping the genomic locations of randomly integrated reporters, we discover massive position effects, exemplified by editing efficiencies ranging from ∼0% to 94% for an identical target site and edit. Position effects on prime editing efficiency are well predicted by chromatin marks, e.g., positively by H3K79me2 and negatively by H3K9me3. Next, we developed a multiplex perturbational framework to assess the interaction of trans-acting factors with the cis-chromatin environment on editing outcomes. Applying this framework to DNA repair factors, we identify HLTF as a context-dependent repressor of prime editing. Finally, several lines of evidence suggest that active transcriptional elongation enhances prime editing. Consistent with this, we show we can robustly decrease or increase the efficiency of prime editing by preceding it with CRISPR-mediated silencing or activation, respectively.

Abstract: Summary
The reciprocal coordination between cholesterol absorption in the intestine and de novo cholesterol synthesis in the liver is essential for maintaining cholesterol homeostasis, yet the mechanisms governing the opposing regulation of these processes remain poorly understood. Here, we identify a hormone, Cholesin, which is capable of inhibiting cholesterol synthesis in the liver, leading to a reduction in circulating cholesterol levels. Cholesin is encoded by a gene with a previously unknown function (C7orf50 in humans; 3110082I17Rik in mice). It is secreted from the intestine in response to cholesterol absorption and binds to GPR146, an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor, exerting antagonistic downstream effects by inhibiting PKA signaling and thereby suppressing SREBP2-controlled cholesterol synthesis in the liver. Therefore, our results demonstrate that the Cholesin-GPR146 axis mediates the inhibitory effect of intestinal cholesterol absorption on hepatic cholesterol synthesis. This discovered hormone, Cholesin, holds promise as an effective agent in combating hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Summary
We sequenced and assembled using multiple long-read sequencing technologies the genomes of chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, orangutan, gibbon, macaque, owl monkey, and marmoset. We identified 1,338,997 lineage-specific fixed structural variants (SVs) disrupting 1,561 protein-coding genes and 136,932 regulatory elements, including the most complete set of human-specific fixed differences. We estimate that 819.47 Mbp or ∼27% of the genome has been affected by SVs across primate evolution. We identify 1,607 structurally divergent regions wherein recurrent structural variation contributes to creating SV hotspots where genes are recurrently lost (e.g., CARD, C4, and OLAH gene families) and additional lineage-specific genes are generated (e.g., CKAP2, VPS36, ACBD7, and NEK5 paralogs), becoming targets of rapid chromosomal diversification and positive selection (e.g., RGPD gene family). High-fidelity long-read sequencing has made these dynamic regions of the genome accessible for sequence-level analyses within and between primate species.

Abstract: Summary
Natural cell death pathways such as apoptosis and pyroptosis play dual roles: they eliminate harmful cells and modulate the immune system by dampening or stimulating inflammation. Synthetic protein circuits capable of triggering specific death programs in target cells could similarly remove harmful cells while appropriately modulating immune responses. However, cells actively influence their death modes in response to natural signals, making it challenging to control death modes. Here, we introduce naturally inspired “synpoptosis” circuits that proteolytically regulate engineered executioner proteins and mammalian cell death. These circuits direct cell death modes, respond to combinations of protease inputs, and selectively eliminate target cells. Furthermore, synpoptosis circuits can be transmitted intercellularly, offering a foundation for engineering synthetic killer cells that induce desired death programs in target cells without self-destruction. Together, these results lay the groundwork for programmable control of mammalian cell death.

Abstract: Summary
Effective treatments for complex central nervous system (CNS) disorders require drugs with polypharmacology and multifunctionality, yet designing such drugs remains a challenge. Here, we present a flexible scaffold-based cheminformatics approach (FSCA) for the rational design of polypharmacological drugs. FSCA involves fitting a flexible scaffold to different receptors using different binding poses, as exemplified by IHCH-7179, which adopted a “bending-down” binding pose at 5-HT2AR to act as an antagonist and a “stretching-up” binding pose at 5-HT1AR to function as an agonist. IHCH-7179 demonstrated promising results in alleviating cognitive deficits and psychoactive symptoms in mice by blocking 5-HT2AR for psychoactive symptoms and activating 5-HT1AR to alleviate cognitive deficits. By analyzing aminergic receptor structures, we identified two featured motifs, the “agonist filter” and “conformation shaper,” which determine ligand binding pose and predict activity at aminergic receptors. With these motifs, FSCA can be applied to the design of polypharmacological ligands at other receptors.

Abstract: Summary
Cell cycle progression relies on coordinated changes in the composition and subcellular localization of the proteome. By applying two distinct convolutional neural networks on images of millions of live yeast cells, we resolved proteome-level dynamics in both concentration and localization during the cell cycle, with resolution of ∼20 subcellular localization classes. We show that a quarter of the proteome displays cell cycle periodicity, with proteins tending to be controlled either at the level of localization or concentration, but not both. Distinct levels of protein regulation are preferentially utilized for different aspects of the cell cycle, with changes in protein concentration being mostly involved in cell cycle control and changes in protein localization in the biophysical implementation of the cell cycle program. We present a resource for exploring global proteome dynamics during the cell cycle, which will aid in understanding a fundamental biological process at a systems level.

Abstract: Summary
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) strongly correlates with neurodegenerative disease. However, it remains unclear which neurodegenerative mechanisms are intrinsic to the brain and which strategies most potently mitigate these processes. We developed a high-intensity ultrasound platform to inflict mechanical injury to induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cortical organoids. Mechanically injured organoids elicit classic hallmarks of TBI, including neuronal death, tau phosphorylation, and TDP-43 nuclear egress. We found that deep-layer neurons were particularly vulnerable to injury and that TDP-43 proteinopathy promotes cell death. Injured organoids derived from C9ORF72 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia (ALS/FTD) patients displayed exacerbated TDP-43 dysfunction. Using genome-wide CRISPR interference screening, we identified a mechanosensory channel, KCNJ2, whose inhibition potently mitigated neurodegenerative processes in vitro and in vivo, including in C9ORF72 ALS/FTD organoids. Thus, targeting KCNJ2 may reduce acute neuronal death after brain injury, and we present a scalable, genetically flexible cerebral organoid model that may enable the identification of additional modifiers of mechanical stress.

Abstract: Summary
Non-hematopoietic cells are essential contributors to hematopoiesis. However, heterogeneity and spatial organization of these cells in human bone marrow remain largely uncharacterized. We used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile 29,325 non-hematopoietic cells and discovered nine transcriptionally distinct subtypes. We simultaneously profiled 53,417 hematopoietic cells and predicted their interactions with non-hematopoietic subsets. We employed co-detection by indexing (CODEX) to spatially profile over 1.2 million cells. We integrated scRNA-seq and CODEX data to link predicted cellular signaling with spatial proximity. Our analysis revealed a hyperoxygenated arterio-endosteal neighborhood for early myelopoiesis, and an adipocytic localization for early hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). We used our CODEX atlas to annotate new images and uncovered mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) expansion and spatial neighborhoods co-enriched for leukemic blasts and MSCs in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient samples. This spatially resolved, multiomic atlas of human bone marrow provides a reference for investigation of cellular interactions that drive hematopoiesis.

Enteroendocrine cells (EECs) secrete serotonin (enterochromaffin [EC] cells) or specific peptide hormones (non-EC cells) that serve vital metabolic functions. The basis for terminal EEC diversity remains obscure. By forcing activity of the transcription factor (TF) NEUROG3 in 2D cultures of human intestinal stem cells, we replicated physiologic EEC differentiation and examined transcriptional and cis-regulatory dynamics that culminate in discrete cell types. Abundant EEC precursors expressed stage-specific genes and TFs. Before expressing pre-terminal NEUROD1, post-mitotic precursors oscillated between transcriptionally distinct ASCL1+ and HES6hi cell states. Loss of either factor accelerated EEC differentiation substantially and disrupted EEC individuality; ASCL1 or NEUROD1 deficiency had opposing consequences on EC and non-EC cell features. These TFs mainly bind cis-elements that are accessible in undifferentiated stem cells, and they tailor subsequent expression of TF combinations that underlie discrete EEC identities. Thus, early TF oscillations retard EEC maturation to enable accurate diversity within a medically important cell lineage.

Abstract: Summary
Post-implantation, the pluripotent epiblast in a human embryo forms a central lumen, paving the way for gastrulation. Osmotic pressure gradients are considered the drivers of lumen expansion across development, but their role in human epiblasts is unknown. Here, we study lumenogenesis in a pluripotent-stem-cell-based epiblast model using engineered hydrogels. We find that leaky junctions prevent osmotic pressure gradients in early epiblasts and, instead, forces from apical actin polymerization drive lumen expansion. Once the lumen reaches a radius of ∼12 μm, tight junctions mature, and osmotic pressure gradients develop to drive further growth. Computational modeling indicates that apical actin polymerization into a stiff network mediates initial lumen expansion and predicts a transition to pressure-driven growth in larger epiblasts to avoid buckling. Human epiblasts show transcriptional signatures consistent with these mechanisms. Thus, actin polymerization drives lumen expansion in the human epiblast and may serve as a general mechanism of early lumenogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Precise control of gene expression levels is essential for normal cell functions, yet how they are defined and tightly maintained, particularly at intermediate levels, remains elusive. Here, using a series of newly developed sequencing, imaging, and functional assays, we uncover a class of transcription factors with dual roles as activators and repressors, referred to as condensate-forming level-regulating dual-action transcription factors (TFs). They reduce high expression but increase low expression to achieve stable intermediate levels. Dual-action TFs directly exert activating and repressing functions via condensate-forming domains that compartmentalize core transcriptional unit selectively. Clinically relevant mutations in these domains, which are linked to a range of developmental disorders, impair condensate selectivity and dual-action TF activity. These results collectively address a fundamental question in expression regulation and demonstrate the potential of level-regulating dual-action TFs as powerful effectors for engineering controlled expression levels.

Abstract: Summary
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) reside in niches to maintain tissue homeostasis and contribute to repair and regeneration. Although the physiological functions of blood and lymphatic vasculature are well studied, their regulation of MSCs as niche components remains largely unknown. Using adult mouse incisors as a model, we uncover the role of Trp53 in regulating vascular composition through THBS2 to maintain mesenchymal tissue homeostasis. Loss of Trp53 in GLI1+ progeny increases arteries and decreases other vessel types. Platelet-derived growth factors from arteries deposit in the MSC region and interact with PDGFRA and PDGFRB. Significantly, PDGFRA+ and PDGFRB+ cells differentially contribute to defined cell lineages in the adult mouse incisor. Collectively, our results highlight Trp53’s importance in regulating the vascular niche for MSCs. They also shed light on how different arterial cells provide unique cues to regulate MSC subpopulations and maintain their heterogeneity. Furthermore, they provide mechanistic insight into MSC-vasculature crosstalk.

Abstract: Summary
Many behaviors require the coordinated actions of somatic and autonomic functions. However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. By opto-stimulating different populations of descending spinal projecting neurons (SPNs) in anesthetized mice, we show that stimulation of excitatory SPNs in the rostral ventromedial medulla (rVMM) resulted in a simultaneous increase in somatomotor and sympathetic activities. Conversely, opto-stimulation of rVMM inhibitory SPNs decreased both activities. Anatomically, these SPNs innervate both sympathetic preganglionic neurons and motor-related regions in the spinal cord. Fiber-photometry recording indicated that the activities of rVMM SPNs correlate with different levels of muscle and sympathetic tone during distinct arousal states. Inhibiting rVMM excitatory SPNs reduced basal muscle and sympathetic tone, impairing locomotion initiation and high-speed performance. In contrast, silencing the inhibitory population abolished muscle atonia and sympathetic hypoactivity during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Together, these results identify rVMM SPNs as descending spinal projecting pathways controlling the tone of both the somatomotor and sympathetic systems.

Abstract: Summary
The World Health Organization declared mpox a public health emergency of international concern in July 2022. To investigate global mpox transmission and population-level changes associated with controlling spread, we built phylogeographic and phylodynamic models to analyze MPXV genomes from five global regions together with air traffic and epidemiological data. Our models reveal community transmission prior to detection, changes in case reporting throughout the epidemic, and a large degree of transmission heterogeneity. We find that viral introductions played a limited role in prolonging spread after initial dissemination, suggesting that travel bans would have had only a minor impact. We find that mpox transmission in North America began declining before more than 10% of high-risk individuals in the USA had vaccine-induced immunity. Our findings highlight the importance of broader routine specimen screening surveillance for emerging infectious diseases and of joint integration of genomic and epidemiological information for early outbreak control.

Abstract: Summary
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disease characterized by multifocal lesions and smoldering pathology. Although single-cell analyses provided insights into cytopathology, evolving cellular processes underlying MS remain poorly understood. We investigated the cellular dynamics of MS by modeling temporal and regional rates of disease progression in mouse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). By performing single-cell spatial expression profiling using in situ sequencing (ISS), we annotated disease neighborhoods and found centrifugal evolution of active lesions. We demonstrated that disease-associated (DA)-glia arise independently of lesions and are dynamically induced and resolved over the disease course. Single-cell spatial mapping of human archival MS spinal cords confirmed the differential distribution of homeostatic and DA-glia, enabled deconvolution of active and inactive lesions into sub-compartments, and identified new lesion areas. By establishing a spatial resource of mouse and human MS neuropathology at a single-cell resolution, our study unveils the intricate cellular dynamics underlying MS.

Abstract: Summary
The Crumbs homolog 1 (CRB1) gene is associated with retinal degeneration, most commonly Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) and retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Here, we demonstrate that murine retinas bearing the Rd8 mutation of Crb1 are characterized by the presence of intralesional bacteria. While normal CRB1 expression was enriched in the apical junctional complexes of retinal pigment epithelium and colonic enterocytes, Crb1 mutations dampened its expression at both sites. Consequent impairment of the outer blood retinal barrier and colonic intestinal epithelial barrier in Rd8 mice led to the translocation of intestinal bacteria from the lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract to the retina, resulting in secondary retinal degeneration. Either the depletion of bacteria systemically or the reintroduction of normal Crb1 expression colonically rescued Rd8-mutation-associated retinal degeneration without reversing the retinal barrier breach. Our data elucidate the pathogenesis of Crb1-mutation-associated retinal degenerations and suggest that antimicrobial agents have the potential to treat this devastating blinding disease.

Abstract: Summary
Alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells are stem cells of the alveolar epithelia. Previous genetic lineage tracing studies reported multiple cellular origins for AT2 cells after injury. However, conventional lineage tracing based on Cre-loxP has the limitation of non-specific labeling. Here, we introduced a dual recombinase-mediated intersectional genetic lineage tracing approach, enabling precise investigation of AT2 cellular origins during lung homeostasis, injury, and repair. We found AT1 cells, being terminally differentiated, did not contribute to AT2 cells after lung injury and repair. Distinctive yet simultaneous labeling of club cells, bronchioalveolar stem cells (BASCs), and existing AT2 cells revealed the exact contribution of each to AT2 cells post-injury. Mechanistically, Notch signaling inhibition promotes BASCs but impairs club cells’ ability to generate AT2 cells during lung repair. This intersectional genetic lineage tracing strategy with enhanced precision allowed us to elucidate the physiological role of various epithelial cell types in alveolar regeneration following injury.

Abstract: Summary
The YAP/Hippo pathway is an organ growth and size regulation rheostat safeguarding multiple tissue stem cell compartments. LATS kinases phosphorylate and thereby inactivate YAP, thus representing a potential direct drug target for promoting tissue regeneration. Here, we report the identification and characterization of the selective small-molecule LATS kinase inhibitor NIBR-LTSi. NIBR-LTSi activates YAP signaling, shows good oral bioavailability, and expands organoids derived from several mouse and human tissues. In tissue stem cells, NIBR-LTSi promotes proliferation, maintains stemness, and blocks differentiation in vitro and in vivo. NIBR-LTSi accelerates liver regeneration following extended hepatectomy in mice. However, increased proliferation and cell dedifferentiation in multiple organs prevent prolonged systemic LATS inhibition, thus limiting potential therapeutic benefit. Together, we report a selective LATS kinase inhibitor agonizing YAP signaling and promoting tissue regeneration in vitro and in vivo, enabling future research on the regenerative potential of the YAP/Hippo pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in ARID1B, a member of the mSWI/SNF complex, cause severe neurodevelopmental phenotypes with elusive mechanisms in humans. The most common structural abnormality in the brain of ARID1B patients is agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC), characterized by the absence of an interhemispheric white matter tract that connects distant cortical regions. Here, we find that neurons expressing SATB2, a determinant of callosal projection neuron (CPN) identity, show impaired maturation in ARID1B+/− neural organoids. Molecularly, a reduction in chromatin accessibility of genomic regions targeted by TCF-like, NFI-like, and ARID-like transcription factors drives the differential expression of genes required for corpus callosum (CC) development. Through an in vitro model of the CC tract, we demonstrate that this transcriptional dysregulation impairs the formation of long-range axonal projections, causing structural underconnectivity. Our study uncovers new functions of the mSWI/SNF during human corticogenesis, identifying cell-autonomous axonogenesis defects in SATB2+ neurons as a cause of ACC in ARID1B patients.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) plays roles in various diseases. Many inflammatory signals, such as circulating lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), activate NF-κB via specific receptors. Using whole-genome CRISPR-Cas9 screens of LPS-treated cells that express an NF-κB-driven suicide gene, we discovered that the LPS receptor Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is specifically dependent on the oligosaccharyltransferase complex OST-A for N-glycosylation and cell-surface localization. The tool compound NGI-1 inhibits OST complexes in vivo, but the underlying molecular mechanism remained unknown. We did a CRISPR base-editor screen for NGI-1-resistant variants of STT3A, the catalytic subunit of OST-A. These variants, in conjunction with cryoelectron microscopy studies, revealed that NGI-1 binds the catalytic site of STT3A, where it traps a molecule of the donor substrate dolichyl-PP-GlcNAc2-Man9-Glc3, suggesting an uncompetitive inhibition mechanism. Our results provide a rationale for and an initial step toward the development of STT3A-specific inhibitors and illustrate the power of contemporaneous base-editor and structural studies to define drug mechanism of action.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding cellular coordination remains a challenge despite knowledge of individual pathways. The RNA exosome, targeting a wide range of RNA substrates, is often downregulated in cellular senescence. Utilizing an auxin-inducible system, we observed that RNA exosome depletion in embryonic stem cells significantly affects the transcriptome and proteome, causing pluripotency loss and pre-senescence onset. Mechanistically, exosome depletion triggers acute nuclear RNA aggregation, disrupting nuclear RNA-protein equilibrium. This disturbance limits nuclear protein availability and hinders polymerase initiation and engagement, reducing gene transcription. Concurrently, it promptly disrupts nucleolar transcription, ribosomal processes, and nuclear exporting, resulting in a translational shutdown. Prolonged exosome depletion induces nuclear structural changes resembling senescent cells, including aberrant chromatin compaction, chromocenter disassembly, and intensified heterochromatic foci. These effects suggest that the dynamic turnover of nuclear RNA orchestrates crosstalk between essential processes to optimize cellular function. Disruptions in nuclear RNA homeostasis result in systemic functional decline, altering the cell state and promoting senescence.

Abstract: Summary
The quality and quantity of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, particularly CD8+ T cells, are important parameters for the control of tumor growth and response to immunotherapy. Here, we show in murine and human cancers that these parameters exhibit circadian oscillations, driven by both the endogenous circadian clock of leukocytes and rhythmic leukocyte infiltration, which depends on the circadian clock of endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment. To harness these rhythms therapeutically, we demonstrate that efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy and immune checkpoint blockade can be improved by adjusting the time of treatment during the day. Furthermore, time-of-day-dependent T cell signatures in murine tumor models predict overall survival in patients with melanoma and correlate with response to anti-PD-1 therapy. Our data demonstrate the functional significance of circadian dynamics in the tumor microenvironment and suggest the importance of leveraging these features for improving future clinical trial design and patient care.

Abstract: Summary
Microbial communities are resident to multiple niches of the human body and are important modulators of the host immune system and responses to anticancer therapies. Recent studies have shown that complex microbial communities are present within primary tumors. To investigate the presence and relevance of the microbiome in metastases, we integrated mapping and assembly-based metagenomics, genomics, transcriptomics, and clinical data of 4,160 metastatic tumor biopsies. We identified organ-specific tropisms of microbes, enrichments of anaerobic bacteria in hypoxic tumors, associations between microbial diversity and tumor-infiltrating neutrophils, and the association of Fusobacterium with resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in lung cancer. Furthermore, longitudinal tumor sampling revealed temporal evolution of the microbial communities and identified bacteria depleted upon ICB. Together, we generated a pan-cancer resource of the metastatic tumor microbiome that may contribute to advancing treatment strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Human pluripotent stem cell-derived β cells (hPSC-β cells) show the potential to restore euglycemia. However, the immature functionality of hPSC-β cells has limited their efficacy in application. Here, by deciphering the continuous maturation process of hPSC-β cells post transplantation via single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (scATAC-seq), we show that functional maturation of hPSC-β cells is an orderly multistep process during which cells sequentially undergo metabolic adaption, removal of negative regulators of cell function, and establishment of a more specialized transcriptome and epigenome. Importantly, remodeling lipid metabolism, especially downregulating the metabolic activity of ceramides, the central hub of sphingolipid metabolism, is critical for β cell maturation. Limiting intracellular accumulation of ceramides in hPSC-β cells remarkably enhanced their function, as indicated by improvements in insulin processing and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. In summary, our findings provide insights into the maturation of human pancreatic β cells and highlight the importance of ceramide homeostasis in function acquisition.

Abstract: Summary
Nucleoli are multicomponent condensates defined by coexisting sub-phases. We identified distinct intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), including acidic (D/E) tracts and K-blocks interspersed by E-rich regions, as defining features of nucleolar proteins. We show that the localization preferences of nucleolar proteins are determined by their IDRs and the types of RNA or DNA binding domains they encompass. In vitro reconstitutions and studies in cells showed how condensation, which combines binding and complex coacervation of nucleolar components, contributes to nucleolar organization. D/E tracts of nucleolar proteins contribute to lowering the pH of co-condensates formed with nucleolar RNAs in vitro. In cells, this sets up a pH gradient between nucleoli and the nucleoplasm. By contrast, juxta-nucleolar bodies, which have different macromolecular compositions, featuring protein IDRs with very different charge profiles, have pH values that are equivalent to or higher than the nucleoplasm. Our findings show that distinct compositional specificities generate distinct physicochemical properties for condensates.

Abstract: Summary
Plasmids are extrachromosomal genetic elements that often encode fitness-enhancing features. However, many bacteria carry “cryptic” plasmids that do not confer clear beneficial functions. We identified one such cryptic plasmid, pBI143, which is ubiquitous across industrialized gut microbiomes and is 14 times as numerous as crAssphage, currently established as the most abundant extrachromosomal genetic element in the human gut. The majority of mutations in pBI143 accumulate in specific positions across thousands of metagenomes, indicating strong purifying selection. pBI143 is monoclonal in most individuals, likely due to the priority effect of the version first acquired, often from one’s mother. pBI143 can transfer between Bacteroidales, and although it does not appear to impact bacterial host fitness in vivo, it can transiently acquire additional genetic content. We identified important practical applications of pBI143, including its use in identifying human fecal contamination and its potential as an alternative approach to track human colonic inflammatory states.

Abstract: Summary
The glycine transporter 1 (GlyT1) plays a crucial role in the regulation of both inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission by removing glycine from the synaptic cleft. Given its close association with glutamate/glycine co-activated NMDA receptors (NMDARs), GlyT1 has emerged as a central target for the treatment of schizophrenia, which is often linked to hypofunctional NMDARs. Here, we report the cryo-EM structures of GlyT1 bound with substrate glycine and drugs ALX-5407, SSR504734, and PF-03463275. These structures, captured at three fundamental states of the transport cycle—outward-facing, occluded, and inward-facing—enable us to illustrate a comprehensive blueprint of the conformational change associated with glycine reuptake. Additionally, we identified three specific pockets accommodating drugs, providing clear insights into the structural basis of their inhibitory mechanism and selectivity. Collectively, these structures offer significant insights into the transport mechanism and recognition of substrate and anti-schizophrenia drugs, thus providing a platform to design small molecules to treat schizophrenia.
