Abstract: The EMT phenomenon is based on tumour progression. The cells lose their physiologic phenotype and assumed a mesenchymal phenotype characterized by an increased migratory capacity, invasiveness and high resistance to apoptosis. In this process, RHO family regulates the activation or suppression of ROCK (Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase) which in turn regulates the cytoskeleton dynamics. However, while the biochemical mechanisms are widely investigated, a comprehensive and careful estimation of biomechanical changes has not been extensively addressed. In this work, we used a strong ROCK inhibitor, Y-27632, to evaluate the effects of inhibition on living breast cancer epithelial cells by a biomechanical approach. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) was used to estimate changes of cellular elasticity, quantified by Young's modulus parameter. The morphometric alterations were analyzed by AFM topographies and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM). Our study revealed a significant modification in the Young's modulus after treatment, especially as regards cytoskeletal region. Our evidences suggest that the use of Y-27632 enhanced the cell rigidity, preventing cell migration and arrested the metastasization process representing a potential powerful factor for cancer treatment.

Abstract: The objective of the study was to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of bacoside A and bromelain against dichlorvos-incited toxicity. Healthy 6–8-week old, male Swiss mice were administered subacute doses of dichlorvos (40 mg/kg bw), bacoside A (5 mg/kg bw) and bromelain (70 mg/kg bw). AChE, BChE, GABA, serotonin and total protein content and their expressions were used for determination of toxic action of dichlorvos. Protective effects of bacoside A and bromelain were evaluated on the same parameters. Exposure to dichlorvos leads to significant decline in activities of AChE (p < 0.01, p < 0.001), BChE (p < 0.05) and GABA (p < 0.01) and total protein levels (p < 0.01). Antioxidant treatment significantly increased the activities of AChE (p < 0.01, p < 0.001), BChE (p < 0.05), GABA (p < 0.01) and total protein level (p < 0.05) compared to those in dichlorvos-treated mice. Overexpression of Hsp 70 protein and underexpression of phosphorylase a and b, catalase SOD and GPx were observed after dichlorvos exposure which suggests the oxidative stress. The results indicate that dichlorvos-induced neuronal damage which results in the generation of molecular expression of proteins is in agreement with the biochemical data ameliorated by bacoside A and bromelain.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer is the third most prevalent cancer type worldwide and contributes to a significant percentage of cancer-related mortality. Recent studies have shown that the CXCR5+CD8+ T cells present more potent proinflammatory function than CXCR5−CD8+ T cells in chronic virus infections and in follicular lymphoma, but the role of CXCR5+CD8+ T cells in colorectal cancer is yet unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that CXCR5+CD8+ T cells were very rare in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy and colorectal cancer individuals, but were significantly enriched in resected tumors and tumor-associated lymph nodes. Compared to CXCR5−CD8+ T cells, the CXCR5+CD8+ T cells demonstrated significantly higher Bcl-6 expression and lower Blimp1 expression, suggesting that CXCR5+CD8+ T cells might represent a memory CD8+ T cell subset. CXCR5+CD8+ T cells also enhanced the IgG expression by autologous B cells. Under ex vivo condition, the CXCR5+CD8+ T cells demonstrated lower degranulation, TNFα expression and IFNγ expression than CXCR5−CD8+ T cells. However, after PMA + ionomycin stimulation, the degranulation and TNFα expression by CXCR5+CD8+ T cells were significantly elevated to a level comparable with CXCR5−CD8+ T cells, whereas the IFNγ expression by PMA + ionomycin-stimulated CXCR5+CD8+ T cells were significantly higher than that by CXCR5−CD8+ T cells. Following long-term TCR-stimulation, CXCR5+CD8+ T cells demonstrated significantly more potent proliferation capacity and higher IFNγ expression than CXCR5−CD8+ T cells. TCR-stimulated CXCR5+CD8+ T cells also showed a gradual downregulation in CXCR5 expression. We further found that TCR-stimulated CXCR5+CD8+ T cells demonstrated higher granzyme B production and induced more specific lysis of autologous tumor cells than CXCR5−CD8+ T cells. Together, these data demonstrate that CXCR5+CD8+ T cells represent a significant CD8+ T cell subset in colorectal tumors and have the potential to contribute to antitumor immunity, but their specific roles require further studies in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
The interaction of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) with natural killer (NK) cells is traditionally thought of as a static inhibitory model, whereby resting MSCs inhibit NK cell effector function. Here, we use a dynamic in vitro system of poly(I:C) stimulation to model the interaction of NK cells and tissue-resident MSCs in the context of infection or tissue injury. The experiments suggest a time-dependent system of regulation and feedback, where, at early time points, activated MSCs secrete type I interferon to enhance NK cell effector function, while at later time points TGF-β and IL-6 limit NK cell effector function and terminate inflammatory responses by induction of a regulatory senescent-like NK cell phenotype. Importantly, feedback of these regulatory NK cells to MSCs promotes survival, proliferation, and pro-angiogenic properties. Our data provide additional insight into the interaction of stromal cells and innate immune cells and suggest a model of time-dependent MSC polarization and licensing.

Abstract: Summary
Diet, and specifically dietary metals, can modify the risk of infection. However, the mechanisms by which manganese (Mn), a common dietary supplement, alters infection remain unexplored. We report that dietary Mn levels dictate the outcome of systemic infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, a leading cause of bacterial endocarditis. Mice fed a high Mn diet display alterations in Mn levels and localization within infected tissues, and S. aureus virulence and infection of the heart are enhanced. Although the canonical mammalian Mn-sequestering protein calprotectin surrounds staphylococcal heart abscesses, calprotectin is not released into the abscess nidus and does not limit Mn in this organ. Consequently, excess Mn is bioavailable to S. aureus in the heart. Bioavailable Mn is utilized by S. aureus to detoxify reactive oxygen species and protect against neutrophil killing, enhancing fitness within the heart. Therefore, a single dietary modification overwhelms vital host antimicrobial strategies, leading to fatal staphylococcal infection.

Abstract: Summary
The Polycomb group gene BMI1 is essential for efficient muscle regeneration in a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and its enhanced expression in adult skeletal muscle satellite cells ameliorates the muscle strength in this model. Here, we show that the impact of mild BMI1 overexpression observed in mouse models is translatable to human cells. In human myoblasts, BMI1 overexpression increases mitochondrial activity, leading to an enhanced energetic state with increased ATP production and concomitant protection against DNA damage both in vitro and upon xenografting in a severe dystrophic mouse model. These preclinical data in mouse models and human cells provide a strong rationale for the development of pharmacological approaches to target BMI1-mediated mitochondrial regulation and protection from DNA damage to sustain the regenerative potential of the skeletal muscle in conditions of chronic muscle wasting.

Abstract: Summary
Hippocampal dentate gyrus is a focus of enhanced neurogenesis and excitability after traumatic brain injury. Increased neurogenesis has been proposed to aid repair of the injured network. Our data show that an early increase in neurogenesis after fluid percussion concussive brain injury is transient and is followed by a persistent decrease compared with age-matched controls. Post-injury changes in neurogenesis paralleled changes in neural precursor cell proliferation and resulted in a long-term decline in neurogenic capacity. Targeted pharmacology to restore post-injury neurogenesis to control levels reversed the long-term decline in neurogenic capacity. Limiting post-injury neurogenesis reduced early increases in dentate excitability and seizure susceptibility. Our results challenge the assumption that increased neurogenesis after brain injury is beneficial and show that early post-traumatic increases in neurogenesis adversely affect long-term outcomes by exhausting neurogenic potential and enhancing epileptogenesis. Treatments aimed at limiting excessive neurogenesis can potentially restore neuroproliferative capacity and limit epilepsy after brain injury.

Abstract: Hypoxia predisposes renal fibrosis. This study was conducted to identify novel approaches to ameliorate the pathogenic effect of hypoxia. Using human proximal tubular epithelial cells we showed that a pan-phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) dose and time dependently downregulated hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) mRNA expression, which was further augmented by addition of a transcriptional inhibitor, actinomycin D. IBMX also increased the cellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) level. Luciferase assay showed that blocking of protein kinase A (PKA) using H89 reduced, while 8-Br-cAMP agonized the repression of HIF-1α promoter activity in hypoxic condition. Deletion of cAMP response element binding sites from the HIF-1α promoter abrogated the effect of IBMX. Western blot and immunofluorescent study confirmed that the CoCl2 induced increased HIF-1α protein in whole cell lysate and in nucleus was reduced by the IBMX. Through this process, IBMX attenuated both CoCl2 and hypoxia induced mRNA expressions of two pro-fibrogenic factors, platelet-derived growth factor B and lysyl oxidase. Moreover, IBMX reduced production of a mesenchymal transformation factor, β-catenin; as well as protected against hypoxia induced cell-death. Taken together, our study showed novel evidence that the PDE inhibitor IBMX can downregulate the transcription of HIF-1α, and thus may attenuate hypoxia induced renal fibrosis.

Abstract: Slit/Robo signaling plays an important role in the guidance of developing neurons in developing embryos. However, it remains obscure whether and how Slit/Robo signaling is involved in the production of cranial neural crest cells. In this study, we examined Robo1 deficient mice to reveal developmental defects of mouse cranial frontal and parietal bones, which are derivatives of cranial neural crest cells. Therefore, we determined the production of HNK1+ cranial neural crest cells in early chick embryo development after knock-down (KD) of Robo1 expression. Detection of markers for pre-migratory and migratory neural crest cells, PAX7 and AP-2α, showed that production of both was affected by Robo1 KD. In addition, we found that the transcription factor slug is responsible for the aberrant delamination/EMT of cranial neural crest cells induced by Robo1 KD, which also led to elevated expression of E- and N-Cadherin. N-Cadherin expression was enhanced when blocking FGF signaling with dominant-negative FGFR1 in half of the neural tube. Taken together, we show that Slit/Robo signaling influences the delamination/EMT of cranial neural crest cells, which is required for cranial bone development.

Abstract: Retinoid X Receptor (RXR) serves as the heterodimeric partner of two major xenobiotic nuclear receptors, Pregnane and Xenobiotic Receptor (PXR) and Constitutive Androstane Receptor (CAR). These receptors are primarily involved in the metabolism and clearance of endobiotics and xenobiotics (including clinical drugs) from the body. Here, we report for the first time that intermolecular interactions between RXR-PXR and RXR-CAR occurs in the cytoplasmic compartment of the cell in a ligand-independent manner. These interactions lead to nuclear import of the heterodimeric complex thereby making them competent for chromatin binding and transactivation of target genes. To explore the cellular site involved in the process of heterodimerization we created various RFP- and GFP-tagged receptor chimeras and also the mutants of their nuclear localization signal (NLS). From the study it is apparent that NLS of PXR/CAR/RXR play a major role in the import of the heterodimeric complex from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in a ligand-independent manner. We observed that along with the heterodimeric partner and/or respective ligand a functional NLS is necessary for activation of target gene. The data suggests that RXR is the major driving force to import the heterodimeric complex into the nucleus since the mutation in the NLS region of RXR weakens this import process dramatically, whereas mutations in the NLS regions of PXR and CAR have little or no significant effect. This RXR-dependent nuclear translocation of the heterodimeric complex also modulates the individual transcriptional activity of PXR and CAR by increasing the basal transcriptional activity. Finally, it is documented that the heterodimerization of RXR with both the partners (PXR, CAR) occurs in the cytoplasm and implies that these dynamic interactions have functional and regulatory attributes in gene expression. In addition, this RXR-dependent enhancement of the transcriptional activity of PXR and CAR may be utilized for evaluating the receptor-drug interactions.

Abstract: The tumor-associated immune response is governed by the signalling events of various regulatory molecules, one of which is the cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4). In conventional T cells, CTLA-4 could outcompete CD28 in binding to CD80/86 but does not produce a co-stimulatory signal, resulting in T cell anergy. CTLA-4 in regulatory T cells (Tregs) could also function in a cell-extrinsic fashion by removing CD80/CD86 from the antigen-presenting cells (APCs), thus preventing further priming of other T cells. In this study, we examined the role of CTLA-4 in CD4+ T cell subsets from pancreatic cancer patients. In circulating CD4+ T cells, the expression of CTLA-4 was low at baseline but was significantly upregulated following T cell stimulation. Interestingly, the CTLA-4-expressing CD4+ T cells at baseline were overwhelmingly FOXP3-expressing. With the increase of T cell stimulation, the proportion of ROR gamma t-expressing CD4+ T cells was progressively increased. By CD25 vs. CCR6 staining, the CD25+CCR6+ and the CD25+CCR6- CD4+ T cells both presented high levels of CTLA-4 expression, but only the CD25+CCR6+ and the CD25-CCR6+ expressed significant amounts of IL-17. When incubated with autologous CD8+ T cells, the CD25+CCR6+ Th17 cells presented significantly higher suppressive function than the CD25-CCR6+ Th17 cells in a CTLA-4-dependent manner. Finally, the CTLA-4-expressing Th17 cells were present at higher levels in the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes than in circulating blood. Overall, these data suggest that CTLA-4 expressing Th17 cells may present regulatory activities in pancreatic cancer patients.

Abstract: Summary
The production of insulin-producing β cells from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) in vitro represents a promising strategy for a cell-based therapy for type 1 diabetes mellitus. To explore the cellular heterogeneity and temporal progression of endocrine progenitors and their progeny, we performed single-cell qPCR on more than 500 cells across several stages of in vitro differentiation of hESCs and compared them with human islets. We reveal distinct subpopulations along the endocrine differentiation path and an early lineage bifurcation toward either polyhormonal cells or β-like cells. We uncover several similarities and differences with mouse development and reveal that cells can take multiple paths to the same differentiation state, a principle that could be relevant to other systems. Notably, activation of the key β-cell transcription factor NKX6.1 can be initiated before or after endocrine commitment. The single-cell temporal resolution we provide can be used to improve the production of functional β cells.

Abstract: Adult human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSC) cultured for cell therapy require evaluation of potency and stability for safe use. Chromosomal aberrations upsetting genomic integrity in such cells have been contrastingly described as “Limited” or “Significant”. Previously reported stepwise acquisition of a spontaneous neoplastic phenotype during three-year continuous culture of telomerized cells (hBMSC-TERT20) didn't alter a diploid karyotype measured by spectral karyotype analysis (SKY). Such screening may not adequately monitor abnormal and potentially tumorigenic hBMSC in clinical scenarios. We here used array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to more stringently compare non-tumorigenic parental hBMSC-TERT strains with their tumorigenic subcloned populations. Confirmation of a known chromosome 9p21 microdeletion at locus CDKN2A/B, showed it also impinged upon the adjacent MTAP gene. Compared to reference diploid human fibroblast genomic DNA, the non-tumorigenic hBMSC-TERT4 cells had a copy number variation (CNV) in at least 14 independent loci. The pre-tumorigenic hBMSC-TERT20 cell strain had further CNV including 1q44 gain enhancing SMYD3 expression and 11q13.1 loss downregulating MUS81 expression. Bioinformatic analysis of gene products reflecting 11p15.5 CNV gain in tumorigenic hBMSC-TERT20 cells highlighted networks implicated in tumorigenic progression involving cell cycle control and mis-match repair. We provide novel biomarkers for prospective risk assessment of expanded stem cell cultures.

Abstract: Summary
In vitro differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) into retinal fates can be used to study the roles of exogenous factors acting through multiple signaling pathways during retina development. Application of activin A during a specific time frame that corresponds to early embryonic retinogenesis caused increased generation of CRX+ photoreceptor precursors and decreased PAX6+ retinal progenitor cells (RPCs). Following activin A treatment, SMAD2/3 was activated in RPCs and bound to promoter regions of key RPC and photoreceptor genes. The effect of activin on CRX expression was repressed by pharmacological inhibition of SMAD2/3 phosphorylation. Activin signaling through SMAD2/3 in RPCs regulates expression of transcription factors involved in cell type determination and promotes photoreceptor lineage specification. Our findings can contribute to the production of photoreceptors for cell replacement therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Rhomboid-family intramembrane proteases regulate important biological processes and have been associated with malaria, cancer, and Parkinson's disease. However, due to the lack of potent, selective, and pharmacologically compliant inhibitors, the wide therapeutic potential of rhomboids is currently untapped. Here, we bridge this gap by discovering that peptidyl α-ketoamides substituted at the ketoamide nitrogen by hydrophobic groups are potent rhomboid inhibitors active in the nanomolar range, surpassing the currently used rhomboid inhibitors by up to three orders of magnitude. Such peptidyl ketoamides show selectivity for rhomboids, leaving most human serine hydrolases unaffected. Crystal structures show that these compounds bind the active site of rhomboid covalently and in a substrate-like manner, and kinetic analysis reveals their reversible, slow-binding, non-competitive mechanism. Since ketoamides are clinically used pharmacophores, our findings uncover a straightforward modular way for the design of specific inhibitors of rhomboid proteases, which can be widely applicable in cell biology and drug discovery.

Abstract: Summary
Covalent inhibitors of K-Ras(G12C) have been reported that exclusively recognize the GDP state. Here, we utilize disulfide tethering of a non-natural cysteine (K-Ras(M72C)) to identify a new switch-II pocket (S-IIP) binding ligand (2C07) that engages the active GTP state. Co-crystal structures of 2C07 bound to H-Ras(M72C) reveal binding in a cryptic groove we term S-IIG. In the GppNHp state, 2C07 binding to a modified S-IIP pushes switch I away from the nucleotide, breaking the network of polar contacts essential for adopting the canonical GTP state. Biochemical studies show that 2C07 alters nucleotide preference and inhibits SOS binding and catalyzed nucleotide exchange. 2C07 was converted to irreversible covalent analogs, which target both nucleotide states, inhibit PI3K activation in vitro, and function as occupancy probes to detect reversible engagement in competition assays. Targeting both nucleotide states opens the possibility of inhibiting oncogenic mutants of Ras, which exist predominantly in the GTP state in cells.

Abstract: We have established that annexin A2 (ANXA2) is an important factor in the experimental hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) serum-induced proliferation of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). However, the detailed mechanism remains unclear. ANXA2 translocated to the caveolin-enriched microdomains (caveolae) in PASMCs upon HPS serum stimulation. The disruption of caveolae by Methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) alleviated the caveolae recruitment of ANXA2 and the ANXA2-mediated activation of ERK1/2 and NF-κB, so that ANXA2-modulated PASMC proliferation was suppressed. The over-expression of Cav-1 resulted in the relocation of ANXA2 from caveolae and negatively regulated ERK1/2 and NF-κB activation, which inhibited the ANXA2-modulated PASMC proliferative behavior. These data indicate that caveolae function as a signaling platform for ANXA2-induced proliferative behavior and Cav-1 participates upstream of ANXA2 in the activation of ERK1/2 and NF-κB.

Abstract: Summary
Many natural products that show therapeutic activities are often difficult to synthesize or isolate and have unknown targets, hindering their development as drugs. Identifying druggable hotspots targeted by covalently acting anti-cancer natural products can enable pharmacological interrogation of these sites with more synthetically tractable compounds. Here, we used chemoproteomic platforms to discover that the anti-cancer natural product withaferin A targets C377 on the regulatory subunit PPP2R1A of the tumor-suppressor protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complex leading to activation of PP2A activity, inactivation of AKT, and impaired breast cancer cell proliferation. We developed a more synthetically tractable cysteine-reactive covalent ligand, JNS 1-40, that selectively targets C377 of PPP2R1A to impair breast cancer signaling, proliferation, and in vivo tumor growth. Our study highlights the utility of using chemoproteomics to map druggable hotspots targeted by complex natural products and subsequently interrogating these sites with more synthetically tractable covalent ligands for cancer therapy.

Abstract: Accumulating evidence suggests that abnormal inflammation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). CD8+CD25+Foxp3+ T cell is a novel cell subtype, and its role in PAH is not yet investigated. Here, we observed that PAH patients presented a significant upregulation of CD8+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells and a downregulation of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells compared to healthy controls. Regardless, the total number of CD25+Foxp3+ T cells in PAH patients was still smaller than that in healthy controls. Compared to CD8+CD25- T cells, CD8+CD25+ T cells presented higher Foxp3 expression, lower interferon (IFN)-γ expression and higher transforming growth factor (TGF)-β expression, in both healthy and PAH individuals. The CD8+CD25+ T cells in PAH patients also demonstrated regulatory function by suppressing the proliferation of CD4+CD25- and CD8+CD25- effector T cells, albeit at lower efficiency than CD4+CD25+ T cells from PAH patients and healthy volunteers. CD8+CD25+ T cells from PAH responded to interleukin (IL)−2 supplement by expansion and upregulating Foxp3 expression. In PAH patients, IL-2-treated CD8+CD25+ T cells were more potent at inhibiting CD4+CD25- effector T cell proliferation than IL-2-untreated CD8+CD25+ T cells. Together, we found an upregulation of CD8+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells in PAH patients, and this T cell population presented suppressive activity that could be enhanced by IL-2 treatment.

Abstract: Developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) testing performed in rats is resource-intensive (costs, time, animals) and bears the issue of species extrapolation. Thus, reliable alternative human-based approaches are needed for predicting neurodevelopmental toxicity. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) represent a basis for an alternative method possibly being part of an alternative DNT testing strategy. Here, we compared two hiPSC neural induction protocols resulting in 3D neurospheres: one using noggin and one cultivating cells in neural induction medium (NIM protocol). Performance of Nestin+/SOX2+ hiPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) was compared to primary human NPCs. Generally, primary hNPCs first differentiate into Nestin+ and/or GFAP+ radial glia-like cells, while the hiPSC-derived NPCs (hiPSC-NPC) first differentiate into βIII-Tubulin+ neurons suggesting an earlier developmental stage of hiPSC-NPC. In the ‘Neurosphere Assay’, NIM generated hiPSC-NPC produced neurons with higher performance than with the noggin protocol. After long-term differentiation, hiPSC-NPC form neuronal networks, which become electrically active on microelectrode arrays after 85days. Finally, methylmercury chloride inhibits hiPSC-NPC and hNPC migration with similar potencies. hiPSC-NPCs-derived neurospheres seem to be useful for DNT evaluation representing early neural development in vitro. More system characterization by compound testing is needed to gain higher confidence in this method.

Abstract: Summary
The endometrial layer comprises luminal and glandular epithelia that both develop from the same simple layer of fetal uterine epithelium. Mechanisms of uterine epithelial progenitor self-renewal and differentiation are unclear. This study aims to systematically analyze the molecular and cellular mechanisms of uterine epithelial development by single-cell analysis. An integrated set of single-cell transcriptomic data of uterine epithelial progenitors and their differentiated progenies is provided. Additionally the unique molecular signatures of these cells, characterized by sequential upregulation of specific epigenetic and metabolic activities, and activation of unique signaling pathways and transcription factors, were also investigated. Finally a unique subpopulation of early progenitor, as well as differentiated luminal and glandular lineages, were identified. A complex cellular hierarchy of uterine epithelial development was thus delineated. Our study therefore systematically decoded molecular markers and a cellular program of uterine epithelial development that sheds light on uterine developmental biology.

Abstract: Cadmium (Cd) is a carcinogen with several well-described toxicological effects in humans, but its molecular mechanisms are still not fully understood. Overexpression of heat shock protein 27 (HSP27/HSPB1)—a multifunctional protein chaperone—has been shown to protect cells from oxidative damage and apoptosis triggered by Cd exposure. The aims of this work were to investigate the potential use of extracellular recombinant HSP27 to prevent/counteract Cd-induced cellular toxicity and to evaluate if peroxynitrite was involved in the development of Cd-induced toxicity. Here, we report that the harmful effects of Cd correlated with changes in oxidative stress markers: upregulation of reactive oxygen species, reduction in nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, increment in lipid peroxidation, peroxynitrite (PN), and protein nitration; intracellular HSP27 was reduced. Treatments with Cd (100 μM) for 24 h or with the peroxynitrite donor, SIN-1, decreased HSP27 levels (~50%), suggesting that PN formation is responsible for the reduction of HSP27. Pre-treatments of the cells either with Nω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME) (a pharmacological inhibitor of NO synthase) or with recombinant HSP27 (rHSP27) attenuated the disruption of the cellular metabolism induced by Cd, increasing in a 55 and 52%, respectively, the cell viability measured by CCK-8. Cd induced necrotic cell death pathways, although apoptosis was also activated; pre-treatment with L-NAME or rHSP27 mitigated cell death. Our findings show for the first time a direct relationship between Cd-induced toxicity and PN production and a role for rHSP27 as a potential therapeutic agent that may counteract Cd toxicity.

Abstract: The mitochondria-associated ER membrane (MAM) is a specialized subdomain of ER that physically connects with mitochondria. Although disruption of inter-organellar crosstalk via the MAM impairs cellular homeostasis, its pathological significance in insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes mellitus remains unclear. Here, we reveal the importance of reduced MAM formation in the induction of fatty acid–evoked insulin resistance in hepatocytes. Palmitic acid (PA) repressed insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation in HepG2 cells within 12h. Treatment with an inhibitor of the ER stress response failed to restore PA-mediated suppression of Akt activation. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production did not increase in PA-treated cells. Even short-term exposure (3h) to PA reduced the calcium flux from ER to mitochondria, followed by a significant decrease in MAM contact area, suggesting that PA suppressed the functional interaction between ER and mitochondria. Forced expression of mitofusin-2, a critical component of the MAM, partially restored MAM contact area and ameliorated the PA-elicited suppression of insulin sensitivity with Ser473 phosphorylation of Akt selectively improved. These results suggest that loss of proximity between ER and mitochondria, but not perturbation of homeostasis in the two organelles individually, plays crucial roles in PA-evoked Akt inactivation in hepatic insulin resistance.

Abstract: Recent experimental evidences from cellular systems and from mammalian and non-mammalian animal models highlight novel functions for the aryl hydrocarbon/dioxin receptor (AhR) in maintaining cell differentiation and tissue homeostasis. Notably, AhR depletion stimulates an undifferentiated and pluripotent phenotype likely associated to a mesenchymal transition in epithelial cells and to increased primary tumorigenesis and metastasis in melanoma. In this work, we have used a lung model of epithelial regeneration to investigate whether AhR regulates proper tissue repair by adjusting the expansion of undifferentiated stem-like cells. AhR-null mice developed a faster and more efficient repair of the lung bronchiolar epithelium upon naphthalene injury that required increased cell proliferation and the earlier activation of stem-like Clara, Basal and neuroepithelial cells precursors. Increased basal content in multipotent Sca1+/CD31−/CD4− cells and in cells expressing pluripotency factors NANOG and OCT4 could also improve re-epithelialization in AhR-null lungs. The reduced response of AhR-deficient lungs to Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) repression shortly after injury may also help their improved bronchiolar epithelium repair. These results support a role for AhR in the regenerative response against toxins, and open the possibility of modulating its activation level to favor recovery from lesions caused by environmental contaminants.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanisms by which cancer cell-intrinsic CYP monooxygenases promote tumor progression are largely unknown. CYP3A4 was unexpectedly associated with breast cancer mitochondria and synthesized arachidonic acid (AA)-derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which promoted the electron transport chain/respiration and inhibited AMPKα. CYP3A4 knockdown activated AMPKα, promoted autophagy, and prevented mammary tumor formation. The diabetes drug metformin inhibited CYP3A4-mediated EET biosynthesis and depleted cancer cell-intrinsic EETs. Metformin bound to the active-site heme of CYP3A4 in a co-crystal structure, establishing CYP3A4 as a biguanide target. Structure-based design led to discovery of N1-hexyl-N5-benzyl-biguanide (HBB), which bound to the CYP3A4 heme with higher affinity than metformin. HBB potently and specifically inhibited CYP3A4 AA epoxygenase activity. HBB also inhibited growth of established ER+ mammary tumors and suppressed intratumoral mTOR. CYP3A4 AA epoxygenase inhibition by biguanides thus demonstrates convergence between eicosanoid activity in mitochondria and biguanide action in cancer, opening a new avenue for cancer drug discovery.

Abstract: Summary
Rat embryonic stem cells (ESCs) offer the potential for sophisticated genome engineering in this valuable biomedical model species. However, germline transmission has been rare following conventional homologous recombination and clonal selection. Here, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to target genomic mutations and insertions. We first evaluated utility for directed mutagenesis and recovered clones with biallelic deletions in Lef1. Mutant cells exhibited reduced sensitivity to glycogen synthase kinase 3 inhibition during self-renewal. We then generated a non-disruptive knockin of dsRed at the Sox10 locus. Two clones produced germline chimeras. Comparative expression of dsRed and SOX10 validated the fidelity of the reporter. To illustrate utility, live imaging of dsRed in neonatal brain slices was employed to visualize oligodendrocyte lineage cells for patch-clamp recording. Overall, these results show that CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology in germline-competent rat ESCs is enabling for in vitro studies and for generating genetically modified rats.

Abstract: Summary
Targeted covalent small molecules have shown promise for cancers driven by KRAS G12C. Allosteric compounds that access an inducible pocket formed by movement of a dynamic structural element in KRAS, switch II, have been reported, but these compounds require further optimization to enable their advancement into clinical development. We demonstrate that covalent quinazoline-based switch II pocket (SIIP) compounds effectively suppress GTP loading of KRAS G12C, MAPK phosphorylation, and the growth of cancer cells harboring G12C. Notably we find that adding an amide substituent to the quinazoline scaffold allows additional interactions with KRAS G12C, and remarkably increases the labeling efficiency, potency, and selectivity of KRAS G12C inhibitors. Structural studies using X-ray crystallography reveal a new conformation of SIIP and key interactions made by substituents located at the quinazoline 2-, 4-, and 7-positions. Optimized lead compounds in the quinazoline series selectively inhibit KRAS G12C-dependent signaling and cancer cell growth at sub-micromolar concentrations.

Abstract: Summary
Disease sites in atherosclerosis and cancer feature cell masses (e.g., plaques/tumors), a low pH extracellular microenvironment, and various pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα). The ability to engineer a cell to seek TNFα sources allows for targeted therapeutic delivery. To accomplish this, here we introduced a system of proteins: an engineered TNFα chimeric receptor (named TNFR1chi), a previously engineered Ca2+-activated RhoA (named CaRQ), vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein G (VSVG), and thymidine kinase. Upon binding TNFα, TNFR1chi generates a Ca2+ signal that in turn activates CaRQ-mediated non-apoptotic blebs that allow migration toward the TNFα source. Next, the addition of VSVG, upon low pH induction, causes membrane fusion of the engineered and TNFα source cells. Finally, after ganciclovir treatment cells undergo death via the thymidine kinase suicide mechanism. Hence, we assembled a system of proteins that forms the basis of engineering a cell to target inflammatory disease sites characterized by TNFα secretion and a low-pH microenvironment.

Abstract: Summary
Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) provide a platform for studying human development and understanding mechanisms underlying diseases. Retinoblastoma-1 (RB1) is a key regulator of cell cycling, of which biallelic inactivation initiates retinoblastoma, the most common congenital intraocular malignancy. We developed a model to study the role of RB1 in early development and tumor formation by generating RB1-null hESCs using CRISPR/Cas9. RB1−/− hESCs initiated extremely large teratomas, with neural expansions similar to those of trilateral retinoblastoma tumors, in which retinoblastoma is accompanied by intracranial neural tumors. Teratoma analysis further revealed a role for the transcription factor ZEB1 in RB1-mediated ectoderm differentiation. Furthermore, RB1−/− cells displayed mitochondrial dysfunction similar to poorly differentiated retinoblastomas. Screening more than 100 chemotherapies revealed an RB1–/–-specific cell sensitivity to carboplatin, exploiting their mitochondrial dysfunction. Together, our work provides a human pluripotent cell model for retinoblastoma and sheds light on developmental and tumorigenic roles of RB1.

Abstract: Summary
Schwann cells play a crucial role in successful nerve repair and regeneration by supporting both axonal growth and myelination. However, the sources of human Schwann cells are limited both for studies of Schwann cell development and biology and for the development of treatments for Schwann cell-associated diseases. Here, we provide a rapid and scalable method to produce self-renewing Schwann cell precursors (SCPs) from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), using combined sequential treatment with inhibitors of the TGF-β and GSK-3 signaling pathways, and with neuregulin-1 for 18 days under chemically defined conditions. Within 1 week, hPSC-derived SCPs could be differentiated into immature Schwann cells that were functionally confirmed by their secretion of neurotrophic factors and their myelination capacity in vitro and in vivo. We propose that hPSC-derived SCPs are a promising, unlimited source of functional Schwann cells for treating demyelination disorders and injuries to the peripheral nervous system.

Abstract: BPAG1e and Plectin are hemidesmosomal linker proteins which anchor intermediate filament proteins to the cell surface through β4 integrin. Recent reports indicate that these proteins play a role in various cellular processes apart from their known anchoring function. However, the available literature is inconsistent. Further, the previous study from our laboratory suggested that Keratin8/18 pair promotes cell motility and tumor progression by deregulating β4 integrin signaling in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) derived cells. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that linker proteins may have a role in neoplastic progression of OSCC. Downregulation of hemidesmosomal linker proteins in OSCC derived cells resulted in reduced cell migration accompanied by alterations in actin organization. Further, decreased MMP9 activity led to reduced cell invasion in linker proteins knockdown cells. Moreover, loss of these proteins resulted in reduced tumorigenic potential. SWATH analysis demonstrated upregulation of N-Myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) in linker proteins downregulated cells as compared to vector control cells. Further, the defects in phenotype upon linker proteins ablation were rescued upon loss of NDRG1 in linker proteins knockdown background. These data together indicate that hemidesmosomal linker proteins regulate cell motility, invasion and tumorigenicity possibly through NDRG1 in OSCC derived cells.

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that several bacterial species are involved in tumor immunosurveillance and antitumor immunity. The role of bacteria in immune responses in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients is still unknown. In this study, we examined the bacteria-reactive CD8+ T cell response in patients with HBV-related HCC. We found that circulating CD8+ T cells from healthy individuals demonstrated minimal or zero specificity toward a series of commensals and bacteria previously associated with antitumor effects, including Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, Bifidobacterium longum, Bacteroides fragilis, and Enterococcus hirae. In contrast, the circulating CD8+ T cells from HBV-related HCC patients presented significantly elevated bacteria-reactive responses, albeit with high variations among different HCC individuals. Reactivity toward bacteria was also identified in tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. These bacteria-reactive responses were not primarily induced by TLR ligand, but were dependent on the presence of antigen-presenting monocytes, and were MHC class I-restricted. Interestingly, we observed that the CD8+ T cell-to-Foxp3+ regulatory T cell ratio was positively correlated with the proportions of Bifidobacterium longum-reactive and Enterococcus hirae-reactive CD8+ T cells, while the frequency of PD-1+ CD8+ T cells was negatively correlated with the frequency of Enterococcus hirae-reactive CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, the disease-free survival time of HCC patients after tumor resection was positively correlated with the frequencies of Bifidobacterium longum-reactive and Enterococcus hirae-reactive CD8+ T cells. Together, these results suggested that certain bacterial species might present valuable antitumor effects.

Abstract: In response to DNA damage from ultraviolet (UV) radiation, bacteria deploy the SOS response in order to limit cell death. This bacterial SOS response is characterized by an increase in the recA gene that transactivates expression of multiple DNA repair genes. The current series of experiments demonstrate that a mammalian organ system (the cochlea) that is not evolutionarily conditioned to UV radiation can elicit SOS responses that are reminiscent of that of bacteria. This mammalian SOS response is characterized by an increase in the p53 gene with activation of multiple DNA repair genes that harbor p53 response elements in their promoters. Furthermore, the experimental results provide support for the notion of a convergent trigger paradox, where independent SOS triggers facilitate disparate physiologic sequelae (loss vs. recovery of function). Therefore, it is proposed that the mammalian SOS response is multifunctional and manipulation of this endogenous response could be exploited in future biomedical interventions.

Abstract: Chloramphenicol and several other antibiotics targeting bacterial ribosomes inhibit mitochondrial protein translation. Inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis leads to mitonuclear protein imbalance and reduced respiratory rates as confirmed here in HeLa and PC12 cells. Unexpectedly, respiration in INS-1E insulinoma cells and primary human islets was unaltered in the presence of chloramphenicol. Resting respiratory rates and glucose stimulated acceleration of respiration were also not lowered when a range of antibiotics including, thiamphenicol, streptomycin, gentamycin and doxycycline known to interfere with bacterial protein synthesis were tested. However, chloramphenicol efficiently reduced mitochondrial protein synthesis in INS-1E cells, lowering expression of the mtDNA encoded COX1 subunit of the respiratory chain but not the nuclear encoded ATP-synthase subunit ATP5A. Despite a marked reduction of the essential respiratory chain subunit COX1, normal respiratory rates were maintained in INS-1E cells. ATP-synthase dependent respiration was even elevated in chloramphenicol treated INS-1E cells. Consistent with these findings, glucose-dependent calcium signaling reflecting metabolism-secretion coupling in beta-cells, was augmented. We conclude that antibiotics targeting mitochondria are able to cause mitonuclear protein imbalance in insulin secreting cells. We hypothesize that in contrast to other cell types, compensatory mechanisms are sufficiently strong to maintain normal respiratory rates and surprisingly even result in augmented ATP-synthase dependent respiration and calcium signaling following glucose stimulation. The result suggests that in insulin secreting cells only lowering COX1 below a threshold level may result in a measurable impairment of respiration. When focusing on mitochondrial function, care should be taken when including antibiotics targeting translation for long-term cell culture as depending on the sensitivity of the cell type analyzed, respiration, mitonuclear protein imbalance or down-stream signaling may be altered.

Abstract: Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are frequently induced using 3D culture methodologies however, it is unknown whether spheroid-based (3D) neural induction is actually superior to monolayer (2D) neural induction. Our aim was to compare the efficiency of 2D induction with 3D induction method in their ability to generate NPCs, and subsequently neurons and astrocytes. Neural differentiation was analysed at the protein level qualitatively by immunocytochemistry and quantitatively by flow cytometry for NPC (SOX1, PAX6, NESTIN), neuronal (MAP2, TUBB3), cortical layer (TBR1, CUX1) and glial markers (SOX9, GFAP, AQP4). Electron microscopy demonstrated that both methods resulted in morphologically similar neural rosettes. However, quantification of NPCs derived from 3D neural induction exhibited an increase in the number of PAX6/NESTIN double positive cells and the derived neurons exhibited longer neurites. In contrast, 2D neural induction resulted in more SOX1 positive cells. While 2D monolayer induction resulted in slightly less mature neurons, at an early stage of differentiation, the patch clamp analysis failed to reveal any significant differences between the electrophysiological properties between the two induction methods. In conclusion, 3D neural induction increases the yield of PAX6+/NESTIN+ cells and gives rise to neurons with longer neurites, which might be an advantage for the production of forebrain cortical neurons, highlighting the potential of 3D neural induction, independent of iPSCs' genetic background.

Abstract: Summary
A signature characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is aggregation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) fibrils in the brain. Nevertheless, the links between Aβ and AD pathology remain incompletely understood. It has been proposed that neurotoxicity arising from aggregation of the Aβ1-42 peptide can in part be explained by metal ion binding interactions. Using advanced X-ray microscopy techniques at sub-micron resolution, we investigated relationships between iron biochemistry and AD pathology in intact cortex from an established mouse model over-producing Aβ. We found a direct correlation of amyloid plaque morphology with iron, and evidence for the formation of an iron-amyloid complex. We also show that iron biomineral deposits in the cortical tissue contain the mineral magnetite, and provide evidence that Aβ-induced chemical reduction of iron could occur in vivo. Our observations point to the specific role of iron in amyloid deposition and AD pathology, and may impact development of iron-modifying therapeutics for AD.

Abstract: Introduction
Pancreatic pathologies are characterized by a progressive fibrosis process. Pancreatic stellate cells (PSC) play a crucial role in pancreatic fibrogenesis. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress emerges as an important determinant of fibrotic remodeling. Overload of fatty acids (FA), typical to obesity, may lead to lipotoxic state and cellular stress.
Aim
To study the effect of different lipolytic challenges on pancreatic ER stress and PSC activation.
Methods
Primary PSCs were exposed to different FAs, palmitate (pal) and oleate (ole), at pathophysiological concentrations typical to obese state, and in acute caerulein-induced stress (cer). PSC activation and differentiation were analyzed by measuring fat accumulation (oil-red staining and quantitation), proliferation (cells count) and migration (wound- healing assay). PSC differentiation markers (α-sma, fibronectin, tgf-β and collagen secretion), ER stress unfolded protein response and immune indicators (Xbp1, CHOP, TNF-α, IL-6) were analyzed at the transcript and protein expression levels (quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting).
Results
PSC exposure to pal and ole FAs (500µM) increased significantly fat accumulation. Proliferation and migration analysis demonstrated that ole FA retained PSC activation, while exposure to pal FA significantly halted proliferation rate and delayed migration. Cer significantly augmented PSC differentiation markers α- sma, fibronectin and collagen, and ER stress and inflammation markers including Xbp1, CHOP, TNF-α and IL-6. The ole FA treatment significantly elevated PSC differentiation markers α-sma, fibronectin and collagen secretion. PSC ER stress was demonstrated following pal treatment with significant elevation of Xbp1 splicing and CHOP levels.
Conclusion
Exposure to pal FA halted PSC activation and differentiation and elevated ER stress markers, while cer and ole exposure significantly induced activation, differentiation and fibrosis. Thus, dietary FA composition should be considered and optimized to regulate PSC activation and differentiation in pancreatic pathologies.

Abstract: The p.G2019S mutation of the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) has been identified as the most prevalent genetic cause of familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD). The Cre-LoxP recombination system has been used to correct the LRRK2-G2019S mutation in patient derived human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) in order to generate isogenic controls. However, the remaining LoxP site can influence gene expression. In this study, we report the generation of a footprint-free LRRK2-G2019S isogenic hiPS cell line edited with the CRISPR/Cas9 and piggyBac technologies. We observed that the percentage of Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) positive neurons with a total neurite length of >2000μm was significantly reduced in LRRK2-G2019S dopaminergic (DA) neurons. The average branch number in LRRK2-G2019S DA neurons was also decreased. In addition, we have shown that in vitro TH positive neurons with a total neurite length of >2000μm were positive for Serine 129 phosphorylated (S129P) alpha-Synuclein (αS) and we hypothesize that S129P-αS plays a role in the maintenance or formation of long neurites. In summary, our footprint-free LRRK2-G2019S isogenic cell lines allow standardized, genetic background independent, in vitro PD modeling and provide new insights into the role of LRRK2-G2019S and S129P-αS in the pathogenesis of PD.

Abstract: Summary
Scaling of CRISPR-Cas9 technology in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) represents an important step for modeling complex disease and developing drug screens in human cells. However, variables affecting the scaling efficiency of gene editing in hPSCs remain poorly understood. Here, we report a standardized CRISPR-Cas9 approach, with robust benchmarking at each step, to successfully target and genotype a set of psychiatric disease-implicated genes in hPSCs and provide a resource of edited hPSC lines for six of these genes. We found that transcriptional state and nucleosome positioning around targeted loci was not correlated with editing efficiency. However, editing frequencies varied between different hPSC lines and correlated with genomic stability, underscoring the need for careful cell line selection and unbiased assessments of genomic integrity. Together, our step-by-step quantification and in-depth analyses provide an experimental roadmap for scaling Cas9-mediated editing in hPSCs to study psychiatric disease, with broader applicability for other polygenic diseases.

Abstract: Despite benefits of prenatal in utero repair of myelomeningocele, a severe type of spina bifida aperta, many of these patients will still suffer mild to severe impairment. One potential source of stem cells for new regenerative medicine-based therapeutic approaches for spinal cord injury repair is neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). To this aim, we extracted CSF from the cyst surrounding the exposed neural placode during the surgical repair of myelomeningocele in 6 fetuses (20 to 26weeks of gestation). In primary cultured CSF-derived cells, neurogenic properties were confirmed by in vitro differentiation into various neural lineage cell types, and NPC markers expression (TBR2, CD15, SOX2) were detected by immunofluorescence and RT-PCR analysis. Differentiation into three neural lineages was corroborated by arbitrary differentiation (depletion of growths factors) or explicit differentiation as neuronal, astrocyte, or oligodendrocyte cell types using specific induction mediums. Differentiated cells showed the specific expression of neural differentiation markers (βIII-tubulin, GFAP, CNPase, oligo-O1). In myelomeningocele patients, CSF-derived cells could become a potential source of NPCs with neurogenic capacity. Our findings support the development of innovative stem-cell-based therapeutics by autologous transplantation of CSF-derived NPCs in damaged spinal cords, such as myelomeningocele, thus promoting neural tissue regeneration in fetuses.

Abstract: Summary
Many viral RNAs are modified by methylation of the N6 position of adenosine (m6A). m6A is thought to regulate RNA splicing, stability, translation, and secondary structure. Influenza A virus (IAV) expresses m6A-modified RNAs, but the effects of m6A on this segmented RNA virus remain unclear. We demonstrate that global inhibition of m6A addition inhibits IAV gene expression and replication. In contrast, overexpression of the cellular m6A “reader” protein YTHDF2 increases IAV gene expression and replication. To address whether m6A residues modulate IAV RNA function in cis, we mapped m6A residues on the IAV plus (mRNA) and minus (vRNA) strands and used synonymous mutations to ablate m6A on both strands of the hemagglutinin (HA) segment. These mutations inhibited HA mRNA and protein expression while leaving other IAV mRNAs and proteins unaffected, and they also resulted in reduced IAV pathogenicity in mice. Thus, m6A residues in IAV transcripts enhance viral gene expression.

Abstract: Trabecular meshwork (TM) cells are the governing regulators of the TM structure. When the functionality of these cells is impaired, the structure of the TM is perturbed which often results in increased ocular hypertension. High intraocular pressure is the most significant risk factor for steroid-induced glaucoma. Dexamethasone (Dex)-induced phenotype of TM cells is widely utilized as a model system to gain insight into mechanisms underlying damaged TM in glaucoma. In this study, to assess the possible role of abnormal Wnt signaling in steroid-induced glaucoma, we analyzed the effects of small-molecule Wnt signaling modulators on Dex-induced expression extracellular matrix proteins of primary human TM cells. While Dex-treated TM cells exhibited increased collagen and fibronectin expression, we found that Wnt signaling inhibitor 3235-0367 suppressed these Dex-induced effects. We therefore propose that Wnt signaling plays an important role in Dex-mediated impairment of TM cell functions. Moreover, the use of small-molecule Wnt signaling inhibitors to treat TM cells may provide an opportunity of restoring TM tissue in steroid-induced glaucoma.

Abstract: Summary
The N-terminal half of adenovirus e1a assembles multimeric complexes with host proteins that repress innate immune responses and force host cells into S-phase. In contrast, the functions of e1a’s C-terminal interactions with FOXK, DCAF7, and CtBP are unknown. We found that these interactions modulate RAS signaling, and that a single e1a molecule must bind all three of these host proteins to suppress activation of a subset of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). These ISGs were otherwise induced in primary respiratory epithelial cells at 12 hr p.i. This delayed activation of ISGs required IRF3 and coincided with an ∼10-fold increase in IRF3 from protein stabilization. The induced IRF3 bound to chromatin and localized to the promoters of activated ISGs. While IRF3, STAT1/2, and IRF9 all greatly increased in concentration, there were no corresponding mRNA increases, suggesting that e1a regulates the stabilities of these key activators of innate immune responses, as shown directly for IRF3.

Abstract: Summary
Our understanding of the spatial variation in the chemical and microbial makeup of an entire human organ remains limited, in part due to the size and heterogeneity of human organs and the complexity of the associated metabolome and microbiome. To address this challenge, we developed a workflow to enable the cartography of metabolomic and microbiome data onto a three-dimensional (3D) organ reconstruction built off radiological images. This enabled the direct visualization of the microbial and chemical makeup of a human lung from a cystic fibrosis patient. We detected host-derived molecules, microbial metabolites, medications, and region-specific metabolism of medications and placed it in the context of microbial distributions in the lung. Our tool further created browsable maps of a 3D microbiome/metabolome reconstruction map on a radiological image of a human lung and forms an interactive resource for the scientific community.

Abstract: Summary
Regulatory dendritic cell (DCregs)-based immunotherapy is a potential therapeutic tool for transplant rejection. We generated DCregs from murine induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which could remain in a “stable immature stage” even under strong stimulation. Harnessing this characteristic, we hypothesized that iPS-DCregs worked as a negative vaccine to generate regulatory T cells (Tregs), and induced donor-specific allograft acceptance. We immunized naive CBA (H-2Kk) mice with B6 (H-2Kb) iPS-DCregs and found that Tregs (CD4+CD25+FOXP3+) significantly increased in CBA splenocytes. Moreover, immunized CBA recipients permanently accepted B6 cardiac grafts in a donor-specific pattern. We demonstrated mechanistically that donor-type iPS-DCregs triggered transforming growth factor β1 secretion, under which the donor-antigen peptides directed naive CD4+ T cells to differentiate into donor-specific FOXP3+ Tregs instead of into effector T cells in vivo. These findings highlight the potential of iPS-DCregs as a key cell therapy resource in clinical transplantation.

Abstract: The findings of this study suggest that the phosphoinositide phosphatase Sac3 maintains the protein level of scavenger receptor A (SR-A) and regulates foam cell formation. RAW264.7 macrophages were transfected with short hairpin RNAs that target Sac3. The knockdown decreased the level of the cell surface SR-A and suppressed the acetylated low density lipoprotein-induced foam cell formation. The associated regulator of PIKfyve (ArPIKfyve) is a scaffold protein that protects Sac3 from proteasome-dependent degradation. The knockdown of ArPIKfyve decreased Sac3, cell surface SR-A, and foam cell formation. The knockdown of PIKfyve had no effect on SR-A protein levels. These results suggest that the ArPIKfyve-Sac3 complex regulates SR-A protein levels independently of its effect on PIKfyve activity.

Abstract: Anticancer therapy based on recombinant arginine-degrading enzymes has been proposed for the treatment of several types of malignant cells deficient in arginine biosynthesis. One of the predicted side effects of such therapy is restricted bioavailability of nitric oxide as arginine catabolic product. Prolonged NO limitation may lead to unwanted disturbances in NO-dependent vasodilation, cardiovascular and immune systems. This problem can be overcome by co-supplementation with exogenous NO donor. However, NO may potentially counteract anticancer effects of therapy based on arginine deprivation. In this study, we evaluate for the first time the effects of an exogenous NO donor, sodium nitroprusside, on viability and metastatic properties of two human melanoma cell lines SK-MEL-28 and WM793 under arginine-deprived conditions. It was revealed that NO did not rescue melanoma cells from specific effects evoked by arginine deprivation, namely decreased viability and induction of apoptosis, dramatically reduced motility, invasiveness and clonogenic potential. Moreover, sodium nitroprusside co-treatment augmented several of these antineoplastic effects. We report that a combination of NO-donor and arginine deprivation strongly and specifically impaired metastatic behavior of melanoma cells. Thus, sodium nitroprusside can be considered as an adjuvant for the more efficient treatment of malignant melanoma and possibly other tumors with arginine-degrading enzymes.

Abstract: NLRP3 inflammasome is a cytoplasmic multiprotein complex which plays a critical role in response to infection or injury, however, aberrant NLRP3 inflammasome activation is deleterious. In our study, we investigate the inhibitory effect of X-11-5-27, a daidzein derivative, on the NLRP3 inflammasome. The results showed that the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome was inhibited by X-11-5-27 in a dose-dependent manner, followed by a decrease in the cleavage of caspase-1 and maturation of IL-1β. Furthermore, we found that X-11-5-27 significantly restrained the formation of NLRP3 inflammasome. At the same time, X-11-5-27 time- and dose-dependently decreased the production of ROS and superoxide. In addition, X-11-5-27 enhanced the activity of SOD to scavenge ROS release. This inhibitory effect of X-11-5-27 was due to the protection of mitochondrial homeostasis and was abolished after the treatment of rotenone. Notably, X-11-5-27 was found to trigger autophagy in macrophages, which in turn inhibited the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Moreover, the phosphorylation states of the proteins in PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway were dramatically decreased after X-11-5-27 treatment. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that autophagy-mediated ROS reduction is responsible for X-11-5-27-induced NLRP3 flammasome inactivation. And these results may help guide decisions regarding the use of X-11-5-27 in relieving the inflammasome-driven hyper-inflammation.

Abstract: Transdifferentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) promotes the development of vascular calcifications such as arteriosclerosis. The aim was to investigate effects of specific extracellular matrix (ECM) components on transdifferentiation of VSMC to identify novel ECM-based therapeutic tools. Human collagens I & IV (CI, CIV) along with collagen XIV (CXIV) and a CXIV-derived fragment (CXIV-F), both of which induce differentiation, were applied in an in-vitro model of calcium-/phosphate (Ca/P)-induced osteochondrocytic transdifferentiation of human and murine VSMC. Transdifferentiation was determined by RT-PCR and calcium contents of VSMC cultures. Signaling pathways involved were determined by western-blot and luciferase reporter plasmid assays. Under normal culture conditions, CI induced VSMC proliferation and a more epithelioid/synthetic phenotype while CIV and predominantly CXIV provoked opposite effects. CIV and CXIV further blocked Ca/P-induced osteochondrocytic transdifferentiation of VSMC displayed e.g. by reduced gene expressions of Runx2, Sox9, osterix and increased expressions of αSMA and SM22α. This involved impaired activation of ERK1/2, NF-ĸB and Wnt-signaling. Similar preventive effects were achieved by applying CXIV-F. Impaired preventive effects of CXIV by co-treatment with a cluster of differentiation (CD)44 agonist propose CD44 as a CXIV-target structure on VSMC. In conclusion, CXIV and CXIV-F interfere with osteochondrocytic transdifferentiation of VSMC and should be further explored as potential therapeutic tools in vascular calcification.

Abstract: Aberrant activation of beta-catenin/TCF signaling is one of the hallmarks of colon cancer. It is of great interest to study the mechanism for the regulation of beta-catenin/TCF signaling. In this study, it was found that LRP1B was down-regulated in colon cancer tissues and inhibited the growth, migration and metastasis of colon cancer cells. The molecular mechanism study revealed that LRP1B interacted with DVL2, inhibited the interaction between DVL2 and Axin, and negatively regulated beta-catenin/TCF signaling. Taken together, our study demonstrated the suppressive roles of LRP1B in the progression of colon cancer, implicating that restoring the function of LRP1B would be a promising strategy for the treatment of colon cancer.

Abstract: Myogenesis is a highly regulated multi-step process involving myoblast proliferation and differentiation. Although studies over the last decades have identified several factors governing these distinct major phases, many of them are not yet known. In order to identify novel genes, we took advantage of the C2C12 myoblastic line to establish a functional siRNA screen combined with quantitative-imaging analysis of a large amount of differentiated myoblasts. We knocked down 100 preselected mouse genes without a previously characterized role in muscle. Using image analysis, we tracked gene-silencing phenotypes by quantitative assessment of cellular density, myotube quantity, myotube morphology and fusion index. Our results have revealed six genes involved in both stages of C2C12 myogenesis and 13 genes specific to the differentiation stage. These findings prove that our RNAi-based screen could be an efficient tool to detect clear and subtle phenotypes allowing the identification of new myogenic regulators in mammals.

Abstract: Summary
Breast-fed infants generally have a bifidobacteria-rich microbiota with recent studies indicating that human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) selectively promote bifidobacterial growth. Bifidobacterium bifidum possesses a glycoside hydrolase family 20 lacto-N-biosidase for liberating lacto-N-biose I from lacto-N-tetraose, an abundant HMO unique to human milk, while Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum has a non-classified enzyme (LnbX). Here, we determined the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of LnbX and provide evidence for creation of a novel glycoside hydrolase family, GH136. The structure, in combination with inhibition and mutation studies, provides insight into the molecular mechanism and broader substrate specificity of this enzyme. Moreover, through genetic studies, we show that lnbX is indispensable for B. longum growth on lacto-N-tetraose and is a key genetic factor for persistence in the gut of breast-fed infants. Overall, this study reveals possible evolutionary routes for the emergence of symbiosis between humans and bifidobacterial species in the infant gut.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) has both positive and negative roles in human disease. In certain cancers, TNF-α is infused locally to promote tumor regression, but dose-limiting inflammatory effects limit broader utility. In autoimmune disease, anti-TNF-α antibodies control inflammation in most patients, but these benefits are offset during chronic treatment. TAK1 acts as a key mediator between survival and cell death in TNF-α-mediated signaling. Here, we describe Takinib, a potent and selective TAK1 inhibitor that induces apoptosis following TNF-α stimulation in cell models of rheumatoid arthritis and metastatic breast cancer. We demonstrate that Takinib is an inhibitor of autophosphorylated and non-phosphorylated TAK1 that binds within the ATP-binding pocket and inhibits by slowing down the rate-limiting step of TAK1 activation. Overall, Takinib is an attractive starting point for the development of inhibitors that sensitize cells to TNF-α-induced cell death, with general implications for cancer and autoimmune disease treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Default differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells has been promoted as a model of cortical development. In this study, a developmental transcriptome analysis of default-differentiated hPSNs revealed a gene expression program resembling in vivo CGE/LGE subpallial domains and GABAergic signaling. A combination of bioinformatic, functional, and immunocytochemical analysis further revealed that hPSNs consist of both cortical glutamatergic and CGE-like GABAergic neurons. This study provides a comprehensive characterization of the heterogeneous group of neurons produced by default differentiation and insight into future directed differentiation strategies.

Abstract: Summary
In skeletal muscle, new functions for vessels have recently emerged beyond oxygen and nutrient supply, through the interactions that vascular cells establish with muscle stem cells. Here, we demonstrate in human and mouse that endothelial cells (ECs) and myogenic progenitor cells (MPCs) interacted together to couple myogenesis and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo during skeletal muscle regeneration. Kinetics of gene expression of ECs and MPCs sorted at different time points of regeneration identified three effectors secreted by both ECs and MPCs. Apelin, Oncostatin M, and Periostin were shown to control myogenesis/angiogenesis coupling in vitro and to be required for myogenesis and vessel formation during muscle regeneration in vivo. Furthermore, restorative macrophages, which have been previously shown to support myogenesis in vivo, were shown in a 3D triculture model to stimulate myogenesis/angiogenesis coupling, notably through Oncostatin M production. Our data demonstrate that restorative macrophages orchestrate muscle regeneration by controlling myogenesis/angiogenesis coupling.

Abstract: Summary
The acylphloroglucinol myrtucommulone A (MC) causes mitochondrial dysfunctions by direct interference leading to apoptosis in cancer cells, but the molecular targets involved are unknown. Here, we reveal the chaperonin heat-shock protein 60 (HSP60) as a molecular target of MC that seemingly modulates HSP60-mediated mitochondrial functions. Exploiting an unbiased, discriminative protein fishing approach using MC as bait and mitochondrial lysates from leukemic HL-60 cells as target source identified HSP60 as an MC-binding protein. MC prevented HSP60-mediated reactivation of denatured malate dehydrogenase in a protein refolding assay. Interference of MC with HSP60 was accompanied by aggregation of two proteins in isolated mitochondria under heat shock that were identified as Lon protease-like protein (LONP) and leucine-rich PPR motif-containing protein (LRP130). Together, our results reveal HSP60 as a direct target of MC, proposing MC as a valuable tool for studying HSP60 biology and for evaluating its value as a target in related diseases, such as cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Adriamycin-based combination chemotherapy is the standard first-line treatment for osteosarcoma, but tumor recurrence and metastasis occurs in most cases. Recent evidence suggests that microenvironmental stress such as chemotherapy can lead to the enrichment of cancer stem cells (CSCs), which result in cancer metastasis, recurrence, and drug resistance. However, the exact mechanisms underlying this phenomenon and how to target CSCs are still open questions. Herein, we report that Adriamycin treatment induces a stem-like phenotype and promotes metastatic potential in osteosarcoma cells through upregulating KLF4. KLF4 knockdown blocks Adriamycin-induced stemness phenotype and metastasis capacity. We further screen that statins remarkably reverse Adriamycin-induced CSC properties and metastasis by downregulating KLF4. Most strikingly, simvastatin severely impaired Adriamycin-enhanced tumorigenesis of KHOS/NP cells in vivo. These data suggest that Adriamycin-based chemotherapeutics may simulate CSCs through activation of KLF4 signaling and that selective inhibition of KLF4 with statins should be considered in the development of osteosarcoma therapeutics.

Abstract: In glaucoma, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are exposed to ischemic stress with elevation of the intraocular pressure and are subsequently lost. Necroptosis, a type of regulated necrosis, is known to play a pivotal role in this loss. We observed that receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), the key player of necroptosis, was activated by diverse ischemic stresses, including TCZ, chemical hypoxia (CH), and oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD). In this study, we introduce a RIPK1-inhibitory compound (RIC) with a novel scaffold. RIC inhibited downstream events following RIPK1 activation, including necrosome formation and mitochondrial dysfunction in RGC5 cells. Moreover, RIC protected RGCs against ischemic injury in the rat glaucoma model, which was induced by acute high intraocular pressure. However, RIC displayed biochemical characteristics that are distinct from those of previous RIPK1 inhibitors (necrostatin-1; Nec-1 and Compound 27; Cpd27). RIC protected RGCs against OGD insult, while Nec-1 and Cpd27 did not. Conversely, Nec-1 and Cpd27 protected RGCs from TNF-stimulated death, while RIC failed to inhibit the death of RGCs. This implies that RIPK1 activates alternative pathways depending on the context of the ischemic insults.

Abstract: Previous studies have proven that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and its receptor agonist exert favorable anabolic effects on skeletal metabolism. However, whether GLP-1 could directly impact osteoblast-mediated bone formation is still controversial, and the underlying molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated. Thus in this paper, we investigated the effects of liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, on murine MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts proliferation and differentiation and explored the potential cellular basis. Our study confirmed the presence of GLP-1R in MC3T3-E1, and demonstrated that liraglutide promotes osteoblasts proliferation at an intermediate concentration (100nM) and time (48h), upregulated the expression of osteoblastogenic biomarkers at various stages, and stimulated osteoblastic mineralization. Liraglutide also elevated the intracellular cAMP level and phosphorylation of AKT, ERK and β-catenin simultaneously with increased nuclear β-catenin content and transcriptional activity. Pretreatment of cells with the inhibitors LY294002, PD98059, H89 and GLP-1R and β-catenin siRNA partially blocked the liraglutide-induced signaling activation and attenuated the facilitating effect of liraglutide on MC3T3-E1 cells. Collectively, liraglutide was capable of acting upon osteoblasts directly through GLP-1R by activating PI3K/AKT, ERK1/2, cAMP/PKA/β-cat-Ser675 signaling to promote bone formation via GLP-1R. Thus, GLP-1 analogues may be potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of osteoporosis in diabetics.

Abstract: Ascorbate-induced release of heparan sulfate from S-nitrosylated heparan sulfate proteoglycan glypican-1 takes place in endosomes. Heparan sulfate penetrates the membrane and is transported to the nucleus. This process is dependent on copper and on expression and processing of the amyloid precursor protein. It remains unclear how exogenously supplied ascorbate can generate HS-anMan in endosomes and how passage through the membrane is facilitated. Here we have examined wild-type, Alzheimer Tg2576 and amyloid precursor protein (-/-) mouse fibroblasts and human fetal and Niemann-Pick C1 fibroblasts by using deconvolution immunofluorescence microscopy, siRNA technology and [S35]sulfate-labeling, vesicle isolation and gel chromatography. We found that ascorbate-induced release of heparan sulfate was dependent on expression of endosomal cytochrome b561. Formation and nuclear transport of heparan sulfate was suppressed by inhibition of β-processing of the amyloid precursor protein and formation was restored by copper (I) ions. Membrane penetration was not dependent on amyloid beta channel formation. Inhibition of endosomal exit resulted in accumulation of heparan sulfate in vesicles that exposed the C-terminal of the amyloid precursor protein externally. Endosome-to-nucleus transport was also dependent on expression of the Niemann-Pick C1 protein. We propose that ascorbate is taken up from the medium and is oxidized by cytochrome b561 which, in turn, reduces copper (II) to copper (I) present in the N-terminal, β-cleaved domain of the amyloid precursor protein. Re-oxidation of copper (I) is coupled to reductive, deaminative release of heparan sulfate from glypican-1. Passage through the membrane may be facilitated by the C-terminal, β-cleaved fragment of the amyloid precursor protein and the Niemann-Pick C1 protein.

Abstract: Depressed Na+/K+-ATPase activity has long been reported to be involved in diabetic-related cardiomyocyte death and cardiac dysfunction. However, the nature of directly regulating Na+-K+-ATPase in diabetic-related myocardial diseases remains unknown. Hyperglycemia is believed as one of major factors responsible for diabetic-related myocardial apoptosis and dysfunction. In this study, whether inhibiting Na+-K+-ATPase by ouabain or activating Na+-K+-ATPase by DRm217 has functions on high glucose (HG) -induced myocardial injury was investigated. Here we found that addition of DRm217 or ouabain to HG-treated cells had opposite effects. DRm217 decreased but ouabain increased HG-induced cell injury and apoptosis. This was mediated by changing Na+-K+-ATPase activity and Na+-K+-ATPase cell surface expression. The inhibition of Na+-K+-ATPase endocytosis alleviated HG-induced ROS accumulation. Na+-K+-ATPase·c-Src dependent NADPH oxidase/ROS pathway was also involved in the effects of ouabain and DRm217 on HG-induced cell injury. These novel results may help us to understand the important role of the Na+-K+-ATPase in diabetic cardiovascular diseases.

Abstract: Filamin A (FLNA) is actin filament cross-linking protein involved in cancer progression. Its importance in regulating cell motility is directly related to the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) of tumor cells. However, little is known about the mechanism of action of FLNA at this early stage of cancer invasion. Using immunochemical methods, we evaluated the levels and localization of FLNA, pFLNA[Ser2152], β1 integrin, pβ1 integrin[Thr788/9], FAK, pFAK[Y379], and talin in stably transfected HT29 adenocarcinoma cells overexpressing Snail and looked for the effect of Snail in adhesion and migration assays on fibronectin-coated surfaces before and after FLNA silencing. Our findings indicate that FLNA upregulation correlates with Snail-induced EMT in colorectal carcinoma. FLNA localizes in the cytoplasm and at the sites of focal adhesion (FA) of invasive cells. Silencing of FLNA inhibits Snail-induced cell adhesion, reduces the size of FA sites, induces the relocalization of talin from the cytoplasm to the membrane area and augments cell migratory properties. Our findings suggest that FLNA may not act as a classic integrin inhibitor in invasive carcinoma cells, but is involved in other pro-invasive pathways. FLNA upregulation, which correlates with cell metastatic properties, maybe an additional target for combination therapy in colorectal carcinoma tumor progression.

Abstract: Evidence demonstrate that p53 mutations and microRNAs (miRs) are important components of 5-FU resistance in colorectal cancer (CRC). miR-338-3p has been reported associated with cancer prognosis. However whether or not it influences chemotherapy sensitivity and the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated. Here, three types of human colon cancer cell lines, HT29 (mutant p53), HCT116 (wild-type p53), and HCT116 p53-/- (deficient p53), were treated with 5-FU. We showed that expression of miR-338-3p was correlated with apoptosis and 5-FU resistance in colon cancer cells. Ectopic expression of miR-338-3p conferred resistance to 5-FU in HCT116 cells. Further experiments indicated that miR-338-3p mediated 5-FU resistance through down-regulation of mTOR expression. Moreover, inhibition of miR-338-3p in HT29 and HCT116 p53-/- cells increased their sensitivity to 5-FU treatment. Furthermore, we detected autophagy changes in our experiment because mTOR was known prominently regulating autophagy and the competition between autophagy and apoptosis in response to 5-FU was a mechanism influencing 5-FU sensitivity. Our results reveal a critical and novel role of miR-338-3p in the correlation of 5-FU resistance with p53 status. Moreover, the miR-338-3p inhibitor has the potential to overcome 5-FU resistance in p53 mutant colon cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
Cultured neural stem/precursor cells (NSCs) are regarded as a potential systematic cell source to treat Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the therapeutic potential of these cultured NSCs is lost during culturing. Here, we show that treatment of vitamin C (VC) enhances generation of authentic midbrain-type dopamine (mDA) neurons with improved survival and functions from ventral midbrain (VM)-derived NSCs. VC acted by upregulating a series of mDA neuron-specific developmental and phenotype genes via removal of DNA methylation and repressive histone code (H3K9m3, H3K27m3) at associated gene promoter regions. Notably, the epigenetic changes induced by transient VC treatment were sustained long after VC withdrawal. Accordingly, transplantation of VC-treated NSCs resulted in improved behavioral restoration, along with enriched DA neuron engraftment, which faithfully expressed midbrain-specific markers in PD model rats. These results indicate that VC treatment to donor NSCs could be a simple, efficient, and safe therapeutic strategy for PD in the future.

Abstract: Summary
HIV-1 entry into host cells starts with interactions between the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env) and cellular CD4 receptors and coreceptors. Previous work has suggested that efficient HIV entry also depends on intracellular signaling, but this remains controversial. Here we report that formation of the pre-fusion Env-CD4-coreceptor complexes triggers non-apoptotic cell surface exposure of the membrane lipid phosphatidylserine (PS). HIV-1-induced PS redistribution depends on Ca2+ signaling triggered by Env-coreceptor interactions and involves the lipid scramblase TMEM16F. Externalized PS strongly promotes Env-mediated membrane fusion and HIV-1 infection. Blocking externalized PS or suppressing TMEM16F inhibited Env-mediated fusion. Exogenously added PS promoted fusion, with fusion dependence on PS being especially strong for cells with low surface density of coreceptors. These findings suggest that cell-surface PS acts as an important cofactor that promotes the fusogenic restructuring of pre-fusion complexes and likely focuses the infection on cells conducive to PS signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Efficient methodologies for recreating cancer-associated chromosome translocations are in high demand as tools for investigating how such events initiate cancer. The CRISPR/Cas9 system has been used to reconstruct the genetics of these complex rearrangements at native loci while maintaining the architecture and regulatory elements. However, the CRISPR system remains inefficient in human stem cells. Here, we compared three strategies aimed at enhancing the efficiency of the CRISPR-mediated t(11;22) translocation in human stem cells, including mesenchymal and induced pluripotent stem cells: (1) using end-joining DNA processing factors involved in repair mechanisms, or (2) ssODNs to guide the ligation of the double-strand break ends generated by CRISPR/Cas9; and (3) all-in-one plasmid or ribonucleoprotein complex-based approaches. We report that the generation of targeted t(11;22) is significantly increased by using a combination of ribonucleoprotein complexes and ssODNs. The CRISPR/Cas9-mediated generation of targeted t(11;22) in human stem cells opens up new avenues in modeling Ewing sarcoma.

Abstract: Cigarette smoking is one of the most important risk factors of atherosclerosis, which can induce endothelial injury. Meanwhile, adipocytes are the main cell type of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), the largest endocrine and paracrine organ and direct anatomical connection to adventitia, which may play a key role in the injury of endothelial cells. We used nicotine to induce dysfunctional HUVECs and adipocytes. In addition, we used a novel model to co-culture HUVECs and adipocytes in vitro by the transwell co-culture system to determine the effect of adipocytes on endothelial injury. Cell apoptosis was detected by Annexin V-FITC. Genes and proteins involved in the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway were detected by qRT-PCR and western blot analysis, respectively. We also investigated the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 using immunofluorescence staining. Our results showed that nicotine dose-dependently induces the apoptosis of HUVECs and adipocytes and is associated with increased IKKβ and NF-κB p65 expression and with IkBα degradation. Meanwhile through the co-culture system, adipocytes promoted the expression of IKKβ and NF-κB p65, as well as the translocation of NF-κB p65, and they accelerated the degradation of IkBα, resulting in increased apoptosis of HUVECs compared with that of the single cultured system. In conclusion, adipocytes could promote endothelial injury via the NF-κB pathway. Moreover, the NF-κB pathway plays pivotal roles in nicotine-induced vascular injury.

Abstract: Summary
The advent of large-scale in vitro differentiation of human stem cell-derived insulin-producing cells (SCIPC) has brought us closer to treating diabetes using stem cell technology. However, decades of experiences from islet transplantation show that ischemia-induced islet cell death after transplant severely limits the efficacy of the therapy. It is unclear to what extent human SCIPC are susceptible to ischemia. In this study, we show that more than half of SCIPC die shortly after transplantation. Nutrient deprivation and hypoxia acted synergistically to kill SCIPC in vitro. Amino acid supplementation rescued SCIPC from nutrient deprivation, likely by providing cellular energy. Generating SCIPC under physiological oxygen tension of 5% conferred hypoxia resistance without affecting their differentiation or function. A two-pronged strategy of physiological oxygen acclimatization during differentiation and amino acid supplementation during transplantation significantly improved SCIPC survival after transplant.

Abstract: Summary
The molecular mechanism of memory formation remains a mystery. Here, we show that TERT, the catalytic subunit of telomerase, gene knockout (Tert−/−) causes extremely poor ability in spatial memory formation. Knockdown of TERT in the dentate gyrus of adult hippocampus impairs spatial memory processes, while overexpression facilitates it. We find that TERT plays a critical role in neural development including dendritic development and neuritogenesis of hippocampal newborn neurons. A monosynaptic pseudotyped rabies virus retrograde tracing method shows that TERT is required for neural circuit integration of hippocampal newborn neurons. Interestingly, TERT regulated neural development and spatial memory formation in a reverse transcription activity-independent manner. Using X-ray irradiation, we find that hippocampal newborn neurons mediate the modulation of spatial memory processes by TERT. These observations reveal an important function of TERT through a non-canonical pathway and encourage the development of a TERT-based strategy to treat neurological disease-associated memory impairment.

Abstract: Low shear stress (LSS)-induced endothelial inflammation is the basis for the development of atherosclerosis. However, the mechanism underlying LSS-induced inflammation is not well understood. The angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R), a component of the renin-angiotensin system, participates in atherosclerotic plaque progression. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of AT1R in LSS-induced endothelial activation. Using immunohistochemistry, we noted significant increases in AT1R, vascular endothelial adhesion cell-1 (VCAM1), and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1) expression in the inner curvature of the aortic arch in C57BL/6 mice compared to the descending aorta in these mice. Moreover, western blotting revealed that these LSS-induced increases in AT1R, ICAM1 and VCAM1 expression were time dependent. However, the expression of these proteins was significantly abolished by treatment with the AT1R antagonist Losartan (1μM) or AT1R small interfering RNA (siRNA). AT1R inhibition significantly suppressed extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK) upregulation, which also resulted in decreases in ICAM1 and VCAM1 protein expression. These findings demonstrate that LSS induces endothelial inflammation via AT1R/ERK signaling and that Losartan has beneficial effects on endothelial inflammation.

Abstract: Hypoxic conditions are common in solid tumors and have a significant effect on tumor progression, therapeutic and prognosis. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are longer than 200 nucleotides and cannot be translated into proteins, which play important roles in some diseases including cancer. Although previous analysis have showed that long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA)-p21 is hypoxia-responsive and functions as a new regulator of cell cycle, apoptosis and warburg effect in cervical cancer, its biological roles in hypoxic hepatoma and glioma are unknown. In this work, we found that X-ray irradiation or hypoxia treatment elevated lincRNA-p21 expression in SMMC7721 hepatoma and U251MG glioma cells. Knockdown of lincRNA-p21 induced G2/M phase arrest, promoted apoptosis, decreased cell proliferation and motility, and reduced autophagy through HIF-1/Akt/mTOR/P70S6K pathway in hypoxic tumor cells. Our results delineated a novel mechanism of lincRNA-p21 in enhancing hypoxic tumor cell radiosensitivity, which might provide valuable targets for radiation therapy for solid tumors, such as hepatoma and glioma.

Abstract: Summary
Cisplatin holds an illustrious position in the history of chemistry most notably for its role in the virtual cure of testicular cancer. Here we describe a role for this small molecule in cyanide detoxification in vivo. Cyanide kills organisms as diverse as insects, fish, and humans within seconds to hours. Current antidotes exhibit limited efficacy and are not amenable to mass distribution requiring the development of new classes of antidotes. The binding affinity of the cyanide anion for the positively charged metal platinum is known to create an extremely stable complex in vitro. We therefore screened a panel of diverse cisplatin analogs and identified compounds that conferred protection from cyanide poisoning in zebrafish, mice, and rabbits. Cumulatively, this discovery pipeline begins to establish the characteristics of platinum ligands that influence their solubility, toxicity, and efficacy, and provides proof of concept that platinum-based complexes are effective antidotes for cyanide poisoning.

Abstract: Summary
Arenaviruses such as Lassa virus (LASV) cause hemorrhagic fever. Terminal shock is associated with a systemic cytokine storm, but the mechanisms are ill defined. Here we used HLA-A2-expressing mice infected with a monkey-pathogenic strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV-WE), a close relative of LASV, to investigate the pathophysiology of arenavirus hemorrhagic fever (AHF). AHF manifested as pleural effusions, edematous skin swelling, and serum albumin loss, culminating in hypovolemic shock. A characteristic cytokine storm included numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide (NO) metabolites. Edema formation and terminal shock were abrogated in mice lacking inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), although the cytokine storm persisted. iNOS was upregulated in the liver in a T cell- and interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-dependent fashion. Accordingly, blockade of IFN-γ or depletion of T cells repressed hepatic iNOS and prevented disease despite unchecked high-level viremia. We identify the IFN-γ-iNOS axis as an essential and potentially druggable molecular pathway to AHF-induced shock.

Abstract: Summary
Choline is an essential nutrient and methyl donor required for epigenetic regulation. Here, we assessed the impact of gut microbial choline metabolism on bacterial fitness and host biology by engineering a microbial community that lacks a single choline-utilizing enzyme. Our results indicate that choline-utilizing bacteria compete with the host for this nutrient, significantly impacting plasma and hepatic levels of methyl-donor metabolites and recapitulating biochemical signatures of choline deficiency. Mice harboring high levels of choline-consuming bacteria showed increased susceptibility to metabolic disease in the context of a high-fat diet. Furthermore, bacterially induced reduction of methyl-donor availability influenced global DNA methylation patterns in both adult mice and their offspring and engendered behavioral alterations. Our results reveal an underappreciated effect of bacterial choline metabolism on host metabolism, epigenetics, and behavior. This work suggests that interpersonal differences in microbial metabolism should be considered when determining optimal nutrient intake requirements.

Abstract: Summary
Riboswitches are bacterial-specific, broadly conserved, non-coding RNA structural elements that control gene expression of numerous metabolic pathways and transport functions essential for cell growth. As such, riboswitch inhibitors represent a new class of potential antibacterial agents. Recently, we identified ribocil-C, a highly selective inhibitor of the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) riboswitch that controls expression of de novo riboflavin (RF, vitamin B2) biosynthesis in Escherichia coli. Here, we provide a mechanistic characterization of the antibacterial effects of ribocil-C as well as of roseoflavin (RoF), an antimetabolite analog of RF, among medically significant Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococcus faecalis. We provide genetic, biophysical, computational, biochemical, and pharmacological evidence that ribocil-C and RoF specifically inhibit dual FMN riboswitches, separately controlling RF biosynthesis and uptake processes essential for MRSA growth and pathogenesis. Such a dual-targeting mechanism is specifically required to develop broad-spectrum Gram-positive antibacterial agents targeting RF metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Naked mole rats (NMRs) are exceptionally long-lived, cancer-resistant rodents. Identifying the defining characteristics of these traits may shed light on aging and cancer mechanisms. Here, we report the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from NMR fibroblasts and their contribution to mouse-NMR chimeric embryos. Efficient reprogramming could be observed under N2B27+2i conditions. The iPSCs displayed a characteristic morphology, expressed pluripotent markers, formed embryoid bodies, and showed typical differentiation patterns. Interestingly, NMR embryonic fibroblasts and the derived iPSCs had propensity for a tetraploid karyotype and were resistant to forming teratomas, but within mouse blastocysts they contributed to both interspecific placenta and fetus. Gene expression patterns of NMR iPSCs were more similar to those of human than mouse iPSCs. Overall, we uncovered unique features of NMR iPSCs and report a mouse-NMR chimeric model. The iPSCs and associated cell culture systems can be used for a variety of biological and biomedical applications.

Abstract: Summary
Patients with non-small cell lung cancers that have kinase-activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are highly responsive to first- and second-generation EGFR inhibitors. However, these patients often relapse due to a secondary, drug-resistant mutation in EGFR whereby the gatekeeper threonine is converted to methionine (T790M). Several third-generation EGFR inhibitors have been developed that irreversibly inactivate T790M-EGFR while sparing wild-type EGFR, thus reducing epithelium-based toxicities. Using chemical proteomics, we show here that individual T790M-EGFR inhibitors exhibit strikingly distinct off-target profiles in human cells. The FDA-approved drug osimertinib (AZD9291), in particular, was found to covalently modify cathepsins in cell and animal models, which correlated with lysosomal accumulation of the drug. Our findings thus show how chemical proteomics can be used to differentiate covalent kinase inhibitors based on global selectivity profiles in living systems and identify specific off-targets of these inhibitors that may affect drug activity and safety.

Abstract: Summary
Pluripotent cells emanate from the inner cell mass (ICM) of the blastocyst and when cultivated under optimal conditions immortalize as embryonic stem cells (ESCs). The fundamental mechanism underlying ESC derivation has, however, remained elusive. Recently, we have devised a highly efficient approach for establishing ESCs, through inhibition of the MEK and TGF-β pathways. This regimen provides a platform for dissecting the molecular mechanism of ESC derivation. Via temporal gene expression analysis, we reveal key genes involved in the ICM to ESC transition. We found that DNA methyltransferases play a pivotal role in efficient ESC generation. We further observed a tight correlation between ESCs and preimplantation epiblast cell-related genes and noticed that fundamental events such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition blockage play a key role in launching the ESC self-renewal program. Our study provides a time course transcriptional resource highlighting the dynamics of the gene regulatory network during the ICM to ESC transition.

Abstract: Summary
Reprogramming somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is a long and inefficient process. A thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying reprogramming is paramount for efficient generation and safe application of iPSCs in medicine. While intensive efforts have been devoted to identifying reprogramming facilitators and barriers, a full repertoire of such factors, as well as their mechanistic actions, is poorly defined. Here, we report that NAC1, a pluripotency-associated factor and NANOG partner, is required for establishment of pluripotency during reprogramming. Mechanistically, NAC1 is essential for proper expression of E-cadherin by a dual regulatory mechanism: it facilitates NANOG binding to the E-cadherin promoter and fine-tunes its expression; most importantly, it downregulates the E-cadherin repressor ZEB1 directly via transcriptional repression and indirectly via post-transcriptional activation of the miR-200 miRNAs. Our study thus uncovers a previously unappreciated role for the pluripotency regulator NAC1 in promoting efficient somatic cell reprogramming.

Abstract: Summary
Intestinal organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are valuable in vitro research models that enable simplified access to human gastrointestinal tissues. Here, we report the in vitro generation of enterospheres (hEnS) from hPSC-derived gastrointestinal epithelial precursors. hEnS are cystic spheroids with a simple uniform structure composed entirely of intestinal epithelium. hEnS express markers of mature brush border cells and share a transcriptome profile similar to that of more mature intestinal organoids. Modulation of signaling cues enables control of hEnS growth and differentiation, including long-term propagation. We show that hEnS can be exploited for functional studies: hEnS display an innate immune response when treated with enteric pathogens, and transgenic modification of hEnS with a fluorescence cell-cycle reporter enables hEnS-forming stem cell enrichment. Our work establishes hEnS as an accessible and tractable in vitro modeling system for studying human gastrointestinal biology.

To establish a stronger experimental basis for such a correlation we subjected five different cancer cell lines of well-defined metastatic potential to a sequence of three independent assays reporting on three different aspects of cell dynamics, namely (1) the kinetics of cell spreading, (2) cell shape fluctuations, and (3) cell migration. The sequentially applied assays correspond to different measuring modes of the well-established ECIS technique that is based on non-invasive and label-free impedance readings of planar gold-film electrodes that serve as the growth substrate for the cells under study. Every individual assay returned a characteristic parameter describing the behavior of the cell lines in that particular assay quantitatively. The parameters of all three assays were ranked to establish individual profiles of cell dynamics for every cell line that correlate favorably with the cells’ invasive properties. The sequence of impedance-based assays described here requires only small cell populations (< 10.000 cells), it is highly automated and easily adapted to 96-well formats. It provides an in-depth dynamic profile of adherent cells that might be useful in other areas besides cancer research as well.

Abstract: Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy, high homocysteine) induces the injury of endothelial cells (ECs). Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) protects ECs and inhibits the activation of platelets. Calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) regulates the production of endogenous H2S. However, whether CaSR inhibits the injury of ECs and the activation of platelets by regulating the endogenous cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CSE, a major enzyme that produces H2S)/H2S pathway in hyperhomocysteinemia has not been previously investigated. Here, we tested the ultrastructure alterations of ECs and platelets, the changes in the concentration of serum homocysteine and the parameters of blood of hyperhomocysteinemia rats were measured. The aggregation rate and expression of P-selectin of platelets were assessed. Additionally, the expression levels of CaSR and CSE in the aorta of rats were examined by western blotting. The mitochondrial membrane potential and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured; the expression of phospho-calmodulin kinases II (p-CaMK II) and Von Willebrand Factor (vWF) of cultured ECs from rat thoracic aortas were measured. We found that the aggregation rate and the expression of P-selectin of platelets increased, and the expression of CaSR and CSE decreased in HHcy rats. In the ECs of HHcy group, the ROS production increased and the mitochondrial membrane potential decreased markedly, the expression of CSE and the p-CaMK II increased after treatment with CaSR agonist while decreased upon administration of U73122 (PLC-specific inhibitor) and 2-APB (IP3 Receptor inhibitor). CaSR agonist or NaHS significantly reversed the ECs injured and platelet aggregation caused by hyperhomocysteinemia. Our results demonstrate that CaSR regulates the endogenous CSE/H2S pathway to inhibit the activation of platelets which concerts the protection of ECs in hyperhomocysteinemia.

Abstract: Summary
Although Zika virus (ZIKV)-induced congenital disease occurs more frequently during early stages of pregnancy, its basis remains undefined. Using established type I interferon (IFN)-deficient mouse models of ZIKV transmission in utero, we found that the placenta and fetus were more susceptible to ZIKV infection at earlier gestational stages. Whereas ZIKV infection at embryonic day 6 (E6) resulted in placental insufficiency and fetal demise, infections at midstage (E9) resulted in reduced cranial dimensions, and infection later in pregnancy (E12) caused no apparent fetal disease. In addition, we found that fetuses lacking type III IFN-λ signaling had increased ZIKV replication in the placenta and fetus when infected at E12, and reciprocally, treatment of pregnant mice with IFN-λ2 reduced ZIKV infection. IFN-λ treatment analogously diminished ZIKV infection in human midgestation fetal- and maternal-derived tissue explants. Our data establish a model of gestational stage dependence of ZIKV pathogenesis and IFN-λ-mediated immunity at the maternal-fetal interface.

Abstract: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a common metabolic disease worldwide. It has been reported that irisin play regulatory role in glucose metabolism in T2DM. However, the underlying mechanism involved in that is not completely known. Herein, we determined the novel role of β-arrestin-2 in irisin-induced glucose utilization in diabetes. Effects of irisin and β-arrestin-2 on glucose utilization were investigated in a rat model of diabetes and in diabetic C2C12 cells in vitro. Results showed that irisin had positive role in glucose metabolism via regulating glucose tolerance as well as uptake in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues, as evidenced by IPGTT, 2-deoxyglucose uptake and plasma membrane GLUT-4 assay. β-arrestin-2 also improved glucose utilization in diabetes by increasing the glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity, as shown in mice overexpressing β-arrestin-2. In diabetic C2C12 myocytes, irisin-induced GLUT4 and glucose uptake were restrained by β-arrestin-2 inhibition, but was enhanced by β-arrestin-2 overexpression. Additionally, irisin and β-arrestin-2 increased the activation of p38 MAPK in diabetic C2C12 cells, and the repression of p38 MAPK activation decreased the glucose uptake and plasma membrane GLUT-4 was enhanced by irisin and β-arrestin-2 overexpression in diabetic C2C12 cells. In conclusion, we demonstrated that β-arrestin-2 has a crucial role in irisin induced glucose metabolism in T2DM by regulating the p38 MAPK signaling. This might present a novel therapeutic target of treatment for human diabetes.

Abstract: Microtentacles are thin, flexible cell protrusions that have recently been described and whose presence enhances efficient attachment of circulating cells. They are found on circulating tumor cells and can be induced on a wide range of breast cancer cell lines, where they are promoted by factors that either stabilize microtubules or destabilize the actin cytoskeleton. Evidence suggests that they are relevant to the metastatic spread of cancer, so understanding their structure and formation may lead to useful therapies. Microtentacles are formed by microtubules and contain vimentin intermediate filaments, but beyond this, there is little information about their ultrastructure. We have used electron microscopy of high pressure frozen sections and tomography of cryo-prepared intact cells, along with super resolution fluorescence microscopy, to provide the first ultrastructural insights into microtubule and intermediate filament arrangement within microtentacles. By scanning electron microscopy it was seen that microtentacles form within minutes of addition of drugs that stabilize microtubules and destabilize actin filaments. Mature microtentacles were found to be well below one micrometer in diameter, tapering gradually to below 100nm at the distal ends. They also contained frequent branches and bulges suggestive of heterogeneous internal structure. Super resolution fluorescence microscopy and examination of sectioned samples showed that the microtubules and intermediate filaments can occupy different areas within the microtentacles, rather than interacting intimately as had been expected. Cryo-electron tomography of thin regions of microtentacles revealed densely packed microtubules and absence of intermediate filaments. The number of microtubules ranged from several dozen in some areas to just a few in the thinnest regions, with none of the regular arrangement found in axonemes. Improved understanding of the mechanism of microtentacle formation, as well as the resultant structure, will be valuable in developing therapies against metastasis, if the hypothesized role of microtentacles in metastasis is confirmed. This work provides a significant step in this direction.

Abstract: The sea urchin larval embryo elaborates two calcitic endoskeletal elements called spicules. Spicules are synthesized by the primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs) and begin to form at early gastrula stage. It is known that the calcium comprising the spicules comes from the seawater and we wish to further consider the mode of calcium transport from the extracellular seawater to the PMCs and then onto the forming spicules. We used PMC in vitro cultures, calcein, fluorescently labeled dextran, and fluorescently labeled Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA) to track calcium transport from the seawater into PMCs and spicules and to determine how molecules from the surface of PMCs interact with the incoming calcium. Labeling of PMC endocytic vesicles and forming spicules by both calcein and fluorescently tagged dextran indicate that calcium is taken up from the seawater by endocytosis and directly incorporated into spicules. Calcein labeling studies also indicate that calcium from the extracellular seawater begins to be incorporated into spicules within 30min of uptake. In addition, we demonstrate that fluorescently labeled WGA and calcein are taken up by many of the same endocytic vesicles and are incorporated into growing spicules. These findings suggest that PMC specific surface molecules accompany calcium ions as they enter PMCs via endocytosis and are incorporated together in the growing spicule. Using anti-spicule matrix protein antibodies, we pinpoint a subset of spicule matrix proteins that may accompany calcium ions from the surface of the PMCs until they are incorporated into spicules. Msp130 is identified as one of these spicule matrix proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Reprogramming somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offers the possibility of studying the molecular mechanisms underlying human diseases in cell types difficult to extract from living patients, such as neurons and cardiomyocytes. To date, studies have been published that use small panels of iPSC-derived cell lines to study monogenic diseases. However, to study complex diseases, where the genetic variation underlying the disorder is unknown, a sizable number of patient-specific iPSC lines and controls need to be generated. Currently the methods for deriving and characterizing iPSCs are time consuming, expensive, and, in some cases, descriptive but not quantitative. Here we set out to develop a set of simple methods that reduce cost and increase throughput in the characterization of iPSC lines. Specifically, we outline methods for high-throughput quantification of surface markers, gene expression analysis of in vitro differentiation potential, and evaluation of karyotype with markedly reduced cost.

Abstract: Summary
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a deadly malignancy due to its tendency to metastasize and resistance to chemotherapy. Stem-like tumor cells often confer these aggressive behaviors. We discovered an endoglin (CD105)-expressing subpopulation in human RCC xenografts and patient samples with a greater capability to form spheres in vitro and tumors in mice at low dilutions than parental cells. Knockdown of CD105 by short hairpin RNA and CRISPR/cas9 reduced stemness markers and sphere-formation ability while accelerating senescence in vitro. Importantly, downregulation of CD105 significantly decreased the tumorigenicity and gemcitabine resistance. This loss of stem-like properties can be rescued by CDA, MYC, or NANOG, and CDA might act as a demethylase maintaining MYC and NANOG. In this study, we showed that Endoglin (CD105) expression not only demarcates a cancer stem cell subpopulation but also confers self-renewal ability and contributes to chemoresistance in RCC.

Abstract: It is estimated that abnormal accumulation of all-trans-retinal (atRAL) is a leading cause of photoreceptor degeneration in retinal degenerative diseases. Deficiency of interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP), a retinoid transporter in the visual cycle, is responsible for the impaired clearance of atRAL and results in atRAL toxicity in retina. Therefore, IRBP has been proposed to be a potent target in preventing atRAL-induced photoreceptor degeneration. In this study, the neuroprotective effect of tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) against atRAL toxicity in the differentiated Y-79 cells, a in vitro model of photoreceptor, was first investigated. Our findings showed that atRAL could induce cytotoxicity, oxidative/nitrosative stresses, apoptosis and leukostasis in the differentiated Y-79 cells; however, the pre-treatment of TMP significantly attenuated such effects in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, our results indicated that TMP exerted its neuroprotective effect mainly through upregulating IRBP expression. The present study significantly contributes to better understanding the important role of IRBP in retinal degenerative diseases and forms the basis of the therapeutic development of TMP in such diseases in the future.

Abstract: Summary
The methionine 1 (M1)-specific deubiquitinase (DUB) OTULIN acts as a negative regulator of nuclear factor κB signaling and immune homeostasis. By replacing Gly76 in distal ubiquitin (Ub) by dehydroalanine we designed the diubiquitin (diUb) activity-based probe UbG76Dha-Ub (OTULIN activity-based probe [ABP]) that couples to the catalytic site of OTULIN and thereby captures OTULIN in its active conformation. The OTULIN ABP displays high selectivity for OTULIN and does not label other M1-cleaving DUBs, including CYLD. The only detectable cross-reactivities were the labeling of USP5 (Isopeptidase T) and an ATP-dependent assembly of polyOTULIN ABP chains via Ub-activating E1 enzymes. Both cross-reactivities were abolished by the removal of the C-terminal Gly in the ABP's proximal Ub, yielding the specific OTULIN probe UbG76Dha-UbΔG76 (OTULIN ABPΔG76). Pull-downs demonstrate that substrate-bound OTULIN associates with the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC). Thus, we present a highly selective ABP for OTULIN that will facilitate studying the cellular function of this essential DUB.

Abstract: LAG3 is a surface molecule found on a subset of immune cells. The precise function of LAG3 appears to be context-dependent. In this study, we investigated the effect of LAG3 on CD4+CD25- T cells from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. We found that in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of NSCLC patients, LAG3 was significantly increased in CD4+ T cells directly ex vivo and primarily in the CD4+CD25- fraction, which was regulated by prolonged TCR stimulation and the presence of IL-27. TCR stimulation also increased CD25 expression, but not Foxp3 expression, in LAG3-expressing CD4+CD25- cells Compared to LAG3-nonexpressing CD4+CD25- cells, LAG3-expressing CD4+CD25- cells presented significantly higher levels of PD1 and TIM3, two inhibitory receptors best described in exhausted CD8+ T effector cells. LAG3-expressing CD4+CD25- cells also presented impaired proliferation compared with LAG3-nonexpressing CD4+CD25- cells but could be partially rescued by inhibiting both PD1 and TIM3. Interestingly, CD8+ T cells co-incubated with LAG3-expressing CD4+CD25- cells at equal cell numbers demonstrated significantly lower proliferation than CD8+ T cells incubated alone. Co-culture with CD8+ T cell and LAG3-expressing CD4+CD25- T cell also upregulated soluble IL-10 level in the supernatant, of which the concentration was positively correlated with the number of LAG3-expressing CD4+CD25- T cells. In addition, we found that LAG3-expressing CD4+CD25- T cells infiltrated the resected tumors and were present at higher frequencies of in metastases than in primary tumors. Taken together, these data suggest that LAG3-expressing CD4+CD25- T cells represent another regulatory immune cell type with potential to interfere with anti-tumor immunity.

Abstract: Summary
The intracellular bacteria Legionella pneumophila encodes a type IV secretion system (T4SS) that injects effector proteins into macrophages in order to establish and replicate within the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV). Once generated, the LCV interacts with mitochondria through unclear mechanisms. We show that Legionella uses both T4SS-independent and T4SS-dependent mechanisms to respectively interact with mitochondria and induce mitochondrial fragmentation that ultimately alters mitochondrial metabolism. The T4SS effector MitF, a Ran GTPase activator, is required for fission of the mitochondrial network. These effects of MitF occur through accumulation of mitochondrial DNM1L, a GTPase critical for fission. Furthermore mitochondrial respiration is abruptly halted in a T4SS-dependent manner, while T4SS-independent upregulation of cellular glycolysis remains elevated. Collectively, these alterations in mitochondrial dynamics promote a Warburg-like phenotype in macrophages that favors bacterial replication. Hence the rewiring of cellular bioenergetics to create a replication permissive niche in host cells is a virulence strategy of L. pneumophila.

Abstract: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the key organelle involved in protein folding and maturation. Emerging studies implicate the role of ER stress in the development of chronic kidney disease. Thus, there is an urgent need for compounds that could ameliorate ER stress and prevent CKD. Piperine and its analogs have been reported to exhibit multiple pharmacological activities; however, their efficacy against ER stress in kidney cells has not been studied yet. Hence, the goal of this study was to synthesize amide-substituted piperine analogs and screen them for pharmacological activity to relieve ER stress using an in vitro model of tunicamycin-induced ER stress using normal rat kidney (NRK-52E) cells. Five amide-substituted piperine analogs were synthesized and their chemical structures were elucidated by pertinent spectroscopic techniques. An in vitro model of ER stress was developed using tunicamycin, and the compounds of interest were screened for their effect on cell viability, and the expression of ER chaperone GRP78, the pro-apoptotic ER stress marker CHOP, and apoptotic caspases 3 and 12 (via western blotting). Our findings indicate that exposure to tunicamycin (0.5 μg/mL) for 2 h induces the expression of GRP78 and CHOP, and apoptotic markers (caspase-3 and caspase-12) and causes a significant reduction in renal cell viability. Pre-treatment of cells with piperine and its cyclohexylamino analog decreased the tunicamycin-induced upregulation of GRP78 and CHOP and cell death. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that piperine and its analogs differentially regulate ER stress, and thus represent potential therapeutic agents to treat ER stress-related renal disorders. Graphical AbstractPiperine (PIP) reduces the expression of ER stress markers (GRP78 and CHOP) induced by pathologic stimuli and consequently decreases the activation of apoptotic caspase-12 and caspase-3; all of which contributes to its chemical chaperone and cytoprotective properties to protect renal cells against ER stress and ER stress-induced cell death, and would ultimately prevent the development of chronic kidney diseaseGraphical Abstract

Abstract: Summary
Skin microbiota can impact allergic and autoimmune responses, wound healing, and anti-microbial defense. We investigated the role of skin microbiota in cutaneous leishmaniasis and found that human patients infected with Leishmania braziliensis develop dysbiotic skin microbiota, characterized by increases in the abundance of Staphylococcus and/or Streptococcus. Mice infected with L. major exhibit similar changes depending upon disease severity. Importantly, this dysbiosis is not limited to the lesion site, but is transmissible to normal skin distant from the infection site and to skin from co-housed naive mice. This observation allowed us to test whether a pre-existing dysbiotic skin microbiota influences disease, and we found that challenging dysbiotic naive mice with L. major or testing for contact hypersensitivity results in exacerbated skin inflammatory responses. These findings demonstrate that a dysbiotic skin microbiota is not only a consequence of tissue stress, but also enhances inflammation, which has implications for many inflammatory cutaneous diseases.

Abstract: Objectives
The role and underlying mechanism of miR-186-5p in colorectal cancer remain unknown. The present study aims to examine the various cellular effects of miR-186-5p in the carcinogenesis of colorectal cancer. Also, the interacting targets and association of clinicopathological factors with miR-186-5p expression in patients with colorectal cancer were analysed.
Methods
The miR-186-5p expression levels in colorectal cancer tissues (n=126) and colon cancer cell lines (n=3) were analysed by real-time PCR. Matched non-neoplastic colorectal tissues and a non-neoplastic colonic epithelial cell line were used as controls. Various in vitro assays such as cell proliferation, wound healing and colony formation assays were performed to examine the miR-186-5p specific cellular effects. Western blots and immunohistochemistry analysis were performed to examine the modulation of FAM134B, PARP9 and KLF7 proteins expression.
Results
Significant high expression of miR-186-5p was noted in cancer tissues (p< 0.001) and cell lines (p<0.05) when compared to control tissues and cells. The majority of the patients with colorectal cancer (88/126) had shown overexpression of miR-186-5p. This miR-186-5p overexpression was predominantly noted with in cancer with distant metastasis (p=0.001), lymphovascular permeation (p=0.037), microsatellite instability (MSI) stable (p=0.015), in distal colorectum (p=0.043) and with associated adenomas (p=0.047). Overexpression of miR-186-5p resulted in increased cell proliferation, colony formation, wound healing capacities and induced alteration of cell cycle kinetics in colon cancer cells. On the other hand, inhibition of endogenous miR-186-5p reduced the cancer growth properties. miR-186-5p overexpression reduced FAM134B expression significantly in the cancer cells (p<0.01). Also, FAM134B and miR-186-5p expressions are inversely correlated in colorectal cancer tissues and cells.
Conclusion
The miR-186-5p expression promotes colorectal cancer pathogenesis by regulating tumour suppressor FAM134B. Reduced cancer cells growth followed by inhibition of miR-186-5p highlights the potential of miR-186-5p inhibitor as a novel strategy for targeting colorectal cancer initiation and progression.

Abstract: Summary
Crohn's disease (CD) is characterized by the expansion of mesenteric fat, also known as “creeping fat.” We explored the plasticity and immune properties of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) in the context of CD as potential key players in the development of creeping fat. Mesenteric CD-derived ASCs presented a more proliferative, inflammatory, invasive, and phagocytic phenotype than equivalent cells from healthy donors, irrespective of the clinical stage. Remarkably, ASCs from the subcutaneous depot of patients with CD also showed an activated immune response that was associated with a reduction in their immunosuppressive properties. The invasive phenotype of mesenteric CD ASCs was governed by an inflammasome-mediated inflammatory state since blocking inflammasome signaling, mainly the secretion of interleukin-1β, reversed this characteristic. Thus, CD alters the biological functions of ASCs as adipocyte precursors, but also their immune properties. Selection of ASCs with the best immunomodulatory properties is advocated for the success of cell-based therapies.

Abstract: JMJD2A is a JmjC histone demethylase that catalyzes the demethylation of di- and trimethylated Lys9 and Lys36 in histone H3 (H3K9me2/3 and H3K36me2/3). The role of spinal JMJD2A-dependent histone demethylation in nociception hypersensitivity development remains elusive. Here we reported that the JMJD2A responded to neuropathic pain and participated in the maintenance of neuropathic pain. The mRNA and protein levels of Jmjd2a were significantly increased in the neurons of mouse undergoing neuropathic pain induced by sciatic nerve chronic constrictive injury (CCI) or unilateral spared nerve injury (SNI). Jmjd2a responded to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and promoted the expression of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf), which is a protein critically involved in neuropathic pain. JMJD2A bound to the promoter of Bdnf and demethylated H3K9me3 and H3K36me3 at Bdnf promoter to promote the expression of Bdnf. Finally, we showed that JMJD2A promoted the expression of Bdnf during neuropathic pain and neuron-specific knockout of Jmjd2a blocked the hypersensitivity of mice undergoing chronic neuropathic pain induced by CCI and SNI. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that up-regulation of JMJD2A promotes neuropathic pain and it may serve as a promising target for treatment of chronic neuropathic pain.
