Abstract: Based on a microarray study, which demonstrated the upregulation of Sp6 transcriptional factor in iron deficient rat duodenum, we reasoned that SP6 could regulate iron absorption by controlling the expression of iron absorption genes (Collins,2006). For that, we generated Sp6 specific intestinal knockout mice. Our data suggest a lack of transcriptional upregulation of Sp6 in mice in conditions where iron absorption is promoted (phlebotomy, iron deficiency, hpx mouse), and an absence of iron-related phenotype in Sp6 intestinal knockout model. We propose that other Sp6 orthologues may be involved in the genetic response to increase iron absorption, possibly in co-operation with hypoxia inducible factor 2 alpha (HIF-2α)—a newly discovered regulator of iron absorption.

Abstract: During erythroid development, the embryonic ε-globin gene becomes silenced as erythropoiesis shifts from the yolk sac to the fetal liver where γ-globin gene expression predominates. Previous studies have shown that the ε-globin gene is autonomously silenced through promoter proximal cis-acting sequences in adult erythroid cells. We have shown a role for the methylcytosine binding domain protein 2 (MBD2) in the developmental silencing of the avian embryonic ρ-globin and human fetal γ-globin genes. To determine the roles of MBD2 and DNA methylation in human ε-globin gene silencing, transgenic mice containing all sequences extending from the 5′ hypersensitive site 5 (HS5) of the β-globin locus LCR to the human γ-globin gene promoter were generated. These mice show correct developmental expression and autonomous silencing of the transgene. Either the absence of MBD2 or treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azacytidine increases ε-globin transgene expression by 15–20 fold in adult mice. Adult mice containing the entire human β-globin locus also show an increase in expression of both the ε-globin gene transgene and endogenous εY and βH1 genes in the absence of MBD2. These results indicate that the human ε-globin gene is subject to multilayered silencing mediated in part by MBD2.

Abstract: Background
To investigate the relationship between chemokines and cytokines and osteonecrosis in Gaucher disease, we conducted multiplex assays in a cohort of 100 adult patients.
Methods
Mean age was 45years (18–86); 92 Gaucher patients received imiglucerase (median duration 8years (2–18)). Forty-three had experienced osteonecrosis (ON), and eight had ON despite enzyme therapy. Serum cytokines/chemokines were determined by fluorimetric bead arrays in samples from Gaucher patients and healthy volunteers (10 males and 10 females). Intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation were 2%–9.8% and 5.6%–15%, respectively.
Results
VEGF and CCL5/RANTES did not differ between Gaucher and control samples. Concentrations of CCL3/MIP-1α, CCL4/MIP-1β, CCL2/MCP-1, CXCL8/IL-8, IL-1ra and CCL18/PARC were elevated in Gaucher patients (p<0.05 for each). Median CCL4/MIP-1β, CXCL8/IL-8, CCL5/RANTES and CCL18/PARC concentrations were greater in the 43 osteonecrosis patients (88.6pg/mL, 30.5pg/mL, 89.6ng/mL and 434ng/mL, respectively) compared with the 57 patients who had no evidence of osteonecrosis (medians of 59.4, 13.3, 62.7 and 283, respectively, p<0.05). Moreover, the eight patients with ON despite imiglucerase had median concentrations of CCL3/MIP-1α, CCL4/MIP-1β, CXCL8/IL-8, CCL5/RANTES and CCL18/PARC (73.2, 120.9, 36.3pg/mL, 105 and 767ng/mL, respectively), which significantly exceeded the values in 84 patients now free of ON (52.3, 71.2, 16.5pg/mL, 69.5 and 315ng/mL, respectively, p<0.05). Treatment exposures were similar.
Conclusion
Numerous serum cytokines are elevated in Gaucher disease. CCL18/PARC, CCL3/MIP-1α, CCL4/MIP-1β, CCL5/RANTES and CXCL8/IL-8 are potential biomarkers of osteonecrosis and may allow prediction of this disabling complication.

Migration of epithelial cells on laminins: RhoA antagonizes directionally persistent migration,

Abstract: Spatial and temporal expression of laminin isoforms is assumed to provide specific local information to neighboring cells. Here, we report the remarkably selective presence of LM-111 at the very tip of hair follicles where LM-332 is absent, suggesting that epithelial cells lining the dermal-epidermal junction at this location may receive different signals from the two laminins. This hypothesis was tested in vitro by characterizing with functional and molecular assays the comportment of keratinocytes exposed to LM-111 and LM-332. The two laminins induced morphologically distinct focal adhesions, and LM-332, but not LM-111, elicited persistent migration of keratinocytes. The different impact on cellular behavior was associated with distinct activation patterns of Rho GTPases and other signaling intermediates. In particular, while LM-111 triggered a robust activation of Cdc42, LM-332 provoked a strong and sustained activation of FAK. Interestingly, activation of Rac1 was necessary but not sufficient to promote migration because there was no directed migration on LM-111 despite Rac1 activation. In contrast, RhoA antagonized directional migration, since silencing of RhoA by RNA interference boosted unidirectional migration on LM-332. Molecular analysis of the role of RhoA strongly suggested that the mechanisms involve disassembly of cell-cell contacts, loss of the cortical actin network, mobilization of α6β4 integrin out of stable adhesions, and displacement of the integrin from its association with the insoluble pool of intermediate filaments.

Abstract: Purpose
Investigate the incidence of Parkinsonism among patients with Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1) and describe demographics, genotypes, and Gaucher disease (GD)-related characteristics for affected and non-affected patients.
Methods
Study type: Cohort study with age- and gender-matched nested case–control analysis. Calculation of event incidence, standardized morbidity ratio, and event-free survival (Kaplan–Meier). Data source: The International Collaborative Gaucher Group (ICGG) Gaucher Registry data as of June 2010. Study cohort: GD1 patients with any report of Parkinsonism. Pre-matching control group: All GD1 patients with no report of Parkinsonism.
Results
The matched study cohort comprised of 68 patients with reports of Parkinsonism and 649 patients without Parkinsonism. Demographic and clinical characteristics suggest a milder GD phenotype in patients with Parkinsonism compared to the control group. The most prevalent GD1 genotype was N370S/N370S (39% for controls; 46% for patients with Parkinsonism). Patients with Parkinsonism were diagnosed with GD1 at a mean age of 37years compared to 31years in control patients. The standardized morbidity ratio for the development of Parkinsonism among all GD1 patients indicated an approximately 6 to 17 fold increase over that of 2 reference populations. The mean age of reported Parkinsonism onset was 57years compared to 60years in the general population (Lees, Hardy, and Revesz, 2009 [1]). The probability that a patient with GD1 will develop Parkinsonism before age 70years is 5 to 7% and 9 to 12% before age 80years.
Conclusions
The incidence of Parkinsonism among GD1 patients is significantly increased compared to two reference populations. GD1 patients with Parkinsonism have a later median age at GD diagnosis, later age at the start of treatment, and later age at death than patients with GD1 alone. The Gaucher-related clinical profile of GD1 patients with Parkinsonism is similar to or milder than the GD1 alone group. Therefore, severity of the common GD1 clinical manifestations does not appear to be predictive for the onset of Parkinsonism.

Abstract: In Iran, the prevalence of beta-thalassemia trait is approximately 4–8% in most areas, and in Mazandaran province 10% of the population are carriers. Twenty four beta-globin gene mutations were identified in 1635 persons with beta-thalassemia trait using reverse dot blot and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The predominant mutations included IVSII-1 (G-A) (61%), codon 30 (G-C) (7.5%), codon 22 (−7bp) (6.2%), codon 8 (−AA) (5.4%) and IVSI-5 (G-C) (3.6%). These mutations were in different haplotypes, with IVSII-1 being the most heterogeneous. Other less frequent mutations included IVS-II-745 (C-G), codon 44 (−C), codon 39 (C-T), codon 5 (−CT), IVS I-110 (G-A), IVSI-130 (G-C), Fr8/9 (+G), IVSI-1 (G-A), and IVSI (−25bp). All rare mutations except IVSI-130 were encountered in a unique haplotype. The diversity of these mutations reflects the historical admixture of genes in the region. The high prevalence of IVSII-1 (G-A) compared to other parts of the country and the world suggests a founder effect. Our data provide a basis for genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis.

Plectin interacts with the rod domain of type III intermediate filament proteins desmin and vimentin,

Abstract: Plectin is a versatile cytolinker protein critically involved in the organization of the cytoskeletal filamentous system. The muscle-specific intermediate filament (IF) protein desmin, which progressively replaces vimentin during differentiation of myoblasts, is one of the important binding partners of plectin in mature muscle. Defects of either plectin or desmin cause muscular dystrophies. By cell transfection studies, yeast two-hybrid, overlay and pull-down assays for binding analysis, we have characterized the functionally important sequences for the interaction of plectin with desmin and vimentin. The association of plectin with both desmin and vimentin predominantly depended on its fifth plakin repeat domain and downstream linker region. Conversely, the interaction of desmin and vimentin with plectin required sequences contained within the segments 1A–2A of their central coiled-coil rod domain. This study furthers our knowledge of the interaction between plectin and IF proteins important for maintenance of cytoarchitecture in skeletal muscle. Moreover, binding of plectin to the conserved rod domain of IF proteins could well explain its broad interaction with most types of IFs.

Abstract: Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is usually classified as mild, moderate or severe using conventional features, namely, hemoglobin (Hb) concentration, reticulocyte count and bilirubin levels, which do not always contribute to an adequate clinical classification. The aim of our study was to establish the importance of some laboratory routine parameters, as markers of HS clinical outcome, by studying a control group (n=26) and unsplenectomized HS patients (n=82) presenting mild, moderate or severe HS. We performed a basic hematologic study and evaluated the reticulocyte count, bilirubin, erythropoietin (EPO) and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) levels; the osmotic fragility (OFT) and criohemolysis tests (CHT); the ratios Hb/MCHC (mean cell hemoglobin concentration), Hb/RDW (red cell distribution width) and MCHC/RDW, were calculated. Hb changed significantly in accordance with HS severity, but not reticulocytes or bilirubin. We found that MCHC, RDW, EPO, sTfR, OFT, CHT and the calculated ratios were significantly changed in patients, and, therefore, were valuable as complementary diagnostic tools for HS. Moreover, RDW, Hb/MCHC, Hb/RDW and MCHC/RDW changed significantly with worsening of HS; thus, they are also good markers for the clinical outcome of HS. In conclusion, we propose the use of these routine parameters as useful to complement the analysis of HS severity.

Glucocorticoid receptor is indispensable for physiological responses to aldosterone in epithelial Na+ channel induction via the mineralocorticoid receptor in a human colonic cell line,

Abstract: The epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) plays a crucial role in electrogenic Na+ absorption in the distal colon. ENaC induction via the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is differentially regulated by modulatory components. As most existing epithelial cell lines including colonic epithelial cell lines miss the co-expression of functional GR and MR, signaling on ENaC is only poorly characterized regarding the interplay of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. In the present study, we show that GR expression and activity are indispensable for MR-dependent induction of ENaC-mediated Na+ transport. Cooperativity of the two receptors has been studied in the highly differentiated, epithelial colonic cell line HT-29/B6-GR/MR which is equipped with the complete receptor repertoire of both GR and MR due to stable transfection. In contrast to HT-29/B6 cells solely expressing the MR, this cell line displays a physiological response to aldosterone regarding ENaC induction. To achieve this, a pre-incubation step with the GR agonist dexamethasone was required to allow for the subsequent stimulation of ENaC by aldosterone. As a result of cooperative effects between the activated GR and the MR, MR protein levels were elevated and MR-dependent transcription of ENaC subunits β and γ was increased. As an additional mechanism involved, transcription of SGK-1 (serum- and glucocorticoid-induced kinase 1) and GILZ (glucocorticoid-induced leucin zipper) – both essential for the insertion of ENaC into the apical enterocyte membrane – were also augmented by the activated MR.

Abstract: Glycine receptor (GlyR) activation by glycine protects cells against ATP depletion. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To define signaling pathways responsible for the GlyR mediated cytoprotection, we examined the phosphorylation status of key kinases signaling pathways in Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Our results indicated that growing the ATP-depleted MDCK cells in glycine-containing media increased the level of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), Ets-like transcription factor-1 (Elk1), AKT, and Forkhead box O-class 1 (FoxO1), decreased the level of phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, while having little effect on the phosphorylation status of c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 and 2. Similar phosphorylation changes in these molecules took place in the GlyRα1 stably expressing HEK-293 cell. We also showed that treating MDCK cells with ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 or AKT inhibitor LY294002 diminished cytoprotection against cell death by glycine, as determined by assessment of lactate dehydrogenase release and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide activity. In contrast, treatment with p38 inhibitor SB203580 enhanced the glycine-induced cytoprotection. Finally, RNAi-mediated silencing of GlyRα1 abolished the glycine-induced changes in phosphorylation status of the above kinases in ATP-depleted cells. Taken together, our results suggest that the ERK1/2 and AKT signaling pathways are involved in the glycine–GlyR protection of MDCK cells against death induced by ATP depletion.

Abstract: Drosophila development proceeds through three larval stages, before it pupates to reach adulthood. During pupation, larval tissues are destructed by programmed cell death and replaced by adult structures. Programmed cell death is a tightly regulated process accomplished by the induction of three closely linked pro-apoptotic genes reaper, hid and grim, ultimately leading to the activation of caspases, DRONC and DRICE and results in cell death. Unlike other larval tissues, Malpighian tubules are unique in not undergoing characteristic ecdysone-induced apoptosis and are carried to the adults. In this paper we show that apoptotic proteins, HID, GRIM, DRONC and DRICE are expressed in the Malpighian tubules, however they are sequestered in the nucleus. Significantly DRONC and DRICE are not enzymatically processed to active forms in the Malpighian tubules, however, ectopic expression of pro-apoptotic proteins leads to malformed Malpighian tubules and lethality. We also show that the Drosophila inhibitor of apoptotic protein 1, DIAP1, is localized and processed differently in Malpighian tubules. These results provide first evidence in favor of differential activity of apoptotic proteins in Malpighian tubules.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to prospectively determine the etiology of anemia in a cohort of community-dwelling older outpatients with a comprehensive hematologic evaluation. Participants were men and women age 65 and older with anemia as defined by World Health Organization criteria recruited from outpatient hematology clinics at Stanford Hospital and Clinics (SHC) and Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System (VAPAHCS). Each participant underwent a history and physical examination, followed by a comprehensive hematologic evaluation, which in all participants included complete blood count, red cell indices, review of the blood smear, and assessment of vitamin B12, folate, iron status and renal function. Additional evaluation was obtained by clinical providers as per their discretion. 190 participants enrolled and completed the evaluation. Twelve percent of participants had iron deficiency anemia. Of those with iron deficiency in whom there was follow-up information, half normalized their hemoglobin in response to iron repletion, and half did not. Thirty-five percent of participants had unexplained anemia. Those with unexplained anemia had mildly increased inflammatory markers compared to non-anemic controls, and, at the lower hemoglobin ranges had relatively low erythropoietin levels. Sixteen percent of participants were categorized as being “suspicious for myelodysplastic syndrome.” Thus, even with comprehensive hematologic evaluation, unexplained anemia is common in older anemic outpatients. Iron deficiency anemia is also common and can be difficult to diagnose, and frequently the anemia is not fully corrected with iron repletion.

Abstract: This study evaluated the oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity markers in sickle cell anemia (SCA) patients with and without treatment with hydroxyurea. We assessed GSTT1, GSTM1 and GSTP1 polymorphisms in patients and a control group. The study groups were composed of 48 subjects without hemoglobinopathies and 28 SCA patients, 13 treated with HU [SCA (+HU)], and 15 SCA patients not treated with HU [SCA (−HU)]. We observed a significant difference for GSTP1 polymorphisms in SCA patients with the V/V genotype that showed higher glutathione (GSH) and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) (p=0.0445 and p=0.0360), respectively, compared with the I/I genotype. HU use was associated with a 35.2% decrease in the lipid peroxidation levels of the SCA (+HU) group (p<0.0001). Moreover, the SCA (+HU) group showed higher TEAC as compared to the control group (p=0.002). We did not find any significant difference in glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity between the groups (p=0.76), but the catalase (CAT) activity was about 17% and 30% decreased in the SCA (+HU) and SCA (−HU) groups, respectively (p<0.00001). Whereas the plasma GSH levels were ~2 times higher in the SCA patients than the control group (p=0.0005). HU use has contributed to higher CAT activity and TEAC, and lower lipid peroxidation in patients under treatment. These findings may explain the influence of HU in ameliorating oxidative stress on SCA subjects.

Abstract: Cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix is mediated by adhesion receptors, mainly integrins, which upon interaction with the extracellular matrix, bind to the actin cytoskeleton via their cytoplasmic domains. This association is mediated by a variety of scaffold and signaling proteins, which control the mechanical and signaling activities of the adhesion site. Upon transformation of fibroblasts with active forms of Src (e.g., v-Src), focal adhesions are disrupted, and transformed into dot-like contacts known as podosomes, and consisting of a central actin core surrounded by an adhesion ring. To clarify the mechanism underlying Src-dependent modulation of the adhesive phenotype, and its influence on podosome organization, we screened for the effect of siRNA-mediated knockdown of tyrosine kinases, MAP kinases and phosphatases on the reorganization of the adhesion-cytoskeleton complex, induced by a constitutively active Src mutant (SrcY527F). In this screen, we discovered several genes that are involved in Src-induced remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. We further showed that knockdown of Src in osteoclasts abolishes the formation of the podosome-based rings and impairs cell spreading, without inducing stress fiber development. Our work points to several genes that are involved in this process, and sheds new light on the molecular plasticity of integrin adhesions.

Abstract: Background
In Gaucher disease (GD), acid-β-glucosidase (GBA1) gene mutations result in defective glucocerebrosidase and variable combinations of hematological, visceral, and diverse bone disease. Osteopenia is highly prevalent, but its age of onset during the natural course of GD is not known. It is also unclear if the degree of improvement in osteopenia, secondary to imiglucerase enzyme therapy, differs by the age of the patient.
Objective
We hypothesized that osteopenia develops early in life, during the natural course of type 1 Gaucher disease (GD1), and that its response to treatment is maximal during this period.
Methods
We examined data from the International Collaborative Gaucher Group (ICGG) Gaucher Registry of patients treated with imiglucerase between the ages of 5 and 50years. Lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) (determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and expressed as Z-scores) at baseline and for up to 10years on imiglucerase were analyzed in children (ages≥5 to <12years), adolescents (≥12 to <20years), young adults (≥20 to <30years), and older adults (≥30 to <50years). BMD was correlated with other disease characteristics. Pre-treatment, descriptive statistics were applied to 5-year age categories. Non-linear mixed effects regression models were used to analyze DXA Z-scores over time after treatment with imiglucerase.

Pre-treatment, low BMD was prevalent in all age groups, most strikingly in adolescents. DXA Z-scores were at or below −1 in 44% of children (n=43), 76% of adolescents (n=41), 54% of young adults (n=56) and 52% of older adults (n=171). The most common GBA1 genotype was N370S heteroallelic. Baseline hematological and visceral manifestations in the 4 age groups were similar. In children with DXA Z-scores≤−1 at baseline, imiglucerase therapy for 6years resulted in improvement of mean DXA Z-scores from −1.38 (95% CI −1.73 to −1.03) to −0.73 (95% CI −1.25 to −0.21); in young adults DXA Z-scores improved from −1.95 (95% CI −2.26 to −1.64) to −0.67 (95% CI −1.09 to −0.26). BMD also improved in older adults, but the magnitude of the improvement was lower compared to younger patients.
Conclusions
Low bone density is common in GD1 with the highest prevalence rate in adolescence, a developmental period critical to attainment of peak bone mass. Imiglucerase results in amelioration of osteopenia in all age groups, with the greatest improvements in younger patients.

Abstract: Invasion across tissue boundaries by metastatic tumor cells depends on the proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix, initiated by the formation of invadopodia, actin-driven membrane protrusions with matrix-degradative activity. Yet, mechanisms underlying invadopodia formation remain largely unknown. In this report, we examined the role of the histone deacetylase HDAC6 in invadopodia formation and invasion by breast cancer cells. Using small interfering RNA silencing of protein expression in highly invasive MDA-MB-231 breast adenocarcinoma cells, we show that HDAC6 is required for two-dimensional matrix proteolysis. In addition, we demonstrate that HDAC6 acts as a tubulin and cortactin deacetylase. We also report that the inhibition of HDAC6 by siRNA or treatment with HDAC inhibitor TSA results in a decreased invasion capacity of a three-dimensional type I collagen matrix by MDA-MB-231 cells. These data identify HDAC6 as a critical component of the invasive apparatus of tumor cells, in both two- and three-dimensional matrices.

Abstract: We describe monozygotic twin sisters, born to consanguineous Moroccan parents, who are highly discordant for the manifestations of Gaucher disease. Both carry Gaucher genotype N188S/N188S. One has severe visceral involvement, epilepsy, and a cerebellar syndrome. Her twin does not manifest any symptoms or signs of Gaucher disease but suffers from type 1 diabetes mellitus. The concurrence of a mild Gaucher mutation with a severe phenotype, as well as the occurrence of highly discordant phenotypes in a pair of monozygotic twins, is discussed.

Abstract: Casein micelles and fat globules are essential components of milk and are both secreted at the apical side of mammary epithelial cells during lactation. Milk fat globules are excreted by budding, being enwrapped by the apical plasma membrane, while caseins contained in transport vesicles are released by exocytosis. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms governing casein exocytosis are, to date, not fully deciphered. SNARE proteins are known to take part in cellular membrane trafficking and in exocytosis events in many cell types and we therefore attempted to identify those relevant to casein secretion. With this aim, we performed a detailed analysis of their expression by RT-PCR in both whole mouse mammary gland and in purified mammary acini at various physiological stages, as well as in the HC11 cell line. The expression of some regulatory proteins involved in SNARE complex formation such as Munc-13, Munc-18 and complexins was also explored. The amount of certain SNAREs appeared to be regulated depending on the physiological stage of the mammary gland. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that SNAP-23 interacted with syntaxin-6, -7 and -12, as well as with VAMP-3, -4 and -8 in mammary epithelial cells during lactation. Finally, the subcellular localisation of candidate SNAREs in these cells was determined both by indirect immunofluorescence and immunogold labelling. The present work provides important new data concerning SNARE proteins in mammary epithelial cells and points to SNAP-23 as a potential central player for the coupling of casein and milk fat globule secretion during lactation.

Abstract: Patients with Gaucher disease suffering from the consequences of femoral head osteonecrosis deserve a treatment modality that will eliminate pain, preserve ambulation and hopefully will endure long enough to allow satisfactory daily life. Total hip arthroplasty fulfills these 3 objectives. The rate of complications during anesthesia and during surgical procedure is comparable to otherwise healthy population if the Gaucher patients are carefully evaluated pre-surgery and prepared by a medical team familiar with all aspects of the disease. With prompt preparation, meticulous procedure, and careful post-operative care, patients with Gaucher disease may benefit from long-lasting hip prostheses. It is to be hoped that newer types of implants would allow longer revision-free periods even in this young patient population who have developed avascular necrosis, and a greater hope for patients with Gaucher disease would be that early administration of bone-specific therapies may prevent osteonecrosis.

Abstract: Introduction
Therapeutic goals have been described to monitor achievement, maintenance and continuity of therapeutic response in patients with type 1 Gaucher disease receiving enzyme replacement therapy.
Aim
To benchmark the impact of velaglucerase alfa treatment against therapeutic goals for 5 key clinical parameters of type 1 Gaucher disease (anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and skeletal pathology).
Methods
In an open-label Phase I/II study, twelve adults with symptomatic type 1 Gaucher disease and intact spleens received velaglucerase alfa for 9months (60U/kg infusion every other week [EOW]). Eleven patients completed the study and 10 enrolled in a long-term extension. After 1year, patients who achieved ≥2 hematological or organ goals began step-wise dose reduction from 60 to 45 then 30U/kg EOW. Data for anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and skeletal pathology at baseline and 4years are available for 8 patients (3 male, 5 female). The proportion of patients at goal for anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly at baseline was compared with the proportion achieving each goal at 4years. The proportion achieving the skeletal pathology goal was determined on the basis of Z-score improvement from baseline to 4years. The proportion of patients who achieved all 5 goals at 4years was compared with the proportion at goal for all 5 parameters at baseline.
Results
At baseline, no patient was at goal for all clinical parameters. After 1year of treatment, all patients maintained goals present at baseline, and all achieved ≥2 goals. All 8 patients began step-wise dose reduction from 60 to 30U/kg EOW between 15 and 18months. By year 4 of treatment, all patients met goals for all 5 clinical parameters; therefore 100% achievement was seen for each of the 5 long-term, therapeutic goals.
Discussion
In this velaglucerase alfa Phase I/II and extension study, clinically meaningful achievement of each long-term, therapeutic goal was observed for each patient, despite dose reduction after 1year. This is the first report of a cohort where all patients receiving ERT for type 1 Gaucher disease achieved all 5 of these long-term, therapeutic goals within 4years of starting treatment and after ≥2years dose reduction.

Abstract: Because of an unpredicted and unavoidable shortage in global supplies of imiglucerase for Gaucher disease, we collected clinical and laboratory data from patients who were evaluated ≤6months before drug withdrawal and then retested before/during reinstatement of therapy. Hemoglobin, platelet counts, and liver and spleen index volumes by ultrasound as well as chitotriosidase were evaluated as percent change over time and relative to dose-years of exposure to enzyme therapy. Deterioration was seen in all four clinical parameters and in chitotriosidase activity in most patients and even among patients who stopped for only 3months. No patient consistently showed nondeterioration in all five parameters. Platelet counts were most sensitive to therapy withdrawal. There was no overt correlation between percent change in these parameters and dose-years of therapy. Although we no longer think that drug vacations should be considered as a form of maintenance for patients requiring enzyme therapy for Gaucher disease, but if necessary—for compelling personal reasons—one may be reassured that a short-term drug interruption is not likely to lead to irreversible complications or return to baseline values of critical clinical parameters.

Abstract: Objective
Unlike beta thalassemia major (β-TM) in which cardiac siderosis represents the leading cause of mortality and morbidity, in beta thalassemia intermedia (β-TI), pulmonary hypertension (PHT) and thrombosis seems to be the major cardiovascular complications. However, the mechanism underlying these complications in β-TI is still unclear. Endothelial dysfunction, the key early event in atherogenesis, is now emerging as an important cardiovascular risk determiner in β-TI patients. Among the factors known to affect endothelial function, iron and cholesterol merit particular consideration in β-TI patients. Therefore, with the aim to extend our knowledge on the mechanisms connecting atherosclerosis to β-TI, in this study, we compared lipid and iron metabolism in serum and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from β-TI and β-TM patients and controls.
Methods and results
In this study the iron status and the lipid profile in serum and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 22 adult β-TI patients were examined, and compared with 70 adult β-TM, and 50 age-matched controls. Despite the great variability, levels of serum iron and transferrin saturation were significantly higher in β-TI compared to both controls and β-TM. By contrast, transferrin and hepcidin levels were lower in β-TI patients. Changes in serum indicators in β-TI patients were associated with altered expressions in PBMCs of hepcidin and IL-1α, involved in some way in the regulation of iron homeostasis. In addition β-TI exhibited a reduction of total and high density lipoprotein cholesterol in serum and of neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase in PBMCs, and an increase of cytoplasmic neutral lipids and mRNA levels of acetyl-coenzymeA:cholesterol acyltransferase.
Conclusions
Taken together, these findings provide experimental support for the idea that β-TI patients exhibit a proatherogenic biochemical phenotype which may contribute to enhance cardiovascular risk in these subjects.

Abstract: The factor VIII intron 22 inversion is the most common cause of hemophilia A, accounting for approximately 40% of all severe cases of the disease. Southern hybridization and multiplex long distance PCR are the most commonly used techniques to detect the inversion in a diagnostic setting, although both have significant limitations. Here we describe our experience establishing a multicolor fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) based assay as an alternative to existing methods for genetic diagnosis of the inversion. Our assay was designed to apply three differentially labelled BAC DNA probes that when hybridized to interphase nuclei would exhibit signal patterns that are consistent with the normal or the inversion locus. When the FISH assay was applied to five normal and five inversion male samples, the correct genotype was assignable with p<0.001 for all samples. When applied to carrier female samples the assay could not assign a genotype to all female samples, probably due to a lower proportion of informative nuclei in female samples caused by the added complexity of a second X chromosome. Despite this complication, these pilot findings show that the assay performs favourably compared to the commonly used methods.

Abstract: Hemidesmosomes (HDs) are essential anchorage junctions which mediate the firm attachment of epithelia to the underlying basement membranes, of which one main component is the integrin α6β4. These specific junctions are also able to trigger signalling pathways, via the recruitment and interactions of signalling molecules with HD components such as the cytoplasmic tail of the β4 integrin or the plakin plectin. HDs must also assemble and disassemble depending on the tissue context for example during tissue remodelling. Alterations of HD components or their loss result in skin blistering disorders known as epidermolysis bullosa. Since mice lacking integrin α6 die at birth with severe skin blistering, we have produced a mouse line in which epidermal deletion of integrin α6 can be controlled by tamoxifen injection. We observed that the deletion was mosaic, but that hairless skin such as ears, tails and paws were affected and showed chronic inflammation associated with hyperproliferation, and expression of laminin-111. Interestingly, two cytokines, amphiregulin and epiregulin, previously found increased in integrin α6 deficient cultured keratinocytes, were also increased here in the affected skin. In detached areas, we validate clearly that the absence of integrin α6 leads to a delocalisation of plectin, and the complete disappearance of HD structures.

Abstract: The effectiveness of deferoxamine (DFO), deferiprone (DFP), or deferasirox (DFX) in thalassemia major was assessed. Outcomes were reported as means±SD, mean differences with 95% CI, or standardized mean differences. Statistical heterogeneity was tested using χ2 (Q) and I2. Sources of bias and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system (GRADE) were considered. Overall, 1520 patients were included. Only 7.4% of trials were free of bias. Overall measurements suggest low trial quality (GRADE). The meta-analysis suggests lower final liver iron concentrations during associated versus monotherapy treatment (p<0.0001), increases in serum ferritin levels during DFX 5, 10, and 20mg/kg versus DFO-treated groups (p<0.00001, p<0.00001, and p=0.002, respectively), but no statistically significant difference during DFX 30mg/kg versus DFO (p=0.70), no statistically significant variations in heart T2* signal during associated or sequential versus mono-therapy treatment (p=0.46 and p=0.14, respectively), increases in urinary iron excretion during associated or sequential versus monotherapy treatment (p=0.008 and p=0.02, respectively), and improved ejection fraction during associated or sequential versus monotherapy treatment (p=0.01 and p<0.00001, respectively). These findings do not support any specific chelation treatment. The literature shows risks of bias, and additional larger and longer trials are needed.

Abstract: Agonist-evoked Ca2+ entry has been reported to be enhanced in platelets from type 2 diabetic patients, which results in altered platelet responsiveness and cardiovascular complications. The present study is aimed to investigate whether store-operated divalent cation entry, a major Ca2+ entry pathway, is altered in platelets from diabetic patients. Store-operated divalent cation entry was estimated by determination of Mn2+ entry. Association between STIM1, Orai1, hTRPC1 and hTRPC6 was detected by co-immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. In the presence of specific purinergic and serotoninergic receptor antagonists Mn2+ entry, induced by thapsigargin (TG), was reduced in platelets from diabetic donors as compared to healthy controls. Treatment with TG or the agonist thrombin enhanced co-immunoprecipitation of STIM1 with Orai1, hTRPC1 and hTRPC6 in platelets from healthy donors, a response that was significantly reduced in platelets from diabetic patients. Our results indicate that store-operated divalent cation entry is reduced in platelets from type 2 diabetic subjects, which is likely mediated by impairment of the association of STIM1 with the channel subunits Orai1, hTRPC1 and hTRPC6 and might be involved in the pathogenesis of the altered platelet responsiveness observed in diabetic patients.

Abstract: The painful crisis accounts for the majority of sickle cell disease (SCD) related hospital admissions. The prototypic long pentraxin 3 (PTX3), an acute phase protein, is elevated in patients with inflammatory and ischemic states. As the sickle cell painful crisis is associated with both inflammation and tissue ischemia, we questioned whether plasma PTX3 levels are increased during and associated with painful crisis severity. Furthermore, since PTX3 up-regulates endothelial expression of tissue factor we studied PTX levels in relation to markers of endothelial and coagulation activation. Plasma levels of PTX3, ultra-sensitive C-reactive protein (US-CRP), prothrombin fragment 1+2, thrombin–antithrombin (TAT) complexes, von Willebrand Factor antigen and soluble vascular adhesion molecule-1 were determined in 105 asymptomatic sickle cell patients, 33 patients during painful crisis and 30 race matched healthy controls. Plasma PTX3 levels were comparable between patients in asymptomatic state and healthy controls, but significantly higher during painful crisis (P<0.01). US-CRP levels were higher in asymptomatic patients compared to controls (P<0.0001) and increased further during painful crisis (P<0.0001). PTX3 levels at presentation with painful crisis correlated significantly with the duration of subsequent hospital admission (rs=0.43; P=0.013), whereas US-CRP levels did not. PTX3 levels did not correlate with markers of hypercoagulability. The increase of PTX3 levels during painful crisis and their relation to the duration of subsequent hospital stay suggest that PTX3 might serve both as a diagnostic and severity marker of the painful sickle cell crisis.

Abstract: Regulation of the actin cytoskeleton is critical for neurite formation. Tropomodulins (Tmods) regulate polymerization at actin filament pointed ends. Previous experiments using a mouse model deficient for the neuron specific isoform Tmod2 suggested a role for Tmods in neuronal function by impacting processes underlying learning and memory. However, the role of Tmods in neuronal function on the cellular level remains unknown. Immunofluorescence localization of the neuronal isoforms Tmod1 and Tmod2 in cultured rat primary hippocampal neurons revealed that Tmod1 is enriched along the proximal part of F-actin bundles in lamellipodia of spreading cells and in growth cones of extending neurites, while Tmod2 appears largely cytoplasmic. Functional analysis of these Tmod isoforms in a mouse neuroblastoma N2a cell line showed that knockdown of Tmod2 resulted in a significant increase in the number of neurite-forming cells and in neurite length. While N2a cells compensated for Tmod2 knockdown by increasing Tmod1 levels, over-expression of exogenous Tmod1 had no effect on neurite outgrowth. Moreover, knockdown of Tmod1 increased the number of neurites formed per cell, without effect on the number of neurite-forming cells or neurite length. Taken together, these results indicate that Tmod1 and Tmod2 have mechanistically distinct inhibitory roles in neurite formation, likely mediated via different effects on F-actin dynamics and via differential localizations during early neuritogenesis.

Abstract: Gaucher type 1 disease has a wide spectrum of phenotypes ranging from asymptomatic individuals to patients with massive hepatosplenomegaly and bone involvement. In most, anemia, thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly are the primary manifestations at diagnosis, findings shared by the hemoglobinopathies. Here we report the co-inheritance of α-thalassemia and Gaucher disease in a consanguineous family followed in Iran, which resulted in confusion regarding the diagnosis. This report emphasizes the need to independently establish the diagnosis of every affected member of a family to ensure appropriate management and therapeutic decisions.

Abstract: Essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera are myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) with an elevated thrombotic risk. Leukocytosis has recently emerged as a new risk factor and there is increasing evidence that polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) are involved. Procoagulant activity (PCA) of PMN in MPD has not yet been investigated. PCA of PMN from 22 patients with JAK2V617F positive MPD and 26 healthy subjects was studied using calibrated automated thrombography: in vitro thrombin generation induced with 1 pM tissue factor in the presence of added procoagulant phospholipids. There were no differences between patients and controls regarding the ability of PMN to increase thrombin generation. More surprisingly, basal thrombin generation in acellular MPD-plasma was found decreased for as yet unknown reasons. The presence of an active protein C pathway or platelets might provide a better insight into the coagulation phenotype in MPD.

Abstract: The migration and proliferation of endothelial cells affect the process of angiogenesis or the formation of blood vessels. Endothelial cells interact with each other to form ring-like structures in monolayers and tubular structures in matrigels. However, the transit phase between the individual endothelial cells and fully formed tubular structures is yet to be established. Guided by imaging, Western blot analysis, drug perturbation studies and siRNA studies we validate that endothelial ring structures are the fundamental and monomeric units of capillary tubes and nitric oxide is implicated in their fabrication. Giving input from experimental data, we used bagging classifier and information-gain to determine some of the physical and chemical parameters that define these biological structures. Further, we elucidated the implications of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and the NO/sGC/cGMP pathway in the formation of endothelial rings. We conclude that, formation of endothelial ring structure is important for angiogenesis and is mediated by the NO/sGC/cGMP pathway; and further endothelial rings can be used as in vitro models to study angiogenesis.

Abstract: NADPH oxidase (Nox) family enzymes are one of the main sources of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), which have been implicated in several physiological and pathophysiological processes. To date seven members of this family have been reported, including Nox1-5 and Duox1 and 2. With the exception of Nox2, the regulation of the Nox enzymes is still poorly understood. Nox1 is highly expressed in the colon, and requires two cytosolic regulators, the organizer subunit NoxO1 and the activator subunit NoxA1, as well as the binding of Rac1 GTPase, for its activity. Recently, we identified the c-Src substrate proteins Tks4 and Tks5 as functional members of a p47phox-related organizer superfamily. As a functional consequence of this interaction, Nox1 localizes to invadopodia, actin-rich membrane protrusions of cancer cells which facilitate pericellular proteolysis and invasive behavior. Here, we report that Tks4 and Tks5 directly bind to NoxA1. Moreover, the integrity of the N-terminal PRR of NoxA1 is essential for this direct interaction with the Tks proteins. When the PRR in NoxA1 is disrupted, Tks proteins cannot bind NoxA1 and lose their ability to support Nox1-dependent ROS generation. Consistent with this, Tks4 and Tks5 are unable to act as organizers for Nox2 because of their inability to interact with p67phox, which lacks the N-terminal PRR, thus conferring a unique specificity to Tks4 and 5. Taken together, these results clarify the molecular basis for the interaction between NoxA1 and the Tks proteins and may provide new insights into the pharmacological design of a more effective anti-metastatic strategy.

Abstract: In eukaryotic cells, proteins destined for secretion are translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and packaged into so-called COPII-coated vesicles. In the ER exit sites (ERES), COPII has the capacity of deforming the lipid bilayer, where it modulates the selective sorting and concentration of cargo proteins. In this study, we analyze the involvement of Rab1b in COPII dynamics and function by expressing either the Rab1b negative-mutant (Rab1N121I) or the Rab1b GTP restricted mutant (Rab1Q67L), or performing short interference RNA-based knockdown. We show that Rab1b interacts with the COPII components Sec23, Sec24 and Sec31 and that Rab1b inhibition changes the COPII phenotype. FRAP assays reveal that Rab1b modulates COPII association/dissociation kinetics at the ERES interface. Furthermore, Rab1b inhibition delays cargo sorting at the ER exit sites. We postulate that Rab1b is a key regulatory component of COPII dynamics and function.

Abstract: We herein describe our investigation of in-plane anisotropic polymer photovoltaic effects in aligned bulk-heterojunction layers that consisted of an oriented composite of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) and methanofullerene (P3HT:PCBM). By means of simple rubbing, a fairly uniform in-plane alignment of the P3HT:PCBM layer was achieved. The macroscopic orientation of the main chain of the P3HT polymer in the aligned layer was observed to be significantly greater in the direction of rubbing, while the nanoscopic crystalline packing along the side chains of the P3HT decreased significantly. The polymer solar cells that contained aligned P3HT:PCBM photoactive films exhibited a greater degree of anisotropy of the photovoltaic effects under polarized illumination along the two principal axes. These findings form a promising foundation for new types of polarization-dependent opto-electrical applications.

Abstract: The development of recombinantly manufactured enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has revolutionised the management of some inherited disorders of metabolism. Gaucher disease was the first lysosomal storage disorder for which ERT became commercially available and ERT remains first-line treatment for affected individuals. In Australia, 70 patients with Gaucher disease are treated through a centrally administered Australian Government national program known as the Life Savings Drug Program (LSDP). Imiglucerase (Cerezyme®), manufactured by Genzyme Corporation, is the only ERT currently registered in Australia for the treatment of Gaucher disease. In June 2009, Genzyme Corporation announced the detection of a virus in its Allston Landing manufacturing facility which resulted in inventories of imiglucerase being insufficient to meet projected global demand. The Australian Government sought advice from its Gaucher Disease Advisory Committee (GDAC) on recalculating patient doses in order to ration available imiglucerase to those most in need on a clinical severity basis. Management of this rationing process was urgent and required extensive investigation to develop a clinical severity hierarchy, to review available imiglucerase stock spread across multiple pharmacies, to implement a strategy for redistributing available imiglucerase according to specific patients' recalculated doses, to advise treating doctors and patients concerning these changed circumstances and to consider new monitoring schedules during the drug shortage phase. A cohort of 24 patients was withdrawn from therapy, 22 of whom had no discernable clinical adverse effect. This experience suggests that short-term studies of maintenance therapy without a no-treatment arm may lead to erroneous conclusions and that some patients may have treatment holidays or delayed infusions without short-term adverse outcomes.

Abstract: Continuous reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) may alter their overall redox status and cause tissue damage. The aim of this study was to evaluate oxidative stress in patients with SCD using two new assays, FORT (free oxygen radical test) and FORD (free oxygen radical defense) along with assessment of glutathione system including superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities, vitamins A, C and E, malondialdehyde (MDA), non-transferrin bound iron (NTBI) and nitric oxide (NO) concentrations. A total of 40 patients with SCD and 25 apparently healthy volunteers (control group) were enrolled in the study. Components of glutathione system, vitamins A, C, and E, and malondialdehyde were determined with reverse-phase HPLC, non-transferrin bound iron (NTBI) was assessed with atomic absorption spectroscopy using graphite furnace, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities were determined spectrophotometrically in red cell lysates, nitric oxide (NO) was detected colorimetrically, while FORT and FORD using colorimetric assays, as two point-of-care tests. The findings revealed significant impairment of the glutathione system indicated by reduced GSHtotal (p<0.00001), GSHreduced (p<0.00001) and GSSG (p>0.056) values of SCD patients compared to the control group. ROS expressed as FORT were significantly increased (p<0.00001), while antioxidant defense expressed as FORD was significantly reduced (p<0.02) in SCD group compared to the control group. Age and genotype of the patients as well as therapy of their disease appeared to play no role in their oxidative status.

Abstract: Although fibroblasts play an essential part during the wound healing response, the mechanisms by which they mediate tissue remodelling and contraction are still unclear. Using live cell and matrix imaging within 3D free-floating fibroblast-populated collagen lattices as a model for tissue contraction, we compared the behaviour of a range of fibroblasts with low and high contraction abilities and analysed the effect of the broad spectrum MMP-inhibitor GM6001 on cell behaviour and matrix contraction. We identified two mechanisms underlying matrix contraction, one via direct cell-mediated contractile activity, the second through matrix degradation. These appear to be linked to cell morphology and regulated by the collagen concentration within the matrix. Cells with a rounded morphology proliferated in the matrix but did not remodel it efficiently, resulting in a poor ability to contract matrices. Cells with an elongated morphology showed higher levels of protrusive activity, leading to efficient matrix remodelling and contraction. GM6001 inhibited week-long matrix contraction to various extents with the different cell lines. However, quantitative analysis of the cell protrusive activity showed that GM6001 consistently decreased cell dynamics in 3D by about 20%, and this was correlated with a significant reduction in early matrix contraction. Overall our results suggest that although fibroblast-mediated matrix contraction depends on both cell dynamics and MMP-mediated matrix degradation, the efficiency of GM6001 treatment in preventing contraction might be linked to a direct effect on cell dynamics.

Abstract: Purpose
To achieve minimal inter-observer variability in assessment of spleen and liver volume changes using a novel MRI reading method in the context of a phase III clinical trial of a new therapy for Gaucher disease.
Materials and methods
Abdominal MRI examinations at screening and after 6 and 9months' exposure to a novel plant-cell-derived recombinant enzyme, taliglucerase alfa, were taken in 31 patients with Gaucher disease and at least 8-fold greater than expected splenomegaly. Transverse T2, T1, and in/out-of-phase, and coronal T1 sequences were performed using standardized settings across 11 sites globally. Spleen and liver volumes were semi-automatically delineated using an automatic segmentation algorithm followed by manual correction by experienced technologists using advanced editing tools. Data of all randomized patients were then submitted for efficacy evaluation to two independent experts blinded to time-point and treatment.
Results
Mean (±SD) percent variability over all time-points was 0.30%±0.46% for spleen and 0.53%±0.69% for liver using 178 spleen and liver volumes measured twice. Adjudication due to ≥5% variability between observers was not required.
Conclusion
The measurement method was found to be precise in monitoring spleen and liver volume changes over time, with a much lower variability than traditional manual methods, supporting the accuracy of the results. Given the observed minimal variability rates among multiple readers, a single read of each volume would be sufficient.

Abstract: ErbB2 over-expression is detected in approximately 25% of invasive breast cancers and is strongly associated with poor patient survival. We have previously demonstrated that p130Cas adaptor is a crucial mediator of ErbB2 transformation. Here, we analysed the molecular mechanisms through which p130Cas controls ErbB2-dependent invasion in three-dimensional cultures of mammary epithelial cells. Concomitant p130Cas over-expression and ErbB2 activation enhance PI3K/Akt and Erk1/2 MAPK signalling pathways and promote invasion of mammary acini. By using pharmacological inhibitors, we demonstrate that both signalling cascades are required for the invasive behaviour of p130Cas over-expressing and ErbB2 activated acini. Erk1/2 MAPK and PI3K/Akt signalling triggers invasion through distinct downstream effectors involving mTOR/p70S6K and Rac1 activation, respectively. Moreover, in silico analyses indicate that p130Cas expression in ErbB2 positive human breast cancers significantly correlates with higher risk to develop distant metastasis, thus underlying the value of the p130Cas/ErbB2 synergism in regulating breast cancer invasion. In conclusion, high levels of p130Cas favour progression of ErbB2-transformed cells towards an invasive phenotype.

Abstract: Background
Bone disease is a serious complication of type 1 Gaucher disease, which if untreated can result in pain, disability and reduced quality of life. MRI is the method of choice for assessing and monitoring bone involvement in Gaucher patients. MRI bone evaluation has been predominantly carried out on the lumbar spine and/or lower extremities using quantitative or semi-quantitative methods. We describe evaluation of skeletal involvement in Gaucher patients using whole body MRI scanning.
Methods
Whole body MRI was performed in 39 adult type I Gaucher patients using a 1.5T superconducting magnet with total imaging matrix technology. A standard MRI protocol was performed in all patients using coronal T1-, T2-weighted (thighs) and STIR-sequences of the whole body, sagittal T1-, T2- (lumbar spine) and STIR-sequences of the entire axial skeleton. Bone marrow involvement was analysed using the Düsseldorf Gaucher score (DGS), bone marrow burden score (BMB), and vertebra-disc-ratio (VDR). Pelvis, humerus, legs and spine were also analysed using the pattern of marrow involvement described by homogeneous type A or non-homogeneous type B morphology. Avascular necrosis (AVN) of the humeral head was determined.
Results
Whole body MRI was well tolerated and of diagnostic value in all patients. Thirty one out of 39 patients (79%) showed bone involvement. In fifteen of these 31 patients (48%) humeral bone involvement was observed. The morphological appearance of bone involvement (type A or B) was consistent across the humerus, legs and pelvis. The infiltration pattern was also similar across cervical, thoracic and lumbar vertebral bodies. Humeral bone involvement was present in 89% of patients with type B morphology compared with 32% of patients with type A morphology (p<0.005). Humeral involvement was detected more frequently in patients with severe bone involvement as determined by higher DGS and BMB scores, than in patients with lower DGS and BMB scores (p<0.0001 and p=0.0016). AVN of the humeral head was detected in 6 patients (19%).
Conclusions
In this group of patients, severe bone involvement in the lumbar spine and lower extremities and type B morphology was also associated with humeral involvement. The morphological infiltration pattern was consistent in the entire skeleton indicating the systemic character of bone disease. Whole body MRI presents a feasible means of assessing the entire skeletal system and could be a valuable diagnostic and monitoring tool in the management of patients with type 1 Gaucher disease.

Abstract: In this study we investigated the etiology and pathogenesis of nephrotic syndrome (NS) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in 257 patients with hematopoietic malignancies who survived more than 2months post allo-HSCT. Associations of NS with the conditioning regimen, graft versus host disease (GVHD), and other variables were analyzed. Pathologic features of the kidney, regulatory T cells (Tregs), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were studied. NS was identified in 9 patients. The number of Tregs at day+30, 60, 90, and 180 was lower in NS patients than non-NS patients (P=0.001, 0.001, 0.007, 0.003). Serum levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α were higher in NS patients (P=0.032, 0.001, respectively). NS post allo-HSCT was associated with the occurrence of chronic GVHD (P=0.02). NS post-HSCT is an immune disorder that may involve immune complex deposition, Th1 cytokines, and Tregs.

Abstract: Alternative pre-mRNA splicing is regarded as a pivotal mechanism for generating proteome diversity and complexity from a limited inventory of mammalian genes. Aberrant splicing has been described as a predisposing factor for a number of diseases, but very little is known about its role in chronic inflammation. In this study, we systematically screened 149 splicing factors and 145 potential intron retention events for occurrence and differential expression in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). As a result, we identified 47 splicing factors and 33 intron retention events that were differentially regulated in mucosal tissue of IBD patients at transcript level. Despite the fact that Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, two subtypes of IBD, share the expression patterns of splicing factors and intron retention events in the majority of cases, we observed significant differences. To investigate these subtype-specific changes in detail we determined the expression levels of seven splicing factors (DUSP11, HNRPAB, HNRPH3, SLU7, SFR2IP, SFPQ, SF3B14) and three intron retention events (PARC, IER3, FGD2) in a cohort of 165 patients with inflammatory diseases of the colon (120 with IBD) and 30 healthy controls by real time PCR (TaqMan). This study demonstrates the potential impact of regulated splicing factors on subsequent regulated intron retention in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammation, exemplified by IBD.

Abstract: The −158 (C→T) nucleotide change, known as Xmn I polymorphism, occurs in Gγ-globin gene promoter, and results in elevated fetal hemoglobin (HbF). We found this mutation in cis of a β0-thalassemia splicing mutation. Despite the complete absence of adult HbA, the phenotype was only moderately severe with no detectable alteration of α-globin gene expression. Interestingly, the β-globin locus haplotype has not been described to bear the Gγ promoter mutation. Using a gene-specific real-time RT-PCR approach, we found a dramatic increase of both Gγ and Aγ mRNA accumulated in the reticulocytes, suggesting that the Gγ-promoter mutation, alone or in association with another genetic modification, alters in concert the transcription of both Gγ and Aγ. This observation is discussed in light of recent regulatory model for β-globin locus.

Abstract: Complete loss of protein 4.1R in red blood cell membrane is a very rare condition in humans. We here explore the third case. The morphological and biochemical observations suggested that the proband suffers from homozygous hereditary elliptocytosis. Both parents, who are consanguineous, have an elliptocytosis with no cell fragmentation, typical of a heterozygous 4.1R deficiency with a silent allele. A genomic deletion was found; it encompasses about 50kb of genomic DNA, and suppresses the two key exons 2 and 4, which contain the two functional AUG translation initiation sites in erythroid and nonerythroid cells. The alternative first exons are intact, hence preserving the transcription potential of the altered gene. Extensive analysis of 4.1R transcripts revealed multiple splicing defects upstream of the deleted sequences. Importantly, we found that most of the transcripts generated from the altered gene are intercepted by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay mechanism, suggesting that the massive degradation of the mRNA species jeopardizes the production of shortened but functional protein 4.1R from an alternative translation initiation site downstream of the deletion.

Abstract: Breakdown of the inner blood–retinal barrier and the blood–brain barrier is associated with changes in tight and adherens junction-associated proteins that link vascular endothelial cells. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 increases the paracellular permeability of vascular endothelial monolayers through tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin and claudin-5. Bovine retinal and human brain capillary endothelial cells were grown as monolayers on coated polycarbonate membranes. Paracellular permeability was studied by measuring the equilibration of 14C-inulin or fluorescence-labelled dextran. Changes in VE-cadherin and claudin-5 expression were studied by immunocytochemistry (ICC) and quantified by cell-based enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin and claudin-5 was studied by ICC, immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. We found that exposure of endothelial cells to TGF-β1 caused a dose-dependent increase in paracellular permeability as reflected by increases in the equilibration of 14C-inulin. This effect was enhanced by the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate and attenuated by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor lavendustin A. ICC and cell-based ELISA revealed that TGF-β1 induced both dose- and time-dependent decreases in VE-cadherin and claudin-5 expression. Assessment of cell viability indicated that changes in these junction-associated proteins were not due to endothelial death or injury. ICC revealed that tyrosine phosphorylation of endothelial monolayers was greatly enhanced by TGF-β1 treatment, and immunoprecipitation of cell lysates showed increased tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin and claudin-5. Our results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin and claudin-5 is involved in the increased paracellular permeability of central nervous system-derived vascular endothelium induced by TGF-β1.

Abstract: Macrophage tissue infiltration is a critical step in the immune response against microorganisms and is also associated with disease progression in chronic inflammation and cancer. Macrophages are constitutively equipped with specialized structures called podosomes dedicated to extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. We recently reported that these structures play a critical role in trans-matrix mesenchymal migration mode, a protease-dependent mechanism. Podosome molecular components and their ECM-degrading activity have been extensively studied in two dimensions (2D), but yet very little is known about their fate in three-dimensional (3D) environments. Therefore, localization of podosome markers and proteolytic activity were carefully examined in human macrophages performing mesenchymal migration. Using our gelled collagen I 3D matrix model to obligate human macrophages to perform mesenchymal migration, classical podosome markers including talin, paxillin, vinculin, gelsolin, cortactin were found to accumulate at the tip of F-actin-rich cell protrusions together with β1 integrin and CD44 but not β2 integrin. Macrophage proteolytic activity was observed at podosome-like protrusion sites using confocal fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy. The formation of migration tunnels by macrophages inside the matrix was accomplished by degradation, engulfment and mechanic compaction of the matrix. In addition, videomicroscopy revealed that 3D F-actin-rich protrusions of migrating macrophages were as dynamic as their 2D counterparts. Overall, the specifications of 3D podosomes resembled those of 2D podosome rosettes rather than those of individual podosomes. This observation was further supported by the aspect of 3D podosomes in fibroblasts expressing Hck, a master regulator of podosome rosettes in macrophages. In conclusion, human macrophage podosomes go 3D and take the shape of spherical podosome rosettes when the cells perform mesenchymal migration. This work sets the scene for future studies of molecular and cellular processes regulating macrophage trans-migration.

Abstract: Recently, we reported a new mutation of phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), called PGK-Barcelona, which causes chronic hemolytic anemia associated with progressive neurological impairment. We found a 140T→A substitution that produces an Ile46Asn change located at the N-domain of the enzyme and we suggested that the decrease of the PGK activity is probably related to a loss of enzyme stability. In this paper, by analyzing whole hemolysates and cloned enzymes, we show that both enzymes possess similar kinetic properties (although some differences are observed in the Km values) and the same electrophoretic mobility. However, PGK-Barcelona has higher thermal instability. Therefore, we confirm that the decrease of the red blood cell (RBC) PGK activity caused by the PGK-Barcelona mutation is more closely related to a loss of enzyme stability than to a decrease of enzyme catalytic function. Furthermore, we have measured the levels of glycolytic metabolites and adenine nucleotides in the RBC from controls and from the patient. The increase of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate and the decrease of ATP RBC levels are the only detected metabolic changes that could cause hemolytic anemia.

Abstract: Fenofibrate, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α agonist, is a hypolipidemic drug. Although several studies have explored the fenofibrate-induced antiproliferative effect in cultured human cells, it is not clear which role PPARα plays in this antiproliferative effect. Therefore, we investigated the antiproliferative mechanism of fenofibrate in Huh7 (human hepatoma cell line). Cell viability was measured by the WST-8 assay and cell proliferation was assessed using the BrdU incorporation assay. The cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry. The cyclins, tumor suppressor proteins and regulators of the AKT signaling pathway were analyzed by immunoblotting. Using flow cytometry, we showed that fenofibrate blocks entry into the S phase of the cell cycle. We certified that this G1 arrest is caused by the reduction of cyclin A and E2F1 and the accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27. Interestingly, the antiproliferative effect of fenofibrate was not affected by the PPARα antagonist (GW6471) or by PPARα-specific siRNA. These results suggest that fenofibrate suppresses Huh7 cell growth through a PPARα independent mechanism. Furthermore, we showed that treatment of Huh7 cells with fenofibrate leads to suppression of AKT phosphorylation. We also found for the first time that fenofibrate increased the C-terminal modulator protein (CTMP), which inhibits AKT phosphorylation. Our data suggest that fenofibrate inhibits the proliferation of Huh7 cells by blocking Akt activation, and that CTMP is one of the key players for this antiproliferative property of fenofibrate in Huh7 cells.

Abstract: Cell spreading is a critical component of numerous physiological phenomena including cancer metastasis, embryonic development, and mitosis. We have previously illustrated that cellular blebs appear after abrupt cell–substrate detachment and play a critical role in regulating membrane tension; however, the dynamics of bleb–substrate interactions during spreading remains unclear. Here we explore the role of blebs during endothelial cell spreading using chemical and osmotic modifications to either induce or inhibit bleb formation. We track cell–substrate dynamics as well as individual blebs using surface sensitive microscopic techniques. Blebbing cells (both control and chemically induced) exhibit increased lag times prior to fast growth. Interestingly, lamellae appear later for blebbing compared to non-blebbing cells, and in all cases, lamellae signal the start of fast spreading. Our results indicate that cellular blebs play a key role in the early stage of cell spreading, first by controling the initial cell adhesion and then by presenting a dynamic inhibition of cell spreading until a lamella appears and fast spreading ensues.

Abstract: Directed sibling cord blood banking is indicated in women delivering healthy babies who already have a sibling with a disease that is potentially treatable with an allogeneic cord blood transplant. We evaluated the effectiveness of a national directed cord blood banking program in sibling HLA-identical stem cell transplantation for hematological malignancies and the factors influencing the usage rate of the stored cord blood units. Fifty families were enrolled from which, 48 cord blood units were successfully collected and 2 collections failed due to damaged cord/placenta at delivery. Among enrolled families 4 children needed transplantation; however, only one was successfully transplanted using the collected cord blood unit containing 2×107 nucleated cells/kg in conjunction with a small volume of bone marrow from the same HLA-identical donor. Two children received grafts from matched unrelated donors because their sibling cord blood was HLA-haploidentical, while the fourth one received bone marrow from his HLA-identical brother, since cord blood could not be collected due to damaged cord/placenta at delivery. With a median follow-up of 6years (range, 2–12) for the 9 remaining HLA-matched cord blood units, none from the prospective recipients needed transplantation. The low utilization rate of sibling cord blood in the setting of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for pediatric hematological malignant diseases necessitates the development of directed cord blood banking programs that limit long-term storage for banked cord blood units with low probability of usage such as non-HLA-identical or identical to patients who are in long-term complete remission.

gp130 on macrophages/granulocytes modulates inflammation during experimental tuberculosis,

Abstract: gp130 is a common receptor chain for cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-27 and IL-6. During experimental tuberculosis (TB), IL-27 prevents optimal antimycobacterial protection and limits the pathological sequelae of chronic inflammation. The anti-inflammatory properties of IL-27 have been attributed mainly to its suppressive effect on T helper (TH) cells. However, because gp130 cytokines also suppress the inflammatory immune response of macrophages, IL-27 may also regulate inflammation by limiting the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. To specifically address the role of gp130 cytokines on macrophages, the outcome of experimental TB was analysed in macrophage/neutrophil-specific gp130-deficient (LysMcre gp130loxP/loxP) mice. In these mice, the enhanced induction of inflammatory cytokines and increased expression of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) and LRG47 was linked to a greatly augmented TH17 immune response and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 expression. However, this amplified inflammatory immune response in Mtb-infected LysMcre gp130loxP/loxP mice was not associated with reduced bacterial loads and/or accelerated pathology. Our study revealed an immunoregulatory function of gp130 cytokines on macrophages/granulocytes, which is, however, not critical for modulating the outcome of TB.

Abstract: GBA3, also known as cytosolic β-glucosidase, is thought to hydrolyze xenobiotic glycosides in man. Deficiency of glucocerebrosidase (GBA), a β-glucosidase degrading glucosylceramide, underlies Gaucher disease. We examined GBA3, which recently was proposed to degrade glucosylceramide and influence the clinical manifestation of Gaucher disease. Recombinant GBA3 was found to hydrolyze artificial substrates such as 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-D-glucoside and C6-NBD-glucosylceramide, but hydrolysis of naturally occurring lipids like glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine was hardly detected. Consistent with this, inhibition of GBA3 in cultured cells using a novel inhibitor (alpha-1-C-nonyl-DIX) did not result in an additional increase in glucosylceramide as compared to GBA inhibition alone. Examination of the GBA3 gene led to the identification of a common substitution in its open reading frame (1368T→A), resulting in a truncated GBA3 protein missing the last α-helix of its (β/α)8 barrel. Both recombinant 1368A GBA3 and 1368A enzyme from spleen of a homozygous individual were found to be inactive. Amongst non-neuronopathic (type 1) Gaucher disease patients, we subsequently identified individuals being wild-type, heterozygous, or homozygous for the GBA3 1368T→A mutation. No correlation was observed between GBA3 1368A/T haplotypes and severity of type 1 Gaucher disease manifestation. In conclusion, GBA3 does not seem to modify type 1 Gaucher disease manifestation.

Abstract: Anchorage to matrix is mediated for many cells not only by integrin-based focal adhesions but also by a parallel assembly of integral and peripheral membrane proteins known as the Dystroglycan Complex. Deficiencies in either dystrophin (mdx mice) or γ-sarcoglycan (γSG−/− mice) components of the Dystroglycan Complex lead to upregulation of numerous focal adhesion proteins, and the phosphoprotein paxillin proves to be among the most prominent. In mdx muscle, paxillin-Y31 and Y118 are both hyper-phosphorylated as are key sites in focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and the stretch-stimulatable pro-survival MAPK pathway, whereas γSG−/− muscle exhibits more erratic hyper-phosphorylation. In cultured myotubes, cell tension generated by myosin-II appears required for localization of paxillin to adhesions while vinculin appears more stably integrated. Overexpression of wild-type (WT) paxillin has no obvious effect on focal adhesion density or the physical strength of adhesion, but WT and a Y118F mutant promote contractile sarcomere formation whereas a Y31F mutant shows no effect, implicating Y31 in striation. Self-peeling of cells as well as Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) probing of cells with or without myosin-II inhibition indicate an increase in cell tension within paxillin-overexpressing cells. However, prednisolone, a first-line glucocorticoid for muscular dystrophies, decreases cell tension without affecting paxillin at adhesions, suggesting a non-linear relationship between paxillin and cell tension. Hypertension that results from upregulation of integrin adhesions is thus a natural and treatable outcome of Dystroglycan Complex down-regulation.

Abstract: Since cord blood (CB) has become a commonly used source of transplantable hematopoietic stem (HSC) and hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC), there has been a need to overcome the limited HSC and HPC numbers available to transplant from a single CB, especially for adult recipients. Our laboratory previously demonstrated that Rheb2 overexpression significantly impaired the repopulating ability of HSC. Since overexpression of Rheb2 leads to increased signaling through mTOR, we examined the effect of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin ex vivo on cytokine expanded CD34+ CB cells for the engraftment of these cells in non-obese diabetic, severe combined immunodeficient, IL-2 receptor γ chain null (NSG) mice. We observed significant enhancement in engraftment of the CB treated ex vivo with cytokines in the presence of rapamycin prior to transplant, effects seen in primary as well as secondary transplants. These pre-clinical results suggest a positive role for rapamycin during ex vivo culture of CB SCID repopulating cells/HSC.

Abstract: α-thalassemia belongs to those inherited diseases in which large genomic deletions/duplications represent a significant proportion of causative mutations. Until recently, large α-globin gene cluster rearrangements have been mainly detected by gap-PCR and Southern blotting, methods that have significant drawbacks. We tested the recently developed multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay for deletional screening of the α-globin gene cluster in a cohort of 25 individuals suspected of having α-globin alteration(s), in which no or doubtful mutations had been found using conventional methods. In 13 out of 18 α-thalassemia carriers and in all 5 patients with HbH we found the causative α-globin defects. In 2 thalassemia intermedia patients, carriers of heterozygous β-globin mutations, the co-inheritance of homozygous α-genes triplication was detected. MLPA results were subsequently confirmed by real-time PCR. This study shows that MLPA can effectively identify different and unknown types of α-globin gene rearrangements, to allow characterizing previously unsolved α-thalassemia genotypes.

Abstract: L-selectin is a key molecule that participates in neutrophil tethering and subsequent rolling. It is cleaved from the surface of neutrophils activated in the presence of lipopolysaccharides, N-formyl-methionine-leucine-phenylalanine (fMLP), or Interleukin-8 (IL-8). We previously showed that L-selectin is also shed from the neutrophil surface during rolling on sialyl Lewis-x coated surfaces in a force-, ADAM-17 sheddase-, and p38 MAP kinase-dependent manner under flow. c-Abl tyrosine kinase is phosphorylated when L-selectin on the surface of neutrophils is cross-linked with anti-L-selectin antibodies. Here, we study the effect of c-Abl inhibition on L-selectin shedding from primary human neutrophils in static conditions following exposure to fMLP, IL-8, and hypotonic buffer and under flow through sialyl Lewis-x coated microtubes. Results indicate that c-Abl inhibition by STI571 significantly affects neutrophil adhesion via L-selectin, by decreasing the average rolling velocity and increasing the flux of rolling cells. The change in surface receptor expression was verified by flow cytometry. Interestingly, other forms of L-selectin shedding induced by fMLP, IL-8 or osmotic swelling were unaffected by STI571 treatment. These findings implicate the c-Abl signaling molecule in regulating L-selectin mechanical shedding in response to shear stress, setting this type of signaling apart from those triggered by the presence of a hypotonic environment, fMLP, or IL-8. This study sheds light on the role of c-Abl in neutrophil adhesion not previously reported in the literature.

Abstract: Resistance to chemotherapy and non-specific cytotoxicity are the major challenges to the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this study, we demonstrated that the disulfiram/copper (DS/Cu) complex alone exhibited cytotoxicity to doxorubicin (Dox) resistant leukemia HL60 cells (HL60/Dox) and enhanced cytotoxicity of Dox to HL60/Dox cells. DS/Cu inhibited Bcl-2 expression and enhanced Dox-induced apoptosis. DS/Cu/Dox in combination significantly induced c-Jun expression and JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation. JNK inhibitor Sp600125 attenuated DS/Cu/Dox-induced apoptosis and suppressed DS/Cu/Dox-induced protein expression in JNK/c-jun pathway. This study suggested that DS/Cu complex may re-sensitize HL60/Dox cells to Dox through activating JNK/c-jun as well as inhibiting anti-apoptotic bcl-2 expression.

Abstract: Nuclear pore complexes play a central role in controlling the traffic between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Progress during the last decade has highlighted nuclear periphery components as novel players in chromatin organization, gene regulation, and genome stability. For instance, lamins associate with repressive chromatin while nuclear pores tend to associate with active chromatin. Interestingly, nucleoporins (Nups) act not only at the nuclear periphery but also in the nucleoplasm. Here we provide an overview of the latest findings and discuss the functional importance of nucleoporin association with specific genes, their role in transcriptional memory, the coupling of transcription and mRNA export, and genome integrity.

Abstract: In immature dendritic cells (DCs) podosomes form and turn over behind the leading edge of migrating cells. The Arp2/3 complex activator Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein (WASP) localises to the actin core of forming podosomes together with WASP-Interacting Protein (WIP). A second weaker Arp2/3 activator, cortactin, is also found at podosomes where it has been proposed to participate in matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) secretion. We have previously shown that WIP−/− DCs are unable to make podosomes. WIP binds to cortactin and in this report we address whether WIP regulates cortactin-mediated MMP activity. Using DCs derived from splenic murine precursors, we found that wild-type cells were able to localise MMPs at podosomes where matrix degradation takes place. In contrast, WIP−/− DCs remain able to synthesise MMPs but do not degrade the extracellular matrix. Infection of WIP KO DCs with lentivirus expressing WIP restored both podosome formation and their ability to degrade the extracellular matrix, implicating WIP-induced podosomes as foci of functional MMP location. When WIP KO DCs were infected with a mutant form of WIP lacking the cortactin-binding domain (WIPΔ110-170) DCs were only able to elaborate disorganised podosomes that were unable to support MMP-mediated matrix degradation. Taken together, these results suggest a role for WIP not only in WASP-mediated actin polymerisation and podosome formation, but also in cortactin-mediated extracellular matrix degradation by MMPs.

Abstract: Here we report about an interdisciplinary workshop focusing on the effects of the local growth-environment on the regulation of stem cell development. Under the title “Towards a quantitative understanding of stem cell/ niche interaction: Experiments, models, and technologies“, 33 experts from eight countries discussed current knowledge, new experimental and theoretical results as well as innovative measurement technologies. Specifically, the workshop addressed the following questions: What defines a stem cell niche? What are functional/regulatory characteristics of stem cell– microenvironment interactions? What experimental systems and technologies for quantifying niche function are available? As a consensus result it was recorded that there is no unique niche architecture across tissues but that there are generic principles of niche organization guaranteeing a proper function of stem cells. This functional aspect, as the major defining criterion, leads to the conclusion that stem cells and their niches need to be considered as an inseparable pair with implications for their experimental assessment: To be able to study any of those two components, the other component has to be accounted for. In this context, a number of classical in vitro assays using co-cultures of stem and stroma cells, but also new, specifically bioengineered culture systems have been discussed with respect to their advantages and disadvantages. Finally, there was a general agreement that the comprehensive understanding of niche-mediated stem cell regulation will, due to the complexity of involved mechanisms, require an interdisciplinary, systems biological approach. In addition to cell and molecular biology, biochemistry, biophysics and bioengineering also bioinformatics and mathematical modeling will play a major role in the future of this field.

Abstract: Congenital methemoglobinemia due to NADH–cytochrome b5 reductase 3 (CYB5R3) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder that occurs sporadically worldwide, although endemic clusters of this disorder have been identified in certain ethnic groups. It is present as two distinct phenotypes, type I and type II. Type I methemoglobinemia is characterized by CYB5R3 enzyme deficiency restricted to erythrocytes and is associated with benign cyanosis. The less frequent type II methemoglobinemia is associated with generalized CYB5R3 deficiency affecting all cells and is lethal in early infancy. Here we describe the molecular basis of type I methemoglobinemia due to CYB5R3 deficiency in four patients from three distinct ethnic backgrounds, Asian Indian, Mexican and Greek. The CYB5R3 gene of three probands with type I methemoglobinemia and their relatives were sequenced revealing several putative causative mutations; in one subject multiple mutations were present. Two novel mutations, S54R and F157C, were identified and the previously described A179T, V253M mutations were also identified. All these point mutations mapped to the NADH binding domain and or the FAD binding domain. Each has the potential to sterically hinder cofactor binding causing instability of the CYB5R3 protein. Wild-type CYB5R3, as well as two of these novel mutations, S54R and F157C, was amplified, cloned, and purified recombinant peptide obtained. Kinetic and thermodynamic studies of these proteins show that the above mutations lead to decreased thermal stability.

Abstract: Interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays an important role in immune responses and signals via two different pathways. When IL-6 binds to its non-signalling membrane-bound receptor (IL-6R), a non-covalent dimer of the ubiquitous interleukin-6 signal transducer gp130 is recruited to initiate intracellular signalling cascades. This so-called classical signalling pathway is restricted to cells expressing the membrane-bound IL-6R, such as hepatocytes and certain leukocytes. In addition, an alternative trans-signalling pathway uses soluble forms of IL-6R (sIL-6R) in complex with IL-6 to activate cells expressing gp130, but not membrane-bound IL-6R. In both cases, a tetrameric or hexameric signalling complex consisting of two gp130 molecules and one or two molecules each of IL-6 and (s)IL-6R is formed. The structure of the hexameric complex of the ligand-binding domains of gp130 (D1–D3) with IL-6 and sIL-6R has been solved by X-ray crystallography as well as the full-length extracellular part of gp130 (D1–D6) as a monomer. Since gp130 exists as a preformed dimer on the cell surface, we used a sgp130Fc fusion protein – consisting of two extracellular gp130 regions (D1–D6) dimerised by an IgG1-Fc part – to study the structure of unliganded gp130 extracellular domains in solution by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The SAXS data indicated that sgp130Fc forms a rigid molecule in solution. The low resolution structural model reveals an elongated assembly with an Fc base and two gp130 arms, whereby the orientation of the ligand-binding domains D1–D3 with respect to the membrane-proximal domains D4–D6 differs from that in the crystallographic monomer. Functional implications of these findings are discussed.

Abstract: Ras-related GTPases of the Miro family have been implicated in mitochondrial homeostasis and microtubule-dependent transport. They consist of two GTP-binding domains separated by calcium-binding motifs and of a C-terminal transmembrane domain that targets the protein to the outer mitochondrial membrane. We disrupted the single Miro-encoding gene in Dictyostelium discoideum and observed a substantial growth defect that we attribute to a decreased mitochondrial mass and cellular ATP content. However, mutant cells even showed an increased rate of oxygen consumption, while glucose consumption, mitochondrial transmembrane potential and production of reactive oxygen species were unaltered. Processes characteristic of the multicellular stage of the D. discoideum life cycle were also unaltered. Although mitochondria occasionally use microtubules for transport in D. discoideum, their size and distribution were not visibly affected. We found Miro in all branches of the eukaryotic tree with the exception of a few protist lineages (mainly those lacking typical mitochondria). Trypanosomatids and ciliates possess structurally unique homologs lacking the N-terminal or the C-terminal GTPase domain, respectively. We propose that in D. discoideum, as in yeasts and plants, Miro plays roles in mitochondrial homeostasis, but the ability to build a complex that regulates its association to kinesin for microtubule-dependent transport probably arose in metazoans.

Abstract: Intercellular communication via GAP Junctions plays an important role in tissue homeostasis, apoptosis, carcinogenesis, cell proliferation and differentiation. Hepatocyte connexins (Cx) 26 and 32 levels are decreased during the de-differentiation process of primary hepatocytes in culture, a situation that is also characterized by a decrease in S-Adenosylmethionine (SAMe) levels. In this current study, we show that SAMe supplementation in cultured hepatocytes every 12h, leads to an up-regulation of Cx26 and 32 mRNA and protein levels and blocks culture-induced Cx43 expression, although it failed to increase Cx26 and 32 membrane localization and GAP junction intracellular communication. SAMe reduced nuclear β-catenin accumulation, which is known to stimulate the TCF/LEF-dependent gene transcription of Cx43. Moreover SAMe-induced reduction in Cx43 and β-catenin was prevented by the proteasome inhibitor MG132, and was not mediated by GSK3 activity. SAMe, and its metabolite 5′-methylthioadenosine (MTA) increased Cx26 mRNA in a process partially mediated by Adenosine A2A receptors but independent of PKA. Finally livers from MAT1A knockout mice, characterized by low hepatic SAMe levels, express higher Cx43 and lower Cx26 and 32 protein levels than control mice. These results suggest that SAMe maintains a characteristic expression pattern of the different Cxs in hepatocytes by differentially regulating their levels.

Abstract: Recently, an acute restriction of imiglucerase has occurred as a result of viral contamination and manufacturing problems. A position statement from the European Working Group for Gaucher Disease and European Gaucher Alliance established a set of key recommendations for identifying and monitoring at-risk patients. In Spain, a profile of the shortage situation was obtained through follow-up of patients with Gaucher disease (GD) and compliance with the therapy recommendations. Here we describe a group of patients, with modified doses of imiglucerase, during the shortage. Fifty adult GD1 patients (25 males/25 females), previously on ERT, were analysed before and after the 6-month shortage. The mean age was 45.3±15.3years (range: 18–84). The mean Severity Score Index at diagnosis was 8.7±3.8 (range: 3–19); 20% of patients were splenectomized; and 78% had bone disease. During the shortage, 23 patients (46%) discontinued therapy; as complications in this group only one patient suffered a bone crisis and another anaemia (Hb <10.0g/dL). The mean reduction of haemoglobin level (−2.7%) and platelet counts (−5.4%) were non-significant. Chitotriosidase (CT) activity was increased 135% (p<0.03) and CCL18/PARC 8.2% (p<0.08) in this group. Imiglucerase was reduced by 50% in 17 patients (34%) in this group, seven patients (41.0%) suffered bone pain, three of them true bone crisis and four (23.5%) required support therapy. The mean reduction of haemoglobin (−2.8%) and platelet counts (−10.7%), CT activity was increased 48.2% (p<0.03) and no changes were observed in CCL18/PARC concentration. In both groups no significant changes in visceral size were observed. In 3 patients (6%), imiglucerase was reduced 75% and 7 patients (14%) needed to switch to another ERT (4 patients) or miglustat (3 patients) due to a restart of symptomatic disease. In Spain the 6 first months shortage of imiglucerase have produced a 20% incidence of bone pain, one case of anaemia, and a significant increase in CT activity. Fourteen percent of patients had to switch to another therapy. No significant changes in blood counts, visceral volumes and CCL18/PARC concentration were observed.

Abstract: Background
Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is a technique that enables identification of unaffected embryos prior to in vitro fertilization (IVF) transfer in couples at risk for a Mendelian disorder. Most cases involve severe genetic diseases with neurological features and/or major malformations. We present two couples in which PGD was performed for prevention of type 1 Gaucher disease, a non-neuronopathic, non-lethal disorder.
Materials and methods
We developed a multiplex fluorescent PCR protocol, simultaneously amplifying the familial mutations and eight closely spaced, highly polymorphic informative microsatellite markers surrounding the gene, to be used for PGD analysis.
Results
Couple #1 mother was homozygous for the N370S mutation and the father carried the 84GG mutation; their first daughter receives specific Gaucher therapy. One PGD cycle resulted in seven embryos of which four had the paternal wild type allele; two were transferred resulting in a healthy baby boy born at term. Couple #2, each a carrier (N370S and R359Q), whose first-born child had died (age 5years) of Gaucher disease, underwent 7 PGD cycles. Only one cycle resulted in a clinical pregnancy but a miscarriage was followed at 10weeks.
Conclusions
PGD is an effective and accurate method for preventing Gaucher disease type I in carrier couples. Since this disease is treatable, special ethical considerations and careful selection of couples should be performed.

Abstract: Caveolae are specialized plasma membrane subdomains with a distinct lipid and protein composition, which play an essential role in cell physiology by performing trafficking and signalling functions. The structure and functions of caveolae have been shown to require caveolin-1, a major protein component of caveolae. Caveolin-1 expression and secretion are increased in metastatic prostate cancer, and caveolin-1 seems to contribute to prostate cancer growth and metastasis. Recently, a cytoplasmic protein named PTRF (Polymerase I and Transcript Release Factor) or cavin-1 was found to be required, in concert with caveolin-1, for the formation and functions of caveolae. Genetic ablation of PTRF results in loss of caveolae while caveolin-1 is still expressed, albeit at reduced level, but associates with flat plasma membrane. In metastatic PC3 prostate cancer cells that express abundant caveolin-1 but no PTRF, heterologous PTRF expression restores caveola formation and caveolin-1 distribution (Hill et al., 2008; Cell 132, 113–124). We now show that PTRF/cavin-1-expressing PC3 cells exhibit decreased migration, and that this effect is mediated by reduced MMP9 production. PTRF/cavin-1, and to a lesser extent, cavin-2, -3, and -4 all decreased MMP9. We further show that the PTRF/cavin-1-mediated reduction of MMP9 production is independent of caveola formation. Taken together, our results suggest that PTRF/cavin-1 expression alters prostate cancer aggressiveness.

Ret finger protein 2 enhances ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis via degradation of AKT and MDM2,

Abstract: Ret finger protein 2 (RFP2), a gene frequently deleted in multiple tumor types, encodes a protein with a RING finger, B-box, and coiled-coil domain that belongs to the RBCC/TRIM protein family. Although RBCC proteins are involved in diverse cellular processes such as apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation, and transcriptional regulation, the biological function of RFP2 has not been well defined. Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of RFP2 in cells induced apoptosis through proteasomal degradation of MDM2 and AKT. The expression of RFP2, which possesses RING domain-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, was increased by ionizing radiation dose- and time-dependently, and RFP2 overexpression induced cell death with increased expression of apoptotic molecules (p53, p21, and Bax). These results depended on the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of RFP2 because mutant RFP2, which contains a mutated RING domain, failed to drive apoptosis compared with wild-type RFP2. We observed that RFP2 formed a complex with MDM2, a negative regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor, and AKT, a regulator of apoptosis inhibition at the cellular level. Additionally, we found that the interaction of RFP2 with MDM2 and AKT resulted in ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of MDM2 and AKT in vivo and in vitro. Thus, these data suggest that irradiation causes RFP2 overexpression, which enhances ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis by increasing p53 stability and decreasing AKT kinase activity through MDM2 and AKT degradation.

Abstract: The basal uptake and cytoplasmic binding of cobalt was studied in human red cells using 57Co as tracer. The basal uptake is linear with time, at a rate of about 10μmol (l cells)−1 h−1 at 100μM [Co2+]o, and is almost irreversible, as there is hardly any efflux into excess EDTA. Ionophore A23187 mediates a rapid equilibration of Co2+ across the cell membrane leading to a marked accumulation, reflecting effective cytoplasmic buffering. The fraction (αCo) of total cell cobalt being present as free, ionized Co2+ is estimated at αCo=0.01 from the equilibrium distribution of cobalt, and also from the initial slope of the cobalt buffering curve. The cobalt accumulation is similar in fed and ATP-depleted cells. The buffering curve for [CoT]c can be fitted by a Michaelis type function with Bmax=24mmol (l cells)−1 and half-saturation at 240μM [Co2+]c. The tracer influx curves are adequately fitted by single exponentials, whereas the net influx curves all require at least double exponential fits, probably due to non-stationary A23187 kinetics. The rate of tracer influx decreases with increasing cobalt concentration, and increases with delayed addition of 57Co tracer during net uptake. This might be explained by an ‘auto-inhibition’ by cobalt. The kinetics for A23187-mediated net and tracer influx of 54Mn is very similar to that of 57Co, whereas the net influx of 65Zn can be fitted by single exponentials. In cobalt-loaded cells the cobalt is partly reversibly bound, being releasable by excess extracellular EGTA in the presence of A23187, and partly tightly bound, remaining in the cells even at high ionophore concentrations. The tightly bound fraction builds up over time, and is larger and develops earlier in fed cells compared to ATP-depleted cells. However, all cell cobalt appears to exchange with 57Co during tracer influx. It is speculated that oxidation of Co2+ to Co3+ could lead to the high affinity binding. Tight binding is not observed in the case of 54Mn. Tightly bound and the major part of reversibly bound 57Co co-migrate with hemoglobin in Sephadex column chromatography of a lysate of 57Co-loaded cells. 57Co also co-migrates with hemoglobin when added to a lysate of unlabeled cells or to a solution of purified hemoglobin, in both cases with a time-dependent development of tight binding. Cobalt is known to bind to the globin moiety of hemoglobin. The results imply that during long-term cobalt exposure in vivo cobalt will be taken up practically irreversibly in the red cells during their 120days life span. Thus, for biomonitoring of cobalt exposure, it could be appropriate to measure the cobalt content in red cells to give, compared with timed or in-competition whole-blood and serum analysis, an average value for the exposure over the last couple of months.

Abstract: The potassium chloride co-transporter (KCC) is a member of the electroneutral cation chloride family of cotransporters found in multiple tissues that are involved in transepithelial ion transport and regulation of intracellular ion content and cell volume. We have shown previously that three of the four KCC genes – KCC1, KCC3, and KCC4 – are expressed in red blood cells (RBC) (Exp. Hem. 33:624, 2005). Functionally, the KCC mediates volume reduction of reticulocytes that establishes the higher cellular hemoglobin concentration (CHC) of mature RBC. KCC activity is higher in reticulocytes and diminishes with age. KCC activity in RBC containing sickle hemoglobin (SS RBC) is elevated compared to normal (AA RBC) in part due to reticulocytosis in SS blood. However, we have demonstrated that SS reticulocytes have abnormal regulation of KCC activity leading to increased CHC upon activation of KCC compared to AA reticulocytes (Blood 104:2954, 2004; Blood 109:1734, 2007). These findings implicate KCC as a factor in the dehydration of SS RBC, which leads to elevated Hb S concentration and enhances Hb S polymerization and hemolysis. Because KCC activity correlates with cell age, standard flux measurements on blood samples with different numbers of reticulocytes or young non-reticulocytes are not comparable. The Advia automated cell counter measures cell volume (MCV) and cellular hemoglobin concentration (CHC) in reticulocytes, an age-defined population of cells, and thus circumvents the problem of variable reticulocyte counts among SS and AA blood samples. In this study, reticulocyte CHC measurements on fresh blood demonstrated a clear difference between AA and SS cells, reflecting in vivo dehydration of SS reticulocytes, although there was significant inter-individual variation, and the CHC distributions of the two groups overlapped. After KCC activation in vitro by cell swelling using the nystatin method, the initial changes in reticulocyte MCV and CHC with time were used to estimate flux rates mediated by KCC, assuming that changes were associated with isotonic KCl movements. After 20–30min a final steady state MCV/CHC (set point) was achieved and maintained, reflecting inactivation of the transporter. CHC set points were 26.5–29g/dl in SS reticulocytes compared to 25–26.5g/dl in AA reticulocytes, reflecting abnormal regulation in SS cells. These results were reproducible in the same individual over time. KCC flux derived from CHC ranged from 5 to 10.3mmolK/kgHb/min in SS reticulocytes, compared to 2.9–7.2mmolK/kgHb/min in AA reticulocytes. Such measures of KCC activity in red cell populations controlled for cell age will facilitate further studies correlating KCC activity with phenotypic or genetic variability in sickle cell disease.

Abstract: The actin-filament associated protein (AFAP) family of adaptor proteins consists of three members: AFAP1, AFAP1L1, and AFAP1L2/XB130 with AFAP1 being the best described as a cSrc binding partner and actin cross-linking protein. A homology search of AFAP1 recently identified AFAP1L1 which has a similar sequence, domain structure and cellular localization; however, based upon sequence variations, AFAP1L1 is hypothesized to have unique functions that are distinct from AFAP1. While AFAP1 has the ability to bind to the SH3 domain of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase cSrc via an N-terminal SH3 binding motif, it was unable to bind cortactin. However, the SH3 binding motif of AFAP1L1 was more efficient at interacting with the SH3 domain of cortactin and not cSrc. AFAP1L1 was shown by fluorescence microscopy to decorate actin filaments and move to punctate actin structures and colocalize with cortactin, consistent with localization to invadosomes. Upon overexpression in A7r5 cells, AFAP1L1 had the ability to induce podosome formation and move to podosomes without stimulation. Immunohistochemical analysis of AFAP1L1 in human tissues shows differential expression when contrasted with AFAP1 with localization of AFAP1L1 to unique sites in muscle and the dentate nucleus of the brain where AFAP1 was not detectable. We hypothesize AFAP1L1 may play a similar role to AFAP1 in affecting changes in actin filaments and bridging interactions with binding partners, but we hypothesize that AFAP1L1 may forge unique protein interactions in which AFAP1 is less efficient, and these interactions may allow AFAP1L1 to affect invadosome formation.

Abstract: Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive glycolipid lysosomal storage disease caused by a deficiency of the β-glucocerebrosidase enzyme (GBA). Allelic heterogeneity in GD has been well described. To date, more than 270 different GBA mutations have been reported. In order to determine the GBA mutation spectrum in Korean GD patients, we performed GBA mutation analysis of Korean patients and identified 72 GBA mutant alleles from 36 unrelated patients (100% identification), including 60 single-nucleotide substitutions, 6 single-nucleotide deletions, 4 recombinants, 1 splicing error, and 1 complex allele. N370S, the most common GBA mutation, was not detected, and most of the Korean GBA mutations were previously known to be rare, with the exception of L444P (~21%). Three mutations, P201H, F347L+L444P, and c.630delC, are novel. Examination of the GBA mutant alleles found in 6 ethnic groups revealed that the prevalences of GBA mutant alleles in Korean patients are very different from those seen in Jewish, non-Jewish Caucasian, and Italian patients, but similar to those seen in Japanese and Chinese patients. Our data may provide greater understanding of GBA allelic heterogeneity and an Asian perspective11Hyon J. Kim, Gaucher disease: an Asian perspective, Journal of Japanese Society for Inherited Metabolic Disease 20(1) (2004) 48-50. on correlations between genotypes and phenotypes, which may help further the development of better management strategies for patients with GD.

Abstract: Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding proteins IGF2BP1, IGF2BP2, and IGF2BP3 have been shown to have diagnostic and prognostic utility in a number of epithelial and soft tissue tumors. Still, little is known about the expression of these molecules in different types of leukemia and our study aims to fill this gap. By using an RT–qPCR approach, we have systemically analyzed the expression of three IGF2BP coding genes in normal hematopoietic tissues and distinct acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) entities. We show that low/negative IGF2BP1 and IGF2BP3 and high IGF2BP2 levels are characteristic to healthy donor bone marrow and peripheral blood whereas different B-ALL entities displayed characteristic perturbations of IGF2BP expression patterns. Namely, we have identified significant associations of overexpressed IGF2BP1 with ETV6/RUNX1-positive (r2=0.7891, y=0.8105x−0.4471, p<0.0001), underexpressed IGF2BP2 with E2A/PBX1-positive (p<0.01), and overexpressed IGF2BP2 and IGF2BP3 with MLL/AF4-positive (r2=0.6571, y=0.1507x−0.2722, p<0.0001, and r2=0.7022, y=0.6482x−0.7660, p<0.0001, respectively) leukemia. Secondly, based on transcript expression dynamics during follow-up, we conclude that overexpression of only IGF2BP1 is inherent characteristic of ETV6/RUNX1-positive leukemic blasts in contrast to IGF2BP3 which remained stably expressed throughout the monitoring period and upon the achievement of molecular remission. Finally, our data suggest that IGF2BP3 might be a marker of disease aggressiveness in BCR/ABL1-positive ALL as consistently increasing levels of this transcript during follow-up predicted eventual leukemia relapse by three months. Altogether, our results highlight the potential utility of IGF2BP profiling in precursor B lymphoid neoplasms as the functions of IGF2BPs in normal and malignant hematopoiesis are further delineated.

Glycosaminoglycans inhibit the adherence and the spreading of osteoclasts and their precursors: Role in osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption,

Abstract: The bone microenvironment (e.g. glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), growth factors) plays a major role in bone resorption, especially in the formation of osteoclasts which differentiate from the hematopoietic lineage in the presence of RANKL. Previous studies revealed that GAGs may influence osteoclastogenesis, but data are very controversial, some studies showing an inhibitory effect of GAGs on osteoclastic differentiation whereas others demonstrated a stimulatory effect. To clarify their activities, we investigated the effect of 5 families of GAGs in three different models of human/mouse osteoclastogenesis. The present data revealed that heparin inhibited osteoclastogenesis in these three models, which was confirmed by a decrease in mRNA expression of osteoclastic markers and by an inhibition of the bone resorption capacity. We also demonstrated in RAW 264.7 cells that other families of GAGs different from heparin inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis, and that this inhibition was dependent on the length and the level of sulfation of GAGs. In the present work, heparin did not bind to RANKL and did not modulate RANKL signaling. Heparin acted at 2 distinct steps of osteoclastogenesis from human CD14+ cells: first, heparin strongly decreased the adherence of osteoclast precursors, and secondly inhibited osteoclasts to spread and to be active. Furthermore, the second action of heparin was reversible as the removal of heparin at the end of the culture time allowed the condensed cells to spread out and showed the formation of morphological active osteoclasts.

Abstract: Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disorder, caused by deficient activity of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase, which can be treated by enzyme-replacement therapy (ERT). No prognostic marker can predict long-term complications of GD but several markers are used in therapeutic monitoring: chitotriosidase, total serum ferritin (TSF), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). They all increase with disease progression and generally decrease under ERT. This study was undertaken to investigate ferritin glycoforms, i.e., glycosylated ferritin (GF) and non-glycosylated ferritin (NGF) concentrations, as potential markers for the follow-up of GD therapy. GF and NGF determinations for GD patients followed in a single center between 1996 and 2007 were analyzed using two approaches: (1) the serum levels of 12 untreated patients were compared with those of 10 patients after 48months on ERT; (2) the evolution of serum levels under ERT in 15 patients were analyzed using linear/logarithmic mixed models. TSF and NGF levels did not differed significantly between untreated patients and those on ERT (TSF: 524.5 (range 221.0–2045.0) μg/L vs. 410.5 (range 115.0–1587.0) μg/L, respectively, p=0.72; NGF: 340.0 (range 182.8–1717.8) μg/L vs. 199.9 (range 77.1–649.8) μg/L, p=0.09). The percent GF was significantly lower in untreated patients than in those on ERT (27.0% (range 8.0–51.0) vs. 43.5% (range 22.0–80.0) respectively; p=0.02). The percent GF increased significantly during ERT (slope=0.156% [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.03; 0.29] per month, p=0.01) regardless of whether NGF and TSF significantly decreased during ERT (slope=−1.4% per month [95%CI, −1.9%; −1.0%], p<0.0001; slope=–1.1% [95%CI, −1.6%; −0.6%] per month, p<0.0007, respectively). Thus, GF is low in untreated GD patients. GF and NGF changed significantly under ERT and might be of clinical value for GD management under treatment.

Abstract: In trying to contribute to our knowledge on the role of Notch and its ligands within the human hematopoietic system, we have assessed the effects of the OP9 stroma cell line – naturally expressing Jagged-1 – transduced with either the Delta-1 gene (OP9-DL1 cells) or with vector alone (OP9-V), on the in vitro growth of two different hematopoietic cell populations. Primitive (CD34+ CD38− Lin−) and intermediate (CD34+ CD38+ Lin−) CD34+ cell subsets from human cord blood were cultured in the presence of 7 stimulatory cytokines under four different conditions: cytokines alone (control); cytokines and mesenchymal stromal cells; cytokines and OP9-V cells; cytokines and OP9-DL1 cells. Proliferation and expansion were determined after 7days of culture. Culture of CD34+ CD38− Lin− cells in the presence of OP9-V or OP9-DL1 cells resulted in a significant increase in the production of new CD34+ CD38− Lin− cells (expansion), which expressed increased levels of Notch-1; in contrast, production of total nucleated cells (proliferation) was reduced, as compared to control conditions. In cultures of CD34+ CD38+ Lin− cells established in the presence of OP9-V or OP9-DL1 cells, expansion was similar to that observed in control conditions, whereas proliferation was also reduced. Interestingly, in these latter cultures we observed production of CD34+ CD38− Lin− cells. Our results indicate that, as compared to MSC, OP9 cells were more efficient at inducing self-renewal and/or de novo generation of primitive (CD34+ CD38− Lin−) cells, and suggest that such effects were due, at least in part, to the presence of Jagged-1 and DL1.

Abstract: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, an X-linked disorder, is usually observed in hemizygote males and very rarely in females. The G6PD class 1 variants, very uncommon, are associated with chronic hemolytic anemia. Here we report a Portuguese woman who suffered in her sixties from a chronic hemolytic anemia due to G6PD deficiency. Molecular studies revealed heterozygosity for an in-frame 18-bp deletion, mapping to exon 10 leading to a deletion of 6 residues, 362–367 (LNERKA), which is a novel G6PD class 1 variant, G6PD Tondela. Two of her three daughters, asymptomatic, with G6PD activity within the normal range, are heterozygous for the same deletion. The patient's leukocyte and reticulocyte mRNA studies revealed an almost exclusive expression of the mutant allele, explaining the chronic hemolytic anemia. Patient whole blood genomic DNA HUMARA assay showed a balanced pattern of X chromosome inactivation (XCI), but granulocyte DNA showed extensive skewing, harboring the mutated allele, implying that in whole blood, lymphocyte DNA, with a very long lifetime, may cover up the current high XCI skewing. This observation indicates that HUMARA assay in women should be assessed in granulocytes and not in total leukocytes.

Abstract: When highly invasive cancer cells are cultured on an extracellular matrix substrate, they extend proteolytically active membrane protrusions, termed invadopodia, from their ventral surface into the underlying matrix. Our understanding of the molecular composition of invadopodia has rapidly advanced in the last few years, but is far from complete. To accelerate component discovery, we resorted to a proteomics approach by applying DIfference Gel Electrophoresis (DIGE) to compare invadopodia-enriched sub-cellular fractions with cytosol and cell body membrane fractions and the whole cell lysate. The fractionation procedure was validated through step-by-step monitoring of the enrichment in typical actin-related invadopodia-associated proteins. After statistical analysis, 129 protein spots were selected for peptide mass fingerprinting analysis; of these 76 were successfully identified and found to correspond to 58 proteins belonging to different functional classes including aerobic glycolysis and other metabolic pathways, protein synthesis, degradation and folding, cytoskeletal components and membrane-associated proteins. Finally, validation of a number of identified proteins was carried out by a combination of immuno-blotting on cell fractions and immunofluorescence localization at invadopodia. These results reveal newly identified components of invadopodia and open further avenues to the molecular study of invasive growth behavior of cancer cells.

Abstract: Angiogenesis, a hallmark of tumor growth, is regulated by various angiogenic factors. Recent studies have shown that osteopontin (OPN) is a secreted, integrin-binding protein that contributes to glioma progression. However, its effect on the angiogenesis of gliomas is not fully understood. To elucidate the role of OPN in the process of glioma angiogenesis, endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) were treated with conditioned media of human glioma SHG44 cells overexpressing OPN. Here, we identified that OPN secreted by glioma cells accelerated EPCs angiogenesis in vitro, including proliferation, migration, and tube formation. OPN also induced the activation of AKT and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and increased NO production without affecting the expression of VEGF, VEGFR-1, or VEGFR-2. Moreover, the avβ3 antibody, the PI3-K inhibitor LY294002 and the eNOS inhibitor NMA suppressed the OPN-mediated increase in NO production and angiogenesis in EPCs. Taken together, these results demonstrate that OPN directly stimulates angiogenesis via the avβ3/PI3-K/AKT/eNOS/NO signaling pathway and may play an important role in tumorigenesis by enhancing angiogenesis in gliomas.

Abstract: Our data on 114 Iranian individuals with thalassemia intermedia phenotype revealed homozygous or compound heterozygous beta-globin mutations to be the predominant disease factor in 86.2% of cases. However, 8.2% of these individuals were found to be heterozygous or wild type for beta-globin mutations. In search for determinants outside of the beta-globin gene, which could be responsible for the unexpected thalassemia intermedia phenotype in these subjects, we screened the alpha-globin genes, the 5′HS3 and 5′HS4 regions of the beta-globin LCR, and the NF-E2 transcription factor for sequence variations in selected individuals. The -3.7 deletion was the only alpha-globin mutation detected, and no alterations were found in 5′HS3 and NF-E2. Sequence analysis of the 5′HS4 LCR core region identified three known SNPs in a single patient, who required irregular blood transfusions. The A/G polymorphism in the 5′HS4 palindromic region was also observed to be variable. Family studies were carried out on a female G/G homozygous patient, who received irregular blood transfusions. Her father, who had the same heterozygous IVSII-1 beta-globin mutation but the A/G genotype at the 5′HS4 palindromic site, presented with mild anemia and no requirement for blood transfusions. This suggests an impact of SNPs in the 5′HS4 LCR core region on the thalassemia phenotype and offers an interesting subject for further investigations in the Iranian population.

Abstract: Identification of the beta globin gene mutation-related haplotypes is of interest for the delineation of the clinical heterogeneity as well as understanding of the origin and spreading of the beta globin gene mutations. We screened the whole beta globin gene in 197 Turkish patients by direct sequencing and performed Haploview analyses for beta globin gene haplotyping using five common intragenic SNPs; rs713040, rs10768683, rs7480526, rs7946748, and rs1609812. We found 25 different beta globin gene point mutations by sequencing. A Turkish type of inv/del mutation by MLPA and Gap-PCR was also detected with additional studies. The seven most common mutations with higher frequency of 5% were IVS-I-110 (G>A) (35.6%), Hb S(10.6%), IVS-I-6 (T>C) (7.4%), IVS-I-1 (G>A) (6.9%), IVS-II-1 (G>A) (6.9%), Cod8(−AA) (6%), IVS-II-745 (C>G) (5.1%) and accounted for 78.7% of all mutations. We identified seven different haplotypes (Haplotype I–VII) using five intragenic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped by sequencing of the beta globin gene. The association between the mutations and the haplotypes was defined for 16 different mutations. We suggest that haplotyping by these five intragenic SNPs will provide useful information about the origin of the mutations and gene flow among as well as the explanation of the clinical heterogeneity.

Abstract: The Drosophila visual transduction cascade is embedded in the rhabdomeres of photoreceptor cells and culminates in the opening of the two ion channels, TRP and TRPL. TRPL translocates from the rhabdomeres to the cell body upon illumination and vice versa when flies are kept in the dark. Here, we studied the mechanisms underlying the light-dependent internalization of TRPL. Co-localization of TRPL and rhodopsin in endocytic particles revealed that TRPL is internalized by a vesicular transport pathway that is also utilized, at least partially, for rhodopsin endocytosis. TRPL internalization is attenuated under light conditions that result in a high rate of rhodopsin internalization and is highest in orange light that result in very little rhodopsin internalization. In line with a canonical vesicular transport pathway, we found that rab proteins, Rab5 and RabX4, are required for the internalization of TRPL into the cell body. Our results provide insight into stimulus-dependent internalization of a prominent member of the TRP superfamily.

Abstract: Studies of hemolytic agents on G6PD-deficient subjects have been extensively performed on red blood cells obtained from donors, only using in vitro methods. However, there has been no adequate G6PD-deficient animal model for in vivo assessment of potentially hemolytic agents. The objective of this study is to establish a novel mouse model of severe G6PD-deficiency, with high susceptibility to hemolytic damage upon oxidative agents. To create this model, G6PD mutant Gpdx allele was introduced into the C57L/J mouse strain background by breeding program. The hemolytic toxicity of naphthalene and its metabolite α-naphthol on G6PD-deficient red blood cells was evaluated. Our data showed that the F2 homozygous Gpdx mutant with C57L/J background exhibiting the G6PD activity was 0.9±0.1U/g Hb, level similar to those of G6PD deficiency in human. A significantly negative correlation was demonstrated between GSH percentage reduction and G6PD activity (r=−0.51, p<0.001) upon challenge of the red blood cells with alpha-naphthol in vitro. Similar correlation was also found between GSSG elevation and G6PD activity. Our in vivo studies showed that the administration of naphthalene at 250mg/kg inflicted significant oxidative damage to the G6PD-deficient mice, as illustrated by the decrease of the GSH-to-GSSG ratio (by 34.2%, p=0.005) and the increase of the methemoglobin level (by 1.9 fold, p<0.001). Hemolytic anemia was also found in G6PD-deficient mice at this dosage of naphthalene. In summary, this novel mouse model could be utilized as a screening platform to more accurately determine the hemolytic toxicity of pharmacological agents on G6PD-deficient subjects.

Abstract: In Paramecium multimicronucleatum, the discoidal vesicles, the acidosomes and the 100-nm carrier vesicles are involved in phagosome formation, phagosome acidification and endosomal processing, respectively. Numerous cross bridges link these vesicles to the kinetic side of the microtubules of a cytopharyngeal microtubular ribbon. Vesicles are translocated along these ribbons in a minus-end direction towards the cytopharynx. A monoclonal antibody specific for the light vanadate-photocleaved fragment of the heavy chain of cytoplasmic dynein was used to show that this dynein is located between the discoidal vesicles and the ribbons as well as on the cytosolic surface of the acidosomes and the 100-nm carrier vesicles. This antibody inhibited the docking of the vesicles to the microtubular ribbons so that the transport of discoidal vesicles and acidosomes were reduced by 60% and 70%, respectively. It had little effect on the dynein's velocity of translocation. These results show that cytoplasmic dynein is the motor for vesicle translocation and its location, between the vesicles and the ribbons, indicates that the cross bridges seen at this location in thin sections and in quick-frozen, deep-etched replicas are apparently the working dyneins. Such a working dynein cross bridge, as preserved by ultra-rapid freezing, is 54nm long and has two legs arising from a globular head that appears to be firmly bound to its cargo vesicle and each leg consists of ≥3 beaded subunits with the last subunit making contact with the microtubular ribbon.

Abstract: Background
DMT1 is a transmembrane iron transporter involved in iron duodenal absorption and cellular iron uptake. Mutations in the human SLC11A2 gene coding DMT1 lead to microcytic anemia and hepatic iron overload, with unexpectedly low levels of plasma ferritin in the presence of iron stores.
Design and methods
We report a patient with a similar phenotype due to two mutations in the SLC11A2 gene, the known p.Gly212Val (G212V) mutation and a novel one, p.Asn491Ser (N491S). To assess the expression of DMT1 in human liver, we studied the expression of the four DMT1 mRNA isoforms by real-time quantitative PCR in control human liver samples. We also studied the effect of G212V and N491S DMT1 mutations on RNA splicing in blood leukocytes and cellular trafficking of dsRed2-tagged-DMT1 protein in the human hepatic cell line HuH7.
Results
Our results showed that i) only the isoforms 1B-IRE and 1B-nonIRE were significantly expressed in human liver; ii) the G212V mutation did not seem to affect mRNA splicing and the N491S mutation induced a splicing alteration leading to a truncated protein, which seemed quantitatively of low relevance; and iii) the N491S mutation, in contrast to the G212V mutation, led to abnormal protein trafficking.
Conclusions
Our data confirm the major role of DMT1 in the maintenance of iron homeostasis in humans and demonstrate that the N491S mutation, through its deleterious effect on protein trafficking, contributes together with the G212V mutation to the development of anemia and hepatic iron overload.

Abstract: A large number of mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA gene), encoding the lysosomal acid hydrolase glucocerebrosidase (GCase), lead to Gaucher disease (GD). The second most prevalent GD causing mutation, carried by 38% of non-Jewish patients, is L444P, resulting from a T to C transition in nucleotide 6092 of the GBA gene. It is a severe mutation that, in homozygosity, leads to neuropathic type 3 GD. We have previously shown that mutant GCase variants present variable degrees of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention and undergo ER associated degradation (ERAD). However, ERAD of the L444P mutant variant of GCase has never been tested. In the current study, we present results indicating that the L444P mutant protein undergoes extensive ERAD. In skin fibroblasts, originated from GD patients homozygous for L444P mutation, the level of GCase is 12%–21% of normal and at least 50% of it is in the ER. The mutant protein undergoes polyubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation. Recently Ambroxol, a known expectorant, was identified as a pharmacological chaperone for mutant GCase. We tested the effect of Ambroxol on the L444P mutant GCase and found that it enhances the removal of the mutant enzyme from the ER. In some cases, this removal leads to a concomitant increase in enzymatic activity.

Abstract: Molecules can be loaded into mammalian erythrocytes through a reversible lysis pore that forms in the membrane when placed in hypotonic media, the result being resealed red cell ghosts. Many studies on the sidedness of transport processes have utilized this approach. In addition, red cell ghosts encapsulated with enzymes have been used in patients to treat specific enzyme deficiencies, particularly when the substrate can cross the red cell membrane. Our long-term goal is to put fluorescent sensors inside erythrocytes, return the loaded red cell ghosts to the animal or patient, and then monitor the fluorescence non-invasively to follow changes in plasma analyte concentration. In this paper, we present a novel dialysis method for making the red cell ghosts. In addition, we present a theoretical analysis showing that it is not necessary that every loaded red cell ghost has the same dye concentration. Finally we discuss the constraints on the optimal affinity for the sensor/analyte interaction.

Nef does not inhibit F-actin remodelling and HIV-1 cell–cell transmission at the T lymphocyte virological synapse,

Abstract: Nef, a HIV-1 pathogenesis factor, elevates virus replication in vivo and thus progression to AIDS by incompletely defined mechanisms. As one of its biological properties, Nef enhances the infectivity of cell-free HIV-1 particles in single round infections, however it fails to provide a significant and amplifying growth advantage for HIV-1 on such virus producing cells. A major difference between HIV-1 cell-free single round infections and virus replication kinetics on T lymphocytes consists in the predominant role of cell-associated virus transmission rather than cell-free infection during multiple round virus replication. HIV-1 cell-to-cell transmission occurs across close cell contacts also referred to as virological synapse (VS) and involves polarization of the F-actin cytoskeleton, formation of F-actin rich membrane bridges as well as virus budding to cell–cell contacts. Since Nef potently interferes with triggered actin remodelling in several cell systems to reduce e.g. cell motility and signal transduction, we set out here to address whether Nef also affects organization and possibly function of the T lymphocyte VS. We find that in addition to increasing infectivity of cell-free virions, Nef can also moderately enhance single rounds of HIV-1 cell–cell transmission between Jurkat T lymphocytes. This occurs without affecting cell conjugation efficiencies or polarization of F-actin and HIV-1 p24Gag at the VS, identifying actin remodelling at the VS as an example of Nef-insensitive host cell actin rearrangements. However, Nef-mediated enhancement of single round cell-free infection or cell-to-cell transmission does not potentiate over multiple rounds of infection. These results suggest that Nef affects cell-free and cell-associated HIV-1 infection by the same mechanism acting on the intrinsic infectivity of HIV-1 particles. They further indicate that the high efficacy of cell-to-cell transmission can compensate such infectivity defects. Nef therefore selectively interferes with actin remodelling processes involved in antiviral host cell defense while actin driven processes that promote virus propagation remain unaltered.

Gaucher disease (GD) is characterized by clinical heterogeneity and is associated with metabolic abnormalities such as increased resting energy expenditure.
Objectives
To assess the basal metabolic rate (BMR) of patients with GD type I followed at the Gaucher Disease Reference Center of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.
Patients and Methods
Fourteen patients (male=6) and 14 healthy controls matched by gender, age and body mass index (BMI) were included in the study. The nutritional status of patients was assessed by BMI. The BMR was measured by indirect calorimetry. In two patients, it was possible to perform BMR in the pre- and the post-treatment periods.
Results
Mean age and BMI of patients and controls were, respectively, 32.8±17.6 and 32.1±16.6 years and 23.3±3.1 and 22.4±3.1 kg/m2. Twelve patients were receiving enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with imiglucerase (mean duration of treatment=5.2±4.3 years; mean dosage of imiglucerase=24.2±7.3 UI/kg/inf). Five patients (36%) were overweight, and nine (64%) were normal weight. Mean BMR of patients on ERT was 27.1% higher than that of controls (p=0.007). There was no difference between the BMR of patients on ERT and not on ERT (n=4) (p=0.92). Comparing the BMR of patients on ERT and their controls with the BMR estimated by the Harris-Benedict equation, the BMR of patients was 6.3% higher than the estimated (p = 0.1), while the BMR of their controls was 17.0% lower than the estimated (p = 0.001).
Conclusion
Most treated GD type I patients were normal weight. The patients including those on ERT showed higher BMR when compared to controls. Imiglucerase is probably unable to normalize the hypermetabolism presented by GD type I patients. Additional studies should be performed to confirm our findings.

Abstract: Despite its frequent inactivation in human breast cancers, the role of p21Cip1 (p21) in morphological plasticity of normal mammary epithelial cells is still poorly understood. To address this question, we have investigated the consequences of p21 silencing in two-dimensional (2D) morphogenesis of untransformed human mammary epithelial cells. Here we show that p21 inactivation causes a reduction of 2D cell spreading and suppresses focal adhesion. In order to investigate the cytoskeletal modifications associated with this altered morphology, we have analyzed the microtubule dynamics in interphase p21-depleted cells. Our results demonstrate that interphase microtubule dynamic instability is strongly increased by p21 silencing. This alteration correlates with severe microtubule hypoacetylation. Next, we show that these microtubule defects in p21-depleted cells can be reversed by the use of the small molecule tubacin, a specific inhibitor of the α-tubulin deacetylase HDAC6. Tubacin-induced microtubule dynamics decrease also correlates with a partial recovery of cell spreading and focal adhesion in those cells. Collectively, these data indicate that p21 regulates the morphological plasticity of normal mammary epithelial cells by modulating dynamics of key cytoskeletal components.

Abstract: Previously we reported the novel observation that astrocytes ensheath the persistent hyaloid artery, both in the Nuc1 spontaneous mutant rat, and in human PFV (persistent fetal vasculature) disease (Developmental Dynamics 234:36–47, 2005). We now show that astrocytes isolated from both the optic nerve and retina of Nuc1 rats migrate faster than wild type astrocytes. Aquaporin 4 (AQP4), the major water channel in astrocytes, has been shown to be important in astrocyte migration. We demonstrate that AQP4 expression is elevated in the astrocytes in PFV conditions, and we hypothesize that this causes the cells to migrate abnormally into the vitreous where they ensheath the hyaloid artery. This abnormal association of astrocytes with the hyaloid artery may impede the normal macrophage-mediated remodeling and regression of the hyaloid system.

Dynamic membrane remodeling at invadopodia differentiates invadopodia from podosomes,

Abstract: Invadopodia are specialized actin-rich protrusions of metastatic tumor and transformed cells with crucial functions in ECM degradation and invasion. Although early electron microscopy studies described invadopodia as long filament-like protrusions of the cell membrane adherent to the matrix, fluorescence microscopy studies have focused on invadopodia as actin–cortactin aggregates localized to areas of ECM degradation. The absence of a clear conceptual integration of these two descriptions of invadopodial structure has impeded understanding of the regulatory mechanisms that govern invadopodia. To determine the relationship between the membrane filaments identified by electron microscopy and the actin–cortactin aggregates of invadopodia, we applied rapid live-cell high-resolution TIRF microscopy to examine cell membrane dynamics at the cortactin core of the invadopodia of human carcinoma cells. We found that cortactin docking to the cell membrane adherent to 2D fibronectin matrix initiates invadopodium assembly associated with the formation of an invadopodial membrane process that extends from a ventral cell membrane lacuna toward the ECM. The tip of the invadopodial process flattens as it interacts with the 2D matrix, and it undergoes constant rapid ruffling and dynamic formation of filament-like protrusions as the invadopodium matures. To describe this newly discovered dynamic relationship between the actin–cortactin core and invadopodial membranes, we propose a model of the invadopodial complex. Using TIRF microscopy, we also established that – in striking contrast to the invadopodium – membrane at the podosome of a macrophage fails to form any process- or filament-like membrane protrusions. Thus, the undulation and ruffling of the invadopodial membrane together with the formation of dynamic filament-like extensions from the invadopodial cortactin core defines invadopodia as invasive superstructures that are distinct from the podosomes.

Abstract: Background
An increased risk has been reported in Gaucher disease genotype N370S/N370S for multiple myeloma, hematologic and other malignancies, as well as skeletal involvement. The purpose of this study is to ascertain whether VDR genotype which is involved in the risk for many cancers including multiple myeloma is also correlated with cancers in patients with Gaucher disease.
Methods
VDR polymorphisms (ApaI, TaqI, BsmI, FokI) were analyzed by standard methods from 29 Gaucher patients (some on enzyme therapy) with various cancers and from 70 healthy Ashkenazi Jews. Associations between VDR and categorical variables were analyzed by chi-square and Fisher's exact tests; associations with quantitative variables used ANOVA and Scheffe post-hoc tests. Non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA was used when one category was small. IRB Committee approval was received for this study.
Findings
There was a trend for statistical significance (p=0.04) between patients and controls for the ApaI aa genotype. There were no correlations between VDR polymorphic genotypes and disease severity, need for ERT, splenectomy, or bone disease except a trend associating TaqI TT genotype with Zimran's severity score (p=0.06).
Conclusion
This survey highlights the possibility that Gaucher disease in itself may not be the only important risk factor for cancers (other than multiple myeloma) and that other modifiers may affect cancer morbidity in Gaucher disease.

Abstract: We collected as much information as possible on new lamin genes and their flanking genes. The number of lamin genes varies from 1 to 4 depending more or less on the phylogenetic position of the species. Strong genome drift is recognised by fewer and unusually placed introns and a change in flanking genes. This applies to the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the insect Drosophila melanogaster, the urochordate Ciona intestinalis, the annelid Capitella teleta and the planaria Schmidtea mediterranea. In contrast stable genomes show astonishing conservation of the flanking genes. These are identical in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis and the cephalochordate Branchiostoma floridae lamin B1 gene. Even in the lamin B1 genes from Xenopus tropicalis and man one of the flanking genes is conserved. Finally our analysis forms the basis for a molecular analysis of metazoan phylogeny.

Abstract: While Hispanics are the largest and most rapidly growing minority population in the United States, they are underrepresented in pharmacogenomic studies with warfarin. We sought to determine the combination of clinical and genetic influences of warfarin dose requirements in Hispanics. In addition, we tested the performance of published warfarin dosing algorithms derived from largely non-Hispanic cohorts in an inner-city U.S. Hispanic population. Genetic samples and clinical data were obtained from 50 Hispanics on a stable dose of warfarin. The contribution of cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) and vitamin K epoxide reductase complex-1 (VKORC1) genotypes and clinical factors to warfarin dose requirements was determined. The correlation between the predicted dose using published algorithms and therapeutic dose was also assessed. Compared to the VKORC1-1639 GG genotype, warfarin dose requirements were 30% and 62% lower with the GA and AA genotypes, respectively (p=0.001). The combination of the VKORC1-1639G>A and CYP2C9 genotypes and clinical factors explained 56% of the inter-patient variability in warfarin dose. Warfarin dose predicted using algorithms derived from mostly non-Hispanic cohorts was significantly correlated with the therapeutic dose in our Hispanic cohort (r2=0.43 to 0.49; p<0.001); the predicted dose was within 1.0 mg/day of the therapeutic dose for 40% to 50% of patients. Our data suggest that factors influencing warfarin dose requirements in Hispanic Caucasians are similar to those previously described in European Caucasians and that dosing algorithms derived from non-Hispanic Caucasian cohorts are applicable to Hispanics living in the U.S.

Abstract: Objective
The induction of fetal hemoglobin during definitive erythropoiesis is a major therapeutic goal in β-globin gene disorders. Butyrate induces fetal hemoglobin, and p38 phosphorylation has been implicated in this process. We studied p38 and the effect of its inhibitors in a physiologic primary cell model of fetal/embryonic globin gene induction during definitive erythropoiesis.
Methods
p38 phosphorylation was evaluated in a short-term culture of definitive erythroid precursor (EryD) cells following butyrate induction, absent prolonged exposure to cytokines. The impact of p38 inhibitors on embryonic/fetal globin gene induction by butyrate and on normal erythroid processes, including proliferation, differentiation, cell cycle occupancy, and RNA transcription, was also examined.
Results
p38 phosphorylation, maximal at harvest of murine fetal liver-derived EryD (FL EryD), when minimal embryonic/fetal globin gene expression is seen, is suppressed by EPO (as reported by others). Butyrate initially delays EPO-mediated suppression of p38 phosphorylation, but p38 phosphorylation thereafter, at 30minutes to 48hours, is equivalent and at low levels in EPO-treated FL EryD, with or without butyrate. Inhibitors of p38, at 10–50μM, prevent butyrate-mediated induction of embryonic/fetal globin gene expression. We found that p38 inhibitors, which also disrupt non-p38 signaling pathways, perturb cell division, erythroid differentiation, transit through the cell cycle, and RNA transcription in primary EryD.
Conclusion
p38 inhibitors interrupt normal erythropoiesis and the capacity for embryonic/fetal globin gene induction. However, p38 signaling is maximal in primary EryD at harvest, when embryonic globin genes are minimally expressed, and diminishes thereafter. We conclude that p38 inhibitors disrupt cellular pathways that are essential to butyrate-induced embryonic/fetal globin gene expression. However, levels of p38 phosphorylation are not coordinate with embryonic/fetal globin gene expression in EryD, and increased signaling through p38 may not be the sine qua non for embryonic/fetal globin gene induction.

Abstract: The ability of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) to induce epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is mediated by SMAD-dependent and SMAD-independent pathways such as the activation of Rho GTPase signalling. Upon activation, GTP-bound Rho stimulates the ROCK kinases, which in turn phosphorylate numerous substrates including the LIM kinases (LIMK). The net result of ROCK activation is increased actin–myosin contractile force generation, with a contribution from LIMK-induced actin filament stabilisation. In this study, we made use of siRNA-mediated knockdown and selective inhibitors to determine the contributions of ROCK and LIMK to TGFβ-induced responses. We find that both ROCK and LIMK are required for TGFβ stimulation of serum-response factor (SRF) transcriptional activity and actin stress fibre formation during EMT. In contrast, although LIMK inhibition had little effect on cell motility in scratch wound and Transwell migration assays, ROCK inhibition actually promoted TGFβ-induced cell motility by helping individual cells to break free from the epithelial sheet. Furthermore, we demonstrate that selective inhibition of LIMK, but not ROCK, effectively blocked TGFβ driven invasion through a layer of matrigel extracellular matrix protein. These results indicate that the roles of LIMK and ROCK in the Rho signalling pathway downstream of TGFβ are not identical and suggest that LIMK represents an attractive therapeutic target in TGFβ driven organ fibrosis and metastatic cancer spread.

Abstract: Coordinated functions of the actin cytoskeleton and microtubules, which need to be carefully controlled in time and space, are required for the drastic alterations of neuronal morphology during neuromorphogenesis and neuronal network formation. A key process in neuronal actin dynamics is filament formation by actin nucleators, such as the Arp2/3 complex, formins and the brain-enriched, novel WH2 domain-based nucleators Spire and cordon-bleu (Cobl). We here discuss in detail the currently available data on the roles of these actin nucleators during neuromorphogenesis and highlight how their required control at the plasma membrane may be brought about. The Arp2/3 complex was found to be especially important for proper growth cone translocation and axon development. The underlying molecular mechanisms for Arp2/3 complex activation at the neuronal plasma membrane include a recruitment and an activation of N-WASP by lipid- and F-actin-binding adaptor proteins, Cdc42 and phosphatidyl-inositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2). Together, these components upstream of N-WASP and the Arp2/3 complex ensure fine-control of N-WASP-mediated Arp2/3 complex activation and control distinct functions during axon development. They are counteracted by Arp2/3 complex inhibitors, such as PICK, which likewise play an important role in neuromorphogenesis. In contrast to the crucial role of the Arp2/3 complex in proper axon development, dendrite formation and dendritic arborization was revealed to critically involve the newly identified actin nucleator Cobl. Cobl is a brain-enriched protein and uses three Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein homology 2 (WH2) domains for actin binding and for promoting the formation of non-bundled, unbranched filaments. Thus, cells use different actin nucleators to steer the complex remodeling processes underlying cell morphogenesis, the formation of cellular networks and the development of complex body plans.

Abstract: The aim of this study is to update the incidence and the distribution of the globin gene defects causing β-thalassemia and abnormal hemoglobins in Sicily. The data derived from a total of 8875 beta-thalassemia alleles and 1330 variant hemoglobin chromosomes studied in Sicily from 1990 during a hemoglobinopathy control program. Fifty-four beta-globin gene defects were characterized, involving 30 different beta-thalassemia mutations and 24 variant hemoglobins. Eight of 30 β-thalassemia defects accounted for 95.11% of examined alleles while other beta-globin gene defects were found at lower frequencies (<1%). A consistent number (24) of variant hemoglobins were identified of whom Hb S was the most represented (72.1%). Our data underline the heterogeneity of the beta-globin gene defects in the Sicily. The enormous progress in the technique for β-globin gene analysis permitted to characterize 99.93% of mutated alleles and it has made a first trimester prenatal diagnosis program possible in our region in all cases with a great improvement in thalassemia management. The origin of the large spectrum of mutations is discussed taking in consideration the history of the island.

Abstract: c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs, also called stress activated protein kinases) and the extra-cellular signal responsive kinases (ERKs) exert different functions in mitogenesis, maturation and differentiation of immune and epithelial cells. We investigated specific functions of individual JNK and ERK isoforms in skin permeability barrier repair and in wound healing. JNK1, but not JNK2 or JNK3, deficient mice revealed a delay in the permeability barrier repair after superficial injury to the skin (tape-stripping) as well as a delay in the healing of full skin thickness wounds. Skin barrier injury induced an increase in epidermal JNK1 enzyme activity in mouse skin in vivo, and JNK1 activity correlated with the degree of differentiation in organotypic keratinocyte cultures. Skin injury activated epidermal ERK2 enzyme activity with biphasic maxima after 30min and 3h, and the activity was independent from the differentiation state in keratinocyte culture. In summary, superficial and deep wound healing depends on the differential activity of MAP kinases such as JNK1 in epidermal differentiation and ERK2 in proliferation.
