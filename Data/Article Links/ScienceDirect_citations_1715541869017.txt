Abstract: Intestinal acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) is important in the cellular and physiological responses to dietary fat. To determine the effect of increased intestinal DGAT2 on cellular and physiological responses to acute and chronic dietary fat challenges, we generated mice with intestine-specific overexpression of DGAT2 and compared them with intestine-specific overexpression of DGAT1 and wild-type (WT) mice. We found that when intestinal DGAT2 is present in excess, triacylglycerol (TG) secretion from enterocytes is enhanced compared to WT mice; however, TG storage within enterocytes is similar compared to WT mice. We found that when intestinal DGAT2 is present in excess, mRNA levels of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation were reduced. This result suggests that reduced fatty acid oxidation may contribute to increased TG secretion by overexpression of DGAT2 in intestine. Furthermore, this enhanced supply of TG for secretion in Dgat2Int mice may be a significant contributing factor to the elevated fasting plasma TG and exacerbated hepatic TG storage in response to a chronic HFD. These results highlight that altering fatty acid and TG metabolism within enterocytes has the capacity to alter systemic delivery of dietary fat and may serve as an effective target for preventing and treating metabolic diseases such as hepatic steatosis.

The human liver fatty acid binding protein (FABP1) gene is activated by FOXA1 and PPARα; and repressed by C/EBPα: Implications in FABP1 down-regulation in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,

Abstract: Liver fatty acid binding protein (FABP1) prevents lipotoxicity of free fatty acids and regulates fatty acid trafficking and partition. Our objective is to investigate the transcription factors controlling the human FABP1 gene and their regulation in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Adenovirus-mediated expression of multiple transcription factors in HepG2 cells and cultured human hepatocytes demonstrated that FOXA1 and PPARα are among the most effective activators of human FABP1, whereas C/EBPα is a major dominant repressor. Moreover, FOXA1 and PPARα induced re-distribution of FABP1 protein and increased cytoplasmic expression. Reporter assays demonstrated that the major basal activity of the human FABP1 promoter locates between −96 and −229bp, where C/EBPα binds to a composite DR1-C/EBP element. Mutation of this element at −123bp diminished basal reporter activity, abolished repression by C/EBPα and reduced transactivation by HNF4α. Moreover, HNF4α gene silencing by shRNA in HepG2 cells caused a significant down-regulation of FABP1 mRNA expression. FOXA1 activated the FABP1 promoter through binding to a cluster of elements between −229 and −592bp, whereas PPARα operated through a conserved proximal element at −59bp. Finally, FABP1, FOXA1 and PPARα were concomitantly repressed in animal models of NAFLD and in human nonalcoholic fatty livers, whereas C/EBPα was induced or did not change. We conclude that human FABP1 has a complex mechanism of regulation where C/EBPα displaces HNF4α and hampers activation by FOXA1 and PPARα. Alteration of expression of these transcription factors in NAFLD leads to FABP1 gen repression and could exacerbate lipotoxicity and disease progression.

Abstract: During postnatal development of mice distinct white adipose tissue depots display a transient appearance of brown-like adipocytes. These brite (brown in white) adipocytes share characteristics with classical brown adipocytes including a multilocular appearance and the expression of the thermogenic protein uncoupling protein 1. In this study, we compared two inbred mouse strains 129S6sv/ev and C57BL6/N known for their different propensity to diet-induced obesity. We observed transient browning in retroperitoneal and inguinal adipose tissue depots of these two strains. From postnatal day 10 to 20 the increase in the abundance of multilocular adipocytes and uncoupling protein 1 expression was higher in 129S6sv/ev than in C57BL6/N pups. The parallel increase in the mass of the two fat depots was attenuated during this browning period. Conversely, epididymal white and interscapular brown adipose tissue displayed a steady increase in mass during the first 30days of life. In this period, 129S6sv/ev mice developed a significantly higher total body fat mass than C57BL6/N. Thus, while on a local depot level a high number of brite cells is associated with the attenuation of adipose tissue expansion the strain comparison reveals no support for a systemic impact on energy balance.

Abstract: The lipid A component of lipopolysaccharide from the nitrogen-fixing plant endosymbiont, Rhizobium etli, is structurally very different from that found in most enteric bacteria. The lipid A from free-living R. etli is structurally heterogeneous and exists as a mixture of species which are either pentaacylated or tetraacylated. In contrast, the lipid A from R. etli bacteroids is reported to consist exclusively of tetraacylated lipid A species. The tetraacylated lipid A species in both cases lack a β-hydroxymyristoyl chain at the 3-position of lipid A. Here, we show that the lipid A modification enzyme responsible for 3-O deacylation in R. etli is a homolog of the PagL protein originally described in Salmonella enterica sv. typhimurium. In contrast to the PagL proteins described from other species, R. etli PagL displays a calcium dependency. To determine the importance of the lipid A modification catalyzed by PagL, we isolated and characterized a R. etli mutant deficient in the pagL gene. Mass spectrometric analysis confirmed that the mutant strain was exclusively tetraacylated and radiochemical analysis revealed that 3-O deacylase activity was absent in membranes prepared from the mutant. The R. etli mutant was not impaired in its ability to form nitrogen-fixing nodules on Phaseolus vulgaris but it displayed slower nodulation kinetics relative to the wild-type strain. The lipid A modification catalyzed by R. etli PagL, therefore, is not required for nodulation but may play other roles such as protecting bacterial endosymbionts from plant immune responses during infection.

Abstract: Apolipoprotein-derived peptides have emerged as a promising candidate for the treatment of various inflammatory disease conditions. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to explain the beneficiary effects of these peptides and prominent among them being high-affinity binding of peptides to pro-inflammatory lipids and facilitating their sequestration/metabolism/clearance in the body. Pro-inflammatory lipids differ considerably in their molecular structures, chemical compositions and physicochemical properties. Importance of the properties of the pro-inflammatory lipids in their ability to bind to apolipoprotein-derived peptides is not studied in details. In this study, we have characterized the interaction of synthetic peptides derived from human apolipoprotein E with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA), two potent bacterial pro-inflammatory lipids that differ considerably in their molecular structures and chemical compositions. Binding of the peptides to LPS and LTA was monitored by CD spectroscopy. Effect of the peptides on the biological activity of lipids was studied by monitoring the inhibition of LPS- or LTA-induced up-regulation of the inflammatory markers in the human blood cells. Physicochemical properties of lipid aggregates were determined by fluorescence spectroscopy and native PAGE. Our results show that physicochemical properties of LPS and LTA differ considerably and influence their interaction with apolipoprotein-derived peptides.

Abstract: In this study, the MIG1 gene in the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica ACA-DC 50109 (the parent yeast) was disrupted and the disruptant M25 obtained could grow in yeast nitrogen base-N5000 medium without uracil or the medium with 2-deoxy-D-glucose. It was found that the cells of the disruptant M25 had more lipid bodies than those of its parent yeast. The disruptant M25 contained 48.7% (w/w) of oil based on its cell weight while the parent yeast only contained 36.0% (w/w) of oil. Transcript levels of many genes relevant to lipid biosynthesis in the disruptant M25 were enhanced compared to those of the same genes in the parent yeast. However, transcript level of the MFE1 gene, one of the genes relevant to fatty acid degradation was reduced in the disruptant M25 compared to that of the same gene in the parent yeast. Such changes in gene expression profile may cause the increased lipid biosynthesis in the disruptant M25. Biosynthesis of C18:1 fatty acid in the disruptant M25 was greatly enhanced compared to that in the parent yeast.

Abstract: Two phosphorus-containing glycolipids have previously been observed in Clostridium acetobutylicum. We had shown that the concentration of one of them increases in response to increased unsaturation of the membrane lipid hydrocarbon chains, suggesting a potential role in the regulation of lipid polymorphism in this organism. Mass spectrometry shows that these glycolipids are ethanolamine phosphate (Etn-P)-containing derivatives of a mono- and di-glycosyldiradylglycerol. The content of both diglycosyldiradylglycerol and the Etn-P-monoglycosyldiradylglycerol, which increases upon increased unsaturation of the membrane, also increases upon addition of octanol to the medium. Thus, it appears that the Etn-P-monoglycosyldiradylglycerol along with the diglycosyldiradylglycerol may serve to stabilize the membrane bilayer during membrane stress caused by the presence of the solvents produced during fermentation.

Abstract: Because of the possible role of brown adipose tissue and UCP1 in metabolic regulation, even in adult humans, there is presently considerable interest in quantifying, from in-vitro data, the thermogenic capacities of brown and brite/beige adipose tissues. An important issue is therefore to establish which parameters are the most adequate for this. A particularly important issue is the relevance of UCP1 mRNA levels as estimates of the degree of recruitment and of the thermogenic capacity resulting from differences in physiological conditions and from experimental manipulations. By solely following UCP1 mRNA levels in brown adipose tissue, the conclusion would be made that the tissue's highest activation occurs after only 6h in the cold and then successively decreases to being only some 50% elevated after 1month in the cold. However, measurement of total UCP1 protein levels per depot ("mouse") reveals that the maximal thermogenic capacity estimated in this way is reached first after 1month but represents an approx. 10-fold increase in thermogenic capacity. Since this in-vitro measure correlates quantitatively and temporally with the acquisition of nonshivering thermogenesis, this must be considered the most physiologically relevant parameter. Similarly, observations that cold acclimation barely increases UCP1 mRNA levels in classical brown adipose tissue but leads to a 200-fold increase in UCP1 mRNA levels in brite/beige adipose tissue depots may overemphasise the physiological significance of these depots, as the high fold-increases are due to very low initial levels, and the UCP1 mRNA levels reached are at least an order of magnitude lower than in brown adipose tissue; furthermore, based on total UCP1 protein amounts, the brite/beige depots attain only about 10% of the thermogenic capacity of the classical brown adipose tissue depots. Consequently, inadequate conclusions may be reached if UCP1 mRNA levels are used as a proxy for the metabolic significance of recruited versus non-recruited brown adipose tissue and for estimating the metabolic significance of brown versus brite/beige adipose tissues. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Brown and White Fat: From Signaling to Disease.

Abstract: Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) is an HDL-associated enzyme and exhibits anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, and anti-atherogenic properties. Association of PON1 to HDL particles increases the stability and activity of PON1 and is important for the normal functioning of the enzyme. HDL particles are made up of lipid and protein constituents and apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) is a principal protein constituent of HDL that facilitates various biological activities of HDL. In many disease conditions the oxidized phospholipid (Ox-PL) content of HDL is found to be increased and an inverse correlation between the activity of PON1 and oxidation of the HDL is observed. However, the molecular details of the inhibitory action of the Ox-PL-containing HDL on the function of PON1 are not clear yet. In this study we have assembled reconstituted HDL (rHDL) particles with and without Ox-PL and compared their effect on the structure and function of 13C-labeled recombinant PON1 (13C-rPON1) by employing attenuated total reflectance Fourier transformed infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and enzymatic assay. Our results show that the presence of the Ox-PL in the rHDL particles alters the structure of rPON1 and decreases its lactonase activity.

Abstract: Sphingobacterium spiritivorum has five unusual sphingophospholipids (SPLs). Our previous study determined the complete chemical structures of these SPLs. The compositions of the long-chain bases/fatty acids in the ceramide portion, isoheptadecasphingosine/isopentadecanoate or isoheptadecasphingosine/2-hydroxy isopentadecanoate, are characteristic. The immune response against bacterial lipid components is considered to play important roles in microbial infections. It is reported that several bacterial sphingolipids composed of ceramide are recognized by CD1-restricted T and NKT cells and that a non-peptide antigen is recognized by γδ T cells. In this study, we demonstrated that these bacterial SPLs activated murine bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) via Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 but not TLR2, although they slightly activated CD1d-restricted NKT and γδT cells. Interestingly, this TLR 4-recognition pathway of bacterial SPLs involves the fatty acid composition of ceramide in addition to the sugar moiety. A non-hydroxy fatty acid composed of ceramide was necessary to activate murine BMMs. The bacterial survival was significantly higher in TLR4-KO mice than in TLR2-KO and wild-type mice. The results indicate that activation of the TLR4-dependent pathway of BMMs by SPLs induced an innate immune response and contributed to bacterial clearance.

Abstract: Sphingosine kinases 1 and 2 (SK1 and SK2) generate the bioactive lipid mediator sphingosine 1-phosphate and as such play a significant role in cell fate and in human health and disease. Despite significant interest in and examination of the role played by SK enzymes in disease, comparatively little is currently known about the three-dimensional structure and catalytic mechanisms of these enzymes. To date, limited numbers of studies have used site directed mutagenesis and activity determinations to examine the roles of individual SK residues in substrate, calmodulin, and membrane binding, as well as activation via phosphorylation. Assays are currently available that allow for both single and bisubstrate kinetic analysis of mutant proteins that show normal, lowered and enhanced activity as compared to wild type controls. Additional studies will be required to build on this foundation to completely understand SK mediated substrate binding and phosphoryl group transfer. A deeper understanding of the SK catalytic mechanism, as well as SK interactions with potential small molecule inhibitors will be invaluable to the future design and identification of SK activity modulators as research tools and potential therapeutics. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Advances in Lysophospholipid Research.

Abstract: Sphingoid base-1-phosphates represent a very low portion of the sphingolipid pool but are potent bioactive lipids in mammals. This study was undertaken to determine whether these lipids are produced in palmitate-treated pancreatic β cells and what role they play in palmitate-induced β cell apoptosis. Our lipidomic analysis revealed that palmitate at low and high glucose supplementation increased (dihydro)sphingosine-1-phosphate levels in INS-1 β cells. This increase was associated with an increase in sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) mRNA and protein levels. Over-expression of SphK1 in INS-1 cells potentiated palmitate-induced accumulation of dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate. N,N-dimethyl-sphingosine, a potent inhibitor of SphK, potentiated β-cell apoptosis induced by palmitate whereas over-expression of SphK1 significantly reduced apoptosis induced by palmitate with high glucose. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-targeted SphK1 also partially inhibited apoptosis induced by palmitate. Inhibition of INS-1 apoptosis by over-expressed SphK1 was independent of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors but was associated with a decreased formation of pro-apoptotic ceramides induced by gluco-lipotoxicity. Moreover, over-expression of SphK1 counteracted the defect in the ER-to-Golgi transport of proteins that contribute to the ceramide-dependent ER stress observed during gluco-lipotoxicity. In conclusion, our results suggest that activation of palmitate-induced SphK1-mediated sphingoid base-1-phosphate formation in the ER of β cells plays a protective role against palmitate-induced ceramide-dependent apoptotic β cell death.

Cellular senescence involves an intracrine prostaglandin E2 pathway in human fibroblasts,

Abstract: Cyclooxygenase 2 and release of prostaglandin E2 are involved in many responses including inflammation and are upregulated during cellular senescence. However, little is known about the role of lipid inflammatory mediators in senescence. Here, we investigated the mechanism by which the COX-2/PGE2 axis induces senescence. Using the NS398 specific inhibitor of COX-2, we provide evidence that reactive oxygen species by-produced by the COX-2 enzymatic activity are negligible in front of the total senescence-associated oxidative stress. We therefore investigated the role of PGE2 by invalidating the PGE2 synthases downstream of COX-2, or the specific PGE2 receptors, or by applying PGE2 or specific agonists or antagonists. We evaluated the effect on senescence by evaluating the senescence-associated proliferation arrest, the percentage of senescence-associated β-galactosidase-positive cells, and the expression of senescent molecular markers such as IL-6 and MCP1. We show that PGE2 acting on its EP specific receptors is able to induce both the onset of senescence and the maintenance of the phenotype. It did so only when the PGE2/lactate transporter activity was enhanced, indicating that PGE2 acts on senescence more via the pool of intracellular EP receptors than via those localized at the cell surface. Treatment with agonists, antagonists and silencing of the EP receptors by siRNA revealed that EP3 was the most involved in transducing the intracrine effects of PGE2. Immunofluorescence experiments confirmed that EP3 was more localized in the cytoplasm than at the cell surface. Taken together, these results suggest that COX-2 contributes to the establishment and maintenance of senescence of normal human fibroblasts via an independent-ROS and a dependent-PGE2/EPs intracrine pathway.

Chronic pharmacological activation of P2Y13 receptor in mice decreases HDL-cholesterol level by increasing hepatic HDL uptake and bile acid secretion,

Abstract: High level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-cholesterol) is inversely correlated to the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The protective effect of HDL is mostly attributed to their metabolic functions in reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), a process whereby excess cell cholesterol is taken up from peripheral cells and processed in HDL particles, and is later delivered to the liver for further metabolism and bile excretion. We have previously demonstrated that P2Y13 receptor is critical for RCT and that intravenous bolus injection of cangrelor (AR-C69931MX), a partial agonist of P2Y13 receptor, can stimulate hepatic HDL uptake and subsequent lipid biliary secretion without any change in plasma lipid levels. In the present study, we investigated the effect of longer-term treatment with cangrelor on lipoprotein metabolism in mice. We observed that continuous delivery of cangrelor at a rate of 35μg/day/kg body weight for 3days markedly decreased plasma HDL-cholesterol level, by increasing the clearance of HDL particles by the liver. These effects were correlated to an increase in the rate of biliary bile acid secretion. An increased expression of SREBP-regulated genes of cholesterol metabolism was also observed without any change of hepatic lipid levels as compared to non-treated mice. Thus, 3-day cangrelor treatment markedly increases the flux of HDL-cholesterol from the plasma to the liver for bile acid secretion. Taken together our results suggest that P2Y13 appears a promising target for therapeutic intervention aimed at preventing or reducing cardiovascular risk.

The transport of DDT from chylomicrons to adipocytes does not mimic triacylglycerol transport,

Abstract: Despite being banned in the U.S., organochlorine toxins such as DDT are frequently detected in human adipose tissue. The main route of exposure is through the consumption of contaminated foods and subsequent intestinal packaging of DDT into chylomicrons. These chylomicrons, which also contain dietary triacylglycerol (TG), are delivered directly to peripheral tissues without first being metabolized by the liver. The physiological process by which these compounds are delivered from chylomicrons to adipose is not well understood, but is clinically relevant since it bypasses first-pass metabolism. Based on its highly lipophilic nature, it has been assumed that DDT is transferred to peripheral tissues similar to TG; however, this has not been measured. Here, we use the lymph fistula rat to isolate chylomicrons containing both DDT and TG. These chylomicrons are the in vivo DDT delivery vehicle. Using 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we investigated the rate at which DDT transfers from chylomicrons to adipocytes, and mediators of this process. This novel approach closely approximates the in vivo DDT exposure route. We show that: 1) DDT repartitions from chylomicrons to adipocytes, 2) this transport does not require hydrolysis of TG within the chylomicron, and is stimulated by the inhibition of LPL, 3) albumin does not inhibit DDT uptake, 4) DDT dissolved in DMSO does not appropriately mimic in vivo DDT transport; and most importantly, 5) DDT uptake from chylomicrons does not mimic the uptake of TG from the same particles. Understanding these factors is important for designing interventions for human populations exposed to DDT.

Abstract: Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is an important bioactive sphingolipid metabolite that has been implicated in numerous physiological and cellular processes. Not only does S1P play a structural role in cells by defining the components of the plasma membrane, but in the last 20years it has been implicated in various significant cell signaling pathways and physiological processes: for example, cell migration, survival and proliferation, cellular architecture, cell–cell contacts and adhesions, vascular development, atherosclerosis, acute pulmonary injury and respiratory distress, inflammation and immunity, and tumorogenesis and metastasis [[1], [2]]. Given the wide variety of cellular and physiological processes in which S1P is involved, it is immediately obvious why the mechanisms governing S1P synthesis and degradation, and the manner in which these processes are regulated, are necessary to understand. In gaining more knowledge about regulation of the sphingosine kinase (SK)/S1P pathway, many potential therapeutic targets may be revealed. This review explores the roles of the SK/S1P pathway in disease, summarizes available SK enzyme inhibitors and examines their potential as therapeutic agents. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Advances in Lysophospholipid Research.

Abstract: Prostaglandin H synthases (PGHSs) have been identified in the majority of vertebrate and invertebrate animals, and most recently in the red alga Gracilaria vermiculophylla. Here we report on the cloning, expression and characterization of the algal PGHS, which shares only about 20% of the amino acid sequence identity with its animal counterparts, yet catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandin-endoperoxides, PGG2 and PGH2. The algal PGHS lacks structural elements identified in all known animal PGHSs, such as epidermal growth factor-like domain and helix B in the membrane binding domain. The key residues of animal PGHS, like catalytic Tyr-385 and heme liganding His-388 are conserved in the algal enzyme. However, the amino acid residues shown to be important for substrate binding and coordination, and the target residues for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (Arg-120, Tyr-355, and Ser-530) are not found at the appropriate positions in the algal sequences. Differently from animal PGHSs the G. vermiculophylla PGHS easily expresses in Escherichia coli as a fully functional enzyme. The recombinant protein was identified as an oligomeric (evidently tetrameric) ferric heme protein. The preferred substrate for the algal PGHS is arachidonic acid with cyclooxygenase reaction rate remarkably higher than values reported for mammalian PGHS isoforms. Similarly to animal PGHS-2, the algal enzyme is capable of metabolizing ester and amide derivatives of arachidonic acid to corresponding prostaglandin products. Algal PGHS is not inhibited by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. A single copy of intron-free gene encoding for PGHS was identified in the red algae G. vermiculophylla and Coccotylus truncatus genomes.

Abstract: A number of studies have been carried out to examine the biological function of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and its potential health benefits. However, not much is known about how CLA isomers mediate their effect on angiogenesis and vascularization during early placentation. In this paper we demonstrate that cis-9,trans-11(c9,t11)-CLA stimulated the expression of angiopoietin like-4 (ANGPTL4) mRNA and protein accompanied by tube formation in first trimester placental trophoblast cells, HTR8/SVneo whereas the other CLA isomer, trans-10,cis-12 (t10,c12)-CLA had no such effects. c9,t11-CLA however did not stimulate expression of the most potent angiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in these cells. Silencing ANGPTL4 in these cells significantly reduced the stimulatory effect of c9,t11-CLA on tube formation, indicating the involvement of ANGPTL4. In addition, c9,t11-CLA increased the mRNA expression of several pro-angiogenic factors such as fatty acid binding protein-4 (FABP4), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP) in HTR8/SVneo cells. c9,t11-CLA also induced the uptake of docosahexaenoic acid, 22:6n−3 (DHA), a stimulator of tube formation in these cells. Triacsin C, an acylCoA synthetase inhibitor, attenuated c9,t11-CLA induced DHA uptake, tube formation and cellular proliferation in HTR8/SVneo cells. Our data suggest that the c9,t11-CLA isomer may regulate angiogenic processes during early placentation via increased expression of ANGPTL4 and other pro-angiogenic factors such as FABP4, COX-2 and ADRP with concomitant increase in the uptake of DHA in these cells.

Abstract: ATP-binding cassette protein A1 (ABCA1) plays a key role in generating high-density lipoprotein (HDL). However, the detailed mechanism of HDL formation remains unclear; in order to reveal it, chemicals that specifically block each step of HDL formation would be useful. Cyclosporine A inhibits ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux, but it is not clear whether this is mediated via inhibition of calcineurin. We analyzed the effects of cyclosporine A and related compounds on ABCA1 function in BHK/ABCA1 cells. Cyclosporine A, FK506, and pimecrolimus inhibited ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux in a concentration-dependent manner, with IC50 of 7.6, 13.6, and 7.0μM, respectively. An mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin also inhibited ABCA1, with IC50 of 18.8μM. The primary targets for these drugs were inhibited at much lower concentrations in BHK/ABCA1 cells, suggesting that they were not involved. Binding of [3H] cyclosporine A to purified ABCA1 could be clearly detected. Furthermore, a non-immunosuppressive cyclosporine, PSC833, inhibited ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux with IC50 of 1.9μM, and efficiently competed with [3H] cyclosporine A binding to ABCA1. These results indicate that cyclosporine A and PSC833 inhibit ABCA1 via direct binding, and that the ABCA1 inhibitor PSC833 is an excellent candidate for further investigations of the detailed mechanisms underlying formation of HDL.

Abstract: Zygomycetes are well known for their ability to produce various secondary metabolites. Fungi of the genus Mortierella can accumulate highly unsaturated lipids in large amounts as lipid droplets. However, no information about the spatial distribution or homogeneity of the oil inside the fungi is obtainable to date due to the invasive and destructive analytical techniques applied so far. Raman spectroscopy has been demonstrated to be well suited to investigate biological samples on a micrometre scale. It also has been shown that the degree of unsaturation of lipids can be determined from Raman spectra. We applied micro-Raman spectroscopy to investigate the spatial distribution and composition of lipid vesicles inside intact hyphae. For Mortierella alpina and Mortierella elongata distinct differences in the degree of unsaturation and even the impact of growth conditions are determined from the Raman spectra. In both species we found that the fatty acid saturation in the vesicles is highly variable in the first 600μm of the growing hyphal tip and fluctuates towards a constant composition and saturation ratio in all of the remaining mycelium. Our approach facilitates in vivo monitoring of the lipid production and allows us to investigate the impact of cultivation parameters on the oil composition directly in the growing hyphae without the need for extensive extraction procedures.

Abstract: Activation of sphingosine kinase/sphingosine 1-phosphate (SK/S1P)‐mediated signaling has emerged as a critical cardioprotective pathway in response to acute ischemia/reperfusion injury. S1P is released in both ischemic pre- and post-conditioning. Application of exogenous S1P to cultured cardiac myocytes subjected to hypoxia or treatment of isolated hearts either before ischemia or at the onset of reperfusion exerts prosurvival effects. Synthetic congeners of S1P such as FTY720 mimic these responses. Gene targeted mice null for the SK1 isoform whose hearts are subjected to ischemia/reperfusion injury exhibit increased infarct size and respond poorly either to ischemic pre- or postconditioning. Measurements of cardiac SK activity and S1P parallel these observations. Experiments in SK2 knockout mice have revealed that this isoform is necessary for survival in the heart. High density lipoprotein (HDL) is a major carrier of S1P, and studies of hearts in which selected S1P receptors have been inhibited implicate the S1P cargo of HDL in cardioprotection. Inhibition of S1P lyase, an endogenous enzyme that degrades S1P, also leads to cardioprotection. These observations have considerable relevance for future therapeutic approaches to acute and chronic myocardial injury. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Advances in Lysophospholipid Research.

Abstract: Disruption of cholesterol homeostasis in the central nervous system (CNS) has been associated with neurological, neurodegenerative, and neurodevelopmental disorders. The CNS is a closed system with regard to cholesterol homeostasis, as cholesterol-delivering lipoproteins from the periphery cannot pass the blood–brain-barrier and enter the brain. Different cell types in the brain have different functions in the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis, with astrocytes producing and releasing apolipoprotein E and lipoproteins, and neurons metabolizing cholesterol to 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol. We present evidence that astrocytes and neurons adopt different mechanisms also in regulating cholesterol efflux. We found that in astrocytes cholesterol efflux is induced by both lipid-free apolipoproteins and lipoproteins, while cholesterol removal from neurons is triggered only by lipoproteins. The main pathway by which apolipoproteins induce cholesterol efflux is through ABCA1. By upregulating ABCA1 levels and by inhibiting its activity and silencing its expression, we show that ABCA1 is involved in cholesterol efflux from astrocytes but not from neurons. Furthermore, our results suggest that ABCG1 is involved in cholesterol efflux to apolipoproteins and lipoproteins from astrocytes but not from neurons, while ABCG4, whose expression is much higher in neurons than astrocytes, is involved in cholesterol efflux from neurons but not astrocytes. These results indicate that different mechanisms regulate cholesterol efflux from neurons and astrocytes, reflecting the different roles that these cell types play in brain cholesterol homeostasis. These results are important in understanding cellular targets of therapeutic drugs under development for the treatments of conditions associated with altered cholesterol homeostasis in the CNS.

Abstract: Stress-inducing agents, including oxidative stress, generate the sphingolipid mediators ceramide (Cer) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) that are involved in stress-induced cellular responses. The two redox-sensitive neutral sphingomyelinase-2 (nSMase2) and sphingosine kinase-1 (SK1) participate in transducing stress signaling to ceramide and S1P, respectively; however, whether these key enzymes are coordinately regulated is not known. We investigated whether a signaling link coordinates nSMase2 and SK1 activation by H2O2. In mesenchymal cells, H2O2 elicits a dose-dependent biphasic effect, mitogenic at low concentration (5μM), and anti-proliferative and toxic at high concentration (100μM). Low H2O2 concentration triggered activation of nSMase2 and SK1 through a nSMase2/Cer-dependent signaling pathway that acted upstream of activation of SK1. Further results implicated src and the trans-activation of PDGFRβ, as supported by the blocking effect of specific siRNAs, pharmacological inhibitors, and genetically deficient cells for nSMase2, src and SK1. The H2O2-induced src/PDGFRβ/SK1 signaling cascade was impaired in nSMase2-deficient fro/fro cells and was rescued by exogenous C2Cer that activated src/PDGFRβ/SK1. Thus, the results define a nSMase2/SK1 signaling pathway implicated in the mitogenic response to low oxidative stress. On the other hand, high oxidative stress induced inhibition of SK1. The results also showed that the toxicity of high H2O2 concentration was comparable in control and nSMase2-deficient cells. Taken together the results identify a tightly coordinated nSMase2/SK1 pathway that mediates the mitogenic effects of H2O2 and may sense the degree of oxidative stress.

Abstract: Tannic acid is a hydrolyzable tannin that exists in many widespread edible plants with a variety of biological activities. In this study, we found that tannic acid potently inhibited the activity of fatty acid synthase (FAS) in a concentration-dependent manner with a half-inhibitory concentration value (IC50) of 0.14μM. The inhibition kinetic results showed that the inhibition of FAS by tannic acid was mixed competitive and noncompetitive manner with respect to acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA, but uncompetitive to NADPH. Tannic acid prevented the differentiation of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes, and thus repressed intracellular lipid accumulation. In the meantime, tannic acid decreased the expression of FAS and down-regulated the mRNA level of FAS and PPARγ during adipocyte differentiation. Further studies showed that the inhibitory effect of tannic acid did not relate to FAS non-specific sedimentation. Since FAS was believed to be a therapeutic target of obesity, these findings suggested that tannic acid was considered having potential in the prevention of obesity.

Abstract: STARD10, a member of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR)-related lipid transfer (START) protein family, is highly expressed in the liver and has been shown to transfer phosphatidylcholine. Therefore it has been assumed that STARD10 may function in the secretion of phospholipids into the bile. To help elucidate the physiological role of STARD10, we produced Stard10 knockout mice (Stard10−/−) and studied their phenotype. Neither liver content nor biliary secretion of phosphatidylcholine was altered in Stard10−/− mice. Unexpectedly, the biliary secretion of bile acids from the liver and the level of taurine-conjugated bile acids in the bile were significantly higher in Stard10−/− mice than wild type (WT) mice. In contrast, the levels of the secondary bile acids were lower in the liver of Stard10−/− mice, suggesting that the enterohepatic cycling is impaired. STARD10 was also expressed in the gallbladder and small intestine where the expression level of apical sodium dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) turned out to be markedly lower in Stard10−/− mice than in WT mice when measured under fed condition. Consistent with the above results, the fecal excretion of bile acids was significantly increased in Stard10−/− mice. Interestingly, PPARα-dependent genes responsible for the regulation of bile acid metabolism were down-regulated in the liver of Stard10−/− mice. The loss of STARD10 impaired the PPARα activity and the expression of a PPARα-target gene such as Cyp8b1 in mouse hepatoma cells. These results indicate that STARD10 is involved in regulating bile acid metabolism through the modulation of PPARα-mediated mechanism.

The glycolipid transfer protein (GLTP) domain of phosphoinositol 4-phosphate adaptor protein-2 (FAPP2): Structure drives preference for simple neutral glycosphingolipids,

Abstract: Phosphoinositol 4-phosphate adaptor protein-2 (FAPP2) plays a key role in glycosphingolipid (GSL) production using its C-terminal domain to transport newly synthesized glucosylceramide away from the cytosol-facing glucosylceramide synthase in the cis-Golgi for further anabolic processing. Structural homology modeling against human glycolipid transfer protein (GLTP) predicts a GLTP-fold for FAPP2 C-terminal domain, but no experimental support exists to warrant inclusion in the GLTP superfamily. Here, the biophysical properties and glycolipid transfer specificity of FAPP2-C-terminal domain have been characterized and compared with other established GLTP-folds. Experimental evidence for a GLTP-fold includes: i) far-UV circular dichroism (CD) showing secondary structure with high alpha-helix content and a low thermally-induced unfolding transition (~41°C); ii) near-UV-CD indicating only subtle tertiary conformational change before/after interaction with membranes containing/lacking glycolipid; iii) Red-shifted tryptophan (Trp) emission wavelength maximum (λmax~352nm) for apo-FAPP2-C-terminal domain consistent with surface exposed intrinsic Trp residues; iv) ‘signature’ GLTP-fold Trp fluorescence response, i.e., intensity decrease (~30%) accompanied by strongly blue-shifted λmax (~14nm) upon interaction with membranes containing glycolipid, supporting direct involvement of Trp in glycolipid binding and enabling estimation of partitioning affinities. A structurally-based preference for other simple uncharged GSLs, in addition to glucosylceramide, makes human FAPP2-GLTP more similar to fungal HET-C2 than to plant AtGLTP1 (glucosylceramide-specific) or to broadly GSL-selective human GLTP. These findings along with the distinct mRNA exon/intron organizations originating from single-copy genes on separate human chromosomes suggest adaptive evolutionary divergence by these two GLTP-folds.

Abstract: The adsorption of colipase is essential for pancreatic triglyceride lipase activity and efficient dietary fat digestion. Yet, little is known about which specific amino acids in the hydrophobic surface of colipase influence adsorption. In this study, we systematically substituted alanine or tryptophan at residues implicated in adsorption of colipase to an interface. We expressed, purified recombinant colipase mutants and characterized the ability of each alanine mutant to restore activity to lipase in the presence of bile salts. The functions of L16A, Y55A, I79A and F84A colipase were most impaired with activities ranging from 20 to 60% of wild-type colipase. We next characterized the fluorescence properties of the tryptophan mutants in the absence and presence of bile–salt–oleic acid mixed micelles. We performed steady-state emission spectra to determine peak shift and I330/I350 ratio and acrylamide quenching curves to characterize the environment of the residues. The analysis supports a model of adsorption that includes residues Leu 34 and Leu 36 on the 2nd loop, Tyr 55 and Tyr 59 on the 3rd loop and Ile 75 and Ile 79 on the 4th loop. The analysis confirms that Phe 84 is not part of the adsorption surface and likely stabilizes the conformation of colipase. Contrary to the predictions of computer modeling, the results provide strong support for an essential role of Tyr 55 in colipase adsorption to mixed micelles. The results indicate that the adsorption of colipase to mixed micelles is mediated by specific residues residing in a defined surface of colipase.

Abstract: In human high-density lipoprotein (HDL) represents the major cholesterol carrying lipoprotein class in cord blood, while cholesterol is mainly carried by low-density lipoprotein in maternal serum. Additionally, to carrying cholesterol, HDL also associates with a range of proteins as cargo. We tested the hypothesis that fetal HDL carries proteins qualitatively and quantitatively different from maternal HDL. These differences then contribute to distinct HDL functionality in both circulations. Shotgun proteomics and biochemical analyses were used to assess composition/function of fetal and maternal HDL isolated from uncomplicated human pregnancies at term of gestation. The pattern of analyzed proteins that were statistically elevated in fetal HDL (apoE, proteins involved in coagulation, transport processes) suggests a particle characteristic for the light HDL2 sub-fraction. In contrast, proteins that were enriched in maternal HDL (apoL, apoF, PON1, apoD, apoCs) have been described almost exclusively in the dense HDL3 fraction and relevant to its anti-oxidative function and role in innate immunity. Strikingly, PON1 mass and activity were 5-fold lower (p<0.01) in the fetus, which was accompanied by attenuation of anti-oxidant capacity of fetal HDL. Despite almost equal quantity of CETP in maternal and fetal HDL, its enzymatic activity was 55% lower (p<0.001) in the fetal circulation, whereas LCAT activity was not altered. These findings indicate that maternally derived HDL differs from fetal HDL with respect to its proteome, size and function. Absence of apoA-1, apoL and PON1 on fetal HDL is associated with decreased anti-oxidative properties together with deficiency in innate immunity collectively indicating distinct HDLs in fetuses.

Abstract: We have examined the polar lipids of Clostridium psychrophilum, a recently characterized psychrophilic Clostridium isolated from an Antarctic microbial mat. Lipids were extracted from cells grown near the optimal growth temperature (+5°C) and at −5°C, and analyzed by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography and liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. The major phospholipids of this species are: cardiolipin, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylglycerol. Phosphatidylserine and lyso-phosphatidylethanolamine were found as minor components. The most abundant glycolipids are a monoglycosyldiradylglycerol (MGDRG) and a diglycosyldiradylglycerol (DGDRG). The latter was only seen in cells grown at −5°C. An ethanolamine-phosphate derivative of N-acetylglucosaminyldiradylglycerol was seen in cells grown at −5°C and an ethanolamine-phosphate derivative of MGDRG was found in cells grown at +5°C. All lipids were present in both the all acyl and plasmalogen (alk-1′-enyl acyl) forms with the exception of PS and MGDRG, which were predominantly in the diacyl form. The significance of lipid changes at the two growth temperatures is discussed.

Abstract: The adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) plays an important role in the regulation of inflammatory and immune responses. Our previous work has demonstrated that A2AR agonists exhibit atheroprotective effects by increasing expression of reverse cholesterol transport proteins in cultured human macrophages. This study explores the impact of pharmacologic activation/inhibition and gene silencing of A2AR on cholesterol homeostasis in both THP-1 human monocytes/macrophages and primary human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC). THP-1 human monocytes/macrophages and HAEC exposed to the A2AR-specific agonist ATL313 exhibited upregulation of proteins responsible for cholesterol efflux: the ABCA1 and G1 transporters. Further, activation of A2AR led to upregulation of the cholesterol metabolizing enzyme P450 27-hydroxylase, accompanied by intracellular changes in level of oxysterols. We demonstrate that anti-atherogenic properties of A2AR activation are not limited to the regulation of lipid efflux in vasculature, but include protection from lipid overload in macrophages, particularly via suppression of the CD36 scavenger receptor. The reduced lipid accumulation manifests directly as a diminution in foam cell transformation. In THP-1 macrophages, either A2AR pharmacological blockade or gene silencing promote lipid accumulation and enhance foam cell transformation. Our pre-clinical data provides evidence suggesting that A2AR stimulation by ATL313 has the potential to be a viable therapeutic strategy for cardiovascular disease prevention, particularly in patients with elevated risk due to immune/inflammatory disorders.

Abstract: l-carnitine is a key molecule in both mitochondrial and peroxisomal lipid metabolisms. l-carnitine is biosynthesized from gamma-butyrobetaine by a reaction catalyzed by the gamma-butyrobetaine hydroxylase (Bbox1). The aim of this work was to identify molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of l-carnitine biosynthesis and availability. Using 3′ RACE, we identified four alternatively polyadenylated Bbox1 mRNAs in rat liver. We utilized a combination of in vitro experiments using hybrid constructs containing the Bbox1 3′ UTR and in vivo experiments on rat liver mRNAs to reveal specificities in the different Bbox1 mRNA isoforms, especially in terms of polyadenylation efficiency, mRNA stability and translation efficiency. This complex maturation process of the Bbox1 mRNAs in the liver was studied on rats fed a high-fat diet. High-fat diet selectively increased the level of three Bbox1 mRNA isoforms in rat liver and the alternative use of polyadenylation sites contributed to the global increase in Bbox1 enzymatic activity and l-carnitine levels. Our results show that the maturation of Bbox1 mRNAs is nutritionally regulated in the liver through a selective polyadenylation process to adjust l-carnitine biosynthesis to the energy supply.

Abstract: High expression of autotaxin in cancers is often associated with increased tumor progression, angiogenesis and metastasis. This is explained mainly since autotaxin produces the lipid growth factor, lysophosphatidate (LPA), which stimulates cell division, survival and migration. It has recently become evident that these signaling effects of LPA also produce resistance to chemotherapy and radiation-induced cell death. This results especially from the stimulation of LPA2 receptors, which depletes the cell of Siva-1, a pro-apoptotic signaling protein and stimulates prosurvival kinase pathways through a mechanism mediated via TRIP-6. LPA signaling also increases the formation of sphingosine 1-phosphate, a pro-survival lipid. At the same time, LPA decreases the accumulation of ceramides, which are used in radiation therapy and by many chemotherapeutic agents to stimulate apoptosis. The signaling actions of extracellular LPA are terminated by its dephosphorylation by a family of lipid phosphate phosphatases (LPP) that act as ecto-enzymes. In addition, lipid phosphate phoshatase-1 attenuates signaling downstream of the activation of both LPA receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases. This makes many cancer cells hypersensitive to the action of various growth factors since they often express low LPP1/3 activity. Increasing our understanding of the complicated signaling pathways that are used by LPA to stimulate cell survival should identify new therapeutic targets that can be exploited to increase the efficacy of chemo- and radio-therapy.

Abstract: Reduced mitochondrial fatty acid (FA) β-oxidation can cause accumulation of triglyceride in liver, while intake of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) has been recommended as a promising novel therapy to decrease hepatic triglyceride content. However, reduced mitochondrial FA β-oxidation also facilitates accumulation of EPA. To investigate the interplay between EPA administration, mitochondrial activity and hepatic triglyceride accumulation, we investigated the effects of EPA administration to carnitine-deficient mice with impaired mitochondrial FA β-oxidation. C57BL/6J mice received a high-fat diet supplemented or not with 3% EPA in the presence or absence of 500mgmildronate/kg/day for 10days. Liver mitochondrial and peroxisomal oxidation, lipid classes and FA composition were determined. Histological staining was performed and mRNA level of genes related to lipid metabolism and inflammation in liver and adipose tissue was determined. Levels of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids and cytokines were measured in plasma. The results showed that mildronate treatment decreased hepatic carnitine concentration and mitochondrial FA β-oxidation and induced severe triglyceride accumulation accompanied by elevated systemic inflammation. Surprisingly, inclusion of EPA in the diet exacerbated the mildronate-induced triglyceride accumulation. This was accompanied by a considerable increase of EPA accumulation while decreased total n-3/n-6 ratio in liver. However, inclusion of EPA in the diet attenuated the mildronate-induced mRNA expression of inflammatory genes in adipose tissue. Taken together, dietary supplementation with EPA exacerbated the triglyceride accumulation induced by impaired mitochondrial FA β-oxidation. Thus, further thorough evaluation of the potential risk of EPA supplementation as a therapy for NAFLD associated with impaired mitochondrial FA oxidation is warranted.

Abstract: Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), the most prominent lysoglycerophospholipids, are emerging as a novel class of inflammatory lipids, joining thromboxanes, leukotrienes and prostaglandins with which they share metabolic pathways and regulatory mechanisms. Enzymes that participate in LPC and LPA metabolism, such as the phospholipase A2 superfamily (PLA2) and autotaxin (ATX, ENPP2), play central roles in regulating LPC and LPA levels and consequently their actions. LPC/LPA biosynthetic pathways will be briefly presented and LPC/LPA signaling properties and their possible functions in the regulation of the immune system and chronic inflammation will be reviewed. Furthermore, implications of exacerbated LPC and/or LPA signaling in the context of chronic inflammatory diseases, namely rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, pulmonary fibrosis and hepatitis, will be discussed. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Advances in Lysophospholipid Research.

Abstract: Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) is responsible for the hydrolysis of the endogenous cannabinoid (CB) receptor ligand anandamide. Here we have investigated whether the expression levels of FAAH and CB1 receptors influence the prognostic value of markers of angiogenesis in prostate cancer. Data from a cohort of 419 patients who were diagnosed with prostate cancer at transurethral resection for lower urinary tract symptoms, of whom approximately 2/3 had been followed by expectancy, were used. Scores for the angiogenesis markers endoglin and von Willebrand factor (vWf), the endocannabinoid markers fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and cannabinoid CB1 receptors and the cell proliferation marker Ki-67 were available in the database. For the cases followed by expectancy, the prognostic value of endoglin was dependent upon the tumour epithelial FAAH immunoreactivity (FAAH-IR) and CB1IR scores, and the non-malignant epithelial FAAH-IR scores, but not the non-malignant CB1IR scores or the tumour blood vessel FAAH-IR scores. This dependency upon the tumour epithelial FAAH-IR or CB1IR scores was less apparent for vWf, and was not seen for Ki-67. Using an endoglin cut-off value of 10 positively stained vessels per core and a median split of tumour FAAH-IR, four groups could be generated, with 15year of disease-specific survival (%) of 68±7 (low endoglin, low FAAH), 45±11 (high endoglin, low FAAH), 77±6 (low endoglin, high FAAH) and 21±10 (high endoglin, high FAAH). Thus, the cases with high endoglin and high FAAH scores have the poorest rate of disease-specific survival. At diagnosis, the number of cases with tumour stages 1a–1b relative to stages 2–4 was sensitive to the endoglin score in a manner dependent upon the tumour FAAH-IR. It is concluded that the prognostic value of endoglin as a marker of neovascularisation in prostate cancer can be influenced by the expression level of markers of the endocannabinoid system.

Abstract: A number of viruses contain lipid membranes, which are in close contact with capsid proteins and/or nucleic acids and have an important role in the viral infection process. In this study membrane lipids of intact viruses have been analysed by MALDI-TOF/MS with a novel methodology avoiding lipid extraction and separation steps. To validate the novel method, a wide screening of viral lipids has been performed analysing highly purified intact bacterial and archaeal viruses displaying different virion architectures. Lipid profiles reported here contain all lipids previously detected by mass spectrometry analyses of virus lipid extracts. Novel details on the membrane lipid composition of selected viruses have also been obtained. In addition we show that this technique allows the study of lipid distribution easily in subviral particles during virus fractionation. The possibility to reliably analyse minute amounts of intact viruses by mass spectrometry opens new perspectives in analytical and functional lipid studies on a wider range of viruses including pathogenic human ones, which are difficult to purify in large amounts.

Abstract: In plants and mammals, oxylipins may be synthesized via multi step processes that consist of dioxygenation and isomerization of the intermediately formed hydroperoxy fatty acid. These processes are typically catalyzed by two distinct enzyme classes: dioxygenases and cytochrome P450 enzymes. In ascomycetes biosynthesis of oxylipins may proceed by a similar two-step pathway. An important difference, however, is that both enzymatic activities may be combined in a single bifunctional enzyme. These types of enzymes are named Psi-factor producing oxygenases (Ppo). Here, the spatial organization of the two domains of PpoA from Aspergillus nidulans was analyzed by small-angle X-ray scattering and the obtained data show that the enzyme exhibits a relatively flat trimeric shape. Atomic structures of the single domains were obtained by template-based structure prediction and docked into the enzyme envelope of the low resolution structure obtained by SAXS. EPR-based distance measurements between the tyrosyl radicals formed in the activated dioxygenase domain of the enzyme supported the trimeric structure obtained from SAXS and the previous assignment of Tyr374 as radical-site in PpoA. Furthermore, two phenylalanine residues in the cytochrome P450 domain were shown to modulate the specificity of hydroperoxy fatty acid rearrangement.

Abstract: 12/15-Lipoxygenases (12/15-LOX) have been implicated in inflammatory and hyperproliferative diseases but the numerous aspects of structural biology of these enzymes are far from clear. Early mutagenesis data and structural modeling of enzyme–substrate complexes suggested that Arg403, which is localized at the entrance of the putative substrate binding pocket, might interact with the fatty acid carboxylic group. On the other hand, side-chain of Arg403 is a part of an ionic network with the residues of α2-helix, which undergoes pronounced conformation changes upon inhibitor binding. To explore the role of Arg403 for catalysis in more detail we exchanged positively charged Arg403 to neutral Leu and quantified structural and functional consequences of the alteration at the site of mutation using fluorometric techniques. We found that a loss of electrostatic interaction between Arg403 and negatively charged amino acid residues of α2-helix has only minor impact on protein folding, but partially destabilized the tertiary structure of the enzyme. We hypothesize that interaction of Arg403 with the substrate's carboxylate might be involved in a complex mechanism triggering conformational changes of the α2-helix, which are required for formation of the catalytically competent dimer r12/15-LOX complex at pre-catalytic stages.

Abstract: X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is a peroxisomal disorder caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene. Accumulation of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) that have been attributed to reduced peroxisomal VLCFA β-oxidation activity are the hallmark of the disease. Overexpression of ABCD2 gene, the closest homolog of ABCD1, has been shown to compensate for ABCD1, thus correcting the VLCFA derangement. The accumulation of VLCFA leads to a neuroinflammatory disease process associated with demyelination of the cerebral white matter. The present study underlines the importance of caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) in inducing the expression of ABCD2 (ALDRP), and normalizing the peroxisomal β-oxidation as well as the levels of saturated and monounsaturated VLCFAs in cultured human skin fibroblasts of X-ALD patients. The expression of ELOVL1, the single elongase catalyzing the synthesis of both saturated VLCFA (C26:0) and mono-unsaturated VLCFA (C26:1), was also reduced by CAPE treatment. Importantly, CAPE upregulated Abcd2 expression and peroxisomal β-oxidation and lowered the VLCFA levels in Abcd1-deficient U87 astrocytes and B12 oligodendrocytes. In addition, using Abcd1/Abcd2-silenced mouse primary astrocytes we examined the effects of CAPE in VLCFA-induced inflammatory response. CAPE treatment decreased the inflammatory response as the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, inflammatory cytokine, and activation of NF-κB in Abcd1/Abcd2-silenced mouse primary astrocytes was reduced. The observations indicate that CAPE corrects both the metabolic disease of VLCFA as well as secondary inflammatory disease; therefore, it may be a potential drug candidate to be tested for X-ALD therapy in humans.

Abstract: Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have been applied as diagnostic and therapeutic agents because they can be targeted, localized, and be heated to cause cell death. However, their use has been limited by their relatively low biocompatibility. In this work, we coated the GNPs' surface by a biocompatible phospholipid bilayer composed of 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol) (SOPG). We tested their interaction with A549 cells to investigate their uptake and intracellular fate as well as the response of the cells to the presence of the GNPs. We used flow cytometry and confocal microscopy to show that the SOPG coated GNPs were readily taken up by the A549 cells. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and fluorescence images further showed that the number of granular structures in the cells was increased following exposure to the lipid coated GNPs. Co-localization experiments demonstrated that SOPG coated GNPs localize in acidic compartments in a time dependent manner and that the number of these increase as the cells are exposed to the GNPs suggesting that they induce formation of lamellar bodies (LBs) which in A549 cells in turn can serve as a means of exporting the GNPs.

Overexpression of PLIN5 in skeletal muscle promotes oxidative gene expression and intramyocellular lipid content without compromising insulin sensitivity,

Abstract: Aims/hypothesis: While lipid deposition in the skeletal muscle is considered to be involved in obesity-associated insulin resistance, neutral intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) accumulation per se does not necessarily induce insulin resistance. We previously demonstrated that overexpression of the lipid droplet coat protein perilipin 2 augments intramyocellular lipid content while improving insulin sensitivity. Another member of the perilipin family, perilipin 5 (PLIN5), is predominantly expressed in oxidative tissues like the skeletal muscle. Here we investigated the effects of PLIN5 overexpression – in comparison with the effects of PLIN2 – on skeletal muscle lipid levels, gene expression profiles and insulin sensitivity. Methods: Gene electroporation was used to overexpress PLIN5 in tibialis anterior muscle of rats fed a high fat diet. Eight days after electroporation, insulin-mediated glucose uptake in the skeletal muscle was measured by means of a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. Electron microscopy, fluorescence microscopy and lipid extractions were performed to investigate IMCL accumulation. Gene expression profiles were obtained using microarrays. Results: TAG storage and lipid droplet size increased upon PLIN5 overexpression. Despite the higher IMCL content, insulin sensitivity was not impaired and DAG and acylcarnitine levels were unaffected. In contrast to the effects of PLIN2 overexpression, microarray data analysis revealed a gene expression profile favoring FA oxidation and improved mitochondrial function. Conclusions/interpretation: Both PLIN2 and PLIN5 increase neutral IMCL content without impeding insulin-mediated glucose uptake. As opposed to the effects of PLIN2 overexpression, overexpression of PLIN5 in the skeletal muscle promoted expression of a cluster of genes under control of PPARα and PGC1α involved in FA catabolism and mitochondrial oxidation.

Abstract: Survival of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, like most microorganisms, requires switching from a rapidly dividing to a non-dividing or stationary state. To further understand how cells navigate this switch, we examined sphingolipids since they are key structural elements of membranes and also regulate signaling pathways vital for survival. During and after the switch to a non-dividing state there is a large increase in total free and sphingolipid-bound long chain-bases and an even larger increase in free and bound C20-long-chain bases, which are nearly undetectable in dividing cells. These changes are due to intrinsic factors including Orm1 and Orm2, ceramide synthase, Lcb4 kinase and the Tsc3 subunit of serine palmitoyltransferase as well as extrinsic factors including glucose and iron. Lowering the concentration of glucose, a form of calorie restriction, decreases the level of LCBs, which is consistent with the idea that reducing the level of some sphingolipids enhances lifespan. In contrast, iron deprivation increases LCB levels and decreases long term survival; however, these phenomena may not be related because iron deprivation disrupts many metabolic pathways. The correlation between increased LCBs and shorter lifespan is unsupported at this time. The physiological rise in LCBs that we observe may serve to modulate nutrient transporters and possibly other membrane phenomena that contribute to enhanced stress resistance and survival in stationary phase.

Abstract: The ubiquitous transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) is known to have diverse and complex cellular functions. Although relevant literature has reported that YY1 expression can induce the down-regulation of C/EBP homologous protein 10 (CHOP-10) and then allow the transactivation of certain transcription factors required for lipogenesis, similar properties of YY1 are poorly understood in animal model systems. In this study, we demonstrate hepatic lipid accumulation in YY1 transgenic zebrafish (GY). Oil-red staining cells were predominantly increased in the livers of both GY larvae and adults, indicating that YY1 functionally promoted lipid accumulation in GY livers. Molecular analysis revealed that YY1 over-expression contributed to the accumulation of hepatic triglycerides (TGs) by inhibiting CHOP-10 expression in the juvenile GY and 3 other fish cell lines; the decreased CHOP-10 expression then induced the transactivation of C/EBP-α and PPAR-γ expression. CHOP-10 morpholino (MO)-injected and rosiglitazone-treated G-liver larvae showed liver steatosis by transactivating PPAR-γ. PPAR-γ MO-injected, and GW9662- and astaxanthin-treated GY larvae showed no liver steatosis by inhibiting PPAR-γ. Moreover, a fatty acid (FA) accumulation and a TG decrease were found in the liver of aged GY, leading to the induction of FA-oxidizing systems that increased hepatic oxidative stress and liver damage. This study is the first to examine YY1 as a potential stimulator for GY liver steatosis and lipotoxicity.

Here we demonstrate that enforced expression of hepatic lipase in the endoplasmic reticulum in McArdle RH7777 hepatocytes resulted in a significant decrease in the incorporation of fatty acids into cellular triacylglycerol and cholesteryl ester accompanied by attenuation of secretion of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins. Hepatic lipase-mediated depletion of intracellular lipid storage increased the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α and its target genes and augmented oxidation of fatty acids. These data show that 1) hepatic lipase is active in the endoplasmic reticulum and 2) intracellular hepatic lipase modulates cellular lipid metabolism and lipoprotein secretion.

Abstract: There is a strong association between lysosome enzyme deficiencies and monogenic disorders resulting in lysosomal storage disease. Of the more than 75 characterized lysosomal proteins, two thirds are directly linked to inherited diseases of metabolism. Only one lysosomal storage disease, Niemann–Pick disease, is associated with impaired phospholipid metabolism. However, other phospholipases are found in the lysosome but remain poorly characterized. A recent exception is lysosomal phospholipase A2 (group XV phospholipase A2). Although no inherited disorder of lysosomal phospholipid metabolism has yet been associated with a loss of function of this lipase, this enzyme may be a target for an acquired form of lysosomal storage, drug induced phospholipidosis. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Phospholipids and Phospholipid Metabolism.

Abstract: The citrate carrier (CIC), a nuclear-encoded protein located in the mitochondrial inner membrane, plays an important metabolic role in the transport of acetyl-CoA from the mitochondrion to the cytosol in the form of citrate for fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis. Citrate has been reported to be essential for fibroblast differentiation into fat cells. Because peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) is known to be one of the master regulators of adipogenesis, we aimed to study the regulation of CIC by the PPARγ ligand rosiglitazone (BRL) in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and in adipocytes. We demonstrated that BRL up-regulated CIC mRNA and protein levels in fibroblasts, while it did not elicit any effects in mature adipocytes. The enhancement of CIC levels upon BRL treatment was reversed using the PPARγ antagonist GW9662, addressing how this effect was mediated by PPARγ. Functional experiments using a reporter gene containing rat CIC promoter showed that BRL enhanced CIC promoter activity. Mutagenesis studies, electrophoretic-mobility-shift assay and chromatin-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that upon BRL treatment, PPARγ and Sp1 are recruited on the Sp1-containing region within the CIC promoter, leading to an increase in CIC expression. In addition, mithramycin, a specific inhibitor for Sp1-DNA binding activity, abolished the PPARγ-mediated up-regulation of CIC in fibroblasts. The stimulatory effects of BRL disappeared in mature adipocytes in which PPARγ/Sp1 complex recruited SMRT corepressor to the Sp1 site of the CIC promoter. Taken together, our results contribute to clarify the molecular mechanisms by which PPARγ regulates CIC expression during the differentiation stages of fibroblasts into mature adipocytes.

Abstract: Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major active ingredient of marijuana, and other cannabinoids inhibit tumor growth in animal models of cancer. This effect relies, at least in part, on the up-regulation of several endoplasmic reticulum stress-related proteins including the pseudokinase tribbles homologue-3 (TRIB3), which leads in turn to the inhibition of the AKT/mTORC1 axis and the subsequent stimulation of autophagy-mediated apoptosis in tumor cells. Here, we took advantage of the use of cells derived from Trib3-deficient mice to investigate the precise mechanisms by which TRIB3 regulates the anti-cancer action of THC. Our data show that RasV12/E1A-transformed embryonic fibroblasts derived from Trib3-deficient mice are resistant to THC-induced cell death. We also show that genetic inactivation of this protein abolishes the ability of THC to inhibit the phosphorylation of AKT and several of its downstream targets, including those involved in the regulation of the AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) axis. Our data support the idea that THC-induced TRIB3 up-regulation inhibits AKT phosphorylation by regulating the accessibility of AKT to its upstream activatory kinase (the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2; mTORC2). Finally, we found that tumors generated by inoculation of Trib3-deficient cells in nude mice are resistant to THC anticancer action. Altogether, the observations presented here strongly support that TRIB3 plays a crucial role on THC anti-neoplastic activity.

Abstract: In all mammals, white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT) are found together in several fat depots, forming a multi-depot organ. Adrenergic stimulation induces an increase in BAT usually referred to as “browning”. This phenomenon is important because of its potential use in curbing obesity and related disorders; thus, understanding its cellular mechanisms in humans may be useful for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Data in rodents have supported the direct transformation of white into brown adipocytes. Biopsies of pure white omental fat were collected from 12 patients affected by the catecholamine-secreting tumor pheochromocytoma (pheo-patients) and compared with biopsies from controls. Half of the omental fat samples from pheo-patients contained uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-immunoreactive-(ir) multilocular cells that were often arranged in a BAT-like pattern endowed with noradrenergic fibers and dense capillary network. Many UCP1-ir adipocytes showed the characteristic morphology of paucilocular cells, which we have been described as cytological marker of transdifferentiation. Electron microscopy showed increased mitochondrial density in multi- and paucilocular cells and disclosed the presence of perivascular brown adipocyte precursors. Brown fat genes, such as UCP1, PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16) and β3-adrenoreceptor, were highly expressed in the omentum of pheo-patients and in those cases without visible morphologic re-arrangement. Of note, the brown determinant PRDM16 was detected by immunohistochemistry only in nuclei of multi- and paucilocular adipocytes. Quantitative electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry for Ki67 suggest an unlikely contribution of proliferative events to the phenomenon. The data support the idea that, in adult humans, white adipocytes of pure white fat that are subjected to adrenergic stimulation are able to undergo a process of direct transformation into brown adipocytes.

Abstract: Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) is a target of therapeutic intervention for coronary heart disease. Anacetrapib, a potent inhibitor of CETP, has been shown to reduce LDL-cholesterol by 40% and increase HDL-cholesterol by 140% in patients, and is currently being evaluated in a phase III cardiovascular outcomes trial. HDL is known to possess anti-inflammatory properties, however with such large increases in HDL-cholesterol, it is unclear whether CETP inhibition perturbs HDL functionality such as anti-inflammatory effects on endothelial cells. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether CETP inhibition by anacetrapib affects the anti-inflammatory properties of HDL. HDL was isolated from either hamsters treated with vehicle or anacetrapib for 2weeks, or from normal human subjects treated either placebo, 20mg, or 150mg anacetrapib daily for 2weeks. Anacetrapib treatment increased plasma HDL cholesterol levels by 65% and between 48 and 82% in hamsters and humans, respectively. Pre-incubation of human aortic endothelial cells with HDL isolated from both control and anacetrapib treated hamsters suppressed TNFα induced expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and E-selectin. Similar results were obtained with human HDL samples pre and post treatment with placebo or anacetrapib. Further, HDL inhibited TNFα-induced MCP-1 secretion, monocyte adhesion and NF-κB activation in endothelial cells, and the inhibition was similar between control and anacetrapib treated groups. These studies demonstrate that anacetrapib treatment does not impair the ability of HDL to suppress an inflammatory response in endothelial cells.

Abstract: To investigate the underlying mechanism of targets of cyanidin, a flavonoid, which exhibits potent anti-atherogenic activities in vitro and in vivo, a natural chemical library that identified potent agonistic activity between cyanidin and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) was performed. Cyanidin induced transactivation activity in all three PPAR subtypes in a reporter gene assay and time-resolved fluorescence energy transfer analyses. Cyanidin also bound directly to all three subtypes, as assessed by surface plasmon resonance experiments, and showed the greatest affinity to PPARα. These effects were confirmed by measuring the expression of unique genes of each PPAR subtype. Cyanidin significantly reduced cellular lipid concentrations in lipid-loaded steatotic hepatocytes. In addition, transcriptome profiling in lipid-loaded primary hepatocytes revealed that the net effects of stimulation with cyanidin on lipid metabolic pathways were similar to those elicited by hypolipidemic drugs. Cyanidin likely acts as a physiological PPARα agonist and potentially for PPARβ/δ and γ, and reduces hepatic lipid concentrations by rewiring the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolic pathways.

Abstract: Ceramide, a major structural element in the cellular membrane, is a key regulatory factor in various cellular behaviors that are dependent on ceramide-induced association of specific proteins. However, molecular mechanisms that regulate ceramide-induced embryonic stem cell (ESC) migration are still not well understood. Thus, we investigated the effect of ceramide on migration and its related signal pathways in mouse ESCs. Among ceramide species with different fatty acid chain lengths, C16-Cer increased migration of mouse ESCs in a dose- (≥1μM) and time-dependent (≥8h) manners, as determined by the cell migration assay. C16-Cer (10μM) increased protein-kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation. Subsequently, C16-Cer increased focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Paxillin phosphorylation, which were inhibited by PKC inhibitor Bisindolylmaleimide I (1μM). When we examined for the downstream signaling molecules, C16-Cer activated small G protein (Cdc42) and increased the formation of complex with Neural Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein (N-WASP)/Cdc42/Actin-Related Protein 2/3 (Arp2/3). This complex formation was disrupted by FAK- and Paxillin-specific siRNAs. Furthermore, C16-Cer-induced increase of filamentous actin (F-actin) expression was inhibited by Cdc42-, N-WASP-, and Arp2/3-specific siRNAs, respectively. Indeed, C16-Cer increased cofilin-1/F-actin interaction or F-actin/α-actinin-1 and α-actinin-4 interactions in the cytoskeleton compartment, which was reversed by Cdc42-specific siRNA. Finally, C16-Cer-induced increase of cell migration was inhibited by knocking down each signal pathway-related molecules with siRNA or inhibitors. In conclusion, C16-Cer enhances mouse ESC migration through the regulation of PKC and FAK/Paxillin-dependent N-WASP/Cdc42/Arp2/3 complex formation as well as through promoting the interaction between cofilin-1 or α-actinin-1/-4 and F-actin.

Abstract: In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the molecular species profile of the major membrane glycerophospholipid phosphatidylcholine (PC) is determined by the molecular species-selectivity of the biosynthesis routes and by acyl chain remodeling. Overexpression of the glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase Sct1p was recently shown to induce a strong increase in the cellular content of palmitate (C16:0). Using stable isotope labeling and mass spectrometry, the present study shows that wild type yeast overexpressing Sct1p incorporates excess C16:0 into PC via the methylation of PE, the CDP-choline route, and post-synthetic acyl chain remodeling. Overexpression of Sct1p increased the extent of remodeling of PE-derived PC, providing a novel tool to perform mechanistic studies on PC acyl chain exchange. The exchange of acyl chains occurred at both the sn-1 and sn-2 positions of the glycerol backbone of PC, and required the phospholipase B Plb1p for optimal efficiency. Sct1p-catalyzed acyl chain exchange, the acyl-CoA binding protein Acb1p, the Plb1p homologue Plb2p, and the glycerophospholipid:triacylglycerol transacylase Lro1p were not required for PC remodeling. The results indicate that PC serves as a buffer for excess cellular C16:0.

Abstract: Recent studies showed that the phospholipase subunits of Platelet Activating Factor Acetylhydrolase (PAFAH) Ib, α1 and α2 partially localize to the Golgi complex and regulate its structure and function. Using siRNA knockdown of individual subunits, we find that α1 and α2 perform overlapping and unique roles in regulating Golgi morphology, assembly, and secretory cargo trafficking. Knockdown of either α1 or α2 reduced secretion of soluble proteins, but neither single knockdown reduced secretion to the same degree as knockdown of both. Knockdown of α1 or α2 inhibited reassembly of an intact Golgi complex to the same extent as knockdown of both. Transport of VSV-G was slowed but at different steps in the secretory pathway: reduction of α1 slowed trans Golgi network to plasma membrane transport, whereas α2 loss reduced endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi trafficking. Similarly, knockdown of either subunit alone disrupted the Golgi complex but with markedly different morphologies. Finally, knockdown of α1, or double knockdown of α1 and α2, resulted in a significant redistribution of kinase dead protein kinase D from the Golgi to the plasma membrane, whereas loss of α2 alone had no such effect. These studies reveal an unexpected complexity in the regulation of Golgi structure and function by PAFAH Ib.

Abstract: Primary rodent hepatocytes and hepatoma cell lines are commonly used as model systems to elucidate and study potential drug targets for metabolic diseases such as obesity and atherosclerosis. However, if therapies are to be developed, it is essential that our knowledge gained from these systems is translatable to that of human. Here, we have characterized lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in primary human hepatocytes for comparison to rodent primary hepatocytes and human hepatoma cell lines. Primary human hepatocytes were maintained in collagen coated dishes in confluent monolayers for up to 3days. We found primary human hepatocytes were viable, underwent lipid synthesis, and were able to secret lipoproteins up to 3days in culture. Furthermore, the lipoprotein profile secreted by primary human hepatocytes was comparable to that found in human plasma; this contrasts with primary rodent hepatocytes and human hepatoma cells. We also investigated the pharmacological effects of nicotinic acid (niacin, NA), a potent dyslipidemic drug, on hepatic lipid synthesis and lipoprotein secretion. We found NA increased the expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 in primary human hepatocytes, which may potentially explain how NA increases plasma high-density lipoproteins in humans. In conclusion, primary human hepatocytes are a more relevant model to study lipid synthesis and lipoprotein secretion than hepatoma cells or rodent primary hepatocyte models. Further research needs to be done to maintain liver specific functions of primary human hepatocytes in prolonged cultures for these cells to be a viable model.

Abstract: How cholesterol, a key membrane constituent, affects membrane surface area dynamics in secretory cells is unclear. Using methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) to deplete cholesterol, we imaged melanotrophs from male Wistar rats in real-time and monitored membrane capacitance (Cm), fluctuations of which reflect exocytosis and endocytosis. Treatment with MβCD reduced cellular cholesterol and caused a dose-dependent attenuation of the Ca2+-evoked increase in Cm (IC50=5.3mM) vs. untreated cells. Cytosol dialysis of MβCD enhanced the attenuation of Cm increase (IC50=3.3mM), suggesting cholesterol depletion at intracellular membrane sites was involved in attenuating exocytosis. Acute extracellular application of MβCD resulted in an immediate Cm decline, which correlated well with the cellular surface area decrease, indicating the involvement of cholesterol in the regulation of membrane surface area dynamics. This decline in Cm was three-fold slower than MβCD-mediated fluorescent cholesterol decay, implying that exocytosis is the likely physiological means for plasma membrane cholesterol replenishment. MβCD had no effect on the specific Cm and the blockade of endocytosis by Dyngo 4a, confirmed by inhibition of dextran uptake, also had no effect on the time-course of MβCD-induced Cm decline. Thus acute exposure to MβCD evokes a Cm decline linked to the removal of membrane cholesterol, which cannot be compensated for by exocytosis. We propose that the primary contribution of cholesterol to surface area dynamics is via its role in regulated exocytosis.

Abstract: We investigated nuclear neutral-lipid (NL) composition and organization, as NL may represent an alternative source for providing fatty acids and cholesterol (C) to membranes, signaling paths, and transcription factors in the nucleus. We show here that nuclear NL were organized into nonpolar domains in the form of nuclear-lipid droplets (nLD). By fluorescent confocal microscopy, representative nLD were observed in situ within the nuclei of rat hepatocytes in vivo and HepG2 cells, maintained under standard conditions in culture, and within nuclei isolated from rat liver. nLD were resistant to Triton X-100 and became stained with Sudan Red, OsO4, and BODIPY493/503. nLD and control cytosolic-lipid droplets (cLD) were isolated from rat-liver nuclei and from homogenates, respectively, by sucrose-gradient sedimentation. Lipids were extracted, separated by thin-layer chromatography, and quantified. nLD were composed of 37% lipids and 63% proteins. The nLD lipid composition was as follows: 19% triacylglycerols (TAG), 39% cholesteryl esters, 27% C, and 15% polar lipids; whereas the cLD composition contained different proportions of these same lipid classes, in particular 91% TAG. The TAG fatty acids from both lipid droplets were enriched in oleic, linoleic, and palmitic acids. The TAG from the nLD corresponded to a small pool, whereas the TAG from the cLD constituted the main cellular pool (at about 100% yield from the total homogenate). In conclusion, nLD are a domain within the nucleus where NL are stored and organized and may be involved in nuclear lipid homeostasis.

Abstract: Most coronary deaths occur in patients older than 65years. Age associated alterations in the composition and function of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) may contribute to cardiovascular mortality. The effect of advanced age on the composition and function of HDL is not well understood. HDL was isolated from healthy young and elderly subjects. HDL composition, cellular cholesterol efflux/uptake, anti-oxidant properties and paraoxonase activity were assessed. We observed a 3-fold increase of the acute phase protein serum amyloid A, an increased content of complement C3 and proteins involved in endopeptidase/protease inhibition in HDL of elderly subjects, whereas levels of apolipoprotein E were significantly decreased. HDL from elderly subjects contained less cholesterol but increased sphingomyelin. Most importantly, HDL from elderly subjects showed defective antioxidant properties, lower paraoxonase 1 activity and was more rapidly taken up by macrophages, whereas cholesterol efflux capability was not altered. These findings suggest that aging alters HDL composition, resulting in functional impairment that may contribute to the onset/progression of cardiovascular disease.

Abstract: In yeast, deletion of ERG27, which encodes the sterol biosynthetic enzyme, 3-keto-reductase, results in a concomitant loss of the upstream enzyme, Erg7p, an oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC). However, this phenomenon occurs only in fungi, as mammalian Erg27p orthologues are unable to rescue yeast Erg7p activity. In this study, an erg27 mutant containing the mouse ERG27 orthologue was isolated that was capable of growing without sterol supplementation (FGerg27). GC/MS analysis of this strain showed an accumulation of squalene epoxides, 3-ketosterones, and ergosterol. This strain which was crossed to a wildtype and daughter segregants showed an accumulation of squalene epoxides as well as ergosterol indicating that the mutation entailed a leaky block at ERG7. Upon sequencing the yeast ERG7 gene an A598S alteration was found in a conserved alpha helical region. We theorize that this mutation stabilizes Erg7p in a conformation that mimics Erg27p binding. This mutation, while decreasing OSC activity still retains sufficient residual OSC activity such that the strain in the presence of the mammalian 3-keto reductase enzyme functions and no longer requires the yeast Erg27p. Because sterol biosynthesis occurs in the ER, a fusion protein was synthesized combining Erg7p and Erg28p, a resident ER protein and scaffold of the C-4 demethyation complex. Both FGerg27 and erg27 strains containing this fusion plasmid and the mouse ERG27 orthologue showed restoration of ergosterol biosynthesis with minimal accumulation of squalene epoxides. These results indicate retention of Erg7p in the ER increases its activity and suggest a novel method of regulation of ergosterol biosynthesis.

Abstract: Background
Mood stabilizers used for treating bipolar disorder (BD) selectively downregulate arachidonic acid (AA) turnover (deacylation–reacylation) in brain phospholipids, when given chronically to rats. In vitro studies suggest that one of these, valproic acid (VPA), which is teratogenic, reduces AA turnover by inhibiting the brain long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (Acsl)4 mediated acylation of AA to AA-CoA. We tested whether non-teratogenic VPA analogues might also inhibit Acsl4 catalyzed acylation, and thus have a potential anti-BD action.
Methods
Rat Acsl4-flag protein was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the ability of three VPA analogues, propylisopropylacetic acid (PIA), propylisopropylacetamide (PID) and N-methyl-2,2,3,3-tetramethylcyclopropanecarboxamide (MTMCD), and of sodium butyrate, to inhibit conversion of AA to AA-CoA by Acsl4 was quantified using Michaelis–Menten kinetics.
Results
Acsl4-mediated conversion of AA to AA-CoA in vitro was inhibited uncompetitively by PIA, with a Ki of 11.4mM compared to a published Ki of 25mM for VPA, while PID, MTMCD and sodium butyrate had no inhibitory effect.
Conclusions
PIA's ability to inhibit conversion of AA to AA-CoA by Acsl4 in vitro suggests that, like VPA, PIA may reduce AA turnover in brain phospholipids in unanesthetized rats, and if so, may be effective as a non-teratogenic mood stabilizer in BD patients.

Abstract: Although human MDR1 and MDR3 share 86% similarity in their amino acid sequences and are predicted to share conserved domains for drug recognition, their physiological transport substrates are quite different: MDR1 transports xenobiotics and confers multidrug resistance, while MDR3 exports phosphatidylcholine into bile. Although MDR1 shows high ATPase activity, attempts to demonstrate the ATPase activity of human MDR3 have not succeeded. Therefore, it is possible that the difference in the functions of these proteins is caused by their different ATPase activities. To test this hypothesis, a chimera protein containing the transmembrane domains (TMDs) of MDR1 and the nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) of MDR3 was constructed and analyzed. The chimera protein was expressed on the plasma membrane and conferred resistance against vinblastine and paclitaxel, indicating that MDR3 NBDs can support drug transport. Vanadate-induced ADP trapping of MDR3 NBDs in the chimera protein was stimulated by verapamil as was MDR1 NBDs. The purified chimera protein showed drug-stimulated ATPase activity like MDR1, while its Vmax was more than 10-times lower than MDR1. These results demonstrate that the low ATPase activity of human MDR3 cannot account for the difference in the functions of these proteins, and furthermore, that TMDs determine the features of NBDs. To our knowledge, this is the first study analyzing the features of human MDR3 NBDs.

Abstract: ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) facilitates cholesterol efflux and thereby inhibits lipid-laden macrophage/foam cell formation and atherosclerosis. ABCA1 expression is transcriptionally regulated by activation of liver X receptor (LXR). Both etoposide and teniposide are DNA topoisomerase II (Topo II) inhibitors and are chemotherapeutic medications used in the treatment of various cancers. Interestingly, etoposide inhibits atherosclerosis in rabbits by unclear mechanisms. Herein, we report the effects of etoposide and teniposide on macrophage ABCA1 expression and cholesterol efflux. Both etoposide and teniposide increased macrophage free cholesterol efflux. This increase was associated with increased ABCA1 mRNA and protein expression. Etoposide and teniposide also increased ABCA1 promoter activity in an LXR-dependent manner and formation of the LXRE-LXR/RXR complex indicating that transcriptional induction had occurred. Expression of ABCG1 and fatty acid synthase (FAS), another two LXR-targeted genes, was also induced by etoposide and teniposide. In vivo, administration of mice with either etoposide or teniposide induced macrophage ABCA1 expression and enhanced reverse cholesterol transport from macrophages to feces. Taken together, our study indicates that etoposide and teniposide increase macrophage ABCA1 expression and cholesterol efflux that may be attributed to the anti-atherogenic properties of etoposide. Our study also describes a new function for Topo II inhibitors in addition to their role in anti-tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Aims/hypothesis
Changes in cellular cholesterol level may contribute to beta cell dysfunction. Islets from low density lipoprotein receptor knockout (LDLR−/−) mice have higher cholesterol content and secrete less insulin than wild-type (WT) mice. Here, we investigated the association between cholesterol content, insulin secretion and Ca2+ handling in these islets.
Methods
Isolated islets from both LDLR−/− and WT mice were used for measurements of insulin secretion (radioimmunoassay), cholesterol content (fluorimetric assay), cytosolic Ca2+ level (fura-2AM) and SNARE protein expression (VAMP-2, SNAP-25 and syntaxin-1A). Cholesterol was depleted by incubating the islets with increasing concentrations (0–10mmol/l) of methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MβCD).
Results
The first and second phases of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) were lower in LDLR−/− than in WT islets, paralleled by an impairment of Ca2+ handling in the former. SNAP-25 and VAMP-2, but not syntaxin-1A, were reduced in LDLR−/− compared with WT islets. Removal of excess cholesterol from LDLR−/− islets normalized glucose- and tolbutamide-induced insulin release. Glucose-stimulated Ca2+ handling was also normalized in cholesterol-depleted LDLR−/− islets. Cholesterol removal from WT islets by 0.1 and 1.0mmol/l MβCD impaired both GSIS and Ca2+ handling. In addition, at 10mmol/l MβCD WT islet showed a loss of membrane integrity and higher DNA fragmentation.
Conclusion
Abnormally high (LDLR−/− islets) or low cholesterol content (WT islets treated with MβCD) alters both GSIS and Ca2+ handling. Normalization of cholesterol improves Ca2+ handling and insulin secretion in LDLR−/− islets.

Abstract: We are facing a revival of the strategy to counteract obesity and associated metabolic disorders by inducing thermogenesis mediated by mitochondrial uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1). Thus, the main focus is on the adaptive non-shivering thermogenesis occurring both in the typical depots of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and in UCP1-containing cells that could be induced in white adipose tissue (WAT). Because contribution of WAT to resting metabolic rate is relatively small, the possibility to reduce adiposity by enhancing energy expenditure in classical white adipocytes is largely neglected. However, several pieces of evidence support a notion that induction of energy expenditure based on oxidation of fatty acids (FA) in WAT may be beneficial for health, namely: (i) studies in both humans and rodents document negative association between oxidative capacity of mitochondria in WAT and obesity; (ii) pharmacological activation of AMPK in rats as well as cold-acclimation of UCP1-ablated mice results in obesity resistance associated with increased oxidative capacity in WAT; and (iii) combined intervention using long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated FA (omega 3) and mild calorie restriction exerted synergism in the prevention of obesity in mice fed a high-fat diet; this was associated with strong hypolipidemic and insulin-sensitizing effects, as well as prevention of inflammation, and synergistic induction of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and FA oxidation, specifically in epididymal WAT. Importantly, these changes occurred without induction of UCP1 and suggested the involvement of: (i) futile substrate cycle in white adipocytes, which is based on lipolysis of intracellular triacylglycerols and re-esterification of FA, in association with the induction of mitochondrial OXPHOS capacity, β-oxidation, and energy expenditure; (ii) endogenous lipid mediators (namely endocannabinoids, eicosanoids, prostanoids, resolvins, and protectins) and their cognate receptors; and (iii) AMP-activated protein kinase in WAT. Quantitatively, the strong induction of FA oxidation in WAT in response to the combined intervention is similar to that observed in the transgenic mice rendered resistant to obesity by ectopic expression of UCP1 in WAT. The induction of UCP1-independent FA oxidation and energy expenditure in WAT in response to the above physiological stimuli could underlie the amelioration of obesity and low-grade WAT inflammation, and it could reduce the release of FA from adipose tissue and counteract harmful consequences of lipid accumulation in other tissues. In this respect, new combination treatments may be designed using naturally occurring micronutrients (e.g. omega 3), reduced calorie intake or pharmaceuticals, exerting synergism in the induction of the mitochondrial OXPHOS capacity and stimulation of lipid catabolism in white adipocytes, and improving metabolic flexibility of WAT. The role of mutual interactions between adipocytes and immune cells contained in WAT in tissue metabolism should be better characterised.

Abstract: STARD5 is a member of the STARD4 sub-family of START domain containing proteins specialized in the non-vesicular transport of lipids and sterols. We recently reported that STARD5 binds primary bile acids. Herein, we report on the biophysical and structural characterization of the binding of secondary and conjugated bile acids by STARD5 at physiological concentrations. We found that the absence of the 7α-OH group and its epimerization increase the affinity of secondary bile acids for STARD5. According to NMR titration and molecular modeling, the affinity depends mainly on the number and positions of the steroid ring hydroxyl groups and to a lesser extent on the presence or type of bile acid side-chain conjugation. Primary and secondary bile acids have different binding modes and display different positioning within the STARD5 binding pocket. The relative STARD5 affinity for the different bile acids studied is: DCA>LCA>CDCA>GDCA>TDCA>CA>UDCA. TCA and GCA do not bind significantly to STARD5. The impact of the ligand chemical structure on the thermodynamics of binding is discussed. The discovery of these new ligands suggests that STARD5 is involved in the cellular response elicited by bile acids and offers many entry points to decipher its physiological role.

Abstract: The morphological and functional differences between lipid droplets (LDs) in brown (BAT) and white (WAT) adipose tissues will largely be determined by their associated proteins. Analysing mRNA expression in mice fat depots we have found that most LD protein genes are expressed at higher levels in BAT, with the greatest differences observed for Cidea and Plin5. Prolonged cold exposure, which induces the appearance of brown-like adipocytes in mice WAT depots, was accompanied with the potentiation of the lipolytic machinery, with changes in ATGL, CGI-58 and G0S2 gene expression. However the major change detected in WAT was the enhancement of Cidea mRNA. Together with the increase in Cidec, it indicates that LD enlargement through LD–LD transference of fat is an important process during WAT browning. To study the dynamics of this phenotypic change, we have applied 4D confocal microscopy in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells under sustained β-adrenergic stimulation. Under these conditions the cells experienced a LD remodelling cycle, with progressive reduction on the LD size by lipolysis, followed by the formation of new LDs, which were subjected to an enlargement process, likely to be CIDE-triggered, until the cell returned to the basal state. This transformation would be triggered by the activation of a thermogenic futile cycle of lipolysis/lipogenesis and could facilitate the molecular mechanism for the unilocular to multilocular transformation during WAT browning.

Abstract: Human adults have functionally active BAT. The metabolic function can be reliably measured in vivo using modern imaging modalities (namely PET/CT). Cold seems to be one of the most potent stimulators of BAT metabolic activity but other stimulators (for example insulin) are actively studied. Obesity is related to lower metabolic activity of BAT but it may be reversed after successful weight reduction such as after bariatric surgery.

Abstract: Dietary conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) are fatty acid isomers with anticancer activities produced naturally in ruminants or from vegetable oil processing. The anticancer effects of CLA differ upon the cancer origin and the CLA isomers. In this study, we carried out to precise the effects of CLA isomers, c9,t11 and t10,c12 CLA, on mechanisms of cell death induction in colon cancer cells. We first showed that only t10,c12 CLA treatment (25 and 50μM) for 72h triggered apoptosis in colon cancer cells without affecting viability of normal-derived colon epithelial cells. Exposure of colon cancer cells to t10,c12 CLA activated ER stress characterized by induction of eIF2α phoshorylation, splicing of Xbp1 mRNA and CHOP expression. Furthermore, we evidenced that inhibition of CHOP expression and JNK signaling decreased t10,c12 CLA-mediated cancer cell death. Finally, we showed that CHOP induction by t10,c12 CLA was dependent on ROS production and that the anti-oxidant N-acetyl-cysteine reduced CHOP induction-dependent cell death. These results highlight that t10,c12 CLA exerts its cytotoxic effect through ROS generation and a subsequent ER stress-dependent apoptosis in colon cancer cells.

Abstract: Macrophages are centrally involved during atherosclerosis development and are the predominant cell type that accumulates cholesterol in the plaque. Macrophages however, are heterogeneous in nature reflecting a variety of microenvironments and different phenotypes may be more prone to contribute towards atherosclerosis progression. Using primary human monocyte-derived macrophages, we sought to evaluate one aspect of atherogenic potential of different macrophage phenotypes by determining their propensity to associate with and accumulate oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL). Classically-activated macrophages treated simultaneously with interferon γ (IFNγ) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) associated with less oxLDL and accumulated less cholesterol compared to untreated controls. The combined treatment of IFNγ and TNFα reduced the mRNA expression of CD36 and the expression of both cell surface CD36 and macrophage scavenger receptor 1 (MSR1) protein. Under oxLDL loaded conditions, IFNγ and TNFα did not reduce macrophage protein expression of the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-actived receptor γ (PPARγ) which is known to positively regulate CD36 expression. However, macrophages treated with IFNγ attenuated the ability of the PPARγ-specific agonist rosiglitazone from upregulating cell surface CD36 protein expression. Our results demonstrate that the observed reduction of cholesterol accumulation in macrophages treated with IFNγ and TNFα following oxLDL treatment was due at least in part to reduced cell surface CD36 and MSR1 protein expression.

Abstract: Lipid droplets (LD) are the main depot of non-polar lipids in all eukaryotic cells. In the present study we describe isolation and characterization of LD from the industrial yeast Pichia pastoris. We designed and adapted an isolation procedure which allowed us to obtain this subcellular fraction at high purity as judged by quality control using appropriate marker proteins. Components of P. pastoris LD were characterized by conventional biochemical methods of lipid and protein analysis, but also by a lipidome and proteome approach. Our results show several distinct features of LD from P. pastoris especially in comparison to Saccharomyces cerevisiae. P. pastoris LD are characterized by their high preponderance of triacylglycerols over steryl esters in the core of the organelle, the high degree of fatty acid (poly)unsaturation and the high amount of ergosterol precursors. The high phosphatidylinositol to phosphatidylserine of ~7.5 ratio on the surface membrane of LD is noteworthy. Proteome analysis revealed equipment of the organelle with a small but typical set of proteins which includes enzymes of sterol biosynthesis, fatty acid activation, phosphatidic acid synthesis and non-polar lipid hydrolysis. These results are the basis for a better understanding of P. pastoris lipid metabolism and lipid storage and may be helpful for manipulating cell biological and/or biotechnological processes in this yeast.

Abstract: Coenzyme Qn (ubiquinone or Qn) is a redox active lipid composed of a fully substituted benzoquinone ring and a polyisoprenoid tail of n isoprene units. Saccharomyces cerevisiae coq1–coq9 mutants have defects in Q biosynthesis, lack Q6, are respiratory defective, and sensitive to stress imposed by polyunsaturated fatty acids. The hallmark phenotype of the Q-less yeast coq mutants is that respiration in isolated mitochondria can be rescued by the addition of Q2, a soluble Q analog. Yeast coq10 mutants share each of these phenotypes, with the surprising exception that they continue to produce Q6. Structure determination of the Caulobacter crescentus Coq10 homolog (CC1736) revealed a steroidogenic acute regulatory protein-related lipid transfer (START) domain, a hydrophobic tunnel known to bind specific lipids in other START domain family members. Here we show that purified CC1736 binds Q2, Q3, Q10, or demethoxy-Q3 in an equimolar ratio, but fails to bind 3-farnesyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid, a farnesylated analog of an early Q-intermediate. Over-expression of C. crescentus CC1736 or COQ8 restores respiratory electron transport and antioxidant function of Q6 in the yeast coq10 null mutant. Studies with stable isotope ring precursors of Q reveal that early Q-biosynthetic intermediates accumulate in the coq10 mutant and de novo Q-biosynthesis is less efficient than in the wild-type yeast or rescued coq10 mutant. The results suggest that the Coq10 polypeptide:Q (protein:ligand) complex may serve essential functions in facilitating de novo Q biosynthesis and in delivering newly synthesized Q to one or more complexes of the respiratory electron transport chain.

Abstract: Glioblastoma is the most common malignant primary brain tumour in adults and one of the most lethal of all cancers. Growing evidence suggests that human tumours undergo abnormal lipid metabolism, characterised by an alteration in the mechanisms that regulate cholesterol homeostasis. We have investigated the effect that different antitumoural alkylphospholipids (APLs) exert upon cholesterol metabolism in the U-87 MG glioblastoma cell line. APLs altered cholesterol homeostasis by interfering with its transport from the plasma membrane to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thus hindering its esterification. At the same time they stimulated the synthesis of cholesterol from radiolabelled acetate and its internalisation from low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), inducing both 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) and LDL receptor (LDLR) genes. Fluorescent microscopy revealed that these effects promoted the accumulation of intracellular cholesterol. Filipin staining demonstrated that this accumulation was not confined to the late endosome/lysosome (LE/LY) compartment since it did not colocalise with LAMP2 lysosomal marker. Furthermore, APLs inhibited cell growth, producing arrest at the G2/M phase. We also used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to investigate ultrastructural alterations induced by APLs and found an abundant presence of autophagic vesicles and autolysosomes in treated cells, indicating the induction of autophagy. Thus our findings clearly demonstrate that antitumoural APLs interfere with the proliferation of the glioblastoma cell line via a complex mechanism involving cholesterol metabolism, cell-cycle arrest or autophagy. Knowledge of the interrelationship between these processes is fundamental to our understanding of tumoural response and may facilitate the development of novel therapeutics to improve treatment of glioblastoma and other types of cancer.

Abstract: Efficient storage of dietary and endogenous fatty acids is a prerequisite for a healthy adipose tissue function. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is the master regulator of fatty acid uptake from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. In addition to LPL-mediated fatty acid uptake, adipocytes are able to synthesize fatty acids from non-lipid precursor, a process called de novo lipogenesis (DNL). As the physiological relevance of fatty acid uptake versus DNL for brown and white adipocyte function remains unclear, we studied the role of adipocyte LPL using adipocyte-specific LPL knockout animals (aLKO). ALKO mice displayed a profound increase in DNL-fatty acids, especially palmitoleate and myristoleate in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT) depots while essential dietary fatty acids were markedly decreased. Consequently, we found increased expression in adipose tissues of genes encoding DNL enzymes (Fasn, Scd1, and Elovl6) as well as the lipogenic transcription factor carbohydrate response element binding protein-β. In a high-fat diet (HFD) study aLKO mice were characterized by reduced adiposity and improved plasma insulin and adipokines. However, neither glucose tolerance nor inflammatory markers were ameliorated in aLKO mice compared to controls. No signs of increased BAT activation or WAT browning were detected in aLKO mice either on HFD or after 1week of β3-adrenergic stimulation using CL316,243. We conclude that despite a profound increase in DNL-derived fatty acids, proposed to be metabolically favorable, aLKO mice are not protected from metabolic disease per se. In addition, induction of DNL alone is not sufficient to promote browning of WAT. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Brown and White Fat: From Signaling to Disease.

Abstract: Many breast cancer cells express aberrantly activated receptor tyrosine kinases and are associated with deregulated phosphorylation of Akt (PKB). They are also often associated with a high level of free monounsaturated (MUFA) and saturated (SFA) fatty acids. We studied the effect of DHA and other polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on these anomalies in a human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-453. Inhibitors of the Akt T308 kinase (PDK1) or S473 kinase (mTORC2, DNA-dependent protein kinase and integrin-linked kinase) and combinations of two of them incompletely inhibited, or even enhanced, the phosphorylation in this cell line. In contrast, it was found that DHA as well as other PUFAs inhibited Akt phosphorylation on T308 after 24h. These PUFAs also blocked phosphorylation of S473, although certain omega-6 PUFAs were ineffective. After 48h, only DHA inhibited Akt phosphorylation on the both residues. DHA, and other PUFAs though less efficiently, also elevated the expression of a mitochondrial enzyme, 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase, which catalyzes process necessary for β-oxidation of PUFAs. These PUFAs were present in the cells at high concentrations and reduced the amount of free and phospholipid-bound MUFAs. DHA most efficiently blocked deregulated cell proliferation while the effects of other PUFAs were moderate. These results suggest that DHA suppressed the growth of the cancer cell through its specifically persistent block of Akt phosphorylation in conjunction with modulation of fatty acid metabolism.

Abstract: Heavy isotope-labeled ethanolamine and serine as well as exogenous PE and PS species were used to study trafficking of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and -serine (PS) molecular species between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria in HeLa cells. Import of both endogenous and exogenous PS to IMM was a relatively slow process (T1/2=several hours), but depended on the acyl chains. In particular, the 38:4 and 38:5 species were imported more efficiently compared to the other PS species. Knock-down of Mitofusin 2 or Mitostatin had no detectable effect on PS import to mitochondria, suggesting that the ER–mitochondria contacts regulated by these proteins are not essential. Knock-down of PS synthase 1 inhibited PS decarboxylation, suggesting that import of PS to mitochondria is coupled to its synthesis. Also the export of PE from IMM to microsomes is a relatively slow process, but again depends markedly on the acyl chain structure. Most notably, the polyunsaturated 38:4 and 38:5 PE species were less efficiently exported, which together with rapid import of the PS precursors most probably explains their enrichment in IMM. PE synthesized via the CDP-ethanolamine was also imported to IMM, but most of the PE in this membrane derives from imported PS. In contrast to PS, all PC species made in Golgi/ER translocated similarly and rapidly to IMM. In conclusion, selective translocation of PS species and PS-derived PE species between ER and mitochondria plays a major role in phospholipid homeostasis of these organelles.

Abstract: Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a simple bioactive phospholipid, is present in biological fluids such as plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). It appears to have both pro- and anti-inflammatory roles in inflammatory lung diseases. Exogenous LPA promotes inflammatory responses by regulating the expression of chemokines, cytokines, and cytokine receptors in lung epithelial cells. In addition to the modulation of inflammatory responses, LPA regulates cytoskeleton rearrangement and confers protection against lung injury by enhancing lung epithelial cell barrier integrity and remodeling. The biological effects of LPA are mediated through its cell surface G-protein coupled LPA1–7 receptors. The roles of LPA receptors in lung fibrosis, asthma, and acute lung injury have been investigated using genetically engineered LPA receptor deficient mice and there appears to be a definitive role for endogenous LPA and its receptors in the pathogenesis of pulmonary inflammatory diseases. This review summarizes recent reports on the role of LPA and its receptors in the regulation of lung epithelial inflammatory responses and remodeling. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Advances in Lysophospholipid Research.

Abstract: Sugars are recognized as signaling molecules regulating the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in plants. Here, a modulatory effect of sugars on dolichol and phytosterol profiles was noted in the hairy roots of Arabidopsis thaliana. Arabidopsis roots contain a complex dolichol mixture comprising three groups (‘families’) of dolichols differing in the chain-length. These dolichols, especially the longest ones are accompanied by considerable amounts of polyprenols of the same length. The spectrum of polyisoprenoid alcohols, i.e. dolichols and polyprenols, was dependent on sugar type (glucose or sucrose) and its concentration in the medium. Among the long-chain dolichols Dol/Pren-20 (dolichol or prenol molecule composed of 20 isoprene residues) and Dol/Pren-23 were the main components at 0.5% and 2% glucose, respectively. Moreover, the ratio of polyprenols versus respective dolichols was also modulated by sugar in this group of polyisoprenoids, with polyprenols dominating at 3% sucrose and dolichols at 2% glucose. Glucose concentration affected the expression level of genes encoding cis-prenyltransferases, enzymes responsible for elongation of the polyisoprenoid chain. The most abundant phytosterols of the A. thaliana roots, β-sitosterol, stigmasterol and campesterol, were accompanied by corresponding stanols and traces of brassicasterol, stigmast-4,22-dien-3-one and stigmast-4-en-3-one. Similar to the polyisoprenoids, sterol profile responded to the sugar present in the medium, β-sitosterol dominating in roots grown on 3% or lower glucose concentrations and stigmasterol in 3% sucrose. These results indicate an involvement of sugar signaling in the regulation of cis-prenyltransferases and phytosterol pathway enzymes.

Abstract: μ-Calpain is a calcium-dependent cysteine protease, which is activated by μM concentration of calcium in vitro. Disrupted intracellular calcium homeostasis leads to hyper-activation of μ-calpain. Hyper-activated μ-calpain enhances the accumulation of β-amyloid peptide by increasing the expression level of β-secretase (BACE1) and induces hyper-phosphorylation of tau along with the formation of neurofibrillary tangle by mediating p35 cleavage into p25, both of which are the major mechanisms of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hence, inhibition of μ-calpain activity is very important in the treatment and prevention of AD. In this study, conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), an eighteen-carbon unsaturated fatty acid, was discovered as a μ-calpain-specific inhibitor. CLA showed neuroprotective effects against neurotoxins such as H2O2 and Aβ1–42 in SH-SY5Y cells, and inhibited Aβ oligomerization/fibrillation and Aβ-induced Zona Occludens-1 degradation. In addition, CLA decreased the levels of proapoptotic proteins, p35 conversion to p25 and tau phosphorylation. These findings implicate CLA as a new core structure for selective μ-calpain inhibitors with neuroprotective effects. CLA should be further evaluated for its potential use as an AD therapeutic agent.

Abstract: Phospholipids are not only major building blocks of biological membranes but fulfill a wide range of critical functions that are often widely unrecognized. In this review, we focus on phosphatidylethanolamine, a major glycerophospholipid class in eukaryotes and bacteria, which is involved in many unexpected biological processes. We describe (i) the ins, i.e. the substrate sources and biochemical reactions involved in phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis, and (ii) the outs, i.e. the different roles of phosphatidylethanolamine and its involvement in various cellular events. We discuss how the protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma brucei, has contributed and may contribute in the future as eukaryotic model organism to our understanding of phosphatidylethanolamine homeostasis. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Phospholipids and Phospholipid Metabolism.
