Abstract: Summary
Study of evolution and selection pressure on HIV-1 in fetuses will lead to a better understanding of the role of immune responses in shaping virus evolution and vertical transmission. Detailed genetic analyses of HIV-1 env gene from 12 in utero transmission pairs show that most infections (67%) occur within 2 months of childbirth. In addition, the env sequences from long-term-infected fetuses are highly divergent and form separate phylogenetic lineages from their cognate maternal viruses. Host-selection sites unique to neonate viruses are identified in regions frequently targeted by neutralizing antibodies and T cell immune responses. Identification of unique selection sites in the env gene of fetal viruses indicates that the immune system in fetuses is capable of exerting selection pressure on viral evolution. Studying selection and evolution of HIV-1 or other viruses in fetuses can be an alternative approach to investigate adaptive immunity in fetuses.

Abstract: Summary
Ending the COVID-19 pandemic will require long-lived immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Here, we evaluate 254 COVID-19 patients longitudinally up to 8 months and find durable broad-based immune responses. SARS-CoV-2 spike binding and neutralizing antibodies exhibit a bi-phasic decay with an extended half-life of >200 days suggesting the generation of longer-lived plasma cells. SARS-CoV-2 infection also boosts antibody titers to SARS-CoV-1 and common betacoronaviruses. In addition, spike-specific IgG+ memory B cells persist, which bodes well for a rapid antibody response upon virus re-exposure or vaccination. Virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are polyfunctional and maintained with an estimated half-life of 200 days. Interestingly, CD4+ T cell responses equally target several SARS-CoV-2 proteins, whereas the CD8+ T cell responses preferentially target the nucleoprotein, highlighting the potential importance of including the nucleoprotein in future vaccines. Taken together, these results suggest that broad and effective immunity may persist long-term in recovered COVID-19 patients.

Abstract: Salinity fluctuations have severe impacts on sea cucumbers and therefore important consequences in sea cucumber farming. The responses of sea cucumbers to salinity changes are reflected in the expression profiles of multiple genes and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). The microRNA (let-7) which is a developmental regulator, the ion transporter gene sodium potassium ATPase gene (NKAα), and the long ncRNA lncRNA001074 were previously shown to be involved in responses to salinity changes in various marine species. To better understand the relationship between ncRNAs and target genes, the let-7/NKAα/lncRNA001074 predicted interaction was investigated in this study using luciferase reporter assays and gene knockdowns in the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus. The results showed that NKAα was the target gene of let-7 and NKAα expression levels were inversely correlated with let-7 expression based on the luciferase reporter assays and western blots. The let-7 abundance was negatively regulated by lncRNA001074 and NKAα both in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of lncRNA001074 led to let-7 overexpression. These results demonstrated that lncRNA001074 binds to the 3′-UTR binding site of let-7 in a regulatory manner. Furthermore, the expression profiles of let-7, NKAα, and lncRNA001074 were analyzed in sea cucumbers after the knockdown of each of these genes. The results found that lncRNA001074 competitively bound let-7 to suppress NKAα expression under low salinity conditions. The downregulation of let-7, in conjunction with the upregulation of lncRNA001074 and NKAα, may be essential for the response to low salinity change in sea cucumbers. Therefore, the dynamic balance of the lncRNA001074, NKAα, and let-7 network might be a potential response mechanism to salinity change in sea cucumbers.

Abstract: Summary
There is widespread interest in facile methods for generating potent neutralizing antibodies, nanobodies, and other affinity proteins against SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses to address current and future pandemics. While isolating antibodies from animals and humans are proven approaches, these methods are limited to the affinities, specificities, and functional activities of antibodies generated by the immune system. Here we report a surprisingly simple directed evolution method for generating nanobodies with high affinities and neutralization activities against SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrate that complementarity-determining region swapping between low-affinity lead nanobodies, which we discovered unintentionally but find is simple to implement systematically, results in matured nanobodies with unusually large increases in affinity. Importantly, the matured nanobodies potently neutralize both SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and live virus, and possess drug-like biophysical properties. We expect that our methods will improve in vitro nanobody discovery and accelerate the generation of potent neutralizing nanobodies against diverse coronaviruses.

Abstract: ZMYND8, an epigenetic regulator, was identified as a common oncogene across various tumors. However, little was reported about the association between ZMYND8 and bladder cancer. Besides, aberrant mechanisms that contribute to abnormal ZMYND8 expressions still remain unclear. In the current study, we first found that ZMYND8 protein levels were significantly elevated in Bca samples versus normal tissues, but not the mRNA levels. We then utilized the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, clone formation assay and transwell analysis to confirm that ZMYND8 could remarkably promote the tumor progression in vitro, including growth capacity and migration. Bioinformatic predictive analysis revealed that E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXW7 interacts directly with ZMYND8 and degrades ZMYND8 in a polyubiquitination manner. Low FBXW7 was a hazard factor for promoting and depending on accumulated ZMYND8 proteins to promote Bca progression. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) further indicated that ZMYND8 was notably associated with stemness process, which was well functionally validated. Lastly, ZMYND8 deficiency was observed to inhibit tumor growth of Bca in vivo, revealing a promising translational significance in Bca treatment. In conclusion, our study for the first time provided evidence for a novel mechanism of FBXW7/ZMYND8 axis in Bca, providing therapeutic vulnerability for individualized cancer treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Anelloviruses are a ubiquitous component of healthy human viromes and remain highly prevalent after being acquired early in life. The full extent of “anellome” diversity and its evolutionary dynamics remain unexplored. We employed in-depth sequencing of blood-transfusion donor(s)-recipient pairs coupled with public genomic resources for a large-scale assembly of anellovirus genomes and used the data to characterize global and personal anellovirus diversity through time. The breadth of the anellome is much greater than previously appreciated, and individuals harbor unique anellomes and transmit lineages that can persist for several months within a diverse milieu of endemic host lineages. Anellovirus sequence diversity is shaped by extensive recombination at all levels of divergence, hindering traditional phylogenetic analyses. Our findings illuminate the transmission dynamics and vast diversity of anelloviruses and set the foundation for future studies to characterize their biology.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic loss and gain of function in mice have typically been studied by using knockout or knockin mice that take months to years to generate. To address this problem for the nervous system, we developed NEPTUNE (NEural Plate Targeting by in Utero NanoinjEction) to rapidly and flexibly transduce the neural plate with virus prior to neurulation, and thus manipulate the future nervous system. Stable integration in >95% of cells in the brain enabled long-term overexpression, and conditional expression was achieved by using cell-type-specific MiniPromoters. Knockdown of Olig2 by using NEPTUNE recapitulated the phenotype of Olig2−/− embryos. We used NEPTUNE to investigate Sptbn2, mutations in which cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 5. Sptbn2 knockdown induced dose-dependent defects in the neural tube, embryonic turning, and abdominal wall closure, previously unreported functions for Sptbn2. NEPTUNE thus offers a rapid and cost-effective technique to test gene function in the nervous system and can reveal phenotypes incompatible with life.

Abstract: Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) is an adverse effect for liver transplantation which is characterized by immune response mediated inflammation. Recent studies report that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are implicated in hepatic IRI. The aim of this study was to explore the mechanism of action of tetramethylpyrazine (TMP), the main chemical composition of Ligusticum chuanxiong in treatment of ischemic related diseases. Data showed that hepatic IRI increases the leak of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), and stimulates formation of NETs. Extracellular DNA/NETs assay, hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, immunofluorescence assay, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) and Western blot assay, showed that TMP significantly reduces formation of NETs and alleviates hepatic IRI. Moreover, TMP and Diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) suppressed ROS production in neutrophils. In addition, analysis showed that activation of NADPH oxidase plays a role in formation of NETs triggered by hepatic IRI. Notably, TMP inhibited formation of NETs though inhibition of NADPH oxidase. Additionally, Combination treatment using TMP and DPI was more effective compared with monotherapy of either of the two drugs. These findings show that combination therapy using TMP and DPI is a promising method for treatment hepatic IRI.

Abstract: We determined the role of time in adipose-derived stem/stromal cell (ASC) response to a model inflammatory environment. ASCs and other mesenchymal stem/stromal cells exhibit immune plasticity. We evaluated the persistence of pro- and anti-inflammatory phenotypes for ASCs exposed to a sustained or pulse inflammatory stimulus. Using qPCR, flow cytometry, and immunocytochemistry, we monitored the temporal expression and up-regulation patterns of a pro-inflammatory gene (caspase 1), a pleiotropic gene/protein (interleukin 6, IL-6), and an anti-inflammatory gene/protein (indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase, IDO1) after exposing ASCs to the cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ. In response to sustained cytokine stimulation, we discovered that time played a role in the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory ASC phenotypes. IL-6 was present at all time points for both cytokine-stimulated and non-stimulated conditions, whereas IDO1 was heterogeneously up-regulated in stimulated conditions at later time points. After a pulse stimulus, ASC immunoresponse remained consistent for 96–168 h. As a final measure of immune plasticity, we cultured cytokine-stimulated ASCs with blood-derived macrophages to observe macrophage polarization. While the presence of ASCs altered macrophage phenotype, there was no dependency on the length of ASC cytokine exposure time.

Abstract: Summary
Stem cell transplantation shows enormous potential for treatment of incurable retinal degeneration (RD). To determine if and how grafts connect with the neural circuits of the advanced degenerative retina (ADR) and improve vision, we perform calcium imaging of GCaMP5-positive grafts in retinal slices. The organoid-derived C-Kit+/SSEA1− (C-Kit+) retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) become synaptically organized and build spontaneously active synaptic networks in three major layers of ADR. Light stimulation of the host photoreceptors elicits distinct neuronal responses throughout the graft RPCs. The graft RPCs and their differentiated offspring cells in inner nuclear layer synchronize their activities with the host cells and exhibit presynaptic calcium flux patterns that resemble intact retinal neurons. Once graft-to-host network is established, progressive vision loss is stabilized while control eyes continually lose vision. Therefore, transplantation of organoid-derived C-Kit+ RPCs can form functional synaptic networks within ADR and it holds promising avenue for advanced RD treatment.

Abstract: MCL1 is an anti-apoptotic BCL2 family member that is often overexpressed in various malignant tumors. However, few reports have described the role of MCL1 in squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) derived from airways including the lung. In this study, we examined whether MCL1 could be a novel druggable target for airway-derived SqCC, for which effective molecular targeted drugs are unavailable. We searched the Kaplan–Meier Plotter database and found that high MCL1 mRNA expression was significantly associated with shorter survival in patients with lower airway (lung) or upper airway (head and neck) derived SqCC. We also explored the Expression Atlas database and learned that authentic lung SqCC cell lines expressing both TP63 and KRT5 mRNA were extremely sparse among the publicly available “lung SqCC cell lines”, with an exception being HARA cells. HARA cells were highly dependent on MCL1 for survival, and MCL1-depleted cells were not able to grow, and even declined in number, upon docetaxel (DTX) exposure in vitro and in vivo. Similar in vitro experimental findings, including those in a 3D culture model, were also obtained using Detroit 562 pharyngeal SqCC cells. These findings suggested that combined treatment with MCL1 silencing plus DTX appears highly effective against airway-derived SqCC.

Abstract: The mammalian placenta consists of a set of cells to ensure normal placental functions throughout gestation. Dysfunctional placentae are considered as the origin of a series of pregnancy complications. Therefore, it is urgent for detailed information about the molecular recipes of the cell types within the normal placenta. In the past years, gene expression analysis via single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) offers opportunities to identify new cell types in a variety of organs and tissues. In this study, scRNA-seq was used to explore the cell heterogeneity within the E10.5 mouse placenta and unravel their discrepancies in cell composition and communications. We identified sixteen cell clusters, including some cell clusters that originated from the maternal tissue. Moreover, we traced the developmental trajectories of trophoblasts and Hofbauer-like cells. Further analysis revealed cell connections between the endothelial cells and pericytes, syncytiotrophoblasts, as well as decidual cells. Besides, we highlighted several signaling pathways, such as the EGF, FGF, canonical, and non-canonical WNT signaling pathways, which mediated the potential crosstalk between different cell types within placenta. Our research provides an in-depth understanding of placental development, cellular composition, and communications at the maternal-fetal interface.

Abstract: Thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAAD) is a life-threatening vascular disease with no effective pharmaceutical therapies currently available. Inflammation plays a key role in the progression of aneurysms. Dexamethasone (DEX), a synthetic glucocorticoid, has showed alleviating effects on cells in vitro from TAAD patients. Here we performed a study aiming at investigating the protective role of DEX in a β-aminopropionitrile monofumarate (BAPN)-induced TAAD mouse model. DEX (dose: 0.04 mg/kg/day) treatment significantly reduced the aortic diameter and inhibited TAAD formation. DEX reduced infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils, apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), expression of metalloproteinase 2/9, and extracellular matrix degradation in BAPN-treated TAAD mice. Furthermore, DEX therapy downregulated the expression of p-p65 in macrophages and VSMCs, which suggested that DEX might ameliorate BAPN-induced TAAD by suppressing NF-κB signaling. Therefore, DEX therapy attenuates the progression of BAPN-induced TAAD murine model and could be used as an effective adjuvant therapy for treating TAAD.

Abstract: Summary
Designing covalent inhibitors is increasingly important, although it remains challenging. Here, we present covalentizer, a computational pipeline for identifying irreversible inhibitors based on structures of targets with non-covalent binders. Through covalent docking of tailored focused libraries, we identify candidates that can bind covalently to a nearby cysteine while preserving the interactions of the original molecule. We found ∼11,000 cysteines proximal to a ligand across 8,386 complexes in the PDB. Of these, the protocol identified 1,553 structures with covalent predictions. In a prospective evaluation, five out of nine predicted covalent kinase inhibitors showed half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values between 155 nM and 4.5 μM. Application against an existing SARS-CoV Mpro reversible inhibitor led to an acrylamide inhibitor series with low micromolar IC50 values against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The docking was validated by 12 co-crystal structures. Together these examples hint at the vast number of covalent inhibitors accessible through our protocol.

Abstract: Cancer cells rely on heat shock proteins (HSPs) for growth and survival. Especially HSP90 has multiple client proteins and plays a critical role in malignant transformation, and therefore different types of HSP90 inhibitors are being developed. The bioactive natural compound gambogic acid (GB) is a prenylated xanthone with antitumor activity, and it has been proposed to function as an HSP90 inhibitor. However, there are contradicting reports whether GB induces a heat shock response (HSR), which is cytoprotective for cancer cells and therefore a potentially problematic feature for an anticancer drug. In this study, we show that GB and a structurally related compound, called gambogenic acid (GBA), induce a robust HSR, in a thiol-dependent manner. Using heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) or HSF2 knockout cells, we show that the GB or GBA-induced HSR is HSF1-dependent. Intriguingly, using closed form ATP-bound HSP90 mutants that can be co-precipitated with HSF1, a known facilitator of cancer, we show that also endogenous HSF2 co-precipitates with HSP90. GB and GBA treatment disrupt the interaction between HSP90 and HSF1 and HSP90 and HSF2. Our study implies that these compounds should be used cautiously if developed for cancer therapies, since GB and its derivative GBA are strong inducers of the HSR, in multiple cell types, by involving the dissociation of a HSP90-HSF1/HSF2 complex.

Abstract: Summary
Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), the most abundant white blood cells, are recruited rapidly to sites of infection to exert potent anti-microbial activity. Information regarding their role in infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is limited. Here we report that addition of PMNs to HIV-infected cultures of human tonsil tissue or peripheral blood mononuclear cells causes immediate and long-lasting suppression of HIV-1 spread and virus-induced depletion of CD4 T cells. This inhibition of HIV-1 spread strictly requires PMN contact with infected cells and is not mediated by soluble factors. 2-Photon (2PM) imaging visualized contacts of PMNs with HIV-1-infected CD4 T cells in tonsil tissue that do not result in lysis or uptake of infected cells. The anti-HIV activity of PMNs also does not involve degranulation, formation of neutrophil extracellular traps, or integrin-dependent cell communication. These results reveal that PMNs efficiently blunt HIV-1 replication in primary target cells and tissue by an unconventional mechanism.

Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived pancreatic progenitors (PPs) provide promising cell therapies for type 1 diabetes. Current PP differentiation requires a high amount of Activin A during the definitive endoderm (DE) stage, making it economically difficult for commercial ventures. Here we identify a dose-dependent role for Wnt signaling in controlling DE differentiation without Activin A. While high-level Wnt activation induces mesodermal formation, low-level Wnt activation by a small-molecule inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase 3 is sufficient for DE differentiation, yielding SOX17+FOXA2+ DE cells. BMP inhibition further enhances this DE differentiation, generating over 87% DE cells. These DE cells could be further differentiated into PPs and functional β cells. RNA-sequencing analysis of PP differentiation from hPSCs revealed expected transcriptome dynamics and new gene regulators during our small-molecule PP differentiation protocol. Overall, we established a robust growth-factor-free protocol for generating DE and PP cells, facilitating scalable production of pancreatic cells for regenerative applications.

Abstract: Summary
Endometrial cancer (EC) is one of the most common gynecological cancers worldwide. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) status could be a major prognostic factor in evaluation of EC, but several prospective studies need to be performed. Here we report an in-depth proteomics analysis showing significant variations in the SLN protein landscape in EC. We show that SLNs are correlated to each tumor grade, which strengthens evidence of SLN involvement in EC. A few proteins are overexpressed specifically at each EC tumor grade and in the corresponding SLN. These proteins, which are significantly variable in both locations, should be considered potential markers of overall survival. Five major proteins for EC and SLN (PRSS3, PTX3, ASS1, ALDH2, and ANXA1) were identified in large-scale proteomics and validated by immunohistochemistry. This study improves stratification and diagnosis of individuals with EC as a result of proteomics profiling of SLNs.

Abstract: Aberrant activation of Hedgehog-Gli1 signaling and accumulation of Gli1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are frequently observed. However, the mechanisms leading to the overactivation of this signaling pathway are not fully understood. In this study, we show that the short isoform of PHD finger protein 19 (PHF19) interacts with β-TrCP, the E3 ligase of Gli1, and that knocking down PHF19 promotes the ubiquitination of Gli1. In a biological function study, PHF19 was found to promote the growth of HCC cells both in liquid culture and in soft agar. Moreover, knocking out PHF19 in a HCC mouse model (MycF/F) using the hydrodynamic method inhibited tumorigenesis and improved survival. Taken together, these results demonstrate that PHF19 promotes the growth of HCC cells by activating the Hedgehog signaling pathway.

Differential localization patterns of pyruvate kinase isoforms in murine naïve, formative, and primed pluripotent states,

Abstract: Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and mouse epiblast stem cells (mEpiSCs) represent opposite ends of the pluripotency continuum, referred to as naïve and primed pluripotent states, respectively. These divergent pluripotent states differ in several ways, including growth factor requirements, transcription factor expression, DNA methylation patterns, and metabolic profiles. Naïve cells employ both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), whereas primed cells preferentially utilize aerobic glycolysis, a trait shared with cancer cells referred to as the Warburg Effect. Until recently, metabolism has been regarded as a by-product of cell fate, however, evidence now supports metabolism as being a driver of stem cell state and fate decisions. Pyruvate kinase muscle isoforms (PKM1 and PKM2) are important for generating and maintaining pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) and mediating the Warburg Effect. Both isoforms catalyze the final, rate limiting step of glycolysis, generating adenosine triphosphate and pyruvate, however, the precise role(s) of PKM1/2 in naïve and primed pluripotency is not well understood. The primary objective of this study was to characterize the cellular expression and localization patterns of PKM1 and PKM2 in mESCs, chemically transitioned epiblast-like cells (mEpiLCs) representing formative pluripotency, and mEpiSCs using immunoblotting and confocal microscopy. The results indicate that PKM1 and PKM2 are not only localized to the cytoplasm, but also accumulate in differential subnuclear regions of mESC, mEpiLCs, and mEpiSCs as determined by a quantitative confocal microscopy employing orthogonal projections and airyscan processing. Importantly, we discovered that the subnuclear localization of PKM1/2 changes during the transition from mESCs, mEpiLCs, and mEpiSCs. Finally, we have comprehensively validated the appropriateness and power of the Pearson's correlation coefficient and Manders's overlap coefficient for assessing nuclear and cytoplasmic protein colocalization in PSCs by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. We propose that nuclear PKM1/2 may assist with distinct pluripotency state maintenance and lineage priming by non-canonical mechanisms. These results advance our understanding of the overall mechanisms controlling naïve, formative, and primed pluripotency.

Abstract: Sorafenib is a multi-kinase inhibitor that has been highlighted as a tumor suppressor due to its anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic properties, whereas the clinical application of Sorafenib is restricted by the side effects it may cause. The past decade has witnessed the development of a series of sorafenib derivatives to improve the clinical performance of sorafenib. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been widely utilized in drug delivery systems due to their unique properties, including biocompatible nature, simple preparation, and easy surface modification. Herein, this study is aimed to investigate the anti-tumor effects of new sorafenib derivatives-capped gold nanoparticles (AuNPs-New Sor) in tumor formation and metastasis as well as the underlying mechanisms. Initially, new sorafenib derivatives were constructed and combined with AuNPs to form AuNPs-New Sor, and the properties of synthesized AuNPs-New Sor were identified in a mouse model of tumorigenesis. The effect of AuNPs-New Sor on tumor vascular normalization was investigated by assessing vascular permeability and perfusion rate. Next, we evaluated the effect of AuNPs-New Sor on migration and viability of tumor cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as well as on HUVEC angiogenesis in vitro. A melanoma mouse model was further established for in vivo substantiation of the anti-tumor effect of AuNPs-New Sor. According to the results, AuNPs could deliver new sorafenib derivatives into tumor tissues and downregulate the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2), thereby suppressing tumor migration, EMT, and angiogenesis in vitro. In addition, AuNPs-New Sor displayed competitive anti-tumor activities in vivo. Taken together, AuNPs-New Sor may attenuate tumor development and angiogenesis through downregulation of EGFR and VEGFR-2.

Abstract: In our privious work, our reseach group characterized a population of hepatic-sourced mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) called MLpvNG2+ cells. In the present study, we compared the biological and functional characteristics of naïve MLpvNG2 cells with identical bone marrow-derived MSCs (niBM-MSCs) using in vitro (conditioned media) and in vivo (a well-set diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced liver fibrotic/cirrhotic murine model) procedures. The intrahepatic-sourced mesodermal MLpvNG2+ cells exhibited some biological characteristics (e.g., a set of surface markers) similar to those of extrahepatic niBM-MSCs. In responsed to signals of pathological conditions, such as singals of fibrotic/cirrhotic liver, MLpvNG2+ cells showed higher survival and favored differentiation into ALB(+) and G6Pc(+) hepatocytes, whereas niBM-MSCs predominantly differentiated into CK/KRT19(+) cholangiocytes. We identified C/EBPα/β expression as a biological characteristic differentiating these two populations of MSCs, wherein MLpvNG2+ cells are likely regulated by C/EBPβ transcriptional signaling, whereas niBM-MSCs are likely controlled by C/EBPα transcriptional signaling. Notably, although C/EBPα and C/EBPβ transcriptional signaling regulate hepatocyte and cholangiocyte fate, respectively, the expression of these proteins in MLpvNG2+ cells is, to our knowledge, reported for the first time in the present study. We used anti-C/EBP neutralizing antibodies (Abs) both in vitro and in vivo to determine the functional characteristics of these proteins. We conclude that the biological characteristics of these two populations of MSCs depend on their differential C/EBPα/β expression patterns.

Abstract: Gliomas are the most common and fatal primary brain tumors. Growing evidence suggests that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) constitute novel and potential therapeutic targets for glioma. However, the biological role of glioblastoma down-regulated RNA (GLIDR) in glioma remains largely elusive. In the current study, we used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to detect GLIDR expression in glioma cells. Cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8) assay, colony formation assay, JC-1 staining, and flow cytometry were used to evaluate the role of GLIDR in proliferation and apoptosis of glioma cells. Western blotting was performed to assess the effect of GLIDR on the level of apoptosis-related proteins. In addition, bioinformatics prediction, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), RNA pull-down, and luciferase reporter gene assays were used to study the regulatory mechanisms of GLIDR in glioma. GLIDR was found to be highly expressed in glioma cells and silencing of GLIDR inhibited cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis. Functionally, GLIDR bound to miR-4677-3p that directly targeted membrane-associated guanylate kinase, WW, and PDZ domain-containing protein 2 (MAGI2). Our data showed that GLIDR affects the proliferation and apoptosis of glioma cells by targeting miR-4677-3p to regulate the expression of MAGI2. In conclusion, our study determined the oncogenic role of GLIDR in glioma, which may provide a new perspective for the treatment of glioma.

Abstract: Summary
Most small molecules interact with several target proteins but this polypharmacology is seldom comprehensively investigated or explicitly exploited during drug discovery. Here, we use computational and experimental methods to identify and systematically characterize the kinase cross-pharmacology of representative HSP90 inhibitors. We demonstrate that the resorcinol clinical candidates ganetespib and, to a lesser extent, luminespib, display unique off-target kinase pharmacology as compared with other HSP90 inhibitors. We also demonstrate that polypharmacology evolved during the optimization to discover luminespib and that the hit, leads, and clinical candidate all have different polypharmacological profiles. We therefore recommend the computational and experimental characterization of polypharmacology earlier in drug discovery projects to unlock new multi-target drug design opportunities.

Abstract: Summary
Intracellular bacterial pathogens inject effector proteins to hijack host cellular processes and promote their survival and proliferation. To systematically map effector-host protein-protein interactions (PPIs) during infection, we generated a library of 32 Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (STm) strains expressing chromosomally encoded affinity-tagged effectors and quantified PPIs in macrophages and epithelial cells. We identified 446 effector-host PPIs, 25 of which were previously described, and validated 13 by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation. While effectors converged on the same host cellular processes, most had multiple targets, which often differed between cell types. We demonstrate that SseJ, SseL, and SifA modulate cholesterol accumulation at the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV) partially via the cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1 protein. PipB recruits the organelle contact site protein PDZD8 to the SCV, and SteC promotes actin bundling by phosphorylating formin-like proteins. This study provides a method for probing host-pathogen PPIs during infection and a resource for interrogating STm effector mechanisms.

Abstract: Checkpoint kinases (Chk) 1/2 are known for DNA damage checkpoint and cell cycle control in somatic cells. According to recent findings, the involvement of Chk1 in oocyte meiotic resumption and Chk2 is regarded as an essential regulator for progression at the post metaphase I stage (MI). In this study, AZD7762 (Chk1/2 inhibitor) and SB218078 (Chk1 inhibitor) were used to uncover the joint roles of Chk1/2 and differentiate the importance of Chk1 and Chk2 during oocyte meiotic maturation. Inhibition of Chk1/2 or Chk1 alone had no significant effect on germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) but significantly inhibited the first polar body (PB1). Interestingly, inhibition of Chk1 alone could not increase or completely block the extrusion of PB1 like Chk1/2 inhibition. Also, Chk1/2 inhibition resulted in defective meiotic spindle organization and chromosome condensation both in MI and metaphase II (MII) stages of oocytes. The location of γ-tubulin and Securin were abnormal or missing, while P38 MAPK was activated by Chk1/2 inhibition. Meanwhile, Chk1/2 inhibition reduced the percentage of the second polar body extrusion and pronuclear formation. In conclusion, our results further understand the functions and regulatory mechanism of Chk1/2 during oocyte meiotic maturation.

Abstract: Summary
Animal microbiomes are assembled predominantly from environmental microbes, yet the mechanisms by which individual symbionts regulate their transmission into hosts remain underexplored. By tracking the experimental evolution of Aeromonas veronii in gnotobiotic zebrafish, we identify bacterial traits promoting host colonization. Multiple independently evolved isolates with increased immigration harbored mutations in a gene we named sensor of proline diguanylate cyclase enzyme (SpdE) based on structural, biochemical, and phenotypic evidence that SpdE encodes an amino-acid-sensing diguanylate cyclase. SpdE detects free proline and to a lesser extent valine and isoleucine, resulting in reduced production of intracellular c-di-GMP, a second messenger controlling bacterial motility. Indeed, SpdE binding to amino acids increased bacterial motility and host colonization. Hosts serve as sources of SpdE-detected amino acids, with levels varying based on microbial colonization status. Our work demonstrates that bacteria use chemically regulated motility, or chemokinesis, to sense host-emitted cues that trigger active immigration into hosts.

Abstract: Background
Glycolysis reprogramming is deeply involved in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), in which HCC cells with stemness traits play important roles as well. Thus, whether platelet isoform of phosphofructokinase 1 (PFKP), a rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis, contributes to the maintenance of stemness of HCC cells is worth investigation.
Methods
PFKP levels were compared between human hepatocellular carcinoma and adjacent normal tissues by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The relationship between PFKP expression and clinic pathological features was also analyzed. Furthermore, the colony formation capabilities and the levels of stemness markers (ALDH1, CD44, CD133, Sox-2) as well as β-catenin were compared between HCC cells either undergoing PFKP silencing or overexpression.
Results
PFKP levels were higher in HCC as compared to normal hepatic tissues. Silencing PFKP decreased HCC proliferation, colony formation capabilities, and levels of stemness markers and β-catenin; whereas overexpressing PFKP demonstrated the opposite effects.
Conclusion
PFKP promoted HCC proliferation and contributed to the maintenance of HCC stemness. Silencing PFKP could restrain the stemness of HCC, suggesting that PFKP may be a potential therapeutic target for HCC treatment.

Abstract: The Gulf of the Maine (GoM) is one of the fastest warming bodies of water in the world, posing serious physiological challenges to its marine inhabitants. Marine organisms can cope with the cellular and molecular stresses created by climate change through changes in gene expression. We used transcriptomics to examine how exposure to current summer temperatures (16 °C) or temperature regimes reflective of projected moderate and severe warming conditions (18°C and 22 °C, respectively) during larval development alters expression of transcripts affiliated with the cellular stress response (CSR) in postlarval American lobsters (Homarus americanus). We identified 26 significantly differentially expressed (DE) transcripts annotated to CSR proteins. Specifically, transcripts for proteins affiliated with heat shock, the ubiquitin family, DNA repair, and apoptosis were significantly over-expressed in lobsters reared at higher temperatures relative to current conditions. Substantial variation in the CSR expression between postlarvae reared at 18°C and those reared at 22°C suggests that postlarvae reared under severe warming may have a hindered ability to cope with the physiological and molecular challenges of ocean warming. These results highlight that postlarval American lobsters may experience significant heat stress as rapid warming in the GoM continues, potentially compromising their ability to prevent cellular damage and inhibiting the reallocation of cellular energy towards other physiological functions beyond activation of the CSR. Moreover, this study establishes additional American lobster stress markers and addresses various knowledge gaps in crustacean biology, where sufficient ‘omics research is lacking.

Abstract: Summary
This is a phase Ib/II study of regorafenib plus toripalimab for colorectal cancer. The objective response rate (ORR) is 15.2% and the disease control rate is 36.4% in evaluable patients with recommended phase II dose (80 mg regorafenib plus toripalimab). The median progression-free survival (PFS) and the median overall survival are 2.1 months and 15.5 months, respectively. Patients with liver metastases have lower ORR than those without (8.7% versus 30.0%). All patients (3/3) with lung-only metastasis respond, whereas no patients (0/4) with liver-only metastasis respond. 94.9% and 38.5% of patients have grade 1 and grade 3 treatment-related adverse events, respectively. Gut microbiome analysis of the baseline fecal samples shows significantly increased relative abundance and positive detection rate of Fusobacterium in non-responders than responders. Patients with high-abundance Fusobacterium have shorter PFS than those with low abundance (median PFS = 2.0 versus 5.2 months; p = 0.002).

Abstract: Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) deleted on human chromosome 10 is a tumor suppressor with bispecific phosphatase activity, which is often involved in the study of energy metabolism and tumorigenesis. PTEN is recently reported to participate in the process of acute injury. However, the mechanism of PTEN in Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury (IRI) has not yet been clearly elucidated. In this study, mice with bilateral renal artery ischemia-reperfusion and HK-2 cells with hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) were used as acute kidney injury models. We demonstrated that PTEN was downregulated in IRI-induced kidney as well as in H/R-induced HK-2 cells. By silencing and overexpressing PTEN with si-PTEN RNA and PHBLV-CMV-PTEN-flag lentivirus before H/R, we found that PTEN protected HK-2 cells against H/R-induced injury reflected by the change in cell activity and the release of LDH. Furthermore, we inhibited HIF1-α with PX-478 and inactivated mTOR with Rapamycin before the silence of PTEN in H/R model. Our data indicated that the renoprotective effect of PTEN worked via PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and PI3K/Akt/HIF1-α pathway, hence alleviating apoptosis and improving autophagy respectively. Our findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanism underlying renoprotection of PTEN on autophagy and apoptosis induced by renal IRI, which offers a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of AKI.

Abstract: Adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) have been suggested as a novel treatment for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); however, the mechanisms underlying their therapeutic effect remain poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association of Notch signaling, which is crucial for cellular proliferation and differentiation in ADSC-mediated treatment of NASH. Flow cytometry analysis of ADSCs showed that they expressed the Notch ligands JAG1, DLL1, and DLL4. The expression of genes associated with the Notch signaling pathway was attenuated in hepatocytes of NASH model mice. We further observed ADSC-mediated activation of Notch signaling in these hepatocytes in addition to an increase in proliferating cell nuclear antigen+ cells and a decrease in TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling+ apoptotic cells. Co-culture of palmitic acid-induced steatotic hepatocytes and ADSCs resulted in the activation of Notch signaling and reduction of apoptosis of steatotic hepatocytes. Moreover, inhibition of Notch signaling by a γ-secretase inhibitor and knockdown of Notch ligands using siRNA attenuated the anti-apoptotic effect of co-cultured ADSCs in vitro. Our findings show that the Notch signaling pathway is involved in the inhibition of apoptosis and restoration of cellular proliferation of hepatocytes from NASH mice following ADSC treatment.

The intestine is divided into functionally distinct regions along the anteroposterior (A/P) axis. How the regional identity influences the function of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and their offspring remain largely unresolved. We introduce an imaging-based method, “Linear Analysis of Midgut” (LAM), which allows quantitative, regionally defined cellular phenotyping of the whole Drosophila midgut. LAM transforms image-derived cellular data from three-dimensional midguts into a linearized representation, binning it into segments along the A/P axis. Through automated multivariate determination of regional borders, LAM allows mapping and comparison of cellular features and frequencies with subregional resolution. Through the use of LAM, we quantify the distributions of ISCs, enteroblasts, and enteroendocrine cells in a steady-state midgut, and reveal unprecedented regional heterogeneity in the ISC response to a Drosophila model of colitis. Altogether, LAM is a powerful tool for organ-wide quantitative analysis of the regional heterogeneity of midgut cells.

Abstract: Summary
Kinase inhibitors are promising drugs to stabilize the endothelial barrier following inflammatory damage. However, our limited knowledge of how kinase signaling activates barrier-restorative pathways and the complexity of multi-target drugs have hindered drug discovery and repurposing efforts. Here, we apply a kinase regression approach that exploits drug polypharmacology to investigate endothelial barrier regulation. A screen of 28 kinase inhibitors identified multiple inhibitors that promote endothelial barrier integrity and revealed divergent barrier phenotypes for BCR-ABL drugs. Target deconvolution predicted 50 barrier-regulating kinases from diverse kinase families. Using gene knockdowns, we identified kinases with a role in endothelial barrier regulation and dissected different mechanisms of action of barrier-protective kinase inhibitors. These results demonstrate the importance of polypharmacology in the endothelial barrier phenotype of kinase inhibitors and provide promising new leads for barrier-strengthening therapies.

Abstract: CD4+CD25+ regulatory T (Treg) cells and Th17 cells play important roles in the progression of metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). However, the contribution of monokine induced by interferon-gamma (MIG)/CXCL9 to the Treg/Th17 imbalance in MAFLD is only partially understood. In the present study, we detected increased levels of MIG/CXCL9 and a Treg/Th17 imbalance in the setting of metabolic-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Recombinant adeno-associated virus-mediated gene transfer and silencing of MIG/CXCL9 expression in mice alleviated MASH and increased the Treg/Th17 ratio. Furthermore, the percentage of Th17 cells, but not Treg cells, differentiated from splenic CD4+ T cells was significantly increased by administration of MIG/CXCL9. MIG/CXCL9 also promoted Th17 cell proliferation, and its effects were dose dependent. Levels of phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) decreased dramatically when MIG/CXCL9 was inhibited in a murine MASH model. In cultured Treg cells, phosphorylated JNK levels decreased dose-dependently in response to MIG/CXCL9 inhibition, but increased in cultured Th17 cells. This effect was blocked in the presence of a JNK inhibitor. These findings underline the fundamental importance of MIG/CXCL9 in maintaining the Treg/Th17 balance in MAFLD and provide the foundations for a novel approach to preventing and treating MAFLD.

Abstract: Summary
Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are a class of isopeptidases that regulate ubiquitin dynamics through catalytic cleavage of ubiquitin from protein substrates and ubiquitin precursors. Despite growing interest in DUB biological function and potential as therapeutic targets, few selective small-molecule inhibitors and no approved drugs currently exist. To identify chemical scaffolds targeting specific DUBs and establish a broader framework for future inhibitor development across the gene family, we performed high-throughput screening of a chemically diverse small-molecule library against eight different DUBs, spanning three well-characterized DUB families. Promising hit compounds were validated in a series of counter-screens and orthogonal assays, as well as further assessed for selectivity across expanded panels of DUBs. Through these efforts, we have identified multiple highly selective DUB inhibitors and developed a roadmap for rapidly identifying and validating selective inhibitors of related enzymes.

Abstract: The prognosis in patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is widely affected by the resistance to chemotherapy. As a culture scaffold, collagen I was showed to promote CSC (cancer stem cell) properties of cancer cells which could be used as in vitro models to study the chemoresistance in HNSCC. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a cellular stress condition which could affect tumor progression and promote the anti-tumor effects of certain drugs. However, the impact of ER stress on collagen I induced CSC properties and chemoresistance of HNSCC cells has not been addressed. In this study we investigated the effects of tunicamycin (TM) induced ER stress on the stemness and sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs of FaDu hypopharyngeal carcinoma cells in 3D (three-dimensional) collagen I cultures and mouse xenograft models. Our study revealed that Collagen I scaffold promoted CSC properties and increased G1 population of FaDu cells in 3D cultures, accompanied by maturation of integrin β1 and enhanced activated TGF-β1 concentration. Compared to 2D (two-dimensional) cultured cells, cells in 3D Collagen I scaffold exhibited significantly increased resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs of cisplatin and paclitaxel. Further analysis revealed that TM induced ER stress preferentially attenuated chemoresistance of FaDu cells in 3D collagen I, downregulated their CSC properties and TGF-β1 concentration and resulted in deglycosylation of integrin β1. TM was further evaluated in the mouse xenograft models and showed significant tumor growth inhibition in combination with paclitaxel than either TM or paclitaxel alone. Taken together, Our findings suggest that TM-induced ER stress potentiates anticancer efficacy of FaDu cells in 3D cultures and in vivo, and highlight implications for targeting chemotherapy-resistant cancer stem cells under ER stress conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Cell membrane deformation is an important feature that occurs during many physiological processes, and its study has been put to good use to investigate cardiomyocyte function. Several methods have been developed to extract information on cardiomyocyte contractility. However, no existing computational framework has provided, in a single platform, a straightforward approach to acquire, process, and quantify this type of cellular dynamics. For this reason, we develop CONTRACTIONWAVE, high-performance software written in Python programming language that allows the user to process large data image files and obtain contractility parameters by analyzing optical flow from images obtained with videomicroscopy. The software was validated by using neonatal, adult-, and human-induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes, treated or not with drugs known to affect contractility. Results presented indicate that CONTRACTIONWAVE is an excellent tool for examining changes to cardiac cellular contractility in animal models of disease and for pharmacological and toxicology screening during drug discovery.

Abstract: Summary
Identification of pregnancies at risk of preterm birth (PTB), the leading cause of newborn deaths, remains challenging given the syndromic nature of the disease. We report a longitudinal multi-omics study coupled with a DREAM challenge to develop predictive models of PTB. The findings indicate that whole-blood gene expression predicts ultrasound-based gestational ages in normal and complicated pregnancies (r = 0.83) and, using data collected before 37 weeks of gestation, also predicts the delivery date in both normal pregnancies (r = 0.86) and those with spontaneous preterm birth (r = 0.75). Based on samples collected before 33 weeks in asymptomatic women, our analysis suggests that expression changes preceding preterm prelabor rupture of the membranes are consistent across time points and cohorts and involve leukocyte-mediated immunity. Models built from plasma proteomic data predict spontaneous preterm delivery with intact membranes with higher accuracy and earlier in pregnancy than transcriptomic models (AUROC = 0.76 versus AUROC = 0.6 at 27–33 weeks of gestation).

Abstract: Summary
Microglia play critical roles in brain development, homeostasis, and disease. Microglia in animal models cannot accurately model human microglia due to notable transcriptomic and functional differences between human and other animal microglia. Incorporating human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived microglia into brain organoids provides unprecedented opportunities to study human microglia. However, an optimized method that integrates appropriate amounts of microglia into brain organoids at a proper time point, resembling in vivo brain development, is still lacking. Here, we report a new brain region-specific, microglia-containing organoid model by co-culturing hPSC-derived primitive neural progenitor cells and primitive macrophage progenitors. In the organoids, the number of human microglia can be controlled, and microglia exhibit phagocytic activity and synaptic pruning function. Furthermore, human microglia respond to Zika virus infection of the organoids. Our findings establish a new microglia-containing brain organoid model that will serve to study human microglial function in a variety of neurological disorders.

Abstract: The hallmarks of allergic airway disease (AAD) include infiltration of inflammatory cells into the bronchoalveolar space. Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) show anti-inflammatory properties in AAD. In addition, galectin-1 (Gal-1) is a lectin significantly upregulated upon inflammation and is also known to mediate potential anti-inflammatory responses. We hypothesized that BMSCs regulated inflammatory responses by secretion of Gal-1 during AAD pathogenesis. BMSCs were isolated from murine femurs and tibiae and adoptively transferred into an ovalbumin-induced AAD mouse model. Knockdown of Gal-1 in BMSCs was performed using shRNA. Flow cytometry, ELISAs, and immunohistology were performed to analyze inflammatory responses in mice, and a Transwell system was used to establish an in vitro co-culture system of lung epithelial cells (MLE-12) and BMSCs. Administration of BMSCs significantly upregulated Gal-1 expression upon inflammation and decreased infiltration of inflammatory cells and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in vivo. In addition, we showed that this function was mediated by reduced activation of the MAPK p38 signaling pathway. Similar observations were found using an in vitro lipopolysaccharide-induced model when MLE-12 cells were co-cultured with BMSCs. Gal-1 secretion by BMSCs alleviated inflammatory responses observed in AAD and hence provides a promising therapeutic alternative to AAD patients insensitive to conventional drug treatments.

Abstract: Heat stress has detrimental effects on livestock via diverse immune and physiological changes; heat-stressed animals are rendered susceptible to diverse diseases. However, there is relatively little information available regarding the altered immune responses of domestic animals in heat stress environments, particularly in cattle steers. This study aimed to determine the changes in the immune responses of Holstein and Jersey steers under heat stress. We assessed blood immune cells and their functions in the steers of two breeds under normal and heat stress conditions and found that immune cell proportions and functions were altered in response to different environmental conditions. Heat stress notably reduced the proportions of CD21+MHCII+ B cell populations in both breeds. We also observed breed-specific differences. Under heat stress, in Holstein steers, the expression of myeloperoxidase was reduced in the polymorphonuclear cells, whereas heat stress reduced the WC1+ γδ T cell populations in Jersey steers. Breed-specific changes were also detected based on gene expression. In response to heat stress, the expression of IL-10 and IL-17A increased in Holstein steers alone, whereas that of IL-6 increased in Jersey steers. Moreover, the mRNA expression pattern of heat shock protein genes such as Hsp70 and Hsp90 was significantly increased in only Holstein steers. Collectively, these results indicate that altered blood immunological profiles may provide a potential explanation for the enhanced susceptibility of heat-stressed steers to disease. The findings of this study provide important information that will contribute to developing new strategies to alleviate the detrimental effects of heat stress on steers.

Abstract: This study aimed toengineer a pancreatic tissue. Intact rat pancreases were successfully decellularized, and were reseeded with human-induced pluripotent stem cells using different 2D and 3D culture growth factors. The differentiation process was assessed for the presence of a pancreas-like tissue. The histology and SEM analysis revealed cell attachment in all samples, except for the Exp4, and the Flow-cytometry provided 87% viability for the differentiated cells. In Exp1, PDX1 with the positive expression of 2.87±0.06 was dramatically higher than Exp2 with a 2.44±0.06 reaction. NGN3-reactions were 8±0.1 and 6.6±0.2 in Exp1 and Exp2 at P < 0.05, respectively. C-peptide with the expression of 7.5±0.7 in Exp3 was almost equal to that in Exp1 and Exp2. Glucagon (5.1±1) and PDX1 (3.2±0.82) in Exp3 indicated no significant difference. The significant upregulations of pancreatic endocrine markers (PDX1 and NGN3), and the cell-specific glucose transporter (GLUT2) were observed in the differentiated IPCs in the 3D culture of Exp2 after 21 days. The highest insulin and C-peptide concentrations were observed in Exp2. In Exp3, insulin secretion in response to high glucose and 10 mM arginine was 42.43 ±6.34 μU/ml. A decellularized pancreas in the presence of hiPSCs and growth factors could be efficiently used as a natural scaffold.

Abstract: Radiation has been proposed as a priming agent to induce discriminatory luminal biomarkers for vascular targeting and drug delivery in disorders such as brain arteriovenous malformations and cancers. We previously observed ectopic expression of intracellular proteins such as mitochondrial PDCE2 on irradiated endothelium in animal models. In this study we examined the mechanism of PDCE2 trafficking in human endothelial cells to better understand its suitability as a vascular target. Ionizing radiation induced PDCE2 surface localization in association with accumulation of autophagosome markers (L3CB and p62) indicative of late-stage inhibition of autophagic flux. This effect was abolished in the presence of Rapamycin, an autophagy-inducer, but replicated in the presence of Bafilomycin A, an autophagy blocker. PDCE2 co-localized with lysosomal markers of the canonical degradative autophagy pathway in response to radiation but also with recycling endosomes and SNARE proteins responsible for autophagosome-plasma membrane fusion. These findings demonstrate that radiation-induced blockade of autophagic flux stimulates redirection of intracellular molecules such as PDCE2 to the cell surface via a non-canonical secretory autophagy pathway. Intracellular membrane proteins trafficked in this way could provide a unique pool of radiation biomarkers for therapeutic drug delivery.

Abstract: Summary
Spermatogonial transplantation has been used as a standard assay for spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). After transplantation into the seminiferous tubules, SSCs transmigrate through the blood-testis barrier (BTB) between Sertoli cells and settle in a niche. Unlike in the repair of other self-renewing systems, SSC transplantation is generally performed after complete destruction of endogenous spermatogenesis. Here, we examined the impacts of recipient conditioning on SSC homing. Germ cell ablation downregulated the expression of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, which has been shown to attract SSCs to niches, implying that nonablated niches would attract SSCs more efficiently. As expected, SSCs colonized nonablated testes when transplanted into recipients with the same genetic background. Moreover, although spermatogenesis was arrested at the spermatocyte stage in Cldn11-deficient mice without a BTB, transplantation not only enhanced donor colonization but also restored normal spermatogenesis. The results show promise for the development of a new transplantation strategy to overcome male infertility.

Abstract: Maintenance of genome stability is essential for every living cell as genetic information is repeatedly challenged during DNA replication in each cell division event. Errors, defects, delays, and mistakes that arise during mitosis or meiosis lead to an activation of DNA repair processes and in case of their failure, programmed cell death, i.e. apoptosis, could be initiated. Fam208a is a protein whose importance in heterochromatin maintenance has been described recently. In this work, we describe the crucial role of Fam208a in sustaining genome stability during cellular division. The targeted depletion of Fam208a in mice using CRISPR/Cas9 led to embryonic lethality before E12.5. We also used the siRNA approach to downregulate Fam208a in zygotes to avoid the influence of maternal RNA in the early stages of development. This early downregulation increased arresting of the embryonal development at the two-cell stage and the occurrence of multipolar spindles formation. To investigate this further, we used the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system and identified new putative interaction partners Gpsm2, Svil, and Itgb3bp. Their co-expression with Fam208a was assessed by RT-qPCR profiling and in situ hybridization [1] in multiple murine tissues. Based on these results we proposed that Fam208a functions within the HUSH complex by interaction with Mphosph8 as these proteins are not only able to physically interact but also co-localise. We are bringing new evidence that Fam208a is a multi-interacting protein affecting genome stability on the cell division level at the earliest stages of development and by interaction with methylation complex in adult tissues. In addition to its epigenetic functions, Fam208a appears to have an important role in the zygotic division, possibly via interaction with newly identified putative partners Gpsm2, Svil, and Itgb3bp.

Abstract: ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter C10 (ABCC10), also named multidrug resistance protein 7 (MRP7), is a member of ABC transporter superfamily and has been revealed to transport a wide range of chemotherapeutic agents including taxanes, epothilone B, Vinca alkaloids, and anthracyclines. In our previous study, a 5-cyano-6-phenylpyrimidin derivative CP55 was synthesized and found significantly reversal effect of multidrug resistance (MDR) mediated by ABCB1. In this study, we found CP55 also efficiently reversed MDR mediated by ABCC10. Our in vitro study showed that co-treatment with CP55 significantly increased the efficacy of ABCC10-substrate anticancer drugs in MDR cells overexpressing ABCC10. Furthermore, we showed that treatment with CP55 increased the intracellular accumulation of [3H]-labeled anticancer drugs and in-turn decreasing drug efflux by inhibiting the transport activity, without altering ABCC10 protein ex-pression level or cellular localization. Potential CP55-ABCC10 interactions were predicted via docking analysis using human ABCC10 homology model and obtained high docking score. Therefore, CP55 represents a promising therapeutic agent in the combinational treatment of chemo-resistant cancer related to ABCC10.

Abstract: Satellite cells represent the main myogenic population accounting for skeletal muscle homeostasis and regeneration. While our knowledge of the signaling pathways controlling satellite cell regenerative capability is increasing, the underlying epigenetic mechanisms are still not clear, especially in the case of human satellite cells. Here, by performing chromatin accessibility profiling (ATAC-seq) in samples isolated from human and murine muscles, we investigated the changes in the epigenetic landscape occurring during the transition from activated satellite cells to myoblasts. Our analysis identifies a compendium of putative regulatory elements defining human activated satellite cells and myoblasts, respectively. A subset of these differentially accessible loci is shared by both murine and human satellite cells, includes elements associated with known self-renewal regulators, and is enriched for motifs bound by transcription factors participating in satellite cell regulation. Integration of transcriptional and epigenetic data reveals that known regulators of metabolic gene expression, such as PPARGC1A, represent potential PAX7 targets. Through characterization of genomic networks and the underlying effectors, our data represent an important starting point for decoding and manipulating the molecular mechanisms underlying human satellite cell muscle regenerative potential.

We have previously shown that biolistic delivery of an expression construct encoding inducible HSP70 (HSP70i) with one amino acid modification in the dendritic cell (DC) activating moiety 435–445 (HSP70iQ435A) to mouse skin resulted in significant immunosuppressive activity of autoimmune vitiligo, associated with fewer tissue infiltrating T cells. To prepare HSP70iQ435A as a potential therapeutic for autoimmune vitiligo, in this study we evaluated whether and how biolistic delivery of HSP70iQ435A in mice affects anti-tumor responses. We found that HSP70iQ435A in fact supports anti-tumor responses in melanoma-challenged C57BL/6 mice. Biolistic delivery of the HSP70iQ435A-encoding construct to mice elicited significant anti-HSP70 titers, and anti-HSP70 IgG and IgM antibodies recognize surface-expressed and cytoplasmic HSP70i in human and mouse melanoma cells. A peptide scan revealed that the anti-HSP70 antibodies recognize a specific C-terminal motif within the HSP70i protein. The antibodies elicited surface CD107A expression among mouse NK cells, representative of antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), supporting the concept, that HSP70iQ435A-encoding DNA elicits a humoral response to the stress protein expressed selectively on the surface of melanoma cells. Thus, besides limiting autoimmunity and inflammation, HSP70iQ435A elicits humoral responses that limit tumor growth and may be used in conjunction with immune checkpoint inhibitors to not only control tumor but to also limit adverse events following tumor immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Recent advancements in tissue clearing technologies have offered unparalleled opportunities for researchers to explore the whole mouse brain at cellular resolution. With the expansion of this experimental technique, however, a scalable and easy-to-use computational tool is in demand to effectively analyze and integrate whole-brain mapping datasets. To that end, here we present CUBIC-Cloud, a cloud-based framework to quantify, visualize, and integrate mouse brain data. CUBIC-Cloud is a fully automated system where users can upload their whole-brain data, run analyses, and publish the results. We demonstrate the generality of CUBIC-Cloud by a variety of applications. First, we investigated the brain-wide distribution of five cell types. Second, we quantified Aβ plaque deposition in Alzheimer’s disease model mouse brains. Third, we reconstructed a neuronal activity profile under LPS-induced inflammation by c-Fos immunostaining. Last, we show brain-wide connectivity mapping by pseudotyped rabies virus. Together, CUBIC-Cloud provides an integrative platform to advance scalable and collaborative whole-brain mapping.

Abstract: Summary
Immune deactivation of phagocytes is a central event in the pathogenesis of sepsis. Herein, we identify a master regulatory role of IL-6 signaling on LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) and reveal that uncoupling of these two processes during sepsis induces immunoparalysis in monocytes/macrophages. In particular, we demonstrate that activation of LAP by the human fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus depends on ERK1/2-mediated phosphorylation of p47phox subunit of NADPH oxidase. Physiologically, autocrine IL-6/JAK2/Ninein axis orchestrates microtubule organization and dynamics regulating ERK recruitment to the phagosome and LC3+ phagosome (LAPosome) formation. In sepsis, loss of IL-6 signaling specifically abrogates microtubule-mediated trafficking of ERK, leading to defective activation of LAP and impaired killing of bacterial and fungal pathogens by monocytes/macrophages, which can be selectively restored by IL-6 supplementation. Our work uncovers a molecular pathway linking IL-6 signaling with LAP and provides insight into the mechanisms underlying immunoparalysis in sepsis.

Abstract: Summary
Recently approved vaccines have shown remarkable efficacy in limiting SARS-CoV-2-associated disease. However, with the variety of vaccines, immunization strategies, and waning antibody titers, defining the correlates of immunity across a spectrum of antibody titers is urgently required. Thus, we profiled the humoral immune response in a cohort of non-human primates immunized with a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (NVX-CoV2373) at two doses, administered as a single- or two-dose regimen. Both antigen dose and boosting significantly altered neutralization titers and Fc-effector profiles, driving unique vaccine-induced antibody fingerprints. Combined differences in antibody effector functions and neutralization were associated with distinct levels of protection in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Moreover, NVX-CoV2373 elicited antibodies that functionally targeted emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Collectively, the data presented here suggest that a single dose may prevent disease via combined Fc/Fab functions but that two doses may be essential to block further transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants.

Abstract: Summary
GAS41 is an emerging oncogene overexpressed and implicated in multiple cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). GAS41 is a dimeric protein that contains the YEATS domain, which is involved in the recognition of lysine-acylated histones. Here, we report the development of GAS41 YEATS inhibitors by employing a fragment-based screening approach. These inhibitors bind to GAS41 YEATS domain in a channel constituting a recognition site for acylated lysine on histone proteins. To enhance inhibitory activity, we developed a dimeric analog with nanomolar activity that blocks interactions of GAS41 with acetylated histone H3. Our lead compound engages GAS41 in cells, blocks proliferation of NSCLC cells, and modulates expression of GAS41-dependent genes, validating on-target mechanism of action. This study demonstrates that disruption of GAS41 protein-protein interactions may represent an attractive approach to target lung cancer cells. This work exemplifies the use of bivalent inhibitors as a general strategy to block challenging protein-protein interactions.

Abstract: Summary
Hereditary sensory neuropathy type 1 (HSN1) is caused by mutations in the SPTLC1 or SPTLC2 sub-units of the enzyme serine palmitoyltransferase, resulting in the production of toxic 1-deoxysphingolipid bases (DSBs). We used induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with HSN1 to determine whether endogenous DSBs are neurotoxic, patho-mechanisms of toxicity and response to therapy. HSN1 iPSC-derived sensory neurons (iPSCdSNs) endogenously produce neurotoxic DSBs. Complex gangliosides, which are essential for membrane micro-domains and signaling, are reduced, and neurotrophin signaling is impaired, resulting in reduced neurite outgrowth. In HSN1 myelinating cocultures, we find a major disruption of nodal complex proteins after 8 weeks, which leads to complete myelin breakdown after 6 months. HSN1 iPSC models have, therefore, revealed that SPTLC1 mutation alters lipid metabolism, impairs the formation of complex gangliosides, and reduces axon and myelin stability. Many of these changes are prevented by l-serine supplementation, supporting its use as a rational therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Neural and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (NPCs and OPCs) in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the brain contribute to oligodendrogenesis throughout life, in part due to direct regulation by chemokines. The role of the chemokine fractalkine is well established in microglia; however, the effect of fractalkine on SVZ precursor cells is unknown. We show that murine SVZ NPCs and OPCs express the fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) and bind fractalkine. Exogenous fractalkine directly enhances OPC and oligodendrocyte genesis from SVZ NPCs in vitro. Infusion of fractalkine into the lateral ventricle of adult NPC lineage-tracing mice leads to increased newborn OPC and oligodendrocyte formation in vivo. We also show that OPCs secrete fractalkine and that inhibition of endogenous fractalkine signaling reduces oligodendrocyte formation in vitro. Finally, we show that fractalkine signaling regulates oligodendrogenesis in cerebellar slices ex vivo. In summary, we demonstrate a novel role for fractalkine signaling in regulating oligodendrocyte genesis from postnatal CNS precursor cells.

Abstract: The Serum Amyloid A (SAA) family of proteins is associated with various pathological conditions, including cancer. However, their role in cancer is incompletely understood. Here, we investigated the role of SAA1 in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, survival signaling, metabolism, and metastasis in models of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), using RNAi. Our data show that in untransformed epithelial cells (MCF12A), the knockdown of SAA1 induces the expression of cell cycle regulators (MCM2, p53), the activation of DNA repair (PARP synthesis), and survival signaling (NFκB). In contrast, knockdown of SAA1 in the TNBC cell line (MDA-MB-231) induced the expression p16 and shifted cells in the cell cycle from the S to G2/M phase, without the activation of DNA repair. Moreover, in SAA1-deficient MDA-MB-231 and HCC70 cells, metabolism (NADH oxidation) continually increased while cell migration (% wound closure and the rate of wound closure) decreased. However, silencing of SAA1 altered epithelial and mesenchymal markers in MCF12A (E-cadherin, Laminin 1β, Vimentin) and MDA-MB-231 (α-Smooth muscle actin) cells, associated with the metastatic program of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Nonetheless, our data provide evidence that SAA1 could potentially serve as a therapeutic target in TNBC.

Abstract: Background
Mutations at sites crucial for the interaction between RAD51 and BRC domains impair the ability of BRCA2 homologous recombination. We aimed to clarify whether BRCA2 BRC domain-associated mutation correlates with sensibility of platinum-based chemotherapy and survival in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC).
Methods
We identified BRCA2 BRC domain mutations by sequencing PCR-amplified amplicons of genomic DNA isolated from tumor tissues and peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL)in 113 patients with advanced EOC, and assessed platinum-free interval (PFI), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
Results
21.23% (24 of 113) cases with somatic missense mutation but not germline mutation were identified. Among 24 cases with mutation, 33.3% (8 of 24) cases with nonsense mutation (C-terminal truncation) significantly prolonged median PFI (37 vs 8 months,P = 0.000), PFS (43 vs 14 months, p = 0.000) and OS (56 vs 31 months, P = 0.002); 66.7% (16 of 24) cases with missense mutation also prolonged median PFI (15 vs 8 months, P = 0.044), PFS (21 vs 14 months, P = 0.049) and OS (38 vs 31 months, P = 0.037), compared to those without any mutation.
Conclusions
Somatic mutations in BRCA2 BRC domain confer a higher sensitivity to platinum-based therapy and are associated with a favourable survival in HGSOC.

Abstract: Summary
Necroptosis mediated by Z-nucleic-acid-binding protein (ZBP)1 (also called DAI or DLM1) contributes to innate host defense against viruses by triggering cell death to eliminate infected cells. During infection, vaccinia virus (VACV) protein E3 prevents death signaling by competing for Z-form RNA through an N-terminal Zα domain. In the absence of this E3 domain, Z-form RNA accumulates during the early phase of VACV infection, triggering ZBP1 to recruit receptor interacting protein kinase (RIPK)3 and execute necroptosis. The C-terminal E3 double-strand RNA-binding domain must be retained to observe accumulation of Z-form RNA and induction of necroptosis. Substitutions of Zα from either ZBP1 or the RNA-editing enzyme double-stranded RNA adenosine deaminase (ADAR)1 yields fully functional E3 capable of suppressing virus-induced necroptosis. Overall, our evidence reveals the importance of Z-form RNA generated during VACV infection as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) unleashing ZBP1/RIPK3/MLKL-dependent necroptosis unless suppressed by viral E3.

Abstract: Backgrounds
Osteoarthritis (OA) is an orthopedic inflammatory disease which can cause functional disability and chronic pain. MiRNAs are known to play important roles in OA. To identify the targets for the treatment of OA, bioinformatics analysis was performed to explore differentially expressed miRNAs between OA and normal samples.
Methods
Bioinformatics analysis was conducted to identify differentially expressed miRNAs. To mimic OA in vitro, primary chondrocytes were stimulated with IL-1β. Meanwhile, flow cytometry was performed to detect the cell apoptosis and cycle distribution. In addition, protein and mRNA expressions were detected by Western blot and RT-qPCR, respectively. Finally, in vivo model of OA was constructed to investigate the function of miR-892b in OA.
Results
The data indicated that miR-892b was identified to be upregulated in OA samples. Additionally, miR-892b antagomir markedly reversed IL-1β-induced growth decline of chondrocytes via inhibiting the apoptosis. IL-1β notably elevated the expressions of MMP1 and MMP13 and downregulated the level of Aggrecan in chondrocytes, while miR-892b antagomir reversed these phenomena. Meanwhile, cyclin D1 and cyclin D2 were the direct targets of miR-892b. In addition, IL-1β-induced G1 phase arrest in chondrocytes was partially abolished by of miR-892b antagomir. In vivo study indicated miR-892b antagomir could significantly alleviate the symptom of OA in a rat model.
Conclusion
MiR-892b antagomir inhibits the progression of OA via targeting Cyclin D1 and Cyclin D2. Thus, our finding might supply a novel target for OA treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Ganciclovir (GCV) is the first-line therapy against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a widespread infection that is particularly dangerous for immunodeficient individuals. Closely resembling deoxyguanosine triphosphate, the tri-phosphorylated metabolite of GCV (GCV-TP) is preferentially incorporated by the viral DNA polymerase, thereby terminating chain extension and, eventually, viral replication. However, the treatment outcome of GCV varies greatly among individuals, therefore warranting better understanding of its metabolism. Here we show that NUDT15, a Nudix hydrolase known to metabolize thiopurine triphosphates, can similarly hydrolyze GCV-TP through biochemical studies and co-crystallization of the NUDT15/GCV-TP complex. More critically, GCV efficacy was potentiated in HCMV-infected cells following NUDT15 depletion by RNAi or inhibition by an in-house-developed, nanomolar NUDT15 inhibitor, TH8321, suggesting that pharmacological targeting of NUDT15 is a possible avenue to improve existing anti-HCMV regimens. Collectively, the data further implicate NUDT15 as a broad-spectrum metabolic regulator of nucleoside analog therapeutics, such as thiopurines and GCV.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor endothelial marker 1 (TEM1) is an emerging cancer target with a unique dual expression profile. First, TEM1 is expressed in the stroma and neo-vasculature of many human carcinomas but is largely absent from healthy adult tissues. Second, TEM1 is expressed by tumor cells of mesenchymal origin, notably sarcoma. Here, we present two fully human anti-TEM1 single-chain variable fragment (scFv) reagents, namely, 1C1m and 7G22, that recognize distinct regions of the extracellular domain and possess substantially different affinities. In contrast to other, well-described anti-TEM1 binders, these fragments confer cytolytic activity when expressed as 2nd generation chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). Moreover, both molecules selectively redirect human T cell effector functions toward TEM1+ tumor cells when incorporated into experimental soluble bispecific trivalent engagers that we term TriloBiTEs (tBs). Furthermore, systemic delivery of 1C1m-tB prevents the establishment of Ewing sarcoma tumors in a xenograft model. Our observations confirm TEM1 as a promising target for cancer immunotherapy and illustrate the prospective translational potential of certain scFv-based reagents.

Abstract: Summary
Aberrant protein citrullination is associated with many pathologies; however, the specific effects of this modification remain unknown. We have previously demonstrated that serine protease inhibitors (SERPINs) are highly citrullinated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. These citrullinated SERPINs include antithrombin, antiplasmin, and t-PAI, which regulate the coagulation and fibrinolysis cascades. Notably, citrullination eliminates their inhibitory activity. Here, we demonstrate that citrullination of antithrombin and t-PAI impairs their binding to their cognate proteases. By contrast, citrullination converts antiplasmin into a substrate. We recapitulate the effects of SERPIN citrullination using in vitro plasma clotting and fibrinolysis assays. Moreover, we show that citrullinated antithrombin and antiplasmin are increased and decreased in a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) model, accounting for how SERPIN citrullination shifts the equilibrium toward thrombus formation. These data provide a direct link between increased citrullination and the risk of thrombosis in autoimmunity and indicate that aberrant SERPIN citrullination promotes pathological thrombus formation.

Abstract: Summary
Quantitative information about the levels and dynamics of post-translational modifications (PTMs) is critical for an understanding of cellular functions. Protein arginine methylation (ArgMet) is an important subclass of PTMs and is involved in a plethora of (patho)physiological processes. However, because of the lack of methods for global analysis of ArgMet, the link between ArgMet levels, dynamics, and (patho)physiology remains largely unknown. We utilized the high sensitivity and robustness of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to develop a general method for the quantification of global protein ArgMet. Our NMR-based approach enables the detection of protein ArgMet in purified proteins, cells, organoids, and mouse tissues. We demonstrate that the process of ArgMet is a highly prevalent PTM and can be modulated by small-molecule inhibitors and metabolites and changes in cancer and during aging. Thus, our approach enables us to address a wide range of biological questions related to ArgMet in health and disease.

However, previous clinical studies have indicated that some patients with liver cancer are resistant to sorafenib treatment and the existing strategies are not satisfactory in the clinic. Therefore, it is urgent to investigate strategies to improve the effectiveness of sorafenib for liver cancer and to explore effective drug combinations. In the present study, we found that dichloroacetate (DCA) could significantly enhance the anti-tumor effect of sorafenib on liver cancer cells, including reduced viability and dramatically promoted apoptosis in liver cancer cells. Moreover, compared to sorafenib alone, the combination of DCA and sorafenib markedly increased the degradation of anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 by enhancing its phosphorylation. Overexpression of Mcl-1 could significantly attenuate the synergetic effect of DCA and sorafenib on apoptosis induction in liver cancer cells. Furthermore, we found that the ROS-JNK pathway was obviously activated in the DCA combined sorafenib group. The levels of ROS and p-JNK were dramatically up-regulated in the two drug combination groups. Antioxidant NAC could alleviate the synergetic effects of DCA and sorafenib on ROS generation, JNK activation, Mcl-1 degradation, and cell apoptosis. Moreover, DCA and sorafenib's effects on Mcl-1 degradation and apoptosis could also be inhibited by JNK inhibitor ‘SP’600125. Finally, the synergetic effects of DCA and sorafenib on tumor growth suppression, Mcl-1 degradation and induction of apoptosis were also validated in liver cancer xenograft in vivo. These findings indicate that DCA enhances the anti-tumor effect of sorafenib via the ROS-JNK-Mcl-1 pathway in liver cancer cells. This study may provide new insights to improve the chemotherapeutic effect of sorafenib, which may be beneﬁcial for further clinical application of sorafenib in liver cancer treatment.

Abstract: Angiopoietin like 4 (ANGPTL4) has been proved to play an important role in lipid and glucose metabolism disorders and related cardiovascular diseases, but its role in the formation of cirrhosis still needs to be further explored. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of ANGPTL4 in the development of liver cirrhosis and its mechanism, as well as its effect on Kupffer cell polarization and hepatic stellate cell activation. The ELISA and RT-qPCR assay were used to detect the content of ANGPTL4 in serum and mRNA expression in cells and tissues respectively. The expression of ANGPTL4, Arg1 and Mrc2 in Kupffer cells was measured by Western blot. The percentage of CD163+ and CD206+ cells was measured by flow cytometry. Mice cirrhosis model was established, and the expression of ANGPTL4 was interfered by injecting sh-ANGPTL4 lentiviral vector into caudal vein. The results revealed that ANGPTL4 was significantly up-regulated in liver cirrhosis patients and HBV induced liver injury cell models. Further studies found that interference with ANGPTL4 regulated CD163 and inhibited the polarization and proinflammatory effects of KCs，as well as inhibited the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and fibrosis. More importantly, Interference with ANGPTL4 inhibits the progression of liver cirrhosis in mice. What's more, TLR4/NF-κB pathway was involved in the molecular mechanism of ANGPTL4 on Kupffer cells and hepatic stellate cells. It is suggested that the mechanism of sh-ANGPTL4 suppressing the polarization of KCs and the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) is to regulate the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Guanine quadruplexes (G4s) are non-canonical nucleic acid structures commonly found in regulatory genomic regions. G4 targeting has emerged as a therapeutic approach in cancer. We have screened naphthalene-diimides (NDIs), a class of G4 ligands, in a cellular model of colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we identify the leading compound T5 with a potent and selective inhibition of cell growth by high-affinity binding to G4s in ribosomal DNA, impairing RNA polymerase I (Pol I) elongation. Consequently, T5 induces a rapid inhibition of Pol I transcription, nucleolus disruption, proteasome-dependent Pol I catalytic subunit A degradation and autophagy. Moreover, we attribute the higher selectivity of carbohydrate-conjugated T5 for tumoral cells to its preferential uptake through the overexpressed glucose transporter 1. Finally, we succinctly demonstrate that T5 could be explored as a therapeutic agent in a patient cohort with CRC. Therefore, we report a mode of action for these NDIs involving ribosomal G4 targeting.

Abstract: Background
RNPC1 is reported to act as a tumor suppressor by binding and regulating the expression of target genes in various cancers. However, the role of RNPC1 in gastric cancer and the underlying mechanisms are still unclear.
Methods
Gastric cancer cells were stably transfected with lentivirus. Proliferation, migration, invasion, cell cycle in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo were used to assess the role of RNPC1. Quantitative real-time PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the relationship between RNPC1 and aurora kinase B (AURKB). RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays (REMSAs), and dual-luciferase reporter assays were used to identify the direct binding sites of RNPC1 with AURKB mRNA. A CCK-8 assay was conducted to confirm the function of AURKB in RNPC1-induced growth promotion.
Results
High RNPC1 expression was found in gastric cancer tissues and cell lines and was associated with high TNM stage. RNPC1 overexpression significantly promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of gastric cancer cells. Knockdown of RNPC1 could impede gastric cancer tumorigenesis in nude mice. AURKB expression was positively related to RNPC1. RNPC1 directly binds to the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of AURKB and enhances AURKB mRNA stability. AURKB reversed the proliferation induced by RNPC1 in gastric cancer cells. RNPC1 resulted in mitotic defects, aneuploidy and chromosomal instability in gastric cancer cells, similar to AURKB.
Conclusion
RNPC1 acts as an oncogene in gastric cancer by influencing cell mitosis by increasing AURKB mRNA stability, which may provide a potential biomarker and a therapeutic target for gastric cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Structure prediction for proteins lacking homologous templates in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) remains a significant unsolved problem. We developed a protocol, C-I-TASSER, to integrate interresidue contact maps from deep neural-network learning with the cutting-edge I-TASSER fragment assembly simulations. Large-scale benchmark tests showed that C-I-TASSER can fold more than twice the number of non-homologous proteins than the I-TASSER, which does not use contacts. When applied to a folding experiment on 8,266 unsolved Pfam families, C-I-TASSER successfully folded 4,162 domain families, including 504 folds that are not found in the PDB. Furthermore, it created correct folds for 85% of proteins in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, despite the quick mutation rate of the virus and sparse sequence profiles. The results demonstrated the critical importance of coupling whole-genome and metagenome-based evolutionary information with optimal structure assembly simulations for solving the problem of non-homologous protein structure prediction.

Abstract: Summary
Glypican 2 (GPC2) is a MYCN-regulated, differentially expressed cell-surface oncoprotein and target for immune-based therapies in neuroblastoma. Here, we build on GPC2’s immunotherapeutic attributes by finding that it is also a highly expressed, MYCN-driven oncoprotein on small-cell lung cancers (SCLCs), with significantly enriched expression in both the SCLC and neuroblastoma stem cell compartment.By solving the crystal structure of the D3-GPC2-Fab/GPC2 complex at 3.3 Å resolution, we further illustrate that the GPC2-directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC; D3-GPC2-PBD), that links a human GPC2 antibody (D3) to DNA-damaging pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimers, binds a tumor-specific, conformation-dependent epitope of the core GPC2 extracellular domain. We then show that this ADC induces durable neuroblastoma and SCLC tumor regression via induction of DNA damage, apoptosis, and bystander cell killing, notably with no signs of ADC-induced in vivo toxicity. These studies provide preclinical data to support the clinical translation of ADCs targeting GPC2.

Abstract: Aldehyde dehydrogenase 7 family member A1 (ALDH7A1) is an enzyme catalyzing lipid peroxidation of fatty aldehydes. It plays a critical role in sustaining high oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and ATP production in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PADC). However, why PADC cells maintain a relatively high level of ALDH7A1 concentration is still not well understood. In the current study, we explored the interplay between epidermal growth factor receptor kinase substrate 8 (EPS8) and ALDH7A1 in PADC cells. PADC cell lines MIA PaCa-2 and AsPANC-1 were used for in vitro and in vivo studies. The co-IP assay showed mutual interactions between Flag-EPS8 and Myc-ALDH7A1 in both MIA PaCa-2 and AsPANC-1 cells. EPS8 knockdown resulted in decreased ALDH7A1 protein levels and increased poly-ubiquitination. An interaction was observed between ALDH7A1 and BMI1 but not between BMI1 and EPS8. BMI1 knockdown reduced ALDH7A1 poly-ubiquitination and degradation caused by EPS8 knockdown. Dual EPS8 and ALDH7A1 knockdown had a synergistic effect on suppressing PADC cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, this study revealed that EPS8 supports PADC growth by interacting with ALDH7A1 and inhibiting BMI1 mediated proteasomal degradation of ALDH7A1.

Abstract: Chemotherapy is the preferred clinical treatment for advanced stage gastric cancer (GC) patients, of which efficacy could be markedly impaired due to the development of chemoresistance. Alternatively activated or M2-type tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) are recruited under chemotherapy and are highly implicated in the chemoresistance development, but underlying molecular mechanism for TAM activation is largely unknown. Here, we present that tumor-derived Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) induced by chemo drugs represses the chemo sensitivity of gastric tumor cells in a TAM-dependent manner. Mechanistically, cisplatin-induced HIF1α signaling activation directly drive the transcription of LIF, which promotes the resistance of gastric tumors to chemo drug. Further study revealed that tumor cell-derived LIF stimulates macrophages into tumor-supporting M2-type phenotype via activating STAT3 signaling pathway. Therapeutically, blocking LIF efficiently elevates chemo sensitivity of tumor cells and further represses the growth rates of tumors under chemotherapy. Therefore, our study reveals a novel insight in understanding the cross talking between tumor cells and immune cells and provides new therapeutic targets for gastric cancer.

Abstract: It has been demonstrated that the T-box family transcription factor 18 (Tbx18) -positive cells give rise to renal mesenchymal cells and contribute to the development of the urinary system. However, it is unclear whether Tbx18-positive cells are the origin of the myofibroblasts during renal fibrosis. The present study aimed to determine the contribution of Tbx18-positive cells in kidney fibrosis and their underlying mechanism. We show that Tbx18-positive cells contribute to the development of the urinary system, especially renal fibroblasts. Following unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), genetic fate tracing results demonstrated that Tbx18-positive cells not only proliferate but also expand and differentiate into fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, indicating that they may act as profibrotic progenitors. Cell culture results suggest that transforming growth factor (TGF)-β promotes Tbx18-positive cells differentiation into myofibroblasts and assist their contribution to kidney fibrosis. Overall, the present study demonstrated that Tbx18-positive cells may act as profibrotic progenitor cells in a pathological condition of UUO-induced injury. Moreover, TGF-β may play a role in differentiation of Tbx18-positive cells into myofibroblasts in kidney fibrosis. These findings may provide a potential target on Tbx18-positive myofibroblast progenitors in the treatment of renal fibrosis.

Abstract: The erstwhile developed temperature-humidity index (THI) has been popularly used to indicate heat stress in dairy cattle and often in buffaloes. However, scientific literature suggests differences in thermotolerance and physiological responses to heat stress between cattle and buffalo. Therefore, THI range used to indicate degree of heat stress (mild, moderate, and severe) in cattle should be recalibrated for indicating heat stress in buffaloes. The present study was carried out to delineate THI range to indicate onset and severity of heat stress in buffaloes based on physiological, biochemical, and expression profiling of heat shock response (HSR) genes in animals at different THI. The result indicated early onset of heat stress in buffaloes as compared to cattle. Physiological and biochemical parameters indicated onset of mild signs of heat stress in buffaloes at THI 68-69. Significant deviation in these parameters was again observed at THI range 73-76. At THI 77-80, the physiological and biochemical responses of animals were further intensified indicating extreme alteration in homeostasis. The in vivo expression profiling of HSR genes indicated that members of Hsp70 gene family are expressed in a temporal pattern over different THIs, whereas expressions of Hsf genes were evident during intense heat stress. Overall, the study established that amplitude of heat shock response and THI range for indicating severity of thermal stress for buffaloes are not in unison to cattle. The study also suggests skin temperature of the poll region could be used as non-invasive tool for monitoring heat stress in dairy buffaloes.

Abstract: Summary
Targeted protein degradation refers to the use of small molecules that recruit a ubiquitin ligase to a target protein for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-dependent degradation. While degraders have been developed for many targets, key questions regarding degrader development and the consequences of acute pharmacological degradation remain, specifically for targets that exist in obligate multi-protein complexes. Here, we synthesize a pan-histone deacetylase (HDAC) degrader library for the chemo-proteomic exploration of acute degradation of a key class of chromatin-modifying enzymes. Using chemo-proteomics, we not only map the degradability of the zinc-dependent HDAC family identifying leads for targeting HDACs 1–8 and 10 but also explore important aspects of degrading epigenetic enzymes. We discover cell line-driven target specificity and that HDAC degradation often results in collateral loss of HDAC-containing repressive complexes. These findings potentially offer a new mechanism toward controlling chromatin structure, and our resource will facilitate accelerated degrader design and development for HDACs.

Abstract: For several decades, the somatic mutation theory (SMT) has been the dominant paradigm on cancer research, leading to the textbook notion that cancer is fundamentally a genetic disease. However, recent discoveries indicate that mutations, including “oncogenic” ones, are widespread in normal somatic cells, suggesting that mutations may be necessary but not sufficient for cancer to develop. Indeed, a fundamental but as yet unanswered question is whether or not the first step in oncogenesis corresponds to a mutational event. On the other hand, for some time, it has been acknowledged the important role in cancer progression of molecular processes that participate in buffering cellular stress. However, their role is considered secondary or complementary to that of putative oncogenic mutations. Here we present and discuss evidence that cancer may have its origin in epigenetic processes associated with cellular adaptation to stressful conditions, and so it could be a direct consequence of stress-buffering mechanisms that allow cells with aberrant phenotypes (not necessarily associated with genetic mutations) to survive and propagate within the organism. We put forward the hypothesis that there would be an inverse correlation between the activation threshold of the cellular stress responses (CSRs) and the risk of cancer, so that species or individuals with low-threshold CSRs will display a higher incidence or risk of cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Histone proteins are decorated with a combinatorially and numerically diverse set of biochemical modifications. Here, we describe a versatile and scalable approach which enables efficient characterization of histone modifications without the need for recombinant protein production. As proof-of-concept, we first use this system to rapidly profile the histone H3 and H4 residue writing specificities of the human histone acetyltransferase, p300. Subsequently, a large panel of commercially available anti-acetylation antibodies are screened for their specificities, identifying many suitable and unsuitable reagents. Furthermore, this approach enables efficient mapping of the large binary crosstalk space between acetylated residues on histones H3 and H4 and uncovers residue interdependencies affecting p300 activity. These results show that using yeast surface display to study histone modifications is a useful tool that can advance our understanding of chromatin biology by enabling efficient interrogation of the complexity of epigenome modifications.

Abstract: Summary
Histone variants contribute to the complexity of the chromatin landscape and play an integral role in defining DNA domains and regulating gene expression. The histone H3 variant H3.3 is incorporated into genic elements independent of DNA replication by its chaperone HIRA. Here we demonstrate that Hira is required for the self-renewal of adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and to restrain erythroid differentiation. Deletion of Hira led to rapid depletion of HSCs while differentiated hematopoietic cells remained largely unaffected. Depletion of HSCs after Hira deletion was accompanied by increased expression of bivalent and erythroid genes, which was exacerbated upon cell division and paralleled increased erythroid differentiation. Assessing H3.3 occupancy identified a subset of polycomb-repressed chromatin in HSCs that depends on HIRA to maintain the inaccessible, H3.3-occupied state for gene repression. HIRA-dependent H3.3 incorporation thus defines distinct repressive chromatin that represses erythroid differentiation of HSCs.

Abstract: Dendritic cells are one of the most popular immune cells, which plays a remarkable role in both immunotherapy and tolerance induction. Due to unwanted side effects of leukocyte presence in donated blood, the policy of blood service is the pre-storage reduction of leukocytes, which today, filtration is the most common method for this purpose. The filtration method has led to diminished access to Buffy coat as a generally used conventional source of biological cells. We developed a simple, affordable, and reproducible method for dendritic cell differentiation from filter-derived monocytes and, the results of the filter study were compared with differentiated DCs from the conventional buffy coat-derived monocytes. The Monocytes were recovered from leukoreduction filter using an optimized protocol with supplemented PBS buffer. Following the adhesion method, CD14+ Monocyte-enriched population with the purity of 94 % was obtained. After cytokine stimulation over a 6-day period and maturation induction by LPS, differentiated DCs were evaluated for morphology, surface markers (CD86, CD40, CD83 and, HLA-DR), antigen uptake potency and IL-12 secretion. Analysis and comparison of the results represented no significant difference between the two groups. Accordingly, we conclude that leukoreduction filters could be introduced as a reliable and research-grade source of monocyte for DC generation in biological research.

Abstract: Immune cells not only constitute tumour microenvironment but they may even affect disease prognosis as a result of dual functional roles that they may play in tumour tissues. Two frequently used established immune cell lines (lymphocytic Jurkat and monocytic THP-1) were used to test whether microenvironmental factors, especially molecular components of extracellular matrix, can shape the phenotype of immune cells. Proliferation, morphological and phenotypical analyses were applied to compare behaviour of the immune cells, typically cultured as suspensions in culture medium, with their behaviour in collagen type I-based and Matrigel-based 3D cultures. Density of both immune cell types in routine suspension cultures affected their subsequent proliferation in extracellular matrices. THP-1 cells appeared to be more sensitive to their surrounding microenvironment as judged from extracellular matrix type-dependent changes in their cell doubling times and from slight increase in their diameters in both extracellular matrix-containing cell cultures. Moreover, even chemically uninduced monocytic THP-1 cells were present in a minor fraction as CD68 positive cell population in collagen type I matrix indicating their partial differentiation to macrophages. Observed modifications of immune cells by microenvironmental factors may have profound implications for their roles in healthy and pathological tissues.

Abstract: Summary
Toxoplasma gondii translocates effector proteins into its host cell to subvert various host pathways. T. gondii effector TgIST blocks the transcription of interferon-stimulated genes to reduce immune defense. Interferons upregulate numerous genes, including protein kinase R (PKR), which induce necrosome formation to activate mixed-lineage-kinase-domain-like (MLKL) pseudokinase and induce necroptosis. Whether these interferon functions are targeted by Toxoplasma is unknown. Here, we examine secreted effectors that localize to the host cell nucleus and find that the chronic bradyzoite stage secretes effector TgNSM that targets the NCoR/SMRT complex, a repressor for various transcription factors, to inhibit interferon-regulated genes involved in cell death. TgNSM acts with TgIST to block IFN-driven expression of PKR and MLKL, thus preventing host cell necroptotic death and protecting the parasite’s intracellular niche. The mechanism of action of TgNSM uncovers a role of NCoR/SMRT in necroptosis, assuring survival of intracellular cysts and chronic infection.

Abstract: Body fat depots are heterogeneous concerning their embryonic origin, structure, exposure to environmental stressors, and availability. Thus, investigating adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ASCs) from different sources is essential to standardization for future therapies. In vitro amplification is also critical because it may predispose cell senescence and mutations, reducing regenerative properties and safety. Here, we evaluated long-term culture of human facial ASCs (fASCs) and abdominal ASCs (aASCs) and showed that both met the criteria for MSCs characterization but presented differences in their immunophenotypic profile, and differentiation and clonogenic potentials. The abdominal tissue yielded more ASCs, and these had higher proliferative potential, but facial cells displayed fewer mitotic errors at higher passages. However, both cell types reduced clonal efficiency over time and entered replicative senescence around P12, as evaluated by progressive morphological alterations, reduced proliferative capacity, and SA-β-galactosidase expression. Loss of genetic integrity was detected by a higher proportion of cells showing nuclear alterations and γ-H2AX expression. Our findings indicate that the source of ASCs can substantially influence their phenotype and therefore should be carefully considered in future cell therapies, avoiding, however, long-term culture to ensure genetic stability.

Abstract: Electric field (EF) directed cell migration (electrotaxis) is known to occur in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and neural stem cells, with key signalling pathways frequently dysregulated in GBM. One such pathway is EGFR/PI3K/Akt, which is down-regulated by peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonists. We investigated the effect of electric fields on primary differentiated and glioma stem cell (GSCs) migration, finding opposing preferences for anodal and cathodal migration, respectively. We next sought to determine whether chemically disrupting Akt through PTEN upregulation with the PPARγ agonist, pioglitazone, would modulate electrotaxis of these cells. We found that directed cell migration was significantly inhibited with the addition of pioglitazone in both differentiated GBM and GSCs subtypes. Western blot analysis did not demonstrate any change in PPARγ expression with and without exposure to EF. In summary we demonstrate opposing EF responses in primary GBM differentiated cells and GSCs can be inhibited chemically by pioglitazone, implicating GBM EF modulation as a potential target in preventing tumour recurrence.

Abstract: The interleukin-33 (IL-33)/suppression of tumorigenicity 2 (ST2) pathway modulates immune response and inflammation, associated with allograft dysfunction and rejection. We hypothesized that IL-33/ST2 is a marker of renal allograft rejection and IL-33/ST2 expression may differ according to rejection type. IL-33/ST2 expression was measured in sera and kidney tissues from recipients with acute antibody-mediated rejection (AAMR), acute cell-mediated rejection (ACMR), chronic antibody-mediated rejection (CAMR), and healthy controls. The soluble ST2 and IL-33/ST2 expression levels were higher in participants with all three rejection types than in controls. Although the expression levels in recipients with AAMR and ACMR were significantly higher than those with CAMR, there was no significant difference between the expression levels in AAMR and ACMR. Although IL-33, IL-8, and fibronectin expression were significantly increased after the addition of the recipients’ serum in primary cultured human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells, the levels decreased after treatment with an anti-ST2 antibody. Furthermore, the anti-ST2 antibody specifically suppressed the upregulation of the mixed lymphocyte reaction. Boyden chamber assays demonstrated that anti-ST2 antibody abrogated chemotaxis induced by recombinant IL-33. Thus, IL-33 and ST2 are potent mediators of rejection. Treatment with an anti-ST2 antibody ameliorates rejection and could be a potential therapeutic strategy for renal allograft rejection.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in HPRT1, a gene encoding a rate-limiting enzyme for purine salvage, cause Lesch-Nyhan disease which is characterized by self-injury and motor impairments. We leveraged stem cell and genetic engineering technologies to model the disease in isogenic and patient-derived forebrain and midbrain cell types. Dopaminergic progenitor cells deficient in HPRT showed decreased intensity of all developmental cell-fate markers measured. Metabolic analyses revealed significant loss of all purine derivatives, except hypoxanthine, and impaired glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. real-time glucose tracing demonstrated increased shunting to the pentose phosphate pathway for de novo purine synthesis at the expense of ATP production. Purine depletion in dopaminergic progenitor cells resulted in loss of RHEB, impairing mTORC1 activation. These data demonstrate dopaminergic-specific effects of purine salvage deficiency and unexpectedly reveal that dopaminergic progenitor cells are programmed to a high-energy state prior to higher energy demands of terminally differentiated cells.

Abstract: Summary
Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and macrophages derived from them are increasingly popular tools for research into both infectious and degenerative diseases. However, as the field strives for greater modeling accuracy, it is becoming ever more challenging to justify the use of undefined and proprietary media for the culture of these cells. Here, we describe a defined, serum-free, open-source medium for the differentiation of iPSC-derived macrophages. This medium is equally capable of maintaining these cells compared with commercial alternatives. The macrophages differentiated in this medium display improved terminally differentiated cell characteristics, reduced basal expression of induced antiviral response genes, and improved polarization capacity. We conclude that cells cultured in this medium are an appropriate and malleable model for tissue-resident macrophages, on which future differentiation techniques can be built.

Abstract: The activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) plays a key role in the occurrence of liver fibrosis，and promoting the apoptosis of activated HSCs or reducing the number of activated HSCs can reverse the development of liver fibrosis. In our previous studies, we have demonstrated that the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBP-α) played an important role in promoting the apoptosis of activated HSCs, thereby exerting an anti-liver fibrosis effect. Unlike apoptosis, autophagy, as a caspase-independent programmed cell death, can promptly remove the abnormal accumulation of substances or damaged organelles in cells and play a key role in regulating the homeostasis of intracellular environment. However, it is still unclear whether C/EBP-α participates in the occurrence of autophagy in HSCs. Therefore, in this study, we firstly used the methods of Western blot and immunofluorescence to characterize the consequence of C/EBP-α overexpression on the expression of proteins LC3B, P62, ATG5 and Beclin1 which were related to autophagy in HSCs. Subsequently, we performed Western blot and site-directed mutagenesis methods to clarify the type and related mechanism of autophagy which was induced by C/EBP-α. Here we show that C/EBP-α promotes the occurrence of autophagy in HSCs and the autophagy induced by C/EBP-α belongs to mitophagy. The stability of C/EBP-α protein regulates the level of autophagy in HSCs. In addition, acetylation of C/EBP-α also regulates the occurrence of autophagy in HSCs. Acetylation of lysine at positions K298, K302 and K326 of C/EBP-α promotes its binding to Beclin1. In conclusion, our study uncovers the role of C/EBP-α in regulating autophagy in HSCs, thereby providing a new strategy for clinical treatment of liver fibrosis.

Abstract: Hsp110s are unique and essential molecular chaperones in the eukaryotic cytosol. They play important roles in maintaining cellular protein homeostasis. Candida albicans is the most prevalent yeast opportunistic pathogen that causes fungal infections in humans. As the only Hsp110 in Candida albicans, Msi3 is essential for the growth and infection of Candida albicans. In this study, we have expressed and purified Msi3 in nucleotide-free state and carried out biochemical analyses. Sse1 is the major Hsp110 in budding yeast S. cerevisiae and the best characterized Hsp110. Msi3 can substitute Sse1 in complementing the temperature-sensitive phenotype of S. cerevisiae carrying a deletion of SSE1 gene although Msi3 shares only 63.4% sequence identity with Sse1. Consistent with this functional similarity, the purified Msi3 protein shares many similar biochemical activities with Sse1 including binding ATP with high affinity, changing conformation upon ATP binding, stimulating the nucleotide-exchange for Hsp70, preventing protein aggregation, and assisting Hsp70 in refolding denatured luciferase. These biochemical characterizations suggested that Msi3 can be used as a model for studying the molecular mechanisms of Hsp110s.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a frequent therapeutic approach to restore hematopoiesis in patients with hematologic diseases. Patients receive a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-enriched donor cell infusion also containing immune cells, which may have a beneficial effect by eliminating residual neoplastic cells. However, the effect that donor innate immune cells may have on the donor HSCs has not been deeply explored. Here, we evaluate the influence of donor natural killer (NK) cells on HSC fate, concluded that NK cells negatively affect HSC frequency and function, and identified interferon-gamma (IFNγ) as a potential mediator. Interestingly, improved HSC fitness was achieved by NK cell depletion from murine and human donor infusions or by blocking IFNγ activity. Thus, our data suggest that suppression of inflammatory signals generated by donor innate immune cells can enhance engraftment and hematopoietic reconstitution during HSCT, which is particularly critical when limited HSC numbers are available and the risk of engraftment failure is high.

Abstract: Fibrosis of the vocal folds poses a substantive clinical challenge potentially underlying the rapid proliferation of direct steroid injections into the upper airway. The variable clinical response to glucocorticoids (GCs) in the vocal folds is likely related to diversity inherent to GCs and patient-specific, and upstream, cell-specific responses to GCs. Broadly, we hypothesize the disparity in clinical outcomes are due to undesirable effects of GCs on resident fibroblasts. Transcriptome analysis identified significant GC-mediated modulation of Hippo signaling, a known regulator of fibrotic gene expression. Subsequent analysis confirmed GC-mediated YAP activation, a transcriptional co-factor in the Hippo signaling pathway. YAP inhibition attenuated ACTA2 expression in GC-treated human vocal fold fibroblasts. Nuclear localization and phosphorylation at Ser211, however, was not affected by YAP inhibition, suggesting nuclear translocation of YAP is indirectly driven by GR. RNA-seq analysis confirmed the influence of GCs on Wnt signaling, and canonical Wnt signaling target genes were upregulated by GCs. These data implicate YAP and its downstream targets as putative mediators of a pro-fibrotic response to GCs. Therapeutic YAP inhibition may ultimately be clinically relevant and warrants further consideration.

Abstract: Plasmodium falciparum is the most lethal malaria parasite. The present study investigates the interaction capabilities of select plant derivatives, iso-mukaadial acetate (IMA) and ursolic acid acetate (UAA), against P. falciparum Hsp70-1 (PfHsp70-1) using in vitro approaches. PfHsp70-1 facilitates protein folding in the parasite and is deemed a prospective antimalarial drug target. Recombinant PfHsp70-1 protein was expressed in E. coli BL21 cells and homogeneously purified by affinity chromatography. The interaction between the compounds and PfHsp70-1 was evaluated using malate dehydrogenase (MDH), and luciferase aggregation assay, ATPase activity assay, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR). PfHsp70-1 prevented the heat-induced aggregation of MDH and luciferase. However, the PfHsp70-1 chaperone role was inhibited by IMA or UAA, leading to both MDH and luciferase’s thermal aggregation. The basal ATPase activity of PfHsp70-1 (0.121 nmol/min/mg) was closer to UAA (0.131 nmol/min/mg) (p = 0.0675) at 5mM compound concentration, suggesting that UAA has no effect on PfHsp70-1 ATPase activity. However, ATPase activity inhibition was similar between IMA (0.068 nmol/min/mg) (p < 0.0001) and polymyxin B (0.083 nmol/min/mg) (p < 0.0001). The lesser the Pi values, the lesser ATP hydrolysis observed due to compound binding to the ATPase domain. FTIR spectra analysis of IMA and UAA resulted in PfHsp70-1 structural alteration for β-sheets shifting the amide I band from 1637 cm−1 to 1639 cm−1, and for α-helix from 1650 cm−1 to 1652 cm−1, therefore depicting secondary structural changes with an increase in secondary structure percentage suggesting that these compounds interact with PfHsp70-1.

Abstract: The tyrosine kinase Src is highly expressed in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and ESC-differentiated cells, however, its functional role remains obscured. Here, we constitutivelyexpressed Src in mouse ESCs and found these cells retained comparable levels of the core pluripotent factors, such as Oct4 and Sox2, while promoted the expression of epiblast lineage markers and restrained trophoblast lineage markers compared to the control ESCs. Knockdown of Src in mouse ESCs showed the opposite effect. Directly differentiation of these ESCs to epiblast and trophoblast lineage cells revealed that Src activation dramatically accelerated the production of epiblast-like cells and inhibited the induction of trophoblast-like cells in vitro. Mechanistically, we found Src activation enhanced the Yap1-Tead interaction and their transcriptional output in mouse ESCs through specially upregulating Yap1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Subsequently, we found that overexpression of Yap1 in mouse ESCs phenocopied the differentiation patterns of Src overexpressing cells in vitro. Moreover, inhibition of Src kinase activity by Dasatinib or Yap1/Tead-mediated transcription with Verteporfin reversed the differentiation patterns of Src overexpressing ESCs. Taken together, our results unravel a novel Src-Yap1 regulatory axis during mouse ESC differentiation to trophectoderm and epiblast lineage cells in vitro.

Abstract: Summary
Bacterial ADP-ribosyltransferases (ADPRTs) have been described as toxins involved in pathogenesis through the modification of host proteins. Here, we report that ADPRTs are not pathogen restricted but widely prevalent in the human gut microbiome and often associated with phage elements. We validated their biochemical activity in a large clinical isolate collection and further examined Bxa, a highly abundant ADPRT in Bacteroides. Bxa is expressed, secreted, and enzymatically active in Bacteroides and can ADP-ribosylate non-muscle myosin II proteins. Addition of Bxa to epithelial cells remodeled the actin cytoskeleton and induced secretion of inosine. Bxa-encoding B. stercoris can use inosine as a carbon source and colonizes the gut to significantly greater numbers than a bxa-deleted strain in germ-free and altered Schaedler flora (ASF) mice. Colonization correlated with increased inosine concentrations in the feces and tissues. Altogether, our results show that ADPRTs are abundant in the microbiome and act as bacterial fitness factors.

Abstract: Summary
The development of the visual system involves the coordination of spatial and temporal events to specify the organization of varied cell types, including the elongation of axons from retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) to post-synaptic targets in the brain. Retinal organoids recapitulate many features of retinal development, yet have lacked downstream targets into which RGC axons extend, limiting the ability to model projections of the human visual system. To address these issues, retinal organoids were generated and organized into an in vitro assembloid model of the visual system with cortical and thalamic organoids. RGCs responded to environmental cues and extended axons deep into assembloids, modeling the projections of the visual system. In addition, RGC survival was enhanced in long-term assembloids, overcoming prior limitations of retinal organoids in which RGCs are lost. Overall, these approaches will facilitate studies of human visual system development, as well as diseases or injuries to this critical pathway.

Abstract: The resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors is currently a major problem for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) treatment and HSPA8 is highly expressed and a hallmark of poor prognosis in several human cancers. However, its role in imatinib-resistant CML (IR-CML) cells remains undetermined. Here, we determined HSPA8 was overexpressed in IR-CML cells and associated with imatinib resistance. HSPA8 ablation could downregulate BCR-ABL/STAT5 and BCR-ABL/AKT signaling pathways, dramatically induce proliferation inhibition, autophagy, G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest but not apoptosis in IR-CML cells. Significantly, HSPA8 ablation enhanced the antitumor activity of imatinib via promoting apoptosis in vitro and vivo. These findings unraveled that HSPA8 ablation inhibits proliferation via downregulating BCR-ABL and enhances chemosensitivity of imatinib in IR-CML cells, which investigate the role and molecular mechanism of HSPA8 in IR-CML cells and suggest that HSPA8 may be a potential target for IR-CML treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Serotonin (5-HT) neurons, the major components of the raphe nuclei, arise from ventral hindbrain progenitors. Based on anatomical location and axonal projection, 5-HT neurons are coarsely divided into rostral and caudal groups. Here, we propose a novel strategy to generate hindbrain 5-HT neurons from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), which involves the formation of ventral-type neural progenitor cells and stimulation of the hindbrain 5-HT neural development. A caudalizing agent, retinoid acid, was used to direct the cells into the hindbrain cell fate. Approximately 30%–40% of hPSCs successfully developed into 5-HT-expressing neurons using our protocol, with the majority acquiring a caudal rhombomere identity (r5–8). We further modified our monolayer differentiation system to generate 5-HT neuron-enriched hindbrain-like organoids. We also suggest downstream applications of our 5-HT monolayer and organoid cultures to study neuronal response to gut microbiota. Our methodology could become a powerful tool for future studies related to 5-HT neurotransmission.

Abstract: Summary
Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a deadly intestinal inflammatory disorder that primarily affects premature infants and lacks adequate therapeutics. Interleukin (IL)-22 plays a critical role in gut barrier maintenance, promoting epithelial regeneration, and controlling intestinal inflammation in adult animal models. However, the importance of IL-22 signaling in neonates during NEC remains unknown. We investigated the role of IL-22 in the neonatal intestine under homeostatic and inflammatory conditions by using a mouse model of NEC. Our data reveal that Il22 expression in neonatal murine intestine is negligible until weaning, and both human and murine neonates lack IL-22 production during NEC. Mice deficient in IL-22 or lacking the IL-22 receptor in the intestine display a similar susceptibility to NEC, consistent with the lack of endogenous IL-22 during development. Strikingly, treatment with recombinant IL-22 during NEC substantially reduces inflammation and enhances epithelial regeneration. These findings may provide a new therapeutic strategy to attenuate NEC.

Abstract: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were reported to be involved in tumorigenesis and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Microvascular invasion (MVI) is an independent predictor for early recurrence and overall survival in postoperative patients with HCC. However, the mechanisms how lncRNAs affect HCC and MVI remain elusive. By RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in a series of 65 HCC samples and 30 paired adjacent non-tumor liver tissue, we identified a novel lncRNA AC104958.2 that was significantly upregulated in HCC tissues and associated with MVI. Overexpression of AC104958.2 obviously elevated cell viability, metastasis, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), while knockout of AC104958.2 mediated by CRISPR/Cas9 technique showed the opposite effects. In addition, the interaction between AC104958.2 and Poly (rC) binding protein 2 (PCBP2) was identified by RNA pull down and mass spectrometry (MS), which was further validated by RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP). PCBP2 was also upregulated in HCC and associated with MVI. High expression of both AC104958.2 and PCBP2 was correlated with tumor size, TNM stage and MVI in HCC. Overexpression of PCBP2 greatly increased the cell viability, metastasis, invasion and EMT. Moreover, actinomycin D assay showed that overexpression of PCBP2 enhanced the RNA stability of AC104958.2. In conclusion, our study showed that a novel lncRNA AC104958.2 exerted oncogenic roles in HCC and might be a promising biomarker and therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a rare disease associated with high morbidity and mortality. Existing evidence suggests that the central pathogenesis to aHUS might be endothelial cell damage. Nevertheless, the role of endothelial cell alterations in aHUS has not been well characterized and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Utilizing an induced pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cell (iPSC-EC) model, we showed that anti-complement factor H autoantibody-associated aHUS patient-specific iPSC-ECs exhibited an intrinsic defect in endothelial functions. Stimulation using aHUS serums exacerbated endothelial dysfunctions, leading to cell apoptosis in iPSC-ECs. Importantly, we identified p38 as a novel signaling pathway contributing to endothelial dysfunctions in aHUS. These results illustrate that iPSC-ECs can be a reliable model to recapitulate EC pathological features, thus providing a unique platform for gaining mechanistic insights into EC injury in aHUS. Our findings highlight that the p38 MAPK signaling pathway can be a therapeutic target for treatment of aHUS.

Abstract: The osteogenic and odontogenic differentiation of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) contribute to restoration and regeneration of dental tissue. Previous study indicated that interleukin-37 (IL-37) was an anti-inflammatory factor that affected other pro-inflammatory signals. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of IL-37 on the differentiation of DPSCs. DPSCs were cultured in growth medium with different concentrations of IL-37. We selected the optimal concentration for the following experiments by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity analysis, quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot. Cell counting kit assay (CCK-8) and 5-Ethynyl-2ʹ-Deoxyuridine (EdU) assay were conducted to assess the effects of IL-37 on the proliferation of DPSCs. ALP activity assay and staining, alizarin red S (ARS) staining, qRT‐PCR, Western blot as well as immunofluorescence staining were conducted to assess differentiation ability of DPSCs. Western blot, immunofluorescence staining and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were utilized to examine cell autophagy. Results showed that IL-37 enhanced the osteogenic and odontogenic differentiation ability of DPSCs with no significant influence on the proliferation of DPSCs. Autophagy in DPSCs was activated by IL-37. Activation of autophagy enhanced osteogenesis and odontogenesis of DPSCs, whereas inhibition of autophagy suppressed DPSCs osteogenic and odontogenic differentiation. In conclusion, IL-37 increased osteogenic and odontogenic differentiation via autophagy.
