Abstract: Summary
Peripheral inflammation has been linked to various neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Here we perform bulk, single-cell, and spatial transcriptomics in APP/PS1 mice intranasally exposed to Staphylococcus aureus to determine how low-grade peripheral infection affects brain transcriptomics and AD-like pathology. Chronic exposure led to increased amyloid plaque burden and plaque-associated microglia, significantly affecting the transcription of brain barrier-associated cells, which resulted in barrier leakage. We reveal cell-type- and spatial-specific transcriptional changes related to brain barrier function and neuroinflammation during the acute infection. Both acute and chronic exposure led to brain macrophage-associated responses and detrimental effects in neuronal transcriptomics. Finally, we identify unique transcriptional responses at the amyloid plaque niches following acute infection characterized by higher disease-associated microglia gene expression and a larger effect on astrocytic or macrophage-associated genes, which could facilitate amyloid and related pathologies. Our findings provide important insights into the mechanisms linking peripheral inflammation to AD pathology.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreatic β cells display functional and transcriptional heterogeneity in health and disease. The sequence of events leading to β cell heterogeneity during metabolic stress is poorly understood. Here, we characterize β cell responses to early metabolic stress in vivo by employing RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq), single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), and real-time imaging to decipher temporal events of chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulating the unfolded protein response (UPR), protein synthesis, mitochondrial function, and cell-cycle progression. We demonstrate that a subpopulation of β cells with active UPR, decreased protein synthesis, and insulin secretary capacities is more susceptible to proliferation after insulin depletion. Alleviation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress precedes the progression of the cell cycle and mitosis and ensures appropriate insulin synthesis. Furthermore, metabolic stress rapidly activates key transcription factors including FoxM1, which impacts on proliferative and quiescent β cells by regulating protein synthesis, ER stress, and mitochondrial activity via direct repression of mitochondrial-encoded genes.

Abstract: Summary
Numerous proteins are targeted to two or multiple subcellular destinations where they exert distinct functional consequences. The balance between such differential targeting is thought to be determined post-translationally, relying on protein sorting mechanisms. Here, we show that mRNA location and translation rate can also determine protein targeting by modulating protein binding to specific interacting partners. Peripheral localization of the NET1 mRNA and fast translation lead to higher cytosolic retention of the NET1 protein by promoting its binding to the membrane-associated scaffold protein CASK. By contrast, perinuclear mRNA location and/or slower translation rate favor nuclear targeting by promoting binding to importins. This mRNA location-dependent mechanism is modulated by physiological stimuli and profoundly impacts NET1 function in cell motility. These results reveal that the location of protein synthesis and the rate of translation elongation act in coordination as a “partner-selection” mechanism that robustly influences protein distribution and function.

Abstract: Summary
DNA methylation plays a critical role in establishing and maintaining cellular identity. However, it is frequently dysregulated during tumor development and is closely intertwined with other genetic alterations. Here, we leveraged multi-omic profiling of 687 tumors and matched non-involved adjacent tissues from the kidney, brain, pancreas, lung, head and neck, and endometrium to identify aberrant methylation associated with RNA and protein abundance changes and build a Pan-Cancer catalog. We uncovered lineage-specific epigenetic drivers including hypomethylated FGFR2 in endometrial cancer. We showed that hypermethylated STAT5A is associated with pervasive regulon downregulation and immune cell depletion, suggesting that epigenetic regulation of STAT5A expression constitutes a molecular switch for immunosuppression in squamous tumors. We further demonstrated that methylation subtype-enrichment information can explain cell-of-origin, intra-tumor heterogeneity, and tumor phenotypes. Overall, we identified cis-acting DNA methylation events that drive transcriptional and translational changes, shedding light on the tumor’s epigenetic landscape and the role of its cell-of-origin.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial morphology is regulated by the post-translational modifications of the dynamin family GTPase proteins including mitofusin 1 (MFN1), MFN2, and dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1). Mitochondrial phosphatase phosphoglycerate mutase 5 (PGAM5) is emerging as a regulator of these post-translational modifications; however, its precise role in the regulation of mitochondrial morphology is unknown. We show that PGAM5 interacts with MFN2 and DRP1 in a stress-sensitive manner. PGAM5 regulates MFN2 phosphorylation and consequently protects it from ubiquitination and degradation. Further, phosphorylation and dephosphorylation modification of MFN2 regulates its fusion ability. Phosphorylation enhances fission and degradation, whereas dephosphorylation enhances fusion. PGAM5 dephosphorylates MFN2 to promote mitochondrial network formation. Further, using a Drosophila genetic model, we demonstrate that the MFN2 homolog Marf and dPGAM5 are in the same biological pathway. Our results identify MFN2 dephosphorylation as a regulator of mitochondrial fusion and PGAM5 as an MFN2 phosphatase.

Abstract: One of the main causes of cancer mortality in the world is pancreatic cancer. Therapies based on stem cells are currently thought to be a hopeful option in the treatment of cancer. Herein, we intend to evaluate the antitumor effects of secretome of human amniotic mesenchymal stromal cells (hAMSCs) on autophagy and cell death induction in Panc1 pancreatic cancer cells. We adopted a co-culture system using Transwell 6-well plates and after 72 h, hAMSCs-treated Panc1 cancer cells were analyzed using quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR), flow cytometry, western blot, MTT assay, and DAPI staining. Based on our results, the microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) conversion from LC3-I to LC3-II and the upregulation of autophagy-related proteins expression including Beclin1, Atg7, and Atg12 were detected in hAMSCs-treated Panc1 cells. Furthermore, the level of phosphorylated proteins such as Unc-51–like kinase 1 (ULK1), AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), AKT, and mTOR changed. Apoptotic cell death was also induced via the elevation of Bax and Caspase 3 expression and inhibition of Bcl-2. Our findings showed that secretome of hAMSCs induces autophagy and cell death in Panc1 cancer cells. However, more experiments will be needed to identify more details about the associated mechanisms.

Abstract: Diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, reportedly targets mitochondria and induces nephrotoxicity via reactive oxygen species. However, there are few detailed reports of pathological analyses of mitochondria and the factors that cause acute kidney injury (AKI) as a result of nephrotoxicity. In this study, we investigated mitochondrial damage in the proximal tubule in AKI mice at 6, 12, and 24 h after administration of diclofenac. Statistical analysis of immunohistochemistry results confirmed that expression of p62 and LC3, which is associated with autophagy, reached a maximum level in the degenerated proximal renal tubule 12 h after diclofenac treatment, with high autophagy activity. Electron microscopy images provided clear evidence that confirmed mitochondrial degeneration and injury as well as autophagy (mitophagy) in mitochondria treated with diclofenac. The purpose of this study was to pathologically characterize both mitochondrial damage in the proximal renal tubules induced by diclofenac and the course of mitophagy to remove the damaged mitochondria. This report provides important information regarding mitochondrial damage in the proximal tubules in diclofenac-induced nephropathy.

Abstract: Summary
Conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) are found in most tissues and play a key role in initiation of immunity. cDCs require constant replenishment from progenitors called pre-cDCs that develop in the bone marrow (BM) and enter the blood circulation to seed all tissues. This process can be markedly accelerated in response to inflammation (emergency cDCpoiesis). Here, we identify two populations of BM pre-cDC marked by differential expression of CXCR4. We show that CXCR4lo cells constitute the migratory pool of BM pre-cDCs, which exits the BM and can be rapidly mobilized during challenge. We further show that exit of CXCR4lo pre-cDCs from BM at steady state is partially dependent on CCR2 and that CCR2 upregulation in response to type I IFN receptor signaling markedly increases efflux during infection with influenza A virus. Our results highlight a fine balance between retention and efflux chemokine cues that regulates steady-state and emergency cDCpoiesis.

Abstract: Summary
Faithful DNA replication requires that cells fine-tune their histone pool in coordination with cell-cycle progression. Replication-dependent histone biosynthesis is initiated at a low level upon cell-cycle commitment, followed by a burst at the G1/S transition, but it remains unclear how exactly the cell regulates this burst in histone biosynthesis as DNA replication begins. Here, we use single-cell time-lapse imaging to elucidate the mechanisms by which cells modulate histone production during different phases of the cell cycle. We find that CDK2-mediated phosphorylation of NPAT at the restriction point triggers histone transcription, which results in a burst of histone mRNA precisely at the G1/S phase boundary. Excess soluble histone protein further modulates histone abundance by promoting the degradation of histone mRNA for the duration of S phase. Thus, cells regulate their histone production in strict coordination with cell-cycle progression by two distinct mechanisms acting in concert.

Abstract: Summary
The C allele of rs11136000 variant in the clusterin (CLU) gene represents the third strongest known genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease. However, whether this single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is functional and what the underlying mechanisms are remain unclear. In this study, the CLU rs11136000 SNP is identified as a functional variant by a small-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screen. Astrocytes derived from isogenic induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) carrying the “C” or “T” allele of the CLU rs11136000 SNP exhibit different CLU expression levels. TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) preferentially binds to the “C” allele to promote CLU expression and exacerbate inflammation. The interferon response and CXCL10 expression are elevated in cytokine-treated C/C astrocytes, leading to inhibition of oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) proliferation and myelination. Accordingly, elevated CLU and CXCL10 but reduced myelin basic protein (MBP) expression are detected in human brains of C/C carriers. Our study uncovers a mechanism underlying reduced white matter integrity observed in the CLU rs11136000 risk “C” allele carriers.

Abstract: Summary
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) of mRNAs modulated by the METTL3-METTL14-WTAP-RBM15 methyltransferase complex and m6A demethylases such as FTO play important roles in regulating mRNA stability, splicing, and translation. Here, we demonstrate that FTO-IT1 long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) was upregulated and positively correlated with poor survival of patients with wild-type p53-expressing prostate cancer (PCa). m6A RIP-seq analysis revealed that FTO-IT1 knockout increased mRNA m6A methylation of a subset of p53 transcriptional target genes (e.g., FAS, TP53INP1, and SESN2) and induced PCa cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We further showed that FTO-IT1 directly binds RBM15 and inhibits RBM15 binding, m6A methylation, and stability of p53 target mRNAs. Therapeutic depletion of FTO-IT1 restored mRNA m6A level and expression of p53 target genes and inhibited PCa growth in mice. Our study identifies FTO-IT1 lncRNA as a bona fide suppressor of the m6A methyltransferase complex and p53 tumor suppression signaling and nominates FTO-IT1 as a potential therapeutic target of cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway is a major mediator of inflammation following stimulation with >45 bp double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). Herein, we identify a class of ∼20–40 bp small cytosolic dsDNA (scDNA) molecules that compete with long dsDNA (200–1,500 bp herring testis [HT]-DNA) for binding to cGAS, thus repressing HT-DNA-induced cGAS activation. The scDNA promotes cGAS and Beclin-1 interaction, releasing Rubicon, a negative regulator of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase class III (PI3KC3), from the Beclin-1-PI3KC3 complex. This leads to PI3KC3 activation and induces autophagy, causing degradation of STING and long cytosolic dsDNA. Moreover, DNA damage decreases, and autophagy inducers increase scDNA levels. scDNA transfection and treatment with autophagy inducers attenuate DNA damage-induced cGAS activation. Thus, scDNA molecules serve as effective brakes for cGAS activation, preventing excessive inflammatory cytokine production following DNA damage. Our findings may have therapeutic implications for cytosolic DNA-associated inflammatory diseases.

Abstract: Background
FOXM1 is a transcription factor confirmed by studies to promote the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and various other cancers, yet the molecular mechanism remains rather enigmatic. This study attempted to unveil the function and regulatory mechanism of FOXM1 in the progression of HCC.
Methods
Bioinformatics methods first analyzed the expression of FOXM1 in HCC tissues and then screened target genes downstream of FOXM1. Possible pathways of the target gene were specified through Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). After using qRT-PCR to measure the expression of FOXM1 and its downstream regulatory gene SETDB1 in HCC tissues, ChIP and dual-luciferase assays were employed and verified the binding relationship between FOXM1 and the promoter of SETDB1. Then the effects of the FOXM1/SETDB1/Wnt pathway on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells were profiled by CCK-8, colony formation, wound healing, and transwell assays. WNT and EMT-related protein expression levels were detected by western blot and immunofluorescence assay, respectively.
Results
The bioinformatics prediction showed that SETDB1 was the target downstream of FOXM1, and their binding relationship was verified by ChIP and dual-luciferase assays. Cell experiments showed that FOXM1 could enhance the proliferative, migratory, and invasive abilities of HCC cells through binding to SETDB1. Rescue assay suggested that the activation of key genes of the WNT pathway and EMT-related genes were part of the regulatory mechanism that FOXM1 bound to SETDB1.
Conclusion
This study found that FOXM1 could bind with SETDB1 and hence activate the WNT signaling pathway to promote the malignant progression of HCC. It indicated that FOXM1 could be the possible target for treating HCC.

Abstract: Summary
Foxp3 is the master transcription factor for regulatory T cells (Tregs). Alternative splicing of human Foxp3 results in the expression of two isoforms: the full length and an exon 2-deleted protein. Here, AlphaFold2 predictions and in vitro experiments demonstrate that the N-terminal domain of Foxp3 inhibits DNA binding by moving toward the C terminus and that this movement is mediated by exon 2. Consequently, we find that Foxp3Δ2-bearing thymus-derived Tregs (tTregs) in the peripheral lymphoid organ are less sensitive to T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation due to the enhanced binding of Foxp3Δ2 to the Batf promoter and are hyporesponsive to interleukin-2 (IL-2). In contrast, among RORγt+ peripherally induced Tregs (pTregs) in the large intestine, Foxp3Δ2 pTregs express many more RORγt-related genes, conferring a competitive advantage. Together, our results reveal that alternative splicing of exon 2 generates an active form of Foxp3, which plays a differential role in regulating tTreg and pTreg homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Overproduction of lactate (LA) can occur during exercise and in many diseases such as cancers. Individuals with hyperlactatemia often display anemia, decreased serum iron, and elevated hepcidin, a key regulator of iron metabolism. However, it is unknown whether and how LA regulates hepcidin expression. Here, we show LA binds to soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) in normal hepatocytes and affects systemic iron homeostasis in mice by increasing hepcidin expression. Comprehensive in vitro, in vivo, and in silico experiments show that the LA-sAC interaction raises cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which activates the PKA-Smad1/5/8 signaling pathway to increase hepcidin transcription. We verified this regulatory axis in wild-type mice and in mice with disordered iron homeostasis. LA also regulates hepcidin in humans at rest and subjected to extensive exercise that produce elevated LA. Our study links hyperlactatemia to iron deficiency, offering a mechanistic explanation for anemias seen in athletes and patients with lactic acidosis.

Abstract: Summary
Temporal associative learning binds discontiguous conditional stimuli (CSs) and unconditional stimuli (USs), possibly by maintaining CS information in the hippocampus after its offset. Yet, how learning regulates such maintenance of CS information in hippocampal circuits remains largely unclear. Using the auditory trace fear conditioning (TFC) paradigm, we identify a projection from the CA1 to the subiculum critical for TFC. Deep-brain calcium imaging shows that the peak of trace activity in the CA1 and subiculum is extended toward the US and that the CS representation during the trace period is enhanced during learning. Interestingly, such plasticity is consolidated only in the CA1, not the subiculum, after training. Moreover, CA1 neurons, but not subiculum neurons, increasingly become active during CS-and-trace and shock periods, respectively, and correlate with CS-evoked fear retrieval afterward.

Abstract: Summary
How neuronal signaling affects brain myelination remains poorly understood. We show dysregulated neuronal RHEB-mTORC1-DLK1 axis impairs brain myelination. Neuronal Rheb cKO impairs oligodendrocyte differentiation/myelination, with activated neuronal expression of the imprinted gene Dlk1. Neuronal Dlk1 cKO ameliorates myelination deficit in neuronal Rheb cKO mice, indicating that activated neuronal Dlk1 expression contributes to impaired myelination caused by Rheb cKO. The effect of Rheb cKO on Dlk1 expression is mediated by mTORC1; neuronal mTor cKO and Raptor cKO and pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1 recapitulate elevated neuronal Dlk1 expression. We demonstrate that both a secreted form of DLK1 and a membrane-bound DLK1 inhibit the differentiation of cultured oligodendrocyte precursor cells into oligodendrocytes expressing myelin proteins. Finally, neuronal expression of Dlk1 in transgenic mice reduces the formation of mature oligodendrocytes and myelination. This study identifies Dlk1 as an inhibitor of oligodendrocyte myelination and a mechanism linking altered neuronal signaling with oligodendrocyte dysfunction.

Abstract: The exchange of biological material between the neighbouring cells is essential for homeostasis. In pathological conditions, such as cancer, the major challenge in cancer treatment is the abnormal expression of crucial proteins and miRNA exchanged between the cancer cells through extracellular vesicles called exosomes. Clinically, it has been noticed that the primary tumour and the distal metastases are interconnected and co-dependent. The exosomes are key factors responsible for preparing the pre-metastatic niche and communicating between the tumour and the distal metastatic site. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a subpopulation of cancer cells with self-renewal characteristics and are shown to be responsible for metastasis. This study aims to understand the effect of metastatic cell line-derived exosomes and their regulation of CSC marker expressions on primary colon cancer cell lines. We have identified that treatment of primary colon cancer cell lines with metastatic colon cancer cell-derived exosomes has significantly increased the proliferation, colony formation, cell migration, and invasion. In addition, there was a significant increase in the number and size of spheroids following the exosomes treatment. We found that this metastatic phenotype is due to the increased expression of CD133 and DCLK1 in primary colon cancer cells.

Abstract: Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) is the second most common head and neck cancer. To identify the link between ferroptosis and LSCC, we targeted the dual oxidase 1 (DUOX1) gene. This study aimed to reveal the intrinsic mechanism by which the DUOX1-zinc-finger CCCH domain-containing protein 13 (ZC3H13) ferroptosis axis affected the LSCC process. GEPIA was used to investigate the expression of DUOX1 in LSCC, and the expression levels of DUOX1 and ZC3H13 were manipulated by overexpression and RNA interference. MTT assay was used to detect cell proliferation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP) detected the binding of DUOX1 and ZC3H13, and ROS assessment and intracellular Fe2+ content determination were performed to examine the ferroptosis. MeRIP was used to analyze the m6A methylation of DUOX1. Ferroptosis-related proteins were detected by qRT-PCR. DUOX1 was found to be poorly expressed in LSCC cells, low DUOX1 level promoted LSCC cell proliferation, and low ZC3H13 level decreased LSCC cell proliferation. Besides, there was an interaction between DUOX1 and ZC3H13. DUOX1 could inhibit the expression levels of ferroptosis-related genes GPX4 and F1H1 in LSCC cells DUOX1 inhibited the expression levels of ROS and ferroptosis-related genes GPX4 and F1H1 and increased intracellular iron content in LSCC cells, but ZC3H13 reversed this phenomenon by inhibiting DUOX1 gene through m6A methylation modification. ZC3H13 reduced DUOX1-mediated ferroptosis in LSCC cells through m6A-dependent modification. The regulatory pathway of DUOX1 and ferroptosis are potential targets for designing diagnostic and combination therapeutic strategies for LSCC patients.

Abstract: Summary
To maintain genome integrity, cells must accurately duplicate their genome and repair DNA lesions when they occur. To uncover genes that suppress DNA damage in human cells, we undertook flow-cytometry-based CRISPR-Cas9 screens that monitored DNA damage. We identified 160 genes whose mutation caused spontaneous DNA damage, a list enriched in essential genes, highlighting the importance of genomic integrity for cellular fitness. We also identified 227 genes whose mutation caused DNA damage in replication-perturbed cells. Among the genes characterized, we discovered that deoxyribose-phosphate aldolase DERA suppresses DNA damage caused by cytarabine (Ara-C) and that GNB1L, a gene implicated in 22q11.2 syndrome, promotes biogenesis of ATR and related phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases (PIKKs). These results implicate defective PIKK biogenesis as a cause of some phenotypes associated with 22q11.2 syndrome. The phenotypic mapping of genes that suppress DNA damage therefore provides a rich resource to probe the cellular pathways that influence genome maintenance.

Abstract: Gastric cancer stem-like cells (GCSCs) possess stem cell properties, such as self-renewal and tumorigenicity, which are known to induce high chemoresistance and metastasis. These characteristics of GCSCs are further enhanced by autophagy, worsening the prognosis of patients. Currently, the mechanisms involved in the induction of stemness in GCSCs during autophagy remain unclear. In this study, we compared the cellular responses of GCSCs with those of gastric cancer intestinal cells (GCICs) whose stemness is not induced by autophagy. In response to glucose starvation, the levels of β-catenin and stemness-related genes were upregulated in GCSCs, while the levels of β-catenin declined in GCICs. The pattern of deubiquitinase ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L3 (UCH-L3) expression in GCSCs and GCICs was similar to that of β-catenin expression depending on glucose deprivation. We also observed that inhibition of UCH-L3 activity reduced β-catenin protein levels. The interaction between UCH-L3 and β-catenin proteins was confirmed, and it reduced the ubiquitination of β-catenin. Our results suggest that UCH-L3 induces the stabilization of β-catenin, which is required to promote stemness during autophagy activation. Also, UCH-L3 expression was regulated by c-Fos, and the levels of c-Fos increased in response to autophagy activation. In summary, our findings suggest that the inhibition of UCH-L3 during nutrient deprivation could suppress stress resistance of GCSCs and increase the survival rates of gastric cancer patients.

Abstract: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a key risk factor for the developing of metabolic liver injury and easily evolving to advanced fibrosis. Syringin (SYR), isolated from Acanthopanax senticosus, has anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-apoptotic properties. However, its hepatoprotective effects and mechanisms in T2DM-induced liver fibrosis remain unclear. Here, we investigated whether syringin (SYR) could serve as a therapeutic agent for liver fibrosis and its mechanism in high-fat diet (HFD)/streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 2 diabetic mice. C57BL/6 mice were induced with T2DM via HFD and STZ injection and treated with different doses of SYR. Serum lipid parameters and liver function indicators were measured, and hepatic histology and fibrosis were examined. The mechanism of SYR was explored through molecular analyses Results demonstrated SYR improved oral glucose tolerance, decreased the levels of ALT, AST, and AKP, and reduced hepatic lipid deposition in diabetic mice. Moreover, SYR ameliorated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition to reverse hepatic fibrosis via suppressing TRIB3-SMAD3 interaction to restrain nuclear localization of SMAD3. Strikingly, SYR reversed hyperglycemia-induced deficiency in autophagic flux by regulation of Raptor/mTORC1, triggering nuclear translocation of TFEB to improve autophagosome-lysosomal fusion. In brief, SYR potentially ameliorates hepatic injury and fibrosis by enhancing autophagic flux and inhibing TRIB3 activation in diabetic mice.

Abstract: Summary
Solute carrier spinster homolog 2 (SPNS2), one of only four known major facilitator superfamily (MFS) lysolipid transporters in humans, exports sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) across cell membranes. Here, we explore the synergistic effects of lipid binding and conformational dynamics on SPNS2’s transport mechanism. Using mass spectrometry, we discovered that SPNS2 interacts preferentially with PI(4,5)P2. Together with functional studies and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we identified potential PI(4,5)P2 binding sites. Mutagenesis of proposed lipid binding sites and inhibition of PI(4,5)P2 synthesis reduce S1P transport, whereas the absence of the N terminus renders the transporter essentially inactive. Probing the conformational dynamics of SPNS2, we show how synergistic binding of PI(4,5)P2 and S1P facilitates transport, increases dynamics of the extracellular gate, and stabilizes the intracellular gate. Given that SPNS2 transports a key signaling lipid, our results have implications for therapeutic targeting and also illustrate a regulatory mechanism for MFS transporters.

Abstract: Summary
For cells to perform their biological functions, they need to adopt specific shapes and form functionally distinct subcellular compartments. This is achieved in part via an asymmetric distribution of mRNAs within cells. Currently, the main model of mRNA localization involves specific sequences called “zipcodes” that direct mRNAs to their proper locations. However, while thousands of mRNAs localize within cells, only a few zipcodes have been identified, suggesting that additional mechanisms contribute to localization. Here, we assess the role of mRNA stability in localization by combining the isolation of the soma and neurites of mouse primary cortical and mESC-derived neurons, SLAM-seq, m6A-RIP-seq, the perturbation of mRNA destabilization mechanisms, and the analysis of multiple mRNA localization datasets. We show that depletion of mRNA destabilization elements, such as m6A, AU-rich elements, and suboptimal codons, functions as a mechanism that mediates the localization of mRNAs associated with housekeeping functions to neurites in several types of neurons.

Abstract: Summary
Coat protein complex I (COPI) is best known for its role in Golgi-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) trafficking, responsible for the retrograde transport of ER-resident proteins. The ER is crucial to neuronal function, regulating Ca2+ homeostasis and the distribution and function of other organelles such as endosomes, peroxisomes, and mitochondria via functional contact sites. Here we demonstrate that disruption of COPI results in mitochondrial dysfunction in Drosophila axons and human cells. The ER network is also disrupted, and the neurons undergo rapid degeneration. We demonstrate that mitochondria-ER contact sites (MERCS) are decreased in COPI-deficient axons, leading to Ca2+ dysregulation, heightened mitophagy, and a decrease in respiratory capacity. Reintroducing MERCS is sufficient to rescue not only mitochondrial distribution and Ca2+ uptake but also ER morphology, dramatically delaying neurodegeneration. This work demonstrates an important role for COPI-mediated trafficking in MERC formation, which is an essential process for maintaining axonal integrity.

Abstract: Summary
Germ granules, condensates of phase-separated RNA and protein, are organelles that are essential for germline development in different organisms. The patterning of the granules and their relevance for germ cell fate are not fully understood. Combining three-dimensional in vivo structural and functional analyses, we study the dynamic spatial organization of molecules within zebrafish germ granules. We find that the localization of RNA molecules to the periphery of the granules, where ribosomes are localized, depends on translational activity at this location. In addition, we find that the vertebrate-specific Dead end (Dnd1) protein is essential for nanos3 RNA localization at the condensates’ periphery. Accordingly, in the absence of Dnd1, or when translation is inhibited, nanos3 RNA translocates into the granule interior, away from the ribosomes, a process that is correlated with the loss of germ cell fate. These findings highlight the relevance of sub-granule compartmentalization for post-transcriptional control and its importance for preserving germ cell totipotency.

Abstract: Summary
Continuous color polymorphisms can serve as a tractable model for the genetic and developmental architecture of traits. Here we investigated continuous color variation in Colias eurytheme and Colias philodice, two species of sulphur butterflies that hybridize in sympatry. Using quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis and high-throughput color quantification, we found two interacting large-effect loci affecting orange-to-yellow chromaticity. Knockouts of red Malpighian tubules (red), likely involved in endosomal maturation, result in depigmented wing scales. Additionally, the transcription factor bric-a-brac can act as a modulator of orange pigmentation. We also describe the QTL architecture of other continuously varying traits, together supporting a large-X effect model where the genetic control of species-defining traits is enriched on sex chromosomes. This study sheds light on the range of possible genetic architectures that can underpin a continuously varying trait and illustrates the power of using automated measurement to score phenotypes that are not always conspicuous to the human eye.

Abstract: Summary
To identify addiction genes, we evaluate intravenous self-administration of cocaine or saline in 84 inbred and recombinant inbred mouse strains over 10 days. We integrate the behavior data with brain RNA-seq data from 41 strains. The self-administration of cocaine and that of saline are genetically distinct. We maximize power to map loci for cocaine intake by using a linear mixed model to account for this longitudinal phenotype while correcting for population structure. A total of 15 unique significant loci are identified in the genome-wide association study. A transcriptome-wide association study highlights the Trpv2 ion channel as a key locus for cocaine self-administration as well as identifying 17 additional genes, including Arhgef26, Slc18b1, and Slco5a1. We find numerous instances where alternate splice site selection or RNA editing altered transcript abundance. Our work emphasizes the importance of Trpv2, an ionotropic cannabinoid receptor, for the response to cocaine.

Abstract: Summary
Hedgehog signaling plays pivotal roles in the development and homeostasis of epithelial barrier tissues. However, whether and how Hedgehog signaling directly regulates innate immunity in epithelial cells remains unknown. By utilizing C. elegans epidermis as the model, we found that several Hedgehog receptors are involved in cell-autonomous regulation of the innate immune response in the epidermis. Particularly, loss of the Patched family receptor induces aberrant up-regulation of epidermal antimicrobial peptides in a STAT-dependent manner. External or internal insult to the epidermis triggers rapid rearrangement of Patched distribution along the plasma membrane, indicating that the Hedgehog (Hh) receptor is likely involved in recognition and defense against epidermal damage. Loss of PTCH1 function in primary human keratinocytes and intact mouse skin also results in STAT-dependent immune activation. These findings reveal an evolutionally conserved immune-surveillance function of Hedgehog receptors and an insult-sensing and response strategy of epithelial tissues.

Abstract: Summary
The metabolic prohormone pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) is generally translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for entry into the secretory pathway. Patients with mutations within the signal peptide (SP) of POMC or its adjoining segment develop metabolic disorders. However, the existence, metabolic fate, and functional outcomes of cytosol-retained POMC remain unclear. Here, we show that SP-uncleaved POMC is produced in the cytosol of POMC neuronal cells, thus inducing ER stress and ferroptotic cell death. Mechanistically, the cytosol-retained POMC sequesters the chaperone Hspa5 and subsequently accelerates degradation of the glutathione peroxidase Gpx4, a core regulator of ferroptosis, via the chaperone-mediated autophagy. We also show that the Marchf6 E3 ubiquitin ligase mediates the degradation of cytosol-retained POMC, thereby preventing ER stress and ferroptosis. Furthermore, POMC-Cre-mediated Marchf6-deficient mice exhibit hyperphagia, reduced energy expenditure, and weight gain. These findings suggest that Marchf6 is a critical regulator of ER stress, ferroptosis, and metabolic homeostasis in POMC neurons.

Abstract: Summary
Cells maintain and dynamically change their proteomes according to the environment and their needs. Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key regulator of proteostasis, homeostasis of the proteome. Thus, dysregulation of mTOR leads to changes in proteostasis and the consequent progression of diseases, including cancer. Based on the physiological and clinical importance of mTOR signaling, we investigated mTOR feedback signaling, proteostasis, and cell fate. Here, we reveal that mTOR targeting inhibits eIF4E-mediated cap-dependent translation, but feedback signaling activates a translation initiation factor, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3D (eIF3D), to sustain alternative non-canonical translation mechanisms. Importantly, eIF3D-mediated protein synthesis enables cell phenotype switching from proliferative to more migratory. eIF3D cooperates with mRNA-binding proteins such as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein F (hnRNPF), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNPK), and Sjogren syndrome antigen B (SSB) to support selective mRNA translation following mTOR inhibition, which upregulates and activates proteins involved in insulin receptor (INSR)/insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R)/insulin receptor substrate (IRS) and interleukin 6 signal transducer (IL-6ST)/Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling. Our study highlights the mechanisms by which cells establish the dynamic change of proteostasis and the resulting phenotype switch.

Abstract: Macrobrachium amazonicum is a species of economic interest with a wide distribution in the Americas and high morphological and reproductive variability. Three phenotypes can be observed in this species: i) large-size amphidromous, ii) large-size and iii) small-size hololimnetic prawns. In the present work, the morphological, histochemical and ultrastructural aspects of ovarian development in the three phenotypes were comparatively analyzed. In addition, the interaction between the ovary and the hepatopancreas was investigated in these phenotypes through the use of gonadosomatic (GSI) and hepatosomatic (HSI) indices. Despite the morphological differences and different reproductive strategies adopted by the females, the macroscopic, histochemical and ultrastructural patterns of ovarian development showed no differences between the phenotypes. The ovaries were macroscopically classified into five stages of development (I to V). In early stages (I and II), the ovaries are full of oogonia, previtellogenic oocytes and oocytes in primary or endogenous vitellogenesis. At these stages, the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) produces a granular electron-dense material and sends it to the Golgi apparatus, where it will be modified, compacted and transformed into immature yolk granules. From stage III, secondary or exogenous vitellogenesis begins (with no interruption of endogenous vitellogenesis), where follicular cells nourish the oocytes and extracellular material is absorbed by endocytic vesicles, which fuse with immature yolk granules (forming mature granules) or with existing mature yolk granules. In stages IV and V, secondary vitellogenesis continues and mature yolk granules progressively occupy the cytoplasm. In M. amazonicum, the patterns of increase in oocyte diameter are quite similar between phenotypes, being greater in the small-size phenotype. This is related to the formation of larger oocytes/eggs and the production of large lipid reserves for their larvae. Changes in GSI and HSI during ovarian development show strong similarity between phenotypes, supporting the results obtained by histology and ultrastructure. Females in stages III and IV mobilize hepatopancreas reserves for ovarian maturation, which justifies the higher HSI values recorded in these stages. On the other hand, females in stage V show higher GSI and lower HSI values, indicating a mobilization of resources for the end of ovarian development as the females are ready to spawn.

Abstract: Summary
During development, positional information directs cells to specific fates, leading them to differentiate with their own transcriptomes and express specific behaviors and functions. However, the mechanisms underlying these processes in a genome-wide view remain ambiguous, partly because the single-cell transcriptomic data of early developing embryos containing accurate spatial and lineage information are still lacking. Here, we report a single-cell transcriptome atlas of Drosophila gastrulae, divided into 77 transcriptomically distinct clusters. We find that the expression profiles of plasma-membrane-related genes, but not those of transcription-factor genes, represent each germ layer, supporting the nonequivalent contribution of each transcription-factor mRNA level to effector gene expression profiles at the transcriptome level. We also reconstruct the spatial expression patterns of all genes at the single-cell stripe level as the smallest unit. This atlas is an important resource for the genome-wide understanding of the mechanisms by which genes cooperatively orchestrate Drosophila gastrulation.

Abstract: Summary
Long ignored as a vestigial remnant of cytokinesis, the mammalian midbody (MB) is released post-abscission inside large extracellular vesicles called MB remnants (MBRs). Recent evidence suggests that MBRs can modulate cell proliferation and cell fate decisions. Here, we demonstrate that the MB matrix is the site of ribonucleoprotein assembly and is enriched in mRNAs that encode proteins involved in cell fate, oncogenesis, and pluripotency, which we are calling the MB granule. Both MBs and post-abscission MBRs are sites of spatiotemporally regulated translation, which is initiated when nascent daughter cells re-enter G1 and continues after extracellular release. MKLP1 and ARC are necessary for the localization and translation of RNA in the MB dark zone, whereas ESCRT-III is necessary to maintain translation levels in the MB. Our work reveals a unique translation event that occurs during abscission and within a large extracellular vesicle.

Abstract: Summary
Rodents are taxonomically diverse and have evolved a variety of traits. A mechanistic understanding of such traits has remained elusive, however, largely because genome editing in non-traditional model species remains challenging. Here, using the African striped mouse (Rhabdomys pumilio), we describe TIGER (targeted in vivo genome editing in rodents), a method that relies on a simple intraoviductal injecting technique and uses recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) as the sole vehicle to deliver reagents into pregnant females. We demonstrate that TIGER generates knockout and knockin (up to 3 kb) lines with high efficiency. Moreover, we engineer a double-cleaving repair rAAV template and find that it significantly increases knockin frequency and germline transmission rates. Lastly, we show that an oversized double-cleaving rAAV template leads to an insertion of 3.8 kb. Thus, TIGER constitutes an attractive alternative to traditional ex vivo genome-editing methods and has the potential to be extended to a broad range of species.

Abstract: Summary
Biomolecular condensates have been shown to interact in vivo, yet it is unclear whether these interactions are functionally meaningful. Here, we demonstrate that cooperativity between two distinct condensates—germ granules and P bodies—is required for transgenerational gene silencing in C. elegans. We find that P bodies form a coating around perinuclear germ granules and that P body components CGH-1/DDX6 and CAR-1/LSM14 are required for germ granules to organize into sub-compartments and concentrate small RNA silencing factors. Functionally, while the P body mutant cgh-1 is competent to initially trigger gene silencing, it is unable to propagate the silencing to subsequent generations. Mechanistically, we trace this loss of transgenerational silencing to defects in amplifying secondary small RNAs and the stability of WAGO-4 Argonaute, both known carriers of gene silencing memories. Together, these data reveal that cooperation between condensates results in an emergent capability of germ cells to establish heritable memory.

Abstract: Summary
Amyloid precursor protein (APP) internalization via clathrin-/dynamin-mediated endocytosis (CME) mediated by its YENPTY motif into endosomes containing β-secretase is proposed to be critical for amyloid-beta (Aβ) production. Here, we show that somatodendritic APP internalization in primary rodent neurons is not blocked by inhibiting dynamin or mutating the YENPTY motif, in contrast to non-neuronal cell lines. These phenomena, confirmed in induced human neurons under dynamin inhibition, occur during basal conditions and chemical long-term-depression stimulus, pointing to a clathrin-independent internalization pathway for somatodendritic APP. Mutating the YENPTY motif does not alter APP recycling, degradation, or endolysosomal colocalization. However, both dynamin inhibition and the YENPTY mutant significantly decrease secreted Aβ in neurons, suggesting that internalized somatodendritic APP may not constitute a major source of Aβ. Interestingly, like APP, somatodendritic low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) internalization does not require its CME motif. These results highlight intriguing differences in neuronal internalization pathways and refine our understanding of Aβ production and secretion.

Abstract: Summary
The Notch signaling pathway controls cell growth, differentiation, and fate decisions. Dysregulation of Notch signaling has been linked to various human diseases. Notch receptor resides in multiple cellular compartments, and its translocation plays a central role in pathway activation. However, the spatial regulation of Notch receptor functions remains largely elusive. Using TurboID-based proximity labeling followed by affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we establish a spatially defined human Notch receptor interaction network. Notch receptors interact with different proteins in distinct subcellular compartments to perform specific cellular functions. This spatially defined interaction network also reveals that a large fraction of NOTCH is stored at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment and recruits Ataxin-2-dependent recycling machinery for rapid recycling, Notch signaling activation, and leukemogenesis. Our work provides insights into dynamic Notch receptor complexes with exquisite spatial resolution, which will help in elucidating the detailed regulation of Notch receptors and highlight potential therapeutic targets for Notch-related pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The integrated stress response (ISR) is a conserved signaling network that detects aberrations and computes cellular responses. Dissecting these computations has been difficult because physical and chemical inducers of stress activate multiple parallel pathways. To overcome this challenge, we engineered a photo-switchable control over the ISR sensor kinase PKR (opto-PKR), enabling virtual, on-target activation. Using light to control opto-PKR dynamics, we traced information flow through the transcriptome and for key downstream ISR effectors. Our analyses revealed a biphasic, proportional transcriptional response with two dynamic modes, transient and gradual, that correspond to adaptive and terminal outcomes. We then constructed an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model of the ISR, which demonstrated the dependence of future stress responses on past stress. Finally, we tested our model using high-throughput light-delivery to map the stress memory landscape. Our results demonstrate that cells encode information in stress levels, durations, and the timing between encounters. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
Iron homeostasis, which is pivotal to virulence, is regulated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase CgVps34 in the human fungal pathogen Candida glabrata. Here, we identify CgPil1 as a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P)-binding protein and unveil its role in retaining the high-affinity iron transporter CgFtr1 at the plasma membrane (PM), with PI3P negatively regulating CgFtr1-CgPil1 interaction. PI3P production and its PM localization are elevated in the high-iron environment. Surplus iron also leads to intracellular distribution and vacuolar delivery of CgPil1 and CgFtr1, respectively, from the PM. Loss of CgPil1 or CgFtr1 ubiquitination at lysines 391 and 401 results in CgFtr1 trafficking to the endoplasmic reticulum and a decrease in vacuole-localized CgFtr1. The E3-ubiquitin ligase CgRsp5 interacts with CgFtr1 and forms distinct CgRsp5-CgFtr1 puncta at the PM, with high iron resulting in their internalization. Finally, PI3P controls retrograde transport of many PM proteins. Altogether, we establish PI3P as a key regulator of membrane transport in C. glabrata.

Abstract: Summary
The ability to compare quantities of visual objects with two distinct measures, proportion and difference, is observed even in newborn animals. However, how this function originates in the brain, even before visual experience, remains unknown. Here, we propose a model in which neuronal tuning for quantity comparisons can arise spontaneously in completely untrained neural circuits. Using a biologically inspired model neural network, we find that single units selective to proportions and differences between visual quantities emerge in randomly initialized feedforward wirings and that they enable the network to perform quantity comparison tasks. Notably, we find that two distinct tunings to proportion and difference originate from a random summation of monotonic, nonlinear neural activities and that a slight difference in the nonlinear response function determines the type of measure. Our results suggest that visual quantity comparisons are primitive types of functions that can emerge spontaneously before learning in young brains.

Abstract: Summary
Feeding behavior is essential for growth and survival of animals; however, relatively little is known about its intrinsic mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that Gart is expressed in the glia, fat body, and gut and positively regulates feeding behavior via cooperation and coordination. Gart in the gut is crucial for maintaining endogenous feeding rhythms and food intake, while Gart in the glia and fat body regulates energy homeostasis between synthesis and metabolism. These roles of Gart further impact Drosophila lifespan. Importantly, Gart expression is directly regulated by the CLOCK/CYCLE heterodimer via canonical E-box, in which the CLOCKs (CLKs) in the glia, fat body, and gut positively regulate Gart of peripheral tissues, while the core CLK in brain negatively controls Gart of peripheral tissues. This study provides insight into the complex and subtle regulatory mechanisms of feeding and lifespan extension in animals.

Abstract: Summary
The POGZ gene has been found frequently mutated in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID). We have recently shown that POGZ maintains mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). However, the exact mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that POGZ plays an important role in the maintenance of ESCs by silencing Dux and endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). POGZ maintains a silent chromatin state at Dux and ERVs by associating with and recruiting TRIM28 and SETDB1, and its loss leads to decreased levels of H3K9me3/H4K20me3, resulting in up-regulation of 2C transcripts and ESC transition to a 2C-like state. POGZ suppresses different classes of ERVs through direct (IAPEy, the intracisternal A-type particle elements) and indirect regulation (MERVL). Activation of POGZ-bound ERVs is associated with up-regulation of nearby neural disease genes such as Serpina3m. Our findings provide important insights into understanding the disease mechanism caused by POGZ dysfunction.

Abstract: Summary
The impact of chromosomal inversions on human brain morphology remains underexplored. We studied 35 common inversions classified from genotypes of 33,018 adults with European ancestry. The inversions at 2p22.3, 16p11.2, and 17q21.31 reach genome-wide significance, followed by 8p23.1 and 6p21.33, in their association with cortical and subcortical morphology. The 17q21.31, 8p23.1, and 16p11.2 regions comprise the LRRC37, OR7E, and NPIP duplicated gene families. We find the 17q21.31 MAPT inversion region, known for harboring neurological risk, to be the most salient locus among common variants for shaping and patterning the cortex. Overall, we observe the inverted orientations decreasing brain size, with the exception that the 2p22.3 inversion is associated with increased subcortical volume and the 8p23.1 inversion is associated with increased motor cortex. These significant inversions are in the genomic hotspots of neuropsychiatric loci. Our findings are generalizable to 3,472 children and demonstrate inversions as essential genetic variation to understand human brain phenotypes.

Abstract: Summary
Fear responses are functionally adaptive behaviors that are strengthened as memories. Indeed, detailed knowledge of the neural circuitry modulating fear memory could be the turning point for the comprehension of this emotion and its pathological states. A comprehensive understanding of the circuits mediating memory encoding, consolidation, and retrieval presents the fundamental technological challenge of analyzing activity in the entire brain with single-neuron resolution. In this context, we develop the brain-wide neuron quantification toolkit (BRANT) for mapping whole-brain neuronal activation at micron-scale resolution, combining tissue clearing, high-resolution light-sheet microscopy, and automated image analysis. The robustness and scalability of this method allow us to quantify the evolution of activity patterns across multiple phases of memory in mice. This approach highlights a strong sexual dimorphism in recruited circuits, which has no counterpart in the behavior. The methodology presented here paves the way for a comprehensive characterization of the evolution of fear memory.

Abstract: Summary
Cohesin connects CTCF-binding sites and other genomic loci in cis to form chromatin loops and replicated DNA molecules in trans to mediate sister chromatid cohesion. Whether cohesin uses distinct or related mechanisms to perform these functions is unknown. Here, we describe a cohesin hinge mutant that can extrude DNA into loops but is unable to mediate cohesion in human cells. Our results suggest that the latter defect arises during cohesion establishment. The observation that cohesin’s cohesion and loop extrusion activities can be partially separated indicates that cohesin uses distinct mechanisms to perform these two functions. Unexpectedly, the same hinge mutant can also not be stopped by CTCF boundaries as well as wild-type cohesin. This suggests that cohesion establishment and cohesin’s interaction with CTCF boundaries depend on related mechanisms and raises the possibility that both require transient hinge opening to entrap DNA inside the cohesin ring.

Abstract: Summary
DNA replication ensures the accurate transmission of genetic information during the cell cycle. Histone variant H2A.Z is crucial for early replication origins licensing and activation in which SUV420H1 preferentially recognizes H2A.Z-nucleosome and deposits H4 lysine 20 dimethylation (H4K20me2) on replication origins. Here, we report the cryo-EM structures of SUV420H1 bound to H2A.Z-nucleosome or H2A-nucleosome and demonstrate that SUV420H1 directly interacts with H4 N-terminal tail, the DNA, and the acidic patch in the nucleosome. The H4 (1–24) forms a lasso-shaped structure that stabilizes the SUV420H1-nucleosome complex and precisely projects the H4K20 residue into the SUV420H1 catalytic center. In vitro and in vivo analyses reveal a crucial role of the SUV420H1 KR loop (residues 214–223), which lies close to the H2A.Z-specific residues D97/S98, in H2A.Z-nucleosome preferential recognition. Together, our findings elucidate how SUV420H1 recognizes nucleosomes to ensure site-specific H4K20me2 modification and provide insights into how SUV420H1 preferentially recognizes H2A.Z nucleosome.

Abstract: Summary
Protein-ligand interactions are essential for cellular activities and drug discovery processes. Appropriately and effectively representing protein features is of vital importance for developing computational approaches, especially data-driven methods, for predicting protein-ligand interactions. However, existing approaches may not fully investigate the features of the ligand-occupying regions in the protein pockets. Here, we design a structure-based protein representation method, named PocketAnchor, for capturing the local environmental and spatial features of protein pockets to facilitate protein-ligand interaction-related learning tasks. We define “anchors” as probe points reaching into the cavities and those located near the surface of proteins, and we design a specific message passing strategy for gathering local information from the atoms and surface neighboring these anchors. Comprehensive evaluation of our method demonstrated its successful applications in pocket detection and binding affinity prediction, which indicated that our anchor-based approach can provide effective protein feature representations for improving the prediction of protein-ligand interactions.

Abstract: Summary
Formation of either an ovary or a testis during human embryonic life is one of the most important sex-specific events leading to the emergence of secondary sexual characteristics and sex assignment of babies at birth. Our study focused on the sex-specific and sex-indifferent characteristics of the prenatal ovarian stromal cells, cortical cords, and germline, with the discovery that the ovarian mesenchymal cells of the stroma are transcriptionally indistinguishable from the mesenchymal cells of the testicular interstitium. We found that first-wave pre-granulosa cells emerge at week 7 from early supporting gonadal cells with stromal identity and are spatially defined by KRT19 levels. We also identified rare transient state f0 spermatogonia cells within the ovarian cords between weeks 10 and 16. Taken together, our work illustrates a unique plasticity of the embryonic ovary during human development.

Abstract: Summary
The mammalian body plan is shaped by rhythmic segmentation of mesoderm into somites, which are transient embryonic structures that form down each side of the neural tube. We have analyzed the genome-wide transcriptional and chromatin dynamics occurring within nascent somites, from early inception of somitogenesis to the latest stages of body plan establishment. We created matched gene expression and open chromatin maps for the three leading pairs of somites at six time points during mouse embryonic development. We show that the rate of somite differentiation accelerates as development progresses. We identified a conserved maturation program followed by all somites, but somites from more developed embryos concomitantly switch on differentiation programs from derivative cell lineages soon after segmentation. Integrated analysis of the somitic transcriptional and chromatin activities identified opposing regulatory modules controlling the onset of differentiation. Our results provide a powerful, high-resolution view of the molecular genetics underlying somitic development in mammals.

Translational regulation impacts both pluripotency maintenance and cell differentiation. To what degree the ribosome exerts control over this process remains unanswered. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated heterogeneity in ribosome composition in various organisms. 2′-O-methylation (2′-O-me) of rRNA represents an important source of heterogeneity, where site-specific alteration of methylation levels can modulate translation. Here, we examine changes in rRNA 2′-O-me during mouse brain development and tri-lineage differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). We find distinct alterations between brain regions, as well as clear dynamics during cortex development and germ layer differentiation. We identify a methylation site impacting neuronal differentiation. Modulation of its methylation levels affects ribosome association of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and is accompanied by an altered translation of WNT pathway-related mRNAs. Together, these data identify ribosome heterogeneity through rRNA 2′-O-me during early development and differentiation and suggest a direct role for ribosomes in regulating translation during cell fate acquisition.

Abstract: Summary
Leukocyte diversity of the first-trimester maternal-fetal interface has been extensively described; however, the immunological landscape of the term decidua remains poorly understood. We therefore profiled human leukocytes from term decidua collected via scheduled cesarean delivery. Relative to the first trimester, our analyses show a shift from NK cells and macrophages to T cells and enhanced immune activation. Although circulating and decidual T cells are phenotypically distinct, they demonstrate significant clonotype sharing. We also report significant diversity within decidual macrophages, the frequency of which positively correlates with pregravid maternal body mass index. Interestingly, the ability of decidual macrophages to respond to bacterial ligands is reduced with pregravid obesity, suggestive of skewing toward immunoregulation as a possible mechanism to safeguard the fetus against excessive maternal inflammation. These findings are a resource for future studies investigating pathological conditions that compromise fetal health and reproductive success.

Abstract: Summary
Aberrant activation of the forkhead protein FOXA1 is observed in advanced hormone-related cancers. However, the key mediators of high FOXA1 signaling remain elusive. We demonstrate that ectopic high FOXA1 (H-FOXA1) expression promotes estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer (BC) metastasis in a xenograft mouse model. Mechanistically, H-FOXA1 reprograms ER-chromatin binding to elicit a core gene signature (CGS) enriched in ER+ endocrine-resistant (EndoR) cells. We identify Secretome14, a CGS subset encoding ER-dependent cancer secretory proteins, as a strong predictor for poor outcomes of ER+ BC. It is elevated in ER+ metastases vs. primary tumors, irrespective of ESR1 mutations. Genomic ER binding near Secretome14 genes is also increased in mutant ER-expressing or mitogen-treated ER+ BC cells and in ER+ metastatic vs. primary tumors, suggesting a convergent pathway including high growth factor receptor signaling in activating pro-metastatic secretome genes. Our findings uncover H-FOXA1-induced ER reprogramming that drives EndoR and metastasis partly via an H-FOXA1/ER-dependent secretome.

Abstract: Summary
Learning describes the process by which our internal expectation models of the world are updated by surprising outcomes (prediction errors [PEs]) to improve predictions of future events. However, the mechanisms through which error signals dynamically influence existing neural representations are unknown. Here, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans solving a two-step Markov decision task to investigate changes in neural activation patterns following PEs. Using a dynamic multivariate pattern analysis, we can show that PE-related fMRI responses in error-coding regions predict trial-by-trial changes in multivariate neural patterns in the orbitofrontal cortex, the precuneus, and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Importantly, the dynamics of these pattern changes in the vmPFC also predicted upcoming changes in choice strategies and thus highlight the importance of these pattern changes for behavior.

Abstract: Summary
Type VI secretion system is widely used in Gram-negative bacteria for injecting toxic effectors into neighboring prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells. Various effectors can be loaded onto the T6SS delivery tube via its core components: Hcp, VgrG, or PAAR. Here, we report 2.8-Å resolution cryo-EM structure of intact T6SS Hcp5-VgrG-PAAR cargo delivery system and crystal structure of unbound Hcp5 from B. fragilis NCTC 9343. Loading of Hcp5 hexameric ring onto VgrG causes expansion of its inner cavity and external surface, explaining how structural changes could be propagated to regulate co-polymerization and surrounding contractile sheath. High-affinity binding between Hcp and VgrG causes entropically unfavorable structuring of long loops. Furthermore, interactions between VgrG trimer and Hcp hexamer are asymmetric, with three of the six Hcp monomers exhibiting a major loop flip. Our study provides insights into the assembly, loading, and firing of T6SS nanomachine that contributes to bacterial inter-species competition and host interactions.

Abstract: Periodontitis is characterized by periodontal destruction triggered by chronic inflammation. The optimal treatment for periodontitis is to improve the periodontal microenvironment, reduce inflammation and achieve periodontal regeneration. Recently, the role of TRPM2 in inflammatory diseases has been reported. However, the function of TRPM2 in periodontal disease and the biological mechanism remain elusive. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the role and explore the underlying mechanisms of TRPM2 in periodontal disease. Here, we first identified the characterization of human periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs). Oil Red O Staining and Alizarin Red mineralized matrix were used to evaluate the multi-differentiation capacity of cells. Flow cytometry was employed to detect MSC-specific surface markers of hPDLSCs. hPDLSCs were treated with 0, 5, 10 or 40 μg/mL of TNF-α for 72 h. Western blot assay were performed to examine the expression of Transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, member 2 (TRPM2) in hPDLSCs. CCK8 and colony formation assays were used to detect the cell viability and proliferation of hPDLSCs, which revealed that TRPM2 knockdown promoted hPDLSCs proliferation. Then, ALP activity in hPDLSCs was detected by ALP activity detection kit. Next, the expression of ALP and Runx2 in hPDLSCs was detected by immunofluorescence staining. The result showed that TRPM2 knockdown promoted osteogenic differentiation and affected the genes expression of osteogenic. Finally, the expressions of p-p65, p65, p-IκBα, IκBα and NLRP3 in hPDLSCs were detected by western blot assay. Together, these results suggested that knockdown of TRPM2 accelerated osteogenic differentiation of hPDLSCs through mediating NF-κB /NLRP3 pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Although it is known that psoriasis is strongly associated with obesity, the mechanistic connection between diet and skin lesions is not well established. Herein, we showed that only dietary fat, not carbohydrates or proteins, exacerbates psoriatic disease. Enhanced psoriatic skin inflammation was associated with changes in the intestinal mucus layer and microbiota composition by high-fat diet (HFD). Change of intestinal microbiota by vancomycin treatment effectively blocked activation of psoriatic skin inflammation by HFD, inhibited the systemic interleukin-17 (IL-17) response, and led to increased mucophilic bacterial species such as Akkermansia muciniphila. By using IL-17 reporter mice, we could show that HFD facilitates IL-17-mediated γδ T cell response in the spleen. Notably, oral gavage with live or heat-killed A. muciniphila effectively inhibited HFD-induced enhancement of psoriatic disease. In conclusion, HFD exacerbates psoriatic skin inflammation through changing the mucus barrier and the intestine microbial composition, which leads to an enhanced systemic IL-17 response.

Abstract: Summary
The PIP3/PI3K network is a central regulator of metabolism and is frequently activated in cancer, commonly by loss of the PIP3/PI(3,4)P2 phosphatase, PTEN. Despite huge research investment, the drivers of the PI3K network in normal tissues and how they adapt to overactivation are unclear. We find that in healthy mouse prostate PI3K activity is driven by RTK/IRS signaling and constrained by pathway feedback. In the absence of PTEN, the network is dramatically remodeled. A poorly understood YXXM- and PIP3/PI(3,4)P2-binding PH domain-containing adaptor, PLEKHS1, became the dominant activator and was required to sustain PIP3, AKT phosphorylation, and growth in PTEN-null prostate. This was because PLEKHS1 evaded pathway-feedback and experienced enhanced PI3K- and Src-family kinase-dependent phosphorylation of Y258XXM, eliciting PI3K activation. hPLEKHS1 mRNA and activating Y419 phosphorylation of hSrc correlated with PI3K pathway activity in human prostate cancers. We propose that in PTEN-null cells receptor-independent, Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of PLEKHS1 creates positive feedback that escapes homeostasis, drives PIP3 signaling, and supports tumor progression.

Abstract: Summary
C9orf72 repeat expansions are the most common genetic cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Poly(GR) proteins are toxic to neurons by forming cytoplasmic inclusions that sequester RNA-binding proteins including stress granule (SG) proteins. However, little is known of the factors governing poly(GR) inclusion formation. Here, we show that poly(GR) infiltrates a finely tuned network of protein-RNA interactions underpinning SG formation. It interacts with G3BP1, the key driver of SG assembly and a protein we found is critical for poly(GR) inclusion formation. Moreover, we discovered that N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-modified mRNAs and m6A-binding YTHDF proteins not only co-localize with poly(GR) inclusions in brains of c9FTD/ALS mouse models and patients with c9FTD, they promote poly(GR) inclusion formation via the incorporation of RNA into the inclusions. Our findings thus suggest that interrupting interactions between poly(GR) and G3BP1 or YTHDF1 proteins or decreasing poly(GR) altogether represent promising therapeutic strategies to combat c9FTD/ALS pathogenesis.

Abstract: Candida auris is a multi-drug resistant human fungal pathogen that has become a global threat to human health due to its drug resistant phenotype, persistence in the hospital environment and propensity for patient to patient spread. Isolates display variable aggregation that may affect the relative virulence of strains. Therefore, dissection of this phenotype has gained substantial interest in recent years. We studied eight clinical isolates from four different clades (I-IV); four of which had a strongly aggregating phenotype and four of which did not. Genome analysis identified polymorphisms associated with loss of cell surface proteins were enriched in weakly-aggregating strains. Additionally, we identified down-regulation of chitin synthase genes involved in the synthesis of the chitinous septum. Characterisation of the cells revealed no ultrastructural defects in cytokinesis or cell separation in aggregating isolates. Strongly and weakly aggregating strains did not differ in net surface charge or in cell surface hydrophobicity. The capacity for aggregation and for adhesion to polystyrene microspheres were also not correlated. However, aggregation and extracellular matrix formation were all increased at higher growth temperatures, and treatment with the amyloid protein inhibitor Thioflavin-T markedly attenuated aggregation. Genome analysis further indicated strain specific differences in the genome content of GPI-anchored proteins including those encoding genes with the potential to form amyloid proteins. Collectively our data suggests that aggregation is a complex strain and temperature dependent phenomenon that may be linked in part to the ability to form extracellular matrix and cell surface amyloids.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we identified vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 like 1 (VKORC1L1) as a potent ferroptosis repressor. VKORC1L1 protects cells from ferroptosis by generating the reduced form of vitamin K, a potent radical-trapping antioxidant, to counteract phospholipid peroxides independent of the canonical GSH/GPX4 mechanism. Notably, we found that VKORC1L1 is also a direct transcriptional target of p53. Activation of p53 induces downregulation of VKORC1L1 expression, thus sensitizing cells to ferroptosis for tumor suppression. Interestingly, a small molecular inhibitor of VKORC1L1, warfarin, is widely prescribed as an FDA-approved anticoagulant drug. Moreover, warfarin represses tumor growth by promoting ferroptosis in both immunodeficient and immunocompetent mouse models. Thus, by downregulating VKORC1L1, p53 executes the tumor suppression function by activating an important ferroptosis pathway involved in vitamin K metabolism. Our study also reveals that warfarin is a potential repurposing drug in cancer therapy, particularly for tumors with high levels of VKORC1L1 expression.

Abstract: Summary
The effectiveness of multiomics analyses in defining cell differentiation pathways during development is ambiguous. During liver development, hepatoblasts follow a default or directed pathway to differentiate into hepatocytes or cholangiocytes, respectively, and this provides a practical model to address this issue. Our study discovered that promoter-associated histone modifications and chromatin accessibility dynamics, rather than enhancer-associated histone modifications, effectively delineated the “default vs. directed” process of hepatoblast differentiation. Histone H3K27me3 on bivalent promoters is associated with this asymmetric differentiation strategy in mice and humans. We demonstrated that Ezh2 and Jmjd3 exert opposing regulatory roles in hepatoblast-cholangiocyte differentiation. Additionally, active enhancers, regulated by P300, correlate with the development of both hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. This research proposes a model highlighting the division of labor between promoters and enhancers, with promoter-associated chromatin modifications governing the “default vs. directed” differentiation mode of hepatoblasts, whereas enhancer-associated modifications primarily dictate the progressive development processes of hepatobiliary lineages.

Abstract: Summary
Suboptimal responses to a primary vaccination course have been reported in the elderly, but there is little information regarding the impact of age on responses to booster third doses. Here, we show that individuals 70 years or older (median age 73, range 70–75) who received a primary two-dose schedule with AZD1222 and booster third dose with mRNA vaccine achieve significantly lower neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus compared with those younger than 70 (median age 66, range 54–69) at 1 month post booster. Impaired neutralization potency and breadth post third dose in the elderly is associated with circulating “atypical” spike-specific B cells expressing CD11c and FCRL5. However, when considering individuals who received three doses of mRNA vaccine, we did not observe differences in neutralization or enrichment in atypical B cells. This work highlights the finding that AdV and mRNA COVID-19 vaccine formats differentially instruct the memory B cell response.

Abstract: Summary
Kynurenine monooxygenase (KMO) blockade protects against multiple organ failure caused by acute pancreatitis (AP), but the link between KMO and systemic inflammation has eluded discovery until now. Here, we show that the KMO product 3-hydroxykynurenine primes innate immune signaling to exacerbate systemic inflammation during experimental AP. We find a tissue-specific role for KMO, where mice lacking Kmo solely in hepatocytes have elevated plasma 3-hydroxykynurenine levels that prime inflammatory gene transcription. 3-Hydroxykynurenine synergizes with interleukin-1β to cause cellular apoptosis. Critically, mice with elevated 3-hydroxykynurenine succumb fatally earlier and more readily to experimental AP. Therapeutically, blockade with the highly selective KMO inhibitor GSK898 rescues the phenotype, reducing 3-hydroxykynurenine and protecting against critical illness and death. Together, our findings establish KMO and 3-hydroxykynurenine as regulators of inflammation and the innate immune response to sterile inflammation. During critical illness, excess morbidity and death from multiple organ failure can be rescued by systemic KMO blockade.

Abstract: Summary
Instances of sustained stationary sensory input are ubiquitous. However, previous work focused almost exclusively on transient onset responses. This presents a critical challenge for neural theories of consciousness, which should account for the full temporal extent of experience. To address this question, we use intracranial recordings from ten human patients with epilepsy to view diverse images of multiple durations. We reveal that, in sensory regions, despite dramatic changes in activation magnitude, the distributed representation of categories and exemplars remains sustained and stable. In contrast, in frontoparietal regions, we find transient content representation at stimulus onset. Our results highlight the connection between the anatomical and temporal correlates of experience. To the extent perception is sustained, it may rely on sensory representations and to the extent perception is discrete, centered on perceptual updating, it may rely on frontoparietal representations.

Abstract: Summary
The bone marrow microenvironment (BME) drives drug resistance in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) through leukemic cell interactions with bone marrow (BM) niches, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that the interaction between ALL and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) through integrin β1 induces an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like program in MSC-adherent ALL cells, resulting in drug resistance and enhanced survival. Moreover, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of ALL-MSC co-culture identifies a hybrid cluster of MSC-adherent ALL cells expressing both B-ALL and MSC signature genes, orchestrated by a WNT/β-catenin-mediated EMT-like program. Blockade of interaction between β-catenin and CREB binding protein impairs the survival and drug resistance of MSC-adherent ALL cells in vitro and results in a reduction in leukemic burden in vivo. Targeting of this WNT/β-catenin-mediated EMT-like program is a potential therapeutic approach to overcome cell extrinsically acquired drug resistance in ALL.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors implicated in tumorigenesis and tumor progression. Here, we identify the lncRNA LINC00324 (long intergenic noncoding RNA 00324) as a direct p53 transcriptional target. Knockdown of LINC00324 expression promotes tumor growth by reducing p53 transcriptional activity, whereas ectopic LINC00324 expression demonstrates a reverse effect. Notably, LINC00324 is present in the endogenous p53 complex in tumor cells and directly binds to the C-terminal domain of p53 in vitro. Mechanistically, LINC00324 enables p53 transactivation by competitively disrupting the p53-SET interaction, resulting in an increase of p300/CBP-mediated H3K18 and H3K27 acetylation on the p53 target promoters. Lower LINC00324 expression is associated with more aggressive disease status and predicts worse overall survival of patients with cancer. Our study identifies a p53/LINC00324 positive feedback loop that suppresses tumor growth by counteracting SET-mediated transcriptional repression.

Abstract: Summary
Tissue-resident macrophages (TRMs) and dendritic cells (DCs) are highly heterogeneous and essential for immunity, tissue regeneration, and homeostasis maintenance. Here, we comprehensively profile the heterogeneity of TRMs and DCs across adult zebrafish organs via single-cell RNA sequencing. We identify two macrophage subsets: pro-inflammatory macrophages with potent phagocytosis signatures and pro-remodeling macrophages with tissue regeneration signatures in barrier tissues, liver, and heart. In parallel, one conventional dendritic cell (cDC) population with prominent antigen presentation capacity and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) featured by anti-virus properties are also observed in these organs. Remarkably, in addition to a single macrophage/microglia population with potent phagocytosis capacity, a pDC population and two distinct cDC populations are identified in the brain. Finally, we generate specific reporter lines for in vivo tracking of macrophage and DC subsets. Our study depicts the landscape of TRMs and DCs and creates valuable tools for in-depth study of these cells in zebrafish.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic reprogramming toward glycolysis is a hallmark of cancer malignancy. The molecular mechanisms by which the tumor glycolysis pathway promotes immune evasion remain to be elucidated. Here, by performing genome-wide CRISPR screens in murine tumor cells co-cultured with cytotoxic T cells (CTLs), we identified that deficiency of two important glycolysis enzymes, Glut1 (glucose transporter 1) and Gpi1 (glucose-6-phosphate isomerase 1), resulted in enhanced killing of tumor cells by CTLs. Mechanistically, Glut1 inactivation causes metabolic rewiring toward oxidative phosphorylation, which generates an excessive amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Accumulated ROS potentiate tumor cell death mediated by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in a caspase-8- and Fadd-dependent manner. Genetic and pharmacological inactivation of Glut1 sensitizes tumors to anti-tumor immunity and synergizes with anti-PD-1 therapy through the TNF-α pathway. The mechanistic interplay between tumor-intrinsic glycolysis and TNF-α-induced killing provides new therapeutic strategies to enhance anti-tumor immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular stress in the form of disrupted transcription, loss of organelle integrity, or damage to nucleic acids can elicit inflammatory responses by activating signaling cascades canonically tasked with controlling pathogen infections. These stressors must be kept in check to prevent unscheduled activation of interferon, which contributes to autoinflammation. This study examines the role of the transcription factor myocyte enhancing factor 2A (MEF2A) in setting the threshold of transcriptional stress responses to prevent R-loop accumulation. Increases in R-loops lead to the induction of interferon and inflammatory responses in a DEAD-box helicase 41 (DDX41)-, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-, and stimulator of interferon genes (STING)-dependent manner. The loss of MEF2A results in the activation of ATM and RAD3-related (ATR) kinase, which is also necessary for the activation of STING. This study identifies the role of MEF2A in sustaining transcriptional homeostasis and highlights the role of ATR in positively regulating R-loop-associated inflammatory responses.

Abstract: Summary
Volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs) are hexamers of LRRC8 proteins that are crucial for cell volume regulation. N termini (NTs) of the obligatory LRRC8A subunit modulate VRACs activation and ion selectivity, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we report a 2.8-Å cryo-electron microscopy structure of human LRRC8A that displays well-resolved NTs. Amino-terminal halves of NTs fold back into the pore and constrict the permeation path, thereby determining ion selectivity together with an extracellular selectivity filter with which it works in series. They also interact with pore-surrounding helices and support their compact arrangement. The C-terminal halves of NTs interact with intracellular loops that are crucial for channel activation. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that low ionic strength increases NT mobility and expands the radial distance between pore-surrounding helices. Our work suggests an unusual pore architecture with two selectivity filters in series and a mechanism for VRAC activation by cell swelling.

Abstract: Summary
Lactate was implicated in the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). However, the mechanism by which lactate exerts its effect remains elusive. Using RNA-seq and CUT&Tag chromatin profiling, we found that induction of hexokinase 2 (HK2) expression in activated HSCs is required for induced gene expression by histone lactylation but not histone acetylation. Inhibiting histone lactylation by Hk2 deletion or pharmacological inhibition of lactate production diminishes HSC activation, whereas exogenous lactate but not acetate supplementation rescues the activation phenotype. Thus, lactate produced by activated HSCs determines the HSC fate via histone lactylation. We found that histone acetylation competes with histone lactylation, which could explain why class I HDAC (histone deacetylase) inhibitors impede HSC activation. Finally, HSC-specific or systemic deletion of HK2 inhibits HSC activation and liver fibrosis in vivo. Therefore, we provide evidence that HK2 may be an effective therapeutic target for liver fibrosis.

Abstract: Summary
Adherens junctions (AJs) allow cell contact to inhibit epithelial migration yet also permit epithelia to move as coherent sheets. How, then, do cells identify which contacts will inhibit locomotion? Here, we show that in human epithelial cells this arises from the orientation of cortical flows at AJs. When the leader cells from different migrating sheets make head-on contact with one another, they assemble AJs that couple together oppositely directed cortical flows. This applies a tensile signal to the actin-binding domain (ABD) of α-catenin, which provides a clutch to promote lateral adhesion growth and inhibit the lamellipodial activity necessary for migration. In contrast, AJs found between leader cells in the same migrating sheet have cortical flows aligned in the same direction, and no such mechanical inhibition takes place. Therefore, α-catenin mechanosensitivity in the clutch between E-cadherin and cortical F-actin allows cells to interpret the direction of motion via cortical flows and signal for contact to inhibit locomotion.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the key roles of perilipin-2 (PLIN2) in governing lipid droplet (LD) metabolism, the mechanisms that regulate PLIN2 levels remain incompletely understood. Here, we leverage a set of genome-edited human PLIN2 reporter cell lines in a series of CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screens, identifying genetic modifiers that influence PLIN2 expression and post-translational stability under different metabolic conditions and in different cell types. These regulators include canonical genes that control lipid metabolism as well as genes involved in ubiquitination, transcription, and mitochondrial function. We further demonstrate a role for the E3 ligase MARCH6 in regulating triacylglycerol biosynthesis, thereby influencing LD abundance and PLIN2 stability. Finally, our CRISPR screens and several published screens provide the foundation for CRISPRlipid (http://crisprlipid.org), an online data commons for lipid-related functional genomics data. Our study identifies mechanisms of PLIN2 and LD regulation and provides an extensive resource for the exploration of LD biology and lipid metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Many neuronal populations that release fast-acting excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in the brain also contain slower-acting neuropeptides. These facultative peptidergic cell types are common, but it remains uncertain whether neurons that solely release peptides exist. Our fluorescence in situ hybridization, genetically targeted electron microscopy, and electrophysiological characterization suggest that most neurons of the non-cholinergic, centrally projecting Edinger-Westphal nucleus in mice are obligately peptidergic. We further show, using anterograde projection mapping, monosynaptic retrograde tracing, angled-tip fiber photometry, and chemogenetic modulation and genetically targeted ablation in conjunction with canonical assays for anxiety, that this peptidergic population activates in response to loss of motor control and promotes anxiety responses. Together, these findings elucidate an integrative, ethologically relevant role for the Edinger-Westphal nucleus and functionally align the nucleus with the periaqueductal gray, where it resides. This work advances our understanding of peptidergic modulation of anxiety and provides a framework for future investigations of peptidergic systems.

Abstract: Summary
Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) dysfunction and choroidal neovascularization (CNV) are predominant features of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), with an unclear mechanism. Herein, we show that RNA demethylase α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase alkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5) is up-regulated in AMD. In RPE cells, ALKBH5 overexpression associates with depolarization, oxidative stress, disturbed autophagy, irregular lipid homeostasis, and elevated VEGF-A secretion, which subsequently promotes proliferation, migration, and tube formation of vascular endothelial cells. Consistently, ALKBH5 overexpression in mice RPE correlates with various pathological phenotypes, including visual impairments, RPE anomalies, choroidal neovascularization (CNV), and interrupted retinal homeostasis. Mechanistically, ALKBH5 regulates retinal features through its demethylation activity. It targets PIK3C2B and regulates the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway with YTHDF2 as the N6-methyladenosine reader. IOX1, an ALKBH5 inhibitor, suppresses hypoxia-induced RPE dysfunction and CNV progression. Collectively, we demonstrate that ALKBH5 induces RPE dysfunction and CNV progression in AMD via PIK3C2B-mediated activation of the AKT/mTOR pathway. Pharmacological inhibitors of ALKBH5, like IOX1, are promising therapeutic options for AMD.

Abstract: Summary
Salt stress is one of the unfavorable environmental factors to affect plants. Salinity represses root growth, resulting in reduced biomass of agricultural plants. Little is known about how plants maintain root growth to counteract salt stress. The AP2-domain transcription factors PLETHORA1/2 (PLT1/2) act as master regulators in root meristem maintenance in Arabidopsis. In this study, we report that the salt overly sensitive (SOS) pathway component SOS2 regulates PLT1/2 at the post-transcriptional level. Salt-activated SOS2 interacts and phosphorylates PLT1/2 through their conserved C-terminal motifs to stabilize PLT1/2, critical for root apical meristem maintenance under salt stress. The phospho-mimetic version of PLT1/2 restored meristem and primary root length reduction of sos2-2 and plt1-4 plt2-2 mutants on salt treatment. Moreover, SOS2-mediated PLT1/2 phosphorylation improves root growth recovery after salt stress alleviation. We identify a SOS2-PLT1/2 core protein module that is required for protecting primary root growth and meristem maintenance from salt stress.

Abstract: Summary
Bacteriophage T3 encodes a SAMase that, through cleavage of S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), circumvents the SAM-dependent type I restriction-modification (R-M) defense. We show that SAMase also allows T3 to evade the BREX defense. Although SAM depletion weakly affects BREX methylation, it completely inhibits the defensive function of BREX, suggesting that SAM could be a co-factor for BREX-mediated exclusion of phage DNA, similar to its anti-defense role in type I R-M. The anti-BREX activity of T3 SAMase is mediated not just by enzymatic degradation of SAM but also by direct inhibition of MetK, the host SAM synthase. We present a 2.8 Å cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the eight-subunit T3 SAMase-MetK complex. Structure-guided mutagenesis reveals that this interaction stabilizes T3 SAMase in vivo, further stimulating its anti-BREX activity. This work provides insights in the versatility of bacteriophage counterdefense mechanisms and highlights the role of SAM as a co-factor of diverse bacterial immunity systems.

Abstract: Summary
Evolution of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant has led to the emergence of sublineages with different patterns of neutralizing antibody evasion. We report that Omicron BA.4/BA.5 breakthrough infection of individuals immunized with SARS-CoV-2 wild-type-strain-based mRNA vaccines results in a boost of Omicron BA.4.6, BF.7, BQ.1.1, and BA.2.75 neutralization but does not efficiently boost BA.2.75.2, XBB, or XBB.1.5 neutralization. In silico analyses showed that the Omicron spike glycoprotein lost most neutralizing B cell epitopes, especially in sublineages BA.2.75.2, XBB, and XBB.1.5. In contrast, T cell epitopes are conserved across variants including XBB.1.5. T cell responses of mRNA-vaccinated, SARS-CoV-2-naive individuals against the wild-type strain, Omicron BA.1, and BA.4/BA.5 were comparable, suggesting that T cell immunity against recent sublineages including XBB.1.5 may remain largely unaffected. While some Omicron sublineages effectively evade B cell immunity, spike-protein-specific T cell immunity, due to the nature of polymorphic cell-mediated immune responses, may continue to contribute to prevention/limitation of severe COVID-19 manifestation.

Abstract: Summary
Oligodendrocytes are specialized cells that insulate and support axons with their myelin membrane, allowing proper brain function. Here, we identify lamin A/C (LMNA/C) as essential for transcriptional and functional stability of myelinating oligodendrocytes. We show that LMNA/C levels increase with differentiation of progenitors and that loss of Lmna in differentiated oligodendrocytes profoundly alters their chromatin accessibility and transcriptional signature. Lmna deletion in myelinating glia is compatible with normal developmental myelination. However, altered chromatin accessibility is detected in fully differentiated oligodendrocytes together with increased expression of progenitor genes and decreased levels of lipid-related transcription factors and inner mitochondrial membrane transcripts. These changes are accompanied by altered brain metabolism, lower levels of myelin-related lipids, and altered mitochondrial structure in oligodendrocytes, thereby resulting in myelin thinning and the development of a progressively worsening motor phenotype. Overall, our data identify LMNA/C as essential for maintaining the transcriptional and functional stability of myelinating oligodendrocytes.

Abstract: Summary
3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) somatic mutations represent a largely unexplored avenue of alternative oncogenic gene dysregulation. To determine the significance of 3′ UTR mutations in disease, we identify 3′ UTR somatic variants across 185 advanced prostate tumors, discovering 14,497 single-nucleotide mutations enriched in oncogenic pathways and 3′ UTR regulatory elements. By developing two complementary massively parallel reporter assays, we measure how thousands of patient-based mutations affect mRNA translation and stability and identify hundreds of functional variants that allow us to define determinants of mutation significance. We demonstrate the clinical relevance of these mutations, observing that CRISPR-Cas9 endogenous editing of distinct variants increases cellular stress resistance and that patients harboring oncogenic 3′ UTR mutations have a particularly poor prognosis. This work represents an expansive view of the extent to which disease-relevant 3′ UTR mutations affect mRNA stability, translation, and cancer progression, uncovering principles of regulatory functionality and potential therapeutic targets in previously unexplored regulatory regions.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor mutational burden and heterogeneity has been suggested to fuel resistance to many targeted therapies. The cytosine deaminase APOBEC proteins have been implicated in the mutational signatures of more than 70% of human cancers. However, the mechanism underlying how cancer cells hijack the APOBEC mediated mutagenesis machinery to promote tumor heterogeneity, and thereby foster therapy resistance remains unclear. We identify SYNCRIP as an endogenous molecular brake which suppresses APOBEC-driven mutagenesis in prostate cancer (PCa). Overactivated APOBEC3B, in SYNCRIP-deficient PCa cells, is a key mutator, representing the molecular source of driver mutations in some frequently mutated genes in PCa, including FOXA1, EP300. Functional screening identifies eight crucial drivers for androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapy resistance in PCa that are mutated by APOBEC3B: BRD7, CBX8, EP300, FOXA1, HDAC5, HSF4, STAT3, and AR. These results uncover a cell-intrinsic mechanism that unleashes APOBEC-driven mutagenesis, which plays a significant role in conferring AR-targeted therapy resistance in PCa.

Abstract: Summary
This study reveals a previously uncharacterized mechanism to restrict intestinal inflammation via a regulatory RNA transcribed from a noncoding genomic locus. We identified a novel transcript of the lncRNA HOXA11os specifically expressed in the distal colon that is reduced to undetectable levels in colitis. HOXA11os is localized to mitochondria under basal conditions and interacts with a core subunit of complex 1 of the electron transport chain (ETC) to maintain its activity. Deficiency of HOXA11os in colonic myeloid cells results in complex I deficiency, dysfunctional oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS). As a result, HOXA11os-deficient mice develop spontaneous intestinal inflammation and are hypersusceptible to colitis. Collectively, these studies identify a new regulatory axis whereby a lncRNA maintains intestinal homeostasis and restricts inflammation in the colon through the regulation of complex I activity.

Abstract: Peripheral nerve injury is one of the common disabling clinical conditions and around 50% of the cases end up in permanent impairment. Due to the lack of effective treatment options regenerative medicine employing stem cells is being evaluated. The presented study evaluated and compared regeneration potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from bone marrow (BM) and adipose tissue (AD) in acute rabbit sciatic nerve injury (axonotmesis) model. A total of n = 54 grey giant rabbits were made subject of the study and divided equally into 3 groups: Control, BM-MSCs in Collagen I and AD-MSCs in Collagen I as per the treatment given. Iliac crest BM and omental AD was harvested from the same donor for isolation and culture of MSCs. The repair of sciatic nerve injury was evaluated on days 60 and 90. The clinical and histopathological scores and SEM morphology was better in cell treated groups as compared to the control. Morphology and histological studies revealed injured nerve in different levels of regenerative process. Gene expression was more than double for N-Cadherin in cell treated groups as compared to the control, especially at day 60. Between cell treated groups, BM-MSCs group showed better response as compared to the AD-MSCs, although statistically non-significant (p > 0.05). Incomplete nerve regeneration observed under various diagnostic parameters was in compliance to the incomplete clinical recovery at day 90. It was concluded that MSCs may improve sciatic nerve healing but fall short of complete regeneration at day 90, although BM-MSCs may have an edge over AD-MSCs.

Abstract: Summary
The human placenta exhibits a unique genomic architecture with an unexpectedly high mutation burden and many uniquely expressed genes. The aim of this study is to identify transcripts that are uniquely absent or depleted in the placenta. Here, we show that 40 of 46 of the other organs have no selectively depleted transcripts and that, of the remaining six, the liver has the largest number, with 26. In contrast, the term placenta has 762 depleted transcripts. Gene Ontology analysis of this depleted set highlighted multiple pathways reflecting known unique elements of placental physiology. For example, transcripts associated with neuronal function are in the depleted set—as expected given the lack of placental innervation. However, this demonstrated overrepresentation of genes involved in mitochondrial function (p = 5.8 × 10−10), including PGC-1α, the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, and genes involved in polyamine metabolism (p = 2.1 × 10−4).

Abstract: Summary
Macrophages release soluble mediators following efferocytic clearance of apoptotic cells to facilitate intercellular communication and promote the resolution of inflammation. However, whether inflammation resolution is modulated by extracellular vesicles (EVs) and vesicular mediators released by efferocytes is not known. We report that efferocyte-derived EVs express prosaposin, which binds to macrophage GPR37 to increase expression of the efferocytosis receptor Tim4 via an ERK-AP1-dependent signaling axis, leading to increased macrophage efferocytosis efficiency and accelerated resolution of inflammation. Neutralization and knockdown of prosaposin or blocking GRP37 abrogates the pro-resolution effects of efferocyte-derived EVs in vivo. Administration of efferocyte-derived EVs in a murine model of atherosclerosis is associated with an increase in lesional macrophage efferocytosis efficiency and a decrease in plaque necrosis and lesional inflammation. Thus, we establish a critical role for efferocyte-derived vesicular mediators in increasing macrophage efferocytosis efficiency and accelerating the resolution of inflammation and tissue injury.

Abstract: Over the years, several methods have been developed for the segmentation of cell images. Most of the related techniques operate directly on the raw data (noisy cell samples) of the medical image which leads to adverse effects on the structure of leucocytes because the medical images are affected by multiple distortions (varying illumination, deficient background light intensity, and non-uniform staining). To overcome these problems, we came up with an improved solution that performs the qualitative enhancement of cell images for the smooth extraction of cell-nucleus. Although various segmentation methods have adopted an image improvement operation in practice. These methods also amplify the magnitude of image noise which leads to over-sampling and under-sampling of data points. This mis-labelling of data points is minimized by the developed approach which adopts a collaborative fusion strategy (CNN and Nuclear-norm approach) for the qualitative improvement of cell images. The enhanced cell samples were forwarded to the U-net (deep learning model) model for the semantic segmentation of cell images. The performance evaluation of the model was performed on three biomedical cell imaging datasets, which include the ALL-IDB (99.89% accuracy, 99.51% recall, and 99.01% precision), CellaVision (99.68% accuracy, 98.75% precision, and 97.94% specificity) and JTSC (98.45% accuracy, 97.42% precision, and 97.21% specificity) dataset. The results were compared with the state-of-art methods in which the adopted hybrid approach has overpowered the related techniques in the quantitative and qualitative domains.

Abstract: Summary
Genotoxic stress in mammalian cells, including those caused by anti-cancer chemotherapy, can induce temporary cell-cycle arrest, DNA damage-induced senescence (DDIS), or apoptotic cell death. Despite obvious clinical importance, it is unclear how the signals emerging from DNA damage are integrated together with other cellular signaling pathways monitoring the cell’s environment and/or internal state to control different cell fates. Using single-cell-based signaling measurements combined with tensor partial least square regression (t-PLSR)/principal component analysis (PCA) analysis, we show that JNK and Erk MAPK signaling regulates the initiation of cell senescence through the transcription factor AP-1 at early times after doxorubicin-induced DNA damage and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) at late times after damage. These results identify temporally distinct roles for signaling pathways beyond the classic DNA damage response (DDR) that control the cell senescence decision and modulate the tumor microenvironment and reveal fundamental similarities between signaling pathways responsible for oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) and senescence caused by topoisomerase II inhibition. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: LPS-induced injury in lung epithelial cells is a crucial part of the process of acute lung injury (ALI). The aim of this study is to explore whether Xanthorrhizol, a medicine that has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity, could mitigate the injury of lung epithelial cells caused by LPS. Mouse lung epithelial cell line (MLE-12 cells) were treated with LPS in the absence and presence of Xanthorrhizol. As a results, we observed that LPS could induce MLE-12 cells death, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and inflammation, and activate MAPK signaling pathways. However, Xanthorrhizol mitigated the injury in MEL-12 caused by LPS by promoting cell viability and MDA, GSH production as well as inhibiting LDH release, mitochondria damage, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α production and the phosphorylation levels of ERK, P38 and JNK. Our results indicated that Xanthorrhizol could protect lung epithelial cells from LPS-induced injury, more likely by inhibiting the phosphorylation of MAPK pathway related proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Increased metabolic activity usually provides energy and nutrients for biomass synthesis and is indispensable for the progression of the cell cycle. Here, we find a role for α-ketoglutarate (αKG) generation in regulating cell-cycle gene transcription. A reduction in cellular αKG levels triggered by malic enzyme 2 (ME2) or isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) depletion leads to a pronounced arrest in G1 phase, while αKG supplementation promotes cell-cycle progression. Mechanistically, αKG directly binds to RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and increases the level of RNAPII binding to the cyclin D1 gene promoter via promoting pre-initiation complex (PIC) assembly, consequently enhancing cyclin D1 transcription. Notably, αKG addition is sufficient to restore cyclin D1 expression in ME2- or IDH1-depleted cells, facilitating cell-cycle progression and proliferation in these cells. Therefore, our findings indicate a function of αKG in gene transcriptional regulation and cell-cycle control.

Abstract: Summary
Synaptic zinc signaling modulates synaptic activity and is present in specific populations of cortical neurons, suggesting that synaptic zinc contributes to the diversity of intracortical synaptic microcircuits and their functional specificity. To understand the role of zinc signaling in the cortex, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from intratelencephalic (IT)-type neurons and pyramidal tract (PT)-type neurons in layer 5 of the mouse auditory cortex during optogenetic stimulation of specific classes of presynaptic neurons. Our results show that synaptic zinc potentiates AMPA receptor (AMPAR) function in a synapse-specific manner. We performed in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging of the same classes of neurons in awake mice and found that changes in synaptic zinc can widen or sharpen the sound-frequency tuning bandwidth of IT-type neurons but only widen the tuning bandwidth of PT-type neurons. These results provide evidence for synapse- and cell-type-specific actions of synaptic zinc in the cortex.

Abstract: Summary
Translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) facilitates replication over damaged or difficult-to-replicate templates by employing specialized DNA polymerases. We investigate the effect on spontaneous mutagenesis of three main TLS control mechanisms: REV1 and PCNA ubiquitylation that recruit TLS polymerases and PRIMPOL that creates post-replicative gaps. Using whole-genome sequencing of cultured human RPE-1 cell clones, we find that REV1 and Polymerase ζ are wholly responsible for one component of base substitution mutagenesis that resembles homologous recombination deficiency, whereas the remaining component that approximates oxidative mutagenesis is reduced in PRIMPOL−/− cells. Small deletions in short repeats appear in REV1−/− PCNAK164R/K164R double mutants, revealing an alternative TLS mechanism. Also, 500–5,000 bp deletions appear in REV1−/− and REV3L−/− mutants, and chromosomal instability is detectable in REV1−/− PRIMPOL−/− cells. Our results indicate that TLS protects the genome from deletions and large rearrangements at the expense of being responsible for the majority of spontaneous base substitutions.

Abstract: Summary
Episodic memory involves the recollection of contextual details replayed mentally across time. Here, we propose the association-sequence network (ASN) model, characterizing complementary cortico-hippocampal networks underlying the retrieval of simultaneously associated and sequentially ordered events. Participants viewed objects, presented singly or in pairs, and later reported whether two objects were shown simultaneously, consecutively, or farther apart in time. Behavioral results and hippocampal activation reveal a correlation between the two sequential conditions but not the simultaneous condition, despite the temporal proximity of consecutive pairs. We also find that anterior hippocampal activity is modulated by temporal distance. Distinct cortical networks are engaged during simultaneous and sequential memory (prefrontal cortex and angular gyrus for association; supplementary motor cortex and precuneus for sequence); notably, these regions show differential connectivity with the hippocampus. The ASN model provides a comprehensive framework for how we reconstruct memories that are both rich in associative detail and temporally dynamic in nature.

Abstract: Summary
The dorsal bed nucleus of stria terminalis (dBNST) is a pivotal hub for stress response modulation. Dysfunction of dopamine (DA) network is associated with chronic stress, but the roles of DA network of dBNST in chronic stress-induced emotional disorders remain unclear. We examine the role of dBNST Drd1+ and Drd2+ neurons in post-weaning social isolation (PWSI)-induced behavior deficits. We find that male, but not female, PWSI rats exhibit negative emotional phenotypes and the increase of excitability and E-I balance of dBNST Drd2+ neurons. More importantly, hypofunction of dBNST Drd2 receptor underlies PWSI-stress-induced male-specific neuronal plasticity change of dBNST Drd2+ neurons. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation of dBNST Drd2+ neurons is sufficient to induce anxiogenic effects, while Kir4.1-mediated chronic inhibition of dBNST Drd2+ neurons ameliorate PWSI-induced anxiety-like behaviors. Our findings reveal an important neural mechanism underlying PWSI-induced sex-specific behavioral abnormalities and potentially provide a target for the treatment of social stress-related emotional disorder.

Abstract: Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) research will help elucidate the pathogenesis of hematologic diseases. The present study aimed to establish an isolation method and culture system for chicken bone marrow (BM)-derived HSPCs and test their proliferation and differentiation abilities. Mononuclear cells were collected from chicken BM, and CD34+ HSPCs were isolated. Then, the cells were cultured in media with different cytokine compositions, and the growth status, cell phenotype, and morphological appearance of the cells were analyzed at different time points. Our results showed that Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s Medium supplemented with 50 ng/mL stem cell factor, 30 ng/mL Flt-3 ligand, 10 μg/mL interleukin 3, 50 ng/mL interleukin 6%, and 10% chicken serum supported chicken CD34+ HSPC survival ex vivo for approximately 10 d. Further, 80 ng/mL granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and 30 ng/mL granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor were added into the above culture system to form a myeloid cell differentiation induction culture system. After culturing in this system for 72 h, approximately 66% of chicken CD34+ HSPCs exhibited a CD11b+ phenotype, indicating that HSPCs differentiated into myeloid cells. In conclusion, chicken BM-derived CD34+ cells possess HSPC characteristics that can self-renew and differentiate into myeloid cells in a culture medium containing growth factors.

Abstract: Summary
Cancers often display immune escape, but the mechanisms are incompletely understood. Herein, we identify SMYD3 as a mediator of immune escape in human papilloma virus (HPV)-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), an aggressive disease with poor response to immunotherapy with pembrolizumab. SMYD3 depletion induces upregulation of multiple type I interferon (IFN) response and antigen presentation machinery genes in HNSCC cells. Mechanistically, SMYD3 binds to and regulates the transcription of UHRF1, encoding for a reader of H3K9me3, which binds to H3K9me3-enriched promoters of key immune-related genes, recruits DNMT1, and silences their expression. SMYD3 further maintains the repression of immune-related genes through intragenic deposition of H4K20me3. In vivo, Smyd3 depletion induces influx of CD8+ T cells and increases sensitivity to anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) therapy. SMYD3 overexpression is associated with decreased CD8 T cell infiltration and poor response to neoadjuvant pembrolizumab. These data support combining SMYD3 depletion strategies with checkpoint blockade to overcome anti-PD-1 resistance in HPV-negative HNSCC.

Abstract: Summary
Ubiquitin-dependent control of mitochondrial dynamics is important for protein quality and neuronal integrity. Mitofusins, mitochondrial fusion factors, can integrate cellular stress through their ubiquitylation, which is carried out by multiple E3 enzymes in response to many different stimuli. However, the molecular mechanisms that enable coordinated responses are largely unknown. Here we show that yeast Ufd2, a conserved ubiquitin chain-elongating E4 enzyme, is required for mitochondrial shape adjustments. Under various stresses, Ufd2 translocates to mitochondria and triggers mitofusin ubiquitylation. This elongates ubiquitin chains on mitofusin and promotes its proteasomal degradation, leading to mitochondrial fragmentation. Ufd2 and its human homologue UBE4B also target mitofusin mutants associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a hereditary sensory and motor neuropathy characterized by progressive loss of the peripheral nerves. This underscores the pathophysiological importance of E4-mediated ubiquitylation in neurodegeneration. In summary, we identify E4-dependent mitochondrial stress adaptation by linking various metabolic processes to mitochondrial fusion and fission dynamics.

Abstract: Summary
During eukaryotic DNA replication, Pol α-primase generates primers at replication origins to start leading-strand synthesis and every few hundred nucleotides during discontinuous lagging-strand replication. How Pol α-primase is targeted to replication forks to prime DNA synthesis is not fully understood. Here, by determining cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of budding yeast and human replisomes containing Pol α-primase, we reveal a conserved mechanism for the coordination of priming by the replisome. Pol α-primase binds directly to the leading edge of the CMG (CDC45-MCM-GINS) replicative helicase via a complex interaction network. The non-catalytic PRIM2/Pri2 subunit forms two interfaces with CMG that are critical for in vitro DNA replication and yeast cell growth. These interactions position the primase catalytic subunit PRIM1/Pri1 directly above the exit channel for lagging-strand template single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), revealing why priming occurs efficiently only on the lagging-strand template and elucidating a mechanism for Pol α-primase to overcome competition from RPA to initiate primer synthesis.

Abstract: Summary
The complex morphology of neurons poses a challenge for proteostasis because the majority of lysosomal degradation machinery is present in the cell soma. In recent years, however, mature lysosomes were identified in dendrites, and a fraction of those appear to fuse with the plasma membrane and release their content to the extracellular space. Here, we report that dendritic lysosomes are heterogeneous in their composition and that only those containing lysosome-associated membrane protein (LAMP) 2A and 2B fuse with the membrane and exhibit activity-dependent motility. Exocytotic lysosomes dock in close proximity to GluN2B-containing N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptors (NMDAR) via an association of LAMP2B to the membrane-associated guanylate kinase family member SAP102/Dlg3. NMDAR-activation decreases lysosome motility and promotes membrane fusion. We find that chaperone-mediated autophagy is a supplier of content that is released to the extracellular space via lysosome exocytosis. This mechanism enables local disposal of aggregation-prone proteins like TDP-43 and huntingtin.

Abstract: Summary
The binding of transcription factors (TFs) along genomes is restricted to a subset of sites containing their preferred motifs. TF-binding specificity is often attributed to the co-binding of interacting TFs; however, apart from specific examples, this model remains untested. Here, we define dependencies among budding yeast TFs that localize to overlapping promoters by profiling the genome-wide consequences of co-depleting multiple TFs. We describe unidirectional interactions, revealing Msn2 as a central factor allowing TF binding at its target promoters. By contrast, no case of mutual cooperation was observed. Particularly, Msn2 retained binding at its preferred promoters upon co-depletion of fourteen similarly bound TFs. Overall, the consequences of TF co-depletions were moderate, limited to a subset of promoters, and failed to explain the role of regions outside the DNA-binding domain in directing TF-binding preferences. Our results call for re-evaluating the role of cooperative interactions in directing TF-binding preferences.
