Abstract: Summary
Nervous systems maintain information internally using persistent activity changes. The mechanisms by which this activity arises are incompletely understood. We study prefrontal cortex (PFC) in mice performing behaviors in which stimuli predicted rewards at different delays with different probabilities. We measure membrane potential (Vm) from pyramidal neurons across layers. Reward-predictive persistent firing increases arise due to sustained increases in mean and variance of Vm and are terminated by reward or via centrally generated mechanisms based on reward expectation. Other neurons show persistent decreases in firing rates, maintained by persistent hyperpolarization that is robust to intracellular perturbation. Persistent activity is layer (L)- and cell-type-specific. Neurons with persistent depolarization are primarily located in upper L5, whereas those with persistent hyperpolarization are mostly found in lower L5. L2/3 neurons do not show persistent activity. Thus, reward-predictive persistent activity in PFC is spatially organized and conveys information about internal state via synaptic mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
Hsp70s comprise a deeply conserved chaperone family that has a central role in maintaining protein homeostasis. In humans, Hsp70 client specificity is provided by 49 different co-factors known as J domain proteins (JDPs). However, the cellular function and client specificity of JDPs have largely remained elusive. We have combined affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) and proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID) to characterize the interactome of all human JDPs and Hsp70s. The resulting network suggests specific functions for many uncharacterized JDPs, and we establish a role of conserved JDPs DNAJC9 and DNAJC27 in histone chaperoning and ciliogenesis, respectively. Unexpectedly, we find that the J domain of DNAJC27 but not of other JDPs can fully replace the function of endogenous DNAJC27, suggesting a previously unappreciated role for J domains themselves in JDP specificity. More broadly, our work expands the role of the Hsp70-regulated proteostasis network and provides a platform for further discovery of JDP-dependent functions.

Abstract: Bacteria encase their cytoplasmic membrane with peptidoglycan (PG) to maintain the shape of the cell and protect it from bursting. The enlargement of the PG layer is facilitated by the coordinated activities of PG synthesising and -cleaving enzymes. In Escherichia coli, the cytoplasmic membrane-bound lytic transglycosylase MltG associates with PG synthases and was suggested to terminate the polymerisation of PG glycan strands. Using pull-down and surface plasmon resonance, we detected interactions between MltG from Bacillus subtilis and two PG synthases; the class A PBP1 and the class B PBP2B. Using in vitro PG synthesis assays with radio-labelled or fluorophore-labelled B. subtilis-type and/or E. coli-type lipid II, we showed that both, BsMltG and EcMltG, are lytic tranglycosylases and that their activity is higher during ongoing glycan strand polymerisation. MltG competed with the transpeptidase activity of class A PBPs, but had no effect on their glycosyltransferase activity, and produced glycan strands with a length of 7 disaccharide units from cleavage in the nascent strands. We hypothesize that MltG cleaves the nascent strands to produce short glycan strands that are used in the cell for a yet unknown process.

Abstract: Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have been shown to have an ability to form a large number of functional endothelial cells in vitro, but generating organ-specific endothelial cells remains a challenge. Sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway is one of the crucial developmental pathways that control differentiation of many embryonic cell types such as neuroectodermal, primitive gut tube and developing limb buds; SHH pathway is important for functioning of adult cell of skin, bone, liver as well as it regulates haematopoiesis. Misregulation of SHH pathway leads to cancers such as hepatic, pancreatic, basal cell carcinoma, medulloblastoma, etc. However, its role in differentiation of human ESCs into endothelial cells has not been completely elucidated. Here, we examined the role of SHH signalling pathway in endothelial differentiation of hESCs by growing them in the presence of an SHH agonist (purmorphamine) and an SHH antagonist (SANT-1) for a period of 6 days. Interestingly, we found that activation of SHH pathway led to a higher expression of set of transcription factors such as BRACHYURY, GATA2 and RUNX1, thus favouring hemogenic endothelium; whereas inhibition of SHH pathway led to a reduced expression of set of markers such as RUNX1 and BRACHURY, and an increased expression of set of markers - NFATC1, c-KIT, GATA4, CD31 & CD34, thus favouring endocardiogenic endothelium. The results of this study have revealed the previously unreported deterministic role of SHH pathway in specification of endothelial cells differentiated from human ESCs into hemogenic vs. endocardiogenic lineage; this finding could have major implications for clinical applications.

Abstract: Summary
Circulating polymers of α1-antitrypsin (α1AT) are neutrophil chemo-attractants and contribute to inflammation, yet cellular factors affecting their secretion remain obscure. We report on a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen for genes affecting trafficking of polymerogenic α1ATH334D. A CRISPR enrichment approach based on recovery of single guide RNA (sgRNA) sequences from phenotypically selected fixed cells reveals that cells with high-polymer content are enriched in sgRNAs targeting genes involved in “cargo loading into COPII-coated vesicles,” where “COPII” is coat protein II, including the cargo receptors lectin mannose binding1 (LMAN1) and surfeit protein locus 4 (SURF4). LMAN1- and SURF4-disrupted cells display a secretion defect extending beyond α1AT monomers to polymers. Polymer secretion is especially dependent on SURF4 and correlates with a SURF4-α1ATH334D physical interaction and with their co-localization at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These findings indicate that ER cargo receptors co-ordinate progression of α1AT out of the ER and modulate the accumulation of polymeric α1AT not only by controlling the concentration of precursor monomers but also by promoting secretion of polymers.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the epigenomic evolution and specificity of disease subtypes from complex patient data remains a major biomedical problem. We here present DeCET (decomposition and classification of epigenomic tensors), an integrative computational approach for simultaneously analyzing hierarchical heterogeneous data, to identify robust epigenomic differences among tissue types, differentiation states, and disease subtypes. Applying DeCET to our own data from 21 uterine benign tumor (leiomyoma) patients identifies distinct epigenomic features discriminating normal myometrium and leiomyoma subtypes. Leiomyomas possess preponderant alterations in distal enhancers and long-range histone modifications confined to chromatin contact domains that constrain the evolution of pathological epigenomes. Moreover, we demonstrate the power and advantage of DeCET on multiple publicly available epigenomic datasets representing different cancers and cellular states. Epigenomic features extracted by DeCET can thus help improve our understanding of disease states, cellular development, and differentiation, thereby facilitating future therapeutic, diagnostic, and prognostic strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Antibodies targeting the NANP/NVDP repeat domain of the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSPRepeat) can protect against malaria. However, it has also been suggested that the CSPRepeat is a decoy that prevents the immune system from mounting responses against other domains of CSP. Here, we show that, following parasite immunization, B cell responses to the CSPRepeat are immunodominant over responses to other CSP domains despite the presence of similar numbers of naive B cells able to bind these regions. We find that this immunodominance is driven by avid binding of the CSPRepeat to cognate B cells that are able to expand at the expense of B cells with other specificities. We further show that mice immunized with repeat-truncated CSP molecules develop responses to subdominant epitopes and are protected against malaria. These data demonstrate that the CSPRepeat functions as a decoy, but truncated CSP molecules may be an approach for malaria vaccination.

Abstract: Summary
It is unclear whether individuals with enormous diversity in B cell receptor repertoires are consistently able to mount effective antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2. We analyzed antibody responses in a cohort of 55 convalescent patients and isolated 54 potent neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). While most of the mAbs target the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding surface on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, mAb 47D1 binds only to one side of the receptor binding surface on the RBD. Neutralization by 47D1 is achieved independent of interfering RBD-ACE2 binding. A crystal structure of the mAb-RBD complex shows that the IF motif at the tip of 47D1 CDR H2 interacts with a hydrophobic pocket in the RBD. Diverse immunoglobulin gene usage and convergent epitope targeting characterize neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that vaccines that effectively present the receptor binding site on the RBD will likely elicit neutralizing antibody responses in a large fraction of the population.

Abstract: Summary
Organismal stressors such as cold exposure require a systemic response to maintain body temperature. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a key thermogenic tissue in mammals that protects against hypothermia in response to cold exposure. Defining the complex interplay of multiple organ systems in this response is fundamental to our understanding of adipose tissue thermogenesis. In this study, we identify a role for hepatic insulin signaling via AKT in the adaptive response to cold stress and show that liver AKT is an essential cell-nonautonomous regulator of adipocyte lipolysis and BAT function. Mechanistically, inhibition of forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) by AKT controls BAT thermogenesis by enhancing catecholamine-induced lipolysis in the white adipose tissue (WAT) and increasing circulating fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21). Our data identify a role for hepatic insulin signaling via the AKT-FOXO1 axis in regulating WAT lipolysis, promoting BAT thermogenic capacity, and ensuring a proper thermogenic response to acute cold exposure.

Abstract: Summary
Synapse loss and altered synaptic strength are thought to underlie cognitive impairment in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) by disrupting neural activity essential for memory. While synaptic dysfunction in AD has been well characterized in anesthetized animals and in vitro, it remains unknown how synaptic transmission is altered during behavior. By measuring synaptic efficacy as mice navigate in a virtual reality task, we find deficits in interneuron connection strength onto pyramidal cells in hippocampal CA1 in the 5XFAD mouse model of AD. These inhibitory synaptic deficits are most pronounced during sharp-wave ripples, network oscillations important for memory that require inhibition. Indeed, 5XFAD mice exhibit fewer and shorter sharp-wave ripples with impaired place cell reactivation. By showing inhibitory synaptic dysfunction in 5XFAD mice during spatial navigation behavior and suggesting a synaptic mechanism underlying deficits in network activity essential for memory, this work bridges the gap between synaptic and neural activity deficits in AD.

Abstract: Summary
Plant-nectar-derived sugar is the major energy source for mosquitoes, but its influence on vector competence for malaria parasites remains unclear. Here, we show that Plasmodium berghei infection of Anopheles stephensi results in global metabolome changes, with the most significant impact on glucose metabolism. Feeding on glucose or trehalose (the main hemolymph sugars) renders the mosquito more susceptible to Plasmodium infection by alkalizing the mosquito midgut. The glucose/trehalose diets promote proliferation of a commensal bacterium, Asaia bogorensis, that remodels glucose metabolism in a way that increases midgut pH, thereby promoting Plasmodium gametogenesis. We also demonstrate that the sugar composition from different natural plant nectars influences A. bogorensis growth, resulting in a greater permissiveness to Plasmodium. Altogether, our results demonstrate that dietary glucose is an important determinant of mosquito vector competency for Plasmodium, further highlighting a key role for mosquito-microbiota interactions in regulating the development of the malaria parasite.

Abstract: Summary
Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis are the two major pathways for ATP production. The reliance on each varies across tissues and cell states, and can influence susceptibility to disease. At present, the full set of molecular mechanisms governing the relative expression and balance of these two pathways is unknown. Here, we focus on genes whose loss leads to an increase in OXPHOS activity. Unexpectedly, this class of genes is enriched for components of the pre-mRNA splicing machinery, in particular for subunits of the U1 snRNP. Among them, we show that LUC7L2 represses OXPHOS and promotes glycolysis by multiple mechanisms, including (1) splicing of the glycolytic enzyme PFKM to suppress glycogen synthesis, (2) splicing of the cystine/glutamate antiporter SLC7A11 (xCT) to suppress glutamate oxidation, and (3) secondary repression of mitochondrial respiratory supercomplex formation. Our results connect LUC7L2 expression and, more generally, the U1 snRNP to cellular energy metabolism.

Abstract: Dermal fibroblasts are a promising candidate for cellular-based therapies for thermal wound healing because of their capacity of producing extracellular matrix (ECM), promoting wound contraction and the synthesis of type I collagen, and secreting growth factors. miRNAs (MicroRNAs) might mediate the role of TGF-β1(Transforming Growth Factor-beta 1), one of the major profibrotic cytokines, in improving thermal injury repair. In the present study, we observed the abnormal downregulation of TGF-β1 following thermal injury in the burnt dermis (in vivo) and heat-stimulated human dermal fibroblasts (in vitro). TGF-β1 overexpression reversed heat stimulation-induced repression on fibroblast viability, migration, and ECM synthesis. As demonstrated by online tool prediction and experimental analysis, miR-506-3p downregulated TGF-β1 levels via directly targeting TGFB1. In heat-stimulated human dermal fibroblasts, miR-506-3p expression showed to be significantly upregulated. miR-506-3p inhibition also reversed heat stimulation-induced repression on fibroblast viability, migration, and ECM synthesis; more importantly, TGF-β1 silencing aggravated the thermal injury in vitro and significantly reversed the effects of miR-506-3p inhibition on heat-stimulated dermal fibroblasts. In conclusion, miR-506-3p and its downstream target TGF-β1 form a regulatory axis, modulating the cell viability, migration, and ECM synthesis in human dermal fibroblasts following burn injury.

Abstract: Summary
Patients with cancer experience a higher burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection, disease severity, complications, and mortality, than the general population. SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines are highly effective in the general population; however, few data are available on their efficacy in patients with cancer. Using a prospective cohort, we assessed the seroconversion rates and anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibody titers following the first and second dose of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients with cancer in US and Europe from January to April 2021. Among 131 patients, most (94%) achieved seroconversion after receipt of two vaccine doses. Seroconversion rates and antibody titers in patients with hematological malignancy were significantly lower than those with solid tumors. None of the patients with history of anti-CD-20 antibody in the 6 months before vaccination developed antibody response. Antibody titers were highest for clinical surveillance or endocrine therapy groups and lowest for cytotoxic chemotherapy or monoclonal antibody groups.

Abstract: While decidualization is essential for embryo implantation in the context of a normal pregnancy, the molecular basis for this process remains poorly understood. Ubiquitin-specific protease 22 (Usp22), one of the deubiquitinating enzymes, is an important regulator of tumor progression and knocking out this gene in mice results in placental vascular dysplasia and embryonic lethality. In this study, we first demonstrated that Usp22 is spatiotemporally expressed in the mouse peri-implantation uterus. Under artificial decidualization, Usp22 upregulation was detected in both in vivo and in vitro. Progesterone treatment could stimulate Usp22 expression in mouse endometrial stromal cells through progesterone/progesterone receptor (PR) pathway, which is inhibited by PR antagonist. The downregulation of Usp22 within mouse endometrial stomal cells by shRNA impaired their ability to proliferate and undergo decidualization. Taken together, these results suggest that Usp22 is involved in uterine stromal decidualization in mice.

Abstract: Summary
Findings about chronic complex diseases are difficult to extrapolate from animal models to humans. We reason that organs may have core network modules that are preserved between species and are predictably altered when homeostasis is disrupted. To test this idea, we perturbed hepatic homeostasis in mice by dietary challenge and compared the liver transcriptome with that in human fatty liver disease and liver cancer. Co-expression module preservation analysis pointed to alterations in immune responses and metabolism (core modules) in both human and mouse datasets. The extent of derailment in core modules was predictive of survival in the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) liver cancer dataset. We identified module eigengene quantitative trait loci (module-eQTL) for these predictive co-expression modules, targeting of which may resolve homeostatic perturbations and improve patient outcomes. The framework presented can be used to understand homeostasis at systems levels in pre-clinical models and in humans. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
Repair pathway “choice” at stalled mammalian replication forks is an important determinant of genome stability; however, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. FANCM encodes a multi-domain scaffolding and motor protein that interacts with several distinct repair protein complexes at stalled forks. Here, we use defined mutations engineered within endogenous Fancm in mouse embryonic stem cells to study how Fancm regulates stalled fork repair. We find that distinct FANCM repair functions are enacted by molecularly separable scaffolding domains. These findings define FANCM as a key mediator of repair pathway choice at stalled replication forks and reveal its molecular mechanism. Notably, mutations that inactivate FANCM ATPase function disable all its repair functions and “trap” FANCM at stalled forks. We find that Brca1 hypomorphic mutants are synthetic lethal with Fancm null or Fancm ATPase-defective mutants. The ATPase function of FANCM may therefore represent a promising “druggable” target for therapy of BRCA1-linked cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The primary cilium (PC) regulates signalization linked to external stress sensing. Previous works established a functional interplay between the PC and the autophagic machinery. When ciliogenesis is promoted by serum deprivation, the autophagy protein ATG16L1 and the ciliary protein IFT20 are co-transported to the PC. Here, we demonstrate that IFT20 and ATG16L1 are part of the same complex requiring the WD40 domain of ATG16L1 and a Y-E-F-I motif in IFT20. We show that ATG16L1-deficient cells exhibit aberrant ciliary structures, which accumulate PI4,5P2, whereas PI4P, a lipid normally concentrated in the PC, is absent. Finally, we demonstrate that INPP5E, a phosphoinositide-associated phosphatase responsible for PI4P generation, interacts with ATG16L1 and that a perturbation of the ATG16L1/IFT20 complex alters its trafficking to the PC. Altogether, our results reveal a function of ATG16L1 in ciliary lipid and protein trafficking, thus directly contributing to proper PC dynamics and functions.

Abstract: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is an intracellular human pathogen that has evolved to survive in a nutrient limited environment within the host for decades. Accordingly, Mtb has developed strategies to acquire scarce nutrients and the mycobacterial transporter systems provide an important route for the import of key energy sources. However, the physiological role of the Mtb transporters and their substrate preference(s) are poorly characterised. Previous studies have established that the Mtb UspC solute-binding domain recognises amino- and phosphorylated-sugars, indicating that the mycobacterial UspABC transporter plays a key role in the import of peptidoglycan precursors. Herein, we have used a wide array of approaches to investigate the role of UspABC in Mycobacterium smegmatis by analysis of mutant strains that either lack the solute binding domain: ΔuspC or the entire transport complex: ΔuspABC. Analysis of mycobacterial transcripts shows that the uspABC system is functionally expressed in mycobacteria as a contiguous reading frame. Topology mapping confirms an Nin-Cin orientation of the UspAB integral membrane spanning domains. Phenotypic microarray profiling of commercially available sugars suggests, unexpectedly, that the uspC and ΔuspABC mutants had different carbon utilisation profiles and that neither strain utilised glucose-1-phosphate. Furthermore, proteomics analysis showed an alteration in the abundance of proteins involved in sugar and lipid metabolism, crucial for cell envelope synthesis, and we propose that UspABC has an important role in determining the interplay between these pathways.

Abstract: Summary
PI5P4Ks are a class of phosphoinositide kinases that phosphorylate PI-5-P to PI-4,5-P2. Distinct localization of phosphoinositides is fundamental for a multitude of cellular functions. Here, we identify a role for peroxisomal PI-4,5-P2 generated by the PI5P4Ks in maintaining energy balance. We demonstrate that PI-4,5-P2 regulates peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation by mediating trafficking of lipid droplets to peroxisomes, which is essential for sustaining mitochondrial metabolism. Using fluorescent-tagged lipids and metabolite tracing, we show that loss of the PI5P4Ks significantly impairs lipid uptake and β-oxidation in the mitochondria. Further, loss of PI5P4Ks results in dramatic alterations in mitochondrial structural and functional integrity, which under nutrient deprivation is further exacerbated, causing cell death. Notably, inhibition of the PI5P4Ks in cancer cells and mouse tumor models leads to decreased cell viability and tumor growth, respectively. Together, these studies reveal an unexplored role for PI5P4Ks in preserving metabolic homeostasis, which is necessary for tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Tumor cells modulate immune responses by secreting exosomes. Tumor exosomes can affect the metabolism of immune cells and increase immune inhibitory molecules such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). PD-1 inhibits the glycolysis pathway in immune cells. We investigated the role of tumor exosomes in how metabolic changes occur through the PD1-GLUT1-HK2 metabolic axisin peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The MDA-MB-231 cell line was cultured, serum samples from breast cancer patients were collected, and exosomes purified from serum samples and the MDA-MB-231 cell line. PBMCs were treated with purified exosomes for 72 h and, the expression of PD1-GLUT1-HK2 genes was measured by real-time PCR. Our study results showed relative expression of the HK2 gene in both groups treated with MDA-MB-231 cell line exosomes and serum exosomes of breast cancer patients was significantly increased compared to the control group (p < 0.0001). Also, the relative expression of the PD1 gene and GLUT1 gene showed a significant increase compared to the control group only in the group treated with MDA-MB-231 cell line exosomes (p < 0.0001). Therefore, Breast cancer exosomes increased the expression of key genes in the glycolysis pathway, increasing the glycolysis pathway in PBMCs. Increased expression of PD-1 could not prevent the expression of critical genes in the glycolysis pathway as in previous studies.

Abstract: Summary
While immune checkpoint blockade is associated with prolonged responses in multiple cancers, most patients still do not benefit from this therapeutic strategy. The Wnt-β-catenin pathway is associated with diminished T cell infiltration; however, activating mutations are rare, implicating a role for autocrine/paracrine Wnt ligand-driven signaling in immune evasion. In this study, we show that proximal mediators of the Wnt signaling pathway are associated with anti-PD-1 resistance, and pharmacologic inhibition of Wnt ligand signaling supports anti-PD-1 efficacy by reversing dendritic cell tolerization and the recruitment of granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells in autochthonous tumor models. We further demonstrate that the inhibition of Wnt signaling promotes the development of a tumor microenvironment that is more conducive to favorable responses to checkpoint blockade in cancer patients. These findings support a rationale for Wnt ligand-focused treatment approaches in future immunotherapy clinical trials and suggest a strategy for selecting those tumors more responsive to Wnt inhibition.

Abstract: Catalyzed by zDHHC-PAT enzymes and reversed by thioesterases, protein palmitoylation is the only post-translational modification recognized to regulate the sodium/calcium exchanger NCX1. NCX1 palmitoylation occurs at a single site at position 739 in its large regulatory intracellular loop. An amphipathic ɑ-helix between residues 740–756 is a critical for NCX1 palmitoylation. Given the rich background of the structural elements involving in NCX1 palmitoylation, the molecular basis of NCX1 palmitoylation is still relatively poorly understood. Here we found that (1) the identity of palmitoylation machinery of NCX1 controls its spatial organization within the cell, (2) the NCX1 amphipathic ɑ-helix directly interacts with zDHHC-PATs, (3) NCX1 is still palmitoylated when it is arrested in either Golgi or ER, indicating that NCX1 is a substrate for multiple zDHHC-PATs, (4) the thioesterase APT1 but not APT2 as a part of NCX1-depalmitoylation machinery governs subcellular organization of NCX1, (5) APT1 catalyzes NCX1 depalmitoylation in the Golgi but not in the ER. We also report that NCX2 and NCX3 are dually palmitoylated, with important implications for substrate recognition and enzyme catalysis by zDHHC-PATs. Our results could support new molecular or pharmacological strategies targeting the NCX1 palmitoylation and depalmitoylation machinery.

Abstract: Summary
The type I interferon (IFN) pathway is a key component of innate immune response upon invasion of foreign pathogens. It is also under precise control to prevent excessive upregulation and undesired inflammation cascade. In the present study, we report that Riok3, an atypical kinase, negatively regulates retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) sensing-induced type I IFN signaling. Riok3 deficiency selectively inhibits RNA viral replication in vitro, resulting from an upregulated type I IFN pathway. Mice with myeloid-specific Riok3 knockout also show a more robust induction of type I IFN upon RNA virus infection and are more resistant to RNA virus-induced pathogenesis. Mechanistically, Riok3 recruits and interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM40, leading to the degradation of RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated gene-5 (MDA5) via K48- and K27-linked ubiquitination. Collectively, our data reveal the mechanism that Riok3 employs to be a negative regulator of antiviral innate immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Emerging evidence suggests a key contribution to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathogenesis by Th17 cells. The pathogenic characteristics and mechanisms of hepatic Th17 cells, however, remain unknown. Here, we uncover and characterize a distinct population of inflammatory hepatic CXCR3+Th17 (ihTh17) cells sufficient to exacerbate NAFLD pathogenesis. Hepatic ihTh17 cell accrual was dependent on the liver microenvironment and CXCR3 axis activation. Mechanistically, the pathogenic potential of ihTh17 cells correlated with increased chromatin accessibility, glycolytic output, and concomitant production of IL-17A, IFNγ, and TNFα. Modulation of glycolysis using 2-DG or cell-specific PKM2 deletion was sufficient to reverse ihTh17-centric inflammatory vigor and NAFLD severity. Importantly, ihTh17 cell characteristics, CXCR3 axis activation, and hepatic expression of glycolytic genes were conserved in human NAFLD. Together, our data show that the steatotic liver microenvironment regulates Th17 cell accrual, metabolism, and competence toward an ihTh17 fate. Modulation of these pathways holds potential for development of novel therapeutic strategies for NAFLD.

Abstract: Summary
p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) regulates both the DNA damage response and p53 signaling. Although 53BP1’s function is well established in DNA double-strand break repair, how its role in p53 signaling is modulated remains poorly understood. Here, we identify the scaffolding protein AHNAK as a G1 phase-enriched interactor of 53BP1. We demonstrate that AHNAK binds to the 53BP1 oligomerization domain and controls its multimerization potential. Loss of AHNAK results in hyper-accumulation of 53BP1 on chromatin and enhanced phase separation, culminating in an elevated p53 response, compromising cell survival in cancer cells but leading to senescence in non-transformed cells. Cancer transcriptome analyses indicate that AHNAK-53BP1 cooperation contributes to the suppression of p53 target gene networks in tumors and that loss of AHNAK sensitizes cells to combinatorial cancer treatments. These findings highlight AHNAK as a rheostat of 53BP1 function, which surveys cell proliferation by preventing an excessive p53 response.

Abstract: Summary
Cardiac pacemaker cells (CPCs) rhythmically initiate the electrical impulses that drive heart contraction. CPCs display the highest rate of spontaneous depolarization in the heart despite being subjected to inhibitory electrochemical conditions that should theoretically suppress their activity. While several models have been proposed to explain this apparent paradox, the actual molecular mechanisms that allow CPCs to overcome electrogenic barriers to their function remain poorly understood. Here, we have traced CPC development at single-cell resolution and uncovered a series of cytoarchitectural patterning events that are critical for proper pacemaking. Specifically, our data reveal that CPCs dynamically modulate adherens junction (AJ) engagement to control characteristics including surface area, volume, and gap junctional coupling. This allows CPCs to adopt a structural configuration that supports their overall excitability. Thus, our data have identified a direct role for local cellular mechanics in patterning critical morphological features that are necessary for CPC electrical activity.

Abstract: Summary
Fast axonal transport of neuropeptide-containing dense core vesicles (DCVs), endolysosomal organelles, and presynaptic components is critical for maintaining neuronal functionality. How the transport of DCVs is orchestrated remains an important unresolved question. The small GTPase Rab2 mediates DCV biogenesis and endosome-lysosome fusion. Here, we use Drosophila to demonstrate that Rab2 also plays a critical role in bidirectional axonal transport of DCVs, endosomes, and lysosomal organelles, most likely by controlling molecular motors. We further show that the lysosomal motility factor Arl8 is required as well for axonal transport of DCVs, but unlike Rab2, it is also critical for DCV exit from cell bodies into axons. We also provide evidence that the upstream regulators of Rab2 and Arl8, Ema and BORC, activate these GTPases during DCV transport. Our results uncover the mechanisms underlying axonal transport of DCVs and reveal surprising parallels between the regulation of DCV and lysosomal motility.

Abstract: Summary
The colon epithelium is a primary point of interaction with the microbiome and is regenerated by a few rapidly cycling colonic stem cells (CSCs). CSC self-renewal and proliferation are regulated by growth factors and the presence of bacteria. However, the molecular link connecting the diverse inputs that maintain CSC homeostasis remains largely unknown. We report that CSC proliferation is mediated by redox-dependent activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling via NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1). NOX1 expression is CSC specific and is restricted to proliferative CSCs. In the absence of NOX1, CSCs fail to generate ROS and have a reduced proliferation rate. NOX1 expression is regulated by Toll-like receptor activation in response to the microbiota and serves to link CSC proliferation with the presence of bacterial components in the crypt. The TLR-NOX1-EGFR axis is therefore a critical redox signaling node in CSCs facilitating the quiescent-proliferation transition and responds to the microbiome to maintain colon homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Increased vascular permeability and leakage are hallmarks of several pathologies and determine disease progression and severity by facilitating inflammatory/metastatic cell infiltration. Using tissue-specific genetic ablation in endothelial cells, we have investigated in vivo the role of Tumor progression locus 2 (Tpl2), a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) member with pleiotropic effects in inflammation and cancer. In response to proinflammatory stimuli, endothelial Tpl2 deletion alters tight junction claudin-5 protein expression through inhibition of JNK signaling and lysosomal degradation activation, resulting in reduced vascular permeability and immune cell infiltration. This results in significantly attenuated disease scores in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and fewer tumor nodules in a hematogenic lung cancer metastasis model. Accordingly, pharmacologic inhibition of Tpl2 or small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated Tpl2 knockdown recapitulates our findings and reduces lung metastatic tumor invasions. These results establish an endothelial-specific role for Tpl2 and highlight the therapeutic potential of blocking the endothelial-specific Tpl2 pathway in chronic inflammatory and metastatic diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The γ-chain receptor dimerizes with complexes of the cytokines interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21 and their corresponding “private” receptors. These cytokines have existing uses and future potential as immune therapies because of their ability to regulate the abundance and function of specific immune cell populations. Here, we build a binding reaction model for the ligand-receptor interactions of common γ-chain cytokines, which includes receptor trafficking dynamics, enabling quantitative predictions of cell-type-specific response to natural and engineered cytokines. We then show that tensor factorization is a powerful tool to visualize changes in the input-output behavior of the family across time, cell types, ligands, and concentrations. These results present a more accurate model of ligand response validated across a panel of immune cell types as well as a general approach for generating interpretable guidelines for manipulation of cell-type-specific targeting of engineered ligands.

Abstract: Summary
Complex I (CI) is the largest enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, and its defects are the main cause of mitochondrial disease. To understand the mechanisms regulating the extremely intricate biogenesis of this fundamental bioenergetic machine, we analyze the structural and functional consequences of the ablation of NDUFS3, a non-catalytic core subunit. We show that, in diverse mammalian cell types, a small amount of functional CI can still be detected in the complete absence of NDUFS3. In addition, we determine the dynamics of CI disassembly when the amount of NDUFS3 is gradually decreased. The process of degradation of the complex occurs in a hierarchical and modular fashion in which the ND4 module remains stable and bound to TMEM126A. We, thus, uncover the function of TMEM126A, the product of a disease gene causing recessive optic atrophy as a factor necessary for the correct assembly and function of CI.

Abstract: Summary
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) evades most innate immune responses but may still be vulnerable to some. Here, we systematically analyze the impact of SARS-CoV-2 proteins on interferon (IFN) responses and autophagy. We show that SARS-CoV-2 proteins synergize to counteract anti-viral immune responses. For example, Nsp14 targets the type I IFN receptor for lysosomal degradation, ORF3a prevents fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes, and ORF7a interferes with autophagosome acidification. Most activities are evolutionarily conserved. However, SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 antagonizes IFN signaling less efficiently than the orthologs of closely related RaTG13-CoV and SARS-CoV-1. Overall, SARS-CoV-2 proteins counteract autophagy and type I IFN more efficiently than type II or III IFN signaling, and infection experiments confirm potent inhibition by IFN-γ and -λ1. Our results define the repertoire and selected mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 innate immune antagonists but also reveal vulnerability to type II and III IFN that may help to develop safe and effective anti-viral approaches.

Abstract: Summary
Orientation and navigation behaviors of animals are modulated by past experiences. However, little is known about the mechanisms by which sensory inputs are translated into multi-directional orientation behaviors in an experience-dependent manner. Here, we report a neural mechanism for bidirectional salt-concentration chemotaxis of Caenorhabditis elegans. The salt-sensing neuron ASE right (ASER) is always activated by a decrease of salt concentration, while the directionality of reorientation behaviors is inverted depending on previous salt experiences. AIB, the interneuron postsynaptic to ASER, and neurons farther downstream of AIB show experience-dependent bidirectional responses, which are correlated with reorientation behaviors. These bidirectional behavioral and neural responses are mediated by glutamate released from ASER. Glutamate acts through the excitatory glutamate receptor GLR-1 and inhibitory glutamate receptor AVR-14, both acting in AIB. These findings suggest that experience-dependent reorientation behaviors are generated by altering the magnitude of excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic signals from a sensory neuron to interneurons.

Partial epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is associated with metastasis; however, a causal connection needs further unraveling. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing and genetic mouse models to identify the functional roles of partial EMT and epithelial stabilization in PDAC growth and metastasis. A global EMT expression signature identifies ∼50 cancer cell clusters spanning the epithelial-mesenchymal continuum in both human and murine PDACs. The combined genetic suppression of Snail and Twist results in PDAC epithelial stabilization and increased liver metastasis. Genetic deletion of Zeb1 in PDAC cells also leads to liver metastasis associated with cancer cell epithelial stabilization. We demonstrate that epithelial stabilization leads to the enhanced collective migration of cancer cells and modulation of the immune microenvironment, which likely contribute to efficient liver colonization. Our study provides insights into the diverse mechanisms of metastasis in pancreatic cancer and potential therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Summary
Glycosylation defects are a hallmark of many nervous system diseases. However, the molecular and metabolic basis for this pathology is not fully understood. In this study, we found that N-linked protein glycosylation in the brain is metabolically channeled to glucosamine metabolism through glycogenolysis. We discovered that glucosamine is an abundant constituent of brain glycogen, which functions as a glucosamine reservoir for multiple glycoconjugates. We demonstrated the enzymatic incorporation of glucosamine into glycogen by glycogen synthase, and the release by glycogen phosphorylase by biochemical and structural methodologies, in primary astrocytes, and in vivo by isotopic tracing and mass spectrometry. Using two mouse models of glycogen storage diseases, we showed that disruption of brain glycogen metabolism causes global decreases in free pools of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and N-linked protein glycosylation. These findings revealed fundamental biological roles of brain glycogen in protein glycosylation with direct relevance to multiple human diseases of the central nervous system.

Abstract: Summary
Four potent native human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting distinct epitopes on tetanus toxin (TeNT) are isolated with neutralization potency ranging from approximately 17 mg to 6 mg each that are equivalent to 250 IU of human anti-TeNT immunoglobulin. TT0170 binds fragment B, and TT0069 and TT0155 bind fragment AB. mAb TT0067 binds fragment C and blocks the binding of TeNT to gangliosides. The co-crystal structure of TT0067 with fragment C of TeNT at a 2.0-Å resolution demonstrates that mAb TT0067 directly occupies the W pocket of one of the receptor binding sites on TeNT, resulting in blocking the binding of TeNT to ganglioside on the surface of host cells. This study reveals at the atomic level the mechanism of action by the TeNT neutralizing antibody. The key neutralization epitope on the fragment C of TeNT identified in our work provides the critical information for the development of fragment C of TeNT as a better and safer tetanus vaccine.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy dysregulation is implicated in metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes. However, the mechanism by which the autophagy machinery regulates metabolism is largely unknown. Autophagy is generally considered a degradation process via lysosomes. Here, we unveil a metabolically important non-cell-autonomous, non-degradative mechanism regulated by the essential autophagy protein Becn1 in adipose tissue. Upon high-fat diet challenge, autophagy-hyperactive Becn1F121A mice show systemically improved insulin sensitivity and enhanced activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a central regulator of energy homeostasis, via a non-cell-autonomous mechanism mediated by adiponectin, an adipose-derived metabolic hormone. Adipose-specific Becn1F121A expression is sufficient to activate AMPK in non-adipose tissues and improve systemic insulin sensitivity by increasing adiponectin secretion. Further, Becn1 enhances adiponectin secretion by interacting with components of the exocyst complex via the coiled-coil domain. Together, our study demonstrates that Becn1 improves insulin sensitivity by facilitating adiponectin secretion through binding the exocyst in adipose tissue.

Abstract: Numerous studies highlight the potential benefits potentials of supplemental cartilage oligomeric matrix protein-angiopoietin-1 (COMP-Ang1) through improved angiogenic effects. However, our recent findings show that excessive overexpression of COMP-Ang1 induces an impaired bone marrow (BM) microenvironment and senescence of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Here, we investigated the underlying mechanisms of how excessive COMP-Ang1 affects the function of BM-conserved stem cells and hematopoiesis using K14-Cre;inducible-COMP-Ang1-transgenic mice. Excessive COMP-Ang1 induced peripheral egression and senescence of BM HSCs and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Excessive COMP-Ang1 also caused abnormal hematopoiesis along with skewed differentiation of HSCs toward myeloid lineage rather than lymphoid lineage. Especially, excessive COMP-Ang1 disturbed late-stage erythroblast maturation, followed by decreased expression of stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) and globin transcription factor 1 (GATA-1) and increased levels of superoxide anion and p-p38 kinase. However, transplantation with the mutant-derived BM cells or treatment with rhCOMP-Ang1 protein did not alter the frequency or GATA-1 expression of erythroblasts in recipient mice or in cultured BM cells. Together, our findings suggest that excessive COMP-Ang1 impairs the functions of BM HSCs and MSCs and hematopoietic processes, eventually leading to abnormal erythropoiesis via imbalanced SDF-1/CXCR4 axis and GATA-1 expression rather than Ang1/Tie2 signaling axis alterations.

Abstract: Summary
To separate causal effects of histone acetylation on chromatin accessibility and transcriptional output, we used integrated epigenomic and transcriptomic analyses following acute inhibition of major cellular lysine acetyltransferases P300 and CBP in hematological malignancies. We found that catalytic P300/CBP inhibition dynamically perturbs steady-state acetylation kinetics and suppresses oncogenic transcriptional networks in the absence of changes to chromatin accessibility. CRISPR-Cas9 screening identified NCOR1 and HDAC3 transcriptional co-repressors as the principal antagonists of P300/CBP by counteracting acetylation turnover kinetics. Finally, deacetylation of H3K27 provides nucleation sites for reciprocal methylation switching, a feature that can be exploited therapeutically by concomitant KDM6A and P300/CBP inhibition. Overall, this study indicates that the steady-state histone acetylation-methylation equilibrium functions as a molecular rheostat governing cellular transcription that is amenable to therapeutic exploitation as an anti-cancer regimen.

Abstract: Summary
Microtubules are non-covalent polymers of αβ-tubulin dimers. Posttranslational processing of the intrinsically disordered C-terminal α-tubulin tail produces detyrosinated and Δ2-tubulin. Although these are widely employed as proxies for stable cellular microtubules, their effect (and of the α-tail) on microtubule dynamics remains uncharacterized. Using recombinant, engineered human tubulins, we now find that neither detyrosinated nor Δ2-tubulin affect microtubule dynamics, while the α-tubulin tail is an inhibitor of microtubule growth. Consistent with the latter, molecular dynamics simulations show the α-tubulin tail transiently occluding the longitudinal microtubule polymerization interface. The marked differential in vivo stabilities of the modified microtubule subpopulations, therefore, must result exclusively from selective effector recruitment. We find that tyrosination quantitatively tunes CLIP-170 density at the growing plus end and that CLIP170 and EB1 synergize to selectively upregulate the dynamicity of tyrosinated microtubules. Modification-dependent recruitment of regulators thereby results in microtubule subpopulations with distinct dynamics, a tenet of the tubulin code hypothesis.

Abstract: Summary
The multi-subunit bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) and its associated regulators carry out transcription and integrate myriad regulatory signals. Numerous studies have interrogated RNAP mechanism, and RNAP mutations drive Escherichia coli adaptation to many health- and industry-relevant environments, yet a paucity of systematic analyses hampers our understanding of the fitness trade-offs from altering RNAP function. Here, we conduct a chemical-genetic analysis of a library of RNAP mutants. We discover phenotypes for non-essential insertions, show that clustering mutant phenotypes increases their predictive power for drawing functional inferences, and demonstrate that some RNA polymerase mutants both decrease average cell length and prevent killing by cell-wall targeting antibiotics. Our findings demonstrate that RNAP chemical-genetic interactions provide a general platform for interrogating structure-function relationships in vivo and for identifying physiological trade-offs of mutations, including those relevant for disease and biotechnology. This strategy should have broad utility for illuminating the role of other important protein complexes.

Abstract: Summary
Glutamate receptor-like channels (GLRs) play vital roles in various physiological processes in plants, such as wound response, stomatal aperture control, seed germination, root development, innate immune response, pollen tube growth, and morphogenesis. Despite the importance of GLRs, knowledge about their molecular organization is limited. Here we use X-ray crystallography and single-particle cryo-EM to solve structures of the Arabidopsis thaliana GLR3.4. Our structures reveal the tetrameric assembly of GLR3.4 subunits into a three-layer domain architecture, reminiscent of animal ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs). However, the non-swapped arrangement between layers of GLR3.4 domains, binding of glutathione through S-glutathionylation of cysteine C205 inside the amino-terminal domain clamshell, unique symmetry, inter-domain interfaces, and ligand specificity distinguish GLR3.4 from representatives of the iGluR family and suggest distinct features of the GLR gating mechanism. Our work elaborates on the principles of GLR architecture and symmetry and provides a molecular template for deciphering GLR-dependent signaling mechanisms in plants.

Abstract: Summary
Most mitochondrial proteins are synthesized as precursors in the cytosol and post-translationally transported into mitochondria. The mitochondrial surface protein Tom70 acts at the interface of the cytosol and mitochondria. In vitro import experiments identified Tom70 as targeting receptor, particularly for hydrophobic carriers. Using in vivo methods and high-content screens, we revisit the question of Tom70 function and considerably expand the set of Tom70-dependent mitochondrial proteins. We demonstrate that the crucial activity of Tom70 is its ability to recruit cytosolic chaperones to the outer membrane. Indeed, tethering an unrelated chaperone-binding domain onto the mitochondrial surface complements most of the defects caused by Tom70 deletion. Tom70-mediated chaperone recruitment reduces the proteotoxicity of mitochondrial precursor proteins, particularly of hydrophobic inner membrane proteins. Thus, our work suggests that the predominant function of Tom70 is to tether cytosolic chaperones to the outer mitochondrial membrane, rather than to serve as a mitochondrion-specifying targeting receptor.

Abstract: Summary
The Drosophila type II neuroblast lineages present an attractive model to investigate the neurogenesis and differentiation process as they adapt to a process similar to that in the human outer subventricular zone. We perform targeted single-cell mRNA sequencing in third instar larval brains to study this process of the type II NB lineage. Combining prior knowledge, in silico analyses, and in situ validation, our multi-informatic investigation describes the molecular landscape from a single developmental snapshot. 17 markers are identified to differentiate distinct maturation stages. 30 markers are identified to specify the stem cell origin and/or cell division numbers of INPs, and at least 12 neuronal subtypes are identified. To foster future discoveries, we provide annotated tables of pairwise gene-gene correlation in single cells and MiCV, a web tool for interactively analyzing scRNA-seq datasets. Taken together, these resources advance our understanding of the neural differentiation process at the molecular level.

Abstract: Summary
Megakaryocytes (MKs), the precursors of blood platelets, are large, polyploid cells residing mainly in the bone marrow. We have previously shown that balanced signaling of the Rho GTPases RhoA and Cdc42 is critical for correct MK localization at bone marrow sinusoids in vivo. Using conditional RhoA/Cdc42 double-knockout (DKO) mice, we reveal here that RhoA/Cdc42 signaling is dispensable for the process of polyploidization in MKs but essential for cytoplasmic MK maturation. Proplatelet formation is virtually abrogated in the absence of RhoA/Cdc42 and leads to severe macrothrombocytopenia in DKO animals. The MK maturation defect is associated with downregulation of myosin light chain 2 (MLC2) and β1-tubulin, as well as an upregulation of LIM kinase 1 and cofilin-1 at both the mRNA and protein level and can be linked to impaired MKL1/SRF signaling. Our findings demonstrate that MK endomitosis and cytoplasmic maturation are separately regulated processes, and the latter is critically controlled by RhoA/Cdc42.

Abstract: Summary
Interfaces between cells with distinct genetic identities elicit signals to organize local cell behaviors driving tissue morphogenesis. The Drosophila embryonic axis extension requires planar polarized enrichment of myosin-II powering oriented cell intercalations. Myosin-II levels are quantitatively controlled by GPCR signaling, whereas myosin-II polarity requires patterned expression of several Toll receptors. How Toll receptors polarize myosin-II and how this involves GPCRs remain unknown. Here, we report that differential expression of a single Toll receptor, Toll-8, polarizes myosin-II through binding to the adhesion GPCR Cirl/latrophilin. Asymmetric expression of Cirl is sufficient to enrich myosin-II, and Cirl localization is asymmetric at Toll-8 expression boundaries. Exploring the process dynamically, we reveal that Toll-8 and Cirl exhibit mutually dependent planar polarity in response to quantitative differences in Toll-8 expression between neighboring cells. Collectively, we propose that the cell surface protein complex Toll-8/Cirl self-organizes to generate local asymmetric interfaces essential for planar polarization of contractility.

Abstract: Summary
MYC-driven medulloblastoma is a major therapeutic challenge due to frequent metastasis and a poor 5-year survival rate. MYC gene amplification results in transcriptional dysregulation, proliferation, and survival of malignant cells. To identify therapeutic targets in MYC-amplified medulloblastoma, we employ a CRISPR-Cas9 essentiality screen targeting 1,140 genes. We identify CDK7 as a mediator of medulloblastoma tumorigenesis. Using chemical inhibitors and genetic depletion, we observe cessation of tumor growth in xenograft mouse models and increases in apoptosis. The results are attributed to repression of a core set of MYC-driven transcriptional programs mediating DNA repair. CDK7 inhibition alters RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) and MYC association at DNA repair genes. Blocking CDK7 activity sensitizes cells to ionizing radiation leading to accrual of DNA damage, extending survival and tumor latency in xenograft mouse models. Our studies establish the selective inhibition of MYC-driven medulloblastoma by CDK7 inhibition combined with radiation as a viable therapeutic strategy.

Abstract: Summary
The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants threatens efforts to contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in India has risen steeply, and a SARS-CoV-2 variant, B.1.617, is believed to be responsible for many of these cases. The spike protein of B.1.617 harbors two mutations in the receptor binding domain, which interacts with the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and constitutes the main target of neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, we analyze whether B.1.617 is more adept in entering cells and/or evades antibody responses. B.1.617 enters two of eight cell lines tested with roughly 50% increased efficiency and is equally inhibited by two entry inhibitors. In contrast, B.1.617 is resistant against bamlanivimab, an antibody used for COVID-19 treatment. B.1.617 evades antibodies induced by infection or vaccination, although less so than the B.1.351 variant. Collectively, our study reveals that antibody evasion of B.1.617 may contribute to the rapid spread of this variant.

Abstract: Summary
Posttranslational modification (PTM), through the recruitment of effector proteins (i.e., “readers”) that signal downstream events, plays key roles in regulating a variety of cellular processes. To understand how a PTM is recognized, it is necessary to find its readers and, importantly, the location of the binding pockets responsible for PTM recognition. Although various methods have been developed to identify PTM readers, it remains a challenge to directly map the PTM-binding regions, especially for intrinsically disordered domains. Here, we demonstrate a photo-crosslinkable, clickable, and cleavable tri-functional amino acid, ADdis-Cys, that when coupled with mass spectrometry (ADdis-Cys-MS) can not only identify PTM readers from complex proteomes but also simultaneously map their PTM-recognition modules. Using ADdis-Cys-MS, we successfully identify the binding sites of several reader-PTM interactions, among which we discover human C1QBP as a histone chaperone. This robust method should find wide applications in examining other histone or non-histone PTM-mediated protein-protein interactions.

Abstract: Summary
The multisubunit chromatin remodeler SWR1/SRCAP/p400 replaces the nucleosomal H2A-H2B dimer with the free-form H2A.Z-H2B dimer, but the mechanism governing the unidirectional H2A-to-H2A.Z exchange remains elusive. Here, we perform single-molecule force spectroscopy to dissect the disassembly/reassembly processes of the H2A nucleosome and H2A.Z nucleosome. We find that the N-terminal 1–135 residues of yeast SWR1 complex protein 2 (previously termed Swc2-Z) facilitate the disassembly of nucleosomes containing H2A but not H2A.Z. The Swc2-mediated nucleosome disassembly/reassembly requires the inherently unstable H2A nucleosome, whose instability is conferred by three H2A α2-helical residues, Gly47, Pro49, and Ile63, as they selectively weaken the structural rigidity of the H2A-H2B dimer. It also requires Swc2-ZN (residues 1–37) that directly anchors to the H2A nucleosome and functions in the SWR1-catalyzed H2A.Z replacement in vitro and yeast H2A.Z deposition in vivo. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into how the SWR1 complex discriminates between the H2A nucleosome and H2A.Z nucleosome, establishing a simple paradigm for the governance of unidirectional H2A.Z exchange.

Abstract: Summary
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) variants govern transmissibility, responsiveness to vaccination, and disease severity. In a screen for new models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we identify human H522 lung adenocarcinoma cells as naturally permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection despite complete absence of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression. Remarkably, H522 infection requires the E484D S variant; viruses expressing wild-type S are not infectious. Anti-S monoclonal antibodies differentially neutralize SARS-CoV-2 E484D S in H522 cells as compared to ACE2-expressing cells. Sera from vaccinated individuals block this alternative entry mechanism, whereas convalescent sera are less effective. Although the H522 receptor remains unknown, depletion of surface heparan sulfates block H522 infection. Temporally resolved transcriptomic and proteomic profiling reveal alterations in cell cycle and the antiviral host cell response, including MDA5-dependent activation of type I interferon signaling. These findings establish an alternative SARS-CoV-2 host cell receptor for the E484D SARS-CoV-2 variant, which may impact tropism of SARS-CoV-2 and consequently human disease pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Limb regeneration, while observed lifelong in salamanders, is restricted in post-metamorphic Xenopus laevis frogs. Whether this loss is due to systemic factors or an intrinsic incapability of cells to form competent stem cells has been unclear. Here, we use genetic fate mapping to establish that connective tissue (CT) cells form the post-metamorphic frog blastema, as in the case of axolotls. Using heterochronic transplantation into the limb bud and single-cell transcriptomic profiling, we show that axolotl CT cells dedifferentiate and integrate to form lineages, including cartilage. In contrast, frog blastema CT cells do not fully re-express the limb bud progenitor program, even when transplanted into the limb bud. Correspondingly, transplanted cells contribute to extraskeletal CT, but not to the developing cartilage. Furthermore, using single-cell RNA-seq analysis we find that embryonic and adult frog cartilage differentiation programs are molecularly distinct. This work defines intrinsic restrictions in CT dedifferentiation as a limitation in adult regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 7 (PIF7) is a central regulator that promotes stem growth by activating growth-related gene expression during shade-avoidance responses. Studying the co-factors of PIF7 can facilitate understanding of the mechanism of PIFs and light signal transduction. Here, we describe the identification of two bHLH transcription factors, bHLH48 and bHLH60 (bHLH48/bHLH60), as essential partners for PIF7-dependent modulation of hypocotyl elongation and function downstream of phytochrome B. These two bHLH factors display DNA binding activity and interact with PIF7. Genetic analysis indicated that bHLH48/bHLH60 and PIF7 are interdependent in promoting hypocotyl elongation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis identified the substantially overlapping downstream targets of bHLH60 and PIF7. Biochemical analysis revealed that bHLH48/bHLH60 enhance the DNA binding ability of PIF7. These results provide evidence that bHLH48/bHLH60 act as positive partners of PIF7 for mutual benefit in the regulation of hypocotyl elongation.

Abstract: Summary
Preclinical models of ischemia/reperfusion injury (RI) demonstrate the deleterious effects of permeability transition pore complex (PTPC) opening in the first minutes upon revascularization of the occluded vessel. The ATP synthase c subunit (Csub) influences PTPC activity in cells, thus impacting tissue injury. A conserved glycine-rich domain in Csub is classified as critical because, when mutated, it modifies ATP synthase properties, protein interaction with the mitochondrial calcium (Ca2+) uniporter complex, and the conductance of the PTPC. Here, we document the role of a naturally occurring mutation in the Csub-encoding ATP5G1 gene at the G87 position found in two ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients and how PTPC opening is related to RI in patients affected by the same disease. We report a link between the expression of ATP5G1G87E and the response to hypoxia/reoxygenation of human cardiomyocytes, which worsen when compared to those expressing the wild-type protein, and a positive correlation between PTPC and RI.

Abstract: Summary
One goal of precision medicine is to tailor effective treatments to patients’ specific molecular markers of disease. Here, we used mass cytometry to characterize the single-cell signaling landscapes of 62 breast cancer cell lines and five lines from healthy tissue. We quantified 34 markers in each cell line upon stimulation by the growth factor EGF in the presence or absence of five kinase inhibitors. These data—on more than 80 million single cells from 4,000 conditions—were used to fit mechanistic signaling network models that provide insight into how cancer cells process information. Our dynamic single-cell-based models accurately predicted drug sensitivity and identified genomic features associated with drug sensitivity, including a missense mutation in DDIT3 predictive of PI3K-inhibition sensitivity. We observed similar trends in genotype-drug sensitivity associations in patient-derived xenograft mouse models. This work provides proof of principle that patient-specific single-cell measurements and modeling could inform effective precision medicine strategies.

Abstract: Summary
The mammalian cochlea cannot regenerate functional hair cells (HCs) spontaneously. Atoh1 overexpression as well as other strategies are unable to generate functional HCs. Here, we simultaneously upregulated the expression of Gfi1, Pou4f3, and Atoh1 in postnatal cochlear supporting cells (SCs) in vivo, which efficiently converted SCs into HCs. The newly regenerated HCs expressed HC markers Myo7a, Calbindin, Parvalbumin, and Ctbp2 and were innervated by neurites. Importantly, many new HCs expressed the mature and terminal marker Prestin or vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (vGlut3), depending on the subtypes of the source SCs. Finally, our patch-clamp analysis showed that the new HCs in the medial region acquired a large K+ current, fired spikes transiently, and exhibited signature refinement of ribbon synapse functions, in close resemblance to native wild-type inner HCs. We demonstrated that co-upregulating Gfi1, Pou4f3, and Atoh1 enhances the efficiency of HC generation and promotes the functional maturation of new HCs.

Abstract: Summary
Relatively little is known about features of T cells targeted by HIV in vivo. By applying bioinformatics analysis to mass cytometry (CyTOF)-phenotyped specimens from individuals with viremia and in-vitro-infected cells from uninfected donors, we provide an atlas of the phenotypes of in vivo and in vitro HIV-susceptible cells. T helper 17 (Th17) and α4β1+ cells are preferentially targeted in vivo, whereas T effector memory (Tem), T transitional memory (Ttm), Th1, and Th1/Th17 subsets are targeted in vitro. Multiple proteins—including chemokine and cytokine receptors—are remodeled by HIV in vivo, and these changes are mostly recapitulated in vitro. HIV remodels cells to a T follicular helper (Tfh) phenotype. Using clustering, we uncover a subset of CD29-expressing, Tem-like cells that are highly susceptible to infection in vivo and in vitro and experimentally confirm that susceptibility. These studies provide an in-depth look at features of HIV-susceptible cells in individuals with viremia and demonstrate that some—but not all—HIV-susceptible cells identified in vitro effectively model in vivo susceptibility.

Abstract: Summary
In the early fetal stage, the gonads are bipotent and only later become the ovary or testis, depending on the genetic sex. Despite many studies examining how sex determination occurs from biopotential gonads, the spatial and temporal organization of bipotential gonads and their progenitors is poorly understood. Here, using lineage tracing in mice, we find that the gonads originate from a T+ primitive streak through WT1+ posterior intermediate mesoderm and appear to share origins anteriorly with the adrenal glands and posteriorly with the metanephric mesenchyme. Comparative single-cell transcriptomic analyses in mouse and cynomolgus monkey embryos reveal the convergence of the lineage trajectory and genetic programs accompanying the specification of biopotential gonadal progenitor cells. This process involves sustained expression of epithelial genes and upregulation of mesenchymal genes, thereby conferring an epithelial-mesenchymal hybrid state. Our study provides key resources for understanding early gonadogenesis in mice and primates.

Abstract: Summary
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) interact with intracellular transducers to control both signal initiation and desensitization, but the distinct mechanisms that control the regulation of different GPCR subtypes are unclear. Here we use fluorescence imaging and electrophysiology to examine the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) family. We find distinct properties across subtypes in both rapid desensitization and internalization, with striking differences between the group II mGluRs. mGluR3, but not mGluR2, undergoes glutamate-dependent rapid desensitization, internalization, trafficking, and recycling. We map differences between mGluRs to variable Ser/Thr-rich sequences in the C-terminal domain (CTD) that control interaction with both GPCR kinases and β-arrestins. Finally, we identify a cancer-associated mutation, G848E, within the mGluR3 CTD that enhances β-arrestin coupling and internalization, enabling an analysis of mGluR3 β-arrestin-coupling properties and revealing biased variants. Together, this work provides a framework for understanding the distinct regulation and functional roles of mGluR subtypes.

Abstract: Summary
A number of regulatory factors are recruited to chromatin by specialized RNAs. Whether RNA has a more general role in regulating the interaction of proteins with chromatin has not been determined. We used proteomics methods to measure the global impact of nascent RNA on chromatin in embryonic stem cells. Surprisingly, we found that nascent RNA primarily antagonized the interaction of chromatin modifiers and transcriptional regulators with chromatin. Transcriptional inhibition and RNA degradation induced recruitment of a set of transcriptional regulators, chromatin modifiers, nucleosome remodelers, and regulators of higher-order structure. RNA directly bound to factors, including BAF, NuRD, EHMT1, and INO80 and inhibited their interaction with nucleosomes. The transcriptional elongation factor P-TEFb directly bound pre-mRNA, and its recruitment to chromatin upon Pol II inhibition was regulated by the 7SK ribonucleoprotein complex. We postulate that by antagonizing the interaction of regulatory proteins with chromatin, nascent RNA links transcriptional output with chromatin composition.

Abstract: Summary
The complement fragment C5a is closely associated with adaptive immune induction in the mucosa. However, the mechanisms that control CD8+ T cell responses by C5a have not been extensively explored. This study reveals that C5/C5a in the Peyer’s patch (PP) subepithelial dome increases upon oral Listeria infection. We hypothesize that C5aR+ PP cells play an important role in the induction of antigen-specific T cell immunity. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identify C5aR- and lysozyme-expressing dendritic cells (C5aR+ LysoDCs) in PP and examine their role in CD8+ T cell immune induction. Stimulation of C5aR+ LysoDCs by C5a increases reactive oxygen species levels, leading to efficient antigen cross-presentation, which elicits an antigen-specific CD8+ T cell response. In C5-deficient mice, oral co-administration of C5a and Listeria enhances Listeria-specific cytotoxic T cell levels. Collectively, these findings suggest a role of the complement system in intestinal T cell immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Dosage compensation in Drosophila melanogaster involves a 2-fold transcriptional upregulation of the male X chromosome, which relies on the X-chromosome-binding males-specific lethal (MSL) complex. However, how such 2-fold precision is accomplished remains unclear. Here, we show that a nuclear pore component, Mtor, is involved in setting the correct levels of transcription from the male X chromosome. Using larval tissues, we demonstrate that the depletion of Mtor results in selective upregulation at MSL targets of the male X, beyond the required 2-fold. Mtor and MSL components interact genetically, and depletion of Mtor can rescue the male lethality phenotype of MSL components. Using RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis and nascent transcript sequencing, we find that the effect of Mtor is not due to defects in mRNA export but occurs at the level of nascent transcription. These findings demonstrate a physiological role for Mtor in the process of dosage compensation, as a transcriptional attenuator of X chromosome gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
An evolving family of mobile colistin resistance (MCR) enzymes is threatening public health. However, the molecular mechanism by which the MCR enzyme as a rare member of lipid A-phosphoethanolamine (PEA) transferases gains the ability to confer phenotypic colistin resistance remains enigmatic. Here, we report an unusual example that genetic duplication and amplification produce a functional variant (Ah762) of MCR-3 in certain Aeromonas species. The lipid A-binding cavity of Ah762 is functionally defined. Intriguingly, we locate a hinge linker of Ah762 (termed Linker 59) that determines the MCR. Genetic and biochemical characterization reveals that Linker 59 behaves as a facilitator to render inactive MCR variants to regain the ability of colistin resistance. Along with molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) suggests that this facilitator guarantees the formation of substrate phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)-accessible pocket within MCR-3-like enzymes. Therefore, our finding defines an MCR-3 inside facilitator for colistin resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Rats have been used as animal models for human diseases for more than a century, yet a systematic understanding of basal biobehavioral phenotypes of laboratory rats is still missing. In this study, we utilize wireless tracking technology and videography, collect and analyze more than 130 billion data points to fill this gap, and characterize the evolution of behavior and physiology of group-housed male and female rats (n = 114) of the most commonly used strains (Lister Hooded, Long-Evans, Sprague-Dawley, and Wistar) throughout their development. The resulting intensive longitudinal data suggest the existence of strain and sex differences and bi-stable developmental states. Under standard laboratory 12-h light/12-h dark conditions, our study found the presence of multiple oscillations such as circatidal-like rhythms in locomotor activity. The overall findings further suggest that frequent movement along cage walls or thigmotaxic activity may be a physical feature of motion in constrained spaces, critically affecting the interpretation of basal behavior of rats in cages.

Abstract: Summary
Cholesterol metabolism is tightly associated with colorectal cancer (CRC). Nevertheless, the clinical benefit of statins, the inhibitor of cholesterol biogenesis mevalonate (MVA) pathway, is inconclusive, possibly because of a lack of patient stratification criteria. Here, we describe that YAP-mediated zinc finger MYND-type containing 8 (ZMYND8) expression sensitizes intestinal tumors to the inhibition of the MVA pathway. We show that the oncogenic activity of YAP relies largely on ZMYND8 to enhance intracellular de novo cholesterol biogenesis. Disruption of the ZMYND8-dependent MVA pathway greatly restricts the self-renewal capacity of Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and intestinal tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, ZMYND8 and SREBP2 drive the enhancer-promoter interaction to facilitate the recruitment of Mediator complex, thus upregulating MVA pathway genes. Together, our results establish that the epigenetic reader ZMYND8 endows YAP-high intestinal cancer with metabolic vulnerability.

Abstract: Summary
The prion-like spread of tau pathology could underlie a spectrum of clinical syndromes including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Although evidence indicates that tau is transmissible, it is unclear how pathogenic tau seeds are processed in neurons. Here, we analyze fibrillar wild-type and disease-associated P301L tau seeds by using in vitro and neuronal assays. We show that P301L seeds are uniquely modified by post-translational modifications (PTMs) within the microtubule-binding region (MTBR). Although these modifications do not alter tau seed trafficking or localization, acetylated tau variants show accelerated tau aggregation, enhanced tau PTM priming, and prion-like templating. To explain the enhanced tau seed acetylation, we demonstrate that P301L seeds undergo auto-acetylation. Moreover, tau acts generally to inhibit HDAC6 deacetylase activity by preventing HDAC6 phosphorylation, leading to increased substrate acetylation. Our study highlights complex post-translational regulation of transmissible tau seeds and provides insight into the biological properties of tau strains in AD and other tauopathies.

Previous work has shown that the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) is an important region that is involved in the conditioned context-induced retrieval of morphine withdrawal memory. However, the upstream neural circuits that activate the PVT to participate in the conditioned context-induced retrieval of morphine withdrawal memory remain unknown. In the present work, we find that the conditioned context activates projection neurons from the prelimbic cortex (PrL) to the PVT, and the inhibition of PrL-PVT projection neurons inhibits the conditioned context-induced retrieval of morphine withdrawal memory; the conditioned context induces an increase in Arc expression, intrinsic excitability, and glutamate output in PrL-PVT projection neurons in morphine-withdrawn mice. These results suggest that the activity of PrL-PVT projection neurons is necessary for the retrieval of morphine withdrawal memory, and the conditioned context causes a plastic change in the activity in these projection neurons during the withdrawal memory retrieval.

Abstract: Summary
SARS-CoV-2 is one of three coronaviruses that have crossed the animal-to-human barrier and caused widespread disease in the past two decades. The development of a universal human coronavirus vaccine could prevent future pandemics. We characterize 198 antibodies isolated from four COVID-19+ subjects and identify 14 SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. One targets the N-terminal domain (NTD), one recognizes an epitope in S2, and 11 bind the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Three anti-RBD neutralizing antibodies cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-1 by effectively blocking binding of both the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs to the ACE2 receptor. Using the K18-hACE transgenic mouse model, we demonstrate that the neutralization potency and antibody epitope specificity regulates the in vivo protective potential of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. All four cross-neutralizing antibodies neutralize the B.1.351 mutant strain. Thus, our study reveals that epitopes in S2 can serve as blueprints for the design of immunogens capable of eliciting cross-neutralizing coronavirus antibodies.

Abstract: Interleukin-8 (IL-8, CXCL8), a pro-inﬂammatory chemokine secreted by a variety of cell types, plays a critical role in the development of various immune diseases. Interactions between IL-8 and its receptor CXC receptor 1/2 (CXCR1/2) are known to promote chemotaxis and phagocytosis in many immune responses. In this study, we report the molecular characteristics and pharmacological activity of CXCR1 (MsCXCR1) in largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) and evaluated the functional involvement of MsCXCR1 in individuals infected with the pathogen Nocardia seriolae. MsCXCR1 was cloned into the pEGFP-N1 plasmid and the subcellular localization of MsCXCR1 on the cell membrane was verified in MsCXCR1-EGFP-expressing HEK293 cells. Following observation of receptor internalization and intracellular signaling detection, we further determined the functional interaction of secreted interleukin-8 (LcIL-8, the ligand for CXCR1 in large yellow croaker) and MsCXCR1 was further determined, and the ERK phosphorylation signal activation mediated by MsCXCR1 was demonstrated. Quantitative real-time PCR assays were conducted to analyze the transcriptional distribution of MsCXCR1 in various tissues of healthy and diseased largemouth bass. These results illustrate the significant elevation of MsCXCR1 expression in the head kidney, spleen and liver of M. salmoides, suggesting that MsCXCR1 was involved in the immune response in N. seriolae-infected largemouth bass and potentially affects the digestive function of this species.

Abstract: Summary
Distinct T cell infiltration patterns, i.e., immune infiltrated, excluded, and desert, result in different responses to cancer immunotherapies. However, the key determinants and biology underpinning these tumor immune phenotypes remain elusive. Here, we provide a high-resolution dissection of the entire tumor ecosystem through single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of 15 ovarian tumors. Immune-desert tumors are characterized by unique tumor cell-intrinsic features, including metabolic pathways and low antigen presentation, and an enrichment of monocytes and immature macrophages. Immune-infiltrated and -excluded tumors differ markedly in their T cell composition and fibroblast subsets. Furthermore, our study reveals chemokine receptor-ligand interactions within and across compartments as potential mechanisms mediating immune cell infiltration, exemplified by the tumor cell-T cell cross talk via CXCL16-CXCR6 and stromal-immune cell cross talk via CXCL12/14-CXCR4. Our data highlight potential molecular mechanisms that shape the tumor immune phenotypes and may inform therapeutic strategies to improve clinical benefit from cancer immunotherapies.

Abstract: Summary
Selective protein degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is involved in all cellular processes. However, the substrates and specificity of most UPS components are not well understood. Here we systematically characterized the UPS in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using fluorescent timers, we determined how loss of individual UPS components affects yeast proteome turnover, detecting phenotypes for 76% of E2, E3, and deubiquitinating enzymes. We exploit this dataset to gain insights into N-degron pathways, which target proteins carrying N-terminal degradation signals. We implicate Ubr1, an E3 of the Arg/N-degron pathway, in targeting mitochondrial proteins processed by the mitochondrial inner membrane protease. Moreover, we identify Ylr149c/Gid11 as a substrate receptor of the glucose-induced degradation-deficient (GID) complex, an E3 of the Pro/N-degron pathway. Our results suggest that Gid11 recognizes proteins with N-terminal threonines, expanding the specificity of the GID complex. This resource of potential substrates and relationships between UPS components enables exploring functions of selective protein degradation.

Abstract: Summary
The deleterious effects of psychological stress on mainstream T lymphocytes are well documented. However, how stress impacts innate-like T cells is unclear. We report that long-term stress surprisingly abrogates both T helper 1 (TH1)- and TH2-type responses orchestrated by invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells. This is not due to iNKT cell death because these cells are unusually refractory to stress-inflicted apoptosis. Activated iNKT cells in stressed mice exhibit a “split” inflammatory signature and trigger sudden serum interleukin-10 (IL-10), IL-23, and IL-27 spikes. iNKT cell dysregulation is mediated by cell-autonomous glucocorticoid receptor signaling and corrected upon habituation to predictable stressors. Importantly, under stress, iNKT cells fail to potentiate cytotoxicity against lymphoma or to reduce the burden of metastatic melanoma. Finally, stress physically spares mouse mucosa-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells but hinders their TH1-/TH2-type responses. The above findings are corroborated in human peripheral blood and hepatic iNKT/MAIT cell cultures. Our work uncovers a mechanism of stress-induced immunosuppression.

Abstract: Summary
OTULIN coordinates with LUBAC to edit linear polyubiquitin chains in embryonic development, autoimmunity, and inflammatory diseases. However, the mechanism by which angiogenesis, especially that of endothelial cells (ECs), is regulated by linear ubiquitination remains unclear. Here, we reveal that constitutive or EC-specific deletion of Otulin resulted in arteriovenous malformations and embryonic lethality. LUBAC conjugates linear ubiquitin chains onto Activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1), which is responsible for angiogenesis defects, inhibiting ALK1 enzyme activity and Smad1/5 activation. Conversely, OTULIN deubiquitinates ALK1 to promote Smad1/5 activation. Consistently, embryonic survival of Otulin-deficient mice was prolonged by BMP9 pretreatment or EC-specific ALK1Q200D (constitutively active) knockin. Moreover, mutant ALK1 from type 2 hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT2) patients exhibited excessive linear ubiquitination and increased HOIP binding. As such, a HOIP inhibitor restricted the excessive angiogenesis of ECs derived from ALK1G309S-expressing HHT2 patients. These results show that OTULIN and LUBAC govern ALK1 activity to balance EC angiogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
CD8 T cells play an essential role in defense against viral and bacterial infections and in tumor immunity. Deciphering T cell loss of functionality is complicated by the conspicuous heterogeneity of CD8 T cell states described across experimental and clinical settings. By carrying out a unified analysis of over 300 assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) experiments from 12 studies of CD8 T cells in cancer and infection, we defined a shared differentiation trajectory toward dysfunction and its underlying transcriptional drivers and revealed a universal early bifurcation of functional and dysfunctional T cell states across models. Experimental dissection of acute and chronic viral infection using single-cell ATAC (scATAC)-seq and allele-specific single-cell RNA (scRNA)-seq identified state-specific drivers and captured the emergence of similar TCF1+ progenitor-like populations at an early branch point, at which functional and dysfunctional T cells diverge. Our atlas of CD8 T cell states will facilitate mechanistic studies of T cell immunity and translational efforts.

Abstract: Summary
How cells adopt a different morphology to cope with stress is not well understood. Here, we show that budding yeast Ecm25 associates with polarized endocytic sites and interacts with the polarity regulator Cdc42 and several late-stage endocytic proteins via distinct regions, including an actin filament-binding motif. Deletion of ECM25 does not affect Cdc42 activity or cause any strong defects in fluid-phase and clathrin-mediated endocytosis but completely abolishes hydroxyurea-induced cell elongation. This phenotype is accompanied by depolarization of the spatiotemporally coupled exo-endocytosis in the bud cortex while maintaining the overall mother-bud polarity. These data suggest that Ecm25 provides an essential link between the polarization signal and the endocytic machinery to enable adaptive morphogenesis under stress conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Small cell neuroendocrine cancers (SCNCs) are recalcitrant cancers arising from diverse primary sites that lack effective treatments. Using chemical genetic screens, we identified inhibition of ataxia telangiectasia and rad3 related (ATR), the primary activator of the replication stress response, and topoisomerase I (TOP1), nuclear enzyme that suppresses genomic instability, as synergistically cytotoxic in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). In a proof-of-concept study, we combined M6620 (berzosertib), first-in-class ATR inhibitor, and TOP1 inhibitor topotecan in patients with relapsed SCNCs. Objective response rate among patients with SCLC was 36% (9/25), achieving the primary efficacy endpoint. Durable tumor regressions were observed in patients with platinum-resistant SCNCs, typically fatal within weeks of recurrence. SCNCs with high neuroendocrine differentiation, characterized by enhanced replication stress, were more likely to respond. These findings highlight replication stress as a potentially transformative vulnerability of SCNCs, paving the way for rational patient selection in these cancers, now treated as a single disease.

Abstract: Summary
Several neurodegenerative diseases present Tau accumulation as the main pathological marker. Tau post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation are increased in neurodegeneration. Here, we show that Tau hyper-acetylation at residue 174 increases its own nuclear presence and is the result of DNA damage signaling or the lack of SIRT6, both causative of neurodegeneration. Tau-K174ac is deacetylated in the nucleus by SIRT6. However, lack of SIRT6 or chronic DNA damage results in nuclear Tau-K174ac accumulation. Once there, it induces global changes in gene expression, affecting protein translation, synthesis, and energy production. Concomitantly, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) case subjects show increased nucleolin and a decrease in SIRT6 levels. AD case subjects present increased levels of nuclear Tau, particularly Tau-K174ac. Our results suggest that increased Tau-K174ac in AD case subjects is the result of DNA damage signaling and SIRT6 depletion. We propose that Tau-K174ac toxicity is due to its increased stability, nuclear accumulation, and nucleolar dysfunction.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles subjected to fission and fusion events. During mitosis, mitochondrial fission ensures equal distribution of mitochondria to daughter cells. If and how this process can actively drive mitotic progression remains largely unknown. Here, we discover a pathway linking mitochondrial fission to mitotic progression in mammalian cells. The mitochondrial fission factor (MFF), the main mitochondrial receptor for the Dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), is directly phosphorylated by Protein Kinase D (PKD) specifically during mitosis. PKD-dependent MFF phosphorylation is required and sufficient for mitochondrial fission in mitotic but not in interphasic cells. Phosphorylation of MFF is crucial for chromosome segregation and promotes cell survival by inhibiting adaptation of the mitotic checkpoint. Thus, PKD/MFF-dependent mitochondrial fission is critical for the maintenance of genome integrity during cell division.

Abstract: Summary
Human cardiac regeneration is limited by low cardiomyocyte replicative rates and progressive polyploidization by unclear mechanisms. To study this process, we engineer a human cardiomyocyte model to track replication and polyploidization using fluorescently tagged cyclin B1 and cardiac troponin T. Using time-lapse imaging, in vitro cardiomyocyte replication patterns recapitulate the progressive mononuclear polyploidization and replicative arrest observed in vivo. Single-cell transcriptomics and chromatin state analyses reveal that polyploidization is preceded by sarcomere assembly, enhanced oxidative metabolism, a DNA damage response, and p53 activation. CRISPR knockout screening reveals p53 as a driver of cell-cycle arrest and polyploidization. Inhibiting sarcomere function, or scavenging ROS, inhibits cell-cycle arrest and polyploidization. Finally, we show that cardiomyocyte engraftment in infarcted rat hearts is enhanced 4-fold by the increased proliferation of troponin-knockout cardiomyocytes. Thus, the sarcomere inhibits cell division through a DNA damage response that can be targeted to improve cardiomyocyte replacement strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Plants respond to bacterial infection acutely with actin remodeling during plant immune responses. The mechanisms by which bacterial virulence factors (VFs) modulate plant actin polymerization remain enigmatic. Here, we show that plant-type-I formin serves as the molecular sensor for actin remodeling in response to two bacterial VFs: Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) diffusible signal factor (DSF), and pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) flagellin in pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). Both VFs regulate actin assembly by tuning the clustering and nucleation activity of formin on the plasma membrane (PM) at the nano-sized scale. By being integrated within the cell-wall-PM-actin cytoskeleton (CW-PM-AC) continuum, the dynamic behavior and function of formins are highly dependent on each scaffold layer’s composition within the CW-PM-AC continuum during both DSF and PTI signaling. Our results reveal a central mechanism for rapid actin remodeling during plant-bacteria interactions, in which bacterial signaling molecules fine tune plant formin nanoclustering in a host mechanical-structure-dependent manner.

Abstract: Bromodomain 4 (BRD4), an important epigenetic regulator, is involved in many bone-related pathologies via promoting osteoclast formation. However, whether and how it participates in the process of osteoblast formation remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the potential role of BRD4 in osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). Our experiments revealed that an inhibitor of BRD4, JQ1, attenuated osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. The recombinant adenoviruses for AdBRD4 and AdsiBRD4 could infect BMSCs with high efficiency. Exogenous BRD4 expression potentiated differentiation, and silencing endogenous BRD4 expression decreased it. In addition, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is known to be important for osteogenic differentiation. Our results showed that AdBRD4 increased the expressions of Wnt3a and β-catenin while AdsiBRD4 decreased the expressions. What’s more, the recombinant adenovirus for Adsiβ-catenin, which obviously decreased in β-catenin expression, inhibited BRD4-induced osteogenic differentiation. Conclusion: Our data indicates that the epigenetic reader BRD4 participates in the process of BMSC osteogenic differentiation via the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This finding may pave the way into further understanding the mechanism of BMSC osteogenic differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
The Ebola virus matrix protein VP40 forms distinct structures linked to distinct functions in the virus life cycle. Dimeric VP40 is a structural protein associated with virus assembly, while octameric, ring-shaped VP40 is associated with transcriptional control. In this study, we show that suitable nucleic acid is sufficient to trigger a dynamic transformation of VP40 dimer into the octameric ring. Deep sequencing reveals a binding preference of the VP40 ring for the 3′ untranslated region of cellular mRNA and a guanine- and adenine-rich binding motif. Complementary analyses of the nucleic-acid-induced VP40 ring by native mass spectrometry, electron microscopy, and X-ray crystal structures at 1.8 and 1.4 Å resolution reveal the stoichiometry of RNA binding, as well as an interface involving a key guanine nucleotide. The host factor-induced structural transformation of protein structure in response to specific RNA triggers in the Ebola virus life cycle presents unique opportunities for therapeutic inhibition.

Abstract: Summary
The hepatitis B virus (HBV) infects 257 million people worldwide. HBV infection requires establishment and persistence of covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA, a viral episome, in nucleus. Here, we study cccDNA spatial localization in the 3D host genome by using chromosome conformation capture-based sequencing analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). We show that transcriptionally inactive cccDNA is not randomly distributed in host nucleus. Rather, it is preferentially accumulated at specialized areas, including regions close to chromosome 19 (chr.19). Activation of the cccDNA is apparently associated with its re-localization, from a pre-established heterochromatin hub formed by 5 regions of chr.19 to transcriptionally active regions formed by chr.19 and nearby chromosomes including chr.16, 17, 20, and 22. This active versus inactive positioning at discrete regions of the host genome is primarily controlled by the viral HBx protein and by host factors including the structural maintenance of chromosomes protein 5/6 (SMC5/6) complex.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria control eukaryotic cell fate by producing the energy needed to support life and the signals required to execute programed cell death. The biochemical milieu is known to affect mitochondrial function and contribute to the dysfunctional mitochondrial phenotypes implicated in cancer and the morbidities of aging. However, the physical characteristics of the extracellular matrix are also altered in cancerous and aging tissues. Here, we demonstrate that cells sense the physical properties of the extracellular matrix and activate a mitochondrial stress response that adaptively tunes mitochondrial function via solute carrier family 9 member A1-dependent ion exchange and heat shock factor 1-dependent transcription. Overall, our data indicate that adhesion-mediated mechanosignaling may play an unappreciated role in the altered mitochondrial functions observed in aging and cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Endothelial cells display heterogeneous properties based on location and function. How this heterogeneity influences endothelial barrier stability both between and within vessel subtypes is unexplored. In this study, we find that endothelial cells exhibit heterogeneous barrier properties on inter-organ and intra-vessel levels. Using intravital microscopy and sequential stimulation of the ear dermis with vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGFA) and/or histamine, we observe distinct, reappearing sites, common for both agonists, where leakage preferentially takes place. Through repetitive stimulation of the diaphragm and trachea, we find inter-organ conservation of such predetermined leakage sites. Qualitatively, predetermined sites display distinct leakage properties and enhanced barrier breakdown compared to less susceptible regions. Mechanistically, laminin α5 is reduced at predetermined sites, which is linked to reduced junctional vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin and enhanced VEGFA-induced VE-cadherin phosphorylation. These data highlight functional intra-vessel heterogeneity that defines predetermined sites with distinct leakage properties and that may disproportionately impact pathological vascular leakage.

Abstract: Summary
Age-related macular degeneration and other macular diseases result in the loss of light-sensing cone photoreceptors, causing irreversible sight impairment. Photoreceptor replacement may restore vision by transplanting healthy cells, which must form new synaptic connections with the recipient retina. Despite recent advances, convincing evidence of functional connectivity arising from transplanted human cone photoreceptors in advanced retinal degeneration is lacking. Here, we show restoration of visual function after transplantation of purified human pluripotent stem cell-derived cones into a mouse model of advanced degeneration. Transplanted human cones elaborate nascent outer segments and make putative synapses with recipient murine bipolar cells (BCs), which themselves undergo significant remodeling. Electrophysiological and behavioral assessments demonstrate restoration of surprisingly complex light-evoked retinal ganglion cell responses and improved light-evoked behaviors in treated animals. Stringent controls exclude alternative explanations, including material transfer and neuroprotection. These data provide crucial validation for photoreceptor replacement therapy and for the potential to rescue cone-mediated vision.

Abstract: Summary
Dendritic spines constitute the major compartments of excitatory post-synapses. They undergo activity-dependent enlargement, which is thought to increase the synaptic efficacy underlying learning and memory. The activity-dependent spine enlargement requires activation of signaling pathways leading to promotion of actin polymerization within the spines. However, the molecular machinery that suffices for that structural plasticity remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that shootin1a links polymerizing actin filaments in spines with the cell-adhesion molecules N-cadherin and L1-CAM, thereby mechanically coupling the filaments to the extracellular environment. Synaptic activation enhances shootin1a-mediated actin-adhesion coupling in spines. Promotion of actin polymerization is insufficient for the plasticity; the enhanced actin-adhesion coupling is required for polymerizing actin filaments to push against the membrane for spine enlargement. By integrating cell signaling, cell adhesion, and force generation into the current model of actin-based machinery, we propose molecular machinery that is sufficient to trigger the activity-dependent spine structural plasticity.

Abstract: Summary
Synchronization has been implicated in neuronal communication, but causal evidence remains indirect. We use optogenetics to generate depolarizing currents in pyramidal neurons of the cat visual cortex, emulating excitatory synaptic inputs under precise temporal control, while measuring spike output. The cortex transforms constant excitation into strong gamma-band synchronization, revealing the well-known cortical resonance. Increasing excitation with ramps increases the strength and frequency of synchronization. Slow, symmetric excitation profiles reveal hysteresis of power and frequency. White-noise input sequences enable causal analysis of network transmission, establishing that the cortical gamma-band resonance preferentially transmits coherent input components. Models composed of recurrently coupled excitatory and inhibitory units uncover a crucial role of feedback inhibition and suggest that hysteresis can arise through spike-frequency adaptation. The presented approach provides a powerful means to investigate the resonance properties of local circuits and probe how these properties transform input and shape transmission.

Abstract: Sporotrichosis is a fungal disease caused by the members of the Sporothrix pathogenic clade, and one of the etiological agents is Sporothrix schenckii. The cell wall of this organism has been previously analyzed and thus far is known to contain an inner layer composed of chitin and β -glucans, and an outer layer of glycoproteins, which are decorated with mannose and rhamnose-containing oligosaccharides. The L-rhamnose biosynthesis pathway is common in bacteria but rare in members of the Fungi kingdom. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to disrupt this metabolic route to assess the contribution of rhamnose during the S.schenckii-host interaction. We identified and silenced in S. schenckii a functional ortholog of the bacterial rmlD gene, which encodes for an essential reductase for the synthesis of nucleotide-activated L-rhamnose. RmlD silencing did not affect fungal growth or morphology but decreased cell wall rhamnose content. Compensatory, the β-1,3-glucan levels increased and were more exposed at the cell surface. Moreover, when incubated with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the RmlD silenced mutants differentially stimulated cytokine production when compared with the wild-type strain, reducing TNFα and IL-6 levels and increasing IL-1 β and IL-10 production. Upon incubation with human monocyte-derived macrophages, the silenced strains were more efficiently phagocytosed than the wild-type strain. In both cases, our data suggest that rhamnose-based oligosaccharides are ligands that interact with TLR4. Finally, our findings showed that cell wall rhamnose is required for the S. schenckii virulence in the G. mellonella model of infection.

Abstract: Summary
The tRNA ligase complex (tRNA-LC) splices precursor tRNAs (pre-tRNA), and Xbp1-mRNA during the unfolded protein response (UPR). In aerobic conditions, a cysteine residue bound to two metal ions in its ancient, catalytic subunit RTCB could make the tRNA-LC susceptible to oxidative inactivation. Here, we confirm this hypothesis and reveal a co-evolutionary association between the tRNA-LC and PYROXD1, a conserved and essential oxidoreductase. We reveal that PYROXD1 preserves the activity of the mammalian tRNA-LC in pre-tRNA splicing and UPR. PYROXD1 binds the tRNA-LC in the presence of NAD(P)H and converts RTCB-bound NAD(P)H into NAD(P)+, a typical oxidative co-enzyme. However, NAD(P)+ here acts as an antioxidant and protects the tRNA-LC from oxidative inactivation, which is dependent on copper ions. Genetic variants of PYROXD1 that cause human myopathies only partially support tRNA-LC activity. Thus, we establish the tRNA-LC as an oxidation-sensitive metalloenzyme, safeguarded by the flavoprotein PYROXD1 through an unexpected redox mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
Lysosomal trafficking and maturation in neurons remain poorly understood and are unstudied in vivo despite high disease relevance. We generated neuron-specific transgenic mice to track vesicular CTSD acquisition, acidification, and traffic within the autophagic-lysosomal pathway in vivo, revealing that mature lysosomes are restricted from axons. Moreover, TGN-derived transport carriers (TCs), not lysosomes, supply lysosomal components to axonal organelles. Ultrastructurally distinctive TCs containing TGN and lysosomal markers enter axons, engaging autophagic vacuoles and late endosomes. This process is markedly upregulated in dystrophic axons of Alzheimer models. In cultured neurons, most axonal LAMP1 vesicles are weakly acidic TCs that shuttle lysosomal components bidirectionally, conferring limited degradative capability to retrograde organelles before they mature fully to lysosomes within perikarya. The minor LAMP1 subpopulation attaining robust acidification are retrograde Rab7+ endosomes/amphisomes, not lysosomes. Restricted lysosome entry into axons explains the unique lysosome distribution in neurons and their vulnerability toward neuritic dystrophy in disease.

Abstract: Schwann cell precursors (SCPs) are a transient population in the embryo, closely associated with nerves along which they migrate into the periphery of the body. Long considered to be progenitors that only form Schwann cells—the myelinating cells of nerves, current evidence suggests that SCPs have much broader developmental potential. Indeed, different cell marking techniques employed over the past 20 years have identified multiple novel SCP derivatives throughout the body. It is now clear that SCPs represent a multipotent progenitor population, which also display a level of plasticity in response to injury. Moreover, they originate from multiple origins in the embryo and may reflect several distinct subpopulations in terms of molecular identity and fate. Here we review SCP origins, derivatives and plasticity in development, growth and repair.

Abstract: Summary
In addition to driving specific gene expression profiles, transcriptional regulators are becoming increasingly recognized for their capacity to modulate chromatin structure. GATA6 is essential for the formation of definitive endoderm; however, the molecular basis defining the importance of GATA6 to endoderm commitment is poorly understood. The members of the GATA family of transcription factors have the capacity to bind and alter the accessibility of chromatin. Using pluripotent stem cells as a model of human development, we reveal that GATA6 is integral to the establishment of the endoderm enhancer network via the induction of chromatin accessibility and histone modifications. We additionally identify the chromatin-modifying complexes that interact with GATA6, defining the putative mechanisms by which GATA6 modulates chromatin architecture. The identified GATA6-dependent processes further our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that underpin cell-fate decisions during formative development.

Abstract: Summary
Poor sleep quality is associated with age-related cognitive decline, and whether reversal of these alterations is possible is unknown. In this study, we report how sleep deprivation (SD) affects hippocampal representations, sleep patterns, and memory in young and old mice. After training in a hippocampus-dependent object-place recognition (OPR) task, control animals sleep ad libitum, although experimental animals undergo 5 h of SD, followed by recovery sleep. Young controls and old SD mice exhibit successful OPR memory, whereas young SD and old control mice are impaired. Successful performance is associated with two cellular phenotypes: (1) “context” cells, which remain stable throughout training and testing, and (2) “object configuration” cells, which remap when objects are introduced to the context and during testing. Additionally, effective memory correlates with spindle counts during non-rapid eye movement (NREM)/rapid eye movement (REM) sigma transitions. These results suggest SD may serve to ameliorate age-related memory deficits and allow hippocampal representations to adapt to changing environments.

Abstract: Summary
Parvalbumin (PV) is a cytosolic Ca2+-binding protein highly expressed in fast skeletal muscle, contributing to an increased relaxation rate. Moreover, PV is an “atrogene” downregulated in most muscle atrophy conditions. Here, we exploit mice lacking PV to explore the link between the two PV functions. Surprisingly, PV ablation partially counteracts muscle loss after denervation. Furthermore, acute PV downregulation is accompanied by hypertrophy and upregulation by atrophy. PV ablation has a minor impact on sarcoplasmic reticulum but is associated with increased mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, mitochondrial size and number, and contacts with Ca2+ release sites. Mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) silencing abolishes the hypertrophic effect of PV ablation, suggesting that mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is required for hypertrophy. In turn, an increase of mitochondrial Ca2+ is required to enhance expression of the pro-hypertrophy gene PGC-1α4, whose silencing blocks hypertrophy due to PV ablation. These results reveal how PV links cytosolic Ca2+ control to mitochondrial adaptations, leading to muscle mass regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Effective control of COVID-19 requires antivirals directed against SARS-CoV-2. We assessed 10 hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease-inhibitor drugs as potential SARS-CoV-2 antivirals. There is a striking structural similarity of the substrate binding clefts of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) and HCV NS3/4A protease. Virtual docking experiments show that these HCV drugs can potentially bind into the Mpro substrate-binding cleft. We show that seven HCV drugs inhibit both SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protease activity and SARS-CoV-2 virus replication in Vero and/or human cells. However, their Mpro inhibiting activities did not correlate with their antiviral activities. This conundrum is resolved by demonstrating that four HCV protease inhibitor drugs, simeprevir, vaniprevir, paritaprevir, and grazoprevir inhibit the SARS CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLpro). HCV drugs that inhibit PLpro synergize with the viral polymerase inhibitor remdesivir to inhibit virus replication, increasing remdesivir’s antiviral activity as much as 10-fold, while those that only inhibit Mpro do not synergize with remdesivir.

Abstract: Summary
Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) remains suppressed in most normal somatic cells. Resulting erosion of telomeres leads eventually to replicative senescence. Reactivation of hTERT maintains telomeres and triggers progression of >90% of cancers. However, any direct causal link between telomeres and telomerase regulation remains unclear. Here, we show that the telomere-repeat-binding-factor 2 (TRF2) binds hTERT promoter G-quadruplexes and recruits the polycomb-repressor EZH2/PRC2 complex. This is causal for H3K27 trimethylation at the hTERT promoter and represses hTERT in cancer as well as normal cells. Two highly recurrent hTERT promoter mutations found in many cancers, including ∼83% glioblastoma multiforme, that are known to destabilize hTERT promoter G-quadruplexes, showed loss of TRF2 binding in patient-derived primary glioblastoma multiforme cells. Ligand-induced G-quadruplex stabilization restored TRF2 binding, H3K27-trimethylation, and hTERT re-suppression. These results uncover a mechanism of hTERT regulation through a telomeric factor, implicating telomere-telomerase molecular links important in neoplastic transformation, aging, and regenerative therapy.

Abstract: Cellular senescence has become a research focus because of its dual roles in ageing and tumorigenesis. The biomarkers of senescence are essential for detecting senescent cells and understanding the ageing process and its regulation. Here, we identify cytosolic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) as a novel sensitive biomarker for cellular senescence of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) in response to common types of stimuli, including replicative stress, genetic modification and oxidative stress. We found that the accumulation of cytosolic dsDNA was positively correlated with the senescence process in MEFs and was detectable earlier than senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) staining, which is the current gold standard for senescence detection. Due to the immunogenicity of dsDNA, we further investigated the stimulation of two dsDNA sensors, cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP)–adenosine monophosphate (AMP) (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) and absent in melanoma-2 (AIM2). The results showed that the cGAS protein level did not significantly change upon senescence stimulation, while AIM2 expression was significantly upregulated in senescent cells. Surprisingly, we found that ageing-related cytosolic dsDNA induced significant pyroptosis activation in the senescent MEFs. These data reveal novel easy-to-detect biomarker for cellular senescence. The activation of downstream immunological response pathways might add new experimental evidence for inflammatory ageing.

Abstract: Summary
NK cells are central to anti-tumor immunity and recently showed efficacy for treating hematologic malignancies. However, their dysfunction in the hostile tumor microenvironment remains a pivotal barrier for cancer immunotherapies against solid tumors. Using cancer patient samples and proteomics, we found that human NK cell dysfunction in the tumor microenvironment is due to suppression of glucose metabolism via lipid peroxidation-associated oxidative stress. Activation of the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway restored NK cell metabolism and function and resulted in greater anti-tumor activity in vivo. Strikingly, expanded NK cells reprogrammed with complete metabolic substrate flexibility not only sustained metabolic fitness but paradoxically augmented their tumor killing in the tumor microenvironment and in response to nutrient deprivation. Our results uncover that metabolic flexibility enables a cytotoxic immune cell to exploit the metabolic hostility of tumors for their advantage, addressing a critical hurdle for cancer immunotherapy.
