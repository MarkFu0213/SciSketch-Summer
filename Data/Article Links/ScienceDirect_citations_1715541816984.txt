Abstract: Summary
The t(8;21) and inv(16) chromosomal aberrations generate the oncoproteins AML1-ETO (A-E) and CBFβ-SMMHC (C-S). The role of these oncoproteins in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) etiology has been well studied. Conversely, the function of native RUNX1 in promoting A-E- and C-S-mediated leukemias has remained elusive. We show that wild-type RUNX1 is required for the survival of t(8;21)-Kasumi-1 and inv(16)-ME-1 leukemic cells. RUNX1 knockdown in Kasumi-1 cells (Kasumi-1RX1-KD) attenuates the cell-cycle mitotic checkpoint, leading to apoptosis, whereas knockdown of A-E in Kasumi-1RX1-KD rescues these cells. Mechanistically, a delicate RUNX1/A-E balance involving competition for common genomic sites that regulate RUNX1/A-E targets sustains the malignant cell phenotype. The broad medical significance of this leukemic cell addiction to native RUNX1 is underscored by clinical data showing that an active RUNX1 allele is usually preserved in both t(8;21) or inv(16) AML patients, whereas RUNX1 is frequently inactivated in other forms of leukemia. Thus, RUNX1 and its mitotic control targets are potential candidates for new therapeutic approaches.

Abstract: Summary
E2F/DP transcription factors regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis. Here, we investigated the mechanism of the resistance of Drosophila dDP mutants to irradiation-induced apoptosis. Contrary to the prevailing view, this is not due to an inability to induce the apoptotic transcriptional program, because we show that this program is induced; rather, this is due to a mitochondrial dysfunction of dDP mutants. We attribute this defect to E2F/DP-dependent control of expression of mitochondria-associated genes. Genetic attenuation of several of these E2F/DP targets mimics the dDP mutant mitochondrial phenotype and protects against irradiation-induced apoptosis. Significantly, the role of E2F/DP in the regulation of mitochondrial function is conserved between flies and humans. Thus, our results uncover a role of E2F/DP in the regulation of mitochondrial function and demonstrate that this aspect of E2F regulation is critical for the normal induction of apoptosis in response to irradiation.

Abstract: Even though the spermatozoa of several strepsipteran species were described earlier, no data were available for the basal family Mengenillidae. Well-fixed material of the recently described Tunisian species Mengenilla moldrzyki was used for a detailed examination of the sperm ultrastructure. The total length is c. 30μm. The head region contains a conical acrosome vesicle (0.3-0.35μm) and an elongated nucleus (7.3μm) with dense chromatin. Some granular material along with a uniformely dense centriole adjunct and two mitochondrial derivatives are visible at the posterior end of the nucleus. The material of the centriole adjunct does not extend along the flagellum and accessory bodies are absent. The mitochondrial derivatives are elongated structures crossed by a longitudinal crista but lacking parallel transverse cristae and paracrystalline material in the dense matrix. The mitochondrial derivatives gradually reduce their size and end at the most posterior tail region. The flagellar axoneme has a 9+9+2 pattern and originates beneath the nucleus. In the terminal tail region the axoneme gradually disintegrates. Despite the extreme specialization of the endoparasitc group, strepsipteran spermatozoa are mostly characterized by plesiomorphies. The pattern within the order is largely uniform, but Mengenilla displays several apomorphic features compared to the presumptive strepsipteran groundplan (e.g., absence of crystallizations and cristae in the mitochondrial derivatives). The subdivision of the intertubular material into two compartments with a dense beak-like structure adhering to the tubular wall supports a clade Coleopterida (=Strepsiptera+Coleoptera)+Neuropterida.

Abstract: Summary
Given the association between mutational load and cancer, the observation that genetic aberrations are frequently found in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) is of concern. Prior studies in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have shown that deletions and regions of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) tend to arise during reprogramming and early culture, whereas duplications more frequently occur during long-term culture. For the corresponding experiments in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), we studied two sets of hESC lines: one including the corresponding parental DNA and the other generated from single blastomeres from four sibling embryos. Here, we show that genetic aberrations observed in hESCs can originate during preimplantation embryo development and/or early derivation. These early aberrations are mainly deletions and LOH, whereas aberrations arising during long-term culture of hESCs are more frequently duplications. Our results highlight the importance of close monitoring of genomic integrity and the development of improved methods for derivation and culture of hPSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Gene amplification of Sox2 at 3q26.33 is a common event in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) of the lung and esophagus, as well as several other cancers. Here, we show that the expression of LSD1/KDM1 histone demethylase is significantly elevated in Sox2-expressing lung SCCs. LSD1-specific inhibitors selectively impair the growth of Sox2-expressing lung SCCs, but not that of Sox2-negative cells. Sox2 expression is associated with sensitivity to LSD1 inhibition in lung, breast, ovarian, and other carcinoma cells. Inactivation of LSD1 reduces Sox2 expression, promotes G1 cell-cycle arrest, and induces genes for differentiation by selectively modulating the methylation states of histone H3 at lysines 4 (H3K4) and 9 (H3K9). Reduction of Sox2 further suppresses Sox2-dependent lineage-survival oncogenic potential, elevates trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27) and enhances growth arrest and cellular differentiation. Our studies suggest that LSD1 serves as a selective epigenetic target for therapy in Sox2-expressing cancers.

Highly Complementary Target RNAs Promote Release of Guide RNAs from Human Argonaute2,

Abstract: Summary
Argonaute proteins use small RNAs to guide the silencing of complementary target RNAs in many eukaryotes. Although small RNA biogenesis pathways are well studied, mechanisms for removal of guide RNAs from Argonaute are poorly understood. Here we show that the Argonaute2 (Ago2) guide RNA complex is extremely stable, with a half-life on the order of days. However, highly complementary target RNAs destabilize the complex and significantly accelerate release of the guide RNA from Ago2. This “unloading” activity can be enhanced by mismatches between the target and the guide 5′ end and attenuated by mismatches to the guide 3′ end. The introduction of 3′ mismatches leads to more potent silencing of abundant mRNAs in mammalian cells. These findings help to explain why the 3′ ends of mammalian microRNAs (miRNAs) rarely match their targets, suggest a mechanism for sequence-specific small RNA turnover, and offer insights for controlling small RNAs in mammalian cells.

Abstract: Interleukin 23 (IL-23) is an inflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in tumor promotion. Expression of IL-23 is increased in cancer cells and correlates with tumor progression. However, the mechanisms regulating IL-23 expression in cancer cells are still unclear. Here we report that tristetraprolin (TTP), an AU-rich element (ARE)-binding protein, inhibits IL-23 production in CT26 mouse colon cancer cells. Overexpression of TTP decreased the stability of IL-23 mRNA and the expression level of IL-23 in CT26 cells. Conversely, inhibition of TTP by siRNA increased IL- 23 production. TTP destabilized a luciferase mRNA reporter containing the IL-23 mRNA 3'UTR, which contains five AREs. Analyses of deletion and point mutants of the IL-23 mRNA 3'UTR demonstrated that the ARE cluster between the third and fifth AREs was responsible for TTP-mediated destabilization of IL-23 mRNA. A RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay confirmed that TTP binds to this ARE cluster. Taken together, these results demonstrate that TTP acts as a negative regulator of IL-23 gene expression in mouse colon cancer cells and suggest its potential application as a novel therapeutic target to control IL-23- mediated tumor promotion.

High-Frequency Promoter Firing Links THO Complex Function to Heavy Chromatin Formation,

Abstract: Summary
The THO complex is involved in transcription, genome stability, and messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) formation, but its precise molecular function remains enigmatic. Under heat shock conditions, THO mutants accumulate large protein-DNA complexes that alter the chromatin density of target genes (heavy chromatin), defining a specific biochemical facet of THO function and a powerful tool of analysis. Here, we show that heavy chromatin distribution is dictated by gene boundaries and that the gene promoter is necessary and sufficient to convey THO sensitivity in these conditions. Single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization measurements show that heavy chromatin formation correlates with an unusually high firing pace of the promoter with more than 20 transcription events per minute. Heavy chromatin formation closely follows the modulation of promoter firing and strongly correlates with polymerase occupancy genome wide. We propose that the THO complex is required for tuning the dynamic of gene-nuclear pore association and mRNP release to the same high pace of transcription initiation.

Abstract: Summary
Reversible posttranslational modifications are emerging as critical regulators of mitochondrial proteins and metabolism. Here, we use a label-free quantitative proteomic approach to characterize the lysine succinylome in liver mitochondria and its regulation by the desuccinylase SIRT5. A total of 1,190 unique sites were identified as succinylated, and 386 sites across 140 proteins representing several metabolic pathways including β-oxidation and ketogenesis were significantly hypersuccinylated in Sirt5−/− animals. Loss of SIRT5 leads to accumulation of medium- and long-chain acylcarnitines and decreased β-hydroxybutyrate production in vivo. In addition, we demonstrate that SIRT5 regulates succinylation of the rate-limiting ketogenic enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2 (HMGCS2) both in vivo and in vitro. Finally, mutation of hypersuccinylated residues K83 and K310 on HMGCS2 to glutamic acid strongly inhibits enzymatic activity. Taken together, these findings establish SIRT5 as a global regulator of lysine succinylation in mitochondria and present a mechanism for inhibition of ketogenesis through HMGCS2.

Abstract: Summary
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes appear to share similar pathogenic mechanisms. dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) underlies peripheral insulin resistance in metabolic disorders. PKR phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α-P), and AD brains exhibit elevated phospho-PKR and eIF2α-P levels. Whether and how PKR and eIF2α-P participate in defective brain insulin signaling and cognitive impairment in AD are unknown. We report that β-amyloid oligomers, AD-associated toxins, activate PKR in a tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)-dependent manner, resulting in eIF2α-P, neuronal insulin receptor substrate (IRS-1) inhibition, synapse loss, and memory impairment. Brain phospho-PKR and eIF2α-P were elevated in AD animal models, including monkeys given intracerebroventricular oligomer infusions. Oligomers failed to trigger eIF2α-P and cognitive impairment in PKR−/− and TNFR1−/− mice. Bolstering insulin signaling rescued phospho-PKR and eIF2α-P. Results reveal pathogenic mechanisms shared by AD and diabetes and establish that proinflammatory signaling mediates oligomer-induced IRS-1 inhibition and PKR-dependent synapse and memory loss.

Abstract: Summary
Individual cancer cells carry a bewildering number of distinct genomic alterations (e.g., copy number variations and mutations), making it a challenge to uncover genomic-driven mechanisms governing tumorigenesis. Here, we performed exome sequencing on several breast cancer cell lines that represent two subtypes, luminal and basal. We integrated these sequencing data and functional RNAi screening data (for the identification of genes that are essential for cell proliferation and survival) onto a human signaling network. Two subtype-specific networks that potentially represent core-signaling mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis were identified. Within both networks, we found that genes were differentially affected in different cell lines; i.e., in some cell lines a gene was identified through RNAi screening, whereas in others it was genomically altered. Interestingly, we found that highly connected network genes could be used to correctly classify breast tumors into subtypes on the basis of genomic alterations. Further, the networks effectively predicted subtype-specific drug targets, which were experimentally validated.

Abstract: Summary
Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are ubiquitous on bacterial chromosomes, yet the mechanisms regulating their activity and the molecular targets of toxins remain incompletely defined. Here, we identify SocAB, an atypical TA system in Caulobacter crescentus. Unlike canonical TA systems, the toxin SocB is unstable and constitutively degraded by the protease ClpXP; this degradation requires the antitoxin, SocA, as a proteolytic adaptor. We find that the toxin, SocB, blocks replication elongation through an interaction with the sliding clamp, driving replication fork collapse. Mutations that suppress SocB toxicity map to either the hydrophobic cleft on the clamp that binds DNA polymerase III or a clamp-binding motif in SocB. Our findings suggest that SocB disrupts replication by outcompeting other clamp-binding proteins. Collectively, our results expand the diversity of mechanisms employed by TA systems to regulate toxin activity and inhibit bacterial growth, and they suggest that inhibiting clamp function may be a generalizable antibacterial strategy.

Abstract: Summary
The EZH2 histone methyltransferase is highly expressed in germinal center (GC) B cells and targeted by somatic mutations in B cell lymphomas. Here, we find that EZH2 deletion or pharmacologic inhibition suppresses GC formation and functions. EZH2 represses proliferation checkpoint genes and helps establish bivalent chromatin domains at key regulatory loci to transiently suppress GC B cell differentiation. Somatic mutations reinforce these physiological effects through enhanced silencing of EZH2 targets. Conditional expression of mutant EZH2 in mice induces GC hyperplasia and accelerated lymphomagenesis in cooperation with BCL2. GC B cell (GCB)-type diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) are mostly addicted to EZH2 but not the more differentiated activated B cell (ABC)-type DLBCLs, thus clarifying the therapeutic scope of EZH2 targeting.

Yeast Haspin Kinase Regulates Polarity Cues Necessary for Mitotic Spindle Positioning and Is Required to Tolerate Mitotic Arrest,

Abstract: Summary
Haspin is an atypical protein kinase that in several organisms phosphorylates histone H3Thr3 and is involved in chromosome segregation. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, H3Thr3 phosphorylation has never been observed and the function of haspin is unknown. We show that deletion of ALK1 and ALK2 haspin paralogs causes the mislocalization of polarisome components. Following a transient mitotic arrest, this leads to an overly polarized actin distribution in the bud where the mitotic spindle is pulled. Here it elongates, generating anucleated mothers and binucleated daughters. Reducing the intensity of the bud-directed pulling forces partially restores proper cell division. We propose that haspin controls the localization of polarity cues to preserve the coordination between polarization and the cell cycle and to tolerate transient mitotic arrests. The evolutionary conservation of haspin and of the polarization mechanisms suggests that this function of haspin is likely shared with other eukaryotes, in which haspin may regulate asymmetric cell division.

Abstract: Summary
Morphogenesis requires the proper migration and positioning of different cell types in the embryo. Much more is known about how cells start and guide their migrations than about how they stop when they reach their destinations. Here we provide evidence that Rbx2, a subunit of the Cullin 5-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL5) complex, stops neocortical projection neurons at their target layers. Rbx2 mutation causes neocortical and cerebellar ectopias dependent on Dab1, a key signaling protein in the Reelin pathway. SOCS7, a CRL5 substrate adaptor protein, is also required for neocortical layering. SOCS7-CRL5 complexes stimulate the ubiquitylation and turnover of Dab1. SOCS7 is upregulated during projection neuron migration, and unscheduled SOCS7 expression stops migration prematurely. Cerebellar development requires Rbx2 but not SOCS7, pointing to the importance of other CRL5 adaptors. Our results suggest that CRL5 adaptor expression is spatiotemporally regulated to modulate Reelin signaling and ensure normal neuron positioning in the developing brain.

Abstract: Summary
We describe a second primase in human cells, PrimPol, which has the ability to start DNA chains with deoxynucleotides unlike regular primases, which use exclusively ribonucleotides. Moreover, PrimPol is also a DNA polymerase tailored to bypass the most common oxidative lesions in DNA, such as abasic sites and 8-oxoguanine. Subcellular fractionation and immunodetection studies indicated that PrimPol is present in both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA compartments. PrimPol activity is detectable in mitochondrial lysates from human and mouse cells but is absent from mitochondria derived from PRIMPOL knockout mice. PRIMPOL gene silencing or ablation in human and mouse cells impaired mitochondrial DNA replication. On the basis of the synergy observed with replicative DNA polymerases Polγ and Polε, PrimPol is proposed to facilitate replication fork progression by acting as a translesion DNA polymerase or as a specific DNA primase reinitiating downstream of lesions that block synthesis during both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA replication.

Abstract: Summary
A critical issue in development is the coordination of the activity of stem cell niches with differentiation of their progeny to ensure coherent organ growth. In the plant root, these processes take place at opposite ends of the meristem and must be coordinated with each other at a distance. Here, we show that in Arabidopsis, the gene SCR presides over this spatial coordination. In the organizing center of the root stem cell niche, SCR directly represses the expression of the cytokinin-response transcription factor ARR1, which promotes cell differentiation, controlling auxin production via the ASB1 gene and sustaining stem cell activity. This allows SCR to regulate, via auxin, the level of ARR1 expression in the transition zone where the stem cell progeny leaves the meristem, thus controlling the rate of differentiation. In this way, SCR simultaneously controls stem cell division and differentiation, ensuring coherent root growth.

Abstract: Summary
Speciation involves the reproductive isolation of natural populations due to the sterility or lethality of their hybrids. However, the molecular basis of hybrid lethality and the evolutionary driving forces that provoke it remain largely elusive. The hybrid male rescue (Hmr) and the lethal hybrid rescue (Lhr) genes serve as a model to study speciation in Drosophilids because their interaction causes lethality in male hybrid offspring. Here, we show that HMR and LHR form a centromeric complex necessary for proper chromosome segregation. We find that the Hmr expression level is substantially higher in Drosophila melanogaster, whereas Lhr expression levels are increased in Drosophila simulans. The resulting elevated amount of HMR/LHR complex in hybrids results in an extensive mislocalization of the complex, an interference with the regulation of transposable elements, and an impairment of cell proliferation.

Abstract: Summary
The tumor suppressor p53 is frequently mutated in human cancer. Common mutant p53 (mutp53) isoforms can actively promote cancer through gain-of-function (GOF) mechanisms. We report that mutp53 prolongs TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation in cultured cells and intestinal organoid cultures. Remarkably, when exposed to dextran sulfate sodium, mice harboring a germline p53 mutation develop severe chronic inflammation and persistent tissue damage, and are highly prone to inflammation-associated colon cancer. This mutp53 GOF is manifested by rapid onset of flat dysplastic lesions that progress to invasive carcinoma with mutp53 accumulation and augmented NF-κB activation, faithfully recapitulating features frequently observed in human colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC). These findings might explain the early appearance of p53 mutations in human CAC.

Abstract: The question of optimization of ion channel function to surrounding temperatures in poikilothermic organisms remains largely uninvestigated. Here, we addressed it by studying the temperature-dependence of L-type Ca2+ channels (LTCCs) in Drosophila larval muscles in the context of their modulation by protein kinase A (PKA). LTCC currents were recorded between 4 and 30°C. Different aspects of LTCC function reached maxima between 15 and 25°C: conductance, tail current amplitude, inactivation rate, and the level of basal up-regulation by PKA (26% at 21°C). Anomalous temperature-dependencies of LTCC conductance and kinetics were similar in control and in the presence of the PKA inhibitor H-89. Analysis of deactivation kinetics revealed excessive tail currents at lower temperatures (up to 15°C), indicative of voltage-dependent facilitation of LTCCs. Tail current magnitude gradually decreased with temperature from a maximum at 15°C until a nearly complete disappearance at 30°C. Elimination of excessive tail currents at higher temperatures coincided with unusual slowing of inactivation, suggesting disruption of the facilitation by rising temperature, possibly through depletion of the pool of contributing channels. Overall, these results suggest the presence of a physiological plasticity optimum of LTCC function in the temperature range of normal Drosophila development.

Abstract: Summary
The functional organization of eukaryotic genomes correlates with specific patterns of histone methylations. Regulatory regions in genomes such as enhancers and promoters differ in their extent of methylation of histone H3 at lysine-4 (H3K4), but it is largely unknown how the different methylation states are specified and controlled. Here, we show that the Kdm5c/Jarid1c/SMCX member of the Kdm5 family of H3K4 demethylases can be recruited to both enhancer and promoter elements in mouse embryonic stem cells and in neuronal progenitor cells. Knockdown of Kdm5c deregulates transcription via local increases in H3K4me3. Our data indicate that by restricting H3K4me3 modification at core promoters, Kdm5c dampens transcription, but at enhancers Kdm5c stimulates their activity. Remarkably, an impaired enhancer function activates the intrinsic promoter activity of Kdm5c-bound distal elements. Our results demonstrate that the Kdm5c demethylase plays a crucial and dynamic role in the functional discrimination between enhancers and core promoters.

Abstract: Summary
Recently, loss of beta-cell-specific traits has been proposed as an early cause of beta cell failure in diabetes. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the loss of beta cell features remain unclear. Here, we identify an Nkx6.1-controlled gene regulatory network as essential for maintaining the functional and molecular traits of mature beta cells. Conditional Nkx6.1 inactivation in adult mice caused rapid-onset diabetes and hypoinsulinemia. Genome-wide analysis of Nkx6.1-regulated genes and functional assays further revealed a critical role for Nkx6.1 in the control of insulin biosynthesis, insulin secretion, and beta cell proliferation. Over time, Nkx6.1-deficient beta cells acquired molecular characteristics of delta cells, revealing a molecular link between impaired beta cell functional properties and loss of cell identity. Given that Nkx6.1 levels are reduced in human type 2 diabetic beta cells, our study lends support to the concept that loss of beta cell features could contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
Eukaryotic genome replication is stochastic, and each cell uses a different cohort of replication origins. We demonstrate that interpreting high-resolution Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome replication data with a mathematical model allows quantification of the stochastic nature of genome replication, including the efficiency of each origin and the distribution of termination events. Single-cell measurements support the inferred values for stochastic origin activation time. A strain, in which three origins were inactivated, confirmed that the distribution of termination events is primarily dictated by the stochastic activation time of origins. Cell-to-cell variability in origin activity ensures that termination events are widely distributed across virtually the whole genome. We propose that the heterogeneity in origin usage contributes to genome stability by limiting potentially deleterious events from accumulating at particular loci.

Abstract: Summary
Multisubunit RNA polymerases (msRNAPs) exhibit high sequence and structural homology, especially within their active sites, which is generally thought to result in msRNAP functional conservation. However, we show that mutations in the trigger loop (TL) in the largest subunit of RNA polymerase I (Pol I) yield phenotypes unexpected from studies of Pol II. For example, a well-characterized gain-of-function mutation in Pol II results in loss of function in Pol I (Pol II: rpb1- E1103G; Pol I: rpa190-E1224G). Studies of chimeric Pol II enzymes hosting Pol I or Pol III TLs suggest that consequences of mutations that alter TL dynamics are dictated by the greater enzymatic context and not solely the TL sequence. Although the rpa190-E1224G mutation diminishes polymerase activity, when combined with mutations that perturb Pol I catalysis, it enhances polymerase function, similar to the analogous Pol II mutation. These results suggest that Pol I and Pol II have different rate-limiting steps.

Abstract: GPR120 functions as a plasma membrane receptor for unsaturated long-chain free fatty acids and involves in GLP-1 secretion, adipogenesis and the control of energy balance. Pancreas is the key organ in fuel and energy metabolism. Here GPR120 expression in human and rat pancreas was observed by RT-PCR, and the distribution and phenotypes of GPR120-positive cells in human and rat pancreas were shown by immunohistochemical staining. GPR120 mRNA expression was found in human and rat pancreas. GPR120-positive cells were scattered mainly in the interstitial tissues of human and rat pancreas, and they were not co-localized with nestin, vimentin, alpha-SMA and glucagon, respectively. However, GPR120 was distributed on the cells positively stained by CD68, the specific marker of macrophages, and on the cells positive stained by CD34 and CD117, the markers of interstitial cells. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the expression of GPR120 in pancreas and shows the distribution of GPR120 in human and rat pancreas.

Abstract: The genetic improvement of garlic plants (Allium sativumL.) with agronomical beneficial traits is rarely achieved due to the lack of an applicable transformation system. Here, we developed an efficient Agrobacterium-mediated transformation procedure with Danyang, an elite Korean garlic cultivar. Examination of sGFP (synthetic green fluorescence protein) expression revealed that treatment with 2(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid (MES), L-cysteine and/or dithiothreitol (DTT) gives the highest efficiency in transient gene transfer during Agrobacterium co-cultivation with calli derived from the roots of in vitro plantlets. To increase stable transformation efficiency, a two-step selection was employed on the basis of hygromycin resistance and sGFP expression. Of the hygromycin-resistant calli initially produced, only sGFP-expressing calli were subcultured for selection of transgenic calli. Transgenic plantlets produced from these calli were grown to maturity. The transformation efficiency increased up to 10.6% via our optimized procedure. DNA and RNA gel-blot analysis indicated that transgenic garlic plants stably integrated and expressed the phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (PAT) gene. A herbicide spraying assay demonstrated that transgenic plants of garlic conferred herbicide resistance, whilst nontransgenic plants and weeds died. These results indicate that our transformation system can be efficiently utilized to produce transgenic garlic plants with agronomic benefits.

Abstract: Summary
Melanoma is one of the most aggressive types of human cancers, and the mechanisms underlying melanoma invasive phenotype are not completely understood. Here, we report that expression of guanosine monophosphate reductase (GMPR), an enzyme involved in de novo biosynthesis of purine nucleotides, was downregulated in the invasive stages of human melanoma. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments revealed that GMPR downregulates the amounts of several GTP-bound (active) Rho-GTPases and suppresses the ability of melanoma cells to form invadopodia, degrade extracellular matrix, invade in vitro, and grow as tumor xenografts in vivo. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that GMPR partially depletes intracellular GTP pools. Pharmacological inhibition of de novo GTP biosynthesis suppressed whereas addition of exogenous guanosine increased invasion of melanoma cells as well as cells from other cancer types. Our data identify GMPR as a melanoma invasion suppressor and establish a link between guanosine metabolism and Rho-GTPase-dependent melanoma cell invasion.

Abstract: Summary
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are abundant in the mammalian transcriptome, and many are specifically expressed in the brain. We have identified a group of lncRNAs, including rhabdomyosarcoma 2-associated transcript (RMST), which are indispensable for neurogenesis. Here, we provide mechanistic insight into the role of human RMST in modulating neurogenesis. RMST expression is specific to the brain, regulated by the transcriptional repressor REST, and increases during neuronal differentiation, indicating a role in neurogenesis. RMST physically interacts with SOX2, a transcription factor known to regulate neural fate. RMST and SOX2 coregulate a large pool of downstream genes implicated in neurogenesis. Through RNA interference and genome-wide SOX2 binding studies, we found that RMST is required for the binding of SOX2 to promoter regions of neurogenic transcription factors. These results establish the role of RMST as a transcriptional coregulator of SOX2 and a key player in the regulation of neural stem cell fate.

Abstract: The Chinese soft-shelled turtle (Pelodiscus sinensis) and its eggs have been utilized as both a source of nutrition and medicine for thousands of years. In the present study, follicular atresia was investigated by morphological analysis as an important factor affecting clutch size. Results showed that follicular atresia can be divided into four stages: (1) development of follicular cell disorder; (2) massive cellular proliferation in the ooplasm with elimination of yolk granules; (3) large amounts of erythrocytes appearing in the ooplasm; (4) gradual degeneration of atretic follicles. For the first time, we have shown follicular atresia to be a dynamic process in P. sinensis and found that yolk granules are eliminated by both liquefaction as well as non-liquefaction processes. The present study may provide detailed morphologic analysis for further research into egg quality and clutch size in P. sinensis.

Abstract: Summary
Quality control of defective mRNAs relies on their translation to detect the lesion. Aberrant proteins are therefore an obligate byproduct of mRNA surveillance and must be degraded to avoid disrupting protein homeostasis. These defective translation products are thought to be ubiquitinated at the ribosome, but the mechanism of ubiquitin ligase selectivity for these ribosomes is not clear. Here, we in vitro reconstitute ubiquitination of nascent proteins produced from aberrant mRNAs. Stalled 80S ribosome-nascent chain complexes are dissociated by the ribosome recycling factors Hbs1/Pelota/ABCE1 to a unique 60S-nascent chain-tRNA complex. The ubiquitin ligase Listerin preferentially recognizes 60S-nascent chains and triggers efficient nascent chain ubiquitination. Interfering with Hbs1 function stabilizes 80S complexes, precludes efficient Listerin recruitment, and reduces nascent chain ubiquitination. Thus, ribosome recycling factors control Listerin localization, explaining how translation products of mRNA surveillance are efficiently ubiquitinated while sparing translating ribosomes.

Abstract: Summary
There is increasing interest in the chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) microenvironment and the mechanisms that may promote CLL cell survival and proliferation. A role for T helper (Th) cells has been suggested, but current evidence is only circumstantial. Here we show that CLL patients had memory Th cells that were specific for endogenous CLL antigens. These Th cells activated autologous CLL cell proliferation in vitro and in human → mouse xenograft experiments. Moreover, CLL cells were efficient antigen-presenting cells that could endocytose and process complex proteins through antigen uptake pathways, including the B cell receptor. Activation of CLL cells by Th cells was contact and CD40L dependent. The results suggest that CLL is driven by ongoing immune responses related to Th cell–CLL cell interaction. We propose that Th cells support malignant B cells and that they could be targeted in the treatment of CLL.

Abstract: Summary
Hox genes are required for the development of the intestinal cecum, a major organ of plant-eating species. We have analyzed the transcriptional regulation of Hoxd genes in cecal buds and show that they are controlled by a series of enhancers located in a gene desert flanking the HoxD cluster. The start site of two opposite long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), Hotdog and Twin of Hotdog, selectively contacts the expressed Hoxd genes in the framework of a topological domain, coinciding with robust transcription of these genes during cecum budding. Both lncRNAs are specifically transcribed in the cecum, albeit bearing no detectable function in trans. Hedgehogs have kept this regulatory potential despite the absence of the cecum, suggesting that these mechanisms are used in other developmental situations. In this context, we discuss the implementation of a common “budding toolkit” between the cecum and the limbs.

Telomeric Noncoding RNA TERRA Is Induced by Telomere Shortening to Nucleate Telomerase Molecules at Short Telomeres,

Abstract: Summary
Elongation of a short telomere depends on the action of multiple telomerase molecules, which are visible as telomerase RNA foci or clusters associated with telomeres in yeast and mammalian cells. How several telomerase molecules act on a single short telomere is unknown. Herein, we report that the telomeric noncoding RNA TERRA is involved in the nucleation of telomerase molecules into clusters prior to their recruitment at a short telomere. We find that telomere shortening induces TERRA expression, leading to the accumulation of TERRA molecules into a nuclear focus. Simultaneous time-lapse imaging of telomerase RNA and TERRA reveals spontaneous events of telomerase nucleation on TERRA foci in early S phase, generating TERRA-telomerase clusters. This cluster is subsequently recruited to the short telomere from which TERRA transcripts originate during S phase. We propose that telomere shortening induces noncoding RNA expression to coordinate the recruitment and activity of telomerase molecules at short telomeres.

Abstract: Summary
Mitotic spindle position is controlled by interactions of cortical molecular motors with astral microtubules. In animal cells, Partner of Inscuteable (Pins) acts at the cortex to coordinate the activity of Dynein and Kinesin-73 (Khc73; KIF13B in mammals) to orient the spindle. Though the two motors move in opposite directions, their synergistic activity is required for robust Pins-mediated spindle orientation. Here, we identify a physical connection between Dynein and Khc73 that mediates cooperative spindle positioning. Khc73’s motor and MBS domains link Pins to microtubule plus ends, while its stalk domain is necessary for Dynein activation and precise positioning of the spindle. A motif in the stalk domain binds, in a phospho-dependent manner, 14-3-3ζ, which dimerizes with 14-3-3ε. The 14-3-3ζ/ε heterodimer binds the Dynein adaptor NudE to complete the Dynein connection. The Khc73 stalk/14-3-3/NudE pathway defines a physical connection that coordinates the activities of multiple motor proteins to precisely position the spindle.

Abstract: Summary
Hedgehog (Hh) signaling during development and in postembryonic tissues requires activation of the 7TM oncoprotein Smoothened (Smo) by mechanisms that may involve endogenous lipidic modulators. Exogenous Smo ligands previously identified include the plant sterol cyclopamine (and its therapeutically useful synthetic mimics) and hydroxylated cholesterol derivatives (oxysterols); Smo is also highly sensitive to cellular sterol levels. The relationships between these effects are unclear because the relevant Smo structural determinants are unknown. We identify the conserved extracellular cysteine-rich domain (CRD) as the site of action for oxysterols on Smo, involving residues structurally analogous to those contacting the Wnt lipid adduct in the homologous Frizzled CRD; this modulatory effect is distinct from that of cyclopamine mimics, from Hh-mediated regulation, and from the permissive action of cellular sterol pools. These results imply that Hh pathway activity is sensitive to lipid binding at several Smo sites, suggesting mechanisms for tuning by multiple physiological inputs.

Abstract: Summary
The urothelium is a multilayered epithelium that serves as a barrier between the urinary tract and blood, preventing the exchange of water and toxic substances. It consists of superficial cells specialized for synthesis and transport of uroplakins that assemble into a tough apical plaque, one or more layers of intermediate cells, and keratin 5-expressing basal cells (K5-BCs), which are considered to be progenitors in the urothelium and other specialized epithelia. Fate mapping, however, reveals that intermediate cells rather than K5-BCs are progenitors in the adult regenerating urothelium, that P cells, a transient population, are progenitors in the embryo, and that retinoids are critical in P cells and intermediate cells, respectively, for their specification during development and regeneration. These observations have important implications for tissue engineering and repair and, ultimately, may lead to treatments that prevent loss of the urothelial barrier, a major cause of voiding dysfunction and bladder pain syndrome.

Here, we found that the sensitivity of Nax channels to [Na+]o is dose-dependently enhanced by endothelin-3 (ET-3). Nax channels began to open when [Na+]o exceeded ∼150 mM without ET-3, but opened fully at a physiological [Na+]o (135–145 mM) with 1 nM ET-3. Importantly, ET-3 was expressed in the subfornical organ (SFO) along with Nax, and the level was robustly increased by dehydration. Pharmacological experiments revealed that endothelin receptor B (ETBR) signaling is involved in this modulation of Nax gating through protein kinase C and ERK1/2 activation. ETBR agonists increased the firing rate of GABAergic neurons via lactate in the SFO, and an ETBR antagonist attenuated salt aversion during dehydration. These results indicate that ET-3 expression in the SFO is tightly coupled with body-fluid homeostasis through modulation of the [Na+]o sensitivity of Nax.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we show that transcription factors bound to regulatory sequences can be identified by purifying these unique sequences directly from mammalian cells in vivo. Using targeted chromatin purification (TChP), a double-pull-down strategy with a tetracycline-sensitive “hook” bound to a specific promoter, we identify transcription factors bound to the repressed γ-globin gene-associated regulatory regions. After validation of the binding, we show that, in human primary erythroid cells, knockdown of a number of these transcription factors induces γ-globin gene expression. Reactivation of γ-globin gene expression ameliorates the symptoms of β-thalassemia and sickle cell disease, and these factors provide potential targets for the development of therapeutics for treating these patients.

Abstract: Summary
In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, heterochromatin spread, which is marked by histone 3 lysine 9 methylation (H3K9me), requires the chromodomains (CDs) of the H3K9 methylase Suv39/Clr4 and the HP1/Swi6 protein. It is unclear how the actions of these two H3K9me-recognizing CDs are coordinated. We find that the intrinsic preference of Suv39/Clr4 is to generate dimethylated H3K9 product. The recognition of pre-existing H3K9me marks by the CD of Suv39/Clr4 stimulates overall catalysis, enabling the accumulation of small amounts of trimethylated product in vivo. Coincidentally, the Suv39/Clr4 CD, unlike the HP1/Swi6 CD, has been shown to prefer the trimethyl state over the dimethyl state. We show that this preference enables efficient heterochromatin spread in vivo by reducing competition with HP1 proteins for the more prevalent dimethyl state. Our results reveal a strategy by which “writers” and “readers” of a chromatin mark exploit different methylation states on the same residue in order to facilitate collaboration and avoid competition.

Abstract: Summary
Dissemination of cancer cells from primary tumors is the key event in metastasis, but specific determinants are widely unknown. Here, we show that DNp73, an inhibitor of the p53 tumor suppressor family, drives migration and invasion of nonmetastatic melanoma cells. Knockdown of endogenous DNp73 reduces this behavior in highly metastatic cell lines. Tumor xenografts expressing DNp73 show a higher ability to invade and metastasize, while growth remains unaffected. DNp73 facilitates an EMT-like phenotype with loss of E-cadherin and Slug upregulation. We provide mechanistic insight toward regulation of LIMA1/EPLIN by p73/DNp73 and demonstrate a direct link between the DNp73-EPLIN axis and IGF1R-AKT/STAT3 activation. These findings establish initiation of the invasion-metastasis cascade via EPLIN-dependent IGF1R regulation as major activity of DNp73.

Abstract: Summary
The DEAD-box adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) Prp5p facilitates U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) binding to the intron branch site region during spliceosome assembly. We present crystal structures of S. cerevisiae Prp5p alone and in complex with ADP at 2.12 Å and 1.95 Å resolution. The three-dimensional packing of Prp5p subdomains differs strikingly from that so far observed in other DEAD-box proteins: two RecA-like subdomains adopt an “open state” conformation stabilized by extensive interactions involving sequences that flank the two subdomains. This conformation is distinct from that required for ATP hydrolysis. Consistent with this, Prp5p mutations that destabilize interdomain interactions exhibited increased ATPase activity in vitro and inhibited splicing of suboptimal branch site substrates in vivo, whereas restoration of interdomain interactions reversed these effects. We conclude that the Prp5p open state conformation is biologically relevant and that disruption of the interdomain interaction facilitates a large-scale conformational change of Prp5p during U2 snRNP-branch site recognition.

Abstract: Summary
Faithful copying of the genome is essential for life. In eukaryotes, a single archaeo-eukaryotic primase (AEP), DNA primase, is required for the initiation and progression of DNA replication. Here we have identified additional eukaryotic AEP-like proteins with DNA-dependent primase and/or polymerase activity. Uniquely, the genomes of trypanosomatids, a group of kinetoplastid protozoa of significant medical importance, encode two PrimPol-like (PPL) proteins. In the African trypanosome, PPL2 is a nuclear enzyme present in G2 phase cells. Following PPL2 knockdown, a cell-cycle arrest occurs after the bulk of DNA synthesis, the DNA damage response is activated, and cells fail to recover. Consistent with this phenotype, PPL2 replicates damaged DNA templates in vitro, including templates containing the UV-induced pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproduct. Furthermore, PPL2 accumulates at sites of nuclear DNA damage. Taken together, our results indicate an essential role for PPL2 in postreplication tolerance of endogenous DNA damage, thus allowing completion of genome duplication.

Abstract: Summary
We performed a loss-of-function RNA interference screen to define therapeutic targets in multiple myeloma, a genetically diverse plasma cell malignancy. Unexpectedly, we discovered that all myeloma lines require caspase-10 for survival irrespective of their genetic abnormalities. The transcription factor IRF4 induces both caspase-10 and its associated protein cFLIPL in myeloma, generating a protease that does not induce apoptosis but rather blocks an autophagy-dependent cell death pathway. Caspase-10 inhibits autophagy by cleaving the BCL2-interacting protein BCLAF1, itself a strong inducer of autophagy that acts by displacing beclin-1 from BCL2. While myeloma cells require a basal level of autophagy for survival, caspase-10 tempers this response to avoid cell death. Drugs that disrupt this vital balance may have therapeutic potential in myeloma.

Abstract: The previous identification of 21 proteins in the digital setae transcriptome of Gekko gecko, 2 alpha-keratins of 52–53kDa and 19 beta-proteins (beta-keratins) of 10–21kDa, has indicated that most of setal corneous proteins are cysteine-rich. The production of specific antibodies for two of the main beta-protein subfamilies expressed in gecko setae has allowed the ultrastructural localization of two beta-proteins indicated as Ge-cprp-9 (cysteine-rich) and Ge-gprp-6 (glycine-rich). Only Ge-cprp-9, representing most of the 16 cysteine-rich beta-proteins, is present in the oberhautchen, setae and in the terminal spatula where adhesion takes place, supporting the previous expression study. Instead, the glycine-rich beta-proteins (Ge-gprp-6), representing the 3 glycine-rich beta-proteins of digital epidermis is only present in the stiff beta-layer of the digital scales and in the thin beta layer of the pad lamella sustaining the setae. Ge-cprp-9 is representative for most of the remaining 15 cys-rich proteins (Ge-cprp 1–16) and may have a structural and functional role in the process of adhesion. Most of the cysteine-rich setal proteins have a net positive charge and it is here hypothesized that these proteins may induce the formation of dipoles at the surface interface between the spatula and the substrate, enhancing the van der Waals forces and therefore adhesion to the substrate. The selection and improvement of these proteins during the evolution of geckos may have represented a successful factor for the survival and ecological adaptations of these climbing lizards.

Abstract: The purinergic receptor P2Y, G protein coupled, 14 (P2Y14) receptor for UDP-glucose and other UDP-sugars has been implicated in the regulation of the stem cell compartment as well as neuroimmune function. However, the role of P2Y14 in osteoclast formation is completely unknown. We found that RANKL selectively induced P2Y14 among seven mammalian P2Y receptors when analysed at both the mRNA and protein level, but inhibitors of the mitogen- activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway suppressed induction of P2Y14 proteins. Extracellular addition of UDP-su- gars such as UDP-glucose, UDP-galactose, UDP-glucuro- nic acid, and UDP-N-acetyl glucosamine promoted RANKL- induced osteoclastogenesis, while P2Y14 downregulation by RNA interference inhibited osteoclast formation. Taken together, these results suggest that P2Y14 may act as the receptor for UDP-sugars in osteoclast precusors and may regulate RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Several proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressors regulate the production of ribosomes. Ribosome biogenesis is a major consumer of cellular energy, and defects result in p53 activation via repression of mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) homolog by the ribosomal proteins RPL5 and RPL11. Here, we report that RPL5 and RPL11 regulate p53 from the context of a ribosomal subcomplex, the 5S ribonucleoprotein particle (RNP). We provide evidence that the third component of this complex, the 5S rRNA, is critical for p53 regulation. In addition, we show that the 5S RNP is essential for the activation of p53 by p14ARF, a protein that is activated by oncogene overexpression. Our data show that the abundance of the 5S RNP, and therefore p53 levels, is determined by factors regulating 5S complex formation and ribosome integration, including the tumor suppressor PICT1. The 5S RNP therefore emerges as the critical coordinator of signaling pathways that couple cell proliferation with ribosome production.

Abstract: The importance of Ca2+ signaling in astrocytes is undisputed but a potential role of Ca2+ influx via L-channels in the brain in vivo is disputed, although expression of these channels in cultured astrocytes is recognized. This study shows that an increase in free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in astrocytes in primary cultures in response to an increased extracellular K+ concentration (45mM) is inhibited not only by nifedipine (confirming previous observations) but also to a very large extent by ryanodine, inhibiting ryanodine receptor-mediated release of Ca2+, known to occur in response to an elevation in [Ca2+]i. This means that the actual influx of Ca2+ is modest, which may contribute to the difficulty in demonstrating L-channel-mediated Ca2+ currents in astrocytes in intact brain tissue. Chronic treatment with any of the 3 conventional anti-bipolar drugs lithium, carbamazepine or valproic acid similarly causes a pronounced inhibition of K+-mediated increase in [Ca2+]i. This is shown to be due to an inhibition of capacitative Ca2+ influx, reflected by decreased mRNA and protein expression of the ‘transient receptor potential channel’ (TRPC1), a constituent of store-operated channels (SOCEs). Literature data are cited (i) showing that depolarization-mediated Ca2+ influx in response to an elevated extracellular K+ concentration is important for generation of Ca2+ oscillations and for the stimulatory effect of elevated K+ concentrations in intact, non-cultured brain tissue, and (ii) that Ca2+ channel activity is dependent upon availability of metabolic substrates, including glycogen. Finally, expression of mRNA for Cav1.3 is demonstrated in freshly separated astrocytes from normal brain.

Abstract: The Malpighian tubules of adult flesh fly, Sarcophaga ruficornis consist of principal and stellate cells. The principal cells reveal all the characteristics of transporting epithelia with well developed deep basal membrane infoldings forming a complex of interconnecting labyrinth of canaliculi and luminal microvilli, both of which are associated with mitochondria. The central cytoplasm of the cells contains a well developed nucleus, clear vacuoles or vacuoles filled with secretory material, mineral concretions or spherocrystals, lysosomes and a network of endoplasmic reticulum. The mineral concretions are also observed in the region of luminal microvilli and in the lumen of the tubule suggesting their extrusion into the lumen by exocytosis. Several formed bodies are also observed in the lumen. Stellate cells are characterized by simple membrane infoldings and luminal microvilli devoid of mitochondria. The cells are separated by septate junctions. The Malpighian tubules are richly supplied by tracheae and muscle fibers.

Abstract: Summary
Oncogene-induced senescence is an important tumor-suppressing defense mechanism. However, relatively little is known about the signaling pathway mediating the senescence response. Here, we demonstrate that a multifunctional acetyltransferase, Tip60, plays an essential role in oncogenic ras-induced senescence. Further investigation reveals a cascade of posttranslational modifications involving p38, Tip60, and PRAK, three proteins that are essential for ras-induced senescence. Upon activation by ras, p38 induces the acetyltransferase activity of Tip60 through phosphorylation of Thr158; activated Tip60 in turn directly interacts with and induces the protein kinase activity of PRAK through acetylation of K364 in a manner that depends on phosphorylation of both Tip60 and PRAK by p38. These posttranslational modifications are critical for the prosenescent function of Tip60 and PRAK, respectively. These results have defined a signaling pathway that mediates oncogene-induced senescence, and identified posttranslational modifications that regulate the enzymatic activity and biological functions of Tip60 and PRAK.

Abstract: We previously reported that OsERG1 and OsERG3 encode rice small C2-domain proteins with different biochemical properties in Ca2+- and phospholipid-binding assays. Os-ERG1 exhibited Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding, which was not observed with OsERG3. In the present study, we show that both OsERG1 and OsERG3 proteins exhibit oligomerization properties as determined by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and glutaraldehyde cross-linking experiments. Furthermore, in vitro phosphorylation assays reveal the phosphorylation of OsERG1 and OsERG3 by a rice calcium-dependent protein kinase, OsCDPK5. Our mutation analysis on putative serine phosphorylation sites shows that the first serine (Ser) at position 41 of OsERG1 may be an essential residue for phosphorylation by OsCDPK5. Mutation of Ser41 to alanine (OsERG1S41A) and aspartate (OsERG1S41D) abolishes the ability of OsERG1 to bind phospholipids regardless of the presence or absence of Ca2+ ions. In addition, unlike the OsERG1 wild-type form, the mutant OsERG1 (S41A)::smGFP construct lost the ability to translocate from the cytosol to the plasma membrane in response to calcium ions or fungal elicitor. These results indicate that Ser41 may be essential for the function of OsERG1.

FRET-based sensor analysis reveals caveolae are spatially distinct Ca2+ stores in endothelial cells,

Abstract: Ca2+-regulating and Ca2+-dependent molecules enriched in caveolae are typically shaped as plasmalemmal invaginations or vesicles. Caveolae structure and subcellular distribution are critical for Ca2+ release from endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores and for Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space into the cell. However, Ca2+ dynamics inside caveolae have never been directly measured and remain uncharacterized. To target the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based Ca2+ sensing protein D1, a mutant of cameleon, to the intra-caveolar space, we made a cDNA construct encoding a chimeric protein of lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor 1 (LOX-1) and D1 (LOXD1). Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy confirmed that a significant portion of LOXD1 was localized with caveolin-1 at morphologically apparent caveolar vesicles in endothelial cells. LOXD1 detected ATP-induced transient Ca2+ decreases by confocal FRET imaging in the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+. This ATP-induced Ca2+ decrease was abolished following knockdown of caveoin-1, suggesting an association with caveolae. The X-ray spectra obtained by the spot analysis of electron-opaque pyroantimonate precipitates further confirmed that ATP-induced calcium decreases in intra-caveolar vesicles. In conclusion, subplasmalemmal caveolae function as Ca2+-releasable Ca2+ stores in response to ATP. This intracellular local Ca2+ delivery system may contribute to the complex spatiotemporal organization of Ca2+ signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Sensory axon development requires concerted actions of growth factors for the precise control of axonal outgrowth and target innervation. How developing sensory neurons integrate different cues is poorly understood. We demonstrate here that Smad1 activation is required for neurotrophin-mediated sensory axon growth in vitro and in vivo. Through differential phosphorylation, Smad1 exerts transcriptional selectivity to regulate the expression and activity of Erk1 and Erk2—two key neurotrophin effectors. Specifically, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) signal through carboxy-terminal phosphorylation of Smad1 (pSmad1C) to induce Erk1/2 transcription for enhanced neurotrophin responsiveness. Meanwhile, neurotrophin signaling results in linker phosphorylation of Smad1 (pSmad1L), which in turn upregulates an Erk-specific dual-specificity phosphatase, Dusp6, leading to reduced pErk1/2 and constituting a negative-feedback loop for the prevention of axon overgrowth. Together, the BMP and neurotrophin pathways form a tightly regulated signaling network with a balanced ratio of Erk1/2 and pErk1/2 to direct the precise connections between sensory neurons and peripheral targets.

Abstract: Summary
The semaphorin guidance molecules and their receptors, the plexins, are often inappropriately expressed in cancers. However, the signaling processes mediated by plexins in tumor cells are still poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the Semaphorin 3E (Sema3E) regulates tumor cell survival by suppressing an apoptotic pathway triggered by the Plexin D1 dependence receptor. In mouse models of breast cancer, a ligand trap that sequesters Sema3E inhibited tumor growth and reduced metastasis through a selective tumor cytocidal effect. We further showed that Plexin D1 triggers apoptosis via interaction with the orphan nuclear receptor NR4A1. These results define a critical role of Sema3E/Plexin D1 interaction in tumor resistance to apoptosis and suggest a therapeutic approach based on activation of a dependence receptor pathway.

Abstract: Summary
The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRTs) have emerged as key cellular machinery that drive topologically unique membrane deformation and scission. Understanding how the ESCRT-III polymer interacts with membrane, promoting and/or stabilizing membrane deformation, is an important step in elucidating this sculpting mechanism. Using a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches, both in vivo and in vitro, we identify two essential modules required for ESCRT-III-membrane association: an electrostatic cluster and an N-terminal insertion motif. Mutating either module in yeast causes cargo sorting defects in the MVB pathway. We show that the essential N-terminal insertion motif provides a stable anchor for the ESCRT-III polymer. By replacing this N-terminal motif with well-characterized membrane insertion modules, we demonstrate that the N terminus of Snf7 has been tuned to maintain the topological constraints associated with ESCRT-III-filament-mediated membrane invagination and vesicle formation. Our results provide insights into the spatially unique, ESCRT-III-mediated membrane remodeling.

Abstract: Summary
Assembly of 30S ribosomal subunits from their protein and RNA components requires extensive refolding of the 16S rRNA and is assisted by 10–20 assembly factors in bacteria. We probed the structures of 30S assembly intermediates in E. coli cells, using a synchrotron X-ray beam to generate hydroxyl radical in the cytoplasm. Widespread differences between mature and pre-30S complexes in the absence of assembly factors RbfA and RimM revealed global reorganization of RNA-protein interactions prior to maturation of the 16S rRNA and showed how RimM reduces misfolding of the 16S 3′ domain during transcription in vivo. Quantitative 14N/15N mass spectrometry of affinity-purified pre-30S complexes confirmed the absence of tertiary assembly proteins and showed that N-terminal acetylation of proteins S18 and S5 correlates with correct folding of the platform and central pseudoknot. Our results indicate that cellular factors delay specific RNA folding steps to ensure the quality of assembly.

Abstract: The microcirculation is the site of gas and nutrient exchange. Control of central or local signals acting on the myocytes, pericytes and endothelial cells within it, is essential for health. Due to technical problems of accessibility, the mechanisms controlling Ca2+ signalling and contractility of myocytes and pericytes in different sections of microvascular networks in situ have not been investigated. We aimed to investigate Ca2+ signalling and functional responses, in a microcirculatory network in situ. Using live confocal imaging of ureteric microvascular networks, we have studied the architecture, morphology, Ca2+ signalling and contractility of myocytes and pericytes. Ca2+ signals vary between distributing arcade and downstream transverse and precapillary arterioles, are modified by agonists, with sympathetic agonists being ineffective beyond transverse arterioles. In myocytes and pericytes, Ca2+ signals arise from Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced Ca2+ release and not via ryanodine receptors or Ca2+ entry into the cell. The responses in pericytes are less oscillatory, slower and longer-lasting than those in myocytes. Myocytes and pericytes are electrically coupled, transmitting Ca2+ signals between arteriolar and venular networks dependent on gap junctions and Ca2+ entry via L-type Ca2+ channels. Endothelial Ca2+ signalling inhibits intracellular Ca2+ oscillations in myocytes and pericytes via L-arginine/nitric oxide pathway and intercellular propagating Ca2+ signals via EDHF. Increases of Ca2+ in pericytes and myocytes constrict all vessels except capillaries. These data reveal the structural and signalling specializations allowing blood flow to be regulated by myocytes and pericytes.

Abstract: Summary
Aging is characterized by a progressive decline in multiple physiological functions (i.e., functional aging). As animals age, they exhibit a gradual loss in motor activity, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we approach this question in C. elegans by functionally characterizing its aging nervous system and muscles. We find that motor neurons exhibit a progressive functional decline, beginning in early life. Surprisingly, body-wall muscles, which were previously thought to undergo functional aging, do not manifest such a decline until mid-late life. Notably, motor neurons first develop a deficit in synaptic vesicle fusion followed by that in quantal size and vesicle docking/priming, revealing specific functional deteriorations in synaptic transmission. Pharmacological stimulation of synaptic transmission can improve motor activity in aged animals. These results uncover a critical role for the nervous system in age-dependent motor activity decline in C. elegans and provide insights into how functional aging occurs in this organism.

Abstract: Summary
Active metabolism regulates oocyte cell death via calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)-mediated phosphorylation of caspase-2, but the link between metabolic activity and CaMKII is poorly understood. Here we identify coenzyme A (CoA) as the key metabolic signal that inhibits Xenopus laevis oocyte apoptosis by directly activating CaMKII. We found that CoA directly binds to the CaMKII regulatory domain in the absence of Ca2+ to activate CaMKII in a calmodulin-dependent manner. Furthermore, we show that CoA inhibits apoptosis not only in X. laevis oocytes but also in Murine oocytes. These findings uncover a direct mechanism of CaMKII regulation by metabolism and further highlight the importance of metabolism in preserving oocyte viability.

Abstract: This study was designed to investigate the effectiveness of a novel tissue-engineered three-dimensional collagen implant on healing of a large tendon-defect model, in vivo. Forty rabbits were divided into two equal groups: treated and control. A 2cm full-thickness gap was created in the left Achilles tendons of all the rabbits. To maintain the gap at the desired length (2cm), a Kessler suture was anchored within the proximal and distal ends of the remaining tendon. In the treated group a collagen implant was inserted in the gap while in the control group the gap was left unfilled. At weekly intervals the animals were examined clinically and their Achilles tendons tested bioelectrically. The hematological parameters and the serum Platelet-Derived Growth Factor of the animals were analyzed at 60 days post injury (DPI) immediately prior to euthanasia. Their injured (left) and normal contralateral Achilles tendons were harvested and examined at gross morphologic level before being subjected to biomechanical testing, and biophysical and biochemical analysis. The treated animals showed superior weight-bearing and greater physical activity than their controls. New dense tendinous tissue with a transverse diameter comparable to that of intact tendons filled the defect area of the treated tendons and had entirely replaced the collagen implant, at 60 DPI. In control lesions the defect was filled with loose areolar connective tissue similar to subcutaneous fascia. Treatment significantly improved the electrical resistance, dry matter, hydroxyproline content, water uptake and water delivery characteristics, of the healing tissue, as well as maximum load, yield load, maximum stress, yield stress and modulus of elasticity of the injured treated tendons compared to those of the control tendons (P<0.05). Use of this three-dimensional collagen implant improved the healing of large tendon defects in rabbits.

Abstract: Summary
Sustained tumor progression has been attributed to a distinct population of tumor-propagating cells (TPCs). To identify TPCs relevant to lung cancer pathogenesis, we investigated functional heterogeneity in tumor cells isolated from Kras-driven mouse models of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). CD24+ITGB4+Notchhi cells are capable of propagating tumor growth in both a clonogenic and an orthotopic serial transplantation assay. While all four Notch receptors mark TPCs, Notch3 plays a nonredundant role in tumor cell propagation in two mouse models and in human NSCLC. The TPC population is enriched after chemotherapy, and the gene signature of mouse TPCs correlates with poor prognosis in human NSCLC. The role of Notch3 in tumor propagation may provide a therapeutic target for NSCLC.

Abstract: Summary
Abundantly expressed in fetal tissues and adult muscle, the developmentally regulated H19 long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) has been implicated in human genetic disorders and cancer. However, how H19 acts to regulate gene function has remained enigmatic, despite the recent implication of its encoded miR-675 in limiting placental growth. We noted that vertebrate H19 harbors both canonical and noncanonical binding sites for the let-7 family of microRNAs, which plays important roles in development, cancer, and metabolism. Using H19 knockdown and overexpression, combined with in vivo crosslinking and genome-wide transcriptome analysis, we demonstrate that H19 modulates let-7 availability by acting as a molecular sponge. The physiological significance of this interaction is highlighted in cultures in which H19 depletion causes precocious muscle differentiation, a phenotype recapitulated by let-7 overexpression. Our results reveal an unexpected mode of action of H19 and identify this lncRNA as an important regulator of the major let-7 family of microRNAs.

Abstract: Summary
Diet-induced obesity (DIO) predisposes individuals to insulin resistance, and adipose tissue has a major role in the disease. Insulin resistance can be induced in cultured adipocytes by a variety of treatments, but what aspects of the in vivo responses are captured by these models remains unknown. We use global RNA sequencing to investigate changes induced by TNF-α, hypoxia, dexamethasone, high insulin, and a combination of TNF-α and hypoxia, comparing the results to the changes in white adipose tissue from DIO mice. We found that different in vitro models capture distinct features of DIO adipose insulin resistance, and a combined treatment of TNF-α and hypoxia is most able to mimic the in vivo changes. Using genome-wide DNase I hypersensitivity followed by sequencing, we further examined the transcriptional regulation of TNF-α-induced insulin resistance, and we found that C/EPBβ is a potential key regulator of adipose insulin resistance.

Abstract: Summary
The Uba6 (E1)-Use1 (E2) ubiquitin transfer cascade is a poorly understood alternative arm of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) and is required for mouse embryonic development, independent of the canonical Uba1-E2-E3 pathway. Loss of neuronal Uba6 during embryonic development results in altered patterning of neurons in the hippocampus and the amygdala, decreased dendritic spine density, and numerous behavioral disorders. The levels of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Ube3a (E6-AP) and Shank3, both linked with dendritic spine function, are elevated in the amygdala of Uba6-deficient mice, while levels of the Ube3a substrate Arc are reduced. Uba6 and Use1 promote proteasomal turnover of Ube3a in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) and catalyze Ube3a ubiquitylation in vitro. These activities occur in parallel with an independent pathway involving Uba1-UbcH7, but in a spatially distinct manner in MEFs. These data reveal an unanticipated role for Uba6 in neuronal development, spine architecture, mouse behavior, and turnover of Ube3a.

Abstract: Summary
The PAN2-PAN3 deadenylase complex functions in general and miRNA-mediated mRNA degradation and is specifically recruited to miRNA targets by GW182/TNRC6 proteins. We describe the PAN3 adaptor protein crystal structure that, unexpectedly, forms intertwined and asymmetric homodimers. Dimerization is mediated by a coiled coil that links an N-terminal pseudokinase to a C-terminal knob domain. The PAN3 pseudokinase binds ATP, and this function is required for mRNA degradation in vivo. We further identified conserved surfaces required for mRNA degradation, including the binding surface for the PAN2 deadenylase on the knob domain. The most remarkable structural feature is the presence of a tryptophan-binding pocket at the dimer interface, which mediates binding to TNRC6C in human cells. Together, our data reveal the structural basis for the interaction of PAN3 with PAN2 and the recruitment of the PAN2-PAN3 complex to miRNA targets by TNRC6 proteins.

Abstract: Summary
The NLRP3 inflammasome is activated in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), but it remains unknown whether its activation contributes to AMD pathologies. VEGF-A is increased in neovascular (“wet”) AMD, but it is not known whether it plays a role in inflammasome activation, whether an increase of VEGF-A by itself is sufficient to cause neovascular AMD and whether it can contribute to nonexudative (“dry”) AMD that often co-occurs with the neovascular form. Here, it is shown that an increase in VEGF-A results in NLRP3 inflammasome activation and is sufficient to cause both forms of AMD pathologies. Targeting NLRP3 or the inflammasome effector cytokine IL-1β inhibits but does not prevent VEGF-A-induced AMD pathologies, whereas targeting IL-18 promotes AMD. Thus, increased VEGF-A provides a unifying pathomechanism for both forms of AMD; combining therapeutic inhibition of both VEGF-A and IL-1β or the NLRP3 inflammasome is therefore likely to suppress both forms of AMD.

Abstract: Summary
Ovarian cancer has a poor prognosis, with different outcomes for different patients. The mechanism underlying this poor prognosis and heterogeneity is not well understood. We have developed an unbiased, adaptive clustering approach to integratively analyze ovarian cancer genome-wide gene expression, DNA methylation, microRNA expression, and copy number alteration profiles. We uncovered seven previously uncategorized subtypes of ovarian cancer that differ significantly in median survival time. We then developed an algorithm to uncover molecular signatures that distinguish cancer subtypes. Surprisingly, although the good-prognosis subtypes seem to have not been functionally selected, the poor-prognosis ones clearly have been. One subtype has an epithelial–mesenchymal transition signature and a cancer hallmark network, whereas the other two subtypes are enriched for a network centered on SRC and KRAS. Our results suggest molecular signatures that are highly predictive of clinical outcomes and spotlight “driver” genes that could be targeted by subtype-specific treatments.

Phosphorylation of DYNLT1 at Serine 82 Regulates Microtubule Stability and Mitochondrial Permeabilization in Hypoxia,

Abstract: Hypoxia-induced microtubule disruption and mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT) are crucial events leading to fatal cell damage and recent studies showed that microtubules (MTs) are involved in the modulation of mitochondrial function. Dynein light chain Tctex-type 1 (DYNLT1) is thought to be associated with MTs and mitochondria. Previously we demonstrated that DYNLT1 knockdown aggravates hypoxia-induced mitochondrial permeabilization, which indicates a role of DYNLT1 in hypoxic cytoprotection. But the underlying regulatory mechanism of DYNLT1 remains illusive. Here we aimed to investigate the phosphorylation alteration of DYNLT1 at serine 82 (S82) in hypoxia (1% O2). We therefore constructed recombinant adenoviruses to generate S82E and S82A mutants, used to transfect H9c2 and HeLa cell lines. Development of hypoxia-induced mPT (MMP examining, Cyt c release and mPT pore opening assay), hypoxic energy metabolism (cellular viability and ATP quantification), and stability of MTs were examined. Our results showed that phosph-S82 (S82-P) expression was increased in early hypoxia; S82E mutation (phosphomimic) aggravated mitochondrial damage, elevated the free tubulin in cytoplasm and decreased the cellular viability; S82A mutation (dephosphomimic) seemed to diminish the hypoxia-induced injury. These data suggest that DYNLT1 phosphorylation at S82 is involved in MTs and mitochondria regulation, and their interaction and cooperation contribute to the cellular hypoxic tolerance. Thus, we provide new insights into a DYNLT1 mechanism in stabilizing MTs and mitochondria, and propose a potential therapeutic target for hypoxia cytoprotective studies.

Abstract: Summary
Protein synthesis in neuronal dendrites underlies long-term memory formation in the brain. Local translation of reporter mRNAs has demonstrated translation in dendrites at focal points called translational hotspots. Various reports have shown that hundreds to thousands of mRNAs are localized to dendrites, yet the dynamics of translation of multiple dendritic mRNAs has remained elusive. Here, we show that the protein translational activities of two dendritically localized mRNAs are spatiotemporally complex but constrained by the translational hotspots in which they are colocalized. Cotransfection of glutamate receptor 2 (GluR2) and GluR4 mRNAs (engineered to encode different fluorescent proteins) into rat hippocampal neurons demonstrates a heterogeneous distribution of translational hotspots for the two mRNAs along dendrites. Stimulation with s-3,5-dihydroxy-phenylglycine modifies the translational dynamics of both of these RNAs in a complex saturable manner. These results suggest that the translational hotspot is a primary structural regulator of the simultaneous yet differential translation of multiple mRNAs in the neuronal dendrite.

Abstract: Summary
Stress-regulated signaling pathways protect mitochondrial proteostasis and function from pathologic insults. Despite the importance of stress-regulated signaling pathways in mitochondrial proteome maintenance, the molecular mechanisms by which these pathways maintain mitochondrial proteostasis remain largely unknown. We identify Tim17A as a stress-regulated subunit of the translocase of the inner membrane 23 (TIM23) mitochondrial protein import complex. We show that Tim17A protein levels are decreased downstream of stress-regulated translational attenuation induced by eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) phosphorylation through a mechanism dependent on the mitochondrial protease YME1L. Furthermore, we demonstrate that decreasing Tim17A attenuates TIM23-dependent protein import, promotes the induction of mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR)-associated proteostasis genes, and confers stress resistance in C. elegans and mammalian cells. Thus, our results indicate that Tim17A degradation is a stress-responsive mechanism by which cells adapt mitochondrial protein import efficiency and promote mitochondrial proteostasis in response to the numerous pathologic insults that induce stress-regulated translation attenuation.

Abstract: The expression of the six rice ASR genes is differentially regulated in a tissue-dependent manner according to environmental conditions and reproductive stages. OsASR1 and OsASR3 are the most abundant and are found in most tissues; they are enriched in the leaves and roots, respectively. Coexpression analysis of OsASR1 and OsASR3 and a comparison of the cis-acting elements upstream of OsASR1 and OsASR3 suggested that their expression is regulated in common by abiotic stresses but differently regulated by hormone and sugar signals. The results of quantitative real-time PCR analyses of OsASR1 and OsASR3 expression under various conditions further support this model. The expression of both OsASR1 and OsASR3 was induced by drought stress, which is a major regulator of the expression of all ASR genes in rice. In contrast, ABA is not a common regulator of the expression of these genes. OsASR1 transcription was highly induced by ABA, whereas OsASR3 transcription was strongly induced by GA. In addition, OsASR1 and OsASR3expression was significantly induced by sucrose and sucrose/glucose treatments, respectively. The induction of gene expression in response to these specific hormone and sugar signals was primarily observed in the major target tissues of these genes (i.e., OsASR1 in leaves and OsASR3 in roots). Our data also showed that the overexpression of either OsASR1 or OsASR3 in transgenic rice plants increased their tolerance to drought and cold stress. Taken together, our results revealed that the transcriptional control of different rice ASR genes exhibit different tissue-dependent sugar and hormone-sensitivities.

Abstract: Summary
The master transcription factor Pparγ regulates the general differentiation program of both brown and white adipocytes. However, it has been unclear whether Pparγ also controls fat lineage-specific characteristics. Here, we show that early B cell factor-2 (Ebf2) regulates Pparγ binding activity to determine brown versus white adipocyte identity. The Ebf DNA-binding motif was highly enriched within brown adipose-specific Pparγ binding sites that we identified by genome-wide ChIP-Seq. Of the Ebf isoforms, Ebf2 was selectively expressed in brown relative to white adipocytes and was bound at brown adipose-specific Pparγ target genes. When expressed in myoblasts or white preadipose cells, Ebf2 recruited Pparγ to its brown-selective binding sites and reprogrammed cells to a brown fat fate. Brown adipose cells and tissue from Ebf2-deficient mice displayed a loss of brown-specific characteristics and thermogenic capacity. Together, these results identify Ebf2 as a key transcriptional regulator of brown fat cell fate and function.

Abstract: Drug repositioning can identify new therapeutic applications for existing drugs, thus mitigating high R&D costs. The Protein kinase 2 (CK2) inhibitor CX-4945 regulates human cancer cell survival and angiogenesis. Here we found that CX-4945 significantly inhibited the RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation, but enhanced the BMP2induced osteoblast differentiation in a cell culture model. CX-4945 inhibited the RANKL-induced activation of TRAP and NFATc1 expression accompanied with suppression of Akt phosphorylation, but, in contrast, it enhanced the BMP2-mediated ALP induction and MAPK ERK1/2 phosphorylation. CX-4945 is thus a novel drug candidate for bone-related disorders such as osteoporosis.

Abstract: Summary
Secretion systems require high-fidelity mechanisms to discriminate substrates among the vast cytoplasmic pool of proteins. Factors mediating substrate recognition by the type VI secretion system (T6SS) of Gram-negative bacteria, a widespread pathway that translocates effector proteins into target bacterial cells, have not been defined. We report that haemolysin coregulated protein (Hcp), a ring-shaped hexamer secreted by all characterized T6SSs, binds specifically to cognate effector molecules. Electron microscopy analysis of an Hcp-effector complex from Pseudomonas aeruginosa revealed the effector bound to the inner surface of Hcp. Further studies demonstrated that interaction with the Hcp pore is a general requirement for secretion of diverse effectors encompassing several enzymatic classes. Though previous models depict Hcp as a static conduit, our data indicate it is a chaperone and receptor of substrates. These unique functions of a secreted protein highlight fundamental differences between the export mechanism of T6 and other characterized secretory pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Lysosomal membrane permeabilization and subsequent cell death may prove useful in cancer treatment, provided that cancer cell lysosomes can be specifically targeted. Here, we identify acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) inhibition as a selective means to destabilize cancer cell lysosomes. Lysosome-destabilizing experimental anticancer agent siramesine inhibits ASM by interfering with the binding of ASM to its essential lysosomal cofactor, bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate. Like siramesine, several clinically relevant ASM inhibitors trigger cancer-specific lysosomal cell death, reduce tumor growth in vivo, and revert multidrug resistance. Their cancer selectivity is associated with transformation-associated reduction in ASM expression and subsequent failure to maintain sphingomyelin hydrolysis during drug exposure. Taken together, these data identify ASM as an attractive target for cancer therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Centromeres are specified by sequence-independent epigenetic mechanisms in most organisms. Rarely, centromere repositioning results in neocentromere formation at ectopic sites. However, the mechanisms governing how and where neocentromeres form are unknown. Here, we established a chromosome-engineering system in chicken DT40 cells that allowed us to efficiently isolate neocentromere-containing chromosomes. Neocentromeres appear to be structurally and functionally equivalent to native centromeres. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis with 18 neocentromeres revealed that the centromere-specific histone H3 variant CENP-A occupies an ∼40 kb region at each neocentromere, which has no preference for specific DNA sequence motifs. Furthermore, we found that neocentromeres were not associated with histone modifications H3K9me3, H3K4me2, and H3K36me3 or with early replication timing. Importantly, low but significant levels of CENP-A are detected around endogenous centromeres, which are capable of seeding neocentromere assembly if the centromere core is removed. In summary, our experimental system provides valuable insights for understanding how neocentromeres form.

Abstract: Summary
The human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family of tyrosine kinases is deregulated in multiple cancers either through amplification, overexpression, or mutation. ERBB3/HER3, the only member with an impaired kinase domain, although amplified or overexpressed in some cancers, has not been reported to carry oncogenic mutations. Here, we report the identification of ERBB3 somatic mutations in ∼11% of colon and gastric cancers. We found that the ERBB3 mutants transformed colonic and breast epithelial cells in a ligand-independent manner. However, the mutant ERBB3 oncogenic activity was dependent on kinase-active ERBB2. Furthermore, we found that anti-ERBB antibodies and small molecule inhibitors effectively blocked mutant ERBB3-mediated oncogenic signaling and disease progression in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
The selective degradation of intracellular components by autophagy involves sequential interactions of the cargo with a receptor, which also binds the autophagosomal protein Atg8 and a scaffold protein. Here, we demonstrated that mutations in C. elegans epg-11, which encodes an arginine methyltransferase homologous to PRMT1, cause the defective removal of PGL-1 and PGL-3 (cargo)-SEPA-1 (receptor) complexes, known as PGL granules, from somatic cells during embryogenesis. Autophagic degradation of the PGL granule scaffold protein EPG-2 and other protein aggregates was unaffected in epg-11/prmt-1 mutants. Loss of epg-11/prmt-1 activity impairs the association of PGL granules with EPG-2 and LGG-1 puncta. EPG-11/PRMT-1 directly methylates arginines in the RGG domains of PGL-1 and PGL-3. Autophagic removal of PGL proteins is impaired when the methylated arginines are mutated. Our study reveals that posttranslational arginine methylation regulates the association of the cargo-receptor complex with the scaffold protein, providing a mechanism for modulating degradation efficiency in selective autophagy.

Abstract: Summary
Messenger RNA (mRNA) export from the nucleus is essential for eukaryotic gene expression. Here we identify a transcript-selective nuclear export mechanism affecting certain human transcripts, enriched for functions in genome duplication and repair, controlled by inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK), an enzyme catalyzing inositol polyphosphate and phosphoinositide turnover. We studied transcripts encoding RAD51, a protein essential for DNA repair by homologous recombination (HR), to characterize the mechanism underlying IPMK-regulated mRNA export. IPMK depletion or catalytic inactivation selectively decreases RAD51 protein abundance and the nuclear export of RAD51 mRNA, thereby impairing HR. Recognition of a sequence motif in the untranslated region of RAD51 transcripts by the mRNA export factor ALY requires IPMK. Phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3), an IPMK product, restores ALY recognition in IPMK-depleted cell extracts, suggesting a mechanism underlying transcript selection. Our findings implicate IPMK in a transcript-selective mRNA export pathway controlled by phosphoinositide turnover that preserves genome integrity in humans.

Abstract: Summary
Sympathetic neurons depend on target-derived neurotrophic cues to control their survival and growth. However, whether sympathetic innervation contributes reciprocally to the development of target tissues is less clear. Here, we report that sympathetic innervation is necessary for the formation of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans and for their functional maturation. Genetic or pharmacological ablation of sympathetic innervation during development resulted in altered islet architecture, reduced insulin secretion, and impaired glucose tolerance in mice. Similar defects were observed with pharmacological blockade of β-adrenergic signaling. Conversely, the administration of a β-adrenergic agonist restored islet morphology and glucose tolerance in deinnervated animals. Furthermore, in neuron-islet cocultures, sympathetic neurons promoted islet cell migration in a β-adrenergic-dependent manner. This study reveals that islet architecture requires extrinsic inductive cues from neighboring tissues such as sympathetic nerves and suggests that early perturbations in sympathetic innervation might underlie metabolic disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy dysfunction has been implicated in misfolded protein accumulation and cellular toxicity in several diseases. Whether alterations in autophagy also contribute to the pathology of lipid-storage disorders is not clear. Here, we show defective autophagy in Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) disease associated with cholesterol accumulation, where the maturation of autophagosomes is impaired because of defective amphisome formation caused by failure in SNARE machinery, whereas the lysosomal proteolytic function remains unaffected. Expression of functional NPC1 protein rescues this defect. Inhibition of autophagy also causes cholesterol accumulation. Compromised autophagy was seen in disease-affected organs of Npc1 mutant mice. Of potential therapeutic relevance is that HP-β-cyclodextrin, which is used for cholesterol-depletion treatment, impedes autophagy, whereas stimulating autophagy restores its function independent of amphisome formation. Our data suggest that a low dose of HP-β-cyclodextrin that does not perturb autophagy, coupled with an autophagy inducer, may provide a rational treatment strategy for NPC1 disease.

Abstract: Summary
The TRPM8 ion channel is expressed in sensory neurons and is responsible for sensing environmental cues, such as cold temperatures and chemical compounds, including menthol and icilin. The channel functional activity is regulated by various physical and chemical factors and is likely to be preconditioned by its molecular composition. Our studies indicate that the TRPM8 channel forms a structural-functional complex with the polyester poly-(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB). We identified by mass spectrometry a number of PHB-modified peptides in the N terminus of the TRPM8 protein and in its extracellular S3-S4 linker. Removal of PHB by enzymatic hydrolysis and site-directed mutagenesis of both the serine residues that serve as covalent anchors for PHB and adjacent hydrophobic residues that interact with the methyl groups of the polymer resulted in significant inhibition of TRPM8 channel activity. We conclude that the TRPM8 channel undergoes posttranslational modification by PHB and that this modification is required for its normal function.

Abstract: Summary
IκB proteins are the primary inhibitors of NF-κB. Here, we demonstrate that sumoylated and phosphorylated IκBα accumulates in the nucleus of keratinocytes and interacts with histones H2A and H4 at the regulatory region of HOX and IRX genes. Chromatin-bound IκBα modulates Polycomb recruitment and imparts their competence to be activated by TNFα. Mutations in the Drosophila IκBα gene cactus enhance the homeotic phenotype of Polycomb mutants, which is not counteracted by mutations in dorsal/NF-κB. Oncogenic transformation of keratinocytes results in cytoplasmic IκBα translocation associated with a massive activation of Hox. Accumulation of cytoplasmic IκBα was found in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) associated with IKK activation and HOX upregulation.

Abstract: Summary
Most human transcription factors bind a small subset of potential genomic sites and often use different subsets in different cell types. To identify mechanisms that govern cell-type-specific transcription factor binding, we used an integrative approach to study estrogen receptor α (ER). We found that ER exhibits two distinct modes of binding. Shared sites, bound in multiple cell types, are characterized by high-affinity estrogen response elements (EREs), inaccessible chromatin, and a lack of DNA methylation, while cell-specific sites are characterized by a lack of EREs, co-occurrence with other transcription factors, and cell-type-specific chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation. These observations enabled accurate quantitative models of ER binding that suggest tethering of ER to one-third of cell-specific sites. The distinct properties of cell-specific binding were also observed with glucocorticoid receptor and for ER in primary mouse tissues, representing an elegant genomic encoding scheme for generating cell-type-specific gene regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Plant viruses often encode suppressors of host RNA silencing machinery, which occasionally function as avirulence factors that are recognized by host resistance (R) proteins. For example, the Arabidopsis R protein, hypersensitive response to TCV (HRT), recognizes the turnip crinkle virus (TCV) coat protein (CP). HRT-mediated resistance requires the RNA-silencing component double-stranded RNA-binding protein 4 (DRB4) even though it neither is associated with the accumulation of TCV-specific small RNA nor requires the RNA silencing suppressor function of CP. HRT interacts with the cytosolic fraction of DRB4. Interestingly, TCV infection both increases the cytosolic DRB4 pool and inhibits the HRT-DRB4 interaction. The virulent R8A CP derivative, which induces a subset of HRT-derived responses, also disrupts this interaction. The differential localization of DRB4 in the presence of wild-type and R8A CP implies the importance of subcellular compartmentalization of DRB4. The requirement of DRB4 in resistance to bacterial infection suggests a universal role in R-mediated defense signaling.

Abstract: Reagents which can promote the proliferation, adhesion and migration of cultured corneal endothelial cells (CECs) will be helpful for the treatment of reduced visual acuity due to CECs deficiency. The objectives of this study were to investigate the potential use of an inhibitor of Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), Y-27632, to cultured bovine corneal endothelial cells (B-CECs) and evaluated its effects on the proliferation, adhesion and migration of B-CECs. The proliferation of cultured B-CECs was moderately enhanced by 10μM Y-27632. Y-27632 induced fibroblast-like morphological changes in the cultured B-CECs and normal cell morphology could recover after Y-27632 removal. In addition, Y-27632 was found to significantly enhance the adhesion and migration of B-CECs. Furthermore, the hanging drop aggregation assay showed that Y-27632 promoted B-CECs to form cellular networks and sheets, which proliferated along the liquid–air interface and migrated to the surface of the lid of dish. Our study demonstrated that Y-27632 is a potentially powerful reagent which can enhance the proliferation of cultured B-CECs. Y-27632 will be useful in CEC injection therapy and topical application for CEC deficiency.

Abstract: Summary
Members of the SH2 domain family modulate signal transduction by binding to short peptides containing phosphorylated tyrosines. Each domain displays a distinct preference for the sequence context of the phosphorylated residue. We have developed a high-density peptide chip technology that allows for probing of the affinity of most SH2 domains for a large fraction of the entire complement of tyrosine phosphopeptides in the human proteome. Using this technique, we have experimentally identified thousands of putative SH2-peptide interactions for more than 70 different SH2 domains. By integrating this rich data set with orthogonal context-specific information, we have assembled an SH2-mediated probabilistic interaction network, which we make available as a community resource in the PepspotDB database. A predicted dynamic interaction between the SH2 domains of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 and the phosphorylated tyrosine in the extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation loop was validated by experiments in living cells.

Abstract: Summary
The ureteric bud is an epithelial tube that undergoes branching morphogenesis to form the renal collecting system. Although development of a normal kidney depends on proper ureteric bud morphogenesis, the cellular events underlying this process remain obscure. Here, we used time-lapse microscopy together with several genetic labeling methods to observe ureteric bud cell behaviors in developing mouse kidneys. We observed an unexpected cell behavior in the branching tips of the ureteric bud, which we term “mitosis-associated cell dispersal.” Premitotic ureteric tip cells delaminate from the epithelium and divide within the lumen; although one daughter cell retains a basal process, allowing it to reinsert into the epithelium at the site of origin, the other daughter cell reinserts at a position one to three cell diameters away. Given the high rate of cell division in ureteric tips, this cellular behavior causes extensive epithelial cell rearrangements that may contribute to renal branching morphogenesis.

Abstract: As an important cell model, luteal cells are used to study the reproductive cycle and pregnancy maintenance, but there has not yet had a simple and economical method in purifing goat luteal cells. In order to find a good method to isolate and purify the luteal cells from the Guan Zhong dairy goat corpus luteua, we compared the purification efficiency of Percoll density gradient centrifugation method with that of the differential detachment method using trypsin. After using these two methods for isolation, the purified cells were identified by staining for 3β-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase activity. Cell diameter measurements and cell counting were used to categorize isolated cells from both methods. Cell proliferation activity of purified cells from both methods were studied by Cell Counting Kit-8 for 8 days. The results showed that, after Percoll discontinuous density gradient centrifugation, the purity of luteal cells was 98.2±1.2% in Percoll density layer of 30–40%. In comparison, the purity of luteal cells isolated in differential detachment by trypsin was 74.3±1.8%. Luteal cells purified from both methods stained positive for 3β-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase activity, and cells purified by Percoll centrifugation showed a more rapid cell proliferation rate than cells purified by trypsin. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that Percoll density gradient centrifugation was superior to the method of differential detachment in cell purification efficiency and in maintenance of cell proliferation activity.

Abstract: Summary
The mitosis-specific phosphorylation of histone H3 at Thr3 (H3T3ph) plays an important role in chromosome segregation by recruiting Aurora B. H3T3 phosphorylation is catalyzed by Haspin, an atypical protein kinase whose kinase domain is intrinsically active without phosphorylation at the activation loop. Here, we report the molecular basis for Haspin inhibition during interphase and its reactivation in M phase. We identify a conserved basic segment that autoinhibits Haspin during interphase. This autoinhibition is neutralized when Cdk1 phosphorylates the N terminus of Haspin in order to recruit Polo-like kinase (Plk1/Plx1), which, in turn, further phosphorylates multiple sites at the Haspin N terminus. Although Plx1, and not Aurora B, is critical for H3T3 phosphorylation in Xenopus egg extracts, Plk1 and Aurora B both promote this modification in human cells. Thus, M phase-specific H3T3 phosphorylation is governed by the combinatorial action of mitotic kinases that neutralizes Haspin autoinhibition through a mechanism dependent on multisite phosphorylation.

Abstract: Summary
In mouse and human neural progenitor and glioblastoma “stem-like” cells, we identified key targets of the Polycomb-group protein BMI1 by combining ChIP-seq with in vivo RNAi screening. We discovered that Bmi1 is important in the cellular response to the transforming growth factor-β/bone morphogenetic protein (TGF-β/BMP) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathways, in part converging on the Atf3 transcriptional repressor. We show that Atf3 is a tumor-suppressor gene inactivated in human glioblastoma multiforme together with Cbx7 and a few other candidates. Acting downstream of the ER stress and BMP pathways, ATF3 binds to cell-type-specific accessible chromatin preloaded with AP1 and participates in the inhibition of critical oncogenic networks. Our data support the feasibility of combining ChIP-seq and RNAi screens in solid tumors and highlight multiple p16INK4a/p19ARF-independent functions for Bmi1 in development and cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Metazoan gene expression is often regulated after the recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to promoters, through the controlled release of promoter-proximally paused Pol II into productive RNA synthesis. Despite the prevalence of paused Pol II, very little is known about the dynamics of these early elongation complexes or the fate of the short transcription start site-associated (tss) RNAs they produce. Here, we demonstrate that paused elongation complexes can be remarkably stable, with half-lives exceeding 15 min at genes with inefficient pause release. Promoter-proximal termination by Pol II is infrequent, and released tssRNAs are targeted for rapid degradation. Further, we provide evidence that the predominant tssRNA species observed are nascent RNAs held within early elongation complexes. We propose that stable pausing of polymerase provides a temporal window of opportunity for recruitment of factors to modulate gene expression and that the nascent tssRNA represents an appealing target for these interactions.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) emerge during embryogenesis from hemogenic endothelium, but it remains unclear how the HSC lineage is initially established from mesoderm during ontogeny. In Xenopus, the definitive hemangioblast precursors of the HSC lineage have been identified in dorsal lateral plate (DLP) mesoderm, and a transcriptional gene regulatory network (GRN) controlling hemangioblast programming has been elucidated. Herein, we identify an essential role for microRNAs (miRNAs) in establishing the mesodermal lineage leading to both HSC emergence and vasculogenesis and determine that a single miRNA, miR-142-3p, is primarily responsible for initiation of definitive hemangioblast specification. miR-142-3p forms a double-negative gate unlocking entry into the hemangioblast program, in part by inhibiting TGFβ signaling. Our results table miR-142-3p as a master regulator of HSC lineage specification, sitting at the apex of the hierarchy programming the adult hemangioblast, thus illustrating that miRNAs can act as instructive determinants of cell fate during development.

Abstract: Summary
Schwann cells are highly plastic cells that dedifferentiate to a progenitor-like state following injury. However, deregulation of this plasticity, may be involved in the formation of neurofibromas, mixed-cell tumors of Schwann cell (SC) origin that arise upon loss of NF1. Here, we show that adult myelinating SCs (mSCs) are refractory to Nf1 loss. However, in the context of injury, Nf1-deficient cells display opposing behaviors along the wounded nerve; distal to the injury, Nf1−/− mSCs redifferentiate normally, whereas at the wound site Nf1−/− mSCs give rise to neurofibromas in both Nf1+/+ and Nf1+/− backgrounds. Tracing experiments showed that distinct cell types within the tumor derive from Nf1-deficient SCs. This model of neurofibroma formation demonstrates that neurofibromas can originate from adult SCs and that the nerve environment can switch from tumor suppressive to tumor promoting at a site of injury. These findings have implications for both the characterization and treatment of neurofibromas.

Abstract: Summary
Patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and Costello syndrome Rasopathy have behavioral deficits. In NF1 patients, these may correlate with white matter enlargement and aberrant myelin. To model these features, we induced Nf1 loss or HRas hyperactivation in mouse oligodendrocytes. Enlarged brain white matter tracts correlated with myelin decompaction, downregulation of claudin-11, and mislocalization of connexin-32. Surprisingly, non-cell-autonomous defects in perivascular astrocytes and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) developed, implicating a soluble mediator. Nitric oxide (NO) can disrupt tight junctions and gap junctions, and NO and NO synthases (NOS1–NOS3) were upregulated in mutant white matter. Treating mice with the NOS inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester or the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine corrected cellular phenotypes. CNP-HRasG12V mice also displayed locomotor hyperactivity, which could be rescued by antioxidant treatment. We conclude that Nf1/Ras regulates oligodendrocyte NOS and that dysregulated NO signaling in oligodendrocytes can alter the surrounding vasculature. The data suggest that antioxidants may improve some behavioral deficits in Rasopathy patients.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian pain-related sensory neurons are derived from TrkA lineage neurons located in the dorsal root ganglion. These neurons project to peripheral targets throughout the body, which can be divided into superficial and deep tissues. Here, we find that the transcription factor Runx1 is required for the development of many epidermis-projecting TrkA lineage neurons. Accordingly, knockout of Runx1 leads to the selective loss of sensory innervation to the epidermis, whereas deep tissue innervation and two types of deep tissue pain are unaffected. Within these cutaneous neurons, Runx1 suppresses a large molecular program normally associated with sensory neurons that innervate deep tissues, such as muscle and visceral organs. Ectopic expression of Runx1 in these deep sensory neurons causes a loss of this molecular program and marked deficits in deep tissue pain. Thus, this study provides insight into a genetic program controlling the segregation of cutaneous versus deep tissue pain pathways.

Abstract: Summary
FOXO transcription factors are central regulators of longevity from worms to humans. FOXO3, the FOXO isoform associated with exceptional human longevity, preserves adult neural stem cell pools. Here, we identify FOXO3 direct targets genome-wide in primary cultures of adult neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Interestingly, FOXO3-bound sites are enriched for motifs for bHLH transcription factors, and FOXO3 shares common targets with the proneuronal bHLH transcription factor ASCL1/MASH1 in NPCs. Analysis of the chromatin landscape reveals that FOXO3 and ASCL1 are particularly enriched at the enhancers of genes involved in neurogenic pathways. Intriguingly, FOXO3 inhibits ASCL1-dependent neurogenesis in NPCs and direct neuronal conversion in fibroblasts. FOXO3 also restrains neurogenesis in vivo. Our study identifies a genome-wide interaction between the prolongevity transcription factor FOXO3 and the cell-fate determinant ASCL1 and raises the possibility that FOXO3’s ability to restrain ASCL1-dependent neurogenesis may help preserve the neural stem cell pool.

Abstract: Summary
The multilayered epidermis is established through a stratification program, which is accompanied by a shift from symmetric toward asymmetric divisions (ACD), a process under tight control of the transcription factor p63. However, the physiological signals regulating p63 activity in epidermal morphogenesis remain ill defined. Here, we reveal a role for insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) in the regulation of p63 activity. Loss of epidermal IIS leads to a biased loss of ACD, resulting in impaired stratification. Upon loss of IIS, FoxO transcription factors are retained in the nucleus, where they bind and inhibit p63-regulated transcription. This is reversed by small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of FoxOs. Accordingly, transgenic expression of a constitutive nuclear FoxO variant in the epidermis abrogates ACD and inhibits p63-regulated transcription and stratification. Collectively, the present study reveals a critical role for IIS-dependent control of p63 activity in coordination of ACD and stratification during epithelial morphogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Protein aggregates are a common feature of neurodegenerative syndromes. Specific protein fragments were found to be aggregated in disorders including Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinson’s disease. Here, we show that the natural C-terminal fragments of Tau, TDP43, and α-synuclein are short-lived substrates of the Arg/N-end rule pathway, a processive proteolytic system that targets proteins bearing “destabilizing” N-terminal residues. Furthermore, a natural TDP43 fragment is shown to be metabolically stabilized in Ate1−/− fibroblasts that lack the arginylation branch of the Arg/N-end rule pathway, leading to accumulation and aggregation of this fragment. We also found that a fraction of Aβ42, the Alzheimer’s disease-associated fragment of APP, is N-terminally arginylated in the brains of 5xFAD mice and is degraded by the Arg/N-end rule pathway. The discovery that neurodegeneration-associated natural fragments of TDP43, Tau, α-synuclein, and APP can be selectively destroyed by the Arg/N-end rule pathway suggests that this pathway counteracts neurodegeneration.

Abstract: Summary
The BRCT-domain protein Rad4TopBP1 facilitates activation of the DNA damage checkpoint in Schizosaccharomyces pombe by physically coupling the Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 clamp, the Rad3ATR -Rad26ATRIP kinase complex, and the Crb253BP1 mediator. We have now determined crystal structures of the BRCT repeats of Rad4TopBP1, revealing a distinctive domain architecture, and characterized their phosphorylation-dependent interactions with Rad9 and Crb253BP1. We identify a cluster of phosphorylation sites in the N-terminal region of Crb253BP1 that mediate interaction with Rad4TopBP1 and reveal a hierarchical phosphorylation mechanism in which phosphorylation of Crb253BP1 residues Thr215 and Thr235 promotes phosphorylation of the noncanonical Thr187 site by scaffolding cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) recruitment. Finally, we show that the simultaneous interaction of a single Rad4TopBP1 molecule with both Thr187 phosphorylation sites in a Crb253BP1 dimer is essential for establishing the DNA damage checkpoint.
