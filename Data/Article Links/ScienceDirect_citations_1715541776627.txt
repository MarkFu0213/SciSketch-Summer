Abstract: In this study, we disclose the utilization of the conducting homopolymer and copolymers based on 4-(2,5-di-thiophen-2-yl-pyrrol-1-yl)–N-(ferrocenyl methyl)-phenylamine (SNS-An-Fc) and 1-(2-ethyl-hexyl)-2,5-di-thiophen-2-yl-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrole (SNS-HE) in electrochromic devices (ECDs). For this purpose, four different dual type, complementary colored devices were assembled in glass/ITO/poly(SNS-R)/PEDOT/ITO/glass configuration. Electrochromic properties of all devices were investigated by spectroelectrochemistry, switching, coloration efficiency, open circuit, stability studies and colorimetry measurements. When compared with the alkyl functionalized analog, tethering of ferrocene group on to polymer chain was found out to be an effective strategy to enhance coloration efficiency. Generally, the switching speeds and stability of ECDs having copolymers as their active layer were found to better than the devices of corresponding homopolymers. On the other hand devices assembled with homopolymers exhibited superior optical memory. Our studies indicate that all the ECDs have good redox stability, esthetically pleasing colors and they could be operated between 0.0V and 1.2V.

Abstract: In order to improve the energy utilization efficiency during heat charging and discharging processes, thermal conductivity enhancement of polyethylene glycol (PEG)/SiO2 hybrid form-stable phase change material (PCM) was achieved by in situ Cu doping via in situ chemical reduction of CuSO4 through ultrasound-assisted sol–gel process. This method would be an important approach to develop novel hybrid form-stable PCM with high thermal conductivity due to the mild preparation conditions. The XPS result of this material showed that the valence state of copper in PEG6000/SiO2 PCM was mainly zero. The FTIR demonstrated that there was no new chemical bond between Cu, PEG6000 and SiO2. The thermal properties and thermal stability of the composite PCM were confirmed using DSC and TGA analyses. The phase change enthalpy of Cu/PEG/SiO2 PCM reached up to 110J/g, and the thermal conductivity was 0.414W/(mK) for 2.1wt% Cu in PEG/SiO2, which was enhanced by 38.1% compared to pure PEG. The Cu/PEG/SiO2 hybrid material had excellent thermal stability and good form-stable performance.

Abstract: Peroxiredoxin 2 has immune regulatory functions, but its expression in human peripheral blood lymphocytes and levels in extracellular fluid in healthy subjects and rheumatoid arthritis patients are poorly described. In the present study, the median intracellular peroxiredoxin 2 protein content of lymphocytes from rheumatoid arthritis patients was more than two-fold higher compared with healthy subjects’ lymphocytes. Intracellular peroxiredoxin 3 levels were similar in healthy and rheumatoid arthritis lymphocytes. Flow cytometry detected peroxiredoxin 2 on the surface of ca. 8% of T cells and ca. 56% of B cells (median % values) of all subjects analyzed. Exofacial thioredoxin-1 was also observed. In the total lymphocyte population from rheumatoid arthritis patients, few cells (median, 6%) displayed surface peroxiredoxin 2. In contrast, a significantly increased proportion of interleukin-17+ve lymphocytes were exofacially peroxiredoxin 2+ve (median, 39%). Prdx2 was also detected in human extracellular fluids. We suggest that crucial inflammatory cell subsets, i.e. interleukin-17+ve T cells, exhibit increased exofacial redox-regulating enzymes and that peroxiredoxin 2 may be involved in the persistence of pro-inflammatory cells in chronic inflammation.

Abstract: We report on the characteristics of GeO2-doped In2O3 (IGO) films for use as transparent electrodes in organic solar cells (OSCs). The electrical, optical, and structural properties of IGO electrodes were investigated as a function of RF power and post-annealing conditions. At optimized conditions, the IGO electrode exhibited a low sheet resistance of 14.0Ω/square, a high optical transmittance of 86.9%, a root mean square roughness of 1.27nm and a work function of 5.2eV. In particular, the IGO film showed higher optical transmittance in the near-infrared region due to a lower free carrier concentration and higher mobility than conventional ITO electrodes. The higher Lewis acid strength of the Ge4+ (3.06) dopant, compared to that of a Sn4+ (1.62) dopant, led to higher mobility of the IGO films. In addition, we observed that the strongly oriented (222) grains in the IGO films enhanced carrier mobility and relaxation time. Furthermore, a bulk heterojunction OSC with the optimized IGO anode exhibited a good cell performance with a fill factor of 67.38%, a short circuit current of 8.438mA/cm2, an open circuit voltage of 0.606V, and a power conversion efficiency of 3.443%, which are comparable to OSCs with ITO anodes.

Abstract: The A chain of the plant toxin ricin (RTA) is an N-glycosidase that inhibits protein synthesis by removing a specific adenine from the 28S rRNA. RTA also induces ribotoxic stress, which activates stress-induced cell signaling cascades and apoptosis. However, the mechanistic relationship between depurination, protein synthesis inhibition and apoptosis remains an open question. We previously identified two RTA mutants that suggested partial independence of these processes in a yeast model. The goals of this study were to establish an endogenous RTA expression system in mammalian cells and utilize RTA mutants to examine the relationship between depurination, protein synthesis inhibition, cell signaling and apoptosis in mammalian cells. The non-transformed epithelial cell line MAC-T was transiently transfected with plasmid vectors encoding precursor (pre) or mature forms of wild-type (WT) RTA or mutants. PreRTA was glycosylated indicating that the native signal peptide targeted RTA to the ER in mammalian cells. Mature RTA was not glycosylated and thus served as a control to detect changes in catalytic activity. Both pre- and mature WT RTA induced ribosome depurination, protein synthesis inhibition, activation of cell signaling and apoptosis. Analysis of RTA mutants showed for the first time that depurination can be reduced by 40% in mammalian cells with minimal effects on inhibition of protein synthesis, activation of cell signaling and apoptosis. We further show that protein synthesis inhibition by RTA correlates more linearly with apoptosis than ribosome depurination.

Abstract: An approved measurement method for evaluating space charge region recombination (SCR-recombination) induced by the screen printed front side metallization is applied for industrial solar cells with aluminum back surface field (Al-BSF) on monocrystalline Czochralski silicon (Cz-Si). The H-patterned base grid of all processed solar cells is screen printed with a commercially available front side silver paste, ensuring sufficiently good contacting and therefore good electrical performance of the solar cells. Additionally, irregular contact fingers are realized between the regular contact fingers of the base grid by applying different screen printing layouts with commercially available front side pastes to increase the front side metallization fraction linearly as well as by applying various test pastes for the layout with the highest metallization fraction. Well-known components of glass frits as lead oxide, zinc oxide, bismuth oxide and boron oxide can affect SCR-recombination. Therefore we fabricated test pastes with these specific paste/glass frit components. By applying this test structure, a comparable qualitative evaluation of SCR-recombination with respect to the specific paste component is demonstrated. Quantitative evaluations regarding the electrical performance of the solar cells as well as related microstructural investigations are presented.

Abstract: In this report, we demonstrate a new type of hybrid solar cell based on a heterojunction between the vertically aligned GaAs nanowires and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) with incorporating poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) electron blocking layer. Under 1 sun simulated AM1.5 G solar illumination, the fabricated cell exhibits the power conversion efficiency of 9.2%. The fabrication of GaAs nanowire array adopts the top-down approach, which combines the low-cost monolayer nanosphere mask fabrication and the dry etching process with high quality single-crystalline GaAs wafer. The P3HT/GaAs heterojunction with a large conduction band offset will block the electron transportation from GaAs to PEDOT:PSS. Therefore, the electron transports toward the favorable Ti/Au electrode. Moreover, it is observed that the thickness of P3HT significantly influences the cell performance. Only the ultra-thin thickness is suitable for P3HT to act as an electron blocking layer without the negative influences on the cell performance.

Abstract: Dendritic cells (DC) are sentinels of the immune system deriving from circulating monocyte precursors recruited to sites of inflammation. In a previous report (Del Prete et al., 2008) we showed that, after differentiation, DC exhibited increased number of condensed mitochondria and dynamic changes in their energy metabolism. A study is presented here showing that the DC differentiation process is characterized by increased expression level and activity of mitochondrial respiratory complexes, as well as by an increased mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number. Moreover, DC are equipped with more efficient antioxidant protection systems, over expressed most likely to detoxify increased ROS production, as a consequence of the much higher mitochondrial activity. Kinetic analysis of the three main mitochondrial biogenesis-associated genes revealed that the peak in PPARγ coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1α) gene expression was suddenly reached few hours after the onset of the differentiation. While PGC-1α expression rapidly declines, the mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) and nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1) expression gradually increased. These findings demonstrate that an active mitochondrial biogenesis occurs during DC differentiation and further suggest that an early input by the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis PGC-1α is needed to trigger the subsequent activation of the downstream transcription factors, NRF-1 and TFAM in this process.

Abstract: The Essential Macleod Program (EMP) has been used to successfully assist in the design of a SiO2 protected Ag thin film. The film is applied through magnetron sputtering onto a glass substrate for use in a solar front reflector. In the following experiments, Ag films were first deposited on glass substrates using direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering, and then SiO2 films were deposited as a protective layer onto the surface of the Ag films using radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering. The reflectivity of the obtained samples was calculated and tested under light wavelengths ranging from 250 to 2500nm with films of Ag and SiO2 of different thicknesses. The solar reflectivity (SR) and the light reflectivity (LR) of the 130nm Ag film and the 320nm SiO2 film were found to be up to 96.66% and 98.84%, respectively, which is almost identical to the calculated results based on the designed model. Additionally, the deposited films exhibited high anti-corrosion properties in harsh abrasion and aging resistance tests. More importantly, the films were proven capable of operating in high-temperature systems by testing under different annealing temperatures. The high performance of the films was attributed primarily to the SiO2 layer, which served as a good means of protection without experiencing serious degradation of reflectivity, demonstrating their potential in applications for solar front reflectors.

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel characterization technique for the analysis of Si surface passivation layers, using a photoluminescence imaging setup. In this technique the effective lifetime of passivated Si wafers is measured while applying an external bias over a rear side dielectric film. We demonstrate that this method can be used to analyze the passivation of silicon surfaces in inversion, depletion and accumulation conditions. In this paper the method is illustrated by characterization of a-SiNx:H passivation layers deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition. The characterization results are interpreted both in the framework of the extended Shockley–Read–Hall theory and by PC1D simulations. For the a-SiNx:H layers, the effective surface recombination velocity parameter is found to be 5 to 7 times larger for electrons than for holes and the fixed insulator charge density is found to be 6.1−6.5×1011cm−2 under illumination, in agreement with results from capacitance–voltage measurements.

Abstract: We propose a novel transparent electrode consisting of silver (Ag)–aluminum doped zinc oxide (AZO)–nickel (Ni) deposited at room temperature on glass and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) for flexible organic photovoltaics. The electrode combines the high electrical conductivity and mechanical ductility of Ag, the transparency and antireflection of AZO and the high work function and stability of Ni. Environmental stability results confirmed that the electrode maintains its optical and electrical properties at both elevated temperature (500°C) and under damp heat conditions (85°C and 85% relative humidity). To demonstrate its functional potential, the electrode has been used as the transparent anode in an organic solar cell (OSC), which shows an efficiency of 2.6%, very close to the value (2.9%) obtained in a similar cell using the widely used indium tin oxide (ITO). With respect to ITO, the proposed transparent electrode has several advantages, including mechanical flexibility, room temperature processing and low cost.

Abstract: We investigate the relationship between processing parameters and the device performance of gravure printed organic solar cells. Ink viscosity, surface energy and surface roughness are studied to optimise the printing process. Surfactants, additives and surface modification by plasma cleaning are utilised to achieve homogeneous printing of multilayer OPV device architectures. It is found that use of high boiling point solvents with high solubilities leads to a desirable surface morphology. The use of a printed metal oxide electrode within the inverted structure leads to devices with lifetimes exceeding those of devices in standard structures without the need for encapsulation.

LRP6 mediates Wnt/β-catenin signaling and regulates adipogenic differentiation in human mesenchymal stem cells,

Abstract: Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) are subjected to the control of several signal transduction pathways during regeneration processes, whereby Wnt/β-catenin signaling is of pivotal importance. Since there exists only fragmentary knowledge concerning the molecular function of the Wnt-coreceptors LRP5 and LRP6 (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein) in hMSC, we studied their impact on Wnt/β-catenin signal transduction by RNA interference. For monitoring changes in β-catenin-dependent transcription in a highly sensitive and specific manner, hMSC were stably transfected with a TCF/LEF reporter gene plasmid. In the presence of the activator Wnt3a, knockdown of LRP6 led to a strong decreased Wnt/β-catenin signaling, while RNAi against LRP5 exhibited no effect in this setting. In a reverse approach, ectopic expression of LRP6 resulted in a strong enhancement of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, whereas overexpression of LRP5 exhibited no increased signaling capacity. Furthermore, only the ectopic expression of LRP6 – but not that of LRP5 – was able to restore Wnt3a-mediated β-catenin signaling after knockdown of endogenously expressed LRP6. These results demonstrate LRP6 as the predominant Wnt3a LRP-receptor in hMSC, which cannot be substituted by LRP5. In addition, we observed enhanced differentiation toward the adipogenic lineage after RNAi against LRP6 which was associated with the induction of PPAR-γ and fat vacuole formation. Thus, LRP6 is not only indispensable for Wnt3a/β-catenin signaling, but also for the suppression of differentiation of hMSC into the adipogenic lineage. Based on these observations, LRP6 may represent an attractive drug target for manipulating hMSC in cell and tissue regeneration approaches.

Abstract: In this paper we address the fundamental challenge of forming an efficient contact between the p-type a-Si:H layer and n-type TCO's as contact layers in amorphous/crystalline silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells. We point out the capability of Suns-Voc measurements to give valuable insights into the formation of Schottky barriers and its influence on the solar cell fill factor FF. The influence of the a-Si:H(p) doping on the Schottky characteristic is shown for test structures and on device level. Test structures are used to probe the influence of various contact layers on the effective work function at the a-Si:H/contact layer interface. A very good correlation between the vacuum work function of different contact layers and the open-circuit voltage is observed for test structures. Therefore, we could demonstrate the work function mismatch between a-Si:H and ITO and a-Si:H and various metals as contact layers. For small area n-type silicon solar cells featuring an a-Si:H(p) rear emitter and a diffused front surface field (FSF), it is shown that by improving the carrier transport between the a-Si:H(p) and the contacting layer, ITO(n) or metal, FF above 80% can be obtained. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a TCO is not mandatory for the rear SHJ emitter, which simplifies the cell structure and allows for proper junction engineering. We obtained high internal rear side reflection with a single metal layer and an efficiency of 22.8% for these TCO-less SHJ emitter solar cells. As these solar cells feature FF of up to 81.5%, they clearly demonstrate the high FF potential of the silicon heterojunction which can be achieved by proper junction engineering.

Abstract: Iron-induced oxidative stress is thought to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Our previous studies demonstrated that decreased expression of ferroportin 1 contributes to 6-hydroxydopamine induced intracellular iron accumulation and that decreased ferroportin 1 expression is caused by increased expression of iron regulatory protein 1. Iron regulatory protein 1 is a central regulator of iron homeostasis and is a likely target of extracellular agents to program changes in cellular iron metabolism. Therefore, the mechanism of iron regulatory protein 1 upregulation induced by 6-hydroxydopamine has become a significant focus of research. Iron regulatory protein 1 is regulated by protein kinase C, although this regulation is tissue specific. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to determine whether alteration of protein kinase C activity modified iron regulatory protein 1 expression in the dopaminergic MES23.5 cell line, Furthermore, we investigated whether 6-hydroxydopamine induced iron regulatory protein 1 upregulation is mediated by protein kinase C, thus achieving regulation of cellular iron levels. The results showed that iron regulatory protein 1 was upregulated by phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate, the PKC activator in dopaminergic MES23.5 cells, and ferroportin 1 expression and iron efflux were decreased as a result of iron regulatory protein 1 upregulation. The protein kinase C inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I hydrochloride abolished the effect of phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate. Protein kinase C-δ and protein kinase C-ζ, but not protein kinase C-ɛ were activated by 6-hydroxydopamine. The protein kinase C-δ inhibitor rottlerin inhibited protein kinase C-δ phosphorylation and abolished iron regulatory protein 1 upregulation induced by 6-hydroxydopamine. The protein kinase C-ζ pseudo-substrate inhibitor inhibited protein kinase C-ζ phosphorylation and abolished iron regulatory protein 1 upregulation induced by 6-hydroxydopamine. These data indicate that iron regulatory protein 1 is regulated by protein kinase C in dopaminergic MES23.5 cells and that protein kinase C activated by 6-hydroxydopamine regulates iron regulatory protein 1 expression, thus achieving regulation of cellular iron levels.

Abstract: We investigate the artificial aging of PV modules interconnected with the aluminum-based mechanical and electrical laser interconnection (AMELI) process. AMELI forms a laser welded connection between the Al-metallization on the rear side of the solar cell and an Al-layer on an interconnector substrate. AMELI avoids soldering, conductive adhesives, and Ag-pastes. We investigate glass and encapsulant films as possible interconnector substrates that carry an Al-film. Modules processed with high temperature-deposited aluminum on the cells and an encapsulant as interconnector substrate do not degrade during 200 humidity-freeze cycles. The conversion efficiency η, the fill factor FF, the open circuit voltage Voc, and the short circuit current Isc are unaffected by the artificial aging within an accuracy of 1%.

Abstract: We demonstrate experimentally that an appropriate combination of the layer thicknesses in an inverted P3HT:PCBM cell leads to an optical interference such that the EQE amounts to 91% of IQE. We observe that reflectivity between layers is minimized in a wavelength range of more than 100nm. In that range the EQE closely matches the IQE. The role played by the optical interference in improving the performance of the fabricated solar cells is confirmed by EQE calculated numerically using a model based on the transfer matrix method. Additionally, we observed that a similar cell with an active material 1.7 times thicker exhibited a lower PCE. The poor photon harvesting in the later cell configuration is attributed to an EQE that amounts only to 72% of the IQE.

Abstract: Mitochondrial dynamics, specifically fusion and fission processes, maintain mitochondria integrity and function, yet at this time, effect of estrogens on fusion and fission in breast cancer cell lines has not been studied. The aim of this study was to characterize the effect of 17β-estradiol on fusion and fission-related genes, as well as on mitochondria proliferation and function. We used MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, which is estrogen sensitive (estrogen receptor positive). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum and treated with 1nM of 17β-estradiol and with/without 100nM of ICI 182,780, a drug that caused rapid degradation of estrogen receptor. mRNA levels of fusion (mfn1, mfn2, opa1) and fission-related genes (drp1 and fis1) were examined by RT-PCR, cardiolipin content by N-acridyl-orange fluorescence and oxidative phosphorylation protein levels, as well as, the major fusion and fission related protein levels, by Western blot. mRNA expression of fusion-related genes increased after 17β-estradiol-treatment for 4h; however fis1 fission-related gene expression decreased. All these effects were not found in cells pre-treated with ICI 182,780, save for the changes in mfn-1, conferring them the effects of 17β-estradiol to estrogen receptor. The changes in protein levels were less prominent, but in the same way, than in mRNA levels, showing an increase in Mfn1 and Mfn2, as well as in Drp1, but there was no change in Fis1 protein levels. Mitochondrial biogenesis was also affected by 17β-estradiol, showing an increase in mtDNA but with no change in N-acridyl-orange fluorescence. On the whole, our results suggest an imbalance in the fusion/fission ratio, with a high fusion by 17β-estradiol-estrogen receptor action, which can affect to mitochondrial biogenesis, concretely in mitochondria proliferation. According to this information, 17β-estradiol would modify mitochondrial dynamics, biogenesis and metabolism, and thus compromise the normal development and function of mitochondria in cancer affected tissues.

Abstract: Alternative low cost materials are evaluated through the valorization of by-products derived from mining and metallurgical industry for solid sensible heat based energy storage systems. They were used either as received or formulated as aggregates in mortars, and their thermal and mechanical properties were characterized. A selection methodology was applied in order to compare them with available materials found in the literature for applications as (STES) materials, and with materials from Cambridge Educational Software (CES) Selector database. It was demonstrated that these recycled materials have a high potential for these thermal energy storage applications.

Abstract: Hydrogenation of silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4) to trichlorosilane (SiHCl3) using carbon-based catalysts is studied. The results show that surface functional groups that result from the defect sites of the carbon catalysts play an important role in producing SiHCl3. Because the metal−carbon composites obtained by treating sucrose and transition metals at high temperature in the N2 flow have more defect sites, they display an increased SiHCl3 yield. Elemental analysis of the catalyst and reaction results demonstrate that there is a very good correlation between the SiHCl3 yield and the amount of deposited silicon during the induction time, and the SiHCl3 yield and the accumulated amount of deposited Si species rapidly change initially and then reach a stable value. Hydrogenation of SiCl4 to SiHCl3 in metal-grade silicon (mg−Si) powder is known to give a higher equilibrium conversion of SiCl4. In a similar way, by introducing Si powder into the catalyst bed, a higher SiHCl3 yield can be obtained. It is important to retard the reverse reaction rate of HCl and SiHCl3 to increase the SiHCl3 yield; therefore, the HCl concentration in the product stream should be reduced as soon as it is formed on the catalyst surface during the hydrogenation of SiCl4. Consequently, the Si-doped metal−carbon composite catalyst shows a higher SiHCl3 yield than that of the physically-mixed catalyst and mg−Si powder. These results offer a quite promising potential for developing a stable and effective SiCl4 hydrogenation catalyst and can promote a deeper understanding of this important poly-Si industry reaction.

Abstract: The recently published quinoxaline/thiophene-based polymer TQ1 has been modified on its acceptor unit, either altering the acceptor strength by incorporating a pyridopyrazine, substitution of the acceptor-hydrogens by fluorine, or substitution of the alkoxy side chain by alkyl. The changes in physical, electronic and device properties are discussed. For the polymers incorporating the stronger acceptors a decreased performance is found, where in both cases the current in the devices is compromised. Incorporation of the pyridopyrazine-based acceptor seems to result in more severe or additional loss mechanisms compared to the polymer that incorporates the fluorine atoms. A similar performing material is obtained when changing the alkoxy side chain in TQ1 to an alkyl, where the solar cell performance is mainly improved on the fill factor. It is demonstrated that the standard TQ1 structure is easily modified in a number of ways, showing the versatility and robustness of the standard TQ1 structure and synthesis.

Abstract: Organic photovoltaics (PVs) are a rapidly emerging technology that has the potential to provide low-cost power for many different applications. The TEEOS model had previously been developed to determine various financial indicators for this technology. This paper modifies TEEOS in order to better analyze the effects of variability in the inputs. This modified TEEOS incorporates a mean-reverting jump diffusion model to simulate synthetic electricity price and a modified rainfall occurrence model to simulate a weather series. As well, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) is used as an input in order to gain insight on using low band gap polymers or enhancing the existing EQE. The power production NPV of three example cells, a Si-based solar cell, dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) and an organic solar cell (OSC), are first examined using a 25-year time period where the DSSC and OSC have to be replaced five times due to low lifetimes. The DSSC and OSC are also compared using five years of actual data using a five-year horizon. The sensitivity analysis looks specifically at inherent increases in the electricity price, the correlation of electricity prices and weather, modeling electricity without jumps, as well as enhancing and expanding the EQE. The best option for increasing the economic feasbility for the OSCs is expanding the EQE, that is, reducing the band gap of the polymers used. A break-even target of $45/m2 for the OSC is stated, which is on the low range of current cost estimates; this break-even-target would increase for locales closer to the equator.

Abstract: Electrochemical self-organization principles were applied for nanofabrication of Au–Pt core–shell nanoemitters on pre-structured porous SiO2/Si interfaces. The silicon templates were fabricated by oscillatory photocurrent cycles in fluoride containing solutions, permitting subsequent local electrodeposition of rectifying metal heterocontacts into the pores. Enhanced light absorption of this Au–Pt/SiO2/Si nanoarchitecture is deduced from Mie scattering analysis and Finite Difference Time Domain simulations in dependence on the Pt-shell thickness. Test operation as photoelectrochemical cells in I−/I3− redox electrolytes shows conversion efficiencies of 11.6% improving thus the performance of the cells without plasmonic enhancement. It is thereby proven that self-organized electrochemical conditioning on the nanoscale can be successfully applied for preparation of advanced photovoltaic systems, opening thereby new avenues for low-cost production also of solid-state devices.

Abstract: The tumor suppressor p16INK4A (p16) blocks the cell cycle progression by inhibiting phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein. We describe here a novel aspect of the posttranslational control that has an important functional consequence on p16 protein. We first discovered that the p16 protein was methylated in various cell lineages. We then determined that the arginine 22, 131 and 138 of p16 were the main methylation sites. Western blotting and TUNEL analyses revealed that the p16 protein bearing these point mutations induced a higher apoptosis ratio than wild-type p16 in A549 cells. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation assays suggested that decrease of p16 arginine methylation level promoted the association of p16 with CDK4. Additionally, we determined that the protein arginine methyltransferase 6 (PRMT6) was responsible for the p16 arginine methylation. Results from flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that PRMT6 overexpression counteracted the cell cycle arrest at G1 phase induced by wild-type p16 in A549 cells. We also provided evidence that PRMT6 was able to interact with p16, and that the intensity of p16-CDK4 association was reduced upon PRMT6 overexpression. Together, data presented in this report establish that methylation at specific arginine residues of p16 protein by PRMT6 may be critical for the activity of p16.

Abstract: Although bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) can differentiate into neuron-like cells, the mechanisms underlying neuronal differentiation are not well understood. We recently found that inhibition of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC) by its inhibitor D609 promoted BMSCs’ differentiation into cholinergic neuron-like cells. Using the effective small molecule D609 and gene microarray technology, we investigated the change of gene expression profile to identify key mediators involved in the neuronal differentiation. We selected heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and transcription factor B-cell translocation gene 2 (Btg2) that were maximally up-regulated for further study. We found that functional suppression of Hsp70 blocked D609-induced increase of Btg2 expression and cholinergic neuronal differentiation of BMSCs. These results demonstrated that Hsp70 was the pivotal factor in PC-PLC-medicated neuronal differentiation of BMSCs, and Btg2 might be its downstream target. Our findings provide new clues for controlling BMSCs’ differentiation into cholinergic neuron-like cells and provide a putative strategy for neurodegenerative diseases therapies.

Abstract: Chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) signals via binding to its primary transmembrane receptor, cysteine (C)-X-C chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4). We previously reported that SDF-1 regulates osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MPCs) induced by bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP2). Although BMP2 is also capable of inducing chondrogenic differentiation of MPCs, the involvement of SDF-1 signaling in this function of BMP2 remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to test the role of SDF-1 signaling involved in BMP2-induced chondrogenic differentiation, using ATDC5 chondroprogenitors and mouse bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs). Our data showed that blocking of the SDF-1/CXCR4 pathway inhibits the differentiation of these cells into the chondrocytic lineages in response to BMP2 stimulation, evidenced by the reduced expression of type II collagen α1 (Col2α1), aggrecan, and type X collagen α1 (Col10α1), markers for chondrogenic differentiation. This effect of blocking SDF-1 signaling on BMP2-chondrogenic differentiation is associated with suppressed Sox9 and Runx2 expression (key transcription factors required for early and late stages of chondrogenic differentiation, respectively) and mediated via inhibiting intracellular Smad and Erk activation. Moreover, we found that addition of exogenous SDF-1 protein synergistically enhances the BMP2-induced chondrogenic differentiation in a dose-dependent manner. Collectively, our results demonstrated a novel role of SDF-1 signaling in regulating BMP2-induced chondrogenic differentiation in vitro. These data provide new insights into molecular mechanisms underlying BMP2-osteo/chondrogenesis, and may lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets and strategies to improve cartilage repair and regeneration in broad orthopaedic situations.

Abstract: Octaprenyl pyrophosphate synthase (OPPs), an enzyme belonging to the trans-prenyltransferases family, is involved in the synthesis of C40 octaprenyl pyrophosphate (OPP) by reacting farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) with five isopentenyl pyrophosphates (IPP). It has been reported that OPPs is essential for bacteria's normal growth and is a potential target for novel antibacterial drug design. Here we report the crystal structure of OPPs from Helicobacter pylori, determined by MAD method at 2.8Å resolution and refined to 2.0Å resolution. The substrate IPP was docked into HpOPPs structure and residues involved in IPP recognition were identified. The other substrate FPP, the intermediate GGPP and a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate drug were also modeled into the structure. The resulting model shed some lights on the enzymatic mechanism, including (1) residues Arg87, Lys36 and Arg39 are essential for IPP binding; (2) residues Lys162, Lys224 and Gln197 are involved in FPP binding; (3) the second DDXXD motif may involve in FPP binding by Mg2+ mediated interactions; (4) Leu127 is probably involved in product chain length determination in HpOPPs and (5) the intermediate products such as GGPP need a rearrange to occupy the binding site of FPP and then IPP is reloaded. Our results also indicate that the nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate drugs are potential inhibitors of FPPs and other trans-prenyltransferases aiming at blocking the binding of FPP.

Abstract: Experience has shown that the vacuum reliability and lifetime of parabolic trough receiver are one of the most significant issues for existing and future parabolic trough plants, affecting the plant efficiency and revenue. The gas sources within parabolic trough receiver and absorption characteristics of the getter were evaluated to analyze the factors affecting vacuum reliability. The outgassing rate and the gas species within parabolic trough receiver were tested to show that besides hydrogen permeation caused by thermal degradation of the organic heat transfer fluid, outgassing may also lead to hydrogen accumulation. The analysis further shows that both high and low temperatures affect the getter ability to absorb H2. O2, CO, N2 and CO2, introduced into the receiver vacuum annulus by outgassing or leakage, significantly reduce the getter surface activity, which reduces the H2 absorption capacity.

Abstract: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) promote tumorigenesis, growth, invasion and metastasis of cancer, whereas normal fibroblasts (NFs) are thought to suppress tumor progression. Little is known about miRNAs expression differences between CAFs and NFs or the patient-to-patient variability in miRNAs expression in breast cancer. We established primary cultures of CAFs and paired NFs from six resected breast tumor tissues that had not previously received radiotherapy or chemotherapy treatment and analyzed with miRNAs microarrays. The array data were analyzed using paired SAM t-test and filtered according to α and q values. Pathway analysis was conducted using DAVID v6.7. We identified 11 dysregulated miRNAs in CAFs: three were up-regulated (miR-221-5p, miR-31-3p, miR-221-3p), while eight were down-regulated (miR-205, miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-141, miR-101, miR-342-3p, let-7g, miR-26b). Their target genes are known to affect cell differentiation, adhesion, migration, proliferation, secretion and cell–cell interaction. By our knowledge it is firstly identify the expression profiles of miRNAs between CAFs and NFs and revealed their regulation on the associated signaling pathways.

Abstract: An extremely low bandgap donor–acceptor copolymer has been designed and synthesized as the donor material of the polymer solar cells via Stille coupling reaction. The donor–acceptor alternating structure consisted of 4,4-diethylhexyl-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (CPDT) donor unit and 2,3-bis(2-ethylhexyl)thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine (TP) acceptor unit. Since both units have attached branched alkyl chains, the polymer was well dissolved in common organic solvents. UV–vis spectrum of the polymer film exhibited a panchromatic absorption ranging from 280 to 1285nm and a low bandgap of 1.20eV. Compared to that in solution, solid-state UV–vis absorption spectrum of the polymer showed a strong bathochromic shift, indicating more efficient π-stacking and stronger intermolecular interactions. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the polymer were estimated to be 5.07 and 3.87eV, respectively. Based on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Polymer:PC61BM/Al device structure, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) under the illumination of AM 1.5 (100mW/cm2) was 0.149%. The effects of annealing temperature (100–200°C) for 30min on the device performance were studied as well. It was found that PCE of 0.264% could be acquired under the annealing condition at 175°C for 30min. The improved device efficiency under the optimal condition was confirmed by the higher light harvest in UV–vis spectra, the enhanced quenching of photoluminescence (PL) emission, and the increase in external quantum efficiency.

Abstract: MDC1 (NFBD1) and 53BP1 are critical mediators of the mammalian DNA damage response (DDR) at nuclear foci. Here we show by quantitative imaging assays that MDC1 and 53BP1 are similar in total copy number (∼1200 copies per focus), but differ substantially in dynamics at both replication-associated nuclear bodies in normal cells and DNA repair foci in ionizing radiation (IR)-damaged cells. The majority of MDC1 (∼80%) is extremely mobile and under continuous exchange, with only a small fraction (∼20%) remaining immobile at foci irrespective of IR treatment. By contrast, 53BP1 has a smaller mobile fraction (∼35%) and a larger immobile fraction (∼65%) at nuclear bodies, and becomes more dynamic (∼20% increase in mobile pool) upon IR-induced DNA damage. More specifically, the dynamics of 53BP1 is dependent on a minimal foci-targeting region (1231–1709), and differentially regulated by its N-terminus (1–1231) and C-terminal tBRCT domain (1709–1972). Furthermore, MDC1 knockdown, or disruption of 53BP1–MDC1 interaction, reduced the number of 53BP1 molecules at foci by ∼60%, but only modestly affected 53BP1 retention. This novel in vivo evidence reveals distinct dynamics of MDC1 and 53BP1 at different types of nuclear structures, and shows that MDC1 directly recruits and retains a subset of 53BP1 for DNA repair.

Abstract: This study demonstrates the feasibility of improving the optical properties of a vertically aligned quantum dot (QD) structure and the performance of a quantum dot intermediate band solar cell (QD-IBSC) by capping a GaAsSb layer on the InAs QDs. Experimental results indicate that dot-size uniformity is significantly improved due to the strain modification in the evolution of the successive vertically aligned dot layer growth. A solar cell device with an InAs/GaAsSb columnar dot structure increases the short-circuit current density (Jsc) by 8.8%, compared to a GaAs reference cell. This dot structure also increases quantum efficiency by up to 1200nm through the absorption of lower-energy photons. The InAs/GaAsSb QD-IBSC also improves the open-circuit voltage (Voc), indicating a reduction in misfit defect density and recombination current density. The results of this study confirm the ability of a columnar InAs/GaAsSb QD structure to enhance the device performance.

The cells showed vivid color changes via electrochemical reactions, i.e., from being water transparent to assuming one of the three primary colors (cyan, magenta, and yellow). Moreover, we obtained continuous-tone images by using the three primary-color EC cells. The formation of continuous-tone images by using the EC cells was realized by applying a rectangular-wave voltage with various duty ratios. In addition, according to a subtractive color-mixture process, we obtained multiple color representations, including intermediate red, green, and blue colors, by stacking two of the three primary-color EC cells.

Abstract: We report on the electrochromic performance of the novel crystalline tungsten oxide nano-urchins comprised of the W18O49 nano-wires added to the sphere shell. The performance of electrochromic devices was systematically compared by using tungsten oxide nano-structures with and without nano-wires on the surface of nano-sphere and with different phase of W18O49 and WO3. The optimized electrochromic films with nano-urchin-like W18O49 exhibited a fast switching response time, outstanding high coloration efficiency (∼132cm2/C), and durability within acidic electrolyte. This performance can be attributed to the high volume to surface ratio and phase of uniform urchin-like tungsten oxides.

Abstract: The stress responses of most bacteria are thought to involve the upregulation of small heat shock proteins. We describe here some of the most pertinent aspects of small heat shock proteins, to highlight their potential for use in various applications. Bacterial species have between one and 13 genes encoding small heat shock proteins, the precise number depending on the species considered. Major efforts have recently been made to characterize the protein protection and membrane stabilization mechanisms involving small heat shock proteins in bacteria. These proteins seem to be involved in the acquisition of cellular heat tolerance. They could therefore potentially be used to maintain cell viability under unfavorable conditions, such as heat shock or chemical treatments. This review highlights the potential roles of applications of small heat shock proteins in stabilizing overproduced heterologous proteins in Escherichia coli, purified bacterial small heat shock proteins in protein biochip technology, proteomic analysis and food technology and the potential impact of these proteins on some diseases. This article is part of a Directed Issue entitled: Small HSPs in physiology and pathology.

Abstract: Evidence is emerging that Foxo family proteins serve as biochemical signal integrators in complex signaling networks mediating and modulating diverse cellular functions. Herein, we report that besides the well-established function of Foxo3a as a transcriptional regulator of multiple target genes in nucleus, a substantial fraction of Foxo3a translocates to mitochondria leading to disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c and caspase activation during erythroid differentiation mediated by guanosine 5′-triphosphate (GTP). In fact, non transcriptional role of Foxo3a in mitochondria was achieved through the protein–protein interaction with pro-apoptotic protein Bax and its translocation to mitochondrial membrane. Furthermore, our results revealed that mitochondrial localization of Foxo3a was modulated by intracellular GTP content which is sensed by PKC signaling element. Collectively, our findings provided insight into a novel Foxo3a mechanism in leukemia cells which led to engagement of cells in the maturation pathway.

Dihydroceramide delays cell cycle G1/S transition via activation of ER stress and induction of autophagy,

Abstract: Dihydroceramides, the precursors of ceramides in the de novo sphingolipid synthesis, have been recently implicated in active signalling. We previously demonstrated that dihydroceramide accumulation, in response to treatment with the dihydroceramide desaturase inhibitor XM462, induced autophagy with no sign of cell death in the gastric carcinoma HCG27 cell line. Here we show that XM462 treatment induces a transient early increase in dihydroceramides that are successively metabolized into other sphingolipids. Dihydroceramides accumulation is associated with cyclin D1 expression modulation, delayed G1/S transition of cell cycle and increased autophagy. Moreover, XM462 treatment induces ER stress via the activation of the translation inhibitor eIF2α and the pro-survival transcriptional factor Xbp1. Exogenous addition of a short chain dihydroceramide analog reproduces the effects of endogenous accumulation of dihydroceramides, causing cell cycle delay of the G1/S transition, autophagy enhancement, eIF2α activation and Xbp1 splicing. Blocking autophagy with 3-methyladenine abrogates the effect of XM462 on cell cycle and reduces cell survival to XM462 treatment. Furthermore, the XM462-induced survival response is able to reduce etoposide toxicity in HCG27 and HCT116 cancer cells. Our data suggest a role of dihydroceramide in regulating cell proliferation and survival.

Abstract: Nitridation is the process in which, during the initial growth of a-SiNx:H layers on Si surfaces, nitrogen is incorporated into the Si lattice near its surface. We show that this nitridation process affects the density of interface states (Dit) and fixed charges (Qf) at the interface. These parameters determine the effective surface passivation quality of the layers. The nitridation can be tuned independently of the growth of a-SiNx:H layers by using a plasma treatment prior to actual a-SiNx:H layer deposition. It is shown that Qf can be varied from 2×1012 to 15×1012cm−2 without changing the a-SiNx:H deposition process. It is demonstrated that in our case and processing window, Qf is the determining factor in surface passivation quality in the range of 2×1012 to 8×1012cm−2. For higher values of Qf, Dit has increased significantly and has become dominant thereby reducing the passivation quality. It is shown that the passivation can be controlled independently of the a-SiNx:H deposition process. In completed solar cells the effect of the controlled Qf and Dit is studied. On n-type solar cells, due to increased depletion, increases in Qf and Dit resulted in a drop in open-circuit voltage, Voc, of over 20mV. On p-type solar cells, where the Qf results in accumulation, the effect was negligible.

Abstract: Exosomes are discussed as potent therapeutics due to efficient transfer of proteins, mRNA and miRNA in selective targets. However, therapeutic exosome application requires knowledge on target structures to avoid undue delivery. Previous work suggesting exosomal tetraspanin–integrin complexes to be involved in target cell binding, we aimed to control this hypothesis and to define target cell ligands. Exosomes are rich in tetraspanins that associate besides other molecules with integrins. Co-immunoprecipitation of exosome lysates from rat tumor lines that differ only with respect to Tspan8 and beta4 revealed promiscuity of tetraspanin–integrin associations, but also few preferential interactions like that of Tspan8 with alpha4 and beta4 integrin chains. These minor differences in exosomal tetraspanin-complexes strongly influence target cell selection in vitro and in vivo, efficient exosome-uptake being seen in hematopoietic cells and solid organs. Exosomes expressing the Tspan8–alpha4 complex are most readily taken up by endothelial and pancreas cells, CD54 serving as a major ligand. Selectivity of uptake was confirmed with exosomes from an alpha4 cDNA transfected Tspan8+ lymph node stroma line. Distinct from exosomes from the parental line, the latter preferentially targeted endothelial cells and in vivo the pancreas. Importantly, pulldown experiments provided strong evidence that exosome-uptake occurs in internalization-prone membrane domains. This is the first report on the exosomal tetraspanin web contributing to target cell selection such that predictions can be made on potential targets, which will facilitate tailoring exosomes for drug delivery.

Abstract: In this work, we report for the first time on the electronic properties and the solar cell fabrication on N-type silicon ribbons grown by the RST method. We have investigated the majority charge carriers' parameters (resistivity and mobility) and the minority carrier lifetime (MCL) of N-type silicon RST ribbons. The MCL values are deduced using the photoconductivity decay method on RST wafers, the surface of which was passivated by an iodine/ethanol solution. The effect of hydrogen plasma treatment on the electronic properties of the as-grown RST ribbons was also studied. We show that the bulk passivation following hydrogen plasma treatment, carried out at temperatures above 350°C for more than 1h, strongly improves the MCL. Conventional solar cells were prepared on RST ribbons grown in optimized conditions and passivated by plasma hydrogenation. Two types of boron emitters were tested, namely those obtained by boron-spin-coating and by ion implantation, while the N+ region serving as a back surface field was made by phosphorus spin coating. The highest conversion efficiency values obtained for boron-implantation (B-II) and boron-spin-coating (B-SOD) emitters on a ∼120μm thick RST were 13.8% and 12.7% respectively, with no surface texturing, or optimized surface passivation. Suns-Voc method applied to these RST cells gave, for B-II and B-SOD emitters conversion efficiencies of about 15.1% and 13.6%, respectively. The former value represents to our knowledge the highest efficiency value obtained for ultrathin N-type multi-crystalline silicon ribbon based cells.

Abstract: By evaluating four lock-in thermography images of a solar cell taken at four different biases and an independently measured series resistance image, images of all local two-diode parameters are obtained. Assuming the local validity of the two-diode model, this information enables the construction of local and global dark and illuminated characteristics and of realistic images of local solar cell parameters like efficiency, fill factor, and open circuit voltage with a good spatial resolution. Within this procedure, an injection-dependent lifetime may be regarded by assuming an ideality factor larger than unity for the diffusion current. The possibilities and limitations of this approach are discussed and selected results on a typical industrial multicrystalline cell are introduced. The proposed procedure is a valuable tool for judging which local defects are especially harmful for degrading the fill factor or the open circuit voltage, respectively, and extrapolating the properties of a cell where certain types of defects are excluded. A general limitation of this approach is that it assumes an individual but constant series resistance to each pixel, which neglects the distributed character of the series resistance.

Abstract: Electro-spray (e-spray) is emerging as an attractive printing method for the thin-film fabrication of organic materials because of the simple apparatus and its high efficiency. Here, we demonstrate a fully e-sprayed organic solar cell (OSC) with high performance by using an additive in the poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) layer without any post-processing treatment. The P3HT:PCBM film fabricated with 6vol% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) showed improved surface macro- and nano-morphologies, which resulted in an enhanced photovoltaic performance. Using optimized conditions, we obtained a 2.98% efficient OSC (as-prepared condition) with the e-spray method, and post-annealing increased the power conversion efficiency (PCE) slightly to 3.08%.

Abstract: The well known fact that cobalt(II) halide complexes in various media undergo changes of co-ordination, absorbance and colour with the increase of temperature was combined with the low melting point of new materials suitable for simultaneous control of temperature and light intensity. Hence, the increase of absorbance with temperature acts as an auto-regulated shading protection from overheating. In this work, the thermochromic behaviour of cobalt(II) chloro-complexes was investigated by VIS–spectroscopy in four different ammonium nitrate+organic component based solvents and in ammonium nitrate+calcium nitrate tetrahydrate melt. The selected organic components were formamide (FA), N-methylformamide (NMF), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO). In all binary mixtures the mole ratio of ammonium nitrate to the second component of the system was 1:3 and they were studied as suitable solvents for the formation of cobalt(II) chloro-complexes. Absorption spectra have been investigated in the visible spectral range 400–800nm at two different temperatures (298.15 and 323.15K). The overall stability constants of all formed complexes were calculated using a non-linear regression program at different temperatures: 308.15, 318.15, 328.15, 338.15 and 348.15K. Based on these stability constants, the thermodynamic data, i.e. standard enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs energy, were calculated for all complexation reactions. Influence of the solvent composition on the complex stability and thermochromism was also discussed.

Abstract: Damaged DNA-binding protein 2 (DDB2), a protein that binds damaged DNA, is a DDB1 and CUL4-associated factor. This study is the first to demonstrate that DDB2 is a novel androgen receptor (AR)-interacting protein; and mediating contact with AR and CUL4A–DDB1 complex for AR ubiquitination/degradation. DNA damage induces both p53 and DDB2 gene expression those two can inhibit AR expression. The former reduces AR via transcription regulation but the latter via proteosome degradation. Thereby DDB2 can inhibit cell growth rate in AR-expressing cells (LNCaP) but not in AR-null cells (PC3). Hence DDB2 may be a potential regimen for prostate cancer treatment, especially in androgen-refractory patients harboring high amount of AR who cannot be cured by androgen ablation.

Abstract: Mixed phase titania is known to be a better photocatalyst than its pristine phases under UV irradiation for detoxification and disinfection applications. Photocatalytic activity of visible active vanadium doped titania has been explored under visible light with the objectives—(i) to compare the performance of anatase, rutile, mixed phases of V doped titania, and (ii) to investigate the activity of the V doped titania phases both for disinfection and detoxification applications. The performance was investigated in terms of degradation of phenol and inactivation of Escherichia coli bacteria. The samples were characterized using XRD, SEM,TEM, EDAX and UV-DRS analyses. The photocatalytic detoxification and disinfection performance of the samples were evaluated in terms of rate constant and photonic efficiency/microbicidal photonic efficiency. All the TiV oxide samples (particle size∼30–100nm) showed visible light activity. The V-doped mixed phase titania catalyst consistently showed superior photocatalytic detoxification and disinfection activity compared to V-doped pristine titania samples. This enhancement in photoactivity observed in V-doped mixed phase titania may be attributed to the effective charge carrier separation as per interfacial model of mixed phase titania.

Abstract: In this work, we study the influence of the amount of active phosphorus atoms in the emitter region of silicon N+/P solar cells. After emitter formation by thermal diffusion, a part of phosphorus atoms in the vicinity of the surface is electrically inactive. This results in a high emitter saturation current density and in a poor quantum efficiency in the blue wavelength range. This emitter region is usually known as dead layer. We first introduce a simple method to determine the percentage of electrically active phosphorus atoms in emitters obtained from a low pressure POCl3 diffusion furnace. Different phosphorus diffusions are performed using different parameters (temperature, time, POCl3/O2 ratio, and preoxidation time). We then investigate the effect of the fraction of active phosphorus on the doping level and on the emitter passivation. We show that diffusion parameters can greatly influence the active phosphorus percentage, particularly the POCl3/O2 ratio or the addition of a preoxidation step. Concerning the emitter passivation, a linear variation of the emitter saturation current density as a function of the active phosphorus percentage is observed. Using appropriate POCl3/O2 ratio or preoxidation time, we obtain an emitter saturation current density around 100fA/cm2.

Selective modulation of different GABAA receptor isoforms by diazepam and etomidate in hippocampal neurons,

Abstract: Diazepam modulation of native γ2-containing GABAA (γGABAA) receptors increases channel conductance by facilitating protein interactions involving the γ2-subunit amphipathic (MA) region, which is found in the cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane domains 3 and 4 (Everitt et al., 2009). However, many drugs, predicted to act on different GABAA receptor subtypes, increase channel conductance leading us to hypothesize that conductance variation in GABAA receptors may be a general property, mediated by protein interactions involving the cytoplasmic MA stretch of amino acids. In this study we have tested this hypothesis by potentiating extrasynaptic GABAA currents with etomidate and examining the ability of peptides mimicking either the γ2- or δ-subunit MA region to affect conductance. In inside-out hippocampal patches from newborn rats the general anesthetic etomidate potentiated GABA currents, producing either an increase in open probability and single-channel conductance or an increase in open probability, as described previously (Seymour et al., 2009). In patches displaying high conductance channels application of a δ(392–422) MA peptide, but not a scrambled version or the equivalent γ2(381–403) MA peptide, reduced the potentiating effects of etomidate, significantly reducing single-channel conductance. In contrast, when GABA currents were potentiated by the γ2-specific drug diazepam the δ MA peptide had no effect. These data reveal that diazepam and etomidate potentiate different extrasynaptic GABAA receptor subtypes but both drugs modulate conductance similarly. One interpretation of the data is that these drugs elicit potentiation through protein interactions and that the MA peptides compete with these interactions to disrupt this process.

Abstract: Ag particle-assisted chemical etching of silicon wafers in HF/H2O2 is of interest for its potential to produce antireflective layers for solar cells. In this work, Ag films containing both nanoscale (d<100nm) and microscale (d<1μm) particles were deposited through the silver-mirror reaction on planar p-Si(111), planar p-Si(100) and p-Si(100) pre-etched in KOH/isopropanol to produce pyramidal textures. Subsequently, these wafers were subjected to metal-assisted chemical etching (MacEtch) in 1:1:1 (v:v:v) HF(49%):H2O2(30%):EtOH solutions, to produce porous silicon (PSi) containing both micro- and nanoscale roughness features. The resulting surfaces exhibit morphologies that evolve with processing conditions, especially the absence/presence of pyramidal textures and the time the structure is subjected to MacEtch. Under optimal conditions excellent anti-reflection behavior is observed with surface reflectivities being reduced below 10% for either p-Si(100) or p-Si(111) surfaces. For p-Si(100) better results (R∼5%) were obtained for 30min KOH/isopropanol pre-etch than for either no pre-etch or longer (60min) pre-etch. The influence of the reductant on Ag particle deposition on p-Si(111) was studied, and MacEtch catalyzed by Ag produced from acetaldehyde reductant produced surfaces with lower reflectivities than those with glucose reductant.

Abstract: A monolithic all-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) module based on mesoscopic carbon counter electrodes with high stability has been developed, which offers a promising prospect for commercial applications. Based on the design of a triple layer structure, all the layers are constructed on a single conducting glass substrate by screen-printing. A typical monolithic all-solid-state DSSC module, which consists of five series-interconnected unit cells, shows an overall energy conversion efficiency of 2.57% and a maximum output of 156.9mW. In the case of applying a solid-state polymer electrolyte, we have developed a novel sealing method for all-solid-state DSSCs. Endurance tests were carried out to investigate the stability of the module under a hot and high humidity environment (60°C, 85%RH) and heat and cool cycle stress (−10 and 60°C), which indicated that the sealing method improved the stability of the module effectively.

Abstract: We found that for O content as high as ∼2×1019at./cm3, hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H) solar cell having 10.6% efficiency is attainable, when a small amount of B ∼1–3×1016at./cm3 is incorporated. Micro-doping compensation is critical for high efficiency nc-Si:H cells absent very low residual impurities. Quantum efficiency (QE) loss in the long wavelength region is observed when O is present, which loss can be eliminated by micro-doping with a compensating element such as B. However, when the B content exceeds a certain compensation level, a QE loss in short wavelength region is observed.

Abstract: MET, the receptor for hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGF), has been reported to trigger multiple and sometimes opposing cellular responses in various types of tumor cells. It has been implicated in the regulation of tumor-cell survival, proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis. However, the MET regulatory mechanism in glioma is not well known. MicroRNAs are a class of small noncoding RNAs that play important roles in a variety of biological processes including human cancers. In this study, we used computational and expressional analysis to identify that the ‘seed sequence’ of miR-410 matched the 3′ UTR of the MET mRNA. Besides, the expression of miR-410 was inversely associated with MET in human glioma tissues. Using luciferase and western blot assay, we certified that miR-410 directly targeted MET in glioma cells. While restoring expression of miR-410 led to proliferation inhibition and reduced invasive capability in glioma cells. Furthermore, we showed that miR-410 played an important role in regulating MET-induced AKT signal transduction. While downregulation of MET by RNAi, we observed that MET knockdown resulted in effects similar to that with miR-410 transfection in glioma cells. Our findings suggest that miR-410, a direct regulator of MET, may function as a tumor suppressor in human gliomas.

Abstract: We have reported that polyamines increase cell viability at the stationary phase of cell growth through translational stimulation of ribosome modulation factor, and SpoT and RpoZ proteins involved in the synthesis and function of ppGpp in Escherichia coli. Since biofilm formation is also involved in cell viability, we looked for proteins involved in biofilm formation and cell viability whose synthesis is stimulated by polyamines at the level of translation. It was found that the synthesis of response regulators UvrY and CpxR in the two-component signal transducing systems and ribosome recycling factor (RRF) was increased by polyamines at the level of translation. Polyamine stimulation of the synthesis of UvrY and RRF was dependent on the existence of the inefficient initiation codons UUG and GUG in uvrY and frr mRNA, respectively; and polyamine stimulation of CpxR synthesis was dependent on the existence of an unusual location of a Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence in cpxR mRNA. Biofilm formation and cell viability in the absence of polyamines was increased by transformation of modified uvrY and cpxR genes, and cell viability by modified frr gene whose translation occurs effectively without polyamines. The results indicate that polyamines are necessary for both biofilm formation and cell viability.

Abstract: Previously we reported that the sesquiterpene lactone parthenolide induces oxidative stress in cardiac myocytes, which blocks Janus kinase (JAK) activation by the interleukin 6 (IL-6)-type cytokines. One implication suggested by this finding is that IL-6 signaling is dependent upon cellular anti-oxidant defenses or redox status. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to directly test the hypothesis that JAK1 signaling by the IL-6-type cytokines in cardiac myocytes is impaired by glutathione (GSH) depletion, since this tripeptide is one of the major anti-oxidant molecules and redox-buffers in cells. Cardiac myocytes were pretreated for 6h with l-buthionine-sulfoximine (BSO) to inhibit GSH synthesis. After 24h, cells were dosed with the IL-6-like cytokine, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). BSO treatment decreased GSH levels and dose-dependently attenuated activation of JAK1, Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3), and extracellular signal regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). Addition of glutathione monoethyl ester, which is cleaved intracellularly to GSH, prevented attenuation of LIF-induced JAK1 and STAT3 activation, as did the reductant N-acetyl-cysteine. Unexpectedly, LIF-induced STAT1 activation was unaffected by GSH depletion. Evidence was found that STAT3 is more resistant than STAT1 to intermolecular disulfide bond formation under oxidizing conditions and more likely to retain the monomeric form, suggesting that conformational differences explain the differential effect of GSH depletion on STAT1 and STAT3. Overall, our findings indicate that activation of both JAK1 and STAT3 is redox-sensitive and the character of IL-6 type cytokine signaling in cardiac myocytes is sensitive to changes in the cellular redox status. In cardiac myocytes, activation of STAT1 may be favored over STAT3 under oxidizing conditions due to GSH depletion and/or augmented reactive oxygen species production, such as in ischemia-reperfusion and heart failure.

Abstract: The ternary Cu–Sb–S semiconductors are considered to be sustainable and potential alternative absorber materials in thin film photovoltaic applications. In these compounds, several phases may coexist, albeit in different proportions depending on experimental growth conditions. Additionally, the photovoltaic efficiency could be increased with isoelectronic doping. In this work we analyze the electronic properties of O-doped Cu3SbS3 in two structures: the wittichenite and the skinnerite. We use first-principles within the density functional formalism with two different exchange–correlation potentials. In addition, we estimate the potential of these compounds for photovoltaic applications.

Abstract: For the successful commercial production of CIGS PV modules, a good long-term damp heat stability of solar modules is necessary. The causes for the degradation of encapsulated solar modules are clearly explained. This article investigates the degradation behavior of encapsulated CIGS PV modules combined with the failure analysis of AZO films in CIGS cells. CIGS PV modules were exposed to the damp heat test of the IEC 61646 qualification standard—the modules are discolored from the outside edge to the center. Moreover, each module had its own distinct discolored area. The discolored area of the modules is significantly associated with the degradation of FF and efficiency. To clarify the causes of the degradation of FF and efficiency, failure analysis of AZO films in CIGS cells was performed. Electrical and structural properties as well as observation of the microstructure depending on the position of the AZO layers were characterized to explain the degradation mechanism of the encapsulated CIGS PV modules. It was revealed that the discoloration phenomenon of the modules and the degradation of AZO films were caused by the penetration of water molecules and adsorption of oxygen. By XPS and FT-IR analyses, the causes of degradation were confirmed. It was attributed to the generation of Zn(OH)2 and carboxylic acids by a combination of EVA, AZO and water molecules.

Abstract: To apply as an interfacial layer for solution processible polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on poly(3-hexylthiophene): [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM), novel poly(1,1′-dibutyl-4,4′-bipyridinium dibromide) (PV4), poly(1,1′-didodecyl-4,4′-bipyridinium dibromide) (PV12), and poly(1,1′-triethylenedioxy-4,4′-bipyridinium di-p-toluenesulfonate) (PV-OTs) are synthesized. These polyviologen (PV) derivatives have different alkyl chain length and counter anion. From the ultraviolet spectroscopy (UPS) study, the reduction of the work function of Al are observed by the formation of interface dipole, which is induced by the thin film of PV derivatives. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of conventional type PSC based on PV4 and PV12 with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/PV layer/Al are 2.22 and 2.71%, respectively. In particular, the PCE of PSC with PV-OTs reaches 3.30%. The Jsc and Voc are—9.51mA/cm2 and 0.60V, which are dramatically improved than those of the devices based on PV4 and PV12. This is due to different contact property between active layer and Al, which is controlled by the alkyl chain length and counter anion of PV derivatives. The series resistance (Rs) of the device with PV-OTs is 3.05 (ohmcm2), which is smaller than that of the device without PV and with PV4 and PV12. The performances of PSC with PV derivatives as a interfacial layer are strongly related with both contact property and formation of interface dipole. The work function of ITO is also reduced by the thin layer of PV derivatives. Inverted type PSCs with a structure of ITO/PV layer/P3HT:PCBM/WO3/Ag show typical rectification and pretty good photovoltaic property, while the device without PV layer shows very weak photovoltaic property and does not show diode characteristics.

Abstract: Embedding quantum dots into the intrinsic layer of a p–i–n solar cell has been proposed as a method of increasing solar cell photocurrent by improving its long-wavelength light response. However, strong carrier localization and efficient radiative recombination in quantum dots are large barriers to efficient carrier extraction. We present experimental evidence and a theoretical model to show that carrier extraction from InAs quantum dots is significantly enhanced by the presence of defects, which act to lower the potential barrier for carrier escape. Therefore in the long-wavelength region where the quantum dots are strongly absorbing we suggest that contrary to bulk systems, radiative, rather than non-radiative, processes appear to limit the performance of quantum dot solar cells.

Abstract: The main aspects of the sol–gel synthesis of ZnO thin films were critically examined with particular reference to the optimization of the process parameters that influence specific properties of the films, such as the transparency, the crystallization behavior and the electrical resistivity. Starting from zinc acetate dihydrate, anhydrous ethanol and triethanolamine, a valuable sol–gel route was set. This route allowed the preparation of transparent ZnO thin films by dip-coating. Triethanolamine, thanks to its high chelating efficiency towards Zn2+, permitted to prepare stable zinc acetate dihydrate solutions wholly at room temperature. The structural, optical and morphological characteristics of the films were examined by glancing incidence X-ray diffraction, UV–vis spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. Single layer films, with a thickness of about 120nm, characterized by a high adhesion force (about 140Kgcm−2), were obtained. The crystallization behavior of dip-coated amorphous films was explored in the 500–600°C range; polycrystalline films, formed by randomly oriented ZnO nanocrystals (about 20nm), with an average transmittance higher than 90% in the visible region, were obtained. Finally, a strong influence of annealing environment on electrical resistivity was observed.

Abstract: Two carbazole-substituted fullerene derivatives, N-methyl-[9-(2-ethylhexyl)-9H-carbazole-2-yl]-pyrrolidine (CBZPYR-C60) and [9-(2-ethylhexyl)-9H-carbazole-2-yl] C61-butyric acid methyl ester (CBZBME-C60), were synthesized through a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of an azomethine intermediate and a tosylhydrazone route, respectively. The synthesized CBZPYR-C60 and CBZBME-C60 showed good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform, toluene, and 1,2-dichlorobenzene. The synthesized fullerene derivatives were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR, FAB-MS, FT-IR, UV–visible absorption, and fluorescence spectroscopy. The electrochemical properties of the fullerenes and morphologies of the P3HT:acceptor layers were also investigated through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), respectively. P3HT-based bulk-heterojunction photovoltaic devices were fabricated by using CBZPYR-C60 and CBZBME-C60 as the electron acceptors. The photovoltaic devices were fabricated with a layered structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:acceptor/LiF/Al. Composite ratios of P3HT to the fullerene derivatives of 1:0.5, 1:0.7, and 1:1 were used in the active layers. The device performance of these organic solar cells was determined by the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), and fill factor (FF). The highest power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the devices fabricated using CBZPYR-C60 and CBZBME-C60 were 1.90% and 2.29%, respectively, with a composite ratio of 1:0.7.

Abstract: A series of diesters of high-chain dicarboxylic acids with 1-tetradecanol (myristyl alcohol) was synthesized by using decanedioic, dodecanedioic and tetradecanedioic acids under vacuum and in the absence of catalyst for the first time. These diesters were particularly investigated in terms of their thermo-physical properties to be further used as phase change materials (PCMs) in thermal energy storage. High purity syntheses were controlled via FT-IR, GC–MS and elemental analyses and thermo-physical properties were determined with differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and thermo-gravimetric analyzer (TGA). Thermal properties of the diesters were expressed in terms of phase change temperature, enthalpy, specific heat (Cp), thermal decomposition and reliability after 1000 thermal cycles with necessary statistical data. In addition to that, the GC–MS data were also presented to specify the mass fragmentation fingerprints of the diesters. The yield of diester formation was found to be in the range of 95–97%. The DSC analyses indicated that the melting temperatures of the high-chain diesters with myristyl alcohol were between 50°C and 58°C with phase change enthalpy above 200kJ/kg. The results showed that these materials were favorable for low temperature heat transfer applications with successful thermal properties and reliability.

Abstract: Conceptus (embryo and associated extraembryonic membranes) implantation and development require a reciprocal biochemical and physical interactions between the extraembryonic membranes and the endometrium. However, the enzymatic antioxidative pathways controlling reactive oxygen species production at the endometrial–extraembryonic membrane interface early in pregnancy are not known. We aimed therefore to determine the content of malondialdehyde, as biomarkers of lipid peroxidation, and the activities of the major antioxidant enzymes, copper–zinc containing and manganese containing superoxide dismutases, catalase and glutathione peroxidase, in sheep extraembryonic membranes, caruncular and intercaruncular endometrium zones sampled at specific stages of pregnancy corresponding to the conceptus implantation (day 16) and the early post-implantation period (day 21). Malondialdehyde content in caruncular, intercaruncular and extraembryonic tissues was not different between stages of the pregnancy. Extraembryonic membranes demonstrated increased manganese containing superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities, whereas catalase activity in these tissues decreased from day 16 to day 21. Caruncular tissues demonstrated increased manganese containing superoxide dismutase activity from day 16 to day 21. Intercaruncular tissues demonstrated increased copper–zinc containing superoxide dismutase, manganese containing superoxide dismutase and catalase activities from day 16 to day 21. The ovine extraembryonic membranes exhibit dynamic changes in enzymatic antioxidative pathways different from those of endometrial tissues during the transition from implantation to post-implantation period. This biochemical data provides novel insights into the developmental changes in antioxidative pathways of extraembryonic membranes and endometrium during early conceptus development.

Abstract: Radiotherapy (RT) is one of the most effective tools in the clinical treatment of cancer. Because the tumor suppressor p53 plays a central role in radiation-mediated responses, including cell cycle-arrest and apoptosis, a number of studies have suggested that p53 could be a useful therapeutic target of anti-cancer agents. Accordingly, we sought to discover a new agent capable of increasing p53 activity. HCT116 colon cancer cells, containing wild-type p53, were stably transfected with a p53 responsive-luciferase (p53-Luc) reporter gene. A cell-based high-throughput screen of 7920 synthetic small molecules was performed in duplicate. Of the screened compounds, acriflavine (ACF) significantly increased p53-Luc activity in a concentration-dependent manner without causing toxicity. Pretreatment with ACF enhanced the induction of p53 protein expression and phosphorylation on serine 15 by γ-irradiation. Clonogenic assays showed that ACF pretreatment also potentiated radiation-induced cell death. The combination of irradiation and ACF treatment induced mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and significant activation of caspase-3 with PARP cleavage in colon cancer cells, demonstrating typical apoptotic cell death. Combined treatment with ACF and radiation increased the expression of Bax and Bad, while decreasing expression of Bcl-2. In addition, the ACF/radiation treatment combination induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses mediated by IRE1α (inositol-requiring transmembrane kinase and endonuclease 1α), eIF-2α (eukaryotic initiation factor 2α), caspase-2/12, and CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein). The knockdown of IRE1α by siRNA inhibited the apoptotic cell death induced by ACF/radiation treatment. In vivo studies showed that combined treatment with ACF and radiation significantly inhibited the growth of tumors in colorectal cancer xenografted mice. These results indicate that ACF acts through p53-dependent mitochondrial pathways and ER stress signals, and could be a promising radiosensitizer.

Abstract: RecQL4, one of the five human RecQ helicases, is crucial for genomic stability and RecQL4 when mutated leads to premature aging phenotypes in humans. Unlike other human RecQ helicases, RecQL4 is found both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. While the nuclear localization signal (NLS) and the retention domain at the N-terminus are responsible for the nuclear localization of RecQL4, the signal for its cytoplasmic localization is essentially unknown. In this study, two functional nuclear exporting signals (NESs; pNES2 and pNES3) were identified at the C-terminus of RecQL4. Deletion of pNES2 drastically diminished the cytoplasmic localization of RecQL4. Strikingly, addition of ubiquitination tail at the C-terminus of RecQL4 substantially enriched the cytoplasmic fraction of RecQL4 only in the presence of functional pNES2. Immunofluorescence studies revealed that the cytoplasmic RecQL4 was localized in mitochondria. Consistent with its mitochondrial localization, a regulatory role for RecQL4 in the maintenance of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number was demonstrated. Elevation of ectopic expression of RecQL4 increased the mtDNA copy number in HEK293 cells while RecQL4 knock down markedly decreased the mtDNA copy number in U2OS cells. Additionally, a substantially increased level of mitochondrial superoxide production, and a markedly decreased repair capacity for oxidative DNA damage were observed in the mitochondria of both RecQL4 deficient human fibroblasts and RecQL4-suppressed cancer cells. These data strongly suggest a regulatory role for RecQL4 in mitochondrial stability and function. Collectively, our study demonstrates that NES-mediated RecQL4 export to the cytoplasm is essential for the maintenance of mitochondrial genome stability.

Abstract: Novel nickel oxide coatings (100–600nm in thickness) with low surface roughness (<20nm) and haze levels down to 6% were deposited at a temperature not higher than 150°C on FTO glass and conducting plastic films. The coatings were deposited on the substrates from water dispersions made of Ni1−xO pigment synthesized via the peroxo route by reaction of a H2O2/urea mixture with Ni-acetate precursor. The bunsenite Ni1−xO pigment was obtained after thermal treatment of xerogels at 400°C for 24h. Processing common for paint manufacturing was applied for the preparation of water dispersions of the Ni1−xO pigment, i.e., intensive milling of the pigment with dispersant. Dispersant (NiOxHy) was prepared by colloidal precipitation technique from Ni-sulfate precipitated with sodium hypochlorite. The materials (Ni1−xO pigment, NiOxHy precipitate, coatings) were investigated using various analytical techniques (TG, DSC, SEM, TEM, IR and optical spectroscopy), while the electrochromic properties were determined by means of in situ spectroelectrochemical measurements, applying standard electrochemical techniques (cyclic voltammetry, chronocoulometry). The results revealed a convenient, simple, and robust technique for making “electrochromic paint” coatings from pre-prepared Ni1−xO pigment. They demonstrate the potential of the described electrochromic coatings for manufacturing plastic film based electrochromic devices providing transmissive light modulation.

Abstract: Laminar shear stress (LSS), induced by flowing blood, plays a key role in determining vascular health by modulating endothelial behaviour and vascular tone. In systemic endothelium many of the beneficial effects of chronic LSS are mediated through the transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2), but little is known regarding the role of chronic LSS in the renal glomerulus. We demonstrate that exposure of glomerular endothelial cells to chronic (>24h) LSS of 10dyn/cm2 increases phosphorylation of extra-cellular signal-related kinase 5 (ERK5) and increases expression of KLF2, leading to increased expression of the downstream molecules endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), thrombomodulin, endothelin-1 and nitric oxide. However, the proportion of eNOS which was phosphorylated at serine 1117 and threonine 495 residues was decreased. We demonstrated dependence of these effects on the ERK5 pathway by using the inhibitor UO126. We found high levels of KLF2 expression in human glomeruli confirming the relevance of our in vitro observations and, as KLF2 is specifically induced by chronic LSS, suggesting the physiological importance of shear stress in the glomerulus. Conditioned medium from glomerular endothelial cells under chronic LSS decreased podocyte monolayer resistance and increased phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein. The latter effect was more pronounced using a novel insert-based direct co-culture system in which endothelial cells were exposed to chronic LSS. These data provide the first direct evidence of glomerular endothelial cell to podocyte cross-talk.

However, to date, the regulatory role of SP in the control of melanogenesis has not been elucidated. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of SP on melanogenesis and to elucidate its underlying mechanism(s). After treatment for 48h in mouse B16-F10 melanoma cells, SP (1 and 10nM) significantly down-regulated tyrosinase activity and melanin content. Importantly, western blot analysis revealed the presence of neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1 R) in B16-F10 cells and the activation of it after SP treatment. It was also found that preincubation with NK-1 receptor antagonist Spantide I could partially reversed SP-induced down-regulations of tyrosinase activity, melanin content and the expression of tyrosinase and tyrosinase-related protein 1. Furthermore, SP could remarkably inhibit the expressions of microphtalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and p-p38 MAPK and stimulated p-p70 S6K1. These effects could also be partially reversed by the pretreatment with Spantide I. These results collectively suggested that SP inhibited melanogenesis in B16-F10 cells, which might be attributed to the fact that SP induces the activation of NK-1 receptor, stimulates the phosphorylation of p70 S6K1 and inhibits that of p38 MAPK, decreases the tyrosinase and tyrosinase-related protein 1 expression through MITF, finally resulting in the suppression of melanogenesis. These observations in vitro indicated that the regulation of the SP/NK-1 receptor system might be a useful novel management for skin pigmentation.

Abstract: Novel halogen-free flame retardant hybrid phase change composites were prepared by an in-situ sol–gel process, using paraffin as the thermal energy storage material and tri-(triethoxysilylpropyl) phosphamide as the sol–gel precursor. The structure of paraffin composites was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FT-IR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The behaviors of thermal stability and thermal energy storage properties were investigated through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The char residue of composites was characterized by FT-IR, XRD and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The flame retardancy property of paraffin composites was investigated by pyrolysis combustion flow calorimetry (PCFC). Results showed that the paraffin composites had good thermal energy storage property as well as enhanced thermal stability and flame retardancy properties.

Abstract: In this study, the CdS nanocrystalline thin films elaborated by sol–gel dip-coating process with a less reported precursor based on polyethyleneglycol matrix. After heat treatments in air at different annealing temperatures, the prepared thin films were investigated by studying their structural, morphological, compositional, d.c. electrical, optical (linear and nonlinear) and photoluminescence properties. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results suggest that the samples are polycrystalline in nature with a mixed (cubic+hexagonal) crystal structure and the average grain size is in the range of 12.84–20.55nm. The phase transformation was occurred at 350°C to hexagonal structure. The surface morphology of the films was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results revealed that the films consist of nanocrystalline grains with uniform coverage of the substrate surface. To examine the chemical composition of the films, the X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of the composite films were measured. As the annealing temperature increased from 250 to 450°C the mobility enhanced from 42.99 to 296.20cm2V−1s−1, respectively. It was found that the transmittance and the band gap decreased as the annealing temperature increased. The optical constants of the films were studied and the dispersion of the refractive index was discussed in terms of the Wemple–Didomenico single oscillator model. The real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant of the films were determined too. It was also observed that the volume energy loss (VELF) increases more than the surface energy loss (SELF) at their particular peaks. The third-order nonlinear polarizability parameter is higher for CdS thin films with smaller crystallite size. Multiple Cd and S defects were observed by employing photoluminescence (PL) method. The intensities of emission peaks for the prepared thin films varied with annealing temperature and the behaviors of different band peaks were discussed with giving reasons.

Abstract: Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM-1) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily expressed on macrophage and neutrophils and is emerging as a potent amplifier of TLR initiated inflammatory responses. Blockade of TREM-1 improves survival in animal models of sepsis. In this study, we show that curcumin or diferuloylmethane, a yellow pigment present in turmeric, a major ingredient of curry spice inhibited the expression of TREM-1 in vitro in primary bone marrow derived macrophages and in vivo in lungs of mice with sepsis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay confirmed that curcumin inhibits the binding of p65 to TREM-1 promoter in response to LPS. Further we show that curcumin inhibited p300 activity in the TREM-1 promoter region leading to hypoacetylation of histone 3 and 4 in the lysine residues. Inhibition of TREM-1 by curcumin is oxidant independent. These studies are the first report to define a detailed molecular mechanism by which curcumin exerts anti-inflammatory effects through regulation of TREM-1 gene activity and provide additional mechanistic insights into the anti-inflammatory effect of curcumin.

Abstract: Aiming at the development of a cost-effective and industrially up-scalable process for the production of p-Si PERL-type solar cells, this work focuses on the selection and the development of an optimal rear-contacting method of screen-printed aluminum back electrodes through AlOx-based rear passivation stacks. Laser-Fired Contacts are first optimized by developing dedicated characterization protocols to define an optimal laser process. Laser parameters are systematically varied (e.g. pulse energy, power density, focus, and contact pitch) and their effect on the contacts quality is analyzed. Besides, a new contacting method, called Extended-Laser-Ablation (ELA), is presented, allowing even higher efficiencies to be attained thanks to better quality of local back-surface fields. Both contacting routes are then implemented and compared in the PERL pilot production process flow to investigate their effects on cells performances. Top efficiencies of 19.13% (AlOx/SiNx) and 19.5% (SiO2/AlOx/SiNx) are reached when the ELA process is used on monocrystalline Cz Si, using a close-to-standard process (75Ω/sq homogeneous emitter, screen-printed contacts, standard cleaning procedure), without any final forming gas annealing step required.

Abstract: Surface passivation of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) films is critically influenced by the hydrogen/silane ratio during PECVD deposition. Das et al. (2008) studied this effect with respect to the crystal orientation of c-Si wafer substrates. We revisit the effect of the hydrogen/silane ratio and observe modifications compared to their study: we obtain VOC-values >710mV and find for textured and on (111)-oriented substrate surfaces that the effective carrier lifetime and VOC-values of solar cells benefit from increasing the hydrogen/silane ratio. The implied open-circuit voltages from lifetime measurements on our samples agree well with the final solar cell open-circuit voltages. We achieve high surface passivation, resulting in VOC>710mV and efficiencies up to 19.4% for 4cm2 solar cells.

Abstract: All cells of the musculoskeletal system possess transmembrane syndecan proteoglycans, notably syndecan-4. In fibroblasts it regulates integrin-mediated adhesion to the extracellular matrix. Syndecan-4 null mice have a complex wound repair phenotype while their fibroblasts have reduced focal adhesions and matrix contraction abilities. Signalling through syndecan-4 core protein to the actin cytoskeleton involves protein kinase Cα and Rho family G proteins but also direct interactions with α-actinin. The contribution of the latter interaction to cell–matrix adhesion is not defined but investigated here since manipulation of Rho GTPase and its downstream targets could not restore a wild type microfilament organisation to syndecan-4 null cells. Microarray and protein analysis revealed no significant alterations in mRNA or protein levels for actin- or α-actinin associated proteins when wild type and syndecan-4 knockout fibroblasts were compared. The binding site for syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain was identified as spectrin repeat 4 of α-actinin while further experiments confirmed the importance of this interaction in stabilising cell–matrix junctions. However, α-actinin is also present in adherens junctions, these organelles not being disrupted in the absence of syndecan-4. Indeed, co-culture of wild type and knockout cells led to adherens junction-associated stress fibre formation in cells lacking syndecan-4, supporting the hypothesis that the proteoglycan regulates cell–matrix adhesion and its associated microfilament bundles at a post-translational level. These data provide an additional dimension to syndecan function related to tension at the cell–matrix interface, wound healing and potentially fibrosis.

Abstract: Electrically conductive adhesives (ECAs) offer a low-temperature alternative to solder processes for interconnection of photovoltaic cells. The curing conversion of the ECA bond can significantly influence its mechanical performance and electrical conductivity. This study developed a method to measure ECA curing conversion in situ of interconnected solar cell assemblies. First, the relationship between the glass transition temperature (Tg) and the curing conversion was established using neat ECA specimens that were pre-cured to different degrees. Then, the torsional dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was used to measure the Tg of the actual ECA bond in the cell interconnect assemblies. Finally, the in situ curing conversion of the ECA bond was estimated through the Tg–conversion relationship. Regardless of the extremely high silver filler content (>70wt%) in a typical ECA and little material available in the actual bondline (∼10vol%), this method provided high sensitivity and ease of implementation.

Abstract: Hybrid solar cells based on metal oxides in combination with semiconducting polymers are offering potential as future low-cost and upscalable photovoltaics. However, the use of toxic solvents such as chlorobenzene, chloroform or toluene for the polymer processing, remains a drawback. In an effort to attain the summit of environmentally friendly device fabrication, in this work, fully water-based hybrid solar cells are fabricated. Metal oxide nanorod arrays, prepared via an aqueous synthesis, are used as electron acceptors, while the need for toxic solvents in polymer processing is circumvented by replacing the widely used poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) with its water-soluble counterpart poly(3-(potassium-4-hexanoate)thiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3PHT). Comparing two deposition techniques and two metal oxides leads to a promising efficiency of 0.2% for drop casted P3PHT in combination with rutile TiO2 nanorod arrays, and demonstrates the possibility to develop fully ‘green’ nanorod based hybrid solar cells.

Abstract: Water-based polymer nanoparticle dispersions offer the prospect of addressing two of the main challenges associated with printing large area organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices; namely how to control the nanoscale architecture of the active layer and eliminate the need for hazardous organic solvents during device fabrication. However, to date, the efficiencies of nanoparticulate-based devices have been inferior to that of the corresponding bulk-heterojunction devices. Here we present an approach for producing optimised OPV devices from polymer nanoparticles via the fabrication of multilayered device architectures. We show that by controlling both nanoparticle morphology and inter-particle interactions it is now possible to build polyfluorene OPV devices from aqueous dispersions of nanoparticles that are more efficient than the corresponding bulk heterojunction devices. In particular we show that: (1) the polyfluorene nanoparticle morphology is suited to effective charge separation, (2) thermal treatment of the deposited layers results in improved interparticle connectivity and effective charge transport, and (3) the optimal device thickness is a delicate balance between the repair of layer defects and the creation of stress cracking in the nanoparticulate film. As such, this work offers insights for the development of printable photovoltaic devices based on water-dispersed nanoparticulate formulations.

Abstract: We apply the approach of dynamic photoluminescence lifetime imaging to a multicrystalline silicon brick. The dynamic approach allows the calibration-free determination of the bulk carrier lifetime of silicon bricks prior to wafer sawing. Using an indium gallium arsenide camera, we determine the bulk lifetime from the time-dependent luminescence emission for a modulated optical excitation. A ratio, including four photoluminescence images, acquired at different times during the modulated excitation, is calculated and found to depend on the camera integration time and the bulk lifetime. We demonstrate that the exact value of the surface recombination and the thickness of the brick are not required for the determination of the bulk carrier lifetime with the dynamic photoluminescence technique. The bulk lifetime is obtained locally by comparing the experimentally determined ratio with the simulated ratio for each image pixel. Since we are investigating the ratio of photoluminescence images containing information of the time dependence of the excess carriers, the doping-dependent luminescence emission has not to be corrected for the typical height-dependent doping variations. Therefore, the dynamic photoluminescence lifetime imaging technique is well suited for the investigation of bricks.

Abstract: With the purpose of assessing the absorption coefficients of quantum dot solar cells, symmetry considerations are introduced into a Hamiltonian whose eigenvalues are empirical. In this way, the proper transformation from the Hamiltonian’s diagonalized form to the form that relates it with Γ-point exact solutions through k.p envelope functions is built accounting for symmetry. Forbidden transitions are thus determined reducing the calculation burden and permitting a thoughtful discussion of the possible options for this transformation. The agreement of this model with the measured external quantum efficiency of a prototype solar cell is found to be excellent.

Abstract: Cells contain low amounts of uracil in DNA which can be the result of dUTP misincorporation during replication or cytosine deamination. Elimination of uracil in the base excision repair pathway yields an abasic site, which is potentially mutagenic unless repaired. The Trypanosoma brucei genome presents a single uracil-DNA glycosylase responsible for removal of uracil from DNA. Here we establish that no excision activity is detected on U:G, U:A pairs or single-strand uracil-containing DNA in uracil-DNA glycosylase null mutant cell extracts, indicating the absence of back-up uracil excision activities. While procyclic forms can survive with moderate amounts of uracil in DNA, an analysis of the mutation rate and spectra in mutant cells revealed a hypermutator phenotype where the predominant events were GC to AT transitions and insertions. Defective elimination of uracil via the base excision repair pathway gives rise to hypersensitivity to antifolates and oxidative stress and an increased number of DNA strand breaks, suggesting the activation of alternative DNA repair pathways. Finally, we show that uracil-DNA glycosylase defective cells exhibit reduced infectivity in vivo demonstrating that efficient uracil elimination is important for survival within the mammalian host.

Abstract: Endothelin-1 (ET-1), predominantly produced by vascular endothelial cells (VECs), plays an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. Liver X receptor (LXR), a typical nuclear receptor, is known for inhibiting expression of inflammatory molecules. However, it remains unclear whether LXR suppresses ET-1 expression. In the present study, we showed that pretreatment with GW3965, a specific ligand of LXR, significantly attenuated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ET-1 in mice plasma. The in vitro experiments showed that both LXRα and β were expressed in human VECs, and they are functional as demonstrated by induction of the target gene ABCA1 after treatment with GW3965. Moreover, activation of LXR with GW3965 in human VECs dramatically attenuated the basal and LPS-stimulated ET-1 production at both transcriptional and translational levels. Luciferase reporter assays indicated that LXR activation suppressed the transcriptional activity of the human ET-1 gene promoter, and repressed the activity of a heterologous promoter driven by the response elements of activator-1 (AP-1) or nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that activation of LXR reduced the binding of the transcriptional factors AP-1 and NF-κB to the ET-1 gene promoter region. In conclusion, activation of LXR represses ET-1 expression in vivo and in vitro, which may be involved in the negatively interfering with AP-1/NF-κB signaling. These results suggest that LXRs may serve as a novel molecular target for modulating ET-1 expression in VECs, and even for the treatment of ET-1-associated inflammatory diseases.

Abstract: The vitamin A derivative retinoic acid (RA) is an important regulator of mammalian adiposity and lipid metabolism, primarily acting at the gene expression level through nuclear receptors of the RA receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) subfamilies. Here, we studied cell-autonomous effects of RA on fatty acid metabolism, particularly fatty acid oxidation, in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. Exposure to all-trans RA (ATRA) up-regulated the expression of carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 (CPT1-L) in HepG2 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and increased cellular oxidation rate of exogenously added radiolabeled palmitate. The effect of ATRA on gene expression of CPT1-L was: dependent on ongoing transcription, reproduced by both 9-cis RA and a pan-RXR agonist (but not a pan-RAR agonist) and abolished following RXRα partial siRNA-mediated silencing. CPT1-L gene expression was synergistically induced in HepG2 cells simultaneously exposed to ATRA and a selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α agonist. We conclude that ATRA treatment enhances fatty acid catabolism in hepatocytes through RXR-mediated mechanisms that likely involve the transactivation of the PPARα:RXR heterodimer. Knowledge of agents and nutrient-derivatives capable of enhancing substrate oxidation systemically and specifically in liver, and their mechanisms of action, may contribute to new avenues of prevention and treatment of fatty liver, obesity and other metabolic syndrome-related disorders.

Abstract: In this study, we demonstrate fully solution processed semi-transparent silver electrodes on flexible substrates having a sheet resistance as low as 5Ω/□ and transmittance of ∼30% at 550nm. We demonstrate the use of this electrode as a substitute for ITO in an inverted organic solar cell (OSC) with the layer sequence, PET/Ag/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS/Ag where illumination is achieved through the first Ag layer. Power conversion efficiency of up to 1.6% under 1 sun illumination (100mWcm−2 and AM1.5G) is achieved for small area (1cm2) test devices. We further demonstrate scalability of the semi-transparent Ag electrode fabrication in a roll-to-roll (R2R) process using slot-die coating. This electrode is further utilized in R2R processing of large area modules (active area 35.5cm2) where all layers in the modules are R2R processed with solution-based materials in ambient conditions without any use of vacuum steps. We further demonstrate the possibility of using barrier foil as the substrate in the R2R processing of modules. Module performance is evaluated by current–voltage characterization and Light Beam Induced Current (LBIC imaging). Such a semi-transparent Ag electrode incurs very little material and processing cost and is a cost-effective alternative to ITO for low-cost organic solar cells.

Abstract: In contrast to traditional steady-state photoluminescence imaging (PLI), time-resolved photoluminescence imaging (TR-PLI) allows for a calibration-free measurement of the effective transient minority charge carrier lifetime τeff in a silicon sample. For transient photoluminescence measurements, the illumination source as well as the camera signal have to be modulated on a time-scale in the order of τeff. Different approaches for camera signal modulation have been presented, including the use of a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) camera or a rotating shutter wheel. In this work, the use of an InGaAs-based image intensifier unit as a fast optical shutter for TR-PLI was evaluated. Due to the fast switching times of the image intensifier, effective lifetimes down to 1/50 of the modulation period could be resolved reliably. Measurements under different illumination conditions allow for an injection-dependant analysis of τeff and comparison to photoconductance decay measurements.

Abstract: Changes in systemic acid–base homeostasis cause a series of organ-specific cellular responses, among them changes of acid–base transporter activities, and recruitment or retrieval of these transporters from intracellular pools to the plasma membrane and vice versa. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of protein phosphorylation in the acidosis-induced translocation of vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) in salivary ducts and to identify molecular targets. Therefore, the human submandibular gland cell line HSG was exposed to acidosis and V-ATPase trafficking was investigated in the presence or absence of inhibitors and activators of sAC/PKA and Src/ERK signaling pathways. Putative target genes have been identified by RT-PCR and immunoblotting, and validated by loss-of-function experiments. Acidosis caused activation of cAMP/PKA and Src signaling and inhibition of either pathway significantly impaired acidosis-induced V-ATPase redistribution and incorporation into the plasma membrane. Activation of ERK1/2 was Src-independent, whereas activation of PKA caused phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding (CREB) and activation to regulate Rab11b transcription. Loss-of-function of CREB down-regulated Rab11b transcript and protein and significantly impaired acidosis-induced V-ATPase translocation in HSG cells. These data demonstrate that the cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling pathway initiates acidosis-induced V-ATPase trafficking in salivary ducts via regulation of Rab11b expression and provide first evidence for a molecular mechanism underlying cAMP/PKA-dependent transporter trafficking that could account for accumulation and activity of transporters in other cellular systems as well.

Abstract: A new HfMoN(H)/HfMoN(L)/HfON/Al2O3 tandem absorber is designed and developed for high temperature solar thermal applications. The first absorber layer, HfMoN(H) is designed to have higher metallic content than the second HfMoN(L) layer. By varying the nitrogen flow rate, two different HfMoN layers with different refractive indices were deposited on SS substrates. The optical constants (n and k) measured using spectroscopic ellipsometry showed that HfMoN(H) and HfMoN(L) are the main absorber layers and HfON/Al2O3 acts as a double layer antireflection coating. The gradual decrease in the refractive indices from the substrate to the top resulted in increase in the absorptance, which was confirmed by the ellipsometric measurements. The optimized four layer tandem absorber exhibited high absorptance (α=0.94–0.95) and low thermal emittance (ε82°C=0.13–0.14). The four layer tandem absorber was thermally stable up to 600°C for 450h and 650°C for 100h in vacuum. Whereas, coatings heat-treated in air were thermally stable up to 475°C for 34h.

Abstract: The interface property has been one of the critical issues in developing hybrid polymer/metal oxide solar cells. We synthesize a conjugated oligomer, an amine- and bromine-terminated 3-hexyl thiophene (O3HT-(Br)NH2), to modify the ZnO-nanorod (ZnO-NR) surface in hybrid polymer/ZnO-NR photovoltaic cells. This oligomer is of the same repeat unit structure as and ∼1/12 the contour length of that of the light-harvesting polymer. In addition to passivate the NR surface, the presence of this conjugated oligomer enhances the electron mobility, and drives larger hole density toward the anodic surface for collection. The improved charge transport property of the hybrid is presumably a result of modulating the nanomorphology of the bi-carrier transport network induced by the conjugated oligomer. As a result, there is a large enhancement in photocurrent and photovoltage leading to an improved device performance of ∼35%.

Abstract: To estimate the axial variation of resistivity in the silicon ingot directionally solidified with n-type UMG silicon material, the actual axial dopant concentration variations were measured and compared with simulated results. The simulation was conducted with segregation equations. It was found that the segregation coefficients (keff) of the doping impurities in this directional solidification were very close to the segregation coefficients of doping impurities in normal freezing (k0). With these segregation coefficients, the axial variation of resistivity was estimated with the PC1D program for various combinations of boron and phosphorous content in a silicon material. It was expected that the phosphorous content in the silicon material would be more determinative than the boron content in the enlargement of the useful portion of the silicon ingot for solar cell fabrication.

Abstract: We investigate the potential of Nd doped SrTiO3 films for the photon downshifting of ultraviolet photons to infrared ones. We first studied the structural properties of such newly developed layers grown by pulsed laser deposition (PLD). We also show that these layers allow the conversion of photons from 250–350nm excitation to around 900nm. We implemented the optimized Nd:SrTiO3 thin films on a conventional silicon solar cell and we show that the internal quantum efficiency is increased at around 350nm which validates the concept of downshifting applied to solar cells. Future work will be to determine if downconversion takes place in this system.

Abstract: As a result from the development of silicon thin-film solar cells that had been conducted at Applied Materials over the last few years, we present a new kind of microcrystalline silicon oxide (μc-SiOx:H) based p-layer for the application in amorphous/microcrystalline (a-Si:H/μc-Si:H) tandem solar cells on ZnO substrates. The refractive index of this p-layer can be adjusted in the range 2–3.5 and therefore serves as a refractive index matching layer between ZnO (n∼2) and silicon (n∼4). By applying such a layer the reflection of solar cells can be reduced to 3%. This results in a significant short circuit current increase in thin-film solar cells. As a follow up to the recently published results of large area thin film silicon modules by us [1], [2], we describe in this paper in detail the material properties of this new silicon oxide p-layer, the optimization of electrical and optical properties in solar cells and also the impact on the light induced degradation of a-Si/μc-Si tandem junction cells.

Abstract: We contact p-type wafers and boron-diffused layers by laser ablation of a passivating aluminum oxide and silicon nitride stack and subsequent in-line high-rate evaporation of aluminum. We measure saturation current densities at the base contacts of 2.5×106–1.9×107fA/cm2 for base resistivities of 0.5–3.8Ωcm and 491–905fA/cm2 for the contacts to boron-diffused layers of sheet resistances of 23–86Ω/sq. The contact resistivity of Al layers to p-type silicon with surface doping densities of 4×1015–3×1019cm−3 is in the range of 4–0.1mΩcm2, respectively. The measured contact properties allow for the fabrication of highly efficient ‘passivated emitter and rear cells’ (PERC) and ‘passivated emitter and rear totally diffused cells’ (PERT). Numerical simulations show that evaporated rear contacts in combination with screen printed contacts at the front allow for energy conversion efficiencies of 20.6% and of 21.1%, for PERC and PERT cells, respectively. The simulated free energy losses show that such cells are not limited by the in-line evaporated point contacts on the rear side.

Abstract: S100A8 and S100A9 are strongly expressed in epithelial cells of human prostate cancer. However, the regulation of their expression is unclear. Here we show that S100A8 and to a lesser extent S100A9 mRNA expression is induced by prostaglandin E2 in a dose and time-dependent manner in PC-3 prostate cancer cells as well as in BPH-1 benign prostatic epithelial cells. Prostanoid receptor EP2 antagonist AH6809 and EP4 antagonist AH23848, as well as protein kinase A inhibitor H89, inhibited prostaglandin E2 mediated increase in S100A8 mRNA expression as well as promoter activity. Sequence analysis detected a potential binding site of the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding-protein-beta within the proximal S100A8 promoter. CCAAT/enhancer-binding-protein-beta overexpression increased S100A8 mRNA and protein expression as well as its promoter activity. The latter was prevented by mutation of the potential CCAAT/enhancer-binding-protein-beta binding site within the S100A8 promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed increased binding of CCAAT/enhancer-binding-protein-beta to the S100A8 promoter in prostaglandin E2 treated cells. Knockdown of CCAAT/enhancer-binding-protein-beta by siRNA blocked prostaglandin E2 mediated induction of S100A8 promoter activity and mRNA expression. Our results indicate that in prostate cancer cells, S100A8 expression is stimulated by prostaglandin E2 via EP2 and EP4 receptors through activation of the protein kinase A signaling pathway and subsequent stimulation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding-protein-beta binding to the S100A8 promoter.

BRCA1-dependent Chk1 phosphorylation triggers partial chromatin disassociation of phosphorylated Chk1 and facilitates S-phase cell cycle arrest,

Abstract: Chk1 phosphorylation by the PI3-like kinases ATR and ATM is critical for its activation and its role in prevention of premature mitotic entry in response to DNA damage or stalled replication. The breast and ovarian tumor suppressor, BRCA1, is among several checkpoint mediators that are required for Chk1 activation by ATM and ATR. Previously we showed that BRCA1 is necessary for Chk1 phosphorylation and activation following ionizing radiation. BRCA1 has been implicated in S-phase checkpoint control yet its mechanism of action is not well characterized. Here we report that BRCA1 is critical for Chk1 phosphorylation in response to inhibition of replication by either cisplatin or hydroxyurea. While Chk1 phosphorylation of S317 is fully dependent on BRCA1, additional proteins may mediate S345 phosphorylation at later time points. In addition, we show that a subset of phosphorylated Chk1 is released from the chromatin in a BRCA1-dependent manner which may lead to the phosphorylation of Chk1 substrate, Cdc25C, on S216 and to S-phase checkpoint activation. Inhibition of Chk1 kinase by UCN-01 or expression of Chk1 phosphorylation mutants in which the serine residues were substituted with alanine residues abrogates BRCA1-dependent cell cycle arrest in response replication inhibition. These data reveal that BRCA1 facilitates Chk1 phosphorylation and its partial chromatin dissociation following replication inhibition that is likely to be required for S-phase checkpoint signaling.

Cytochrome P450scc-dependent metabolism of 7-dehydrocholesterol in placenta and epidermal keratinocytes,

Abstract: The discovery that 7-dehydrocholesterol (7DHC) is an excellent substrate for cytochrome P450scc (CYP11A1) opens up new possibilities in biochemistry. To elucidate its biological significance we tested ex vivo P450scc-dependent metabolism of 7DHC by tissues expressing high and low levels of P450scc activity, placenta and epidermal keratinocytes, respectively. Incubation of human placenta fragments with 7DHC led to its conversion to 7-dehydropregnenolone (7DHP), which was inhibited by dl-aminoglutethimide, and stimulated by forskolin. Final proof for P450scc involvement was provided in isolated placental mitochondria where production of 7DHP was almost completely inhibited by 22R-hydroxycholesterol. 7DHC was metabolized by placental mitochondria at a faster rate than exogenous cholesterol, under both limiting and saturating conditions of substrate transport, consistent with higher catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) with 7DHC as substrate than with cholesterol. Ex vivo experiments showed five 5,7-dienal intermediates with MS spectra of dihydroxy and mono-hydroxy-7DHC and retention time corresponding to 20,22(OH)27DHC and 22(OH)7DHC. The chemical structure of 20,22(OH)27DHC was defined by NMR. 7DHP was further metabolized by either placental fragments or placental microsomes to 7-dehydroprogesterone as defined by UV, MS and NMR, and to an additional product with a 5,7-dienal structure and MS corresponding to hydroxy-7DHP. Furthermore, epidermal keratinocytes transformed either exogenous or endogenous 7DHC to 7DHP. 7DHP inhibited keratinocytes proliferation, while the product of its pholytic transformation, pregcalciferol, lost this capability. In conclusion, tissues expressing P450scc can metabolize 7DHC to biologically active 7DHP with 22(OH)7DHC and 20,22(OH)27DHC serving as intermediates, and with further metabolism to 7-dehydroprogesterone and (OH)7DHP.

Abstract: Deficiencies in maternal diet, such as inadequate intake of folate, can inhibit normal development and lead to developmental defects. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) may play a role in mediating the effects of folate deficiency in the growing mammalian embryo, although conclusive evidences to support that possibility are not yet available. The goal of the present study was to investigate whether and how folate deprivation alters the properties of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) in culture. For this purpose, mESCs were cultured in folate-deficient or complete culture medium. The results show that folate-deficient mESCs have a significantly higher rate of apoptosis, accumulate in G0/G1 and fail to proliferate. Expression profiling revealed several miRs and many mRNAs are differently expressed in folate-deficient cells. RT-PCR data confirmed differential expressions of 12 miRNAs in folate-deficient cells. Furthermore, bioinformatics analyses and in vitro studies suggested that miR-302a plays a critical role in mediating the effects of folate on cell proliferation and cell cycle-specific apoptosis by targeting Lats2 gene. Together, these results suggest that the effects of folate deficiency on mammalian development may be mediated by miRNAs that regulate proliferation and/or cell cycle progression in ESCs.

Abstract: In this work, we further investigate a new strategy to passivate and contact the rear side of p-type c-Si solar cells based on the laser processing of aluminum oxide (Al2O3)/amorphous silicon carbide (SiCx) stacks before rear metallization. For this stack, surface passivation of outstanding quality is obtained with effective surface recombination velocities in the 1cm/s range on 〈100〉 FZ 2.3Ωcm p-type substrates. The dielectric stack is processed with a 1064nm laser defining square matrixes of spots where the dielectric film is opened. Simultaneously, part of the aluminum contained in the Al2O3 film is locally introduced into the c-Si, creating a p+ region. The presence of a SiCx capping layer onto the Al2O3 helps in the formation of this local back surface field reducing surface recombination velocity at the contacts to ∼2×103cm/s. This new technique is applied to 2×2cm2 solar cells leading to photovoltaic conversion efficiencies well beyond 20% on 0.5 and 2.3Ωcm substrates.

Abstract: We have previously found in human renal proximal tubular HK-2 cells that hypoxia- and all-trans retinoic acid-induced hypoxia-inducible factor-1α up-regulation is accompanied by retinoic acid receptor-β up-regulation. Here we first investigated whether hypoxia-inducible factor-1α expression is dependent on retinoic acid receptor-β and our results confirmed it since (i) hypoxia-inducible factor-1α-inducing agents hypoxia, hypoxia-mimetic agent desferrioxamine, all-trans retinoic acid and interleukin-1β increased retinoic acid receptor-β expression, (ii) hypoxia-inducible factor-1α up-regulation was prevented by retinoic acid receptor-β antagonist LE-135 or siRNA retinoic acid receptor-β and (iii) there was direct binding of retinoic acid receptor-β to the retinoic acid response element in hypoxia-inducible factor-1α promoter upon treatment with all-trans retinoic acid and 16,16-dimethyl-prostaglandin E2. Since intracellular prostaglandin E2 mediates hypoxia-inducible factor-1α up-regulation in normoxia in HK-2 cells, we next investigated and confirmed, its role in the up-regulation of retinoic acid receptor-β in normoxia by hypoxia-inducible factor-1α-inducing agents all-trans retinoic acid, interleukin-1β and 16,16-dimethyl-prostaglandin E2 by inhibiting cyclooxygenases, prostaglandin influx transporter or EP receptors. Interestingly, the hypoxia-induced increase in retinoic acid receptor-β expression and accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α was also blocked by the inhibitors tested. This is the first time, to our knowledge, that retinoic acid receptor-β signalling is involved in the control of the expression of transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1α in both normoxia and hypoxia and that retinoic acid receptor-β expression is found to be strictly regulated by intracellular prostaglandin E2. Given the relevance of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α in the kidney in terms of tumorigenesis, progressive renal failure, production of erythropoietin and protection in several models of renal disease, our results open new therapeutic opportunities on the control of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α based upon the pharmacological modulation of retinoic acid receptor-β, either directly or through the control of intracellular prostaglandin E2 levels/signalling.

Abstract: Two linear-type π-conjugated small molecules based on thiophene and benzothiadiazole, β-DH5TB(1) and β-DH5TB(2), were synthesized using the Suzuki coupling reaction to have β-substituted solubilizing alkyl groups. The solubility of β-DH5TBs was significantly improved by changing the direction of the alkyl group compared to α-substituted oligothiophene (α-DH5TB). The relationship between the alkyl substitution pattern and the photovoltaic properties was investigated by measuring the optical and electrochemical properties and the film morphology. Among them, the 4-hexyl substituted β-DH5TB(2) showed the lowest optical band gap and HOMO level together with a red-shifted broad UV absorption. In addition, a high degree of molecular alignment was also observed in β-DH5TB(2), indicative of good charge transport. The β-DH5TB(2) film showed higher field-effect mobility (μFET) of 6.28×10−4cm2V−1s−1 than β-DH5TB(1) film. Owing to the improved solubility, two of the synthesized β-DH5TBs could be used as donor materials in solution-processed organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs), whereas the α-DH5TB:PC71BM blend film showed no photovoltaic properties due to the poor solubility of α-DH5TB. The improved absorption and molecular alignment of the β-DH5TB(2) yielded a device efficiency (0.98%) higher than that of β-DH5TB(1).

Abstract: The measurement of the cell temperature in HCPV modules, due to the special features of these types of modules, is a very complex task. Nowadays, some methods to calculate the cell temperature are available. These methods have turned out to be very exact, but are usually too complex or require the use of data which are difficult to get. The aim of this paper is to find a simple expression that allows easy calculation of the cell temperature of a HCPV module, without very high error, by using readily available parameters. To achieve this objective, several atmospheric parameters and the cell temperature of a HCPV module have been measured for a year in a research center located in the south of Spain. Results show that the proposed expression could be used for estimating the cell temperature of a HCPV module from atmospheric parameters with a root mean square error of 7.4%.

Abstract: Heat transfer characteristic during crystallization of the phase change material (PCM) dispersed inside an emulsion is investigated theoretically and experimentally by using Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) technique. The dispersed PCMs are hexadecane, octadecane and water. Nucleation laws are used to simulate the supercooling phenomenon. The results indicate that the crystallization of the droplets stabilizes the emulsion temperature at a value corresponding to that at which probability of crystallization J(T) increases rapidly. To describe with accuracy the thermal properties of the PCM using DSC technique it is more appropriate to represent these properties versus the sample temperature and not as function of the plate temperature of DSC.
