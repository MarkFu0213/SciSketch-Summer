Abstract: Summary
The molecular mechanisms underlying the clinical manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and what distinguishes them from common seasonal influenza virus and other lung injury states such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, remain poorly understood. To address these challenges, we combine transcriptional profiling of 646 clinical nasopharyngeal swabs and 39 patient autopsy tissues to define body-wide transcriptome changes in response to COVID-19. We then match these data with spatial protein and expression profiling across 357 tissue sections from 16 representative patient lung samples and identify tissue-compartment-specific damage wrought by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, evident as a function of varying viral loads during the clinical course of infection and tissue-type-specific expression states. Overall, our findings reveal a systemic disruption of canonical cellular and transcriptional pathways across all tissues, which can inform subsequent studies to combat the mortality of COVID-19 and to better understand the molecular dynamics of lethal SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infections.

Abstract: Summary
Regenerative medicine relies on basic research outcomes that are only practical when cost effective. The human eyeball requires the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) to interface the neural retina and the choroid at large. Millions of people suffer from age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a blinding multifactor genetic disease among RPE degradation pathologies. Recently, autologous pluripotent stem-cell-derived RPE cells were prohibitively expensive due to time; therefore, we developed a faster reprogramming system. We stably induced RPE-like cells (iRPE) from human fibroblasts (Fibs) by conditional overexpression of both broad plasticity and lineage-specific transcription factors (TFs). iRPE cells displayed critical RPE benchmarks and significant in vivo integration in transplanted retinas. Herein, we detail the iRPE system with comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) profiling to interpret and characterize its best cells. We anticipate that our system may enable robust retinal cell induction for basic research and affordable autologous human RPE tissue for regenerative cell therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) commonly have manifestations of heart disease. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome encodes 27 proteins. Currently, SARS-CoV-2 gene-induced abnormalities of human heart muscle cells remain elusive. Here, we comprehensively characterized the detrimental effects of a SARS-CoV-2 gene, Orf9c, on human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) by preforming multi-omic analyses. Transcriptomic analyses of hPSC-CMs infected by SARS-CoV-2 with Orf9c overexpression (Orf9cOE) identified concordantly up-regulated genes enriched into stress-related apoptosis and inflammation signaling pathways, and down-regulated CM functional genes. Proteomic analysis revealed enhanced expressions of apoptotic factors, whereas reduced protein factors for ATP synthesis by Orf9cOE. Orf9cOE significantly reduced cellular ATP level, induced apoptosis, and caused electrical dysfunctions of hPSC-CMs. Finally, drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, namely, ivermectin and meclizine, restored ATP levels and ameliorated CM death and functional abnormalities of Orf9cOE hPSC-CMs. Overall, we defined the molecular mechanisms underlying the detrimental impacts of Orf9c on hPSC-CMs and explored potentially therapeutic approaches to ameliorate Orf9c-induced cardiac injury and abnormalities.

Abstract: Tripartite motif containing 21 (TRIM21) is a member of the TRIM protein family with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Recent studies have demonstrated that TRIM21 widely contributes to physiological and pathological processes by ubiquitylating critical proteins in many kinds of cells. Additionally, multiple studies have shown that TRIM21 plays an important role in multiple cell differentiation processes. However, whether TRIM21 modulates the osteogenic differentiation process of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that the expression of TRIM21 was decreased during the osteogenic process of MSCs and that TRIM21 negatively regulated the osteogenic capacity of MSCs both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we further demonstrated that TRIM21 modulated the osteogenic process of MSCs by acting as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to mediate the K48-linked ubiquitination of Akt and cause degradation. In summary, these results emphasize the critical role of TRIM21 in bone formation and TRIM21 may be a promising target to improve the clinical use of MSCs in tissue engineering.

Abstract: Having broad specificity for xenobiotics metabolism throughout the body, cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoform 1A1 is of key relevance for carcinogenesis. However, the oncogenic potential of its altered transcription and the underlying mechanism has not been well-established in breast cancer. Direct bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP) of the CYP1A1 promoter, enriched by 113 CpGs within and flanking the xenobiotic response elements (XREs) 2 to 10, in paired cancerous and normal tissues from 40 breast cancer patients revealed three distinctly methylated patterns; unmethylated (XREs 2 to 6) and completely methylated (XREs 7 and 8) CpGs, in common for the normal and cancerous tissues, and a putative 171bp CpG block (XREs 9 and 10) contiguously hypermethylated in the tumor tissues. Increased transcription of CYP1A1, observed for the cancerous tissues, was correlated with the hypermethylation of given CpG block, besides simultaneously being associated with upregulation of the anti-apoptotic BCL-2. Clinical value of the methylation changes, investigated based on the comparisons between the tissue cohorts of different clinicopathological features, exhibited gradual hypermethylation of the corresponding CpG block following disease progression as well as lymphatic involvement. Hypermethylation of given CpG block may has potential to be used as a biomarker for diagnosis and progression of breast cancer.

Abstract: LINC010503 is a novel oncogenic lncRNA in multiple cancers. In this study, we further explored the expression of LINC010503 transcripts and their regulations on the glioblastoma (GBM) stem cell (GSC) properties. LINC01503 transcription patterns in GBM and normal brain tissues were compared using RNA-seq data from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-GBM. GBM cell lines (U251 and U87) were used as in vitro cell models for cellular and molecular studies. The results showed that ENST00000444125 was the dominant transcript of LINC01503 in both normal and tumor tissues. Its expression was significantly elevated in the tumor group and associated with poor survival outcomes. LINC01503 had both cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution. It positively modulated the expression of multiple GSC markers, including CD133, SOX2, NESTIN, ALDH1A1, and MSI1, and tumorsphere formation in U251 and U87 cells. RNA pull-down and RIP-qPCR assay confirmed an interaction between ENST00000444125 and GLI2. ENST00000444125 positively regulated the half-life of the GLI2 protein in GBM cells. ENST00000444125 overexpression reduced GLI2 ubiquitination and partially attenuated FBXW1 overexpression induced GLI2 ubiquitination. ENST00000444125 overexpression could activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling in GBM cells. However, these activating effects were remarkedly hampered when GLI2 was knocked down. In conclusion, this study revealed that LINC01503 might have isoform-specific dysregulation in GBM. Among the two major transcripts expressed in GBM cells, ENST00000444125 might be the major functional transcript. Its upregulation might enhance the GSC properties of GBM cells via reducing FBXW1-mediated proteasomal degradation of GLI2.

Abstract: Summary
Human health and disease have increasingly been shown to be impacted by the gut microbiota, and mouse models are essential for investigating these effects. However, the compositions of human and mouse gut microbiotas are distinct, limiting translation of microbiota research between these hosts. To address this, we constructed the Mouse Gastrointestinal Bacteria Catalogue (MGBC), a repository of 26,640 high-quality mouse microbiota-derived bacterial genomes. This catalog enables species-level analyses for mapping functions of interest and identifying functionally equivalent taxa between the microbiotas of humans and mice. We have complemented this with a publicly deposited collection of 223 bacterial isolates, including 62 previously uncultured species, to facilitate experimental investigation of individual commensal bacteria functions in vitro and in vivo. Together, these resources provide the ability to identify and test functionally equivalent members of the host-specific gut microbiotas of humans and mice and support the informed use of mouse models in human microbiota research.

Abstract: Metastasis is responsible for most of the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)–associated death. However, its underlying mechanism has yet to be fully elucidated. Glycolysis-derived lactate has been shown to be a powerful regulator of cancer metastasis. Heat shock protein A12A (HSPA12A) encodes a novel member of HSP70 family. We have recently demonstrated that heat shock protein A12A (HSPA12A) inhibited renal cancer cell migration by suppressing lactate output and glycolytic activity, which were mediated by unstabilizing CD147 and promoting its degradation. By striking contrast, here we demonstrated that HSPA12A promoted migration of human HCC cells. Extracellular acidification, lactate export, and glycolytic activity in HCC cells were also promoted following HSPA12A overexpression. Further analysis revealed that HSPA12A interacted with MCT4 and increased its membrane localization, thereby promoting export of lactate generated from glycolysis; this led, ultimately, to HCC cell migration. Our results revealed the opposite effect of HSPA12A on migration of renal cancer cells and that of HCC cells. Of note, in contrast to the inhibitory effect on CD147 expression in renal cancer cells, we found that HSPA12A increased CD147 expression in HCC cells, indicating that the expression of CD147 might exist heterogeneity in different cancer cell types. Taken together, we identified HSPA12A as an activator of HCC migration, a role opposite to that of renal cancer cells. Inhibiting HSPA12A might be a potential therapeutic intervention for HCC metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Reprogramming of murine female somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is accompanied by X chromosome reactivation (XCR), by which the inactive X chromosome (Xi) in female somatic cells becomes reactivated. However, how Xi initiates reactivation during reprogramming remains poorly defined. Here, we used a Sendai virus-based reprogramming system to generate partially reprogrammed iPSCs that appear to be undergoing the initial phase of XCR. Allele-specific RNA-seq of these iPSCs revealed that XCR initiates at a subset of genes clustered near the centromere region. The initial phase of XCR occurs when the cells transit through mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) before complete shutoff of Xist expression. Moreover, regulatory regions of these genes display dynamic changes in lysine-demethylase 1a (KDM1A) occupancy. Our results identified clustered genes on the Xi that show reactivation in the initial phase of XCR during reprogramming and suggest a possible role for histone demethylation in this process.

Abstract: Summary
To understand the determinants of long-term immune responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the concurrent impact of vaccination and emerging variants, we follow a prospective cohort of 332 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) over more than a year after symptom onset. We evaluate plasma-neutralizing activity using HIV-based pseudoviruses expressing the spike of different SARS-CoV-2 variants and analyze them longitudinally using mixed-effects models. Long-term neutralizing activity is stable beyond 1 year after infection in mild/asymptomatic and hospitalized participants. However, longitudinal models suggest that hospitalized individuals generate both short- and long-lived memory B cells, while the responses of non-hospitalized individuals are dominated by long-lived B cells. In both groups, vaccination boosts responses to natural infection. Long-term (>300 days from infection) responses in unvaccinated participants show a reduced efficacy against beta, but not alpha nor delta, variants. Multivariate analysis identifies the severity of primary infection as an independent determinant of higher magnitude and lower relative cross-neutralization activity of long-term neutralizing responses.

Abstract: Cytoskeleton-associated protein 2-like (CKAP2L) is a mitotic spindle protein and its high expression is reported to be associated with the poor prognosis of cancer patients. Interestingly, TNMplot website analysis indicated that CKAP2L expression was significantly higher in breast cancer (BC) tissues than in normal breast tissues (P < 0.001). Thus, this study was conducted to investigate the role of CKAP2L in breast carcinogenesis and its underlying molecular mechanisms. The mRNA and protein expression levels of CKAP2L in 40 paired fresh BC and para-carcinoma specimens were first analyzed, and the results confirmed the high expression of CKAP2L in BC tissues. Functional studies revealed that CKAP2L silencing dramatically suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion, induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of BC cells in vitro, and inhibited the growth of xenografted tumors in vivo. However, CKAP2L overexpression produced the opposite results. Mechanically, CKAP2L could activate the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in BC cells accompanied by increased phosphorylation levels of AKT, mTOR, and p70S6K in CKAP2L-overexpressed cells. Forkhead box protein P3 (FOXP3), a transcription factor with tumor-suppressive properties, was proved to negatively regulate CKAP2L expression in BC cells through binding to the promoter of CKAP2L and inhibiting its transcription. In summary, the present study demonstrates that CKAP2L, transcriptionally regulated by FOXP3, activates the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and promotes breast carcinogenesis. CKAP2L may serve as a promising target of therapeutic intervention for BC.

Abstract: Summary
The induction of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes by STATs is a critical host defense mechanism against virus infection. Here, we report that a highly expressed poxvirus protein, 018, inhibits IFN-induced signaling by binding to the SH2 domain of STAT1, thereby preventing the association of STAT1 with an activated IFN receptor. Despite encoding other inhibitors of IFN-induced signaling, a poxvirus mutant lacking 018 was attenuated in mice. The 2.0 Å crystal structure of the 018:STAT1 complex reveals a phosphotyrosine-independent mode of 018 binding to the SH2 domain of STAT1. Moreover, the STAT1-binding motif of 018 shows similarity to the STAT1-binding proteins from Nipah virus, which, similar to 018, block the association of STAT1 with an IFN receptor. Overall, these results uncover a conserved mechanism of STAT1 antagonism that is employed independently by distinct virus families.

Abstract: Summary
The horizontal basal cells (HBCs) of olfactory epithelium (OE) serve as reservoirs for stem cells during OE regeneration, through proliferation and differentiation, which is important in recovery of olfactory function. However, the molecular mechanism of regulation of HBC proliferation and differentiation after injury remains unclear. Here, we found that yes-associated protein (YAP) was upregulated and activated in HBCs after OE injury. Deletion of YAP in HBCs led to impairment in OE regeneration and functional recovery of olfaction after injury. Mechanically, YAP was activated by S1P/S1PR2 signaling, thereby promoting the proliferation of HBCs and OE regeneration after injury. Finally, activation of YAP signaling enhanced the proliferation of HBCs and improved functional recovery of olfaction after OE injury or in Alzheimer's disease model mice. Taken together, these results reveal an S1P/S1PR2/YAP pathway in OE regeneration in response to injury, providing a promising therapeutic strategy for OE injury.

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most lethal types of primary brain tumors in adults with a median survival of less than 15 months. Although comprehensive clinical treatment strategies including surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy are widely applied, the prognosis for GBM patients remains dismal. The Nuclear Factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway is a complex network linking extracellular stimuli to cell survival and proliferation, and aberrant activation of NF-κB signaling has been implicated in the propagation of a wide range of cancers. However, the underlying mechanism of NF-κB activation still requires further investigation. Here, we report that crumbs homolog 2 (CRB2) is markedly up-regulated in human GBM relative to non-tumor tissues or normal astrocytes. Clinically, enriched CRB2 could be observed in high grade glioma with IDH IDH wild-type and 1p19q co-deletion and implied poor outcome in GBM. Consistent with this, malignant characteristics of GBM cells including proliferation, migration, invasion and tumorigenesis were significantly suppressed by lentivirus knock-down of CRB2. Furthermore, exogenous overexpression of CRB2 enhanced the malignant biological signatures of GBM cells as well as therapy resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). To further investigate the molecular mechanisms responsible, bioinformatics analysis was performed using 3 public databases, with the result that CRB2 was found to correlate closely with tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)–NF–κB signaling. Mechanistically, elevated CRB2 increased the phosphorylation of IκB-kinase α (IKKα), thus activating NF-κB via reduction of Ikβ protein. Taken together, these data suggest that CRB2 might be a reliable prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for GBM.

Abstract: Neurturin (NRTN) is one of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor family ligands crucial for neuron growth, differentiation and maintenance. Recent studies showed NRTN promotes an aggressive pancreatic cancer phenotype, and predicts shorter survival in lung cancer patients. However, its expression and function in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain unclear. Herein, we found NRTN was enriched in CRC cells, and predicted poor patients outcomes. Upregulated NRTN enhanced the migration and invasion of CRC cells and vascularization of endothelial cells. In mechanism, NRTN promoted ZEB1/N-cadherin and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A expression in CRC cells, which were responsible for tumor cell motility and angiogenesis, respectively. More importantly, NRTN inhibition prevented CRC metastasis and angiogenesis in vivo. In conclusion, NRTN promotes CRC cells motility and tumor angiogenesis via inducing ZEB1/N-cadherin and VEGF-A overexpression. It is a potential therapeutic target and negative prognostic biomarker for CRC patients.

Abstract: Summary
Pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) have shown great potential as an alternative to primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) for in vitro modeling. Several differentiation protocols have been described to direct PSCs toward the hepatic fate. Here, by leveraging recent knowledge of the signaling pathways involved in liver development, we describe a robust, scalable protocol that allowed us to consistently generate high-quality bipotent human hepatoblasts and HLCs from both embryonic stem cells and induced PSC (iPSCs). Although not yet fully mature, such HLCs were more similar to adult PHHs than were cells obtained with previously described protocols, showing good potential as a physiologically representative alternative to PHHs for in vitro modeling. PSC-derived hepatoblasts effectively generated with this protocol could differentiate into mature hepatocytes and cholangiocytes within syngeneic liver organoids, thus opening the way for representative human 3D in vitro modeling of liver development and pathophysiology.

Abstract: Summary
The ligand-bound (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl diphosphate (HMBPP) receptor (BTN3A1 and BTN2A1) is detectable by the T cell receptor (TCR) of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells. Although BTN3A1 binds to phosphoantigens (pAgs), the mechanisms resulting in receptor activation are not clear. We used CRISPR-Cas9, ELISA, nano-bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to evaluate the role of BTN2A1. Depletion of BTN2A1 and rescue experiments demonstrate that its internal domain is essential for pAg detection. Internal hetero-BRET signals are observed between BTN2A1 and BTN3A1 that are increased by pAg. ITC detects a direct interaction between the intracellular domains of BTN3A1 and BTN2A1 only in the presence of pAg. This interaction is abrogated by removal of the BTN2A1 juxtamembrane (JM) region but not by removal of the BTN3A1 JM region. Regional mutations between BTN2A1 316–326 clearly affect the interferon γ (IFNγ) response and hetero-BRET signal. Mutations to amino acids L318, W320, and L325 indicate that these amino acids are crucial. This study demonstrates a pAg-inducible interaction between BTN2A1 and BTN3A1 internal domains.

Abstract: Summary
Neurological complications are common in COVID-19. Although SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in patients’ brain tissues, its entry routes and resulting consequences are not well understood. Here, we show a pronounced upregulation of interferon signaling pathways of the neurovascular unit in fatal COVID-19. By investigating the susceptibility of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived brain capillary endothelial-like cells (BCECs) to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we found that BCECs were infected and recapitulated transcriptional changes detected in vivo. While BCECs were not compromised in their paracellular tightness, we found SARS-CoV-2 in the basolateral compartment in transwell assays after apical infection, suggesting active replication and transcellular transport of virus across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in vitro. Moreover, entry of SARS-CoV-2 into BCECs could be reduced by anti-spike-, anti-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-, and anti-neuropilin-1 (NRP1)-specific antibodies or the transmembrane protease serine subtype 2 (TMPRSS2) inhibitor nafamostat. Together, our data provide strong support for SARS-CoV-2 brain entry across the BBB resulting in increased interferon signaling.

Abstract: Metastatic spread of cancer cells is the main cause of cancer-related death. As cancer cells adapt themselves in a suspended state in the blood stream before penetration and regrowth at distal tissues, understanding their survival strategy in an anchorage-independent condition is important to develop appropriate therapeutics. We have previously generated adapted suspension cells (ASCs) from parental adherent cancer cells to study the characteristics of circulating tumor cells. In this study, we explored metabolic rewiring in MDA-MB-468 ASCs to adapt to suspension growth conditions through extracellular flux analyses and various metabolic assays. We also determined the relationship between AKT activation and metabolic rewiring in ASCs using the AKT inhibitor, MK2206. ASCs reprogramed metabolism to enhance glycolysis and basal oxygen consumption rate. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed the upregulation in the genes related to glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. The changes in the metabolic program led to a remarkable dependency of ASCs on carbohydrates as an energy source for proliferation as compared to parental adherent cells (ADs). AKT activation was observed in ASCs and those generated from pancreatic and other breast cancer cells, and AKT activation inhibition in ASCs decreased glycolysis and oxygen consumption. AKT activation is an important strategy for obtaining energy through the enhancement of glycolysis in ASCs. The regulation of AKT activity and/or glycolysis may provide a strong therapeutic strategy to prevent the metastatic spread of cancer cells.

Abstract: Exosomes mediate cellular communications in cancer by transmitting active molecules. However, the CAFs-derived molecular determinants that regulate esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) metastasis have not been fully characterized. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential roles of exosomal LINC01410 of ESCC cells. The characteristics of exosomes were identified using transmission electron microscope (TEM), Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA). The expression of LINC01410 and miR-122–5p was analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay. The biological roles of LINC01410 in ESCC cells were investigated using transwell assay. Western blot assay was employed to detect protein levels. The potential downstream molecular mechanism of LINC01410 was demonstrated with dual-luciferase reporter assay, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay and RNA pull down. CAFs promote the metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of ESCC cells. CAFs exert their roles by transferring exosomes to ESCC cells, leading to a significant increase of LINC01410 level in ESCC cells. Mechanically, LINC01410 secreted by CAFs-Exo could contribute to metastasis and EMT by sponging miR-122–5p and increasing PKM2 level in TE-1 and Eca-109 cells. Additionally, LINC01410/miR-122–5p/PKM2 axis affecting ESCC metastasis and EMT in vitro and in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive muscle disorder caused by mutations in the Dystrophin gene. Cardiomyopathy is a major cause of early death. We used DMD-patient-specific human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to model cardiomyopathic features and unravel novel pathologic insights. Cardiomyocytes (CMs) differentiated from DMD hiPSCs showed enhanced premature cell death due to significantly elevated intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting from depolarized mitochondria and increased NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4). CRISPR-Cas9 correction of Dystrophin restored normal ROS levels. ROS reduction by N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), ataluren (PTC124), and idebenone improved hiPSC-CM survival. We show that oxidative stress in DMD hiPSC-CMs was counteracted by stimulating adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. ATP can bind to NOX4 and partially inhibit the ROS production. Considering the complexity and the early cellular stress responses in DMD cardiomyopathy, we propose targeting ROS production and preventing detrimental effects of NOX4 on DMD CMs as promising therapeutic strategy.

Abstract: In patients with ischemic heart disease, myocardial ischemia–reperfusion injury (IRI) can aggravate their condition even worse, and diabetes increases their risk of myocardial IRI. Pathological pathways of common diseases and surgical operations like diabetes, obesity, coronary artery angioplasty, and heart transplantation entail disorders of iron metabolism. Ferroportin1 (FPN1) is the only mammalian protein associated with iron release and thus plays a vital role in iron homeostasis, while nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) controls the transcription of FPN1. Since the NRF2/FPN1 pathway may play a favorable role in the therapy of diabetic myocardial IRI, this work investigated the possible mechanism. In this study, we investigated the effects of ferroptosis in STZ-induced diabetic rats following myocardial IRI in vivo, and its alteration in glucose and hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced cardiomyocytes injury in vitro. Rats and H9c2 cardiomyocytes were randomly divided into 6 groups and treated with sulforaphane and erastin besides the establishment of diabetic myocardial IRI and hyperglycemic hypoxia-reoxygenation models. Cardiac functional and structural damage were detected by Evans blue/TTC double staining, echocardiography, HE staining, and serological indices. CCK-8 assay and ROS production were used to measure cardiomyocyte viability and oxidative stress level. Additionally, the changes in cell supernatant levels of Fe2+, SOD, MDA, and mRNA and protein expression of ferroptosis marker proteins confirmed the beneficial effects of the NRF2/FPN1 pathway on diabetic myocardial IRI related to iron metabolism and ferroptosis. Overall, these findings suggest that iron homeostasis-related ferroptosis plays an important role in aggravating myocardial IRI in diabetic rats, and NRF2/FPN1 pathway-mediated iron homeostasis and ferroptosis might be a promising therapeutic target against myocardial IRI in diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
Cell signaling is orchestrated in part through a network of protein kinases and phosphatases. Dysregulation of kinase signaling is widespread in diseases such as cancer and is readily targetable through inhibitors. Mass spectrometry-based analysis can provide a global view of kinase regulation, but mining these data is complicated by its stochastic coverage of the proteome, measurement of substrates rather than kinases, and the scale of the data. Here, we implement a dual data and motif clustering (DDMC) strategy that simultaneously clusters peptides into similarly regulated groups based on their variation and their sequence profile. We show that this can help to identify putative upstream kinases and supply more robust clustering. We apply this clustering to clinical proteomic profiling of lung cancer and identify conserved proteomic signatures of tumorigenicity, genetic mutations, and immune infiltration. We propose that DDMC provides a general and flexible clustering strategy for the analysis of phosphoproteomic data.

Abstract: Autophagy is involved in the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and liver fibrosis. Previous studies have shown that interleukin 10 (IL-10) has a marked therapeutic effect against liver fibrosis. However, few studies have evaluated the effect of IL-10 on autophagy in HSCs and fibrotic livers. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of IL-10 on the autophagy of HSCs in vitro and in vivo and then to explore the underlying pathway. In vitro, The results revealed that IL-10 had inhibitory effects on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced autophagy, as evidenced by the decreased LC3II/I ratio and Beclin1 expression, increased p62 expression, reduced numbers of autophagosomes, and blocked autophagy initiation in HSCs. Mechanistically, IL-10 significantly promoted the phosphorylation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3(STAT3) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), leading to the activation of STAT3 and mTOR, which in turn inhibited autophagy. In vivo, the increased expression of IL-10 in fibrotic livers inhibited significantly liver fibrosis and decreased the autophagic activity in fibrotic livers and HSCs. Overall, our results indicate that IL-10 suppressed H2O2-induced autophagy in HSCs by activating the STAT3-mTOR signaling pathway. Present study provides a new theoretical basis for the anti-fibrotic effects of IL-10.

Abstract: Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) describes a process where epithelial tumor cells acquire mesenchymal characteristics. EMT often correlates with invasion and an increased cell migration potential by losing cellular polarity and cell-cell junctions. It is mainly induced by tumor-microenvironment factors, such as TGF-beta 1 and IL-6, which activate the increased expression of the EMT-transcription factor (TF) Slug. We previously reported the Slug/Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) switch in EMT in HNSCC, and found, that in human papilloma virus (HPV)-negative HNSCC Slug gene expression was significant higher represented, than in HPV-positive HNSCC. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of KLF4 and Slug on the regulation of the cadherin switch and on the EMT phenotype. Gene expression of KLF4 positive correlated with E-cadherin in 71 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patient tissue samples, which we also confirmed by the investigation of the Cancer Genome Atlas database (TCGA). HPV-transcripts contributed to stabilization of KLF4 at protein level, and simultaneously upregulated E-cadherin. Furthermore, ectopic KLF4 overexpression was associated with epithelial gene expression by induction of E-cadherin, β-catenin and 70-kDa heat shock protein (HSP-70). The presence of HSP-70 ensures the membranous localization of E-cadherin, therefore, the ability of cells to form cadherin/catenin complexes and cellular linkages. In conclusion, KLF4 is a major regulator of the epithelial cadherin-adhesion in HNSCC.

Abstract: Hypoglycemicagents have been shown to reduce the incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with diabetes mellitus. Azoramide is a novel anti-diabetic agent which protects cells against endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress; however, the cardioprotective effect of azoramide against AF is not clear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the protective effect of azoramide in human iPS-derived atrial myocytes (a-iCMs) against injury induced by high-frequency electrical stimulation. Human-induced pluripotent stem cells were differentiated into a-iCMs by treatment of retinoic acid. The tachypacing group was subjected to 7 Hz tachypacing for 48 h. Azoramide was preconditioned 2-hours before tachypacing. a-iCMs expressed atria-specific genes and the characteristics of the action potential were analogous to those of human atrial myocytes. Tachypacing induced disorder of intracellular calcium homeostasis, apoptosis, depressed ATP level, and severer myofilament dissolution. MetaboAnalysis revealed that tachypacing induced remarkable changes in metabolites involved in energy, amino acid, and glucose metabolism, whereas there was no significant effect on lipid metabolism. Azoramide pretreatment partly alleviated tachypacing-induced calcium dyshomeostasis, ATP consumption, and accelerated apoptosis, which was likely achieved by regulating the PERK/CHOP/CaMKII pathway. Azoramide protected atrial myocytes against injury induced by high-frequency electrical stimulation by regulating ER stress, which may inhibit cell apoptosis and calcium dyshomeostasis via the PERK/CHOP/CaMKII pathway.

Abstract: Summary
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has caused an ongoing global health crisis. Here, we present as a vaccine candidate synthetic SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein-coated lipid vesicles that resemble virus-like particles. Soluble S glycoprotein trimer stabilization by formaldehyde cross-linking introduces two major inter-protomer cross-links that keep all receptor-binding domains in the “down” conformation. Immunization of cynomolgus macaques with S coated onto lipid vesicles (S-LVs) induces high antibody titers with potent neutralizing activity against the vaccine strain, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma variants as well as T helper (Th)1 CD4+-biased T cell responses. Although anti-receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific antibody responses are initially predominant, the third immunization boosts significant non-RBD antibody titers. Challenging vaccinated animals with SARS-CoV-2 shows a complete protection through sterilizing immunity, which correlates with the presence of nasopharyngeal anti-S immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA titers. Thus, the S-LV approach is an efficient and safe vaccine candidate based on a proven classical approach for further development and clinical testing.

Abstract: Summary
Severe ocular surface diseases can lead to limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD), which is accompanied by defective healing. We aimed to evaluate the role of the substance P (SP)/neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R) pathway in corneal epithelium wound healing in a pre-clinical model of LSCD. SP ablation or NK1R blockade significantly increased epithelial wound healing (p < 0.001) and corneal transparency (p < 0.001), compared with wild type (WT). In addition, a reduced number of infiltrating goblet and conjunctival cells (p < 0.05) and increased number of epithelial stem cells (p < 0.01), which also expressed NK1R, was observed. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway was significantly inhibited (p < 0.05) and expression of γH2AX was significantly reduced (p < 0.05) after SP ablation. These results suggest that excessive expression of SP is associated with LSCD and results in accelerated senescence and exhaustion of residual stem cells. Topical treatment with NK1R antagonist ameliorates clinical signs associated with LSCD and could be used as an adjuvant treatment in LSCD.

Abstract: Summary
Activity of the heme synthesis enzyme ferrochelatase (FECH) is implicated in multiple diseases. In particular, it is a mediator of neovascularization in the eye and thus an appealing therapeutic target for preventing blindness. However, no drug-like direct FECH inhibitors are known. Here, we set out to identify small-molecule inhibitors of FECH as potential therapeutic leads using a high-throughput screening approach to identify potent inhibitors of FECH activity. A structure-activity relationship study of a class of triazolopyrimidinone hits yielded drug-like FECH inhibitors. These compounds inhibit FECH in cells, bind the active site in cocrystal structures, and are antiangiogenic in multiple in vitro assays. One of these promising compounds was antiangiogenic in vivo in a mouse model of choroidal neovascularization. This foundational work may be the basis for new therapeutic agents to combat not only ocular neovascularization but also other diseases characterized by FECH activity.

Abstract: Summary
What enables strains of the same species to coexist in a microbiome? Here, we investigate whether host anatomy can explain strain co-residence of Cutibacterium acnes, the most abundant species on human skin. We reconstruct on-person evolution and migration using whole-genome sequencing of C. acnes colonies acquired from healthy subjects, including from individual skin pores, and find considerable spatial structure at the level of pores. Although lineages (sets of colonies separated by <100 mutations) with in vitro fitness differences coexist within centimeter-scale regions, each pore is dominated by a single lineage. Moreover, colonies from a pore typically have identical genomes. An absence of adaptive signatures suggests a genotype-independent source of low within-pore diversity. We therefore propose that pore anatomy imposes random single-cell bottlenecks; the resulting population fragmentation reduces competition and promotes coexistence. Our findings suggest that therapeutic interventions involving pore-dwelling species might focus on removing resident populations over optimizing probiotic fitness.

Abstract: Numb regulates cell proliferation and differentiation through endocytosis and ubiquitination of signaling molecules. Besides, Numb controls the migration of epithelial cells by regulating intercellular junctions. Studies have shown that Numb promotes or inhibits tumor progression in different tumors. However, its role and mechanism in colorectal cancer remain unclear. We found that the expression level of Numb in colon tumor tissues has a great variety in different patients. Numb expression was negatively correlated with TNM stage and lymph node metastasis but positively correlated with tumor size. Elevated expression of Numb was associated with a good prognosis. Inhibiting Numb expression promoted the migration and invasion of colon cancer cells induced by TGF-β, up-regulated the expression of EMT-related molecule Snail, and prevented the expression of E-cadherin. We also found that Numb promoted the proliferation and clones formation while inhibiting colon cancer cells' late apoptosis. In addition, Numb inhibited the RhoA activation and ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 or interfered with ROCK expression, partially inhibiting Numb-regulated cell proliferation and migration. In vivo tumorigenesis assay in nude mice also found that Numb promoted the proliferation of colon cancer cells, inhibited the expression of E-cadherin, and strengthened the expression of Snail. In conclusion, our study found that Numb plays multiple roles in the occurrence and progression of colon cancer by regulating the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway, which provides a new theoretical molecular basis for the pathogenesis of colon cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Maternal vaccination is a promising strategy for preventing neonatal disease caused by group B Streptococcus. The safety and immunogenicity of the prototype vaccine GBS-NN, a fusion protein consisting of the N-terminal domains of the alpha-like proteins (Alp) αC and Rib, were recently evaluated favorably in healthy adult women in a phase 1 trial. Here we demonstrate robust immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) responses against αC and Rib, as well as against the heterotypic Alp family members Alp1–Alp3. IgA and heterotypic IgG responses are more variable between subjects and correlate with pre-existing immunity. Vaccine-induced IgG mediates opsonophagocytic killing and prevents bacterial invasion of epithelial cells. Like the vaccine-induced response, naturally acquired IgG against the vaccine domains is dominated by IgG1. Consistent with the high IgG1 cross-placental transfer rate, naturally acquired IgG against both domains reaches higher concentrations in neonatal than maternal blood, as assessed in a separate group of non-vaccinated pregnant women and their babies.

Abstract: Summary
Elucidating regulatory relationships between transcription factors (TFs) and target genes is fundamental to understanding how cells control their identity and behavior. Unfortunately, existing computational gene regulatory network (GRN) reconstruction methods are imprecise, computationally burdensome, and fail to reveal dynamic regulatory topologies. Here, we present Epoch, a reconstruction tool that uses single-cell transcriptomics to accurately infer dynamic networks. We apply Epoch to identify the dynamic networks underpinning directed differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) guided by multiple signaling pathways, and we demonstrate that modulating these pathways drives topological changes that bias cell fate potential. We also find that Peg3 rewires the pluripotency network to favor mesoderm specification. By integrating signaling pathways with GRNs, we trace how Wnt activation and PI3K suppression govern mesoderm and endoderm specification, respectively. Finally, we identify regulatory circuits of patterning and axis formation that distinguish in vitro and in vivo mesoderm specification.

Abstract: The microenvironment of the brain has become increasingly recognized as an essential regulator in metastatic and primary brain tumors. Recent studies demonstrate that circulating tumor-derived exosomes are critical for the brain tumor microenvironment. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), a malignant tumor of the head and neck, often invades the skull base but infrequently extends to brain parenchyma. Neurobiological communication between microglia and tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) has been extensively studied, but how NPC cells regulate the immune microenvironment in the brain remains unknown. Here, we report that NPC derived EVs lead to increased microglial phagocytosis and proliferation, and heightened levels of IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1 and TGF-β1. Analysis of microRNAs in EVs reveal that miR196a-5p is the major effector microRNA. Moreover, we demonstrate an enrichment of miR196a-5p in the plasmatic EVs of NPC patients. Further investigation demonstrated that miR196a-5p was transferred to microglia and regulated microglial structure and functions by downregulating the expression of ROCK1. Therefore, these data indicate that NPC-derived EVs are potent modulators of microglial functions in brain microenvironment. Regardless of brain colonization, EVs-mediated functional changes in microglia may be a universal phenomenon that results in the alteration of the tumor host's microenvironment in the brain.

Abstract: This study was tailored to compare the cryopreservation of the human ovarian cortex using closed metal container vitrification or the slow-freezing technique. Superficial ovarian cortical tissue biopsies were collected from 12 participants who underwent gynaecological videolaparoscopy. The fragmented samples were allocated to three experimental conditions: (a) fresh ovarian tissue, (b) slow-freezing, and (c) vitrification with a metal closed container. After thawing or rewarming, cellular morphological analyses were performed to determine tissue viability. The cellular response to thermal stress was measured by a putative increase in the immune quantification of the heat shock protein 70 kDa (heat shock protein 70 kDa response — HSR) after a heat challenge (2 h exposure at 42 °C). Both the total number of intact follicles and the frequency of primordial follicles were higher in fresh ovarian tissue than in the preserved samples, regardless of the technique employed. There was a trend towards an increase in the absolute number of intact follicles in the tissue preserved by vitrification. After cryopreservation, a higher HSR was obtained after slow-freezing. These results indicate that both cryopreservation techniques present advantages and may be used as alternatives to ovarian tissue cryopreservation.

IL-6 promotes chemoresistance via upregulating CD36 mediated fatty acids uptake in acute myeloid leukemia,

Abstract: Chemoresistance contributes to poor survival and high relapse risk in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). As a pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays a vital role in the chemoresistance of malignancies. However, the underlying mechanisms of chemoresistance in AML have not been widely studied. Lipid metabolism, which contributes to chemoresistance in AML, is enhanced by IL-6 in skeletal muscle cells. We hypothesized that IL-6 promotes the chemoresistance of AML by promoting lipid metabolism. Based on the positive correlation between IL-6 receptor expression and the cellular response to exogenous IL-6, we performed Gene Ontology analysis of a dataset consisting the information of 151 AML patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We found that lipid transport-associated genes were upregulated in the high IL-6 receptor expression group. Additionally, IL-6 promoted fatty acid (FA) uptake in both AML cell lines and primary AML cells. Inhibition of FA uptake by sulfo-N-succinimidyl oleate repressed IL-6-induced chemoresistance. Western blotting, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that IL-6 promoted CD36 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels through stat3 signaling. Knockout of CD36 or stat3 repressed IL-6-induced FA uptake and chemoresistance. Furthermore, in five human AML samples, we validated that compared to CD36−cells, CD36+ primary AML cells were less sensitive to cytosine arabinoside (Ara-c) and that blockade of CD36 re-sensitized CD36+ AML cells to Ara-c. Mice injected with CD36 knockout cells followed by treatment with Ara-c showed markedly decreased leukemia burden and prolonged survival in vivo. Finally, treatment with the CD36 antibody in combination with Ara-c exhibited synergistic effects in vivo. In conclusion, IL-6 promotes chemoresistance in AML through the stat3/CD36-mediated FA uptake. Blockade of CD36 improved the effect of Ara-c, representing a promising strategy for AML therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Tailored skin microbiome modulation approaches with probiotics are highly challenging. Here, we show that lactobacilli are underestimated members of the skin microbiota. We select specific strains of nomadic lactobacilli for their functional applicability on the skin and capacity to inhibit growth and inflammation by skin pathobionts. The strains are formulated as microcapsules for topical formulations and tested in patients with mild-to-moderate acne. The selected lactobacilli are able to reduce inflammatory lesions in a pilot and placebo-controlled study. Daily application for 8 weeks is associated with an in vivo temporary modulation of the microbiome, including a reduction in relative abundance of staphylococci and Cutibacterium acnes, and an increase in lactobacilli. The reduction in inflammatory lesions is still apparent 4 weeks after the topical application of the lactobacilli ended, indicating a possible additional immunomodulatory effect. This study shows that carefully selected and formulated lactobacilli are a viable therapeutic option for common acne lesions.

Abstract: Summary
Conventional reprogramming methods rely on the ectopic expression of transcription factors to reprogram somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). The forced expression of transcription factors may lead to off-target gene activation and heterogeneous reprogramming, resulting in the emergence of alternative cell types and aberrant iPSCs. Activation of endogenous pluripotency factors by CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) can reduce this heterogeneity. Here, we describe a high-efficiency reprogramming of human somatic cells into iPSCs using optimized CRISPRa. Efficient reprogramming was dependent on the additional targeting of the embryo genome activation-enriched Alu-motif and the miR-302/367 locus. Single-cell transcriptome analysis revealed that the optimized CRISPRa reprogrammed cells more directly and specifically into the pluripotent state when compared to the conventional reprogramming method. These findings support the use of CRISPRa for high-quality pluripotent reprogramming of human cells.

Abstract: The accumulation of activated myofibroblastic pancreatic stellate cells (MF-PSCs) induces pancreatic cancer desmoplasia. These MF-PSCs are derived from quiescent pancreatic stellate cells (Q-PSCs). MF-PSCs in pancreatic cancer tend to glycolysis. However, increased glycolysis alone could not be sufficient for the increased metabolic demands of MF-PSCs. Yap and Myc signaling activation is involved in pancreatic cancer metabolism. Since elucidating the metabolic processes of MF-PSCs may be a promising strategy to suppress pancreatic cancer desmoplasia, we explored whether glutaminolysis meets the bioenergetic and biosynthetic demands of Q-PSCs converted into MF-PSCs and whether this is mediated by Yap signaling to Myc. In this study, we found that during the transdifferentiation of Q-PSCs into MF-PSCs, glutaminolysis regulatory genes were upregulated, and suppression of glutaminolysis inhibited transdifferentiation. Disrupting glutaminolysis in MF-PSCs inhibited cell growth, mitochondrial respiration, and fibrogenesis, while treatment of MF-PSCs with DKG (a glutaminolysis metabolite) reversed these activities. The expression of glutaminase (GLS1), a rate-limiting enzyme in glutaminolysis, was upregulated by Yap overexpression. Yap upregulates Myc to regulate the expression of GLS1 in MF-PSCs. Yap and Myc inhibitors disrupted glutaminolysis and inhibited myofibroblastic activities in PSCs. Thus, Yap-Myc signaling controls glutaminolysis to activate PSCs and might be a therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer desmoplasia.

Abstract: Summary
Gametogenesis requires close interactions between germ cells and somatic cells. Derivation of sperm from spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) is hampered by the inefficiency of spermatogonial transplantation technique in many animal species because it requires a large number of SSCs and depletion of endogenous spermatogenesis. Here we used mouse testis primordia and organoids to induce spermatogenesis from SSCs. We microinjected mouse SSCs into embryonic gonads or reaggregated neonatal testis organoids, which were transplanted under the tunica albuginea of mature testes. As few as 1 × 104 donor cells colonized both types of transplants and produced sperm. Moreover, rat embryonic gonads supported xenogeneic spermatogenesis from mouse SSCs when transplanted in testes of immunodeficient mice. Offspring with normal genomic imprinting patterns were born after microinsemination. These results demonstrate remarkable flexibility of the germ cell-somatic cell interaction and raise new strategies of SSC manipulation for animal transgenesis and analysis of male infertility.

Abstract: Summary
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein (S)-pseudotyped viruses are commonly used for quantifying antiviral drugs and neutralizing antibodies. Here, we describe the development of a hybrid alphavirus-SARS-CoV-2 (Ha-CoV-2) pseudovirion, which is a non-replicating SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particle composed of viral structural proteins (S, M, N, and E) and an RNA genome derived from a fast-expressing alphaviral vector. We validated Ha-CoV-2 for rapid quantification of neutralization antibodies, antiviral drugs, and viral variants. In addition, as a proof of concept, we used Ha-CoV-2 to quantify the neutralizing antibodies from an infected and vaccinated individual and found that the one-dose vaccination with Moderna mRNA-1273 greatly increased the anti-serum titer by approximately 6-fold. The post-vaccination serum can neutralize all nine variants tested. These results demonstrate that Ha-CoV-2 can be used as a robust platform for the rapid quantification of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and its emerging variants.

Abstract: Heat shock cognate 70 (HSC70/HSPA8) is considered to be a promising candidate gene for schizophrenia (SCZ) due to its many essential functions and potential neuroprotective properties in the CNS (e.g., HSC70 is involved in the turnover of the synaptic proteins, synaptic vesicle recycling, and neurotransmitter homeostasis). An alteration in the expression of HSPA8 in SCZ has been reported. This implies that the genetic variants of HSPA8 might contribute to schizophrenia pathogenesis. The present study attempted to determine whether HSPA8 polymorphisms are associated with a susceptibility to schizophrenia or whether they have an impact on the clinical parameters of the disease in a Polish population. A total of 1066 participants (406 patients and 660 controls) were recruited for the study. Five SNPs of the HSPA8 gene (rs2236659, rs1136141, rs10892958, rs1461496, and rs4936770) were genotyped using TaqMan assays. There were no differences in the allele or genotype distribution in any of the SNPs in the entire sample. We also did not find any HSPA8 haplotype-specific associations with SCZ. A gender stratification analysis revealed that an increasing risk of schizophrenia was associated with the rs1461496 genotype in females (OR: 1.68, p < 0.05) in the recessive model. In addition, we found novel associations between HSPA8 SNPs (rs1136141, rs1461496, and rs10892958) and the severity of the psychiatric symptoms as measured by the PANSS. Further studies with larger samples from various ethnic groups are necessary to confirm our findings. Furthermore, studies that explore the functional contribution of the HSPA8 variants to schizophrenia pathogenesis are also needed.

Abstract: Summary
Polarized epithelial cells form an essential barrier against infection at mucosal surfaces. Many pathogens breach this barrier to cause disease, often by co-opting cellular endocytosis mechanisms to enter the cell through the lumenal (apical) cell surface. We recently discovered that the loss of the cell polarity gene PARD6B selectively diminishes apical endosome function. Here, we find that in response to the entry of certain viruses and bacterial toxins into the epithelial cells via the apical membrane, PARD6B and aPKC, two components of the PARD6B-aPKC-Cdc42 apical polarity complex, undergo rapid proteasome-dependent degradation. The perturbation of apical membrane glycosphingolipids by toxin- or virus-binding initiates degradation of PARD6B. The loss of PARD6B causes the depletion of apical endosome function and renders the cell resistant to further infection from the lumenal cell surface, thus enabling a form of cell-autonomous host defense.

Abstract: Summary
Autoantibodies that recognize extracellular proteins (the exoproteome) exert potent biological effects but are challenging to detect. Here, we developed rapid extracellular antigen profiling (REAP), a high-throughput technique for the comprehensive discovery of exoproteome-targeting autoantibodies. Patient samples are applied to a genetically barcoded yeast surface display library containing 2,688 human extracellular proteins. Antibody-coated yeast are isolated, and sequencing of barcodes is used to identify displayed antigens. To benchmark REAP’s performance, we screened 77 patients with autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1 (APS-1). REAP sensitively and specifically detected both known and previously unidentified autoantibodies in APS-1. We further screened 106 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and identified numerous autoantibodies, several of which were associated with disease severity or specific clinical manifestations and exerted functional effects on cell signaling ex vivo. These findings demonstrate the utility of REAP to atlas the expansive landscape of exoproteome-targeting autoantibodies and their impacts on patient health outcomes.

Abstract: Summary
The maturation and functional characteristics of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-cortical neurons has not been fully documented. This study developed a phenotypic model of hiPSC-derived cortical neurons, characterized their maturation process, and investigated its application for disease modeling with the integration of multi-electrode array (MEA) technology. Immunocytochemistry analysis indicated early-stage neurons (day 21) were simultaneously positive for both excitatory (vesicular glutamate transporter 1 [VGlut1]) and inhibitory (GABA) markers, while late-stage cultures (day 40) expressed solely VGlut1, indicating a purely excitatory phenotype without containing glial cells. This maturation process was further validated utilizing patch clamp and MEA analysis. Particularly, induced long-term potentiation (LTP) successfully persisted for 1 h in day 40 cultures, but only achieved LTP in the presence of the GABAA receptor antagonist picrotoxin in day 21 cultures. This system was also applied to epilepsy modeling utilizing bicuculline and its correction utilizing the anti-epileptic drug valproic acid.

Abstract: Summary
In vitro expansion of human primordial germ cell-like cells (hPGCLCs), a pluripotent stem cell-derived PGC model, has proved challenging due to rapid loss of primordial germ cell (PGC)-like identity and limited cell survival/proliferation. Here, we describe long-term culture hPGCLCs (LTC-hPGCLCs), which actively proliferate in a serum-free, feeder-free condition without apparent limit as highly homogeneous diploid cell populations maintaining transcriptomic and epigenomic characteristics of hPGCLCs. Histone proteomics confirmed reduced H3K9me2 and increased H3K27me3 marks in LTC-hPGCLCs compared with induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). LTC-hPGCLCs established from multiple human iPSC clones of both sexes were telomerase positive, senescence-free cells readily passaged with minimal cell death or deviation from the PGC-like identity. LTC-hPGCLCs are capable of differentiating to DAZL-positive M-spermatogonia-like cells in the xenogeneic reconstituted testis (xrTestis) organ culture milieu as well as efficiently producing fully pluripotent embryonic germ cell-like cells in the presence of stem cell factor and fibroblast growth factor 2. Thus, LTC-hPGCLCs provide convenient access to unlimited amounts of high-quality and homogeneous hPGCLCs.

Abstract: Summary
Both SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 vaccines elicit memory T cell responses. Here, we report the development of 2 pools of experimentally defined SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes that, in combination with spike, were used to discriminate 4 groups of subjects with different SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccine status. The overall T cell-based classification accuracy was 89.2% and 88.5% in the experimental and validation cohorts. This scheme was applicable to different mRNA vaccines and different lengths of time post infection/post vaccination and yielded increased accuracy when compared to serological readouts. T cell responses from breakthrough infections were also studied and effectively segregated from vaccine responses, with a combined performance of 86.6% across all 239 subjects from the 5 groups. We anticipate that a T cell-based immunodiagnostic scheme to classify subjects based on their vaccination and natural infection history will be an important tool for longitudinal monitoring of vaccinations and for establishing SARS-CoV-2 correlates of protection.

Abstract: Summary
Testosterone deficiency can lead to depressive symptoms in humans; however, the causes of this deficiency are incompletely understood. Here, we isolated Mycobacterium neoaurum from the fecal samples of testosterone-deficient patients with depression and showed that this strain could degrade testosterone in vitro. Furthermore, gavaging rats with M. neoaurum reduced their serum and brain testosterone levels and induced depression-like behaviors. We identified the gene encoding 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) as the enzyme causing testosterone degradation. Introducing 3β-HSD into Escherichia coli enhanced its ability to degrade testosterone. Gavaging rats with 3β-HSD-producing E. coli reduced their serum and brain testosterone levels and caused depression-like behaviors. Finally, compared with 16.67% of participants without depression, 42.99% (46/107) of the fecal samples of patients with depression harbored 3β-HSD, and 60.87% (28/46) of these fecal samples expressed 3β-HSD. These results suggest that 3β-HSD expressed by gut microbes may be associated with depressive symptoms due to testosterone degradation.

Abstract: Summary
Efforts to probe the role of the gut microbiota in disease would benefit from a system in which patient-derived bacterial communities can be studied at scale. We addressed this by validating a strategy to propagate phylogenetically complex, diverse, stable, and highly reproducible stool-derived communities in vitro. We generated hundreds of in vitro communities cultured from diverse stool samples in various media; certain media generally preserved inoculum composition, and inocula from different subjects yielded source-specific community compositions. Upon colonization of germ-free mice, community composition was maintained, and the host proteome resembled the host from which the community was derived. Treatment with ciprofloxacin in vivo increased susceptibility to Salmonella invasion in vitro, and the in vitro response to ciprofloxacin was predictive of compositional changes observed in vivo, including the resilience and sensitivity of each Bacteroides species. These findings demonstrate that stool-derived in vitro communities can serve as a powerful system for microbiota research.

Abstract: Summary
Existing approaches to therapeutic gene transfer are marred by the transient nature of gene expression following non-integrative gene delivery and by safety concerns due to the random mechanism of viral-mediated genomic insertions. The disadvantages of these methods encourage future research in identifying human genomic sites that allow for durable and safe expression of genes of interest. We conducted a bioinformatic search followed by the experimental characterization of human genomic sites, identifying two that demonstrated the stable expression of integrated reporter and therapeutic genes without malignant changes to the cellular transcriptome. The cell-type agnostic criteria used in our bioinformatic search suggest widescale applicability of identified sites for engineering of a diverse range of tissues for clinical and research purposes, including modified T cells for cancer therapy and engineered skin to ameliorate inherited diseases and aging. In addition, the stable and robust levels of gene expression from identified sites allow for the industry-scale biomanufacturing of proteins in human cells.

Abstract: Schwann cells (SCs) play a critical role in peripheral nerve (PN) regeneration because of their ability to proliferate, migrate, and provide trophic support for axon regeneration after PN injury. However, the underlying mechanism is still partially understood. Semaphorin3E (Sema3E), a member of the Sema3s family, is a secreted molecular known as a repelling cue in axon guidance and inhibitor of developmental and postischemic angiogenesis. In this study, we examined the expression of Sema3E in sciatic nerves and SCs and explored the effects of Sema3E on SCs proliferation and migration. Immunofluorescence and ELISA analyses illustrated the expression of Sema3E in SCs of Sciatic nerves and the secretion of Sema3E by cultured SCs, respectively. Exogenous Sema3E promoted SC proliferation and migration while knockdown of the endogenous Sema3E by siRNA transfection attenuated proliferation and migration of SCs. Furthermore, blocking the receptor Neuropilin 1 (Nrp1), PlexinD1 and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2 (VEGFR2) by neutralizing antibody or inhibitor suppressed the promoting effects of Sema3E on SCs. This study indicated that Sema3E promoted SC proliferation and migration and the involvement of receptor PlexinD1, Nrp1, and VEGFR2 in these processes. This study extended our understanding of the mechanism that modulated SC phenotype during nerve injury and provided a potential target for promoting PN regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Loss-of-function mutations in PKP2, which encodes plakophilin-2, cause arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (AC). Restoration of deficient molecules can serve as upstream therapy, thereby requiring a human model that recapitulates disease pathology and provides distinct readouts in phenotypic analysis for proof of concept for gene replacement therapy. Here, we generated isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) with precisely adjusted expression of plakophilin-2 from a patient with AC carrying a heterozygous frameshift PKP2 mutation. After monolayer differentiation, plakophilin-2 deficiency led to reduced contractility, disrupted intercalated disc structures, and impaired desmosome assembly in iPSC-CMs. Allele-specific fluorescent labeling of endogenous DSG2 encoding desmoglein-2 in the generated isogenic lines enabled real-time desmosome-imaging under an adjusted dose of plakophilin-2. Adeno-associated virus-mediated gene replacement of PKP2 recovered contractility and restored desmosome assembly, which was sequentially captured by desmosome-imaging in plakophilin-2-deficient iPSC-CMs. Our isogenic set of iPSC-CMs recapitulates AC pathology and provides a rapid and convenient cellular platform for therapeutic development.

Abstract: Purpose
Transcription factor zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1(ZEB1) was well-known as a transcription factor in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process of cancer, but little is known about its role in cancer metabolism. We found metabolism-related gene monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) contained E-box motifs in its promoter region, which is the potential binding site of ZEB1. Thus, the correlation between ZEB1 and MCT4 was also investigated in this study.
Methods
Two human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 were used for ZEB1 and MCT4 expression by double fluorescence staining, ChIP as well as luciferase reporter. ROS levels were revealed by DCFDA and DHE fluorescence probes. The role of ZEB1/MCT4/ROS/autophagy was also determined in xenograft tumor mice model.
Results
MCT4 and ZEB1 were synchronously expressed in two types of breast cancer cells. Moreover, ZEB1 positively regulated the expression and the function of MCT4 through binding to the E-box motifs in MCT4’ promoter. In addition, the in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that ZEB1/MCT4 in synergy promoted the growth of breast cancer through ROS generation and autophagy, which can be reversed by a MCT4 inhibitor, 7ACC1.
Conclusion
ZEB1 directly binds to E-box elements of MCT4 promoter and enhance MCT4 expression, inducing ROS accumulation, which cooperatively resulting in breast cancer growth and shorten survival. Our findings provide a theoretical basis for interfering the metabolism in breast cancer therapeutics.

Abstract: Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) are well-established as vital regulators of fracture healing, whereas angiogenesis is one of the critical processes during the course of bone healing. Accordingly, the current study sought to determine the functions of microRNA (miR)-29b-3p from BM-MSCs-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) on the angiogenesis of fracture healing via the PTEN/PI3K/AKT axis. Firstly, BM-MSCs-EVs were extracted and identified. The lentiviral protocol was adopted to construct miR-29b-3pKD-BMSCs or miR-negative control-BMSCs, which were then co-cultured with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro to determine the roles of EVs-encapsulated miR-29b-3p on the proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis of HUVECs in vitro with the help of a CCK-8 assay, scratch test, and tube formation assay. Subsequent database prediction, luciferase activity assay, RT-qPCR, and Western blot assay findings identified the downstream target gene of miR-29b-3p, PTEN, and a signaling pathway, PI3K/AKT. Furthermore, the application of si-PTEN attenuated the effects induced by miR-29b-3pKD-EVs. Finally, a mouse model of femoral fracture was established with a locally instilled injection of equal volumes of BM-MSCs-EVs and miR-29b-3pKD-BM-MSCs-EVs. Notably, the mice treated with BMSC-EVs presented with enhanced neovascularization at the fracture site, in addition to increased bone volume (BV), BV/tissue volume, and mean bone mineral density; whereas miR-29b-3pKD-BMSCs-EVs-treated mice exhibited decreased vessel density with poor fracture healing capacity. Collectively, our findings elicited that BM-MSCs-EVs carrying miR-29b-3p were endocytosed by HUVECs, which consequently suppressed the PTEN expression and activated the PI3K/AKT pathway, thereby promoting HUVEC proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis, and ultimately facilitating fracture healing.

Abstract: Summary
The hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) is the gold standard for cirrhotic portal hypertension (PHT), but it is invasive and specialized. Alternative non-invasive techniques are needed to assess the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG). Here, we develop an auto-machine-learning CT radiomics HVPG quantitative model (aHVPG), and then we validate the model in internal and external test datasets by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) for HVPG stages (≥10, ≥12, ≥16, and ≥20 mm Hg) and compare the model with imaging- and serum-based tools. The final aHVPG model achieves AUCs over 0.80 and outperforms other non-invasive tools for assessing HVPG. The model shows performance improvement in identifying the severity of PHT, which may help non-invasive HVPG primary prophylaxis when transjugular HVPG measurements are not available.

Abstract: Summary
Coagulation cofactors profoundly regulate hemostasis and are appealing targets for anticoagulants. However, targeting such proteins has been challenging because they lack an active site. To address this, we isolate an RNA aptamer termed T18.3 that binds to both factor V (FV) and FVa with nanomolar affinity and demonstrates clinically relevant anticoagulant activity in both plasma and whole blood. The aptamer also shows synergy with low molecular weight heparin and delivers potent anticoagulation in plasma collected from patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Moreover, the aptamer’s anticoagulant activity can be rapidly and efficiently reversed using protamine sulfate, which potentially allows fine-tuning of aptamer’s activity post-administration. We further show that the aptamer achieves its anticoagulant activity by abrogating FV/FVa interactions with phospholipid membranes. Our success in generating an anticoagulant aptamer targeting FV/Va demonstrates the feasibility of using cofactor-binding aptamers as therapeutic protein inhibitors and reveals an unconventional working mechanism of an aptamer by interrupting protein-membrane interactions.

Abstract: Clusterin (CLU) increases resistance to renal ischemia-reperfusion injury and promotes renal tissue repair. However, the mechanisms underlying of the renal protection of CLU remain unknown. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) may contribute to kidney cell turnover and injury repair. This study investigated the in vitro functions of CLU in kidney mesenchymal stromal cells (KMSCs). KMSCs were grown in plastic culture plates. Cell surface markers, apoptosis and phagocytosis were determined by flow cytometry, and CLU protein by Western blot. There were no differences in the expression of MSC markers (positive: CD133, Sca-1, CD44, CD117 and NG2, and negative: CD34, CD45, CD163, CD41, CD276, CD138, CD79a, CD146 and CD140b) and in the trilineage differentiation to chondrocytes, adipocytes and osteocytes between wild type (WT) and CLU knockout (KO) KMSCs. CLU was expressed intracellularly and secreted by WT KMSCs, and it was up-regulated by hypoxia. CLU did not prevent hypoxia-induced cell apoptosis but promoted cell growth in KMSC cultures. Furthermore, incubation with CLU-containing culture medium from WT KMSCs increased CD206 expression and phagocytic capacity of macrophages. In conclusion, our data for the first time demonstrate the function of CLU in the promotion of KMSCs proliferation, and it may be required for KMSCs-regulated macrophage M2 polarization and phagocytic activity.

Abstract: Summary
Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in Forkhead box G1 (FOXG1), a uniquely brain-expressed gene, cause microcephaly, seizures, and severe intellectual disability, whereas increased FOXG1 expression is frequently observed in glioblastoma. To investigate the role of FOXG1 in forebrain cell proliferation, we modeled FOXG1 syndrome using cells from three clinically diagnosed cases with two sex-matched healthy parents and one unrelated sex-matched control. Cells with heterozygous FOXG1 loss showed significant reduction in cell proliferation, increased ratio of cells in G0/G1 stage of the cell cycle, and increased frequency of primary cilia. Engineered loss of FOXG1 recapitulated this effect, while isogenic repair of a patient mutation reverted output markers to wild type. An engineered inducible FOXG1 cell line derived from a FOXG1 syndrome case demonstrated that FOXG1 dose-dependently affects all cell proliferation outputs measured. These findings provide strong support for the critical importance of FOXG1 levels in controlling human brain cell growth in health and disease.

Abstract: Summary
The canonical function of phosphodiesterase 3A (PDE3A) is to hydrolyze the phosphodiester bonds in second messenger molecules, such as cyclic AMP (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Recently, a phosphodiesterase-activity-independent role for PDE3A was reported. In this noncanonical function, PDE3A physically interacts with Schlafen 12 (SLFN12) upon treatment of cells with cytotoxic PDE3A modulators. Here, we confirmed that the cytotoxic PDE3A modulators act as molecular glues to initiate the association of PDE3A and SLFN12. The PDE3A-SLFN12 interaction increases the protein stability of SLFN12 located in the cytoplasm, while at the same time also inducing SLFN12 dephosphorylation (including serines 368 and 573). Mutational analysis demonstrates that dephosphorylation is required for cell death induced by cytotoxic PDE3A modulators. Finally, we found that dephosphorylation promoted the rRNA RNase activity of SLFN12 and show that this nucleolytic activity is essential for SLFN12’s cell-death-inducing function. Thus, our study deepens the understanding of the biochemical mechanisms underlying SLFN12-mediated cell death.

Abstract: Summary
Inhibiting the histone 3 lysine 79 (H3K79) methyltransferase, disruptor of telomeric silencing 1-like (DOT1L), increases the efficiency of reprogramming somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Here, we find that, despite the enrichment of H3K79 methylation on thousands of actively transcribed genes in somatic cells, DOT1L inhibition (DOT1Li) does not immediately cause the shutdown of the somatic transcriptional profile to enable transition to pluripotency. Contrary to the prevalent view, DOT1Li promotes iPSC generation beyond the mesenchymal to epithelial transition and even from already epithelial cell types. DOT1Li is most potent at the midpoint of reprogramming in part by repressing Nfix that persists at late stages of reprogramming. Importantly, regulation of single genes cannot substitute for DOT1Li, demonstrating that H3K79 methylation has pleiotropic effects in maintaining cell identity.

Abstract: The terminal steps of lens cell differentiation require elimination of all organelles to create a central Organelle Free Zone (OFZ) that is required for lens function of focusing images on the retina. Previous studies show that the spatiotemporal elimination of these organelles during development is autophagy-dependent. We now show that the inhibition of PI3K signaling in lens organ culture results in the premature induction of autophagy within 24 h, including a significant increase in LAMP1+ lysosomes, and the removal of lens organelles from the center of the lens. Specific inhibition of just the PI3K/Akt signaling axis was directly linked to the elimination of mitochondria and ER, while pan-PI3K inhibitors that block all PI3K downstream signaling removed all organelles, including nuclei. Therefore, blocking the PI3K/Akt pathway was alone insufficient to remove nuclei. RNAseq analysis revealed increased mRNA levels of the endogenous inhibitor of PI3K activation, PIK3IP1, in differentiating lens fiber cells preceding the induction of OFZ formation. Co-immunoprecipitation confirmed that PIK3IP1 associates with multiple PI3K p110 isoforms just prior to formation of the OFZ, providing a likely endogenous mechanism for blocking all PI3K signaling and activating the autophagy pathway required to form the OFZ during lens development.

Abstract: Summary
Most patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) experience mild, non-specific symptoms, but many develop severe symptoms associated with an excessive inflammatory response. Elevated plasma concentrations of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) provide early warning of progression to severe respiratory failure (SRF) or death, but access to suPAR testing may be limited. The Severe COvid Prediction Estimate (SCOPE) score, derived from circulating concentrations of C-reactive protein, D- dimers, interleukin-6, and ferritin among patients not receiving non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation during the SAVE-MORE study, offers predictive accuracy for progression to SRF or death within 14 days comparable to that of a suPAR concentration of ≥6 ng/mL (area under receiver operator characteristic curve 0.81 for both). The SCOPE score is validated in two similar independent cohorts.

Abstract: Summary
We present a data integration framework that uses non-negative matrix factorization of patient-similarity networks to integrate continuous multi-omics datasets for molecular subtyping. It is demonstrated to have the capability to handle missing data without using imputation and to be consistently among the best in detecting subtypes with differential prognosis and enrichment of clinical associations in a large number of cancers. When applying the approach to data from individuals with lower-grade gliomas, we identify a subtype with a significantly worse prognosis. Tumors assigned to this subtype are hypomethylated genome wide with a gain of AP-1 occupancy in demethylated distal enhancers. The tumors are also enriched for somatic chromosome 7 (chr7) gain, chr10 loss, and other molecular events that have been suggested as diagnostic markers for “IDH wild type, with molecular features of glioblastoma” by the cIMPACT-NOW consortium but have yet to be included in the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines.

Abstract: ABT-199, a specific inhibitor of the Bcl-2 protein, is widely used in clinical trials for hematological tumors and rarely applied to the research of solid tumors. In this study, we used Bax/Bak double knockout (KO) and knockdown (KD) cells as the model and found that ABT-199 initiated autophagic cell death independent of Bax and Bak. ABT-199 initiated Beclin-1-dependent autophagy, which led to cell death. Furthermore, inactivated Akt released Beclin-1 from the 14-3-3 protein through a change in the phosphorylation state of Beclin-1 in ABT-199-treated cells. Moreover, JNK antagonized the function of Akt in Beclin-1-mediated autophagy by phosphorylating the 14-3-3 protein. Phosphorylated 14-3-3 exhibited a decreased interaction with Beclin-1. Therefore, ABT-199 activated the JNK-Akt-14-3-3 signaling pathway to mediate the Beclin-1-dependent autophagic death of Bax/Bak KO and KD cells. These findings may extend the therapeutic application of ABT-199 to colon cancer, particularly apoptosis-deficient tumors.

Abstract: Mutant KRAS, the most frequently occurring (∼30%) driver oncogene in lung adenocarcinoma, induces normal epithelial cells to undergo senescence. This phenomenon, called “oncogene-induced senescence (OIS)”, prevents mutant KRAS-induced malignant transformation. We have previously reported that mutant KRASV12 induces OIS in a subset of normal human bronchial epithelial cell line immortalized with hTERT and Cdk4. Understanding the mechanism and efficacy of this important cancer prevention mechanism is a key knowledge gap. Therefore, this study investigates mutant KRASV12-induced OIS in upregulated telomerase combined with the p16/RB pathway inactivation in normal bronchial epithelial cells. The normal (non-transformed and non-tumorigenic) human bronchial epithelial cell line HBEC3 (also called “HBEC3KT”), immortalized with hTERT (“T”) and Cdk4 (“K”), was used in this study. HBEC3 that expressed mutant KRASV12 in a doxycycline-regulated manner was established (designated as HBEC3-RIN2). Controlled induction of mutant KRASV12 expression induced partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in HBEC3-RIN2 cells, which was associated with upregulated expression of ZEB1 and SNAIL. Mutant KRASV12 caused the majority of HBEC3-RIN2 to undergo morphological changes; suggestive of senescence, which was associated with enhanced autophagic flux. Upon mutant KRASV12 expression, only a small HBEC3-RIN2 cell subset underwent senescence, as assessed by a senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining (SA-βG) method. Furthermore, mutant KRASV12 enhanced cell growth, evaluated by colorimetric proliferation assay, and liquid and soft agar colony formation assays, partially through increased phosphorylated AKT and ERK expression but did not affect cell division, or cell cycle status. Intriguingly, mutant KRASV12 reduced p53 protein expression but increased p21 protein expression by prolonging its half-life. These results indicate that an hTERT/Cdk4 -immortalized normal bronchial epithelial cell line is partially resistant to mutant KRASV12-induced senescence. This suggests that OIS does not efficiently suppress KRASV12-induced transformation in the context of the simultaneous occurrence of telomerase upregulation and inactivation of the p16/Rb pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) present a ubiquitous clinical conundrum in all intra-abdominal malignancies. Via functional and transcriptomic experiments of ascites-treated PC cells, we identify STAT3 as a key signaling pathway. Integrative analysis of publicly available databases and correlation with clinical cohorts (n = 7,359) reveal putative clinically significant activating ligands of STAT3 signaling. We further validate a 3-biomarker prognostic panel in ascites independent of clinical covariates in a prospective study (n = 149). Via single-cell sequencing experiments, we uncover that PAI-1, a key component of the prognostic biomarker panel, is largely secreted by fibroblasts and mesothelial cells. Molecular stratification of ascites using PAI-1 levels and STAT3 activation in ascites-treated cells highlight a therapeutic opportunity based on a phenomenon of paracrine addiction. These results are recapitulated in patient-derived ascites-dependent xenografts. Here, we demonstrate therapeutic proof of concept of direct ligand inhibition of a prognostic target within an enclosed biological space.

Abstract: Angiogenesis is essential for successful bone defect repair. In normal tissue repair, the physiological inflammatory response is the main regulator of angiogenesis through the activity of macrophages and the cytokines secreted by them. In particular, M2 macrophages which secrete high levels of PDGF-BB are typically considered to promote angiogenesis. A hexapeptide [WKYMVm, (Trp-Lys-Tyr-Met-Val-D-Met-NH2)] has been reported to modulate inflammatory activities. However, the underlying mechanisms by which WKYMVm regulates macrophages remain unclear. In this study, the possible involvement by which WKYMVm induces the polarization of macrophages and affects their behaviors was evaluated. In vitro results showed that macrophages were induced to an M2 rather than M1 phenotype and the M2 phenotype was enhanced by WKYMVm through activation of the JAK1/STAT6 signaling pathway. It was also found that WKYMVm played an important role in the PDGF-BB production increase and proangiogenic abilities in M2 macrophages. Consistent with the results in vitro, the elevated M2/M0 ratio induced by WKYMVm enhanced the formation of new blood vessels in a femoral defect mouse model. These findings suggest that WKYMVm could be a promising alternative strategy for angiogenesis in bone repair by inducing M2 macrophage polarization.

Abstract: While screening for insulin-induced genes, we identified two members of a family of stress-induced genes referred to as glucose-regulated proteins (GRPs). GRPs are members of the stress-responsive superfamily of genes which also includes heat shock proteins (HSPs). The GRP proteins are not normally heat-inducible, but are overproduced when cells are starved of glucose. The two major GRP proteins, GRP78 and GRP94, are highly conserved among vertebrates. We have found that physiological concentrations of insulin stimulate the transcription of GRP78 and GRP94 in rat H4IIE hepatoma cells. The regulation of GRP78 transcription was rapid, with the first induction within minutes, and a further induction after several hours, and both occurred in the presence of glucose. GRP78 transcription was more greatly induced by insulin in the presence of SB202190, a specific p38-MAPK inhibitor. Transcription of GRP94 was also induced, but only after several hours. Calcimycin (A23187) and anisomycin were used to induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/cellular stress, and both induced GRP78 and GRP94 transcription.

Abstract: Summary
In cystic fibrosis (CF), excessive furin activity plays a critical role in the activation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), dysregulation of which contributes to airway dehydration, ineffective mucociliary clearance (MCC), and mucus obstruction. Here, we report a highly selective, cell-permeable furin inhibitor, BOS-318, that derives selectivity by eliciting the formation of a new, unexpected binding pocket independent of the active site catalytic triad. Using human ex vivo models, BOS-318 showed significant suppression of ENaC, which led to enhanced airway hydration and an ∼30-fold increase in MCC rate. Furin inhibition also protected ENaC from subsequent activation by neutrophil elastase, a soluble protease dominant in CF airways. Additional therapeutic benefits include protection against epithelial cell death induced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A. Our findings demonstrate the utility of selective furin inhibition as a mutation-agnostic approach that can correct features of CF airway pathophysiology in a manner expected to deliver therapeutic value.

Abstract: Summary
Lesioning and neurophysiological studies have facilitated the elucidation of cortical functions and mechanisms of functional recovery following injury. Clinical translation of such studies is contingent on their employment in non-human primates (NHPs), yet tools for monitoring and modulating cortical physiology are incompatible with conventional lesioning techniques. To address these challenges, we developed a toolbox validated in seven macaques. We introduce the photothrombotic method for inducing focal cortical lesions, a quantitative model for designing experiment-specific lesion profiles and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) for large-scale (∼5 cm2) monitoring of vascular dynamics. We integrate these tools with our electrocorticographic array for large-scale monitoring of neural dynamics and testing stimulation-based interventions. Advantageously, this versatile toolbox can be incorporated into established chronic cranial windows. By combining optical and electrophysiological techniques in the NHP cortex, we can enhance our understanding of cortical functions, investigate functional recovery mechanisms, integrate physiological and behavioral findings, and develop neurorehabilitative treatments.

Abstract: Summary
SARS-CoV-2 lineages have diverged into highly prevalent variants termed “variants of concern” (VOCs). Here, we characterized emerging SARS-CoV-2 spike polymorphisms in vitro and in vivo to understand their impact on transmissibility and virus pathogenicity and fitness. We demonstrate that the substitution S:655Y, represented in the gamma and omicron VOCs, enhances viral replication and spike protein cleavage. The S:655Y substitution was transmitted more efficiently than its ancestor S:655H in the hamster infection model and was able to outcompete S:655H in the hamster model and in a human primary airway system. Finally, we analyzed a set of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants to investigate how different sets of mutations may impact spike processing. All VOCs tested exhibited increased spike cleavage and fusogenic capacity. Taken together, our study demonstrates that the spike mutations present in VOCs that become epidemiologically prevalent in humans are linked to an increase in spike processing and virus transmission.

Abstract: Summary
SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) that increase transmission or disease severity or reduce diagnostic or vaccine efficacy continue to emerge across the world. Current methods available to rapidly detect these can be resource intensive and thus sub-optimal for large-scale deployment needed during a pandemic response. Here, we describe a CRISPR-based assay that detects mutations in spike gene CRISPR PAM motif or seed regions to identify a pan-specific VOC single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)) ((D614G) and Alpha- and Delta-specific (S982A and D950N) SNPs. This assay exhibits good diagnostic sensitivity and strain specificity with nasal swabs and is designed for use in laboratory and point-of-care settings. This should enable rapid, high-throughput VOC identification required for surveillance and characterization efforts to inform clinical and public health decisions. Furthermore, the assay can be adapted to target similar SNPs associated with emerging SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, or other rapidly evolving viruses.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor recurrence is often attributed to cancer stem cells (CSCs). We previously demonstrated that down-regulation of Pregnane X Receptor (PXR) decreases the chemoresistance of CSCs and prevents colorectal cancer recurrence. Currently, no PXR inhibitor is usable in clinic. Here, we identify miR-148a as a targetable element upstream of PXR signaling in CSCs, which when over-expressed decreases PXR expression and impairs tumor relapse after chemotherapy in mouse tumor xenografts. We then develop a fluorescent reporter screen for miR-148a activators and identify the anti-helminthic drug niclosamide as an inducer of miR-148a expression. Consequently, niclosamide decreased PXR expression and CSC numbers in colorectal cancer patient-derived cell lines and synergized with chemotherapeutic agents to prevent CSC chemoresistance and tumor recurrence in vivo. Our study suggests that endogenous miRNA inducers is a viable strategy to down-regulate PXR and illuminates niclosamide as a neoadjuvant repurposing strategy to prevent tumor relapse in colon cancer.

Abstract: Background
Osteosarcoma is a disease with high mortality of malignant tumors in children and adolescents. CDC42 effector protein 3 (CDC42EP3) has been reported to be associated with human cancer cell progression. This study aimed to investigate the biological function and preliminary molecular mechanism of CDC42EP3 in osteosarcoma.
Methods
CDC42EP3 expression in osteosarcoma was analyzed by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. Secondly, the biological effects of CDC42EP3 in osteosarcoma cells was determined by loss/gain-of-function assays in vitro and in vivo.
Results
CDC42EP3 expression was higher in osteosarcoma tissue than in noncancerous tissue. The expression of CDC42EP3 was positively correlated with age, pathological stage and grade of patients with osteosarcoma. Furthermore, downregulation of CDC42EP3 suppressed tumor progression by inhibiting proliferation, migration and inducing apoptosis in vivo. Importantly, knockdown of CDC42EP3 reduced the expression of interstitial markers (N-cadherin, Vimentin and Snail) and increased the expression of epithelial markers (E-cadherin). In addition, CDC42EP3 knockdown downregulated PI3K and reduced the phosphorylation levels of AKT and mTOR. The mice xenograft model further confirmed that CDC42EP3 knockdown inhibited osteosarcoma growth in vitro.
Conclusions
In summary, these findings highlighted the significance of CDC42EP3 in tumor progression, which implicated CDC42EP3 as a promising candidate molecular target for osteosarcoma therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Among men, prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-associated mortality, with advanced disease remaining a major clinical challenge. We describe a small molecule, SU086, as a therapeutic strategy for advanced prostate cancer. We demonstrate that SU086 inhibits the growth of prostate cancer cells in vitro, cell-line and patient-derived xenografts in vivo, and ex vivo prostate cancer patient specimens. Furthermore, SU086 in combination with standard of care second-generation anti-androgen therapies displays increased impairment of prostate cancer cell and tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Cellular thermal shift assay reveals that SU086 binds to heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and leads to a decrease in HSP90 levels. Proteomic profiling demonstrates that SU086 binds to and decreases HSP90. Metabolomic profiling reveals that SU086 leads to perturbation of glycolysis. Our study identifies SU086 as a treatment for advanced prostate cancer as a single agent or when combined with second-generation anti-androgens.

Abstract: Summary
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) of various types are released or shed from all cells. EVs carry proteins and contain additional protein and nucleic acid cargo that relates to their biogenesis and cell of origin. EV cargo in liquid biopsies is of widespread interest owing to its ability to provide a retrospective snapshot of cell state at the time of EV release. For the purposes of EV cargo analysis and repertoire profiling, multiplex assays are an essential tool in multiparametric analyte studies but are still being developed for high-parameter EV protein detection. Although bead-based EV multiplex analyses offer EV profiling capabilities with conventional flow cytometers, the utilization of EV multiplex assays has been limited by the lack of software analysis tools for such assays. To facilitate robust EV repertoire studies, we developed multiplex analysis post-acquisition analysis (MPAPASS) open-source software for stitched multiplex analysis, EV database-compatible reporting, and visualization of EV repertoires.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic mutations in dystrophin manifest in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the most commonly inherited muscle disease. Here, we report on reprogramming of fibroblasts from two DMD mouse models into induced myogenic progenitor cells (iMPCs) by MyoD overexpression in concert with small molecule treatment. DMD iMPCs proliferate extensively, while expressing myogenic stem cell markers including Pax7 and Myf5. Additionally, DMD iMPCs readily give rise to multinucleated myofibers that express mature skeletal muscle markers; however, they lack DYSTROPHIN expression. Utilizing an exon skipping-based approach with CRISPR/Cas9, we report on genetic correction of the dystrophin mutation in DMD iMPCs and restoration of protein expression in vitro. Furthermore, engraftment of corrected DMD iMPCs into the muscles of dystrophic mice restored DYSTROPHIN expression and contributed to the muscle stem cell reservoir. Collectively, our findings report on a novel in vitro cellular model for DMD and utilize it in conjunction with gene editing to restore DYSTROPHIN expression in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Senescent cells are responsible, in part, for tissue decline during aging. Here, we focused on CNS neural precursor cells (NPCs) to ask if this is because senescent cells in stem cell niches impair precursor-mediated tissue maintenance. We demonstrate an aging-dependent accumulation of senescent cells, largely senescent NPCs, within the hippocampal stem cell niche coincident with declining adult neurogenesis. Pharmacological ablation of senescent cells via acute systemic administration of the senolytic drug ABT-263 (Navitoclax) caused a rapid increase in NPC proliferation and neurogenesis. Genetic ablation of senescent cells similarly activated hippocampal NPCs. This acute burst of neurogenesis had long-term effects in middle-aged mice. One month post-ABT-263, adult-born hippocampal neuron numbers increased and hippocampus-dependent spatial memory was enhanced. These data support a model where senescent niche cells negatively influence neighboring non-senescent NPCs during aging, and ablation of these senescent cells partially restores neurogenesis and hippocampus-dependent cognition.

Abstract: Summary
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a fatal disease pathologically typified by motor and cortical neurodegeneration as well as microgliosis. The FUS P525L mutation is highly penetrant and causes ALS cases with earlier disease onset and more aggressive progression. To date, how P525L mutations may affect microglia during ALS pathogenesis had not been explored. In this study, we engineered isogenic control and P525L mutant FUS in independent human iPSC lines and differentiated them into microglia-like cells. We report that the P525L mutation causes FUS protein to mislocalize from the nucleus to cytoplasm. Homozygous P525L mutations perturb the transcriptome profile in which many differentially expressed genes are associated with microglial functions. Specifically, the dysregulation of several chemoreceptor genes leads to altered chemoreceptor-activated calcium signaling. However, other microglial functions such as phagocytosis and cytokine release are not significantly affected. Our study underscores the cell-autonomous effects of the ALS-linked FUS P525L mutation in a human microglia model.

Abstract: Determining the prognosis of patients remains a challenge due to the phenotypic and molecular diversities of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). We aimed to evaluate the role of SMYD5 in HCC. Wilcoxon signed-rank test and logistic regression analyzed the relationship between clinical pathologic features and SMYD5. We found that increased expression of SMYD5 in HCC was closely associated with high histologic grade, stage, T stage and nodal stage. Kaplan-Meier method, Cox regression, univariate analysis and multivariate analysis detected overall survival of TCGA-HCC patients. It turned out that high expression of SMYD5 predicted a worse prognosis in HCC. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was applied via TCGA data set, which indicated that complement and coagulation cascades, fatty acid metabolism, primary bile acid biosynthesis, drug metabolism cytochrome P450, PPAR signaling pathway and retinol metabolism were differentially enriched in SMYD5 high expression phenotype. Interestingly, we proved that SMYD5 upregulation in HCC cells was induced by promoter hypo-methylation. Moreover, functional experiments demonstrated that SMYD5 silencing abrogated cell proliferation, migration and invasion and enhanced paclitaxel sensitivity in HCC. All findings implied that SMYD5 might be an underlying biomarker for prognosis and treatment of HCC.

Abstract: p15INK4b (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B, CDKN2B, p15), a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI) belonging to the INK4 family, plays an important role in hematopoiesis. Its expression level was positively related to the blockage effects of RUNX1b at the early stage. Experiments using human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines with inducible p15 expression suggested that p15 overexpression can significantly decrease the proportion of KDR+ cells in S and G2-M stages 4 days after induction from day 0. Moreover, p15 overexpression from the early stage can decrease production of CD34highCD43− cells and their derivative populations, but not CD34lowCD43− cells. These effects were weakened if induction was delayed and disappeared if induction started after day 6. All these effects were counteracted by inhibition of TGF-β signaling. TGF-β1 stimulation elicited similar effects as p15 overexpression. RUNX1 overexpression and activation of the TGF-β signaling pathway upregulate the expression of p15, which is partially responsible for blockade of hematopoiesis and relevant to a change in the cell cycle status. However, it is possible that other mechanisms are involved in the regulation of hematopoiesis.

Abstract: Summary
Rett syndrome may be treated by reactivating the silent copy of Mecp2 from the inactive X chromosome in female cells. Most studies that model Mecp2 reactivation have used mouse fibroblasts rather than neural cells, which would be critical for phenotypic reversal, and rely on fluorescent reporters that lack adequate sensitivity. Here, we present a mouse model based on a dual bioluminescent and fluorescent reporter to assess the level of reactivation of Mecp2 and the inactive X chromosome by treating neural stem cells with 5-azacytidine and Xist knockdown. We show that reactivation of Mecp2 and other X-linked genes correlates with CpG density, with distance from escapees, and, very strongly, with the presence of short interspersed nuclear elements. In addition, X-linked genes reactivated in neural stem cells overlap substantially with early reactivating genes by induced pluripotent stem cell reprogramming of fibroblasts or neuronal progenitors, indicating that X chromosome reactivation follows similar paths regardless of the technique or cell type used.

Abstract: Summary
Phospholamban (PLN) is a key regulator that controls the function of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and is required for the regulation of cardiac contractile function. Although PLN-deficient mice demonstrated improved cardiac function, PLN loss in humans can result in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) or heart failure (HF). The CRISPR-Cas9 technology was used to create a PLN knockout human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) line in this study. PLN deletion hiPSCs-CMs had enhanced contractility at day 30, but proceeded to a cardiac failure phenotype at day 60, with decreased contractility, mitochondrial damage, increased ROS production, cellular energy metabolism imbalance, and poor Ca2+ handling. Furthermore, adding ranolazine to PLN knockout hiPSCs-CMs at day 60 can partially restore Ca2+ handling disorders and cellular energy metabolism, alleviating the PLN knockout phenotype of HF, implying that the disorder of intracellular Ca2+ transport and the imbalance of cellular energy metabolism are the primary mechanisms for PLN deficiency pathogenesis.

Abstract: Several genetic defects on thick ascending limb (TAL) of Henle loop were reported to cause Bartter syndrome (BS) characterized by metabolic alkalosis, hypokalemia, and normal or low blood pressure. Among them, defective basolateral calcium sensing receptors (CaSR) on TAL could result in type V BS that not only presents typical characteristics of BS but also hypocalcemia. Herein we report a 54 years old female patient with a novel mutation of CaSR that leads to type V BS. A sequencing of CaSR gene in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and urine stem cells both disclosed a heterozygous substitution of thymine for guanine (NM_001178065.1:c.2570T > G) in exon 7 at codon 857 resulting in substitution of isoleucine for serine (p.I857S). We performed functional tests of the mutant CaSR gene in vitro using urine stem cells to determine whether this mutation is responsible for the clinical presentations. Urine stem cells expressing abundant CaSR on flow cytometry of this patient and a normal subject were obtained for in vitro functional studies, including intracellular calcium and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate concentrations in response to increasing concentrations of extracellular calcium. The results show all of their responses to extracellular calcium are extremely sensitive in urine stem cells of the case as compared to those of the normal subject, indicating a prominent gain-of-function mutation. A novel mutation I857S in transmembrane domain 7 of CaSR in our patient would be added to the list of mutations leading to type V BS.

Abstract: Summary
The formation of the primitive streak (PS) and the subsequent induction of neuroectoderm are hallmarks of gastrulation. Combining an in vitro reconstitution of this process based on mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) with a collection of knockouts in reporter mESC lines, we identified retinoic acid (RA) as a critical mediator of early neural induction triggered by TGFβ or Wnt signaling inhibition. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis captured the temporal unfolding of cell type diversification, up to the emergence of somite and neural fates. In the absence of the RA-synthesizing enzyme Aldh1a2, a sensitive RA reporter revealed a hitherto unidentified residual RA signaling that specified neural fate. Genetic evidence showed that the RA-degrading enzyme Cyp26a1 protected PS-like cells from neural induction, even in the absence of TGFβ and Wnt antagonists. Overall, we characterized a multi-layered control of RA levels that regulates early neural differentiation in an in vitro PS-like system.

Abstract: Summary
Analysis of large-scale human genomic data has yielded unexplained mutations known to cause severe disease in healthy individuals. Here, we report the unexpected recovery of a rare dominant lethal mutation in TPM1, a sarcomeric actin-binding protein, in eight individuals with large atrial septal defect (ASD) in a five-generation pedigree. Mice with Tpm1 mutation exhibit early embryonic lethality with disrupted myofibril assembly and no heartbeat. However, patient-induced pluripotent-stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes show normal beating with mild myofilament defect, indicating disease suppression. A variant in TLN2, another myofilament actin-binding protein, is identified as a candidate suppressor. Mouse CRISPR knock-in (KI) of both the TLN2 and TPM1 variants rescues heart beating, with near-term fetuses exhibiting large ASD. Thus, the role of TPM1 in ASD pathogenesis unfolds with suppression of its embryonic lethality by protective TLN2 variant. These findings provide evidence that genetic resiliency can arise with genetic suppression of a deleterious mutation.

Abstract: Vascular calcification (VC) is a strong predictor of cardiovascular mortality and overall mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD); however, the molecular mechanisms underlying VC have yet to be elucidated. Here, we report the role of the deubiquitinating enzyme BRCC36 in the process of VC in CKD. We established an in vitro VC model of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and an adenine-induced CKD mouse model. The expression of BRCC36 was significantly decreased in both the in vivo and in vitro VC models. Alizarin red staining and calcium content assays showed that BRCC36 overexpression reduced calcium deposition in the presence of calcifying medium, while the contractile protein α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) was upregulated and phosphorylated β-catenin was downregulated. Cell immunofluorescence showed that BRCC36 overexpression also reduced the expression of phosphorylated β-catenin in the nucleus in the presence of calcifying medium. In addition, coimmunoprecipitation showed that BRCC36 can bind to β-catenin. These results suggest that BRCC36 can interact with β-catenin, the main effector protein of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, inhibiting the phosphorylation of β-catenin and negatively regulating the cell signalling pathway, thereby inhibiting VC. This may provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of VC in the context of CKD.

Abstract: Glucocorticoid (GC)-induced osteoporosis (GIOP) is the most common type of secondary osteoporosis. Osteoblast apoptosis induced by GCs is now considered as a crucial factor for GIOP. Many clinical, in vivo, and in vitro studies have shown that metformin has a beneficial effect on bone metabolism and bone formation. To investigate whether metformin could be used to treat GIOP, we explored the influence of metformin on dexamethasone (Dex)-induced apoptosis of osteoblasts and its underlying mechanisms. In this study, the CCK8 assay was used to determine the optimal metformin concentration and processing time. The expression levels of target proteins were examined by Western blot and immunofluorescence; the expression levels of target genes were tested by quantitative PCR. Apoptotic cells were detected using flow cytometry. Characteristics of autophagy were observed by transmission electron microscopy. An autophagy inhibitor was administered to investigate whether autophagy decreases apoptosis. Sh-AMPK transfection and an mTOR activator were used to investigate the role of AMPK/mTOR signaling in metformin-induced autophagy. The results showed that metformin alleviated Dex-induced apoptosis of osteoblasts accompanied by increased autophagy. Treatment with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) attenuated the effect of metformin on apoptosis, autophagy, and the AMPK/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway. The anti-apoptotic effect of metformin on osteoblasts is associated with the promotion of autophagy. Furthermore, sh-AMPK transfection and the mTOR activator MHY1485 impaired metformin-mediated inhibition of osteoblast apoptosis and promotion of autophagy. The AMPK/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway plays a role in metformin-mediated apoptosis suppression and autophagy promotion. In conclusion, metformin can alleviate Dex-induced osteoblast apoptosis by inducing autophagy via the AMPK/mTOR/p70S6K pathway. This study highlights the potential value of metformin in the treatment of GIOP.

Abstract: The Arabidopsis thaliana glycine-rich domain protein 2 (AtGRDP2) gene encodes a protein of unknown function that is involved in plant growth and salt stress tolerance. The AtGRDP2 protein (787 aa, At4g37900) is constituted by three domains: a DUF1399 located at the N-terminus, a potential RNA Recognition Motif (RRM) in the central region, and a short glycine-rich domain at the C-terminus. Herein, we analyzed the subcellular localization of AtGRDP2 protein as a GFP translational fusion and found it was localized in the cytosol and the nucleus of tobacco leaf cells. Truncated versions of AtGRDP2 showed that the DUF1399 or the RRM domains were sufficient for nuclear localization. In addition, we performed a yeast two-hybrid split-ubiquitin assay (Y2H) to identify potential interactors for AtGRDP2 protein. The Y2H assay identified proteins associated with RNA binding functions such as PABN3 (At5g65260), EF-1α (At1g07920), and CL15 (At3g25920). Heterodimeric associations in planta between AtGRDP2 and its interactors were carried out by Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC) assays. The data revealed heterodimeric interactions between AtGRDP2 and PABN3 in the nucleus and AtGRDP2 with EF-1α in the cytosol, while AtGRDP2-CL15 associations occurred only in the chloroplasts. Finally, functional characterization of the protein-protein interaction regions revealed that both DUF1399 and RRM domains were key for heterodimerization with its interactors. The AtGRDP2 interaction with these proteins in different compartments suggests that this glycine-rich domain protein is involved in post-transcriptional processes.

Abstract: Summary
Few approaches have been made toward exploring autologous NK cells in settings of cancer immunotherapy. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of infusing multiple doses of ex vivo activated and expanded autologous NK cells in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) post-autologous stem cell transplantation. Infused NK cells were detected in circulation up to 4 weeks after the last infusion. Elevations in plasma granzyme B levels were observed following each consecutive NK cell infusion. Moreover, increased granzyme B levels were detected in bone marrow 4 weeks after the last infusion. All measurable patients had objective, detectable responses after NK cell infusions in terms of reduction in M-component and/or minimal residual disease. The present study demonstrates that autologous NK cell-based immunotherapy is feasible in a setting of MM consolidation therapy. It opens up the possibility for usage of autologous NK cells in clinical settings where patients are not readily eligible for allogeneic NK cell-based immunotherapies.

Abstract: Regeneration of the endometrial stromal compartment in premenopausal women is likely maintained by the perivascular endometrial mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (eMSC) expressing sushi domain containing 2 (SUSD2). The fate of SUSD2+ eMSC during pregnancy and their role in decidualization is not fully known. The aim of our study was to determine the effect of progesterone on the stemness of the SUSD2+ eMSC isolated from non-pregnant uterine samples. Secondary objectives were to characterize the functional capacity including differentiation and clonogenicity assays of SUSD2+ eMSC isolated from decidua at full term and compare it to the capacity of those isolated from non-pregnant uterine samples. Progesterone treatment induced changes in the decidual gene expression profile in non-pregnant SUSD2+ eMSC. Data analysis of a publicly available single cell RNA-seq data set revealed differential expression of several mesenchymal and epithelial signature genes between the SUSD2+ eMSC and the decidual stromal cells, suggesting mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition occurs during decidualization. Histological analysis revealed a significantly lower abundance of SUSD2+ eMSC in 1st trimester and full term samples compared to non-pregnant samples, p = 0.0296 and 0.005, respectively. The differentiation and the colony forming capacity did not differ significantly between the cells isolated from non-pregnant and pregnant uterine samples. Our results suggest that SUSD2+ eMSC undergo decidualization in vitro, while maintaining MSC plasma membrane phenotype. Human eMSC seem to play an important role in the course of endometrial decidualization and embryo implantation. Pregnancy reduced the abundance of SUSD2+ eMSC, however eMSC function remains intact.

Abstract: C9ORF78 is a poorly characterized protein found in diverse eukaryotes. Previous work indicated overexpression of C9ORF78 in malignant tissues indicating a possible involvement in growth regulatory pathways. Additional studies in fission yeast and humans uncover a potential function in regulating the spliceosome. In studies of GFP-tagged C9ORF78 we observed a dramatic reduction in protein abundance in cells grown to confluence and/or deprived of serum growth factors. Serum stimulation induced synchronous re-expression of the protein in HeLa cells. This effect was also observed with the endogenous protein. Overexpressing either E2F1 or N-Myc resulted in elevated C9ORF78 expression potentially explaining the serum-dependent upregulation of the protein. Immunofluorescence analysis indicates that C9ORF78 localizes to nuclei in interphase but does not appear to concentrate in speckles as would be expected for a splicing protein. Surprisingly, a subpopulation of C9ORF78 co-localizes with ACA, Mad1 and Ndc80 in mitotic cells suggesting that this protein associates with kinetochores or centromeres. Levels of C9ORF78 at the centromere/kinetochore also increased upon activation of the mitotic checkpoint. Furthermore, knocking-down C9ORF78 caused mitotic defects. These studies uncover novel mitotic function and subcellular localization of C9ORF78.

Abstract: Excessive oxidative stress and decreased antioxidant capacity of macrophages are initial factors which cause macrophages to transform to foam cells, which represents a key event in the progression of atherosclerosis (AS). BML-111, the analog of lipoxin A4 (LXA4) strongly attenuated high fat (HF) diet-induced atherosclerosis by activating NF-E2 related factor 2 (Nrf2). However, the effect was not through a specific LXA4 receptor (formyl peptide receptor 2, FPR2). BML-111 also strongly inhibited HF diet-induced promotion of MDA level, increased HDL level and decreased IL-1, MCP-1, IL-6, VCAM, ICAM and TNF-α level in aorta. In the in vitro experiments, LXA4 inhibited THP-1 cells to transform to foam cells via Nrf2 pathway. Our findings demonstrated that LXA4 and its analog prevented AS induced by HF diet in SD rats, under which the possible mechanism is through Keap1/Nrf2 pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is associated with an increased reliance on heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), but it is not clear what other protein homeostasis (proteostasis) factors might be involved. To address this question, we performed functional and synthetic lethal screens in four prostate cancer cell lines. These screens confirmed key roles for HSP70, HSP90, and their co-chaperones, but also suggested that the mitochondrial chaperone, HSP60/HSPD1, is selectively required in CRPC cell lines. Knockdown of HSP60 does not impact the stability of androgen receptor (AR) or its variants; rather, it is associated with loss of mitochondrial spare respiratory capacity, partly owing to increased proton leakage. Finally, transcriptional data revealed a correlation between HSP60 levels and poor survival of prostate cancer patients. These findings suggest that re-wiring of the proteostasis network is associated with CRPC, creating selective vulnerabilities that might be targeted to treat the disease.

Abstract: Summary
Genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) are widely used to measure calcium transients in neuronal somata and processes, and their use enables the determination of action potential temporal series in a large population of neurons. Here, we generate a transgenic mouse line expressing a highly sensitive green GECI, G-CaMP9a, in a Flp-dependent manner in excitatory and inhibitory neuronal subpopulations downstream of a strong CAG promoter. Combining this reporter mouse with viral or mouse genetic Flp delivery methods produces a robust and stable G-CaMP9a expression in defined neuronal populations without detectable detrimental effects. In vivo two-photon imaging reveals spontaneous and sensory-evoked calcium transients in excitatory and inhibitory ensembles with cellular resolution. Our results show that this reporter line allows long-term, cell-type-specific investigation of neuronal activity with enhanced resolution in defined populations and facilitates dissecting complex dynamics of neural networks in vivo.

Abstract: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) plays key roles in cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and immunosuppression. In many human cancer cells, STAT3 is hyperactivated, which leads to tumor progression and drug resistance, and therefore STAT3 and its modulators are considered effective drug targets. However, the complex regulatory mechanisms of STAT3 have made it difficult to develop potent anticancer drugs that suppress its activity. Here, we report serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) as a novel regulator of STAT3 signaling and an effective target for combination therapy with Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. We screened small molecules using a gain-of-function mutant of STAT3 resistant to JAK inhibition and found that an SGK1 inhibitor suppressed the constitutive activation of STAT3. Importantly, our results revealed that SGK1 also mediated the activation of wild-type STAT3. Further examination suggested that the tuberous sclerosis complex 2 and mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway were involved in STAT3 activation by SGK1. Finally, we demonstrated that SGK1 inhibition enhanced the inhibitory effect of a JAK inhibitor on STAT3 phosphorylation and cancer cell proliferation. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of STAT3 activation and suggest SGK1 as a potential target for STAT3-targeted combination cancer therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes have been established to detect dynamic calcium transients by fast kinetic fluorescence assays that provide insights into specific aspects of clinical cardiac activity. However, the precise derivation and use of waveform parameters to predict cardiac activity merit deeper investigation. In this study, we derived, evaluated, and applied 38 waveform parameters in a novel Python framework, including (among others) peak frequency, peak amplitude, peak widths, and a novel parameter, shoulder-tail ratio. We then trained a random forest model to predict cardiac activity based on the 25 parameters selected by correlation analysis. The area under the curve (AUC) obtained for leave-one-compound-out cross-validation was 0.86, thereby replicating the predictions of conventional methods and outperforming fingerprint-based methods by a large margin. This work demonstrates that machine learning is able to automate the assessment of cardiovascular liability from waveform data, reducing any risk of user-to-user variability and bias.

Abstract: Summary
Inhibition of PIKfyve phosphoinositide kinase selectively kills autophagy-dependent cancer cells by disrupting lysosome homeostasis. Here, we show that PIKfyve inhibitors can also selectively eliminate pluripotent embryonal carcinoma cells (ECCs), embryonic stem cells, and induced pluripotent stem cells under conditions where differentiated cells remain viable. PIKfyve inhibitors prevented lysosome fission, induced autophagosome accumulation, and reduced cell proliferation in both pluripotent and differentiated cells, but they induced death only in pluripotent cells. The ability of PIKfyve inhibitors to distinguish between pluripotent and differentiated cells was confirmed with xenografts derived from ECCs. Pretreatment of ECCs with the PIKfyve specific inhibitor WX8 suppressed their ability to form teratocarcinomas in mice, and intraperitoneal injections of WX8 into mice harboring teratocarcinoma xenografts selectively eliminated pluripotent cells. Differentiated cells continued to proliferate, but at a reduced rate. These results provide a proof of principle that PIKfyve specific inhibitors can selectively eliminate pluripotent stem cells in vivo as well as in vitro.

Abstract: Summary
We report a droplet microfluidic method to target and sort individual cells directly from complex microbiome samples and to prepare these cells for bulk whole-genome sequencing without cultivation. We characterize this approach by recovering bacteria spiked into human stool samples at a ratio as low as 1:250 and by successfully enriching endogenous Bacteroides vulgatus to the level required for de novo assembly of high-quality genomes. Although microbiome strains are increasingly demanded for biomedical applications, a vast majority of species and strains are uncultivated and without reference genomes. We address this shortcoming by encapsulating complex microbiome samples directly into microfluidic droplets and amplifying a target-specific genomic fragment using a custom molecular TaqMan probe. We separate those positive droplets by droplet sorting, selectively enriching single target strain cells. Finally, we present a protocol to purify the genomic DNA while specifically removing amplicons and cell debris for high-quality genome sequencing.

Abstract: Summary
The presentation and underlying pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is complex and heterogeneous. Recent studies attempted to stratify T2D into distinct subgroups using data-driven approaches, but their clinical utility may be limited if categorical representations of complex phenotypes are suboptimal. We apply a soft-clustering (archetype) method to characterize newly diagnosed T2D based on 32 clinical variables. We assign quantitative clustering scores for individuals and investigate the associations with glycemic deterioration, genetic risk scores, circulating omics biomarkers, and phenotypic stability over 36 months. Four archetype profiles represent dysfunction patterns across combinations of T2D etiological processes and correlate with multiple circulating biomarkers. One archetype associated with obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and impaired β cell glucose sensitivity corresponds with the fastest disease progression and highest demand for anti-diabetic treatment. We demonstrate that clinical heterogeneity in T2D can be mapped to heterogeneity in individual etiological processes, providing a potential route to personalized treatments.
