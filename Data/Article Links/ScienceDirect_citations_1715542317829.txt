Abstract: ELF3 is one of the member of transcription factors from E-twenty-six family, its role varies in different types of cancer. However, the role and specific mechanisms of ELF3 in the development of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) still remains largely unknown. In our study, ELF3 was observed to be upregulated in NSCLC tissues compared to the corresponding normal lung tissue at mRNA and protein levels, and its expression level was correlated with the overall survival of patients with NSCLC. Silencing of the ELF3 gene in NSCLC cells inhibited the proliferation and metastasis significantly in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, overexpression of ELF3 in NSCLC cells promoted cancer growth and metastasis in vitro. Mechanistically, ELF3 activated PI3K/AKT and ERK signaling pathways and its downstream effectors, thus regulating the cell cycle and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Furthermore, the promotive effects of ELF3 on cellular proliferation and metastasis could be rescued by Ly294002 (inhibitor of PI3K) and U0126 (inhibitor of MEK1/2). The results show that ELF3 promotes cell growth and metastasis by regulating PI3K/Akt and ERK pathways in NSCLC and that it may be a promising new target for the treatment of NSCLC patients.

Abstract: Absract
The influence of oxygen-related thermal donors (TDs) on the performance of silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells was explored experimentally in this paper. It is found that a certain number of thermal donors could do much harm to the performance of SHJ solar cells. The efficiency of SHJ solar cells is usually reduced by a value of ~ 1% absolute in the case of thermal donors with a concentration of nearly 1015 cm−3. The microwave photoconductance decay and Hall Effect studies have proved that the TDs can significantly reduce the carrier lifetime of n-type silicon substrate, but have no influence on the carrier mobility. Deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) measurements have further demonstrated that the TDs cause an energy level at Ec-0.13 eV with carrier capture cross-section of 10−15 cm2, which is responsible for the reduction of carrier lifetime and solar cell efficiency.

Abstract: Various ion storage layers were fabricated on ITO-glass substrates by a dry deposition process to study their effects in electrochromic devices. Dense nickel oxide (NiO) film was formed using micro-sized NiO particles, a porous film was formed using nano-sized NiO particles, and a porous antimony tin oxide (ATO) film was formed using nano-sized ATO particles. Electrochemical analyses revealed that the nano-porous NiO layer had a high charge capacity with a low charge transfer resistance. Moreover, an electrochromic device using a NiO film with nano-sized pores had an optical transmittance difference of 42% and a stable cyclic transmittance for 1h at a wavelength of 630nm. We assessed the effects of the different ion storage layers by evaluating the electrochromic device in terms of the following important properties: 1) high charge capacity, 2) low charge transfer resistance at the interface between film and electrolyte, and 3) high diffusion rate from film to electrolyte. Based on these criteria, we found that the ion storage layer formed with nano-sized NiO particles best satisfied these conditions. Finally, we confirmed that stable and high electrochromic performance can be achieved through improving these properties in ion storage layers.

Abstract: Myoblast differentiation is a highly complex process that is regulated by proteins as well as by non-coding RNAs. Circular RNAs have been identified as an emerging new class of non-coding RNA in the modulation of skeletal muscle development, whereas their expression profiles and functional regulation in myoblast differentiation remain unknown. In the present study, we performed deep RNA-sequencing of C2C12 myoblasts during cell differentiation and uncovered 37,751 unique circular RNAs derived from 6943 hosting genes. The ensuing qRT-PCR and RNA ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization verification were carried out to confirm the RNA-sequencing results. An unbiased analysis demonstrated dynamic circular RNA expression changes in the process of myoblast differentiation, and the circular RNA abundances were independent from their cognate linear RNAs. Gene ontology analysis showed that many down-regulated circular RNAs were exclusive to cell division and the cell cycle, whereas up-regulated circular RNAs were related to the cell development process. Furthermore, interaction networks of circular RNA-microRNA were constructed. Several microRNAs well-known for myoblast regulation, such as miR-133, miR-24 and miR-23a, were in this network. In summary, this study showed that circular RNA expression dynamics changed during myoblast differentiation. Circular RNAs play a role in regulating the myoblast cell cycle and development by acting as microRNA binding sites to facilitate their regulation of gene expression during myoblast differentiation. These findings open a new avenue for future investigation of this emerging RNA class in skeletal muscle growth and development.

Abstract: Structural variants of boron subphthalocyanines were tested as light absorbing and electron donating materials paired with C60 in organic photovoltaic cells, in a rooftop ambient environment according to ISOS-O3 protocols. Constant current monitoring and daily current-voltage sweeps, reinforced by irradiance and temperature tracking, reveal differing degradation rates depending on the chemical structure of the boron subphthalocyanine. Results suggest that the observed initial burn-in efficiency loss observed in all devices is due to C60, but that the longer term degradation trend is attributable to the chemical breakdown of the subphthalocyanine donors through hydrolysis. These findings demonstrate that the molecular structure of boron subphthalocyanines is a significant handle on device longevity, and that a structure-property relationship can be established for stability. The results also highlight the need for alternative electron accepting materials to C60 for pairing with boron subphthalocyanines in planar heterojunction solar cells, as well as the necessity of a more robust encapsulation methodology.

Abstract: SnO2 with its excellent properties such as high optical transparency, suitable band energy and high electron mobility, recently has received special attention from researchers as an outstanding electron transport layer (ETL) for optoelectronic devices. Here, we demonstrate that SnO2 combined with ionic liquid (IL), 1-benzyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([BzMIM]Cl), based on low-temperature solution-processed can be an excellent ETL for efficient inverted organic solar cells (iOSCs). Our best performance with P3HT:PC60BM based iOSCs using SnO2/IL as an ETL, has achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.05%, which is the highest reported value so far and was a 38% increase compared to that of SnO2 only (2.94%). Using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, we found that the work function of the cathode decreased significantly from − 4.38eV to − 3.82eV for SnO2/IL, an outstanding feature that is necessary for an ideal ETL. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies revealed a significant lower transport resistance and an efficient charge extraction at the interface between photoactive layer and the electrode for the SnO2/IL-based iOSC than for the SnO2 only device. The iOSC devices using SnO2/IL showed excellent long-term stability, with a PCE of ~ 81% compared to the initial value after storage for 2.5 months in ambient conditions. This low-temperature solution-processed SnO2/IL is expected for low-cost, high throughput, roll-to-roll process on flexible substrates for iOSC as well as other optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: α-Fe2O3/Au/ZnO hetrostructured thin films were fabricated using chemical spray pyrolysis technique and implemented as photoanode for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Photoactivity of α-Fe2O3/Au/ZnO electrodes for PEC water oxidation under solar radiation was efficiently improved as compared to that for α-Fe2O3, α-Fe2O3/Au and α-Fe2O3/ZnO electrodes. The α-Fe2O3/Au/ZnO photoanode displayed a significant increase in photocurrent density of 250µA/cm2, as compared to α-Fe2O3 (photocurrent density~27µA/cm2), at 0.5V vs. SCE in 0.5M NaOH under AM 1.5G illumination indicating enhanced optical absorption and charge transportation. The presence of Au layer favored the charge transfer from α-Fe2O3 to ZnO via high energy coupled surface plasmons. The charge transfer kinetics was further improved by tuning of the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band of Au nanoparticles (NPs) using electric field assisted spray pyrolysis. The maximum photocurrent density of 500µA/cm2 (at 0.5V vs. SCE) was obtained for α-Fe2O30.5kV/Au/ZnO electrode. The optimized design using Au sandwiched layer between two different band gap semiconductors with creation of different hetrojunctions (α-Fe2O3/ZnO and ZnO/Au) presented a configuration with enhanced optoelectronic properties, which is highly useful for PEC water splitting.

Abstract: We measure the short circuit current improvement of various commercial backsheets for passivated emitter and rear solar cells (PERC) in photovoltaic (PV) modules. We quantify this improvement by a light recovery factor k defined as the share of the light reflected by the backsheet around the cell in a PV module laminate, which is converted into electrical current by the solar cells in the module relative to a reference rear surface. The presented measurement method allows measuring the light recovery factor as function of the incident light beam angle, which are important for the calculation of the yield analysis in the field. Simulations of the recovery factor with the optical ray tracing program DIADALOS are performed in order to support the interpretation of the results. For measuring the absolute light recovery probability of a backsheet one should use a reference backsheet with an absorbance of close to 100% to avoid systematic reflection errors especially for high incident light beam angles > 50°. The ranking of various recovery factors are compared to the ranking measured by reflectance measurements defined in standard IEC 62788-2 Ed.1 for backsheets. The standard shows a substantial deviation between the ranking of recovery factor and the reflectance which can be corrected by using an adapted definition for the reflectance measurement method.

Abstract: The direction of Se-Mo-Se sheets to the Mo film is crucial for the thickness of Mo(S,Se)2 and the electrical conductivity, so as the back contact of Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 solar cells. In this study, the preferred orientation of Mo(S,Se)2 film changes from (100) peak to (103) peak, i.e. from perpendicular to the substrate to tilted to the substrate for Se-Mo-Se sheets as the roughness decrease of Mo back contact layer. The Se vapor can easily diffuse through the channels between Se-Mo-Se sheets when the formed Mo(S,Se)2 layer is (100) peak preferred with Se-Mo-Se sheets perpendicular to the substrate, and thus excessively thick Mo(S,Se)2 will be formed. Whereas, the Se-Mo-Se sheets are tilted to substrate when the preferred orientation of Mo(S,Se)2 is (103) peak. The tilted Se-Mo-Se sheets can act as a natural Se diffusion barrier to suppress the Se vapor diffusion through the already formed Mo(S,Se)2 layer to further selenize the remaining Mo film, and also can provide a good electrical conductivity. As a result, the thickness of Mo(S,Se)2 sharply decreased from 1500nm to 200nm with the surface morphology change of Mo back contact, which resulting in the decrease of series resistance of Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 solar cells from 2.94Ωcm2 to 0.49Ωcm2, and the increase of conversion efficiency of Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 solar cells from 6.98% to 9.04%.

Abstract: An effective method of using polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) planar slabs as seed materials for industrial low-cost and high-quality seed-assisted multicrystalline silicon has been presented. The interspace volume of the poly-Si slab seed layer is much lower compared to poly-Si nugget seed layer, so the initial grains of the slab-assisted ingot are much more uniform than those of the nugget-assisted ingot. Photoluminescence (PL) and minority lifetime measurements showed a considerable reduction in dislocation cluster density in the slab-assisted ingot, especially at the middle and top regions. The average cell efficiency based on the slab-assisted ingot is enhanced by 0.12% in absolute value compared to the nugget-assisted ingot. Moreover, the bottom edge of slab-assisted ingot can be fully recycled through existing cleaning process without remaining SiC particles, which saves considerable materials and slicing costs in mass manufacturing compared to nugget-assisted growth method.

Abstract: Organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskites materials have inspired enormous interest in the photovoltaic research community; however, they are currently plagued by insufficient environmental stability. To overcome this problem, all-inorganic halide perovskites have been developed and exhibit significantly improved stability. Here, vacuum thermal evaporation deposition of CsPbBr3 perovskite films is developed by dual-source coevaporation of CsBr and PbBr2 precursors. The evaporation rate ratio of CsBr to PbBr2 determines the stoichiometry of the deposited CsPbBr3 films, and the substrate temperature and post annealing temperature affect the crystallinity of the CsPbBr3 films. Through systematic optimization of the deposition parameters, high-quality CsPbBr3 films with good crystallinity and uniformity are obtained. Planar CsPbBr3 perovskite solar cells with high efficiency of 6.95% in small size (0.09 cm2) and 5.37% in large size (1 cm2) are fabricated. Moreover, the CsPbBr3 solar cells show good long-term stability under ambient conditions without encapsulation.

Abstract: We investigate the possibility to combine Zn(O,S) buffer layers grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD) with KF post-deposition treated Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS-KF) in solar cells. It is shown that the beneficial effect on open-circuit voltage from the post-deposition treatment is essentially independent of buffer layer material. However, a wet-chemical surface treatment is required prior to ALD in order to achieve competitive fill factor values. A water rinse is sufficient to create an absorber surface similar to the one formed during a conventional CdS chemical bath deposition process. However, it is observed that CIGS-KF/Zn(O,S) devices made with water-rinsed absorbers systematically result in lower fill factor values than for the corresponding CIGS-KF/CdS references. This effect can be mitigated by decreasing the H2S:H2O precursor ratio during ALD initiation, indicating that the fill factor limitation is linked to the initial Zn(O,S) growth on the modified CIGS-KF surface. The best CIGS-KF/Zn(O,S) devices were fabricated by etching away the KF-modified surface layer prior to ALD, followed by a low-temperature anneal. The thermal treatment step is needed to increase the open-circuit voltage close to the value of the CdS devices. The results presented in this contribution indicate that the main beneficial effects from KF-PDT in our devices are neither associated with the CdS CBD process nor due to the formation of a K-In-Se rich phase on the CIGS surface.

Abstract: In this study we investigate the light and heat-induced degradation of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite films in an inert atmosphere to exclude the effect of oxygen and humidity. Films aged under solar intensities started to degrade above 75°C, while films in the dark degraded at 95°C. To investigate the temperature-induced degradation mechanism, spectroscopic techniques such as Ultraviolet-Visible (UV–Vis) absorption spectroscopy, X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS), and Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) were used. Results show that the films aged under light at 75°C degraded to a mixture of PbI2 and metallic Pb. In contrast, films aged thermally in the dark, or with light and oxygen, degraded to PbI2 only. MAPbI3 solar cells were aged to show the effect of the metallic lead on the charge transfer mechanism.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of two-pore channels mediated receptor-operated Ca2+ entry on pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell (PASMC) under hypoxia conditions. PASMCs were separated using the direct adherent culture method. The cultured cells were observed under optic microscope and the phenotypes of cells were identified by immunohistochemistry. The expression of NAADP was examined by ELISA. CaN, TPC1, TPC2 and NFATc3 protein levels were examined using Western blotting. Real-time PCR was utilized to detect the level of TPC1 and TPC2 mRNA. Fluorescent probe technique was used to explore the [Ca2+]i in PASMCs. Proliferation and migration of PASMCs were examined by MTT assay and Transwell, respectively. The results showed that cells displayed a typical “peak-valley” growth pattern and positive for α-actin staining. Expression of NAADP, CaN, NFATc3, TPC1 and TPC2 under PASMCs exposed to hypoxia after 24 h and 48 h were higher than control, however, cells treated with Ned-19 were significantly decreased compared with control. Levels of CaN and NFATc3 protein collected from RPASMCs transfected with TPCs siRNA were observably decreased than scrambled siRNA. Under hypoxia condition for 12 h, 24 h and 48 h, TPC1 and TPC2 mRNA levels were higher in PASMCs compared as control. The [Ca2+]i evoked by hypoxia significantly increased than normoxia group. Nevertheless, the [Ca2+]i of the groups treated with Ned-19 and transfected with TPCs siRNA were markedly lower compared with control. In conclusion, the TPCs influence on function of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells by mediated Ca2+ Signals under hypoxia condition.

Abstract: On antigen encounter, naïve CD8+ and CD4+ T cells differentiate into a large number of effector cells that migrate to inflamed tissues to fight infections or tumors. Following elimination of the target, a few cells remain in the long-term, the so-called memory T cells that are capable to reexpand and respond more vigorously on a second encounter with the cognate antigen. While the naïve T cell compartment is fairly homogenous, effector and memory T cells are largely diverse, comprising dozens of subsets with diverse functions, molecular characteristics, and localization in the body. In addition, CD4+ and, to some extent, also CD8+ T cells can differentiate into several effector subsets according to their pattern of cytokine expression, including the T helper 1 (Th1), Th2, and Th17 cells. It has become clear that specific subsets of T cells dominate different types of infections and pathological conditions and have different capacities to infiltrate and reject tumors. Their correct phenotypic identification is therefore of foremost importance for their live purification by magnetic or fluorescence-activated cell sorting and subsequent molecular characterization. Here, we present a comprehensive list of the main T cell subpopulations with a major focus on human cells along with their surface phenotypic properties.

Abstract: Semitransparent (ST) Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGSe) solar cells based on the ultrathin absorbers with a bandgap of ~1.5eV are prepared on the tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) back electrode. In a solar cell with absorber thickness ≤300nm, incorporation of a sulfurized-AgGa (AGS) layer between the CIGSe layer and the ITO back contact was found to improve the device efficiency. This article explores the effect of the AGS layer on the CIGSe structure and CIGSe/ITO interface. Meanwhile, an ordered defect compound formation is observed in the AGS interlayered-CIGSe absorbers, the origin of which is the decrease in the (Ag+Cu)/(Ga+In) ratio arising from diffusion of In from the ITO to the absorber and the Ag/Ga ratio of 0.60 in the AGS layer. It is found that the AGS layer can significantly reduce the formation of the GaOx phase at the CIGSe/ITO interface. However, the increase in the deposition time of the CIGSe layer in the AGS interlayered-absorbers resulted in an increase in the GaOx interfacial (IF) layer thickness. The roll-over phenomenon in the illuminated J-V curves of devices based on AGS interlayered-absorbers became increasingly pronounced when the thickness of GaOx IF layer increased. The SCAPS (solar cell capacitance simulator) simulation results indicate that the reason for the roll-over effect in the illuminated J-V curves of the solar cells with AGS layers is the GaOx IF phase (n-type in nature). In light of the present results, possibilities to further enhance the conversion efficiency of ST CIGSe solar cells are also discussed.

Abstract: Gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) is the most common malignancy of the biliary tract with extremely poor prognosis. The malignant transformation of GBC is associated with cell proliferation, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying GBC progression are poorly understood. We found that serine threonine tyrosine kinase 1 (STYK1) was elevated in GBC and was negatively correlated with clinical outcomes and prognosis. Overexpression of STYK1 in GBC cell lines gave rise to increased cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion, thus committing cells to undergoing EMT. In contrast, silence of STYK1 led to opposite effects on cell transformation. Consistent with STYK1 gene knockdown, AKT specific inhibitor MK2206 abrogated tumor promoting action induced by STYK1, suggesting that PI3K/AKT pathway is essential for the oncogenic role of STYK1 in GBC. STYK1 shRNA in GBC cells inhibited development of xenografted tumors compared with control cells. Collectively, our findings suggest that STYK1 is a critical regulator of tumor growth and metastasis, and may serve as a potential target for GBC therapy.

Abstract: Obesity is a chronic inflammatory state with cytokines, adipokines, and miRNAs. The A2a-adenosine system decreases activation and cytokine release in immune cells. MiR-221 is upregulated in carcinogenesis and inflammatory processes, where its targets PTEN and ETS-1, negatively regulates the Akt pathway and induces the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, respectively. However, the roles of the A2a-adenosine system and miR-221 in adipose tissue are unknown. The aim of this work was to evaluate the A2a-adenosine and miRNA pathways as immune modulators in adipose tissue. We collected aspirate of adipose tissue from patients with BMI < 25 kg/m2 (BMI < 25) and BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 (BMI ≥ 25) who underwent liposuction; the adipose tissue was digested with collagenase, and then a Ficoll gradient was performed to obtain mononuclear cells from adipose tissue (MCAT). We evaluated the A2a levels by quantitative Retro-transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) and flow cytometry and the A2a-adenosine function with a proliferation assay or cytokine levels in the presence or absence of NAD+, activators, and inhibitors of the system. We also analyzed miR-221, ETS-1 and PTEN levels by qRT-PCR. First, we detected that MCAT presented higher basal proliferation than mononuclear cells from peripheral blood; however, activation of the A2a receptor downregulated cell proliferation and cytokine release. Interestingly, while miR-221 was downregulated in MCAT from subjects with BMI ≥ 25 compared to BMI < 25, their targets ETS-1 and PTEN, were increased. In conclusion, the A2a-adenosine system is decreased in MCAT, but it maintains its function; moreover, miR-221 could participate in promoting inflammation in adipose tissue.

Abstract: Vanadium dioxide (VO2) thin films are key materials for thermochromic smart windows and commonly have a typical phase transition (insulator to metal phase) at a transition temperature of 68°C. This research, however, found that highly crystallized VO2 nanoparticles can be successfully coated on a glass substrate with added functionalities, such as higher luminous transmittance and transition efficiency. The transition temperature revealed that the VO2 nanoparticles with post thermal treatment at 600°C also clearly exhibited a reduced transition temperature of 69°C in the heating curve, 59°C in the cooling curve, and a transition width of 10°C. By nanopatterning the thin films, we were able to prepare VO2 thin films with higher luminous transmittance than that attained with non-patterned VO2 thin films. The enhanced transition property was demonstrated using highly crystallized VO2 nanoparticles induced by post thermal treatment, and the luminous transmittance was improved by the nanopatterns on the surface of the VO2 thin films.

Abstract: Although barium titanate (BaTiO3, BT) has been extensively used in manufacturing electronic materials, less attention has been paid to the area of cool material. Herein, BT was first used as solar heat-reflective pigment, aiming to be possibly applied in cool roof for cooling purpose. Specifically, four types of BT with different particle size were added into acrylonitrile-styrene-acrylate copolymer (ASA) matrix to fabricate composite cool materials. The solar reflectance and cooling effect were investigated by ultraviolet-visible-near infrared (UV–Vis–NIR) spectral measurement and temperature test, respectively. The results of the solar spectral measurement suggested that the addition of BT particles significantly improved NIR reflectance of ASA by 2–3 times. Besides, the total solar reflectance firstly increased with the increasing average particle size up to 406 nm and then leveled off. Meanwhile, a significant decrease (about 10 °C) was achieved in the indoor temperature test when BT particles were introduced. As for the outdoor temperature test, the final temperature of ASA/BT (406 nm) and ASA/BT (1068 nm) was different though their solar reflectance values were close, indicating that the temperature test was a great complementary instrument of the solar spectral measurement.

Abstract: A low-cost antireflection (AR) coating of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) with wrinkle surface structure is demonstrated. The surface modulations with controllable amplitude and period are experimentally performed by plasma surface oxidation of a pre-stretched PDMS followed by removal of the applied mechanical strain. The period and the aspect ratio of the PDMS wrinkle are dependent on plasma treatment time in the process of surface modification. Compared with the solar cell without a wrinkle coating, the demonstrated PDMS wrinkle coating can improve the efficiency of actual commercial silicon-wafer solar cells, especially at large angles of incidence. Intriguingly, the all-day average relative efficiency of the cell with PDMS wrinkle is improved by approximately 13.6%.

Abstract: The solar manufacturing industry continues to expand and become a key source of energy as manufacturing costs have decreased. This has led to a rapid growth in revenue and a corresponding drop in margins that has suppliers implementing solutions to further reduce the costs associated with manufacturing solar panels. Despite these improvements, solar energy derived from photovoltaics still has an energy pay-back time of at least one year with some of this is associated with heating processes. To further reduce costs, a new technology called intense pulsed light is being implemented to eliminate expensive high energy thermal processes and encourage higher throughput. The technology also includes opportunities for devices that contain thermally limited materials. The technique was originally explored when the photovoltaic industry was quite small, and has only recently begun to gather interest as the printed electronics industry realized gains. This review discusses the use of intense pulsed light in photovoltaic manufacturing, detailing the process from a photonic physics perspective, the relevant heat transfer mechanisms, as well as its impact on the major photovoltaic sectors. Demonstrations of generation 1: crystalline silicon solar cells, generation 2: thin film solar cells, and emerging technologies: hybrid organic solar cell applications are discussed. Lastly, future outlooks for intense pulsed light in the photovoltaic manufacturing sector are offered.

Abstract: A method for generating a solar reflective blue-grey paint coating with yellow-green luminescence that is cost-effective, industrially scalable, widely applicable, easily repairable, super-non-wetting, self-cleaning, and solar reflective, is introduced. The coating can be manufactured using as-received commercially available materials and following a simple industrial procedure. Grinding the coating surfaces using emery papers with appropriate grit numbers can readily yield appropriate surface roughness, generate suitable micro-grooves and expose micro- and nano-particles on the coating surfaces, thus endowing the coating surfaces with super-non-wettability and self-cleaning property. The surface free energy of the coating only depends on the dispersive component and both the Lewis acid component and the Lewis base component are 0mN/m. The solar reflective blue-grey coating with solar reflectance of 0.808 can yield a cooling effect of 22.6°C relative to a flat or low-sloped concrete roof on a typical clear summer sunny day. It emits yellow-green luminescence during the night, thus decorating the buildings to some extent when applied to the external walls of buildings. Although the super-non-wettability of the coating surfaces might be destroyed mainly by the periodic spraying of water (simulated by 400h of artificial accelerated weathering tests), the super-non-wettability and the self-cleaning property can be completely re-established after roughening the weathered coating surfaces using emery papers with appropriate grit numbers. In terms of optical properties, the solar reflective blue-grey coating with yellow-green luminescence has good resistance to artificial accelerated weathering.

Abstract: Transparent insulation materials (TIMs) hold an extraordinary potential in solar thermal energy collection, and are gradually and widely applied in the energy-saving buildings. However, due to the limitation of available materials, conventional TIMs are rigid, heavy and uneasy for installation. In this paper, a novel TIM product made of spacer fabric composites was designed and investigated experimentally. Compared with traditional TIMs, the proposed spacer fabric composites are featured with flexibility, low weight and high applicability. Four different types of spacer fabrics composites were developed to analyze the solar energy conversion efficiency using textile material. Their chemical composition, conductivity and water repellency properties were systemically evaluated using UV–VIS–NIR, thermal detector and contact angle measurements. The spacer fabric composites of spacer filament in ‘X’ type was demonstrated to have a stronger solar thermal collection capacity than that of ‘V’ type. Also, the poly-p-xylene coating contributed to a higher thermal insulation and stronger water repellency property. To be specific, the stable collection temperature of the optimal composites can reach to 98°C from the ambient temperature of 32°C at a radiation of 1100W/m2. In conclusion, the spacer fabric composites demonstrated to have large potential and extremely broad application prospect in the field of transparent insulation materials.

Abstract: Overcoming the open circuit voltage deficiency in Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) photovoltaics may be achieved by increasing p-type doping while maintaining or increasing minority carrier lifetimes. Here, routes to higher doping efficiency using arsenic are explored through an atomic scale understanding of dopant incorporation limits and activation in molecular beam epitaxy grown CdTe layers. Atom probe tomography reveals spatial segregation into nanometer scale clusters containing > 60 at% As for samples with arsenic incorporation levels greater than 7–8 × 1017 cm−3. The presence of arsenic clusters was accompanied by crystal quality degradation, particularly the introduction of arsenic-enriched extended defects. Post-growth annealing treatments are shown to increase the size of the As precipitates and the amount of As within the precipitates.

Abstract: Although nocturnal radiative cooling has been known for centuries, providing sub-ambient radiative cooling during daytime was a challenge until recent years. Recent advances in nano-fabrication technologies, have made it possible to manufacture structures with tailored radiative properties for various energy applications like daytime clear sky radiative cooling. It has been shown that photonic and plasmonic selective emitters can be tuned efficiently to emit heat through clear sky to the outer space and cool terrestrial objects providing passive cooling. There is a renewed interest in clear sky radiative cooling among researchers. Providing continuous day and night sub-ambient cooling and dissipation of low grade heat from renewable power systems without use of water or external energy under direct sunlight and other applications have made clear sky radiative cooling a hot research topic. This paper reviews relevant publications on clear-sky radiative cooling methods. An overview of radiative cooling fundamentals and a detailed literature survey of published studies on selective emitter structures for daytime and nighttime cooling purposes is presented. Furthermore, a detailed energy analysis is performed identifying key performance indicators and evaluating the cooling performance under various conditions. Findings from studies that have used empirical equations for numerical energy analysis and selective emitter structure designs for daytime and nighttime applications are summarized in tables for easy comparison.

Abstract: To modify the stoichiometry and enhance electronic transportation of electron transport layers (ETLs) potentially for the large-scale high performance planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs) on the flexible substrate, ZnO films as ETLs with controlled stoichiometry are fabricated by magnetron sputtering method under a mixture working gases of Ar and O2 at room temperature. The impact of Ar/O2 ratios on the structural, electrical, and optical properties of ZnO films is systematically investigated. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results indicate that the sputtered ZnO films with controlled stoichiometry are successfully achieved. For the proper deposition condition with Ar/O2 ratio of 1:4, ZnO film exhibits large-size grains, low defect states density, and good optical crystalline quality. Furthermore, the sputtered ZnO films deposited under various Ar/O2 ratios are introduced into the PSCs as ETLs. The photovoltaic performance of the PSCs is strongly dependent on the properties of the sputtered ZnO ETLs. Compared with the ZnO ETLs prepared under various Ar/O2 ratios, the PSCs based on the ZnO ETL deposited under the Ar/O2 ratio of 1:4 demonstrate the improved short-circuit current and fill factor, contributing to a maximum power conversion efficiency of 16.60%. This study highlights that the sputtered ZnO film is one of promising ETLs for high-efficiency PSCs under low-temperature processing.

Abstract: Efficiently transforming solar energy into heat requires an understanding of spectrally selective coatings at the atomic, molecular, corrosive and spectrally selective levels. Here, experiments were conducted and analyzed to rationalize and ultimately understand the complex behaviours of spectrally selective coatings in corrosion environments. By exploring reactions that modify graphene nanoplatelets, the preparation of stable dispersions, the incorporation in sol-gel binder, and the preparation of spectrally selective coatings, we demonstrated that (i) a successful graphene nanoplatelet modification is important for their incorporation into binders as sol-gels, (ii) the modified products do not influence the optical properties of the coatings, (iii) incorporating nanoplatelets drastically improves corrosion resistance, and (iv) thinner coatings can be used to acheieve the same anticorrosion properties as other treatments. We believe this experimental insight provides a pathway for the rational design of stable spectrally selective paint coatings that are urgently needed for the development of a new generation of reliable and affordable absorber coatings for efficient solar energy harvesting.

Abstract: A physical stimuli, it has been reported that cyclic tensile strain can promote bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) to differentiate into cardiomyocytes, but the underlying mechanisms have been poorly elucidated so far. Here, we used a mimicking loading strain, cyclic biaxial tensile strain (CBTS), and found it can promote BMSCs to differentiate into cardiomyocytes. When the CBTS were loaded, the cells expressed cardiac-specific markers GATA4, TNNT2, MEF-2c, and Cx43, meanwhile we found miR-27a decreased and stem cell factor (SCF) increased. When we overexpressed miR-27a, the cardiac-specific markers were down-regulated; we got the same results when SCF was knocked down by siRNA. Interestingly, we found SCF is a potential target of miR-27a by a bioinformatic analysis. So, we overexpressed miR-27a, and found SCF decreased both in mRNA and protein level. And, When miR-27a was co-transfected with SCF-3′UTR, it significantly reduced the luciferase activity, but not when co-transfected with SCF-3′UTR mutation plasmid. Furthermore, after transfected both miR-27a and SCF siRNA, and the protein expression of the markers were more down-regulated than that of single of them. Taken together, we found CBTS can promote BMSCs to differentiate into cardiomyocytes, and miR-27a functions as a mechano-sensitive miRNA in this process by targeting SCF.

Abstract: The presented work demonstrates the development of highly stable low temperature processed Cesium compound incorporated ZnO electron transport layer (ETL) for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Cesium compounds such as CA (cesium acetate) and CC (cesium carbonate) modified ETLs are employed for fabricating highly efficient (PCE: ~ 16.5%) mixed organic cation based MA0.6FA0.4PbI3 PSCs via restricted volume solvent annealing (RVSA) method. Here, CA ETL demonstrates a 50meV upshift in Fermi level position with respect to CC ETL, contributing to higher n-type conductivity and lower electron injection barrier at the interface. Furthermore, CA ETL also exhibits profound influence on the perovskite microstructure leading to larger grain size and uniform distribution. Cesium acetate incorporated devices exhibit about 82% higher PCE compared to conventional CC devices. In addition to higher photovoltaic performance, CA devices exhibit mitigated photo-current hysteresis phenomena compared to CC devices, owing to suppressed electrode polarization phenomena. Besides, the stability of the CA devices are 400% higher than the conventional CC devices, retaining almost 90% of its initial PCE even after a month-long (30 days) systematic degradation study. The mechanism behind superior performance and stability is investigated and discussed comprehensively.

Abstract: The eutectic Na2SO4-NaCl salt was investigated as a novel high temperature phase change material for solar thermal energy storage due to its low cost and melting point (626.0°C) interested. The measured melting point and heat of fusion of the eutectic salt are 625.3°C and 263.3J/g, which are in agreement with their theoretical values. The eutectic salt shows good thermal stability after 100 melting-freezing thermal cycles in the range of 550–680°C in air. Three types of the eutectic Na2SO4-NaCl-ceramic composites have been designed and evaluated to address the salt’ corrosion issues with containment materials. Results show that eutectic Na2SO4-NaCl/both α-alumina and mullite composites with a mass ratio of salt to ceramics of 1:1 (wt%) have good thermal stability without cracking as well as with weight losses of 0.50% and 0.74% and the decrease of latent heat by 1% and 2% respectively after 20 thermal cycles, where no phase separation and chemical reaction occur. Their measured melting temperature and latent heat are consistent with their theoretical values. Addition of α-alumina and mullite to the eutectic Na2SO4-NaCl salt can reduce the eutectic Na2SO4-NaCl salt’ supercooling. In contrast, the sample of the Na2SO4-NaCl/diatomite composite cracked after the cycles.

Abstract: An image-processing method combined with Fourier analysis is introduced in this work as a rapid and highly-automated method of detecting rear contact voids in passivated emitter and rear contact cells (PERC). This approach utilizes photoluminescence (PL) imaging to locate the central point of the most detrimental type of voids and associate a void fraction to each cell in a manner of seconds. Acoustic microscopy and scanning electron microscopy are also used as complementary tools to confirm the presence of voids detection using PL imaging and provide more insight into the actual physical mechanism of what is observed in PL measurements.

Abstract: Follistatin (FST) plays a protective role during silica nanoparticle (SiO2 NP) exposure. SiO2 NP treatment induces FST transcription with an unknown mechanism. We herein reported that SIRT6, one of the sirtuin family members, induced epigenetic silencing of FST. The expression of FST was elevated after SIRT6 knockdown while reduced after SIRT6 overexpression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed a direct interaction between SIRT6 with FST promoter. Knockdown of SIRT6 increased both Ac-H3K9 level and Ac-H3K56 level at FST promoter region. SiO2 NP treatment de-stabilized SIRT6 mRNA and reduced SIRT6 expression, leading to the activation of FST transcription. Finally, over-expression of SIRT6 increased SiO2 NP-induced apoptosis. Collectively, this study provided evidence that SIRT6 is a negative regulator of FST transcription and participates in the regulation of cell survival during silica nanoparticle exposure.

Abstract: Objectives
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) continues to evolve with the treatment in higher risk patient population. This practice mandates stringent update and validation of risk stratification prior to undergoing such a complex and potentially fatal procedure. We examined the adoption of the new comorbidity index (HCT-CI/Age) proposed by the Seattle group after the addition of age variable and compared it to the pre-transplant assessment of mortality (PAM) that already incorporates age as part of its evaluation criteria.

A retrospective analysis of adult patients who underwent HCT at our institution from January 2010 through August 2014 was performed. Kaplan-Meier’s curve, log-rank tests, Cox model and Pearson correlation was used in the analysis.
Results
Of the 114 patients that underwent allogeneic transplant in our institution, 75.4% were ≥40 years old. More than 58% had a DLCO ≤80%. Although scores were positively correlated (correlation coefficient 0.43, p < 0.001), HCT-CI/Age more accurately predicted 2-year overall survival (OS) and non-relapse mortality (NRM) in patients with lower (0–4) and higher (5–7) scores (52% and 36% versus 24% and 76%, p = 0.004, 0.003 respectively). PAM score did not reach statistical significance for difference in OS nor NRM between the low (<24) and high-risk (≥24) groups (p = 0.19 for both).
Conclusions
Despite our small sample population, HCT-CI/Age was more discriminative to identify patients with poor outcome that might benefit from intensified management strategies or other therapeutic approaches rather than allogeneic HCT.

Abstract: Energetic metabolism supports rapid cell growth and proliferation, differentiation, polarization, and effector functions of T cells. T lymphocytes have the remarkable plasticity that allows them to shape their metabolism to adapt to extracellular and intracellular cues, a process that involves molecular modules referred to as “metabolic checkpoints” that sense metabolic signals and transduce effector messages. These metabolic checkpoints may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for immune modulation. Chemical immunosuppressive drugs including mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (sirolimus and everolimus), calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus and cyclosporine), and purine and pyrimidine synthesis inhibitors (6-mercaptopurine, mycophenolic acid, and methotrexate) are widely prescribed for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and for controlling alloimmunity in interfering with the signals that activate and allow T cells to proliferate. Emerging evidence indicates that these drugs also target T-cell metabolism and metabolic checkpoints, which, as a consequence, could contribute to their immunosuppressive effects. These examples raise the issue of how the modulation of these metabolic checkpoints can regulate T-cell activation, differentiation, and function. In this review we highlight emerging concepts about the modulation of metabolic reprogramming in T-cell responses by immunosuppressive drugs and how potential therapeutic interventions influence T-cell fate and effector function.

Abstract: Externally induced strain effect was investigated in GaAs thin-film solar cells by electroluminescence (EL) imaging method. The strained regions demonstrated not only enhancement of local EL intensity but also redshift of the EL emission peaks. The observations were explained well by a gradient quantum-well (GQW) model correlated with tensile strain in the GaAs thin films. External biaxial strain was considered in this model which was accordingly obtained from the energy shift of the EL spectra. Finally, the spatially resolved strain in GaAs thin-film solar cells was obtained from the EL images by relating the EL emission intensity to the shift of the EL spectra. This work provides a potential standard method for diagnosis of externally induced strain in thin-film solar cells by EL measurements.

Abstract: Infrared photodetector is an important technology for both civilian and military applications. However, conventional commercial detectors generally require complex designs, expensive devices and cumbersome procedures. In this work, monoclinic phase VO2 (M1) nanorods (NRs) with metal-insulator transition properties were synthesized through a low-temperature hydrothermal reaction and subsequent annealing. The evolution of vibrational modes of VO2 (M1) NRs have been observed using Raman and IR spectroscopies during the structural phase transition. In addition, a high-sensitivity infrared photodetector based on a network of the VO2 (M1) NRs was fabricated with a low-cost method, and the electron transfer processes in nanorod (NR) networks has been discussed. The device exhibited high photosensitivity, excellent stability, and reproducibility in atmospheric condition at room temperature.

Abstract: Resistin is an adipocyte-derived cytokine and was named for its role in the development of insulin resistance. Increased serum resistin levels are also associated with steatohepatitis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. In a previous study, resistin was observed to reduce mitochondrial content and upregulate miR-34a significantly in the liver. In this study, male C57BL/6 mice were injected with agomir-34a or control agomir, and HepG2 cells were transfected with miR-34a mimics or inhibitors to assess their role in resistin-induced fat deposition. The overexpression of miR-34a increased liver and HepG2 cell TAG content, decreased mitochondrial content, changed mitochondrial morphology and impaired mitochondrial function. In contrast, a miR-34a inhibitor significantly restored the TAG content and mitochondrial transmembrane potential. A study of transcriptional regulation revealed that C/EBPβ is essential for upregulating miR-34a by resistin. Furthermore, miR-34a inhibited the PPARα signaling pathway by binding to sites in the 3′UTR of AdipoR2 genes and the AMPK pathway. Consequently, this increased the fat content and decreased the mitochondrial content in HepG2 cells. This paper reveals a novel mechanism for mitochondrial regulation, which suggests that normal mitochondrial content and function is crucial for lipid metabolism in the liver.

Abstract: In this work we present a simulation of performance of curved thin-film modules for building and product integrated photovoltaic applications. Flexibility of design and possibility of achieving irregular shapes is important feature in these markets. The photovoltaic module model presented in this work is based on a coupled two-step model. The first 1D model describes the technology and outputs device current density in dependence of voltage, temperature, illumination, etc. The second 3D model uses this data as one of its inputs, and describes size, shape and interconnection of the individual cells within the curved flexible module. In this way power production of such photovoltaic system can be assessed in reasonable time and computing resources. Two study cases are presented: a dome shaped solar street lamp and a conic shaped active rooftop shading for a skylight.

Abstract: Microencapsulated composite material using Na2SO4 as core and SiO2 as shell for high temperature thermal energy storage is prepared. The effects of silica mass percentages within the Na2SO4@SiO2 PCM composites on thermal conductivity, thermal stability, melting temperature, and latent heat are investigated. No new phases are formed during the encapsulation process. The spherical silica nanoparticles with diameters at around 300 nm are well decorated on the surface of Na2SO4. The PCM composite with 5.4% silica addition is determined as the optimal sample due to its excellent comprehensive properties. The inhibition of liquid leakage during melting can be effectively realized. The thermal conductivity of Na2SO4@SiO2 PCM under high temperatures (600–800 °C) can be increased to 0.59 W/(m K), 0.62 W/(m K), and 0.87 W/(m K), respectively. The initial and peak melting temperatures of the Na2SO4@SiO2 are tested at 885.20 °C and 887.91 °C, respectively. The latent heat is determined as high as 170.6 J/(g K), and the total heat storage density including latent and sensible heat with a temperature span of 100 °C is 390.6 J/g, and the mass loss is observed < 1% under 1000 °C. In addition, the latent heat loss percentage after 50 thermal cycle tests is ≤ 4.3%.

Abstract: The light management strategy was applied in III-V solar cells for the maximum utilization of incident photon, namely the selective rear contact was adopted in Ga0.5In0.5P- and GaAs- based solar cells. By etching the rear contact layer (p-GaAs) with photolithography, the distinctive morphological structures consisting of polka-dot patterns were formed, which led to increased reflection and thereby the device performance. Furthermore, the photolithography was controlled to find the optimum contact ratio between the back-surface field and the rear contact. Consequently, the conversion efficiency was increased from η = 15.5% to 16.3% for the Ga0.5In0.5P-based single-junction solar cell, and from η = 21.1% to 21.9% for the GaAs-based one, both at the contact ratio of 10%, compared to the cells with full (100%) rear contact ratio. Finally, the selective rear contact was applied to double-junction solar cells (Ga0.5In0.5P- and GaAs- based), exhibiting that this straightforward rear-contact strategy has enabled reaching the efficiency of η = 30.6% with an anti-reflective coating.

Abstract: Mitochondrial functionality is one of the main factors involved in cell survival, and mitochondrial dysfunctions have been identified as an aging hallmark. In particular, the insurgence of mitochondrial dysfunctions is tightly connected to mitochondrial metabolism. During aging, both mitochondrial oxidative and biosynthetic metabolisms are progressively altered, with the development of malfunctions, in turn affecting mitochondrial functionality. In this context, the relation between mitochondrial pathways and aging is evolutionarily conserved from single-celled organisms, such as yeasts, to complex multicellular organisms, such as humans. Useful information has been provided by the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is being increasingly acknowledged as a valuable model system to uncover mechanisms underlying cellular longevity in humans. On this basis, we review the impact of specific aspects of mitochondrial metabolism on aging supported by the contributions brought by numerous studies performed employing yeast. Initially, we will focus on the tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, describing how their modulation has consequences on cellular longevity. Afterward, we will report information regarding the importance of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) metabolism during aging, highlighting its relation with mitochondrial functionality. The comprehension of these key points regarding mitochondrial metabolism and their physiological importance is an essential first step for the development of therapeutic interventions that point to increase life quality during aging, therefore promoting “healthy aging,” as well as lifespan itself.

Abstract: Thermochemical storage is based on a reversible chemical reaction; energy can be stored when an endothermic chemical reaction occurs and then, energy is released when it is reversed in an exothermic reaction. According to literature and based on the energy storage density (esd), MgCl2·6H2O is a promising candidate material for thermochemical energy storage. Bischofite is an inorganic salt obtained as a by-product material from extraction processes of non-metallic minerals, from Salar de Atacama in Chile, containing approximately 95% of MgCl2·6H2O. Thus, the purpose of this study was to characterize the dehydration reaction of bischofite ore, studied as a low-cost thermochemical storage material. Thermogravimetric data for bischofite were obtained using a TGA instrument coupled to a DSC, at four different isotherms 70°C, 80°C, 90°C and 100°C. The results of conversion reaction (α-t) from the thermal dehydration experiments, demonstrated the first phase of dehydration with the loss of two water molecules. The study showed a typical sigmoid curve with a significant acceleration in the conversion at the beginning of the reaction until it reaches a maximum rate, where the curve keeps constant. The same behavior was observed for all the temperatures used. The kinetics of bischofite dehydration model was determined using the isothermal kinetics method. For this, the thermogravimetric data were fitted to the most used kinetic models (D, F, R, A) and then their respective correlation coefficients R were evaluated. The results indicated that the dehydration reaction of bischofite was described by the kinetics of chemical reaction of cylindrical particles R2. The rate of dehydration reaction and esd of bischofite are lower as compared to synthetic MgCl2·6H2O, at temperatures higher than 80°C. However, the cost of materials to store 1MJ of energy is three times lower for bischofite, which is an evident advantage to promote the reuse of this material left as waste by the non-metallic industry.

Abstract: The seed assisted growth technology has been used to fabricate the high performance multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) for photovoltaic application nowadays, which can effectively control the dislocation density by forming uniform and small grains. In this work, we have systematically investigated the effect and mechanism of silicon wafer flakes as the seeds for mc-Si growth. Silicon flakes were put on the crucible bottom as nucleation agents by two different settings, i.e., orderly stacking without interspace and intentionally piling up with interspace. It was found that the numerous small and uniform grains with diameter of ~ 0.5mm were homogenously formed in the intentionally piled up wafer flake seed layer since the liquid silicon drops flew down and solidified in the interspaces during the melting of polysilicon feedstocks. These small self-formed grains served as new seeds, which were better than orderly stacked wafer flakes as seeds. Minority carrier lifetime and photoluminescence mappings have shown that the initial dislocation density of grains with smaller sizes based on the piled silicon flake seeds was much lower than those without seeds or stacked silicon flake seeds, and meanwhile the dislocation propagation was suppressed by means of smaller grain sizes due to the denser grain boundaries. As a result, the corresponding average conversion efficiency of Al-BSF processed solar cells from the mc-Si assisted by piled silicon flakes as seeds was absolutely 0.29% higher than those without seeds and 0.17% higher to those assisted by stacked silicon flakes.

Abstract: Aluminium titanium oxynitrides were studied as candidate materials for high temperature absorbers in solar selective coatings due to their excellent stability and their tuneable optical behaviour. A set of individual AlyTi1−y(OxN1−x) layers with different oxygen content was prepared by cathodic vacuum arc (CVA) deposition. The composition, morphology, phase structure and microstructure of the films were characterized by elastic recoil detection (ERD), scanning and transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. An fcc phase structure is found in a broad compositional range of AlyTi1−y(OxN1−x). Simultaneously, sample microstructure and morphology undergo systematic changes from a columnar growth to the development of a heterogeneous structure with spherical nanoparticle inclusions when the oxygen concentration is increased. The optical properties were determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry and UV–Vis–NIR and FTIR spectrophotometry. A comprehensive analysis of the film properties allowed an accurate modelling of the optical constants of the AlyTi1−y(OxN1−x) in the whole wavelength range of solar interest (from 190nm to 25µm). It points to a transition from metallic to dielectric behaviour with increasing oxygen content. Consequently, it is demonstrated that the optical properties of these AlyTi1−y(OxN1−x) deposited films can be controlled in a wide range from metallic to dielectric character by adjusting the oxygen concentration, opening a huge range of possibilities for the design of solar selective coatings (SSC) based on this material. Complete SSC, including a TiN layer as IR reflector, were designed by applying optical simulations, obtaining excellent optical selective properties of α = 94.0% and εRT = 4.8%.

Abstract: Research efforts to overwhelmingly fortify the economics of photovoltaics have focused on increasing the light-to-electricity conversion efficiency and reducing the overall manufacturing costs. Since lowering the consumption of silicon has the potential to greatly curtail the material costs, studies on wafering thin silicon substrates have been performed. However, current methods to interconnect solar cells with metal ribbons are not sufficient to employ thin silicon wafers. Therefore, this study explores a novel route to interconnect solar cells with metal ribbons without thermomechanical stress using a highly conductive liquid metal. Galinstan, which is notoriously difficult to print, is successfully harnessed to be printable by suspending submillimetre-sized Galinstan droplets in the carrier vehicle, as aided by the yield stress. By mechanically sintering the Galinstan paste with gentle mechanical pressure, solar cells are interconnected with metal ribbons at room temperature. Albeit the averaged maximum power of the unit modules interconnected using the Galinstan paste was significantly degraded after just 100 thermal cycles due to the possible formation of resistive intermetallic compounds of Galinstan, the power degradation of the best unit module using the Galinstan paste is −0.9%, which is smaller than the averaged one of the unit modules using a conventional soldering method (-1.35%), implying the thermomechanical-stress-free interconnection method using a liquid metal has a chance to be improved for being a comparable competitor to the conventional soldering method.

Abstract: Understanding the basis of cellular differentiation is a fundamental issue in developmental biology but also for the comprehension of pathological processes. In fact, the palette of developmental decisions for naive CD4 T cells is a critical aspect of the development of appropriate immune responses which could control infectious processes or cancer growth. However, the current accumulation of data on CD4 T cells biology reveals a complex world with different helper populations. Naive CD4 T cells can differentiate into different subtypes in response to cytokine stimulation. This stimulation involves a complex transcriptional network implicating the activation of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription but also master regulator transcription factors allowing the functions of each helper T lymphocyte subtype. In this review, we will present an overview of the transcriptional regulation which controls process of helper T cells differentiation. We will focus on the role of initiator transcriptional factors and on master regulators but also on other nonspecific transcriptional factors which refine the T helper polarization to stabilize or modulate the differentiation program.

Abstract: Gallium accumulation, caused by faster reaction of indium with Se than gallium with Se, is a critical issue for post-selenization process, which limits the optimization of surface energy bandgap and open circuit voltage of CIGSe thin film solar cell. In this study, large-grained and compact CIGSe thin film was successful fabricated by electrodeposition and a three-step vapor Se/N2/vapor Se reaction process. The influence of the Cu content on gallium diffusion and grain growth of CIGSe thin film was studied. The compositions, element distributions, and morphologies of CIGSe thin films were studied. The results revealed that the gallium diffused homogenizely through the film with Cu/(In+Ga) < 0.9, while accumulated at the back contact region with Cu/(In+Ga) > 0.9. Single phase and large-grained CIGSe thin films were obtained with Cu/(In+Ga) ratios between 0.78 and 0.9. Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells made with the CIGSe thin films presented highest efficiency of 11.22%. The solar cell based on the single phase and large-grained CIGSe absorber with Cu/(In+Ga) = 0.85 presents highest conversion efficiency of 11.22%, fill factor of 63.83% and VOC of 514 mV.

Hexokinase 2 confers resistance to cisplatin in ovarian cancer cells by enhancing cisplatin-induced autophagy,

Abstract: The high mortality rate of ovarian cancer is connected with the development of acquired resistance to multiple cancer drugs, especially cisplatin. Activation of cytoprotective autophagy has been implicated as a contributing mechanism for acquired cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cells. Hexokinase 2 (HK2) phosphorylates glucose to generate glucose-6-phosphate, the rate-limiting step in glycolysis. Higher HK2 expression has been associated with chemoresistance in ovarian cancer. However, whether HK2 functionally contributes to cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer is unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of HK2 in regulating ovarian cancer cisplatin resistance. Increased HK2 levels were detected in drug-resistant human ovarian cancer cells and tissues. Cisplatin downregulated HK2 in cisplatin-sensitive but not in resistant ovarian cancer cells. HK2 knockdown sensitized resistant ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin-induced cell death and apoptosis. Conversely, HK2 overexpression in cisplatin-sensitive cells induced cisplatin resistance. Mechanistically, cisplatin increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation as well as autophagic activity. Blocking autophagy with the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA sensitized resistant ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin. HK2 overexpression enhanced cisplatin-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and autophagy while HK2 knockdown showed the opposite effects. Blocking the MEK/ERK pathway using the MEK inhibitor U0126 prevented cisplatin-induced autophagy enhanced by HK2 overexpression. Furthermore, HK2 knockdown sensitized resistance ovarian tumor xenografts to cisplatin in vivo. In conclusion, our data supported that HK2 promotes cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer by enhancing drug-induced, ERK-mediated autophagy. Therefore, targeting HK2 may be a new therapeutic strategy to combat chemoresistance in ovarian cancer.

Abstract: The optical properties of p-type, n-type and nominally undoped (AlxGa1−x)yIn1−yP layers have been determined in a wide spectral range. The layers under study have been chosen with compositions and dopant concentrations which make them interesting for their use in III-V multijunction solar cells. The layers have been measured by variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry and, irrespective of composition and doping, their optical response has been modelled using the same model dielectric function consisting of two asymmetric Tauc-Lorentz oscillators and a 3D-M0 Adachi term. The results show that transition energy values change with layer composition, whilst for layers of the same material (i.e. GaInP or AlInP), the band-gap transition energy E0 shows a strong dependence on the order parameter. The refractive indexes and extinction coefficients deduced from the ellipsometric data have been used to fit reflectance measurements for the same layers and an excellent agreement has been achieved, thus validating the model dielectric function proposed for this kind of materials.

Abstract: PCM has been investigated for solar energy storage in recent years. The magnesium nitrate hexahydrate was chosen as PCM due to the suitable melting temperature and high latent heat for solar thermal energy in this paper. In order to prevent the leakage during the phase transition, a novel form-stable composite PCM based on diatomite was prepared by the vacuum impregnation method. The micromorphology, chemical structure, crystalloid phase, thermal properties, supercooling degree, thermal conductivity and thermal reliability were investigated by SEM, XRD, FT-IR, DSC, self-designed device and hot-wire method. FT-IR spectra indicated that there was no chemical reaction during the preparation process. The supercooling tested by the self-designed device was just 0.3 °C which can be neglected. The melting and freezing temperature measured by DSC and step-cooling curve method were 88.89 °C and 83.5 °C, respectively. Furthermore, the latent heat was 69.39 J/g and the adsorptive capacity was 46.78% according the pure PCM used in this study. The thermal reliability test was performed and the results showed that the thermal properties basically unchanged after 2000 thermal cycles.

Abstract: Solar reflectors for Concentrating Solar Technologies require a high reflectance in the terrestrial solar spectrum (280–4000nm). Besides the wavelength, the reflectance of solar mirror materials is also dependent on the incidence angle of the incoming sunlight. The commonly used measurement equipment measures the reflectance at fixed near-normal incidence angles, typically between 8° and 15°. In this work, the annual incidence angle frequency distribution has been calculated for a LS3/Eurotrough-type parabolic-trough collector located at different sites, and for the heliostat field of the solar tower system CESA-1 located at the Plataforma Solar de Almería in Tabernas, southern Spain. It was found that the most frequent incidence angles registered in the solar field are quite higher than the ones at which reflectance is measured with state of the art instruments, obtaining mean incidence angles in the range of 28–35° depending on the type and location of the solar field. A methodology to predict the off-normal reflectance of silvered-glass mirrors based on near-normal reflectance and transmittance measurements of the uncoated glass is presented. The complex refractive index of 2, 4 and 5mm thick solar glass and the deposited silver was determined and used to model the solar weighted reflectance of silvered-glass mirrors at different incidence angles. The model was compared to experimental measurements. For this purpose, the Spectral Specular Reflectometer (S2R) has been improved and updated with a polarizer crystal to measure reflectance at perpendicular (s-pol) and parallel (p-pol) polarizations up to incidence angles of θ = 70°. Eight solar mirror materials (three silvered-glass mirrors of different glass thicknesses, two anti-soiling coated glass mirrors, two enhanced aluminum reflectors and a silvered polymer film) have been measured over a broad range of incidence angles and the results have been weighted with the annual incidence angle frequency distribution. The obtained incidence angle-weighted reflectance is a suited parameter to compare the efficiency of solar mirror materials taking into account their use in a specific collector type and location.

Abstract: Objective/background
Posttranslational modification of proteins, including glycosylation, is known to differ between normal and tumor cells. Altered glycosyltransferase levels have been observed in tumor tissues and their role in tumor metastasis and invasion has been implicated. In this study the role of altered glycosyltransferase messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in serum of gastric cancer patients as early markers of gastric cancer was evaluated.
Methods
In this case control study the expression profile of ppGalNAc-T6, GlcNAcT-V, ST3Gal I, ST3 Gal IV, and ST6GalNAc-I in normal healthy control and gastric cancer patients was compared. Serum was isolated from blood samples of gastric cancer patients (n = 200) and controls (n = 200). Following RNA extraction, reverse transcription was carried out and transcript levels of glycosyltransferases were determined using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and normalized against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) expression. The amount of target gene, normalized to an endogenous reference gene relative to calibrator was calculated by using ΔΔCT method. Transcript levels in the serum samples of gastric cancer patients were compared with those of controls; also the same was correlated within sex and different stages of disease.
Results
The mRNA expression of ppGalNAc-T6 and ST6GalNAc-I was significantly higher in serum samples of gastric cancer patients on comparison with controls (p = .008), however, there was no significant difference in mRNA expression of GlcNAcT-V, ST3Gal I, and ST3 Gal IV in serum samples of gastric cancer patients and controls (p = .097). In addition, no significant association of mRNA expression of these glycosyltransferases was found within sex and stages in this study.
Conclusion
This study revealed the potential of ppGalNAc-T6 and ST6GalNAc-I mRNA transcript levels in serum as markers of gastric cancer. Further studies on the wider range of glycosyltransferases in various cancers are needed to establish signature mRNA batteries as minimally invasive markers of gastric cancer.

Abstract: K650M/E substitutions in the Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) are associated with Severe Achondroplasia with Developmental Delay and Acanthosis Nigricans (SADDAN) and Thanatophoric Dysplasia type II (TDII), respectively. Both SADDAN and TDII present with affected endochondral ossification marked by impaired chondrocyte functions and growth plate disorganization. In vitro, K650M/E substitutions confer FGFR3 constitutive kinase activity leading to impaired biosynthesis and accumulation of immature receptors in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi. From those compartments, both SADDAN-FGFR3 and TDII-FGFR3 receptors engender uncontrolled signalling, activating PLCγ1, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1, 3 and 5 (STAT1/3/5) and ERK1/2 effectors. Here, we investigated the impact of SADDAN-FGFR3 and TDII-FGFR3 signalling on cytoskeletal organization. We report that SADDAN-FGFR3, but not TDII-FGFR3, affects F-actin organization by inducing tyrosine hyperphosphorylation of paxillin, a key regulator of focal adhesions and actin dynamics. Paxillin phosphorylation was upregulated at tyrosine 118, a functional target of Src and FAK kinases. By using Src-deficient cells and a Src kinase inhibitor, we established a role played by Src activation in paxillin hyperphosphorylation. Moreover, we found that SADDAN-FGFR3 induced FAK phosphorylation at tyrosines 576/577, suggesting its involvement as a Src co-activator in paxillin phosphorylation. Interestingly, paxillin hyperphosphorylation by SADDAN-FGFR3 caused paxillin mislocalization and partial co-localization with the mutant receptor. Finally, the SADDAN-FGFR3 double mutant unable to bind PLCγ1 failed to promote paxillin hyperphosphorylation, pointing to PLCγ1 as an early player in mediating paxillin alterations. Overall, our findings contribute to elucidate the molecular mechanism leading to cell dysfunctions caused by SADDAN-FGFR3 signalling.

Abstract: A series of triphenylamine derivatives containing acceptor groups, including TPA-CHO, TPA-E2CN, TPA-2T-CHO, TPA-2T-E2CN, TPA-2EDOT-CHO, and TPA-2EDOT-E2CN, was synthesized, and their corresponding polymers were prepared. The polymer films exhibited reversible color changes upon electrochemical doping and dedoping. Among them, P(TPA-2T-CHO) and P(TPA-2EDOT-CHO) films showed reversible color changes from yellow to black and from green to blue, respectively. These polymer films had moderate optical contrasts in visible region and high optical contrasts in the near-infrared region. The optical contrasts of P(TPA-2T-CHO) and P(TPA-2EDOT-E2CN) films were 42.8% and 37.7% at 647 nm, and reached 81.8% and 75.6% at 1000 nm, respectively. Furthermore, these polymer films showed reasonable response times and redox stabilities upon electrochemical doping and dedoping.

Abstract: A fast-switching all-solid state symmetrical electrochromic device was successfully fabricated using poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as electrode and a poly(ionic liquid) based on 1,2,3-triazole with oxyethylene spacer as solid electrolyte. PEDOT:PSS solution was spincoated on ITO glass and annealed to obtain the electrode layers. Two different types of electrolyte were synthesized via copper-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) using novel azide/alkyne-terminal monomers. These newly developed main-chain 1,2,3-triazole-based poly(ionic liquid)s having variable spacer length underwent quaternization using methyl iodide and subsequently allowed to make anion exchange with lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide salt to obtain PILs with remarkable properties. The PIL bearing [–(CH2CH2O)6–] spacer showed a conductivity of 1.20 × 10−4 S cm−1 which is at par with best side-chain PILs in literature and it efficiently switches an electrochromic device (ECD) with 22% optical contrast from its transparent state to a colored state in 2.5 s and 3.2 s to return to its bleached state. Likewise, it exhibits excellent thermal and mechanical stability that is ideal for practical applications.

Abstract: Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells have attracted tremendous attention in the recent years due to their potential to provide an earth-abundant and low cost solution to solar energy conversion. Unlike inorganic solar cells, BHJ solar cells use small molecular or polymeric light absorbers which can be delicately designed and assembled. With the aim of facilitating light absorption and improving morphology for efficient charge separation and transfer, hydrogen-bonding (H-bonding) has been employed in BHJ solar cells due to its relatively strong non-covalent interactions, highly directional and specific characteristics. The current review aims to summarize H-bonding in small molecule and polymer based donor materials as well as acceptor materials in BHJ solar cells. Emphasis will be placed on the molecular design of incorporating H-bonding in the donor and acceptor materials. The morphology optimization and power conversion efficiency (PCE) improvement in the presence of H-bonding will be the central topics of this review.

Abstract: Spectrally selective absorber coatings which have high thermal stable at temperatures ≥ 500°C in open air atmosphere are more beneficial for all types of concentrated solar thermal power (CSP) applications. In order to achieve this, high crystalline zirconia nanoparticles are synthesized via Lyothermal process were embedded into a spinel matrix to form a novel composite solar selective absorber layer (Mn-Cu-Co-Ox-ZrO2). To enhance the absorption substantially, an ink-bottle type mesoporous MgF2 nanoparticles are synthesized via novel route have been deposited further. As a result, a novel tandem absorber system (Mn-Cu-Co-Ox-ZrO2/MgF2) has been developed with α/ε = 0.97/0.17 @500°C. The composite layer comprises of tetragonal phase Zirconia particles which were uniformly distributed in the spinel matrix responsible for high optical performance and high thermal stability. These properties are thoroughly investigated by micro X-ray diffraction (µXRD), X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) and Elemental mapping by Energy filtered transmission electron microscope (EF-TEM) technique. This novel composite absorber layer developed by a facile route exhibits superior stability up to 700°C ideally in the air makes a promising advancement for the cost-effective power generation by CSP systems.

Abstract: Pt-doped KxWO3 nanorods with excellent near-infrared shielding and heat insulation performance were prepared by solvothermal reduction method using cheap sodium tungstate as raw materials. The effects of K/W ratio and Pt doping on the microstructure, morphology and transparent heat insulation performance of KxWO3 particles were investigated. It was found that Pt doping contributed to increasing the content of W in reduced state (W5+ and W4+), promoting the uniform growth of hexagonal KxWO3 nanorods and decreasing the particle size. Compared with the undoped KxWO3 particles, Pt-doped KxWO3 samples exhibited improved near-infrared shielding and heat insulation properties. Particularly, when K/W was 0.4, the incorporation of trace Pt (0.1mol%) greatly improved the near-infrared shielding and transparent insulation properties of KxWO3 particles, which is ascribed to its lower powder resistivity and more content of W in reduced state (W5+ and W4+). Whereas too much Pt-doping amount tended to decrease the visible light transmittance of KxWO3. The mechanism of Pt doping promoting the W5+/W4+ formation and improving the heat insulation of KxWO3 were discussed. It is suggested that the trace Pt-doped KxWO3 particles with excellent transparency and heat insulation properties are more suitable for the preparation of transparent insulation films and have broad applications in the field of energy-saving window glasses.

Abstract: In this work the standard wet chemical and plasma texturing processes for multi wire slurry abrasive sawn multi-crystalline silicon were applied to fixed diamond wire sawn (DW) multi-crystalline silicon. The plasma etch produced an effective anti-reflective layer without any changes to the process parameters. The achieved texture features a reflectance well below 5% in the visible range. Furthermore the mechanical strength of the wafers was investigated. 4-point bending tests revealed that anisotropic strength behavior is still present for the plasma textured wafer. In addition to their excellent optical properties, the plasma textured wafers show increase of 123% in characteristic fracture stress related to the as-cut batch for the critical loading with the saw marks parallel to the rollers. This can lead to a significantly reduced breakage rates during solar cell production. It is shown, that the characteristic fracture stress of the multi-crystalline plasma textured batch is equal to the strength of mono-crystalline industrial wet etched fixed diamond wire sawn wafer.

Abstract: Inorganic solid-state electrochromic devices (ECDs) based on tantalum oxide (Ta2O5) as ion conductor layer were fabricated by vacuum cathodic arc plasma (CAP) deposition. This work focuses on key factor of fabricating Ta2O5 film deposited by CAP through four different ratios of oxygen and argon. Our results show that refractive index mostly decreased with increasing oxygen flow rate. Refractive index of 1.9 was achieved for Ta 2O5 film with O2/Ar = 2.4 which provided high ion conduction pathways through a highly porous structure. We also observed higher ionic conductivity σi=3.5×10−6Scm−1 for Ta2O5 film at O2/Ar = 2.4 which enhanced ion's mobility for ECDs causing rapid coloring/bleaching phenomenon. As a result, excellent optical density and rapid response times were observed in fabricated device with an area of 20 cm2, exhibiting optical density of 0.63 (@550 nm) and transmittance variation T = 50% (@550 nm) with the bleaching time= 5 s and transmittance variation T = 50% (@550 nm) with the coloring time = 13 s.

Abstract: Interfacial engineering of the photoanode has been one of the most important strategies in designing high-performance quantum dot (QD)-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs). In this work, we demonstrated a promising route to enhance the photovoltaic performance by inserting an additional CdS inner shell between AgInSe2 (AISe) QDs and a ZnS outer shell to obtain an AISe/CdS/ZnS core/shell/shell QDSSC. These double passivation shells prevent current leakage from the QDs to the electrolyte. The results of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy confirmed that the CdS/ZnS double passivation shell in the AISe QDSSC contributes greatly to suppression of charge recombination. As a result, the AISe QDSSC with CdS/ZnS double passivation shells exhibited a remarkably high conversion efficiency (6.27%), which is significantly higher than those of devices without a passivation shell (1.02%) and with CdS (4.37%) or ZnS (5.23%) single passivation shells. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this efficiency is one of the highest values obtained for an Ag-based QDSSC.

Abstract: A sub-micron-thick selective multilayer solar thermal absorber made of tungsten, SiO2 and Si3N4 multilayer thin films was theoretically designed and experimentally demonstrated in this work. The optical performance was optimized by the particle swarm optimization algorithm for this multilayer absorber, whose spectral selectivity is associated with the Fabry-Perot resonance and anti-reflection effects. The designed multilayer absorber was deposited by sputtering and chemical vapor deposition techniques on the wafer scale. Its spectral absorptance characterized by a Fourier Transform Infrared spectrometer (FTIR) was demonstrated to be greater than 0.95 in the solar spectrum and less than 0.1 emittance in the mid-infrared with angular insensitivity. Temperature dependent FTIR measurements with an optical fiber setup revealed stable optical performance up to 600°C in ambient, while thermal cycle testing showed its long-term thermal stability at 400°C. Theoretical analysis of solar to power efficiency for a Carnot heat engine driven by the Solar heat was performed, which clearly shows that the proposed ultrathin selective multilayer absorber with spectral selectivity, angular insensitivity as well as high temperature stability could significantly boost the conversion efficiency of solar thermal systems at mid to high temperatures.

Abstract: Tumours exhibit a heterogeneous mix of cell types that reciprocally regulate their growth in the tumour stroma, considerably affecting the progression of the disease. Both adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells and Wnt signalling pathway are vital in driving breast tumour growth. Hence, we examined the effect of secreted factors released by adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells, and further explored the anti-tumour property of the Wnt antagonist secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (sFRP4) on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast tumour cells. We observed that conditioned medium and extracellular matrix derived from adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells inhibited tumour viability. The inhibitory effect of the conditioned medium was retained within its low molecular weight and non-protein component. The conditioned medium also induced apoptosis accompanied by a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential in tumour cells, Furthermore, it downregulated the protein expression of active β-catenin and Cyclin D1, which are major target proteins of the Wnt signalling pathway, and reduced the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL. The combination of conditioned medium and sFRP4 further potentiated the effects, depending on the tumour cell line and experimental assay. We conclude that factors derived from conditioned medium of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells and sFRP4 significantly decreased the tumour cell viability and migration rates (MCF-7), accompanied with an enhanced apoptotic activity through inhibition of canonical Wnt signalling. Besides giving an insight to possible paracrine interactions and influence of signalling pathways, reflective of a breast tumour microenvironment, this study emphasises the utilization of cell free-secreted factors and Wnt antagonists to improve conventional anti-cancer strategies.

Abstract: Gelatin, denatured collagen, temporarily exists in tissues and may well be pathophysiologically involved in tissue remodeling, inflammation or tissue damage. The present study is aimed to investigate possible biological roles of gelatin by examining its effects on monocyte-like histiocytic lymphoma cell line U937. Once stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), U937 cells differentiate into macrophage-like cells, changing from non-adherent to adherent cells with extended pseudopodia. Here we pre-treated the cell dishes with gelatin solution for cell culture. Interestingly, we found that PMA-stimulated U937 cells formed multicellular aggregates on gelatin-coated dishes, accompanying NF-κB-mediated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, whereas cell aggregation was not detected on non-coated dishes. Moreover, differentiated U937 cells on gelatin-coated dishes showed increased autophagy level and endocytosis. Surprisingly, formation of multicellular aggregates and pro-inflammatory cytokine production were both attenuated by either down-regulation of autophagy with inhibitors, such as 3-methyladenine (3MA) or chloroquine (CQ), or repression of endocytosis with siRNA targeting Endo180. Moreover, autophagy was inhibited by si-Endo180, and endocytosis was suppressed by 3MA, suggesting a positive feedback loop between autophagy and endocytosis. The results revealed that gelatin-coating induced differentiated U937 cells to form cell aggregates and promote NF-κB-mediated pro-inflammatory cytokine production at least partially through an endocytosis-autophagy pathway.

The outcome of the published research on its applicability for this purpose is inconsistent and sometimes contradictory. We identified that there is a need for further study on the material to overcome such uncertainty. Thus we conducted a series of thermal measurements to quantify its properties and suitability for a phase change thermal storage. Our differential scanning calorimetric measurements showed that the material has a melting temperature of 167°C and fusion heat of 297kJ/kg. However, our accelerated thermal cycling test revealed that this value decreases logarithmically to 249 and 240kJ/kg after 100 and 200 cycles respectively. The material shows a significant level of sub-cooling in DSC measurement with a solidification temperature of approximately 110–120°C which can render the material unsuitable for thermal storage purposes. However, our secondary measurement with a large quantity of D-mannitol shows that such level of sub-cooling is unlikely to occur in a macro-scale sample. We built and tested a thermal storage system containing 3.8kg of D-mannitol to investigate its performance in larger quantities and evaluate the heat transfer properties of the heat exchanger mechanism in the storage system. We show that the material releases significant heat when it is cooled down to 150°C which means implies the occurrence of solidification at a temperature above 150°C.

Abstract: Organic–inorganic CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) inverted structured perovskite films were prepared using Pb(CH3COO)2 (Pb(OAc)2) and CH3NH3I (MAI) as source materials. The structural, optical and photoelectronic properties of the MAPbI3 films varied with the Pb(OAc)2/MAI molar ratio. It was found that the Pb(OAc)2/MAI molar ratio greatly influenced the structure and morphology of the MAPbI3 films. A suitable amount of excessive Pb(OAc)2 (about 5mol% excessive Pb) in the solution made the film smoother with improved film crystallinity. This resulted in enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, for films derived from solution with low Pb(OAc)2/MAI or high Pb(OAc)2/MAI ratio, defects such as pits or pinholes were easily formed with low crystallinity, and hence decreased the lifetime of the carriers and photoelectrical properties of the final solar cells. Using a solution with 5% excessive Pb, inverted structured CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells with PCE of nearly 14% were obtained.

Abstract: InAs thermophotovoltaic (TPV) cells with external quantum efficiency at the peak wavelengths reaching 71% at low temperature and 55% at room temperature are reported, which are the highest values to date for InAs. The TPV exhibited 10% power conversion efficiency at 100K cell temperature. The dark and light current-voltage characteristics were measured at different cell temperatures (100–340K) in response to heat sources in the range 500–800°C. The resulting dependences of the output voltage and current as well as the spectral response of the InAs TPV have been extensively characterized for waste heat recovery applications. The performance of these cells is strongly determined by the dark current which increases rapidly with increasing cell temperature originating from bandgap narrowing, which resulted in a reduction of open circuit voltage and output power.

Abstract: Highly efficient diamond wire sawn (DWS) multi-crystalline Si (mc-Si) solar cells with a satisfactory visual appearance are expecting to dominate the photovoltaic industry soon. Here, we report the realization of broadband spectral response of DWS mc-Si solar cells with omnidirectional performance and improved appearance. The success lies in the effective surface texturization based on MACE technique followed by post acid modification and the introduction of SiO2/SiNx stack layers on the rear side. Bowl-like pits with an open size of about 1µm are uniformly formed on the Si surface regardless of the crystallographic directions, which significantly enhances the antireflection ability in the short wavelength and makes the grain boundaries less noticeable. We have also shown that the bowl-like textured cells possess exceptional optical absorption over wide angles of incidence from 0° to 70°. Moreover, the SiO2/SiNx stack layers enhance the rear internal reflection and passivation, effectively increasing the long wavelength absorption and suppressing the electrical losses. We have successfully mass-produced DWS mc-Si solar cells with an average efficiency of 19.1%, which is 1.2% absolutely higher than that of the conventional micro-textured counterparts.

Abstract: A comparison of performance parameters for first, second and third generation PV technologies has been conducted. Organic photovoltaic (OPV) modules displayed markedly different outdoor performance characteristics to other PV technologies owing to the positive temperature coefficient, lower thermal mass and response under low light conditions. The linear relationship between irradiance and module temperature rise above ambient is studied, leading to calculation of values for the Ross coefficient for OPV modules. OPVs are shown to possess a lower Ross coefficient than poly-Si, due to the lower absorption of infrared radiation. The effect of wind speed on the Ross coefficient is also investigated, showing the effect that module structure has upon outdoor PV performance, with the OPV module cooling quicker under windy conditions than the poly-Si due to a lower thermal mass. A long term stability study on OPV modules with a silver nanowire-zinc oxide (AgNW-ZnO) composite front electrode has showed two phases of degradation: a short initial burn-in with significant drops in performance; followed by stabilisation and degradation progressing at a much slower rate. During the burn-in period the modules showed diurnal reversible degradation in the short circuit current (ISC), whereas open circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF) show a steady decline. The reversible degradation is assumed to be related to the desorption of oxygen from the ZnO layer during the day due to UV excitation, leading to an increase in trap formation and a drop in current generation capacity, followed by re-adsorption of the oxygen overnight.

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative life-cycle assessment of photovoltaic (PV) electricity generation in Singapore by various p-type multicrystalline silicon (multi-Si) PV technologies. We consider the entire value chain of PV from the mining of silica sand to the PV system installation. Energy payback time (EPBT) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are used as indicators for evaluating the environmental impacts of PV electricity generation. Three roof-integrated PV systems using different p-type multi-Si PV technologies (cell or module) are investigated: (1) Al-BSF (aluminum back surface field) solar cells with the conventional module structure (i.e. glass/encapsulant/cell/encapsulant/backsheet); (2) PERC (passivated emitter and rear cell) devices with the conventional module structure; and (3) PERC solar cells with the frameless double-glass module structure (i.e. glass/encapsulant/cell/encapsulant/glass). The EPBTs for (1) to (3) are 1.11, 1.08 and 1.01 years, respectively, while their GHG emissions are 30.2, 29.2 and 20.9g CO2-eq/kWh, respectively. Our study shows that shifting from the conventional Al-BSF cell technology to the state-of-the-art PERC cell technology will reduce the EPBT and GHG emissions for PV electricity generation. It also illustrates that mitigating light-induced degradation is critical for the PERC technology to maintain its environmental advantages over the conventional Al-BSF technology. Finally, our study also demonstrates that long-term PV module reliability has great impacts on the environmental performance of PV technologies. The environmental benefits (in terms of EPBT and GHG emissions) of PV electricity generation can be significantly enhanced by using frameless double-glass PV module design.

PEDOT:PSS/n-Si front-junction solar cell showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13–14% (11–12%) with a short-circuit density, JSC of 29–31mA/cm2 (25–26mA/cm2), an open-circuit voltage, VOC of 0.62V (0.625V), and a fill factor, FF of 0.72 (0.704) for a 2 × 2cm2 (4in.) size device. Solar cell module consisting of ten-units of series-connected 2 × 2cm2 (4in.) sized cells exhibited a output power of 0.37W (7.3W) with a VOC of 6.1V (6.2V), a JSC of 0.084A (1.78A), and a FF of 0.712 (0.71). We also confirmed that it worked as a stand-alone photovoltaic system for remote monitoring of wireless camera drive.

Abstract: Metallization is one of the key process steps to fabricate solar cells with high performance in a cost-effective way. Majority of photovoltaic solar cell manufacturing uses thick film screen print metallization with Ag containing paste to produce solar cells. The average lifetime of PV modules can be expected to be more than 25 years. The disposal of PV systems will become a problem in view of the continually increasing production of PV modules. These can be recycled for about the same cost as their disposal. The proposed method of acidic and basic etching of contacts, presented in this article can be successfully applied to broken solar cells from the landfill without a specialist analysis procedure. The amount of silver that can be recovered from the etching solution is up to 1.6kg/t of broken solar cells. The step-by-step procedure improves efficiency of silver recovery. The best and easiest method for general verification of the silver etching rate is classic titration with suitable concentrations of titrant solution.

Abstract: CZTSSe (sulfur around 1%) absorber was prepared by sputtering on a CZTS target followed by selenization under Ar carried H2Se gas. The mechanism of CZTSSe formation was investigated by Ar annealing and selenization of sputtered CZTS precursor. The apparent decomposition temperature of CZTS precursor annealed under Ar atmosphere was between 450°C and 500°C. While the temperature that CZTS precursor transformed into high-selenium CZTSSe film annealed under Ar carried H2Se gas was determined to be ≤ 400°C. CZTSSe with single-grain layer was obtained when selenization temperature exceeded 520°C. By supplying H2Se from suitable temperature, the metal components of precursor and resulting absorber were almost the same. The highest efficiency of 9.6% achieved at the optimal temperature of 560°C.

Abstract: This work demonstrates the influence of annealing temperature on the phase morphology of the polymer-non-fullerene blend and its relationship with the dielectric constants of the blend layer. It is also the first study to report the annealing induced changes in dielectric environment of the active layer blend employing non-fullerene acceptor. Polymer solar cells (PSCs) annealed at 80°C were found to possess optimal blend morphology favourable for efficient charge separation owing to reduced coulomb capture radius and relatively high dielectric constant, resulting in high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ~11.4%. The high performing devices fabricated at optimized temperature also exhibited superior charge transport characteristics including high recombination resistance (Rrec) which is 31% higher than the non-annealed devices. The effect of intermolecular aggregation induced by the annealing temperature and its relationship with the disorder states in the blend layer, influencing the electron transport properties is also investigated in detail. Furthermore, a month long degradation study investigating the operational stability of the as-developed non-fullerene based PSCs was also performed and analysed.

Abstract: The thermal stability in air of solar selective coatings based on the novel MoSi2–Si3N4 hybrid composite has been investigated here for the first time. Although thermal stability of solar absorbers is typically examined under vacuum, high temperature air stability is required for practical applications in concentration solar power (CSP) technologies: solar tower systems receivers operate in air and, on the other hand, air stability is highly preferred in parabolic trough collector systems due to occasionally undesired losses of vacuum conditions. In this work, the effect of different layers combination, prepared by sputtering, on the optical performance after high temperature annealing has been investigated. Two different standard substrates (stainless steel and Inconel) have been explored. It is shown that silver layer, typically used in SSC as IR reflector, strongly affects the stack thermal stability in air, leading to important degradation. For SSC stacks with the Inconel/MoSi2-Si3N4/Si3N4 structure (onto Inconel substrate), a good thermal stability in air is obtained, leading to just a slight variation of the absorptivity after air annealing at 600°C, probably due to partial Si3N4 oxidation. Best optical performance is achieved for the Inconel substrate, using and additional Al2O3 barrier on top, comprising the stack the following structure: Inconel/MoSi2-Si3N4/Si3N4/Al2O3. This combination exhibits very good optical performance, even after annealing at 700°C in air. The Performance Criterion (PC) according to the International Energy Agency, evaluated after successive air annealing cycles of 100h at 600°C, gets 0.02, which is considerably smaller than 0.05, fulfilling this material the PC for practical applications. Our results evidence that the MoSi2–Si3N4 absorber deposited onto Inconel substrate and capped with a Si3N4/Al2O3 layer on top (acting as antireflective and protective barrier) is a very promising selective coating for solar receivers operating in air at temperatures about 600°C.

Abstract: Phase change microcapsules (MicroPCM) with polymer-SiO2/TiC hybrid shell have been prepared via pickering emulsion polymerization using organically modified SiO2 and TiC nanoparticles as pickering agents. The inorganic particles were incorporated in the shell of resultant MicroPCM, which can be enhanced the performances of MicroPCM. On the basis of SEM micrographs, the resultant MicroPCM exhibited a perfect spherical morphology and a well-defined core-shell structure. The size of the microcapsules can be adjusted by the nanoparticle concentration. In addition, Thermal properties of the MicroPCM was investigated using DSC, TGA and forward looking infrared system. The results indicate that the MicroPCM with polymer-SiO2/TiC hybrid shell has good thermal energy storage-release performance, enhanced thermal stability, and increased thermal conductivity. Our study demonstrated that pickering emulsion polymerization is a simple and economical approach for the preparation of MicroPCM with high thermal performance. The MicroPCM with polymer-inorganic hybrid shell has promising prospect in the field of thermal energy storage.

Abstract: Baicalein, an active flavonoid extracted from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, has fascinating anti-cancer effects on many cancers. Our previous study also found that baicalein inhibited cervical cancer cell proliferation and migration, and induced cervical cancer cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-cancer effects of baicalein are largely unknown. In this study, we identified a novel long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), which is downregulated by baicalein in a dose- and time-dependent manner in cervical cancer. We named this lncRNA as baicalein down-regulated long noncoding RNA (BDLNR). Gain-of- and loss-of-function assays showed that BDLNR was required for baicalein-induced cell proliferation inhibition, cell death induction, migration inhibition, and in vivo tumor growth inhibition of cervical cancer. Mechanistically, BDLNR physically bound to YBX1, recruited YBX1 to PIK3CA promoter, activated PIK3CA expression and PI3K/Akt pathway. Furthermore, BDLNR was upregulated in cervical cancer and associated with poor prognosis of cervical cancer patients. Collectively, our data demonstrated that BDLNR mediated the anti-cancer effects of baicalein in cervical cancer via activating PI3K/Akt pathway, and implied that BDLNR would be potential therapeutic target for enhancing the anti-cancer effects of baicalein in cervical cancer.

Abstract: NaNO3-KNO3 (60–40wt%, Solar salt) has been used as medium for TES and HTF in the CSP system. One of the key challenges using Solar salt is its high melting temperature, which may freeze and block the pipeline. In this work, a novel eutectic nitrate molten salt of the LiNO3-NaNO3-KNO3-CsNO3 system with low melting temperature of 368K is designed using Calphad method. Its thermal physical properties, as well as that of Solar salt, LiNO3-NaNO3-KNO3, NaNO3-KNO3-CsNO3, NaNO3-KNO3-Ca(NO3)2, and LiNO3-NaNO3-KNO3-CsNO3-Ca(NO3)2 molten salts are comprehensively determined and evaluated for better understanding their thermal storage and heat transfer performances, such as the melting temperature, thermal stability, specific heat capacity, thermal diffusivity, density and viscosity. The energy storage capacities and figures of merit of the six molten nitrate salts are calculated based on their thermophysical properties to evaluate their TES and HTF performances. This work not only provides the basic engineering data for CSP system, but is useful for choosing media of TES and HTF.

Abstract: Polymer dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) glazing is a potential electrically actuated switchable adaptive glazing for low energy building application as it become transparent in the presence of alternating current (AC) power supply and become translucent/opaque without power supply. Optical properties and protection factor for a particular type of PDLC glazing was investigated in this work. Using UV–vis–NIR (1050) spectrophotometer spectral transmittance of this glazing was measured for its both states. PDLC on state needs 20V AC power supply to offer 41% transmission while without any supply this glazing becomes 23% transparent. In the switch off state LC particles offer forward scattering which makes this glazing translucent with high 82.6% haze. Solar factor for PDLC transparent and translucent state was found to be 0.53 and 0.39 respectively. Glazing protection factors were calculated using spectral transmittance data. Switchable transparency and switchable solar factor makes this glazing suitable to match adaptability of building occupants.

Abstract: Ge alloyed Cu2SnS3 (CTGS) thin films were prepared by annealing the sputtered deposited Cu-Ge-Sn precursor films under sulfur atmosphere at different annealing temperatures. The influence of different annealing temperatures on morphological, compositional, crystal structure of CTGS thin films were investigated. It was found that the annealing temperature of 550°C provides a favorable sulfurization environment to promote grain growth leading to a compact thin film formation. Improved performance is ascribed to high Ge contents as evidenced from X-ray fluorescence (XRF) studies. Well incorporated Ge atoms into CTS thin film can be confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study provides an evidence of existence of Ge atoms where its binding energy located at 25.78 and 26.78eV, respectively. However, the decreased performance was found at unsuitable annealing temperatures such as 500°C, 520°C, 580°C and 600°C. Finally, with annealing temperatures of 550°C, the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.14% was attained with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 220mV, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 23.74mA/cm2 and a fill factor (FF) of 41%.

Abstract: p-Type hydrogenated silicon carbide (p-SiC:H) films were prepared using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition by systematically incorporating carbon into nanocrystalline silicon networks. The carbon content of the films was varied by adjusting the methane/silane (CH4/SiH4; RC) ratio. The chemical bonding, microstructural, and electro-optical properties of the films were investigated in detail. With increasing RC, the silicon-carbon bond density in the films increased gradually and the overall microstructure became amorphous. Through sophisticated control of the carbon content of the films during high hydrogen dilution deposition, p-type hydrogenated nanocrystalline SiC:H (p-nc-SiC:H) films with nanometer-scale Si crystallites embedded in an amorphous SiC:H matrix were obtained. The p-nc-SiC:H films had wide bandgaps larger than 2 eV and reduced parasitic light absorption at wavelengths below 550 nm. When using wide-bandgap p-nc-SiC:H films with superior electro-optical properties as window layers in n-i-p flexible and p-i-n semi-transparent nc-Si:H solar cells, in place of conventional p-nc-Si:H layers with narrow bandgaps, enhanced cell performance was achieved because of both high open circuit voltage (VOC) and high quantum efficiency values at short wavelengths of 350–550 nm. The conversion efficiencies of the flexible nc-Si:H solar cells increased from 6.37% (VOC = 0.41 V, JSC = 22.81 mA/cm2, and FF = 68.10%, where JSC is the short-circuit current density and FF is the fill factor, respectively) to 7.89% (VOC = 0.51 V, JSC = 24.04 mA/cm2, and FF = 64.37%). A further increase in the conversion efficiency to 9.18% was obtained by inserting a very thin, highly-doped p-nc-SiC:H buffer layer between a low-doped p-nc-SiC:H window layer and an indium tin oxide front contact. A significant increase in the conversion efficiency from 3.66% (VOC = 0.42 V, JSC = 14.83 mA/cm2, and FF = 58.69%) to 4.33% (VOC = 0.45 V, JSC = 17.74 mA/cm2, and FF = 54.18%) was achieved with the semi-transparent nc-Si:H solar cell, with an average optical transmittance of 17.29% in the visible wavelength region of 500–800 nm.

Abstract: The uniform illumination profile that falls on the PV cell is good for PV output and lifespan, however the flux distribution of the concentrating PV appears to be non-uniform in most cases which is harmful for the overall performance of the concentrating photovoltaic. In order to overcome this disadvantage, a novel asymmetric compound parabolic concentrator concentrating PV with uniform flux distribution is proposed in this paper. A two-dimensional finite element model is built for electrical performance simulation of the concentrating photovoltaic module. The prototype of the concentrating photovoltaic module is manufactured and assembled to conduct the indoor lab experiment under Standard Test Condition to verify the feasibility and reliability of the model. The outdoor experiments are conducted to show the electrical performance of the concentrating photovoltaic module under the real weather condition. Then the model is used to analyze the electrical performance of the PV cell under the flux distribution created by the proposed concentrator. The results show that the electrical performance of the proposed concentrating photovoltaic module is close to that under the uniform flux distribution with the same total radiation level, which confirms that the proposed concentrator is beneficial for the PV output under concentrating illumination due to uniform flux distribution.

Abstract: Sublimated thin-film CdTe photovoltaic devices with conversion efficiencies over 18% and a fill-factor greater than 79% have been repeatedly obtained using high-rate fabrication processes on commercial soda-lime glass substrates used in CdTe modules. Four major improvements to the device have enabled an increase in efficiency from a baseline of approximately 12–18.7%: 1) A sputtered multilayer metal-oxide anti-reflection layer; 2) total replacement of the CdS window layer with a higher bandgap sputtered MgxZn1−xO (MZO) window layer; 3) deposition of the CdTe layer at a higher thickness and substrate temperature; and 4) an evaporated tellurium back-contact. This work describes the effect of these changes on the device performance and film microstructural characteristics using various methods. Multiple devices with comparable high efficiency have been fabricated and demonstrated using methods described in this study, yielding very high efficiencies for CdTe polycrystalline thin-film photovoltaics using deposition processes and equipment in a university setting.

Abstract: Controlling the concentration of charge carriers near the surface is essential for solar cells. It permits to form regions with selective conductivity for either electrons or holes and it also helps to reduce the rate at which they recombine. Chemical passivation of the surfaces is equally important, and it can be combined with population control to implement carrier-selective, passivating contacts for solar cells. This paper discusses different approaches to suppress surface recombination and to manipulate the concentration of carriers by means of doping, work function and charge. It also describes some of the many surface-passivating contacts that are being developed for silicon solar cells, restricted to experiments performed by the authors.

Abstract: We investigate the properties of an electron selective front contact based on a phosphorous doped mixed-phase SiOx/Si layer stack at device level. The addition of the SiOx phase to the Si layer targets reduced optical absorption, pursuing the goal of a broad-band transparent full-area passivating contact for front-side application. To demonstrate the validity of our approach we realised a planar hybrid solar cell with the mixed-phase SiOx/Si-based passivating contact on the front side and a hydrogenated amorphous (i/p) silicon heterojunction as rear hole-selective contact. With this structure, we obtained a VOC of 691mV, a JSC of 33.9mA/cm2, a fill factor of 79.4% and an efficiency of 18.6% on a planar n-type FZ Si-wafer. Temperature-dependent IV-measurements at solar cell level were performed in order to understand the physical mechanisms behind charge carrier transport and surface passivation of the mixed-phase SiOx/Si layer stack. The results were compared to those of a standard silicon heterojunction (SHJ) cell on a similar planar substrate. The temperature dependence of the IV-curves in the range from –100°C to +75°C reveals that the hybrid cell is less temperature sensitive with respect to the SHJ cell. Furthermore, at low temperatures, the analysis reveals a reduction of the VOC temperature coefficient of the hybrid cell, whereas for the SHJ cell a saturation occurs. This behaviour hints that the barrier imposed by the SiOx/Si-based contact is less pronounced than the barrier imposed by a standard SHJ contact.

Abstract: Photovoltaic MoS2/Si nanowire array (SiNWA) heterojunction photodetectors (PDs) are constructed and investigated, which exhibit excellent photoresponse properties to light illumination at wavelengths from the deep ultraviolet to the near-infrared. Further photoresponse analysis reveals that a high responsivity of 53.5 A/W and a specific detectivity of 2.8 × 1013 Jones, as well as fast response speeds of 2.9/7.3 μs at 50 kHz are achieved in a MoS2/SiNWA heterojunction device. The high performances could be attributed to the high-quality heterojunction between MoS2 and the SiNWA. Such high performances of MoS2/SiNWA PDs are much better than those of previously reported MoS2-based PDs, suggesting that MoS2/SiNWA heterojunction devices have great potential in optoelectronic applications.

Abstract: Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a cardiac hormone essential for normal blood pressure and cardiac function. Corin is a transmembrane serine protease that activates ANP. Recently, we identified proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin-6 (PCSK6), also called PACE4, as the long-sought corin activator. Both corin and PCSK6 are expressed in cardiomyocytes, but corin activation occurs only on the cell surface. It remains unknown if cell membrane association is needed for PCSK6 to activate corin. Here we expressed corin deletion mutants in HEK293 cells to analyze the domain structures required for PCSK6-mediated activation. Our results show that soluble corin lacking the transmembrane domain was activated by PCSK6 in the conditioned medium but not intracellularly. Recombinant PCSK6 also activated the soluble corin under cell-free conditions. Moreover, PCSK6-mediated corin activation was not enhanced by cell membrane fractions. These results indicate that cell membrane association is unnecessary for PCSK6 to activate corin. Experiments with monensin that blocks PCSK6 secretion and immunostaining indicated that the soluble corin and PCSK6 were secreted via different intracellular pathways, which may explain the lack of corin activation inside the cell. We also found that the protein domains in the corin pro-peptide region were dispensable for PCSK6-mediated activation and that addition of heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate or treatment with heparinase or chondroitinase did not alter corin activation by PCSK6 in HEK293 cells. Together, our results provide important insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying PCSK6-mediated corin activation that is critical for cardiovascular homeostasis.

Abstract: Plasmonic enhanced solar cells are widely studied due to their increased performance arising from the metallic nanoparticles light absorption and scattering. In contrast, there are only few reports on solar cells which are based solely on the plasmonic metallic layer as the absorber. These cells are operating by hot electron injection in a Schottky barrier formed between the metallic nanoparticles and a semiconductor. In this work, we present photovoltaic cells which are based on an ultra-thin tunable Au layer as the only light absorbing material. These cells are in the solid state configuration composed of ITO|Au NP's|TiO2. High throughput methods are used in order to optimize the performance, which reaches 1mAcm−2 of current, and a voltage of 100mV under one sun illumination. The incident photon to electron conversion efficiency is 5.84% at 700nm, the highest reported for a solid-state device so far. These cells are the first step towards a plasmonic based tandem cell.

Abstract: In this work, thermal properties of five phase change materials (PCMs) with medium phase change temperature including mannitol, sebacic acid (SA), SA/expanded graphite (EG) composite, LiNO3-KCl eutectic salt and LiNO3-KCl/EG composite, were characterized using temperature history (T-history) method with improved accuracy. The studies on mannitol showed that although the T-history method could yield a supercooling degree which was lower than that from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) determination, the severe supercooling and great latent heat loss during mannitol's solidification were still the problems which hindered the use of this material. As for the rest materials, slight or no supercooling phenomena were observed and the obtained phase change temperatures were well matched to literature data. The latent heat measurements of these four materials proved a proportional relationship between the PCM/EG composite's latent heat and PCM's mass fraction. However, the latent heat values determined by T-history were higher than the DSC results. Therefore, repeated studies were still required to further evaluate the latent heat storage densities of these materials. The results in this work could play key roles in design, simulation and modification of latent thermal energy storage (LTES) systems based on these medium-temperature PCMs for solar heat applications.

Abstract: In this study, pure and Nickel doped α-Bismuth oxide (Ni-Bi2O3) powder were synthesized by simple chemical precipitation method. The resulting samples were analysed using SEM, EDAX, XRD, FTIR, UV–visible, PL and TRPL spectroscopy techniques. EDX and XRD results indicated that Ni was incorporated into the framework of the α-Bi2O3. The SEM characterizations revealed rod shape microstructures of the undoped Bi2O3 sample, while the Ni-doped product consisted of distorted or broken rod microstructures. Photo electrochemical (PEC) study plainly demonstrated the improved photo current density for Ni-doped sample compared to its pure counterpart. The photocatalytic activities of these samples were evaluated on the degradation of Methylene Blue under irradiation of simulated solar light. The Density Functional theory (DFT) study clearly revealed the formation of intensified energy state level in Ni-Bi2O3, supported by PL and UV, which was responsible for the high PEC and photocatalytic efficiency. The experimental results supported theoretical outcomes to conclude that Ni dopant serves as shallow trapping energy sites for photo excited charge carriers and greatly enhances the photoactivity of the catalyst.

Abstract: We demonstrate damage-free laser contact openings in silicon oxide layers on polycrystalline silicon on oxide (POLO) passivating contacts. A pulsed UV-laser evaporates the upper part of the polycrystalline silicon layer, lifting off the silicon oxide layer on top. On n-type POLO (and p-type POLO, respectively) samples a saturation current density of 2 fA cm−2 (6 fA cm−2) and an implied open-circuit voltage of 733 mV (727 mV) are achieved with a laser contact opening area fraction of 12.3% (8.7%). The application of this ablation process in an interdigitated back contact solar cell leads to an independently confirmed power conversion efficiency of 26.1%. The excellent contact quality of the laser contact openings is proven by the low series resistance of 0.1 Ω cm2 on the solar cell with a contact area of only 3%.

Abstract: In the current study pre-formed geopolymer half shells were fabricated from a combination of fly ash and black slag. Five (5) geopolymer shells were filled with a chloride-based phase change material (PCM) with a melting point of 540°C for use in a high temperature thermal energy storage system (TESS). Additionally, three (3) of these shells contained an inner coating of alumina (various manufacturers) while another geopolymer shell was pre-fired at 610°C. The half shells were cycled around the melting point of the PCM (500–580°C) for five (5) cycles, with the mass change of the samples recorded. Of the five (5) samples only the Aremco-coated sample suffered less PCM loss than the control. Furthermore, the melting point and latent heat of PCM samples from the geopolymer half shells were measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to find if degradation occurs. In all samples the PCM melting point was not affected while the latent heat was significantly affected. Additionally, the Aremco-coated sample resulted in PCM segregation.

Abstract: Aim
Chlordecone is able to induce pro-angiogenic effect through an estrogen receptor (ERα) pathway involving NO release and VEGF. The present study aimed to determine the molecular mechanisms by which chlordecone promotes angiogenesis in human endothelial cells.
Results
High but not low concentration of chlordecone increased mitochondrial respiratory capacity and mitochondrial DNA content in endothelial cells. The ROS scavenger MnTMPyP was able to prevent the increase of both VEGF expression and capillary length induced by chlordecone. A significant increase of cytoplasmic O2− production was observed after 1 and 4 h incubation of chlordecone, but not after 2 h. The NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin or silencing p47phox prevented angiogenesis and tube formation but also the increase in production of O2− at 1 h. In addition, apocynin as well silencing p47phox prevented eNOS activation and the NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME inhibited mitochondrial O2−production. All the previous effects of chlordecone were prevented by fulvestrant.
Conclusion
Our results indicate that an adaptation of the mitochondrial energy metabolism occurs in the chlordecone angiogenic response. Finally, we showed that chlordecone induces endothelial cells angiogenesis by a cross-talk involving NADPH oxidase and mitochondrial O2− via a NO sensitive pathways through activation of ERα. These findings propose that a molecular mechanism may partly explain the epidemiological evidence implicating chlordecone as risk factor carcinogenesis.

Abstract: A direct mapping of photovoltage in a complete Mo/CZTSSe/CdS/ZnO/Al:ZnO solar cell device is carried out using Kelvin probe force microscopic (KPFM) measurements in surface and junction modes. Four cells having different values of open circuit voltage (VOC) have been studied, and nanoscale variation of photovoltage have been obtained from the difference of surface potential (SP) images in the two modes. The maps exhibit a higher photovoltage at grain boundaries in general. Observed SP image of pristine CZTSe layer reveals downward band bending resulting in reduction of carrier recombination, and thus, lower Jdark at grain boundaries (GB). The observed downward band bending resulting in low Jdark at GB in CZTSe layer is used to explain the increase in photovoltage (VOC) at the GB. KPFM measurements of CZTSe and CZTSe/CdS layers show that the surface potential of CZTSe layer and its variation can be affected by CdS deposition and further device processing, in addition to surface adsorption and contamination effects. The photovoltage mapping obtained from Kelvin probe force microscopic measurements on the final device without any interfering effects, is an important advantage of the present method.

Abstract: Polyurethane-based solid-solid phase change materials were first synthesized using polyethylene glycol (PEG) and hexamethylene diisocyanate biuret (HDIB), and the influence of halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) on this system was investigated. HNTs can not only serve as crosslinking agent in synergy with HDIB, which reinforces the solid-solid phase change properties of the system that has no leakage even at the temperature that 40°C higher above the melting temperature of PEG, but also greatly improve the latent heat of the system from 86.8 to 118.7J/g, as a result of heterogeneous nucleation effect, which can make up partial latent heat loss caused by crosslinking. Also, HNTs endows the system with excellent thermal stability, where the temperature at 5% weight loss is increased by 53°C. The synthesized PCMs have extensive applying prospects in thermal energy storage fields.

Abstract: Aging is a complex biological process affecting almost all living organisms. Although its detrimental effects on animals' physiology have been extensively documented, several aspects of the biology of aging are insufficiently understood. Mitochondria, the central energy producers of the cell, play vital roles in a wide range of cellular processes, including regulation of bioenergetics, calcium signaling, metabolic responses, and cell death, among others. Thus, proper mitochondrial function is a prerequisite for the maintenance of cellular and organismal homeostasis. Several mitochondrial quality control mechanisms have evolved to allow adaptation to different metabolic conditions, thereby preserving cellular homeostasis and survival. A tight coordination between mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial selective autophagy, known as mitophagy, is a common characteristic of healthy biological systems. The balanced interplay between these two opposing cellular processes dictates stress resistance, healthspan, and lifespan extension. Mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy efficiency decline with age, leading to progressive accumulation of damaged and/or unwanted mitochondria, deterioration of cellular function, and ultimately death. Several regulatory factors that contribute to energy homeostasis have been implicated in the development and progression of many pathological conditions, such as neurodegenerative, metabolic, and cardiovascular disorders, among others. Therefore, mitophagy modulation may serve as a novel potential therapeutic approach to tackle age-associated pathologies. Here, we review the molecular signaling pathways that regulate and coordinate mitophagy with mitochondrial biogenesis, highlighting critical factors that hold promise for the development of pharmacological interventions toward enhancing human health and quality of life throughout aging.

Abstract: The interaction between light and wavelength-sized photonic nanostructure is highly promising for light management applied to thin-film photovoltaics (PVs). In this work, we put forward a practical wave-optical dielectric hemispheroidal nanostructure strategy under cost-effective anodic oxidation approach and substrate transfer method. By adjusting the oxidation voltage, periodic hemispheroidal nanostructure with diametral scale over 650nm was obtained. Due to their wavelength-scale dimension, enhanced diffraction behavior and guided resonance were identified through finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) simulation resulting in significant forward-scattering capabilities. The coherent optical performance was investigated experimentally and theoretically. To leverage the benefits of hemispheroidal nanostructure, amorphous silicon absorb layer and solar cell were fabricated. Compared with the planer structure, the developed hemispheroidal nanostructure could significantly improve the absorption of a-Si:H layer via light management with a 10.97% enhancement in the overall external quantum efficiency. Effective improvements in Voc and FF performances were also obtained in comparison to an etched AZO structure with high surface roughness. As the first demonstration, it was found that the hemispheroidal nanostructure by coating on the surface of a-Si:H thin film solar cells led to 7.79% and 7.38% enhancements respectively in overall energy conversion efficiency in comparison to the planar and the etched AZO structure.

We investigated the kinetics of 4-phenylpyridine N-methylation by nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) and its effect upon 4-phenylpyridine toxicity in vitro. Human recombinant NNMT possessed 4-phenylpyridine N-methyltransferase activity, with a specific activity of 1.7 ± 0.03 nmol MPP+ produced/h/mg NNMT. Although the Km for 4-phenylpyridine was similar to that reported for nicotinamide, its kcat of 9.3 × 10−5 ± 2 × 10−5 s−1 and specificity constant, kcat/Km, of 0.8 ± 0.8 s−1 M−1 were less than 0.15% of the respective values for nicotinamide, demonstrating that 4-phenylpyridine is a poor substrate for NNMT. At low (<2.5 mM) substrate concentration, 4-phenylpyridine N-methylation was competitively inhibited by dimethylsulphoxide, with a Ki of 34 ± 8 mM. At high (>2.5 mM) substrate concentration, enzyme activity followed substrate inhibition kinetics, with a Ki of 4 ± 1 mM. In silico molecular docking suggested that 4-phenylpyridine binds to the active site of NNMT in two non-redundant poses, one a substrate binding mode and the other an inhibitory mode. Finally, the expression of NNMT in the SH-SY5Y cell-line had no effect cell death, viability, ATP content or mitochondrial membrane potential. These data demonstrate that 4-phenylpyridine N-methylation by NNMT is unlikely to serve as a source of MPP+. The possibility for competitive inhibition by dimethylsulphoxide should be considered in NNMT-based drug discovery studies. The potential for 4-phenylpyridine to bind to the active site in two binding orientations using the same active site residues is a novel mechanism of substrate inhibition.

Abstract: We compare light induced degradation behaviours in lifetime samples and fully fabricated solar cells made from p-type boron-doped high performance multicrystalline silicon, p-type boron-doped mono-like silicon, n-type phosphorus-doped high performance multicrystalline silicon and p-type boron-doped Czochralski-grown silicon. Our results confirm that the degradation in multicrystalline silicon is triggered by the rapid cooling after the firing process. All cast-grown silicon samples subjected to fast cooling show lifetime reduction after light soaking. Interestingly, the degradation rate in n-type multicrystalline silicon is found to be orders of magnitude slower than in p-type multicrystalline silicon, suggesting that the defect formation mechanism could be affected by the positions of the quasi fermi levels.
