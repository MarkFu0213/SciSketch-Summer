Abstract: Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) store triglycerides (TGs) and retinyl ester (RE) in cytosolic lipid droplets. RE stores are degraded following retinoid starvation or in response to pathogenic stimuli resulting in HSC activation. At present, the major enzymes catalyzing lipid degradation in HSCs are unknown. In this study, we investigated whether adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) is involved in RE catabolism of HSCs. Additionally, we compared the effects of ATGL deficiency and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) deficiency, a known RE hydrolase (REH), on RE stores in liver and adipose tissue. We show that ATGL degrades RE even in the presence of TGs, implicating that these substrates compete for ATGL binding. REH activity was stimulated and inhibited by comparative gene identification-58 and G0/G1 switch gene-2, respectively, the physiological regulators of ATGL activity. In cultured primary murine HSCs, pharmacological inhibition of ATGL, but not HSL, increased RE accumulation. In mice globally lacking ATGL or HSL, RE contents in white adipose tissue were decreased or increased, respectively, while plasma retinol and liver RE levels remained unchanged. In conclusion, our study shows that ATGL acts as REH in HSCs promoting the degradation of RE stores in addition to its established function as TG lipase. HSL is the predominant REH in adipocytes but does not affect lipid mobilization in HSCs.

Abstract: Cardiolipin (CL) content accumulation leads to an increase in energy wasting in liver mitochondria in a rat model of cancer cachexia in which tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) is highly expressed. In this study we investigated the mechanisms involved in liver mitochondria CL accumulation in cancer cachexia and examined if TNFα was involved in this process leading to mitochondrial bioenergetics alterations. We studied gene, protein expression and activity of the main enzymes involved in CL metabolism in liver mitochondria from a rat model of cancer cachexia and in HepaRG hepatocyte-like cells exposed to 20ng/ml of TNFα for 12h. Phosphatidylglycerolphosphate synthase (PGPS) gene expression was increased 2.3-fold (p<0.02) and cardiolipin synthase (CLS) activity decreased 44% (p<0.03) in cachectic rat livers compared to controls. CL remodeling enzymes monolysocardiolipin acyltransferase (MLCL AT-1) activity and tafazzin (TAZ) gene expression were increased 30% (p<0.01) and 50% (p<0.02), respectively, in cachectic rat livers compared to controls. Incubation of hepatocytes with TNFα increased CL content 15% (p<0.05), mitochondrial oxygen consumption 33% (p<0.05), PGPS gene expression 44% (p<0.05) and MLCL AT-1 activity 20% (p<0.05) compared to controls. These above findings strongly suggest that in cancer cachexia, TNFα induces a higher energy wasting in liver mitochondria by increasing CL content via upregulation of PGPS expression.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells are potent candidates in stroke therapy due to their ability to secrete protective anti-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors. We investigated the neuroprotective effects of human placental mesenchymal-like adherent stromal cells (PLX) using an established ischemic model of nerve growth factor (NGF)-differentiated pheochromocytoma PC12 cells exposed to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by reperfusion. Under optimal conditions, 2×105 PLX cells, added in a trans-well system, conferred 30–60% neuroprotection to PC12 cells subjected to ischemic insult. PC12 cell death, measured by LDH release, was reduced by PLX cells or by conditioned medium derived from PLX cells exposed to ischemia, suggesting the active release of factorial components. Since neuroprotection is a prominent function of the cytokine IL-6 and the angiogenic factor VEGF165, we measured their secretion using selective ELISA of the cells under ischemic or normoxic conditions. IL-6 and VEGF165 secretion by co-culture of PC12 and PLX cells was significantly higher under ischemic compared to normoxic conditions. Exogenous supplementation of 10ng/ml each of IL-6 and VEGF165 to insulted PC12 cells conferred neuroprotection, reminiscent of the neuroprotective effect of PLX cells or their conditioned medium. Growth factors as well as co-culture conditioned medium effects were reduced by 70% and 20% upon pretreatment with 240ng/ml Semaxanib (anti VEGF165) and/or 400ng/ml neutralizing anti IL-6 antibody, respectively. Therefore, PLX-induced neuroprotection in ischemic PC12 cells may be partially explained by IL-6 and VEGF165 secretion. These findings may also account for the therapeutic effects seen in clinical trials after treatment with these cells.

Abstract: Within the concept of integrin growth factor receptor (GFR) cross-talk, little is known about the effects of GFRs on focal adhesions (FAs). Therefore, we tested the hypothesis whether EGF can modulate constituents of FAs and subsequent down-stream events. To this end, EGF-treated keratinocytes were subjected to combined fluorescence imaging and western blotting, to quantify expression and/or activation of molecules, involved in integrin GFR cross-talk, and receptor proximal and distal signaling events. Generally, EGF response revealed an amplified redistribution or activation of molecules under study, which will be explained in detail from the plasma membrane to the cell interior. In addition to significant activation of EGF receptor (EGFR) at tyrosine Tyr845, a remarkable redistribution was detectable for the focal adhesion constituents, integrin ß1 and ß3, and zyxin. Increased activation also applied to focal adhesion kinase (FAK) by phosphorylation at Tyr397, Tyr576, and Src at Tyr418, while total FAK remained unchanged. Risen activity was seen as well for the analyzed distal down-stream events, p190RhoGAP and MAP kinases p42/44. Intriguingly, Src-specific inhibitor Herbimycin A abrogated the entire EGF response except FAK Tyr397 phosphorylation, independent of EGF presence. Mechanistically, our results show that EGF modulates adhesion in a dual fashion, by firstly redistributing focal adhesion constituents to adhesion sites, but also by amplifying levels of activated RhoA antagonist p190RhoGAP, important for cell motility. Further, the findings suggest that the observed EGF response underlies an EGFR integrin cross-talk under recruitment of receptor proximal FAK and Src, and MAP kinase and p190RhoGAP as receptor distal events.

Abstract: We investigated whether a highly purified eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and a concentrated n-3 fatty acid formulation (prescription TAK-085) containing EPA and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) ethyl ester could improve the learning ability of aged rats and whether this specific outcome had any relation with the brain levels of EPA-derived eicosanoids and DHA-derived docosanoids. The rats were tested for reference memory errors (RMEs) and working memory errors (WMEs) in an eight-arm radial maze. Fatty acid compositions were analyzed by GC, whereas brain eicosanoid/docosanoids were measured by LC–ESI-MS–MS-based analysis. The levels of lipid peroxides (LPOs) were measured by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances. The administration of TAK-085 at 300mg·kg−1day−1 for 17weeks reduced the number of RMEs in aged rats compared with that in the control rats. Both TAK-085 and EPA administration increased plasma EPA and DHA levels in aged rats, with concurrent increases in DHA and decreases in arachidonic acid in the corticohippocampal brain tissues. TAK-085 administration significantly increased the formation of EPA-derived 5-HETE and DHA-derived 7-, 10-, and 17-HDoHE, PD1, RvD1, and RvD2. ARA-derived PGE2, PGD2, and PGF2α significantly decreased in TAK-085-treated rats. DHA-derived mediators demonstrated a significantly negative correlation with the number of RMEs, whereas EPA-derived mediators did not exhibit any relationship. Furthermore, compared with the control rats, the levels of LPO in the plasma, cerebral cortex, and hippocampus were significantly reduced in TAK-085-treated rats. The findings of the present study suggest that long-term EPA+DHA administration may be a possible preventative strategy against age-related cognitive decline.

Abstract: Understanding the processes of mitochondrial dynamics (fission, fusion, biogenesis, and mitophagy) has been hampered by the lack of automated, deterministic methods to measure mitochondrial morphology from microscopic images. A method to quantify mitochondrial morphology and function is presented here using a commercially available automated high-content wide-field fluorescent microscopy platform and R programming-language-based semi-automated data analysis to achieve high throughput morphological categorization (puncta, rod, network, and large & round) and quantification of mitochondrial membrane potential. In conjunction with cellular respirometry to measure mitochondrial respiratory capacity, this method detected that increasing concentrations of toxicants known to directly or indirectly affect mitochondria (t-butyl hydroperoxide [TBHP], rotenone, antimycin A, oligomycin, ouabain, and carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone [FCCP]), decreased mitochondrial networked areas in cultured 661w cells to 0.60–0.80 at concentrations that inhibited respiratory capacity to 0.20–0.70 (fold change compared to vehicle). Concomitantly, mitochondrial swelling was increased from 1.4- to 2.3-fold of vehicle as indicated by changes in large & round areas in response to TBHP, oligomycin, or ouabain. Finally, the automated identification of mitochondrial location enabled accurate quantification of mitochondrial membrane potential by measuring intramitochondrial tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) fluorescence intensity. Administration of FCCP depolarized and administration of oligomycin hyperpolarized mitochondria, as evidenced by changes in intramitochondrial TMRM fluorescence intensities to 0.33- or 5.25-fold of vehicle control values, respectively. In summary, this high-content imaging method accurately quantified mitochondrial morphology and membrane potential in hundreds of thousands of cells on a per-cell basis, with sufficient throughput for pharmacological or toxicological evaluation.

Abstract: Tumor invasion and metastasis are key aspects of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). During migration, cells undergo mechanical alterations. The mechanical phenotype of breast cancer cells is correlated with aromatase gene expression. We have previously shown that targeting aromatase is a promising strategy for NSCLC. The aim of this study was to examine morphological and mechanical changes of NSCLC cells, upon treatment with aromatase inhibitor and correlate their ability to migrate and invade. In vitro experiments were performed using H23 and A549 NSCLC cell lines and exemestane was used for aromatase inhibition. We demonstrated that exemestane reduced H23 cell migration and invasion and caused changes in cell morphology including increased vacuolar structures and greater pleomorphism. In addition, exemestane changed the distribution of α-tubulin in H23 and A549 cells in a way that might destabilize microtubules polymerization. These effects were associated with increased cell viscosity and decreased elastic shear modulus. Although exemestane caused similar effects in A549 cells regarding viscosity and elastic shear modulus, it did not affect A549 cell migration and caused an increase in invasion. The increased invasion was in line with vimentin perinuclear localization. Our data show that the treatment of NSCLC cells with an aromatase inhibitor not only affects cell migration and invasion but also alters the mechanical properties of the cells. It suggests that the different origin of cancer cells is associated with different morphological characteristics and mechanical behavior.

Abstract: As the second most prevalent hematologic malignancy, multiple myeloma (MM) remains incurable and relapses due to intrinsic or acquired drug resistance. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies that target molecular mechanisms responsible for drug resistance are attractive. Interactions of tumor cells with their surrounding microenvironment impact tumor initiation, progression and metastasis, as well as patient prognosis. This cross-talk is bidirectional. Tumor cells can also attract or activate tumor-associated stromal cells by releasing cytokines to facilitate their growth, invasion and metastasis. The effect of myeloma cells on bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) has not been well studied. In our study, we found that higher stiffness of BMSCs was not a unique characteristic of BMSCs from MM patients (M-BMSCs). BMSCs from MGUS (monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance) patients were also stiffer than the BMSCs from healthy volunteers (N-BMSCs). The stiffness of M-BMSCs was enhanced when cocultured with myeloma cells. In contrast, no changes were seen in myeloma cell-primed MGUS- and N-BMSCs. Interestingly, our data indicated that CD138− myeloma cells, but not CD138+ cells, regulated M-BMSC stiffness. SDF-1 was highly expressed in the CD138− myeloma subpopulation compared with that in CD138+ cells. Inhibition of SDF-1 using AMD3100 or knocking-down CXCR4 in M-BMSCs blocked CD138− myeloma cells-induced increase in M-BMSC stiffness, suggesting a crucial role of SDF-1/CXCR4. AKT inhibition attenuated SDF-1-induced increases in M-BMSC stiffness. These findings demonstrate, for the first time, CD138− myeloma cell-directed cross-talk with BMSCs and reveal that CD138− myeloma cells regulate M-BMSC stiffness through SDF-1/CXCR4/AKT signaling.

Abstract: Profiling of oxylipins from young maize roots revealed complex patterns of products mainly originating from the combined actions of 9- and 13-lipoxygenases and allene oxide synthase (AOS). A distinctive feature was the high content of the cyclopentenone 10-oxo-11-phytoenoic acid (10-oxo-PEA). Incubations with [1-14C]linoleic acid led to the formation of the α-ketols 13-hydroxy-12-oxo-9-octadecenoic acid and 9-hydroxy-10-oxo-12-octadecenoic acid as well as the cyclopentenones 12-oxo-10-phytoenoic acid (12-oxo-PEA) and 10-oxo-PEA in a ratio of 10:2:1:3. Chiral phase radio-HPLC showed that the labeled 10-oxo-PEA was mainly (93%) due to the 9S,13S-enantiomer, whereas 12-oxo-PEA was racemic. Recombinant maize AOS CYP74A19 (ZmAOS2) converted linoleic acid 9(S)-hydroperoxide (9-HPOD) into an allene oxide, 9,10-epoxy-10,12-octadecadienoic acid (9,10-EOD), which did not undergo cyclization but was solely hydrolyzed into the α-ketol. A cyclase activity promoting the conversion of 9,10-EOD into (9S,13S)-10-oxo-PEA was detected in the 105×g supernatant prepared by differential centrifugation of the maize root homogenate. The data obtained suggested the existence of a new type of allene oxide cyclase, which is active towards an allene oxide formed from a 9-lipoxygenase-derived hydroperoxide.

Abstract: In the present paper we have performed comparative lipidomic analysis of two prototypic atherogenic LDL modifications, oxidized LDL and enzymatically modified LDL. Oxidization of LDL was carried out with different chemical modifications starting from the same native LDL preparations: (i) by copper oxidation leading to terminally oxidized LDL (oxLDL), (ii) by moderate oxidization with HOCl (HOCl LDL), (iii) by long term storage of LDL at 4°C to produce minimally modified LDL (mmLDL), or (iv) by 15-lipoxygenase, produced by a transfected fibroblast cell line (LipoxLDL). The enzymatic modification of LDL was performed by treatment of native LDL with trypsin and cholesteryl esterase (eLDL). Free cholesterol (FC) and cholesteryl esters (CE) represent the predominant lipid classes in all LDL preparations. In contrast to native LDL, which contains about two-thirds of total cholesterol as CE, enzymatic modification of LDL decreased the proportion of CE to about one-third. Free cholesterol and CE in oxLDL are reduced by their conversion to oxysterols. Oxidization of LDL preferentially influences the content of polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholine (PC) and polyunsaturated plasmalogen species, by reducing the total PC fraction in oxLDL. Concomitantly, a strong rise of the lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) fraction can be found in oxLDL as compared to native LDL. This effect is less pronounced in eLDL. The mild oxidation of LDL with hypochlorite and/or lipoxygenase does not alter the content of the analyzed lipid classes and species in a significant manner. The lipidomic characterization of modified LDLs contributes to the better understanding their diverse cellular effects.

Abstract: Yarrowia lipolytica is a lipolytic yeast possessing 16 paralog genes coding for lipases. Little information on these lipases has been obtained and only the major secreted lipase, namely YLLIP2, had been biochemically and structurally characterized. Another secreted lipase, YLLIP8, was isolated from Y. lipolytica culture medium and compared with the recombinant enzyme produced in Pichia pastoris. N-terminal sequencing showed that YLLIP8 is produced in its active form after the cleavage of a signal peptide. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that YLLIP8 recovered from culture medium lacks a C-terminal part of 33 amino acids which are present in the coding sequence. A 3D model of YLLIP8 built from the X-ray structure of the homologous YLLIP2 lipase shows that these truncated amino acids in YLLIP8 belong to an additional C-terminal region predicted to be mainly helical. Western blot analysis shows that YLLIP8 C-tail is rapidly cleaved upon enzyme secretion since both cell-bound and culture supernatant lipases lack this extension. Mature recombinant YLLIP8 displays a true lipase activity on short-, medium- and long-chain triacylglycerols (TAG), with an optimum activity at alkaline pH on medium chain TAG. It has no apparent regioselectivity in TAG hydrolysis, thus generating glycerol and FFAs as final lipolysis products. YLLIP8 properties are distinct from those of the 1,3-regioselective YLLIP2, acting optimally at acidic pH. These lipases are tailored for complementary roles in fatty acid uptake by Y. lipolytica.

Abstract: Mice lacking phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT, Pemt−/− mice) are resistant to high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity (DIO) but develop non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. PEMT expression is strongly induced during differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Hence, we hypothesized that white adipose tissue (WAT) might be a key player in the protection against DIO in Pemt−/− mice. We fed Pemt−/− and Pemt+/+ mice the HFD for 2weeks, after which we examined adipocyte differentiation, adipogenesis and lipolysis in WAT. Pemt−/− mice gained less body weight, had reduced WAT mass and had smaller adipocytes than Pemt+/+ mice. The protein levels of adipose differentiation markers FABP4, PPARγ and C/EBPβ were not altered by genotype, but acetyl-CoA carboxylase expression and activation was reduced in the Pemt−/− mice. The in vivo conversion of [14C]acetate to [14C]TG in WAT was also lower in Pemt−/− mice. The release of glycerol from WAT explants was comparable between Pemt+/+ and Pemt−/− mice under basal condition and in the presence of isoproterenol, indicating unaffected lipolytic capacity. Furthermore, the amounts of leptin, cytokines and chemokines in WAT were not altered by genotype in mice fed the HFD for 2weeks. However, after 10weeks of HFD, WAT from Pemt−/− mice had dramatically lower leptin, inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 and TNF-α) and chemokines (MCP-1 and RANTES), and significantly higher anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 than Pemt+/+ mice. Together, our data show that PEMT deficiency did not affect the capability for differentiation and lipolysis in WAT. Decreased lipogenesis in WAT may contribute to the resistance to DIO in Pemt−/− mice.

Abstract: Mitogen-inducible gene 6 (MIG6) is a tumor suppressor implicated in the development of human cancers; however, the regulatory mechanisms of MIG6 remain unknown. Here, using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified DnaJ homolog subfamily B member I (DNAJB1) as a novel MIG6-interacting protein. We found that DNAJB1 binds to and decreases MIG6 protein, but not mRNA, levels. DNAJB1 overexpression dosage-dependently decreased MIG6 protein levels. Conversely, DNAJB1 knockdown increased MIG6 protein levels. DNAJB1 destabilizes MIG6 by enhancing K48-linked ubiquitination of MIG6. However, knocking-down of DNAJB1 reduced the ubiquitination of MIG6. DNAJB1 positively regulates the epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) signaling pathway via destabilization of MIG6; however, DNAJB1 knockdown diminishes activation of EGFR signaling as well as elevation of MIG6. Importantly, the increased levels of MIG6 by DNAJB1 knockdown greatly enhanced the gefitinib sensitivity in A549 cells. Thus, our study provides a new molecular mechanism to regulate EGFR signaling through modulation of MIG6 by DNAJB1 as a negative regulator.

Abstract: HIF-1α is degraded by oxygen-dependent mechanisms but stabilized in hypoxia to form transcriptional complex HIF-1, which transactivates genes promoting cancer hallmarks. However, how HIF-1α is specifically regulated in hypoxia is poorly understood. Here, we report that the histone methyltransferase SET9 promotes HIF-1α protein stability in hypoxia and enhances HIF-1 mediated glycolytic gene transcription, thereby playing an important role in mediating cancer cell adaptation and survival to hypoxic stress. Specifically, SET9 interacts with HIF-1α and promotes HIF-1α protein stability in hypoxia. Silencing SET9 by siRNA reduces HIF-1α protein stability in hypoxia, and attenuates the hypoxic induction of HIF-1 target genes mediating hypoxic glycolysis. Mechanistically, we find that SET9 is enriched at the hypoxia response elements (HRE) within promoters of the HIF-1-responsive glycolytic genes. Silencing SET9 reduces HIF-1α levels at these HREs in hypoxia, thereby attenuating HIF-1-mediated gene transcription. Further, silencing SET9 by siRNA reduces hypoxia-induced glycolysis and inhibits cell viability of hypoxic cancer cells. Our findings suggest that SET9 enriches at HRE sites of HIF-1 responsive glycolytic genes and stabilizes HIF-1α at these sites in hypoxia, thus establishes an epigenetic mechanism of the metabolic adaptation in hypoxic cancer cells.

Abstract: FGFRL1 is a single-pass transmembrane protein with three extracellular Ig domains. When overexpressed in CHO cells or related cell types, it induces cell–cell fusion and formation of large, multinucleated syncytia. For this fusion-promoting activity, only the membrane-proximal Ig domain (Ig3) and the transmembrane domain are required. It does not matter whether the transmembrane domain is derived from FGFRL1 or from another receptor, but the distance of the Ig3 domain to the membrane is crucial. Fusion can be inhibited with soluble recombinant proteins comprising the Ig1–Ig2–Ig3 or the Ig2–Ig3 domains as well as with monoclonal antibodies directed against Ig3. Mutational analysis reveals a hydrophobic site in Ig3 that is required for fusion. If a single amino acid from this site is mutated, fusion is abolished. The site is located on a β-sheet, which is part of a larger β-barrel, as predicted by computer modeling of the 3D structure of FGFRL1. It is possible that this site interacts with a target protein of neighboring cells to trigger cell–cell fusion.

Abstract: Insulin resistance is characterized as a pathogenic factor in type 2 diabetes. Despite skeletal muscle being primarily responsible for systemic glucose disposal, the mechanisms underlying the induction of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle have not been fully elucidated. A number of studies have shown that it is characterized by the inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase signaling pathway. Here, we show that skeletal muscle- and kidney-enriched inositol polyphosphate phosphatase (SKIP), a phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) phosphatase, and glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) are implicated in the inhibition of insulin-dependent PI 3-kinase signaling in skeletal muscle. Mechanistically, under resting conditions, SKIP forms a complex with GRP78 at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Insulin stimulation facilitates the dissociation of SKIP from GRP78 and its binding to the activated form of Pak1. GRP78 is necessary for membrane localization and Pak1-binding of SKIP, which facilitates inactivation of the insulin signaling pathway. These findings underscore the specific and prominent role of SKIP and GRP78 in the regulation of insulin-dependent PI 3-kinase signaling in skeletal muscle.

Abstract: Myeloid leukemia cells maintain a high intracellular ROS level and use redox signals for survival. The metabolism of ROS also affects cell fate, including cell death and differentiation. Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are major antioxidant enzymes that have high levels of expression in myeloid leukemia cells. However, the role of SODs in the regulation of myeloid leukemia cells' biological function is still unclear. To investigate the function of SODs in myeloid leukemia cell death and differentiation, we used myeloid leukemia cell lines K562, MEG-01, TF-1, and HEL cells for this study. We found that PMA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation in myeloid leukemia cells is accompanied by cell death and SOD1 down-regulation, while SOD2 expression is not affected. The role of SOD1 is verified when ATN-224, a SOD1 specific inhibitor, inhibits cell proliferation and promotes cell death in myeloid leukemia cells without PMA treatment. Moreover, inhibition or silencing of SODs further increases cell death and decreases polyploidization induced by PMA while they were partially reversed by SOD1 overexpression. Thus, SOD1 expression is required for myeloid leukemia cell fate determination. In addition, the knockdown of PKD2 reduces cell death and promotes polyploidization induced by PMA. PMA/PKD2-mediated necrosis via PARP cleavage involves both SOD1-dependent and -independent pathways. Finally, ATN-224 enhanced the inhibition of cell proliferation by Ara-C. Taken together, the results demonstrate that SOD1 regulates cell death and differentiation in myeloid leukemia cells. ATN-224 may be beneficial for myeloid leukemia therapy.

Abstract: Histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) is a critical negative regulator for chondrocyte hypertrophy by binding to and inhibiting Runx2, a critical transcription factor for chondrocyte hypertrophy. It is unclear how HDAC4 expression and stability are regulated during growth plate development. We report here that inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 by dominant negative p38 or p38 inhibitor prevents HDAC4 degradation. Mutation of a potential caspase-2 and 3 cleavage site Asp289 stabilizes HDAC4 in chondrocytes. In contrast, constitutively active MAPK kinase 6 (constitutive activator of p38) transgenic mice exhibit decreased HDAC4 content in vivo. We also observed that p38 stimulates caspase-3 activity in chondrocytes. Inhibition of p38 or caspases reduced HDAC4 degradation. HDAC4 inhibited Runx2 promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner and caspase inhibitors further enhanced this inhibition by preventing HDAC4 degradation. Overall, these results demonstrate that p38 promotes HDAC4 degradation by increasing caspase-mediated cleavage, which releases Runx2 from a repressive influence of HDAC4 and promotes the chondrocyte hypertrophy and bone formation.

Abstract: QRFP (RFamide) peptides are neuropeptides involved in food intake and adiposity regulation in rodents. We have previously shown that QRFP-43 (43RFa) and QRFP-26 (26RFa) inhibited isoproterenol (ISO)-induced lipolysis in adipocytes. However, the antilipolytic signaling pathways activated by QRFP peptides have not been investigated. In the present study, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were used to identify the main pathways involved in QRFP-43 decreasing ISO-induced lipolysis. Our results show that QRFP-43 reduced ISO-induced phosphorylation of perilipin A (PLIN) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) on Ser660 by 43 and 25%, respectively, but increased Akt phosphorylation by 44%. However, the inhibition of phosphodiesterase 3B (PDE3B), a regulator of lipolysis activated by Akt, did not reverse the antilipolytic effect of QRFP-43. PDE3B inhibition reversed the decrease of Ser660 HSL phosphorylation associated with QRFP-43 antilipolytic effect. QRFP-43 also prevented PKC activation and ISO-induced Src kinases activation leading to the inhibition of the caveolin-1 (CAV-1) translocation on lipid droplets. Indeed, QRFP-43 attenuated phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced lipolysis and ISO-induced extracellular signal-regulated and Src kinases by 28, 37 and 48%, respectively. The attenuation of ISO-induced lipolysis by QRFP-43 was associated with a decrease of phosphorylated Ser660 HSL, PKA-catalytic (PKA-c) subunit and CAV-1 translocation on lipid droplets by 37, 50 and 46%, respectively. The decrease in ISO-induced CAV-1 and PKA-c translocation was associated with a reduction of PLIN phosphorylation by 44% in QRFP-43-treated adipocytes. These results suggest that QRFP-43 attenuated ISO-induced lipolysis by preventing the formation of an active complex on lipid droplets and the activation of Src kinases and PKC.

Abstract: A decrease in skeletal muscle lipolysis and hormone sensitive-lipase (HSL) expression has been linked to insulin resistance in obesity. The purpose of this study was to identify potential intrinsic defects in lipid turnover and lipolysis in myotubes established from obese and type 2 diabetic subjects. Lipid trafficking and lipolysis were measured by pulse-chase assay with radiolabeled substrates in myotubes from non-obese/non-diabetic (lean), obese/non-diabetic (obese) and obese/diabetic (T2D) subjects. Lipolytic protein content and level of Akt phosphorylation were measured by Western blot. HSL was overexpressed by adenovirus-mediated gene delivery. Myotubes established from obese and T2D subjects had lower lipolysis (−30–40%) when compared to lean, using oleic acid as precursor. Similar observations were also seen for labelled glycerol. Incorporation of oleic acid into diacylglycerol (DAG) and free fatty acid (FFA) level was lower in T2D myotubes, and acetate incorporation into FFA and complex lipids was also lower in obese and/or T2D subjects. Both protein expression of HSL (but not ATGL) and changes in DAG during lipolysis were markedly lower in cells from obese and T2D when compared to lean subjects. Insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis (−60%) and Akt phosphorylation (−90%) were lower in myotubes from T2D, however, overexpression of HSL in T2D myotubes did not rescue the diabetic phenotype. In conclusion, intrinsic defects in lipolysis and HSL expression co-exist with reduced insulin action in myotubes from obese T2D subjects. Despite reductions in intramyocellular lipolysis and HSL expression, overexpression of HSL did not rescue defects in insulin action in skeletal myotubes from obese T2D subjects.

Abstract: The mevalonate pathway is tightly linked to cell division. Mevalonate derived non-sterol isoprenoids and cholesterol are essential for cell cycle progression and mitosis completion respectively. In the present work, we studied the effects of fluoromevalonate, a competitive inhibitor of mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase, on cell proliferation and cell cycle progression in both HL-60 and MOLT-4 cells. This enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of isopentenyl diphosphate, the first isoprenoid in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, consuming ATP at the same time. Inhibition of mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase was followed by a rapid accumulation of mevalonate diphosphate and the reduction of ATP concentrations, while the cell content of cholesterol was barely affected. Strikingly, mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase inhibition also resulted in the depletion of dNTP pools, which has never been reported before. These effects were accompanied by inhibition of cell proliferation and cell cycle arrest at S phase, together with the appearance of γ-H2AX foci and Chk1 activation. Inhibition of Chk1 in cells treated with fluoromevalonate resulted in premature entry into mitosis and massive cell death, indicating that the inhibition of mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase triggered a DNA damage response. Notably, the supply of exogenously deoxyribonucleosides abolished γ-H2AX formation and prevented the effects of mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase inhibition on DNA replication and cell growth. The results indicate that dNTP pool depletion caused by mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase inhibition hampered DNA replication with subsequent DNA damage, which may have important consequences for replication stress and genomic instability.

Abstract: α-Methylacyl-CoA racemase (Amacr) catalyzes the racemization of the 25-methyl group in C27-intermediates in bile acid synthesis and in methyl-branched fatty acids such as pristanic acid, a metabolite derived from phytol. Consequently, patients with Amacr deficiency accumulate C27-bile acid intermediates, pristanic and phytanic acid and display sensorimotor neuropathy, seizures and relapsing encephalopathy. In contrast to humans, Amacr-deficient mice are clinically symptomless on a standard laboratory diet, but failed to thrive when fed phytol-enriched chow. In this study, the effect and the mechanisms behind the development of the phytol-feeding associated disease state in Amacr-deficient mice were investigated. All Amacr−/− mice died within 36weeks on a phytol diet, while wild-type mice survived. Liver failure was the main cause of death accompanied by kidney and brain abnormalities. Histological analysis of liver showed inflammation, fibrotic and necrotic changes, Kupffer cell proliferation and fatty changes in hepatocytes, and serum analysis confirmed the hepatic disease. Pristanic and phytanic acids accumulated in livers of Amacr−/− mice after a phytol diet. Microarray analysis also revealed changes in the expression levels of numerous genes in wild-type mouse livers after two weeks of the phytol diet compared to a control diet. This indicates that detoxification of phytol metabolites in liver is accompanied by activation of multiple pathways at the molecular level and Amacr−/− mice are not able to respond adequately. Phytol causes primary failure in liver leading to death of Amacr−/− mice thus emphasizing the indispensable role of Amacr in detoxification of α-methyl-branched fatty acids.

Abstract: The dysfunction of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) influenced by flow shear stress is crucial for vascular remodeling. However, the roles of nuclear envelope (NE) proteins in shear stress-induced EC dysfunction are still unknown. Our results indicated that, compared with normal shear stress (NSS), low shear stress (LowSS) suppressed the expression of two types of NE proteins, Nesprin2 and LaminA, and increased the proliferation and apoptosis of ECs. Targeted small interfering RNA (siRNA) and gene overexpression plasmid transfection revealed that Nesprin2 and LaminA participate in the regulation of EC proliferation and apoptosis. A protein/DNA array was further used to detect the activation of transcription factors in ECs following transfection with target siRNAs and overexpression plasmids. The regulation of AP-2 and TFIID mediated by Nesprin2 and the activation of Stat-1, Stat-3, Stat-5 and Stat-6 by LaminA were verified under shear stress. Furthermore, using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software and real-time RT-PCR, the effects of Nesprin2 or LaminA on the downstream target genes of AP-2, TFIID, and Stat-1, Stat-3, Stat-5 and Stat-6, respectively, were investigated under LowSS. Our study has revealed that NE proteins are novel mechano-sensitive molecules in ECs. LowSS suppresses the expression of Nesprin2 and LaminA, which may subsequently modulate the activation of important transcription factors and eventually lead to EC dysfunction.

Abstract: GSK3β binding of GSKIP affects neurite outgrowth, but the physiological significance of PKA binding to GSKIP remains to be determined. We hypothesized that GSKIP and GSK3β mediate cAMP/PKA/Drp1 axis signaling and modulate mitochondrial morphology by forming a working complex comprising PKA/GSKIP/GSK3β/Drp1. We demonstrated that GSKIP wild-type overexpression increased phosphorylation of Drp1 S637 by 7–8-fold compared to PKA kinase-inactive mutants (V41/L45) and a GSK3β binding-defective mutant (L130) under H2O2 and forskolin challenge in HEK293 cells, indicating that not only V41/L45, but also L130 may be involved in Drp1-associated protection of GSKIP. Interestingly, silencing either GSKIP or GSK3β but not GSK3α resulted in a dramatic decrease in Drp1 S637 phosphorylation, revealing that both GSKIP and GSK3β are required in this novel PKA/GSKIP/GSK3β/Drp1 complex. Moreover, overexpressed kinase-dead GSK3β–K85R, which retains the capacity to bind GSKIP, but not K85M which shows total loss of GSKIP-binding, has a higher Drp1 S637 phosphorylation similar to the GSKIP wt overexpression group, indicating that GSK3β recruits Drp1 by anchoring rather than in a kinase role. With further overexpression of either V41/L45P or the L130P GSKIP mutant, the elongated mitochondrial phenotype was lost; however, ectopically expressed Drp1 S637D, a phosphomimetic mutant, but not S637A, a non-phosphorylated mutant, restored the elongated mitochondrial morphology, indicating that Drp1 is a downstream effector of direct PKA signaling and possibly has an indirect GSKIP function involved in the cAMP/PKA/Drp1 signaling axis. Collectively, our data revealed that both GSKIP and GSK3β function as anchoring proteins in the cAMP/PKA/Drp1 signaling axis modulating Drp1 phosphorylation.

Abstract: Cell–tissue–tissue interaction is determined by specific short range forces between cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) and ligands of the tissue, long range repulsion forces mediated by cell surface grafted macromolecules and adhesion-induced elastic stresses in the cell envelope. This interplay of forces triggers the rapid random clustering of tightly coupled linkers. By coupling of actin gel patches to the intracellular domains of the CAMs, these clusters can grow in a secondary process resulting in the formation of functional adhesion microdomains (ADs). The ADs can act as biochemical steering centers by recruiting and activating functional proteins, such as GTPases and associated regulating proteins, through electrostatic–hydrophobic forces with cationic lipid domains that act as attractive centers. First, I summarize physical concepts of cell adhesion revealed by studies of biomimetic systems. Then I describe the role of the adhesion domains as biochemical signaling platforms and force transmission centers promoting cellular protrusions, in terms of a shell string model of cells. Protrusion forces are generated by actin gelation triggered by molecular machines (focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Src-kinases and associated adaptors) which assemble around newly formed integrin clusters. They recruit and activate the GTPases Rac-1 and actin gelation promoters to charged membrane domains via electrostatic–hydrophobic forces. The cell front is pushed forward in a cyclic and stepwise manner and the step-width is determined by the dynamics antagonistic interplay between Rac-1 and RhoA. The global cell polarization in the direction of motion is mediated by the actin–microtubule (MT) crosstalk at adhesion domains. Supramolecular actin–MT assemblies at the front help to promote actin polymerization. At the rear they regulate the dismantling of the ADs through the Ca++-mediated activation of the protease calpain and trigger their disruption by RhoA mediated contraction via stress fibers. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Mechanobiology.

Abstract: The details of the interaction between G-proteins and the GPCRs have been subjected to extensive investigation with structural and functional assays, but still many fundamental questions regarding this macromolecular assembly and its mechanism remain unanswered. In the context of current structural data we investigated interactions of dopamine D1 receptor with cognate G-proteins (Gαs) in living cells, emphasizing the prevalence of preassembled D1-G-protein complexes. We also tested the effect of D1 receptor presence on the dynamics of Gαs and Gαi3 in the cellular plasma membrane. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) detected by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) or fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) microscopy, we did not detect constitutive preassociated complex between D1 receptor and G-protein in the absence of receptor activation. Our work suggests that D1 receptor alters the distribution of Gαs and Gαi3 subunits inside the membrane. We also find that non-activated D1 receptor and Gαs or Gαi3 are present in the cell membrane within the same membrane microdomains in the proximity of about 9–10nm.

Abstract: Lipid droplets (LDs) are functional subcellular organelles involved in multiple intracellular processes. LDs are found in nearly all types of eukaryotic cells, but their properties are highly variable in different types of tissues. Steroidogenic cells synthesize steroid hormones de novo from the cholesterol deposited in cytosolic LDs. However, the roles of LD proteins in steroidogenesis under pituitary hormone stimulation have not been well elucidated. The protein profile of isolated LDs from the mouse Leydig tumor cell line MLTC-1 was distinct from that of hepatic cells or macrophages. By proteomic analysis of the components using mass spectrometry, two enzymes for steroidogenesis, 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (3βHSD1) and 17 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 11 (17βHSD11), were identified in two strong bands in the LD fractions. The LD fraction of MLTC-1 cells also included CYP11A1 and CYP17, suggesting that the LDs contain all the enzymes needed for testosterone synthesis. The steroidogenesis in Leydig cells is activated by luteinizing hormone through a PKA-dependent pathway. Stimulation of MLTC-1 cells with luteinizing hormone or 8-bromo-cAMP caused drastic changes in the morphology of the LDs in the MLTC-1 cells. Upon stimulation, large perinuclear LDs are turned into much smaller LDs and dispersed throughout the cytosol. These results raise the possibility that LDs are involved in a regulatory pathway of steroidogenesis, not just by serving as a storage depot for cholesterol esters, but also by providing enzymes and generating sites for enzymatic activity.

Abstract: The syntrophins alpha (SNTA) and beta 2 (SNTB2) are molecular adaptor proteins shown to stabilize ABCA1, an essential regulator of HDL cholesterol. Furthermore, SNTB2 is involved in glucose stimulated insulin release. Hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia are characteristic features of the metabolic syndrome, a serious public health problem with rising prevalence. Therefore, it is important to understand the role of the syntrophins herein. Mice deficient for both syntrophins (SNTA/B2−/−) have normal insulin and glucose tolerance, hepatic ABCA1 protein and cholesterol. When challenged with a HFD, wild type and SNTA/B2−/− mice have similar weight gain, adiposity, serum and liver triglycerides. Hepatic ABCA1, serum insulin and insulin sensitivity are normal while glucose tolerance is impaired. Liver cholesterol is reduced, and expression of SREBP2 and HMG-CoA-R is increased in the knockout mice. Scavenger receptor-BI (SR-BI) protein is strongly diminished in the liver of SNTA/B2−/− mice while SR-BI binding protein NHERF1 is not changed and PDZK1 is even induced. Knock-down of SNTA, SNTB2 or both has no effect on hepatocyte SR-BI and PDZK1 proteins. Further, SR-BI levels are not reduced in brown adipose tissue of SNTA/B2−/− mice excluding that syntrophins directly stabilize SR-BI. SR-BI stability is regulated by MAPK and phosphorylated ERK2 is induced in the liver of the knock-out mice. Blockage of ERK activity upregulates hepatocyte SR-BI showing that increased MAPK activity contributes to low SR-BI. Sphingomyelin which is well described to regulate cholesterol metabolism is reduced in the liver and serum of the knock-out mice while the size of serum lipoproteins is not affected. Current data exclude a major function of these syntrophins in ABCA1 activity and insulin release but suggest a role in regulating glucose uptake, ERK and SR-BI levels, and sphingomyelin metabolism in obesity.

Abstract: Background
Low plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) are typical of acute myocardial infarction (MI) and predict risk of recurrent cardiovascular events. The potential relationships between modifications in the molecular composition and the functionality of HDL subpopulations in acute MI however remain indeterminate.
Methods and results
ST segment elevation MI (STEMI) patients were recruited within 24h after diagnosis (n=16) and featured low HDL-C (−31%, p<0.05) and acute-phase inflammation (determined as marked elevations in C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A (SAA) and interleukin-6) as compared to age- and sex-matched controls (n=10). STEMI plasma HDL and its subpopulations (HDL2b, 2a, 3a, 3b, 3c) displayed attenuated cholesterol efflux capacity from THP-1 cells (up to −32%, p<0.01, on a unit phospholipid mass basis) vs. controls. Plasma HDL and small, dense HDL3b and 3c subpopulations from STEMI patients exhibited reduced anti-oxidative activity (up to −68%, p<0.05, on a unit HDL mass basis). HDL subpopulations in STEMI were enriched in two proinflammatory bioactive lipids, lysophosphatidylcholine (up to 3.0-fold, p<0.05) and phosphatidic acid (up to 8.4-fold, p<0.05), depleted in apolipoprotein A-I (up to −23%, p<0.05) and enriched in SAA (up to +10.2-fold, p<0.05); such changes were most marked in the HDL3b subfraction. In vitro HDL enrichment in both lysophosphatidylcholine and phosphatidic acid exerted deleterious effects on HDL functionality.
Conclusions
In the early phase of STEMI, HDL particle subpopulations display marked, concomitant alterations in both lipidome and proteome which are implicated in impaired HDL functionality. Such modifications may act synergistically to confer novel deleterious biological activities to STEMI HDL.
Significance
Our present data highlight complex changes in the molecular composition and functionality of HDL particle subpopulations in the acute phase of STEMI, and for the first time, reveal that concomitant modifications in both the lipidome and proteome contribute to functional deficiencies in cholesterol efflux and antioxidative activities of HDL particles. These findings may provide new biomarkers and new insights in therapeutic strategy to reduce cardiovascular risk in this clinical setting where such net deficiency in HDL function, multiplied by low circulating HDL concentrations, can be expected to contribute to accelerated atherogenesis.

Abstract: Chylomicron remnants, which carry dietary fats and cholesterol, play a role in promoting atherosclerosis. Chylomicron remnants are characterized by high cholesterol content at the surface, different from low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) containing high amounts of esterified cholesterol (CE) in the core. We prepared cholesterol-rich emulsions (TO–PC/cholesterol emulsions) as models for chylomicron remnants and compared their effects on J774 macrophages with acetylated-LDL (ac-LDL). Internalization of TO–PC/cholesterol emulsions into macrophages reduced cell viability, whereas ac-LDL did not. Surprisingly, there was no difference in intracellular free cholesterol content between cells incubated with TO–PC/cholesterol emulsions and with ac-LDL. Furthermore, cholesterol in TO–PC/cholesterol emulsions and ac-LDL both were internalized into J774 macrophages; however, incubation with TO–PC/cholesterol emulsions induced leakage of lysosomal protease, cathepsin-L, to cytosol, which was not observed for incubation with ac-LDL. Inhibition of the activity of cathepsin-L recovered the viability of macrophages that ingested TO–PC/cholesterol emulsions. We suggest an alternative fate of cholesterol-rich emulsions taken up by macrophages, which is different from other atherogenic lipoproteins rich in CE; internalization of TO–PC/cholesterol emulsions into macrophages induces rapid free cholesterol accumulation in lysosomes and cell death due to lysosomal destabilization.

Abstract: Ligand–receptor interactions, which represent the core for cell signaling and internalization processes are largely affected by the spatial configuration of host cell receptors. There is a growing piece of evidence that receptors are not homogeneously distributed within the plasma membrane, but are rather pre-clustered in nanodomains, or clusters are formed upon ligand binding. Pathogens have evolved many strategies to evade the host immune system and to ensure their survival by hijacking plasma membrane receptors that are most often associated with lipid rafts. In this review, we discuss the early stage molecular and physiological events that occur following ligand binding to host cell glycolipids. The ability of various biological ligands (e.g. toxins, lectins, viruses or bacteria) that bind to glycolipids to induce their own uptake into mammalian cells by creating negative membrane curvature and membrane invaginations is explored. We highlight recent trends in understanding nanoscale plasma membrane (re-)organization and present the benefits of using synthetic membrane systems. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Nanoscale membrane organisation and signalling.

Abstract: Lipoxygenases (LOXs) are lipid-peroxidizing enzymes that consist of a regulatory calcium- and membrane-binding PLAT (polycystin-1, lipoxygenase, α-toxin) domain and a catalytic domain. In a previous study, the crystal structure of an 11R-LOX revealed a conserved π–cation bridge connecting these two domains which could mediate the regulatory effect of the PLAT domain to the active site. Here we analyzed the role of residues Trp107 and Lys172 that constitute the π–cation bridge in 11R-LOX along with Arg106 and Asp173—a potential salt bridge, which could also contribute to the inter-domain communication. According to our kinetic assays and protein unfolding experiments conducted using differential scanning fluorimetry and circular dichroism spectroscopy, mutants with a disrupted link display diminished catalytic activity alongside reduced stability of the protein fold. The results demonstrate that both these bridges contribute to the two-domain interface, and are important for proper enzyme activation.

Abstract: Sphingomyelin (SM) is synthesized by SM synthase (SMS) from ceramide (Cer). SM regulates signaling pathways and maintains organ structure. SM comprises a sphingoid base and differing lengths of acyl-chains, but the importance of its various forms and regulatory synthases is not known. It has been reported that Cer synthase (CerS) has restricted substrate specificity, whereas SMS has no specificity for different lengths of acyl-chains. We hypothesized that the distribution of each SM molecular species was regulated by expression of the CerS family. Thus, we compared the distribution of SM species and CerS mRNA expression using molecular imaging. Spatial distribution of each SM molecular species was investigated using ultra-high-resolution imaging mass spectrometry (IMS). IMS revealed that distribution of SM molecular species varied according to the lengths of acyl-chains found in each brain section. Furthermore, a combination study using in situ hybridization and IMS revealed the spatial expression of CerS1 to be associated with the localization of SM (d18:1/18:0) in cell body-rich gray matter, and CerS2 to be associated with SM (d18:1/24:1) in myelin-rich white matter. Our study is the first comparison of spatial distribution between SM molecular species and CerS isoforms, and revealed their distinct association in the brain. These observations were demonstrated by suppression of CerS2 using siRNA in HepG2 cells; that is, siRNA for CerS2 specifically decreased C22 very long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA)- and C24 VLCFA-containing SMs. Thus, histological analyses of SM species by IMS could be a useful approach to consider their molecular function and regulative mechanism.

Abstract: The acylglycerophosphate acyltransferase/lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (AGPAT/LPAAT) family is a group of homologous acyl-CoA-dependent lysophospholipid acyltransferases. We performed studies to better understand the subcellular localization, activity, and in vivo function of AGPAT4/LPAATδ, which we found is expressed in multiple mouse brain regions. Endogenous brain AGPAT4 and AGPAT4 overexpressed in HEK293 or Sf9 insect cells localizes to mitochondria and is resident on the outer mitochondrial membrane. Further fractionation showed that AGPAT4 is present specifically in the mitochondria and not in the mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membrane (i.e. MAM). Lysates from Sf9 cells infected with baculoviral Agpat4 were tested with eight lysophospholipid species but showed an increased activity only with lysophosphatidic acid as an acyl acceptor. Analysis of Sf9 phospholipid species, however, indicated a significant 72% increase in phosphatidylinositol (PI) content. We examined the content of major phospholipid species in brains of Agpat4−/− mice and found also a >50% decrease in total levels of PI relative to wildtype mice, as well as significant decreases in phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), but no significant differences in phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol, cardiolipin, or phosphatidic acid (PA). A compensatory upregulation of Agpats 1, 2, 3, 5, and 9 may help to explain the lack of difference in PA. Our findings indicate that AGPAT4 is a mitochondrial AGPAT/LPAAT that specifically supports synthesis of brain PI, PC, and PE. This understanding may help to explain apparent redundancies in the AGPAT/LPAAT family.

Abstract: The pleiotropic HBx oncoprotein of hepatitis B virus is well known to promote the expression of ribosomal RNAs and several host proteins that are known to support the development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). While overexpression of the nucleolar phosphoprotein, nucleophosmin (NPM), correlates with HCC progression, its upregulation by viral HBx and the resulting impact on perturbed nucleolar functions remain enigmatic. The present study shows that HBx up-regulates NPM levels and hijacks its functions to promote cellular proliferation. We found that HBx expression stabilizes NPM through post-translational modifications. Enhanced CDK2-mediated phosphorylation of NPM at Thr199 upon HBx expression prevented its proteolytic cleavage and provided resistance to apoptosis. Further, HBx directly interacted with the C-terminal domain of NPM and got translocated into the nucleolus where it facilitated the recruitment of RNA polymerase I transcriptional machinery onto the rDNA promoter. Our results indicate that HBx enhances rDNA transcription via a novel regulatory mechanism involving acetylation of NPM and the subsequent depletion of histones from the rDNA promoter. Enhanced production of ribosomal RNA resulting from co-expression of HBx and NPM promoted ribosome biogenesis, cellular proliferation and transformation. Taken together, our study strongly suggests an important role of NPM in mediating the oncogenic effects of HBx and the corresponding nucleolar perturbations induced by this viral oncoprotein.

Abstract: Yin Yang 1 (YY1) is a member of polycomb protein family involved in epigenetic modifications and transcriptional controls. We have shown that YY1 acts as positive regulator of tumor growth and angiogenesis by interfering with the VEGFA network. Yet, the link between polycomb chromatin complex and hypoxia regulation of VEGFA is still poorly understood. Here, we establish that hypoxia impairs YY1 binding to VEGFA mRNA 3′UTR (p<0.001) in bone malignancy. Moreover, RNA immunoprecipitation reveals the formation of triplex nuclear complexes among YY1, VEGFA DNA, mRNA, and unreached about 200 fold primiRNA 200b and 200c via Dicer protein. In this complex, YY1 is necessary to maintain the steady-state level of VEGFA expression while its silencing increases VEGFA mRNA half-life at 4h and impairs the maturation of miRNA 200b/c. Hypoxia promotes histone modification through ubiquitination both of YY1 and Dicer proteins. Hypoxia-mediated down-regulation of YY1 and Dicer changes post-transcriptional VEGFA regulation by resulting in the accumulation of primiRNA200b/c in comparison to mature miRNAs (p<0.001). Given the regulatory functions of VEGFA on cellular activities to promote neoangiogenesis, we conclude that YY1 acts as novel critical interface between epigenetic code and miRNAs machinery under chronic hypoxia in malignancy.

Abstract: Oxysterols, oxidized derivatives of cholesterol, are biologically active molecules. Specific oxysterols have potent osteogenic properties that act on osteoprogenitor cells. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these osteoinductive effects on embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are unknown. This study investigated the effect of an oxysterol combination of 22(S)-hydroxycholesterol and 20(S)-hydroxycholesterol (SS) on osteogenic differentiation of ESCs and the alterations to mitochondrial activity during differentiation. Osteogenic differentiation was assessed by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, matrix mineralization, mRNA expression of osteogenic factors, runt-related transcription factor 2, osterix, and osteocalcin, and protein levels of collagen type IA (COLIA) and osteopontin (OPN). Treatment of cells with SS increased osteoinductive activity compared to the control group. Intracellular reactive oxygen species production, intracellular ATP content, mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial mass, mitochondrial DNA copy number, and mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivators 1α and β, transcription factors involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, were significantly increased during osteogenesis, indicating upregulation of mitochondrial activity. Oxysterol combinations also increased protein levels of mitochondrial respiratory complexes I–V. We also found that SS treatment increased hedgehog signaling target genes, Smo and Gli1 expression. Inhibition of Hh signaling by cyclopamine suppressed mitochondrial biogenesis and ESC osteogenesis. Subsequently, oxysterol-induced Wnt/β-catenin pathways were inhibited by repression of Hh signaling and mitochondrial biogenesis. Transfection of β-catenin specific siRNA decreased the protein levels of COLIA and OPN, as well as ALP activity. Collectively, these data suggest that lipid-based oxysterols enhance differentiation of ESCs toward the osteogenic lineage by regulating mitochondrial activity, canonical Hh/Gli, and Wnt/β-catenin signaling.

Abstract: The tissue micromilieu in disorders (inflammation, ischemia, tumor) often shows pronounced metabolic acidosis that may alter signaling and transcriptional activity in resident cells which can be of special importance for omnipresent fibroblasts. In the present study we investigated the impact of metabolic acidosis on rat fibroblasts with special emphasis on their role in inflammation by regulation of TNF-α, MCP-1, COX-2 and iNOS expression and the signaling pathways involved. Extracellular acidosis led to an enhanced expression of TNF-α, COX-2 and iNOS in parallel to an activation of p38 and ERK1/2 kinases that was not observed by sole intracellular acidosis. Accordingly, the protein amounts of TNF-α and COX-2 as well as the production of nitrate and nitrite were elevated. Acidosis-induced expression of COX-2 and iNOS depended on p38 kinase, but not on ERK1/2. In contrast acidosis-induced TNF-α expression was independent of both kinases. Although GPR4, GPR68 and GPR132 are expressed in fibroblasts, the involvement of these potential candidate pH sensors could be ruled out since no acidosis-induced elevation in intracellular cAMP or free calcium content was observed. Furthermore our data show that MAPK activation by an acidic micromilieu depends on Ser/Thr phosphatase activity, but not on the production of reactive oxygen species and is sensitive to cAMP antagonism by Rp-cAMPS. In conclusion, our results show that an acidic microenvironment induces a differential transcriptional program of pathological relevant genes in fibroblasts via the cAMP-phosphatase–MAPK pathway and thereby generates a parainflammatory situation that can result in tissue remodeling.

Abstract: Steryl esters and triacylglycerols are the major storage lipids of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Steryl esters are formed in the endoplasmic reticulum by the two acyl-CoA:sterol acyltransferases Are1p and Are2p, whereas steryl ester hydrolysis is catalyzed by the three steryl ester hydrolases Yeh1p, Yeh2p and Tgl1p. To shed light on the regulatory link between steryl ester formation and hydrolysis in the maintenance of cellular sterol and free fatty acid levels we employed yeast mutants which lacked the enzymes catalyzing the degradation of steryl esters. These studies revealed feedback regulation of steryl ester formation by steryl ester hydrolysis although in a Δtgl1Δyeh1Δyeh2 triple mutant the gene expression levels of ARE1 and ARE2 as well as protein levels and stability of Are1p and Are2p were not altered. Nevertheless, the capacity of the triple mutant to synthesize steryl esters was significantly reduced as shown by in vitro and in vivo labeling of lipids with [14C]oleic acid and [14C]acetate. Enzymatic analysis revealed that inhibition of steryl ester formation occurred at the enzyme level. As the amounts and the formation of sterols and fatty acids were also decreased in the triple mutant we concluded that defects in steryl ester hydrolysis also caused feedback inhibition on the formation of sterols and fatty acids which serve as precursors for steryl ester formation. In summary, this study demonstrates a regulatory link within the steryl ester metabolic network which contributes to non-polar lipid homeostasis in yeast cells.

Abstract: The activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor complex plays a crucial role in tumor growth and progression. However, how AP-1 transcriptional activity is repressed is not fully understood. Here, we show that RNA-binding protein with multiple splicing 1 (RBPMS1) physically and functionally interacts with AP-1 in vitro and in vivo. The RNA-recognition motif (RRM) and C-terminus of the RBPMS1 isoforms RBPMS1A and RBPMS1C, but not RBPMS1B, interacted with cFos, a member of the AP-1 family that dimerizes with cJun to stimulate AP-1 transcriptional activity. RBPMS1 did not associate with Jun proteins. RBPMS1A and RBPMS1C bound to the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain of cFos that mediates dimerization of AP-1 proteins. In addition, RBPMS1A-C interacted with the transcription factor Smad3, which was shown to interact with cJun and increase AP-1 transcriptional activity. RBPMS1 inhibited c-Fos or Smad3-mediated AP-1 transactivation and the expression of AP-1 target genes known to be the key regulators of cancer growth and progression, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and cyclin D1. Mechanistically, RBPMS1 blocks the formation of the cFos/cJun or Smad3/cJun complex as well as the recruitment of cFos or Smad3 to the promoters of AP-1 target genes. In cultured cells and a mouse xenograft model, RBPMS1 inhibited the growth and migration of breast cancer cells through c-Fos or Smad3. These data suggest that RBPMS1 is a critical repressor of AP-1 signaling and RBPMS1 activation may be a useful strategy for cancer treatment.

Abstract: Listeria monocytogenes is a psychrotolerant food borne pathogen, responsible for the high fatality disease listeriosis, and expensive food product recalls. Branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs) of the membrane play a critical role in providing appropriate membrane fluidity and optimum membrane biophysics. The fatty acid composition of a BCFA-deficient mutant is characterized by high amounts of straight-chain fatty acids and even-numbered iso fatty acids, in contrast to the parent strain where odd-numbered anteiso fatty acids predominate. The presence of 2-methylbutyrate (C5) stimulated growth of the mutant at 37°C and restored growth at 10°C along with the content of odd-numbered anteiso fatty acids. The C6 branched-chain carboxylic acids 2-ethylbutyrate and 2-methylpentanoate also stimulated growth to a similar extent as 2-methylbutyrate. However, 3-methylpentanoate was ineffective in rescuing growth. 2-Ethylbutyrate and 2-methylpentanoate led to novel major fatty acids in the lipid profile of the membrane that were identified as 12-ethyltetradecanoic acid and 12-methylpentadecanoic acid respectively. Membrane anisotropy studies indicated that growth of strain MOR401 in the presence of these precursors increased its membrane fluidity to levels of the wild type. Cells supplemented with 2-methylpentanoate or 2-ethylbutyrate at 10°C shortened the chain length of novel fatty acids, thus showing homeoviscous adaptation. These experiments use the mutant as a tool to modulate the membrane fatty acid compositions through synthetic precursor supplementation, and show how existing enzymes in L. monocytogenes adapt to exhibit non-native activity yielding unique ‘unnatural’ fatty acid molecules, which nevertheless possess the correct biophysical properties for proper membrane function in the BCFA-deficient mutant.

Abstract: Lipid resonances from mobile lipids can be observed by 1H NMR spectroscopy in multiple tissues and have also been associated with malignancy. In order to use lipid resonances as a marker for disease, a reference standard from a healthy tissue has to be established taking the influence of variable factors like the spinning rate into account. The purpose of our study was to investigate the effect of spinning rate variation on the HR-MAS pattern of lipid resonances in non-neoplastic brain biopsies from different regions and visualize polar and non-polar lipids by fluorescence microscopy using Nile Red staining. 1H HR-MAS NMR spectroscopy demonstrated higher lipid peak intensities in normal sheep brain pure white matter biopsies compared to mixed white and gray matter biopsies and pure gray matter biopsies. High spinning rates increased the visibility particularly of the methyl resonances at 1.3 and the methylene resonance at 0.89ppm in white matter biopsies stronger compared to thalamus and brainstem biopsies, and gray matter biopsies. The absence of lipid droplets and presence of a large number of myelin sheaths observed in white matter by Nile Red fluorescence microscopy suggest that the observed lipid resonances originate from the macromolecular pool of lipid protons of the myelin sheath's plasma membranes. When using lipid contents as a marker for disease, the variable behavior of lipid resonances in different neuroanatomical regions of the brain and at variable spinning rates should be considered. The findings may open up interesting possibilities for investigating lipids in myelin sheaths.

Abstract: Dysfunction of cardiac energy metabolism plays a critical role in many cardiac diseases, including heart failure, myocardial infarction and ischemia–reperfusion injury and organ transplantation. The characteristics of these diseases can be elucidated in vivo, though animal-free in vitro experiments, with primary adult or neonatal cardiomyocytes, the rat ventricular H9c2 cell line or the mouse atrial HL-1 cells, providing intriguing experimental alternatives. Currently, it is not clear how H9c2 and HL-1 cells mimic the responses of primary cardiomyocytes to hypoxia and oxidative stress. In the present study, we show that H9c2 cells are more similar to primary cardiomyocytes than HL-1 cells with regard to energy metabolism patterns, such as cellular ATP levels, bioenergetics, metabolism, function and morphology of mitochondria. In contrast to HL-1, H9c2 cells possess beta-tubulin II, a mitochondrial isoform of tubulin that plays an important role in mitochondrial function and regulation. We demonstrate that H9c2 cells are significantly more sensitive to hypoxia-reoxygenation injury in terms of loss of cell viability and mitochondrial respiration, whereas HL-1 cells were more resistant to hypoxia as evidenced by their relative stability. In comparison to HL-1 cells, H9c2 cells exhibit a higher phosphorylation (activation) state of AMP-activated protein kinase, but lower peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha levels, suggesting that each cell type is characterized by distinct regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis. Our results provide evidence that H9c2 cardiomyoblasts are more energetically similar to primary cardiomyocytes than are atrial HL-1 cells. H9c2 cells can be successfully used as an in vitro model to simulate cardiac ischemia–reperfusion injury.

Abstract: Arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism plays an important role in vascular homeostasis. We reported that DNA hypomethylation of EPHX2 induced a pro-inflammatory response in vascular endothelial cells (ECs). However, the change in the whole AA metabolism by DNA methylation is still unknown. Using a metabolomic approach, we investigated the effect of DNA methylation on the balance of AA metabolism and the underlying mechanism. ECs were treated with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-AZA), and AA metabolic profiles were analyzed. Levels of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) and thromboxane B2 (TXB2), metabolites in the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway, were significantly increased by 5-AZA treatment in ECs resulting from the induction of PGD2 synthase (PTGDS) and thromboxane A synthase 1 (TBXAS1) expression by DNA hypomethylation. This phenomenon was also observed in liver and kidney cell lines, indicating a universal mechanism. Pathophysiologically, homocysteine, known to cause DNA demethylation, induced a similar pattern of the change of AA metabolism. Furthermore, 5-AZA activated ECs, as evidenced by the upregulation of adhesion molecules. Indomethacin, a COX inhibitor, reversed the effects of 5-AZA on the levels of PGD2 and TXB2, EC activation and monocyte adhesion. In vivo, the plasma levels of PGD2 and TXB2 and the expression of In vivo PTGDS and TBXAS1 as well as adhesion molecules were increased in the aorta of the mice injected with 5-AZA. In conclusion, using a metabolomic approach, our study uncovered that DNA demethylation increased AA metabolites PGD2 and TXB2 by upregulating the expression of the corresponding enzymes, which might contribute to the DNA hypomethylation-induced endothelial activation.

Abstract: While the 3T3-L1 adipocyte model is routinely used for the study of obesity and diabetes, the mitochondrial respiratory profile in normal versus high glucose has not been examined in detail. We matured adipocytes in normal (5mM) or high (30mM) glucose and insulin and examined the mitochondrial bioenergetics. We also assessed the requirement for the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) and ER stress under these conditions. Basal respiration was ~1.7-fold greater in adipocytes that had matured in 30mM glucose; however, their ability to increase oxygen consumption in response to stress was impaired. Adipogenesis proceeded in both normal and high glucose with concomitant activation of the UPR, but only high glucose was associated with increased levels of ER stress and mitochondrial stress as observed by parallel increases in CHOP and protein succination. Treatment of adipocytes with sodium phenylbutyrate relieved mitochondrial stress through a reduction in mitochondrial respiration. Our data suggests that mitochondrial stress, protein succination and ER stress are uniquely linked in adipocytes matured in high glucose.

Abstract: Fe65 is a highly conserved adaptor protein that interacts with several binding partners. Fe65 binds proteins to mediate various cellular processes. But the interacting partner and the regulatory mechanisms controlled by Fe65 are largely unknown. In this study, we found that Fe65 interacts with the C-terminus of Jagged1. Furthermore, Fe65 negatively regulates AP1-mediated Jagged1 intercellular domain transactivation in a Tip60-independent manner. We found that Fe65 triggers the degradation of Jagged1, but not the Jagged1 intracellular domain (JICD), through both proteasome and lysosome pathways. We also showed that Fe65 promotes recruitment of the E3 ligase Neuralized-like 1 (Neurl1) to membrane-tethered Jagged1 and monoubiquitination of Jagged1. These three proteins form a stable trimeric complex, thereby decreasing Jagged1 targeting by ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Consequently, Jagged1 is a novel binding partner of Fe65, and Fe65 may act as a novel effector of Jagged1 signaling.

Abstract: ANKHD1 is highly expressed in human acute leukemia cells and potentially regulates multiple cellular functions through its ankyrin-repeat domains. In order to identify interaction partners of the ANKHD1 protein and its role in leukemia cells, we performed a yeast two-hybrid system screen and identified SIVA, a cellular protein known to be involved in proapoptotic signaling pathways. The interaction between ANKHD1 and SIVA was confirmed by co-imunoprecipitation assays. Using human leukemia cell models and lentivirus-mediated shRNA approaches, we showed that ANKHD1 and SIVA proteins have opposing effects. While it is known that SIVA silencing promotes Stathmin 1 activation, increased cell migration and xenograft tumor growth, we showed that ANKHD1 silencing leads to Stathmin 1 inactivation, reduced cell migration and xenograft tumor growth, likely through the inhibition of SIVA/Stathmin 1 association. In addition, we observed that ANKHD1 knockdown decreases cell proliferation, without modulating apoptosis of leukemia cells, while SIVA has a proapoptotic function in U937 cells, but does not modulate proliferation in vitro. Results indicate that ANKHD1 binds to SIVA and has an important role in inducing leukemia cell proliferation and migration via the Stathmin 1 pathway. ANKHD1 may be an oncogene and participate in the leukemia cell phenotype.

Abstract: The study of the response of cancer cells to chemotherapy drugs is of high importance due to the specificity of some drugs to certain types of cancer and the resistance of some specific cancer types to chemotherapy drugs. Our aim was to develop and apply the label-free and non-destructive Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) method to determine the sensitivity of three different cancer cell-lines to a common anti-cancer drug doxorubicin at different concentrations and to demonstrate that information about the mechanism of resistance to the chemotherapy drug can be extracted from spectral data. HeLa, PC3, and Caco-2 cells were seeded and grown on an attenuated total reflection (ATR) crystal, doxorubicin was applied at the clinically significant concentration of 0.1–20μM, and spectra of the cells were collected hourly over 20h. Analysis of the amide bands was correlated with cell viability, which had been cross validated with MTT assays, allowing to determine that the three cell lines had significantly different resistance to doxorubicin. The difference spectra and principal component analysis (PCA) highlighted the subtle chemical changes in the living cells under treatment. Spectral regions assigned to nucleic acids (mainly 1085cm−1) and carbohydrates (mainly 1024cm−1) showed changes that could be related to the mode of action of the drug and the mechanism of resistance of the cell lines to doxorubicin. This is a cost-effective method that does not require bioassay reagents but allows label-free, non-destructive and in situ analysis of chemical changes in live cells, using standard FTIR equipment adapted to ATR measurements.

Palmitate activation by fatty acid transport protein 4 as a model system for hepatocellular apoptosis and steatosis,

Abstract: Fatty acid transport protein (FATP) 4 is a minor FATP in the liver but it has some activity towards palmitate 16:0 (Pal). We here chose FATP4 as a representative model enzyme for acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSs), and FATPs to determine whether Pal activation would lead to apoptosis and alteration in lipid metabolism. By using FATP4 overexpressed (FATP4) Huh-7 cells, we showed that FATP4 was localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria of FATP4 cells. FATP4 cells were more responsive to Pal than the control GFP cells in increasing palmitoyl-CoA and oleoyl-CoA activities as well as apoptosis by ~2–3 folds. The lipoapoptosis susceptibility by FATP4 was coupled with the increased JNK, PUMA, caspase3, PARP-1 activation as well as Rac-1-mediated cytoskeletal reorganization, and decreased insulin sensitivity. This was associated with increased contents of neutral lipids and significant alteration in composition of phospholipids and sphingolipids including increased lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), ceramide, and hexosylceramide, as well as an increase of saturated:polyunsaturated fatty acid ratio in LPC and PC, but a decrease of this ratio in phosphatidylethanolamine pool. By use of ceramide synthase inhibitors, our results showed that FATP4-sensitized lipoapoptosis was not mediated by ceramides. Moreover, FATP4 expression was increased in fatty livers in vivo. Thus, our model system has provided a clue that Pal activation FATP4 triggers hepatocellular apoptosis via altered phospholipid composition and steatosis by acylation into complex lipids. This may be a redundant mechanism for other ER-localizing ACSs and FATPs in the liver, and hence their involvement in the development of fatty liver disease.

Abstract: Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) is an antiatherogenic high density lipoprotein-associated lactonase. Recent findings revealed that PON1 knockout mice have low blood pressure, which is negatively correlated with the level of 5,6-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (5,6-EET), a cytochrome P450 -derived arachidonic acid metabolite. 5,6-EET is an endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor that causes arterial dilation. Under physiological conditions, 5,6-EET is unstable, transforming to its δ-lactone (5,6-δ-DHTL) that evades the degradation by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), arguing for the existence of yet another enzyme that is responsible specifically for its hydrolysis. We therefore hypothesized that PON1 degrades the 5,6-δ-DHTL, and this specific PON1 lactonase activity thus decreases endothelial vasodilatation. The aim of the present study was to investigate the PON1-5,6-δ-DHTL relationship. A liquid chromatography mass spectrometry based method for 5,6-EET derivatives identification was developed. Tracking the lactonization of 5,6-EET in a physiological solution revealed that 5,6-EET was fully converted into 5,6-δ-DHTL. Incubation of 5,6-δ-DHTL with rePON1 resulted in 85.1±3.4% degradation of the substrate to 5,6 dihydroxytrienoic acid (5,6-DHET), while only 12.0±8.7% hydrolysis was detected in the absence of PON1. Accordingly, the levels of 5,6-DHTL were found to be significantly higher in the PON1KO mice than in the wild type mice. Kinetic analysis revealed values of Vmax=0.021±0.01μM/s and Km=150.99±62.1μM. Calculation of the docking energy suggested possible interaction of the 5,6-δ-DHTL in the catalytic region of PON1 with free energy of-5.57 Kcal/mol, preferentially for the (S) enantiomer. These findings demonstrate that 5,6-δ-DHTL is a PON1 substrate and imply that the 5,6-EET vasodilation effect may be impaired by PON1.

Abstract: Dolichols are, among others, obligatory cofactors of protein glycosylation in eukaryotic cells. It is well known that yeast cells accumulate a family of dolichols with Dol-15/16 dominating while upon certain physiological conditions a second family with Dol-21 dominating is noted. In this report we identified the presence of additional short-chain length polyprenols — all-trans Pren-7 in three yeast strains (SS328, BY4741 and L5366), Pren-7 was accompanied by traces of putative Pren-6 and -8. Moreover, in two of these strains a single polyprenol mainly-cis-Pren-11 was synthesized at the stationary phase of growth. Identity of polyprenols was confirmed by HR-HPLC/MS, NMR and metabolic labeling. Additionally, simvastatin inhibited their biosynthesis.

Abstract: The scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1) is an important HDL receptor involved in cholesterol uptake and efflux, but its physiological role in human lipoprotein metabolism is not fully understood. Heterozygous carriers of the SR-B1P297S mutation are characterized by increased HDL cholesterol levels, impaired cholesterol efflux from macrophages and attenuated adrenal function. Here, the composition and function of lipoproteins were studied in SR-B1P297S heterozygotes. Lipoproteins from six SR-B1P297S carriers and six family controls were investigated. HDL and LDL/VLDL were isolated by ultracentrifugation and proteins were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and identified by mass spectrometry. HDL antioxidant properties, paraoxonase 1 activities, apoA-I methionine oxidations and HDL cholesterol efflux capacity were assessed. Multivariate modeling separated carriers from controls based on lipoprotein composition. Protein analyses showed a significant enrichment of apoE in LDL/VLDL and of apoL-1 in HDL from heterozygotes compared to controls. The relative distribution of plasma apoE was increased in LDL and in lipid-free form. There were no significant differences in paraoxonase 1 activities, HDL antioxidant properties or HDL cholesterol efflux capacity but heterozygotes showed a significant increase of oxidized methionines in apoA-I. The SR-B1P297S mutation affects both HDL and LDL/VLDL protein compositions. The increase of apoE in carriers suggests a compensatory mechanism for attenuated SR-B1 mediated cholesterol uptake by HDL. Increased methionine oxidation may affect HDL function by reducing apoA-I binding to its targets. The results illustrate the complexity of lipoprotein metabolism that has to be taken into account in future therapeutic strategies aiming at targeting SR-B1.

Abstract: Jasmonates (JAs) are fatty acid derivatives that mediate many developmental processes and stress responses in plants. Synthetic jasmonate derivatives (commonly isotopically labeled), which mimic the action of the endogenous compounds are often employed as internal standards or probes to study metabolic processes. However, stable-isotope labeling of jasmonates does not allow the study of spatial and temporal distribution of these compounds in real time by positron emission tomography (PET). In this study, we explore whether a fluorinated jasmonate could mimic the action of the endogenous compound and therefore, be later employed as a tracer to study metabolic processes by PET. We describe the synthesis and the metabolism of (Z)-7-fluoro-8-(3-oxo-2-(pent-2-en-1-yl)cyclopentyl)octanoic acid (7F-OPC-8:0), a fluorinated analog of the JA precursor OPC-8:0. Like endogenous jasmonates, 7F-OPC-8:0 induces the transcription of marker jasmonate responsive genes (JRG) and the accumulation of jasmonates after its application to Arabidopsis thaliana plants. By using UHPLC–MS/MS, we could show that 7F-OPC-8:0 is metabolized in vivo similarly to the endogenous OPC-8:0. Furthermore, the fluorinated analog was successfully employed as a probe to show its translocation to undamaged systemic leaves when it was applied to wounded leaves. This result suggests that OPC-8:0 – and maybe other oxylipins – may contribute to the mobile signal which triggers systemic defense responses in plants. We highlight the potential of fluorinated oxylipins to study the mode of action of lipid-derived molecules in planta, either by conventional analytical methods or fluorine-based detection techniques.

Abstract: Neurodegenerative and neurological disorders are often characterised by pathological changes to dendrites, in advance of neuronal death. Oxidative stress, energy deficits and excitotoxicity are implicated in many such disorders, suggesting a potential vulnerability of dendrites to these situations. Here we have studied dendritic vs. somatic responses of primary cortical neurons to these types of challenges in real-time. Using a genetically encoded indicator of intracellular redox potential (Grx1-roGFP2) we found that, compared to the soma, dendritic regions exhibited more dramatic fluctuations in redox potential in response to sub-lethal ROS exposure, and existed in a basally more oxidised state. We also studied the responses of dendritic and somatic regions to excitotoxic NMDA receptor activity. Both dendritic and somatic regions experienced similar increases in cytoplasmic Ca2+. Interestingly, while mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and initial mitochondrial depolarisation were similar in both regions, secondary delayed mitochondrial depolarisation was far weaker in dendrites, potentially as a result of less NADH depletion. Despite this, ATP levels were found to fall faster in dendritic regions. Finally we studied the responses of dendritic and somatic regions to energetically demanding action potential burst activity. Burst activity triggered PDH dephosphorylation, increases in oxygen consumption and cellular NADH:NAD ratio. Compared to somatic regions, dendritic regions exhibited a smaller degree of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, lower fold-induction of NADH and larger reduction in ATP levels. Collectively, these data reveal that dendritic regions of primary neurons are vulnerable to greater energetic and redox fluctuations than the cell body, which may contribute to disease-associated dendritic damage.

Abstract: The role of the two key enzymes of fatty acid (FA) synthesis, ATP-citrate lyase (Acl) and malic enzyme (Mae), was analyzed in the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica. In most oleaginous yeasts, Acl and Mae are proposed to provide, respectively, acetyl-CoA and NADPH for FA synthesis. Acl was mainly studied at the biochemical level but no strain depleted for this enzyme was analyzed in oleaginous microorganisms. On the other hand the role of Mae in FA synthesis in Y. lipolytica remains unclear since it was proposed to be a mitochondrial NAD(H)-dependent enzyme and not a cytosolic NADP(H)-dependent enzyme. In this study, we analyzed for the first time strains inactivated for corresponding genes. Inactivation of ACL1 decreases FA synthesis by 60 to 80%, confirming its essential role in FA synthesis in Y. lipolytica. Conversely, inactivation of MAE1 has no effects on FA synthesis, except in a FA overaccumulating strain where it improves FA synthesis by 35%. This result definitively excludes Mae as a major key enzyme for FA synthesis in Y. lipolytica. During the analysis of both mutants, we observed a negative correlation between FA and mannitol level. As mannitol and FA pathways may compete for carbon storage, we inactivated YlSDR, encoding a mannitol dehydrogenase converting fructose and NADPH into mannitol and NADP+. The FA content of the resulting mutant was improved by 60% during growth on fructose, demonstrating that mannitol metabolism may modulate FA synthesis in Y. lipolytica.

Abstract: α-Lipoic acid (α-Lip) is a natural occurring antioxidant with beneficial anti-obesity properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the putative effects of α-Lip on mitochondrial biogenesis and the acquirement of brown-like characteristics by subcutaneous adipocytes from overweight/obese subjects. Thus, fully differentiated human subcutaneous adipocytes were treated with α-Lip (100 and 250μM) for 24h for studies on mitochondrial content and morphology, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number, fatty acid oxidation enzymes and brown/beige characteristic genes. The involvement of the Sirtuin1/Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, coactivator 1 alpha (SIRT1/PGC-1α) pathway was also evaluated. Our results showed that α-Lip increased mitochondrial content in cultured human adipocytes as revealed by electron microscopy and by mitotracker green labeling. Moreover, an enhancement in mtDNA content was observed. This increase was accompanied by an up-regulation of SIRT1 protein levels, a decrease in PGC-1α acetylation and up-regulation of Nuclear respiratory factor 1 (Nrf1) and Mitochondrial transcription factor (Tfam) transcription factors. Enhanced oxygen consumption and fatty acid oxidation enzymes, Carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 and Acyl-coenzyme A oxidase (CPT-1 and ACOX) were also observed. Mitochondria from α-Lip-treated adipocytes exhibited some morphological characteristics of brown mitochondria, and α-Lip also induced up-regulation of some brown/beige adipocytes markers such as cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector a (Cidea) and T-box 1 (Tbx1). Moreover, α-Lip up-regulated PR domain containing 16 (Prdm16) mRNA levels in treated adipocytes. Therefore, our study suggests the ability of α-Lip to promote mitochondrial biogenesis and brown-like remodeling in cultured white subcutaneous adipocytes from overweight/obese donors.

Abstract: Human 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) is the key enzyme in the formation of leukotrienes (LTs), important mediators of inflammation. Cellular 5-LO activity is regulated in a complex manner, e.g. by calcium influx, the cellular redox status or 5-LO phosphorylation. Being a mobile enzyme, 5-LO migrates from the cytosol to the nuclear envelope where it is believed to interact with 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP) and receives the substrate arachidonic acid (AA). 5-LO contains four cysteine residues located close to the AA entry site. In the present study, we show that in vitro glutathionylation of recombinant purified 5-LO wildtype (WT) as well as 5-LO 4C, a mutant where the four surface cysteines are replaced by serines (Cys159/300/416/418Ser), does not alter the product synthesis. However, in 5-LO/FLAP-transfected HeLa cells, treatment with the thiol-oxidizing agent diamide which promotes glutathionylation at surface Cys residues led to a decreased LT synthesis by 5-LO WT. In contrast to the WT enzyme, LT formation of the 4C mutant was stimulated by addition of diamide. Immunofluorescence studies in human monocytes and HEK293 cells, expressing 5-LO and FLAP, revealed that diamide prevented the translocation of 5-LO WT whereas it enhanced the translocation of the fourfold cysteine mutant. Therefore, we could demonstrate that the interface, involving the four cysteines 159, 300, 416 and 418, is important for the translocation to the nuclear membrane and the colocalization with FLAP.

Abstract: The tripartite motif containing (TRIM) proteins are a large family of proteins that have been implicated in many biological processes including cell differentiation, apoptosis, transcriptional regulation, and signaling pathways. Here, we show that TRIM15 co-localized to focal adhesions through homo-dimerization and significantly suppressed cell migration. Domain mapping analysis indicated that B-box2 and PRY domains were essential for TRIM15 localization to focal adhesions and inhibition of cell migration. Our protein-protein interaction screen of TRIM15 with the integrin adhesome identified several TRIM15 interacting proteins including coronin 1B, cortactin, filamin binding LIM protein1, and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein, which are involved in actin cytoskeleton dynamics. TRIM15 expression was tissue-restricted and downregulated in colon cancer. Level of TRIM15 expression was associated with colon cancer cell migration, as well as both in vitro and in vivo tumor growth. These data provide novel insights into the role of TRIM15 as an additional component of the integrin adhesome, regulating cell migration, and suggest that TRIM15 may function as a tumor suppressor of colon cancer.

Abstract: We identified S100A4 as a marker of rhomboid (R) smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in vitro (the synthetic phenotype, typical of intimal SMCs) in the porcine coronary artery and of intimal SMCs in vivo in both pigs and humans. S100A4 is an intracellular Ca2+ signaling protein and can be secreted; it has extracellular functions via the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). Our objective was to explore the role of S100A4 in SMC phenotypic change, a phenomenon characteristic of atherosclerotic plaque formation. Transfection of a human S100A4-containing plasmid in spindle-shaped (S) SMCs (devoid of S100A4) led to approximately 10% of S100A4-overexpressing SMCs, S100A4 release, and a transition towards a R-phenotype of the whole SMC population. Furthermore treatment of S-SMCs with S100A4-rich conditioned medium collected from S100A4-transfected S-SMCs induced a transition towards a R-phenotype, which was associated with decreased SMC differentiation markers and increased proliferation and migration by activating the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors (TIMPs). It yielded NF-κB activation in a RAGE-dependent manner. Blockade of extracellular S100A4 in R-SMCs with S100A4 neutralizing antibody induced a transition from R- to S-phenotype, decreased proliferative activity and upregulation of SMC differentiation markers. By contrast, silencing of S100A4 mRNA in R-SMCs did not change the level of extracellular S100A4 or SMC morphology in spite of decreased proliferative activity. Our results show that extracellular S100A4 plays a pivotal role in SMC phenotypic changes. It could be a new target to prevent SMC accumulation during atherosclerosis and restenosis.

Abstract: p-21-Activated kinase 1 (PAK1) enhances colorectal cancer (CRC) progression by stimulating Wnt/β-catenin, ERK and AKT pathways. PAK1 also promotes CRC survival via up-regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), a key player in cancer survival. Glaucarubinone, a quassinoid natural product, inhibits pancreatic cancer growth by down-regulation of PAK1. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of glaucarubinone on CRC growth and metastasis, and the mechanism involved. Cell proliferation was measured in vitro by [3H]-thymidine incorporation and in vivo by volume of tumor xenografts. Protein concentrations were measured by Western blotting of cell extracts. We report here that glaucarubinone inhibited CRC growth both in vitro and in vivo. The potency of glaucarubinone as an inhibitor of cell proliferation was negatively correlated to PAK1 expression in CRC cells. Glaucarubinone suppressed the expression of HIF-1α and β-catenin. Knockdown of PAK1 by shRNA enhanced inhibition by glaucarubinone while constitutively active PAK1 blocked the inhibitory effect. Our findings indicate that glaucarubinone inhibited CRC growth by down-regulation of HIF-1α and β-catenin via a PAK1-dependent pathway.

Abstract: Hepatic lipase (HL) is an important enzyme in the clearance of triacylglycerol (TAG) from the circulation, and has been proposed to have pro-atherogenic as well as anti-atherogenic properties. It hydrolyzes both phospholipids and TAG of lipoproteins, and its activity is negatively correlated with HDL levels. Although it is known that HL acts preferentially on HDL lipids, the basis for this specificity is not known, since it does not require any specific apoprotein for activity. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that sphingomyelin (SM), whose concentration is much higher in VLDL and LDL compared to HDL, is an inhibitor of HL, and that this could explain the lipoprotein specificity of the enzyme. The results presented show that the depletion of SM from normal lipoproteins activated the HL roughly in proportion to their SM content. SM depletion stimulated the hydrolysis of both phosphatidylcholine (PC) and TAG, although the PC hydrolysis was stimulated more. In the native lipoproteins, HL showed specificity for PC species containing polyunsaturated fatty acids at sn-2 position, and produced more unsaturated lyso PC species. The enzyme also showed preferential hydrolysis of certain TAG species over others. SM depletion affected the specificity of the enzyme towards PC and TAG species modestly. These results show that SM is a physiological inhibitor of HL activity in lipoproteins and that the specificity of the enzyme towards HDL is at least partly due to its low SM content.

Abstract: Even though oxidative stress damage from excessive production of ROS is a well known phenomenon, the impact of reductive stress remains poorly understood. This study tested the hypothesis that cellular reductive stress could lead to mitochondrial malfunction, triggering a mitochondrial hormesis (mitohormesis) phenomenon able to protect mitochondria from the deleterious effects of statins. We performed several in vitro experiments on L6 myoblasts and studied the effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) at different exposure times. Direct NAC exposure (1mM) led to reductive stress, impairing mitochondrial function by decreasing maximal mitochondrial respiration and increasing H2O2 production. After 24h of incubation, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was increased. The resulting mitochondrial oxidation activated mitochondrial biogenesis pathways at the mRNA level. After one week of exposure, mitochondria were well-adapted as shown by the decrease of cellular ROS, the increase of mitochondrial content, as well as of the antioxidant capacities. Atorvastatin (ATO) exposure (100μM) for 24h increased ROS levels, reduced the percentage of live cells, and increased the total percentage of apoptotic cells. NAC exposure during 3days failed to protect cells from the deleterious effects of statins. On the other hand, NAC pretreatment during one week triggered mitochondrial hormesis and reduced the deleterious effect of statins. These results contribute to a better understanding of the redox-dependant pathways linked to mitochondria, showing that reductive stress could trigger mitochondrial hormesis phenomenon.

Abstract: In a previous study we could show that connexin 43 (Cx43) expression increased the migration of cells in a channel-independent manner involving the MAPK p38. We analyzed here the mechanism by which Cx43 enhanced p38 activation and migration related changes of the actin cytoskeleton. HeLa cells were used as a model system for the controlled expression of Cx43 and truncated Cx43 proteins. The expression of Cx43 altered the actin cytoskeleton organization in response to serum stimulation. Cx43 expressing HeLa cells had significantly more filopodial protrusions per cell than empty-vector transfected control cells. The expression of the channel incompetent carboxyl tail of Cx43 was sufficient to enhance the filopodia formation whereas the N-terminal, channel-building part, had no such effect. The enhanced filopodia formation was p38 dependent since the p38 blocker SB203580 significantly diminished it. Immunoprecipitation revealed an interaction of the upstream regulator of p38, p21-activated protein kinase 1 (PAK1), with Cx43 resulting in an enhanced phosphorylation of PAK1. Moreover, p38 activation, filopodia formation and cell migration were significantly reduced by blocking the PAK1 activity with its pharmacological inhibitor, IPA-3. The p38 target Hsp27, which favors the actin polymerization in its phosphorylated form, was significantly more phosphorylated characterizing it as a potential candidate molecule to enhance the serum-induced actin polymerization in Cx43 expressing cells. Our results provide a novel mechanism by which Cx43 can modify actin cytoskeletal dynamics and may thereby enhance cell migration.

Abstract: Extracellular calcium (Ca2+o) and its receptor, the Ca2+-sensing receptor (CaSR), play an important role in prostate physiology, and it has been shown that the deregulation of Ca2+ homeostasis and the overexpression of CaSR are involved in prostate cancer (PCa). Regucalcin (RGN), a Ca2+-binding protein that plays a relevant role in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, was identified as an under-expressed protein in human PCa. Moreover, RGN was associated with suppression of cell proliferation, suggesting that the loss of RGN may favor development and progression of PCa. This work aims to unveil the role of Ca2+o on RGN expression and viability of non-neoplastic (PNT1A) and neoplastic (LNCaP) prostate cell lines. It was demonstrated that Ca2+o up-regulates RGN expression in both cell lines, but important differences were found between cells for dose- and time-responses to Ca2+o treatment. It was also shown that high [Ca2+]o triggers different effects on cell proliferation of neoplastic and non-neoplastic PCa cells, which seems to be related with RGN expression levels. This suggests the involvement of RGN in the regulation of cell proliferation in response to Ca2+o treatment. Also, the effect of Ca2+o on CaSR expression seems to be dependent of RGN expression, which is strengthened by the fact that RGN-knockdown in PNT1A cells increases the CaSR expression, whereas transgenic rats overexpressing RGN exhibit low levels of CaSR. Overall, our results highlighted the importance of RGN as a regulatory protein in Ca2+-dependent signaling pathways and its deregulation of RGN expression by Ca2+o may contribute for onset and progression of PCa.

Abstract: Membrane proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are involved in a wide array of essential cellular functions. Identification of the topology of membrane proteins can provide significant insight into their mechanisms of action and biological roles. This is particularly important for membrane enzymes, since their topology determines the subcellular site where a biochemical reaction takes place and the dependence on luminal or cytosolic co-factor pools and substrates. The methods currently available for the determination of topology of proteins are rather laborious and require post-lysis or post-fixation manipulation of cells. In this work, we have developed a simple method for defining intracellular localization and topology of ER membrane proteins in living cells, based on the fusion of the respective protein with redox-sensitive green-fluorescent protein (roGFP). We validated the method and demonstrated that roGFP fusion proteins constitute a reliable tool for the study of ER membrane protein topology, using as control microsomal 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD) proteins whose topology has been resolved, and comparing with an independent approach. We then implemented this method to determine the membrane topology of six microsomal members of the 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD) family. The results revealed a luminal orientation of the catalytic site for three enzymes, i.e. 17β-HSD6, 7 and 12. Knowledge of the intracellular location of the catalytic site of these enzymes will enable future studies on their biological functions and on the role of the luminal co-factor pool.

Abstract: Secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) generates bioactive lysophospholipids implicated in acute and chronic inflammation, but the pathophysiologic role of sPLA2 is poorly understood. Given that high-density lipoprotein (HDL) is the major substrate for sPLA2 in plasma, we investigated the effects of sPLA2-mediated modification of HDL (sPLA2-HDL) on neutrophil function, an essential arm of the innate immune response and atherosclerosis. Treatment of neutrophils with sPLA2-HDL rapidly prevented agonist-induced neutrophil activation, including shape change, neutrophil extracellular trap formation, CD11b activation, adhesion under flow and migration of neutrophils. The cholesterol-mobilizing activity of sPLA2-HDL was markedly increased when compared to native HDL, promoting a significant reduction of cholesterol-rich signaling microdomains integral to cellular signaling pathways. Moreover, sPLA2-HDL effectively suppressed agonist-induced rise in intracellular Ca2+ levels. Native HDL showed no significant effects and removing lysophospholipids from sPLA2-HDL abolished all anti-inflammatory activities. Overall, our studies suggest that the increased cholesterol-mobilizing activity of sPLA2-HDL and suppression of rise in intracellular Ca2+ levels are likely mechanism that counteracts agonist-induced activation of neutrophils. These counterintuitive findings imply that neutrophil trafficking and effector responses are altered by sPLA2-HDL during inflammatory conditions.

Hsf4 counteracts Hsf1 transcription activities and increases lens epithelial cell survival in vitro,

Abstract: The interplay between Hsf4 and Hsf1 plays an important role in the regulation of lens homeostasis. However, the mechanism of the intermolecular association involved is still unclear. In this paper, we find that reconstitution of Hsf4b into Hsf4−/− lens epithelial (mLEC/Hsf4−/−) cells can simultaneously downregulate Hsp70 expression and upregulate the expression of small heat shock proteins Hsp25 and αB-crystallin at both RNA and protein levels. ChIP assay results indicate Hsf4b, which binds to the promoters of Hsp90α, Hsp70.3, Hsp25 and αB-crystallin but not Hsp70.1, can inhibit Hsf1 binding to Hsp70.3 promoter and the heat shock mediated Hsp70 promoter activity by reducing Hsf1 protein expression. Hsf4b N-terminal hydrophobic region can interact with Hsf1 N-terminal hydrophobic region. Their interaction impairs Hsf1's intramolecular interaction between the N- and C-terminal hydrophobic regions, leading to Hsf1's cytosolic retention and protein degradation. Both lysosome inhibitors (chloroquine, pepstatin A plus E64d) and proteasome inhibitor MG132 can inhibit Hsf4-mediated Hsf1 protein degradation, but MG132 can induce Hsf1 activation as well. Upregulation of Hsf4b can significantly inhibit cisplatin and staurosporine induced lens epithelial cell apoptosis through direct upregulation of Hsp25 and αB-crystallin expression. Taken together, our results imply that upregulation of Hsf4b modulates the expression pattern of heat shock proteins in lens tissue by either directly binding to their promoters or promoting Hsf1 protein degradation. Moreover, upregulation of Hsf4b protects lens cell survival by upregulating anti-apoptotic pathways. These studies reveal a novel regulatory mechanism between Hsf1 and Hsf4b in modulating lens epithelial cell homeostasis.

Abstract: Caloric restriction and intermittent fasting are known to improve glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance in several species including humans. The aim of this study was to unravel potential mechanisms by which these interventions improve insulin sensitivity and protect from type 2 diabetes. Diabetes-susceptible New Zealand Obese mice were either 10% calorie restricted (CR) or fasted every other day (IF), and compared to ad libitum (AL) fed control mice. AL mice showed a diabetes prevalence of 43%, whereas mice under CR and IF were completely protected against hyperglycemia. Proteomic analysis of hepatic lipid droplets revealed significantly higher levels of PSMD9 (co-activator Bridge-1), MIF (macrophage migration inhibitor factor), TCEB2 (transcription elongation factor B (SIII), polypeptide 2), ACY1 (aminoacylase 1) and FABP5 (fatty acid binding protein 5), and a marked reduction of GSTA3 (glutathione S-transferase alpha 3) in samples of CR and IF mice. In addition, accumulation of diacylglycerols (DAGs) was significantly reduced in livers of IF mice (P=0.045) while CR mice showed a similar tendency (P=0.062). In particular, 9 DAG species were significantly reduced in response to IF, of which DAG-40:4 and DAG-40:7 also showed significant effects after CR. This was associated with a decreased PKCε activation and might explain the improved insulin sensitivity. In conclusion, our data indicate that protection against diabetes upon caloric restriction and intermittent fasting associates with a modulation of lipid droplet protein composition and reduction of intracellular DAG species.

Abstract: There are many reports of the anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and anti-atherosclerotic activities of conjugated linolenic acids (cLNA). They constitute a small percentage of fatty acids in the typical human diet, although up to 80% of the fatty acids in certain fruits such as pomegranate. In the course of studying a bacterial fatty acid dioxygenase (Nostoc linoleate 10S-DOX, an ancient relative of mammalian cyclooxygenases), we detected strong inhibitory activity in a commercial sample of linoleic acid. We identified two cLNA isomers, β-eleostearic (9E,11E,13E-18:3) and β-calendic acid (8E,10E,12E-18:3), as responsible for that striking inhibition with a Ki of ~49nM and ~125nM, respectively, the most potent among eight cLNA tested. We also examined the effects of all eight cLNA on the activity of COX-1 and COX-2. Jacaric acid (8Z,10E,12Z-18:3) and its 12E isomer, 8Z,10E,12E-18:3, strongly inhibit the activity of COX-1 with a Ki of ~1.7 and ~1.1μM, respectively. By contrast, COX-2 was ≤30% inhibited at 10μM concentrations of the cLNA. Identifying the activities of the naturally occurring fatty acids is of interest in terms of understanding their interaction with the enzymes, and for explaining the mechanistic basis of their biological effects. The study also highlights the potential presence of inhibitory fatty acids in commercial lipids prepared from natural sources. Analysis of seven commercial samples of linoleic acid by HPLC and UV spectroscopy is illustrated as supplementary data.

Abstract: Muscular dystrophy is accompanied by a reduction in activity of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) that contributes to abnormal Ca2+ homeostasis in sarco/endoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER). Recent findings suggest that skeletal muscle fatty acid synthase (FAS) modulates SERCA activity and muscle function via its effects on SR membrane phospholipids. In this study, we examined muscle's lipid metabolism in mdx mice, a mouse model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). De novo lipogenesis was ~50% reduced in mdx muscles compared to wildtype (WT) muscles. Gene expressions of lipogenic and other ER lipid-modifying enzymes were found to be differentially expressed between wildtype (WT) and mdx muscles. A comprehensive examination of muscles' SR phospholipidome revealed elevated phosphatidylcholine (PC) and PC/phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) ratio in mdx compared to WT mice. Studies in primary myocytes suggested that defects in key lipogenic enzymes including FAS, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), and Lipin1 are likely contributing to reduced SERCA activity in mdx mice. Triple transgenic expression of FAS, SCD1, and Lipin1 (3TG) in mdx myocytes partly rescued SERCA activity, which coincided with an increase in SR PE that normalized PC/PE ratio. These findings implicate a defect in lipogenesis to be a contributing factor for SERCA dysfunction in muscular dystrophy. Restoration of muscle's lipogenic pathway appears to mitigate SERCA function through its effects on SR membrane composition.

Abstract: Success in developing therapeutic approaches to target brain tumor-associated inflammation in patients has been limited. Given that the inflammatory microenvironment is a hallmark signature of solid tumor development, anti-inflammatory targeting strategies have been envisioned as preventing glioblastoma initiation or progression. Consumption of foods from plant origin is associated with reduced risk of developing cancers, a chemopreventive effect that is, in part, attributed to their high content of phytochemicals with potent anti-inflammatory properties. We explored whether luteolin, a common flavonoid in many types of plants, may inhibit interleukin (IL)-1β function induction of the inflammation biomarker cyclooxygenase (COX)-2. We found that IL-1β triggered COX-2 expression in U-87 glioblastoma cells and synergized with luteolin to potentiate or inhibit that induction in a biphasic manner. Luteolin pretreatment of cells inhibited IL-1β-mediated phosphorylation of inhibitor of κB, nuclear transcription factor-κB (NF-κB) p65, extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2, and c-Jun amino-terminal kinase in a concentration-dependent manner. Luteolin also inhibited AKT phosphorylation and survivin expression, while it triggered both caspase-3 cleavage and expression of glucose-regulated protein 78. These effects were all potentiated by IL-1β, in part through increased nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65. Finally, luteolin was able to reduce IL-1 receptor gene expression, and treatment with IL-1 receptor antagonist or gene silencing of IL-1 receptor prevented IL-1β/luteolin-induced COX-2 expression. Our results document a novel adaptive cellular response to luteolin, which triggers anti-survival and anti-inflammatory mechanisms that contribute to the chemopreventive properties of this diet-derived molecule.

Abstract: Tissue transglutaminase (TG2) is a multifunctional protein cross-linking enzyme that has been implicated in apoptotic cell clearance but is also important in many other cell functions including cell adhesion, migration and monocyte to macrophage differentiation. Cell surface-associated TG2 regulates cell adhesion and migration, via its association with receptors such as syndecan-4 and β1 and β3 integrins. Whilst defective apoptotic cell clearance has been described in TG2-deficient mice, the precise role of TG2 in apoptotic cell clearance remains ill-defined. Our work addresses the role of macrophage extracellular TG2 in apoptotic cell corpse clearance. Here we reveal TG2 expression and activity (cytosolic and cell surface) in human macrophages and demonstrate that inhibitors of protein crosslinking activity reduce macrophage clearance of dying cells. We show also that cell-impermeable TG2 inhibitors significantly inhibit the ability of macrophages to migrate and clear apoptotic cells through reduced macrophage recruitment to, and binding of, apoptotic cells. Association studies reveal TG2–syndecan-4 interaction through heparan sulphate side chains, and knockdown of syndecan-4 reduces cell surface TG2 activity and apoptotic cell clearance. Furthermore, inhibition of TG2 activity reduces crosslinking of CD44, reported to augment AC clearance. Thus our data define a role for TG2 activity at the surface of human macrophages in multiple stages of AC clearance and we propose that TG2, in association with heparan sulphates, may exert its effect on AC clearance via a mechanism involving the crosslinking of CD44.

Abstract: JMJD5 is a Jumonji C domain-containing demethylase/hydroxylase shown to be essential in embryological development, osteoclastic maturation, circadian rhythm regulation and cancer metabolism. However, its role and underlying mechanisms in oncogenesis remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that JMJD5 forms complex with the tumor suppressor p53 by interacting with p53 DNA-binding domain (DBD), and negatively regulates its activity. Downregulation of JMJD5 resulted in increased expression of multiple p53 downstream genes, such as the cell cycle inhibitor CDKN1A and DNA repair effector P53R2, only in p53-proficient lung cancer cells. Upon DNA damage, the JMJD5–p53 association decreased, and thereby, promoted p53 recruitment to the target genes and stimulated its transcriptional activity. Furthermore, JMJD5 facilitated the cell cycle progression in a p53-dependent manner under both normal and DNA damage conditions. Depletion of JMJD5 inhibited cell proliferation and enhanced adriamycin-induced cell growth suppression in the presence of p53. Collectively, our results reveal that JMJD5 is a novel binding partner of p53 and it functions as a positive modulator of cell cycle and cell proliferation mainly through the repression of p53 pathway. Our study extends the mechanistic understanding of JMJD5 function in cancer development and implicates JMJD5 as a potential therapeutic target for cancer.

Abstract: Metastasis associated protein 1 (MTA1) is a component of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylating (NuRD) complex which mediates gene silencing and is overexpressed in several cancers. We reported earlier that resveratrol, a dietary stilbene found in grapes, can down-regulate MTA1. In the present study, we show that PTEN is inactivated by MTA1 in prostate cancer cells. Further, we show that resveratrol promotes acetylation and reactivation of PTEN via inhibition of the MTA1/HDAC complex, resulting in inhibition of the Akt pathway. In addition, we show that MTA1 knockdown is sufficient to augment acetylation of PTEN indicating a crucial role of MTA1 itself in the regulation of PTEN acetylation contributing to its lipid phosphatase activity. Acetylated PTEN preferentially accumulates in the nucleus where it binds to MTA1. We also show that MTA1 interacts exclusively with PTEN acetylated on Lys125 and Lys128, resulting in diminished p-Akt levels. Finally, using orthotopic prostate cancer xenografts, we demonstrate that both resveratrol treatment and MTA1 knockdown enhance PTEN levels leading to a decreased p-Akt expression and proliferation index. Taken together, our results indicate that MTA1/HDAC unit is a negative regulator of PTEN which facilitates survival pathways and progression of prostate cancer and that resveratrol can reverse this process through its MTA1 inhibitory function.

Abstract: Hyperthermia (39–45°C) has emerged as an alternate prospect for cancer therapy in combination with radiation and chemotherapy. Despite promising progress in the clinic, molecular mechanisms involved in hyperthermia-induced cell death are not clear. Hyperthermia causes protein denaturation/aggregation, which results in cell death by apoptosis and/or necrosis. Hyperthermia also induces thermotolerance, which renders cells resistant to subsequent exposure to lethal heat shock. This study investigates the role of both lethal (42–43°C) and mild (40°C) hyperthermia in regulating ER stress and ER stress-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells. The ability of mild thermotolerance induced at 40°C to alleviate either or both of these processes is also determined. Hyperthermia (42–43°C) induced ER stress, revealed by phosphorylation of PERK, eIF2α and IRE1α, cleavage of ATF6 and increased expression of BiP and sXBP1. Real-time PCR revealed that mRNA levels of ATF6, ATF4, BiP, sXBP1 and CHOP increased in cells exposed to hyperthermia. Moreover, hyperthermia caused disruption of calcium homeostasis and activated the calpain-calpastatin proteolytic system and ER resident caspase 4. Pre-exposure to mild hyperthermia (40°C) alleviated the induction of cytotoxicity and ER stress by hyperthermia (42–43°C) and protected cells against ER stress-induced apoptosis. ShRNA-mediated depletion of Hsp72 abrogated protective effects of mild thermotolerance (40°C) against heat-shock induced ER stress and sensitized cells to ER stress-mediated apoptosis. Our findings show that Hsp72 contributes to the protective effects of mild hyperthermia (40°C) against hyperthermia-induced ER stress and apoptosis.

Abstract: We recently demonstrated that 12/15-lipoxygenase (LOX) derived metabolites, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), contribute to diabetic retinopathy (DR) via NADPH oxidase (NOX) and disruption of the balance in retinal levels of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF). Here, we test whether PEDF ameliorates retinal vascular injury induced by HETEs and the underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, we pursue the causal relationship between LOX–NOX system and regulation of PEDF expression during DR. For these purposes, we used an experimental eye model in which normal mice were injected intravitreally with 12-HETE with/without PEDF. Thereafter, fluorescein angiography (FA) was used to evaluate the vascular leakage, followed by optical coherence tomography (OCT) to assess the presence of angiogenesis. FA and OCT reported an increased vascular leakage and pre-retinal neovascularization, respectively, in response to 12-HETE that were not observed in the PEDF-treated group. Moreover, PEDF significantly attenuated the increased levels of vascular cell and intercellular adhesion molecules, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, elicited by 12-HETE injection. Accordingly, the direct relationship between HETEs and PEDF has been explored through in-vitro studies using Müller cells (rMCs) and human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs). The results showed that 12- and 15-HETEs triggered the secretion of TNF-α and IL-6, as well as activation of NFκB in rMCs and significantly increased permeability and reduced zonula occludens protein-1 (ZO-1) immunoreactivity in HRECs. All these effects were prevented in PEDF-treated cells. Furthermore, interest in PEDF regulation during DR has been expanded to include NOX system. Retinal PEDF was significantly restored in diabetic mice treated with NOX inhibitor, apocynin, or lacking NOX2 up to 80% of the control level. Collectively, our findings suggest that interfering with LOX–NOX signaling opens up a new direction for treating DR by restoring endogenous PEDF that carries out multilevel vascular protective functions.

Abstract: Background
Liver X receptors (LXRs) are transcription factors activated by cholesterol metabolites containing an oxidized side chain. Due to their ability to regulate lipid metabolism and cholesterol transport, they have become attractive pharmacological targets. LXRs are closely related to DAF-12, a nuclear receptor involved in nematode lifespan and regulated by the binding of C-27 steroidal acids. Based on our recent finding that the lack of the C-25 methyl group does not abolish their DAF-12 activity, we evaluated the effect of removing it from the (25R)-cholestenoic acid, a LXR agonist.
Methods
The binding mode and the molecular basis of action of 27-nor-5-cholestenoic acid were evaluated using molecular dynamics simulations. The biological activity was investigated using reporter gene expression assays and determining the expression levels of endogenous target genes. The in vitro MARCoNI assay was used to analyze the interaction with cofactors.
Results
27-Nor-5-cholestenoic acid behaves as an inverse agonist. This correlates with the capacity of the complex to better bind corepressors rather than coactivators. The C-25 methyl moiety would be necessary for the maintenance of a torsioned conformation of the steroid side chain that stabilizes an active LXRβ state.
Conclusion
We found that a 27-nor analog is able to act as a LXR ligand. Interestingly, this minimal structural change on the steroid triggered a drastic change in the LXR response.
General significance
Results contribute to improve our understanding on the molecular basis of LXRβ mechanisms of action and provide a new scaffold in the quest for selective LXR modulators.

Abstract: Epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) is the founding member of the ErbB family of growth factor receptors that modulate a complex network of intracellular signaling pathways controlling growth, proliferation, differentiation, and motility. Selenoprotein W (SEPW1) is a highly conserved, diet-regulated 9kDa thioredoxin-like protein required for normal cell cycle progression. We report here that SEPW1 is required for EGF-induced EGFR activation and that it functions by suppressing EGFR ubiquitination and receptor degradation. SEPW1 depletion inhibited EGF-dependent cell cycle entry in breast and prostate epithelial cells. In prostate cells, SEPW1 depletion decreased EGFR auto-phosphorylation, while SEPW1 overexpression increased EGFR auto-phosphorylation. SEPW1 depletion increased the rate of EGFR degradation, which decreased total and surface EGFR and suppressed EGF-dependent EGFR endocytosis, EGFR dimer formation, and activation of EGF-dependent pathways. EGFR ubiquitination was increased in SEPW1-depleted cells — in agreement with the increased rate of EGFR degradation, and suggests that SEPW1 suppresses EGFR ubiquitination. Ubiquitination-directed lysozomal degradation controls post-translational EGFR expression and is dysregulated in many cancers. Thus, suppression of EGFR ubiquitination by SEPW1 may be related to the putative increase in cancer risk associated with high selenium intakes. Knowledge of the mechanisms underlying SEPW1's regulation of EGFR ubiquitination may reveal new opportunities for nutritional cancer prevention or cancer drug development.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the potential to migrate toward damaged tissues increasing tissue regeneration. Interleukin-17 (IL-17) is a proinflammatory cytokine with pleiotropic effects associated with many inflammatory diseases. Although IL-17 can modulate MSC functions, its capacity to regulate MSC migration is not well elucidated so far. Here, we studied the role of IL-17 on peripheral blood (PB) derived MSC migration and transmigration across endothelial cells. IL-17 increased PB-MSC migration in a wound healing assay as well as cell mobilization from collagen gel. Concomitantly IL-17 induced the expression of urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA) without affecting matrix metalloproteinase expression. The incremented uPA expression mediated the capacity of IL-17 to enhance PB-MSC migration in a ERK1,2 MAPK dependent way. Also, IL-17 induced PB-MSC migration alongside with changes in cell polarization and uPA localization in cell protrusions. Moreover, IL-17 increased PB-MSC adhesion to endothelial cells and transendothelial migration, as well as increased the capacity of PB-MSC adhesion to fibronectin, in an uPA-dependent fashion. Therefore, our data suggested that IL-17 may act as chemotropic factor for PB-MSCs by incrementing cell motility and uPA expression during inflammation development.

Abstract: Yeast Fld1 and Ldb16 resemble mammalian seipin, implicated in neutral lipid storage. Both proteins form a complex at the endoplasmic reticulum-lipid droplet (LD) interface. Malfunction of this complex either leads to LD clustering or to the generation of supersized LD (SLD) in close vicinity to the nuclear envelope, in response to altered phospholipid (PL) composition. We show that similar to mutants lacking Fld1, deletion of LDB16 leads to abnormal proliferation of a subdomain of the nuclear envelope, which is tightly associated with clustered LD. The human lipin-1 ortholog, the PAH1 encoded phosphatidic acid (PA) phosphatase, and its activator Nem1 are highly enriched at this site. The specific accumulation of PA-binding marker proteins indicates a local enrichment of PA in the fld1 and ldb16 mutants. Furthermore, we demonstrate that clustered LD in fld1 or ldb16 mutants are transformed to SLD if phosphatidylcholine synthesis is compromised by additional deletion of the phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase, Cho2. Notably, treatment of wild-type cells with oleate induced a similar LD clustering and nuclear membrane proliferation phenotype as observed in fld1 and ldb16 mutants. These data suggest that the Fld1–Ldb16 complex affects PA homeostasis at an LD-forming subdomain of the nuclear envelope. Lack of Fld1–Ldb16 leads to locally elevated PA levels that induce an abnormal proliferation of nER membrane structures and the clustering of associated LD. We suggest that the formation of SLD is a consequence of locally altered PL metabolism at this site.

Abstract: Recently, endocannabinoids have emerged as signalling mediators in reproduction. It is widely accepted that anandamide (AEA) levels must be tightly regulated, and that a disturbance in AEA levels may impact decidual stability and regression. We have previously characterized the endocannabinoid machinery in rat decidual tissue and reported the pro-apoptotic action of AEA on rat decidual cells. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is an inducible enzyme that plays a crucial role in early pregnancy, and is also a key modulator in the crosstalk between endocannabinoids and prostaglandins. On the other hand, AEA-oxidative metabolism by COX-2 is not merely a mean to inactivate its action, but it yields the formation of a new class of mediators, named prostaglandin-ethanolamides, or prostamides. In this study we found that AEA-induced apoptosis in decidual cells involves COX-2 metabolic pathway. AEA induced COX-2 expression through p38 MAPK, resulting in the formation of prostamide E2 (PME2). Our findings also suggest that AEA-induced effect is associated with NF-kB activation. Finally, we describe the involvement of PME2 in the induction of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in rat decidual cells. Altogether, our findings highlight the role of COX-2 as a gatekeeper in the uterine environment and clarify the impact of the deregulation of AEA levels on the decidual remodelling process.

Abstract: Protein-bound iron sulfur clusters are prosthetic groups involved in several metabolic pathways. Understanding how they interact with the host protein and which factors influence their stability is therefore an important goal in biology. Here, we have addressed this question by studying the determinants of the 2Fe–2S cluster stability in the IscU/Isu protein scaffold. Through a detailed computational study based on a mixed quantum and classical mechanics approach, we predict that the simultaneous presence of two conserved residues, D39 and H105, has a conflicting role in cluster coordination which results in destabilizing cluster-loaded IscU/Isu according to a ‘tug-of-war’ mechanism. The effect is absent in the D39A mutant already known to host the cluster more stably. Our theoretical conclusions are directly supported by experimental data, also obtained from the H105A mutant, which has properties intermediate between the wild-type and the D39A mutant. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Fe/S proteins: Analysis, structure, function, biogenesis and diseases.

Abstract: Pneumolysin (PLY), a key virulence factor of Streptococcus pneumoniae, permeabilizes eukaryotic cells by forming large trans-membrane pores. PLY imposes a puzzling multitude of diverse, often mutually excluding actions on eukaryotic cells. Whereas cytotoxicity of PLY can be directly attributed to the pore-mediated effects, mechanisms that are responsible for the PLY-induced activation of host cells are poorly understood. We show that PLY pores can be repaired and thereby PLY-induced cell death can be prevented. Pore-induced Ca2+ entry from the extracellular milieu is of paramount importance for the initiation of plasmalemmal repair. Nevertheless, active Ca2+ sequestration that prevents excessive Ca2+ elevation during the execution phase of plasmalemmal repair is of no less importance. The efficacy of plasmalemmal repair does not only define the fate of targeted cells but also intensity, duration and repetitiveness of PLY-induced Ca2+ signals in cells that were able to survive after PLY attack. Intracellular Ca2+ dynamics evoked by the combined action of pore formation and their elimination mimic the pattern of receptor-mediated Ca2+ signaling, which is responsible for the activation of host immune responses. Therefore, we postulate that plasmalemmal repair of PLY pores might provoke cellular responses that are similar to those currently ascribed to the receptor-mediated PLY effects. Our data provide new insights into the understanding of the complexity of cellular non-immune defense responses to a major pneumococcal toxin that plays a critical role in the establishment and the progression of life-threatening diseases. Therapies boosting plasmalemmal repair of host cells and their metabolic fitness might prove beneficial for the treatment of pneumococcal infections. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: 13th European Symposium on Calcium.

Abstract: Phospholipase D (PLD) has been implicated in many physiological functions, such as chemotaxis and phagocytosis, as well as pathological functions, such as cancer cell invasion and metastasis. New inhibitors have been described that hamper the role of PLD in those pathologies but their site of action is not known. We have characterized the biochemical and biological behavior of the PLD1/2 dual inhibitor 5-Fluoro-2-indolyl des-chlorohalopemide (FIPI), and the specific PLD2 inhibitor, N-[2-[1-(3-Fluorophenyl)-4-oxo-1,3,­8-triazaspiro[4.5]dec-8-yl]ethyl]-2-naphthalenecarboxamide (NFOT), and found that both FIPI and NFOT are mixed-kinetics inhibitors. Mutagenesis studies indicate that FIPI binds at S757 of PLD2, which is within the HKD2 catalytic site of the enzyme, whereas NFOT binds to PLD2 at two different sites, one being at S757/S648 and another to an allosteric site that is a natural site occupied by PIP2 (R210/R212). This latter site, along with F244/L245/L246, forms a hydrophobic pocket in the PH domain. The mechanism of action of FIPI is a direct effect on the catalytic site (and as such inhibits both PLD1 and PLD2 isoforms), whereas PLD2 affects both the catalytic site (orthosteric) and blocks PIP2 binding to PLD2 (allosteric), which negates the natural enhancing role of PIP2. Moreover, NFOT prevents cell invasion of cancer cells, which does not occur in cells overexpressing PLD2-F244A/L245A/L246A, or PLD2-R210A/R212A, or PLD2-S757/S648 mutants. This study provides new specific knowledge of enzyme regulation and mechanisms of activation and inhibition of PLD2 that are necessary to understand its role in cell signaling and to develop new inhibitors for cancer cell invasion and metastasis.

Abstract: c-Flip proteins are well-known apoptosis modulators. They generally contribute to tissue homeostasis maintenance by inhibiting death-receptor-mediated cell death. In the present manuscript, we show that c-Flip knock-out (KO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) kept in culture under starvation conditions gradually modify their phenotype and accumulate vacuoles, becoming progressively larger according to the duration of starvation. Large vacuoles are present in KO MEFs though not in WT MEFs, and are Oil Red-O positive, which indicates that they represent lipid droplets. Western blot experiments reveal that, unlike WT MEFs, KO MEFs express high levels of the lipogenic transcription factor PPAR-γ. Lipid droplet accumulation was found to be associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress activation and autophagic modulation valuated by means of BIP increase, LC3 lipidation and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation, and p62 accumulation. Interestingly, XBP-1, an ER stress-induced lipogenic transcription factor, was found to preferentially localize in the nucleus rather than in the cytoplasm of KO MEFs. These data demonstrate that, upon starvation, c-Flip affects lipid accumulation, ER stress and autophagy, thereby pointing to an important role of c-Flip in the adaptive response and ER stress response programs under both normal and pathological conditions.

Abstract: Background: Electronegative LDL (LDL(−)), a modified LDL fraction found in blood, induces the release of inflammatory mediators in endothelial cells and leukocytes. However, the inflammatory pathways activated by LDL(−) have not been fully defined. We aim to study whether LDL(−) induced release of the first-wave proinflammatory IL-1β in monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) and the mechanisms involved. Methods: LDL(−) was isolated from total LDL by anion exchange chromatography. Monocytes and MDM were isolated from healthy donors and stimulated with LDL(+) and LDL(−) (100mgapoB/L). Results: In monocytes, LDL(−) promoted IL-1β release in a time-dependent manner, obtaining at 20h-incubation the double of IL-1β release induced by LDL(−) than by native LDL. LDL(−)-induced IL-1β release involved activation of the CD14-TLR4 receptor complex. LDL(−) induced priming, the first step of IL-1β release, since it increased the transcription of pro-IL-1β (8-fold) and NLRP3 (3-fold) compared to native LDL. Several findings show that LDL(−) induced inflammasome activation, the second step necessary for IL-1β release. Preincubation of monocytes with K+ channel inhibitors decreased LDL(−)-induced IL-1β release. LDL(−) induced formation of the NLRP3-ASC complex. LDL(−) triggered 2-fold caspase-1 activation compared to native LDL and IL-1β release was strongly diminished in the presence of the caspase-1 inhibitor Z-YVAD. In MDM, LDL(−) promoted IL-1β release, which was also associated with caspase-1 activation. Conclusions: LDL(−) promotes release of biologically active IL-1β in monocytes and MDM by induction of the two steps involved: priming and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Significance: By IL-1β release, LDL(−) could regulate inflammation in atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Oval cells constitute an interesting hepatic cell population. They contribute to sustain liver regeneration during chronic liver damage, but in doing this they can be target of malignant conversion and become tumor-initiating cells and drive hepatocarcinogenesis. The molecular mechanisms beneath either their pro-regenerative or pro-tumorigenic potential are still poorly understood. In this study, we have investigated the role of the HGF/c-Met pathway in regulation of oval cell migratory and invasive properties. Our results show that HGF induces c-Met-dependent oval cell migration both in normal culture conditions and after in vitro wounding. HGF-triggered migration involves F-actin cytoskeleton reorganization, which is also evidenced by activation of Rac1. Furthermore, HGF causes ZO-1 translocation from cell–cell contact sites to cytoplasm and its concomitant activation by phosphorylation. However, no loss of expression of cell–cell adhesion proteins, including E-cadherin, ZO-1 and Occludin-1, is observed. Additionally, migration does not lead to cell dispersal but to a characteristic organized pattern in rows, in turn associated with Golgi compaction, providing strong evidence of a morphogenic collective migration. Besides migration, HGF increases oval cell invasion through extracellular matrix, a process that requires PI3K activation and is at least partly mediated by expression and activation of metalloproteases. Altogether, our findings provide novel insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating the essential role of HGF/c-Met signaling during oval cell-mediated mouse liver regeneration.

Abstract: The type II interleukin-4 receptor (IL4R) is expressed in human breast cancer, and in murine models thereof. It is activated by interleukin-4 (IL4), a cytokine produced predominantly by immune cells. Previously, we showed that expression of IL4Rα, a signaling component of IL4R, mediates enhanced metastatic growth through promotion of tumor cell survival and proliferation. In lymphocytes, these processes are supported by increased glucose and glutamine metabolism, and B lymphocyte survival is dependent upon IL4/IL4R-induced glucose metabolism. However, it is unknown whether IL4R-mediated metabolic reprogramming could support tumor growth. Here, we show that IL4Rα expression increases proliferation thus enhancing primary mammary tumor growth. In vitro, IL4-enhanced glucose consumption and lactate production in 4T1 cells was mediated by IL4Rα. Expression of the glucose transporter GLUT1 increased in response to IL4 in vitro, and enhanced GLUT1 expression was associated with the presence of IL4Rα in 4T1 mammary tumors in vivo. Although IL4 treatment did not induce changes in glucose metabolism in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells, it increased expression of the main glutamine transporter, ASCT2, and enhanced glutamine consumption in both MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 cells. Pharmacologic inhibition of glutamine metabolism with compound 968 blocked IL4/IL4Rα-increased cell number in both cell lines. Our results demonstrate that IL4R mediates enhanced glucose and glutamine metabolism in 4T1 cancer cells, and that IL4-induced growth is supported by IL4/IL4R-enhanced glutamine metabolism in both human and murine mammary cancer cells. This highlights IL4Rα as a possible target for effective breast cancer therapy.

Abstract: We previously determined that augmented EGFR tyrosine kinase (EGFRtk) impairs vascular function in type 2 diabetic mouse (TD2). Here we determined that EGFRtk causes vascular dysfunction through NADPH oxidase activity in TD2. Mesenteric resistance arteries (MRA) from C57/BL6 and db−/db− mice were mounted in a wired myograph and pre-incubated for 1h with either EGFRtk inhibitor (AG1478) or exogenous EGF. The inhibition of EGFRtk did not affect the contractile response to phenylephrine-(PE) and thromboxane-(U46619) or endothelium-dependent relaxation (EDR) to acetylcholine in MRA from control group. However, in TD2 mice, AG1478 reduced the contractile response to U46619, improved vasodilatation and reduced p22phox-NADPH expression, but had no effect on the contractile response to PE. The incubation of MRA with exogenous EGF potentiated the contractile response to PE in MRA from control and diabetic mice. However, EGF impaired the EDR and potentiated the vasoconstriction to U46619 only in the control group. Interestingly, NADPH oxidase inhibition in the presence of EGF restored the normal contraction to PE and improved the EDR but had no effect on the potentiated contraction to U46619. Vascular function improvement was associated with the rescue of eNOS and Akt and reduction in phosphorylated Rho-kinase, NOX4 mRNA levels, and NADPH oxidase activity. MRA from p47phox−/− mice incubated with EGF potentiated the contraction to U46619 but had no effect to PE or ACh responses. The present study provides evidence that augmented EGFRtk impairs vascular function by NADPH oxidase-dependent mechanism. Therefore, EGFRtk and oxidative stress should be potential targets to treat vascular dysfunction in TD2.

Abstract: Very Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor (VLDLR) is an apolipoprotein E receptor involved in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. However, it is unknown how VLDLR can regulate synaptic and cognitive function. In the present study, we found that VLDLR is present at the synapse both pre- and post-synaptically. Overexpression of VLDLR significantly increases, while knockdown of VLDLR decreases, dendritic spine number in primary hippocampal cultures. Additionally, knockdown of VLDLR significantly decreases synaptophysin puncta number while differentially regulating cell surface and total levels of glutamate receptor subunits. To identify the mechanism by which VLDLR induces these synaptic effects, we investigated whether VLDLR affects dendritic spine formation through the Ras signaling pathway, which is involved in spinogenesis and neurodegeneration. Interestingly, we found that VLDLR interacts with RasGRF1, a Ras effector, and knockdown of RasGRF1 blocks the effect of VLDLR on spinogenesis. Moreover, we found that VLDLR did not rescue the deficits induced by the absence of Ras signaling proteins CaMKIIα or CaMKIIβ. Taken together, our results suggest that VLDLR requires RasGRF1/CaMKII to alter dendritic spine formation.

Abstract: Cell polarity is a fundamental property of pro- and eukaryotic cells. It is necessary for coordination of cell division, cell morphogenesis and signaling processes. How polarity is generated and maintained is a complex issue governed by interconnected feed-back regulations between small GTPase signaling and membrane tension-based signaling that controls membrane trafficking, and cytoskeleton organization and dynamics. Here, we will review the potential role for calcium as a crucial signal that connects and coordinates the respective processes during polarization processes in plants. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: 13th European Symposium on Calcium.

Abstract: The survival of macrophages depends on the presence of specific cytokines that activate survival signaling events, as well as suppressing formation of apoptosis-inducing pathways. We have previously shown that macrophages deprived of macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) produce ceramide that contributes to apoptosis of these cells, a pathway that is suppressed by exposure to oxidized LDL. In this study we have examined macrophages derived from mice lacking acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) to ask whether these events are altered due to the impaired ability of these cells to break down sphingomyelin and produce ceramide. We found that these cells do survive better than cells from wild type mice, but they still undergo cell death and some ceramide is formed. We show that the ceramide is being produced by a de novo synthetic pathway. Therefore, ceramide production in M-CSF-deprived macrophages arises from a combination of ASMase activity and de novo synthesis.

Abstract: The triphenylethylene antiestrogen, tamoxifen, can be an effective inhibitor of sphingolipid metabolism. This off-target activity makes tamoxifen an interesting ancillary for boosting the apoptosis-inducing properties of ceramide, a sphingolipid with valuable tumor censoring activity. Here we show for the first time that tamoxifen and metabolite, N-desmethyltamoxifen (DMT), block ceramide glycosylation and inhibit ceramide hydrolysis (by acid ceramidase, AC) in human acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cell lines and in AML cells derived from patients. Tamoxifen (1–10μM) inhibition of AC in AML cells was accompanied by decreases in AC protein expression. Tamoxifen also depressed expression and activity of sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1), the enzyme-catalyzing production of mitogenic sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1-P). Results from mass spectroscopy showed that tamoxifen and DMT (i) increased the levels of endogenous C16:0 and C24:1 ceramide molecular species, (ii) nearly totally halted production of respective glucosylceramide (GC) molecular species, (iii) drastically reduced levels of sphingosine (to 9% of control), and (iv) reduced levels of S1-P by 85%, in vincristine-resistant HL-60/VCR cells. The co-administration of tamoxifen with either N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (4-HPR), a ceramide-generating retinoid, or a cell-deliverable form of ceramide, C6-ceramide, resulted in marked decreases in HL-60/VCR cell viability that far exceeded single agent potency. Combination treatments resulted in synergistic apoptotic cell death as gauged by increased Annexin V binding and DNA fragmentation and activation of caspase-3. These results show the versatility of adjuvant triphenylethylene with ceramide-centric therapies for magnifying therapeutic potential in AML. Such drug regimens could serve as effective strategies, even in the multidrug-resistant setting.

Extra-hepatic metabolism of 7-ketocholesterol occurs by esterification to fatty acids via cPLA2α and SOAT1 followed by selective efflux to HDL,

Abstract: Accumulation of 7-ketocholesterol (7KCh) in tissues has been previously associated with various chronic aging diseases. Orally ingested 7KCh is readily metabolized by the liver and does not pose a toxicity threat. However, 7KCh formed in situ, usually associated with lipoprotein deposits, can adversely affect surrounding tissues by causing inflammation and cytotoxicity. In this study we have investigated various mechanisms for extra-hepatic metabolism of 7KCh (e.g. hydroxylation, sulfation) and found only esterification to fatty acids. The esterification of 7KCh to fatty acids involves the combined action of cytosolic phospholipase A2 alpha (cPLA2α) and sterol O-acyltransferase (SOAT1). Inhibition of either one of these enzymes ablates 7KCh-fatty acid ester (7KFAE) formation. The 7KFAEs are not toxic and do not induce inflammatory responses. However, they can be unstable and re-release 7KCh. The higher the degree of unsaturation, the more unstable the 7KFAE (e.g. 18:0>18:1>18:2>18:3≫20:4). Biochemical inhibition and siRNA knockdown of SOAT1 and cPLA2α ablated the 7KFAE synthesis in cultured ARPE19 cells, but had little effect on the 7KCh-induced inflammatory response. Overexpression of SOAT1 reduced the 7KCh-induced inflammatory response and provided some protection from cell death. This effect is likely due to the increased conversion of 7KCh to 7KFAEs, which reduced the intracellular 7KCh levels. Addition of HDL selectively increased the efflux of 7KFAEs and enhanced the effect of SOAT1 overexpression. Our data suggests an additional function for HDL in aiding extra-hepatic tissues to eliminate 7KCh by returning 7KFAEs to the liver for bile acid formation.

Abstract: RapGEF1 (C3G) is a ubiquitously expressed protein that is essential for mammalian embryonic development. We have shown earlier that C3G regulates cytoskeletal dynamics and is required for neuronal differentiation. To determine if C3G plays a wider role in differentiation of multiple tissue types, we examined its role in skeletal muscle differentiation using the model system of C2C12 cells in culture. C3G protein is highly expressed in mouse skeletal muscle and its transcript and protein levels increase as C2C12 cells are induced to differentiate. Increase in C3G was predominantly seen in the nuclei of myotubes. Ectopic expression of C3G promoted myotube formation when cells were cultured in growth as well as differentiation medium and, enhanced MHC levels were associated with C3G expression. C3G induced differentiation required its catalytic and protein interaction domains and was dependent on the function of cellular R-Ras. Knockdown of cellular C3G using small hairpin RNA reduced expression of muscle specific markers and β-catenin, resulting in impaired differentiation. Disabling C3G function also resulted in enhanced cell death suggesting that cellular C3G is required for cell survival. In cells grown in growth medium, over-expressed C3G increased Akt activity, and C3G knockdown reduced it. C3G expression also suppressed cyclin D1 levels, and induced p27 expression, molecules involved in regulating cell proliferation. Endogenous C3G localizes to focal adhesions in myotubes and C3G expressing cells show distinct stress fibers, elongation and parallel alignment. Expression of a dominant negative construct of C3G, disrupts actin cytoskeleton and formation of focal adhesions resulting in detachment of cells from the substratum and inhibition of differentiation. Our results provide evidence that C3G plays an important role in myogenic differentiation by coordinating cell cycle exit, actin dynamics and survival signaling.

Abstract: Proliferation analysis is one of the basic approaches to characterize various cell types. In conventional cell proliferation assays, the same sample cannot be observed over time, nor can a specific group within a heterogeneous population of cells, for example, cancerous cells, be analyzed separately. To overcome these limitations, we established an optical labeling-based proliferation assay system with the Kaede protein, whose fluorescence can be irreversibly photoconverted from green to red by irradiation. After a single non-toxic photoconversion event, the intensity of red fluorescence in each cell is reduced by cell division. From this, we developed a simple method to quantify cell proliferation by monitoring reduction of red fluorescence over time. This study shows that the optical labeling-based proliferation assay is a viable novel method to analyze cell proliferation, and could enhance our understanding of mechanisms regulating cell proliferation machinery. We used this newly established system to analyze the functions of secreted interleukin-6 (IL-6) in cancer cell proliferation, which had not been fully characterized. Reduction in proliferation was observed following IL-6 knockdown. However, after co-culturing with IL-6-expressing cells, the proliferation of Kaede-labeled IL-6-knockdown cells was restored. These data indicate that in basal-like breast cancer cells, IL-6 exhibits a paracrine effect to positively regulate cell proliferation. Our results thus demonstrate that cancer cells can secrete signaling molecules, such as IL-6, to support the proliferation of other cancer cells.

FSL was found to hydrolyze at high rates of synthetic medium chains monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (4658±146U/mg on DiC8-MGDG) and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (3785±83U/mg on DiC8-DGDG) and natural long chain monogalactosyldiacylglycerol extracted from leek leaves (991±85U/mg). It is the microbial enzyme with the highest activity on galactolipids identified so far with a level of activity comparable to that of pancreatic lipase-related protein 2. FSL maximum activity on galactolipids was measured at pH8. The analysis of the hydrolysis product of natural MGDG from leek showed that FSL hydrolyzes preferentially the ester bond at the sn-1 position of galactolipids. To investigate the structure–activity relationships of FSL, a 3D model of this enzyme was built. In silico docking of medium chains MGDG and DGDG and phospholipid in the active site of FSL reveals structural solutions which are in concordance with in vitro tests.

Abstract: G proteins are fundamental elements in signal transduction involved in key cell responses, and their interactions with cell membrane lipids are critical events whose nature is not fully understood. Here, we have studied how the presence of myristic and palmitic acid moieties affects the interaction of the Gαi1 protein with model and biological membranes. For this purpose, we quantified the binding of purified Gαi1 protein and Gαi1 protein acylation mutants to model membranes, with lipid compositions that resemble different membrane microdomains. We observed that myristic and palmitic acids not only act as membrane anchors but also regulate Gαi1 subunit interaction with lipids characteristics of certain membrane microdomains. Thus, when the Gαi1 subunit contains both fatty acids it prefers raft-like lamellar membranes, with a high sphingomyelin and cholesterol content and little phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine. By contrast, the myristoylated and non-palmitoylated Gαi1 subunit prefers other types of ordered lipid microdomains with higher phosphatidylserine content. These results in part explain the mobility of Gαi1 protein upon reversible palmitoylation to meet one or another type of signaling protein partner. These results also serve as an example of how membrane lipid alterations can change membrane signaling or how membrane lipid therapy can regulate the cell's physiology.

Abstract: Little is known about the effects of fatty acids on adiponectin oligomer assembly and trafficking. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of different fatty acids on adiponectin transport and secretion in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that the majority of cellular adiponectin was located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Adiponectin secretion was increased by treatment with fatty acids, including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and several fatty acids changed the cellular localization of adiponectin. Adiponectin secretion has been shown to be altered by ER stress and interactions with ER chaperone proteins. However these mechanisms were not influenced by fatty acids, suggesting that alternative mechanisms must be responsible for the increased secretion of adiponectin observed with fatty acid treatment. Secretion of adiponectin was blocked by Brefeldin A, but we identified a minor pool of adiponectin that could be secreted from beyond the Brefeldin A block. Exosomes appeared to contribute to a minor amount of adiponectin secreted from the cell, and exosome release was increased by treatment with DHA. These data suggest that the ER is an important site of adiponectin accumulation and that treatment with long chain omega-3 fatty acids increases adiponectin release. Furthermore, the secretory pathway of adiponectin is complex, involving both the classical ER–Golgi pathway as well as unconventional secretory mechanisms such as an exosome-mediated pathway.

Molecular mechanism of dietary phospholipid requirement of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, fry,

Abstract: The phospholipid (PL) requirement in fish is revealed by enhanced performance when larvae are provided PL-enriched diets. To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying PL requirement in Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, were fed a minimal PL diet and tissue samples from major lipid metabolic sites were dissected from fry and parr. In silico analysis and cloning techniques demonstrated that salmon possess a full set of enzymes for the endogenous production of PL. The gene expression data indicated that major PL biosynthetic genes of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho), phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) and phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) display lower expression in intestine during the early developmental stage (fry). This is consistent with the hypothesis that the intestine of salmon is immature at the early developmental stage with limited capacity for endogenous PL biosynthesis. The results also indicate that intact PtdCho, PtdEtn and PtdIns are required in the diet at this stage. PtdCho and sphingomyelin constitute the predominant PL in chylomicrons, involved in the transport of dietary lipids from the intestine to the rest of the body. As sphingomyelin can be produced from PtdCho in intestine of fry, our findings suggest that supplementation of dietary PtdCho alone during early developmental stages of Atlantic salmon would be sufficient to promote chylomicron formation. This would support efficient transport of dietary lipids, including PL precursors, from the intestine to the liver where biosynthesis of PtdEtn, PtdSer, and PtdIns is not compromised as in intestine facilitating efficient utilisation of dietary energy and the endogenous production of membrane PL for the rapidly growing and developing animal.
