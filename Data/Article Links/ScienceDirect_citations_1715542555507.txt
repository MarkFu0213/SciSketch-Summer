Abstract: Summary
Tumor-associated tertiary lymphoid structures (TA-TLS) are associated with enhanced patient survival and responsiveness to cancer therapies, but the mechanisms underlying their development are unknown. We show here that TA-TLS development in murine melanoma is orchestrated by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) with characteristics of lymphoid tissue organizer cells that are induced by tumor necrosis factor receptor signaling. CAF organization into reticular networks is mediated by CD8 T cells, while CAF accumulation and TA-TLS expansion depend on CXCL13-mediated recruitment of B cells expressing lymphotoxin-α1β2. Some of these elements are also overrepresented in human TA-TLS. Additionally, we demonstrate that immunotherapy induces more and larger TA-TLS that are more often organized with discrete T and B cell zones, and that TA-TLS presence, number, and size are correlated with reduced tumor size and overall response to checkpoint immunotherapy. This work provides a platform for manipulating TA-TLS development as a cancer immunotherapy strategy.

Abstract: Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing antifungal resistance is crucial for identifying new cellular targets for developing new antifungal therapeutics. In this study, we performed a transposon-mediated genome-wide genetic screen in haploid Candida albicans to identify mutants resistant to caspofungin, the first member of the echinocandin class of antifungal drugs. A mutant exhibiting the highest resistance possessed a transposon insertion that inactivates GPI7, a gene encoding the mannose-ethanolamine phosphotransferase. Deleting GPI7 in diploid C. albicans caused similar caspofungin resistance. gpi7Δ/Δ cells showed significantly elevated cell wall chitin content and enhanced phosphorylation of Mkc1, a core component of the PKC-MAPK cell-wall integrity pathway. Deleting MKC1 suppressed the chitin elevation and caspofungin resistance of gpi7Δ/Δ cells, but overexpressing the dominant inactive form of RHO1, an upstream activator of PKC-MAPK signaling, did not. Transcriptome analysis uncovered 406 differentially expressed genes in gpi7Δ/Δ cells, many related to cell wall construction. Our results suggest that GPI7 deletion impairs cell wall integrity, which triggers the cell-wall salvage mechanism via the PKC-MAPK pathway independently of Rho1, resulting in the compensatory chitin synthesis to confer caspofungin resistance.

Abstract: During spermatogenesis, the transition from histone to protamine is highly conserved in most invertebrates and vertebrates. Thus far, a large and growing body of literature has demonstrated that histones and histone modifications still exist in the sperm nucleus of decapod crustaceans. H4Kac is believed to play an important role in the process of sperm chromatin condensation. However, the dynamics of hyperacetylated histone H4 (H4Kac) during spermatogenesis in decapoda are still unknown. In this paper, the distribution of H4Kac in four decapod crustaceans (Eriocheir sinensis, Charybdis japonica, Procambarus clarkii, and Macrobrachium nipponense) were investigated via immunofluorescence. Our results indicated that H4Kac was visible in the mature sperm nucleus of E. sinensis, C. japonica, and M. nipponense. Unlike the other three species, H4Kac was translocated from the nuclei to cytoplasm in mid-spermatids of P. clarkii. Eventually, H4Kac were not present in mature spermatozoa of P. clarkii. Importantly, we observed for the first time that H4Kac was distributed outside the nucleus, which reminds us that H4Kac may participate in the formation of acrosome structure in decapod crustaceans and may be a prerequisite for proper chromatin decondensation.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanical stimuli including loading after birth promote bone growth. However, little is known about how mechanical force triggers biochemical signals to regulate bone growth. Here, we identified a periosteal-osteoblast-derived secretory peptide, Osteocrin (OSTN), as a mechanotransducer involved in load-induced long bone growth. OSTN produced by periosteal osteoblasts regulates growth plate growth by enhancing C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP)-dependent proliferation and maturation of chondrocytes, leading to elongation of long bones. Additionally, OSTN cooperates with CNP to regulate bone formation. CNP stimulates osteogenic differentiation of periosteal osteoprogenitors to induce bone formation. OSTN binds to natriuretic peptide receptor 3 (NPR3) in periosteal osteoprogenitors, thereby preventing NPR3-mediated clearance of CNP and consequently facilitating CNP-signal-mediated bone growth. Importantly, physiological loading induces Ostn expression in periosteal osteoblasts by suppressing Forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1) transcription factor. Thus, this study reveals a crucial role of OSTN as a mechanotransducer converting mechanical loading to CNP-dependent bone formation.

Abstract: Summary
Phosphoinositides are important molecules in lipid signaling, membrane identity, and trafficking that are spatiotemporally controlled by factors from both mammalian cells and intracellular pathogens. Here, using small interfering RNA (siRNA) directed against phosphoinositide kinases and phosphatases, we screen for regulators of the host innate defense response to intracellular bacterial replication. We identify SAC1, a transmembrane phosphoinositide phosphatase, as an essential regulator of xenophagy. Depletion or inactivation of SAC1 compromises fusion between Salmonella-containing autophagosomes and lysosomes, leading to increased bacterial replication. Mechanistically, the loss of SAC1 results in aberrant accumulation of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate [PI(4)P] on Salmonella-containing autophagosomes, thus facilitating recruitment of SteA, a PI(4)P-binding Salmonella effector protein, which impedes lysosomal fusion. Replication of Salmonella lacking SteA is suppressed by SAC-1-deficient cells, however, demonstrating bacterial adaptation to xenophagy. Our findings uncover a paradigm in which a host protein regulates the level of its substrate and impairs the function of a bacterial effector during xenophagy.

Abstract: Summary
Many neurological disorders show an increased prevalence of GluA2-lacking, Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs), which dramatically alters synaptic function. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this distinct synaptic plasticity remains enigmatic. Here, we show that nerve injury potentiates postsynaptic, but not presynaptic, CP-AMPARs in the spinal dorsal horn via α2δ-1. Overexpressing α2δ-1, previously regarded as a Ca2+ channel subunit, augments CP-AMPAR levels at the cell surface and synapse. Mechanistically, α2δ-1 physically interacts with both GluA1 and GluA2 via its C terminus, inhibits the GluA1/GluA2 heteromeric assembly, and increases GluA2 retention in the endoplasmic reticulum. Consequently, α2δ-1 diminishes the availability and synaptic expression of GluA1/GluA2 heterotetramers in the spinal cord in neuropathic pain. Inhibiting α2δ-1 with gabapentin or disrupting the α2δ-1-AMPAR complex fully restores the intracellular assembly and synaptic dominance of heteromeric GluA1/GluA2 receptors. Thus, α2δ-1 is a pivotal AMPAR-interacting protein that controls the subunit composition and Ca2+ permeability of postsynaptic AMPARs.

Abstract: Summary
Upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) is one of the common urothelial cancers. Its molecular pathogenesis, however, is poorly understood, with no useful biomarkers available for accurate diagnosis and molecular classification. Through an integrated genetic study involving 199 UTUC samples, we delineate the landscape of genetic alterations in UTUC enabling genetic/molecular classification. According to the mutational status of TP53, MDM2, RAS, and FGFR3, UTUC is classified into five subtypes having discrete profiles of gene expression, tumor location/histology, and clinical outcome, which is largely recapitulated in an independent UTUC cohort. Sequencing of urine sediment-derived DNA has a high diagnostic value for UTUC with 82.2% sensitivity and 100% specificity. These results provide a solid basis for better diagnosis and management of UTUC.

Abstract: Summary
An effective combination of multi-omic datasets can enhance our understanding of complex biological phenomena. To build a context-dependent network with multiple omic layers, i.e., a trans-omic network, we perform phosphoproteomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics of murine liver for 4 h after insulin administration and integrate the resulting time series. Structural characteristics and dynamic nature of the network are analyzed to elucidate the impact of insulin. Early and prominent changes in protein phosphorylation and persistent and asynchronous changes in mRNA and protein levels through non-transcriptional mechanisms indicate enhanced crosstalk between phosphorylation-mediated signaling and protein expression regulation. Metabolic response shows different temporal regulation with transient increases at early time points across categories and enhanced response in the amino acid and nucleotide categories at later time points as a result of process convergence. This extensive and dynamic view of the trans-omic network elucidates prominent regulatory mechanisms that drive insulin responses through intricate interlayer coordination.

Abstract: Background
This research study explores the effect of miR-361 on the activation of immortalized human and mice hepatic stallate cells (HSCs).
Methods
10 liver specimens from healthy volunteers and 20 HBV-relevant HCC tissues from patients. The expressions of miR-361 in HCC patients, HBx transgenic mice, HCC cell lines expressing HBx, and human and mouse HSCs were detected. The influences of miR-361 on the biological processes of HSCs were explored. The target of miR-361 and the effects of p65 on miR-361 were also verified and analyzed.
Results
Microarray analysis and quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) indicated that miR-361 was decreased in HBV-relevant HCC tissues, HBx transgenic mice, HBx-transfected HepG2 cells, human and mice HSCs. Bio-informatics prediction and dual-luciferase reporter assay (DLRA) suggested that nuclear factor kappa B subunit p65 gene was a target of miR-361. Furthermore, this study showed that p65 expression was upregulated in the HBV-relevant HCC tissues, HBx transgenic mice, HBx-transfected HepG2 cells. MiR-361 upregulation also caused a reduction in p65 expression in both human and mice HSCs. In addition, p65 overexpression counteracted the effect of miR-361 in human and mice HSCs' biological processes. These findings reveal a latent mechanism underlying p65 modulation by miR-361 which is capable of initiating HSC growth and migration.
Conclusion
miR-361 is potentially functioning as a potent marker for HBV-relevant HCC development or liver fibrosis (LF) progression.

Abstract: Summary
αvβ8 integrin, a key activator of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), inhibits anti-tumor immunity. We show that a potent blocking monoclonal antibody against αvβ8 (ADWA-11) causes growth suppression or complete regression in syngeneic models of squamous cell carcinoma, mammary cancer, colon cancer, and prostate cancer, especially when combined with other immunomodulators or radiotherapy. αvβ8 is expressed at the highest levels in CD4+CD25+ T cells in tumors, and specific deletion of β8 from T cells is as effective as ADWA-11 in suppressing tumor growth. ADWA-11 increases expression of a suite of genes in tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells normally inhibited by TGF-β and involved in tumor cell killing, including granzyme B and interferon-γ. The in vitro cytotoxic effect of tumor CD8 T cells is inhibited by CD4+CD25+ cells, and this suppressive effect is blocked by ADWA-11. These findings solidify αvβ8 integrin as a promising target for cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Naive human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have been isolated that more closely resemble the pre-implantation epiblast compared to conventional “primed” hESCs, but the signaling principles underlying these discrete stem cell states remain incompletely understood. Here, we describe the results from a high-throughput screen using ∼3,000 well-annotated compounds to identify essential signaling requirements for naive human pluripotency. We report that MEK1/2 inhibitors can be replaced during maintenance of naive human pluripotency by inhibitors targeting either upstream (FGFR, RAF) or downstream (ERK1/2) kinases. Naive hESCs maintained under these alternative conditions display elevated levels of ERK phosphorylation but retain genome-wide DNA hypomethylation and a transcriptional identity of the pre-implantation epiblast. In contrast, dual inhibition of MEK and ERK promotes efficient primed-to-naive resetting in combination with PKC, ROCK, and TNKS inhibitors and activin A. This work demonstrates that induction and maintenance of naive human pluripotency are governed by distinct signaling requirements.

Abstract: Summary
Sustained activation of the Ca2+-release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channel is pivotal for effector T cell responses. The mechanisms underlying this sustainability remain poorly understood. We find that plasma membrane localization of ORAI1, the pore subunit of CRAC channels, is limited in effector T cells, with a significant fraction trapped in intracellular vesicles. From a targeted screen, we identify an essential component of ORAI1+ vesicles, naked cuticle homolog 2 (NKD2). Mechanistically, NKD2, an adaptor molecule activated by signaling pathways downstream of T cell receptors, orchestrates trafficking and insertion of ORAI1+ vesicles to the plasma membrane. Together, our findings suggest that T cell receptor (TCR)-stimulation-dependent insertion of ORAI1 into the plasma membrane is essential for sustained Ca2+ signaling and cytokine production in T cells.

Abstract: Summary
NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent Ca2+ influx underpins multiple forms of synaptic plasticity. Most synaptic NMDAR currents in the adult forebrain are mediated by GluN2A-containing receptors, which are rapidly inserted into synapses during long-term potentiation (LTP); however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we show that GluN2A is phosphorylated at Ser-1459 by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIα (CaMKIIα) in response to glycine stimulation that mimics LTP in primary neurons. Phosphorylation of Ser-1459 promotes GluN2A interaction with the sorting nexin 27 (SNX27)-retromer complex, thereby enhancing the endosomal recycling of NMDARs. Loss of SNX27 or CaMKIIα function blocks the glycine-induced increase in GluN2A-NMDARs on the neuronal membrane. Interestingly, mutations of Ser-1459, including the rare S1459G human epilepsy variant, prolong the decay times of NMDAR-mediated synaptic currents in heterosynapses by increasing the duration of channel opening. These findings not only identify a critical role of Ser-1459 phosphorylation in regulating the function of NMDARs, but they also explain how the S1459G variant dysregulates NMDAR function.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular senescence is characterized as a stable proliferation arrest that can be triggered by multiple stresses. Most knowledge about senescent cells is obtained from studies in primary cells. However, senescence features may be different in cancer cells, since the pathways that are involved in senescence induction are often deregulated in cancer. We report here a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome and senolytic responses in a panel of 13 cancer cell lines rendered senescent by two distinct compounds. We show that in cancer cells, the response to senolytic agents and the composition of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype are more influenced by the cell of origin than by the senescence trigger. Using machine learning, we establish the SENCAN gene expression classifier for the detection of senescence in cancer cell samples. The expression profiles and senescence classifier are available as an interactive online Cancer SENESCopedia.

Abstract: Summary
Marmosets are an increasingly important model system for neuroscience in part due to genetic tractability and enhanced cortical accessibility, due to a lissencephalic neocortex. However, many of the techniques generally employed to record neural activity in primates inhibit the expression of natural behaviors in marmosets precluding neurophysiological insights. To address this challenge, we have developed methods for recording neural population activity in unrestrained marmosets across multiple ethological behaviors, multiple brain states, and over multiple years. Notably, our flexible methodological design allows for replacing electrode arrays and removal of implants providing alternative experimental endpoints. We validate the method by recording sensorimotor cortical population activity in freely moving marmosets across their natural behavioral repertoire and during sleep.

Abstract: Summary
The novel betacoronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes a form of severe pneumonia disease called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To develop human neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, antibody gene libraries from convalescent COVID-19 patients were constructed and recombinant antibody fragments (scFv) against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein were selected by phage display. The antibody STE90-C11 shows a subnanometer IC50 in a plaque-based live SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay. The in vivo efficacy of the antibody is demonstrated in the Syrian hamster and in the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) mice model. The crystal structure of STE90-C11 Fab in complex with SARS-CoV-2-RBD is solved at 2.0 Å resolution showing that the antibody binds at the same region as ACE2 to RBD. The binding and inhibition of STE90-C11 is not blocked by many known emerging RBD mutations. STE90-C11-derived human IgG1 with FcγR-silenced Fc (COR-101) is undergoing Phase Ib/II clinical trials for the treatment of moderate to severe COVID-19.

Abstract: Summary
Normal neurodevelopment relies on intricate signaling pathways that balance neural stem cell (NSC) self-renewal, maturation, and survival. Disruptions lead to neurodevelopmental disorders, including microcephaly. Here, we implicate the inhibition of NSC senescence as a mechanism underlying neurogenesis and corticogenesis. We report that the receptor for activated C kinase (Rack1), a family member of WD40-repeat (WDR) proteins, is highly enriched in NSCs. Deletion of Rack1 in developing cortical progenitors leads to a microcephaly phenotype. Strikingly, the absence of Rack1 decreases neurogenesis and promotes a cellular senescence phenotype in NSCs. Mechanistically, the senescence-related p21 signaling pathway is dramatically activated in Rack1 null NSCs, and removal of p21 significantly rescues the Rack1-knockout phenotype in vivo. Finally, Rack1 directly interacts with Smad3 to suppress the activation of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β/Smad signaling pathway, which plays a critical role in p21-mediated senescence. Our data implicate Rack1-driven inhibition of p21-induced NSC senescence as a critical mechanism behind normal cortical development.

Abstract: Summary
Large-scale studies of human gut microbiomes have revealed broad differences in composition across geographically distinct populations. Yet, studies examining impacts of microbiome composition on various health outcomes typically focus on single populations, posing the question of whether compositional differences between populations translate into differences in susceptibility. Using germ-free mice humanized with microbiome samples from 30 donors representing three countries, we observe robust differences in susceptibility to Citrobacter rodentium, a model for enteropathogenic Escherichia coli infections, according to geographic origin. We do not see similar responses to Listeria monocytogenes infections. We further find that cohousing the most susceptible and most resistant mice confers protection from C. rodentium infection. This work underscores the importance of increasing global participation in microbiome studies related to health outcomes. Diverse cohorts are needed to identify both population-specific responses to specific microbiome interventions and to achieve broader-reaching biological conclusions that generalize across populations.

Abstract: Summary
Astrocytes are a viable source for generating new neurons via direct conversion. However, little is known about the neurogenic cascades triggered in astrocytes from different regions of the CNS. Here, we examine the transcriptome induced by the proneural factors Ascl1 and Neurog2 in spinal cord-derived astrocytes in vitro. Each factor initially elicits different neurogenic programs that later converge to a V2 interneuron-like state. Intriguingly, patch sequencing (patch-seq) shows no overall correlation between functional properties and the transcriptome of the heterogenous induced neurons, except for K-channels. For example, some neurons with fully mature electrophysiological properties still express astrocyte genes, thus calling for careful molecular and functional analysis. Comparing the transcriptomes of spinal cord- and cerebral-cortex-derived astrocytes reveals profound differences, including developmental patterning cues maintained in vitro. These relate to the distinct neuronal identity elicited by Ascl1 and Neurog2 reflecting their developmental functions in subtype specification of the respective CNS region.

Abstract: Summary
Patient-derived tumor organoids (TOs) are emerging as high-fidelity models to study cancer biology and develop novel precision medicine therapeutics. However, utilizing TOs for systems-biology-based approaches has been limited by a lack of scalable and reproducible methods to develop and profile these models. We describe a robust pan-cancer TO platform with chemically defined media optimized on cultures acquired from over 1,000 patients. Crucially, we demonstrate tumor genetic and transcriptomic concordance utilizing this approach and further optimize defined minimal media for organoid initiation and propagation. Additionally, we demonstrate a neural-network-based high-throughput approach for label-free, light-microscopy-based drug assays capable of predicting patient-specific heterogeneity in drug responses with applicability across solid cancers. The pan-cancer platform, molecular data, and neural-network-based drug assay serve as resources to accelerate the broad implementation of organoid models in precision medicine research and personalized therapeutic profiling programs.

Abstract: Summary
DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are repaired mainly by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR). RIF1 negatively regulates resection through the effector Shieldin, which associates with a short 3′ single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) overhang by the MRN (MRE11-RAD50-NBS1) complex, to prevent further resection and HR repair. In this study, we show that RIF1, but not Shieldin, inhibits the accumulation of CtIP at DSB sites immediately after damage, suggesting that RIF1 has another effector besides Shieldin. We find that protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), a known RIF1 effector in replication, localizes at damage sites dependent on RIF1, where it suppresses downstream CtIP accumulation and limits the resection by the MRN complex. PP1 therefore acts as a RIF1 effector distinct from Shieldin. Furthermore, PP1 deficiency in the context of Shieldin depletion elevates HR immediately after irradiation. We conclude that PP1 inhibits resection before the action of Shieldin to prevent precocious HR in the early phase of the damage response.

Abstract: Vesicle-associated membrane proteins 721 and 722 (VAMP721/722) are secretory vesicle-localized arginine-conserved soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (R-SNAREs) to drive exocytosis in plants. They are involved in diverse physiological processes in plants by interacting with distinct plasma membrane (PM) syntaxins. Here, we show that synaptotagmin 5 (SYT5) is involved in plant defense against Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato (Pst) DC3000 by regulating SYP132-VAMP721/722 interactions. Calcium-dependent stimulation of in vitro SYP132-VAMP722 interaction by SYT5 and reduced in vivo SYP132-VAMP721/722 interaction in syt5 plants suggest that SYT5 regulates the interaction between SYP132 and VAMP721/722. We interestingly found that disease resistance to Pst DC3000 bacterium but not to Erysiphe pisi fungus is compromised in syt5 plants. Since SYP132 plays an immune function to bacteria, elevated growth of surface-inoculated Pst DC3000 in VAMP721/722-deficient plants suggests that SYT5 contributes to plant immunity to Pst DC3000 by promoting the SYP132-VAMP721/722 immune secretory pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer heterogeneity impacts therapeutic response, driving efforts to discover over-arching rules that supersede variability. Here, we define pan-cancer binary classes based on distinct expression of YAP and YAP-responsive adhesion regulators. Combining informatics with in vivo and in vitro gain- and loss-of-function studies across multiple murine and human tumor types, we show that opposite pro- or anti-cancer YAP activity functionally defines binary YAPon or YAPoff cancer classes that express or silence YAP, respectively. YAPoff solid cancers are neural/neuroendocrine and frequently RB1−/−, such as retinoblastoma, small cell lung cancer, and neuroendocrine prostate cancer. YAP silencing is intrinsic to the cell of origin, or acquired with lineage switching and drug resistance. The binary cancer groups exhibit distinct YAP-dependent adhesive behavior and pharmaceutical vulnerabilities, underscoring clinical relevance. Mechanistically, distinct YAP/TEAD enhancers in YAPoff or YAPon cancers deploy anti-cancer integrin or pro-cancer proliferative programs, respectively. YAP is thus pivotal across cancer, but in opposite ways, with therapeutic implications.

Abstract: Summary
Memory B cells seem to be more durable than antibodies and thus crucial for the long-term immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Here we investigate SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific memory B cells and their dependence on CD4+ T cell help in different settings of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Compared with severely ill individuals, those who recovered from mild COVID-19 develop fewer but functionally superior spike-specific memory B cells. Generation and affinity maturation of these cells is best associated with IL-21+CD4+ T cells in recovered individuals and CD40L+CD4+ T cells in severely ill individuals. The increased activation and exhaustion of memory B cells observed during COVID-19 correlates with CD4+ T cell functions. Intriguingly, CD4+ T cells recognizing membrane protein show a stronger association with spike-specific memory B cells than those recognizing spike or nucleocapsid proteins. Overall, we identify CD4+ T cell subsets associated with the generation of B cell memory during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Abstract: Summary
Fibroblasts display extensive transcriptional heterogeneity, yet functional annotation and characterization of their heterocellular relationships remains incomplete. Using mass cytometry, we chart the stromal composition of 18 murine tissues and 5 spontaneous tumor models, with an emphasis on mesenchymal phenotypes. This analysis reveals extensive stromal heterogeneity across tissues and tumors, and identifies coordinated relationships between mesenchymal and immune cell subsets in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Expression of CD105 demarks two stable and functionally distinct pancreatic fibroblast lineages, which are also identified in murine and human healthy tissues and tumors. Whereas CD105-positive pancreatic fibroblasts are permissive for tumor growth in vivo, CD105-negative fibroblasts are highly tumor suppressive. This restrictive effect is entirely dependent on functional adaptive immunity. Collectively, these results reveal two functionally distinct pancreatic fibroblast lineages and highlight the importance of mesenchymal and immune cell interactions in restricting tumor growth.

Abstract: Summary
RNA-binding proteins play important roles in X-linked intellectual disability (XLID). In this study, we investigate the contribution of the XLID-associated RBMX in neuronal differentiation. We show that RBMX-depleted cells exhibit aberrant activation of the p53 pathway. Moreover, we identify that the RBMX RGG/RG motif is methylated by protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), and this regulates assembly with the SRSF1 splicing factor into higher-order complexes. Depletion of RBMX or disruption of the RBMX/SRSF1 complex in PRMT5-depleted cells reduces SRSF1 binding to the MDM4 precursor (pre-)mRNA, leading to exon 6 exclusion and lower MDM4 protein levels. Transcriptomic analysis of isogenic Shashi-XLID human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) generated using CRISPR-Cas9 reveals a dysregulation of MDM4 splicing and aberrant p53 upregulation. Shashi-XLID neural progenitor cells (NPCs) display differentiation and morphological abnormalities accompanied with excessive apoptosis. Our findings identify RBMX as a regulator of SRSF1 and the p53 pathway, suggesting that the loss of function of the RBMX RGG/RG motif is the cause of Shashi-XLID syndrome.

Abstract: REF52 fibroblasts have a well-developed contractile machinery, the most prominent elements of which are actomyosin stress fibers with highly ordered organization of actin and myosin IIA filaments. The relationship between contractile activity and turnover dynamics of stress fibers is not sufficiently understood. Here, we simultaneously measured the forces exerted by stress fibers (using traction force microscopy or micropillar array sensors) and the dynamics of actin and myosin (using photoconversion-based monitoring of actin incorporation and high-resolution fluorescence microscopy of myosin II light chain). Our data revealed new features of the crosstalk between myosin II-driven contractility and stress fiber dynamics. During normal stress fiber turnover, actin incorporated all along the stress fibers and not only at focal adhesions. Incorporation of actin into stress fibers/focal adhesions, as well as actin and myosin II filaments flow along stress fibers, strongly depends on myosin II activity. Myosin II-dependent generation of traction forces does not depend on incorporation of actin into stress fibers per se, but still requires formin activity. This previously overlooked function of formins in maintenance of the actin cytoskeleton connectivity could be the main mechanism of formin involvement in traction force generation.

Abstract: Summary
Both tumors and aging alter the immune landscape of tissues. These interactions may play an important role in tumor progression among elderly patients and may suggest considerations for patient care. We leverage large-scale genomic and clinical databases to perform comprehensive comparative analysis of molecular and cellular markers of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) response with patient age. These analyses demonstrate that aging is associated with increased tumor mutational burden, increased expression and decreased promoter methylation of immune checkpoint genes, and increased interferon gamma signaling in older patients in many cancer types studied, all of which are expected to promote ICB efficacy. Concurrently, we observe age-related alterations that might be expected to reduce ICB efficacy, such as decreases in T cell receptor diversity. Altogether, these changes suggest the capacity for robust ICB response in many older patients, which may warrant large-scale prospective study on ICB therapies among patients of advanced age.

Abstract: Summary
Defining factors that govern CD8+ T cell immunodominance is critical for the rational design of vaccines for viral pathogens. Here, we assess the contribution of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class-I-peptide stability for 186 optimal HIV epitopes across 18 HLA alleles using transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP)-deficient mono-allelic HLA-expressing cell lines. We find that immunodominant HIV epitopes increase surface stabilization of HLA class-I molecules in comparison to subdominant epitopes. HLA class-I-peptide stability is also strongly correlated with overall immunodominance hierarchies, particularly for epitopes from high-abundance proteins (e.g., Gag). Moreover, HLA alleles associated with HIV protection are preferentially stabilized by epitopes derived from topologically important viral regions at a greater frequency than neutral and risk alleles. These findings indicate that relative stabilization of HLA class-I is a key factor for CD8+ T cell epitope immunodominance hierarchies, with implications for HIV control and the design of T-cell-based vaccines.

Abstract: Summary
CINV1, converting sucrose into glucose and fructose, is a key entry of carbon into cellular metabolism, and HXK1 functions as a pivotal sensor for glucose. Exogenous sugars trigger the Arabidopsis juvenile-to-adult phase transition via a miR156A/SPL module. However, the endogenous factors that regulate this process remain unclear. In this study, we show that sucrose specifically induced the PAP1 transcription factor directly and positively controls CINV1 activity. Furthermore, we identify a glucose feed-forward loop (sucrose-CINV1-glucose-HXK1-miR156-SPL9-PAP1-CINV1-glucose) that controls CINV1 activity to convert sucrose into glucose signaling to dynamically control the juvenile-to-adult phase transition. Moreover, PAP1 directly binds to the SPL9 promoter, activating SPL9 expression and triggering the sucrose-signaling-mediated juvenile-to-adult phase transition. Therefore, a glucose-signaling feed-forward loop and a sucrose-signaling pathway synergistically regulate the Arabidopsis juvenile-to-adult phase transition. Collectively, we identify a molecular link between the major photosynthate sucrose, the entry point of carbon into cellular metabolism, and the plant juvenile-to-adult phase transition.

Abstract: Summary
The meal distribution of proteins throughout the day is usually skewed. However, its physiological implications and the effects of better protein distribution on muscle volume are largely unknown. Here, using the two-meals-per-day feeding model, we find that protein intake at the early active phase promotes overloading-induced muscle hypertrophy, in a manner dependent on the local muscle clock. Mice fed branched-chain amino acid (BCAA)-supplemented diets at the early active phase demonstrate skeletal muscle hypertrophy. However, distribution-dependent effects are not observed in ClockΔ19 or muscle-specific Bmal1 knockout mice. Additionally, we examined the relationship between the distribution of proteins in meals and muscle functions, such as skeletal muscle index and grip strength in humans. Higher muscle functions were observed in subjects who ingested dietary proteins mainly at breakfast than at dinner. These data suggest that protein intake at breakfast may be better for the maintenance of skeletal muscle mass.

Abstract: Summary
Recombination activating genes (RAGs), consisting of RAG1 and RAG2, are stringently regulated lymphoid-specific genes, which initiate V(D)J recombination in developing lymphocytes. We report the regulation of RAG1 through a microRNA (miRNA), miR-29c, in a B cell stage-specific manner in mice and humans. Various lines of experimentation, including CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, demonstrate the target specificity and direct interaction of miR-29c to RAG1. Modulation of miR-29c levels leads to change in V(D)J recombination efficiency in pre-B cells. The miR-29c expression is inversely proportional to RAG1 in a B cell developmental stage-specific manner, and miR-29c null mice exhibit a reduction in mature B cells. A negative correlation of miR-29c and RAG1 levels is also observed in leukemia patients, suggesting the potential use of miR-29c as a biomarker and a therapeutic target. Thus, our results reveal the role of miRNA in the regulation of RAG1 and its relevance in cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophage T2 genome delivery inside Escherichia coli to demonstrate that DNA, not protein, is the genetic material. Seventy years later, our understanding of viral genome delivery in prokaryotes remains limited, especially for short-tailed phages of the Podoviridae family. These viruses expel mysterious ejection proteins found inside the capsid to form a DNA-ejectosome for genome delivery into bacteria. Here, we reconstitute the phage T7 DNA-ejectosome components gp14, gp15, and gp16 and solve the periplasmic tunnel structure at 2.7 Å resolution. We find that gp14 forms an outer membrane pore, gp15 assembles into a 210 Å hexameric DNA tube spanning the host periplasm, and gp16 extends into the host cytoplasm forming a ∼4,200 residue hub. Gp16 promotes gp15 oligomerization, coordinating peptidoglycan hydrolysis, DNA binding, and lipid insertion. The reconstituted gp15:gp16 complex lacks channel-forming activity, suggesting that the pore for DNA passage forms only transiently during genome ejection.

Abstract: Summary
Developing neurons initially form excessive neurites and then remodel them based on molecular cues and neuronal activity. Developing mitral cells in the olfactory bulb initially extend multiple primary dendrites. They then stabilize single primary dendrites while eliminating others. However, the mechanisms underlying selective dendrite remodeling remain elusive. Using CRISPR-Cas9-based knockout screening combined with in utero electroporation, we identify BMPR-2 as a key regulator for selective dendrite stabilization. Bmpr2 knockout and its rescue experiments show that BMPR-2 inhibits LIMK without ligands and thereby permits dendrite destabilization. In contrast, the overexpression of antagonists and agonists indicates that ligand-bound BMPR-2 stabilizes dendrites, most likely by releasing LIMK. Using genetic and FRET imaging experiments, we demonstrate that free LIMK is activated by NMDARs via Rac1, facilitating dendrite stabilization through F-actin formation. Thus, the selective stabilization of primary dendrites is ensured by concomitant inputs of BMP ligands and neuronal activity.

Abstract: Summary
Glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic transmission controls excitation and inhibition of postsynaptic neurons, whereas activity of ion channels modulates neuronal intrinsic excitability. However, it is unclear how excessive neuronal excitation affects intrinsic inhibition to regain homeostatic stability under physiological or pathophysiological conditions. Here, we report that a seizure-like sustained depolarization can induce short-term inhibition of hippocampal CA3 neurons via a mechanism of membrane shunting. This depolarization-induced shunting inhibition (DShI) mediates a non-synaptic, but neuronal intrinsic, short-term plasticity that is able to suppress action potential generation and postsynaptic responses by activated ionotropic receptors. We demonstrate that the TRESK channel significantly contributes to DShI. Disruption of DShI by genetic knockout of TRESK exacerbates the sensitivity and severity of epileptic seizures of mice, whereas overexpression of TRESK attenuates seizures. In summary, these results uncover a type of homeostatic intrinsic plasticity and its underlying mechanism. TRESK might represent a therapeutic target for antiepileptic drugs.

Abstract: Summary
Gut interleukin-17A (IL-17)-producing γδ T cells are tissue-resident cells that are involved in both host defense and regulation of intestinal inflammation. However, factors that regulate their functions are poorly understood. In this study, we find that the gut microbiota represses IL-17 production by cecal γδ T cells. Treatment with vancomycin, a Gram-positive bacterium-targeting antibiotic, leads to decreased production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) by the gut microbiota. Our data reveal that these microbiota-derived metabolites, particularly propionate, reduce IL-17 and IL-22 production by intestinal γδ T cells. Propionate acts directly on γδ T cells to inhibit their production of IL-17 in a histone deacetylase-dependent manner. Moreover, the production of IL-17 by human IL-17-producing γδ T cells from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is regulated by propionate. These data contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms regulating gut γδ T cell functions and offer therapeutic perspectives of these cells.

Abstract: Summary
The minichromosome maintenance (MCM) helicase physically interacts with the recombination proteins Rad51 and Rad52 from yeast to human cells. We show, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, that these interactions occur within a nuclease-insoluble scaffold enriched in replication/repair factors. Rad51 accumulates in a MCM- and DNA-binding-independent manner and interacts with MCM helicases located outside of the replication origins and forks. MCM, Rad51, and Rad52 accumulate in this scaffold in G1 and are released during the S phase. In the presence of replication-blocking lesions, Cdc7 prevents their release from the scaffold, thus maintaining the interactions. We identify a rad51 mutant that is impaired in its ability to bind to MCM but not to the scaffold. This mutant is proficient in recombination but partially defective in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) gap filling and replication fork progression through damaged DNA. Therefore, cells accumulate MCM/Rad51/Rad52 complexes at specific nuclear scaffolds in G1 to assist stressed forks through non-recombinogenic functions.

Abstract: Summary
Fusion-transcription factors (fusion-TFs) represent a class of driver oncoproteins that are difficult to therapeutically target. Recently, protein degradation has emerged as a strategy to target these challenging oncoproteins. The mechanisms that regulate fusion-TF stability, however, are generally unknown. Using CRISPR-Cas9 screening, we discovered tripartite motif-containing 8 (TRIM8) as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates and degrades EWS/FLI, a driver fusion-TF in Ewing sarcoma. Moreover, we identified TRIM8 as a selective dependency in Ewing sarcoma compared with >700 other cancer cell lines. Mechanistically, TRIM8 knockout led to an increase in EWS/FLI protein levels that was not tolerated. EWS/FLI acts as a neomorphic substrate for TRIM8, defining the selective nature of the dependency. Our results demonstrate that fusion-TF protein stability is tightly regulated and highlight fusion oncoprotein-specific regulators as selective therapeutic targets. This study provides a tractable strategy to therapeutically exploit oncogene overdose in Ewing sarcoma and potentially other fusion-TF-driven cancers.

Abstract: Potassium (K+) is a vital cation and is involved in multiple physiological functions in plants. K+ uptake from outer medium by roots is a tightly regulated process and is mainly carried out by two high affinity K+ transport proteins AKT1 and HAK5. It has been shown that calcium (Ca2+) signaling plays important roles in the regulation of K+ transport in plants. Ca2+-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) are involved in regulation of multiple K+ channels in different tissues. However, it remains to be studied whether CPKs are involved in the regulation of AKT1 and, thereby, K+ transport. Here, we have shown that constitutively active version of CPK3 (CPK3CA) is involved in K+ transport in Arabidopsis via regulating AKT1 under low K+ conditions. The constitutively active version of CPK3 (CPK3CA), as well as CPK21 (CPK21CA), inhibited K+ currents of AKT1 in Xenopus oocytes. CPK3CA inhibited only channel conductance but had no effect on channel open probability. Further, CPK3 in vivo interacted with AKT1. Under low K+ conditions, cpk3 knock-out mutants had no distinct phenotype, while the seedlings of 35S-CPK3CA overexpressing lines died even at normal K+ concentration. Further, the transgenic lines expressing CPK3CA under AKT1 promoter (ProAKT1-CPK3CA) exhibited the same phenotype as akt1 mutant with a defective root growth and leaf chlorosis. Moreover, ProAKT1-CPK3CA transgenic lines had lower root and shoot K+ contents than Col. Overall, the data reported here demonstrate that the expression of constitutively active of CPK3 impairs potassium uptake and transports in Arabidopsis under low K+ stress by inhibiting the activity of AKT1.

Abstract: Summary
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of serious acute lower respiratory tract infection in infants and the elderly. The lack of a licensed RSV vaccine calls for the development of vaccines with other targets and vaccination strategies. Here, we construct a recombinant protein, designated P-KFD1, comprising RSV phosphoprotein (P) and the E.-coli-K12-strain-derived flagellin variant KFD1. Intranasal immunization with P-KFD1 inhibits RSV replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract and protects mice against lung disease without vaccine-enhanced disease (VED). The P-specific CD4+ T cells provoked by P-KFD1 intranasal (i.n.) immunization either reside in or migrate to the respiratory tract and mediate protection against RSV infection. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labeled cell transfer further characterize the Th1 and Th17 responses induced by P-KFD1. Finally, we find that anti-viral protection depends on either interferon-γ (IFN-γ) or interleukin-17A (IL-17A). Collectively, P-KFD1 is a promising safe and effective mucosal vaccine candidate for the prevention of RSV infection.

Abstract: Summary
Transcripts encoding membrane and secreted proteins are known to associate with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through translation. Here, using cell fractionation, polysome profiling, and 3′ end sequencing, we show that transcripts differ substantially in translation-independent ER association (TiERA). Genes in certain functional groups, such as cell signaling, tend to have significantly higher TiERA potentials than others, suggesting the importance of ER association for their mRNA metabolism, such as localized translation. The TiERA potential of a transcript is determined largely by size, sequence content, and RNA structures. Alternative polyadenylation (APA) isoforms can have distinct TiERA potentials because of changes in transcript features. The widespread 3′ UTR lengthening in cell differentiation leads to greater transcript association with the ER, especially for genes that are capable of expressing very long 3′ UTRs. Our data also indicate that TiERA is in dynamic competition with translation-dependent ER association, suggesting limited space on the ER for mRNA association.

Abstract: Summary
An artificial tool for manipulating local cerebral blood flow (CBF) is necessary for understanding how CBF controls brain function. Here, we generate vascular optogenetic tools whereby smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells express optical actuators in the brain. The illumination of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-expressing mice induces a local reduction in CBF. Photoactivated adenylyl cyclase (PAC) is an optical protein that increases intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and the illumination of PAC-expressing mice induces a local increase in CBF. We target the ventral striatum, determine the temporal kinetics of CBF change, and optimize the illumination intensity to confine the effects to the ventral striatum. We demonstrate the utility of this vascular optogenetic manipulation in freely and adaptively behaving mice and validate the task- and actuator-dependent behavioral readouts. The development of vascular optogenetic animal models will help accelerate research linking vasculature, circuits, and behavior to health and disease.

Abstract: Summary
Zoonotic pathogens, such as COVID-19, reside in animal hosts before jumping species to infect humans. The Carnivora, like mink, carry many zoonoses, yet how diversity in host immune genes across species affect pathogen carriage is poorly understood. Here, we describe a progressive evolutionary downregulation of pathogen-sensing inflammasome pathways in Carnivora. This includes the loss of nucleotide-oligomerization domain leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs), acquisition of a unique caspase-1/-4 effector fusion protein that processes gasdermin D pore formation without inducing rapid lytic cell death, and the formation of a caspase-8 containing inflammasome that inefficiently processes interleukin-1β. Inflammasomes regulate gut immunity, but the carnivorous diet has antimicrobial properties that could compensate for the loss of these immune pathways. We speculate that the consequences of systemic inflammasome downregulation, however, can impair host sensing of specific pathogens such that they can reside undetected in the Carnivora.

Abstract: Summary
RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are critical regulators of post-transcriptional gene expression, and aberrant RBP-RNA interactions can promote cancer progression. Here, we interrogate the function of RBPs in cancer using pooled CRISPR-Cas9 screening and identify 57 RBP candidates with distinct roles in supporting MYC-driven oncogenic pathways. We find that disrupting YTHDF2-dependent mRNA degradation triggers apoptosis in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells and tumors. eCLIP and m6A sequencing reveal that YTHDF2 interacts with mRNAs encoding proteins in the MAPK pathway that, when stabilized, induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and increase global translation rates. scRibo-STAMP profiling of translating mRNAs reveals unique alterations in the translatome of single cells within YTHDF2-depleted solid tumors, which selectively contribute to endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis in TNBC cells. Thus, our work highlights the therapeutic potential of RBPs by uncovering a critical role for YTHDF2 in counteracting the global increase of mRNA synthesis in MYC-driven breast cancers.

Abstract: Slc44a2 is reported to interact with tetraspanins CD9 and CD81. To investigate how Slc44a2 affects adhesion protein expression, cells from wild-type (WT) Slc44a2+/+, heterozygous (HET) Slc44a2+/-, and knockout (KO) Slc44a2-/- mice were cultured from lung tissue. The cultured cells expressed vimentin, N-cadherin, p120 catenin, beta-catenin, actin, CD9, and CD81, but not E-cadherin. Vimentin expression with lack of E-cadherin indicated that the cultured cells were of mesenchymal origin. Slc44a2 KO cells and HET cells demonstrated lower adherence and faster proliferation than the WT cells. All three groups displayed dramatically altered intracellular distribution of N-cadherin, CD9, and CD81. The CD9 membrane foci observed in WT cell membranes were less frequent and diminished in size in HET cells and KO cells. N-cadherin was dispersed throughout both the cytoplasm and membrane in WT cells, with similar yet weaker distribution in HET cells; however, in KO cells, N-cadherin was densely aggregated in the perinuclear cytoplasm. CD81 had a distribution pattern in WT, HET, and KO cells similar to that of N-cadherin with dense cytoplasmic clusters in the cells. KO cells also exhibited reduced filamentous actin as compared to WT cells. These results suggest that Slc44a2 is necessary for proper cellular localization of adhesion proteins and growth regulation that may be related to altered adhesion signals.

Abstract: Summary
Aging, pathological tau oligomers (TauO), and chronic inflammation in the brain play a central role in tauopathies, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). However, the underlying mechanism of TauO-induced aging-related neuroinflammation remains unclear. Here, we show that TauO-associated astrocytes display a senescence-like phenotype in the brains of patients with AD and FTD. TauO exposure triggers astrocyte senescence through high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) release and inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which mediates paracrine senescence in adjacent cells. HMGB1 release inhibition using ethyl pyruvate (EP) and glycyrrhizic acid (GA) prevents TauO-induced senescence through inhibition of p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)—the essential signaling pathways for SASP development. Despite the developed tauopathy in 12-month-old hTau mice, EP+GA treatment significantly decreases TauO and senescent cell loads in the brain, reduces neuroinflammation, and thus ameliorates cognitive functions. Collectively, TauO-induced HMGB1 release promotes cellular senescence and neuropathology, which could represent an important common pathomechanism in tauopathies including AD and FTD.

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by a progressive loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the midbrain, which results in decreased dopamine levels accompanied by movement symptoms. Oral administration of l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-dopa), the precursor of dopamine, provides initial symptomatic relief, but abnormal involuntary movements develop later. A deeper understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying dopamine homeostasis is thus critically needed for the development of a successful treatment. Here, we show that p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4) controls dopamine levels. Constitutively active PAK4 (caPAK4) stimulated transcription of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) via the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) transcription factor. Moreover, caPAK4 increased the catalytic activity of TH through its phosphorylation of S40, which is essential for TH activation. Consistent with this result, in human midbrain tissues, we observed a strong correlation between phosphorylated PAK4S474, which represents PAK4 activity, and phosphorylated THS40, which reflects their enzymatic activity. Our findings suggest that targeting the PAK4 signaling pathways to restore dopamine levels may provide a new therapeutic approach in PD.

Abstract: Summary
Cxcl12-null embryos have dysplastic, misaligned, and hyperplastic semilunar valves (SLVs). In this study, we show that CXCL12 signaling via its receptor CXCR4 fulfills distinct roles at different stages of SLV development, acting initially as a guidance cue to pattern cellular distribution within the valve primordia during the endocardial-to-mesenchymal transition (endoMT) phase and later regulating mesenchymal cell proliferation during SLV remodeling. Transient, anteriorly localized puncta of internalized CXCR4 are observed in cells undergoing endoMT. In vitro, CXCR4+ cell orientation in response to CXCL12 requires phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling and is inhibited by suppression of endocytosis. This dynamic intracellular localization of CXCR4 during SLV development is related to CXCL12 availability, potentially enabling activation of divergent downstream signaling pathways at key developmental stages. Importantly, Cxcr7-/- mutants display evidence of excessive CXCL12 signaling, indicating a likely role for atypical chemokine receptor CXCR7 in regulating ligand bioavailability and thus CXCR4 signaling output during SLV morphogenesis.

Abstract: Epithelial multiciliated cells (MCCs) use motile cilia to direct external fluid flow, the disruption of which is associated with human diseases in a broad array of organs such as those in the respiratory, reproductive, and renal systems. While many of the signaling pathways that regulate MCC formation in these organ systems have been identified, similar characterization of MCC differentiation in the developing olfactory system has been lacking. Here, using live cell tracking, targeted cell ablation, and temporally-specific inhibition of the Notch signaling pathway, we identify the earliest time window of zebrafish olfactory MCC (OMCC) differentiation and demonstrate these cells' derivation from peridermal cells. We also describe regionally segregated Notch signaling across time points of rapid OMCC differentiation and show that Notch signaling downregulation yields an increase in OMCCs, suggesting that OMCC fate is normally repressed in a region-specific manner during olfactory development. Finally, we describe Notch signaling's regulation of the differentiation/ciliogenesis-associated genes foxj1a and foxj1b. Taken together, these findings provide new insights into the origins and developmental programming of OMCCs in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Activating mutations in HER2 (ERBB2) drive the growth of a subset of breast and other cancers and tend to co-occur with HER3 (ERBB3) missense mutations. The HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor neratinib has shown clinical activity against HER2-mutant tumors. To characterize the role of HER3 mutations in HER2-mutant tumors, we integrate computational structural modeling with biochemical and cell biological analyses. Computational modeling predicts that the frequent HER3E928G kinase domain mutation enhances the affinity of HER2/HER3 and reduces binding of HER2 to its inhibitor neratinib. Co-expression of mutant HER2/HER3 enhances HER2/HER3 co-immunoprecipitation and ligand-independent activation of HER2/HER3 and PI3K/AKT, resulting in enhanced growth, invasiveness, and resistance to HER2-targeted therapies, which can be reversed by combined treatment with PI3Kα inhibitors. Our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the evolutionary selection of co-occurring HER2/HER3 mutations and the recent clinical observations that HER3 mutations are associated with a poor response to neratinib in HER2-mutant cancers.

Abstract: Summary
The type V-K CRISPR-Cas system, featured by Cas12k effector with a naturally inactivated RuvC domain and associated with Tn7-like transposon for RNA-guided DNA transposition, is a promising tool for precise DNA insertion. To reveal the mechanism underlying target DNA recognition, we determined a cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of Cas12k from cyanobacteria Scytonema hofmanni in complex with a single guide RNA (sgRNA) and a double-stranded target DNA. Coupled with mutagenesis and in vitro DNA transposition assay, our results revealed mechanisms for the recognition of the GGTT protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence and the structural elements of Cas12k critical for RNA-guided DNA transposition. These structural and mechanistic insights should aid in the development of type V-K CRISPR-transposon systems as tools for genome editing.

Abstract: Summary
Paraspeckles are membraneless organelles formed through liquid-liquid phase separation and consist of multiple proteins and RNAs, including NONO, SFPQ, and NEAT1. The role of paraspeckles and the component NONO in hematopoiesis remains unknown. In this study, we show histone modifier ASXL1 is involved in paraspeckle formation. ASXL1 forms phase-separated droplets, upregulates NEAT1 expression, and increases NONO-NEAT1 interactions through the C-terminal intrinsically disordered region (IDR). In contrast, a pathogenic ASXL mutant (ASXL1-MT) lacking IDR does not support the interaction of paraspeckle components. Furthermore, paraspeckles are disrupted and Nono localization is abnormal in the cytoplasm of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) derived from ASXL1-MT knockin mice. Nono depletion and the forced expression of cytoplasmic NONO impair the repopulating potential of HSPCs, as does ASXL1-MT. Our study indicates a link between ASXL1 and paraspeckle components in the maintenance of normal hematopoiesis.

Abstract: The morphology, cell size and relative number of peripheral blood cells in two teleosts, Synechogobius hasta and Sebastes schlegelii, were compared using different staining methods. The results showed significant differences in cell size. The percentage of monocytes in S. hasta was greater than that in S. schlegelii (P < 0.01); however, the opposite results were obtained in the percentage of lymphocytes and thrombocytes. The two fishes shared common cytochemical-staining results, which showed that both erythrocytes were negative for all cytochemical staining; monocytes were strongly positive for PAS and positive for SBB and NAE; lymphocytes were negative for SBB, POX and NAE; neutrophils were positive for SBB and NAE; and thrombocytes were negative for SBB, ALP, POX and NAE. However, species specificity existed in the cytochemical properties. For S. hasta, monocytes were strongly positive for ALP and ACP; lymphocytes were strongly positive for ALP and weakly positive for ACP; neutrophils were strongly positive for ACP and POX; and thrombocytes were weakly positive for PAS and positive for ACP. Unlike S. hasta, monocytes were strongly positive for ACP and positive for ALP in S. schlegelii; lymphocytes were positive for ALP and partially positive for PAS; neutrophils were positive for ACP and POX; and thrombocytes were negative for PAS and ACP. The POX activity of monocytes in S. hasta was greater than that in S. schlegelii (P < 0.05), while the POX activity of neutrophils and the NAE activity of monocytes in S. hasta were significantly greater than those in S. schlegelii (P < 0.01). The results of this study can be used as a reference for the construction of haematological parameters in S. hasta and S. schlegelii for the assessment of fish health and can provide a research basis for fish diseases and immunity.

Abstract: Summary
The paternal environment has been linked to infertility and negative outcomes. Such effects may be transmitted via sperm through histone modifications. To date, in-depth profiling of the sperm chromatin in men has been limited. Here, we use deep sequencing to characterize the sperm profiles of histone H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3) and DNA methylation in a representative reference population of 37 men. Our analysis reveals that H3K4me3 is localized throughout the genome and at genes for fertility and development. Remarkably, enrichment is also found at regions that escape epigenetic reprogramming in primordial germ cells, embryonic enhancers, and short-interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs). There is significant overlap in H3K4me3 and DNA methylation throughout the genome, suggesting a potential interplay between these marks previously reported to be mutually exclusive in sperm. Comparisons made between H3K4me3 marked regions in sperm and the embryonic transcriptome suggest an influence of paternal chromatin on embryonic gene expression.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common tumors that has a high incidence worldwide. Targeted therapy for CRC has received much attention recently. It is still necessary to develop novel and promising therapeutic targets to improve the prognosis. SYNPO2, also known as synapsopoprotein 2 or myopod, encodes actin binding proteins and has been characterized as a tumor suppressor for aggressive cancers. SYNPO2 has been reported to inhibit the activity of YAP/TAZ. However, whether SYNPO2 could regulate the progression of CRC through the YAP/YAZ signaling pathway remains unclear. Herein, it was found that the expression of SYNPO2 was low in hypoxia-exposed CRC cells, consistent with the data from TCGA database. SYNPO2 inhibited the growth of CRC cells upon hypoxia treatment and promoted the cell apoptosis. Additionally, SYNPO2 inhibited the migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) CRC cell upon hypoxia treatment. Mechanically, the results demonstrated that SYNPO2 suppressed hypoxia-induced progression of CRC by regulating YAP-Kruppel like factor 5 (KLF5) axis. Therefore, SYNPO2 can serve as a promising therapeutic target for CRC treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Cells counter DNA damage through repair or apoptosis, yet a direct mechanism for this choice has remained elusive. When facing interstrand crosslinks (ICLs), the ICL-repair protein FANCI heterodimerizes with FANCD2 to initiate ICL excision. We found that FANCI alternatively interacts with a pro-apoptotic factor, PIDD1, to enable PIDDosome (PIDD1-RAIDD-caspase-2) formation and apoptotic death. FANCI switches from FANCD2/repair to PIDD1/apoptosis signaling in the event of ICL-repair failure. Specifically, removing key endonucleases downstream of FANCI/FANCD2, increasing ICL levels, or allowing damaged cells into mitosis (when repair is suppressed) all suffice for switching. Reciprocally, apoptosis-committed FANCI reverts from PIDD1 to FANCD2 after a failed attempt to assemble the PIDDosome. Monoubiquitination and deubiquitination at FANCI K523 impact interactor selection. These data unveil a repair-or-apoptosis switch in eukaryotes. Beyond ensuring the removal of unrepaired genomes, the switch’s bidirectionality reveals that damaged cells can offset apoptotic defects via de novo attempts at lesion repair.

Abstract: Summary
HECT ubiquitin ligases play essential roles in metazoan development and physiology. The HECT ligase HUWE1 is central to the cellular stress response by mediating degradation of key death or survival factors, including Mcl1, p53, DDIT4, and Myc. Although mutations in HUWE1 and related HECT ligases are widely implicated in human disease, our molecular understanding remains limited. Here we present a comprehensive investigation of full-length HUWE1, deepening our understanding of this class of enzymes. The N-terminal ∼3,900 amino acids of HUWE1 are indispensable for proper ligase function, and our cryo-EM structures of HUWE1 offer a complete molecular picture of this large HECT ubiquitin ligase. HUWE1 forms an alpha solenoid-shaped assembly with a central pore decorated with protein interaction modules. Structures of HUWE1 variants linked to neurodevelopmental disorders as well as of HUWE1 bound to a model substrate link the functions of this essential enzyme to its three-dimensional organization.

Abstract: Summary
Missense mutations of the tumor suppressor Neurofibromin 2 (NF2/Merlin/schwannomin) result in sporadic to frequent occurrences of tumorigenesis in multiple organs. However, the underlying pathogenicity of NF2-related tumorigenesis remains mostly unknown. Here we found that NF2 facilitated innate immunity by regulating YAP/TAZ-mediated TBK1 inhibition. Unexpectedly, patient-derived individual mutations in the FERM domain of NF2 (NF2m) converted NF2 into a potent suppressor of cGAS-STING signaling. Mechanistically, NF2m gained extreme associations with IRF3 and TBK1 and, upon innate nucleic acid sensing, was directly induced by the activated IRF3 to form cellular condensates, which contained the PP2A complex, to eliminate TBK1 activation. Accordingly, NF2m robustly suppressed STING-initiated antitumor immunity in cancer cell-autonomous and -nonautonomous murine models, and NF2m-IRF3 condensates were evident in human vestibular schwannomas. Our study reports phase separation-mediated quiescence of cGAS-STING signaling by a mutant tumor suppressor and reveals gain-of-function pathogenesis for NF2-related tumors by regulating antitumor immunity.

Abstract: Summary
The R2TP (RUVBL1-RUVBL2-RPAP3-PIH1D1) complex, in collaboration with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), functions as a chaperone for the assembly and stability of protein complexes, including RNA polymerases, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-like kinases (PIKKs) such as TOR and SMG1. PIKK stabilization depends on an additional complex of TELO2, TTI1, and TTI2 (TTT), whose structure and function are poorly understood. The cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the human R2TP-TTT complex, together with biochemical experiments, reveals the mechanism of TOR recruitment to the R2TP-TTT chaperone. The HEAT-repeat TTT complex binds the kinase domain of TOR, without blocking its activity, and delivers TOR to the R2TP chaperone. In addition, TTT regulates the R2TP chaperone by inhibiting RUVBL1-RUVBL2 ATPase activity and by modulating the conformation and interactions of the PIH1D1 and RPAP3 components of R2TP. Taken together, our results show how TTT couples the recruitment of TOR to R2TP with the regulation of this chaperone system.

Abstract: Extracellular ATP works as an autocrine and/or paracrine signaling molecule by activating plasma membrane-localized purinergic receptors. Stimulation of purinergic P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) increases cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]c), which in turn activates Pannexin 1 (Panx1) channel. In earlier studies, Panx1 and P2X7R have been shown to interact physically. Also, both the channels have been implicated in similar pathophysiological processes. In this study, we investigated the effect of Panx1 on P2X7R-mediated Ca2+influx. Panx1 attenuated P2X7R-mediated [Ca2+]c rise in CHO-K1 and HEK-293 cells. [Ca2+]c rise was higher in Panx1 knockdown astrocytes. The inhibitory effect was unaffected in the presence of Panx1 blocker, carbenoxolone. The region between 350th and 386th amino acid residues in the carboxyl terminus (CT) of Panx1 was found to be crucial for inhibiting P2X7R. Like full-length Panx1, the CT (350th to 426th amino acids) alone was able to attenuate the [Ca2+]c rise. Further, CT prevented cell death caused by P2X7R overactivation. Based on our results, we propose a novel pro-survival role of Panx1 exerted by modulating P2X7R.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular immunity is important in determining the disease severity of COVID-19 patients. However, current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 epitopes mediating cellular immunity is limited. Here we apply T-Scan, a recently developed method, to identify CD8+ T cell epitopes from COVID-19 patients of four major HLA-A alleles. Several identified epitopes are conserved across human coronaviruses, which might mediate pre-existing cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we identify and validate four epitopes that were mutated in the newly circulating variants, including the Delta variant. The mutations significantly reduce T cell responses to the epitope peptides in convalescent and vaccinated samples. We further determine the crystal structure of HLA-A∗02:01/HLA-A∗24:02 in complex with the epitope KIA_S/NYN_S, respectively, which reveals the importance of K417 and L452 of the spike protein for binding to HLA. Our data suggest that evading cellular immunity might contribute to the increased transmissibility and disease severity associated with the new SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Abstract: Summary
Brain function relies almost solely on glucose as an energy substrate. The main model of brain metabolism proposes that glucose is taken up and converted into lactate by astrocytes to fuel the energy-demanding neuronal activity underlying plasticity and memory. Whether direct neuronal glucose uptake is required for memory formation remains elusive. We uncover, in Drosophila, a mechanism of glucose shuttling to neurons from cortex glia, an exclusively perisomatic glial subtype, upon formation of olfactory long-term memory (LTM). In vivo imaging reveals that, downstream of cholinergic activation of cortex glia, autocrine insulin signaling increases glucose concentration in glia. Glucose is then transferred from glia to the neuronal somata in the olfactory memory center to fuel the pentose phosphate pathway and allow LTM formation. In contrast, our results indicate that the increase in neuronal glucose metabolism, although crucial for LTM formation, is not routed to glycolysis.

Abstract: Summary
Germline alterations of the NF2 gene cause neurofibromatosis type 2, a syndrome manifested with benign tumors, and Nf2 deletion in mice also results in slow tumorigenesis. As a regulator of the Hippo signaling pathway, NF2 induces LATS1/2 kinases and consequently represses YAP/TAZ. YAP/TAZ oncoproteins are also inhibited by motin family proteins (Motins). Here, we show that the Hippo signaling is fine-tuned by Motins in a NF2-dependent manner, in which NF2 recruits E3 ligase RNF146 to facilitate ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of Motins. In the absence of NF2, Motins robustly accumulate to restrict full activation of YAP/TAZ and prevent rapid tumorigenesis. Hence, NF2 deficiency not only activates YAP/TAZ by inhibiting LATS1/2 but also stabilizes Motins to keep YAP/TAZ activity in check. The upregulation of Motins upon NF2 deletion serves as a strategy for avoiding uncontrolled perturbation of the Hippo signaling and may contribute to the benign nature of most NF2-mutated tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Analysis of translocation breakpoints in human B cell malignancies reveals that DNA double-strand breaks at oncogenes most frequently occur at CpG sites located within 20–600 bp fragile zones and depend on activation-induced deaminase (AID). AID requires single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) to act, but it has been unclear why or how this region transiently acquires a ssDNA state. Here, we demonstrate the ssDNA state in the 23 bp E2A fragile zone using several methods, including native bisulfite DNA structural analysis in live human pre-B cells. AID deamination within the E2A fragile zone does not require but is increased upon transcription. High C-string density, nascent RNA tails, and direct DNA sequence repeats prolong the ssDNA state of the E2A fragile zone and increase AID deamination at overlapping AID hotspots that contain the CpG sites at which breaks occur in patients. These features provide key insights into lymphoid fragile zones generally.

Abstract: Summary
Active brown adipose tissue (BAT) consumes copious amounts of glucose, yet how glucose metabolism supports thermogenesis is unclear. By combining transcriptomics, metabolomics, and stable isotope tracing in vivo, we systematically analyze BAT glucose utilization in mice during acute and chronic cold exposure. Metabolite profiling reveals extensive temperature-dependent changes in the BAT metabolome and transcriptome upon cold adaptation, discovering unexpected metabolite markers of thermogenesis, including increased N-acetyl-amino acid production. Time-course stable isotope tracing further reveals rapid incorporation of glucose carbons into glycolysis and TCA cycle, as well as several auxiliary pathways, including NADPH, nucleotide, and phospholipid synthesis pathways. Gene expression differences inconsistently predict glucose fluxes, indicating that posttranscriptional mechanisms also govern glucose utilization. Surprisingly, BAT swiftly generates fatty acids and acyl-carnitines from glucose, suggesting that lipids are rapidly synthesized and immediately oxidized. These data reveal versatility in BAT glucose utilization, highlighting the value of an integrative-omics approach to understanding organ metabolism.

Here, we show that Npas4 (neuronal PAS-domain protein 4) transcriptionally regulates the expression of IQSEC3, a GABAergic synapse-specific guanine nucleotide-exchange factor for ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF-GEF) that directly interacts with gephyrin. Neuronal activation by an enriched environment induces Npas4-mediated upregulation of IQSEC3 protein specifically in CA1 stratum oriens layer somatostatin (SST)-expressing GABAergic interneurons. SST+ interneuron-specific knockout (KO) of Npas4 compromises synaptic transmission in these GABAergic interneurons, increases neuronal activity in CA1 pyramidal neurons, and reduces anxiety behavior, all of which are normalized by the expression of wild-type IQSEC3, but not a dominant-negative ARF-GEF-inactive mutant, in SST+ interneurons of Npas4-KO mice. Our results suggest that IQSEC3 is a key GABAergic synapse component that is directed by Npas4 and ARF activity, specifically in SST+ interneurons, to orchestrate excitation-to-inhibition balance and control anxiety-like behavior.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear chromosomes transcribe far more RNA than required to encode protein. Here we investigate whether non-coding RNA broadly contributes to cytological-scale chromosome territory architecture. We develop a procedure that depletes soluble proteins, chromatin, and most nuclear RNA from the nucleus but does not delocalize XIST, a known architectural RNA, from an insoluble chromosome “scaffold.” RNA-seq analysis reveals that most RNA in the nuclear scaffold is repeat-rich, non-coding, and derived predominantly from introns of nascent transcripts. Insoluble, repeat-rich (C0T-1) RNA co-distributes with known scaffold proteins including scaffold attachment factor A (SAF-A), and distribution of these components inversely correlates with chromatin compaction in normal and experimentally manipulated nuclei. We further show that RNA is required for SAF-A to interact with chromatin and for enrichment of structurally embedded “scaffold attachment regions” prevalent in euchromatin. Collectively, the results indicate that long nascent transcripts contribute a dynamic structural role that promotes the open architecture of active chromosome territories.

Abstract: Summary
The β3-adrenergic receptor (β3AR) is predominantly expressed in adipose tissue and urinary bladder and has emerged as an attractive drug target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, obesity, and overactive bladder (OAB). Here, we report the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of the β3AR-Gs signaling complex with the selective agonist mirabegron, a first-in-class drug for OAB. Comparison of this structure with the previously reported β1AR and β2AR structures reveals a receptor activation mechanism upon mirabegron binding to the orthosteric site. Notably, the narrower exosite in β3AR creates a perpendicular pocket for mirabegron. Mutational analyses suggest that a combination of both the exosite shape and the amino-acid-residue substitutions defines the drug selectivity of the βAR agonists. Our findings provide a molecular basis for βAR subtype selectivity, allowing the design of more-selective agents with fewer adverse effects.

Abstract: Summary
The presence of a wound triggers surrounding cells to initiate repair mechanisms, but it is not clear how cells initially detect wounds. In epithelial cells, the earliest known wound response, occurring within seconds, is a dramatic increase in cytosolic calcium. Here, we show that wounds in the Drosophila notum trigger cytoplasmic calcium increase by activating extracellular cytokines, Growth-blocking peptides (Gbps), which initiate signaling in surrounding epithelial cells through the G-protein-coupled receptor Methuselah-like 10 (Mthl10). Latent Gbps are present in unwounded tissue and are activated by proteolytic cleavage. Using wing discs, we show that multiple protease families can activate Gbps, suggesting that they act as a generalized protease-detector system. We present experimental and computational evidence that proteases released during wound-induced cell damage and lysis serve as the instructive signal: these proteases liberate Gbp ligands, which bind to Mthl10 receptors on surrounding epithelial cells, and activate downstream release of calcium.

Abstract: Summary
Evasion of killing by immune cells is crucial for fungal survival in the host. For the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans, internalization by macrophages induces a transition from yeast to filaments that promotes macrophage death and fungal escape. Nutrient deprivation, alkaline pH, and oxidative stress have been implicated as triggers of intraphagosomal filamentation; however, the impact of other host-derived factors remained unknown. Here, we show that lysates prepared from macrophage-like cell lines and primary macrophages robustly induce C. albicans filamentation. Enzymatic treatment of lysate implicates a phosphorylated protein, and bioactivity-guided fractionation coupled to mass spectrometry identifies the immunomodulatory phosphoprotein PTMA as a candidate trigger of C. albicans filamentation. Immunoneutralization of PTMA within lysate abolishes its activity, strongly supporting PTMA as a filament-inducing component of macrophage lysate. Adding to the known repertoire of physical factors, this work implicates a host protein in the induction of C. albicans filamentation within immune cells.

Abstract: Summary
Congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract are among the most common birth defects, affecting 3% of newborns. The human kidney forms around a million nephrons from a pool of nephron progenitors over a 30-week period of development. To establish a framework for human nephrogenesis, we spatially resolved a stereotypical process by which equipotent nephron progenitors generate a nephron anlage, then applied data-driven approaches to construct three-dimensional protein maps on anatomical models of the nephrogenic program. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified progenitor states, which were spatially mapped to the nephron anatomy, enabling the generation of functional gene networks predicting interactions within and between nephron cell types. Network mining identified known developmental disease genes and predicted targets of interest. The spatially resolved nephrogenic program made available through the Human Nephrogenesis Atlas (https://sckidney.flatironinstitute.org/) will facilitate an understanding of kidney development and disease and enhance efforts to generate new kidney structures.

Abstract: Ubiquitin D (UBD) is highly upregulated in many cancers, and plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiological processes of cancers. However, its roles and underlying mechanisms in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) are still unclear. In the present study, we investigated the role of UBD in patients with OSCC. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot were used to measure the expression of UBD in OSCC tissues. Immunohistochemistry assay was used to detect the differential expressions of UBD in 244 OSCC patients and 32 cases of normal oral mucosae. In addition, CCK-8, colony formation, wound healing and Transwell assays were performed to evaluate the effect of UBD on the cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in OSCC. Furthermore, a xenograft tumor model was established to verify the role of UBD on tumor formation in vivo. We found that UBD was upregulated in human OSCC tissues and cell lines and was associated with clinical and pathological features of patients. Moreover, the overexpression of UBD promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of OSCC cells; however, the knockdown of UBD exerted the opposite effects. In this study, our results also suggested that UBD promoted OSCC progression through NF-κB signaling. Our findings indicated that UBD played a critical role in OSCC and may serve as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for OSCC treatment.

Abstract: A recent genetic study with Brucella abortus revealed the secretion activator gene A (SagA) as an autolysin component creating pores in the peptidoglycan (PGN) layer for the type IV secretion system (T4SS) and peptidoglycan hydrolase inhibitor A (PhiA) as an inhibitor of SagA. In this study, we determined the crystal structures of both SagA and PhiA. Notably, the SagA structure contained a PGN fragment in a space between the N- and C-terminal domains, showing the substrate-dependent hinge motion of the domains. The purified SagA fully hydrolyzed the meso-diaminopimelic acid (DAP)-type PGN, showing a higher activity than hen egg-white lysozyme. The PhiA protein exhibiting tetrameric assembly failed to inhibit SagA activity in our experiments. Our findings provide implications for the molecular basis of the SagA-PhiA system of B. abortus. The development of inhibitors of SagA would further contribute to controlling brucellosis by attenuating the function of T4SS, the major virulence factor of Brucella.

Abstract: Summary
The off-target activity of the CRISPR-associated nuclease Cas9 is a potential concern for therapeutic genome editing applications. Although high-fidelity Cas9 variants have been engineered, they exhibit varying efficiencies and have residual off-target effects, limiting their applicability. Here, we show that CRISPR hybrid RNA-DNA (chRDNA) guides provide an effective approach to increase Cas9 specificity while preserving on-target editing activity. Across multiple genomic targets in primary human T cells, we show that 2′-deoxynucleotide (dnt) positioning affects guide activity and specificity in a target-dependent manner and that this can be used to engineer chRDNA guides with substantially reduced off-target effects. Crystal structures of DNA-bound Cas9-chRDNA complexes reveal distorted guide-target duplex geometry and allosteric modulation of Cas9 conformation. These structural effects increase specificity by perturbing DNA hybridization and modulating Cas9 activation kinetics to disfavor binding and cleavage of off-target substrates. Overall, these results pave the way for utilizing customized chRDNAs in clinical applications.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria constantly undergo fusion and fission events, referred as mitochondrial dynamics, which determine mitochondrial architecture and bioenergetics. Cultured cell studies demonstrate that mitochondrial dynamics are acutely regulated by phosphorylation of the mitochondrial fission orchestrator dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) at S579 or S600. However, the physiological impact and crosstalk of these phosphorylation sites is poorly understood. Here, we describe the functional interrelation between S579 and S600 phosphorylation sites in vivo and their role on mitochondrial remodeling. Mice carrying a homozygous Drp1 S600A knockin (Drp1 KI) mutation display larger mitochondria and enhanced lipid oxidation and respiratory capacities, granting improved glucose tolerance and thermogenic response upon high-fat feeding. Housing mice at thermoneutrality blunts these differences, suggesting a role for the brown adipose tissue in the protection of Drp1 KI mice against metabolic damage. Overall, we demonstrate crosstalk between Drp1 phosphorylation sites and provide evidence that their modulation could be used in the treatment and prevention of metabolic diseases.

Abstract: Summary
E-cadherin junctions facilitate assembly and disassembly of cell contacts that drive development and homeostasis of epithelial tissues. In this study, using Xenopus embryonic kidney and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, we investigate the role of the Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) formin Daam1 (Dishevelled-associated activator of morphogenesis 1) in regulating E-cadherin-based intercellular adhesion. Using live imaging, we show that Daam1 localizes to newly formed cell contacts in the developing nephron. Furthermore, analyses of junctional filamentous actin (F-actin) upon Daam1 depletion indicate decreased microfilament localization and slowed turnover. We also show that Daam1 is necessary for efficient and timely localization of junctional E-cadherin, mediated by Daam1’s formin homology domain 2 (FH2). Finally, we establish that Daam1 signaling promotes organized movement of renal cells. This study demonstrates that Daam1 formin junctional activity is critical for epithelial tissue organization.

Abstract: Summary
Phospholamban (PLN) is an important regulator of cardiac calcium handling due to its ability to inhibit the calcium ATPase SERCA. β-Adrenergic stimulation reverses SERCA inhibition via PLN phosphorylation and facilitates fast calcium reuptake. PLN also forms pentamers whose physiological significance has remained elusive. Using mathematical modeling combined with biochemical and cell biological experiments, we show that pentamers regulate both the dynamics and steady-state levels of monomer phosphorylation. Substrate competition by pentamers and a feed-forward loop involving inhibitor-1 can delay monomer phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA), whereas cooperative pentamer dephosphorylation enables bistable PLN steady-state phosphorylation. Simulations show that phosphorylation delay and bistability act as complementary filters that reduce the effect of random fluctuations in PKA activity, thereby ensuring consistent monomer phosphorylation and SERCA activity despite noisy upstream signals. Preliminary analyses suggest that the PLN mutation R14del could impair noise filtering, offering a new perspective on how this mutation causes cardiac arrhythmias.

Abstract: Summary
Protein clustering is pervasive in cell signaling, yet how signaling from higher-order assemblies differs from simpler forms of molecular organization is still poorly understood. We present an optogenetic approach to switch between oligomers and heterodimers with a single point mutation. We apply this system to study signaling from the kinase Zap70 and its substrate linker for activation of T cells (LAT), proteins that normally form membrane-localized condensates during T cell activation. We find that fibroblasts expressing synthetic Zap70:LAT clusters activate downstream signaling, whereas one-to-one heterodimers do not. We provide evidence that clusters harbor a positive feedback loop among Zap70, LAT, and Src-family kinases that binds phosphorylated LAT and further activates Zap70. Finally, we extend our optogenetic approach to the native T cell signaling context, where light-induced LAT clustering is sufficient to drive a calcium response. Our study reveals a specific signaling function for protein clusters and identifies a biochemical circuit that robustly senses protein oligomerization state.

Abstract: Summary
The utricle is a vestibular sensory organ that requires mechanosensitive hair cells to detect linear acceleration. In neonatal mice, new hair cells are derived from non-sensory supporting cells, yet cell type diversity and mechanisms of cell addition remain poorly characterized. Here, we perform computational analyses on single-cell transcriptomes to categorize cell types and resolve 14 individual sensory and non-sensory subtypes. Along the periphery of the sensory epithelium, we uncover distinct groups of transitional epithelial cells, marked by Islr, Cnmd, and Enpep expression. By reconstructing de novo trajectories and gene dynamics, we show that as the utricle expands, Islr+ transitional epithelial cells exhibit a dynamic and proliferative phase to generate new supporting cells, followed by coordinated differentiation into hair cells. Taken together, our study reveals a sequential and coordinated process by which non-sensory epithelial cells contribute to growth of the postnatal mouse sensory epithelium.

Abstract: Summary
Contact inhibition of cell proliferation regulates tissue size and prevents uncontrolled cell expansion. When cell density increases, contact inhibition can force proliferating cells into quiescence. Here we show that the variable memory of local cell density experienced by a mother cell controls the levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activator cyclin D1 and inhibitor p27 in newborn daughters, which direct cells to proliferation or quiescence. Much of this regulation can be explained by rapid suppression of ERK activity by high cell density in mothers, which leads to lower cyclin D1 and higher p27 levels in daughters. Strikingly, cell density and mitogen signals compete by shifting the ratio of cyclin D1/p27 levels below or above a single sharp threshold that controls the proliferation decision. Thus, the history of competing cell density and mitogen signals experienced by mothers is funneled into a precise activator-inhibitor balance that decides the fate of daughter cells.

Abstract: Cardiac neural crest cells arise in the caudal hindbrain and then migrate to the heart through the pharyngeal arches. These cells contribute to the formation of the heart, including the outflow tract, and are unique to this neural crest population. MafB is a transcription factor expressed specifically in early migrating cardiac neural crest cells as well as in rhombomeres (r) 5 and 6. Here, we identified the regulatory region in the chicken genome controlling the expression of endogenous MafB transcripts and used these essential elements to express MafB in the cardiac neural crest in reporter assays. A reporter driven by this regulatory region was employed to trace the migration of these cells into the pharyngeal arches. This regulatory region demonstrated transcriptional activity in the cardiac neural crest but not in other neural crest cell subpopulations, such as the cranial and trunk cells. This study provides insights into the gene regulatory mechanisms that specify cardiac neural crest cells among neural crest cell populations.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular resources must be reorganized for long-term synaptic plasticity during brain information processing, in which coordinated gene transcription and protein turnover are required. However, the mechanism underlying this process remains elusive. Here, we report that activating N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) induce transcription-dependent autophagy for synaptic turnover and late-phase long-term synaptic depression (L-LTD), which invokes cytoplasm-to-nucleus signaling mechanisms known to be required for late-phase long-term synaptic potentiation (L-LTP). Mechanistically, LTD-inducing stimuli specifically dephosphorylate CRTC1 (CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 1) at Ser-151 and are advantaged in recruiting CRTC1 from cytoplasm to the nucleus, where it competes with FXR (fed-state sensing nuclear receptor) for binding to CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) and drives autophagy gene expression. Disrupting synergistic actions of CREB and CRTC1 (two essential L-LTP transcription factors) impairs transcription-dependent autophagy induction and prevents NMDAR-dependent L-LTD, which can be rescued by constitutively inducing mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent autophagy. Together, these findings uncover mechanistic commonalities between L-LTP and L-LTD, suggesting that synaptic activity can tune excitation-transcription coupling for distinct long-lasting synaptic remodeling.

Abstract: Yes-associated protein (YAP) is essential in maintaining tissue size. Aberrant epithelial remodeling is a key pathological alteration in both inflammation and benign tumors in nasal mucosa. We sought to investigate the expression and localization patterns of YAP in remodeled nasal epithelium of basal cell hyperplasia, goblet cell metaplasia and squamous metaplasia. YAP expression patterns were evaluated in tissues obtained from patients with NP (n = 45) and IP (n = 27), and control subjects with septal deviation (n = 17) and tissue-derived primary cell cultures. Compared to the normal epithelium, expressions of YAP were significantly higher in basal cell hyperplasia (NP, 11.4-fold; IP, 19.6-fold), followed by squamous metaplasia (8.2-fold) and mild to moderate goblet cell metaplasia (2.9-fold); while their expression was lower in severe goblet cell metaplasia (3.3-fold). Our resultsshowed that: 1) ectopic nuclear YAP expression associated with p63+ basal cell hyperplasia and the high proliferative potential epithelial cells; 2) increase of cytoplasmic YAP correlated with mild to moderate goblet cell metaplasia; 3) increase of cytoplasmic YAP correlated with squamous cell metaplasia. The in vitro cell model also demonstrated almost concordant changes of YAP with the mucosa findings. Different YAP expression and localization patterns should play critical but differential roles in the nasal epithelial remodeling processes under mucosal inflammation and benign tumor formation.

Abstract: Coronavirus disease, COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), has a higher case fatality rate in European countries than in others, especially East Asian ones. One potential explanation for this regional difference is the diversity of the viral infection efficiency. Here, we analyzed the allele frequencies of a nonsynonymous variant rs12329760 (V197M) in the TMPRSS2 gene, a key enzyme essential for viral infection and found a significant association between the COVID-19 case fatality rate and the V197M allele frequencies, using over 200,000 present-day and ancient genomic samples. East Asian countries have higher V197M allele frequencies than other regions, including European countries which correlates to their lower case fatality rates. Structural and energy calculation analysis of the V197M amino acid change showed that it destabilizes the TMPRSS2 protein, possibly negatively affecting its ACE2 and viral spike protein processing.

Abstract: The Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid type 2 (TRPV2) channel is highly selective for Ca2+ and can be activated by lipids, such as LysoPhosphatidylCholine (LPC). LPC analogues, such as the synthetic alkyl-ether-lipid edelfosine or the endogenous alkyl-ether-lipid Platelet Activating Factor (PAF), modulates ion channels in cancer cells. This opens the way to develop alkyl-ether-lipids for the modulation of TRPV2 in cancer. Here, we investigated the role of 2-Acetamido-2-Deoxy-l-O-Hexadecyl-rac-Glycero-3-PhosphatidylCholine (AD-HGPC), a new alkyl-ether-lipid (LPC analogue), on TRPV2 trafficking and its impact on Ca2+ -dependent cell migration. The effect of AD-HGPC on the TRPV2 channel and tumour process was further investigated using calcium imaging and an in vivo mouse model. Using molecular and pharmacological approaches, we dissected the mechanism implicated in alkyl-ether-lipids sensitive TRPV2 trafficking. We found that TRPV2 promotes constitutive Ca2+ entry, leading to migration of highly metastatic breast cancer cell lines through the PI3K/Akt-Girdin axis. AD-HGPC addresses the functional TRPV2 channel in the plasma membrane through Golgi stimulation and PI3K/Akt/Rac-dependent cytoskeletal reorganization, leading to constitutive Ca2+ entry and breast cancer cell migration (without affecting the development of metastasis), in a mouse model. We describe, for the first time, the biological role of a new alkyl-ether-lipid on TRPV2 channel trafficking in breast cancer cells and highlight the potential modulation of TRPV2 by alkyl-ether-lipids as a novel avenue for research in the treatment of metastatic cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) serves as an interface between higher-order motor systems and lower motor neurons. The excitatory module of the MLR is composed of the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) and the cuneiform nucleus (CnF), and their activation has been proposed to elicit different modalities of movement. However, how the differences in connectivity and physiological properties explain their contributions to motor activity is not well known. Here we report that CnF glutamatergic neurons are more electrophysiologically homogeneous than PPN neurons and have mostly short-range connectivity, whereas PPN glutamatergic neurons are heterogeneous and maintain long-range connections, most notably with the basal ganglia. Optogenetic activation of CnF neurons produces short-lasting muscle activation, driving involuntary motor activity. In contrast, PPN neuron activation produces long-lasting increases in muscle tone that reduce motor activity and disrupt gait. Our results highlight biophysical and functional attributes among MLR neurons that support their differential contribution to motor behavior.

Abstract: Summary
In this study, we investigate mechanisms leading to inflammation and immunoreactivity in ovarian tumors with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). BRCA1 loss is found to lead to transcriptional reprogramming in tumor cells and cell-intrinsic inflammation involving type I interferon (IFN) and stimulator of IFN genes (STING). BRCA1-mutated (BRCA1mut) tumors are thus T cell inflamed at baseline. Genetic deletion or methylation of DNA-sensing/IFN genes or CCL5 chemokine is identified as a potential mechanism to attenuate T cell inflammation. Alternatively, in BRCA1mut cancers retaining inflammation, STING upregulates VEGF-A, mediating immune resistance and tumor progression. Tumor-intrinsic STING elimination reduces neoangiogenesis, increases CD8+ T cell infiltration, and reverts therapeutic resistance to dual immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). VEGF-A blockade phenocopies genetic STING loss and synergizes with ICB and/or poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors to control the outgrowth of Trp53−/−Brca1−/− but not Brca1+/+ ovarian tumors in vivo, offering rational combinatorial therapies for HRD cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Studies investigating whether there is a causative link between the gut microbiota and lifespan have largely been restricted to invertebrates or to mice with a reduced lifespan because of a genetic deficiency. We investigate the effect of early-life antibiotic exposure on otherwise healthy, normal chow-fed, wild-type mice, monitoring these mice for more than 700 days in comparison with untreated control mice. We demonstrate the emergence of two different low-diversity community types, post-antibiotic microbiota (PAM) I and PAM II, following antibiotic exposure. PAM II but not PAM I mice have impaired immunity, increased insulin resistance, and evidence of increased inflammaging in later life as well as a reduced lifespan. Our data suggest that differences in the composition of the gut microbiota following antibiotic exposure differentially affect host health and longevity in later life.

Abstract: Summary
Structural heterogeneity of nucleosomes in functional chromosomes is unknown. Here, we devise the template-, reference- and selection-free (TRSF) cryo-EM pipeline to simultaneously reconstruct cryo-EM structures of protein complexes from interphase or metaphase chromosomes. The reconstructed interphase and metaphase nucleosome structures are on average indistinguishable from canonical nucleosome structures, despite DNA sequence heterogeneity, cell-cycle-specific posttranslational modifications, and interacting proteins. Nucleosome structures determined by a decoy-classifying method and structure variability analyses reveal the nucleosome structural variations in linker DNA, histone tails, and nucleosome core particle configurations, suggesting that the opening of linker DNA, which is correlated with H2A C-terminal tail positioning, is suppressed in chromosomes. High-resolution (3.4–3.5 Å) nucleosome structures indicate DNA-sequence-independent stabilization of superhelical locations ±0–1 and ±3.5–4.5. The linker histone H1.8 preferentially binds to metaphase chromatin, from which chromatosome cryo-EM structures with H1.8 at the on-dyad position are reconstituted. This study presents the structural characteristics of nucleosomes in chromosomes.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria are principal metabolic organelles that are increasingly unveiled as immune regulators. However, it is currently not known whether mitochondrial-encoded peptides modulate T cells to induce changes in phenotype and function. In this study, we found that MOTS-c (mitochondrial open reading frame of the 12S rRNA type-c) prevented autoimmune β cell destruction by targeting T cells in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. MOTS-c ameliorated the development of hyperglycemia and reduced islet-infiltrating immune cells. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of T cells from MOTS-c-treated NOD mice significantly decreased the incidence of diabetes in NOD-severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. Metabolic and genomic analyses revealed that MOTS-c modulated T cell phenotype and function by regulating T cell receptor (TCR)/mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients had a lower serum MOTS-c level than did healthy controls. Furthermore, MOTS-c reduced T cell activation by alleviating T cells from the glycolytic stress in T1D patients, suggesting therapeutic potential. Our findings indicate that MOTS-c regulates the T cell phenotype and suppresses autoimmune diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
Drosophila melanogaster Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam1) can generate 38,016 different isoforms through largely stochastic, yet highly biased, alternative splicing. These isoforms are required for nervous functions. However, the functional significance of splicing bias remains unknown. Here, we provide evidence that Dscam1 splicing bias is required for mushroom body (MB) axonal wiring. We generate mutant flies with normal overall protein levels and an identical number but global changes in exon 4 and 9 isoform bias (DscamΔ4D−/− and DscamΔ9D−/−), respectively. In contrast to DscamΔ4D−/−, DscamΔ9D−/− exhibits remarkable MB defects, suggesting a variable domain-specific requirement for isoform bias. Importantly, changes in isoform bias cause axonal defects but do not influence the self-avoidance of axonal branches. We conclude that, in contrast to the isoform number that provides the molecular basis for neurite self-avoidance, isoform bias may play a role in MB axonal wiring by influencing non-repulsive signaling.

Abstract: Summary
N-degron pathways are a set of proteolytic systems that target the N-terminal destabilizing residues of substrates for proteasomal degradation. Recently, the Gly/N-degron pathway has been identified as a new branch of the N-degron pathway. The N-terminal glycine degron (Gly/N-degron) is recognized by ZYG11B and ZER1, the substrate receptors of the Cullin 2-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL2). Here we present the crystal structures of ZYG11B and ZER1 bound to various Gly/N-degrons. The structures reveal that ZYG11B and ZER1 utilize their armadillo (ARM) repeats forming a deep and narrow cavity to engage mainly the first four residues of Gly/N-degrons. The α-amino group of the Gly/N-degron is accommodated in an acidic pocket by five conserved hydrogen bonds. These structures, together with biochemical studies, decipher the molecular basis for the specific recognition of the Gly/N-degron by ZYG11B and ZER1, providing key information for future structure-based chemical probe design.

Abstract: Summary
Cells communicate with their environment via surface proteins and secreted factors. Unconventional protein secretion (UPS) is an evolutionarily conserved process, via which distinct cargo proteins are secreted upon stress. Most UPS types depend upon the Golgi-associated GRASP55 protein. However, its regulation and biological role remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) directly phosphorylates GRASP55 to maintain its Golgi localization, thus revealing a physiological role for mTORC1 at this organelle. Stimuli that inhibit mTORC1 cause GRASP55 dephosphorylation and relocalization to UPS compartments. Through multiple, unbiased, proteomic analyses, we identify numerous cargoes that follow this unconventional secretory route to reshape the cellular secretome and surfactome. Using MMP2 secretion as a proxy for UPS, we provide important insights on its regulation and physiological role. Collectively, our findings reveal the mTORC1-GRASP55 signaling hub as the integration point in stress signaling upstream of UPS and as a key coordinator of the cellular adaptation to stress.

Abstract: Cyclase-associated protein 2 (CAP2) has been addressed as a candidate biomarker in various cancer types. Previously, we have shown that CAP2 is expressed during multi-step hepatocarcinogenesis; however, its underlying mechanisms in liver cancer cells are not fully elucidated yet. Here, we demonstrated that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induced CAP2 expression, and which promoted migration and invasion of liver cancer cells. We also found that the ER stress-induced CAP2 expression is mediated through activation of protein kinase C epsilon (PKCε) and the promotor binding of activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2). In addition, we further demonstrated that CAP2 expression promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through activation of Rac1 and ERK. In conclusion, we suggest that ER stress induces CAP2 expression promoting EMT in liver cancer cells. Our results shed light on the novel functions of CAP2 in the metastatic process of liver cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
In every organism, the cell cycle requires the execution of multiple processes in a strictly defined order. However, the mechanisms used to ensure such order remain poorly understood, particularly in bacteria. Here, we show that the activation of the essential CtrA signaling pathway that triggers cell division in Caulobacter crescentus is intrinsically coupled to the initiation of DNA replication via the physical translocation of a newly replicated chromosome, powered by the ParABS system. We demonstrate that ParA accumulation at the new cell pole during chromosome segregation recruits ChpT, an intermediate component of the CtrA signaling pathway. ChpT is normally restricted from accessing the selective PopZ polar microdomain until the new chromosome and ParA arrive. Consequently, any disruption to DNA replication initiation prevents ChpT polarization and, in turn, cell division. Collectively, our findings reveal how major cell-cycle events are coordinated in Caulobacter and, importantly, how chromosome translocation triggers an essential signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Liver fibrosis is a strong predictor of long-term mortality in individuals with metabolic-associated fatty liver disease; yet, the mechanisms underlying the progression from the comparatively benign fatty liver state to advanced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and liver fibrosis are incompletely understood. Using cell-type-resolved genomics, we show that comprehensive alterations in hepatocyte genomic and transcriptional settings during NASH progression, led to a loss of hepatocyte identity. The hepatocyte reprogramming was under tight cooperative control of a network of fibrosis-activated transcription factors, as exemplified by the transcription factor Elf-3 (ELF3) and zinc finger protein GLIS2 (GLIS2). Indeed, ELF3- and GLIS2-controlled fibrosis-dependent hepatokine genes targeting disease-associated hepatic stellate cell gene programs. Thus, interconnected transcription factor networks not only promoted hepatocyte dysfunction but also directed the intra-hepatic crosstalk necessary for NASH and fibrosis progression, implying that molecular “hub-centered” targeting strategies are superior to existing mono-target approaches as currently used in NASH therapy.

Abstract: Summary
The Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway suppresses transposable elements and promotes fertility in diverse organisms. Maturation of piRNAs involves pre-piRNA trimming followed by 2′-O-methylation at their 3′ termini. Here, we report that the 3′ termini of Caenorhabditis elegans piRNAs are subject to nontemplated nucleotide addition, and piRNAs with 3′ addition exhibit extensive base-pairing interaction with their target RNAs. Animals deficient for PARN-1 (pre-piRNA trimmer) and HENN-1 (2′-O-methyltransferase) accumulate piRNAs with 3′ nontemplated nucleotides. In henn-1 mutants, piRNAs are shortened prior to 3′ addition, whereas long isoforms of untrimmed piRNAs are preferentially modified in parn-1 mutant animals. Loss of either PARN-1 or HENN-1 results in modest reduction in steady-state levels of piRNAs. Deletion of both enzymes leads to depletion of piRNAs, desilenced piRNA targets, and impaired fecundity. Together, our findings suggest that pre-piRNA trimming and 2′-O-methylation act collaboratively to protect piRNAs from tailing and degradation.

Abstract: Summary
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide, in which adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutations are frequently and uniquely observed. Here we find that cis-HOX (circular RNA stabilizing HOXC10) is robustly expressed in colorectal tumor-initiating cells (TICs). cis-HOX knockout decreases colorectal TIC numbers and impairs the self-renewal, tumorigenesis, and metastatic capacities of TICs, whereas cis-HOX overexpression drives colorectal TIC self-renewal and metastasis. Mechanistically, cis-HOX binds to HOXC10 mRNA to attenuate its decay through blocking the K-homology splicing regulatory protein (KSRP)-binding sequence of HOXC10 3′ UTR. HOXC10 is highly expressed in colorectal tumors and TICs and triggers Wnt/β-catenin activation by activating FZD3 expression. HOXC10 inhibitor salinomycin exerts efficient therapeutic effects in APC-wild-type colorectal tumors, but not in tumors with APC nonsense mutations. Therefore, the cis-HOX-HOXC10 pathway drives colorectal tumorigenesis, stemness, and metastasis and serves as a potential therapeutic target for APC-wild-type colorectal tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) alone and during co-infection with influenza A virus (IAV) can result in severe pneumonia with mortality. Pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) is an established virulence factor required for Spn evasion of lactoferricin and C-reactive protein-activated complement-mediated killing. Herein, we show that PspA functions as an adhesin to dying host cells. We demonstrate that PspA binds to host-derived glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) bound to outward-flipped phosphatidylserine residues on dying host cells. PspA-mediated adhesion was to apoptotic, pyroptotic, and necroptotic cells, but not healthy lung cells. Using isogenic mutants of Spn, we show that PspA-GAPDH-mediated binding to lung cells increases pneumococcal localization in the lower airway, and this is enhanced as a result of pneumolysin exposure or co-infection with IAV. PspA-mediated binding to GAPDH requires amino acids 230–281 in its α-helical domain with intratracheal inoculation of this PspA fragment alongside the bacteria reducing disease severity in an IAV/Spn pneumonia model.

Abstract: Summary
Synaptic structural plasticity, key to long-term memory storage, requires translation of localized RNAs delivered by long-distance transport from the neuronal cell body. Mechanisms and regulation of this system remain elusive. Here, we explore the roles of KIF5C and KIF3A, two members of kinesin superfamily of molecular motors (Kifs), and find that loss of function of either kinesin decreases dendritic arborization and spine density whereas gain of function of KIF5C enhances it. KIF5C function is a rate-determining component of local translation and is associated with ∼650 RNAs, including EIF3G, a regulator of translation initiation, and plasticity-associated RNAs. Loss of function of KIF5C in dorsal hippocampal CA1 neurons constrains both spatial and contextual fear memory, whereas gain of function specifically enhances spatial memory and extinction of contextual fear. KIF5C-mediated long-distance transport of local translation substrates proves a key mechanism underlying structural plasticity and memory.
