Abstract: Summary
Neuroferritinopathy (NF) is a movement disorder caused by alterations in the L-ferritin gene that generate cytosolic free iron. NF is a unique pathophysiological model for determining the direct consequences of cell iron dysregulation. We established lines of induced pluripotent stem cells from fibroblasts from two NF patients and one isogenic control obtained by CRISPR/Cas9 technology. NF fibroblasts, neural progenitors, and neurons exhibited the presence of increased cytosolic iron, which was also detectable as: ferritin aggregates, alterations in the iron parameters, oxidative damage, and the onset of a senescence phenotype, particularly severe in the neurons. In this spontaneous senescence model, NF cells had impaired survival and died by ferroptosis. Thus, non-ferritin-bound iron is sufficient per se to cause both cell senescence and ferroptotic cell death in human fibroblasts and neurons. These results provide strong evidence supporting the primary role of iron in neuronal aging and degeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Generation of functional β cells from pluripotent sources would accelerate diagnostic and therapeutic applications for diabetes research and therapy. However, it has been challenging to generate competent β cells with dynamic insulin-secretory capacity to glucose and incretin stimulations. We introduced transcription factors, critical for β-cell development and function, in differentiating human induced pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) and assessed the impact on the functionality of derived β-cell (psBC) progeny. A perifusion system revealed stepwise transduction of the PDX1, NEUROG3, and MAFA triad (PNM) enabled in vitro generation of psBCs with glucose and GLP-1 responsiveness within 3 weeks. PNM transduction upregulated genes associated with glucose sensing, insulin secretion, and β-cell maturation. In recipient diabetic mice, PNM-transduced psBCs showed glucose-responsive insulin secretion as early as 1 week post transplantation. Thus, enhanced pre-emptive β-cell specification of PSCs by PNM drives generation of glucose- and incretin-responsive psBCs in vitro, offering a competent tissue-primed biotherapy.

Abstract: Aberrant activation of Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) pathway has been implicated in a variety of cancers including cholangiocarcinoma (CC); however, the influencing factors are still unknown. Additionally, intratumoral hypoxia is known to contribute towards therapeutic resistance through modulatory effects on various pathways. In this study, we investigated the relationship between hypoxia and SHH pathway activation and the effect of this interplay on cancer stemness and epithelial-to- mesenchymal transition (EMT) during cholangiocarcinogenesis. Hypoxia promoted SHH pathway activation, evidenced by upregulated SHH and SMO levels, and enhanced glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (GLI1) nuclear translocation; whereas silencing of HIF-1α impaired SHH upregulation. Hypoxia also enhanced the expression of cancer stem cell (CSC) transcription factors (NANOG, Oct4, SOX2), CD133 and EMT markers (N-cadherin, Vimentin), thereby supporting invasion. Cyclopamine treatment suppressed hypoxia induced SHH pathway activation, consequently reducing invasiveness by downregulating the expression of CSC transcription factors, CD133 and EMT. Cyclopamine induced apoptosis in CC cells under hypoxia, suggesting that hypoxia induced activation of SHH pathway has modulatory effects on CC progression. Therefore, SHH signaling is proposed as a target for CC treatment, which is refractory to standard chemotherapy.

Abstract: Stimulation of Gaq-coupled receptors triggers the activation of gene transcription via a rise of intracellular Ca2+. To investigate the role of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin in regulating transcription following Gαq-coupled receptor stimulation, we used a gain-of-function approach and expressed ΔCnA, a constitutively active mutant of calcineurin A. Furthermore, we expressed hM3Dq, a designer receptor that is specifically coupled to Gαq and can be activated by the pharmacological compound clozapine-N-oxide. Stimulation of hM3Dq or expression of ΔCnA induced transcription of a reporter gene controlled by the calcineurin substrate nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), suggesting that calcineurin increased NFAT-regulated gene transcription. In contrast, expression of ΔCnA attenuated hM3Dq-induced biosynthesis of the transcription factors c-Fos and Egr-1 and reduced both c-Fos and Egr-1 promoter activities. A dissection of the c-Fos and Egr-1 promoters revealed that calcineurin inhibited serum response element-mediated transcription. In particular, the expression of ΔCnA reduced the transcriptional activity of the ternary complex factor Elk-1 following stimulation of hM3Dq receptors. Furthermore, ΔCnA reduced the transcriptional activity of the transcription factor CREB and thus attenuated transcription mediated by the cAMP response element. In summary, we show that calcineurin functions as a positive and negative modulator of gene transcription.

Abstract: Summary
During infection, Legionella pneumophila translocates over 300 effector proteins into the host cytosol, allowing the pathogen to establish an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-like Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV) that supports bacterial replication. Here, we perform a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen and secondary targeted screens in U937 human monocyte/macrophage-like cells to systematically identify host factors that regulate killing by L. pneumophila. The screens reveal known host factors hijacked by L. pneumophila, as well as genes spanning diverse trafficking and signaling pathways previously not linked to L. pneumophila pathogenesis. We further characterize C1orf43 and KIAA1109 as regulators of phagocytosis and show that RAB10 and its chaperone RABIF are required for optimal L. pneumophila replication and ER recruitment to the LCV. Finally, we show that Rab10 protein is recruited to the LCV and ubiquitinated by the effectors SidC/SdcA. Collectively, our results provide a wealth of previously undescribed insights into L. pneumophila pathogenesis and mammalian cell function.

Abstract: Given the critical role of the tumor microenvironment in PCa progression, we aimed to assess the prognostic effect of tumor infiltrating M2 macrophages (TIMMs) on biochemical recurrence (BCR) in patients with localized prostate cancer (PCa) after radical prostatectomy. A total of 127 localized PCa patients from GSE116918, 268 patients from TCGA database and 77 patients from GSE70770 were enrolled in our study. TIMMs were evaluated by the CIBERSORT method. Patients with high TIMMs had a significantly poorer recurrence free survival (RFS) (P = 0.017, P = 0.0063 and P = 0.001) in the three sets. In the multivariate analysis, the presence of high TIMMs (HR = 3.026, P = 0.023; HR = 2.679, P = 0.017; HR = 2.648, P = 0.005) was identified as an independent prognostic factor for RFS in the three sets. Harrell's Concordance index (C-index) increased in all three sets after combining TIMMs with traditional risk factors (PSA, clinical stage(T) and Gleason score). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis showed that T cell receptor signaling pathway, B cell receptor signaling pathway and primary immunodeficiency were significantly enriched in the low TIMMs group. TIMMs could serve as an independent prognostic factor for BCR in localized PCa patients after RP. Incorporation of TIMMs into traditional risk classification might further stratify patients with different prognosis.

Abstract: The purpose of the current study was to demonstrate the neuroprotective effect of protodioscin (Prot) in an in vitro model of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) and investigate the underlying molecular mechanism. After PC12 cells were exposed to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) reperfusion, PI staining by flow cytometry was used to quantify the rate of apoptosis. The levels of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were determined using commercially available kits. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was detected using the 20,70-dichlorodihy-drofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) fluorescence assay. The expression levels of heat-shock proteins (HSP), PI3K, AKT, Nrf2, and miR-124 were tested by western blot or quantitative PCR. Prot significantly attenuated oxygen–glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R)-induced apoptotic death. Prot also reduced the oxidative stress as revealed by increasing the activities of SOD and GSH-Px, decreasing the levels of ROS and MDA. Moreover, mechanism investigations suggested that Prot prevented the decrease of HSP70, HSP32 (hemeoxygenase-1, HO-1), and PI3K protein expression, phosphorylation of AKT, and the accumulation of nuclear Nrf2. The level of miR-124 was decreased in PC12 cells, which was also effectively reversed by Prot treatment. Prot protected PC12 cells against OGD/R-induced injury through inhibiting oxidative stress and apoptosis, which could be associated with increasing HSP proteins expression via activating PI3K/AKT/Nrf2 pathway and miR-124 modulation.

Abstract: Summary
Degradable crosslinkers that respond to intracellular biological stimuli are a critical component of many drug delivery systems. With numerous stimuli-responsive drug delivery systems in development, it is important to quantitatively study their intracellular processing. Herein we report a framework for quantifying the rate of intracellular bond degradation in the endocytic pathway. Toward this end, we devised and synthesized a reduction-sensitive FRET-based crosslinker that can be readily conjugated to a variety of targeting ligands. This crosslinker was conjugated to trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against the HER2 receptor. We developed a model based on mass-action kinetics to describe the intracellular processing of this conjugate. The kinetic model was developed in conjunction with live-cell experiments to extract the rate constant for intracellular disulfide bond degradation. This framework may be applied to other endocytosis pathways, bond types, and cell types to quantify this fundamental degradation rate parameter.

Abstract: Summary
Polycomb-directed repression of gene expression is frequently misregulated in human diseases. A quantitative and target-specific cellular assay was utilized to discover the first potent positive allosteric modulator (PAM) peptidomimetic, UNC4976, of nucleic acid binding by CBX7, a chromodomain methyl-lysine reader of Polycomb repressive complex 1. The PAM activity of UNC4976 resulted in enhanced efficacy across three orthogonal cellular assays by simultaneously antagonizing H3K27me3-specific recruitment of CBX7 to target genes while increasing non-specific binding to DNA and RNA. PAM activity thereby reequilibrates PRC1 away from H3K27me3 target regions. Together, our discovery and characterization of UNC4976 not only revealed the most cellularly potent PRC1-specific chemical probe to date, but also uncovers a potential mechanism of Polycomb regulation with implications for non-histone lysine methylated interaction partners.

Abstract: Summary
Viral rebound upon stopping combined antiretroviral therapy poses a major barrier toward an HIV cure. Cellular and anatomical sources responsible for reinitiating viral replication remain a subject of ardent debate, despite extensive research efforts. To unravel the source of rebounding viruses, we conducted a large-scale HIV-STAR (HIV-1 sequencing before analytical treatment interruption to identify the anatomically relevant HIV reservoir) clinical trial. We collected samples from 11 participants and compared the genetic composition of (pro)viruses collected under treatment from different cellular and anatomical compartments with that of plasma viruses sampled during analytical treatment interruption. We found a remarkably heterogeneous source of viral rebound. In addition, irrespective of the compartment or cell subset, genetically identical viral expansions played a significant role in viral rebound. Our study suggests that although there does not seem to be a primary source for rebound HIV, cellular proliferation is an important driver of HIV persistence and should therefore be considered in future curative strategies.

Abstract: Tetraspanin 15 (Tspan15) is a member of the tetraspanin family, which is associated with various biological events and several diseases, however, its role in human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains unknown. The current study aimed to clarify the role of Tspan15 in OSCC. The mRNA and protein expression levels of Tspan15 were up-regulated in OSCC cases and OSCC-derived cell lines. Significant up-regulated Tspan15 expression was found in the advanced OSCC cases; primary tumoral size (P = 0.042), regional lymph node metastasis (P = 0.036) and TNM classification (P = 0.024). The decreased expression of Tspan15 did not significantly affect cellular proliferation, whereas tumoral invasion and migration activities were suppressed in Tspan15-down-regulated cells, suggesting that Tspan15 might activate metastasis-related signaling. Moreover, in the Tspan15-down-regulated cells, the expression of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) 10 was also down-regulated and the cells secreted less soluble N-cadherin compared with control cells. And weak immunoreactivity of β-catenin in the nucleus was detected in Tspan15-down-regulated cells compared with the control cells. These findings suggested that overexpression of Tspan15 positively regulates development of OSCC, and that ADAM10, N-cadherin, β-catenin might be involved in the Tspan15-mediated pathway. These unusual conditions of cell adhesion molecules may lead to high metastasis rate found in Tspan15-overexpressing cases.

Abstract: Summary
Soon after fertilization, the few totipotent cells of mammalian embryos diverge to form a structure called the blastocyst (BC). Although numerous cell types, including germ cells and extended-pluripotency stem cells, have been developed from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) in vitro, generating functional BCs only from PSCs remains elusive. Here, we describe induced self-organizing 3D BC-like cysts (iBLCs) generated from mouse PSC culture. Resembling natural BCs, iBLCs have a blastocoel-like cavity and were formed with outer cells expressing trophectoderm lineage markers and with inner cells expressing pluripotency markers. iBLCs transplanted to pseudopregnant mice uteruses implanted, induced decidualization, and exhibited growth and development before resorption, demonstrating that iBLCs are implantation competent. iBLC precursor intermediates required the transcription factor Prdm14 and concomitantly activated the totipotency-related cleavage-stage MERVL reporter and 2C genes. Thus, our system may contribute to the understanding of molecular mechanisms underpinning totipotency, embryogenesis, and implantation.

Abstract: Summary
The distinct states of pluripotency in the pre- and post-implantation embryo can be captured in vitro as naive and primed pluripotent stem cell cultures, respectively. The study and application of the naive state remains hampered, particularly in humans, partially due to current culture protocols relying on extraneous undefined factors such as feeders. Here we performed a small-molecule screen to identify compounds that facilitate chemically defined establishment and maintenance of human feeder-independent naive embryonic (FINE) stem cells. The expression profile in genic and repetitive elements of FINE cells resembles the 8-cell-to-morula stage in vivo, and only differs from feeder-dependent naive cells in genes involved in cell-cell/cell-matrix interactions. FINE cells offer several technical advantages, such as increased amenability to transfection and a longer period of genomic stability, compared with feeder-dependent cells. Thus, FINE cells will serve as an accessible and useful system for scientific and translational applications of naïve pluripotent stem cells.

Abstract: The concentration of circulating heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) was measured in liquid biopsies of canine tumor patients as a potential biomarker. Compared with rodent tumor models, spontaneously occurring tumors in pet dogs reflect the clinical situation of human patients better, as dogs cohabitate with their owners in the same environment, reach a much older age than rodents, can provide blood samples much more frequently, and receive up-to-date medical care and, similar to humans, their tumors show a high genetic heterogeneity. Due to the species-specific sequence homology of human and canine Hsp70, two human enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) systems (R&D and lipHsp70) were used to measure canine Hsp70 concentrations in serum and plasma. In general, higher Hsp70 concentrations were found in serum compared with plasma samples of dogs, and the lipHsp70 ELISA detected higher peak concentrations of Hsp70 in a broader range than the R&D ELISA. Compared with a tumor-free control group, serum Hsp70 concentrations were higher in tumor-bearing dogs, irrespective of breed, age, body weight, and gender. A sub-classification of the different tumors according to their cytological characteristics revealed significantly elevated Hsp70 serum concentrations in dogs with round cell tumors (p < 0.01), a heterogeneous group of malignancies with hematopoietic origin such as mast cells, plasma cells, lymphocytes, histiocytes, and melanomas. Future studies with larger patient cohorts and well-defined tumor sizes are necessary to elucidate the role of serum Hsp70 as a biomarker for tumor detection and monitoring of outcome in pet animals.

Abstract: Elevated plasma free fatty acids level has been implicated in the development of insulin resistance, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction in diabetic and nondiabetic individuals. However, the underlying mechanisms still remain to be defined. Herein, we investigated the effect of palmitic acid (PA), the most abundant saturated fatty acid in the human body, on small-conductance Ca2+-activated potassium channels (KCa2.3)-mediated relaxation in rodent resistance arteries and the underlying molecular mechanism. The effect of PA on KCa2.3 in endothelium was evaluated using real-time PCR, Western blotting, whole-cell patch voltage-clamp, wire and pressure myograph system, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured by using dihydroethidium and 2′, 7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate. KCa2.3-mediated vasodilatation responses to acetylcholine and NS309 (agonist of KCa2.3 and KCa3.1) were impaired by incubation of normal mesenteric arteries with 100 μM PA for 24 h. In cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), PA decreased KCa2.3 current and expression at mRNA and protein levels. Incubation with the NADPH oxidase (Nox) inhibitor dibenziodolium (DPI) partly inhibited the PA-induced ROS production and restored KCa2.3 expression. Inhibition of either p38-MAPK or NF-κB using specific inhibitors (SB203580, SB202190 or Bay11-7082, pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate) attenuated PA-induced downregulation of KCa2.3 and inhibition of p38-MAPK also attenuated PA-induced phosphorylation of NF-κB p65. Furthermore, DPI reversed the increment of phospho-p38-MAPK by PA. These results demonstrated that PA downregulated KCa2.3 expressions via Nox/ROS/p38-MAPK/NF-κB signaling leading to endothelial vasodilatory dysfunction.

Abstract: IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is a mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis which often shows proteinuria, an indicator for podocyte damage. TGF-β1 has been known to contribute to podocyte injury by inducing apoptosis, cytoskeleton relocation or cytoskeleton loss. And Decorin, a small proteoglycan known to neutralize TGF-β1, was reported to induce autophagy in vascular endothelial cells. However, it remains unknown how TGF-β1 and Decorin can affect podocyte autophagy in mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis. In this study, we used in vivo and in vitro models to find out the effect of TGF-β1 and Decorin on podocyte autophagy. P-rpS6 and p-ULK1 were detected by Western blot to show the activation of mTORC1 pathway following TGF-β1 treatment. Also, we collected serum from IgAN patients and anti-Thy1.1 nephritis, and quantified TGF-β1 and Decorin using ELISA. Together, we showed that TGF-β1 could activate mTORC1 and inhibit autophagy, while Decorin has precisely the opposite effect. As the mesangial cells (MCs) proliferate, TGF-β1 increases and Decorin decreases in the serum of IgAN and anti-Thy1.1 nephritis. This finding deepened our understanding regarding how MC proliferation could finally result in podocyte dysfunction.

Abstract: Summary
Surviving infection requires immune and repair mechanisms. Developing organisms face the additional challenge of integrating these mechanisms with tightly controlled developmental processes. The larval Drosophila midgut lacks dedicated intestinal stem cells. We show that, upon infection, larvae perform limited repair using adult midgut precursors (AMPs). AMPs differentiate in response to damage to generate new enterocytes, transiently depleting their pool. Developmental delay allows for AMP reconstitution, ensuring the completion of metamorphosis. Notch signaling is required for the differentiation of AMPs into the encasing, niche-like peripheral cells (PCs), but not to differentiate PCs into enterocytes. Dpp (TGF-β) signaling is sufficient, but not necessary, to induce PC differentiation into enterocytes. Infection-induced JAK-STAT pathway is both required and sufficient for differentiation of AMPs and PCs into new enterocytes. Altogether, this work highlights the constraints imposed by development on an organism’s response to infection and demonstrates the transient use of adult precursors for tissue repair.

Abstract: Summary
Reversibly switchable fluorescent proteins (RSFPs) are crucial tags for super-resolution observation of protein localization and dynamics inside living cells. However, due to the high fluorescence pKa (∼5–6) of most RSFPs, their usage in acidic conditions (pH 4.5–6.0) has been limited. Here, we investigated a new photochromic mechanism in Gamillus, a recently developed green fluorescent protein with acid tolerance. Gamillus exhibits negative switching with especially high contrast in acidic conditions, and its off switching is caused by trans-to-cis isomerization of the chromophore hydroxyphenyl ring that accompanies protonation. Through a combination of rational design and saturation mutagenesis, we developed two variants with enhanced switching contrasts and off-switching speeds, designated rsGamillus-S and rsGamillus-F, respectively. The fluorescence intensity, off-switching speed, and switching contrast of the rsGamillus variants are only slightly affected by changes in pH between 4.5 and 7.5. Exploiting these properties, we succeeded in high-contrast super-resolution imaging of cellular architectures in acidic conditions.

Abstract: The anatomic arrangement of microvascular endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes in vivo enables close interactions among these cells. In our in vitro co-culture system, ANP and BNP expression in the mouse atrial cardiomyocyte cell line HL-1 and subsequent ANP release were significantly upregulated when co-cultured with mouse cardiac microvascular endothelial cells or exposed to endothelial cell-conditioned medium. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) activation of endothelial cells remarkably enhanced their paracrine effect on cardiomyocyte gene expression, suggesting that ET-1 stimulation of endothelial cells affects expression of fetal genes such as ANP and BNP in adult cardiomyocytes through paracrine signalling. Exposure of HL-1 cells and murine induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) to authentic angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) caused a concentration-dependent decrease in ANP expression while ET-1-induced ANP expression was augmented by low but inhibited by high concentrations of Ang2. FK506-mediated inhibition of the calcineurin-NFAT pathway in the HL-1 cells selectively inhibited the stimulatory effect of the conditioned medium derived from ET-1-pre-stimulated endothelial cells on cardiomyocyte fetal gene expression. Combined with previous results indicating a crucial role for ANP and BNP in cardiac homeostasis, our findings provide further evidence that paracrine signalling by cardiac microvascular endothelial cells modulates cardiomyocyte function.

Abstract: Exercise is capable of inducing the cellular stress response and increasing skeletal muscle heat shock protein (HSP) content. HSPs function as molecular chaperones and play roles in facilitating protein folding thereby contributing to muscle proteostasis. To determine the relationship between muscle contraction types, muscle damage, and HSP content, one tibialis anterior (TA) muscle from male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 5/group) was electrically stimulated while actively lengthening (LC), shortening (SC), or remaining to stagnate (IC) for 15 repetitions (3 sets of five). Two additional LC groups underwent 5 and 10 repetitions. Maximal tetanic tension (MTT) was recorded prior to (pre) and at 5 min after (post) the last contraction. Twenty-four hours after stimulation, TA muscles were removed, processed, and assessed for damage and for HSP25 and HSP72 content. Post-MTT was significantly decreased following 15 LCs, (24%; p < 0.05) but not following 15 SCs or 15 ICs. Post-MTT was also decreased by 8% (p < 0.05), and 18% (p < 0.05) for muscles subjected to 5 and 10 LCs, respectively. HSP72 content increased after all LCs conditions but not following ICs or SCs. HSP25 content remained unchanged following all contractions. Similarly, muscle damage was observed only after LCs and not after other contraction types. In conclusion, muscle HSP72 content can be increased with as few as 5 maximal lengthening contractions and appears to be related to muscle damage. This may have important implications for muscle rehabilitation and exercise training programs.

Abstract: Summary
Imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase (ImGPS) is an allosteric bienzyme complex in which substrate binding to the synthase subunit HisF stimulates the glutaminase subunit HisH. To control this stimulation with light, we have incorporated the photo-responsive unnatural amino acids phenylalanine-4′-azobenzene (AzoF), o-nitropiperonyl-O-tyrosine (NPY), and methyl-o-nitropiperonyllysine (mNPK) at strategic positions of HisF. The light-mediated isomerization of AzoF at position 55 (fS55AzoFE ↔ fS55AzoFZ) resulted in a reversible 10-fold regulation of HisH activity. The light-mediated decaging of NPY at position 39 (fY39NPY → fY39) and of mNPK at position 99 (fK99mNPK → fK99) led to a 4- to 6-fold increase of HisH activity. Molecular dynamics simulations explained how the unnatural amino acids interfere with the allosteric machinery of ImGPS and revealed additional aspects of HisH stimulation in wild-type ImGPS. Our findings show that unnatural amino acids can be used as a powerful tool for the spatiotemporal control of a central metabolic enzyme complex by light.

Abstract: A long-term hepatocyte culture maintaining liver-specific functions is very essential for both basic research and the development of bioartificial liver devices in clinical application. However, primary hepatocytes rapidly lose their proliferation and hepatic functions over a few days in culture. This work is to establish an ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD) patient-derived primary human hepatocyte (OTCD-PHH) culture with hepatic functions for providing an in vitro cell model. Liver tissue from an infant with OTCD was dispersed into single cells. The cells were cultured using conditional reprogramming. To characterize the cells, we assessed activities and mRNA expression of CYP3A4, 1A1, 2C9, as well as albumin and urea secretion. We found that the OTCD-PHH can be subpassaged for more than 15 passages. The cells do not express mRNA of fibroblast-specific maker, whereas they highly express markers of epithelial cells and hepatocytes. In addition, the OTCD-PHH retain native CYP3A4, 1A1, 2C9 activities and albumin secretion function at early passages. The OTCD-PHH at passages 2, 6, 9 and 13 have identical DNA fingerprint as the original tissue. Furthermore, under 3D culture environment, low urea production and hepatocyte marker staining of the OTCD-PHH were detected. The established OTCD-PHH maintain liver-specific functions at early passages and can be long-term cultured in vitro. We believe the established long-term OTCD-PHH culture is highly relevant to study liver diseases, particularly in infants with OTCD.

Abstract: Summary
Organoid technologies have become a powerful emerging tool to model liver diseases, for drug screening, and for personalized treatments. These applications are, however, limited in their capacity to generate functional hepatocytes in a reproducible and efficient manner. Here, we generated and characterized the hepatic organoid (eHEPO) culture system using human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived EpCAM-positive endodermal cells as an intermediate. eHEPOs can be produced within 2 weeks and expanded long term (>16 months) without any loss of differentiation capacity to mature hepatocytes. Starting from patient-specific iPSCs, we modeled citrullinemia type 1, a urea cycle disorder caused by mutations in the argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS1) enzyme. The disease-related ammonia accumulation phenotype in eHEPOs could be reversed by the overexpression of the wild-type ASS1 gene, which also indicated that this model is amenable to genetic manipulation. Thus, eHEPOs are excellent unlimited cell sources to generate functional hepatic organoids in a fast and efficient manner.

Abstract: Development of neural tube has been extensively modeled in vitro using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) that are able to form radially organized cellular structures called neural rosettes. While a great amount of research has been done using neural rosettes, studies have only inadequately addressed how rosettes are formed and what the molecular mechanisms and pathways involved in their formation are. Here we address this question by detailed analysis of the expression of pluripotency and differentiation-associated proteins during the early onset of differentiation of hPSCs towards neural rosettes. Additionally, we show that the BMP signaling is likely contributing to the formation of the complex cluster of neural rosettes and its inhibition leads to the altered expression of PAX6, SOX2 and SOX1 proteins and the rosette morphology. Finally, we provide evidence that the mechanism of neural rosettes formation in vitro is reminiscent of the process of secondary neurulation rather than that of primary neurulation in vivo. Since secondary neurulation is a largely unexplored process, its understanding will ultimately assist the development of methods to prevent caudal neural tube defects in humans.

Abstract: Summary
Neuronal activity can be modeled as a nonlinear dynamical system to yield measures of neuronal state and dysfunction. The electrical recordings of stem cell-derived neurons from individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and controls were analyzed using minimum embedding dimension (MED) analysis to characterize their dynamical complexity. MED analysis revealed a significant reduction in dynamical complexity in ASD neurons during differentiation, which was correlated to bursting and spike interval measures. MED was associated with clinical endpoints, such as nonverbal intelligence, and was correlated with 53 differentially expressed genes, which were overrepresented with ASD risk genes related to neurodevelopment, cell morphology, and cell migration. Spatiotemporal analysis also showed a prenatal temporal enrichment in cortical and deep brain structures. Together, we present dynamical analysis as a paradigm that can be used to distinguish disease-associated cellular electrophysiological and transcriptional signatures, while taking into account patient variability in neuropsychiatric disorders.

Abstract: Summary
CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy) is the most common form of genetic stroke and vascular dementia syndrome resulting from mutations in NOTCH3. To elucidate molecular mechanisms of the condition and identify drug targets, we established a patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) model and demonstrated for the first time a failure of the patient iPSC-derived vascular mural cells (iPSC-MCs) in engaging and stabilizing endothelial capillary structures. The patient iPSC-MCs had reduced platelet-derived growth factor receptor β, decreased secretion of the angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), were highly susceptible to apoptotic insults, and could induce apoptosis of adjacent endothelial cells. Supplementation of VEGF significantly rescued the capillary destabilization. Small interfering RNA knockdown of NOTCH3 in iPSC-MCs revealed a gain-of-function mechanism for the mutant NOTCH3. These disease mechanisms likely delay brain repair after stroke in CADASIL, contributing to the brain hypoperfusion and dementia in this condition, and will help to identify potential drug targets.

Abstract: Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) represent a unique opportunity to study fundamental biological processes in a human- and cell-specific setting. Its translational potential and the impact on human health makes this technology revolutionary. The possibility to generate stem cells from almost any somatic cell, and their capacity to be differentiated in virtually all cells of the body has been demonstrated extensively during the last decade of research. Target-centric as well as phenotypic screenings using differentiated cells have become a reality, while the use of these cells for “disease modelling” is still challenging due to the paucity of relevant and reproducible phenotypes. The combination of hPSCs with gene editing technologies aiming to e.g. reduce immunogenic response has enabled promising clinical trials that will eventually demonstrate their therapeutic potential in tissue regeneration and cancer treatment. Maximizing the therapeutic applications of hPSCs requires systematic data comparison, consensus between scientists and health care professionals, as well as a close collaboration between research labs, clinics, and regulators. The goal of this review is to provide a comprehensive outlook of the current use of hPSCs in drug development and regenerative medicine for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders. In the first part, we analyse how hPSCs are currently used in drug development and discuss their use in challenging paradigms such as neurodegeneration. In the second part we review the status of hPSCs in regenerative medicine. Finally, key challenges and pitfalls of the technology will be discussed, and strategies proposed to improve hPSC research and to benefit patients across different therapeutic areas.

Abstract: Objectives
Immunotherapy and personalized medicine therapeutics are emerging as promising approaches in the management of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). In spite of that, there is yet no assay that could predict individual response to immunotherapy.
Methods
We manufactured an in vitro 3D microfluidic chip to test the efficacy of immunotherapy. The assay was first tested using a tongue cancer cell line (HSC-3) embedded in a human tumour-derived matrix “Myogel/fibrin” and immune cells from three healthy donors. Next, the chips were used with freshly isolated cancer cells, patients' serum and immune cells. Chips were loaded with different immune checkpoint inhibitors, PD-L1 antibody and IDO 1 inhibitor. Migration of immune cells towards cancer cells and the cancer cell proliferation rate were evaluated.
Results
Immune cell migration towards HSC-3 cells was cancer cell density dependent. IDO 1 inhibitor induced immune cells to migrate towards cancer cells both in HSC-3 and in two HNSCC patient samples. Efficacy of PD-L1 antibody and IDO 1 inhibitor was patient dependent.
Conclusion
We introduced the first humanized in vitro microfluidic chip assay to test immunotherapeutic drugs against HNSCC patient samples. This assay could be used to predict the efficacy of immunotherapeutic drugs for individual patients.

Abstract: Background
Islet stellate cells (ISCs) play a critical role in islet fibrosis, contributing to the progression of pancreatic diseases. Previous studies have focused on fibrosis-associated activated ISCs obtained by standard islet explant techniques. However, in vitro models of quiescent ISCs (qISCs) are lacking. This study aims to develop a method to isolate qISCs and analyze their phenotype during activation.
Methods
Immunofluorescence staining was applied to localize ISCs in normal human, rat, and mouse islets. qISCs were isolated from rat islets using density gradient centrifugation (DGC) method. qRT-PCR, immunoblotting, proliferation, and migration assays were employed for their characterization.
Results
Desmin-positive ISCs were detected in normal human, rat, and mouse islets. Freshly isolated qISCs, obtained by density gradient centrifugation, displayed a polygonal appearance with refringent cytoplasmic lipid droplets and expressed transcriptional markers indicating a low activation/quiescent state. With increasing culture time, the marker expression pattern changed, reflecting ISC activation. qISCs contained more lipid droplets and exhibited lower proliferation and migration abilities compared to spindle-shaped ISCs obtained by traditional explant techniques.
Conclusions
This study describes a new method for efficient isolation of qISCs from rat islets, representing a useful in vitro tool to study the biology of ISCs in more physiological conditions.

Abstract: Porcine embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells (ESCs; iPSCs) have proven difficult to derive and maintain in vitro. This may be due to inappropriate culturing conditions and incomplete activation of proper pluripotency networks. To this end, we characterized the transcriptome of porcine inner cell mass, epiblast, and transgene-dependent iPSCs in relation to human and mouse embryonic and epiblast stem cells. We found that porcine inner cell mass has a unique pluripotency transcriptome distinct from human and mouse ESCs but shares more features with human naïve-like than primed stem cell states, as illustrated by their expression of KLF17 but not KLF2. Our data further show that current reprogramming strategies fail to silence parental fibroblast-specific genes and to activate specific signalling pathways that may be important for porcine pluripotency. Accordingly, we used human naïve culturing conditions to improve reprogramming efficiencies of porcine embryonic fibroblasts and enable essential naïve stem cell markers such as NANOG, KLF17 and CDH1to be expressed. The resultant porcine iPSC-like cells display a transcriptomic signature more closely resembling an inner cell mass state. These results represent new important steps towards generating bona fide porcine iPSCs and their great potential in translational medicine.

Abstract: Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is the predominant effect of severe traumatic brain injury and significantly contributes to cognitive deficits. The mechanisms that underlie these cognitive deficits are often associated with complex molecular alterations. α7nAChR, one of the abundant and widespread nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the brain, plays important physiological functions in the central nervous system. However, the relationship between temporospatial alterations in the α7nAChR and DAI-related learning and memory dysfunction are not completely understood. Our study detected temporospatial alterations of α7nAChR in vulnerable areas (hippocampus, internal capsule, corpus callosum and brain stem) of DAI rats and evaluated the development and progression of learning and memory dysfunction via the Morris water maze (MWM). We determined that α7nAChR expression in vulnerable areas was mainly reduced at the recovery of DAI in rats. Moreover, the escape latency of the injured group increased significantly and the percentages of the distance travelled and time spent in the target quadrant were significantly decreased after DAI. Furthermore, α7nAChR expression in the vulnerable area was significantly positively correlated with MWM performance after DAI according to regression analysis. In addition, we determined that a selective α7nAChR agonist significantly improved learning and memory dysfunction. Rats in the α7nAChR agonist group showed better learning and memory performance than those in the antagonist group. These results demonstrate that microstructural injury-induced alterations of α7nAChR in the vulnerable area are significantly correlated with learning and memory dysfunctions after DAI and that augmentation of the α7nAChR level by its agonist contributes to the improvement of learning and memory function.

Abstract: Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins are intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) commonly found in anhydrobiotic organisms and are frequently correlated with desiccation tolerance. Herein we report new findings on AfrLEA6, a novel group 6 LEA protein from embryos of Artemia franciscana. Assessment of secondary structure in aqueous and dried states with circular dichroism (CD) reveals 89% random coil in the aqueous state, thus supporting classification of AfrLEA6 as an IDP. Removal of water from the protein by drying or exposure to trifluoroethanol (a chemical de-solvating agent) promotes a large gain in secondary structure of AfrLEA6, predominated by α-helix and exhibiting minimal β-sheet structure. We evaluated the impact of physiological concentrations (up to 400 mM) of the disaccharide trehalose on the folding of LEA proteins in solution. CD spectra for AfrLEA2, AfrLEA3m, and AfrLEA6 are unaffected by this organic solute noted for its ability to drive protein folding. AfrLEA6 exhibits its highest concentration in vivo during embryonic diapause, drops acutely at diapause termination, and then declines during development to undetectable values at the larval stage. Maximum cellular titer of AfrLEA6 was 10-fold lower than for AfrLEA2 or AfrLEA3, both group 3 LEA proteins. Acute termination of diapause with H2O2 (a far more effective terminator than desiccation in this Great Salt Lake, UT, population) fostered a rapid 38% decrease in AfrLEA6 content of embryos. While the ultimate mechanism of diapause termination is unknown, disruption of key macromolecules could initiate physiological signaling events necessary for resumption of development and metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Potent and broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) are the hallmark of HIV-1 protection by vaccination. The membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of the HIV-1 gp41 fusion protein is targeted by the most broadly reactive HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies. Here, we examine the structural and molecular mechansims of neutralization by anti-MPER bnAb, LN01, which was isolated from lymph-node-derived germinal center B cells of an elite controller and exhibits broad neutralization breadth. LN01 engages both MPER and the transmembrane (TM) region, which together form a continuous helix in complex with LN01. The tilted TM orientation allows LN01 to interact simultaneously with the peptidic component of the MPER epitope and membrane via two specific lipid binding sites of the antibody paratope. Although LN01 carries a high load of somatic mutations, most key residues interacting with the MPER epitope and lipids are germline encoded, lending support for the LN01 epitope as a candidate for lineage-based vaccine development.

Abstract: Summary
Iron overload disorders are characterized by the body's inability to regulate iron absorption and its storage which can lead to organ failures. Accumulated evidence has revealed that hepcidin, the master regulator of iron homeostasis, is negatively modulated by TMPRSS6 (matriptase-2), a liver-specific type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP). Here, we report that treatment with a peptidomimetic inhibitor affecting TMPRSS6 activity increases hepcidin production in hepatic cells. Moreover, similar effects were observed when using non-peptidic inhibitors obtained through optimization of hits from high-throughput screening. Using HepG2 cells and human primary hepatocytes, we show that TMPRSS6 inhibitors block TMPRSS6-dependent hemojuvelin cleavage and increase HAMP expression and levels of secreted hepcidin.

Abstract: Our hypothesis is that hyaluronic acid may regulate the differentiation of human amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs) into insulin-producing cells and help the treatment of type 1 diabetes. Herein, a protocol for the stepwise in vitro differentiation of hAECs into functional insulin-producing cells was developed by mimicking the process of pancreas development. Treatment of hAECs with hyaluronic acid enhanced their differentiation of definitive endoderm and pancreatic progenitors. Endodermal markers Sox17 and Foxa2 and pancreatic progenitor markers Pax6, Nkx6.1, and Ngn3 were upregulated an enhanced gene expression in hAECs, but hAECs did not express the β cell-specific transcription factor Pdx1. Interestingly, hyaluronic acid promoted the expression of major pancreatic development-related genes and proteins after combining with commonly used inducers of stem cells differentiation into insulin-producing cells. This indicated the potent synergistic effects of the combination on hAECs differentiation in vitro. By establishing a multiple injection transplantation strategy via tail vein injections, hAECs transplantation significantly reduced hyperglycemia symptoms, increased the plasma insulin content, and partially repaired the islet structure in type 1 diabetic mice. In particular, the combination of hAECs with hyaluronic acid exhibited a remarkable therapeutic effect compared to both the insulin group and the hAECs alone group. The hAECs’ paracrine action and hyaluronic acid co-regulated the local immune response, improved the inflammatory microenvironment in the damaged pancreas of type 1 diabetic mice, and promoted the trans-differentiation of pancreatic α cells into β cells. These findings suggest that hyaluronic acid is an efficient co-inducer of the differentiation of hAECs into functional insulin-producing cells, and hAECs treatment with hyaluronic acid may be a promising cell-replacement therapeutic approach for the treatment of type 1 diabetes.

Abstract: Inflammasomes are cytoplasmic protein complexes that regulate the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β and IL18, thereby playing a crucial role in inflammatory and chronic diseases. Plant compound Withaferin A (WFA) has been demonstrated to possess numerous biological activities including anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects. However, the effect of WFA on macrophage polarization and inflammasome expression in polarized macrophages has not been documented. In this study, cultured THP-1 macrophages were polarized into M1/M2 phenotypes. Subsequently, macrophage characterization was tested for M1 markers (CXCL10 and CXCL9) and M2 markers (CCL20 and CCL13). NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) and Absent in melanoma (AIM2) inflammasome gene and protein expressions were measured by RTqPCR and Western blot respectively. Colocalization of both proteins in polarized macrophages was analyzed by immunofluorescence. Our results show that M1 polarized macrophages express elevated NLRP3 and AIM2 gene expressions. Furthermore, WFA treatment stimulated AIM2 and caspase-1 protein expression in M2W macrophages in comparison to M2 cells. ELISA analysis of the cell culture supernatant showed that WFA treatment of M2 macrophages inhibited the secretion of TGF-β in comparison to M1. Immunofluorescence studies showed NLRP3/ASC colocalized in the cytoplasm in M1 macrophages, which was not the case in M2 and M2W cells. AIM2/ASC were found colocalized in M1 and M2W cells, indicating an activation of inflammasome. These results provide basis for better understanding the effect of WFA in inflammatory diseases and some cancers by modulating macrophage polarization and inflammasome activation.

Abstract: Summary
The transcription factor NRF2 confers cellular protection by maintaining cellular redox homeostasis and proteostasis. Basal NRF2 levels are normally low due to KEAP1-mediated ubiquitylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation. KEAP1, a substrate adaptor protein of a KEAP1-CUL3-RBX1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, contains a critical cysteine (C151) that is modified by electrophiles or oxidants, resulting in inactivation of the E3 ligase and inhibition of NRF2 degradation. Currently, nearly all NRF2 inducers are electrophilic molecules that possess unwanted off-target effects due to their reactive nature. Here, we report a group of NRF2 inducers, ent-kaurane diterpenoid geopyxins, with and without C151 reactive electrophilic moieties. Among 16 geopyxins, geopyxin F, a non-electrophilic NRF2 activator, showed enhanced cellular protection relative to an electrophilic NRF2 activator, geopyxin C. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed structure-activity relationship study of covalent versus non-covalent NRF2 activators, showing the promise of non-covalent NRF2 activators as potential therapeutic compounds.

Abstract: Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a subpopulation of chemoresistant cells that play a critical role in disease recurrence following chemotherapy. It has been reported that microRNA-133b (miR-133b) acts as a tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, whether miR-133b is associated with CRC stemness and chemoresistance is not clear. In this study, we report that miR-133b is downregulated in colorectal spheroids, which are enriched with CSCs and display stem cell-like characteristics, including upreulation of CSCs surface markers and elevated chemoresistance. Additionally, miR-133b overexpression reduces CRC stemness and overrides chemoresistance to 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and oxaliplatin (OXP), indicating a negative role of miR-133b in regulating CRC stemness and chemoresistance. Moreover, miR-133b directly targets and suppresses the expression of disruptor of telomeric silencing 1-like (DOT1L), an exclusive H3K79 methyltransferase. Furthermore, miR-133b overexpression suppresses DOT1L-mediated H3K79me2 modification of stem cell genes, which is consistent with their downregulated transcription. More importantly, DOT1L restoration abrogates the suppressive effects of miR-133b on CRC stemness and chemoresistance, hence demonstrating that miR-133b regulates CRC stemness and chemoresistance through targeting DOT1L. Overall, these results imply that miR-133b might represent a novel therapeutic target in interfering CRC stemness and chemoresistance.

Abstract: Summary
Subversion of transcription factor (TF) activity in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) leads to the development of therapy-resistant leukemic stem cells (LSCs) that drive fulminant acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Using a conditional mouse model where zinc-finger TF Gata2 was deleted specifically in hematopoietic cells, we show that knockout of Gata2 leads to rapid and complete cell-autonomous loss of adult hematopoietic stem cells. By using short hairpin RNAi to target GATA2, we also identify a requirement for GATA2 in human HSPCs. In Meis1a/Hoxa9-driven AML, deletion of Gata2 impedes maintenance and self-renewal of LSCs. Ablation of Gata2 enforces an LSC-specific program of enhanced apoptosis, exemplified by attenuation of anti-apoptotic factor BCL2, and re-instigation of myeloid differentiation––which is characteristically blocked in AML. Thus, GATA2 acts as a critical regulator of normal and leukemic stem cells and mediates transcriptional networks that may be exploited therapeutically to target key facets of LSC behavior in AML.

Abstract: Summary
Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are used to study organogenesis and model disease as well as being developed for regenerative medicine. Endothelial cells are among the many cell types differentiated from hiPSCs, but their maturation and stabilization fall short of that in adult endothelium. We examined whether shear stress alone or in combination with pericyte co-culture would induce flow alignment and maturation of hiPSC-derived endothelial cells (hiPSC-ECs) but found no effects comparable with those in primary microvascular ECs. In addition, hiPSC-ECs lacked a luminal glycocalyx, critical for vasculature homeostasis, shear stress sensing, and signaling. We noted, however, that hiPSC-ECs have dysfunctional mitochondrial permeability transition pores, resulting in reduced mitochondrial function and increased reactive oxygen species. Closure of these pores by cyclosporine A improved EC mitochondrial function but also restored the glycocalyx such that alignment to flow took place. These results indicated that mitochondrial maturation is required for proper hiPSC-EC functionality.

Abstract: Summary
14-3-3 protein family members facilitate the translocation of RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) to organelles that mediate downstream RLR signaling, leading to interferon production. 14-3-3ϵ promotes the cytosolic-to-mitochondrial translocation of RIG-I, while 14-3-3η facilitates MDA5 translocation to mitochondria. We show that the NS3 protein of Zika virus (ZIKV) antagonizes antiviral gene induction by RIG-I and MDA5 by binding to and sequestering the scaffold proteins 14-3-3ϵ and 14-3-3η. 14-3-3-binding is mediated by a negatively charged RLDP motif in NS3 that is conserved in ZIKV strains of African and Asian lineages and is similar to the one found in dengue and West Nile viruses. ZIKV NS3 is sufficient to inhibit the RLR-14-3-3ϵ/η interaction and to suppress antiviral signaling. Mutational perturbation of 14-3-3ϵ/η binding in a recombinant ZIKV leads to enhanced innate immune responses and impaired growth kinetics. Our study provides molecular understanding of immune evasion functions of ZIKV, which may guide vaccine and anti-flaviviral therapy development.

Abstract: Elevated free fatty acids, particularly saturated ones such as palmitic acid, may play an important role in the lipotoxic mechanism of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Saturated fatty acids induce autophagy dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress leading to apoptosis in hepatocytes. However, unsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic acid, are nontoxic and can even prevent saturated fatty acid-induced toxicity in vitro. Although emerging evidence has suggested that ER calcium flux disruption in hepatocytes is involved in NAFLD pathogenesis, the roles of fatty acids in autophagy and ER calcium flux still remain unclear. We demonstrated that oleic acid ameliorated palmitic acid-induced autophagy arrest and ER stress in parallel with ER calcium depletion in hepatocytes. Moreover, we found that the effect of oleic acid against autophagy arrest was reversed by the pharmacological inhibition of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+–ATPase (SERCA), which influxes calcium to ER. These data suggest that SERCA-mediated ER calcium flux is greatly involved in fatty acid-induced lipotoxicity in hepatocytes, and the prevention of ER calcium depletion may restore saturated fatty acid-induced autophagy arrest in hepatocytes.

Abstract: Keloid is a dermal tumor with high recurrence rate. The immune system plays a critical role in preventing pathogen infiltration, inducing inflammation, initiating downstream processes, and recruiting fibrocytes in keloids. Interestingly, we observed a local, but not systemic, enrichment of Treg cells and Treg-associated gene expression at the keloid lesions compared to non-keloid tissues. Concurrently, keloid tissues presented significantly elevated expression of type I and type III collagen. Moreover, the level of collagen III and the collagen III-to-collagen I ratio were positively correlated with the level of FOXP3. To investigate whether Treg cells could directly promote the expression of collagen, fibrocytes were cocultured with autologous Treg cells. Activated Treg cells, but not quiescent Treg cells, were capable of promoting collagen expression. This response was more pronounced in keloid patients than in non-keloid controls, and required the secretion of TGF-β. Overall, these findings demonstrated a connection between collagen overexpression and imbalance and Treg dysregulation in keloid tissues.

Abstract: Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have great potential for the repair of damaged articular cartilage. We developed a serum-free 14-day protocol for hESC differentiation into chondrocyte progenitors, which surprisingly lacked strong cartilage matrix production in in vitro tests. In order to direct these progenitors to a more mature phenotype, we investigated substituting different members of the TGFβ family in the protocol. Initially, we supplemented, or substituted GDF5 (day 11–14), with combinations of BMP7 and TGFβ-1, or −3, but these modifications yielded no improvement in matrix gene expression. However, replacing BMP4 with BMP2 (days 3–10 of the protocol) resulted in a more rapid increase in SOX9 gene expression and increased expression of chondrogenic genes SOX5, ACAN and COL2A1. The replacement of BMP4 with BMP2 also enhanced the formation of chondrogenic cell aggregates, with greater deposition of type II collagen. This change was not accompanied by hypertrophic chondrocyte marker COL10A1 expression. The results demonstrate that BMP2 has greater specificity for the generation of chondrogenic cells from hESCs than BMP4 and this was consistent in two hESC lines (HUES1 and MAN7). hESC-chondrogenic cells derived with either BMP2 or BMP4 were tested in vivo by implanting them in fibrin into osteochondral defects in the femur of RNU rats. Repaired cartilage tissue, positive for Safranin O and type II collagen was detected at 6 and 12 weeks with both cell sources, but the BMP2 cells scored higher for tissue quality (Pineda score). Therefore, BMP2 is more effective at driving chondrogenic differentiation from human pluripotent stem cells than BMP4 and the effect on the resulting chondroprogenitors is sustained in an in vivo setting.

Abstract: Summary
The rapid emergence of extensively drug-resistant A. baumannii has posed a major threat to global public health, emphasizing the desperate need for novel therapeutic strategies. We report the development of a highly efficient genome-engineering platform in A. baumannii by coupling a Cas9 nuclease-mediated genome cleavage system with the RecAb recombination system. We applied the CRISPR-Cas9/RecAb system to dissect the oxidative stress-sensing mechanism of OxyR by performing alanine scanning mutagenesis of 13 residues residing in the H2O2-sensing pocket, pinpointing new vital factors for H2O2 sensing. Moreover, we developed a cytidine base-editing system, enabling programmed C to T conversions. Exploiting this powerful technique, we systematically investigated the drug-resistant mechanisms in a clinically isolated multidrug-resistant A. baumannii strain by generating premature stop codons in the possible resistance genes, unveiling distinct roles of these genes in drug resistance. The development of these genome-engineering methods will facilitate new therapeutic-means development in A. baumannii and related organisms.

Abstract: Summary
RNA associates extensively with chromatin and can influence its structure; however, the potential role of the negative charges of RNA on chromatin structure remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that RNA prevents precipitation of histones and can attenuate electrostatic interactions between histones and DNA, thereby loosening up the chromatin structure. This effect is independent of the sequence of RNA but dependent on its single-stranded nature, length, concentration, and negative charge. Opening and closure of chromatin by RNA occurs rapidly (within minutes) and passively (in permeabilized cells), in agreement with electrostatics. Accordingly, chromatin compaction following removal of RNA can be prevented by high ionic strength or neutralization of the positively charged histone tails by hyperacetylation. Finally, LINE1 repeat RNAs bind histone H2B and can decondense chromatin. We propose that RNA regulates chromatin opening and closure by neutralizing the positively charged tails of histones, reducing their electrostatic interactions with DNA.

Abstract: Brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) deficiency in Schwann cells plays an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Little is known about the mechanism involved in BDNF downregulation in Schwann cells in DPN. In this study, we first confirmed downregulation of BDNF and neurotrophin 3 expression in the sciatic nerves of diabetic mice, which was accompanied by myelin sheath abnormalities. Moreover, in vitro, high glucose was revealed to cause downregulation of BDNF, but not neurotrophin 3, expression in RSC96 cells, which was accompanied by DNA hypermethylation of BDNF promoters I and II. DNMT1 was subsequently revealed to be enhanced at the mRNA and protein levels in high glucose-stimulated RSC96 cells, and inhibition of DNMT1 with 5-Aza treatment or shRNA vector transfection reversed high glucose-induced reductions in BDNF expression. Furthermore, the mTOR and upstream Akt pathways were indicated to mediate high glucose-induced DNMT1 and BDNF expression in RSC96 cells. Taken together, our results suggest that the Akt/mTOR cascade mediates high glucose-induced reductions in BDNF via DNMT1 in Schwann cells in DPN.

Abstract: Summary
Primary tauopathies are characterized neuropathologically by inclusions containing abnormal forms of the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) and clinically by diverse neuropsychiatric, cognitive, and motor impairments. Autosomal dominant mutations in the MAPT gene cause heterogeneous forms of frontotemporal lobar degeneration with tauopathy (FTLD-Tau). Common and rare variants in the MAPT gene increase the risk for sporadic FTLD-Tau, including progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD). We generated a collection of fibroblasts from 140 MAPT mutation/risk variant carriers, PSP, CBD, and cognitively normal controls; 31 induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from MAPT mutation carriers, non-carrier family members, and autopsy-confirmed PSP patients; 33 genome engineered iPSCs that were corrected or mutagenized; and forebrain neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Here, we present a resource of fibroblasts, iPSCs, and NPCs with comprehensive clinical histories that can be accessed by the scientific community for disease modeling and development of novel therapeutics for tauopathies.

Abstract: Functional decline and loss of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cause retinal diseases. Clinical studies using human embryonic stem cell (hESC)- or induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived RPE cells have shown the safety and potential efficacy of hESC/iPSC-RPE cell transplantation. However, the production of RPE cells remains somewhat problematic. hESCs/iPSCs co-cultured with mouse feeder cells carry the risk of xeno-transmitted infections and immune reactions. Moreover, increasing the rate of cell division to ensure the quantity and purity of cells with low differentiation efficiency elevates the risk of gene mutations and chromosomal abnormalities. Here, we show that the transient inhibition of the FGF/MAPK signaling pathway during the hiPSC maintenance period markedly promotes RPE differentiation efficiency under feeder-free culture conditions. Blockage of FGF/MAPK signal induces neural differentiation and generates RPE cells without subsequent inhibition of Wnt and Nodal signals, which is known to be effective for retinal specification. We also found that additional inhibition of the PKC or BMP signaling pathway together with FGF/MAPK signal inhibition further elevates RPE differentiation efficiency. Our study will be helpful for producing clinical-grade RPE cells and will facilitate the development of therapies using hESC/hiPSC-RPE cells.

Abstract: Cells grow differently in conventional 2D cell culture than when they grow in the physiological microenvironment. In this study, we developed a 3D cell culture model for generating male germ cells from human iPSCs using a human decellularized amnion membrane (DAM) scaffold. To this end, human iPSCs were generated using retroviral vectors and characterized for pluripotency properties by immunofluorescence assay, flow cytometry, ALP staining, cytogenetic assay, and differentiation capacity. The iPSCs were used for investigating male germ cells differentiation efficiency in both conventional 2D culture and 3D-DAM scaffold. The expression of male germ cell markers was evaluated at day 21 of differentiation using immunofluorescence assay, flow-cytometry, and RT-qPCR. The results indicated a successful reprogramming of human foreskin fibroblast cells into pluripotent iPSCs. The reprogrammed cells were positive for pluripotency markers and differentiated into the three germ layers. During male germ cell differentiation, the cells tend to aggregate and form colony-like structures in both 2D and 3D conditions. However, significant expression of VASA, DAZL, PLZF, STELLA, and NANOS3 markers and more efficient haploid male germ cell production were observed in the 3D condition when compared to the 2D model. Considering the effect of the 3D-DAM scaffold in prompting male germ cell-specific markers and increased efficiency of germ cell differentiation in 3D culture, it appears that DAM scaffold is a useful tool for in vitro studies of human germ cell development and ultimately future clinical application.

Abstract: Hypoxic blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction is a common feature of CNS diseases however mechanisms underlying barrier disturbance are still largely unknown. This study investigated the role of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ), a cytokine known to induce expression of the proprotein convertase Furin, in hypoxia-mediated barrier compromise. We show that exposure of brain endothelial cells (ECs) to hypoxia (1% O2) rapidly stimulates their migration. Additional exogenous TGFβ (0.4 nM) exposure potentiated this effect and increased Furin expression in a TGFβ type I receptor activin-like kinase 5 (ALK5) - dependent manner (prevented by 10 μM SB431542). Furin inhibition prevented hypoxia-induced EC migration and blocked TGFβ-induced potentiation suggesting existence of a feedback loop. TGFβ and Furin were also critical for hypoxia-induced BBB dysfunction. TGFβ treatment aggravated hypoxia-induced BBB permeability but ALK5 or Furin blockade reversed injury-induced permeability changes. Thus during insult Furin compromises endothelial integrity by mediating the effects of TGFβ. Targeting the Furin or ALK5 pathway may offer novel therapeutic strategies for improving BBB stability and CNS function during disease.

Role of integrin-linked kinase in the hypoxia-induced phenotypic transition of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells: Implications for hypoxic pulmonary hypertension,

Abstract: The phenotypic transition of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) from a contractile/differentiated to synthetic/de-differentiated phenotype is an important mechanism for the occurrence and development of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (HPH). Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is an early hypoxic response factor whose kinase activity is significantly affected during early hypoxia. Myocardin and ETS-like protein 1 (Elk-1) are co-activators of serum response factor (SRF) and can bind to SRF to mediate the phenotypic transition of PASMCs. However, little is known about the role of ILK on the phenotypic transition of these PASMCs. Thus, in our study, we explored the role of ILK in this process. We found that the expression of ILK and myocardin decreased gradually with the increase in hypoxia exposure time in the pulmonary arteries of rats. We observed that hypoxia exposure for 1 h caused an increase in the phosphorylation of Elk-1 but did not affect the expression of ILK, myocardin, or SRF. Exposure to hypoxic treatment for 1 h decreased ILK kinase activity and caused Elk-1 to suppress myocardin binding to SRF and the smooth muscle (SM) α-actin gene promoters. In addition, hypoxia exposure for 24 h decreased the expression of ILK, myocardin, SM α-actin, and calponin but increased the expression of osteopontin. Silencing of the myocardin gene significantly decreased the expression of SM α-actin and calponin but increased the expression of osteopontin. Silencing of the ILK gene significantly decreased the expression of myocardin, SM α-actin, and calponin but increased the expression of osteopontin. ILK overexpression reversed the effects of 24 h of hypoxia on the expression of myocardin, SM α-actin, calponin, and osteopontin and reversed the decrease in binding of myocardin to the SM α-actin promoter caused by 24 h of hypoxia exposure. Thus, our results suggest that ILK initiates the phenotypic transition of PASMCs. The underlying mechanism may involve hypoxia downregulating ILK kinase activity and protein expression, causing Elk-1 to compete with myocardin for binding to the SM α-actin promoter, which downregulates the expression of the downstream target myocardin and results in the phenotypic transition of PASMCs from a contractile to a synthetic phenotype. This may be an important mechanism in the development of HPH.

Edaravone, a free radical scavenger, protects against ferroptotic cell death in vitro,

Abstract: Ferroptosis is characterized by an iron-dependent cell death with increased lipid peroxidation and is typically induced by either a decrease in glutathione (GSH) levels due to an insufficient supply of cysteine (Cys) or the inhibition of phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (Gpx4). While lipid peroxides are the direct trigger for ferroptosis, the issue of how radical species involve in the cytocidal process remains unclear. To gain insights into this issue, we employed edaravone, a free radical scavenger that is clinically approved for the treatment of acute ischemic strokes and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), against ferroptotic cell death caused by various situations, notably under cystine deprivation. We initially investigated the effects of edaravone on ferroptosis in mouse hepatoma Hepa 1–6 cells cultivated in cystine-free medium and found that edaravone largely suppressed ferroptosis. Ferroptosis that was induced in the cells by the use of inhibitors for xCT or Gpx4 was also suppressed by edaravone. Moreover, edaravone also suppressed ferroptosis in xCT-knockout mouse-derived embryonic fibroblasts, which usually die in normal cultivating conditions due to the depletion of intracellular Cys and GSH. Although the edaravone treatment had no effects on the intracellular levels of Cys and GSH, both of which remained low in Hepa 1–6 cells under conditions of cystine deprivation, the causative factors for ferroptosis, including ferrous iron and lipid peroxide levels, were significantly suppressed. Collectively, these results indicate that radical species produced at the initial stage of the cytocidal process under Cys-deprived conditions trigger ferroptosis and scavenging these radicals by edaravone represents a promising treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Parasitic protists belonging to the genus Leishmania synthesize the non-canonical carbohydrate reserve, mannogen, which is composed of β-1,2-mannan oligosaccharides. Here, we identify a class of dual-activity mannosyltransferase/phosphorylases (MTPs) that catalyze both the sugar nucleotide-dependent biosynthesis and phosphorolytic turnover of mannogen. Structural and phylogenic analysis shows that while the MTPs are structurally related to bacterial mannan phosphorylases, they constitute a distinct family of glycosyltransferases (GT108) that have likely been acquired by horizontal gene transfer from gram-positive bacteria. The seven MTPs catalyze the constitutive synthesis and turnover of mannogen. This metabolic rheostat protects obligate intracellular parasite stages from nutrient excess, and is essential for thermotolerance and parasite infectivity in the mammalian host. Our results suggest that the acquisition and expansion of the MTP family in Leishmania increased the metabolic flexibility of these protists and contributed to their capacity to colonize new host niches.

Abstract: Human hepatocarcinogenesis is a complex process with many unresolved issues, including the cell of origin (differentiated and/or progenitor/stem cells) and the initial steps leading to tumor development. With the aim of providing new tools for studying hepatocellular carcinoma initiation and progression, we developed an innovative model based on primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) lentivirus-transduced with SV40LT+ST, HRASV12 with or without hTERT. The differentiation status of these transduced-PHHs was characterized by RNA sequencing (including lncRNAs), and the expression of some differentiation markers confirmed by RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence. In addition, their transformation capacity was assessed by colony formation in soft agar and tumorigenicity evaluated in immune-deficient mice. The co-expression of SV40LT+ST and HRASV12 in PHHs, in association or not with hTERT, led to the emergence of transformed clones. These clones exhibited a poorly differentiated cell phenotype with expression of stemness and mesenchymal-epithelial transition markers and gave rise to cancer stem cell subpopulations. In vivo, they resulted in poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas with a reactivation of endogenous hTERT. These experiments demonstrate for the first time that non-cycling human mature hepatocytes can be permissive to in vitro transformation. This cellular tool provides the first comprehensive in vitro model for identifying genetic/epigenetic changes driving human hepatocarcinogenesis.

Abstract: Previous studies demonstrated that variants in dipeptidyl aminopeptidase-like protein-6 (DPP6) are involved in idiopathic ventricular fibrillation. However, its role in early repolarization syndrome (ERS) remains largely elusive. The aim of this study is to determine whether the novel DPP6-L747P variant is associated with ERS, and explore the underlying mechanisms. In our study, whole genome sequencing was used to identify a genetic variant in 4 Chinese families with sudden cardiac arrest induced by ERS. Then, wild-type (WT) DPP6 or mutant (c.2240T > C/p.L747P) DPP6 were respectively expressed in HEK293 cells, co-expressed with KV4.3 and KChIP2. Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and whole-cell patch clamp experiments were performed to reveal possible underlying mechanisms. A novel missense variant (c.2240T > C/p.L747P) in DPP6 was identified in the 4 families. Both DPP6-WT and DPP6-L747P were mainly located on the cell membrane. Compared with DPP6-WT, the intensity of DPP6 protein bands was downregulated in DPP6-L747P. Functional experiments showed that macroscopic currents exhibited an increase in DPP6-L747P, and the current intensity of DPP6-L747P was increased more than that of DPP6-WT (63.1 ± 8.2 pA/pF vs.86.5 ± 15.1 pA/pF at +50 mV, P < 0.05). Compared with DPP6-WT, the slope of the activation curve of DPP6-L747P was slightly decreased (15.49 ± 0.56 mV vs. 13.88 ± 0.54 mV, P < 0.05), the slope of the inactivation curve was increased (13.65 ± 1.57 mV, vs. 24.44 ± 2.79 mV, P < 0.05) and the recovery time constant was significantly reduced (216.81 ± 18.59 ms vs. 102.11 ± 32.03 ms, P < 0.05). In conclusion, we identified a novel missense variant (c.2240T > C/p. L747P) in DPP6 in 4 Chinese families with sudden cardiac arrest induced by ERS. Patch clamp experiments revealed that this variant could generate a gain of function of Ito and affect the potassium current. These results demonstrated that changes caused by the variant may be the underlying mechanisms of malignant arrhythmias in the individuals with ERS.

Abstract: Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide new approaches for the management of severe skin wound healing due to their infinite proliferative capacity, pluripotency into multiple lineages, and important ethical acceptability. In this study, we aimed to differentiate iPSCs into keratinocytes and to observe the therapeutic effects of transplanted iPSCs-derived keratinocytes on wound healing in mice. Here, mouse iPSCs had been successfully differentiated into keratinocytes. Next, iPSCs-derived keratinocytes labeled by CSFE were injected directly into the full-thickness skin wound. Hematoxylin & Eosin, Masson's trichrome, EdU staining and immunohistochemical staining were performed to assess the effects of iPSCs-derived keratinocytes on wound healing. Our results showed that transplantation of iPSCs-derived keratinocytes into full-thickness skin wound site accelerated re-epithelialization and reduced scar formation. In addition, we found that conditioned medium of iPSCs-derived keratinocytes reduced the expression of α-SMA and COL1 and increased the expression of MMP1 in fibroblasts in vitro. Further mechanism studies show the TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB is involved in the effect of conditioned medium of iPSCs-derived keratinocytes on fibroblasts. In conclusion, this study has shown that iPSCs-derived keratinocytes decrease the healing time by increasing the epithelization rate and reduce scarring, suggesting a possible new treatment for skin wound healing.

Abstract: Background
Breast cancers characterized by HER2 overexpression, belong to HER-2 enriched or luminal B subtypes, are frequently associated with higher incidence of tumor recurrence and therapeutic failure. These aggressive features have been attributed to the presence of cancer stem-like cell subpopulations known to have high tumor initiation, self -renewal capacities and high metastatic potential. Depleting these stem-like cells in these tumors therefore might help in improving therapeutic response and patient outcome.
Methods
Here we used human breast cancer cells representative of HER2- enriched and luminal B subtypes as well as purified ALDH-positive stem-like cell subpopulation for in vitro cell viability, proliferation, tumorshpere formation analyses and gene expression studies. In addition, we used a pre-clinical xenograft HER2 mouse model (NOD/SCID mice) for in vivo tumorigenesis assessment. Furthermore, patient survival outcomes were evaluated using in silico bioinformatics analyses of publicly available datasets.
Results
Our results indicate that prolactin (PRL) exerts anti-tumorigenic effects in HER-2 positive breast cancer cells. Importantly, PRL caused a significant reduction in ALDHhi stem-like subpopulation, as well as their viability and tumorsphere formation capacity. Molecularly we found PRL to suppress gene expression of markers involved in stemness, tumor initiation, drug resistance and poor patient outcome found to be enriched in the ALDHhi stem-like subpopulation. Furthermore, we show PRL to impede tumor growth of HER-2 xenografts and to suppress expression of Ki67 proliferative marker. Finally, we found PRL pathway gene signature to correlate with favorable patient outcomes in HER-2 and luminal B breast cancer patients.
Conclusion
Together these results emphasize an anti-tumorigenic role with a potential therapeutic value for PRL in HER-2 and luminal B breast cancer subtypes targeting the cancer stem-like cells.

Abstract: Preferential neuronal vulnerability is characteristic of several neurodegenerative diseases including the motor neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It is well established that glia play a critical role in ALS, but it is unknown whether regional differences in the ability of glia to support motor neurons contribute to the specific pattern of neuronal degeneration. In this study, using primary mixed glial cultures from different mouse CNS regions (spinal cord and cortex), we examined whether regional differences exist in key glial pathways that contribute to, or protect against, motor neuron degeneration. Specifically, we examined the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory pathway and the cytoprotective heat shock response (HSR). Glial cultures were treated with pro-inflammatory stimuli, tumour necrosis factor-ɑ/lipopolysaccharide or heat stressed to stimulate the inflammatory and HSR respectively. We found that spinal cord glia expressed more iNOS and produced more NO compared to cortical glia in response to inflammatory stimuli. Intriguingly, we found that expression of ALS-causing SOD1G93A did not elevate the levels of NO in spinal cord glia. However, activation of the stress-responsive HSR was attenuated in SOD1G93A cultures, with a reduced Hsp70 induction in response to stressful stimuli. Exposure of spinal cord glia to heat shock in combination with inflammatory stimuli reduced the activation of the inflammatory response. The results of this study suggest that impaired heat shock response in SOD1G93A glia may contribute to the exacerbated inflammatory reactions observed in ALS mice. Graphical abstractMixed primary glial cultures were established from cortical and spinal cord regions of wild-type mice and mice expressing ALS–causing mutant human SOD1 and the inflammatory and heat shock responses were investigated in these cultures. In the absence of stress, all cultures appeared to have similar cellular composition, levels of inflammatory mediators and similar expression level of heat shock proteins. When stimulated, spinal cord glia were more reactive and activated the inflammatory pathway more readily than cortical glia; this response was similar in wild-type and SOD1G93A glial cultures. Although the heat shock response was similar in spinal cord and cortical glial, in SOD1G93A expressing glia from both the spinal cord and cortex, the induction of heat shock response was diminished. This impaired heat shock response in SOD1G93A glia may therefore contribute to the exacerbated inflammatory reactions observed in ALS mice.Graphical abstract

Abstract: Summary
Aminoglycoside antibiotics require proton motive force (PMF) for bacterial internalization. In non-respiring populations, PMF drops below the level required for drug influx, limiting the utility of aminoglycosides against strict and facultative anaerobes. We recently demonstrated that rhamnolipids (RLs), biosurfactant molecules produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, potentiate aminoglycoside activity against Staphylococcus aureus. Here, we demonstrate that RLs induce PMF-independent aminoglycoside uptake to restore sensitivity to otherwise tolerant persister, biofilm, small colony variant, and anaerobic populations of S. aureus. Furthermore, we show that this approach represses the rise of resistance, restores sensitivity to highly resistant clinical isolates, and is effective against other Gram-positive pathogens. Finally, while other membrane-acting agents can synergize with aminoglycosides, induction of PMF-independent uptake is uncommon, and distinct to RLs among several compounds tested. In all, small-molecule induction of PMF-independent aminoglycoside uptake circumvents phenotypic tolerance, overcomes genotypic resistance, and expands the utility of aminoglycosides against intrinsically recalcitrant bacterial populations.

Abstract: Summary
Reduction of caloric intake delays and prevents age-associated diseases and extends the life span in many organisms. It may be that these benefits are due to positive effects of caloric restriction on stem cell function. We use the planarian model Schmidtea mediterranea, an immortal animal that adapts to long periods of starvation by shrinking in size, to investigate the effects of starvation on telomere length. We show that the longest telomeres are a general signature of planarian adult stem cells. We also observe that starvation leads to an enrichment of stem cells with the longest telomeres and that this enrichment is dependent on mTOR signaling. We propose that one important effect of starvation for the rejuvenation of the adult stem cell pool is through increasing the median telomere length in somatic stem cells. Such a mechanism has broad implications for how dietary effects on aging are mediated at the whole-organism level.

Abstract: Summary
The synovial joint forms from a pool of progenitor cells in the future region of the joint, the interzone. Expression of Gdf5 and Wnt9a has been used to mark the earliest cellular processes in the formation of the interzone and the progenitor cells. However, lineage specification and progression toward the different tissues of the joint are not well understood. Here, by lineage-tracing studies we identify a population of Lgr5+ interzone cells that contribute to the formation of cruciate ligaments, synovial membrane, and articular chondrocytes of the joint. This finding is supported by single-cell transcriptome analyses. We show that Col22a1, a marker of early articular chondrocytes, is co-expressed with Lgr5+ cells prior to cavitation as an important lineage marker specifying the progression toward articular chondrocytes. Lgr5+ cells contribute to the repair of a joint defect with the re-establishment of a Col22a1-expressing superficial layer.

Abstract: Gemcitabine (GEM)-based chemotherapy is commonly used to treat pancreatic cancer. However, acquired resistance to GEM remains a challenge in pancreatic cancer patients. Here we tested whether cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play vital roles in regulating drug resistance by transferring exosomal miRNA to cancer cells. CAFs were isolated from primary fibroblast of pancreatic cancer patients, and exosomes were collected and identified through transmission electron microscopy and western blotting analysis. The functions of CAFs-derived exosomal miRNA in regulating drug resistance were further investigated. We found that CAFs were innately resistant to GEM. The conditioned medium (CM) and the exosomes derived from CAFs contributed to GEM resistance, and GEM treatment further enhanced the effect of CAFs or CAFs-exosomes on pancreatic cancer cells proliferation. MiR-106b level was upregulated in CAFs and CAFs-exosomes following GEM treatment. MiR-106b was directly transferred from CAFs to pancreatic cancer cells through exosomes. Pretreatment of CAFs with miR-106b inhibitor suppressed miR-106b expression in CAFs-exosomes and resulted in a decreased resistance of cancer cells to GEM. MiR-106b promoted GEM resistance of cancer cells by directly targeting TP53INP1. Summarily, our data demonstrated that CAFs-derived exosomal miR-106b plays a vital role in causing GEM resistance of pancreatic cancer, thus offering a new target for sensitizing pancreatic cancer cells to GEM.

Abstract: In higher eukaryotic cells, pertubations in ER environment, called ER stress, usually activate unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway in an attempt to re-stablish the ER homeostasis and prevent cell death. Because trypanosomatids appear to lack the classical UPR, it is not clear how these parasites respond to ER stress. Thus, the aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of ER stressors tunicamycin (TM) or dithiothreitol (DTT) on Trypanosoma cruzi. The TM treatment showed strong trypanostatic effect. At 2.5 μg/mL of TM, the mRNA levels of both binding protein (BiP) and calreticulin (CRT) increased significantly, whereas the protein levels of BiP remained stable. TM treatment induced ultrastructural changes compatible with an autophagic process. The DTT treatment inhibited the cell growth, induced drastic morphological changes, mitochondrial membrane depolarization and increased ROS production. The expression of BiP apparently was not affected by DTT, whereas the mRNA levels of BiP and CRT were significantly reduced. Our results suggest that TM induces autophagy/ER-phagy without causing substantial injury to the parasite. Conversely, the DTT treatment seems to rupture the mitochondrion homeostasis leading to parasite death. The comprehension of the mechanisms behind the susceptibility of T. cruzi to ER stress open perspectives for the development of chemotherapeutic agents addressed to these pathways.

Abstract: Patients with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) represent a substantial challenge to medical practitioners due to the high associated rates of morbidity and mortality and a lack of satisfactory therapeutic outcomes. In a previous study, our group demonstrated that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) can ameliorate SAP; however, the mechanisms of action remain to be fully understood. BMSCs were intravenously injected into SAP rats 12 h after experimental induction of SAP using sodium taurocholate (NaT). Histopathological changes and the levels of pro-inflammatory mediators were assessed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and ELISA, respectively. Autophagy levels were assessed using qRT-PCR, western blotting, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and transmission electron microscopy. AR42J cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were administered BMSC-conditioned media (BMSC-CM) after NaT treatment, and cell viability was measured using a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and flow cytometry. In vivo, BMSCs effectively reduced multiple systematic inflammatory responses, suppressed the activation of autophagy, and improved intestinal dysfunction. In vitro, BMSC-CM significantly improved the viability of injured cells, promoted angiogenesis, and decreased autophagy. We therefore propose that the administration of BMSCs alleviates SAP-induced multiple organ injury by inhibiting autophagy.

Abstract: Previous studies have shown that oxysterol binding protein like 2 (OSBPL2) knockdown is closely related to cholesterol metabolism. However, whether there is a direct relation between OSBPL2 and cholesterol synthesis is unknown. This study explored the mechanism of OSBPL2 deficiency in the upregulation of squalene epoxidase (SQLE) and the subsequent accumulation of intracellular cholesterol and cholesteryl ester. Here, we constructed an OSBPL2-deleted HeLa cell line using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, screened differentially expressed genes and examined the transcriptional regulation of SQLE using a dual-luciferase reporter gene. RNA-seq analysis showed that SQLE was upregulated significantly and the dual luciferase reporter gene assay revealed that two new functional transcription factor binding sites of Sp1 transcription factor (SP1) and sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 2 (SREBF2) in the SQLE promoter participated in the SQLE transcription and expression. In addition, we also observed that OSBPL2 deletion inhibited the AMPK signalling pathway and that the inhibition of AMPK signalling promoted SP1 and SREBF2 entry into the nuclear to upregulate SQLE expression. Therefore, these data support that OSBPL2 deficiency upregulates SQLE expression and increases the accumulation of cholesterol and cholesteryl ester by suppressing AMPK signalling, which provides new evidence of the connection between OSBPL2 and cholesterol synthesis.

Abstract: Summary
Bacteriophages are abundant within the human gastrointestinal tract, yet their interactions with gut bacteria remain poorly understood, particularly with respect to CRISPR-Cas immunity. Here, we show that the type I-C CRISPR-Cas system in the prevalent gut Actinobacterium Eggerthella lenta is transcribed and sufficient for specific targeting of foreign and chromosomal DNA. Comparative analyses of E. lenta CRISPR-Cas systems across (meta)genomes revealed 2 distinct clades according to cas sequence similarity and spacer content. We assembled a human virome database (HuVirDB), encompassing 1,831 samples enriched for viral DNA, to identify protospacers. This revealed matches for a majority of spacers, a marked increase over other databases, and uncovered “hyper-targeted” phage sequences containing multiple protospacers targeted by several E. lenta strains. Finally, we determined the positional mismatch tolerance of observed spacer-protospacer pairs. This work emphasizes the utility of merging computational and experimental approaches for determining the function and targets of CRISPR-Cas systems.

Abstract: Preeclampsia (PE), especially severe and early-onset preeclampsia is one of the major causes of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. However, the exact mechanism is not fully understood. In this study, we first demonstrated that the expression of TWIST1 was decreased in the placental tissues of patients with early-onset severe preeclampsia, compared with non-severe early onset preeclampsia. In hypoxia-treated HTR-8/SVneo cells, our study showed that TWIST1 expression was significantly decreased. Moreover, TWIST1 overexpression reduced apoptosis and enhanced invasion and tube formation of HTR-8/SVneo cells while TWIST1 knockdown showed the opposite results. Mechanistically, TWIST1 inhibited apoptosis by blocking the activation of mitochondrial apoptosis signaling Bax/Bcl-2/Caspase-9/Caspase-3, which was confirmed by the use of Caspase-9 activator and inhibitor. This was in line with the reduced ROS formation and the decreased mitochondrial transmembrane potential. On the other hand, TWIST1 increased the ability of migration and invasion of HTR-8/SVneo cells via enhancements of MMP-2/9 expression. Taken together, for the first time we show that TWIST1 plays an important role in the survival, invasion and tube formation of-HTR8/SVneo cells treated with hypoxia. This hypoxia-treated cell model partly mimics the in vivo condition of decreased placental perfusion induced by H/R. Thus, our study provides an important clue about TWIST1 molecular mechanism underlying the development of preeclampsia.

Abstract: Summary
The mucosa is colonized with commensal Neisseria. Some of these niches are sites of infection for the STD pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Ngo). Given the antagonistic behavior of commensal bacteria toward their pathogenic relatives, we hypothesized that commensal Neisseria may negatively affect Ngo colonization. Here, we report that commensal species of Neisseria kill Ngo through a mechanism based on genetic competence and DNA methylation state. Specifically, commensal-triggered killing occurs when the pathogen takes up commensal DNA containing a methylation pattern that it does not recognize. Indeed, any DNA will kill Ngo if it can enter the cell, is differentially methylated, and has homology to the pathogen genome. Consistent with these findings, commensal Neisseria elongata accelerates Ngo clearance from the mouse in a DNA-uptake-dependent manner. Collectively, we propose that commensal Neisseria antagonizes Ngo infection through a DNA-mediated mechanism and that DNA is a potential microbicide against this highly drug-resistant pathogen.

Abstract: Summary
The HIV-1 capsid is an ordered protein shell that houses the viral genome during early infection. Its expansive surface consists of an ordered and interfacing array of capsid protein hexamers and pentamers that are recognized by numerous cellular proteins. Many of these proteins recognize specific, assembled capsid interfaces not present in unassembled capsid subunits. We used protein-engineering tools to capture diverse capsid assembly intermediates. We built a repertoire of capsid assemblies (ranging from two to 42 capsid protein molecules) that recreate the various surfaces in infectious capsids. These assemblies reveal unique capsid-targeting mechanisms for each of the anti-HIV factors, TRIMCyp, MxB, and TRIM5α, linked to inhibition of virus uncoating and nuclear entry, as well as the HIV-1 cofactor FEZ1 that facilitates virus intracellular trafficking. This capsid assembly repertoire enables elucidation of capsid recognition modes by known capsid-interacting factors, identification of new capsid-interacting factors, and potentially, development of capsid-targeting therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide a potential source for the derivation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs); however, current approaches are limited by the production of heterogeneous cell types and a paucity of tools or markers for tracking and purifying candidate SMCs. Here, we develop murine and human iPSC lines carrying fluorochrome reporters (Acta2hrGFP and ACTA2eGFP, respectively) that identify Acta2+/ACTA2+ cells as they emerge in vitro in real time during iPSC-directed differentiation. We find that Acta2hrGFP+ and ACTA2eGFP+ cells can be sorted to purity and are enriched in markers characteristic of an immature or synthetic SMC. We characterize the resulting GFP+ populations through global transcriptomic profiling and functional studies, including the capacity to form engineered cell sheets. We conclude that these reporter lines allow for generation of sortable, live iPSC-derived Acta2+/ACTA2+ cells highly enriched in smooth muscle lineages for basic developmental studies, tissue engineering, or future clinical regenerative applications.

Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) is a malignant tumor with high mortality due to lack of early diagnostic methods and effective treatments, and the molecular mechanisms are intricate and remain unclear. In the present study, the role of macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO) in tumor advancement of HCC was investigated. We examined expression level of MARCO in HCC samples, corresponding adjacent nontumor tissues and six hepatoma cell lines by polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Clinical information of HCC patients was also analyzed. The role of MARCO involved in HCC progression via multiple functional experiments in vitro and in vivo was investigated. Bioinformatics analysis was conducted to further explore biological functions of MARCO. We found MARCO was suggestively down-regulated in HCC and associated with favorable prognosis, and MARCO upregulation oppressed tumor cell migration and invasion. Besides, overexpression of MARCO not only promoted apoptosis of hepatoma cells but also suppressed proliferation in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) analysis suggested that MARCO may be related to the P53 signaling pathway, and this prediction was confirmed in this study as well. In sum, our study indicated that MARCO was involved in HCC progression and it can be defined as a novel probable biomarker as well as treatment target for HCC.

Abstract: Altered expression of miRNAs is evident in the islets of diabetic human donors, but the effects of specific aspects of the diabetic microenvironment and identity of gene ontology pathways demonstrating target gene enrichment in response to each is understudied. We assessed changes in the miRNA milieu in response to high/low glucose, hypoxia, dyslipidaemia and inflammatory factors in a humanised EndoC-βH1 beta cell culture system and performed miRPath analysis for each treatment individually. The 10 miRNAs demonstrating the greatest dysregulation across treatments were then independently validated and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis to confirm targeted pathways undertaken. 171 of 392 miRNAs displayed altered expression in response to one or more cellular stressors. miRNA changes were treatment specific, but their target genes were enriched in conserved pathways. 5 miRNAs (miR-136-5p, miR299-5p, miR-454-5p, miR-152 and miR-185) were dysregulated in response to multiple stressors and survived validation in independent samples (p = 0.008, 0.002, 0.012, 0.005 and 0.024 respectively). Target genes of dysregulated miRNAs were clustered into FOXO1, HIPPO and Lysine degradation pathways (p = 0.02, p = 5.84 × 10−5 and p = 3.00 × 10−3 respectively). We provide evidence that the diabetic microenvironment may induce changes to the expression of miRNAs targeting genes enriched in pathways involved in cell stress response and cell survival.

Abstract: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Birth Defects Study suggests that environmental exposures including maternal thyroid diseases, maternal nicotine use, and use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may exacerbate incidence and or severity of craniofacial abnormalities including craniosynostosis. Premature fusion of a suture(s) of the skull defines the birth defect craniosynostosis which occurs in 1:1800-2500 births. A proposed mechanism of craniosynostosis is the disruption of proliferation and differentiation of cells in the perisutural area. Here, we hypothesize that pharmacological exposures including excess thyroid hormone, nicotine, and SSRIs lead to an alteration of stem cells within the sutures resulting in premature fusion. In utero exposure to nicotine and citalopram (SSRI) increased the risk of premature suture fusion in a wild-type murine model. Gli1+ stem cells were reduced, stem cell populations were depleted, and homeostasis of the suture mesenchyme was altered with exposure. Thus, although these pharmacological exposures can deplete calvarial stem cell populations leading to craniosynostosis, depletion of stem cells is not a unifying mechanism for pharmacological exposure associated craniosynostosis.

Abstract: Summary
Tetherin is a host defense factor that physically prevents virion release from the plasma membrane. The Nef accessory protein of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) engages the clathrin adaptor AP-2 to downregulate tetherin via its DIWK motif. As human tetherin lacks DIWK, antagonism of tetherin by Nef is a barrier to simian-human transmission of non-human primate lentiviruses. To determine the molecular basis for tetherin counteraction, we reconstituted the AP-2 complex with a simian tetherin and SIV Nef and determined its structure by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM). Nef refolds the first α-helix of the β2 subunit of AP-2 to a β hairpin, creating a binding site for the DIWK sequence. The tetherin binding site in Nef is distinct from those of most other Nef substrates, including MHC class I, CD3, and CD4 but overlaps with the site for the restriction factor SERINC5. This structure explains the dependence of SIVs on tetherin DIWK and consequent barrier to human transmission.

Abstract: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a fatal, late-onset neurodegenerative disorder characterized by selective neuropathology in the brainstem, cerebellum, spinal cord, and substantia nigra. Here we report the first NIH-approved human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line derived from an embryo harboring the SCA3 mutation. Referred to as SCA3-hESC, this line is heterozygous for the mutant polyglutamine-encoding CAG repeat expansion in the ATXN3 gene. We observed relevant molecular hallmarks of the human disease at all differentiation stages from stem cells to cortical neurons, including robust ATXN3 aggregation and altered expression of key components of the protein quality control machinery. In addition, SCA3-hESCs exhibit nuclear accumulation of mutant ATXN3 and form p62-positive aggresomes. Finally, antisense oligonucleotide-mediated reduction of ATXN3 markedly suppressed aggresome formation. The SCA3-hESC line offers a unique and highly relevant human disease model that holds strong potential to advance understanding of SCA3 disease mechanisms and facilitate the evaluation of candidate therapies for SCA3.

Abstract: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are characterized by matrix remodeling, elastin degradation, absence of nitric oxide (NO) signaling, and inflammation, influencing smooth muscle cell (SMC) phenotype and gene expression. Little is known about the biomolecular release and intrinsic biomechanics of human AAA-SMCs. NO delivery could be an attractive therapeutic strategy to restore lost functionality of AAA-SMCs by inhibiting inflammation and cell stiffening. We aim to establish the differences in phenotype and gene expression of adult human AAA-SMCs from healthy SMCs. Based on our previous study which showed benefits of optimal NO dosage delivered via S-Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) to healthy aortic SMCs, we tested whether such benefits would occur in AAA-SMCs. The mRNA expression of three genes involved in matrix degradation (ACE, ADAMTS5 and ADAMTS8) was significantly downregulated in AAA-SMCs. Total protein and glycosaminoglycans synthesis were higher in AAA-SMCs than healthy-SMCs (p < 0.05 for AAA-vs. healthy- SMC cultures) and was enhanced by GSNO and 3D cultures (p < 0.05 for 3D vs. 2D cultures; p < 0.05 for GSNO vs. non-GSNO cases). Elastin gene expression, synthesis and deposition, desmosine crosslinker levels, and lysyl oxidase (LOX) functional activity were lower, while cell proliferation, iNOS, LOX and fibrillin-1 gene expressions were higher in AAA-SMCs (p < 0.05 between respective cases), with differential benefits from GSNO exposure. GSNO and 3D cultures reduced MMPs −2, −9, and increased TIMP-1 release in AAA-SMC cultures (p < 0.05 for GSNO vs. non-GSNO cultures). AAA-SMCs were inherently stiffer and had smoother surface than healthy SMCs (p < 0.01 in both cases), but GSNO reduced stiffness (~25%; p < 0.01) and increased roughness (p < 0.05) of both cell types. In conclusion, exogenously-delivered NO offers an attractive strategy by providing therapeutic benefits to AAA-SMCs.

Abstract: Increasing evidence shows that heat shock proteins (hsp) escape the cytosol gaining access to the extracellular environment, acting as signaling agents. Since the majority of these proteins lack the information necessary for their export via the classical secretory pathway, attention has been focused on alternative releasing mechanisms. Crossing the plasma membrane is a major obstacle to the secretion of a cytosolic protein into the extracellular milieu. Several mechanisms have been proposed, including direct interaction with the plasma membrane or their release within extracellular vesicles (ECV). HSPB1 (Hsp27), which belongs to the small hsp family, was detected within the membrane of ECV released from stressed HepG2 cells. To further investigate this finding, we studied the interaction of HSPB1 with lipid membranes using liposomes. We found that HSPB1 interacted with liposomes made of palmitoyl oleoyl phosphatidylserine (POPS), palmitoyl oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC), and palmitoyl oleoyl phosphatidylglycerol (POPG), with different characteristics. Another member of the small hsp family, HSPB5 (αB-crystallin), has also been detected within ECV released from HeLa cells transfected with this gene. This protein was found to interact with liposomes as well, but differently than HSPB1. To address the regions interacting with the membrane, proteoliposomes were digested with proteinase K and the protected domains within the liposomes were identified by mass spectroscopy. We observed that large parts of HSPB1 and HSPB5 were embedded within the liposomes, particularly the alpha-crystallin domain. These observations suggest that the interaction with lipid membranes may be part of the mechanisms of export of these proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Toxoplasma can reach distant organs, especially the brain, leading to a lifelong chronic phase. However, genes involved in related in vivo processes are currently unknown. Here, we use focused CRISPR libraries to identify Toxoplasma genes that affect in vivo fitness. We focus on TgWIP, whose deletion affects Toxoplasma dissemination to distant organs. We show that TgWIP is secreted into the host cell upon invasion and interacts with the host WAVE regulatory complex and SHP2 phosphatase, both of which regulate actin dynamics. TgWIP affects the morphology of dendritic cells and mediates the dissolution of podosomes, which dendritic cells use to adhere to extracellular matrix. TgWIP enhances the motility and transmigration of parasitized dendritic cells, likely explaining its effect on in vivo fitness. Our results provide a framework for systemic identification of Toxoplasma genes with in vivo effects at the site of infection or on dissemination to distant organs, including the brain.

Abstract: Summary
Passively administered broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) targeting the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) have been shown to protect non-human primates (NHPs) against chimeric simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infection. With data from multiple non-human primate SHIV challenge studies that used single bNAbs, we conducted a meta-analysis to examine the relationship between predicted serum 50% neutralization titer (ID50) against the challenge virus and infection outcome. In a logistic model that adjusts for bNAb epitopes and challenge viruses, serum ID50 had a highly significant effect on infection risk (p < 0.001). The estimated ID50 to achieve 50%, 75%, and 95% protection was 91 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 55, 153), 219 (117, 410), and 685 (319, 1471), respectively. This analysis indicates that serum neutralizing titer against the relevant virus is a key parameter of protection and that protection from acquisition by a single bNAb might require substantial levels of neutralization at the time of exposure.

Abstract: Summary
Iron is an essential micronutrient for all forms of life; low levels of iron cause human disease, while too much iron is toxic. Low iron levels induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) by disruption of the heme and iron-sulfur cluster-dependent electron transport chain (ETC). To identify bacterial metabolites that affect development, we screened the Keio Escherichia coli collection and uncovered 244 gene deletion mutants that slow Caenorhabditis elegans development. Several of these genes encode members of the ETC cytochrome bo oxidase complex, as well as iron importers. Surprisingly, either iron or anti-oxidant supplementation reversed the developmental delay. This suggests that low bacterial iron results in high bacterial ROS and vice versa, which causes oxidative stress in C. elegans that subsequently impairs mitochondrial function and delays development. Our data indicate that the bacterial diets of C. elegans provide precisely tailored amounts of iron to support proper development.

Abstract: Summary
The selective downregulation of activated intracellular proteins is a key challenge in cell biology. RHO small GTPases switch between a guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-bound and a guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound state that drives downstream signaling. At present, no tool is available to study endogenous RHO-GTPinduced conformational changes in live cells. Here, we established a cell-based screen to selectively degrade RHOB-GTP using F-box-intracellular single-domain antibody fusion. We identified one intracellular antibody (intrabody) that shows selective targeting of endogenous RHOB-GTP mediated by interactions between the CDR3 loop of the domain antibody and the GTP-binding pocket of RHOB. Our results suggest that, while RHOB is highly regulated at the expression level, only the GTP-bound pool, but not its global expression, mediates RHOB functions in genomic instability and in cell invasion. The F-box/intrabody-targeted protein degradation represents a unique approach to knock down the active form of small GTPases or other proteins with multiple cellular activities.

Abstract: Alcohol exposure during pregnancy induces a wide range of structural and functional abnormalities in the fetal heart. However, the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon is not well known. This study was undertaken to elucidate probable mechanisms of myocardial damage induced by prenatal and early postnatal ethanol treatment. Pregnant Wistar rats received ethanol 4.5 g/kg BW once per day from the seventh day of gestation (GD7) throughout lactation. The oxidative stress injury of the myocardium in pups was evaluated by measuring levels of oxidative stress biomarkers. Histopathological examinations and Western blot were performed to evaluate histological features, apoptosis, and molecular alterations in the myocardial tissue of male pups on the postnatal day 21 (PN-21) and postnatal day 90 (PN-90). The results showed that maternal ethanol consumption caused oxidative stress (impaired total antioxidant capacity and malondialdehyde), histological changes, and apoptosis of the myocardium in the pups on PN-21 and PN-90. At the molecular levels, Western blot analysis revealed that ethanol modulated the protein expression of p-ERK1/2, p-JNK, and Hsp70 in the myocardial tissue of the pups after 21 and 90 days of birth compared with the controls. These findings revealed that maternal ethanol intake induced cardiac toxicity in part, mediated by oxidative stress and apoptosis in the pups. A further mechanism study revealed that ethanol enhanced ERK1/2 and JNK phosphorylation and Hsp70 protein expression.

Abstract: The high lactate production rate in hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HCC) have a profound impact on their malignant properties. In adaptation to the enhanced lactate stress, lactate-effusing monocarboxylate transporter 4(MCT4) is usually overexpressed in a broad range of HCC subtypes. In this study, the MCT4-mediated lactate efflux in HCC was blocked using microRNA-145(miR-145), which would force the endogenously generated lactate to accumulate within tumor cells in a self-regulated manner, resulting in the acidification of the cytoplasmic compartment as well as partial neutralization for pH in the tumor extracellular environment. Evaluations on multiple representative HCC subtypes (HepG2, Hep3B and HuH7) suggested that the disrupted pH homeostasis would amplify the lactate stress to initiate HCC apoptosis, while at the same time also suppressing their migration and invasion abilities. Moreover, safety tests on 7702 cells and living animals revealed that MCT4-blockade treatment has no cytotoxicity against healthy cells/tissues. The results indicate the MCT4-inhibition-induced disruption of tumor intracellular pH holds promise as a therapy against not only HCC, but a broader spectrum of MCT4-overexpressing hyperglycolytic tumors.

Abstract: Accumulation of unfolded proteins and calcium dyshomeostasis induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which can be resolved by the unfolded protein response (UPR). We have previously reported that activation of the PERK/ATF4 branch of the UPR, by overexpressing Presenilin in part of the vestigial domain of Drosophila wing imaginal discs, induces both a caspase-dependent apoptosis and a Slpr/JNK/Dilp8-dependent developmental delay that allows compensation of cell death in the tissue. Recently, dDad1 depletion in Drosophila in engrailed-expressing cells of wing imaginal discs was also reported to activate the PERK/ATF4 branch but induced Mekk1/JNK-dependent apoptosis. Here, we assessed whether the stressed cell location in the wing imaginal disc could explain these differences in response to chronic ER stress or whether the stress source could be responsible for the signaling discrepancy. To address this question, we overexpressed a Rhodopsin-1 mutant prone to aggregate either in vestigial- or engrailed-expressing cells. We observed similar responses to the Presenilin overexpression in the vestigial domain and to the dDad1 depletion in the engrailed domain. Therefore, the consequences of a PERK/ATF4 branch activation depend on the position of the cell in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc, suggesting interactions of PERK signaling with developmental pathways involved in the determination or maintenance of wing domains.

Abstract: Summary
Here we elucidate the effect of Alzheimer disease (AD)-predisposing genetic backgrounds, APOE4, PSEN1ΔE9, and APPswe, on functionality of human microglia-like cells (iMGLs). We present a physiologically relevant high-yield protocol for producing iMGLs from induced pluripotent stem cells. Differentiation is directed with small molecules through primitive erythromyeloid progenitors to re-create microglial ontogeny from yolk sac. The iMGLs express microglial signature genes and respond to ADP with intracellular Ca2+ release distinguishing them from macrophages. Using 16 iPSC lines from healthy donors, AD patients and isogenic controls, we reveal that the APOE4 genotype has a profound impact on several aspects of microglial functionality, whereas PSEN1ΔE9 and APPswe mutations trigger minor alterations. The APOE4 genotype impairs phagocytosis, migration, and metabolic activity of iMGLs but exacerbates their cytokine secretion. This indicates that APOE4 iMGLs are fundamentally unable to mount normal microglial functionality in AD.

Abstract: Background
Adipose-derived Stem Cells (ASCs) present great potential for reconstructive procedures. Currently, isolation by enzyme digestion and culturing using xenogenic substances remain the gold standard, impairing clinical use.
Methods
Abdominal lipo-aspirate and blood samples were obtained from healthy patients. A novel mechanical isolation method for ASCs was compared to (the standard) collagenase digestion. ASCs are examined by flowcytometry and multilineage differentiation assays. Cell cultures were performed without xenogenic or toxic substances, using autologous plasma extracted from peripheral blood. After eGFP-transfection, an in vivo differentiation assay was performed.
Results
Mechanical isolation is more successful in isolating CD34+/CD31−/CD45−/CD13+/CD73+/CD146− ASCs from lipo-aspirate than isolation via collagenase digestion (p <0 .05). ASCs display multilineage differentiation potential in vitro. Autologous plasma is a valid additive for ASCs culturing. eGFP-ASCs, retrieved after 3 months in vivo, differentiated in adipocytes and endothelial cells.
Conclusion
A practical method for human ASC isolation and culturing from abdominal lipo-aspirate, without the addition of xenogenic substances, is described. The mechanical protocol is more successful than the current gold standard protocol of enzyme digestion. These results are important in the translation of laboratory-based cell cultures to clinical reconstructive and aesthetic applications.

Abstract: Carbonic anhydrase III (CAIII) is selectively expressed in slow-twitch myofibers in skeletal muscle. The fast-twitch to slow-twitch transformation of myofibers following denervation is accompanied by increased CAIII expression, suggesting that the effects of nerve impulses on skeletal-muscle remodeling influence CAIII expression. Here, we determined the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of nerve conduction on CAIII expression. The results indicated that changes in skeletal-muscle [Ca2+]i altered CAIII expression. Moreover, results from the RNA-interference and over-expression experiments identified myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C) as the key transcription factor regulating [Ca2+]i-mediated changes in CAIII transcription. Additionally, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments and luciferase assays confirmed MEF2C interaction and direct binding of the CAIII promoter between −416 and −200 base pair. Investigations of upstream cytoplasmic signaling pathways responsible for MEF2C activation revealed Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) as the key factor involved in MEF2C-mediated regulation of CAIII expression. This study demonstrates that the Ca2+–CaMKII–MEF2C signaling pathway is the key factor involved in regulating CAIII expression in skeletal muscle. These results provide a theoretical basis supporting further investigations of changes in CAIII levels under different pathophysiological conditions and will facilitate a broader understanding of the biological functions of CAIII.

Abstract: Mammalian Ste20-like kinase 1 (Mst1) is associated with cell apoptosis. In the current study, we explored the regulatory effects of Mst1 on squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) in vitro. SCCHN Cal27 cells and Tu686 cells were transfected with adenovirus-loaded Mst1 to detect the role of Mst1 in cell viability. Then, siRNA against Drp1 was transfected into cells to evaluate the influence of mitochondrial fission in cancer survival. Our data illustrated that Mst1 overexpression promoted SCCHN Cal27 cell and Tu686 cell death via activating mitochondria-related apoptosis. Cells transfected with adenovirus-loaded Mst1 have increased expression of DRP1 and higher DRP1 promoted mitochondrial fission. Active mitochondrial fission mediated mitochondrial damage, as evidenced by increased mitochondrial oxidative stress, decreased mitochondrial energy production, and reduced mitochondrial respiratory complex function. Moreover, Mst1 overexpression triggered mitochondria-dependent cell apoptosis via DRP1-related mitochondrial fission. Further, we found that Mst1 overexpression controlled mitochondrial fission via the β-catenin/DRP1 pathways; inhibition of β-catenin and/or knockdown of DRP1 abolished the pro-apoptotic effects of Mst1 overexpression on SCCHN Cal27 cells and Tu686 cells, leading to the survival of cancer cells in vitro. In sum, our results illustrate that Mst1/β-catenin/DRP1 axis affects SCCHN Cal27 cell and Tu686 cell viability via controlling mitochondrial dynamics balance. This finding identifies Mst1 activation might be an effective therapeutic target for the treatment of SCCHN.

Abstract: Summary
The development of the mammalian retina is a complicated process involving the generation of distinct types of neurons from retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) in a spatiotemporal-specific manner. The progression of RPCs during retinogenesis includes RPC proliferation, cell-fate commitment, and specific neuronal differentiation. In this study, by performing single-cell RNA sequencing of cells isolated from human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived 3D retinal organoids, we successfully deconstructed the temporal progression of RPCs during early human retinogenesis. We identified two distinctive subtypes of RPCs with unique molecular profiles, namely multipotent RPCs and neurogenic RPCs. We found that genes related to the Notch and Wnt signaling pathways, as well as chromatin remodeling, were dynamically regulated during RPC commitment. Interestingly, our analysis identified that CCND1, a G1-phase cell-cycle regulator, was coexpressed with ASCL1 in a cell-cycle-independent manner. Temporally controlled overexpression of CCND1 in retinal organoids demonstrated a role for CCND1 in promoting early retinal neurogenesis. Together, our results revealed critical pathways and novel genes in early retinogenesis of humans.

Abstract: Functional orthopedic treatment is effective for the correction of malformation. Studies demonstrated myoblasts undergo proliferation and apoptosis on certain stretch conditions. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) function in RNA silencing and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, and participate in various biological processes, including proliferation and apoptosis. One hypothesis suggested that miRNA was involved into the procedure via suppressing its target genes then triggered endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis. Therefore, miRNAs play important roles in the regulation of the proliferation and apoptosis of myoblasts. In our study, the miR-147 has been explored. A cyclic mechanical stretch model was established to observe the features of rat L6 myoblasts. The detection of mRNA and protein levels was performed by qRT-PCR and western blot. L6 cell proliferation/apoptosis was checked by CCK-8 assay, DNA fragmentation assay, and caspase-3 activity assay. MiRNA transfections were performed as per the manufacturer’s suggestions: (1) cyclic mechanical stretch induced apoptosis of L6 myoblasts and inhibition of miR-147; (2) miR-147 attenuated cyclic mechanical stretch-induced apoptosis of L6 myoblasts; (3) miR-147 attenuated cyclic mechanical stretch-induced L6 myoblast endoplasmic reticulum stress; (4) BRMS1 was a direct target of miR-147 in L6 myoblasts; (5) miR-147/BRMS1 axis participated in the regulation of cyclic mechanical stress on L6 myoblasts. MiR-147 attenuates endoplasmic reticulum stress by targeting BRMS1 to inhibit cyclic mechanical stretch-induced apoptosis of L6 myoblasts.

Abstract: ADP-ribosylation factor 3 (ARF3) is a member of the KRAS proto-oncogene, GTPase(Ras) super-family of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that mediates Golgi-related mitosis, but its role in malignant cells is unclear. In the present study, we found that mRNA and protein expression of ARF3 is up-regulated in breast cancer cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of 167 paraffin-embedded archived breast cancer tissues showed that ARF3 expression was localized primarily in the cytoplasm and was significantly up-regulated in malignant specimens compared to benign specimens. There were strong associations between ARF3 expression and clinicopathological characteristics in breast cancer. We also found that overexpressing ARF3 promoted, while silencing endogenous ARF3 inhibited, the proliferation of breast cancer cells by regulating cell cycle G1-S transition. Moreover, the pro-proliferative effect of ARF3 on breast cancer cells was associated with inactivation of the forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) transcription factor. ARF3 promotes breast cancer cell proliferation through the participation of FOXO1 and represents as a novel prognostic marker and therapeutic target for breast cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The regulation of the proliferation and polarity of neural progenitors is crucial for the development of the brain cortex. Animal studies have implicated glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) as a pivotal regulator of both proliferation and polarity, yet the functional relevance of its signaling for the unique features of human corticogenesis remains to be elucidated. We harnessed human cortical brain organoids to probe the longitudinal impact of GSK3 inhibition through multiple developmental stages. Chronic GSK3 inhibition increased the proliferation of neural progenitors and caused massive derangement of cortical tissue architecture. Single-cell transcriptome profiling revealed a direct impact on early neurogenesis and uncovered a selective role of GSK3 in the regulation of glutamatergic lineages and outer radial glia output. Our dissection of the GSK3-dependent transcriptional network in human corticogenesis underscores the robustness of the programs determining neuronal identity independent of tissue architecture.

Abstract: Summary
Pathogen pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) trigger innate immune responses to invading pathogens. All known PRRs for viral RNA have extranuclear localization. However, for many viruses, replication generates dsRNA in the nucleus. Here, we show that the nuclear matrix protein SAFA (also known as HnRNPU) functions as a nuclear viral dsRNA sensor for both DNA and RNA viruses. Upon recognition of viral dsRNA, SAFA oligomerizes and activates the enhancers of antiviral genes, including IFNB1. Moreover, SAFA is required for the activation of super-enhancers, which direct vigorous immune gene transcription to establish the antiviral state. Myeloid-specific SAFA-deficient mice were more susceptible to lethal HSV-1 and VSV infection, with decreased type I IFNs. Thus, SAFA functions as a nuclear viral RNA sensor and trans-activator to bridge innate sensing with chromatin remodeling and potentiate robust antiviral responses.

Abstract: Introduction
Periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) are vital for the regeneration of periodontal tissues. Potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) has recently been applied as a component of the mineralization inducing medium (MM), which can be used to induce osteogenic differentiation of dental stem cells. However, whether KH2PO4 has effects on PDLSCs has not been studied.
Materials and methods
PDLSCs were isolated by magnetic activated cell sorting and cultured. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and ALP protein expression of PDLSCs treated with different concentrations of KH2PO4 were examined to make sure the optimal concentration of KH2PO4 for the following experiments. The effects of KH2PO4 on the proliferation and differentiation of PDLSCs were investigated by flow cytometry, cell counting kit-8 assay, alizarin red staining, real-time RT-PCR, and Western blot. The involvement of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway in KH2PO4-treated PDLSCs was analyzed by Western blot and alizarin red staining.
Results
ALP activity assay and ALP protein expression examination revealed that 1.8 mmol/L KH2PO4 was the optimal concentration for the induction of hPDLSCs by KH2PO4. The proliferation and mineralization capacity of PDLSCs treated with KH2PO4 were enhanced as compared with the control group. PDLSCs treated with KH2PO4 showed an improved proliferation capacity in logarithmic growth phase at day 7. As PDLSCs were treated with KH2PO4, the expression of odonto/osteogenic markers (OCN/OCN, DSP/DSPP, OSX/OSX, RUNX2/RUNX2, and ALP/ALP) in cells were up-regulated at day 3 or 7. Moreover, the expression of IκBα in cytoplasm was down-regulated, along with an increased expression of p-P65 in cytoplasm and an up-regulated expression of P65 in nucleus. When treated with BMS345541 (the specific NF-κB inhibitor), the odonto/osteogenic differentiation of KH2PO4-treated PDLSCs was significantly attenuated.
Conclusion
KH2PO4 can improve the proliferation and odonto/osteogenic differentiation capacity of PDLSCs via NF-κB pathway, and thus represents a potential target involved in the regeneration of periodontium for clinical treatments.

Abstract: Clinical trials testing mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) as a cellular remedy for acute liver injury (ALI) are underway, but its underlying mechanism has not been thoroughly scrutinized. We highlight that the metabolomic profile of the liver-resident immune cells is significantly altered after MSC administration; its potential correlation with ALI remission is discussed in this study. C57BL/6 mice are randomly divided into three groups: the sham group, MSC-treated ALI group and PBS-treated ALI group; acute liver injury is induced by intraperitoneal injection of carbon tetrachloride. A high-performance chemical isotope labeling liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (CIL LC–MS) is exploited to profile amine, phenol and carbonyl submetabolome of the liver-resident immune cells in different treatments. 4295 peak pairs are quantified and 2461 peak pairs are further identified in zero-reaction and one-reaction libraries. Clear separation of the three groups is observed in the global PCA and OPLS-DA analyses. We identified 256 metabolites to be candidate biomarkers for ALI-activated immunity and 114 metabolites to be candidate biomarkers for MSC-modulated immunity. Ariginine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism are most affected in both cases, with eight significantly regulated metabolites as joints (glutamic-gamma-semialdehyde, aspartate acid, glutamate acid, gamma-Aminobutyric acidorinithine, 2-keto-glutaramic acid, N-acetylornithine, citrulline and ornithine). These findings shed new light on the therapeutic benefit of immune modulation during ALI rescue. It needs to be further investigated whether exogenous supply of certain metabolites will exert a profound impact on the metabolic network, crosstalking with immune responses and modulating ALI prognosis.

Abstract: Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)-activated macrophages (BAMs) have anti-tumor effects, especially on fibrosarcoma cells. However, the mechanism governing this process has not been elucidated to date. TRIM59 is an up-regulated membrane protein expressed on the surface of BAMs. In this study, we found that up-regulated TRIM59 macrophages exhibited excellent growth inhibition on MCA207 fibrosarcoma and induced tumor apoptosis. Moreover, TRIM59 enhanced macrophage infiltration and increased the M1 phenotype macrophages inside the tumor. Furthermore, the cytotoxic T cells and B cells in the spleen and lymphnode have not been affected by TRIM59. These results showed that macrophages expressing TRIM59 exhibited the main cytotoxic effect on tumors. In vitro, we co-cultured TRIM59 up-regulated macrophages fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde or cell culture supernatant and tumor cells. We found that the killing activities of macrophages decreased after treatment with anti-TRIM59 antibody, and the supernatant of TRIM59 up-regulated macrophages had no tumoricidal effect on fibrosarcoma cells, which demonstrated that TRIM59 may be involved in tumoricidal effects via cell-cell contact. In addition, the PI3K-Akt pathway of MCA207 co-cultured with macrophages highly expressing TRIM59 was significantly inhibited, whereas the activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway in MCA207 was not affected after co-culture with TRIM59-CKO macrophages. These results define a vital role of TRIM59 as an anti-tumor effector molecule of BAMs and suggest a new therapeutic target for the treatment of fibrosarcoma.

Abstract: Prostate cancer is the main cause of cancer-related mortality in men around the world and an important health problem. DU-145 human prostate cancer cells provide an opportunity to investigate prostate cancer. Betaine has a number of anticancer effects, such as inactivation of carcinogens, inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis. However, there is no study investigating the effects of betaine on DU-145 cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of different concentrations of betaine on the oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation on DU-145 cells. Firstly, we proved the cytotoxic activity of betaine (0 to 150 mg/ml) on DU-145 cells by using 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol, 2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and defined the optimal concentration of betaine. Then, by employing the doses found in MTT, the levels of antioxidant (GSH, SOD, CAT, and TAS) and oxidant (MDA and TOS) molecules, pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-a and IL-6), apoptotic proteins (CYCS and CASP3), and DNA fragmentation were measured. Morphological changes and apoptosis were evaluated using H&E technique, Bax and Bcl-2 immunohistochemistry. Results suggested that betaine caused oxidative stress, inflammation, inhibition of cell growth, apoptosis, and morphological alterations in DU-145 cells dose-dependently. Furthermore, treatments with increasing betaine concentrations decreased the antioxidant levels in cells. We actually revealed that betaine, known as an antioxidant, may prevent cell proliferation by acting as an oxidant in certain doses. In conclusion, betaine may act as a biological response modifier in prostate cancer treatment in a dose-dependent manner.

Abstract: Summary
The host must develop tolerance to commensal microbes and protective responses to infectious pathogens, yet the mechanisms enabling a privileged relationship with commensals remain largely unknown. Skin colonization by commensal Staphylococcus epidermidis facilitates immune tolerance preferentially in neonates via induction of antigen-specific regulatory T cells (Tregs). Here, we demonstrate that this tolerance is not indiscriminately extended to all bacteria encountered in this early window. Rather, neonatal colonization by Staphylococcus aureus minimally enriches for antigen-specific Tregs and does not prevent skin inflammation upon later-life exposure. S. aureus α-toxin contributes to this response by stimulating myeloid cell production of IL-1β, which limits S. aureus-specific Tregs. Loss of α-toxin or the IL-1 receptor increases Treg enrichment, whereas topical application of IL-1β or α-toxin diminishes tolerogenic responses to S. epidermidis. Thus, the preferential activation of a key alarmin pathway facilitates early discrimination of microbial “foe” from “friend,” thereby preventing tolerance to a common skin pathogen.

Abstract: Summary
Despite substantial interest in the species diversity of the human microbiome and its role in disease, the scale of its genetic diversity, which is fundamental to deciphering human-microbe interactions, has not been quantified. Here, we conducted a cross-study meta-analysis of metagenomes from two human body niches, the mouth and gut, covering 3,655 samples from 13 studies. We found staggering genetic heterogeneity in the dataset, identifying a total of 45,666,334 non-redundant genes (23,961,508 oral and 22,254,436 gut) at the 95% identity level. Fifty percent of all genes were “singletons,” or unique to a single metagenomic sample. Singletons were enriched for different functions (compared with non-singletons) and arose from sub-population-specific microbial strains. Overall, these results provide potential bases for the unexplained heterogeneity observed in microbiome-derived human phenotypes. One the basis of these data, we built a resource, which can be accessed at https://microbial-genes.bio.
