Abstract: Light-induced plating of a Ni-Cu-Ag stack allows for high efficient and potentially low cost solar cell metallization. The definition of the contact structure is performed by local laser ablation of the solar cells surface passivation layer. By using a femtosecond pulsed UV laser the crystal damage due to ablation is minimized in respect to any other approach of laser-structuring. Within the study presented plated contacts on femtosecond structured silicon are evaluated regarding electrical and mechanical properties. The results show that contact resistance is determined by a highly inhomogeneous interface oxide layer that is formed while femtosecond pulsed laser ablation on textured solar cell surfaces. Silicidation of the silicon/nickel contact interface is assumed to be essential for adhesion and low contact resistances. However, the results presented indicate that mechanical adhesion of contacts plated on femtosecond laser structured surfaces is ensured by the laser-induced microstructure and that low contact resistance and high fill-factors are reached when interface oxides are fully dissolved. Therefore, controlling the surface properties before metal-deposition is essential for plated contacts on femtosecond pulse laser structured silicon while silicide formation may be superfluous.

Abstract: Herein, we demonstrate the effect of TiO2 nanocrystals shapes on the structural, optical and photocatalytic properties for solar hydrogen (H2) production in aqueous glycerol solution. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) with different shapes such as nanotubes (TNT), nanorods (TNR) and nanosquares (TNS) were chosen and their photocatalytic performances were evaluated under similar conditions. It was observed that the TNT photocatalyst showed 1.5 and 2.0 folds enhanced H2 production rate compared to TNR and TNS photocatalysts. Glycerol in water undergoes direct oxidation with in-situ generated holes to produce H+ in aqueous solution which in-turn accepts pair of electrons to generate H2 gas only. The catalytic performance is in good correspondence with the photocurrent density of the respective nanostructures in the following order TNT>TNR>TNS. The BET surface area of TNT displayed the improved adsorption of glycerol and its intermediates as compared to other catalysts. Thus, the enhanced photocatalytic activity of TNT was attributed to its synergistic properties owing to their peculiar one dimensional (1-D) nanotubular shape with active sites both interior and exterior surfaces. It enhanced the electron-pair lifetime and more efficient charge separation in TNT compared to TNR and TNS.

Abstract: Multicrystalline (mc) n-type silicon has proven to be a suitable substrate for the fabrication of highly efficient mc-Si solar cells. In this paper, we elaborate the impact of base material parameters on the efficiency potential of n-type mc-Si solar cells featuring a boron-diffused front side emitter and a full-area passivating rear contact (TOPCon). The electrical material quality can be significantly improved by replacing the standard crystallization process with a seed-assisted growth for crystallization of high-performance (HP) mc silicon. Using high-purity quartz crucibles or larger crucibles in combination with an optimization of the grain boundary area fraction with an adapted seed structure leads to further improvements of the material quality in terms of charge carrier lifetimes. However, not only the charge carrier lifetime, but also the base resistivity is of crucial importance for the efficiency potential depending on the cell concept. Based on experimental data and simulations, we assess the optimal range for the base resistivity and the wafer thickness for n-type mc-Si TOPCon solar cells. With the optimal material parameters, an “efficiency limiting bulk recombination analysis” (ELBA) reveals an efficiency potential in the range of 22.5% for n-type mc-Si TOPCon solar cells. Finally, we fabricated TOPCon solar cells based on optimized n-type HP mc-Si substrate and demonstrate a certified efficiency of 21.9%, which is the highest efficiency reported for multicrystalline silicon solar cells so far.

Abstract: Bulk hetro-junction organic solar cells (BHJ-OSCs) which made by coating the blend of highly electron rich, poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) as a donor and extremely electron deficient, soluble C60 derivative, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) as an acceptor between the high work function positive electrode, ITO and low work function metal negative electrode Al, showed exciting results than the bilayer counterpart in the last two decades, thus the scientific circle and solar cell manufacturing groups are focusing on this treasured field. Fullerene derivative based BHJ-OSCs showed astonishing efficiencies due the high donor-acceptor (D-A) interface, high open-circuit voltage (Voc), easy processing, and thermal stability. Hence, the design of the fullerene derivative plays a vital role in the efficiency of the OSCs. Numerous papers were published on the PC61/71BM and various functionally modified fullerene acceptors in the past several years with higher efficiency, higher LUMO level, and improved solubility. The symmetrical structure of PC61BM showed high aggregation properties, insufficient absorption in the visible region, but unsymmetrical PC71BM had a good optical absorption in the visible region, hence it was the most desirable choice for best performing solar cells. From the comparison, it was clear that the modification in the PC61/71BM core with aryl group, alkyl chain length, and end group modification didn’t show any significant difference in the PCE with the P3HT polymer donor in BHJ-OSCs device structure. Fullerenes multi-adducts performed better than the PC61/71BM due to the development in the Voc. In multi-functionalization, mainly bis-functionalization showed better performance than mono-adduct. C60 and C70 based hetro bis-adducts namely, C60(CH2)(Ind), and OQMF70 showed the highest PCE of 5.90%, and 6.61% respectively, which was comparable with the indene based bis-adducts. Commonly, tris-adduct fullerenes showed the lowest PCE due to the isomer effect and electron trapping, but OQBMF was a hetro tris-adduct of C60-methanofullerenes, which showed a excellent PCE of 6.43% due to improved Voc. Similarly, indene substituted C60 and C70 fullerenes based bis-adducts showed supreme PCE, of 6.5% (IC60BA) and ~6.7% (IC70BA) respectively, peak PCE was attributed to the high electron donating indene group, which enhanced the LUMO level due to the shrinkage in the π-system. The dihydronapthyl based fullerene bis-adduct derivatives such as, NC60BA, and NC70BA showed the best performance of 5.37%, and 5.95% respectively, than the mono-adduct. Even though abundant fulleropyrrolidines were reported, the performance of the fulleropyrrolidines based device was very deprived than the PC61/71BM based devices. Though the OSCs are comparatively efficient for commercial application due the insufficient efficiency and lower environmental stability factors controls the early arrival to the market. Therefore, it is essential to go through the recent fullerene derivatives based literatures, including mono-, bis-, tris- and multi-adducts of various methanofullerene derivative, indene based fullerene derivatives, dihydronaptyl substituted fullerenes, fulleropyrolidines, 1,2 and 1,4-adducts and fullerene derivatives for OSCs applications. In this regard, we discussed the present development in fullerene derivative and summarized the efficient fullerene derivatives for the BHJ-OSCs application and suggest a possible scenario for the future development in the fullerene cage.

Abstract: Impact of Na in Cu2SnS3 (CTS) films on their physical properties and photovoltaic performances is investigated. CTS films are fabricated by sulfurization of NaF/Cu/SnS2 stacked precursors. NaF precursor is used as primary Na source for Na introduction into the CTS films. It is demonstrated that Na content in the resulting CTS films is increased with enhancing thickness of NaF precursor, leading to the increase in Na/Cu atomic ratio but decrease in Cu/Sn atomic ratio. This suggests that the addition of NaF capping layer on the Cu/SnS2 stacked precursors suppresses evaporation of Sn-S compounds from the sample during sulfurization, thus forming Sn2S3 secondary. Therefore, with too thick NaF layer (greater than or equal to 75nm), Sn2S3 secondary phase in bulk and near surface of the resulting CTS films, having the detrimental effect on cell performances, is severely formed. However, the CTS grain sizes are notably enlarged as the thickness of NaF precursor increases. As a result, conversion efficiency of CTS thin-film solar cell with anti-reflective layer is increased up to 4.8% with the optimized NaF thickness of 60nm since the single-phase and large-grain CTS absorbing layer without Sn2S3 secondary phase near the surface is attained, thereby increasing open-circuit voltage and fill factor attributed to the decrease in the carrier recombination.

Abstract: An ionic liquid (IL), 1-butyl-3-{2-oxo-2-[(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl-4-yl)amino]ethyl}-1H-imidazol-3-ium tetrafluoroborate (TILBF4), containing a stable radical, 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyl-oxy (TEMPO), was synthesized successfully. The TILBF4 shows two distinctive properties having the characteristics of ion-storage and supporting electrolyte materials. In this study, a hybrid electrochromic device (ECD) with a high coloration efficiency based on this TILBF4 and a poly(3,3-diethyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-thieno-[3,4-b][1,4]dioxepine) (PProDOT-Et2) thin film was proposed. The maximum absorbance of the PProDOT-Et2/TILBF4 ECD was noticed at 590nm upon applying the cell potential between −1.0 and 1.0V. The device exhibits a transmittance change (ΔT) of 62.2% at 590nm when being switched in the first transition, with short switching times of 4.0s for bleaching and 3.6s for coloring. A relatively high coloration efficiency (η) of 983.0cm2/C was achieved at 590nm. Furthermore, the ECD maintained 98.0% of its initial ΔT after consecutive operation for 1000 cycles between −1.0 and 1.0V.

Abstract: Single cell transcriptomics is becoming a common technique to unravel new biological phenomena whose functional significance can only be understood in the light of differences in gene expression between single cells. The technology is still in its early days and therefore suffers from many technical challenges. This review discusses the continuous effort to identify and systematically characterise various sources of technical variability in single cell expression data and the need to further develop experimental and computational tools and resources to help deal with it.

Abstract: The time-dependent dynamics of the charge and discharge of photo-supercapacitors (PSC), devices which combine a supercapacitor with a solar cell, are investigated using a semi-analytical model. For a given PSC, it is found that the maximum Energy Conversion and Storage Efficiency (ECSE) is a direct function of the Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE) and Fill Factor (FF) of the solar cell. The capacitance, series and shunt resistances of the supercapacitor affect the time constants of the PSC and the value of the maximum ECSE. To experimentally measure the maximum value of ECSE with at most 2 charge-discharge cycles, a simple experimental procedure is proposed, which consists in comparing the power flowing through the supercapacitor and the energy already stored in it. The theoretical results are validated with experiments on a PSC made from an organic solar cell and a commercial supercapacitor.

Abstract: Metabolomics is a key approach in modern functional genomics and systems biology. Due to the complexity of metabolomics data, the variety of experimental designs, and the multiplicity of bioinformatics tools, providing experimenters with a simple and efficient resource to conduct comprehensive and rigorous analysis of their data is of utmost importance. In 2014, we launched the Workflow4Metabolomics (W4M; http://workflow4metabolomics.org) online infrastructure for metabolomics built on the Galaxy environment, which offers user-friendly features to build and run data analysis workflows including preprocessing, statistical analysis, and annotation steps. Here we present the new W4M 3.0 release, which contains twice as many tools as the first version, and provides two features which are, to our knowledge, unique among online resources. First, data from the four major metabolomics technologies (i.e., LC–MS, FIA–MS, GC–MS, and NMR) can be analyzed on a single platform. By using three studies in human physiology, alga evolution, and animal toxicology, we demonstrate how the 40 available tools can be easily combined to address biological issues. Second, the full analysis (including the workflow, the parameter values, the input data and output results) can be referenced with a permanent digital object identifier (DOI). Publication of data analyses is of major importance for robust and reproducible science. Furthermore, the publicly shared workflows are of high-value for e-learning and training. The Workflow4Metabolomics 3.0 e-infrastructure thus not only offers a unique online environment for analysis of data from the main metabolomics technologies, but it is also the first reference repository for metabolomics workflows.

Abstract: Unencapsulated CIGS solar cells were simultaneously exposed to either dry or damp heat combined illumination. In-situ monitoring of their electrical parameters demonstrated a rapid decrease of the efficiency for the solar cells exposed to damp heat plus illumination. This decrease was mainly driven by changes in the shunt resistances, affecting also the open circuit voltage and fill factor, while a minor increase in series resistance was also observed. The solar cells exposed to dry heat plus illumination were almost stable during the exposure. The solar cells were studied before and after exposure in order to investigate their material changes. For the dry heat illumination samples, the visual characteristics remained unchanged, while for the damp heat illumination samples, spots that were likely shunted, were observed. For these solar cells, SIMS showed the migration of sodium, likely leading to changes in the shunt resistance and output voltage. A similar, but less severe migration effect was observed for potassium, so this element might also have a small, but comparable role. Migration of hydroxide, likely caused by water ingression, was also observed and probably affected the conductivity of the ZnO:Al front contact. The migration of sodium and hydroxide was especially strong on the spot locations. These changes were not observed for the dry heat illumination samples. From these experiments, it was concluded that unencapsulated CIGS solar cells can degrade rapidly in the presence of humidity, but in the absence of water, these solar cells were stable even under high temperatures and illumination intensities.

Abstract: A new approach to back contacting CdTe solar cells that uses an organic poly(3-hexythiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) back contact layer is reported. The most striking benefit of P3HT was demonstrated to be through a “pinhole blocking” effect, significantly improving performance uniformity. This was demonstrated through comparison of open circuit voltage values for a large sample set (600 cells) and through measurement of a device with a graded absorber layer thickness (0.7–1.9µm). The conversion efficiency achievable and the electrical barrier height of the contacts to the CdTe were also investigated for P3HT/Au and Au control contacts – both being tested with and without additional Cu. Temperature dependent JV measurement showed the use of P3HT reduced the barrier to (0.29–0.33eV) from the value achievable with Au (0.39–0.42eV), but inclusion of Cu into either of the structures gave the lowest barriers (0.21–0.22eV). For the data sets recorded, P3HT/Au yielded higher peak efficiencies than the Au control contact. However, when Cu was included the peak performance of devices having P3HT/Cu/Au and Cu/Au contacts were comparable at 14.7% respectively but the P3HT/Cu/Au contact displayed a significantly higher average performance through increased uniformity of the device response.

Abstract: Molten salts as phase change materials (PCMs) can be used as thermal storage media in concentrated solar power (CSP) plants. The addition of nanoparticles into a base fluid (producing the so called nanofluid) can enhance its thermal properties. The most common technique involves the use of water. We present a new procedure based on high temperature mixing. In particular, different nanofluids were developed by mixing NaNO3-KNO3 (60–40wt%) solar salt with 1.0wt% of SiO2, Al2O3 and a mix of SiO2/Al2O3 nanoparticles at 300°C using a twin screw micro-compounder. The effect of different screw speeds (100 and 200rpm) and mixing times (15 and 30min) were studied. The results showed that the nanoparticles induce an increase of the heat of fusion of 1.5–7.4% while the onset temperatures decrease for all the nanofluids independently from the processing conditions (up to 9.7°C). Moreover, an increase in the specific heat (Cp) is recorded mainly for the nanofluid with SiO2/Al2O3 with a maximum of 52.1% in solid phase and 18.6% in liquid phase after 30min of mixing at 200rpm. The same nanofluid showed the highest stored heat. Particle aggregation into clusters in solid state was detected by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) but smaller aggregates resulted for higher mixing times and screw speed related to the highest Cp. Moreover, smaller grains in the nanofluids were detected with respect to the base salt morphology. Thus, the nanofluid produced with SiO2/Al2O3 nanoparticles at 200rpm for 30min gives the best overall performances. This work showed that nanofluids with enhanced thermal properties can be obtained with an innovative mixing process directly at high temperature, eliminating the water evaporation step.

Abstract: A simple direct, scalable and reproducible approach for preparing photoelectrochemically active BiVO4 films on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates by hydrothermal method using a mixing solvent of ethylene glycol/water was presented for the first time. As-prepared BiVO4 thin films were found to have pure monoclinic scheelite structure with a compact, irregular microstructured morphology and strong absorption in the visible-light region with estimated bandgap of 2.4eV. When applied as an electrode material for water splitting in borate electrolyte solution, a significantly enhanced stability, coupled with a 15-fold increase in photocurrent density (ca. 1.04mAcm−2) are observed compared to those of conventional hydrothermal synthesized films. The BiVO4 prepared with mixed solvent gave a substantial enhancement of the incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) and absorbed photon to current efficiency (APCE) during light driven oxygen evolution reaction.

Abstract: Photothermal conversion efficiency depends significantly on the selectivity of the thermal receiver surface through which a heat transfer fluid flows in a concentrated solar power system. This paper presents studies on novel multiscale, fractal textured solar selective coatings for solar thermal applications. The fractal surfaces are fabricated integrally on the substrate material using electrodeposition. The coatings are described in terms of fractal parameters that are uniquely determined from surface measurements, and the optical properties of the coatings are experimentally characterized in detail in terms of the fractal parameters. The effects of heat treatment on the optical properties of coatings over a range of fractal parameters are also described. The study is presented considering coatings on copper to demonstrate that fractal texturing of the surface provides a nearly three-fold performance improvement compared to coatings with no texturing or heat treatment. The findings equally apply to other materials used in higher temperature solar thermal applications.

Abstract: In this paper, the effects of cavity surface materials on the radiative flux distribution of solar cavity receivers have been studied with the help of a ray-tracing methodology. Three metallic substrate materials (Inconel 600, austenitic stainless steel 253 MA and Kanthal APM) and two coating materials (Pyromark® 2500 coating and YSZ TBC coating) were selected as the candidate cavity surface materials. The results show that the flux distribution and the total optical efficiency are much more sensitive to the absorptivity on the cylindrical surface than on the bottom. By using high absorptivity coating on the cylindrical surface and low absorptivity coating on the bottom, the radiative flux on the bottom can be controlled at a low level, and it can help to reduce the cavity length for an impinging receiver with jets on the cylindrical surface. Furthermore, the radiative flux distribution on the cylindrical surface can also be tailored to meet various design requirements by applying different coating designs on the cylindrical surface.

Abstract: Protein Arginine Methyl Transferase 1 (PRMT1) is deemed to be a potential oncogenic protein considering its overexpression in several malignancies including colorectal cancer. However, the molecular pathogenesis regarding PRMT1 overexpression and overall poor patient survival involved in this devastating and life threatening cancer remains obscured. In our previous study, we have identified FAM98A as a novel substrate of PRMT1 and also identified its role in ovarian cancer progression. Here, we showed that the two structural homologs FAM98A and FAM98B included in a novel complex with DDX1 and C14orf166 are required for PRMT1 expression. Analysis of the data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and clinical colorectal cancer specimens also demonstrated a strong positive correlation and co-occurrence of PRMT1, FAM98A and FAM98B. These findings provide a mechanistic insight into how knockdown of FAM98A or FAM98B can suppress the malignant characteristics of cancer cells. Besides, we showed that FAM98A and FAM98B are working in the same axis as knockdown of both proteins together does not cause additional reduction in the cellular proliferation and colony formation of colorectal cancer cells.

Abstract: The neuron-enriched, endosomal protein Calcyon (Caly) regulates endocytosis and vesicle sorting, and is important for synaptic plasticity and brain development. In the current investigation of Caly interacting proteins in brain, the microtubule retrograde motor subunit, cytoplasmic dynein 1 heavy chain (DYNC1H), and microtubule structural proteins, α and β tubulin, were identified as Caly associated proteins by MALDI-ToF/ToF. Direct interaction of the Caly-C terminus with dynein and tubulin was further confirmed in in vitro studies. In Cos-7 cells, mCherry-Caly moved along the microtubule network in organelles largely labeled by the late endosome marker Rab7. Expression of the dynein inhibitor CC1, produced striking alterations in Caly distribution, consistent with retrograde motors playing a prominent role in Caly localization and movement. In axons of cultured adult rat sensory neurons, Caly-positive organelles co-localized with dynein intermediate chain (DYNC1I1-isoform IC-1B) and the dynein regulator, lissencephaly 1 (LIS1), both of which co-precipitated from brain with the Caly C-terminus. Manipulation of dynein function in axons altered the motile properties of Caly indicating that Caly vesicles utilize the retrograde motor. Altogether, the current evidence for association with dynein motors raises the possibility that the endocytic and cargo sorting functions of Caly in neurons could be regulated by interaction with the microtubule transport system.

Abstract: Generation of oxylipins (oxygenated metabolites of fatty acids) by lipoxygenases may be responsible for the beneficial effects of 20- and 22-carbon n-3 fatty acids on adipose tissue dysfunction in obesity, but the potential actions of oxylipins derived from 18-carbon fatty acids, which are generally at higher levels in the diet, are unknown. We therefore compared the effects of select lipoxygenase-derived oxylipins produced from α-linolenic acid (ALA, C18:3 n-3), linoleic acid (LA, C18:2 n-6), and arachidonic acid (AA, C20:4 n-6) on key adipocyte functions that are altered in obesity. Individual oxylipins were added to the culture medium of differentiating 3T3-L1 preadipocytes for 6days. Lipid accumulation was subsequently determined by Oil Red O staining, while Western blotting was used to measure levels of proteins associated with lipid metabolism and characteristics of adipocyte functionality. Addition of all oxylipins at 30nM was sufficient to significantly decrease triglyceride accumulation in lipid droplets, and higher levels completely blocked lipid production. Our results establish that lipoxygenase-derived oxylipins produced from 18-carbon PUFA differentially affect multiple adipocyte processes associated with lipid storage and adipokine production. However, these effects are not due to the oxylipins blocking adipocyte maturation and thus globally suppressing all adipocyte characteristics. Furthermore, these oxylipin species decrease the lipid content of adipocytes regardless from which precursor fatty acid or lipoxygenase they were derived. Consequently, adipocyte characteristics can be altered through the ability of oxylipins to selectively modulate levels of proteins involved in both lipid metabolism and adipokine production.

Abstract: Transparent and conducting ITO/Ag/ITO (IAI) multilayer coatings were deposited on glass and flexible fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) substrates by reactive sputtering using metallic In:Sn (90%:10%) and Ag targets at room temperature. Middle Ag layer thickness was optimized to obtain maximum figure of merit (ϕ) and the optimum Ag layer thickness was found to be ~13nm. The optimized IAI multilayer on glass substrate showed transmittance of ~88.6% and sheet resistance of ~7.1Ω/sq. The transmittance increased to ~91.4% for the IAI multilayer deposited on one side etched glass. The optimized IAI multilayer coating was also deposited on flexible FEP substrates. The electrical, optical, structural and morphological properties of IAI deposited on glass and FEP substrates were compared. IAI deposited on FEP substrate showed transmittance of ~90.2% at λ = 550nm, sheet resistance of ~6.9Ω/sq. and figure of merit of ~52 × 10−3Ω−1. Bending test of IAI deposited FEP proved the high flexibility of IAI multilayer for the flexible transparent electrode applications. Solar selectivity study of IAI on FEP substrate showed it can effectively reflect the higher wavelength region of solar spectrum and can be used as a flexible solar spectrum segregator. Optical haze measurements of IAI coated glass and FEP show that high haze value can be achieved by increasing the roughness on non-coated side of the FEP substrate.

Abstract: This paper reported on the synthesis of silica nanosheets (SNSs) by structurally modifying natural coal-series kaolinite mineral (Kc). Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) of about 5nm were uniformly attached on the surface of Sn2+-activated SNSs to form an emerging hierarchical porous nanostructure, which was further hybridized with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to produce PEG@Ag/Sn2+-SNSs. The maximum loading capacity and melting enthalpy of PEG@Ag/Sn2+-SNSs could reach 66.1% and 113.9J/g, respectively, and its thermal conductivity showed up to 0.84W/(mK). The results demonstrated that well dispersion of AgNPs and hierarchical porous structure of Ag/Sn2+-SNSs could synergically enhance the thermal conductivity. Intriguingly, the introduction of AgNPs could lead to the obvious decrease of the melting and solidifying period, and simultaneously promoted the heat transfer of the composite phase change material (PCM). Furthermore, the composite PCM could retain good thermal reliability after 200 cycles, indicating its potential application in the thermal energy storage system. Atomic-level mechanism for the enhanced thermal conductivity of the composite PCM was also discussed.

Abstract: Oxygen vacancies particularly for those located on the photocatalyst surface are believed to play an important role in its photocatalytic process. In this work, surface oxygen vacancies were introduced into hydrothermally-synthesized BiFeO3 (BFO) nanocrystals through high pressure hydrogenation treatment, and with increasing hydrogenation temperature the oxygen vacancy concentration would increase. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) results indicated no pronounced structure change when the hydrogenation temperature was below 200°C. The formation of surface oxygen vacancies on BFO nanocrystals was verified by a variety of techniques such as high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). The hydrogenated BFO nanocrystals exhibited nearly four times methyl orange (MO) photodegradation efficiency higher than pristine BFO under visible light irradiation, and the inherent correlation between surface oxygen vacancies and enhanced photocatalytic activity was established. Our findings demonstrate that the formation of surface oxygen vacancies on the hydrogenated BFO nanocrystals could narrow the band gap of BFO resulting in the improved light absorption capability, act as trapping centers for photoinduced electrons thus to facilitate the separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs as well as the production of predominant active species (hydroxyl radicals) for MO photodegradation, suppress the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, and also favor the adsorption of MO molecules. All these factors could contribute to the observed enhanced photocatalytic activity of the hydrogenated BFO nanocrystals for MO degradation. In addition, the as-formed surface oxygen vacancies were also stable at room temperature.

Abstract: The NaNO3 microcapsules (MCP-NaNO3-2) with good thermal stability were prepared by twice repeating the process of microencapsulation. The thermal stability of MCP-NaNO3-2 was tested by thermal cycles and high-temperature heating in the furnace. The thermal properties, such as latent heat, melting point, supercooling degree, were determined by thermogravimetric analyzer (TG) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The microcapsule morphologies were observed by optical microscope and scanning electron microscope. After 80 thermal cycles mainly between 250 and 350℃, the latent heat of MCP-NaNO3-2 only had a small reduction of about 3.6%, the melting point of MCP-NaNO3-2 only decreased by about 1℃, and the supercooling degree of MCP-NaNO3-2 slightly fluctuated within about 2℃. Additionally, the thermal properties of the MCP-NaNO3-2 heated for 5h at 350, 450, 500, and 550℃ showed that the latent heat of MCP-NaNO3-2 was relatively stable until 500℃, from 136.1 to 130.3J/g, but sharply decreased to 110.2J/g at 550℃. It is concluded that MCP-NaNO3-2 has good thermal stability in thermal cycles and at the high temperature up to 500℃ and has a good potential for high-temperature thermal energy storage.

Abstract: Sb2Se3 is an emerging material among alternative light absorbers for photovoltaic applications. Unlike typical chalcogenides, Sb2Se3 is particularly appealing due to its single stable crystal phase, layered structure with loose binding of no dangling bonds. Nevertheless, a cost-effective electrochemical approach for the synthesis of Sb2Se3 compounds has not been identified, and the Sb2Se3 film with the most favorable [001] preferred orientation has only just been developed. In this study, Sb-rich precursors were prepared electrochemically at −950mV (vs. Ag/AgCl), and homogeneous Sb2Se3 thin films were produced using a pre-thermal treatment process prior to the typical selenization process with additional Se coating. This novel procedure notably suppresses potential Sb dissolution into liquid Se due to the formation of polycrystalline Sb-related crystals. As a result, the Sb-rich precursor was successfully transformed into Sb2Se3 thin films with an enhanced perpendicular orientation of the [001] direction. Unfortunately, a high density of voids was produced in the precursor film with two distinguishable layers, and their size increased after selenization. The voids were formed through evolution of H2Se gas after the initial electrochemical reaction. The resulting photovoltaic cells demonstrated an energy conversion efficiency of 1.8% in a substrate structure consisting of Mo/Sb2Se3/CdS/ZnO/ITO.

Abstract: Solar refractory selective absorber surfaces, such as TiN coatings, suffer from dust settlements, which become critically important in terms of the efficient operation of a solar receiver. In the present study, environmental dust characteristics and dust settlement on TiN coating surface are investigated. Water condensation on the dust particles in humid air ambient is simulated while mimicking the actual environmental water condensation. The size distribution of the dust particles is analyzed and the geometric features of the particles are assessed via introducing the shape factor and the aspect ratio. The tangential force required removing the dust particles and dry mud, which is formed from the dust particles and water condensate, from TiN coating surface is measured incorporating the micro-tribometer. It is found that the dust particles have various shapes and the sizes with the average size of the dust particles in the order of 1.2µm. Dust particles compose of various elements including alkaline and alkaline earth metals. The dissolution of alkaline and alkaline earth metal compounds in water condensate results in a liquid solution, which flows towards the coating surface under the gravitational force. The liquid solution does not form a continuous film at the interface of the dust particles and the coating surface because of the spreading coefficient. The liquid solution increases the tangential force required to remove the dry mud from the coating surface once it dries out.

Abstract: A series of alcohols (methanol, ethanol and isopropyl alcohol) were added to poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): (polystyrene sulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS) aqueous solutions in order to manipulate the molecular structure of the PEDOT chains in PEDOT: PSS hole transporting materials (HTMs) and thus to improve the power conversion efficiency of CH3NH3PbI3 based solar cells. The structural and electronic characteristics of the resultant PEDOT: PSS HTMs were analyzed using atomic-force microscopy, contact angle measurement, Raman scattering spectrometry and photoelectron spectrometry. The properties of the PEDOT: PSS thin films could be controlled by tuning the viscosity of the PEDOT: PSS solutions. High viscosity PEDOT: PSS solutions resulted in linear structured PEDOT chains, which increased the work function of the PEDOT: PSS HTMs thereby improving the open-circuit voltage of the CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells. The surface roughness and surface free energy of the PEDOT: PSS HTMs influence the structural properties of CH3NH3PbI3 thin films, which determines the exciton dissociation at the CH3NH3PbI3/PEDOT: PSS interface (short-circuit current density) and the carrier recombination at the CH3NH3PbI3/[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) interface (fill factor). In addition, it is predicted that the power conversion efficiency can be further improved by increasing the crystallinity of the CH3NH3PbI3 thin film.

Abstract: In this work, we report a comparative study of junction activation in the CdTe/CdS solar cells using MgCl2 and CdCl2 as the Cl sources. The chloride loading over the CdTe film was controlled by taking same molar solutions of both salts. Attention was given to explore the elemental profiles of S, O, Cl, Mg, and Cu across the CdTe as well as at the junction. Sulfur diffusion into the bulk of CdTe and evidence of alloying at the junction was prominent in the case of devices activated with CdCl2 as seen from SIMS and EQE data. The device parameters such as Voc, Jsc and FF were comparable or slightly higher for devices activated with MgCl2, which is explained as due to less recombination losses, lower series resistance and higher carrier concentration at the back contact region. The dispersion in efficiency values were smaller for devices activated with MgCl2 indicating that recrystallization of the CdTe film and junction activation in presence of MgCl2 results in better spatial uniformity compared to that with CdCl2. The devices used in this study were fabricated in an all-close-spaced-sublimation (CSS) process, where both CdS and CdTe were deposited by CSS.

Abstract: A multi-scaled structured solar selective absorber (SSA), combining micro-porous texture and ternary nano-composite (carbon-dielectric-metal), was prepared by a facile one-step method in the frame work of sol-gel process. The textured surface has a crater-like pattern ranging from 0.2 to 2μm, in which carbon-dielectric nano-composite serves as the thermal stable skeleton material to protect Cu and Cu2O particles embedded inside the matrix. Complementary structure has been demonstrated by theoretical modeling and optical characterization to enhance the optical absorptance of SSA coating. The results indicated that the one-layer SSA with a pore size of around 1.1µm presents an absorptance of about 0.8 and an emittance of about 0.08. Furthermore, the little deterioration after aging test for 50h (at 100°C in water vapor atmosphere and 500°C in vacuum) highlights an outstanding durability, implying that such multi-scaled structured film is low cost, easy to large-area product, and capable of being an excellent SSA for the low-middle temperature applications.

Abstract: Introducing K into Cu(In,Ga)(Se,S)2 (CIGS) absorbers has led to recent world record power conversion efficiencies for thin film polycrystalline solar cells. In this work, the diverse phenomena associated with K in CIGS were reviewed, and overarching mechanisms were identified. The effects of K depend on its distribution among grain interiors (GIs), grain boundaries (GBs), and interfaces. High substrate Na and low temperature favor GI K incorporation, while low Na and high temperature favor segregation of K at GBs. Depositing KInSe2 (or KIn1−yGaySe2) by co-evaporation or KF post-deposition treatment onto CIGS reduces buffer interface recombination in the final solar cells. KInSe2 decomposes in air, which makes characterization difficult and may affect performance. The mechanism for reduced interface recombination could be direct passivation, beneficial compound precursor, oxidation barrier, or favorable diffusion alteration.

Abstract: This report signifies the synthesis of TiO2 nanorods (TNR ~79nm) and nanospheres (TNS ~19nm) and their Ag loaded counterparts AgTNR and AgTNS for the photocatalytic hydrogen production from water under monochromatic visible and direct sunlight. The Ag-TNR nanohybrid junction was sensitized at a matching monochromatic wavelength of 457nm and sunlight to produce ~90 µmol and 105 µmol of gas, respectively, increase in the efficiency is explained due to the surface plasmon (SPR) effect of Ag nanoparticles and is also correlated to fluorescence quenching (due to better charge distribution along larger nano-interface), crystal structure and surface area (146m2g−1) of fabricated AgTNR nanocomposite. The elongated morphology of AgTNR led to the effective distribution of charge along larger interface resulting in the increase of photocurrent density (0.01mA/cm2) which boosts the reaction rate. Plasmonic metal (Ag) activated with matching wavelength to SPR produces an electric field and the TiO2 present in the proximity encounters these effects results in the formation of Schottky barrier, the SPR effect is also more towards Ag-TiO2 interface which results in the ejection of electron towards the conduction band of TNR. This study demonstrated that Ag nanoparticles loaded lengthy TiO2 nanorods (~79nm) exhibited highly improved H2 production (90 μmol) from water relative to TiO2 nanospheres (~19nm) due to the plasmonic effect at 457nm light irradiation that also exhibited better H2 production (105 μmol) rate under direct sun light (8h) exposure.

Abstract: In this research novel microcomposites composed of phase change materials (PCMs) and xonotlite were fabricated and characterized. Xonotlite mineral and its composites have wide application areas in building materials industry due to their thermo-insulating properties. Lauric acid, decanoic acid and paraffin were used as phase change materials. Xonotlite was prepared as composite matrix. In order to analyse the composite structure and thermal performance of microcomposites, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used. The experimental results demonstrate that paraffin/xonotlite composites were synthesized successfully and paraffin was the most suitable phase change material for preparation of phase change material/xonotlite composites. However, this study emphasized the correct choice of PCM that will be used in xonotlite including composites. Fatty acids have dissolution effect on xonotlite matrix. The melting and freezing temperatures were measured through differential scanning calorimetry analysis and found to be 35.05 and 40.42°C, respectively. The melting and crystallization heats were determined to be 65.8 and −63.5kJ/kg. We recommended that the fabricated nanocomposite-PCMs offer proper phase transition temperature range heat enthalpy values for thermal energy storage applications.

Abstract: As a remarkable wide band-gap n-type semiconductor, TiO2 has been widely used as electron selective layer in photovoltaic devices. In this work, TiO2 films with different crystallinity were deposited on FTO glass by DC magnetron sputtering at room temperature. The crystallinity of these films were controlled by precisely adjusting the sputtering power and work pressure. Taking advantages of high visible light transmittance, reduced transport resistance and effective TiO2/perovskite interface with fast electron extraction and carrier separation, high efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSCs) were assembled. The optimum crystallinity of TiO2 compact layer for PSC was defined as 26.3%. Short-circuit current density and fill factor were notably enhanced and power conversion efficiency of the device was improved to 15.76% compared with PSCs based on amorphous (13.3%) and fully crystallized TiO2 (12.9%). This research shaded light on the choice of inorganic carrier transport layers in photovoltaic devices.

Abstract: Due to the intermittency of solar radiation, the integration of a thermal energy storage system is a key solution to ensure the dispatchability and enhance the cost-effectiveness of concentrated solar power plants (CSP). Recently, the use of rocks as sensible heat storage materials in packed bed systems has been the main object of several research studies. Nevertheless, limited knowledge is available on the thermal behavior of rocks at high temperatures and their suitability is yet to be deeply studied. The present paper aims to investigate the potential of quartzite and flint rocks to be used as filler materials in a packed bed storage system with air as the heat transfer fluid (HTF). These siliceous rocks have been subjected to an experimental characterization in terms of the properties required in a sensible heat storage material. In fact, the geochemistry and structure of these rocks were identified and some mechanical characteristics were measured. The influence of temperature variation on thermal capacity, thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity was also analyzed. Besides, thermogravimetric analysis was performed up to 1000°C, in order to check the thermal stability of rocks. In addition, 110 thermal cycles were achieved in a furnace up to 550°C. Characterization experiments demonstrated the potential of silica rocks as storage materials. However, the preliminary results of accelerated thermal cycling tests indicate that performing a thermal treatment of these rocks could be of great interest, especially when used at temperatures higher than 250°C, in order to enhance their lifetime.

Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much attention due to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and low cost fabrication. Since the PCE is critically related to the perovskite crystal morphology and quality, controlling the perovskite crystal formation is becoming more important. In this work, we chose PDDA polyelectrolyte as the crystal capping agent to modulate the perovskite thin film formation. The PDDA capping agent significantly enhanced the short-circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) of the corresponding PSCs, which produced an optimal PCE of 14.1% compared to 12.5% of control device without the modifying agent. The effect of PDDA agent is examined by various techniques. It was found that improved surface morphology, enhanced crystallinity, and decreased grain boundary related defects are contributed to the performance and stability enhancement.

Abstract: Purpose
Studies associate specific fatty-acids (FA) with the pathophysiology of inflammation. We aimed to analyze the impact of exercise on adipose tissue FA profile in response to a high-fat diet (HFD) and to ascertain whether these exercise-induced changes in specific FA have repercussions on obesity-related inflammation.
Methods
Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned into sedentary, voluntary physical-activity (VPA) and endurance training (ET) groups fed a standard (S, 35kcal% fat) or high-fat (71kcal% fat) diets. VPA-animals had unrestricted access to wheel-running. After 9-wks, ET-animals engaged a running protocol for 8-wks, while maintained dietary treatments. The FA content in epididymal white-adipose tissue (eWAT) triglycerides was analyzed by gas-chromatography and the expression of inflammatory markers was determined using RT-qPCR, Western and slot blotting.
Results
Eight-wks of ET reversed obesity-related anatomical features. HFD increased plasma tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α content and eWAT monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 protein expression. HFD decreased eWAT content of saturated FA and monounsaturated FA, while increased linoleic acid and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels in eWAT. VPA decreased visceral adiposity, adipocyte size and MCP-1 in HFD-fed animals. The VPA and ET interventions diminished palmitoleic acid and increased linoleic acid in HFD-fed groups. Moreover, both interventions increased PGE2 levels in standard diet-fed groups and decreased in HFD. ET increased eWAT fatty acid desaturase 1 (FADS1) and elongase 5 (ELOVL5) protein content in both diet types. ET reduced eWAT inflammatory markers (TNF-α, IL-6), macrophage recruitment (MCP-1 and F4/80) and increased IL-10/TNF-α ratio in plasma and in eWAT in both diet types.
Conclusions
Exercise induced FA-specific changes independently of dietary FA composition, but only ET attenuated the inflammatory response in VAT of HFD-fed rats. Moreover, the exercise-induced FA changes did not correlate with the inflammatory response in VAT of rats submitted to HFD.

Abstract: In this work, antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) thin films were prepared by co-evaporation of Sb2Se3 and selenium (Se) sources on molybdenum (Mo)-coated soda lime glass. Solar cells were fabricated in the substrate configuration of Ag/ITO/ZnO/CdS/Sb2Se3/Mo/Glass. The [hk1] preferred orientation grain was found to be beneficial to higher performance solar cells because of its special one-dimensional crystal structure. Furthermore, a Mo selenization process prior to the Sb2Se3 deposition was introduced to improve the Sb2Se3/Mo interface. Material characterization and device physics analysis revealed that the formation of MoSe2 due to the Mo selenization enhanced the [221] orientation preference of the following Sb2Se3 and improved the quality of heterojunction, leading to a significant increase in open circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF). The champion solar cell showed a conversion efficiency of 4.25% with a VOC of 427mV and a FF of 58.15%.

Abstract: We demonstrate enhanced performance of solution-processed photodetectors composed of all-inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite films with ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) decoration. Introducing ZnO NPs into CsPbBr3 precursor solution results in the film with more uniformly and compactly distributed crystalline grains. ZnO NPs can also promote the transport of photon-generated carriers from the central CsPbBr3 absorption layer to the lateral electrodes. Meanwhile, the asymmetry electrodes, i.e., indium tin oxide and silver, of the photodetectors create a built-in electric field driving the photodetectors operation without external bias voltage. Compared to the photodetectors without ZnO decoration, the fabricated all-inorganic CsPbBr3:ZnO photodetectors achieve a comparable rise time of 0.409s, a fall time of 17.92ms, and an on/off ratio of 12.86 without external bias source.

Abstract: Photochromic oxygen-containing yttrium hydride (YHO) thin films with switchable optical properties have recently emerged as a promising material for the utilization in smart windows and sensor applications. In the present study, we have prepared YHO thin films with a lateral gradient of oxygen and hydrogen concentrations, which allows us to systematically investigate the effect of changes in chemical composition on their optical properties. We show that when the average lateral oxygen content exceeded a threshold level at a certain location in the as-deposited film, its appearance was abruptly changed from black opaque to yellow transparent, in which only yellow YHO exhibited photochromism. Moreover, we show that a small region (typically ∼5–10mm lateral size) in the black opaque part of the as-deposited film, located adjacent to the yellow transparent part of the film, was observed to transform permanently to yellow transparent upon exposure to oxygen in air in the dark for several weeks. The black to yellow color transformation was caused by an increase in the oxygen concentration, originating from the oxidation process. Optical characterization revealed pronounced photochromic response in the transformed region as compared to the rest of the yellow film. This finding demonstrates that the switchable optical properties can be tailored by changing the chemical composition of YHO films.

Abstract: Phase change materials (PCMs) which possess high thermal conductivity and excellent mechanical property have been prepared in this work according to a dual-level packaging technology. Porous graphite foam with bulk density of 0.25g/cm3 which is derived from worm-like expanded graphite is infiltrated by liquid paraffin. The as-infiltrated graphite foam is ball milled into small spheres with diameter of 1–3mm. Then the spheres are sprayed with a pre-polymer composed of epoxy resin and its curing agent. These spheres are finally hot-pressing at 30°C for 6h under 1MPa to obtain the PCMs. Correspondingly, porous graphite works as the first-level packaging (core) while epoxy resin film acts as the second-level packaging (shell) of paraffin. The thermal conductivity of PCM composites reach to 4.98W/mK. Meanwhile, the compressive strength of PCM composites keeps a very stable value of 19.50MPa when temperature increases from 25 to 90°C. The excellent shape-stability of PCM is attributed to its dual-level packaging structure in which porous graphite prevents the leaking of liquid paraffin from the core and epoxy resin provides a strong polymer network at high temperature.

Abstract: 1D Nanowire CH3NH3PbI3 thin films have been successfully constructed by solvent etching technique. The etching solution was consisted of a small amount of polar solvent in non-polar solvent, and the roughness of the film can be precisely controlled by the adding amount of polar solvent. A best and repeatable PCE of 17.62% was achieved from the CH3NH3PbI3-based solar cells device with nanowire film morphology and p-i-n structure. Solvent etching process was an advanced technique for perovskite nanowire construction because of it's simple, universal and effective operation.

Abstract: Objective/background
Nontransfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (NTDβT) syndromes consist of β-thalassemia intermedia and moderate hemoglobin E/β thalassemias. They are characterized by varying degrees of chronic anemia and a wide spectrum of complications due to ineffective erythropoiesis and iron overload from chronic transfusions. Hydroxyurea (HU), an oral chemotherapeutic drug, is anticipated to decrease disease severity.
Methods
We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of HU in NTDβT patients of any age. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane databases, and major conference proceedings for studies that assessed HU in NTDβT patients were searched. Qualities of eligible studies were assessed by National Institutes of Health tools.
Results
Seventeen studies, collectively involving 709 patients, fulfilled the eligibility criteria. HU was associated with a significant decrease in transfusion need in severe NTDβT with complete and overall (≥50%) response rates of 42% and 79%, respectively. For mild NTDβT, HU was effective in raising hemoglobin by 1g/L in 64% of patients.
Conclusion
HU appears to be effective, well tolerated, and associated with mild and transient adverse events. NTDβT patients may benefit from a trial of HU, although large randomized clinical trials assessing its efficacy should be conducted to confirm the findings of this meta-analysis and to assess its long-term toxicity and response sustainability.

Abstract: Thin perovskite layers are crucial for fabricating semitransparent perovskite solar cells and tandem devices. However, this will reduce the light absorption of the device, resulting in low efficiency. To overcome this dilemma, we use textured fluorine doped SnO2 (FTO) substrates to trap light and enhance light absorption in thin perovskite solar cells. Both optical simulation and experimental demonstration show the successful application of this new strategy in enhancing the efficiency. In the meantime, the transmittance of the full cell beyond the perovskite absorption range is not sacrificed, which is pivotal for fabricating semitransparent perovskite solar cells and tandem devices.

Abstract: This paper details an innovative recycling process to recover silicon (Si) wafer from solar panels. Using these recycled wafers, we fabricated Pb-free solar panels. The first step to recover Si wafer is to dissolve silver (Ag) and aluminium (Al) via nitric acid (HNO3) and potassium hydroxide (KOH), respectively. The next step is to remove anti-reflection coating (ARC) and emitter on the surface by using an etching paste which contains phosphoric acid (H3PO4). Wafers onto which the etching paste was applied were heated for 2min at 320, 340, 360, 380, and 400°C. The recycled wafers showed properties with the thickness of over 180µm, resistivity of 0.5–4Ωcm, which are almost identical to those of commercial virgin wafers. Furthermore, the solar cells manufactured with the recycled wafers showed an efficiency equivalent to that of the virgin cells. Pb-free solar panels were fabricated with the solar cells by using 60Sn-38Bi-2Ag solder to assemble the solar panels. Thermal cycling test based on the standard IEC 61215 were performed on the solar panels in order to confirm their stability.

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel technological approach to form highly boron-doped selective emitters. The selective emitters are formed by using a Laser Induced Forward Transfer Doping (DLIFT) process, which allows precise adjustment of the doping profile by tuning the laser parameters and choosing an appropriate doping source. Surface dopant concentrations of up to Ns≈1×1021cm−3 were achieved by using DLIFT. Subsequent BBr3 tube furnace diffusion was performed to form a low surface concentration (Ns≈1×1019cm−3) homogeneous emitter. In comparison to the conventionally applied BBr3 tube diffusion, an increase in open circuit voltage of up to 6mV is predicted based on the photoluminescence measurements performed after passivation, screen-printing and firing processes. Simulations suggest that this voltage gain is most possibly due to a lower emitter saturation current density (j0e) of the highly doped DLIFT samples compared to the BBr3 diffusion samples. Moreover, it is observed that the laser-induced defects are reduced successfully after a subsequent boron tribromide (BBr3) tube diffusion, which is used to form the homogeneous emitter after the DLIFT process. The micro Raman spectroscopy results indicated that the compressive stress of −200MPa in the silicon crystal lattice after DLIFT process is released by the subsequent BBr3 tube diffusion. These results demonstrate that the DLIFT process in combination with the conventionally applied BBr3 tube diffusion can be an effective approach to form selective boron emitters in high efficiency n-type crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells.

Abstract: Anatase TiO2 microspheres with smooth and fibrous morphology (SμS and FμS) resembling laddu and dandelion are synthesized by solvothermal and hydrothermal methods, respectively. A detailed analysis of these two microstructures using XRD, UV–vis spectroscopy, electron microscopy and surface area measurement techniques are presented. Photoanodes fabricated using these microspheres and their composites with nanoparticles (Degussa P25) are tested for photovoltaic (PV) performance using a standard Grätzel-type dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) configuration. The DSSC made up of SμS and FμS microspheres exhibit an efficiency (η) of 8.4% and 6.4% respectively, in comparison to η≈7.1% for nanoparticulate P25. Further enhancement in η is realized in the composite photoanode films made of porous SμS/FμS microspheres filled with nanoparticulate P25 TiO2. High power conversion efficiency of 8.9% (for cell area of 0.5cm2 and thickness of ~25µm) was achieved in composite photoanode film consisting of 80wt% SμS and 20wt% P25. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies reveal a low interfacial resistance in composite photoanodes, which is desired for efficient electron generation and transport. Composite microspheres filled with P25 nanoparticles in their voids show enhanced efficiency than the mesoporous TiO2 microspheres. Thus, SμS-nanoparticle composite TiO2 film possesses essential attributes necessary for an efficient photoanode viz. large surface area for dye adsorption, good connectivity between nanocrystallites for the efficient electron transport, and higher scattering properties for better light harvesting efficiency.

Abstract: The α-mannosidase activity in human frontal gyrus, cerebrospinal fluid and plasma has been analyzed by DEAE-cellulose chromatography to investigate the origin of the α-mannosidase activity in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The profile of α-mannosidase isoenzymes obtained in CSF was similar to that in the frontal gyrus but different from that in human plasma. In particular the two characteristic peaks of lysosomal α-mannosidase, A and B, which have a pH-optimum of 4.5 and are found in human tissues, were present in both the frontal gyrus and CSF. In contrast the majority of α-mannosidase activity in human plasma was due to the so called intermediate form, which has a pH-optimum of 5.5. The results suggest that the intermediate form of α-mannosidase in plasma does not cross the blood–brain barrier and that the α-mannosidase activity present in the cerebrospinal fluid is of lysosomal type and of brain origin. Thus the α-mannosidase activity in cerebrospinal fluid might mirror the brain pathological changes linked to neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease.

Abstract: We achieved an inverted pyramid structure, meeting the tradeoff between the light reflection minimization and carrier recombination by adjusting the one-step Cu-assisted texturization of silicon wafer, and silicon solar cells based on this structure were fabricated, which gained a high conversion efficiency of 18.87% without using any complex techniques. These data were compared with the performance of conventional upright pyramid silicon solar cells as manufactured using identical raw wafers, the Cu-etched inverted pyramid silicon cells collected 0.59mA/cm2 more short-circuit current density and 0.47% more efficiency. Importantly, our data demonstrate the better performance and manufacturability of inverted pyramid structured silicon solar cell and as such may open new perspectives for high efficiency solar cell applications.

Abstract: It is compelling to eliminate inactive phosphorus in industrial POCl3 diffused emitters for high efficiency silicon solar cells. Several approaches were reported to significantly reduce inactive phosphorus in the literature. However, the underlying physical mechanisms are not fully understood. In this work, we conduct a systematic investigation and fabricate eight emitters involving two POCl3:O2 ratios at pre-deposition and both inert and oxidising scenarios at drive-in. Characterization techniques such as secondary ion mass spectrometry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy are carried out with an emphasis on the phosphosilicate glass. To provide a consistent interpretation of our results and those in the literature, we suggest a probable reaction, “free phosphorus oxidation”, as the dominant mechanism to unveil the role and impact of oxygen during POCl3 diffusion. We further propose that various industrial POCl3 emitters can be fabricated inactive phosphorus free without drive-in or a pre-grown oxide. Among the eight emitters, three emitters are free from inactive phosphorus with a sheet resistance range from 65 to 140Ω/□, featuring a surface doping from 1 × 1020 to 3 × 1020cm−3 and a remarkably low emitter saturation current density down to 51fA/cm2.

Methylglyoxal upregulates Dictyostelium discoideum slug migration by triggering glutathione reductase and methylglyoxal reductase activity,

Abstract: Glutathione (GSH)-deprived Dictyostelium discoideum accumulates methylglyoxal (MG) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) during vegetative growth. However, the reciprocal effects of the production and regulation of these metabolites on differentiation and cell motility are unclear. Based on the inhibitory effects of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gcsA) disruption and GSH reductase (gsr) overexpression on aggregation and culmination, respectively, we overexpressed GSH-related genes encoding superoxide dismutase (Sod2), catalase (CatA), and Gcs, in D. discoideum. Wild-type KAx3 and gcsA-overexpressing (gcsAOE) slugs maintained GSH levels at levels of approximately 2.1-fold less than the reference GSH synthetase-overexpressing mutant; their GSH levels did not correlate with slug migration ability. Through prolonged KAx3 migration by treatment with MG and H2O2, we found that MG increased after the mound stage in this strain, with a 2.6-fold increase compared to early developmental stages; in contrast, ROS were maintained at high levels throughout development. While the migration-defective sod2- and catA-overexpressing mutant slugs (sod2OE and catAOE) decreased ROS levels by 50% and 53%, respectively, these slugs showed moderately decreased MG levels (36.2±5.8 and 40.7±1.6nmolg−1 cells wet weight, P<0.05) compared to the parental strain (54.2±3.5nmolg−1). Importantly, defects in the migration of gcsAOE slugs decreased MG considerably (13.8±4.2nmolg−1, P<0.01) along with a slight decrease in ROS. In contrast to the increase observed in migrating sod2OE and catAOE slugs by treatment with MG and H2O2, the migration of gcsAOE slugs appeared unaffected. This behavior was caused by MG-triggered Gsr and NADPH-linked aldolase reductase activity, suggesting that GSH biosynthesis in gcsAOE slugs is specifically used for MG-scavenging activity. This is the first report showing that MG upregulates slug migration via MG-scavenging-mediated differentiation.

Abstract: This paper signifies that the bimetallic (BM) coinage metal NCs deposited on TiO2 possess the ability to absorb visible light in a wide wavelength range and are also expected to display the new properties due to synergy between two distinct metals. As a result, they reveal highest level of activity than the monometallics deposited on TiO2. In this respect, the core@shell (Cu@Ag), inverse core@shell (Ag@Cu) BM NCs and their monometallics modified TiO2 have been relatively investigated for the optical absorption, emission, charge carrier dynamics, surface structural morphology and photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation. A significant blue-shift in the SP band of Cu@Ag and a red-shift in Ag@Cu with notable color change were observed due to their composition change and morphology. Further, the TEM analysis also revealed the formation of eccentric core-shell Cu@Ag and uniform core@shell Ag@Cu BM NCs which were deposited on TiO2, evidenced by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, EDX, photoluminescence and time resolved spectroscopy. The visible light irradiation on core@shell BM-TiO2 promoted ~ 3 times higher reduction of 3-nitroacetophenone and 1-chloro-3-nitrobenzene and ~2 times higher degradation of salicylic acid as compared to monometallic-TiO2. This can be attributed to the decrease in work function of resulting Cu-Ag BM NCs (ca. 3.8–4.6eV) relative to their individual particles (4.3–5.3eV) that lower the height of Schottky barrier created at the core@shell BM-TiO2 heterojunction. As a result, this led to the efficient electron transfer from the BM NCs to TiO2, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic activity than the monometallic-TiO2.

Abstract: Dispersion stability has been long considered as a critical issue for applying nanofluids in various fields, especially for the applications at elevated temperatures. Herein a novel route is explored to improve the dispersion stability of graphene (GE)/ionic liquid (IL) nanofluids for use as working fluids in medium- and high-temperature direct absorption solar collectors (DASCs), which involves modifying GE according to the molecular structure of the IL. Specifically, GE was modified using the reagents and process for synthesizing [HMIM]BF4, followed by dispersing the modified GE (MGE) into [HMIM]BF4. It is verified that the molecular chains similar to [HMIM]BF4 have been grafted on the nanosheets of GE, and the MGE/[HMIM]BF4 nanofluids exhibit much better dispersion stability than the one containing the unmodified GE, even at elevated temperatures. Moreover, the temperature profiles of the nanofluids containing MGE and GE were obtained both from the experimental measurement and the theoretical prediction using a one-dimensional transient heat transfer model. It is shown that the experimental data are in good agreement with the numerical ones for the MGE nanofluids, while a large deviation between them is found for the one containing the unmodified GE. And the MGE nanofluid shows enhanced receiver efficiency as compared to the GE one due to its much improved dispersion stability. Further, the transient model was used to predict the performance of the MGE nanofluid based DASCs under high solar concentrations. And by integrating the MGE concentration and the receiver height into a parameter, namely optical thickness, the optimization of the MGE nanofluid based DASC was carried out varying solar concentration, MGE concentration, nanofluid height and exposure time. It is revealed that the photo-thermal conversion performance of nanofluids greatly depends on its dispersion stability at elevated temperatures, and the MGE/[HMIM]BF4 nanofluids possess excellent dispersion stability and show great potentials for use as the working fluids in DASCs. This work sheds light on effective routes for improving dispersion stability of nanofluids as well as numerical investigations on nanofluid based DASCs.

Abstract: Herein a novel process was explored for preparing molten salt/expanded graphite (EG) composite phase change material (PCM) blocks, which involves mixing a solid molten salt with EG thoroughly, compressing the mixture into a block with a designed shape and then heating the block to a temperature above the melting point of the molten salt followed by cooling. An MgCl2-KCl eutectic salt was used as the PCM, and its EG-based composite PCM block was prepared by this process, in which the optimal mass fraction of the eutectic was determined to be around 85%. The microstructure of the MgCl2-KCl/EG composite PCM block containing 85% the eutectic shows a uniform distribution of the molten salt. The composite PCM block has a melting point of 424.14°C and a solidification point of 418.39°C, and its latent heat values are 161.37J/g for melting and 160.28J/g for solidification. Compared with the eutectic salt, the composite PCM block exhibits a reduction in supercooling by 3.7°C and an enhancement in thermal conductivity by 11-fold. It has been verified that the composite PCM block possesses excellent thermal reliability. Furthermore, the composite PCM block has been compared with the one prepared by the conventional method (first adsorption and then compression). It is found that the composite PCM block fabricated by the novel process exhibits better uniformity and smaller volume expansion than the one obtained from the conventional method. The MgCl2-KCl/EG composite block shows great promise in high-temperature thermal energy storage systems, and this novel process is very suitable for preparing molten salt/EG composite PCM blocks.

Abstract: Plasmonics are applied to concentrate light at the nanoscale and are integrated into photothermal technologies to improve solar energy absorption. Here, we report a one-step synthetic route of super broadband Ag@TiO2 core–shell nanoparticles under well-defined conditions using silver nitrate (AgNO3) and titanium butoxide (TBT) in N,N-dimethylformamide as raw materials and hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (CTAC) as both an inducer and a protective agent. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the prepared nanoparticles have well-defined core–shell structures. The intermediates and final product were further characterized by UV–vis absorption, which showed that the synthesized Ag@TiO2 core–shell nanoparticles exhibit super broadband absorbance in the visible light range, and the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak can be systematically tuned between 414 and 499nm. In addition, X-ray diffraction and energy-dispersive spectroscopy confirmed the compositions of the nanoparticles. The nanoparticles prepared under well-defined conditions, i.e., a TBT:AgNO3 molar ratio of 3:1, CTAC concentration of 0.6mM, temperature of 80°C, and reaction time of 70min, show an SPR peak at 474nm, which is close to the maximum solar irradiation intensity and has great potential for promoting solar energy conversion.

Abstract: The photoelectrochromic (PEC) device, a combination of a dye solar cell and an electrochromic film, can be used for the dynamic solar control of buildings under illumination or with an external voltage. Typically, titanium oxide (TiO2) and tungsten oxide (WO3) films are being prepared from colloids or sol-gel chemistry with high porosity and high surface area as functional layers for a photoelectrochromic device in lab scale. We have, for the first time, successfully developed a PEC device with conventionally sputter deposited TiO2 and WO3 films. This coating technique is attractive due to the well documented upscaling capability and industrial viability for window applications. The functional layers WO3 and TiO2 were deposited onto fluorine doped oxide (F:SnO2) coated glass . Characterization of WO3 and TiO2 was performed in an electrochromic cell and in a dye solar cell, respectively. Three types of PEC devices with different layer configuration were constructed and their performance based on visual transmissions was compared. In best case, the visual transmission could be switched from 61 down to 15% in 30min under 1.5 A.M. illumination.

Abstract: Thin film photovoltaic Cu2ZnSnS4 (copper zinc tin sulfide or CZTS) is one of the most promising sustainable solar cell absorber material. The CZTS absorber layer containing earth-abundant materials such as copper, zinc, tin and sulfur can be an alternative to existing materials for thin film solar cells. Recently, there has been an increased interest to step-up the efficiency and step-down the manufacturing cost of CZTS-based solar cells. This review critically addresses the advantages and challenges associated with sputter-deposited CZTS solar cells, since sputtering is an industry compatible and relatively low-cost vacuum deposition technique. Various approaches to fabricate CZTS thin films by sputtering are discussed. In addition, the single target quaternary CZTS sputtering technique has been discussed in detail. Current state-of-the art device architectures and methods to improve the quality of interfaces are discussed. This review is intended to highlight current trends and challenges in the field to realize the opportunity of CZTS thin film solar cells for large scale application.

Abstract: Quaternary Zn1-xCdxTe1-yOy (ZnCdTeO) alloys with Cd and O contents of x<~0.7 and y<~0.03, respectively, were grown on ZnTe substrates by molecular beam epitaxy. Structural x-ray diffraction measurements indicate that the degree of the lattice distortion strongly depends on the alloy composition. Lattice relaxation is observed in the 400nm-thick ZnCdTeO layer with a lattice mismatch of more than 1.5%. The optical absorption of ZnCdTeO strongly depends on the alloy composition and the spectral dependence of the absorption coefficient is well described by the electronic band structure resulting from anticrossing interaction between localized O level and the conduction band of Zn1-xCdxTe matrix. Measurements of the photovoltaic performance of two intermediate band solar cell structures indicate an importance of the conduction band alignment and the location of the intermediate band relative to the upper conduction band.

Abstract: Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) is involved in the catabolism of many ligands, including factor VIII (FVIII) and alpha-2-macroglobulin (α2M). Transfer of FVIII to LRP1 is currently believed to be preceded by pre-concentration on the cell surface, by interacting with a so far unidentified component. In the present study, we used confocal microscopy and flow cytometry to compare endocytosis of FVIII and α2M using U87MG cells. The results show that α2M is rapidly internalized and does not compete for LRP1 mediated internalization of FVIII. FVIII endocytosis did not occur in the presence of receptor-associated-protein (RAP), but FVIII remained visible as a striated fluorescent pattern at the cell borders. In the presence of Von Willebrand Factor (VWF), no FVIII was observed on or within the cells, suggesting that VWF blocks interaction with both cell surface and LRP1. The same dual inhibition has previously been observed for FVIII C1 domain directed monoclonal antibody KM33. Elimination of the KM33 epitope by replacing FVIII C1 residues 2091–2095 and 2155–2160 for the homologues from factor V (FV), however, did not impair FVIII endocytosis. These membrane spikes alone were insufficient for cellular uptake, because FV was neither internalized by U87MG cells nor capable of effectively competing for FVIII endocytosis. These results show that FVIII endocytosis is driven by interaction with LRP1, but at the same time involves the spikes in the C1 domain that have been implicated in lipid binding.

Abstract: Effectively harvesting light to generate long-lived charge carriers to suppress the recombination of electrons and holes is crucial for photocatalytic reactions. Constructing the heterostructure and exposing the highly active facets have been regarded as powerful approaches to high-performance photocatalysts. In this paper, a three-dimensional (3D) double-heterostructured photocatalyst was constructed by connecting a TiO2-MoS2 core-shell nanosheets (NSs) assembled on a graphite fiber (GF@MoS2-TiO2) via a facile two-step hydrothermal method. The highly active {001} facets of TiO2 NSs vertically grown on the GFs and uniformly ultrathin MoS2 NSs on the surface of TiO2 NSs (rich in active edge sites) afford high-efficiency photogeneration of electron-hole pairs under UV and visible light. Meanwhile, the carrier separation is substantially promoted by the Ohmic contact between TiO2 NSs and the efficiently channeling electrons of zero-bandgap GFs, and the two-dimensional (2D) nanojunction with intimate and large contact interface between TiO2 NSs and MoS2 NSs. The improved charge separation and exposed active facets dramatically boost the photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange dye.

Abstract: A spin-coating-free fabrication sequence has been developed for the fabrication of highly efficient organic-inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs). A novel blow-drying method is demonstrated to be successful in depositing high quality mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2), methylammonium lead halide (CH3NH3PbI3) perovskite and spiro-MeOTAD layers. When combined with compact TiO2 (c-TiO2) deposited by spray pyrolysis which is also a spin-coating-free process, a stabilized power conversion efficiency exceeding 17% can be achieved for the glass/FTO/c-TiO2/mp-TiO2/ CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-MeOTAD/Au device. This is the highest efficiency for PSCs fabricated without the use of spin-coating to our knowledge. This method provides a pathway towards a scalable process for fabricating high-performance, large area and reproducible PSCs.

Abstract: The role of CD36 in oxidised low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) mediated cell death was examined by down regulating the receptor level with the macrophage generated antioxidant 7,8‐dihydroneopterin. Down regulation of CD36 protein levels in human monocyte derived macrophages by 7,8-dihydroneopterin corresponded to a decrease in CD36-mRNA. The oxidation products of 7,8-dihydroneopterin, dihydroxanthopterin and neopterin did not significantly down regulate CD36. The CD36 down regulation resulted in a decrease in oxLDL uptake measured as 7-ketocholesterol accumulation. Though less oxLDL was taken up by the macrophages as a result of the 7,8-dihydroneopterin induced down regulation in CD36 levels, the cytotoxicity of the oxLDL was not decreased. Addition of 7,8-dihydroneopterin to oxLDL treated macrophages decreased the concentration of intracellular oxidants. In the presence of oxLDL, 7,8-dihydroneopterin was oxidised to neopterin showing that the 7,8-dihydroneopterin was scavenging intracellular oxidants generated in response to the oxLDL. The results show CD36 down regulation does not protect human macrophages form oxLDL cytotoxicity but 7,8-dihydroneopterin intracellular oxidant scavenging is protective.

Abstract: Sb2Se3 possesses great potential for low-cost photovoltaics due to its excellent optoelectronic properties. CdS was typically used as electron collection layer due to high electron affinity, relatively high electron mobility, and environmental stability. However, the toxicity was a big issue restricting its development. Here we fabricate ZnO films by magnetron sputtering to replace the toxic CdS layer for non-toxic ZnO/Sb2Se3 heterojunction solar cells. It was found that the annealing atmosphere (ambient air or vacuum) played a significant role for the device performance. We found that post-annealing increased the crystallinity of ZnO to some extent. Ambient air annealing reduced the oxygen vacancies in ZnO and vacuum annealing increased oxygen vacancies. The reduced oxygen vacancies in ZnO resulted in an improved p-n junction between ZnO and Sb2Se3 and better device performance. The power conversion efficiency of ZnO/Sb2Se3 solar cell with ZnO film annealed in ambient air reached 4.08%.

Abstract: A novel laminated electrochromic device (ECD) with a chemically synthesized ion conducting-poly (vinyl butyral) (CSIC-PVB) electrolyte is demonstrated. The anodically coloring material and the cathodically coloring material of the device are Prussian blue (PB) and poly (3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) thin films, respectively. From the view of the structure, a laminated electrochromic glazing demands solid polymer electrolyte with both excellent sealing and ionic conductivity properties. The ionic conductivities of the CSIC-PVB films vary in the order of 10−3 down to 10−6S/cm, whereas the adhesion strengths of these ion conducting PVB interlayers change from 3 to 11N/mm2. The ionic conductivity and the adhesion of the CSIC-PVB films are proportional to the amount of ionic segments incorporated into the polymer backbone. This PB/CSIC-PVB/PEDOT laminated ECD has an optimal absorbance change at 620nm. The ECD provides a 39.8% transmittance change (ΔT) at the potential range between 1.0 V and − 1.1V (PEDOT vs. PB), with a bleaching time of 1.2s and a darkening time of 1.5s. And the coloration efficiency at 620nm of the device is calculated to be 270.8cm2/C.

Abstract: A reflective cavity with elliptical cross-section is proposed to couple a burner to three arrays of thermophotovoltaic (TPV) cells. Burner and photoconverter, with triangular section, are located near the two foci of the ellipse. The elliptical cavity is designed to be inserted into a thermo-electric micro-cogenerator for residential use, which exploits the TPV cells to convert visible and infrared radiation generated by the burner into electricity. Taking into account the key construction constraints, several cavity configurations, which differ for components or optical properties, are analysed by ray tracing simulations. The maximum radiation collection efficiency is 62% for the elliptical cavity and is reduced to 48% by introducing quartz protections around the burner and the receiver. A germanium-based photoconverter is developed and manufactured by metalorganic chemical vapour deposition techniques. Each photoconverter can deliver 180mW/cm2 (at 230mV voltage and 55°C) when illuminated by a blackbody spectrum at 1473K. The manufacture of the TPV receiver is described and the thermal design aspects are considered. The use of a dichroic filter for a TPV generator configuration based on an elliptical chamber is also evaluated.

Abstract: Solution-processed small molecule-fullerene bulk heterojunction (SM BHJ) solar cells now have power conversion efficiency (PCE) greater than 10%. However, degradation of SM BHJ solar cells has not been well studied. This work reports the first stability study of six high performance molecules including the record SM BHJ solar cells under device operating conditions. Solar cells with a range of donor molecular weight from 1200 to 2300Da giving 6–10% PCE are monitored in nitrogen gas under 1 sun illumination with maximum power point tracking as well as at 25°C and 70°C in the dark. Both heat and light contribute to initial exponential decay or burn-in with total reduction in efficiency from 31% to 66%. Larger molecules are found to be resistant to heat induced burn-in, while more crystalline active layers are more resistant to light induced burn-in. After burn-in, the linear degradation is observed to be governed by thermal processes. Stabilized TS80 lifetimes of the SM BHJ solar cells range from 3450h to 5600h. Molecular design towards higher stability should aim at increasing thermal stability while maintaining crystallinity for photostability.

Abstract: The use of paraffin, salts and salt hydrates as phase change materials (PCMs) have been researched extensively and used in a number of commercial applications. However, metals and metal alloys, which possess a high storage density on a volume basis as well as a substantially higher thermal conductivity, has received much less attention. This paper discusses the considerations for the use of metal and metal alloys as phase change materials for high temperature thermal storage applications, as well as summarises the literature on the limited research in this area. Although some pure metals and metal alloys present interesting thermal properties to be used as PCMs in thermal storage systems, there is a lack of understanding on the implications of the metallurgical aspects related to the melting and solidification of these materials under thermal cycling at high temperatures. The main issues to be considered include vapour pressure, undercooling, corrosion, segregation, changes in composition and microstructure, changes in thermal properties and undesired reactions. Further research is needed before these materials can be used as PCMs in thermal energy storage systems in industry.

Abstract: Endothelial dysfunction caused by endothelial cells senescence and chronic inflammation is tightly linked to the development of cardiovascular diseases. NLRP3 (NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing3) inflammasome plays a central role in inflammatory response that is associated with diverse inflammatory diseases. This study explores the effects and possible mechanisms of NLRP3 inflammasome in endothelial cells senescence. Results show an increment of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL) −1β secretion and caspase-1 activation during the senescence of endothelial cells induced by bleomycin. Moreover, secreted IL-1β promoted endothelial cells senescence through up-regulation of p53/p21 protein expression. NLRP3 inflammasome was found to mediate IL-1β secretion through the production of ROS (reactive oxygen species) during the senescence of endothelial cells. Furthermore, the association of TXNIP (thioredoxin-interacting protein) with NLRP3 induced by ROS promoted NLRP3 inflammasome activation in senescent endothelial cells. In addition, the expressions of NLRP3 inflammasome related genes, ASC (apoptosis associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), TXNIP, cleaved caspase-1 and IL-1β, were also increased in vitro and in vivo studies. These findings indicate that endothelial senescence could be mediated through ROS and NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathways, suggesting a potential target for the prevention of endothelial senescence-related cardiovascular diseases.

Abstract: Glioma is one of the most common types of brain tumors. DNA damage is closely associated with glioma cell apoptosis induced by X-ray irradiation. Alterations of metabolites in glioma can be detected noninvasively by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy. To noninvasively explore the micro mechanism in X-ray irradiation-induced apoptosis, the relationship between metabolites and DNA damage in glioma cells was investigated. Three glioma cell lines (C6, U87 and U251) were randomly designated as control (0Gy) and treatment groups (1, 5, 10, 15Gy). After X-ray exposure, each group was separated into four parts: (i) to detect metabolites by 1H NMR spectroscopy; (ii) to make cell colonies; (iii) to detect cell cycle distribution and apoptosis rate by flow cytometry; and (iv) to measure DNA damage by comet assay. The metabolite ratios of lactate/creatine and succinate/creatine decreased (lactate/creatine: C6, 22.17–66.27%; U87, 15.93–44.56%; U251, 26.27–74.48%. succinate/creatine: C6, 14.41–48.35%; U87, 22.03–70.62%; U251, 17.33–60.06%) and choline/creatine increased (C6, 52.22–389.68%; U87, 56.15–82.36%; U251, 31.87–278.62%) in the treatment groups compared with the control group (each P<0.05), which linearly depended on DNA damage. An increasing dose of X-ray irradiation increased numbers of apoptotic cells (P<0.01), and the DNA damage parameters were dose-dependent (P<0.05). The colony-forming rate declined (P<0.01) and the percentage of cells at G1 stage increased when exposed to 1Gy X-ray (three cell lines, P<0.05). Metabolite alterations detected by 1H NMR spectroscopy can be used to determine DNA damage induced by X-ray irradiation. 1H NMR spectroscopy is a noninvasive method to predict DNA damage of glioma cell at the micro level.

Abstract: To better understand and quantify soiling rates on solar panels, we are investigating the adhesion mechanisms between dust particles and solar glass. In this work, we report on two of the fundamental adhesion mechanisms: van der Waals and capillary adhesion forces. The adhesion was determined using force versus distance (F-z) measurements performed with an atomic force microscope (AFM). To emulate dust interacting with the front surface of a solar panel, we measured how oxidized AFM tips, SiO2 glass spheres, and real dust particles adhered to actual solar glass. The van der Waals forces were evaluated by measurements performed with zero relative humidity in a glove box, and the capillary forces were measured in a stable environment created inside the AFM enclosure with relative humidity values ranging from 18% to 80%. To simulate topographic features of the solar panels caused by factors such as cleaning and abrasion, we induced different degrees of surface roughness in the solar glass. We were able to 1) identify and quantify both the van der Waals and capillary forces, 2) establish the effects of surface roughness, relative humidity, and particle size on the adhesion mechanisms, and 3) compare adhesion forces between well-controlled particles (AFM tips and glass spheres) and real dust particles.

Abstract: A major challenge in the development of high-efficiency high-temperature solar receivers for concentrated solar power plants is the development of high-temperature materials with an ideal spectral selectivity (high solar absorptivity and low hemispherical total emissivity). TaC could be an interesting candidate due to its very good spectral selectivity, which could be increased by surface treatments and microstructuring. However, Ta2O5 presents the opposite selectivity. Therefore, we investigated the oxidation of TaC in air and in helium at 1100K and determined the impact of this oxidation on the optical and thermal properties using reflectivity and bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) measurements and laser flash analysis (LFA), respectively. We observed that the oxidation in air was too severe. Additionally, the samples treated in helium were sufficiently oxidized by the residual oxygen to lose their spectral selectivity. Therefore, despite its promising optical properties, TaC cannot be used for high-temperature applications in air or even in helium.

Abstract: Latent heat storage in salt mixtures has attracted much attention as it can store a large amount of heat within a small temperature range in a small volume compared to sensible heat storage. In this paper, the eutectic salt of LiNO3–NaCl (87–13%) was investigated to evaluate its potential for latent heat storage for medium temperature range applications (<300°C). The eutectic salt was prepared using the indirect mixing method. Its thermal properties including melting temperature and latent heat were measured over multiple cycles using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The measurements show that the eutectic salt of LiNO3–NaCl (87–13%) has a suitable melting temperature (around 220°C) and a relatively high latent heat (>290kJ/kg). Its thermal decomposition temperature was tested using a Thermogravimetric Analyser (TGA). The salt mixture exhibits an excellent chemical stability below 400°C with no changes after tests of multiple cycles with DSC and TGA. The main factors affecting the economic feasibility for this eutectic salt were also discussed.

Abstract: Beyond the ideal detailed balance evaluation, layer-dependent thermal radiation conversion has been systematically investigated here for tandem device consisting of a GaSb top subcell and a 0.53eV GaInAsSb bottom subcell. Relying on the experimentally-accessible material parameters, it is demonstrated here that tandem device in its N-on-P configuration displays a superior thermal conversion efficiency, and the proper doping profile should be controlled as Nd = 7–9 × 1017cm−3 and Na = 5 × 1017cm−3 for GaSb subcell while Nd = 6–7 × 1017cm−3 and Na = 3.5 × 1017cm−3 for 0.53eV GaInAsSb subcell. Moreover, due to different subcell-limited performance outputs, the dependence of thermal conversion efficiency on radiator temperature shows a remarkable “S-shape” feature, and the open-circuit voltage of tandem cell can be up to 0.7–0.8V for typical radiator temperatures. Finally, limited by the larger bandgap of GaSb material, superior thermal conversion efficiency can be always expected for tandem cell when comparing to GaSb cell, but only for radiator temperature larger than 1500K when comparing to 0.53eV GaInAsSb cell.

Abstract: Background/aims
Elastase inhibitors reverse elastin degradation and abnormal alveologenesis and attenuate the lung structural abnormalities induced by mechanical ventilation with O2-rich gas. The potential of these molecules to improve endothelial function and to ameliorate severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) during lung development is not yet understood. We sought to determine whether the intratracheal treatment of newborn mice with the elastase inhibitor elafin would prevent hyperoxia-induced lung elastin degradation and the cascade of events that cause abnormal alveologenesis.
Methods
Newborn mice were exposed to 85% O2 for 3, 7, 14 or 21days. Recombinant human elafin was administered by intratracheal instillation from the first day every two days for 20days. We next used morphometric analyses, quantitative RT-PCR, immunostaining, Western blotting, and ELISA methods to assess the key variables involved in elastogenesis disruption and the potential signaling pathways noted below in recombinant human elafin-treated mouse pups that had been exposed to 85% O2.
Results
We found that impaired alveolar development and aberrant elastin production were associated with elevations in whole lung elastase levels in 85% O2-exposed lungs. Elafin attenuated the structural disintegration that developed in the hyperoxia-damaged lungs. Furthermore, elafin prevented the elastin degradation, neutrophil influx, activation of TGF-β1 and apoptosis caused by 85% O2 exposure.
Conclusions
Pulmonary elastase plays an important role in disrupting elastogenesis during O2-induced damage, which is the result of a pulmonary inflammatory response. Elafin prevents these changes by inhibiting elastase and the TGF-β1 signalling cascade and may be a new therapeutic target for preventing O2-induced lung injury in neonates.

Abstract: Phase change material (PCM) driven thermal energy storage (TES) systems are showing promise for cooling energy saving in residential and office buildings. State-of-the-art TES for interior items such as tiles and furnishings require the material matrix to transfer heat rapidly between the adjacent PCM and the indoors. TES developers offer a large number of PCM composites, in which, however, the high thermal conductivity counterbalances the PCM volume capacity and material form-stability above the PCM melting point. Herein, we report a novel aluminium matrix with open ultrathin (mainly, below 150nm) pores and the developed surface area (~7m2 g-1) that solves the dilemma. The porous (22–46vol%) aluminium matrix results from the compacted aluminium nanoflakes reactively (1min at 873K in N2) sintered with the aid of oxidation of the nanoflake protector, stearic acid. The preparation method leads to partial transformation of the pores and an increase of the specific surface area. In the PCM fraction range, the prepared composite has the thermal conductivity in the range of 10–60Wm-1K-1. The effects of the PCM volume fraction on the thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity are described. As an example, we have considered an affordable organic PCM such as coconut oil that can readily cling to the Al2O3-filmed surface of the material pores through the hydroxyl functionalities. With the use of vacuum infiltration, heated (373 K) coconut oil deeply penetrates the matrix pores. The PCM composite has shown the excellent form stability in terms of the coconut oil mass loss (below 1.5wt%) at an elevated temperature of 318 K for over 1000h. Applied internally, this kind of TES composite can rapidly and efficiently transfer a considerable amount of heat energy within a large building area and regulate the indoor temperature.

Abstract: Gasochromic films can reversibly switch their optical transmittance upon alternating exposure to diluted H2 and O2 gases. These films are usually prepared by physical methods such as sputtering and pulsed-laser deposition. Here, we report a new method using UV irradiation for low-temperature chemical fabrication of Pt-WO3 gasochromic switchable films. In this method, an amorphous film of WO3 is produced, and the photocatalytic properties of the WO3 are utilized for the reduction of the Pt2+ precursor to Pt particles. This method also generates a large number of voids in the film at 100°C. The initial transmittance of the Pt-WO3 films was extremely high (approximately 80%) over the visible to the near infrared region, and the optical change in the transmittance upon exposure to H2 gas or air was large (approximately 70% at a wavelength of 670nm). In addition, the switching time of the films was as fast as 5s, and the switching durability of the films was preserved for over 1500 cycles.

Abstract: As an emerging technology, the photovoltaic/concentrated solar power (PV-CSP) hybrid technology is considered as one of the research focuses currently in solar energy field, due to various advantages compared with the PV-alone and CSP-alone technologies. Compared with the PV-alone system, the PV-CSP hybrid system can produce electricity with better power quality. While compared with the CSP-alone system, the cost of power production can be reduced. The overall generating efficiency will also be greatly improved if the PV component and the CSP component of the hybrid system are “compactly” hybridized by PV-topping or spectral beam splitting (SBS) technologies. The development of PV-CSP hybrid systems accelerated in recent years with the increase of maturity of PV and CSP technologies. This paper presents an exhaustive review on the state-of-the-art of the PV-CSP hybrid technologies, including the non-compact hybrid system, the PV-topping hybrid system, the SBS hybrid system, and the hybrid system combining SBS and PV-topping technologies. Recent progresses of the key technologies of the PV-CSP hybrid systems, such as high temperature solar cells, spectral beam filters, and high flux heat exchangers, are generally discussed. After that, the research status and the hybrid system performance are summarized from the literature to provide a global point of view on the PV-CSP hybrid technology. The advantages and limitations of the hybrid technology are also concluded according to the literature reviewed.

Abstract: In this study, Al2O3-loaded expanded vermiculite (aEV/AO) with improved adsorption capacity and thermal conductivity was reported as the lauric-myristic-stearic acid eutectic mixture (LA-MA-SA) supporting matrix. The Al2O3-loaded expanded vermiculite was prepared by acid treating expanded vermiculite (aEV) followed by loading Al2O3 particles. The thermal conductivity of LA-MA-SA/aEV/AO was 0.671W/mK, which was 156.1%, 30.8% and 37.5% higher than that of LA-MA-SA, LA-MA-SA/EV and LA-MA-SA/aEV, respectively. The latent heats of LA-MA-SA/aEV/AO were 113.7J/g at the melting temperature of 28.6°C and 108.5J/g at the freezing temperature of 26.9°C, which were also higher than those of LA-MA-SA/EV and LA-MA-SA/aEV. The results of the thermo-gravimetric analysis, thermal cycling test and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated that the LA-MA-SA/aEV/AO composite PCM was thermally stable and chemically inert. Thus, LA-MA-SA/aEV/AO is a preferential potential thermal energy material for the improving the energy efficiency in building applications due to its proper phase change temperature range, relatively high latent heat and thermal conductivity, good thermal reliability and chemical stability.

Abstract: Inorganic-organic halide perovskites hold the great promise for next-generation photovoltaics due to their excellent high performance and low cost. However, major limitation for the commercialization of perovskite solar cell can be attributed to the transformation and degradation of lead halide perovskite during the exposure of environmental humidity and photon irradiation. To solve these problems, herein, we apply the one-dimensional and inorganic RbPbI3 perovskite into the solar cell because it shows the superior stability in environmental conditions. After RbPbI3 perovskite was applied into the solar cell with a FTO/TiO2/RbPbI3/Spiro-MeOTAD/Au configuration, the device exhibits an open circuit voltage of 0.62V, photocurrent density of 3.75mA/cm2, fill factor of 44.60%, and 1.04% of PCE by reverse sweeping direction. Even though the performance of RbPbI3 device was still lower than other perovskite solar cells, this approach enabled us to establish the key step to make a highly stable perovskite film, leading to the best photovoltaic performance for real applications.

Abstract: Here we report, a novel two-step dipping technique via post-immersion polar solvent engineering for controlled secondary grain growth (Ostwald Ripening) to fabricate efficient mixed organic cation based MA0.6FA0.4PbI3 perovskite solar cell (PSC) in conjunction with low temperature (140°C) processed sol-gel ZnO ETL for full process compatibility with flexible substrates. The reported MTD-SE method (stands for Modified Two Step Dipping - Solvent Engineering) limits the grain coarsening effect during post-immersion stage of two-step dipping method and provides substantially smooth perovskite surface morphology for enhanced charge transport properties compared to conventional two-step techniques by means of controlled Ostwald Ripening process. The grain coarsening process and concomitant irregular grain size distribution are judiciously controlled by increasing the chemical potential or free energy change (ΔG) of the system at the post-immersion. The photovoltaic performance and photo-current hysteresis phenomena of the reported MTD-SE PSC have been compared with PSCs fabricated with conventional two-step techniques, incorporating 2-Propanol or ethyl alcohol as dipping solvents. The enhanced device performance of MTD-SE PSCs is correlated with the conducive role of the evenly distributed grain boundaries in them, which act as carrier dissociation interfaces and carrier transport pathways to charge selective contacts for superior charge separation and extraction properties. Adding to the merits, MTD-SE PSCs also demonstrate significantly suppressed photo-current hysteretic behaviour which has been elucidated in the context of faster ion migration kinetics with the increased grain boundaries, which exhibit higher ionic diffusivity. The favourable ion migration kinetics with MTD-SE PSC have also been comprehensively analysed from the frequency-dependent capacitive spectra.

Abstract: Background
Ezrin, links the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton, and plays an important role in the development and progression of human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). However, the roles of ezrin S66 phosphorylation in tumorigenesis of ESCC remain unclear.
Methods
Distribution of ezrin in membrane and cytosol fractions was examined by analysis of detergent-soluble/-insoluble fractions and cytosol/membrane fractionation. Both immunofluorescence and live imaging were used to explore the role of ezrin S66 phosphorylation in the behavior of ezrin and actin in cell filopodia. Cell proliferation, migration and invasion of ESCC cells were investigated by proliferation and migration assays, respectively. Tumorigenesis, local invasion and metastasis were assessed in a nude mouse model of regional lymph node metastasis.
Results
Ezrin S66 phosphorylation enhanced the recruitment of ezrin to the membrane in ESCC cells. Additionally, non-phosphorylatable ezrin (S66A) significantly prevented filopodia formation, as well as caused a reduction in the number, length and lifetime of filopodia. Moreover, functional experiments revealed that expression of non-phosphorylatable ezrin (S66A) markedly suppressed migration and invasion but not proliferation of ESCC cells in vitro, and attenuated local invasion and regional lymph node metastasis, but not primary tumor growth of ESCC cells in vivo.
Conclusion
Ezrin S66 phosphorylation enhances filopodia formation, contributing to the regulation of invasion and metastasis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells.

Abstract: The phase change of sodium acetate (SA) aqueous solution to sodium acetate trihydrate (SAT) requires large supercooling degree, then the aqueous solution can be at liquid state at fairly low temperature without releasing the stored latent heat. Such a feature makes SAT a promising material for seasonal solar thermal energy storage. The present study firstly summarized the thermo-physical properties of the solid SAT and liquid SA aqueous solution at different temperatures and concentrations, including equilibrium temperatures, densities, specific heats and thermal conductivities. The calculation methods of these properties have been established. Secondly, with the aid of the above properties, a mathematic model of the thermal discharge process of the storage system, i.e. the solidification process of supercooled SA aqueous solution, was built based on the heat transfer between the phase changing material within a single storage tube and the external flowing heat transfer fluid (HTF). The experimentally obtained SAT crystal growth rate and the enthalpy change of solidifying supercooled SA aqueous solution were employed to aid the modelling. The discharge temperature and thermal power of the storage system were numerically obtained and analysed. The influence of the ambient temperature, the mass flow rate as well as the heat transfer coefficient of the HTF on the thermal discharge performance were discussed. Finally, the seasonal thermal storage density of SAT was given and compared to that of water and some sorption materials.

Abstract: Luminescent solar concentrators (LSC) have great potential for providing solar energy at a competitive cost. They are simple devices employing a luminescent material embedded in a transparent sheet with solar cells attached on the edges. The luminescent material absorbs short wavelength solar radiation and emits red-shifted light. The emission is then guided towards the sheet edges, where the concentrated light is absorbed by the solar cell to produce electricity. The commercialization of luminescent solar concentrators has been stunted by an ongoing search for an adequate luminescent species that, among other things, is UV stable and inexpensive. While luminescent phosphors exhibit these characteristics, as well as other desirable qualities, their use in LSCs has received limited attention because they are highly scattering. Here, we demonstrate that luminescent solar concentrators can effectively employ scattering luminescent phosphors in the form of films. Monte Carlo simulations are used to investigate the optimum film location (top or bottom of the LSC) and concentration of phosphor within the film. The results show that when a film with a high phosphor concentration is placed at the bottom of the LSC, escape cone losses are lower than when the film is placed at the top, which increases light concentration within LSC. Four LSCs fabricated with commercially available materials, including the luminescent phosphor, are tested at varying incident angles using a full spectrum solar simulator. Moderate flux gains are achieved with efficiencies ranging from ~1.6 to 8.6%, depending on the angle of incidence and aspect ratio (AR). These results demonstrate the potential of luminescent phosphors for LSC applications.

Abstract: The in situ electrode potentials of anodes and cathodes in electrochromic (EC) devices were investigated. The solution-based 2-electrode EC device was fabricated with electrolyte solutions containing anodic and cathodic EC molecules. The electrochemical reaction in a 2-electrode EC device was controlled by the electrode reaction when electroactive molecules in smaller concentrations were used. In addition, the electrode showing less electrochemical activity in the EC device was subjected to larger overpotential under the application of a driving voltage, leading to the promotion of the redox reaction at the electrode. The results showed that the electrode potentials of the device were spontaneously regulated to facilitate both electrode reactions. It is very important to know the potential at each electrode in order to understand the reaction in detail in the 2-electrode EC device.

Abstract: Calreticulin (CRT) and citrullinated (citCRT) are implicated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pathology. citCRT binds to RA shared epitopes (SE) on HLA-DR molecules with high affinity and triggers pro-inflammatory events in adjacent cells. The aim of the study was to detect the presence of citCRT prior to developing RA and evaluate if citCT is a target for autoantibodies in RA cohorts with and without lung disease. Antibodies were assessed by ELISA against native CRT, citCRT and general protein citrullination, in sera from 50 RA patients without lung disease, 122 bronchiectasis (BR) patients, 52 bronchiectasis patients with RA (BRRA), 87 asthma patients and 77 healthy controls (HC). Serum citCRT was detected by immunoblotting and mass spectrometry. Genomic DNA was genotyped for HLA-DRB1 alleles. Patients were assessed for DAS28, rheumatoid factor, and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies. Extracellular citCRT was detected in BR patients sera prior to them developing RA. A citCRT SE binding peptide GEWKPR261citQIDNPDYK was identified. Anti-CRT antibodies were observed in 18% of BR patients with or without RA. Anti-citCRT antibodies were observed in ∼35% of BR or RA patients, increasing to 58% in BRRA patients. In the RA alone patients 7/20 (35%) who were negative for RF and anti-CCP were anti-CRT antibody positive and had higher DAS28 scores than triple negative RA alone patients. Three of the four BR patients who developed RA over 18 months were anti-citCRT+ve SE+ve. The detection of citCRT in BR and development of anti-citCRT in BR patients suggests citCRT antigens are early targets of antigenicity in these patients, especially in SE+ve patients prior to the onset of RA.

Abstract: Could transparent solar cells work as the invisible power generator? Is it possible, in order to satisfy the on-site energy production, to install the transparent solar cell into the window of buildings and vehicles without recognizing the existence of energy harvesting entities? Here we propose and demonstrate the wide energy bandgap materials for visible light transmittance and UV photon absorption for power generation. All-transparent solar cell was achieved by the heterojunction of metal oxide layers. By using the solid-state sputtering method, transparent heterojunction (p-type NiO/n-type ZnO) was realized. A unit cell gave the record-high conversion efficiency of 6% with the enormous current density (2.7mA/cm2) and open circuit voltage of 532mV. The remarkable transparent solar power is mainly attributed to the absolute UV absorption to induce the substantial excitonic effect for ZnO/NiO heterojunction. For integration, the transparent solar cell units were fabricated on a glass substrate to demonstrate the module of unit solar cells. Using the 3 × 3 unit cell solar module, a significant output voltage (> 2V) was achieved to confirm the excellent connection manipulation of transparent solar cell units. By putting the transparent solar cells on buildings and vehicles, the electric power is spontaneously supplied from the Sun power but human eyes have no visible scarification. Transparent solar cells would provide a route for on-site energy generation.

Abstract: Autophagy is an important homoeostatic mechanism for the lysosomal degradation of protein aggregates and damaged cytoplasmic components. Recent studies suggest that autophagy which is induced by TGF-β1 suppresses kidney fibrosis in renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) of obstructed kidneys. Sphingosine kinase 1(SK1), converting sphingosine into endogenous sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), was shown to modulate autophagy and involved in the processes of fibrotic diseases. Since SK1 activity is also up-regulated by TGF-β1, we explored its effect on the induction of autophagy and development of renal fibrosis in this study. In vitro, SK1 expression and activity were markedly increased by TGF-β1 stimulation in a time and concentration dependent manner, and concomitant changes in autophagic response were observed in HK-2 cells. Further, knockdown of SK-1 led to a decrease of autophagy whereas overexpression of SK1 caused a greater induction of autophagy. In addition, overexpression of SK1 resulted in decreased of mature TGF-β levels through autophagic degradation. In vivo, SK1 enzymatic activity and autophagic response were both up-regulated in a mouse model of kidney fibrosis induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO); meanwhile, increased of mature TGF-β1 and deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) were observed in tubulointerstitial areas compared with sham-operated mice. However, aggravation of renal fibrosis was detected when SK1 inhibitor PF-543 was applied to suppress SK1 enzymatic activity in UUO mice. At the same time, autophagy was also inhibited by PF-543. Thus, our findings suggest that SK1 activation is renoprotective via induction of autophagy in the fibrotic process.

Abstract: Microcapsules with thermal energy storage and UV-shielding functions were successfully prepared by the method of suspension-like polymerization in order to reduce the damage of ultraviolet light. The bifunctional microcapsules (MPCMs/TiO2) consist of n-octadecane as core material and poly (methyl-methacrylate) (PMMA) doped with titanium dioxide nanoparticles as shell material. The scanning electronic microscope (SEM) micrographs and particle size distributions showed that the as-prepared microcapsules are spherical and about 10–20µm in average diameter. It was confirmed by Fourier transformation infrared spectroscope (FTIR) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) spectra that modified TiO2 nanoparticles had been well fixed in the cross-linked network structure of PMMA shell. In addition, the results of differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) and ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer (UV–vis) measurements demonstrated that the microcapsules exhibited high thermal storage capability, good thermal reliability and stability, and good UV-shielding property. The resultant samples of MPCMs/TiO2 may become the potential materials in the advanced applications of intelligent textile.

Abstract: The formation of a dense and uniform perovskite film with large grain is an important factor for getting excellent device performance. Here, we report an optimized solvent-assisted crystallization procedure followed by a delayed annealing for easy and reproducible fabrications of perovskite solar cells with a hybrid mesoscopic configuration. The working electrode contains a mesoporous TiO2 scaffold layer of 100nm deposited on FTO substrate with a thin TiO2 blocking layer. The devices in this study were assembled using all commercially available materials without any extensive modification. Formation of uniform and pin-hole free perovskite nanocrystals with film thickness 200nm on top of the scaffold layer was achieved via an optimized solvent-assisted crystallization method. A much smoother perovskite layer was achieved with a delayed annealing for a certain period. The best performing device was obtained at the annealing delayed for 60min, giving the power conversion efficiency 16.9% with an average value 15.4% obtained from 60 devices.

Abstract: We have recently reported that the altered recognition patterns of immunoglobulins due to acrolein conjugation are at least partially responsible for autoimmune diseases in patients with primary Sjögren’s syndrome (pSS). In the current study, it was found that the specific activity (activity/ng protein) of metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in saliva was elevated about 2.4-fold in pSS patients. Accordingly, it was examined whether MMP-9 is activated by acrolein. It was found that the MMP-9 with 92kDa molecular weight was activated by acrolein. Under the conditions studied, Cys99, located in the propeptide, was conjugated with acrolein together with Cys230, 244, 302, 314, 329, 347, 361, 373, 388 and 516, which are located in fibronectin repeats and glycosyl domains, but not on the active site of MMP-9. In addition, 82 and 68kDa constructs of MMP-9s, lacking the NH2-terminal domain that contains Cys99, were not activated by acrolein. The results suggest that acrolein conjugation at Cys99 caused the active site of MMP-9 to be exposed. Activation of MMP-9 by acrolein was inhibited by cysteine, and slightly by lysine, because these amino acids inhibited acrolein conjugation with MMP-9. Conversely, MMP-9 activity in the presence of 50μM acrolein was enhanced by 100μM histidine. This was due to the inhibition of acrolein conjugation with His405 and 411 located at the Zn2+ binding site of MMP-9. These results suggest that activation of 92kDa MMP-9 by acrolein is involved in tissue damage in pSS patients and is regulated by cysteine and histidine, and slightly by lysine. Activated 82 and 68kDa MMP-9s were not detected in saliva of pSS patients by Western blotting.

Abstract: Sequential Cu(In,Ga)Se2 fabrication with a thermally activated reaction of Cu-In-Ga metal precursor layers in chalcogen atmosphere is an industrially attractive route for preparation of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 absorber based thin film solar cells. Recent results show that controlling the selenium supply during rapid thermal processing has a huge impact on absorber growth. Especially a two stage process applying a first annealing step with or without Se at temperatures up to 400°C was shown to have a positive effect on the elemental in-depth distribution. However, during this annealing, lateral phase separation, dewetting and coarsening may occur in the metal phase, leading to lateral non-uniformity of the absorber. In this study we show how the dewetting can be strongly decreased by adjusting the precursor architecture, applying faster heating rates and NaF addition on top of a precursor. In contrast, NaF deposited underneath the precursor increases the dewetting effect. Further we show that lateral phase separation during annealing increases with temperature and leads to phase domain sizes of several micrometers at 580°C.

Abstract: In this study, the effects of simultaneous use of a ZnO/water nanofluid and a phase change material (PCM) as coolant mediums for a photovoltaic (PV) fluid/nanofluid based collector system are investigated experimentally. By designing and fabricating two similar photovoltaic thermal systems, one with a PCM medium (PVT/PCM) and one without a PCM (PVT), the experiments are performed. The measured results for surface temperature, thermal and electrical efficiency of the systems are compared with each other and with those of a conventional photovoltaic module as a reference system based on a thermodynamic viewpoint. In addition, the results for a nanofluid as a working fluid is compared with those using pure deionized water. Results show that in the PCM/nanofluid based collector system, the average electrical output is increased by more than 13% compared to that of the conventional PV module. Using a nanofluid, instead of deionized water, improved the average thermal output by nearly 5% for the PVT system; when the PCM was also employed (i.e., for the PVT/PCM system) the increase in the thermal efficiency was nearly 9% without any extra energy consumption. Based on the results of an exergy analysis, the simultaneous use of both a nanofluid and the PCM for the cooling system, increases the overall exergy efficiency of the system more than 23% compared to that of a conventional PV module.

Abstract: Composite materials, made of graphitic carbon nitride/gadolinium and nitrogen co-doped titanium dioxide (g-C3N4/Gd-N-TiO2), have been successfully prepared by a simple and reproducible in-situ synthetic method. Specific surface area, pore size, particle morphology, crystalline structure, energy band gap, and chemical bonding mode of the materials have been characterized by spectroscopic and electron microscopic means. Photoluminescence measurement and photocatalytic degradation of methyl blue (MB) and antibiotics (gatifloxacin) test show that the composites exhibit significant enhanced photocatalytic activity. Our experimental results indicate that nanoscale heterojunctions are formed in the composites, and these junctions have played a key role in the separation and transportation of photo generated electrons and holes, and hence the effective promotion of the photocatalysis.

Abstract: The rGO-TiO2 composite catalysts were successfully synthesized by adopting a simple solvothermal method followed by heating at mild condition of 300°C for 1h, in which graphene oxide (GO) was converted to reduced graphene oxide (rGO). Spin coating technique was used for coating TiO2 and rGO-TiO2 composite catalysts on Indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass resulting in high transparency of about 75%. The rGO content was varied to optimize the activity of the catalysts. These synthesized catalysts were characterized by various techniques such as X-ray diffraction, Raman, Fourier transformed infrared and UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectral techniques, atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The anatase phase of TiO2 was successfully achieved with crystallite size of less than 6.7nm. Incorporation of spherical TiO2 particles on rGO resulted in reduction of band gap from 3.05 to 2.74eV. The interaction of TiO2 with rGO sheet decreased the rate of electron-hole pair recombination and also facilitated the efficient transfer of electrons from TiO2 to rGO. 0.5wt% rGO loaded TiO2 composite coatings showed highly efficient superhydrophilicity and self-cleaning property of decontaminating the adsorbed pollutants under simulated solar light irradiation within 30min. A threefold higher photocurrent was generated by rGO-TiO2 composite catalyst coating than pristine TiO2 coating. This work affords a new pathway for efficient utilization of solar energy by using our synthesized catalysts for indoor as well as outdoor applications.

Abstract: PERC cell is currently entering the industrial crystalline silicon solar cell production lines. While there has been many reports focusing on research PERCs, this paper aims to present a cost-efficient PERC roadmap at fully industrial level, i.e. beyond the research and pilot lines. We present a systematic experimental study on the most important material and cell parameters for PERC, for instance, the key processes of ozone based ALD Al2O3 rear surface passivation and screen printed aluminum local back surface field are discussed in detail, especially highlighting the importance of the process integration. Industrial PERC cells using this roadmap have demonstrated average efficiency of 20.5% and champion efficiency of 20.8% with open circuit voltage of 660–666mV. Light-induced degradation analysis shows that the PERC cells are subject to bulk degradation and not to surface degradation. An anti-LID treatment processed by simultaneous applying forward voltages and anneal can drastically decrease LID. The cell efficiency loss mechanisms are analyzed based on the quantum efficiency measurement, suns-Voc tests and series resistance loss calculations. These are combined with PC1D and PC2D simulations to analyze recombination loss mechanisms present in the cells in order to promote viable solutions to extend the current industrial PERC cell efficiency to 24%.

Abstract: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, demyelinating disease that affects the central nervous system and is characterized by a complex pathogenesis and difficult management. The identification of new biomarkers would be clinically useful for more accurate diagnoses and disease monitoring. Metabolomics, the identification of small endogenous molecules, offers an instantaneous molecular snapshot of the MS phenotype. Here the metabolomic profiles (utilizing plasma from patients with MS) were characterized with a Gas cromatography-mass spectrometry-based platform followed by a multivariate statistical analysis and comparison with a healthy control (HC) population. The obtained partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model identified and validated significant metabolic differences between individuals with MS and HC (R2X=0.223, R2Y=0.82, Q2=0.562; p<0.001). Among discriminant metabolites phosphate, fructose, myo-inositol, pyroglutamate, threonate, l-leucine, l-asparagine, l-ornithine, l-glutamine, and l-glutamate were correctly identified, and some resulted as unknown. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve with AUC 0.84 (p=0.01; CI: 0.75–1) generated with the concentrations of the discriminant metabolites, supported the strength of the model. Pathway analysis indicated asparagine and citrulline biosynthesis as the main canonical pathways involved in MS. Changes in the citrulline biosynthesis pathway suggests the involvement of oxidative stress during neuronal damage. The results confirmed metabolomics as a useful approach to better understand the pathogenesis of MS and to provide new biomarkers for the disease to be used together with clinical data.

Abstract: The geometrical structures, the electronic and optical properties of anatase TiO2 doped with N, La, and La + N atoms have been investigated by using general gradient approximations plus U calculations. We explored five doping ways based on the 2 × 2 × 1 supercell of anatase TiO2. These doping methods include N-substitution of O, La-substitution of Ti, interstitial La doping, N- and La-substitutions of O and Ti, N-substitution of O, and interstitial La doping, respectively. After fully optimizing the pristine and doped structures, we calculated the dielectric functions and the absorption coefficients for all structures to evaluate the changes in the photocatalytic performance of anatase TiO2 along with different doping methods. The band energy gaps, refractive index, and photoconductivity were also calculated to provide more information for doped TiO2 application. A new effective doping approach that enhances photocatalytic performance is identified. The mechanism of the dopant-enhanced photocatalytic performance is examined with the total density of states and the partial density of states.

Abstract: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is one of the most effective cancer treatments owing to its ability to selectively kill cancer cells, without affecting normal cells. However, it has been reported that several gastric cancer cells show resistance to TRAIL because of a scarcity of death receptor 5 (DR5) expressed on the cell surface. In this study, we show that cyclopamine sensitizes gastric cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by elevating the expression of DR5. Interestingly, survivin hampers the existence of DR5 protein under normal conditions and cyclopamine decreases the expression of survivin, thus acting as a TRAIL sensitizer. Mechanistically, cyclopamine induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress via reactive oxygen species (ROS) and CHOP, the last protein of the ER stress pathway and it regulates the proteasome degradation of survivin. Taken together, our results indicate that cyclopamine can be used for combination therapy in TRAIL-resistant gastric cancer cells.

Abstract: Inconel 601 superalloy was examined for compatibility with the eutectic mixtures of NaCl + Na2SO4 and NaCl + Na2CO3 at 700°C and Li2CO3 + K2CO3 + Na2CO3 at 450°C in air for thermal energy storage. Electrochemical measurements combined with advanced microscopy and microanalysis techniques were employed. Oxidation was the primary attack leading to the development of oxide deposits on the alloy surface. The deposit was not stable in NaCl + Na2CO3 because of the fluxing action and high solubility of chromium in the salt leading to very high corrosion current density values. De-alloying threatened the material at 700°C while the availability of oxygen controlled its rate. The availability of oxygen was seen to limit the corrosion rate in NaCl + Na2SO4 and NaCl + Na2CO3. De-alloying also appeared as pits on the metal surface at 700°C. For the metal in contact with NaCl + Na2SO4 an additional layer attacked by sulfur was found under the pitting corroded layer. The attack morphology on the metal surface in contact with Li2CO3 + K2CO3 + Na2CO3 at 450°C was found to be uniform.

Abstract: Human fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) play a role in joint synovial inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Some evidence indicates that particulate matter (PM) in air pollution could contribute to the progression of RA. However, more research is needed to clarify this relationship. Up-regulation of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and its metabolite prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) are implicated in various inflammatory diseases. Resveratrol, a polyphenol found mainly in grapes and red wine, has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. In the present study, we demonstrated that resveratrol reduced PM-induced COX-2/PGE2 expression in human FLSs, and attenuated PM-enhanced NADPH oxidase activity and ROS generation. In addition, PM induced Akt, ERK1/2, or p38 MAPK activation, which was inhibited by resveratrol. Finally, we demonstrated that PM enhanced NF-κB p65 phosphorylation and the NF-κB promoter activity, which were reduced by pretreatment with a ROS inhibitor or resveratrol. Thus, we concluded that resveratrol functions as a suppressor of PM-induced inflammatory signaling pathways by inhibiting COX-2/PGE2 expression.

Abstract: In this work, we perform an extensive campaign of three-dimensional numerical simulations of CIGS solar cell structures to investigate the effect of a surface-passivated CIGS with point contacts openings on the cell performance parameters (Jsc, Voc, FF and η). Detailed analysis of the combination of passivation thickness, point contact size and pitch is performed under the hypothesis of highly defective CIGS front surface and ideal chemical passivation: efficiencies close to the case of ideal (i.e., defect-free) CdS/CIGS interface can be achieved by optimized nanometer-scale point contact arrays. To account for field-effect passivation due to positive residual charge density, Qf, within the passivation layer, we vary Qf in the range 1010–1013cm−2 under the two extreme scenarios of ideal or ineffective chemical passivation. Several examples of CIGS cells with different buffer layers (CdS, ZnO, ZnMgO, In2S3, Zn(O, S)) are also analyzed. We find that a positive Qf in the interval 1012– 5·1012cm−2 can help completely recover the ideal cell efficiency, irrespective of the chemical passivation effect and even in the presence of unfavorable conduction band alignment at the buffer/CIGS heterojunction. This may help devising solutions with buffer materials alternative to CdS, boosting the performance of otherwise surface-limited cells. The effect of grain boundary defect density and position with respect to point contacts is also addressed, with a grain dimension of 750nm.

Abstract: Immortalized cell lines are widely used to study the effectiveness and toxicity of anti cancer drugs as well as to assess the phenotypic characteristics of cancer cells, such as proliferation and migration ability. Unfortunately, cell lines often show extremely different properties than tumor tissues. Also the primary cells, that are deprived of the in vivo environment, might adapt to artificial conditions, and differ from the tissue they should represent. Despite these considerations, cell lines are still one of the most used cancer models due to their availability and capability to expand without limitation, but the clinical relevance of their use is still a big issue in cancer research. Many studies tried to overcome this task, comparing cell lines and tumor samples through the definition of the genomic and transcriptomic differences. To this aim, most of them used nucleotide variation or gene expression data. Here we introduce a different strategy based on alternative splicing detection and integration of DNA and RNA sequencing data, to explore the differences between immortalized and tissue-derived cells at isoforms level. Furthermore, in order to better investigate the heterogeneity of both cell populations, we took advantage of a public available dataset obtained with a new simultaneous omics single cell sequencing methodology. The proposed pipeline allowed us to identify, through a computational and prediction approach, putative mutated and alternative spliced transcripts responsible for the dissimilarity between immortalized and primary hepato carcinoma cells.

Abstract: The increasing role of concentrated solar power (CSP) within the renewable energy portfolio is attributed to the possibility of integrating thermal energy storage (TES) systems. Then, CSP technology has become one of the most interesting clean options to deliver dispatchable power on demand. Nowadays, commercial facilities use high quality solar salts (60%:40% NaNO3 and KNO3 by weight) as storage medium due to the attractive properties of this fluid to be applied under CSP operation conditions. Taking into account that CSP installations are designed with really large TES systems containing tens of thousands of tons, the use of lower quality nitrates salts would reduce the molten salts inventory cost and finally the investment cost of the CSP storage systems at commercial scale. The most important drawback of selecting low quality nitrates salts for high temperature CSP applications is the corrosion impact produced by impurities. Accordingly, chlorides have been identified in the state of the art as the impurity with higher effect over corrosion. This work is focused on A516 Gr70 carbon steel corrosion performance evaluation under high-chlorides content nitrates salts (1.2% and 3% by weight) at 400°C. In addition, the feasibility of using the proposed low purity mixtures with current CSP facilities materials selection is analyzed. Results reported within this study show the critical effect of chloride content over corrosion mechanism producing lack of adherence between base metal and oxides layers in addition to corrosion products delamination and internal cracking. Then, the use of A516 Gr70 carbon steel is rejected for a long term design under solar salts containing chlorides content in the range 1.2–3% by weight being necessary a higher corrosion resistant materials selection. An improved materials selection focused on higher corrosion resistance alloys is discussed.
