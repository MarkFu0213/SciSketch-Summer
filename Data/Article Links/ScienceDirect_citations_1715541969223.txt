Abstract: Summary
Notwithstanding numerous published structures of RNA Polymerase II (Pol II), structural details of Pol II engaging a complete nucleic acid scaffold have been lacking. Here, we report the structures of TFIIF-stabilized transcribing Pol II complexes, revealing the upstream duplex and full transcription bubble. The upstream duplex lies over a wedge-shaped loop from Rpb2 that engages its minor groove, providing part of the structural framework for DNA tracking during elongation. At the upstream transcription bubble fork, rudder and fork loop 1 residues spatially coordinate strand annealing and the nascent RNA transcript. At the downstream fork, a network of Pol II interactions with the non-template strand forms a rigid domain with the trigger loop (TL), allowing visualization of its open state. Overall, our observations suggest that “open/closed” conformational transitions of the TL may be linked to interactions with the non-template strand, possibly in a synchronized ratcheting manner conducive to polymerase translocation.

Abstract: Summary
In response to microenvironmental cues, embryonic cells form adhesive signaling compartments that influence survival and patterning. Dividing cells detach from the surrounding matrix and initiate extensive membrane remodeling, but the in vivo impact of mitosis on adhesion-dependent signaling remains poorly characterized. We investigate in vivo signaling dynamics using the invertebrate chordate, Ciona intestinalis. In Ciona, matrix adhesion polarizes fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-dependent heart progenitor induction. Here, we show that adhesion inhibits mitotic FGF receptor internalization, leading to receptor enrichment along adherent membranes. Targeted disruption of matrix adhesion promotes uniform FGF receptor internalization and degradation while enhanced adhesion suppresses degradation. Chimeric analysis indicates that integrin β chain-specific impacts on induction are dictated by distinct internalization motifs. We also found that matrix adhesion impacts receptor enrichment through Caveolin-rich membrane domains. These results redefine the relationship between cell division and adhesive signaling, revealing how mitotic membrane turnover orchestrates adhesion-dependent signal polarization.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanisms by which the microtubule cytoskeleton regulates the permeability of endothelial barrier are not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that microtubule-associated end-binding protein 3 (EB3), a core component of the microtubule plus-end protein complex, binds to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) through an S/TxIP EB-binding motif. In endothelial cells, α-thrombin, a pro-inflammatory mediator that stimulates phospholipase Cβ, increases the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and elicits clustering of IP3R3s. These responses, and the resulting Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of myosin light chain, are prevented by depletion of either EB3 or mutation of the TxIP motif of IP3R3 responsible for mediating its binding to EB3. We also show that selective EB3 gene deletion in endothelial cells of mice abrogates α-thrombin-induced increase in endothelial permeability. We conclude that the EB3-mediated interaction of IP3Rs with microtubules controls the assembly of IP3Rs into effective Ca2+ signaling clusters, which thereby regulate microtubule-dependent endothelial permeability.

Abstract: Summary
The heat shock response (HSR) is essential for proteostasis and cellular health. In metazoans, aging is associated with a decline in quality control, thus increasing the risk for protein conformational disease. Here, we show that in C. elegans, the HSR declines precipitously over a 4 hr period in early adulthood coincident with the onset of reproductive maturity. Repression of the HSR occurs due to an increase in H3K27me3 marks at stress gene loci, the timing of which is determined by reduced expression of the H3K27 demethylase jmjd-3.1. This results in a repressed chromatin state that interferes with HSF-1 binding and suppresses transcription initiation in response to stress. The removal of germline stem cells preserves jmjd-3.1 expression, suppresses the accumulation of H3K27me3 at stress gene loci, and maintains the HSR. These findings suggest that competing requirements of the germline and soma dictate organismal stress resistance as animals begin reproduction.

Poly(A) Signal-Dependent Transcription Termination Occurs through a Conformational Change Mechanism that Does Not Require Cleavage at the Poly(A) Site,

Abstract: Summary
Transcription termination for genes encoding polyadenylated mRNAs requires a functional poly(A) signal (PAS) in the nascent pre-mRNA. Often called PAS-dependent termination, or PADT, it is widely assumed that the PAS requirement reflects an obligatory poly(A) site cleavage requirement for termination. Cleavage is thought to provide entry for a 5′-to-3′ exonuclease that targets RNA polymerase II via the nascent transcript—i.e., the torpedo model. To assess the role of cleavage in PADT, we developed a PADT assay using HeLa nuclear extract. Here we examine the basal mechanism of PADT and show that cleavage at the poly(A) site is not required for PADT. Isolated elongation complexes undergo termination in a PAS-dependent manner when incubated in buffer, in the absence of extract, nucleotides, or cleavage at the poly(A) site. Thus, PADT-proficient complexes undergo a conformational change that triggers termination. PADT is inhibited by α-amanitin, which presumably blocks the required conformational change.

Abstract: Summary
Execution of the DNA damage response (DDR) relies upon a dynamic array of protein modifications. Using quantitative proteomics, we have globally profiled ubiquitination, acetylation, and phosphorylation in response to UV and ionizing radiation. To improve acetylation site profiling, we developed the strategy FACET-IP. Our datasets of 33,500 ubiquitination and 16,740 acetylation sites provide valuable insight into DDR remodeling of the proteome. We find that K6- and K33-linked polyubiquitination undergo bulk increases in response to DNA damage, raising the possibility that these linkages are largely dedicated to DDR function. We also show that Cullin-RING ligases mediate 10% of DNA damage-induced ubiquitination events and that EXO1 is an SCF-Cyclin F substrate in the response to UV radiation. Our extensive datasets uncover additional regulated sites on known DDR players such as PCNA and identify previously unknown DDR targets such as CENPs, underscoring the broad impact of the DDR on cellular physiology.

Abstract: Summary
Inter-organellar communication is vital for successful innate immune responses that confer defense against pathogens. However, little is known about how chloroplasts, which are a major production site of pro-defense molecules, communicate and coordinate with other organelles during defense. Here we show that chloroplasts send out dynamic tubular extensions called stromules during innate immunity or exogenous application of the pro-defense signals, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and salicylic acid. Interestingly, numerous stromules surround nuclei during defense response, and these connections correlate with an accumulation of chloroplast-localized NRIP1 defense protein and H2O2 in the nucleus. Furthermore, silencing and knockout of chloroplast unusual positioning 1 (CHUP1) that encodes a chloroplast outer envelope protein constitutively induces stromules in the absence of pathogen infection and enhances programmed cell death. These results support a model in which stromules aid in the amplification and/or transport of pro-defense signals into the nucleus and other subcellular compartments during immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Human sister chromatids at metaphase are primarily linked by centromeric cohesion, forming the iconic X shape. Premature loss of centromeric cohesion disrupts orderly mitotic progression. Shugoshin (Sgo1) binds to and protects cohesin at inner centromeres. The kinetochore kinase Bub1 phosphorylates histone H2A at T120 (H2A-pT120) and recruits Sgo1 to kinetochores, 0.5 μm from inner centromeres. Here, we show that Sgo1 is a direct reader of the H2A-pT120 mark. Bub1 also recruits RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to unattached kinetochores and promotes active transcription at mitotic kinetochores. Mitosis-specific inactivation of Pol II traps Sgo1 at kinetochores and weakens centromeric cohesion. Sgo1 interacts with Pol II in human cells and with RNA in vitro. We propose that Pol II-dependent transcription enables kinetochore-bound Sgo1 initially recruited by H2A-pT120 to reach cohesin embedded in centromeric chromatin. Our study implicates mitotic transcription in targeting regulatory factors to highly compacted mitotic chromatin.

Abstract: Summary
Yeast cells with DNA damage avoid respiration, presumably because products of oxidative metabolism can be harmful to DNA. We show that DNA damage inhibits the activity of the Snf1 (AMP-activated) protein kinase (AMPK), which activates expression of genes required for respiration. Glucose and DNA damage upregulate SUMOylation of Snf1, catalyzed by the SUMO E3 ligase Mms21, which inhibits SNF1 activity. The DNA damage checkpoint kinases Mec1/ATR and Tel1/ATM, as well as the nutrient-sensing protein kinase A (PKA), regulate Mms21 activity toward Snf1. Mec1 and Tel1 are required for two SNF1-regulated processes—glucose sensing and ADH2 gene expression—even without exogenous genotoxic stress. Our results imply that inhibition of Snf1 by SUMOylation is a mechanism by which cells lower their respiration in response to DNA damage. This raises the possibility that activation of DNA damage checkpoint mechanisms could contribute to aerobic fermentation (Warburg effect), a hallmark of cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
Enhanced glucose utilization can be visualized in atherosclerotic lesions and may reflect a high glycolytic rate in lesional macrophages, but its causative role in plaque progression remains unclear. We observe that the activity of the carbohydrate-responsive element binding protein ChREBP is rapidly downregulated upon TLR4 activation in macrophages. ChREBP inactivation refocuses cellular metabolism to a high redox state favoring enhanced inflammatory responses after TLR4 activation and increased cell death after TLR4 activation or oxidized LDL loading. Targeted deletion of ChREBP in bone marrow cells resulted in accelerated atherosclerosis progression in Ldlr−/− mice with increased monocytosis, lesional macrophage accumulation, and plaque necrosis. Thus, ChREBP-dependent macrophage metabolic reprogramming hinders plaque progression and establishes a causative role for leukocyte glucose metabolism in atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Summary
Emerging evidence demonstrates that the DNA repair kinase DNA-PKcs exerts divergent roles in transcriptional regulation of unsolved consequence. Here, in vitro and in vivo interrogation demonstrate that DNA-PKcs functions as a selective modulator of transcriptional networks that induce cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. Accordingly, suppression of DNA-PKcs inhibits tumor metastases. Clinical assessment revealed that DNA-PKcs is significantly elevated in advanced disease and independently predicts for metastases, recurrence, and reduced overall survival. Further investigation demonstrated that DNA-PKcs in advanced tumors is highly activated, independent of DNA damage indicators. Combined, these findings reveal unexpected DNA-PKcs functions, identify DNA-PKcs as a potent driver of tumor progression and metastases, and nominate DNA-PKcs as a therapeutic target for advanced malignancies.

Abstract: Summary
Many receptor-mediated endocytic processes are mediated by constitutive budding of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) at spatially randomized sites before slowly pinching off from the plasma membrane (60–100 s). In contrast, clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) coupled with regulated exocytosis in excitable cells occurs at peri-exocytic sites shortly after vesicle fusion (∼10 s). The molecular mechanism underlying this spatiotemporal coupling remains elusive. We show that coupled endocytosis makes use of pre-formed CCPs, which hop to nascent fusion sites nearby following vesicle exocytosis. A dynamic cortical microtubular network, anchored at the cell surface by the cytoplasmic linker-associated protein on microtubules and the LL5β/ELKS complex on the plasma membrane, provides the track for CCP hopping. Local diacylglycerol gradients generated upon exocytosis guide the direction of hopping. Overall, the CCP-cytoskeleton-lipid interaction demonstrated here mediates exocytosis-coupled fast recycling of both plasma membrane and vesicular proteins, and it is required for the sustained exocytosis during repetitive stimulations.

Abstract: Summary
The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway regulates cell differentiation and proliferation during development by controlling the Gli transcription factors. Cell fate decisions and progression toward organ and tissue maturity must be coordinated, and how an energy sensor regulates the Hh pathway is not clear. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an important sensor of energy stores and controls protein synthesis and other energy-intensive processes. AMPK is directly responsive to intracellular AMP levels, inhibiting a wide range of cell activities if ATP is low and AMP is high. Thus, AMPK can affect development by influencing protein synthesis and other processes needed for growth and differentiation. Activation of AMPK reduces GLI1 protein levels and stability, thus blocking Sonic-hedgehog-induced transcriptional activity. AMPK phosphorylates GLI1 at serines 102 and 408 and threonine 1074. Mutation of these three sites into alanine prevents phosphorylation by AMPK. This leads to increased GLI1 protein stability, transcriptional activity, and oncogenic potency.

Abstract: Summary
Selective autophagy eliminates protein aggregates, damaged organelles, and other targets that otherwise accumulate and cause disease. Autophagy receptors mediate selectivity by connecting targets to the autophagosome membrane. It has remained unknown whether receptors perform additional functions. Here, we show that in yeast certain receptor-bound targets activate Atg1, the kinase that controls autophagosome formation. Specifically, we found that in nutrient-rich conditions, Atg1 is active only in a multisubunit complex comprising constitutive protein aggregates, their autophagy receptor, and a scaffold protein, Atg11. Development of a cell-free assay for Atg1-mediated phosphorylation enabled us to activate Atg1 with purified receptor-bound aggregates and Atg11. Another target, damaged peroxisomes, also activated Atg1 using Atg11 with a distinct receptor. Our work reveals that receptor-target complexes activate Atg1 to drive formation of selective autophagosomes. This regulatory logic is a key similarity between selective autophagy and bulk autophagy, which is initiated by a distinct Atg1 activation mechanism during starvation.

Abstract: Summary
Endogenous formaldehyde is produced by numerous biochemical pathways fundamental to life, and it can crosslink both DNA and proteins. However, the consequences of its accumulation are unclear. Here we show that endogenous formaldehyde is removed by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase 5 (ADH5/GSNOR), and Adh5−/− mice therefore accumulate formaldehyde adducts in DNA. The repair of this damage is mediated by FANCD2, a DNA crosslink repair protein. Adh5−/−Fancd2−/− mice reveal an essential requirement for these protection mechanisms in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), leading to their depletion and precipitating bone marrow failure. More widespread formaldehyde-induced DNA damage also causes karyomegaly and dysfunction of hepatocytes and nephrons. Bone marrow transplantation not only rescued hematopoiesis but, surprisingly, also preserved nephron function. Nevertheless, all of these animals eventually developed fatal malignancies. Formaldehyde is therefore an important source of endogenous DNA damage that is counteracted in mammals by a conserved protection mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
Aging is associated with the decline of protein, cell, and organ function. Here, we use an integrated approach to characterize gene expression, bulk translation, and cell biology in the brains and livers of young and old rats. We identify 468 differences in protein abundance between young and old animals. The majority are a consequence of altered translation output, that is, the combined effect of changes in transcript abundance and translation efficiency. In addition, we identify 130 proteins whose overall abundance remains unchanged but whose sub-cellular localization, phosphorylation state, or splice-form varies. While some protein-level differences appear to be a generic property of the rats’ chronological age, the majority are specific to one organ. These may be a consequence of the organ’s physiology or the chronological age of the cells within the tissue. Taken together, our study provides an initial view of the proteome at the molecular, sub-cellular, and organ level in young and old rats.

Abstract: While increasing evidence indicates the important function of histone methylation during development, how this process influences cardiac development in vertebrates has not been explored. Here, we elucidate the functions of two histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation enzymes, SMYD3 and SETD7, during zebrafish heart morphogenesis using gene expression profiling by whole mount in situ hybridization and antisense morpholino oligonucleotide (MO)-based gene knockdown. We find both smyd3 and setd7 are highly expressed within developing zebrafish heart and knock-down of these genes led to severe defects in cardiac morphogenesis without altering the expressions pattern of heart markers, including cmlc2, vmhc, and amhc. Furthermore, double knock-down by coinjection of smyd3 and setd7 MOs caused the synergistic defects in heart development. As similar to knock-down effect, overexpression of these genes also caused the heart morphogenesis defect in zebrafish. These results indicate that histone modifying enzymes, SMYD3 and SETD7, appear to function synergistically during heart development and their proper functioning is essential for normal heart morphogenesis during development.

Abstract: Summary
Transcriptional mediators of cell stress pathways, including HIF1α, ATF4, and p53, are key to normal development and play critical roles in disease, including ischemia and cancer. Despite their importance, mechanisms by which pathways mediated by these transcription factors interact with one another are not fully understood. In addressing the controversial role of HIF1α in cardiomyocytes (CMs) during heart development, we discovered a mid-gestational requirement for HIF1α for proliferation of hypoxic CMs, involving metabolic switching and a complex interplay among HIF1α, ATF4, and p53. Loss of HIF1α resulted in activation of ATF4 and p53, the latter inhibiting CM proliferation. Bioinformatic and biochemical analyses revealed unexpected mechanisms by which HIF1α intersects with ATF4 and p53 pathways. Our results highlight previously undescribed roles of HIF1α and interactions among major cell stress pathways that could be targeted to enhance proliferation of CMs in ischemia and may have relevance to other diseases, including cancer.

Abstract: Long-acting nicotine is known to exert pathological effects on almost all tissues including the cerebellar cortex. The present work was designed to elucidate the effect of nicotine on the development of cerebellar cortex of chick embryo during incubation period. The fertilized eggs of hen (Gallus gallus domesticus) were injected into the air space by a single dose of long acting nicotine (1.6mg/kg/egg) at the 4th day of incubation. The embryos were taken out of the eggs on days 8, 12 and 16 of incubation. The cerebellum of the control and treated embryos at above ages were processed for histopathological examination. The TEM were examined at 16th day of incubation. The results of the present study revealed that, exposure to long-acting nicotine markedly influence the histogenesis of cerebellar cortex of chick embryo during the incubation period. At 8th day of incubation, nicotine delayed the differentiation of the cerebellar analge; especially the external granular layer (EGL) and inner cortical layer (ICL). Furthermore, at 12th day of incubation, the cerebellar foliation was irregular and the Purkinje cells not recognized. By 16th day of incubation, the cerebellar foliations were irregular with interrupted cerebellar cortex and irregular arrangement of Purkinje cells. Immunohistochemical analysis for antibody P53 protein revealed that the cerebellar cortex in all stages of nicotine treated groups possessed a moderate to weak reaction for P53 protein however; this reaction was markedly stronger in the cerebellar cortex of control groups. Moreover, the flow cytometric analysis confirmed that the percentage of apoptosis in control group was significantly higher compared with that of nicotine treated group. At the TEM level, the cerebellar Purkinje cells of 16th day of treated groups showed multiple subcellular alterations in compared with those of the corresponding control group. Such changes represented by appearing of vacuolated mitochondria, cisternal fragmentation of RER, irregular grooves of Golgi tubules. Also, multiple cytoplasmic vacuoles and aggregation of Nissl granules were recorded around pyknotic nucleus.

Abstract: Summary
Many organisms survive in constantly changing environments, including cycling seasons. Developing embryos show remarkable instant adaptations to the variable environmental challenges they encounter during their adult life, despite having no direct contact with the changing environment until after birth or hatching. The mechanisms by which such non-genetic information is transferred to the developing embryos are largely unknown. Here, we address this question by using a freshwater pond snail (Lymnaea stagnalis) as a model system. This snail normally lives in a seasonal climate, and the seasons define its locomotion, feeding, and reproductive behavior. We discovered that the serotonergic system plays a crucial role in transmitting a non-genetic instructive signal from mother to progeny. This maternal serotonin-based signal functions in embryos during a short time window at exclusively early pre-neural developmental stages and modulates the dynamics of embryonic and juvenile growth, feeding behavior, and locomotion.

Abstract: Summary
We report the preclinical evaluation of PF-06463922, a potent and brain-penetrant ALK/ROS1 inhibitor. Compared with other clinically available ALK inhibitors, PF-06463922 displayed superior potency against all known clinically acquired ALK mutations, including the highly resistant G1202R mutant. Furthermore, PF-06463922 treatment led to regression of EML4-ALK-driven brain metastases, leading to prolonged mouse survival, in a superior manner. Finally, PF-06463922 demonstrated high selectivity and safety margins in a variety of preclinical studies. These results suggest that PF-06463922 will be highly effective for the treatment of patients with ALK-driven lung cancers, including those who relapsed on clinically available ALK inhibitors because of secondary ALK kinase domain mutations and/or brain metastases.

Abstract: Summary
Responding to an influenza A virus (IAV) infection demands an effective intrinsic cellular defense strategy to slow replication. To identify contributing host factors to this defense, we exploited the host microRNA pathway to perform an in vivo RNAi screen. To this end, IAV, lacking a functional NS1 antagonist, was engineered to encode individual siRNAs against antiviral host genes in an effort to rescue attenuation. This screening platform resulted in the enrichment of strains targeting virus-activated transcription factors, specific antiviral effectors, and intracellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Interestingly, in addition to RIG-I, the PRR for IAV, a virus with the capacity to silence MDA5 also emerged as a dominant strain in wild-type, but not in MDA5-deficient mice. Transcriptional profiling of infected knockout cells confirmed RIG-I to be the primary PRR for IAV but implicated MDA5 as a significant contributor to the cellular defense against influenza A virus.

Abstract: Previously, we reported that Ca2+ depletion increased permeability of the plasma membrane for Na+. This study examined the relative impact of [Na+]i/[K+]i-mediated signaling on transcriptomic changes in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells from rat aorta (VSMC) subjected to Ca2+-depletion by extra-(EGTA) and intracellular (BAPTA-AM) Ca2+ chelators. Na+,K+-ATPase inhibition in K+-free medium during 3h led to elevation of [Na+]i and attenuation of [K+]i by ∼7- and 10-fold, whereas Ca2+-depletion resulted in alteration of these parameters by ∼3- and 2-fold, respectively. Augmented VSMC permeability for Na+ and elevation of the [Na+]i/[K+]i ratio was triggered by addition to Ca2+-free medium 50μM EGTA and was not affected by 10μM BAPTA-AM. Na+,K+-ATPase inhibition and Ca2+-depletion changed expression of 3677 and 4610 mRNA transcripts, respectively. We found highly significant (p<10−12) positive (R2>0.51) correlation between levels of expression of 2071 transcripts whose expression was affected by both stimuli. Among genes whose expression in Ca2+-depleted cells was augmented by more than 7-fold we noted cyclic AMP-dependent transcription factor Atf3, early growth response protein Egr1 and nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A member Nr4a1. Dissipation of transmembrane gradients of monovalent cations in high-K+, low-Na+-medium abolished the increments of the [Na+]i/[K+]i ratio as well as the augmented expression of these genes triggered by incubation of VSMC in EGTA containing medium. Thus, our results demonstrate, for the first time, that robust transcriptomic changes triggered by Ca2+-depletion in the presence of extracellular Ca2+-chelators are at least partially mediated by elevation of the [Na+]i/[K+]i ratio and activation of Ca2+i-independent, [Na+]i/[K+]i-mediated mechanism of excitation–transcription coupling. These results shad a new light on analysis of data obtained in cells subjected to long-term exposure to Ca2+ chelators.

Abstract: Summary
Several questions about the role of the oxygen sensor prolyl-hydroxylase 2 (PHD2) in cancer have not been addressed. First, the role of PHD2 in metastasis has not been studied in a spontaneous tumor model. Here, we show that global PHD2 haplodeficiency reduced metastasis without affecting tumor growth. Second, it is unknown whether PHD2 regulates cancer by affecting cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). We show that PHD2 haplodeficiency reduced metastasis via two mechanisms: (1) by decreasing CAF activation, matrix production, and contraction by CAFs, an effect that surprisingly relied on PHD2 deletion in cancer cells, but not in CAFs; and (2) by improving tumor vessel normalization. Third, the effect of concomitant PHD2 inhibition in malignant and stromal cells (mimicking PHD2 inhibitor treatment) is unknown. We show that global PHD2 haplodeficiency, induced not only before but also after tumor onset, impaired metastasis. These findings warrant investigation of PHD2’s therapeutic potential.

Pacemaker role of pericytes in generating synchronized spontaneous Ca2+ transients in the myenteric microvasculature of the guinea-pig gastric antrum,

Abstract: Properties of spontaneous Ca2+ transients in the myenteric microvasculature of the guinea-pig stomach were investigated. Specifically, we explored the spatio-temporal origin of Ca2+ transients and the role of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs) in their intercellular synchrony using fluorescence Ca2+ imaging and immunohistochemistry. The microvasculature generated spontaneous Ca2+ transients that were independent of both Ca2+ transients in interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) and neural activity. Spontaneous Ca2+ transients were highly synchronous along the length of microvasculature, and appeared to be initiated in pericytes and spread to arteriolar smooth muscle cells (SMCs). In most cases, the generation or synchrony of Ca2+ transients was not affected by blockers of L-type VDCCs. In nifedipine-treated preparations, synchronous spontaneous Ca2+ transients were readily blocked by Ni2+, mibefradil or ML216, blockers for T-type VDCCs. These blockers also suppressed the known T-type VDCC dependent component of ICC Ca2+ transients or slow waves. Spontaneous Ca2+ transients were also suppressed by caffeine, tetracaine or cyclopiazonic acid (CPA). After the blockade of both L- and T-type VDCCs, asynchronous Ca2+ transients were generated in pericytes on precapillary arterioles and/or capillaries but not in arteriolar SMCs, and were abolished by CPA or nominally Ca2+ free solution. Together these data indicate that pericytes in the myenteric microvasculature may act as the origin of synchronous spontaneous Ca2+ transients. Pericyte Ca2+ transients arise from Ca2+ release from the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum and the opening of T-type Ca2+ VDCCs is required for their synchrony and propagation to arteriolar SMCs.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial permeability transition is a phenomenon in which the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) abruptly opens, resulting in mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) dissipation, loss of ATP production, and cell death. Several genetic candidates have been proposed to form the PTP complex, however, the core component is unknown. We identified a necessary and conserved role for spastic paraplegia 7 (SPG7) in Ca2+- and ROS-induced PTP opening using RNAi-based screening. Loss of SPG7 resulted in higher mitochondrial Ca2+ retention, similar to cyclophilin D (CypD, PPIF) knockdown with sustained ΔΨm during both Ca2+ and ROS stress. Biochemical analyses revealed that the PTP is a heterooligomeric complex composed of VDAC, SPG7, and CypD. Silencing or disruption of SPG7-CypD binding prevented Ca2+- and ROS-induced ΔΨm depolarization and cell death. This study identifies an ubiquitously expressed IMM integral protein, SPG7, as a core component of the PTP at the OMM and IMM contact site.

Abstract: Summary
Glucose, the main energy substrate used in the CNS, is continuously supplied by the periphery. Glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter, is foreseen as a complementary energy contributor in the brain. In particular, astrocytes actively take up glutamate and may use it through oxidative glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) activity. Here, we investigated the significance of glutamate as energy substrate for the brain. Upon glutamate exposure, astrocytes generated ATP in a GDH-dependent way. The observed lack of glutamate oxidation in brain-specific GDH null CnsGlud1−/− mice resulted in a central energy-deprivation state with increased ADP/ATP ratios and phospho-AMPK in the hypothalamus. This induced changes in the autonomous nervous system balance, with increased sympathetic activity promoting hepatic glucose production and mobilization of substrates reshaping peripheral energy stores. Our data reveal the importance of glutamate as necessary energy substrate for the brain and the role of central GDH in the regulation of whole-body energy homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
During cell division, polarized epithelial cells employ mechanisms to preserve cell polarity and tissue integrity. In dividing cells of the mammalian skin, planar cell polarity (PCP) is maintained through the bulk internalization, equal segregation, and polarized recycling of cortical PCP proteins. The dramatic redistribution of PCP proteins coincides precisely with cell-cycle progression, but the mechanisms coordinating PCP and mitosis are unknown. Here we identify Plk1 as a master regulator of PCP dynamics during mitosis. Plk1 interacts with core PCP component Celsr1 via a conserved polo-box domain (PBD)-binding motif, localizes to mitotic endosomes, and directly phosphorylates Celsr1. Plk1-dependent phosphorylation activates the endocytic motif specifically during mitosis, allowing bulk recruitment of Celsr1 into endosomes. Inhibiting Plk1 activity blocks PCP internalization and perturbs PCP asymmetry. Mimicking dileucine motif phosphorylation is sufficient to drive Celsr1 internalization during interphase. Thus, Plk1-mediated phosphorylation of Celsr1 ensures that PCP redistribution is precisely coordinated with mitotic entry.

Abstract: We investigated the role of HDAC3 in anti-cancer drug-resistance. The expression of HDAC3 was decreased in cancer cell lines resistant to anti-cancer drugs such as celastrol and taxol. HDAC3 conferred sensitivity to these anti-cancer drugs. HDAC3 activity was necessary for conferring sensitivity to these anti-cancer drugs. The down-regulation of HDAC3 increased the expression of MDR1 and conferred resistance to anti-cancer drugs. The expression of tubulin β3 was increased in drug-resistant cancer cell lines. ChIP assays showed the binding of HDAC3 to the promoter sequences of tubulin β3 and HDAC6. HDAC6 showed an interaction with tubulin β3. HDAC3 had a negative regulatory role in the expression of tubulin β3 and HDAC6. The down-regulation of HDAC6 decreased the expression of MDR1 and tubulin β3, but did not affect HDAC3 expression. The down-regulation of HDAC6 conferred sensitivity to taxol. The down-regulation of tubulin β3 did not affect the expression of HDAC6 or MDR1. The down-regulation of tubulin β3 conferred sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs. Our results showed that tubulin β3 serves as a downstream target of HDAC3 and mediates resistance to microtubule-targeting drugs. Thus, the HDAC3-HDAC6-Tubulin β axis can be employed for the development of anti-cancer drugs.

Abstract: Summary
Primary cilia interpret vertebrate Hedgehog (Hh) signals. Why cilia are essential for signaling is unclear. One possibility is that some forms of signaling require a distinct membrane lipid composition, found at cilia. We found that the ciliary membrane contains a particular phosphoinositide, PI(4)P, whereas a different phosphoinositide, PI(4,5)P2, is restricted to the membrane of the ciliary base. This distribution is created by Inpp5e, a ciliary phosphoinositide 5-phosphatase. Without Inpp5e, ciliary PI(4,5)P2 levels are elevated and Hh signaling is disrupted. Inpp5e limits the ciliary levels of inhibitors of Hh signaling, including Gpr161 and the PI(4,5)P2-binding protein Tulp3. Increasing ciliary PI(4,5)P2 levels or conferring the ability to bind PI(4)P on Tulp3 increases the ciliary localization of Tulp3. Lowering Tulp3 in cells lacking Inpp5e reduces ciliary Gpr161 levels and restores Hh signaling. Therefore, Inpp5e regulates ciliary membrane phosphoinositide composition, and Tulp3 reads out ciliary phosphoinositides to control ciliary protein localization, enabling Hh signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Bariatric surgery is currently the most effective procedure for the treatment of obesity. Given the role of the gut microbiota in regulating host metabolism and adiposity, we investigated the long-term effects of bariatric surgery on the microbiome of patients randomized to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or vertical banded gastroplasty and matched for weight and fat mass loss. The two surgical procedures induced similar and durable changes on the gut microbiome that were not dependent on body mass index and resulted in altered levels of fecal and circulating metabolites compared with obese controls. By colonizing germ-free mice with stools from the patients, we demonstrated that the surgically altered microbiota promoted reduced fat deposition in recipient mice. These mice also had a lower respiratory quotient, indicating decreased utilization of carbohydrates as fuel. Our results suggest that the gut microbiota may play a direct role in the reduction of adiposity observed after bariatric surgery.

Abstract: Summary
Efficient regeneration following injury is critical for maintaining tissue function and enabling organismal survival. Cells reconstituting damaged tissue are often generated from resident stem or progenitor cells or from cells that have dedifferentiated and become proliferative. While lineage-tracing studies have defined cellular sources of regeneration in many tissues, the process by which these cells execute the regenerative process is largely obscure. Here, we have identified tissue-resident progenitor cells that mediate regeneration of zebrafish stripe melanocytes and defined how these cells reconstitute pigmentation. Nearly all regeneration melanocytes arise through direct differentiation of progenitor cells. Wnt signaling is activated prior to differentiation, and inhibition of Wnt signaling impairs regeneration. Additional progenitors divide symmetrically to sustain the pool of progenitor cells. Combining direct differentiation with symmetric progenitor divisions may serve as a means to rapidly repair injured tissue while preserving the capacity to regenerate.

Abstract: During myocardial ischemia and reperfusion both purines and pyrimidines are released into the extracellular milieu, thus creating a signaling wave that propagates to neighboring cells via membrane-bound P2 purinoceptors activation. Cardiac fibroblasts (CF) are important players in heart remodeling, electrophysiological changes and hemodynamic alterations following myocardial infarction. Here, we investigated the role UTP on calcium signaling and proliferation of CF cultured from ventricles of adult rats. Co-expression of discoidin domain receptor 2 and α-smooth muscle actin indicate that cultured CF are activated myofibroblasts. Intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) signals were monitored in cells loaded with Fluo-4 NW. CF proliferation was evaluated by the MTT assay. UTP and the selective P2Y4 agonist, MRS4062, caused a fast desensitizing [Ca2+]i rise originated from thapsigargin-sensitive internal stores, which partially declined to a plateau providing the existence of Ca2+ in the extracellular fluid. The biphasic [Ca2+]i response to UTP was attenuated respectively by P2Y4 blockers, like reactive blue-2 and suramin, and by the P2Y11 antagonist, NF340. UTP and the P2Y2 receptor agonist MRS2768 increased, whereas the selective P2Y11 agonist NF546 decreased, CF growth; MRS4062 was ineffective. Blockage of the P2Y11 receptor or its coupling to adenylate cyclase boosted UTP-induced CF proliferation. Confocal microscopy and Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of P2Y2, P2Y4 and P2Y11 receptors. Data indicate that besides P2Y4 and P2Y2 receptors which are responsible for UTP-induced [Ca2+]i transients and growth of CF, respectively, synchronous activation of the previously unrecognized P2Y11 receptor may represent an important target for anti-fibrotic intervention in cardiac remodeling.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the remarkable clinical response of melanoma harboring BRAF mutations to BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi), most tumors become resistant. Here, we identified the downregulation of the ubiquitin ligase RNF125 in BRAFi-resistant melanomas and demonstrated its role in intrinsic and adaptive resistance to BRAFi in cultures as well as its association with resistance in tumor specimens. Sox10/MITF expression correlated with and contributed to RNF125 transcription. Reduced RNF125 was associated with elevated expression of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including EGFR. Notably, RNF125 altered RTK expression through JAK1, which we identified as an RNF125 substrate. RNF125 bound to and ubiquitinated JAK1, prompting its degradation and suppressing RTK expression. Inhibition of JAK1 and EGFR signaling overcame BRAFi resistance in melanoma with reduced RNF125 expression, as shown in culture and in in vivo xenografts. Our findings suggest that combination therapies targeting both JAK1 and EGFR could be effective against BRAFi-resistant tumors with de novo low RNF125 expression.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a central role in most aging-related diseases. ROS are produced at the respiratory chain that demands NADH for electron transport and are eliminated by enzymes that require NADPH. The nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (Nnt) is considered a key antioxidative enzyme based on its ability to regenerate NADPH from NADH. Here, we show that pathological metabolic demand reverses the direction of the Nnt, consuming NADPH to support NADH and ATP production, but at the cost of NADPH-linked antioxidative capacity. In heart, reverse-mode Nnt is the dominant source for ROS during pressure overload. Due to a mutation of the Nnt gene, the inbred mouse strain C57BL/6J is protected from oxidative stress, heart failure, and death, making its use in cardiovascular research problematic. Targeting Nnt-mediated ROS with the tetrapeptide SS-31 rescued mortality in pressure overload-induced heart failure and could therefore have therapeutic potential in patients with this syndrome.

Abstract: Summary
s-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is the sole methyl donor modifying histones, nucleic acids, and phospholipids. Its fluctuation affects hepatic phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis or may be linked to variations in DNA or histone methylation. Physiologically, low SAM is associated with lipid accumulation, tissue injury, and immune responses in fatty liver disease. However, molecular connections among SAM limitation, methyltransferases, and disease-associated phenotypes are unclear. We find that low SAM can activate or attenuate Caenorhabditis elegans immune responses. Immune pathways are stimulated downstream of PC production on a non-pathogenic diet. In contrast, distinct SAM-dependent mechanisms limit survival on pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa. C. elegans undertakes a broad transcriptional response to pathogens and we find that low SAM restricts H3K4me3 at Pseudomonas-responsive promoters, limiting their expression. Furthermore, this response depends on the H3K4 methyltransferase set-16/MLL. Thus, our studies provide molecular links between SAM and innate immune functions and suggest that SAM depletion may limit stress-induced gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
The endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) is a retrograde lipid messenger that modulates synaptic function, neurophysiology, and behavior. 2-AG signaling is terminated by enzymatic hydrolysis—a reaction that is principally performed by monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL). MAGL is broadly expressed throughout the nervous system, and the contributions of different brain cell types to the regulation of 2-AG activity in vivo remain poorly understood. Here, we genetically dissect the cellular anatomy of MAGL-mediated 2-AG metabolism in the brain and show that neurons and astrocytes coordinately regulate 2-AG content and endocannabinoid-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity and behavior. We also find that astrocytic MAGL is mainly responsible for converting 2-AG to neuroinflammatory prostaglandins via a mechanism that may involve transcellular shuttling of lipid substrates. Astrocytic-neuronal interplay thus provides distributed oversight of 2-AG metabolism and function and, through doing so, protects the nervous system from excessive CB1 receptor activation and promotes endocannabinoid crosstalk with other lipid transmitter systems.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we survey variation and dynamics of active regulatory elements genome-wide using longitudinal samples from human individuals. We applied Assay of Transposase Accessible Chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq) to map chromatin accessibility in primary CD4+ T cells isolated from standard blood draws from 12 healthy volunteers over time, from cancer patients, and during T-cell activation. Over 4,000 predicted regulatory elements (7.2%) showed reproducible variation in accessibility between individuals. Gender was the most significant attributable source of variation. ATAC-seq revealed previously undescribed elements that escape X chromosome inactivation and predicted gender-specific gene regulatory networks across autosomes, which coordinately affect genes with immune function. Noisy regulatory elements with personal variation in accessibility are significantly enriched for autoimmune disease loci. Over one third of regulome variation lacked genetic variation in cis, suggesting contributions from environmental or epigenetic factors. These results refine concepts of human individuality and provide a foundational reference for comparing disease-associated regulomes.

Abstract: Cl− efflux through Ca2+-activated Cl− channels (CaCCs) in secretory epithelial cells plays a key role in the regulation of fluid secretion. The fluid and electrolyte secretion is closely related to intracellular pH. CaCCs have been known to be inhibited by intracellular acid. However, the molecular mechanism for the inhibition remains unknown. Anoctamin 1 (ANO1) is a Ca2+-activated Cl− channel that mediates numerous physiological functions including fluid secretion in secretory epithelia. However, little is known about whether ANO1 can be modulated by change of intracellular pH. Here, we demonstrate that Ca2+-induced activation of ANO1 and its homolog ANO2 are strongly inhibited by intracellular acid. Intracellular acid caused a rightward shift of the concentration-response curve of Ca2+ in activating ANO1 and ANO2. To identify the location of the acid-induced inhibition, mutations were made on each of all histidine residues in cytoplasmic part of ANO1. However, none of the His-mutant showed the reduction in the acid-induced inhibition. Furthermore, mutation on Glu- or Asp-residues in the multiple acidic-amino acid regions was ineffective in blocking the acid-induced inhibition. Because the Ca2+-binding site of a fungal anoctamin (nhTMEM16) was uncovered by crystallography, mutagenesis was performed in this region. Surprisingly, mutations at Glu, Asp or Asn residues in the hydrophobic core that are known to be essential for Ca2+-induced activation of ANO1 blocked the acid-induced inhibition. These results suggest that protons interfere with Ca2+ at the Ca2+ binding site of ANO1. These findings provide a molecular mechanism underlying the acid-induced inhibition of ANO1, which may contribute to control fluid and electrolyte secretion in the secretory epithelia.

Abstract: Summary
Interruption of the coronary blood supply severely impairs heart function with often fatal consequences for patients. However, the formation and maturation of these coronary vessels is not fully understood. Here we provide a detailed analysis of coronary vessel development in zebrafish. We observe that coronary vessels form in zebrafish by angiogenic sprouting of arterial cells derived from the endocardium at the atrioventricular canal. Endothelial cells express the CXC-motif chemokine receptor Cxcr4a and migrate to vascularize the ventricle under the guidance of the myocardium-expressed ligand Cxcl12b. cxcr4a mutant zebrafish fail to form a vascular network, whereas ectopic expression of Cxcl12b ligand induces coronary vessel formation. Importantly, cxcr4a mutant zebrafish fail to undergo heart regeneration following injury. Our results suggest that chemokine signaling has an essential role in coronary vessel formation by directing migration of endocardium-derived endothelial cells. Poorly developed vasculature in cxcr4a mutants likely underlies decreased regenerative potential in adults.

Abstract: Summary
Histone variants are emerging as key regulatory molecules in cancer. We report a unique role for the H2A.Z isoform H2A.Z.2 as a driver of malignant melanoma. H2A.Z.2 is highly expressed in metastatic melanoma, correlates with decreased patient survival, and is required for cellular proliferation. Our integrated genomic analyses reveal that H2A.Z.2 controls the transcriptional output of E2F target genes in melanoma cells. These genes are highly expressed and display a distinct signature of H2A.Z occupancy. We identify BRD2 as an H2A.Z-interacting protein, levels of which are also elevated in melanoma. We further demonstrate that H2A.Z.2-regulated genes are bound by BRD2 and E2F1 in an H2A.Z.2-dependent manner. Importantly, H2A.Z.2 deficiency sensitizes melanoma cells to chemotherapy and targeted therapies. Collectively, our findings implicate H2A.Z.2 as a mediator of cell proliferation and drug sensitivity in malignant melanoma, holding translational potential for novel therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: Gintonin is a novel ginseng-derived lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor ligand. Oral administration of gintonin ameliorates learning and memory dysfunctions in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) animal models. The brain cholinergic system plays a key role in cognitive functions. The brains of AD patients show a reduction in acetylcholine concentration caused by cholinergic system impairments. However, little is known about the role of LPA in the cholinergic system. In this study, we used gintonin to investigate the effect of LPA receptor activation on the cholinergic system in vitro and in vivo using wild-type and AD animal models. Gintonin induced [Ca2+]i transient in cultured mouse hippocampal neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Gintonin-mediated [Ca2+]i transients were linked to stimulation of acetylcholine release through LPA receptor activation. Oral administration of gintonin-enriched fraction (25, 50, or 100 mg/kg, 3 weeks) significantly attenuated scopolamine-induced memory impairment. Oral administration of gintonin (25 or 50 mg/kg, 2 weeks) also significantly attenuated amyloid-β protein (Aβ)-induced cholinergic dysfunctions, such as decreased acetylcholine concentration, decreased choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity and immunoreactivity, and increased acetylcholine esterase (AChE) activity. In a transgenic AD mouse model, long-term oral administration of gintonin (25 or 50 mg/kg, 3 months) also attenuated AD-related cholinergic impairments. In this study, we showed that activation of G protein-coupled LPA receptors by gintonin is coupled to the regulation of cholinergic functions. Furthermore, this study showed that gintonin could be a novel agent for the restoration of cholinergic system damages due to Aβ and could be utilized for AD prevention or therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the mechanisms of androgen receptor (AR) activation in the milieu of low androgen is critical to effective treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Here, we report HOTAIR as an androgen-repressed lncRNA, and, as such, it is markedly upregulated following androgen deprivation therapies and in CRPC. We further demonstrate a distinct mode of lncRNA-mediated gene regulation, wherein HOTAIR binds to the AR protein to block its interaction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2, thereby preventing AR ubiquitination and protein degradation. Consequently, HOTAIR expression is sufficient to induce androgen-independent AR activation and drive the AR-mediated transcriptional program in the absence of androgen. Functionally, HOTAIR overexpression increases, whereas HOTAIR knockdown decreases, prostate cancer cell growth and invasion. Taken together, our results provide compelling evidence of lncRNAs as drivers of androgen-independent AR activity and CRPC progression, and they support the potential of lncRNAs as therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Summary
Woolly mammoths and living elephants are characterized by major phenotypic differences that have allowed them to live in very different environments. To identify the genetic changes that underlie the suite of woolly mammoth adaptations to extreme cold, we sequenced the nuclear genome from three Asian elephants and two woolly mammoths, and we identified and functionally annotated genetic changes unique to woolly mammoths. We found that genes with mammoth-specific amino acid changes are enriched in functions related to circadian biology, skin and hair development and physiology, lipid metabolism, adipose development and physiology, and temperature sensation. Finally, we resurrected and functionally tested the mammoth and ancestral elephant TRPV3 gene, which encodes a temperature-sensitive transient receptor potential (thermoTRP) channel involved in thermal sensation and hair growth, and we show that a single mammoth-specific amino acid substitution in an otherwise highly conserved region of the TRPV3 channel strongly affects its temperature sensitivity.

Abstract: A variant peak was detected in the analysis of RP-HPLC of rHu-EPO, which has about 7% relative content. Fractions of the main and the variant peaks were pooled separately and further analyzed to identify the molecular structure of the variant peak. Total mass analysis for each peak fraction using ESI-TOF MS shows differences in molecular mass. The fraction of the main peak tends to result in higher molecular masses than the fraction of the variant. The detected masses for the variant are about 600–1000 Da smaller than those for the main peak. Peptide mapping analysis for each peak fraction using Asp-N and Glu-C shows differences in O-glycopeptide profiles at Ser126. The O-glycopeptides were not detected in the fraction of the variant. It is concluded that the variant peak is non-O-glycosylated rHu-EPO and the main peak is fully O-glycosylated rHu-EPO at Ser126.

Abstract: Summary
S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) link one-carbon metabolism to methylation status. However, it is unknown whether regulation of SAM and SAH by nutrient availability can be directly sensed to alter the kinetics of key histone methylation marks. We provide evidence that the status of methionine metabolism is sufficient to determine levels of histone methylation by modulating SAM and SAH. This dynamic interaction led to rapid changes in H3K4me3, altered gene transcription, provided feedback regulation to one-carbon metabolism, and could be fully recovered upon restoration of methionine. Modulation of methionine in diet led to changes in metabolism and histone methylation in the liver. In humans, methionine variability in fasting serum was commensurate with concentrations needed for these dynamics and could be partly explained by diet. Together these findings demonstrate that flux through methionine metabolism and the sensing of methionine availability may allow direct communication to the chromatin state in cells.

Abstract: Summary
Cocaine is a highly addictive drug that acts upon the brain’s reward circuitry via the inhibition of monoamine uptake. Endogenous cannabinoids (eCB) are lipid molecules released from midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons that modulate cocaine’s effects through poorly understood mechanisms. We find that cocaine stimulates release of the eCB, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), in the rat ventral midbrain to suppress GABAergic inhibition of DA neurons, through activation of presynaptic cannabinoid CB1 receptors. Cocaine mobilizes 2-AG via inhibition of norepinephrine uptake and promotion of a cooperative interaction between Gq/11-coupled type-1 metabotropic glutamate and α1-adrenergic receptors to stimulate internal calcium stores and activate phospholipase C. The disinhibition of DA neurons by cocaine-mobilized 2-AG is also functionally relevant because it augments DA release in the nucleus accumbens in vivo. Our results identify a mechanism through which the eCB system can regulate the rewarding and addictive properties of cocaine.

Abstract: Summary
Since 2013, avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses have diversified into multiple lineages by dynamically reassorting with other viruses, especially H9N2, in Chinese poultry. Despite concerns about the pandemic threat posed by H7N9 viruses, little is known about the biological properties of H7N9 viruses that may recruit internal genes from genetically distinct H9N2 viruses circulating among wild birds. Here, we generated 63 H7N9 reassortants derived from an avian H7N9 and a wild-bird-origin H9N2 virus. Compared with the wild-type parent, 25/63 reassortants had increased pathogenicity in mice. A reassortant containing PB1 of the H9N2 virus was highly lethal to mice and chickens but was not transmissible to guinea pigs by airborne routes; however, three substitutions associated with adaptation to mammals conferred airborne transmission to the virus. The emergence of the H7N9-pandemic reassortant virus highlights that continuous monitoring of H7N9 viruses is needed, especially at the domestic poultry/wild bird interface.

Abstract: Summary
Elucidating the individual and collaborative functions of genome maintenance factors is critical for understanding how genome duplication is achieved. Here, we investigate a conserved scaffold in budding yeast, Rtt107, and its three partners: a SUMO E3 complex, a ubiquitin E3 complex, and Slx4. Biochemical and genetic findings show that Rtt107 interacts separately with these partners and contributes to their individual functions, including a role in replisome sumoylation. We also provide evidence that Rtt107 associates with replisome components, and both itself and its associated E3s are important for replicating regions far from initiation sites. Corroborating these results, replication defects due to Rtt107 loss and genotoxic sensitivities in mutants of Rtt107 and its associated E3s are rescued by increasing replication initiation events through mutating two master repressors of late origins, Mrc1 and Mec1. These findings suggest that Rtt107 functions as a multi-functional platform to support replication progression with its partner E3 enzymes.

Abstract: Summary
Endosomal protein recycling is a fundamental cellular process important for cellular homeostasis, signaling, and fate determination that is implicated in several diseases. WASH is an actin-nucleating protein essential for this process, and its activity is controlled through K63-linked ubiquitination by the MAGE-L2-TRIM27 ubiquitin ligase. Here, we show that the USP7 deubiquitinating enzyme is an integral component of the MAGE-L2-TRIM27 ligase and is essential for WASH-mediated endosomal actin assembly and protein recycling. Mechanistically, USP7 acts as a molecular rheostat to precisely fine-tune endosomal F-actin levels by counteracting TRIM27 auto-ubiquitination/degradation and preventing overactivation of WASH through directly deubiquitinating it. Importantly, we identify de novo heterozygous loss-of-function mutations of USP7 in individuals with a neurodevelopmental disorder, featuring intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. These results provide unanticipated insights into endosomal trafficking, illuminate the cooperativity between an ubiquitin ligase and a deubiquitinating enzyme, and establish a role for USP7 in human neurodevelopmental disease.

Abstract: Summary
Taxol and other antimitotic agents are frontline chemotherapy agents but the mechanisms responsible for patient benefit remain unclear. Following a genome-wide siRNA screen, we identified the oncogenic transcription factor Myc as a taxol sensitizer. Using time-lapse imaging to correlate mitotic behavior with cell fate, we show that Myc sensitizes cells to mitotic blockers and agents that accelerate mitotic progression. Myc achieves this by upregulating a cluster of redundant pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins and suppressing pro-survival Bcl-xL. Gene expression analysis of breast cancers indicates that taxane responses correlate positively with Myc and negatively with Bcl-xL. Accordingly, pharmacological inhibition of Bcl-xL restores apoptosis in Myc-deficient cells. These results open up opportunities for biomarkers and combination therapies that could enhance traditional and second-generation antimitotic agents.

Abstract: Summary
AMPK is a master regulator of cellular metabolism that exerts either oncogenic or tumor suppressor activity depending on context. Here, we report that the specific AMPK agonist GSK621 selectively kills acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells but spares normal hematopoietic progenitors. This differential sensitivity results from a unique synthetic lethal interaction involving concurrent activation of AMPK and mTORC1. Strikingly, the lethality of GSK621 in primary AML cells and AML cell lines is abrogated by chemical or genetic ablation of mTORC1 signaling. The same synthetic lethality between AMPK and mTORC1 activation is established in CD34-positive hematopoietic progenitors by constitutive activation of AKT or enhanced in AML cells by deletion of TSC2. Finally, cytotoxicity in AML cells from GSK621 involves the eIF2α/ATF4 signaling pathway that specifically results from mTORC1 activation. AMPK activation may represent a therapeutic opportunity in mTORC1-overactivated cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin have been linked to familial Parkinson’s disease. Parkin has also been implicated in mitosis through mechanisms that are unclear. Here we show that Parkin interacts with anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) coactivators Cdc20 and Cdh1 to mediate the degradation of several key mitotic regulators independent of APC/C. We demonstrate that ordered progression through mitosis is orchestrated by two distinct E3 ligases through the shared use of Cdc20 and Cdh1. Furthermore, Parkin is phosphorylated and activated by polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) during mitosis. Parkin deficiency results in overexpression of its substrates, mitotic defects, genomic instability, and tumorigenesis. These results suggest that the Parkin-Cdc20/Cdh1 complex is an important regulator of mitosis.

Abstract: Summary
Monocytes are heterogeneous effector cells involved in the maintenance and restoration of tissue integrity. However, their response to hyperlipidemia remains poorly understood. Here, we report that in the presence of elevated levels of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, induced by administration of poloxamer 407, the blood numbers of non-classical Ly6C/Gr1low monocytes drop, while the number of bone marrow progenitors remains similar. We observed an increased crawling and retention of the Gr1low monocytes at the endothelial interface and a marked accumulation of CD68+ macrophages in several organs. Hypertriglyceridemia was accompanied by an increased expression of tissue, and plasma CCL4 and blood Gr1low monocyte depletion involved a pertussis-toxin-sensitive receptor axis. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that a triglyceride-rich environment can alter blood monocyte distribution, promoting the extravasation of Gr1low cells. The behavior of these cells in response to dyslipidemia highlights the significant impact that high levels of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins may have on innate immune cells.

Abstract: Summary
Epithelial cells undergo dynamic polarity changes as organs pattern, but the relationship between epithelial polarity and cell fate is poorly understood. Using the developing lung as a model, we found that distinct alterations in apical-basal polarity dictate airway epithelial differentiation. We demonstrate that Crb3, a Crumbs isoform that determines epithelial apical domain identity, is required for airway differentiation by controlling the localization of the transcriptional regulator Yap. We show that Crb3 promotes the interaction between Yap and the Hippo pathway kinases Lats1/2 at apical cell junctions to induce Yap phosphorylation and cytoplasmic retention, which drive cell differentiation. Loss of Crb3 in developing mouse airways or isolated adult airway progenitors results in unrestricted nuclear Yap activity and consequent cell differentiation defects. Our findings demonstrate that polarity-dependent cues control airway cell differentiation, offering important molecular insights into organ patterning.

Abstract: Summary
The regulation of RagAGTP is important for amino-acid-induced mTORC1 activation. Although GATOR1 complex has been identified as a negative regulator for mTORC1 by hydrolyzing RagAGTP, how GATOR1 is recruited to RagA to attenuate mTORC1 signaling remains unclear. Moreover, how mTORC1 signaling is terminated upon amino acid stimulation is also unknown. We show that the recruitment of GATOR1 to RagA is induced by amino acids in an mTORC1-dependent manner. Skp2 E3 ligase drives K63-linked ubiquitination of RagA, which facilitates GATOR1 recruitment and RagAGTP hydrolysis, thereby providing a negative feedback loop to attenuate mTORC1 lysosomal recruitment and prevent mTORC1 hyperactivation. We further demonstrate that Skp2 promotes autophagy but inhibits cell size and cilia growth through RagA ubiquitination and mTORC1 inhibition. We thereby propose a negative feedback whereby Skp2-mediated RagA ubiquitination recruits GATOR1 to restrict mTORC1 signaling upon sustained amino acid stimulation, which serves a critical mechanism to maintain proper cellular functions.

Abstract: Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA), which encodes the lysosomal enzyme glucosylceramidase (GCase). Deficiency in GCase leads to characteristic visceral pathology and lethal neurological manifestations in some patients. Investigations into neurogenesis have suggested that neurodegenerative disorders, such as GD, could be overcome or at least ameliorated by the generation of new neurons. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) are potential candidates for use in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders because of their ability to promote neurogenesis. Our objective was to examine the mechanism of neurogenesis by BM-MSCs in GD. We found that neural stem cells (NSCs) derived from a neuronopathic GD model exhibited decreased ability for self-renewal and neuronal differentiation. Co-culture of GBA-deficient NSCs with BM-MSCs resulted in an enhanced capacity for self-renewal, and an increased ability for differentiation into neurons or oligodendrocytes. Enhanced proliferation and neuronal differentiation of GBA-deficient NSCs was associated with elevated release of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) from BM-MSCs. Our findings suggest that soluble M-CSF derived from BM-MSCs can modulate GBA-deficient NSCs, resulting in their improved proliferation and neuronal differentiation.

Abstract: Rice is a model plant widely used for basic and applied research programs. Plant cell wall proteins play key roles in a broad range of biological processes. However, presently, knowledge on the rice cell wall proteome is rudimentary in nature. In the present study, the tightly-bound cell wall proteome of rice callus cultured cells using sequential extraction protocols was developed using mass spectrometry and bioinformatics methods, leading to the identification of 1568 candidate proteins. Based on bioinformatics analyses, 389 classical rice cell wall proteins, possessing a signal peptide, and 334 putative non-classical cell wall proteins, lacking a signal peptide, were identified. By combining previously established rice cell wall protein databases with current data for the classical rice cell wall proteins, a comprehensive rice cell wall proteome, comprised of 496 proteins, was constructed. A comparative analysis of the rice and Arabidopsis cell wall proteomes revealed a high level of homology, suggesting a predominant conservation between monocot and eudicot cell wall proteins. This study importantly increased information on cell wall proteins, which serves for future functional analyses of these identified rice cell wall proteins.

Abstract: The ultrastructural organization of the spermatozoon of the digenean Lecithostaphylus retroflexus (Microphalloidea: Zoogonidae) was described. Alive digeneans were collected from Belone belone gracilis (Teleostei: Belonidae), caught from the Gulf of Gabès in Chebba (Tunisia). The mature spermatozoon of L. retroflexus exhibits two axonemes of different lengths with the 9+‘1’ Trepaxonematan pattern, a nucleus, two mitochondria, two bundles of parallel cortical microtubules and granules of glycogen. Additionally, the spermatozoon of L. retroflexus shows type 2 of the external ornamentation according to Quilichini et al. (2011), spine-like bodies and a continuous and submembranous layer of parallel cortical microtubules surrounding the axonemes at their anterior end. Moreover, the morphology of the posterior spermatozoon extremity in L. retroflexus corresponds to the fasciolidean type according to Quilichini et al. (2010).

Abstract: Summary
The role of inflammation in obesity-related pathologies is well established. We investigated the therapeutic potential of LipoxinA4 (LXA4:5(S),6(R),15(S)-trihydroxy-7E,9E,11Z,13E,-eicosatetraenoic acid) and a synthetic 15(R)-Benzo-LXA4-analog as interventions in a 3-month high-fat diet (HFD; 60% fat)-induced obesity model. Obesity caused distinct pathologies, including impaired glucose tolerance, adipose inflammation, fatty liver, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Lipoxins (LXs) attenuated obesity-induced CKD, reducing glomerular expansion, mesangial matrix, and urinary H2O2. Furthermore, LXA4 reduced liver weight, serum alanine-aminotransferase, and hepatic triglycerides. LXA4 decreased obesity-induced adipose inflammation, attenuating TNF-α and CD11c+ M1-macrophages (MΦs), while restoring CD206+ M2-MΦs and increasing Annexin-A1. LXs did not affect renal or hepatic MΦs, suggesting protection occurred via attenuation of adipose inflammation. LXs restored adipose expression of autophagy markers LC3-II and p62. LX-mediated protection was demonstrable in adiponectin−/− mice, suggesting that the mechanism was adiponectin independent. In conclusion, LXs protect against obesity-induced systemic disease, and these data support a novel therapeutic paradigm for treating obesity and associated pathologies.

Abstract: Summary
The polymorphism ATG16L1 T300A, associated with increased risk of Crohn’s disease, impairs pathogen defense mechanisms including selective autophagy, but specific pathway interactions altered by the risk allele remain unknown. Here, we use perturbational profiling of human peripheral blood cells to reveal that CLEC12A is regulated in an ATG16L1-T300A-dependent manner. Antibacterial autophagy is impaired in CLEC12A-deficient cells, and this effect is exacerbated in the presence of the ATG16L1∗300A risk allele. Clec12a−/− mice are more susceptible to Salmonella infection, supporting a role for CLEC12A in antibacterial defense pathways in vivo. CLEC12A is recruited to sites of bacterial entry, bacteria-autophagosome complexes, and sites of sterile membrane damage. Integrated genomics identified a functional interaction between CLEC12A and an E3-ubiquitin ligase complex that functions in antibacterial autophagy. These data identify CLEC12A as early adaptor molecule for antibacterial autophagy and highlight perturbational profiling as a method to elucidate defense pathways in complex genetic disease.

Ursodeoxycholic Acid (UDCA) Exerts Anti-Atherogenic Effects by Inhibiting Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) Stress Induced by Disturbed Flow,

Abstract: Disturbed blood flow with low-oscillatory shear stress (OSS) is a predominant atherogenic factor leading to dysfunctional endothelial cells (ECs). Recently, it was found that disturbed flow can directly induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in ECs, thereby playing a critical role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), a naturally occurring bile acid, has long been used to treat chronic cholestatic liver disease and is known to alleviate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress at the cellular level. However, its role in atherosclerosis remains unexplored. In this study, we demonstrated the anti-atherogenic activity of UDCA via inhibition of disturbed flow-induced ER stress in atherosclerosis. UDCA effectively reduced ER stress, resulting in a reduction in expression of X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1) and CEBP-homologous protein (CHOP) in ECs. UDCA also inhibits the disturbed flow-induced inflammatory responses such as increases in adhesion molecules, monocyte adhesion to ECs, and apoptosis of ECs. In a mouse model of disturbed flow-induced atherosclerosis, UDCA inhibits atheromatous plaque formation through the alleviation of ER stress and a decrease in adhesion molecules. Taken together, our results revealed that UDCA exerts anti-atherogenic activity in disturbed flow-induced atherosclerosis by inhibiting ER stress and the inflammatory response. This study suggests that UDCA may be a therapeutic agent for prevention or treatment of atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer-driven granulo-monocytopoiesis stimulates expansion of tumor promoting myeloid populations, mostly myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). We identified subsets of MDSCs and TAMs based on the expression of retinoic-acid-related orphan receptor (RORC1/RORγ) in human and mouse tumor bearers. RORC1 orchestrates myelopoiesis by suppressing negative (Socs3 and Bcl3) and promoting positive (C/EBPβ) regulators of granulopoiesis, as well as the key transcriptional mediators of myeloid progenitor commitment and differentiation to the monocytic/macrophage lineage (IRF8 and PU.1). RORC1 supported tumor-promoting innate immunity by protecting MDSCs from apoptosis, mediating TAM differentiation and M2 polarization, and limiting tumor infiltration by mature neutrophils. Accordingly, ablation of RORC1 in the hematopoietic compartment prevented cancer-driven myelopoiesis, resulting in inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
The AXL receptor is a TAM (Tyro3, AXL, MerTK) receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) important in physiological inflammatory processes such as blood clotting, viral infection, and innate immune-mediated cell clearance. Overexpression of the receptor in a number of solid tumors is increasingly appreciated as a key drug resistance and tumor dissemination mechanism. Although the ligand-receptor (Gas6-AXL) complex structure is known, literature reports on ligand-mediated signaling have provided conflicting conclusions regarding the influence of other factors such as phosphatidylserine binding, and a detailed, mechanistic picture of AXL activation has not emerged. Integrating quantitative experiments with mathematical modeling, we show here that AXL operates to sense local spatial heterogeneity in ligand concentration, a feature consistent with its physiological role in inflammatory cell responses. This effect arises as a result of an intricate reaction-diffusion interaction. Our results demonstrate that AXL functions distinctly from other RTK families, a vital insight for the envisioned design of AXL-targeted therapeutic intervention.

Abstract: Summary
Within bacterial populations, a small fraction of persister cells is transiently capable of surviving exposure to lethal doses of antibiotics. As a bet-hedging strategy, persistence levels are determined both by stochastic induction and by environmental stimuli called responsive diversification. Little is known about the mechanisms that link the low frequency of persisters to environmental signals. Our results support a central role for the conserved GTPase Obg in determining persistence in Escherichia coli in response to nutrient starvation. Obg-mediated persistence requires the stringent response alarmone (p)ppGpp and proceeds through transcriptional control of the hokB-sokB type I toxin-antitoxin module. In individual cells, increased Obg levels induce HokB expression, which in turn results in a collapse of the membrane potential, leading to dormancy. Obg also controls persistence in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and thus constitutes a conserved regulator of antibiotic tolerance. Combined, our findings signify an important step toward unraveling shared genetic mechanisms underlying persistence.

Abstract: Summary
Many canonical processes in molecular biology rely on the dynamic assembly of higher-order nucleoprotein complexes. In bacteria, the assembly mechanism of ParABS, the nucleoprotein super-complex that actively segregates the bacterial chromosome and many plasmids, remains elusive. We combined super-resolution microscopy, quantitative genome-wide surveys, biochemistry, and mathematical modeling to investigate the assembly of ParB at the centromere-like sequences parS. We found that nearly all ParB molecules are actively confined around parS by a network of synergistic protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. Interrogation of the empirically determined, high-resolution ParB genomic distribution with modeling suggests that instead of binding only to specific sequences and subsequently spreading, ParB binds stochastically around parS over long distances. We propose a new model for the formation of the ParABS partition complex based on nucleation and caging: ParB forms a dynamic lattice with the DNA around parS. This assembly model and approach to characterizing large-scale, dynamic interactions between macromolecules may be generalizable to many unrelated machineries that self-assemble in superstructures.

Abstract: Summary
Localization to sites of DNA damage is a hallmark of DNA damage response (DDR) proteins. To identify DDR factors, we screened epitope-tagged proteins for localization to sites of chromatin damaged by UV laser microirradiation and found >120 proteins that localize to damaged chromatin. These include the BAF tumor suppressor complex and the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) candidate protein TAF15. TAF15 contains multiple domains that bind damaged chromatin in a poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-dependent manner, suggesting a possible role as glue that tethers multiple PAR chains together. Many positives were transcription factors; > 70% of randomly tested transcription factors localized to sites of DNA damage, and of these, ∼90% were PARP dependent for localization. Mutational analyses showed that localization to damaged chromatin is DNA-binding-domain dependent. By examining Hoechst staining patterns at damage sites, we see evidence of chromatin decompaction that is PARP dependent. We propose that PARP-regulated chromatin remodeling at sites of damage allows transient accessibility of DNA-binding proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Assembly of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) requires formation of the RISC loading complex (RLC), which contains the Dicer-2 (Dcr-2)-R2D2 complex and recruits duplex siRNA to Ago2 in Drosophila melanogaster. However, the precise composition and action mechanism of Drosophila RLC remain unclear. Here we identified the missing factor of RLC as TATA-binding protein-associated factor 11 (TAF11) by genetic screen. Although it is an annotated nuclear transcription factor, we found that TAF11 also associated with Dcr-2/R2D2 and localized to cytoplasmic D2 bodies. Consistent with defective RLC assembly in taf11−/− ovary extract, we reconstituted the RLC in vitro using the recombinant Dcr-2-R2D2 complex, TAF11, and duplex siRNA. Furthermore, we showed that TAF11 tetramer facilitates Dcr-2-R2D2 tetramerization to enhance siRNA binding and RISC loading activities. Together, our genetic and biochemical studies define the molecular nature of the Drosophila RLC and elucidate a cytoplasmic function of TAF11 in organizing RLC assembly to enhance RNAi efficiency.

Abstract: Summary
The organ of Corti harbors highly specialized sensory hair cells and surrounding supporting cells that are essential for the sense of hearing. Here, we report a single cell gene expression data analysis and visualization strategy that allows for the construction of a quantitative spatial map of the neonatal organ of Corti along its major anatomical axes. The map displays gene expression levels of 192 genes for all organ of Corti cell types ordered along the apex-to-base axis of the cochlea. Statistical interrogation of cell-type-specific gene expression patterns along the longitudinal gradient revealed features of apical supporting cells indicative of a propensity for proliferative hair cell regeneration. This includes reduced expression of Notch effectors, receptivity for canonical Wnt signaling, and prominent expression of early cell-cycle genes. Cochlear hair cells displayed expression gradients of genes indicative of cellular differentiation and the establishment of the tonotopic axis.

Abstract: Summary
The role of CTCF in stabilizing long-range interactions between chromatin sites essential for maintaining nuclear architecture is well established. Most of these interactions involve recruitment of the cohesin complex to chromatin via CTCF. We find that CTCF also interacts with the centromeric protein CENP-E both in vitro and in vivo. We identified CTCF sites in pericentric/centromeric DNA and found that, early in mitosis, CTCF binds and recruits CENP-E to these sites. Unlike most known CTCF genomic sites, the CTCF-binding sites in the pericentric/centromeric regions interact strongly with the C-terminal fingers of CTCF. Overexpression of a small CENP-E fragment, targeted to these CTCF sites, results in a delay in alignment of some chromosomes during mitosis, suggesting that the recruitment of CENP-E by CTCF is physiologically important. We conclude that CTCF helps recruit CENP-E to the centromere during mitosis and that it may do so through a structure stabilized by the CTCF/CENP-E complex.

Abstract: Summary
Every cell in our body originates from the pluripotent inner mass of the embryo, yet it is unknown how biomechanical forces allocate inner cells in vivo. Here we discover subcellular heterogeneities in tensile forces, generated by actomyosin cortical networks, which drive apical constriction to position the first inner cells of living mouse embryos. Myosin II accumulates specifically around constricting cells, and its disruption dysregulates constriction and cell fate. Laser ablations of actomyosin networks reveal that constricting cells have higher cortical tension, generate tension anisotropies and morphological changes in adjacent regions of neighboring cells, and require their neighbors to coordinate their own changes in shape. Thus, tensile forces determine the first spatial segregation of cells during mammalian development. We propose that, unlike more cohesive tissues, the early embryo dissipates tensile forces required by constricting cells via their neighbors, thereby allowing confined cell repositioning without jeopardizing global architecture.

Abstract: Summary
Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) suppress transposon activity in animal germ cells. In the Drosophila ovary, primary Aubergine (Aub)-bound antisense piRNAs initiate the ping-pong cycle to produce secondary AGO3-bound sense piRNAs. This increases the number of secondary Aub-bound antisense piRNAs that can act to destroy transposon mRNAs. Here we show that Krimper (Krimp), a Tudor-domain protein, directly interacts with piRNA-free AGO3 to promote symmetrical dimethylarginine (sDMA) modification, ensuring sense piRNA-loading onto sDMA-modified AGO3. In aub mutant ovaries, AGO3 associates with ping-pong signature piRNAs, suggesting AGO3′s compatibility with primary piRNA loading. Krimp sequesters ectopically expressed AGO3 within Krimp bodies in cultured ovarian somatic cells (OSCs), in which only the primary piRNA pathway operates. Upon krimp-RNAi in OSCs, AGO3 loads with piRNAs, further showing the capacity of AGO3 for primary piRNA loading. We propose that Krimp enforces an antisense bias on piRNA pools by binding AGO3 and blocking its access to primary piRNAs.

Abstract: Summary
The regulation and mechanisms underlying itch sensation are complex. Here, we report a role for acid-sensing ion channel 3 (ASIC3) in mediating itch evoked by certain pruritogens during tissue acidosis. Co-administration of acid with Ser-Leu-Ile-Gly-Arg-Leu-NH2 (SL-NH2) increased scratching behavior in wild-type, but not ASIC3-null, mice, implicating the channel in coincident detection of acidosis and pruritogens. Mechanistically, SL-NH2 slowed desensitization of proton-evoked currents by targeting the previously identified nonproton ligand-sensing domain located in the extracellular region of ASIC3 channels in primary sensory neurons. Ablation of the ASIC3 gene reduced dry-skin-induced scratching behavior and pathological changes under conditions with concomitant inflammation. Taken together, our data suggest that ASIC3 mediates itch sensation via coincident detection of acidosis and nonproton ligands that act at the nonproton ligand-sensing domain of the channel.

Ancient Origin of cGAS-STING Reveals Mechanism of Universal 2′,3′ cGAMP Signaling,

Abstract: Summary
In humans, the cGAS-STING immunity pathway signals in response to cytosolic DNA via 2′,3′ cGAMP, a cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) second messenger containing mixed 2′–5′ and 3′–5′ phosphodiester bonds. Prokaryotes also produce CDNs, but these are exclusively 3′ linked, and thus the evolutionary origins of human 2′,3′ cGAMP signaling are unknown. Here we illuminate the ancient origins of human cGAMP signaling by discovery of a functional cGAS-STING pathway in Nematostella vectensis, an anemone species >500 million years diverged from humans. Anemone cGAS appears to produce a 3′,3′ CDN that anemone STING recognizes through nucleobase-specific contacts not observed in human STING. Nevertheless, anemone STING binds mixed-linkage 2′,3′ cGAMP indistinguishably from human STING, trapping a unique structural conformation not induced by 3′,3′ CDNs. These results reveal that human mixed-linkage cGAMP achieves universal signaling by exploiting a deeply conserved STING conformational intermediate, providing critical insight for therapeutic targeting of the STING pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Fat and muscle lipolysis involves functional interactions of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), α-β hydrolase domain-containing protein 5 (ABHD5), and tissue-specific perilipins 1 and 5 (PLIN1 and PLIN5). ABHD5 potently activates ATGL, but this lipase-promoting activity is suppressed when ABHD5 is bound to PLIN proteins on lipid droplets. In adipocytes, protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation of PLIN1 rapidly releases ABHD5 to activate ATGL, but mechanisms for rapid regulation of PLIN5-ABHD5 interaction in muscle are unknown. Here, we identify synthetic ligands that release ABHD5 from PLIN1 or PLIN5 without PKA activation and rapidly activate adipocyte and muscle lipolysis. Molecular imaging and affinity probe labeling demonstrated that ABHD5 is directly targeted by these synthetic ligands and additionally revealed that ABHD5-PLIN interactions are regulated by endogenous ligands, including long-chain acyl-CoA. Our results reveal a new locus of lipolysis control and suggest ABHD5 ligands might be developed into novel therapeutics that directly promote fat catabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Incursions of new pathogenic viruses into humans from animal reservoirs are occurring with alarming frequency. The molecular underpinnings of immune recognition, host responses, and pathogenesis in this setting are poorly understood. We studied pandemic influenza viruses to determine the mechanism by which increasing glycosylation during evolution of surface proteins facilitates diminished pathogenicity in adapted viruses. ER stress during infection with poorly glycosylated pandemic strains activated the unfolded protein response, leading to inflammation, acute lung injury, and mortality. Seasonal strains or viruses engineered to mimic adapted viruses displaying excess glycans on the hemagglutinin did not cause ER stress, allowing preservation of the lungs and survival. We propose that ER stress resulting from recognition of non-adapted viruses is utilized to discriminate “non-self” at the level of protein processing and to activate immune responses, with unintended consequences on pathogenesis. Understanding this mechanism should improve strategies for treating acute lung injury from zoonotic viral infections.

Abstract: Summary
Human rhinovirus (HRV) causes upper respiratory infections and asthma exacerbations. We screened multiple orthologous RNAi reagents and identified host proteins that modulate HRV replication. Here, we show that RNASEK, a transmembrane protein, was needed for the replication of HRV, influenza A virus, and dengue virus. RNASEK localizes to the cell surface and endosomal pathway and closely associates with the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) proton pump. RNASEK is required for endocytosis, and its depletion produces enlarged clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) at the cell surface. These enlarged CCPs contain endocytic cargo and are bound by the scissioning GTPase, DNM2. Loss of RNASEK alters the localization of multiple V-ATPase subunits and lowers the levels of the ATP6AP1 subunit. Together, our results show that RNASEK closely associates with the V-ATPase and is required for its function; its loss prevents the early events of endocytosis and the replication of multiple pathogenic viruses.

CaMKII-dependent myofilament Ca2+ desensitization contributes to the frequency-dependent acceleration of relaxation,

Abstract: Background
Previous studies suggest that CaMKII activity is required for frequency-dependent acceleration of relaxation (FDAR) in ventricular myocytes. We propose that the underlying mechanism involves CaMKII-dependent regulation of myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity.
Methods and results
Cardiac function was measured in mice using murine echo machine. [Ca2+]i and sarcomere length were measured by IonOptix Ca2+ image system. Increasing pacing rate from 0.5 to 4Hz in left ventricular myocytes induced frequency-dependent myofilament Ca2+ desensitization (FDMCD) and FDAR. Acute inhibition of PKA or PKC had no effect, whereas CaMKII inhibition abolished both FDMCD and FDAR. Co-immunoprecipitation of CaMKII and troponin I (TnI) has been detected and CaMKII inhibition significantly reduced serine residue phosphorylation of TnI. Finally, chronic inhibition of CaMKII in vivo reduced TnI phosphorylation and abolished both FDAR and FDMCD, leading to impaired diastolic function.
Conclusions
Our results suggest that CaMKII-dependent TnI phosphorylation is involved in FDMCD and the consequent FDAR and that CaMKII inhibition removes this mechanism and thus induces diastolic dysfunction.

Abstract: Summary
The mTORC1 complex is central to the cellular response to changes in nutrient availability. The signaling adaptor p62 contributes to mTORC1 activation in response to amino acids and interacts with TRAF6, which is required for the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosome and the subsequent K63 polyubiquitination and activation of mTOR. However, the signal initiating these p62-driven processes was previously unknown. Here, we show that p62 is phosphorylated via a cascade that includes MEK3/6 and p38δ and is driven by the PB1-containing kinase MEKK3. This phosphorylation results in the recruitment of TRAF6 to p62, the ubiquitination and activation of mTOR, and the regulation of autophagy and cell proliferation. Genetic inactivation of MEKK3 or p38δ mimics that of p62 in that it leads to inhibited growth of PTEN-deficient prostate organoids. Analysis of human prostate cancer samples showed upregulation of these three components of the pathway, which correlated with enhanced mTORC1 activation.

Abstract: Summary
Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by MECP2 mutations. Although emerging evidence suggests that MeCP2 deficiency is associated with dysregulation of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), which functions as a hub for various signaling pathways, the mechanism underlying this association and the molecular pathophysiology of RTT remain elusive. We show here that MeCP2 promotes the posttranscriptional processing of particular microRNAs (miRNAs) as a component of the microprocessor Drosha complex. Among the MeCP2-regulated miRNAs, we found that miR-199a positively controls mTOR signaling by targeting inhibitors for mTOR signaling. miR-199a and its targets have opposite effects on mTOR activity, ameliorating and inducing RTT neuronal phenotypes, respectively. Furthermore, genetic deletion of miR-199a-2 led to a reduction of mTOR activity in the brain and recapitulated numerous RTT phenotypes in mice. Together, these findings establish miR-199a as a critical downstream target of MeCP2 in RTT pathogenesis by linking MeCP2 with mTOR signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Motor neurons (MNs) are unique because they project their axons outside of the CNS to innervate the peripheral muscles. Limb-innervating lateral motor column MNs (LMC-MNs) travel substantially to innervate distal limb mesenchyme. How LMC-MNs fine-tune the balance between survival and apoptosis while wiring the sensorimotor circuit en route remains unclear. Here, we show that the mir-17∼92 cluster is enriched in embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived LMC-MNs and that conditional mir-17∼92 deletion in MNs results in the death of LMC-MNs in vitro and in vivo. mir-17∼92 overexpression rescues MNs from apoptosis, which occurs spontaneously during embryonic development. PTEN is a primary target of mir-17∼92 responsible for LMC-MN degeneration. Additionally, mir-17∼92 directly targets components of E3 ubiquitin ligases, affecting PTEN subcellular localization through monoubiquitination. This miRNA-mediated regulation modulates both target expression and target subcellular localization, providing LMC-MNs with an intricate defensive mechanism that controls their survival.

Abstract: Summary
The development of multicellular organisms requires the precisely coordinated regulation of an evolutionarily conserved group of signaling pathways. Temporal and spatial control of these signaling cascades is achieved through networks of regulatory proteins, segregation of pathway components in specific subcellular compartments, or both. In vertebrates, dysregulation of primary cilia function has been strongly linked to developmental signaling defects, yet it remains unclear whether cilia sequester pathway components to regulate their activation or cilia-associated proteins directly modulate developmental signaling events. To elucidate this question, we conducted an RNAi-based screen in Drosophila non-ciliated cells to test for cilium-independent loss-of-function phenotypes of ciliary proteins in developmental signaling pathways. Our results show no effect on Hedgehog signaling. In contrast, our screen identified several cilia-associated proteins as functioning in canonical Wnt signaling. Further characterization of specific components of Intraflagellar Transport complex A uncovered a cilia-independent function in potentiating Wnt signals by promoting β-catenin/Armadillo activity.

Mechanisms of activation of nucleus accumbens neurons by cocaine via sigma-1 receptor–inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate–transient receptor potential canonical channel pathways,

Abstract: Cocaine promotes addictive behavior primarily by blocking the dopamine transporter, thus increasing dopamine transmission in the nucleus accumbens (nAcc); however, additional mechanisms are continually emerging. Sigma-1 receptors (σ1Rs) are known targets for cocaine, yet the mechanisms underlying σ1R-mediated effects of cocaine are incompletely understood. The present study examined direct effects of cocaine on dissociated nAcc neurons expressing phosphatidylinositol-linked D1 receptors. Endoplasmic reticulum-located σ1Rs and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors (IP3Rs) were targeted using intracellular microinjection. IP3 microinjection robustly elevated intracellular Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]i. While cocaine alone was devoid of an effect, the IP3-induced response was σ1R-dependently enhanced by cocaine co-injection. Likewise, cocaine augmented the [Ca2+]i increase elicited by extracellularly applying an IP3-generating molecule (ATP), via σ1Rs. The cocaine-induced enhancement of the IP3/ATP-mediated Ca2+ elevation occurred at pharmacologically relevant concentrations and was mediated by transient receptor potential canonical channels (TRPC). IP3 microinjection elicited a slight, transient depolarization, further converted to a greatly enhanced, prolonged response, by cocaine co-injection. The cocaine-triggered augmentation was σ1R-dependent, TRPC-mediated and contingent on [Ca2+]i elevation. ATP-induced depolarization was similarly enhanced by cocaine. Thus, we identify a novel mechanism by which cocaine promotes activation of D1-expressing nAcc neurons: enhancement of IP3R-mediated responses via σ1R activation at the endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in augmented Ca2+ release and amplified depolarization due to subsequent stimulation of TRPC. In vivo, intra-accumbal blockade of σ1R or TRPC significantly diminished cocaine-induced hyperlocomotion and locomotor sensitization, endorsing a physio-pathological significance of the pathway identified in vitro.

Abstract: Summary
In cancer genomics, recurrence of mutations in independent tumor samples is a strong indicator of functional impact. However, rare functional mutations can escape detection by recurrence analysis owing to lack of statistical power. We enhance statistical power by extending the notion of recurrence of mutations from single genes to gene families that share homologous protein domains. Domain mutation analysis also sharpens the functional interpretation of the impact of mutations, as domains more succinctly embody function than entire genes. By mapping mutations in 22 different tumor types to equivalent positions in multiple sequence alignments of domains, we confirm well-known functional mutation hotspots, identify uncharacterized rare variants in one gene that are equivalent to well-characterized mutations in another gene, detect previously unknown mutation hotspots, and provide hypotheses about molecular mechanisms and downstream effects of domain mutations. With the rapid expansion of cancer genomics projects, protein domain hotspot analysis will likely provide many more leads linking mutations in proteins to the cancer phenotype.

Abstract: Summary
The esophagus links the oral cavity to the stomach and facilitates the transfer of bolus. Using genetic tracing and mouse mutants, we demonstrate that esophagus striated muscles (ESMs) are not derived from somites but are of cranial origin. Tbx1 and Isl1 act as key regulators of ESMs, which we now identify as a third derivative of cardiopharyngeal mesoderm that contributes to second heart field derivatives and head muscles. Isl1-derived ESM progenitors colonize the mouse esophagus in an anterior-posterior direction but are absent in the developing chick esophagus, thus providing evolutionary insight into the lack of ESMs in avians. Strikingly, different from other myogenic regions, in which embryonic myogenesis establishes a scaffold for fetal fiber formation, ESMs are established directly by fetal myofibers. We propose that ESM progenitors use smooth muscle as a scaffold, thereby bypassing the embryonic program. These findings have important implications in understanding esophageal dysfunctions, including dysphagia, and congenital disorders, such as DiGeorge syndrome.

Abstract: Summary
An understanding of the mechanisms determining MYC’s transcriptional and proliferation-promoting activities in vivo could facilitate approaches for MYC targeting. However, post-translational mechanisms that control MYC function in vivo are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that MYC phosphorylation at serine 62 enhances MYC accumulation on Lamin A/C-associated nuclear structures and that the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor protein CIP2A is required for this process. CIP2A is also critical for serum-induced MYC phosphorylation and for MYC-elicited proliferation induction in vitro. Complementary transgenic approaches and an intestinal regeneration model further demonstrated the in vivo importance of CIP2A and serine 62 phosphorylation for MYC activity upon DNA damage. However, targeting of CIP2A did not influence the normal function of intestinal crypt cells. These data underline the importance of nuclear organization in the regulation of MYC phosphorylation, leading to an in vivo demonstration of a strategy for inhibiting MYC activity without detrimental physiological effects.

Abstract: Since the emergence of proteomics methods, many proteins specific for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) have been identified. Despite their usefulness for the specific diagnosis of RCC, such proteins do not provide spatial information on the diseased tissue. Therefore, the identification of cancer-specific proteins that include information on their specific location is needed. Recently, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS) based imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) has emerged as a new tool for the analysis of spatial distribution as well as identification of either proteins or small molecules in tissues. In this report, surgical tissue sections of papillary RCC were analyzed using MALDI-IMS. Statistical analysis revealed several discriminative cancer-specific m/z-species between normal and diseased tissues. Among these m/z-species, two particular proteins, S100A11 and ferritin light chain, which are specific for papillary RCC cancer regions, were successfully identified using LC-MS/MS following protein extraction from independent RCC samples. The expressions of S100A11 and ferritin light chain were further validated by immunohistochemistry of human tissues and tissue microarrays (TMAs) of RCC. In conclusion, MALDI-IMS followed by LC-MS/MS analysis in human tissue identified that S100A11 and ferritin light chain are differentially expressed proteins in papillary RCC cancer regions.

Abstract: Summary
Small RNAs are used to silence transposable elements (TEs) in many eukaryotes, which use diverse evolutionary solutions to identify TEs. In ciliated protozoans, small-RNA-mediated comparison of the germline and somatic genomes underlies identification of TE-related sequences, which are then eliminated from the soma. Here, we describe an additional mechanism of small-RNA-mediated identification of TE-related sequences in the ciliate Tetrahymena. We show that a limited set of internal eliminated sequences (IESs) containing potentially active TEs produces a class of small RNAs that recognize not only the IESs from which they are derived, but also other IESs in trans. This trans recognition triggers the expression of yet another class of small RNAs that identify other IESs. Therefore, TE-related sequences in Tetrahymena are robustly targeted for elimination by a genome-wide trans-recognition network accompanied by a chain reaction of small RNA production.

Here, we describe an RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq)-based approach that accurately detects even modest maternal or paternal allele expression biases at the tissue level, which we call noncanonical genomic imprinting effects. We profile imprinting in the arcuate nucleus (ARN) and dorsal raphe nucleus of the female mouse brain as well as skeletal muscle (mesodermal) and liver (endodermal). Our study uncovers hundreds of noncanonical autosomal and X-linked imprinting effects. Noncanonical imprinting is highly tissue-specific and enriched in the ARN, but rare in the liver. These effects are reproducible across different genetic backgrounds and associated with allele-specific chromatin. Using in situ hybridization for nascent RNAs, we discover that autosomal noncanonical imprinted genes with a tissue-level allele bias exhibit allele-specific expression effects in subpopulations of neurons in the brain in vivo. We define noncanonical imprinted genes that regulate monoamine signaling and determine that these effects influence the impact of inherited mutations on offspring behavior.

Abstract: Summary
Meiosis-activating sterols (MAS) are substrates of SC4MOL and NSDHL in the cholesterol pathway and are important for normal organismal development. Oncogenic transformation by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or RAS increases the demand for cholesterol, suggesting a possibility for metabolic interference. To test this idea in vivo, we ablated Nsdhl in adult keratinocytes expressing KRASG12D. Strikingly, Nsdhl inactivation antagonized the growth of skin tumors while having little effect on normal skin. Loss of Nsdhl induced the expression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1, reduced the expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), decreased intracellular cholesterol, and was dependent on the liver X receptor (LXR) α. Importantly, EGFR signaling opposed LXRα effects on cholesterol homeostasis, whereas an EGFR inhibitor synergized with LXRα agonists in killing cancer cells. Inhibition of SC4MOL or NSDHL, or activation of LXRα by sterol metabolites, can be an effective strategy against carcinomas with activated EGFR-KRAS signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we examine the mechanism by which plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and type I interferons promote humoral autoimmunity. In an amyloid-induced experimental autoimmune model, neutrophil depletion enhanced anti-nuclear antibody development, which correlated with heightened IFN-γ production by natural killer (NK) cells. IFN-α/β produced by pDCs activated NK cells via IL-15 induction. Neutrophils released reactive oxygen species (ROS), which negatively modulated the levels of IL-15, thereby inhibiting IFN-γ production. Mice deficient in NADPH oxidase 2 produced increased amounts of IFN-γ and developed augmented titers of autoantibodies. Both the pDC-IFN-α/β pathway and IFN-γ were indispensable in stimulating humoral autoimmunity. Male NZB/W F1 mice expressed higher levels of superoxide than their female lupus-prone siblings, and depletion of neutrophils resulted in spontaneous NK cell and autoimmune B cell activation. Our findings suggest a regulatory role for neutrophils in vivo and highlight the importance of an NK-IFN-γ axis downstream of the pDC-IFN-α/β pathway in systemic autoimmunity.

Abstract: Summary
Epigenetic dysregulation has emerged as an important mechanism in cancer. Alterations in epigenetic machinery have become a major focus for targeted therapies. The current report describes the discovery and biological activity of a cyclopropylamine containing inhibitor of Lysine Demethylase 1 (LSD1), GSK2879552. This small molecule is a potent, selective, orally bioavailable, mechanism-based irreversible inactivator of LSD1. A proliferation screen of cell lines representing a number of tumor types indicated that small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is sensitive to LSD1 inhibition. The subset of SCLC lines and primary samples that undergo growth inhibition in response to GSK2879552 exhibit DNA hypomethylation of a signature set of probes, suggesting this may be used as a predictive biomarker of activity.

Abstract: Summary
SPOP mutations and TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangements occur collectively in up to 65% of human prostate cancers. Although the two events are mutually exclusive, it is unclear whether they are functionally interrelated. Here, we demonstrate that SPOP, functioning as an E3 ubiquitin ligase substrate-binding protein, promotes ubiquitination and proteasome degradation of wild-type ERG by recognizing a degron motif at the N terminus of ERG. Prostate cancer-associated SPOP mutations abrogate the SPOP-mediated degradation function on the ERG oncoprotein. Conversely, the majority of TMPRSS2-ERG fusions encode N-terminal-truncated ERG proteins that are resistant to the SPOP-mediated degradation because of degron impairment. Our findings reveal degradation resistance as a previously uncharacterized mechanism that contributes to elevation of truncated ERG proteins in prostate cancer. They also suggest that overcoming ERG resistance to SPOP-mediated degradation represents a viable strategy for treatment of prostate cancers expressing either mutated SPOP or truncated ERG.

Abstract: Summary
The transcriptional response to infection with the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) requires cooperative signals of the type I interferon (IFN-I)-stimulated JAK-STAT and proinflammatory NF-κB pathways. Using ChIP-seq analysis, we define genes induced in Lm-infected macrophages through synergistic transcriptional activation by NF-κB and the IFN-I-activated transcription factor ISGF3. Using the Nos2 and IL6 genes as prime examples of this group, we show that NF-κB functions to recruit enzymes that establish histone marks of transcriptionally active genes. In addition, NF-κB regulates transcriptional elongation by employing the mediator kinase module for the recruitment of the pTEFb complex. ISGF3 has a major role in associating the core mediator with the transcription start as a prerequisite for TFIID and RNA polymerase II (Pol II) binding. Our data suggest that the functional cooperation between two major antimicrobial pathways is based on promoter priming by NF-κB and the engagement of the core mediator for Pol II binding by ISGF3.

Abstract: Summary
Histone modification and DNA methylation are associated with varying epigenetic “landscapes,” but detailed mechanistic and functional links between the two remain unclear. Using the ATRX-DNMT3-DNMT3L (ADD) domain of the DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3a as a paradigm, we apply protein engineering to dissect the molecular interactions underlying the recruitment of this enzyme to specific regions of chromatin in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). By rendering the ADD domain insensitive to histone modification, specifically H3K4 methylation or H3T3 phosphorylation, we demonstrate the consequence of dysregulated Dnmt3a binding and activity. Targeting of a Dnmt3a mutant to H3K4me3 promoters decreases gene expression in a subset of developmental genes and alters ESC differentiation, whereas aberrant binding of another mutant to H3T3ph during mitosis promotes chromosome instability. Our studies support the general view that histone modification “reading” and DNA methylation are closely coupled in mammalian cells, and suggest an avenue for the functional assessment of chromatin-associated proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria undergo architectural/functional changes in response to metabolic inputs. How this process is regulated in physiological feeding/fasting states remains unclear. Here we show that mitochondrial dynamics (notably fission and mitophagy) and biogenesis are transcriptional targets of the circadian regulator Bmal1 in mouse liver and exhibit a metabolic rhythm in sync with diurnal bioenergetic demands. Bmal1 loss-of-function causes swollen mitochondria incapable of adapting to different nutrient conditions accompanied by diminished respiration and elevated oxidative stress. Consequently, liver-specific Bmal1 knockout (LBmal1KO) mice accumulate oxidative damage and develop hepatic insulin resistance. Restoration of hepatic Bmal1 activities in high-fat-fed mice improves metabolic outcomes, whereas expression of Fis1, a fission protein that promotes quality control, rescues morphological/metabolic defects of LBmal1KO mitochondria. Interestingly, Bmal1 homolog AHA-1 in C. elegans retains the ability to modulate oxidative metabolism and lifespan despite lacking circadian regulation. These results suggest clock genes are evolutionarily conserved energetics regulators.

Calcium-induced calcium release and gap junctions mediate large-scale calcium waves in olfactory ensheathing cells in situ,

Abstract: Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) are a specialised type of glial cells, supporting axon growth and guidance during development and regeneration of the olfactory nerve and the nerve layer of the olfactory bulb. We measured calcium signalling in OECs in olfactory bulb in-toto preparations using confocal and epifluorescence microscopy and the calcium indicator Fluo-4. We identified two subpopulations of olfactory bulb OECs: OECs in the outer sublamina of the nerve layer responded to purinergic neurotransmitters such as adenosine triphosphate with calcium transients, while OECs in the inner sublamina of the nerve layer did not respond to neurotransmitters. However, the latter generated spontaneous calcium waves that covered hundreds of cells. These calcium waves persisted in the presence of tetrodotoxin and in calcium-free saline, but were abolished after calcium store depletion with cyclopiazonic acid or inositol trisphosphate receptor blockage with 2-APB. Calcium waves could be triggered by laser photolysis of caged inositol trisphosphate. Blocking purinoceptors with PPADS had no effect on calcium wave propagation, whereas blocking gap junctions with carbenoxolone or meclofenamic acid entirely suppressed calcium waves. Increasing calcium buffer capacity in OECs with NP-EGTA (“caged” Ca2+) prevented calcium wave generation, and laser photolysis of NP-EGTA in a small group of OECs resulted in a calcium increase in the irradiated cells followed by a calcium wave. We conclude that calcium waves in OECs can be initiated by calcium-induced calcium release via InsP3 receptors and propagate through gap junctions, while purinergic signalling is not involved.

Abstract: Summary
The homeobox transcription factors NKX2-5 and MEIS1 are essential for vertebrate heart development and normal physiology of the adult heart. We show that, during cardiac differentiation, the two transcription factors have partially overlapping expression patterns, with the result that as cardiac progenitors from the anterior heart field differentiate and migrate into the cardiac outflow tract, they sequentially experience high levels of MEIS1 and then increasing levels of NKX2-5. Using the Popdc2 gene as an example, we also show that a significant proportion of target genes for NKX2-5 contain a binding motif recognized by NKX2-5, which overlaps with a binding site for MEIS1. Binding of the two factors to such overlapping sites is mutually exclusive, and this provides a simple regulatory mechanism for spatial and temporal synchronization of a common pool of targets between NKX2-5 and MEIS1.

Abstract: Summary
The NLRP3 inflammasome is involved in caspase-1-dependent maturation of IL-1β in many contexts. A two-signal model has emerged for IL-1β maturation, with LPS providing “signal I” and diverse agents such as ATP, Nigericin, streptolysin O, uric acid crystals, and alum salts capable of acting as “signal II.” In the absence of signal II, pro-IL-1β is upregulated but typically fails to be processed or released. What unites signal II stimuli has been debated, with the ability to promote K+ efflux suggested as a common factor, but the mechanism of IL-1β release remains unclear. Here, we show that all examined inflammasome signal II agents triggered necrosis, which was highly correlated with their ability to promote IL-1β release. IL-1β secretion occurred in tandem with the release of many additional proteins and was confined to necrotic cells. Thus, signal II agents initiate inflammation by promoting necrosis-driven IL-1β release, suggesting that IL-1β represents an inducible danger signal.

Abstract: Summary
We developed Split DamID (SpDamID), a protein complementation version of DamID, to mark genomic DNA bound in vivo by interacting or juxtapositioned transcription factors. Inactive halves of DAM (DNA adenine methyltransferase) were fused to protein pairs to be queried. Either direct interaction between proteins or proximity enabled DAM reconstitution and methylation of adenine in GATC. Inducible SpDamID was used to analyze Notch-mediated transcriptional activation. We demonstrate that Notch complexes label RBP sites broadly across the genome and show that a subset of these complexes that recruit MAML and p300 undergo changes in chromatin accessibility in response to Notch signaling. SpDamID differentiates between monomeric and dimeric binding, thereby allowing for identification of half-site motifs used by Notch dimers. Motif enrichment of Notch enhancers coupled with SpDamID reveals co-targeting of regulatory sequences by Notch and Runx1. SpDamID represents a sensitive and powerful tool that enables dynamic analysis of combinatorial protein-DNA transactions at a genome-wide level.
