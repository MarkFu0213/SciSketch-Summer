Abstract: Summary
Although common cancer hallmarks are well established, lineage-restricted oncogenes remain less understood. Here, we report an inherent dependency of melanoma cells on the small GTPase RAB7, identified within a lysosomal gene cluster that distinguishes this malignancy from over 35 tumor types. Analyses in human cells, clinical specimens, and mouse models demonstrated that RAB7 is an early-induced melanoma driver whose levels can be tuned to favor tumor invasion, ultimately defining metastatic risk. Importantly, RAB7 levels and function were independent of MITF, the best-characterized melanocyte lineage-specific transcription factor. Instead, we describe the neuroectodermal master modulator SOX10 and the oncogene MYC as RAB7 regulators. These results reveal a unique wiring of the lysosomal pathway that melanomas exploit to foster tumor progression.

O-GlcNAcylation Regulates Cancer Metabolism and Survival Stress Signaling via Regulation of the HIF-1 Pathway,

Abstract: Summary
The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway elevates posttranslational addition of O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) on intracellular proteins. Cancer cells elevate total O-GlcNAcylation by increasing O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and/or decreasing O-GlcNAcase (OGA) levels. Reducing O-GlcNAcylation inhibits oncogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that O-GlcNAcylation regulates glycolysis in cancer cells via hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1α) and its transcriptional target GLUT1. Reducing O-GlcNAcylation increases α-ketoglutarate, HIF-1 hydroxylation, and interaction with von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL), resulting in HIF-1α degradation. Reducing O-GlcNAcylation in cancer cells results in activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and cancer cell apoptosis mediated through C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). HIF-1α and GLUT1 are critical for OGT-mediated regulation of metabolic stress, as overexpression of stable HIF-1 or GLUT1 rescues metabolic defects. Human breast cancers with high levels of HIF-1α contain elevated OGT, and lower OGA levels correlate independently with poor patient outcome. Thus, O-GlcNAcylation regulates cancer cell metabolic reprograming and survival stress signaling via regulation of HIF-1α.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem cell differentiation involves the silencing of self-renewal genes and induction of a specific transcriptional program. Identification of multiple covalent cytosine modifications raises the question of how these derivatized bases influence stem cell commitment. Using a replicative primary human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell differentiation system, we demonstrate dynamic changes of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) during stem cell commitment and differentiation to the erythroid lineage. Genomic loci that maintain or gain 5-hmC density throughout erythroid differentiation contain binding sites for erythroid transcription factors and several factors not previously recognized as erythroid-specific factors. The functional importance of 5-hmC was demonstrated by impaired erythroid differentiation, with augmentation of myeloid potential, and disrupted 5-hmC patterning in leukemia patient-derived CD34+ stem/early progenitor cells with TET methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2) mutations. Thus, chemical conjugation and affinity purification of 5-hmC-enriched sequences followed by sequencing serve as resources for deciphering functional implications for gene expression during stem cell commitment and differentiation along a particular lineage.

Abstract: Summary
Conditional gene knockout animals are valuable tools for studying the mechanisms underlying cell and developmental biology. We developed a conditional knockout strategy by spatiotemporally manipulating the expression of an RNA-guided DNA endonuclease, CRISPR-Cas9, in Caenorhabditis elegans somatic cell lineages. We showed that this somatic CRISPR-Cas9 technology provides a quick and efficient approach to generate conditional knockouts in various cell types at different developmental stages. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this method outperforms our recently developed somatic TALEN technique and enables the one-step generation of multiple conditional knockouts. By combining these techniques with live-cell imaging, we showed that an essential embryonic gene, Coronin, which is associated with human neurobehavioral dysfunction, regulates actin organization and cell morphology during C. elegans postembryonic neuroblast migration and neuritogenesis. We propose that the somatic CRISPR-Cas9 platform is uniquely suited for conditional gene editing-based biomedical research.

Abstract: Summary
Although small-molecule targeting of EZH2 appears to be effective in lymphomas carrying EZH2 activating mutations, finding similar approaches to target EZH2-overexpressing epithelial tumors remains challenging. In MYC-driven, but not PI3K-driven prostate cancer, we show that interferon-γ receptor 1 (IFNGR1) is directly repressed by EZH2 in a MYC-dependent manner and is downregulated in a subset of metastatic prostate cancers. EZH2 knockdown restored the expression of IFNGR1 and, when combined with IFN-γ treatment, led to strong activation of IFN-JAK-STAT1 tumor-suppressor signaling and robust apoptosis. Pharmacologic depletion of EZH2 by the histone-methylation inhibitor DZNep mimicked the effects of EZH2 knockdown on IFNGR1 induction and delivered a remarkable synergistic antitumor effect with IFN-γ. In contrast, although they efficiently depleted histone Lysine 27 trimethylation, EZH2 catalytic inhibitors failed to mimic EZH2 depletion. Thus, EZH2-inactivated IFN signaling may represent a therapeutic target, and patients with advanced prostate cancer driven by MYC may benefit from the combination of EZH2 and IFN-γ-targeted therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Cells commit to a new cell cycle at Start by activation of the G1 Cdk-cyclin complex which, in turn, triggers a genome-wide transcriptional wave that executes the G1/S transition. In budding yeast, the Cdc28-Cln3 complex is regulated by an ER-retention mechanism that is important for proper cell size control. We have isolated small-cell-size CDC28 mutants showing impaired retention at the ER and premature accumulation of the Cln3 cyclin in the nucleus. The differential interactome of a quintuple Cdc28wee mutant pinpointed Whi7, a Whi5 paralog targeted by Cdc28 that associates to the ER in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Our results demonstrate that the Cln3 cyclin and Whi7 act in a positive feedback loop to release the G1 Cdk-cyclin complex and trigger Start once a critical size has been reached, thus uncovering a key nonlinear mechanism at the earliest known events of cell-cycle entry.

Abstract: Summary
Plasma membrane PI4P helps determine the identity of this membrane and plays a key role in signal transduction as the precursor of PI(4,5)P2 and its metabolites. Here, we report the atomic structure of the protein scaffold that is required for the plasma membrane localization and function of Stt4/PI4KIIIα, the PI 4-kinase responsible for this PI4P pool. Both proteins of the scaffold, Efr3 and YPP1/TTC7, are composed of α-helical repeats, which are arranged into a rod in Efr3 and a superhelix in Ypp1. A conserved basic patch in Efr3, which binds acidic phospholipids, anchors the complex to the plasma membrane. Stt4/PI4KIIIα is recruited by interacting with the Ypp1 C-terminal lobe, which also binds to unstructured regions in the Efr3 C terminus. Phosphorylation of this Efr3 region counteracts Ypp1 binding, thus providing a mechanism through which Stt4/PI4KIIIα recruitment, and thus a metabolic reaction of fundamental importance in cell physiology, can be regulated.

Abstract: Summary
Senescence is a state of permanent growth arrest and is a pivotal part of the antitumorigenic barrier in vivo. Although the tumor suppressor activities of p53 and pRb family proteins are essential for the induction of senescence, molecular mechanisms by which these proteins induce senescence are still not clear. Using time-lapse live-cell imaging, we demonstrate here that normal human diploid fibroblasts (HDFs) exposed to various senescence-inducing stimuli undergo a mitosis skip before entry into permanent cell-cycle arrest. This mitosis skip is mediated by both p53-dependent premature activation of APC/CCdh1 and pRb family protein-dependent transcriptional suppression of mitotic regulators. Importantly, mitotic skipping is necessary and sufficient for senescence induction. p16 is only required for maintenance of senescence. Analysis of human nevi also suggested the role of mitosis skip in in vivo senescence. Our findings provide decisive evidence for the molecular basis underlying the induction and maintenance of cellular senescence.

Abstract: Summary
Redox-mediated posttranslational modifications represent a molecular switch that controls major mechanisms of cell function. Nitric oxide (NO) can mediate redox reactions via S-nitrosylation, representing transfer of an NO group to a critical protein thiol. NO is known to modulate neurogenesis and neuronal survival in various brain regions in disparate neurodegenerative conditions. However, a unifying molecular mechanism linking these phenomena remains unknown. Here, we report that S-nitrosylation of myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) transcription factors acts as a redox switch to inhibit both neurogenesis and neuronal survival. Structure-based analysis reveals that MEF2 dimerization creates a pocket, facilitating S-nitrosylation at an evolutionally conserved cysteine residue in the DNA binding domain. S-Nitrosylation disrupts MEF2-DNA binding and transcriptional activity, leading to impaired neurogenesis and survival in vitro and in vivo. Our data define a molecular switch whereby redox-mediated posttranslational modification controls both neurogenesis and neurodegeneration via a single transcriptional signaling cascade.

Abstract: Summary
Negamycin (NEG) is a ribosome-targeting antibiotic that exhibits clinically promising activity. Its binding site and mode of action have remained unknown. We solved the structure of the Thermus thermophilus ribosome bound to mRNA and three tRNAs, in complex with NEG. The drug binds to both small and large ribosomal subunits at nine independent sites. Resistance mutations in the 16S rRNA unequivocally identified the binding site in the vicinity of the conserved helix 34 (h34) in the small subunit as the primary site of antibiotic action in the bacterial and, possibly, eukaryotic ribosome. At this site, NEG contacts 16S rRNA as well as the anticodon loop of the A-site tRNA. Although the NEG site of action overlaps with that of tetracycline (TET), the two antibiotics exhibit different activities: while TET sterically hinders binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome, NEG stabilizes its binding, thereby inhibiting translocation and stimulating miscoding.

Abstract: Summary
B cells foster squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) development through deposition of immunoglobulin-containing immune complexes in premalignant tissue and Fcγ receptor-dependent activation of myeloid cells. Because human SCCs of the vulva and head and neck exhibited hallmarks of B cell infiltration, we examined B cell-deficient mice and found reduced support for SCC growth. Although ineffective as a single agent, treatment of mice bearing preexisting SCCs with B cell-depleting αCD20 monoclonal antibodies improved response to platinum- and Taxol-based chemotherapy. Improved chemoresponsiveness was dependent on altered chemokine expression by macrophages that promoted tumor infiltration of activated CD8+ lymphocytes via CCR5-dependent mechanisms. These data reveal that B cells, and the downstream myeloid-based pathways they regulate, represent tractable targets for anticancer therapy in select tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Linear ubiquitination is crucial for innate and adaptive immunity. The linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), consisting of HOIL-1, HOIP, and SHARPIN, is the only known ubiquitin ligase that generates linear ubiquitin linkages. HOIP is the catalytically active LUBAC component. Here, we show that both constitutive and Tie2-Cre-driven HOIP deletion lead to aberrant endothelial cell death, resulting in defective vascularization and embryonic lethality at midgestation. Ablation of tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) prevents cell death, vascularization defects, and death at midgestation. HOIP-deficient cells are more sensitive to death induction by both tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and lymphotoxin-α (LT-α), and aberrant complex-II formation is responsible for sensitization to TNFR1-mediated cell death in the absence of HOIP. Finally, we show that HOIP’s catalytic activity is necessary for preventing TNF-induced cell death. Hence, LUBAC and its linear-ubiquitin-forming activity are required for maintaining vascular integrity during embryogenesis by preventing TNFR1-mediated endothelial cell death.

Abstract: Summary
Cargo adaptor subunits of vesicle coat protein complexes sort transmembrane proteins to distinct membrane compartments in eukaryotic cells. The exomer complex is the only cargo adaptor known to sort proteins at the trans-Golgi network into secretory vesicles. Exomer function is regulated by the Arf1 GTPase, a master regulator of trafficking at the Golgi. We report the structure of exomer bound to two copies of Arf1. Exomer interacts with each Arf1 molecule via two surfaces, one of which is a noncanonical interface that regulates GTP hydrolysis. The structure uncovers an unexpected membrane-proximal hydrophobic element that exomer uses in cooperation with Arf1 to remodel membranes. Given the constrained motion of the exomer hinge region, we envision that exomer dynamically positions multiple membrane insertion elements to drive membrane fission. In contrast to other known cargo adaptors, exomer therefore couples two functions, cargo sorting and membrane fission, into a single complex.

Abstract: Summary
Maternal metabolism provides essential nutrients to enable embryonic development. However, both mother and embryo produce reactive metabolites that can damage DNA. Here we discover how the embryo is protected from these genotoxins. Pregnant mice lacking Aldh2, a key enzyme that detoxifies reactive aldehydes, cannot support the development of embryos lacking the Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway gene Fanca. Remarkably, transferring Aldh2−/−Fanca−/− embryos into wild-type mothers suppresses developmental defects and rescues embryonic lethality. These rescued neonates have severely depleted hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, indicating that despite intact maternal aldehyde catabolism, fetal Aldh2 is essential for hematopoiesis. Hence, maternal and fetal aldehyde detoxification protects the developing embryo from DNA damage. Failure of this genome preservation mechanism might explain why birth defects and bone marrow failure occur in Fanconi anemia, and may have implications for fetal well-being in the many women in Southeast Asia that are genetically deficient in ALDH2.

Abstract: Summary
Clustering of immunoreceptors upon association with multivalent ligands triggers important responses including phagocytosis, secretion of cytokines, and production of immunoglobulins. We applied single-molecule detection and tracking methods to study the factors that control the mobility and clustering of phagocytic Fcγ receptors (FcγR). While the receptors exist as monomers in resting macrophages, two distinct populations were discernible based on their mobility: some diffuse by apparent free motion, while others are confined within submicron boundaries that reduce the frequency of spontaneous collisions. Src-family and Syk kinases determine the structure of the actin cytoskeleton, which is fenestrated, accounting for the heterogeneous diffusion of the FcγR. Stimulation of these kinases during phagocytosis induces reorganization of the cytoskeleton both locally and distally in a manner that alters receptor mobility and clustering, generating a feedback loop that facilitates engagement of FcγR at the tip of pseudopods, directing the progression of phagocytosis.

Abstract: Calcium signaling has a versatile role in many important cellular functions. Despite its importance, regulation of calcium signaling in bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs, also known as bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells) has not been explored extensively. Our previous study revealed that cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) enabled BMSCs to generate calcium signal upon stimulation by dopamine, KCl and glutamate. Concurrently, cAMP transiently activated the transcription factor cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) in BMSCs. Activity of CREB can be modulated by the calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase signaling pathway, however, whether the calcium signaling observed in cAMP-induced BMSCs requires CREB has not been investigated. In an effort to uncover the role of CREB in the generation of calcium signaling in response to modulators such as dopamine and KCl, we knocked down CREB activity in BMSCs. Our study indicated that BMSCs, but not its close relative fibroblasts, are responsive to dopamine and KCl after cAMP treatment. Calcium signal elicited by dopamine depends, in part, on calcium influx whereas that elicited by KCl depends completely on calcium influx. Knock-down of CREB activity significantly reduced or abolished the cAMP-induced calcium response, and reintroducing a constitutively active CREB partially restored the calcium response.

Abstract: The conversion of somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells via overexpression of reprogramming factors involves epigenetic remodeling. DNA methylation at a significant proportion of CpG sites in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) differs from that of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Whether different sets of reprogramming factors influence the type and extent of aberrant DNA methylation in iPSCs differently remains unknown. In order to help resolve this critical question, we generated human iPSCs from a common fibroblast cell source using either the Yamanaka factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and cMYC) or the Thomson factors (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG and LIN28), and determined their genome-wide DNA methylation profiles. In addition to shared DNA methylation aberrations present in all our iPSCs, we identified Yamanaka-iPSC (Y-iPSC)-specific and Thomson-iPSC (T-iPSC)-specific recurrent aberrations. Strikingly, not only were the genomic locations of the aberrations different but also their types: reprogramming with Yamanaka factors mainly resulted in failure to demethylate CpGs, whereas reprogramming with Thomson factors mainly resulted in failure to methylate CpGs. Differences in the level of transcripts encoding DNMT3b and TET3 between Y-iPSCs and T-iPSCs may contribute partially to the distinct types of aberrations. Finally, de novo aberrantly methylated genes in Y-iPSCs were enriched for NANOG targets that are also aberrantly methylated in some cancers. Our study thus reveals that the choice of reprogramming factors influences the amount, location, and class of DNA methylation aberrations in iPSCs. These findings may provide clues into how to produce human iPSCs with fewer DNA methylation abnormalities.

Abstract: The γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) that is found in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms has been used in various ways as a signaling molecule or a significant component generating metabolic energy under conditions of nutrient limitation or stress, through GABA catabolism. Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) catalyzes the oxidation of succinic semialdehyde to succinic acid in the final step of GABA catabolism. Here, we report the catalytic properties and two crystal structures of SSADH from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpSSADH) regarding its cofactor preference. Kinetic analysis showed that SpSSADH prefers NADP+ over NAD+ as a hydride acceptor. Moreover, the structures of SpSSADH were determined in an apo-form and in a binary complex with NADP+ at 1.6 Å and 2.1 Å resolutions, respectively. Both structures of SpSSADH showed dimeric conformation, containing a single cysteine residue in the catalytic loop of each subunit. Further structural analysis and sequence comparison of SpSSADH with other SSADHs revealed that Ser158 and Tyr188 in SpSSADH participate in the stabilization of the 2’-phosphate group of adenine-side ribose in NADP+. Our results provide structural insights into the cofactor preference of SpSSADH as the gram-positive bacterial SSADH.

Abstract: The localization of specific claw beta-proteins among the 40 total corneous beta-proteins present in the lizard Anolis carolinensis is not known. The hardness of claws likely depends on glycine–cysteine-rich beta-proteins content, as suggested by previous immunoblot studies. Previous studies have indicated that glycine–cysteine-rich corneous beta-proteins in addition to cysteine-rich alpha-keratins are present in the claw. In order to detect at the ultrastructural level the presence of claw-specific corneous proteins immunofluorescence and electron microscopy immunogold have been utilized. More intense immunoreactivity is obtained for the HgGC3 beta-protein while less intense immunolabeling is seen for HgGC10 and HgG5 beta-proteins and no labeling for the cysteine-rich beta-protein HgC1. The HgGC3 beta-protein appears the prevalent type present in the claw and its numerous cysteines likely form intermolecular disulphide bonds while glycine contributes hydrophobic properties to the corneous material. Other antibodies tagging the core-box and pre-core box regions of beta-proteins label with less intensity the corneous layer. The presence of cysteine-rich alpha-keratins with high homology to some human hair keratins in the dorsal part of the claw suggests that HgGC3-like beta-proteins form numerous disulphide bonds with the larger alpha-keratins giving rise to the hard corneous material of the claw.

Abstract: Summary
The eukaryotic epigenome is shaped by the genome topology in three-dimensional space. Dynamic reversible variations in this epigenome structure directly influence the transcriptional responses to developmental cues. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis long intergenic noncoding RNA (lincRNA) APOLO is transcribed by RNA polymerases II and V in response to auxin, a phytohormone controlling numerous facets of plant development. This dual APOLO transcription regulates the formation of a chromatin loop encompassing the promoter of its neighboring gene PID, a key regulator of polar auxin transport. Altering APOLO expression affects chromatin loop formation, whereas RNA-dependent DNA methylation, active DNA demethylation, and Polycomb complexes control loop dynamics. This dynamic chromatin topology determines PID expression patterns. Hence, the dual transcription of a lincRNA influences local chromatin topology and directs dynamic auxin-controlled developmental outputs on neighboring genes. This mechanism likely underscores the adaptive success of plants in diverse environments and may be widespread in eukaryotes.

Abstract: Summary
Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is an enigmatic disease associated with epigenetic alterations in the subtelomeric heterochromatin of the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeat. Each repeat unit encodes DUX4, a gene that is normally silent in most tissues. Besides muscular loss, most patients suffer retinal vascular telangiectasias. To generate an animal model, we introduced a doxycycline-inducible transgene encoding DUX4 and 3′ genomic DNA into a euchromatic region of the mouse X chromosome. Without induction, DUX4 RNA was expressed at low levels in many tissues and animals displayed a variety of unexpected dominant leaky phenotypes, including male-specific lethality. Remarkably, rare live-born males expressed DUX4 RNA in the retina and presented a retinal vascular telangiectasia. By using doxycycline to induce DUX4 expression in satellite cells, we observed impaired myogenesis in vitro and in vivo. This mouse model, which shows pathologies due to FSHD-related D4Z4 sequences, is likely to be useful for testing anti-DUX4 therapies in FSHD.

Abstract: Summary
Telomeres protect the ends of cellular chromosomes. We show here that infection with herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) results in chromosomal structural aberrations at telomeres and the accumulation of telomere dysfunction-induced DNA damage foci (TIFs). At the molecular level, HSV-1 induces transcription of telomere repeat-containing RNA (TERRA), followed by the proteolytic degradation of the telomere protein TPP1 and loss of the telomere repeat DNA signal. The HSV-1-encoded E3 ubiquitin ligase ICP0 is required for TERRA transcription and facilitates TPP1 degradation. Small hairpin RNA (shRNA) depletion of TPP1 increases viral replication, indicating that TPP1 inhibits viral replication. Viral replication protein ICP8 forms foci that coincide with telomeric proteins, and ICP8-null virus failed to degrade telomere DNA signal. These findings suggest that HSV-1 reorganizes telomeres to form ICP8-associated prereplication foci and to promote viral genomic replication.

Abstract: Summary
In the bone marrow (BM), hematopoietic progenitors (HPs) reside in specific anatomical niches near osteoblasts (Obs), macrophages (MΦs), and other cells forming the BM microenvironment. A connection between immunosurveillance and traffic of HP has been demonstrated, but the regulatory signals that instruct the immune regulation of HP circulation are unknown. We discovered that the BM microenvironment deficiency of p62, an autophagy regulator and signal organizer, results in loss of autophagic repression of macrophage contact-dependent activation of Ob NF-κB signaling. Consequently, Ob p62-deficient mice lose bone, Ob Ccl4 expression, and HP chemotaxis toward Cxcl12, resulting in egress of short-term hematopoietic stem cells and myeloid progenitors. Finally, Ccl4 expression and myeloid progenitor egress are reversed by deficiency of the p62 PB1-binding partner Nbr1. A functional “MΦ-Ob niche” is required for myeloid progenitor/short-term stem cell retention, in which Ob p62 is required to maintain NF-κB signaling repression, osteogenesis, and BM progenitor retention.

Abstract: Summary
In the process of neuronal wiring, axons derived from the same functional group typically extend together, resulting in fascicle formation. How these axons communicate with one another remains largely unknown. Here, we show that protocadherin-17 (Pcdh17) supports this group extension by recruiting actin polymerization regulators to interaxonal contact sites. Pcdh17 is expressed by a subset of amygdala neurons, and it accumulates at axon-axon boundaries because of homophilic binding. Pcdh17 knockout in mice suppressed the extension of these axons. Ectopically expressed Pcdh17 altered the pattern of axon extension. In in vitro cultures, wild-type growth cones normally migrate along other axons, whereas Pcdh17 null growth cones do not. Pcdh17 recruits the WAVE complex, Lamellipodin, and Ena/VASP to cell-cell contacts, converting these sites into motile structures. We propose that, through these mechanisms, Pcdh17 maintains the migration of growth cones that are in contact with other axons, thereby supporting their collective extension.

Abstract: Summary
The human FOXP3 molecule is an oligomeric transcriptional factor able to mediate activities that characterize T regulatory cells, a class of lymphocytes central to the regulation of immune responses. The activity of FOXP3 is regulated at the posttranslational level, in part by two histone acetyltransferases (HATs): TIP60 and p300. TIP60 and p300 work cooperatively to regulate FOXP3 activity. Initially, p300 and TIP60 interactions lead to the activation of TIP60 and facilitate acetylation of K327 of TIP60, which functions as a molecular switch to allow TIP60 to change binding partners. Subsequently, p300 is released from this complex, and TIP60 interacts with and acetylates FOXP3. Maximal induction of FOXP3 activities is observed when both p300 and TIP60 are able to undergo cooperative interactions. Conditional knockout of TIP60 in Treg cells significantly decreases the Treg population in the peripheral immune organs, leading to a scurfy-like fatal autoimmune disease.

Abstract: The digestive tract is the largest endocrine organ in the body; the distribution pattern of endocrine cells varies with different pathological and physiological states. The aim of the present study was to investigate the distributed density of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), gastrin (GAS), somatostatin (SS) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) immunoreactive (IR) cells in the digestive tract of Alligator sinensis during the active and hibernating period by immunohistochemical (IHC) method. The results indicated that 5-HT-IR cells were distributed throughout the entire digestive tract, which were most predominant in duodenum and jejunum. The density increased significantly in stomach and duodenum during hibernation. GAS-IR cells were limited in small stomach and small intestine. The density decreased significantly in small stomach during hibernation, while increased in duodenum. What's more, most of the endocrine cells in duodenum were generally spindle shaped with long cytoplasmic processes ending in the lumen during hibernation. SS-IR cells were limited in stomach and small stomach. The density increased in stomach while decreased in small stomach during hibernation, meanwhile, fewer IR cells occurred in small intestine. VIP-IR cells occurred in stomach and small stomach. The density decreased in small stomach, while increased in stomach during hibernation. These results indicated that the endocrine cells in different parts of digestive tract varied differently during hibernation, their changes were adaptive response to the hibernation.

Abstract: Summary
Disassembly of focal adhesions (FAs) allows cell retraction and integrin detachment from the extracellular matrix, processes critical for cell movement. Growth of microtubules (MTs) can promote FA turnover by serving as tracks to deliver proteins essential for FA disassembly. The molecular nature of this FA “disassembly factor,” however, remains elusive. By quantitative proteomics, we identified mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 4 (MAP4K4) as an FA regulator that associates with MTs. Knockout of MAP4K4 stabilizes FAs and impairs cell migration. By exploring underlying mechanisms, we further show that MAP4K4 associates with ending binding 2 (EB2) and IQ motif and SEC7 domain-containing protein 1 (IQSEC1), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor specific for Arf6, whose activation promotes integrin internalization. Together, our findings provide critical insight into FA disassembly, suggesting that MTs can deliver MAP4K4 toward FAs through EB2, where MAP4K4 can, in turn, activate Arf6 via IQSEC1 and enhance FA dissolution.

Abstract: Summary
Cells of the inner cell mass (ICM) of the mouse blastocyst differentiate into the pluripotent epiblast or the primitive endoderm (PrE), marked by the transcription factors NANOG and GATA6, respectively. To investigate the mechanistic regulation of this process, we applied an unbiased, quantitative, single-cell-resolution image analysis pipeline to analyze embryos lacking or exhibiting reduced levels of GATA6. We find that Gata6 mutants exhibit a complete absence of PrE and demonstrate that GATA6 levels regulate the timing and speed of lineage commitment within the ICM. Furthermore, we show that GATA6 is necessary for PrE specification by FGF signaling and propose a model where interactions between NANOG, GATA6, and the FGF/ERK pathway determine ICM cell fate. This study provides a framework for quantitative analyses of mammalian embryos and establishes GATA6 as a nodal point in the gene regulatory network driving ICM lineage specification.

Abstract: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of quinestrol, a synthetic oestrogen homologue with reproductive toxicity, on the secretion of reproductive hormones and antioxidant status in adult male rat. Our results showed that quinestrol exposure significantly decreased the weight of the testis, epididymides, seminal vesicle, and prostate, as well as the sperm counts in the cauda epididymis of rats. Quinestrol significantly reduced the size of seminiferous tubules and the total number of spermatogenic cells. Serum testosterone, follitropin, and lutropin were also significantly reduced in a dose-related manner after quinestrol exposure. Meanwhile, the activity of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and total antioxide capacity significantly decreased, whereas the malondialdehyde and nitric oxide concentrations significantly increased in the testes. These findings revealed that endocrine disorders of reproductive hormones and oxidative stress may be involved in reproductive toxicity induced by quinestrol in adult male rats.

Abstract: Summary
The cytoskeleton is a major determinant of cell-shape changes that drive the formation of complex tissues during development. Important roles for actomyosin during tissue morphogenesis have been identified, but the role of the microtubule cytoskeleton is less clear. Here, we show that during tubulogenesis of the salivary glands in the fly embryo, the microtubule cytoskeleton undergoes major rearrangements, including a 90° change in alignment relative to the apicobasal axis, loss of centrosomal attachment, and apical stabilization. Disruption of the microtubule cytoskeleton leads to failure of apical constriction in placodal cells fated to invaginate. We show that this failure is due to loss of an apical medial actomyosin network whose pulsatile behavior in wild-type embryos drives the apical constriction of the cells. The medial actomyosin network interacts with the minus ends of acentrosomal microtubule bundles through the cytolinker protein Shot, and disruption of Shot also impairs apical constriction.

Abstract: Obesity is known to be strongly associated with cardiovascular disease and cancer, the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and develops owing to interactions between genes and the environment. DNA methylation can act as a downstream effector of environmental signals, and analysis of this process therefore holds substantial promise for identifying mechanisms through which genetic and environmental factors jointly contribute to disease risk. Global DNA methylation of peripheral blood cells has recently been proposed as a potential biomarker for disease risk. Repetitive element DNA methylation has been shown to be associated with prominent obesity-related chronic diseases, but little is known about its relationship with weight status. In this study, we quantified the methylation of Alu elements in the peripheral blood DNA of 244 healthy women with a range of body mass indexes (BMIs) using pyrosequencing technology. Among the study participants, certain clinical laboratory parameters, including hemoglobin, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, total cholesterol, and triglyceride levels were found to be strongly associated with BMI. Moreover, a U-shaped association between BMI and Alu methylation was observed, with the lowest methylation levels occurring at BMIs of between 23 and 30 kg/m2. However, there was no significant association between Alu methylation and age, smoking status, or alcohol consumption. Overall, we identified a differential influence of BMI on global DNA methylation in healthy Korean women, indicating that BMI-related changes in Alu methylation might play a complex role in the etiology and pathogenesis of obesity. Further studies are required to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this relationship.

Abstract: Summary
Cell polarity in one-cell C. elegans embryos guides asymmetric cell division and cell-fate specification. Shortly after fertilization, embryos establish two antagonistic cortical domains of PAR proteins. Here, we find that the conserved polarity factor PAR-5 regulates PAR domain size in a dose-dependent manner. Using quantitative imaging and controlled genetic manipulation, we find that PAR-5 protein levels reflect the cumulative output of three mRNA isoforms with different translational efficiencies mediated by their 3′ UTRs. 3′ UTR selection is regulated, influencing PAR-5 protein abundance. Alternative splicing underlies the selection of par-5 3′ UTR isoforms. 3′ UTR splicing is enhanced by the SR protein kinase SPK-1, and accordingly, SPK-1 is required for wild-type PAR-5 levels and PAR domain size. Precise regulation of par-5 isoform selection is essential for polarization when the posterior PAR network is compromised. Together, strict control of PAR-5 protein levels and feedback from polarity to par-5 3′ UTR selection confer robustness to embryo polarization.

The RNA Helicase DHX34 Activates NMD by Promoting a Transition from the Surveillance to the Decay-Inducing Complex,

Abstract: Summary
Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is a surveillance mechanism that degrades aberrant mRNAs. A complex comprising SMG1, UPF1, and the translation termination factors eRF1 and eRF3 (SURF) is assembled in the vicinity of a premature termination codon. Subsequently, an interaction with UPF2, UPF3b, and the exon junction complex induces the formation of the decay-inducing complex (DECID) and triggers NMD. We previously identified the RNA helicase DHX34 as an NMD factor in C. elegans and in vertebrates. Here, we investigate the mechanism by which DHX34 activates NMD in human cells. We show that DHX34 is recruited to the SURF complex via its preferential interaction with hypophosphorylated UPF1. A series of molecular transitions induced by DHX34 include enhanced recruitment of UPF2, increased UPF1 phosphorylation, and dissociation of eRF3 from UPF1. Thus, DHX34 promotes mRNP remodeling and triggers the conversion from the SURF complex to the DECID complex resulting in NMD activation.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian cell homeostasis during starvation depends on initiation of autophagy by endoplasmic reticulum-localized phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) synthesis. Formation of double-membrane autophagosomes that engulf cytosolic components requires the LC3-conjugating Atg12–5-16L1 complex. The molecular mechanisms of Atg12–5-16L1 recruitment and significance of PtdIns(3)P synthesis at autophagosome formation sites are unknown. By identifying interacting partners of WIPIs, WD-repeat PtdIns(3)P effector proteins, we found that Atg16L1 directly binds WIPI2b. Mutation experiments and ectopic localization of WIPI2b to plasma membrane show that WIPI2b is a PtdIns(3)P effector upstream of Atg16L1 and is required for LC3 conjugation and starvation-induced autophagy through recruitment of the Atg12–5-16L1 complex. Atg16L1 mutants, which do not bind WIPI2b but bind FIP200, cannot rescue starvation-induced autophagy in Atg16L1-deficient MEFs. WIPI2b is also required for autophagic clearance of pathogenic bacteria. WIPI2b binds the membrane surrounding Salmonella and recruits the Atg12–5-16L1 complex, initiating LC3 conjugation, autophagosomal membrane formation, and engulfment of Salmonella.

Abstract: Summary
Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) degrades different classes of mRNAs, including transcripts with premature termination codons (PTCs). The NMD factor SMG6 initiates degradation of substrate mRNAs by endonucleolytic cleavage. Here, we aim to delineate the cascade of NMD-activating events that culminate in endocleavage. We report that long 3′ UTRs elicit SMG6-mediated endonucleolytic degradation. The presence of an exon-junction complex (EJC) within the 3′ UTR strongly stimulates endocleavage in a distance-independent manner. The interaction of SMG6 with EJCs is not required for endocleavage. Whereas the core NMD component UPF2 supports endonucleolytic decay of long 3′ UTR mRNAs, it is mostly dispensable during EJC-stimulated endocleavage. Using high-throughput sequencing, we map endocleavage positions of different PTC-containing reporter mRNAs and an endogenous NMD substrate to regions directly at and downstream of the termination codon. These results reveal how messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) parameters differentially influence SMG6-executed endonucleolysis and uncover central characteristics of this phenomenon associated with translation termination.

Abstract: Summary
Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are highly aggressive sarcomas that develop sporadically or in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients. There is no effective treatment for MPNSTs and they are typically fatal. To gain insights into MPNST pathogenesis, we utilized an MPNST mouse model that allowed us to study the evolution of these tumors at the transcriptome level. Strikingly, in MPNSTs we found upregulation of a chromatin regulator, Brd4, and show that BRD4 inhibition profoundly suppresses both growth and tumorigenesis. Our findings reveal roles for BET bromodomains in MPNST development and report a mechanism by which bromodomain inhibition induces apoptosis through induction of proapoptotic Bim, which may represent a paradigm shift in therapy for MPNST patients. Moreover, these findings indicate epigenetic mechanisms underlying the balance of anti- and proapoptotic molecules and that bromodomain inhibition can shift this balance in favor of cancer cell apoptosis.

Abstract: Summary
The faithful execution of embryogenesis relies on the ability of organisms to respond to genotoxic stress and to eliminate defective cells that could otherwise compromise viability. In syncytial-stage Drosophila embryos, nuclei with excessive DNA damage undergo programmed elimination through an as-yet poorly understood process of nuclear fallout at the midblastula transition. We show that this involves a Chk2-dependent mechanism of mRNA nuclear retention that is induced by DNA damage and prevents the translation of specific zygotic mRNAs encoding key mitotic, cytoskeletal, and nuclear proteins required to maintain nuclear viability. For histone messages, we show that nuclear retention involves Chk2-mediated inactivation of the Drosophila stem loop binding protein (SLBP), the levels of which are specifically depleted in damaged nuclei following Chk2 phosphorylation, an event that contributes to nuclear fallout. These results reveal a layer of regulation within the DNA damage surveillance systems that safeguard genome integrity in eukaryotes.

Abstract: Dynamic features of Ca2+ interactions with transport and regulatory sites control the Ca2+-fluxes in mammalian Na+/Ca2+(NCX) exchangers bearing the Ca2+-binding regulatory domains on the cytosolic 5L6 loop. The crystal structure of Methanococcus jannaschii NCX (NCX_Mj) may serve as a template for studying ion-transport mechanisms since NCX_Mj does not contain the regulatory domains. The turnover rate of Na+/Ca2+ exchange (kcat=0.5±0.2s−1) in WT–NCX_Mj is 103–104 times slower than in mammalian NCX. In NCX_Mj, the intrinsic equilibrium (Kint) for bidirectional Ca2+ movements (defined as the ratio between the cytosolic and extracellular Km of Ca2+/Ca2+ exchange) is asymmetric, Kint=0.15±0.5. Therefore, the Ca2+ movement from the cytosol to the extracellular side is ∼7-times faster than in the opposite direction, thereby representing a stabilization of outward-facing (extracellular) access. This intrinsic asymmetry accounts for observed differences in the cytosolic and extracellulr Km values having a physiological relevance. Bidirectional Ca2+ movements are also asymmetric in mammalian NCX. Thus, the stabilization of the outward-facing access along the transport cycle is a common feature among NCX orthologs despite huge differences in the ion-transport kinetics. Elongation of the cytosolic 5L6 loop in NCX_Mj by 8 or 14 residues accelerates the ion transport rates (kcat) ∼10 fold, while increasing the Kint values 100–250-fold (Kint=15–35). Therefore, 5L6 controls both the intrinsic equilibrium and rates of bidirectional Ca2+ movements in NCX proteins. Some additional structural elements may shape the kinetic variances among phylogenetically distant NCX variants, although the intrinsic asymmetry (Kint) of bidirectional Ca2+ movements seems to be comparable among evolutionary diverged NCX variants.

Abstract: We investigated apoptotic effects and changes in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) enzyme activity in liver and gill tissues of fish exposed to chlorpyrifos. Three different chlorpyrifos doses (2.25, 4.5 and 6.75μg/L) were administrated to rainbow trout at different time intervals (24, 48, 72 and 96h). Acute exposure to chlorpyrifos showed time dependent decrease in G6PD enzyme activity at all concentrations (p<0.05). Immunohistochemical results showed that chlorpyrifos caused mucous cell loss in gill tissue and apoptosis via caspase-3 activation in fish. The present study suggested that chlorpyrifos inhibits G6PD enzyme and causes mucous cell loss in gill and apoptosis in gill and liver tissues.

Abstract: Summary
Leptin is a critical regulator of metabolism, which acts on brain receptors (Lepr) to reduce energy intake and increase energy expenditure. Some of the cellular pathways mediating leptin’s anorectic actions are identified, but those mediating the thermogenic effects have proven more difficult to decipher. We define a population of neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH) containing the RFamide PrRP, which is activated by leptin. Disruption of Lepr selectively in these cells blocks thermogenic responses to leptin and causes obesity. A separate population of leptin-insensitive PrRP neurons in the brainstem is required, instead, for the satiating actions of the gut-derived hormone cholecystokinin (CCK). Global deletion of PrRP (in a loxSTOPlox-PrRP mouse) results in obesity and attenuated responses to leptin and CCK. Cre-recombinase-mediated reactivation of PrRP in brainstem rescues the anorectic actions of CCK, but reactivation in the hypothalamus is required to re-establish the thermogenic effect of leptin.

Abstract: Premature ovarian failure (POF) is a long-term adverse effect of chemotherapy treatment. However, current available treatment regimens are not optimal. Emerging evidence suggests that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) could restore the structure and function of injured tissues, but the homing and restorative effects of BMSCs on chemotherapy injured ovaries are still not clear. In this study, we found that granulosa cell (GC) apoptosis induced by cisplatin was reduced when BMSCs were migrated to granulosa cells (GCs) in vitro. Chemotherapy-induced POF was induced by intraperitoneal injection of cisplatin in rats. BMSCs labeled with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were injected into the rats via the tail vein to investigate the homing and distribution of BMSCs in vivo. The number of BMSCs in the ovarian hilum and medulla was greater than in the cortex, but no BMSCs were found in the follicles and corpus lutea. In addition, the BMSCs treatment group’s antral follicle count and estradiol levels increased after 30 days, compared with the POF group. Hence, our study demonstrates that intravenously delivered BMSCs can home to the ovaries, and restore its structure and function in POF model rats.

Abstract: The skin is the primary interface between the body and the environment, and has a central role in host defence. In the epidermis, Langerhans’ cells form an interconnecting network of dendritic cells, that play a central role within inflammatory and immune responses of terrestrial and aquatic mammals, but few studies aimed at their characterization have been carried out in cetaceans, so far. Toll-like receptors are crucial players in the innate immune response to microbial invaders. These receptors are expressed on immune cells, such as monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and granulocytes. The aim of this preliminary study was to describe the expression of Toll-like receptor 2 in a stranded striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba) skin. Immunoreactive cells were predominantly found within the stratified squamous epithelium. Other Toll-like receptor 2 positive cells of varying morphology, were found, and may help to increase the knowledge on the interaction occurring between dolphins and the environment in which they live at their most crucial interface: the skin.

Abstract: The epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM, also known as CD326) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is specifically detected in most adenocarcinomas and cancer stem cells. In this study, we performed a Cell systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) experiment to isolate the aptamers against EpCAM. After seven round of Cell SELEX, we identified several aptamer candidates. Among the selected aptamers, EP166 specifically binds to cells expressing EpCAM with an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) in a micromolar range. On the other hand, it did not bind to negative control cells. Moreover, EP166 binds to J1ES cells, a mouse embryonic stem cell line. Therefore, the isolated aptamers against EpCAM could be used as a stem cell marker or in other applications in both stem cell and cancer studies.

Abstract: Summary
There are currently no approved targeted therapies for advanced KRAS mutant (KRASMT) colorectal cancer (CRC). Using a unique systems biology approach, we identified JAK1/2-dependent activation of STAT3 as the key mediator of resistance to MEK inhibitors in KRASMT CRC in vitro and in vivo. Further analyses identified acute increases in c-MET activity following treatment with MEK inhibitors in KRASMT CRC models, which was demonstrated to promote JAK1/2-STAT3-mediated resistance. Furthermore, activation of c-MET following MEK inhibition was found to be due to inhibition of the ERK-dependent metalloprotease ADAM17, which normally inhibits c-MET signaling by promoting shedding of its endogenous antagonist, soluble “decoy” MET. Most importantly, pharmacological blockade of this resistance pathway with either c-MET or JAK1/2 inhibitors synergistically increased MEK-inhibitor-induced apoptosis and growth inhibition in vitro and in vivo in KRASMT models, providing clear rationales for the clinical assessment of these combinations in KRASMT CRC patients.

Abstract: The importance of the TRPV4 channel for human physiology has been highlighted in recent years with the identification of an increasing number of hereditary diseases associated with mutations of this channel. However, the functional understanding of TRPV4 associated pathologies remains a puzzle due to incomplete understanding of the polymodal regulation of TRPV4 channels and lack of insight into the structure–function relationship of the channel. In this work, we identified a series of highly conserved aromatic residues in transmembrane (TM) helices 5–6 with profound importance for TRPV4 activity. Substituting F617, Y621 or F624 in TM5 with leucine reduced channel sensitivity to the agonist 4α-PDD and heat, yet two of these mutants – F617L and Y621L – showed increased activation in response to cell swelling. In TM6, a Y702L mutation significantly reduced sensitivity to all of the above stimuli. In conclusion, we have identified residues in TM5-6 which differentially affect heat and agonist activation, and we have demonstrated distinct activation pathways for 4α-PDD and osmolarity.

Abstract: Summary
Heterogeneous anabolic capacity in cell populations can trigger a phenomenon known as cell competition, through which less active cells are eliminated. Cell competition has been induced experimentally in stem/precursor cell populations in insects and mammals and takes place endogenously in early mouse embryonic cells. Here, we show that cell competition can be efficiently induced in mouse cardiomyocytes by mosaic overexpression of Myc during both gestation and adult life. The expansion of the Myc-overexpressing cardiomyocyte population is driven by the elimination of wild-type cardiomyocytes. Importantly, this cardiomyocyte replacement is phenotypically silent and does not affect heart anatomy or function. These results show that the capacity for cell competition in mammals is not restricted to stem cell populations and suggest that stimulated cell competition has potential as a cardiomyocyte-replacement strategy.

Abstract: Summary
Posttranscriptional maturation is a critical step in microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis that determines mature miRNA levels. In addition to core components (Drosha and DGCR8 [DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 8]) in the microprocessor, regulatory RNA-binding proteins may confer the specificity for recruiting and processing of individual primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs). Here, we identify DDX1 as a regulatory protein that promotes the expression of a subset of miRNAs, including five members in the microRNA-200 (miR-200) family and four miRNAs in an eight-miRNA signature of a mesenchymal ovarian cancer subtype. A majority of DDX1-dependent miRNAs are induced after DNA damage. This induction is facilitated by the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-mediated phosphorylation of DDX1. Inhibiting DDX1 promotes ovarian tumor growth and metastasis in a syngeneic mouse model. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) reveals that low DDX1 levels are associated with poor clinical outcome in patients with serous ovarian cancer. These findings suggest that DDX1 is a key modulator in miRNA maturation and ovarian tumor suppression.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanistic roles for many lncRNAs are poorly understood, in part because their direct interactions with genomic loci and proteins are difficult to assess. Using a method to purify endogenous RNAs and their associated factors, we mapped the genomic binding sites for two highly expressed human lncRNAs, NEAT1 and MALAT1. We show that NEAT1 and MALAT1 localize to hundreds of genomic sites in human cells, primarily over active genes. NEAT1 and MALAT1 exhibit colocalization to many of these loci, but display distinct gene body binding patterns at these sites, suggesting independent but complementary functions for these RNAs. We also identified numerous proteins enriched by both lncRNAs, supporting complementary binding and function, in addition to unique associated proteins. Transcriptional inhibition or stimulation alters localization of NEAT1 on active chromatin sites, implying that underlying DNA sequence does not target NEAT1 to chromatin, and that localization responds to cues involved in the transcription process.

Abstract: Summary
Alternative splicing is important for the development and function of the nervous system, but little is known about the differences in alternative splicing between distinct types of neurons. Furthermore, the factors that control cell-type-specific splicing and the physiological roles of these alternative isoforms are unclear. By monitoring alternative splicing at single-cell resolution in Caenorhabditis elegans, we demonstrate that splicing patterns in different neurons are often distinct and highly regulated. We identify two conserved RNA-binding proteins, UNC-75/CELF and EXC-7/Hu/ELAV, which regulate overlapping networks of splicing events in GABAergic and cholinergic neurons. We use the UNC-75 exon network to discover regulators of synaptic transmission and to identify unique roles for isoforms of UNC-64/Syntaxin, a protein required for synaptic vesicle fusion. Our results indicate that combinatorial regulation of alternative splicing in distinct neurons provides a mechanism to specialize metazoan nervous systems.

Abstract: Summary
Botulinum neurotoxins consist of a metalloprotease linked via a conserved interchain disulfide bond to a heavy chain responsible for neurospecific binding and translocation of the enzymatic domain in the nerve terminal cytosol. The metalloprotease activity is enabled upon disulfide reduction and causes neuroparalysis by cleaving the SNARE proteins. Here, we show that the thioredoxin reductase-thioredoxin protein disulfide-reducing system is present on synaptic vesicles and that it is functional and responsible for the reduction of the interchain disulfide of botulinum neurotoxin serotypes A, C, and E. Specific inhibitors of thioredoxin reductase or thioredoxin prevent intoxication of cultured neurons in a dose-dependent manner and are also very effective inhibitors of the paralysis of the neuromuscular junction. We found that this group of inhibitors of botulinum neurotoxins is very effective in vivo. Most of them are nontoxic and are good candidates as preventive and therapeutic drugs for human botulism.

Abstract: Summary
During development, major metabolic changes occur as cells become more specialized within a lineage. In the case of skeletal muscle, differentiation is accompanied by a switch from a glycolytic proliferative progenitor state to an oxidative postmitotic differentiated state. Such changes require extensive mitochondrial biogenesis leading to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production that needs to be balanced by an antioxidant system. Our analysis of double conditional Pitx2/3 mouse mutants, both in vivo during fetal myogenesis and ex vivo in primary muscle cell cultures, reveals excessive upregulation of ROS levels leading to DNA damage and apoptosis of differentiating cells. This is a consequence of downregulation of Nrf1 and genes for antioxidant enzymes, direct targets of Pitx2/3, leading to decreased expression of antioxidant enzymes, as well as impairment of mitochondrial function. Our analysis identifies Pitx2 and Pitx3 as key regulators of the intracellular redox state preventing DNA damage as cells undergo differentiation.

Abstract: TRPV3, a thermosensitive cation channel, is predominantly expressed in keratinocytes. It contributes to physiological processes such as thermosensation, nociception, and skin development. TRPV3 is polymodally regulated by chemical agonists, innocuous heat, intracellular acidification or by membrane depolarization. By manipulating the content of plasma membrane cholesterol, a key modulator of the physicochemical properties of biological membranes, we here addressed the question, how the lipid environment influences TRPV3. Cholesterol supplementation robustly potentiated TRPV3 channel activity by sensitising it to lower concentrations of chemical activators. In addition, the thermal activation of TRPV3 is significantly shifted to lower temperatures in cholesterol-enriched cells. The sensitising effect of cholesterol was not caused by an increased plasma membrane targeting of the channel. In HaCaT keratinocytes, which natively express TRPV3, a cholesterol-mediated sensitisation of TRPV3-like responses was reproduced. The cholesterol-dependent modulation of TRPV3 activity may provide a molecular mechanism to interpret its involvement in keratinocyte differentiation.

Abstract: Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) serve as electrical pacemakers in the rabbit urethra. Pacemaking activity in ICC results from spontaneous intracellular Ca2+ waves that rely on Ca2+ release from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores. The purpose of this study was to investigate if the action of protein kinase A (PKA) affected the generation of Ca2+ waves in ICC. Intracellular [Ca2+] was measured in fluo-4 loaded ICC, freshly isolated from the rabbit urethra using a Nipkow spinning disc confocal microscope. Application of the PKA inhibitor H-89 (10μM) significantly inhibited the generation of spontaneous Ca2+ waves in ICC and this was associated with a significant decrease in the ER Ca2+ load, measured with 10mM caffeine responses. Ca2+ waves could be rescued in the presence of H-89 by stimulating ryanodine receptors (RyRs) with 1mM caffeine but not by activation of inositol 1,4,5 tri-phosphate receptors (IP3Rs) with 10μM phenylephrine. Increasing intracellular PKA with the cAMP agonists forskolin and 8-bromo-cAMP failed to yield an increase in Ca2+ wave activity. We conclude that PKA may be maximally active under basal conditions in ICC and that inhibition of PKA with H-89 leads to a decreased ER Ca2+ load sufficient to inactivate IP3Rs but not RyRs.

Abstract: Summary
Cell fate acquisition is heavily influenced by direct interactions between master regulators and tissue-specific enhancers. However, it remains unclear how lineage-specifying transcription factors, which are often expressed in both progenitor and mature cell populations, influence cell differentiation. Using in vivo mouse liver development as a model, we identified thousands of enhancers that are bound by the master regulators HNF4A and FOXA2 in a differentiation-dependent manner, subject to chromatin remodeling, and associated with differentially expressed target genes. Enhancers exclusively occupied in the embryo were found to be responsive to developmentally regulated TEAD2 and coactivator YAP1. Our data suggest that Hippo signaling may affect hepatocyte differentiation by influencing HNF4A and FOXA2 interactions with temporal enhancers. In summary, transcription factor-enhancer interactions are not only tissue specific but also differentiation dependent, which is an important consideration for researchers studying cancer biology or mammalian development and/or using transformed cell lines.

Abstract: Summary
Circulating branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) levels are elevated in obesity/diabetes and are a sensitive predictor for type 2 diabetes. Here we show in rats that insulin dose-dependently lowers plasma BCAA levels through induction of hepatic protein expression and activity of branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH), the rate-limiting enzyme in the BCAA degradation pathway. Selective induction of hypothalamic insulin signaling in rats and genetic modulation of brain insulin receptors in mice demonstrate that brain insulin signaling is a major regulator of BCAA metabolism by inducing hepatic BCKDH. Short-term overfeeding impairs the ability of brain insulin to lower BCAAs in rats. High-fat feeding in nonhuman primates and obesity and/or diabetes in humans is associated with reduced BCKDH protein in liver. These findings support the concept that decreased hepatic BCKDH is a major cause of increased plasma BCAAs and that hypothalamic insulin resistance may account for impaired BCAA metabolism in obesity and diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
Disorders arising from impaired assembly of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) result in a myriad of pathologies, consistent with its unique role in linking the citric acid cycle and electron transport chain. In spite of this critical function, however, only a few factors are known to be required for SDH assembly and function. We show here that two factors, Sdh6 (SDHAF1) and Sdh7 (SDHAF3), mediate maturation of the FeS cluster SDH subunit (Sdh2/SDHB). Yeast and Drosophila lacking SDHAF3 are impaired in SDH activity with reduced levels of Sdh2. Drosophila lacking the Sdh7 ortholog SDHAF3 are hypersensitive to oxidative stress and exhibit muscular and neuronal dysfunction. Yeast studies revealed that Sdh6 and Sdh7 act together to promote Sdh2 maturation by binding to a Sdh1/Sdh2 intermediate, protecting it from the deleterious effects of oxidants. These studies in yeast and Drosophila raise the possibility that SDHAF3 mutations may be associated with idiopathic SDH-associated diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Biological roles for UFM1, a ubiquitin-like protein, are largely unknown, and therefore we screened for targets of ufmylation. Here we show that ufmylation of the nuclear receptor coactivator ASC1 is a key step for ERα transactivation in response to 17β-estradiol (E2). In the absence of E2, the UFM1-specific protease UfSP2 was bound to ASC1, which maintains ASC1 in a nonufmylated state. In the presence of E2, ERα bound ASC1 and displaced UfSP2, leading to ASC1 ufmylation. Polyufmylation of ASC1 enhanced association of p300, SRC1, and ASC1 at promoters of ERα target genes. ASC1 overexpression or UfSP2 knockdown promoted ERα-mediated tumor formation in vivo, which could be abrogated by treatment with the anti-breast cancer drug tamoxifen. In contrast, expression of ufmylation-deficient ASC1 mutant or knockdown of the UFM1-activating E1 enzyme UBA5 prevented tumor growth. These findings establish a role for ASC1 ufmylation in breast cancer development by promoting ERα transactivation.

Abstract: Summary
Colorectal cancer (CRC) initiation and growth is often attributed to stem cells, yet little is known about the regulation of these cells. We show here that a subpopulation of Prox1-transcription-factor-expressing cells have stem cell activity in intestinal adenomas, but not in the normal intestine. Using in vivo models and 3D ex vivo organoid cultures of mouse adenomas and human CRC, we found that Prox1 deletion reduced the number of stem cells and cell proliferation and decreased intestinal tumor growth via induction of annexin A1 and reduction of the actin-binding protein filamin A, which has been implicated as a prognostic marker in CRC. Loss of Prox1 also decreased autophagy and the survival of hypoxic tumor cells in tumor transplants. Thus, Prox1 is essential for the expansion of the stem cell pool in intestinal adenomas and CRC without being critical for the normal functions of the gut.

Abstract: Summary
The first lineage choice in mammalian embryogenesis is that between the trophectoderm, which gives rise to the trophoblast of the placenta, and the inner cell mass, from which is derived the embryo proper and the yolk sac. The establishment of these lineages is preceded by the inside-versus-outside positioning of cells in the early embryo and stochastic expression of key transcription factors, which is then resolved into lineage-restricted expression. The regulatory inputs that drive this restriction and how they relate to cell position are largely unknown. Here, we show an unsuspected role of Notch signaling in regulating trophectoderm-specific expression of Cdx2 in cooperation with TEAD4. Notch activity is restricted to outer cells and is able to influence positional allocation of blastomeres, mediating preferential localization to the trophectoderm. Our results show that multiple signaling inputs at preimplantation stages specify the first embryonic lineages.

Abstract: Summary
Canonical Wnt signaling is thought to regulate cell behavior mainly by inducing β-catenin-dependent transcription of target genes. In proliferating cells Wnt signaling peaks in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, but the significance of this “mitotic Wnt signaling” is unclear. Here we introduce Wnt-dependent stabilization of proteins (Wnt/STOP), which is independent of β-catenin and peaks during mitosis. We show that Wnt/STOP plays a critical role in protecting proteins, including c-MYC, from GSK3-dependent polyubiquitination and degradation. Wnt/STOP signaling increases cellular protein levels and cell size. Wnt/STOP, rather than β-catenin signaling, is the dominant mode of Wnt signaling in several cancer cell lines, where it is required for cell growth. We propose that Wnt/STOP signaling slows down protein degradation as cells prepare to divide.

Abstract: Summary
Polyubiquitination by E2 and E3 enzymes is a predominant mechanism regulating protein function. Some RING E3s, including anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC), catalyze polyubiquitination by sequential reactions with two different E2s. An initiating E2 ligates ubiquitin to an E3-bound substrate. Another E2 grows a polyubiquitin chain on the ubiquitin-primed substrate through poorly defined mechanisms. Here we show that human APC’s RING domain is repurposed for dual functions in polyubiquitination. The canonical RING surface activates an initiating E2-ubiquitin intermediate for substrate modification. However, APC engages and activates its specialized ubiquitin chain-elongating E2 UBE2S in ways that differ from current paradigms. During chain assembly, a distinct APC11 RING surface helps deliver a substrate-linked ubiquitin to accept another ubiquitin from UBE2S. Our data define mechanisms of APC/UBE2S-mediated polyubiquitination, reveal diverse functions of RING E3s and E2s, and provide a framework for understanding distinctive RING E3 features specifying ubiquitin chain elongation.

Abstract: In the present work we studied the distribution of YB-1 in the nuclei of mouse hepatocytes, early embryos and human skin fibroblasts with the use of light and electron microscopy. To reveal YB-1, we applied rat polyclonal antibody against the C-terminal fragment of YB-1 molecule and rabbit polyclonal antibody against full-length YB-1 molecule. YB-1 distribution patterns varied significantly in different cell types. YB-1 was found to be colocalized with RNA polymerase I in mouse hepatocytes and embryos. Besides, YB-1 was revealed in a population of Cajal bodies in 2-cell mouse embryos but not in other cells studied.

Abstract: NOG1 is a nucleolar GTPase that is critical for 60S ribosome biogenesis. Recently, NOG1 was identified as one of the downstream regulators of target of rapamycin (TOR) in yeast. It is reported that TOR is involved in regulating lifespan and fat storage in Caenorhabditis elegans. Here, we show that the nog1 ortholog (T07A9.9: nog-1) in C. elegans regulates growth, development, lifespan, and fat metabolism. A green fluorescence protein (GFP) promoter assay revealed ubiquitous expression of C. elegans nog-1 from the early embryonic to the adult stage. Furthermore, the GFP-tagged NOG-1 protein is localized to the nucleus, whereas the aberrant NOG-1 protein is concentrated in the nucleolus. Functional studies of NOG-1 in C. elegans further revealed that nog-1 knockdown resulted in smaller broodsize, slower growth, increased life span, and more fat storage. Moreover, nog-1 over-expression resulted in decreased life span. Taken together, our data suggest that nog-1 in C. elegans may be an important player in regulating life span and fat storage via the insulin/IGF pathway.

Abstract: The ubiquitous InsP3/Ca2+ signalling pathway is modulated by diverse mechanisms, i.e. feedback of Ca2+ and interactions with other signalling pathways. In the salivary glands of the blowfly Calliphora vicina, the hormone serotonin (5-HT) causes a parallel rise in intracellular [Ca2+] and [cAMP] via two types of 5-HT receptors. We have shown recently that cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) sensitizes InsP3-induced Ca2+ release. We have now identified the protein phosphatase that counteracts the effect of PKA on 5-HT-induced InsP3/Ca2+ signalling. We demonstrate that (1) tautomycin and okadaic acid, inhibitors of protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A, have no effect on 5-HT-induced Ca2+ signals; (2) cyclosporin A and FK506, inhibitors of Ca2+/calmodulin-activated protein phosphatase calcineurin, cause an increase in the frequency of 5-HT-induced Ca2+ oscillations; (3) the sensitizing effect of cyclosporin A on 5-HT-induced Ca2+ responses does not involve Ca2+ entry into the cells; (4) cyclosporin A increases InsP3-dependent Ca2+ release; (5) inhibition of PKA abolishes the effect of cyclosporin A on the 5-HT-induced Ca2+ responses, indicating that PKA and calcineurin act antagonistically on the InsP3/Ca2+ signalling pathway. These findings suggest that calcineurin provides a negative feedback on InsP3/Ca2+ signalling in blowfly salivary glands, counteracting the effect of PKA and desensitizing the signalling cascade at higher 5-HT concentrations.

Abstract: During early-to-middle spermiogenesis in multicellular, internally fertilizing charalean green algae (Chara fibrosa, Chara vulgaris, Chara tomentosa, Nitella missouriensis), patterning of chromatin/nucleoplasm in developing spermatid nuclei changes from granules→fibers→contorted lamellae→condensed chromatin. Cytochemical, immunocytochemical, electrophoretic studies on C. vulgaris and C. tomentosa spermatids (Kwiatkowska, Poplonska) and amino acid analysis of protamines in Chara corallina sperm (Reynolds, Wolfe), indicate that more positively charged protamines replace histones directly during spermiogenesis, not indirectly through other intermediate transitional proteins as in internally fertilizing neogastropods and sharks with more ordered spermatid lamellae. We hypothesize that such lamellar-mediated patterning is due to liquid–liquid phase separation by spinodal decomposition. This is a spontaneous thermodynamic process that involves diffusive instability of a lamellar chromatin network, a dominant pattern repeat distance and bicontinuity of chromatin/nucleoplasm phases. C. vulgaris sperm show contorted lamellae in the posterior region, whereas C. corallina sperm display contorted peripheral lamellae and interior fibrils. Among internally fertilizing liverworts, which may have evolved from Zygnematales, mid-spermatid nuclei lack lamellae. Instead they display self-coiled chromatin rods in Blasia pusilla, contain short chromatin tubules in Haplomitrium hookeri resembling those in internally fertilizing mosses and a hornwort and indirectly replace histones with protamines in Marchantia polymorpha.

Abstract: In the myometrium SR Ca2+ depletion promotes an increase in force but unlike several other smooth muscles, there is no Ca2+ sparks-STOCs coupling mechanism to explain this. Given the importance of the control of contractility for successful parturition, we have examined, in pregnant rat myometrium, the effects of SR Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) inhibition on the temporal relationship between action potentials, Ca2+ transients and force. Simultaneous recording of electrical activity, calcium and force showed that SERCA inhibition, by cyclopiazonic acid (CPA 20μM), caused time-dependent changes in excitability, most noticeably depolarization and elevations of baseline [Ca2+]i and force. At the onset of these changes there was a prolongation of the bursts of action potentials and a corresponding series of Ca2+ spikes, which increased the amplitude and duration of contractions. As the rise of baseline Ca2+ and depolarization continued a point was reached when electrical and Ca2+ spikes and phasic contractions ceased, and a maintained, tonic force and Ca2+ was produced. Lanthanum, a non-selective blocker of store-operated Ca2+ entry, but not the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine (1–10μM), could abolish the maintained force and calcium. Application of the agonist, carbachol, produced similar effects to CPA, i.e. depolarization, elevation of force and calcium. A brief, high concentration of carbachol, to cause SR Ca2+ depletion without eliciting receptor-operated channel opening, also produced these results. The data obtained suggest that in pregnant rats SR Ca2+ release is coupled to marked Ca2+ entry, via store operated Ca2+ channels, leading to depolarization and enhanced electrical and mechanical activity.

Abstract: Summary
LPIN1 encodes lipin-1, a phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP) enzyme that catalyzes the dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid to form diacylglycerol. Homozygous LPIN1 gene mutations cause severe rhabdomyolysis, and heterozygous LPIN1 missense mutations may promote statin-induced myopathy. We demonstrate that lipin-1–related myopathy in the mouse is associated with a blockade in autophagic flux and accumulation of aberrant mitochondria. Lipin-1 PAP activity is required for maturation of autolysosomes, through its activation of the protein kinase D (PKD)-Vps34 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling cascade. Statin treatment also reduces PKD activation and autophagic flux, which are compounded by diminished mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) abundance in lipin-1-haploinsufficent and -deficient muscle. Lipin-1 restoration in skeletal muscle prevents myonecrosis and statin toxicity in vivo, and activated PKD rescues autophagic flux in lipin-1-deficient cells. Our findings identify lipin-1 PAP activity as a component of the macroautophagy pathway and define the basis for lipin-1-related myopathies.

Abstract: Summary
The development of cancer is driven not only by genetic mutations but also by epigenetic alterations. Here, we show that TET1-mediated production of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is required for the tumorigenicity of glioblastoma cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that chromatin target of PRMT1 (CHTOP) binds to 5hmC. We found that CHTOP is associated with an arginine methyltransferase complex, termed the methylosome, and that this promotes the PRMT1-mediated methylation of arginine 3 of histone H4 (H4R3) in genes involved in glioblastomagenesis, including EGFR, AKT3, CDK6, CCND2, and BRAF. Moreover, we found that CHTOP and PRMT1 are essential for the expression of these genes and that CHTOP is required for the tumorigenicity of glioblastoma cells. These results suggest that 5hmC plays a critical role in glioblastomagenesis by recruiting the CHTOP-methylosome complex to selective sites on the chromosome, where it methylates H4R3 and activates the transcription of cancer-related genes.

Abstract: Summary
The ubiquitin-like SUMO system regulates gene expression, but the molecular insights into this process are incomplete. We show that the SUMO-specific isopeptidase SENP3 controls H3K4 methylation by regulating histone-modifying SET1/MLL complexes. SET1/MLL complexes are composed of a histone methyltransferase and the regulatory components WDR5, RbBP5, Ash2L, and DPY-30. MLL1/MLL2 complexes contain menin as additional component and are particularly important for the activation of HOX genes. We demonstrate that SENP3 is associated with MLL1/MLL2 complexes and catalyzes deSUMOylation of RbBP5. This is required for activation of a subset of HOX genes, including the developmental regulator DLX3. In the absence of SENP3, the association of menin and Ash2L with the DLX3 gene is impaired, leading to decreased H3K4 methylation and reduced recruitment of active RNA polymerase II. Importantly, the SENP3-DLX3 pathway dictates osteogenic differentiation of human stem cells, thus delineating the importance of balanced SUMOylation for epigenetic control of gene expression programs.

Abstract: Summary
Accumulating evidence indicates that human natural killer (NK) cells develop in secondary lymphoid tissue (SLT) through a so-called “stage 3” developmental intermediate minimally characterized by a CD34−CD117+CD94− immunophenotype that lacks mature NK cell function. This stage 3 population is heterogeneous, potentially composed of functionally distinct innate lymphoid cell (ILC) types that include interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R1)-positive, IL-22-producing ILC3s. Whether human ILC3s are developmentally related to NK cells is a subject of ongoing investigation. Here, we show that antagonism of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) or silencing of AHR gene expression promotes the differentiation of tonsillar IL-22-producing IL-1R1hi human ILC3s to CD56brightCD94+ interferon (IFN)-γ-producing cytolytic mature NK cells expressing eomesodermin (EOMES) and T-Box Protein 21 (TBX21 or TBET). Hence, we demonstrate the lineage plasticity of human ILCs by identifying AHR as a transcription factor that prevents IL-1R1hi ILC3s from differentiating into NK cells.

Abstract: Summary
Activation of the T cell receptor (TCR) by antigen is the key step in adaptive immunity. In the αβTCR, antigen induces a conformational change at the CD3 subunits (CD3 CC) that is absolutely required for αβTCR activation. Here, we demonstrate that the CD3 CC is not induced by antigen stimulation of the mouse G8 or the human Vγ9Vδ2 γδTCR. We find that there is a fundamental difference between the activation mechanisms of the αβTCR and γδTCR that map to the constant regions of the TCRαβ/γδ heterodimers. Enforced induction of CD3 CC with a less commonly used monoclonal anti-CD3 promoted proximal γδTCR signaling but inhibited cytokine secretion. Utilizing this knowledge, we could dramatically improve in vitro tumor cell lysis by activated human γδ T cells. Thus, manipulation of the CD3 CC might be exploited to improve clinical γδ T cell-based immunotherapies.

Abstract: Summary
Growth cones facilitate the repair of nervous system damage by providing the driving force for axon regeneration. Using single-neuron laser axotomy and in vivo time-lapse imaging, we show that syndecan, a heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycan, is required for growth cone function during axon regeneration in C. elegans. In the absence of syndecan, regenerating growth cones form but are unstable and collapse, decreasing the effective growth rate and impeding regrowth to target cells. We provide evidence that syndecan has two distinct functions during axon regeneration: (1) a canonical function in axon guidance that requires expression outside the nervous system and depends on HS chains and (2) an intrinsic function in growth cone stabilization that is mediated by the syndecan core protein, independently of HS. Thus, syndecan is a regulator of a critical choke point in nervous system repair.

Here, we developed a channelrhodopsin-assisted patching method allowing the efficient in vivo targeted recording of neurons identified by their molecular, electrophysiological, and morphological features. The method has a high yield, does not require visual guidance, and thus can be applied at any depth in the brain. This approach overcomes limitations of present technologies. We validate this strategy with in vivo recordings of identified subtypes of GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons in deep cortical layers, subcortical cholinergic neurons, and neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus in anesthetized and awake mice. We propose this method as an important complement to existing technologies to relate specific cell-type activity to brain circuitry, function, and behavior.

Abstract: Summary
More than half of human cancers have aberrantly upregulated phosphoinositide signals; yet how phospholipid signals are controlled during tumorigenesis is not fully understood. We report here that TIPE3 (TNFAIP8L3) is the transfer protein of phosphoinositide second messengers that promote cancer. High-resolution crystal structure of TIPE3 shows a large hydrophobic cavity that is occupied by a phospholipid-like molecule. TIPE3 preferentially captures and shuttles two lipid second messengers, i.e., phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, and increases their levels in the plasma membrane. Notably, human cancers have markedly upregulated TIPE3 expression. Knocking out TIPE3 diminishes tumorigenesis, whereas enforced TIPE3 expression enhances it in vivo. Thus, the function and metabolism of phosphoinositide second messengers are controlled by a specific transfer protein during tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Axonal degeneration arises as a consequence of neuronal injury and is a common hallmark of a number of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the genetic causes and the cellular mechanisms that trigger this process are still largely unknown. Based on forward genetic screening in C. elegans, we have identified the α-tubulin acetyltransferase gene mec-17 as causing spontaneous, adult-onset, and progressive axonal degeneration. Loss of MEC-17 leads to microtubule instability, a reduction in mitochondrial number, and disrupted axonal transport, with altered distribution of both mitochondria and synaptic components. Furthermore, mec-17-mediated axonal degeneration occurs independently from its acetyltransferase domain; is enhanced by mutation of coel-1, a tubulin-associated molecule; and correlates with the animal’s body length. This study therefore identifies a critical role for the conserved microtubule-associated protein MEC-17 in preserving axon integrity and preventing axonal degeneration.

Abstract: Summary
In mammals, cytosine methylation (5mC) is widely distributed throughout the genome but is notably depleted from active promoters and enhancers. While the role of DNA methylation in promoter silencing has been well documented, the function of this epigenetic mark at enhancers remains unclear. Recent experiments have demonstrated that enhancers are enriched for 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), an oxidization product of the Tet family of 5mC dioxygenases and an intermediate of DNA demethylation. These results support the involvement of Tet proteins in the regulation of dynamic DNA methylation at enhancers. By mapping DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation at base resolution, we find that deletion of Tet2 causes extensive loss of 5hmC at enhancers, accompanied by enhancer hypermethylation, reduction of enhancer activity, and delayed gene induction in the early steps of differentiation. Our results reveal that DNA demethylation modulates enhancer activity, and its disruption influences the timing of transcriptome reprogramming during cellular differentiation.

Abstract: The effects of quinestrol on spermatogenesis were investigated in adult male mice by daily intragastric administration of quinestrol with various doses of 5, 10, 50 and 100mg/kg body weight for 10 days. The sperm counts declined while the number of abnormal spermatozoa went up in mice treated with quinestrol. The testicular weight and seminiferous tubular area gradually declined with increasing dosages of quinestrol to 50 and 100mg/kg. Rarefied germ cells showed irregular distributions in the seminiferous tubules of mice treated with 50 and 100mg/kg quinestrol. Apoptosis was highly pronounced in spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids and Leydig cells. Antioxidant enzyme activities – superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase – as well as total antioxidant capacity significantly reduced, while malondialdehyde contents increased. The number of germ cells expressing caspase-3, p53, Bax and FasL significantly increased whereas cells expressing Bcl-2 significantly decreased in groups treated with 50 and 100mg/kg quinestrol compared with the control. The concentration of nitrogen monoxidum also increased significantly under these dosages. The results suggest that quinestrol stimulates oxidative stress to induce apoptosis in spermatogenic cells through the mitochondrial and death receptor pathways in adult male mice.

Abstract: Summary
The dorsal mesentery (DM) is the major conduit for blood and lymphatic vessels in the gut. The mechanisms underlying their morphogenesis are challenging to study and remain unknown. Here we show that arteriogenesis in the DM begins during gut rotation and proceeds strictly on the left side, dependent on the Pitx2 target gene Cxcl12. Although competent Cxcr4-positive angioblasts are present on the right, they fail to form vessels and progressively emigrate. Surprisingly, gut lymphatics also initiate in the left DM and arise only after—and dependent on—arteriogenesis, implicating arteries as drivers of gut lymphangiogenesis. Our data begin to unravel the origin of two distinct vascular systems and demonstrate how early left-right molecular asymmetries are translated into organ-specific vascular patterns. We propose a dual origin of gut lymphangiogenesis in which prior arterial growth is required to initiate local lymphatics that only subsequently connect to the vascular system.

Abstract: Summary
The RET receptor tyrosine kinase is essential to vertebrate development and implicated in multiple human diseases. RET binds a cell surface bipartite ligand comprising a GDNF family ligand and a GFRα coreceptor, resulting in RET transmembrane signaling. We present a hybrid structural model, derived from electron microscopy (EM) and low-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data, of the RET extracellular domain (RETECD), GDNF, and GFRα1 ternary complex, defining the basis for ligand recognition. RETECD envelopes the dimeric ligand complex through a composite binding site comprising four discrete contact sites. The GFRα1-mediated contacts are crucial, particularly close to the invariant RET calcium-binding site, whereas few direct contacts are made by GDNF, explaining how distinct ligand/coreceptor pairs are accommodated. The RETECD cysteine-rich domain (CRD) contacts both ligand components and makes homotypic membrane-proximal interactions occluding three different antibody epitopes. Coupling of these CRD-mediated interactions suggests models for ligand-induced RET activation and ligand-independent oncogenic deregulation.

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer is one of the most fatal cancers and is associated with limited diagnostic and therapeutic modalities. Currently, gemcitabine is the only effective drug and represents the preferred first-line treatment for chemotherapy. However, a high level of intrinsic or acquired resistance of pancreatic cancer to gemcitabine can contribute to the failure of gemcitabine treatment. To investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms for gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cancer, we performed label-free quantification of protein expression in intrinsic gemcitabine-resistant and - sensitive human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines using our improved proteomic strategy, combined with filter-aided sample preparation, single-shot liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, enhanced spectral counting, and a statistical method based on a power law global error model. We identified 1931 proteins and quantified 787 differentially expressed proteins in the BxPC3, PANC-1, and HPDE cell lines. Bioinformatics analysis identified 15 epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and 13 EMT-related proteins that were closely associated with drug resistance were differentially expressed. Interestingly, 8 of these proteins were involved in glutathione and cysteine/methionine metabolism. These results suggest that proteins related to the EMT and glutathione metabolism play important roles in the development of intrinsic gemcitabine resistance by pancreatic cancer cell lines.

Abstract: Summary
RNA-based regulation and CRISPR/Cas transcription factors (CRISPR-TFs) have the potential to be integrated for the tunable modulation of gene networks. A major limitation of this methodology is that guide RNAs (gRNAs) for CRISPR-TFs can only be expressed from RNA polymerase III promoters in human cells, limiting their use for conditional gene regulation. We present new strategies that enable expression of functional gRNAs from RNA polymerase II promoters and multiplexed production of proteins and gRNAs from a single transcript in human cells. We use multiple RNA regulatory strategies, including RNA-triple-helix structures, introns, microRNAs, and ribozymes, with Cas9-based CRISPR-TFs and Cas6/Csy4-based RNA processing. Using these tools, we efficiently modulate endogenous promoters and implement tunable synthetic circuits, including multistage cascades and RNA-dependent networks that can be rewired with Csy4 to achieve complex behaviors. This toolkit can be used for programming scalable gene circuits and perturbing endogenous networks for biology, therapeutic, and synthetic biology applications.

Abstract: Summary
Chromosomes are folded, spatially organized, and regulated by epigenetic marks. How chromosomal architecture is connected to the epigenome is not well understood. We show that chromosomal architecture of Arabidopsis is tightly linked to the epigenetic state. Furthermore, we show how physical constraints, such as nuclear size, correlate with the folding principles of chromatin. We also describe a nuclear structure, termed KNOT, in which genomic regions of all five Arabidopsis chromosomes interact. These KNOT ENGAGED ELEMENT (KEE) regions represent heterochromatic islands within euchromatin. Similar to PIWI-interacting RNA clusters, such as flamenco in Drosophila, KEEs represent preferred landing sites for transposable elements, which may be part of a transposon defense mechanism in the Arabidopsis nucleus.

PRP19 Transforms into a Sensor of RPA-ssDNA after DNA Damage and Drives ATR Activation via a Ubiquitin-Mediated Circuitry,

Abstract: Summary
PRP19 is a ubiquitin ligase involved in pre-mRNA splicing and the DNA damage response (DDR). Although the role for PRP19 in splicing is well characterized, its role in the DDR remains elusive. Through a proteomic screen for proteins that interact with RPA-coated single-stranded DNA (RPA-ssDNA), we identified PRP19 as a sensor of DNA damage. PRP19 directly binds RPA and localizes to DNA damage sites via RPA, promoting RPA ubiquitylation in a DNA-damage-induced manner. PRP19 facilitates the accumulation of ATRIP, the regulatory partner of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase, at DNA damage sites. Depletion of PRP19 compromised the phosphorylation of ATR substrates, recovery of stalled replication forks, and progression of replication forks on damaged DNA. Importantly, PRP19 mutants that cannot bind RPA or function as an E3 ligase failed to support the ATR response, revealing that PRP19 drives ATR activation by acting as an RPA-ssDNA-sensing ubiquitin ligase during the DDR.

Abstract: Summary
Oncogenic transcription factors such as RUNX1/ETO, which is generated by the chromosomal translocation t(8;21), subvert normal blood cell development by impairing differentiation and driving malignant self-renewal. Here, we use digital footprinting and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify the core RUNX1/ETO-responsive transcriptional network of t(8;21) cells. We show that the transcriptional program underlying leukemic propagation is regulated by a dynamic equilibrium between RUNX1/ETO and RUNX1 complexes, which bind to identical DNA sites in a mutually exclusive fashion. Perturbation of this equilibrium in t(8;21) cells by RUNX1/ETO depletion leads to a global redistribution of transcription factor complexes within preexisting open chromatin, resulting in the formation of a transcriptional network that drives myeloid differentiation. Our work demonstrates on a genome-wide level that the extent of impaired myeloid differentiation in t(8;21) is controlled by the dynamic balance between RUNX1/ETO and RUNX1 activities through the repression of transcription factors that drive differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
During development, region-specific patterns of regulatory gene expression are controlled by signaling centers that release morphogens providing positional information to surrounding cells. Regulation of signaling centers themselves is therefore critical. The size and the influence of a Shh-producing forebrain organizer, the zona limitans intrathalamica (ZLI), are limited by Pax6. By studying mouse chimeras, we find that Pax6 acts cell autonomously to block Shh expression in cells around the ZLI. Immunoprecipitation and luciferase assays indicate that Pax6 can bind the Shh promoter and repress its function. An analysis of chimeras suggests that many of the regional gene expression pattern defects that occur in Pax6−/− diencephalic cells result from a non-cell-autonomous position-dependent defect of local intercellular signaling. Blocking Shh signaling in Pax6−/− mutants reverses major diencephalic patterning defects. We conclude that Pax6’s cell-autonomous repression of Shh expression around the ZLI is critical for many aspects of normal diencephalic patterning.

Abstract: Summary
In a genome-wide survey on somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs) of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) in 2,394 tumor specimens from 12 cancer types, we found that about 21.8% of lncRNA genes were located in regions with focal SCNAs. By integrating bioinformatics analyses of lncRNA SCNAs and expression with functional screening assays, we identified an oncogene, focally amplified lncRNA on chromosome 1 (FAL1), whose copy number and expression are correlated with outcomes in ovarian cancer. FAL1 associates with the epigenetic repressor BMI1 and regulates its stability in order to modulate the transcription of a number of genes including CDKN1A. The oncogenic activity of FAL1 is partially attributable to its repression of p21. FAL1-specific siRNAs significantly inhibit tumor growth in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Biogenesis of eukaryotic messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes (mRNPs) involves the synthesis, splicing, and 3′ processing of pre-mRNA, and the assembly of mature mRNPs for nuclear export. We mapped 23 mRNP biogenesis factors onto the yeast transcriptome, providing 104–106 high-confidence RNA interaction sites per factor. The data reveal how mRNP biogenesis factors recognize pre-mRNA elements in vivo. They define conserved interactions between splicing factors and pre-mRNA introns, including the recognition of intron-exon junctions and the branchpoint. They also identify a unified arrangement of 3′ processing factors at pre-mRNA polyadenylation (pA) sites in yeast and human, which results from an A-U sequence bias at pA sites. Global data analysis indicates that 3′ processing factors have roles in splicing and RNA surveillance, and that they couple mRNP biogenesis events to restrict nuclear export to mature mRNPs.

Abstract: Summary
The RUNX genes encode transcription factors involved in development and human disease. RUNX1 and RUNX3 are frequently associated with leukemias, yet the basis for their involvement in leukemogenesis is not fully understood. Here, we show that Runx1;Runx3 double-knockout (DKO) mice exhibited lethal phenotypes due to bone marrow failure and myeloproliferative disorder. These contradictory clinical manifestations are reminiscent of human inherited bone marrow failure syndromes such as Fanconi anemia (FA), caused by defective DNA repair. Indeed, Runx1;Runx3 DKO cells showed mitomycin C hypersensitivity, due to impairment of monoubiquitinated-FANCD2 recruitment to DNA damage foci, although FANCD2 monoubiquitination in the FA pathway was unaffected. RUNX1 and RUNX3 interact with FANCD2 independently of CBFβ, suggesting a nontranscriptional role for RUNX in DNA repair. These findings suggest that RUNX dysfunction causes DNA repair defect, besides transcriptional misregulation, and promotes the development of leukemias and other cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Alternative splicing plays important regulatory roles during periods of physiological change. During development, a large number of genes coordinately express protein isoform transitions regulated by alternative splicing; however, the mechanisms that coordinate splicing and the functional integration of the resultant tissue-specific protein isoforms are typically unknown. Here we show that the conserved Rbfox2 RNA binding protein regulates 30% of the splicing transitions observed during myogenesis and is required for the specific step of myoblast fusion. Integration of Rbfox2-dependent splicing outcomes from RNA-seq with Rbfox2 iCLIP data identified Mef2d and Rock2 as Rbfox2 splicing targets. Restored activities of Mef2d and Rock2 rescued myoblast fusion in Rbfox2-depleted cultures, demonstrating functional cooperation of protein isoforms generated by coordinated alterative splicing. The results demonstrate that coordinated alternative splicing by a single RNA binding protein modulates transcription (Mef2d) and cell signaling (Rock2) programs to drive tissue-specific functions (cell fusion) to promote a developmental transition.

Abstract: Summary
Hyporesponsiveness by phagocytes is a well-known phenomenon in sepsis that is frequently induced by low-dose endotoxin stimulation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) but can also be found under sterile inflammatory conditions. We now demonstrate that the endogenous alarmins MRP8 and MRP14 induce phagocyte hyporesponsiveness via chromatin modifications in a TLR4-dependent manner that results in enhanced survival to septic shock in mice. During sterile inflammation, polytrauma and burn trauma patients initially present with high serum concentrations of myeloid-related proteins (MRPs). Human neonatal phagocytes are primed for hyporesponsiveness by increased peripartal MRP concentrations, which was confirmed in murine neonatal endotoxinemia in wild-type and MRP14−/− mice. Our data therefore indicate that alarmin-triggered phagocyte tolerance represents a regulatory mechanism for the susceptibility of neonates during systemic infections and sterile inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic evidence has implicated multiple pathways in eukaryotic DNA mismatch repair (MMR) downstream of mispair recognition and Mlh1-Pms1 recruitment, including Exonuclease 1 (Exo1)-dependent and -independent pathways. We identified 14 mutations in POL30, which encodes PCNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, specific to Exo1-independent MMR. The mutations identified affected amino acids at three distinct sites on the PCNA structure. Multiple mutant PCNA proteins had defects either in trimerization and Msh2-Msh6 binding or in activation of the Mlh1-Pms1 endonuclease that initiates excision during MMR. The latter class of mutations led to hyperaccumulation of repair intermediate Mlh1-Pms1 foci and were enhanced by an msh6 mutation that disrupted the Msh2-Msh6 interaction with PCNA. These results reveal a central role for PCNA in the Exo1-independent MMR pathway and suggest that Msh2-Msh6 localizes PCNA to repair sites after mispair recognition to activate the Mlh1-Pms1 endonuclease for initiating Exo1-dependent repair or for driving progressive excision in Exo1-independent repair.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear transfer to oocytes is an efficient way to transcriptionally reprogram somatic nuclei, but its mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we identify a sequence of molecular events that leads to rapid transcriptional reprogramming of somatic nuclei after transplantation to Xenopus oocytes. RNA-seq analyses reveal that reprogramming by oocytes results in a selective switch in transcription toward an oocyte rather than pluripotent type, without requiring new protein synthesis. Time-course analyses at the single-nucleus level show that transcriptional reprogramming is induced in most transplanted nuclei in a highly hierarchical manner. We demonstrate that an extensive exchange of somatic- for oocyte-specific factors mediates reprogramming and leads to robust oocyte RNA polymerase II binding and phosphorylation on transplanted chromatin. Moreover, genome-wide binding of oocyte-specific linker histone B4 supports its role in transcriptional reprogramming. Thus, our study reveals the rapid, abundant, and stepwise loading of oocyte-specific factors onto somatic chromatin as important determinants for successful reprogramming.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity can result in insulin resistance, hepatosteatosis, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and increases liver cancer risk. Obesity-induced insulin resistance depends, in part, on chronic activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which also occurs in human and mouse hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a frequently fatal liver cancer. Correspondingly, mTORC1 inhibitors have been considered as potential NASH and HCC treatments. Using a mouse model in which high-fat diet enhances HCC induction by the hepatic carcinogen DEN, we examined whether mTORC1 inhibition attenuates liver inflammation and tumorigenesis. Notably, rapamycin treatment or hepatocyte-specific ablation of the specific mTORC1 subunit Raptor resulted in elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) production, activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and enhanced HCC development, despite a transient reduction in hepatosteatosis. These results suggest that long-term rapamycin treatment, which also increases IL-6 production in humans, is unsuitable for prevention or treatment of obesity-promoted liver cancer.

Abstract: We aimed to determine the oxidative stress and antioxidant status in preeclamptic placenta. Also, we investigated the apoptotic index of villous trophoblast and proliferation index of cytotrophoblasts. The study included 32 pregnant with preeclampsia and 31 normotensive healthy pregnant women. Malondialdehyde (MDA) and total antioxidant status (TAS) levels were measured in the placenta. For detection of apoptosis and proliferation in trophoblast, apoptosis protease activating factor 1 (APAF-1) and Ki-67 were used. Placental MDA levels in preeclamptic women were significantly higher than normal pregnancies (p=0.002). There was no significant difference between the groups in the TAS levels of placenta (p=0.773). Also, the apoptotic index in villous trophoblasts increased (p<0.001), but proliferation index did not change in preeclampsia (p=0.850). Increased oxidative stress and apoptosis in pathological placenta are not balanced by antioxidant systems and proliferation mechanisms.
Keywords: Preeclampsia; Oxidative stress; APAF-1; Ki-67

Abstract: Summary
Cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors detect non-self RNAs during virus infections and initiate antiviral signaling. One receptor, MDA5, possesses essential signaling domains, but weak RNA binding. A second receptor, LGP2, rapidly detects diverse dsRNA species, but lacks signaling domains. Accumulating evidence suggests LGP2 and MDA5 work together to detect viral RNA and generate a complete antiviral response, but the basis for their cooperation has been elusive. Experiments presented here address this gap in antiviral signaling, revealing that LGP2 assists MDA5-RNA interactions leading to enhanced MDA5-mediated antiviral signaling. LGP2 increases the initial rate of MDA5-RNA interaction and regulates MDA5 filament assembly, resulting in the formation of more numerous, shorter MDA5 filaments that are shown to generate equivalent or greater signaling activity in vivo than the longer filaments containing only MDA5. These findings provide a mechanism for LGP2 coactivation of MDA5 and a biological context for MDA5-RNA filaments in antiviral responses.

Abstract: We isolated a rice (Oryza sativa L.) WRKY gene which is highly upregulated in senescent leaves, denoted OsWRKY42. Analysis of OsWRKY42-GFP expression and its effects on transcriptional activation in maize protoplasts suggested that the OsWRKY42 protein functions as a nuclear transcriptional repressor. OsWRKY42-overexpressing (OsWR KY42OX) transgenic rice plants exhibited an early leaf senescence phenotype with accumulation of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) hydrogen peroxide and a reduced chlorophyll content. Expression analysis of ROS producing and scavenging genes revealed that the metallothionein genes clustered on chromosome 12, especially OsMT1d, were strongly repressed in OsWRKY42OX plants. An OsMT1d promoter:LUC construct was found to be repressed by OsWRKY42 overexpression in rice protoplasts. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that OsWRKY42 binds to the W-box of the OsMT1d promoter. Our results thus suggest that OsWRKY42 represses OsMT1d-mediated ROS scavenging and thereby promotes leaf senescence in rice.

Abstract: The cell membrane provides critical cellular functions that rely on its elaborate structure and organization. The structure of turtle membranes is an important part of an ongoing study of erythrocyte membranes. Using a combination of atomic force microscopy and single-molecule force spectroscopy, we characterized the turtle erythrocyte membrane structure with molecular resolution in a quasi-native state. High-resolution images both leaflets of turtle erythrocyte membranes revealed a smooth outer membrane leaflet and a protein covered inner membrane leaflet. This asymmetry was verified by single-molecule force spectroscopy, which detects numerous exposed amino groups of membrane proteins in the inner membrane leaflet but much fewer in the outer leaflet. The asymmetric membrane structure of turtle erythrocytes is consistent with the semi-mosaic model of human, chicken and fish erythrocyte membrane structure, making the semi-mosaic model more widely applicable. From the perspective of biological evolution, this result may support the universality of the semi-mosaic model.

Abstract: Summary
We generated mice deficient in Lon protease (LONP1), a major enzyme of the mitochondrial quality control machinery. Homozygous deletion of Lonp1 causes early embryonic lethality, whereas its haploinsufficiency protects against colorectal and skin tumors. Furthermore, LONP1 knockdown inhibits cellular proliferation and tumor and metastasis formation, whereas its overexpression increases tumorigenesis. Clinical studies indicate that high levels of LONP1 are a poor prognosis marker in human colorectal cancer and melanoma. Additionally, functional analyses show that LONP1 plays a key role in metabolic reprogramming by remodeling OXPHOS complexes and protecting against senescence. Our findings demonstrate the relevance of LONP1 for cellular and organismal viability and identify this protease as a central regulator of mitochondrial activity in oncogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Chromosomes form 3D structures that are critical to the regulation of cellular and genetic processes. Here, we present a study of global chromatin interaction patterns in Arabidopsis thaliana. Our genome-wide approach confirmed interactions that were previously observed by other methods as well as uncovered long-range interactions such as those among small heterochromatic regions embedded in euchromatic arms. We also found that interactions are correlated with various epigenetic marks that are localized in active or silenced chromatin. Arabidopsis chromosomes do not contain large local interactive domains that resemble the topological domains described in animals but, instead, contain relatively small interactive regions scattered around the genome that contain H3K27me3 or H3K9me2. We generated interaction maps in mutants that are defective in specific epigenetic pathways and found altered interaction patterns that correlate with changes in the epigenome. These analyses provide further insights into molecular mechanisms of epigenetic regulation of the genome.

Abstract: Summary
Pruning of unnecessary axons and/or dendrites is crucial for maturation of the nervous system. However, little is known about cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) that control neuronal pruning. In Drosophila, dendritic arborization neurons, ddaCs, selectively prune their larval dendrites. Here, we report that Rab5/ESCRT-mediated endocytic pathways are critical for dendrite pruning. Loss of Rab5 or ESCRT function leads to robust accumulation of the L1-type CAM Neuroglian (Nrg) on enlarged endosomes in ddaC neurons. Nrg is localized on endosomes in wild-type ddaC neurons and downregulated prior to dendrite pruning. Overexpression of Nrg alone is sufficient to inhibit dendrite pruning, whereas removal of Nrg causes precocious dendrite pruning. Epistasis experiments indicate that Rab5 and ESCRT restrain the inhibitory role of Nrg during dendrite pruning. Thus, this study demonstrates the cell-surface molecule that controls dendrite pruning and defines an important mechanism whereby sensory neurons, via endolysosomal pathway, downregulate the cell-surface molecule to trigger dendrite pruning.
