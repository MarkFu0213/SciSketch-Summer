Abstract: ABSTRACT
Introduction
Soon after the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, viral screening by nasopharyngeal swab became mandatory for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) donor eligibility.
Methods
We described our monocenter experience with allogeneic HSC donors from February 1 to the October 31, 2020 to verify whether the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 screening altered the donor eligibility and/or entailed a prolongation of the evaluation process.
Results
A total of 21 allogeneic HSC donors were screened during the above-mentioned period upon request by the local transplant physicians or by the Italian Bone Marrow Donor Registry; among the HSC donors (n = 17) who completed the eligibility process and further received the nasopharyngeal swab, all but one were negative for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. The positive donor remained asymptomatic for the whole duration of the infection, which lasted six weeks. However, he was temporarily excluded from donation. The median duration of the evaluation process was not significantly different, compared to the same period of 2019 (p-value = 0.11).
Conclusion
The mandatory SARS-CoV-2 screening in allogeneic HSC donors allowed for the detection of 6% positivity in this monocenter series over a 9-month period. Despite the inconvenience of this unexpected non-eligibility, the exclusion of a SARS-CoV-2 positive donor represented an important safety measure for the donor, with respect to a new and still partially unknown virus. The screening did not alter the length of the donor evaluation and thus, did not cause a delay in the eligibility process.

Abstract: Kidney organoid technology has led to a renaissance in kidney developmental biology. The complex underpinnings of mammalian kidney development have provided a framework for the generation of kidney cells and tissues from human pluripotent stem cells. Termed kidney organoids, these 3-dimensional structures contain kidney-specific cell types distributed similarly to in vivo architecture. The adult human kidney forms from the reciprocal induction of two disparate tissues, the metanephric mesenchyme (MM) and ureteric bud (UB), to form nephrons and collecting ducts, respectively. Although nephrons and collecting ducts are derived from the intermediate mesoderm (IM), their development deviates in time and space to impart distinctive inductive signaling for which separate differentiation protocols are required. Here we summarize the directed differentiation protocols which generate nephron kidney organoids and collecting duct kidney organoids, making note of similarities as much as differences. We discuss limitations of these present approaches and discuss future directions to improve kidney organoid technology, including a greater understanding of anterior IM and its derivatives to enable an improved differentiation protocol to collecting duct organoids for which historic and future developmental biology studies will be instrumental.

Abstract: Background
To develop and validate a predictive model to determinate patients at increased risk to suffer from recurrence following a first provoked deep vein thrombosis (VTE). Methods: Predictive variables, i.e. male sex [1 point], inherited thrombophilia (IT) status (none [0 points], single [1 point], combined variants [2 points]), blood group non-0, and age at first VTE onset were included into a risk assessment model, which was derived in 511 patients and then validated in 509 independent subjects.
Results
VTE recurrence risk score (maximum 4 points, range 0–3) was below two for patients scored as low-risk (LRS) and ≥2 for patients at high-risk (HRS). Within a median time of 3 years after withdrawal of anticoagulation (AC) recurrence rate in LRG (derivation) was 11.8% versus 26.0% in HRS (p < 0.001). In the validation cohort within 2.2 years the recurrence rate was 9.8% in LRS versus 30.1% in HRS (p < 0.001). In multivariable analysis adjusted for age at first VTE and blood group the recurrent risk in HRS was significantly increased compared with the LRS (derivation: hazard/95% confidence interval: 3.7/1.75–7.91; validation: 4.7/2.24–9.81; combined 5.2/1.92–13.9). Model specificity (sensitivity) was 79.0% (52.0%) in the derivation cohort compared with 78.0% (43.0%) in the validation group. In conclusion, in the prediction model presented here the risk of VTE recurrence was associated with male gender and combined ITs. Based on the negative predictive value calculated the model may identify patients with a first provoked VTE not being at risk for recurrence.

Abstract: Summary
Low-cost wood materials exhibit excellent physical properties owing to their smart porous structure design. These materials have advantages over nonrenewable or hard-to-degrade plastics, polymers, and metals in some specific fields. Here, we report ultra-flexible wood composites prepared through coupling delignification and in situ polymerization. The polyacrylamide (PAM)-lignocellulosic and PAM-water bonds are broken and re-formed during the folding process. The PAM chains of the hydrogel unfold and slide, resulting in full dispersion of the stress in the wood composites. Hydrated calcium ions (Ca2+(H2O)1–6), derived from polyacrylamide-based hydrogel, can further allow the wood composites to lock in the liquid water. Therefore, the wood composites exhibit good flexibility at −40°C and 50°C. Their ultra-flexibility can withstand evaluation in extreme environments, such as 1,000 folds with a 180° bending angle or vacuum dehydration for 24 h. Good flexibility provides great application potential for the wood composite materials.

Abstract: Macrophages are immune cells that play different roles under different physiological conditions. They are present in all tissues where they primarily protect from bacteria and pathogens in addition to assisting in tissue repair. During tumor progression, macrophages can exert contrasting effects based on the M1 vs. M2 polarization. The M2 macrophages support tumor growth through mechanisms that help suppress immune responses and/or circumvent immune-surveillance. A number of such mechanisms such as production of IL-10 and arginase, and expression of PD-L1, V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell activation and B7 family molecule B7-H4 are now believed central to the immunosuppressive effects of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Emerging data has identified epigenetic regulation of these immunosuppressive mechanisms by small non-coding RNAs, the microRNAs (miRNAs). This review discusses the available literature on the subject, including the exosomes mediated transfer of miRNAs between cancer cells and the macrophages within the tumor microenvironment. A number of miRNAs are now believed to be involved in TAMs’ production of IL-10 and expression of PD-L1 while the information on such regulation of other immunosuppressive mechanisms is slowly emerging. A better understanding of epigenetic regulation of macrophages-mediated immunosuppressive effect can help identify novel targets for therapy and aid the design of future studies aimed at sensitizing tumors to immune responses.

Abstract: Summary
Endogenous nitric oxide is important for living beings; hence, accurate and non-invasive detection of nitric oxide (NO) in situ is of significance. Benzothiadiazole-core chromophores are important near-infrared II (NIR-II) dyes, but such limitations as fluorescence quenching in aqueous media and non-activatable response constitute major barriers for biological applications. To address these issues, here we report an activatable nanoprobe, BNDA@HβCD, with aggregation-induced emission for detecting the biomarker NO. The molecular probe BNDA and 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HβCD) form the amphiphilic host-guest complex BNDA-HβCD, which readily forms nanoaggregates in aqueous media and thereby affords the nanoprobe BNDA@HβCD. NO reacts with the probe and generates the activated probe, which displays strong NIR-II fluorescence emission and optoacoustic signals. BNDA@HβCD can detect liver injury and monitor therapeutic outcome in a mouse model by detecting hepatic NO; it can also image NO in soybean sprouts. The results indicate that BNDA@HβCD is a robust tool for detecting NO in both animals and plants.

Abstract: Introduction
The safety of a blood transfusion practice is anchored on safe blood from a healthy donor, while further protecting the donor from future harm. This study aimed to evaluate the hematological parameters of blood donors in view of their donor category to aid in assessing the safety threshold in terms of donation frequency.
Methods
This study made use of the descriptive cross-sectional design. The blood donors were bled and their samples analyzed using a hematology autoanalyzer.
Results
A total of 178 male blood donors were recruited. Most of the donors were aged 18 to 39 years and were mostly students. A greater part of them were repeat donors who had donated blood more than four times. First- and second-time donors constituted the majority of the voluntary donors. While the total red cell count was significantly lower in repeat third-time donors, the hemoglobin and hematocrit of the first-time donors were significantly higher than those of the repeat fourth-time donors. The mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) of the first-time donors were significantly higher than those of the repeat fifth-time donors. The red cell distribution width (RDW) and mean platelet volume (MPV) were significantly lower in the first-time donors from those of the sixth- and seventh-time donors, respectively. Most of the fifth-time donors have subclinical anemia. There was more subclinical anemia in commercial donors than in voluntary donors.
Conclusion
Repeat donors more than fifth-time donors are at risk of donation-induced iron deficiency anemia.

Abstract: Cancer progression and metastasis are processes that involve significant cellular changes. Many of these changes include alterations in the activity of the Rho GTPase family of proteins. Rho GTPases are signaling proteins that function as molecular switches and are involved in the regulation of most major cellular processes. Cancer development is often associated with abnormalities in Rho GTPase signaling. Rho GTPase signaling is regulated by two families of proteins, guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (RhoGEFs) and GTPase activating proteins (RhoGAPs), that function upstream of the Rho proteins to regulate their activation and inactivation, respectively. While initial work has focused on the role of RhoGEFs in cancer, the RhoGAP family members are rapidly being established as key regulators of cancer development and progression. The aim of this review is to summarize our advances in understanding the role of RhoGAPs in cancer and to discuss their significance in the development of therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
Preventing spontaneous crystallization of supersaturated solutions by additives is of critical interest to successful process design and implementation, with numerous applications in chemical, pharmaceutical, medical, pigment, and food industries, but challenges remain in laboratory and industry settings and fundamental understanding is lacking. When copresented with antifreeze proteins (AFPs), otherwise spontaneously crystallizing osmolytes are maintained at high supersaturations for months in over-wintering organisms. Thus, we here explore the inhibition phenomenon by AFPs, using persistent crystallization of a common sugar alcohol, D-mannitol, as a case study. We report experimentally that DAFP1, an insect AFP, completely inhibits D-mannitol nucleation. Computer simulations reveal a new mechanism for crystallization inhibition where the population of the crystal-forming conformers are selectively bound and randomized in solution by hydrogen bonding to the protein surface. These results highlight the advantages of using natural polymers to address crystallization inhibition challenges and suggest new strategies in controlling the nucleation processes.

Abstract: Basic neuroscience research employs numerous forms of antibodies as key reagents in diverse applications. While the predominant use of antibodies is as immunolabeling reagents, neuroscientists are making increased use of intracellular antibodies or intrabodies. Intrabodies are recombinant antibodies genetically encoded for expression within neurons. These can be used to target various cargo (fluorescent proteins, reporters, enzymes, etc.) to specific molecules and subcellular domains to report on and manipulate neuronal function with high precision. Intrabodies have the advantages inherent in all genetically encoded recombinant antibodies but represent a distinct subclass in that their structure allows for their expression and function within cells. The high precision afforded by the ability to direct their expression to specific cell types, and the selective binding of intrabodies to targets within these allows intrabodies to offer unique advantages for neuroscience research, given the tremendous molecular, cellular and morphological complexity of brain neurons. Intrabodies expressed within neurons have been used for a variety of purposes in basic neuroscience research. Here I provide a general background to intrabodies and their development, and examples of their emerging utility as valuable basic neuroscience research tools.

Abstract: Summary
Pyrene is known for the quenched emission of excimers, especially in aqueous solution. Here, we report strong emission of pyrene excimers realized in amphiphile assemblies by controlling the face-to-face distance between the pyrene planes. We find that both the self-assembly behavior and emission properties of a cationic pyrene-containing amphiphile (denoted by PRB) are altered by exchanging the counterions. Upon the addition of sodium mesitylenesulfonate (Na MtS), the excimer emission of pyrene in self-assembled aggregates of PRB is greatly enhanced in aqueous solution. Concomitantly, the disk-like assemblies of PRB are converted to spherical particles, in which the repulsive interactions of the head groups are screened by replacing the counterions of the PRB molecules. The quantum yield of PRB increases from 0.5% to 16.6%, which is attributed to the dense packing of pyrene moieties in the aggregates. This study demonstrates that controlling supramolecular interactions is a feasible avenue to enhance the emission of pyrene excimers in amphiphile assemblies.

Abstract: Summary
Extensive efforts are currently underway to develop safe and cost-effective electrolytes for large-scale energy storage. In this regard, water-based electrolytes may be an attractive option, but their narrow electrochemical stability window hinders their realization. Although highly concentrated fluorinated electrolytes have been shown to be highly effective in suppression of water splitting, enabling significant widening of the applied potential range, they utilize expensive salts (e.g., lithium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl) imide [LiTFSI] or lithium trifluoromethane sulfonate [LiOTf]); hence, they cannot be considered for practical applications. Here, we demonstrate a cost-effective aqueous electrolyte solution combining 14 M LiCl and 4 M CsCl that allows stable operation of a 2.15-V battery comprising a TiO2 anode and LiMn2O4 cathode. Addition of CsCl to the electrolyte plays a double role in system stabilization: the added chloride anions interact with the free water molecules, whereas the chaotropic cesium cations adsorb at the electrified interface, preventing hydrogen formation.

Abstract: Summary
Wavelength tunable detectors are essential for capturing spectral information within diverse applications such as those related to object recognition and identification. Here, we present a generalizable design for a compact dual-band photodetector based on the integration of two back-to-back organic photodiodes that respond to visible (400–700 nm) and infrared light (700–1,400 nm). The polarity under external bias provides the electronic switch between visible and infrared detection modes. Operating at a low voltage of <1 V, the organic photodetector exhibits a fast response with a −3-dB cutoff frequency of 18 kHz and specific detectivity of 7.8 × 109 Jones. The device provides contactless measurements of high temperatures that originated from blackbody radiation and spectroscopic dual-band imaging for object identification.

Abstract: Summary
Electrocatalysis is a decisive factor determining the practicability of green energy technologies. Electric double layers (EDLs) provide suitable chemical environments for electrocatalysis, having direct impact on their activity. However, little is known about EDL structures and dielectric properties. Aiming to address these issues, here we perform ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of electrified Ag(111)/water interfaces, and our calculations are able to reproduce the subtle difference in experimental capacitance curves due to ion effects. It is interesting to find that, on weak binding, Ag(111) water chemisorption can be strengthened when positively charged, contributing to the hump in differential capacitance owing to electronic effects. Bulky ClO4−, compared with small F−, increases the EDL width and decreases the water content at interfaces. Furthermore, steric repulsion between ClO4− forces the formation of a second layer of the ions at very positive potentials. These detailed factors dictate the EDL capacitances that depend on the nature of counter ions.

Abstract: Summary
Although piezoelectric energy harvesting is well established, ferroelectric/ferroelastic switching has not been widely used for energy harvesting. The main disadvantage of piezoelectric energy harvesters is their limited power density. In this respect, ferroelectric/ferroelastic switching is attractive because of the greater energies and charge flows involved. However, the associated nonlinearities and the difficulty of establishing a stable working cycle have prevented significant progress. In this work, a robust ferroelectric energy harvester based on partial ferroelectric switching is explored. The device is of simple construction and achieves a per-cycle energy density of about 1 mJ cm−3, orders of magnitude greater than that of typical piezoelectrics. It is shown that only periodic compressive stress is needed to induce the energy harvesting cycles, yielding promising mechanical attributes that limit fatigue or fracture during cyclic loading. The results show this prototype device operating stably over 0.5 × 106 cycles at 20-Hz frequency, demonstrating promise for practical applications.

Abstract: Keratins are one of the major components of cytoskeletal network and assemble into fibrous structures named intermediate filaments (IFs), which are important for maintaining the mechanical properties of cells and tissues. Over the past decades, evidence has shown that the functions of keratins go beyond providing mechanical support for cells, they interact with multiple cellular components and are widely involved in the pathways of cell proliferation, differentiation, motility and death. However, the structural details of keratins and IFs are largely missing and many questions remain regarding the mechanisms of keratin assembly and recognition. Here we briefly review the current structural models and assembly of keratins as well as the interactions of keratins with the binding partners, which may provide a structural view for understanding the mechanisms of keratins in the biological activities and the related diseases.

Abstract: Summary
With increasingly competitive pricing and net-zero targets driving the growing demand for solar photovoltaics, new manufacturing supply-chain models are under consideration to increase local resilience and to ensure continuity of supply. We report a cost model that assesses the opportunity for local module assembly in a competitive global market context and extends techno-economic analysis to include important supply-chain aspects of trade and logistics costs. The initial analysis focuses on the economic viability of photovoltaic (PV) module assembly at different scales in Australia and then generalizes to include the global supply chain. The analysis shows that, with economies of scale and sufficient demand, local module assembly from imported materials can compete with the price of imported modules. Key cost drivers and their impact on profitability are discussed in the light of broader benefits and potential policy mechanisms that influence decision-making that can support investments in domestic solar module manufacturing.

Abstract: Summary
Two-dimensional polymers (2DPs) that incorporate molecular hosts offer a distinctive combination of properties, including covalent connectivity, structural regularity, chemical stability, permanent porosity, and molecular recognition. These features make these topologically planar macromolecular sheets promising in relation to applications, including those that appear in sensors, organic electronics, and nanofiltration membranes. Here, we use copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne click chemistry to construct a cyclophane-based 2DP at a liquid-liquid interface by polymerizing a bisazide-functionalized tetracationic cyclophane monomer with a 1,3,5-triethynylbenzene node. The 2DP prepared by employing this strategy is observed to be crystalline porous sheets by a combination of synchrotron X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, electron diffraction, and nitrogen porosimetry. When employed as the active layer in nanofiltration membranes, this 2DP exhibits excellent rejection performance of a dye, Brilliant Blue G, with 99% of the dye being removed after each cycle. Our findings could lead to the broad application of interfacial click polymerizations to produce 2DPs.

Abstract: Summary
The embedding of metal nanoparticles in MOFs is highly relevant in catalysis research. The MOF matrix prevents the NMP agglomeration. Furthermore, the MOF can easily be functionalized to design an optimal chemical environment for the benefit of a catalytic reaction. We report on a series of metal@MOF materials, namely Pd@CuBTC and Pd@CuBTC-Cnip, consisting of the structural prototype CuBTC (= [Cu3BTC2]; BTC = benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate). Pd NPs were incorporated by rapid “bottle-around-the-ship” encapsulation. Regulation of the microenvironment around the Pd NPs by using alkoxy-functionalized fragmented linkers H2Cnip (n = 3, 6, 10) allows to adjust the hydrophobicity. These modifications significantly improve the catalytic activity for alkene hydrogenation compared with Pd@CuBTC. Our work suggests that the “channel engineering,” i.e., the introduction of hydrophobic alkyl chains to the MOF linkers, increases the interactions with non-polar substrates, leading to a facilitated substrate diffusion in the host, which is an efficient way to optimize the metal@MOF catalysts.

Abstract: Introduction
People living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLWH) still face high morbidity and mortality resulting from lymphoma.
Aim
To describe a population of PLWH and lymphoma in a Chilean public hospital and compare the overall survival (OS) with a previously reported cohort from the same institution.
Methods
Retrospective single-center cohort study. All the patients diagnosed between 2010 and 2017 were included. Demographic and clinical variables were obtained from medical records. The overall survival (OS) was estimated in treated patients from diagnosis until death or October 2020. The OS was then compared with a cohort of patients diagnosed between 1992 and 2008.
Main Results
Eighty-four patients were included. The most common histological types were Burkitt´s lymphoma (BL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Hodgkin´s lymphoma (HL) and plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL) at 31%, 27%, 21% and 14%, respectively. The three-year OS for the whole cohort of BL, DLBCL, HL and PBL was 58.9%, 65.2%, 47.4%, 76.4% and 50%, respectively. Compared to the cohort of 1992 to 2008, a global increase in the OS was found after excluding HL and adjusting for age and clinical stage (HR 0.38, p = 0.002). However, when the main types were analyzed individually, the increase in the OS was statistically significant only in DLBCL (HR 0.29, p = 0.007). Most patients with DLBCL received CHOP chemotherapy, as in the previous cohort.
Conclusion
The OS has improved in this population, despite no major changes in chemotherapy regimens, mainly due to the universal access to antiretroviral therapy.

Abstract: Summary
The CO2 reduction reaction (CRR), which is key to addressing global environmental and energy issues, must overcome the strong C = O bond and is hindered by low CRR selectivity and activity. Here, we unravel the ensemble effect of catalytically active sites for promotion of CRR while suppressing hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs). We design a 2D/2D hybrid consisting of an ordered assembly of nickel-rich Ni-Mn layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets (NSs) and oxygen vacancies (OVs)-rich Mn3O4 (OVs-Mn3O4) NSs. On its own, Ni-Mn LDH demonstrates high CRR selectivity but mediocre CRR efficiency, whereas OVs-Mn3O4 gives a higher efficiency but poorer selectivity. The 2D/2D hybrid inherits advantages from both components, attaining high CRR selectivity and markedly higher efficiency than Ni-Mn LDH and OVs-Mn3O4. Calculations and in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) measurements reveal that nickel sites in the 2D/2D hybrid activate CO2 to generate CO2•– via a one-electron injection, whereas OVs in OVs-Mn3O4 promote light harvesting and charge transport without activating unwanted HERs.

Abstract: Summary
The atomistic design of positive electrode materials requires understanding of (1) how guest cations diffuse through an intercalation host to fill empty interstices and (2) the distortions of the host lattice induced as a result of ion intercalation. Here, we report the use of topochemistry to access single-crystals of a metastable 2D van der Waals solid, γʹ-V2O5, and examine its single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformations upon lithiation up to γ-LiV2O5. High-resolution single-crystal diffraction provides an atomistic view of preferred interstitial sites occupied by Li ions and distortions of the 2D lattice in an extended solid-solution lithiation regime, which stands in stark contrast to the thermodynamic α-V2O5 phase. These results illustrate the potential of metastable compounds with reconfigured atomic connectivity to unlock lithiation pathways and mechanisms that are profoundly different from their thermodynamic counterparts. The study furthermore demonstrates the viability of combining topochemical modification with single-crystal diffraction to image intercalation phenomena with atomic resolution.

Abstract: Introduction
Convalescent Plasma therapy is one of the therapeutic strategies that has been used for patients with the Covid-19 disease. Implementing a program with national extension to supply hospitals with this blood component is a great challenge mainly in a middle-income economy.
Objectives
Our objective was to develop and implement a Covid-19 Convalescent Plasma Program which met established quality standards and was adapted to a reality of limited resources.
Methods
A multicentric convalescent plasma collection program was developed and implemented, based on four main sequential procedures: selective donor recruitment, pre-donation antibody screening (Anti-SARS-CoV-2- Chemiluminescence IgG Abbott), convalescent plasma collection by apheresis or whole-blood processing and distribution to the hospitals according to local demand.
Results
From the 572 candidates submitted to the pre-donation antibody screening, only 270 (47%) were considered eligible for plasma donation according to the established criteria. Higher levels of total antibody were associated with the donor age being above 45 years old (p = 0.002), hospital admission (p = 0.018), and a shorter interval between the diagnosis of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and plasma donation (p < 0.001). There was no association between the ABO and Rh blood groups and their antibody levels. Of the 468 donations made, 61% were from the collection of whole-blood and 39%, from apheresis. The Covid-19 Convalescent Plasma units obtained were distributed to 21 different cities throughout the country by air or ground transportation.
Conclusion
The implementation of a Covid-19 Convalescent Plasma program in a continental country with relatively scarce resources is feasible with alternative strategies to promote lower cost procedures, while complying with local regulations and meeting quality standards.

Abstract: Summary
Electrochemical seawater desalination has drawn significant attention as an energy-efficient technique to address the global issue of water remediation. Microporous carbons, that is, carbons with pore sizes smaller than 2 nm, are commonly used for capacitive deionization. However, micropores are ineffective for capacitive deionization at high molar strength because of their inability to permselectively uptake ions. In our work, we combine experimental work with molecular dynamics simulation and reveal the ability of sub-nanometer pores (ultramicropores) to effectively desalinate aqueous media at seawater-like molar strength. This is done without any ion-exchange membrane. The desalination capacity in 600 mM reaches 12 mg/g, with a charge efficiency of 94% and high cycling stability over 200 cycles (97% of charge efficiency retention). Using molecular dynamic simulations and providing experimental data, our work makes it possible both to understand and to calculate desalination capacity and charge efficiency at high molar strength as a function of pore size.

Abstract: Summary
Long-term plasma membrane (PM) tracking is important for studying the membrane function and diagnosis of membrane-related diseases. However, current PM probes can easily diffuse into the cytoplasm, which is undesirable. Here, we report an amphipathic aggregation-induced emission (AIE)-active far-red fluorescent probe, named DENPB, for long-term PM imaging. In live cancer cells, DENPB can be turned on after insertion into the PM and shows long-term membrane retention. It can be used for PM tracking for 6 h without obvious internalization. Interestingly, data show that it selectively stained the PM of live cancer cells (e.g., HeLa, HepG2, MDA-MB-231, MCF-7) but showed no signal in live non-cancer cells (e.g., RAW 264.7, NIH 3T3, HFF). It can also distinguish paraformaldehyde-fixed cancer cells from non-cancer cells by showing different signal patterns. This work provides a rational design strategy for a long-term PM-retention probe and a useful tool for cancer cell-specific staining that may greatly contribute to cancer diagnosis.

Abstract: The adult liver exerts crucial functions, including nutrient metabolism and storage, bile production and drug detoxification. These complex functions expose the liver to constant damage induced by toxins, metabolic intermediates and oxidative stress. However, the adult liver exhibits an exceptional regenerative potential, which allows fast and efficient restoration of tissue architecture and function both after tissue resection and toxic damage. To accomplish its vital role, the liver shows a peculiar tissue architecture into functional units, which follow the gradient of oxygen and nutrients within the parenchyma. Much less is known about the influence of tissue spatial geometry and functional organisation on adult liver regeneration. Here I examine the experimental evidence in mouse models showing that the spatial organisation of the epithelial and mesenchymal compartments plays a key role in liver regeneration and favours the establishment of regenerative adult liver progenitors following liver injury. I also discuss the advantages and limitations of human and mouse 3D hepatic organoid systems, which recapitulate key aspects of liver function and architecture, as models of liver regeneration and disease. Finally, I analyse the role of the YAP/TAZ transcriptional co-activators as a central hub sensing the extra-cellular matrix (ECM), metabolic and epigenetic remodelling that regulate liver regeneration and promote liver disease, such as fibrosis, chronic liver disease and liver cancer. Together, the findings summarised here demonstrate that local physical and functional cellular interactions determined by the liver peculiar spatial geometry, play a crucial role in liver regeneration, and that their alterations have important implications for human liver disease.

Abstract: Breast cancer (BC) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have pronounced female-to-male disparities and both are the major causes of death in elderly women. Intriguingly, there is an inverse incidence between BC and AD. In our previous study, we found that the expression of ARSD, a female-biased gene on chromosome Xp22.3 that encodes arylsulfatase D, is significantly downregulated in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells and tissue samples, and that ectopic ARSD overexpression could inhibit proliferation and migration of BC cells. However, the exact mechanism remains unclear. In this study, ARSD-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cell strains were established. RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR validation were performed followed by GO and KEGG analyses. Transcriptome sequencing unveiled that Alzheimer’s/Parkinson’s/prion diseases were enriched in ARSD overexpressing BC cells. Besides, the top enriched pathways included lipoprotein/cholesterol metabolism, molecular chaperone and misfolding protein binding, mitochondrial respiration, dysfunction of lysosomes, etc. In which, a battery of genes, e.g., SERF1A, APOE, CD36 etc., were upregulated, while a series of genes, e.g., NDUFA11, NDUFS3, NDUFV1, etc. were downregulated, which were closely related to amyloidosis. The amyloidosis of BC cells and nerval cells caused by ARSD overexpression was verified with western blotting, immunohistochemical and Congo red staining. Collectively, downregulated ARSD may be closely associated with BC, and upregulated ARSD may cause amyloidosis of BC cells. Our findings suggest that ARSD deserves to be considered a new promising target for treating TNBC or for AD.

Abstract: Summary
Numerous proteins can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in various biological processes. However, it remains a challenge to systematically evaluate the LLPS ability of proteins. Here, we develop a high-throughput protein phase separation (HiPPS) profiling method to delineate LLPS ability of proteins, which we term as the LLPS space of proteins. We next apply HiPPS to explore LLPS space of more than 30 different proteins including RNA-binding proteins, chaperones, amyloid proteins, and enzymes. Our results demonstrate that (1) LLPS is a common property of both unstructured and well-folded proteins; (2) LLPS space of protein can be dynamically reshaped by protein-protein interaction, post-translational modification, and genetic mutation; and (3) multi-component co-LLPS mixture decreases the threshold concentration of individual proteins for LLPS. We anticipate that the HiPPS method may effectively characterize LLPS of individual proteins or protein mixtures in vitro, which is valuable for understanding its role in biological processes.

Abstract: Adaptive behavior is supported by context-dependent cognitive control that enables stable and flexible sensorimotor transformations. Impairments in this type of control are often attributed to dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). However, the underlying circuit principles of PFC function that support cognitive control have remained elusive. While the complex, diverse responses of PFC neurons to cognitive variables have been studied both from the perspective of individual cell activity and overall population dynamics, these two levels have often been investigated separately. This review discusses two specific cell groups, context/brain state responsive interneuron subtypes and output decoder neurons, that might bridge conceptual frameworks derived from these two research approaches. I highlight the unique properties and functions of these cell groups and discuss how future studies leveraging their features are likely to provide a new understanding of PFC dynamics combining single-neuron and network perspectives.

Abstract: Summary
Accurate and rapid detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is significant for early tracing, isolation, and treatment of infected individuals, which will efficiently prevent large-scale transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here, two kinds of test strips for receptor binding domain (RBD) and N antigens of SARS-CoV-2 are established with high sensitivity and specificity, in which AIE luminogens (AIEgens) are utilized as reporters. Because of the high brightness and resistance to quenching in aqueous solution, the limit of detection can be as low as 6.9 ng/mL for RBD protein and 7.2 ng/mL for N protein. As an antigen collector, an N95 mask equipped with a test strip with an excellent enrichment effect would efficiently simplify the sampling procedures. Compared with a test strip based on Au nanoparticles or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), the AIEgen-based test strip shows high anti-interference capacity in complex biosamples. Therefore, an AIEgen-based test strip assay could be built as a promising platform for emergency use during the pandemic.

Abstract: Summary
Alloy-type anodes can enable high specific capacity for Li-ion batteries, but the large volume change during cycling often causes fast-capacity fading. Here, we report a thermodynamically driven grain boundary engineering method to improve alloy-type anodes via the spontaneous formation of 2D interfacial phases (complexions). Notably, the 2.8 at% Bi-doped SnSb achieves improved cycling stability and rate capability, even though it is 99% dense and has a mean crystallite size 2.7× larger than the undoped SnSb reference sample. Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy reveals Bi segregation at grain boundaries. Thermodynamic modeling further suggests the stabilization of a nanoscale liquid-like interfacial phase. Synchrotron transmission X-ray microscopy shows the suppressed intergranular cracking upon cycling with Bi addition. It suggests that the liquid-like interfacial phase serves as a stress relief mechanism for the high volumetric expansion anode via improved grain boundary sliding and Coble creep, akin to room-temperature superplasticity observed in Sn-Bi.

Abstract: Summary
Modulation of excited-state energy-level structures through controlled molecular stacking arrangement provides an effective strategy for tuning fluorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) but remains a critical challenge. Herein, we report the regulation of fluorescence and TADF ASE in organic crystalline polymorphs by controlling the excited-state dynamics through aggregate effects. Experimental and theoretical studies show that green crystals emit green fluorescence ASE, while red crystals emit red TADF ASE because a higher degree of J-aggregation in red crystals significantly results in a substantial decrease of energy gaps between singlet and triplet to 0.24 eV for the realization of a reverse intersystem crossing process. Our results suggest that molecular packing presents a powerful approach to tailor radiative channels that is fundamentally important for tuning fluorescence and TADF ASE in pure organic crystals.

Abstract: Summary
Despite extensive efforts in approaching the theoretical limit of solid-liquid contact time, the vertical bouncing droplet eventually lands on the impact spot of horizontally placed surfaces, which makes the liquid removal inefficient and thus limits its practical applications. To address this challenge, we use superhydrophobic surfaces consisting of regularly patterned pillars with an inclined Janus structure and report a phenomenon that involves synergistic effects of both pancake rebound and directional transport in one bouncing cycle, contributing to the reduction of contact time and the lateral removal of impacting droplets simultaneously. We generalize this particular regime to a broad range of working environments with various thermal conditions and impact velocities, demonstrating the robustness of water repellency and the directionality of liquid motion. The unusual bouncing performance, generality, and practicability of our work may provide useful insights into various applications, including electricity generation, self-cleaning, defogging, and anti-icing.

Abstract: The drugs containing nitrates like isosorbide dinitrate, isosorbide mononitrate and glyceryl trinitrate, etc., trigger the oxidation of hemoglobin which is manifested in the pathological disorder named methemoglobinemia. It was considered interesting to investigate the preventive roles of vitamin C towards the toxic effects of nitrate containing drugs used for the treatment of angina. The aim is to find whether these drugs need to be administered with special care to diabetic patients who are more prone to develop methemoglobinemia. Vitamin C (500 mg/day) was administered orally to reduce the methemoglobin (metHb) level in both the diabetic and nondiabetic patients consuming nitrate containing drugs regularly, keeping diabetic and nondiabetic patients not on nitrate drugs as control. Concentration of metHb and hemoglobin A (HbA) was estimated spectrophotometrically assuming the molar extinction coefficient values of metHb as 3.78 mM‐−1 cm‐−1 at 630 nm and HbA as 125,000 M ‐−1 cm ‐−1 at 415 nm. MetHb level was found to be lower after the treatment with vitamin C for 30 consecutive days than that before the trial with statistically significant two tailed p value. Additionally, fasting insulin level was also found to decrease after 4 weeks of consumption of vitamin C with moderate lowering of fasting serum glucose level as well, indicating a higher insulin sensitivity for the treated patients.

Abstract: Summary
Ambient hydrogenation of CO2 into liquid fuels is a potential economical solution for reducing CO2 emissions. Here, we report a highly active dual single-Pd-atom catalyst for ambient hydrogenation of CO2 to formate using a step-by-step catalyst design strategy. The theoretically predicted catalyst is synthesized experimentally and verified to capture a significant amount of CO2 (5.05 mmol/g, 273 K), and it can efficiently convert CO2 to formate under ambient conditions with a turnover frequency (TOF) as high as 13.46 h–1. Two major factors contributing to this extraordinary catalytic activity include the pore enrichment effect of the microporous structures and the ternary synergetic effect among two neighboring Pd atoms and the rich nitrogen environment. Our work may aid the development of heterogeneous catalysts to produce other commonly used fuels from CO2 under ambient conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Non-conjugated fluorescent materials have attracted much research attention in recent years due to their great theoretical significance and practical value. But the working mechanism for this extraordinary photophysical phenomenon is still unclear and in debate. In this work, three non-conjugated polypeptides exhibit excitation-independent clusteroluminescence (CL) with an emission peak at 440 nm. Experimental and theoretical analyses show that the (n,π∗) transition of the amide unit plays a crucial role in the CL. Notably, the processes of polymerization and clusterization are proposed as effective ways to activate the (n,π∗) transition, which could increase the CL efficiency. This work not only gains further insights into the CL mechanism but also provides effective ways to design and manipulate non-conjugated fluorescent materials.

Abstract: Social behavior involves many processes including cognitive functions. Altered social behaviors associated with many psychiatric disorders might have alterations in the processes. Poor social environment affects development and maturation of cognitive functions that are important for social cognition, possibly introducing social stress as well as vulnerability to the stress into the developing brain. Adolescence and early adulthood have higher sensitivity to social stress, which may be linked to the onset of psychiatric disorders during this time period. Understanding social behavioral processes in detail will be crucial for elucidating mechanisms of emerging the social behavior phenotypes in psychiatric disorders and for devising therapeutic and preventive interventions to introduce the resilience for the onset of psychiatric disorders through modulation of social circuitries.

Abstract: Summary
Vapor generation rate in nano/microstructured-based interfacial vapor generation devices is limited by water supply. Here, we report an innovative design for enhancement in vapor generation using porous nanochannel wicks. Vapor generation rate of 1.18 kg m−2 h-1 is achieved in a dark environment (without heat input) and of 17.12 kg m−2 h-1 is achieved with a heat input of 5.08 W at low temperature of 62°C, significantly higher than a typical vapor generation rate reported for interfacial solar vapor generation systems. We also demonstrate our wick’s performance under solar heat flux of 1.25 sun and attain a vapor generation rate of 4.87 kg m−2 h-1 at surface temperature below 35°C. Thus, we present an unconventional approach of separating surfaces of vapor generation and heat supply that would provide additional flexibility in the choice of energy source, such as solar energy and waste heat from exhaust gases. This approach can be consequential in low-grade waste heat recovery.

Abstract: Summary
Catalytic cleavage and functionalization of unstrained carbon–carbon bonds represent a formidable challenge for synthetic chemistry. Despite tremendous advances in transition-metal catalysis and photoredox radical chemistry, methods for the cleavage of sterically crowded inert Csp3–Csp3 bonds remain underdeveloped. Here we describe the direct, photoredox cleavage of hindered Csp3–Csp3 bonds of alcohols under neutral conditions. A relayed proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) strategy is employed that overcame the previous requirement of a Brønsted base. Heavily branched alcohols with a high oxidation potential (Eox½ > +2 V versus saturated calomel electrode) are cleaved and functionalized with remarkable efficiency and versatility. A simple, non-substituted phenyl group can promote a relayed PCET process to deliver primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl radicals under neutral conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Surface immobilization of metal complexes or clusters with an exact metal number and coordination structure on solid supports is essential in many industrial applications. However, methods for physically isolating individual homogeneous catalyst molecules on a support surface are rare. By selectively depositing TiO2 sieving layers around supported Co(salen) single molecules or gold clusters with hydrophobic ligands, we realize molecular surface isolation via selective atomic layer deposition. The obtained catalysts are reusable in chiral hydrolytic kinetic resolution and styrene oxidation. Surface isolation also prevents the leaching and aggregation of gold clusters after removing the ligands at high temperature. The activity and selectivity for styrene oxidation to benzaldehyde over isolated single gold atoms are optimized with an enhanced Au-TiO2 interface. This method provides a simple way to immobilize homogeneous catalysts on inexpensive supports and shows excellent potential for industrialization.

Abstract: Vacuoles, E1, X-linked, autoimmunity, somatic (VEXAS) syndrome is characterized by a pathogenic mutation in UBA1, which leads to protean complications including autoimmunity and myelodysplasia. A 56-year-old man with steroid-dependent, later steroid-refractory cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa and Sweet syndrome developed recurrent daily fever, macrocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, and anasarca. He was eventually diagnosed with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viremia and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). He improved clinically with rituximab, ruxolitinib, and increased glucocorticoids before expiring from Pseudomonas sepsis. UBA1 exon 3 mutational analysis in myeloid enriched peripheral blood revealed a c.122T>C (p.Met41Thr) pathogenic variant, consistent with VEXAS syndrome. We describe the first case of EBV-associated HLH in a patient diagnosed with VEXAS syndrome. Early identification of this syndrome will be important in order to offer potential therapies before life-threatening complications arise.

Abstract: Introduction
With the outbreak of COVID-19 and its containment measures, blood centers faced a huge challenge in balancing blood demand and supply and devising a preparedness plan to withstand the uncertain situation. This study assesses the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on blood transfusion services and discusses the appropriate mitigation strategies adopted.
Methods
We analyzed our center's blood transfusion services during the first half-period of the pandemic (Y3) and non-pandemic years 2018(Y1) and 2019(Y2) in two-quarters Q1 (pre-lockdown), from January to March and Q2 (post-lockdown), from April to June. The blood donation variables, the packed red blood cells (PRBCs) demand and the utilization pattern were compared between pandemic (Y3) and non-pandemic years (Y1 and Y2) in each quarter. The mitigation strategy adopted at every step of the transfusion service is highlighted.
Results
During post-lockdown (Q2) of the pandemic year (Y3), the blood donation was majorly by repeat donors (83%) from the in-house site (82.5%). Furthermore, the proportion of outdoor donation, deferral, blood collection, demand and issue demonstrated a significant drop of 50%, 32.6%, 33%, 31.8% and 32.3%, respectively, in comparison to Q2 of the non-pandemic years (Y1 and Y2), with a statistically significant difference for surgical and hemorrhagic indications (p < 0.05). Coping strategies, such as blood donor education and motivation using e-platforms emphasizing eligibility during the pandemic, staggering of donor in-flow, postponement of elective surgeries and donor and staff’ COVID-19 safety assurance, were followed.
Conclusion
The timely adoption of coping strategies played a crucial role in the better handling of shortcomings at our center's blood transfusion services caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Abstract: Multipotent stem cells persist within the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of adipose tissue during adulthood. These cells, commonly referred to as adipose-derived stromal cells (ASC), have been extensively investigated over the past years as a promising therapeutic tool based on their regenerative and immunomodulatory properties. However, how ASC might mirror the age-related alteration of the fat they reside in remains unclear. Herein, we show that inguinal adipose tissue in mice turns from brown/beige- to white-like with age and resident ASC readily mirror these changes both at mRNA and microRNA transcriptional level. Mechanistically, our data suggest that these brown/age-related changes in ASC transcription rely on changes in the activity of E2F1 and NFkB transcription factors.

Abstract: Antibodies mediate the majority of their effects in the extracellular domain, or in intracellular compartments isolated from the cytosol. Under a growing list of circumstances, however, antibodies are found to gain access to the cytoplasm. Cytosolic immune complexes are bound by the atypical antibody receptor TRIM21, which mediates the rapid degradation of the immune complexes at the proteasome. These discoveries have informed the development of TRIM-Away, a technique to selectively deplete proteins using delivery of antibodies into cells. A range of related approaches that elicit selective protein degradation using intracellular constructs linking antibody fragments to degradative effector functions have also been developed. These methods hold promise for inducing the degradation of proteins as both research tools and as a novel therapeutic approach. Protein aggregates are a pathophysiological feature of neurodegenerative diseases and are considered to have a causal role in pathology. Immunotherapy is emerging as a promising route towards their selective targeting, and a role of antibodies in the cytosol has been demonstrated in cell-based assays. This review will explore the mechanisms by which therapeutic antibodies engage and eliminate intracellularly aggregated proteins. We will discuss how future developments in intracellular antibody technology may enhance the therapeutic potential of such antibody-derived therapies.

Abstract: Summary
The ultra-large surface-to-mass ratio of two-dimensional (2D) materials has made them an ideal choice for electrodes of compact lithium (Li)-ion batteries and supercapacitors; however, only a small fraction of the massive 2D material space has been investigated for such applications. Here, combining explicit-ion and implicit-solvent formalisms, we develop an automated, first-principles-based, high-throughput computational framework to assess thousands of such materials. We define four descriptors to map “computationally soft” single-Li-ion adsorption to “computationally hard” multiple-Li-ion-adsorbed configuration located at global minima for insight finding and rapid screening. Leveraging this large dataset, we also develop crystal-graph-based machine learning models for the accelerated discovery of potential candidates. A reactivity test with commercial electrolytes is further performed for wet experiments. Our holistic approach, which predicts both Li-ion storage and supercapacitive properties and hence identifies various important electrode materials that are common to both devices, may pave the way for next-generation energy storage systems.

Abstract: Summary
Chemical passivation of defective perovskite surface is a fundamental strategy to stabilize solar cell operation by impeding the defect-dominant surface ion migration. Here, we show that the configuration of organic cations plays a key role in determining their surface adsorption energetics at various perovskite facets, which will strongly impact the spatial uniformity of the low-dimensional perovskite passivation layer (LDPL). A weak-anisotropic adsorption behavior is demonstrated for tertiary ammonium that can enable a conformal LDPL on the perovskite grain surface. Benefiting from comprehensive surface passivation, the migration of ionic perovskite species was suppressed and the as-fabricated p-i-n solar cells yielded an optimized power conversion efficiency of 22.6% with an expected T80 lifetime of about 4,000 h under continuous 1-sun illumination. Our findings give insight into the design and preparation of heterostructured perovskite films toward efficient and stable solar cells.

Abstract: Summary
Using quasi-solid electrolytes (QSEs) can make lithium metal batteries (LMBs) considerably safer. However, formulating QSEs with rate capabilities rivaling those of liquid electrolytes is extremely difficult. Herein, we develop a QSE characterized by safety, high conductivity above 2 × 10−3 S cm−1, and high lithium-ion transference number (tLi+) above 0.8. Computations and experiments reveal that these characteristics are achieved by adjusting the Li+ solvation through a weak interaction with the polymer skeleton and strong coordination with NO3−. The further inclusion of fluoroethylene carbonate leads to the formation of a Li3N- and LiF-rich solid electrolyte interphase on the lithium metal. Consequently, QSE-based LMBs are capable of fast charging and high-power density, as well as stable and long cycling. By adjusting Li+ solvation and lithium metal stability, this work rationally develops QSEs for fast-charging LMBs.

Abstract: Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may present with extrapulmonary manifestations, including hematologic changes. Previous studies suggest that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) can interact with the renin-angiotensin system, ultimately causing increased production of angiotensin II. By reporting the cases of previously healthy young adults diagnosed with a hematologic malignancy after experiencing COVID-19, we raise the hypothesis that the SARS-Cov-2 infection could act as a trigger for leukemogenesis in predisposed individuals.
Methods
This was a case series performed through extraction of relevant clinical information from the medical records of three patients admitted to our Hematology unit between August 2020 and September 2020.
Main Results
Considering the relatively rapid development of cytopenias following recovery from COVID-19, it cannot be ruled out that SARS-Cov-2 played a role in leukemogenesis in those patients. Based on previous in vitro studies, the renin-angiotensin system imbalance induced by SARS-CoV-2 could potentially promote in vivo leukemogenesis through several mechanisms.
Conclusion
Despite the advances in pathophysiological and clinical characterization of COVID-19, the consequences of the pandemic to the incidence of hematologic diseases are still to be elucidated. In this context, future dissection of the status of the local bone marrow renin-angiotensin system in leukemogenesis is a clinically relevant basic research area.

Abstract: Introduction
We have previously shown that some patients present thrombocytopenia (less than 100 × 109/L platelets) in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). To further explore the nature of this association, we have now analyzed the association of thrombocytopenia with neutropenia (less than 0.5 × 109/L granulocytes) in NAFLD.
Material and methods
Persons with NAFLD were prospectively accrued in the study after February 2018. The presence of NAFLD was defined by both serologic determinations (Fibromax ®) and liver transient elastography (TE/Fibroscan ®).
Results
In 123 consecutive patients with NAFLD without cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia was identified in 20 (16%), whereas neutropenia was identified in 9 (7%). In the subset of 20 patients with NAFLD and thrombocytopenia, granulocytopenia was identified in 5 (25%), whereas in the subset of 9 patients with granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia was identified in 5 (55%). We found a significant association between thrombocytopenia and both leukopenia and granulocytopenia (OR 8.25, 95% CI 1.9–34.2, p = 0.004).
Conclusions
Both thrombocytopenia and neutropenia were identified in persons with NAFLD and, as there is a significant relationship between these two variables, we speculate that this finding may support the possibility of hypersplenism being involved in the cytopenias found in NAFLD without cirrhosis.

Abstract: Summary
Aggregation-induced delayed fluorescence (AIDF) materials combining the advantages of aggregation-induced emission and thermally activated delayed fluorescence have attracted considerable attention. However, blue AIDF materials with satisfactory electroluminescence efficiencies are still few. In this work, two blue luminescent molecules (XT-DPDBA and XT-BDPDBA) with evident AIDF characteristics and high photoluminescence quantum yields are developed by using rigid electron acceptor xanthenone and weak electron donor 10-dihydrodibenzo[b,e][1,4]azasiline. Both molecules exhibit prominent mechanochromic luminescence (MCL) behaviors originating from conformational interconversion between quasi-axial and quasi-equatorial conformations. The quasi-equatorial conformation has small singlet–triplet energy splitting and thus delayed fluorescence characteristic. Efficient blue organic light-emitting diodes are fabricated based on both molecules, providing high external quantum efficiencies of up to 27% and small efficiency roll-offs. These blue AIDF molecules with MCL property have good application potentials in various optical and electronic devices.

Abstract: Summary
Flexible zinc (Zn)-air batteries are recognized as a next-generation battery candidate for emerging smart-wearable devices in portable use. Unfortunately, the high cost of flexible electrolytes and the complex synthesis process limit the commercial application of flexible Zn-air batteries. Here, we report a cost-effective starch gel fabricated through the starch gelation reaction for flexible Zn-air batteries. Benefiting from excellent hydrophilicity and adhesion, the prepared starch gel electrolyte exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 111.5 mS cm−1, leading to the close contact between the electrolyte and the electrodes. Moreover, a flexible Zn-air battery with the starch gel electrolyte delivers a long large cycling number of >200, a peak power density of 84 mW cm−2, extraordinary mechanical flexibility, and rugged reliability under complex conditions. Our work offers a strategy for the design and construction of high-performance solid-state electrolytes for flexible Zn-air batteries.

Abstract: Summary
Long-range communication is ubiquitous among living organisms, but it remains undiscovered among synthetic micro/nanomotors. Here, we report the long-range hydrodynamic communication among synthetic micromotors. With the high activities when powered by a mixed fuel of N2H4 and H2O2, catalytic micromotors move in a stable oblique head-down orientation and thus generate strong, steady converging phoretic flows near a substrate. Consequently, they can emit robust hydrodynamic signals to trigger neighboring motors within a long range and also initiate an “approach-hit-and-run” response when sensing the signals emitted from others. This hydrodynamic communication can be reciprocal or one-way, intraspecific or interspecific, spontaneous or controllable, and it widely exists in various catalytic micromotor systems. Utilizing the hydrodynamic signal, the micromotor can also act as a leader to gather small particles (followers) and exhibit a biomimetic competitive behavior against others for the followers. This work may facilitate the fabrication of intelligent micro/nanorobots for micromanipulations and biomimetic micro/nanorobotic systems.

Abstract: Assigning function to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to understand the mechanisms that link genetic and phenotypic variation and disease is an area of intensive research that is necessary to contribute to the continuing development of precision medicine. However, despite the apparent simplicity that is captured in the name SNP - ‘single nucleotide’ changes are not easy to functionally characterize. This complexity arises from multiple features of the genome including the fact that function is development and environment specific. As such, we are often fooled by our terminology and underlying assumptions that there is a single function for a SNP. Here we discuss some of what is known about SNPs, their functions and how we can go about characterizing them.

Abstract: The neural tube is an important model system of morphogenesis representing the developmental module of out-of-plane epithelial deformation. As the embryonic precursor of the central nervous system, the neural tube also holds keys to many defects and diseases. Recent advances begin to reveal how genetic, cellular and environmental mechanisms work in concert to ensure correct neural tube shape. A physical model is emerging where these factors converge at the regulation of the mechanical forces and properties within and around the tissue that drive tube formation towards completion. Here we review the dynamics and mechanics of neural tube morphogenesis and discuss the underlying cellular behaviours from the viewpoint of tissue mechanics.

Abstract: Summary
Exploring organic reactions to construct novel molecules with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) features is an essential branch of AIE research. The fast-paced application of AIE materials in various disciplines, including photoelectricity, molecular biology, medicine, and materials science, has led to an ever-growing need for new AIE molecules. Unlike the synthesis of most “earlier generations” of AIE fluorogens (AIEgens) that require tedious and harsh reactions, chemists now shift their synthetic focus to a selection of reliable and straightforward reactions. The Diels-Alder reaction has been overlooked in this field. Herein, we report a catalyst-free Diels-Alder reaction between 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran and a series of electron-deficient alkynes to create AIEgens. Photophysical properties of our synthesized 1,3,4-triphenyl-1,4-dihydro-1,4-epoxynaphthalene (ENAP) derivatives are studied systematically, manifesting their AIE characteristics and structure-fluorescence property relationships. Finally, we highlight the diverse applications of some selected ENAP derivatives in latent fingerprint detection, cell imaging, and bacterial staining.

Abstract: Summary
The electrochemical conversion of CO2 to generate syngas (H2 and CO) is regarded as a promising alternative technique to facilitate CO2 reduction in the ambient atmosphere. However, it is still a great challenge to acquire high catalytic activity with an adjustable H2/CO ratio over a wide range. Here, we construct an electrocatalyst with Fe-containing dual active sites on N-doped porous carbon (Fe/FeN4C) to promote a CO2 reduction reaction for tunable syngas production. The Fe/FeN4C catalysts have a positive onset potential (−0.18 VRHE), approximately 100% of the sum of the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of CO and H2, a high total current density (>39.33 mA cm−2), and a wide H2/CO ratio (1.09∼7.08). Density functional-theory calculations suggest that the Fe single atoms dispersed into the N-doped carbon structure, along with the incorporation of Fe nanoparticles, may decrease the adsorption energy of ∗CO, thus synergistically enhancing the catalytic activity.

Abstract: Summary
Halogen···halogen (X···X) short contacts, especially halogen bonds (XBs), have been widely used in multifarious fields because of their bridging function among luminophores, as well as their well-known heavy atom effect. Little attention, however, has been paid to the luminescent ability of halogen clusters. It remains unknown whether they could be emissive. Herein, to our knowledge, we report the first examples of emissive halogen clusters with fluorescence-phosphorescence dual emission in an aggregated state and even under ambient conditions, which should be attributed to the extended delocalization through effective intra- and intermolecular X···X contacts. Additionally, multi-tunable luminescence in response to excitation wavelength, temperature, and compression is noticed. These results unveil the potential of halogen clusters as novel chromophores and may inspire further exploration of nonconventional luminophores involving halogen moieties.

Abstract: Summary
Chiral information transfer is crucial to design new functions like, for instance, sensing through chiroptical probes in which the input is readout as a consequence of a chiral recognition event. Herein, we report lanthanide quadruple-stranded helicates [Ln2L4]2− that show a guest-to-host chirality transfer. As confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, these cages are present in solution as an equilibrating racemic mixture of left- and right-handed helicates. The helicates adapt their helical conformation by encapsulation of a chiral guest enabling also straightforward enantiomeric excess determination. Asymmetric induction is demonstrated by circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), and a helicity inversion mechanism based on a Bailar twist is proposed and studied by DFT calculations. The presented research contributes to the design of helicates with a unique combination of confined cavities, adaptive chirality, and peculiar luminescent properties, finding applications toward the development of optical probes for selective chiral sensing via molecular recognition.

Abstract: Summary
Forming light-transmitting structures on c-Si photovoltaics to transmit visible light without wavelength dependency is a promising strategy to realize neutral-color transparent c-Si photovoltaics (c-Si TPVs). However, dry etching, which is used to form a light-transmitting structure on c-Si, inevitably causes nanoscale surface damages such as scallops and plasma-induced damage in c-Si. This aggravates carrier recombination, which decreases power conversion efficiency (PCE) of c-Si TPVs. Here, we propose an effective chemical treatment method for removing nanoscale surface damage from c-Si microholes. A large neutral-color c-Si TPV after the chemical treatment exhibits a high PCE of 14.5% at a transmittance of 20%. The chemical treatment also enables systematic control of the hole size (167 nm/s), and, thus, the transmittance is easily tuned from 10% to 70%. The proposed chemical treatment satisfies the three development factors of (1) high PCE, (2) opportunity for scale up, and (3) facile light transmittance tuning of c-Si TPVs.

Abstract: Summary
Although complex metal oxides with tailored compositions are increasingly in demand for applications in advanced technologies, their preparation by solution-based routes, which are typically low cost and easy to scale up, is challenging. Here, we report high-entropy layered double hydroxides (HE-LDHs) having complex compositions as precursors for complex metal oxides. Furthermore, we reveal that the ionic radii are the key factors determining the incorporation of the metal cations into the hydroxide layers, which can contain up to 10 different kinds of metal cations simultaneously having a metal cation ratio inherited from the reaction solution. Furthermore, spinel-based complex oxides can be prepared by heat treating the HE-LDHs in air, and their metal cation ratios are maintained over expansive heat-treatment temperatures (up to 1,200°C). Therefore, the results reveal that complex oxides with tailored compositions can be prepared using solution-based approaches, enabling the large-scale fabrication of oxides with precisely controlled physicochemical properties for various applications.

Abstract: Summary
Although the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (N-V−) defect in nanodiamonds is desirable for a variety of biomedical applications, a range of other defect complexes involving nitrogen and/or vacancies can also exist, depending on their relative stability. Using machine learning, a re-usable model is developed to predict the likelihood of a particular defect complex being stable at a given depth below reconstructed or hydrogen-passivated surfaces. A neural network is used to generate a system of equations that can be easily implemented in any workflow, and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods are used to provide insights into which structural features and defect configurations are most responsible for the model prediction. It is found that, although the number of nitrogen atoms present in the defect is the most important feature determining the defect likelihood, the most influential data instances are the unlikely defects, providing a type of baseline for comparison.

Abstract: Summary
It is hard to find new electrochemiluminescence (ECL) luminophores using existing research strategies, especially from ECL non-active monomers. Here, fully conjugated covalent organic frameworks with trithiophene (BTT-COFs) are found to have ultra-high ECL efficiencies (up to 62.2%), even in water and without exogenous co-reactants. Quantum chemistry calculations confirm that the periodic BTT-COFs arrays promote intramolecular electron transfer generating ECL from non-ECL monomers. Modulation of ECL performance is possible by substituting the monomers for those with different electron-withdrawing properties. In addition, the cyano group weaved in the skeleton provides the dense sites for post-functionalization. As a typical use case, a highly selective ECL probe for uranyl ions is reported. The tunable ECL luminophore family possesses a broader development space than the traditional emitters, demonstrates the prospects of ECL-COFs, and affords an idea for detecting various contaminants through the rational design of target ligands.

Abstract: Interaction of a tumor with its microenvironment is an emerging field of investigation, and the crosstalk between cancer cells and the extracellular matrix is of particular interest, since cancer patients with abundant and stiff extracellular matrices display a poorer prognosis. At the post-juvenile stage, the extracellular matrix plays predominantly a structural role by providing support to cells and tissues; however, during development, matrix proteins exert a plethora of diverse signals to guide the movement and determine the fate of pluripotent cells. Taking a closer look at the communication between the extracellular matrix and cells of a developing body may bring new insights into cancer biology and identify cancer weaknesses. This review discusses parallels between the extracellular matrix roles during development and tumor growth.

Abstract: Summary
Worldwide cooling energy demands will increase by four times by 2050. Thermally driven cooling technology is an alternative solution to electric heat pumps in removing hazardous refrigerants and harnessing renewables and waste heat. We highlight the advantages of water-stable microporous aluminum-carboxylate-based metal-organic frameworks, or Al-MOFs, as sorbents in the application of producing cold from heat. Here, we synthesize the Al-MOFs with green and scalable processes, which are prerequisites for exploring various industrial and civil applications. A proof-of-concept full-scale adsorption chiller with different Al-MOFs is built up with optimized configurations derived from various characterization techniques. The tested Al-MOFs achieve thermal efficiency above 0.6 and specific cooling power over 1 kW/kg in typical cooling scenarios. Notably, when solar thermal energy is used as the heat source in an outdoor validation, Al-MOFs are weather-resilient solutions that exhibit a stable energy conversion efficiency under fluctuating operating conditions (ambient temperature and solar irradiation).

Abstract: Metastasis remains the main challenge to overcome for treating ovarian cancers. In this study, we investigate the potential role of the Cdc42 GAP StarD13 in the modulation of cell motility, invasion in ovarian cancer cells. StarD13 depletion does not affect the 2D motility of ovarian cancer cells. More importantly, StarD13 inhibits matrix degradation, invadopodia formation and cell invasion through the inhibition of Cdc42. StarD13 does not localize to mature TKS4-labeled invadopodia that possess matrix degradation ability, while a Cdc42 FRET biosensor, detects Cdc42 activation in these invadopodia. In fact, StarD13 localization and Cdc42 activation appear mutually exclusive in invadopodial structures. Finally, for the first time we uncover a potential role of Cdc42 in the direct recruitment of TKS4 to invadopodia. This study emphasizes the specific role of StarD13 as a narrow spatial regulator of Cdc42, inhibiting invasion, suggesting the suitability of StarD13 for targeted therapy.

Abstract: Ena/VASP proteins are powerful actin polymerases that drive the processive elongation of actin filaments. Members of this protein family have been implicated in a variety of important cellular processes including axon guidance, cell migration and adhesion. However, the specific function of these proteins in macroendocytosis, comprising macropinocytosis and phagocytosis remain rather poorly understood. Here, we used the professional phagocyte Dictyostelium discoideum to address the function and dynamics of its only family member VASP in macroendocytosis. Confocal time-lapse imaging revealed that VASP localized prominently in a circumferential narrow band at the advancing rim of the phagocytic cup followed by its aperture-like convergence upon particle internalization. Loss of VASP resulted in substantial defects in both, macropinocytosis of bulk fluid and phagocytosis of yeast particles. Consistently, VASP-deficiency coincided with diminished speed of the protruding rim and an impaired internalization rate. Most intriguingly, after cup closure, VASP condensed at the distal side of internalized phagosomes and initiated localized de-novo actin assembly to propel the phagosome by an actin-rich comet deeper into the cell, resembling intracellular movement of rocketing Listeria cells. In line with these findings, travelled distance and speed of rocketing phagosomes in VASP-deficient cells were markedly impaired.

Abstract: Summary
Interface engineering is a powerful strategy for modulating electronic structure and enhancing intrinsic activity of electrocatalysts for water splitting. Here, we grow two-dimensional cobalt-iron hydroxide (CoFe-OH) nanosheets on nickel foam substrates and deposit FeOOH nanoparticles in a rapid and scalable wet chemical approach. The CoFe-OH@FeOOH nanocomposite features abundant active sites and high surface area, allowing fast kinetics for electrochemical water splitting. The electrode has a low overpotential value of 200 mV at 50 mA cm−2 for oxygen evolution. When used as both anode and cathode for overall water splitting, CoFe-OH@FeOOH provides a low cell voltage of 1.56 V to deliver 10 mA cm−2 current density. The synergistic activity is presumed to be from the seamless interface of CoFe-OH and FeOOH, improving conductivity and mass transfer. We envision that this simple approach may offer a new direction for designing efficient electrodes for energy conversion applications.

Abstract: Summary
To meet the 30,000-h design lifetime of a typical turbine disc, understanding of long-term creep behavior is critical to prevent premature structural failure. The existing creep-life predictions often belittle the importance of multiple dislocation-precipitate interactions, resulting in several-orders-of-magnitude deviations in comparison with experiments. Herein, our experimental observation shows precipitate spatial distribution to yield uncertainty of dislocation-precipitate interactions and precipitate-size lognormal distribution to cause coexistence of climb, cutting, and Orowan mechanisms. Accounting for this physical process, we establish a unified model without adjustment parameters for predicting the stress-sensitive creep rate in precipitate-strengthened alloys. The predicted creep rates show agreement with experimental data, which makes up for the flaw of typical classic models with great deviations. Moreover, the present work reveals the stress-controlled transformation of multiple creep mechanisms and evaluates their weighting of creep-resistance contributions. Thus, our model provides insights for accurate design of high-strength and high-creep-resistant alloys under complex service environments.

Abstract: Primary cultures of the human airway epithelium (AE) cells are an indispensable tool in studies of pathophysiology of genetic and environmental pulmonary diseases, including cystic fibrosis (CF), primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Air-liquid interface (ALI) culture is the best method to follow the differentiation of ciliated cells, whose dysfunction forms the basis of PCD. Here, we used custom-designed Taqman Low Density Array (TLDA), qRT-PCR-based assay, to analyze expression of 14 AE genes in cells from healthy donors, cultured in ALI settings using Pneumacult medium, with the focus on genes involved in cilia differentiation and in PCD pathogenesis. The results of TLDA assay were compared with the bulk RNAseq analysis, and placed in the cellular context using immunofluorescent staining (IF) of ALI cultured cells. Expression analysis revealed culture time-related upregulation of the majority of cilia-related genes, followed by the appearance of respective protein signals visualized by IF. Strong correlation of TLDA with RNAseq results indicated that TLDA assay is a reliable and scalable approach to analyze expression of selected genes specific for different AE cell types. Characterization of temporal and inter-donor changes in the expression of these genes, performed in healthy donors and in well-defined ALI/Pnemacult culture conditions, provides a useful reference relevant for a broad spectrum of functional studies where the in vitro AE differentiation is in focus.

Abstract: Summary
Reducing the friction and wear of dynamic interfaces has been a constant endeavor in the field of sustainability. Lubricants with two-dimensional atomic materials are operative frameworks proposed as promising candidates: they can together generate both a boundary tribofilm and a liquid hydrodynamic film in the interfacial domain. However, a quantitative characterization of the film formation and their coupling behaviors in the finite domain is lacking. Here, we report the coupling effect of tribofilms and hydrodynamic films regulated by typical representatives of two-dimensional material family (graphene, hBN, MoS2, and WS2). The anti-wear properties of the interfaces are attributed to the behavior of the tribofilm, whereas the anti-friction properties of the interfaces are attributed to the viscosity behavior of the hydrodynamic film. This study provides an understanding of the intrinsic coupling mechanism of a tribofilm and a hydrodynamic film and a possible strategy for the design of interfacial lubricating systems.

Abstract: Summary
Anion intercalation in the graphite cathode of a dual-ion battery (DIB) occurs at unusually high voltage (>4.5 V K+/K). This exacerbates electrolyte degradation and corrosion of Al current collectors, leading to poor coulombic efficiency (CE), typically <90%, and short cell life as a result. These limitations can be mitigated if a stable cathode-electrolyte interface layer (CEI) can form on the graphite electrode. In this study, we demonstrate that the performance of a potassium-based DIB can be improved with a triallyl phosphate (TAP) monomer added in 6 m KN(SO2CF3)2 (KTFSI)-dimethyl carbonate (DMC) electrolyte. The TAP additive forms a stable polymeric CEI on the graphite particles and thus increases the CE of the cell to 97%–99%. Together with MoS2-negative electrodes with a pre-formed solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, the DIB concept has been shown to offer specific capacities from ∼40 to 80 mAh g−1 with an average discharge voltage of 3.7 V.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
Introduction
Time series studies related to blood donor candidates and blood donations are rare in Brazil. Population aging suggests a better understanding of the context related to blood donor candidates and blood donations performed.
Objective
The monthly series of candidates eligible to donate blood and actual donations between 2005 and 2019 at the Hemominas Foundation, Minas Gerais, Brazil, were described and analyzed.
Methods
Ten time series were constructed of blood donor candidates and blood donations. Each series covered the period from January 2005 to December 2019. The stationarity of the series was verified by the unit root test; the data distribution, by the Shapiro-Wilk test; the trend, by the Cox-Stuart test, and; the seasonality, by the Fisher's test (significance levels of 10% for the first test and 5% for the last three).
Results
All series were identified as non-stationary and presented trend and seasonality components. The rate of blood donor candidates and the rate of blood donations performed evidenced a positive upward trend until the last two-year analysis, when a drop occurred, from 1.75% and 1.42% in 2017 to 1.64% and 1.35% in 2019, respectively. The rate of blood donations trended downward, from 0.054% in 2005 to 0.046% in 2019. The proportion of unsuitable or unretained candidates reduced.
Conclusion
The study emphasized the need to stimulate blood donation by specific groups and increase ways to reduce the demand for blood components through the implementation of programs that expand alternatives to blood transfusions.

Abstract: Summary
Lithium plating is an anode-centric degradation process occurring in lithium-ion batteries resulting in irreversible capacity loss and cell failure. Temperature plays a critical role in improving the kinetics and transport, reducing lithium plating propensity. This study quantitively probes the evolution of plating with aging under temperature extremes in commercial Li-ion cells. Plating energy is proposed as a unique descriptor to quantify the extent of lithium plating and state of the electrode using operando analytics at any operating condition. Cells operated at temperature extrema (high/low) experience rapid capacity fade accompanied by a significant rise in anode impedance and exhibit plating energies greater than 1 Wh. Unfavorable intercalation kinetics at low temperatures and favorable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) kinetics at high temperatures exacerbate anode impedance. These kinetically disparate manifestations on anode impedance adversely impact the interfacial overpotential and reversibility of plating, resulting in localized deposits and preferential stripping, ultimately promoting cell failure.

Abstract: Induction of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) expression ameliorates the clinical severity and prolong survival in persons with sickle cell disease (SCD). Hydroxyurea (HU) is the only FDA-approved HbF inducer however, additional therapeutics that produce an additive effect in SCD are needed. To this end, development of potent Class I histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) for HbF induction represents a rational molecularly targeted approach. In studies here, we evaluated CT-101, a novel Class I-restricted HDACi, a Largazole derivative, for pharmacodynamics, cytotoxicity, and targeted epigenetic effects. In SCD-derived erythroid progenitors, CT-101 induced HbF expression with additive activity in combination with HU. CT-101 preferentially activated γ-globin gene transcription, increased acetylated histone H3 levels, and conferred an open chromatin conformation in the γ-globin promoter. These data indicate CT-101 represents a strong potential candidate as a molecularly targeted inducer of HbF.

Abstract: Spatial and temporal regulation of molecular reactions dictates cell fate. Thus, studying molecular dynamics is essential to understand how cells decide what to do and the fundamental perturbations causing disease. Classically, molecular dynamics has been studied by protocols based in the overexpression of fluorescent fusion proteins. However, overexpression is associated to altered stoichiometry, molecular dynamics and subcellular distribution. We here discuss the necessity to study molecular dynamics of fluorescent fusion proteins expressed under physiological mechanisms in the cell, pointing to CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing as the ideal means to do so. Current genome editing protocols enable us to study molecular dynamics while avoiding drawbacks associated to overexpression.

Abstract: How our brains have developed to perform the many complex functions that make us human has long remained a question of great interest. Over the last few decades, many scientists from a wide range of fields have tried to answer this question by aiming to uncover the mechanisms that regulate the development of the human neocortex. They have approached this on different scales, focusing microscopically on individual cells all the way up to macroscopically imaging entire brains within living patients. In this review we will summarise these key findings and how they fit together.

Abstract: The insect compound eye is the most abundant eye architecture on earth. It comes in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, which are exquisitely adapted to specific ecosystems. Here, we explore the organisational principles and pathways, from molecular to tissular, that underpin the building of this organ and highlight why it is an excellent model system to investigate the relationship between genes and tissue form. The compound eye offers wide fields of view, high sensitivity in motion detection and infinite depth of field. It is made of an array of visual units called ommatidia, which are precisely tiled in 3D to shape the retinal tissue as a dome-like structure. The eye starts off as a 2D epithelium, and it acquires its 3D organisation as ommatidia get into shape. Each ommatidium is made of a complement of retinal cells, including light-detecting photoreceptors and lens-secreting cells. The lens cells generate the typical hexagonal facet lens that lies atop the photoreceptors so that the eye surface consists of a quasi-crystalline array of these hexagonal facet-lenses. This array is curved to various degree, depending on the size and shape of the eye, and on the region of the retina. This curvature sets the resolution and visual field of the eye and is determined by i) the number and size of the facet lens – large ommatidial lenses can be used to generate flat, higher resolution areas, while smaller facets allow for stronger curvature of the eye, and ii) precise control of the inter facet-lens angle, which determines the optical axis of the each ommatidium. In this review we discuss how combinatorial variation in eye primordium shape, ommatidial number, facet lens size and inter facet-lens angle underpins the wide variety of insect eye shapes, and we explore what is known about the mechanisms that might control these parameters.

Abstract: Introduction
As the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic unfolds around the world; answers related to the antibody response against the virus are necessary to develop treatment and prophylactic strategies. We attempted to understand part of the immune response of convalescent plasma donation candidates.
Method
We carried out a cross-sectional, observational, non-intervention study, testing 102 convalescent plasma donation candidates for antibodies against the virus, relating these data to the time interval between symptom onset and sample collection, age, disease severity, and gender.
Results
In our sample, the individuals who developed a greater antibody response were the ones who had a longer time interval between symptom onset and sample collection, the ones who had been hospitalized and the subjects above 35 years old. Moreover, 17 individuals did not present any reactive antibodies.
Conclusion
These results are important in that they raise questions about the role of the humoral response against the virus, as some individuals do not develop antibodies to fight it. In addition, they help develop recruitment strategies for convalescent plasma donors, who should be asymptomatic for at least 21 days and are possibly more likely to have reactive antibodies after 35 days without symptoms.

Abstract: Summary
As a key species in understanding the hydrogen-bonding network transitions between liquid water and ice, the neutral water heptamer is a challenging experimental target, owing to the richness of low-lying isomers. Here, we report the size-specific infrared spectra of confinement-free, neutral water heptamer (H2O)7 based on threshold photoionization using a tunable vacuum ultraviolet free electron laser. The complexity of the observed spectra indicates that many nearly isoenergetic isomers are present at finite temperatures. Two classes of prism- and cage-like structures are identified in a high-pressure pulsed supersonic expansion of water heptamer, in which the former is favored energetically at low temperatures and serves as a major contributor to the experimental spectrum. These findings provide key information for filling the gap between well-studied water hexamer and octamer.

Abstract: Summary
The design and synthesis of separation materials for lanthanides with extremely similar properties have always been a significant challenge. Here, a two-dimensional (2D) metal–organic framework (MOF) with crystal faces similar to the [002] of ZIF-8, which theory suggests should not be stable, is predicted and synthesized by solvent evaporation between graphene layers to prepare a 2D vertical heterostructure membrane. Theoretically, the pristine cluster of 2D MOFs contains one small and 1/4 large crown pores, and the small pores can selectively adsorb lanthanide elements, causing the selective penetration of lanthanide ions. Experimentally, the selectivity of lanthanide is obtained through the membrane with La3+/Yb3+ ≈55.79 and La3+/Ce3+ ≈6.02. The interlayer entrapment of graphene stabilizes the structure of the 2D MOF, and the intercalation of the 2D MOF expands and fixes the interlayer spacing of graphene oxide, improving the stability in strong acids, the selectivity, and the ion transmittance of the membrane.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
Introduction
An important component of the advances made in neuroblastoma treatment has been the use of peripheral blood stem cells to support high-dose chemotherapy. In this study, we report our experience on a series of small children who have undergone standard and large volume leukaphersis (LVL) procedures, provide an update on a single institution's experience with cryopreservation of autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs), using 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and applying post-thaw DMSO depletion and analyze a number of variables that may affect viability.
Methods
A total of 36 aphereses were performed on 29 children weighing less than 25 kg between July 2016 and October 2019 at the Ibn Sina university hospital.
Results
Seven females and twenty-two males, median bodyweight 14 kg (9 - 22). A single apheresis was sufficient to obtain at least 3 × 10⁶/kg body weight (BW) of CD34+ cells in 82.8% of the cases. The LVL was performed in 22 aphereses. A median number of 5.9 × 10⁶/kg CD34 cells were collected per apheresis. A total of 60 PBSC samples were cryopreserved and 46 samples were infused. The mean cell viability percentage decreased from 94.75 ± 1.14% before freezing to 70.84 ± 8.6% after thawing (p < 0.001). No correlation was found between post-thaw viability and storage time (r = -0.233; p = 0.234) or number of total nucleated cells (r = 0.344; p = 0.073).
Conclusion
Leukapheresis is safe and feasible in small pediatric patients if the appropriate measures are used. Cryopreservation poses numerous challenges, especially a decrease in cell viability after thawing.

Abstract: Endothelial dysfunction plays a major role in sickle cell anemia (SCA) systemic vasculopathy, with upregulation of adhesion molecules (e.g., VCAM-1), decreased nitric oxide bioavailability, and oxidative stress. We aimed to assess the modulation role of pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidative stimuli on endothelial VCAM1, NOS3, and HMOX1 expression. We also evaluated the effect of the main SCA therapeutic agent, hydroxyurea, on that modulation. Our results showed that two VCAM1 promoter haplotypes, we previously associated with pediatric cerebral vasculopathy and severe hemolysis in SCA, increased promoter activity in TNF-α-stimulated transfected EA.hy926 and HBEC cell lines, consistent with a higher VCAM1 expression in macro and microvascular settings. In non-transfected cells, we also observed TNF-α-induced VCAM1 overexpression as well as heme-induced overexpression of HMOX1 in both cell models. Heme did not affect VCAM1 nor NOS3 expression and the latter was also not affected by TNF-α stimulus. Hydroxyurea treatment lowered TNF-induced VCAM1 and NOS3 expression but did not affect heme-induced HMOX1 expression. These data further indicate that VCAM1 haplotypes we studied lead to higher VCAM1 expression affecting not only cerebral but also systemic vasculopathy risk. The differential endothelial expression of VCAM1, NOS3, and HMOX1 also confirms their genetic modulation role in SCA systemic vasculopathy.

Abstract: Summary
The stellarator offers an attractive approach to fusion energy. How to simplify its complicated 3D coil system has always been one of the most important topics. Recent study indicates that the coils can be dramatically simplified through introducing permanent magnets. However, the existing designs use permanent magnets with various shapes, sizes, and even arbitrary magnetization orientations, so that their fabrication and assembly may be even more difficult and costly than the 3D coils. Here, we propose an innovative strategy to design advanced stellarators with standardized permanent magnet blocks, such as identical cubes. This magnet design may substantially reduce the difficulty and cost of magnet fabrication and assembly. The standardized magnet blocks can be easily manufactured and assembled offline with tight tolerance in the mounting frames. These innovations significantly lower the engineering barrier for stellarator construction, which potentially opens a new avenue for fast development of the stellarator fusion approach.

Abstract: Summary
Increased conversion of near-infrared (NIR) photons to electricity is needed to improve dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). Here, we report two squaraine dyes (RR13 and RR14) with unsymmetrical cores as NIR dyes in DSCs. Both dyes feature a conjugated indolizine donor with an indoline donor on the opposite side of the squaraine core. The dyes are studied via absorption spectroscopy, computational interrogation, and electrochemical analysis. The use of the strongly donating indolizine donor results in NIR photon-to-current conversion extending beyond 800 nm on TiO2 in DSC devices. The DSC devices were characterized by current-voltage curves, incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency measurements, and electrical impedance spectroscopy. After co-sensitized DSC device optimizations, the NIR-absorbing squaraine dyes complemented with commercial organic dyes (D35 and Y123) gave a high photocurrent output of ∼21 mA/cm2 with a PCE of 9.4%.

Abstract: Summary
Stable supplies of water, energy, and food are the most essential factors to universal achievements of the United Nation’s Sustainable Developments Goals (SDGs) by 2030. This work reports a self-sustained and solar-driven, integrated water-electricity-crop co-production system (WEC2P). The design of WEC2P is based on the atmospheric water adsorption-desorption cycle (1) to generate cooling power for photovoltaic (PV) cells to increase their electricity generation performance or (2) to sustainably produce fresh water from atmospheric water vapor to support crop growth. During the 3-month-long outdoor field test, the WEC2P successfully reduced the temperature of PV panels by up to 17°C and increased their electricity generation by up to 9.9% in the PV cooling mode. Meanwhile, it produced water to irrigate crops (i.e., water spinach) hosted in an integrated plant-growing unit in Saudi Arabia, with a crop surviving rate of 95%. Thereby, WEC2P may represent a meaningful contribution to the global water-energy-food nexus.

Abstract: Summary
Electrocatalytic dehalogenation (EDH) is a promising green technology for the breakage of strong carbon-chlorine (C-Cl) bonds that have fundamental importance in organic chemistry and environmental remediation. The lack of fundamental understanding and practical issues such as potential secondary pollution, side reactions (e.g., hydrogen-evolution reaction), deficiency in catalytic activity, and/or stability have limited the adoption of EDH technology. Here, we address these problems by designing a palladium-based nanocatalyst with precise control of atomic vacancies to exploit the combination of direct and indirect EDH. Experimental and theoretical investigations show that atomic vacancies can promote electron transfer on the catalyst surface to enhance the generation/storage capacity of atomic hydrogen and to simultaneously facilitate dissociative electron transfer to C-Cl bond. Our work guides the design of atomic-vacancy-rich palladium-based electrocatalysts and provides a new strategy for efficient electro-dehalogenation in water and fundamental insights into the relationship of different dehalogenation mechanisms for accurate quantitative prediction.

Abstract: Introduction
Urgent blood component transfusions may be life-saving for patients in hemorrhagic shock. Measures to reduce the time taken to provide these transfusions, such as uncrossmatched transfusion or abbreviated testing, are available. However, transport time is still an additional delay and the use of a pneumatic tube system (PTS) may be an alternative to shorten the transport time of blood components.
Objectives
To assess pneumatic tube system transportation of blood components based on a validation protocol. Methods: Pre- and post-transport quality control laboratory parameters, visual appearance, transport time and temperature of the packed red blood cells (RBCs), thawed fresh plasma (TFP), cryoprecipitate (CR), and platelet concentrate (PC) were evaluated. Parameters were compared between transport via pneumatic tube and courier.
Results
A total of 23 units of RBCs, 50 units of TFP, 30 units of CR and ten units of PC were evaluated. No statistically significant differences were found between pre- and post-transport laboratory results. There was also no difference in laboratory parameters between transport modalities (PTS versus courier). All blood components transported matched regulatory requirements for quality criteria. The temperature during transport remained stable and the transport time via PTS was significantly shorter than the courier's transport time (p < 0.05).
Conclusion
The PTS was considered a fast, safe and reliable means of transportation for blood components, also securing quality prerequisites.

Abstract: Stratified epithelia are made up of several layers of cells, which act as a protective barrier for the organ they cover. To ensure their shielding effect, epithelia are naturally able to cope with constant environmental insults. This ability is enabled by their morphology and architecture, as well as the continuous turnover of stem and progenitor cells that constitute their building blocks. Stem cell fate decisions and dynamics are fundamental key biological processes that allow epithelia to exert their functions. By focusing on the skin epidermis, this review discusses how tissue architecture is generated during development, maintained through adult life, and re-established during regeneration.

Abstract: Dickkopf1 (DKK1) was originally identified as a secreted protein that antagonizes Wnt signaling. Although DKK1 is essential for the developmental process, its functions in postnatal and adult life are unclear. However, evidence is accumulating that DKK1 is involved in tumorigenesis in a manner unrelated to Wnt signaling. In addition, recent studies have revealed that DKK1 may control immune reactions, although the relationship of this to Wnt signaling is unknown. Other DKK family members, DKK2–4, are likely to have their own functions. Here, we review the possible novel functions of DKKs. We summarize the characteristics of receptors of DKKs and the signaling mechanisms through DKKs and their receptors, provide evidence showing that DKKs are involved in tumor aggressiveness independently of Wnt signaling, and emphasize promising cancer therapies targeting DKKs and receptors. Lastly, we discuss various physiological and pathological processes controlled by DKKs.

Abstract: Introduction
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel viral disease with person-to-person transmission that has spread to many countries since the end of 2019. Although many unknowns were resolved within a year and the vaccine is available, it is still a major global health problem.
Objective
COVID-19 infection may present with a considerably wide spectrum of severity and host factors play a significant role in determining the course of the disease. One of these factors is blood groups. Based on previous experience, it is believed that the ABO blood group type affects prognosis, treatment response and length of stay in the hospital. In this study, our aim was to evaluate whether the blood group had an effect on the length of the hospital stay. To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have assessed the effect of ABO blood groups, as well as age, on the length of the hospital stay in these settings.
Methods
In this retrospective cohort study, 969 patients admitted to our hospital between March 15, 2020 and May 15, 2020 were evaluated. The patients were divided into 4 groups according to ABO blood groups. The effect of the ABO blood group by age on the course of the disease, need for intensive care, duration of hospitalization and mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection, especially in geriatric patients, was evaluated.
Results
Of all the patients, 9.1% required admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), of whom 83% died. The average length of ICU stay was 11 days (0 - 59). The observed mortality rates in blood groups A, B, AB and 0 were 86.4%, 93.3%, 80.0% and 70.8%, respectively, indicating similar death rates in all ABO blood types. When the Rh phenotype was taken into consideration, no significant changes in results were seen.
Conclusion
As a result, we could not observe a significant relationship between blood groups and clinical outcomes in this study, which included a sample of Turkish patients with COVID-19.

Abstract: Progressive pancytopenia is a common feature observed in DNA crosslink repair deficiency disorder, Fanconi anemia (FA). However, this phenotype has not been recapitulated in single FA gene knockout animal models. In this study, we analyzed hematological characteristics in zebrafish null mutants for two FA genes, fanca and fanco. In adult mutants, we demonstrate age-associated reduction in blood cell counts for all lineages, resembling progressive pancytopenia in FA patients. In larval mutants, we demonstrate vascular injury-induced thrombosis defects, particularly upon treatment with crosslinking agent diepoxybutane (DEB), indicating DNA damage induced inefficiency of thrombocytes.

Abstract: Summary
Despite being effective for many other solid tumors, traditional anti-angiogenic therapy has been shown to be insufficient for the treatment of malignant glioma. Here, we report the development of polyphenol nanoparticles (NPs), which not only inhibit the formation of new vessels but also enable targeted disruption of the existing tumor vasculature. The NPs are synthesized through a combinatory iron-coordination and polymer-stabilization approach, which allows for high drug loading and intrinsic tumor vessel targeting. We study a lead NP consisting of quercetin and find that the NP after intravenous administration preferentially binds to VEGFR2, which is overexpressed in tumor vasculature. We demonstrate that the binding is mediated by quercetin, and the interaction of NPs with VEGFR2 leads to disruption of the existing tumor vasculature and inhibition of new vessel development. As a result, systemic treatment with the NPs effectively inhibits tumor growth and increases drug delivery to tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Solid-state batteries hold the promise to be highly impactful next-generation technologies for high-energy and -power-density rechargeable battery applications. It is crucial to identify the metrics that an emerging battery technology should fulfill to achieve parity with conventional Li-ion batteries, primarily in terms of energy density. However, limited approaches exist today to assess and extrapolate the impact of battery designs and choices of cell components on the cell-level energy density of a solid-state battery. Herein, we introduce the Solid-State Battery Performance Analyzer and Calculator (SolidPAC), an interactive experimental toolkit to enable the design of a solid-state battery for user-specified application requirements. The toolkit is flexible enough to assist the battery community in quantifying the impact of materials chemistry and fractions, electrode thicknesses and loadings, and electron flows on cell energy density and costs and in utilizing inverse engineering concepts to correlate the cell energy density output to materials and cell design inputs.

Abstract: Background
Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell transplantation is the main treatment option for hematological malignancies and disorders. One strategy to solve the problem of low stem cell doses used in transplantation is pre-transplant expansion. We hypothesized that using fibronectin-coated microfluidic channels would expand HSPCs and keep self-renewal potential in a three-dimensional environment, compared to the conventional method. We also compared stem cell homing factors expression in microfluidic to conventional cultures.
Materials and methods
A microfluidic device was created and characterized by scanning electron microscopy. The CD133+ cells were collected from cord blood and purified. They were subsequently cultured in 24-well plates and microfluidic bioreactor systems using the StemSpan serum-free medium. Eventually, we analyzed cell surface expression levels of the CXCR4 molecule and CXCR4 mRNA expression in CD133+ cells cultured in different systems.
Results
The expansion results showed significant improvement in CD133+ cell expansion in the microfluidic system than the conventional method. The median expression of the CXCR4 in the expanded cell was lower in the conventional system than in the microfluidic system. The CXCR4 gene expression up-regulated in the microfluidic system.
Conclusion
Utilizing microfluidic systems to expand desired cells effectively is the next step in cell culture. Comparative gene expression profiling provides a glimpse of the effects of culture microenvironments on the genetic program of HSCs grown in different systems.

Abstract: Summary
Tin-based perovskite solar cells could replace their toxic, lead-containing counterparts and have been developed rapidly to exceed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14%. However, further improvement is limited by poor film quality, largely because of fast crystallization and the tendency of tin-based perovskites toward defects. Here, we report that substituted thiourea can effectively slow the crystallization of formamidinium tin triiodide (FASnI3) and inhibit its surface defects. Thus, pinhole-free films comprising tiled FASnI3 crystallites are fabricated reproducibly. Annealed films retain a small percentage of the residual ligand, which can account for the observed carrier lifetimes of as long as 43 ns. By tuning the ligand structure, we progressively enhance the open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current density of our solar cells and attain PCEs of over 12%. Our simple solution simultaneously addresses two key issues of FASnI3 and paves the way for more efficient and robust tin-based perovskite solar cells.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
Introduction
The pro-inflammatory immune response underlies severe cases of COVID-19. Antigens of the Duffy blood group systems are receptors for pro-inflammation chemokines. The ACKR1 c.-67T>C gene variation silences the expression of Duffy antigens on erythrocytes and individuals presenting this variant in homozygosity have impaired inflammatory response control. Our aim was to evaluate the association between the ACKR1 c.-67T>C and the severity of COVID-19.
Methods
This was a retrospective single-center case-control study, enrolling 164 participants who were divided into four groups: 1) Death: COVID-19 patients who died during hospitalization; 2) Hospital Discharge: COVID-19 patients who were discharged for home after hospitalizations; 3) Convalescent Plasma Donors: COVID-19 patients who were not hospitalized, and; 4) Controls: patients with diagnosis other than COVID-19. Patients were genotyped for the ACKR1 c.-67T>C (FY*02 N.01 allele) and the frequency of individuals presenting the altered allele was compared between the groups.
Results
The groups significantly differed in terms of the percentage of patients presenting at least one FY*02N.01 allele: 36.8% (Death group), 37% (Hospital Discharge group), 16.1% (Convalescent Plasma group) and 16.2% (Control group) (p = 0.027). The self-declared race (p < 0.001) and the occurrence of in hospital death (p = 0.058) were independently associated with the presence of the FY*02N.01 allele. Hypertension (p < 0.001), age (p < 0.001) and the presence of at least one FY*02N.01 allele (p = 0.009) were independently associated with the need for hospitalization.
Conclusion
There is a suggestive association between the presence of the FY*02N.01 and the severity of COVID-19. This may be a mechanism underlying the worse prognosis for Afro-descendants infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Abstract: Summary
Strategies to maximize the energy density of Li-ion cells include increasing the Ni content of the cathode active material (CAM), decreasing the porosity of the cathode, and increasing the depth of discharge during cycling. These strategies put high mechanical stress on the typically polycrystalline CAM, whether it is due to anisotropic volume expansion of the crystallites during charge-discharge cycling or to the high calendering pressures needed to reach target electrode porosities. Here, we study the impact that Al and W dopants have on the mechanical properties of polycrystalline LiNiO2 by conducting “crush tests.” This method is a simple way to predict whether a material can bear the mechanical stress it will endure in cell cycling. A universal tension/compression testing system is also used to quantify the compression work of the studied materials. Materials with higher compression work also have higher capacity retention during cycling.

Abstract: Summary
The oxygen release of layered cathodes causes many battery failures, but the underlying mechanism in an actual working cathode is still elusive as it involves secondary agglomerates that introduce complicated boundary structures. Here, we report a general structure instability on the mismatch boundaries driven by interfacial gliding—it introduces a shear stress causing a distortion of the metal-oxygen octahedra framework that reduces its kinetic stability. The migration of cations and diffusion of oxygen vacancies continue to degrade the whole particle from the boundary to the interior, followed by the formation of nano-sized cracks on the fast-degrading interfaces. This work reveals a robust chemical and mechanical interplay on the oxygen release inherent to the intergranular boundaries of layered cathodes. It also suggests that radially patterned columnar grains with low-angle planar boundaries would be an efficient approach to mitigate the boundary oxygen release.
