Abstract: Human mesenchymal stem cells (HMSCs) have been applied in various clinic settings. Ion channels play an important role in cellular physiology. However, the potential role of cationic channels in regulating the proliferation and migration properties of hMSCs remains to be determined. In the present study, the functional expression of ion channels in hMSCs was investigated by patch clamp. MTT assay and BrdU stainings were used to assess the proliferation of hMSCs. hMSC migration was evaluated by Transwell migration assays. The results show that sodium-, L-type calcium, potassium currents have been identified in hMSCs. TEA (K+ channel blocker), nifedipine (Ca2+ channel blocker) can inhibit both proliferation and migration of hMSCs. The increase of extracellular Ca2+ concentration promoted both proliferation and migration of hMSCs. TTX, a Na+ channel blocker, promoted cell proliferation but inhibited cell migration. Our data suggest that cationic channels (sodium, L-type calcium, potassium channels) play important roles in regulating proliferation and migration of hMSCs.

Abstract: Summary
The complexes of the electron transport chain associate into large macromolecular assemblies, which are believed to facilitate efficient electron flow. We have identified a conserved mitochondrial protein, named respiratory supercomplex factor 1 (Rcf1—Yml030w), that is required for the normal assembly of respiratory supercomplexes. We demonstrate that Rcf1 stably and independently associates with both Complex III and Complex IV of the electron transport chain. Deletion of the RCF1 gene caused impaired respiration, probably as a result of destabilization of respiratory supercomplexes. Consistent with the hypothetical function of these respiratory assemblies, loss of RCF1 caused elevated mitochondrial oxidative stress and damage. Finally, we show that knockdown of HIG2A, a mammalian homolog of RCF1, causes impaired supercomplex formation. We suggest that Rcf1 is a member of an evolutionarily conserved protein family that acts to promote respiratory supercomplex assembly and activity.

Abstract: Interactions between the proteins of the ternary soluble N-ethyl maleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex, synaptobrevin 2 (Sb2), syntaxin 1A (Sx1A) and synaptosome-associated protein of 25kDa (SNAP25) can be readily assessed using force spectroscopy single-molecule measurements. We studied interactions during the disassembly of the ternary SNARE complex pre-formed by binding Sb2 in parallel or anti-parallel orientations to the binary Sx1A–SNAP25B acceptor complex. We determined the spontaneous dissociation lifetimes and found that the stability of the anti-parallel ternary SNARE complex is ∼1/3 less than that of the parallel complex. While the free energies were very similar, within 0.5 kBT, for both orientations, the enthalpy changes (42.1 kBT and 39.8 kBT, for parallel and anti-parallel orientations, respectively) indicate that the parallel ternary complex is energetically advantageous by 2.3 kBT. Indeed, both ternary SNARE complex orientations were much more stable (by ∼4–13 times) and energetically favorable (by ∼9–13 kBT) than selected binary complexes, constituents of the ternary complex, in both orientations. We propose a model which considers the geometry for the vesicle approach to the plasma membrane with favorable energies and stability as the basis for preferential usage of the parallel ternary SNARE complex in exocytosis.

Abstract: Summary
Faithful propagation of specific chromatin states requires re-establishment of epigenetic marks after every cell division. How the original epigenetic signature is inherited after disruption during DNA replication is still poorly understood. Here, we show that the poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase-1 (PARP1/ARTD1) is implicated in the maintenance of silent rDNA chromatin during cell division. We demonstrate that PARP1 associates with TIP5, a subunit of the NoRC complex, via the noncoding pRNA and binds to silent rRNA genes after their replication in mid-late S phase. PARP1 represses rRNA transcription and is implicated in the formation of silent rDNA chromatin. Silent rDNA chromatin is a specific substrate for ADP-ribosylation and the enzymatic activity of PARP1 is necessary to establish rDNA silencing. The data unravel a function of PARP1 and ADP-ribosylation that serves to allow for the inheritance of silent chromatin structures, shedding light on how epigenetic marks are transmitted during each cell cycle.

Abstract: CD99 is involved in many cellular events, such as the generation of Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells, T cell costimulation, and leukocyte transendothelial migration. However, these studies have been limited to in vitro or in vivo experiments using CD99-deficient cell lines or anti-CD99 antibodies. In the present study, using CD99-deficient mice established by the exchangeable gene trap method, we investigated the physiologic function of murine CD99. In a B6 splenocytes → bm12 graft-versus-host disease model, wild-type cells were minimally lethal, whereas all mice that received CD99-deficient donor cells developed an early and more severe pathology. Graft-versus-host disease in these mice was associated with insufficient expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells. This was confirmed by experiments illustrating that the injection of wild-type donor cells depleted of Mac-1+ cells led to an almost identical disease course as the CD99-deficient donor system. Therefore, these results suggest that CD99 plays a crucial role in the attenuation of graft-versus-host disease by regulating the expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells.

Abstract: Summary
Acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs) are characterized by multistep oncogenic processes leading to cell-differentiation arrest and proliferation. Specific abrogation of maturation blockage constitutes a promising therapeutic option in cancer, which requires precise understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms. We show that the cortical thymic maturation arrest in T-lineage ALLs that overexpress TLX1 or TLX3 is due to binding of TLX1/TLX3 to ETS1, leading to repression of T cell receptor (TCR) α enhanceosome activity and blocked TCR-Jα rearrangement. TLX1/TLX3 abrogation or enforced TCRαβ expression leads to TCRα rearrangement and apoptosis. Importantly, the autoextinction of clones carrying TCRα-driven TLX1 expression supports TLX “addiction” in TLX-positive leukemias and provides further rationale for targeted therapy based on disruption of TLX1/TLX3.

Abstract: Summary
The timing and mechanisms of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) segregation and transmission in mammals are poorly understood. Genetic bottleneck in female germ cells has been proposed as the main phenomenon responsible for rapid intergenerational segregation of heteroplasmic mtDNA. We demonstrate here that mtDNA segregation occurs during primate preimplantation embryogenesis resulting in partitioning of mtDNA variants between daughter blastomeres. A substantial shift toward homoplasmy occurred in fetuses and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) derived from these heteroplasmic embryos. We also observed a wide range of heteroplasmic mtDNA variants distributed in individual oocytes recovered from these fetuses. Thus, we present here evidence for a previously unknown mtDNA segregation and bottleneck during preimplantation embryo development, suggesting that return to the homoplasmic condition can occur during development of an individual organism from the zygote to birth, without a passage through the germline.

Abstract: Summary
Rescuing the function of mutant p53 protein is an attractive cancer therapeutic strategy. Using the National Cancer Institute's anticancer drug screen data, we identified two compounds from the thiosemicarbazone family that manifest increased growth inhibitory activity in mutant p53 cells, particularly for the p53R175 mutant. Mechanistic studies reveal that NSC319726 restores WT structure and function to the p53R175 mutant. This compound kills p53R172H knockin mice with extensive apoptosis and inhibits xenograft tumor growth in a 175-allele-specific mutant p53-dependent manner. This activity depends upon the zinc ion chelating properties of the compound as well as redox changes. These data identify NSC319726 as a p53R175 mutant reactivator and as a lead compound for p53-targeted drug development.

Abstract: Summary
Increased transcription of ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA) by RNA Polymerase I is a common feature of human cancer, but whether it is required for the malignant phenotype remains unclear. We show that rDNA transcription can be therapeutically targeted with the small molecule CX-5461 to selectively kill B-lymphoma cells in vivo while maintaining a viable wild-type B cell population. The therapeutic effect is a consequence of nucleolar disruption and activation of p53-dependent apoptotic signaling. Human leukemia and lymphoma cell lines also show high sensitivity to inhibition of rDNA transcription that is dependent on p53 mutational status. These results identify selective inhibition of rDNA transcription as a therapeutic strategy for the cancer specific activation of p53 and treatment of hematologic malignancies.

Abstract: The process of regulated exocytosis has received considerable interest as a key component of synaptic transmission. Fusion of presynaptic vesicles and the subsequent release of their neurotransmitter contents is driven by a series of interactions between evolutionarily conserved proteins. Key insights into the molecular mechanisms of vesicle fusion have come from research using genetic model systems such as the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. We review here the current knowledge regarding regulated exocytosis at the C. elegans synapse and future research directions involving this model organism.

Abstract: Summary
Localization of mRNA is a critical mechanism used by a large fraction of transcripts to restrict its translation to specific cellular regions. Although current high-resolution imaging techniques provide ample information, the analysis methods for localization have either been qualitative or employed quantification in nonrandomly selected regions of interest. Here, we describe an analytical method for objective quantification of mRNA localization using a combination of two characteristics of its molecular distribution, polarization and dispersion. The validity of the method is demonstrated using single-molecule FISH images of budding yeast and fibroblasts. Live-cell analysis of endogenous β-actin mRNA in mouse fibroblasts reveals that mRNA polarization has a half-life of ∼16 min and is cross-correlated with directed cell migration. This novel approach provides insights into the dynamic regulation of mRNA localization and its physiological roles.

Abstract: Summary
Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are at the heart of eukaryotic cell-cycle control. The yeast Cdc2/CDC28 PSTAIRE kinase and its orthologs such as the mammalian Cdk1 have been found to be indispensable for cell-cycle progression in all eukaryotes investigated so far. CDKA;1 is the only PSTAIRE kinase in the flowering plant Arabidopsis and can rescue Cdc2/CDC28 mutants. Here, we show that cdka;1 null mutants are viable but display specific cell-cycle and developmental defects, e.g., in S phase entry and stem cell maintenance. We unravel that the crucial function of CDKA;1 is the control of the plant Retinoblastoma homolog RBR1 and that codepletion of RBR1 and CDKA;1 rescued most defects of cdka;1 mutants. Our work further revealed a basic cell-cycle control system relying on two plant-specific B1-type CDKs, and the triple cdk mutants displayed an early germline arrest. Taken together, our data indicate divergent functional differentiation of Cdc2-type kinases during eukaryote evolution.

Abstract: Summary
Although bacterial endotoxin, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), plays a key role in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), detailed mechanisms of this pathogenesis remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that upregulation of CD14 by leptin-mediated signaling is critical to hyperreactivity against endotoxin during NASH progression. Upregulation of CD14 in Kupffer cells and hyperreactivity against low-dose LPS were observed in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced steatosis mice, but not chow-fed-control mice. Hyperresponsivity against low-dose LPS led to accelerated NASH progression, including liver inflammation and fibrosis. Administering leptin in chow-fed mice caused increased hepatic expression of CD14 via STAT3 signaling, resulting in hyperreactivity against low-dose LPS without steatosis. In contrast, a marked decrease in hepatic CD14 expression was observed in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice, despite severe steatosis. Our results indicate that obesity-induced leptin plays a crucial role in NASH progression via enhanced responsivity to endotoxin, and we propose a mechanism of bacteria-mediated progression of NASH.

Abstract: Summary
Translational control of mRNAs in dendrites is essential for certain forms of synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. CPEB is an RNA-binding protein that regulates local translation in dendrites. Here, we identify poly(A) polymerase Gld2, deadenylase PARN, and translation inhibitory factor neuroguidin (Ngd) as components of a dendritic CPEB-associated polyadenylation apparatus. Synaptic stimulation induces phosphorylation of CPEB, PARN expulsion from the ribonucleoprotein complex, and polyadenylation in dendrites. A screen for mRNAs whose polyadenylation is altered by Gld2 depletion identified >100 transcripts including one encoding NR2A, an NMDA receptor subunit. shRNA depletion studies demonstrate that Gld2 promotes and Ngd inhibits dendritic NR2A expression. Finally, shRNA-mediated depletion of Gld2 in vivo attenuates protein synthesis-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) at hippocampal dentate gyrus synapses; conversely, Ngd depletion enhances LTP. These results identify a pivotal role for polyadenylation and the opposing effects of Gld2 and Ngd in hippocampal synaptic plasticity.

Abstract: Summary
Amino acids stimulate cell growth and suppress autophagy through activation of mTORC1. The activation of mTORC1 by amino acids is mediated by Rag guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) heterodimers on the lysosome. The molecular mechanism by which amino acids regulate the Rag GTPase heterodimers remains to be elucidated. Here, we identify SH3 domain-binding protein 4 (SH3BP4) as a binding protein and a negative regulator of Rag GTPase complex. SH3BP4 binds to the inactive Rag GTPase complex through its Src homology 3 (SH3) domain under conditions of amino acid starvation and inhibits the formation of active Rag GTPase complex. As a consequence, the binding abrogates the interaction of mTORC1 with Rag GTPase complex and the recruitment of mTORC1 to the lysosome, thus inhibiting amino acid-induced mTORC1 activation and cell growth and promoting autophagy. These results demonstrate that SH3BP4 is a negative regulator of the Rag GTPase complex and amino acid-dependent mTORC1 signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding how RNA binding proteins control the splicing code is fundamental to human biology and disease. Here, we present a comprehensive study to elucidate how heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoparticle (hnRNP) proteins, among the most abundant RNA binding proteins, coordinate to regulate alternative pre-mRNA splicing (AS) in human cells. Using splicing-sensitive microarrays, crosslinking and immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-seq), and cDNA sequencing, we find that more than half of all AS events are regulated by multiple hnRNP proteins and that some combinations of hnRNP proteins exhibit significant synergy, whereas others act antagonistically. Our analyses reveal position-dependent RNA splicing maps, in vivo consensus binding sites, a surprising level of cross- and autoregulation among hnRNP proteins, and the coordinated regulation by hnRNP proteins of dozens of other RNA binding proteins and genes associated with cancer. Our findings define an unprecedented degree of complexity and compensatory relationships among hnRNP proteins and their splicing targets that likely confer robustness to cells.

Abstract: Summary
Contraction is a critical phase of immunity whereby the vast majority of effector T cells die by apoptosis, sparing a population of long-lived memory cells. Where, when, and why contraction occurs has been difficult to address directly due in large part to the rapid clearance of apoptotic T cells in vivo. To circumvent this issue, we introduced a genetically encoded reporter for caspase-3 activity into naive T cells to identify cells entering the contraction phase. Using two-photon imaging, we found that caspase-3 activity in T cells was maximal at the peak of the response and was associated with loss of motility followed minutes later by cell death. We demonstrated that contraction is a widespread process occurring uniformly in all organs tested and targeting phenotypically diverse T cells. Importantly, we identified a critical window of time during which antigen encounters act to antagonize T cell apoptosis, supporting a causal link between antigen clearance and T cell contraction. Our results offer insight into a poorly explored phase of immunity and provide a versatile methodology to study apoptosis during the development or function of a variety of immune cells in vivo.

Abstract: A recurrent paradigm in calcium signaling is the coordination of the target response of the calcium signal with activation of metabolic energy production to support that response. This occurs in many tissues, including cardiac and skeletal muscle where contractile activity and ATP production are coordinately regulated by the frequency and amplitude of calcium transients, endocrine and exocrine cells that use calcium to drive the secretory process, and hepatocytes where the downstream targets of calcium include both catabolic and anabolic processes. The primary mechanism by which calcium enhances the capacity for energy production is through calcium-dependent stimulation of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, achieved by increasing NADH production and respiratory chain flux. Although this enhances energy supply, it also has the potential for deleterious consequences resulting from increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The negative consequences of calcium-dependent mitochondrial activation can be ameliorated when the underlying cytosolic calcium signals occur as brief calcium spikes or oscillations, with signal strength encoded through the spike frequency (frequency modulation). Frequency modulation increases signal fidelity, and reduces pathological effects of calcium, including excess mitochondrial ROS production and apoptotic or necrotic outcomes. The present article reviews these issues using data obtained in hepatocytes under physiologic and pathologic conditions.

The objective of this study was to test the ability of the human MSC (hMSC) to deliver the erythropoietin (EPO) gene in a nude mice model following nucleofection using a MIDGE construct. hMSC nucleofected with MIDGE encoding the EPO gene was injected subcutaneously in Matrigel at the dorsal flank of nude mice. Subcutaneous implantation of nucleofected hMSC resulted in increased hemoglobin level with presence of human EPO in the peripheral blood of the injected nude mice in the first two weeks post-implantation compared with the control groups. The basal layer of the hair shaft in the dermal layer was found to be significantly positive for immunohistochemical staining of a human EPO antibody. However, only a few basal layers of the hair shaft were found to be positively stained for CD105. In conclusion, hMSC harboring MIDGE-EPO could deliver and transiently express the EPO gene in the nude mice model. These cells could be localized to the hair follicle and secreted EPO protein might have possible role in hair regeneration.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to identify and quantify the argyrophil, argentaffin and insulin-immunoreactive cells (IIC) in the small intestine of the opossum Didelphis aurita. Seven adult male specimens of opossums were investigated. The animals were captured, and their blood insulin levels were determined. After euthanasia, fragments of the small intestine were processed for light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, and submitted to histochemistry and immunohistochemistry for identification of argyrophil and argentaffin endocrine cells, and IIC. Argyrophil and argentaffin cells were identified in the intestinal villi and Liberkühn crypts, whereas IIC were present exclusively in the crypts. Ultrastructure of the IIC revealed cytoplasmic granules of different sizes and electron densities. The numbers of IIC per mm2 in the duodenum and jejunum were higher than in the ileum (p<0.05). The animals had low levels of blood insulin (2.8±0.78μIU/ml). There was no correlation between insulin levels and the number of IIC in the small intestine. The IIC presented secretory granules, elongated and variable morphology. It is believed that insulin secretion by the IIC may influence the proliferation of cells in the Liberkühn crypts, and local glucose homeostasis, primarily in animals with low serum insulin levels, such as the opossum.

Abstract: Summary
X chromosome inactivation involves multiple levels of chromatin modification, established progressively and in a stepwise manner during early development. The chromosomal protein Smchd1 was recently shown to play an important role in DNA methylation of CpG islands (CGIs), a late step in the X inactivation pathway that is required for long-term maintenance of gene silencing. Here we show that inactive X chromosome (Xi) CGI methylation can occur via either Smchd1-dependent or -independent pathways. Smchd1-dependent CGI methylation, the primary pathway, is acquired gradually over an extended period, whereas Smchd1-independent CGI methylation occurs rapidly after the onset of X inactivation. The de novo methyltransferase Dnmt3b is required for methylation of both classes of CGI, whereas Dnmt3a and Dnmt3L are dispensable. Xi CGIs methylated by these distinct pathways differ with respect to their sequence characteristics and immediate chromosomal environment. We discuss the implications of these results for understanding CGI methylation during development.

Abstract: Summary
The exocyst is a multiprotein complex essential for exocytosis and plasma membrane remodeling. The assembly of the exocyst complex mediates the tethering of post-Golgi secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane prior to fusion. Elucidating the mechanisms regulating exocyst assembly is important for the understanding of exocytosis. Here we show that the exocyst component Exo70 is a direct substrate of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2). ERK1/2 phosphorylation enhances the binding of Exo70 to other exocyst components and promotes the assembly of the exocyst complex in response to epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling. We further demonstrate that ERK1/2 regulates exocytosis, because blocking ERK1/2 signaling by a chemical inhibitor or the expression of an Exo70 mutant defective in ERK1/2 phosphorylation inhibited exocytosis. In tumor cells, blocking Exo70 phosphorylation inhibits matrix metalloproteinase secretion and invadopodia formation. ERK1/2 phosphorylation of Exo70 may thus coordinate exocytosis with other cellular events in response to growth factor signaling.

Abstract: Summary
The emergence and evolutionary expansion of gene families implicated in cancers and other severe genetic diseases is an evolutionary oddity from a natural selection perspective. Here, we show that gene families prone to deleterious mutations in the human genome have been preferentially expanded by the retention of “ohnolog” genes from two rounds of whole-genome duplication (WGD) dating back from the onset of jawed vertebrates. We further demonstrate that the retention of many ohnologs suspected to be dosage balanced is in fact indirectly mediated by their susceptibility to deleterious mutations. This enhanced retention of “dangerous” ohnologs, defined as prone to autosomal-dominant deleterious mutations, is shown to be a consequence of WGD-induced speciation and the ensuing purifying selection in post-WGD species. These findings highlight the importance of WGD-induced nonadaptive selection for the emergence of vertebrate complexity, while rationalizing, from an evolutionary perspective, the expansion of gene families frequently implicated in genetic disorders and cancers.

Doxorubicin Induces the Persistent Activation of Intracellular Transglutaminase 2 That Protects from Cell Death,

Abstract: The activation of transglutaminase 2 (TG2), an enzyme that catalyzes post-translational modifications of proteins, has been implicated in apoptosis, cell adhesion and inflammatory responses. We previously reported that intracellular TG2 is activated under oxidative stress conditions, such as ultraviolet irradiation, ischemia-reperfusion, and hypoxia. In this study, we examined the effect of genotoxic stress on the intracellular activity of TG2 using doxorubicin which generates reactive oxygen species that lead to double-strand breakage of DNA. We demonstrated that doxorubicin elicits the persistent activation of TG2. Doxorubicin-induced TG2 activity was suppressed by treatment with caffeine at the early phase, N-acetylcysteine at the mid-phase, and EGTA at the late phase. However, treatment with a blocking antibody against TGFβ or toll-like receptor 2 showed no effect on TG2 activity, indicating that at least three different signaling pathways may be involved in the process of TG2 activation. In addition, using MEF cells defective for TG2 and cells overexpressing an activesite mutant of TG2, we revealed that doxorubicin-induced cell death is inversely correlated with TG2 activity. Our findings indicate that the persistent activation of TG2 by doxorubicin contributes to cell survival, suggesting that the mechanism-based inhibition of TG2 may be a novel strategy to prevent drug-resistance in doxorubicin treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Coordinated migration and placement of interneurons and projection neurons lead to functional connectivity in the cerebral cortex; defective neuronal migration and the resultant connectivity changes underlie the cognitive defects in a spectrum of neurological disorders. Here we show that primary cilia play a guiding role in the migration and placement of postmitotic interneurons in the developing cerebral cortex and that this process requires the ciliary protein, Arl13b. Through live imaging of interneuronal cilia, we show that migrating interneurons display highly dynamic primary cilia and we correlate cilia dynamics with the interneuron's migratory state. We demonstrate that the guidance cue receptors essential for interneuronal migration localize to interneuronal primary cilia, but their concentration and dynamics are altered in the absence of Arl13b. Expression of Arl13b variants known to cause Joubert syndrome induce defective interneuronal migration, suggesting that defects in cilia-dependent interneuron migration may in part underlie the neurological defects in Joubert syndrome patients.

Abstract: We recently observed that lipoteichoic acid (LTA) isolated from Lactobacillus plantarum inhibited endotoxin-mediated inflammation of the immune cells and septic shock in a mouse model. Here, we examined the inhibitory role of L. plantarum LTA (pLTA) on the inflammatory responses of intestinal epithelial cells (IEC). The human colon cell line, HT-29, increased interleukin (IL)-8 expression in response to recombinant human tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, but not in response to bacterial ligands and interferon (IFN)-gamma. TNF-α also increased the production of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), nitric oxide (NO), and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) through activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) from HT-29 cells. However, the inflammatory response of HT-29 on TNF-α stimulation was significantly inhibited by pLTA treatment. This pLTA-mediated inhibition accompanied the inhibition of nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B and MAPKs. Our data suggest that pLTA regulates cytokine-mediated immune responses and may be a good candidate for maintaining intestinal homeostasis against excessive inflammation.

Abstract: Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease in which both innate and adaptive immunity are involved. Although there have been major advances in the involvement of tolllike receptor 4 (TLR4) and CD36 in the initiation and development of this disease, detailed mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we show that tenascin-C (TN-C) can stimulate foam cell formation and this can be inhibited by a TLR4-blocking antibody or CD36 gene silencing. Our results identify TN-C-TLR4 activation as a common molecular mechanism in oxLDL-stimulated foam cell formation and atherosclerosis. In addition, CD36 is the major scavenger receptor responsible for the TN-C-mediated foam cell formation. Taken together, we have identified that TN-C produced by oxLDL-stimulated macrophages increases foam cell formation through TLR4 and scavenger receptor CD36.

Abstract: Regulated exocytosis, which involves fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane, is an important mode of communication between cells. In this process, signalling molecules that are stored in secretory vesicles are released into the extracellular space. During the initial stage of fusion, the interior of the vesicle is connected to the exterior of the cell with a narrow, channel-like structure: the fusion pore. It was long believed that the fusion pore is a short-lived intermediate state leading irreversibly to fusion pore dilation. However, recent results show that the diameter of the fusion pore can fluctuate, suggesting that the fusion pore is a subject of stabilization. A possible mechanism is addressed in this article, involving the local anisotropicity of membrane constituents that can stabilize the fusion pore. The molecular nature of such a stable fusion pore to predict how interacting molecules (proteins and/or lipids) mediate changes that affect the stability of the fusion pore and exocytosis is also considered. The fusion pore likely attains stability via multiple mechanisms, which include the shape of the lipid and protein membrane constituents and the interactions between them.

Abstract: Overnutrition during pregnancy and lactation lend increasing support to the development of obesity and several chronic diseases in adulthood such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, which leads to beta-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance. In this work, we aimed to study the effects of early life overnutrition on the development of obesity, analyzing the morphological changes, expression of TNF-α, and also the stem cell marker CD133 in the pancreatic islets of young and adult mice. Overnutrition during lactation phase was used as an experimental model to induce obesity. The animals were analyzed at 28 and 150 days of age, when pancreata were collected for histological, ultrastructural and western blotting analysis. The results showed that islet hypertrophy is established in obese groups at day 28 and remained until adulthood. CD133+ cells were observed as small cells within pancreatic islets in both control and obese young mice. However, at day 150, these cells were observed only in the islet peripheries and near ducts of the obese group. Furthermore, TNF-α expression in pancreatic islets was increased in both young and adult obese groups when compared to control groups. This work shows interesting data about CD133 receptor and TNF-α roles in the pancreas during obesity development.

Abstract: Summary
Hsp90 is an essential molecular chaperone in the eukaryotic cytosol. Its function is modulated by cochaperones and posttranslational modifications. Importantly, the phosphatase Ppt1 is a dedicated regulator of the Hsp90 chaperone system. Little is known about Ppt1-dependent phosphorylation sites and how these affect Hsp90 activity. Here, we identified the major phosphorylation sites of yeast Hsp90 in its middle or the C-terminal domain and determined the subset regulated by Ppt1. In general, phosphorylation decelerates the Hsp90 machinery, reduces chaperone function in vivo, sensitizes yeast cells to Hsp90 inhibition and affects DNA repair processes. Modification of one particular site (S485) is lethal, whereas others modulate Hsp90 activity via distinct mechanisms affecting the ATPase activity, cochaperone binding and manipulating conformational transitions in Hsp90. Our mechanistic analysis reveals that phosphorylation of Hsp90 permits a regulation of the conformational cycle at distinct steps by targeting switch points for the communication of remote regions within Hsp90.

Abstract: Summary
The citric acid cycle (CAC) metabolite fumarate has been proposed to be cardioprotective; however, its mechanisms of action remain to be determined. To augment cardiac fumarate levels and to assess fumarate's cardioprotective properties, we generated fumarate hydratase (Fh1) cardiac knockout (KO) mice. These fumarate-replete hearts were robustly protected from ischemia-reperfusion injury (I/R). To compensate for the loss of Fh1 activity, KO hearts maintain ATP levels in part by channeling amino acids into the CAC. In addition, by stabilizing the transcriptional regulator Nrf2, Fh1 KO hearts upregulate protective antioxidant response element genes. Supporting the importance of the latter mechanism, clinically relevant doses of dimethylfumarate upregulated Nrf2 and its target genes, hence protecting control hearts, but failed to similarly protect Nrf2-KO hearts in an in vivo model of myocardial infarction. We propose that clinically established fumarate derivatives activate the Nrf2 pathway and are readily testable cytoprotective agents.

Abstract: Summary
The identity of niche signals necessary to maintain embryonic nephron progenitors is unclear. Here we provide evidence that Fgf20 and Fgf9, expressed in the niche, and Fgf9, secreted from the adjacent ureteric bud, are necessary and sufficient to maintain progenitor stemness. Reduction in the level of these redundant ligands in the mouse led to premature progenitor differentiation within the niche. Loss of FGF20 in humans, or of both ligands in mice, resulted in kidney agenesis. Sufficiency was shown in vitro where Fgf20 or Fgf9 (alone or together with Bmp7) maintained isolated metanephric mesenchyme or sorted nephron progenitors that remained competent to differentiate in response to Wnt signals after 5 or 2 days in culture, respectively. These findings identify a long-sought-after critical component of the nephron stem cell niche and hold promise for long-term culture and utilization of these progenitors in vitro.

Abstract: Indirect findings in the 1950s had indicated that mitochondria could accumulate Ca2+, but only in 1961 isolated mitochondria were directly shown to take it up in a process driven by the activity of the respiratory chain or by the hydrolysis of added ATP. The uptake of Ca2+ could be accompanied by the simultaneous uptake of inorganic phosphate, leading to the precipitation of hydroxyapatite in the matrix and to the effective buffering of the free Ca2+ concentration in it. The uptake of Ca2+ occurred via an electrophoretic uniporter that has been molecularly identified only recently. Ca2+ was then released through a Na+/Ca2+ exchanger that has also been identified very recently (a H+/Ca2+ antiporter has also been described in some mitochondrial types). In the matrix two TCA cycle dehydrogenases and pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphate phosphatase were found to be regulated by Ca2+, providing a rationale for the Ca2+ cycling process. The affinity of the uptake uniporter was found to be too low to efficiently regulate Ca2+ in the low to mid nM concentration in the cytosol. However, a number of findings showed that energy linked transport of Ca2+ did nevertheless occur in mitochondria in situ. The enigma was solved in the 1990s, when it was found that perimitochondrial Ca2+ pools are created by the discharge of Ca2+ from vicinal endoplasmic reticulum stores in which the concentration of Ca2+ is high enough to satisfy the poor affinity of the uniporter. Thus, mitochondria have now regained a key role in the regulation of cytosolic Ca2+ (not only of their own internal Ca2+).

Abstract: Red pepper, Capsicum annuum L., has been attracting geneticists’ and breeders’ attention as one of the important agronomic crops. This study was to integrate 41 SNP markers newly developed from comparative transcriptomes into a previous linkage map, and map 12 agronomic and morphological traits into the integrated map. A total of 39 markers found precise position and were assigned to 13 linkage groups (LGs) as well as the unassigned LGe, leading to total 458 molecular markers present in this genetic map. Linkage mapping was supported by the physical mapping to tomato and potato genomes using BLAST retrieving, revealing at least two-thirds of the markers mapped to the corresponding LGs. A sum of 23 quantitative trait loci from 11 traits was detected using the composite interval mapping algorithm. A consistent interval between a035_1 and a170_1 on LG5 was detected as a main-effect locus among the resistance QTLs to Phytophthora capsici at high-, intermediate- and low-level tests, and interactions between the QTLs for high-level resistance test were found. Considering the epistatic effect, those QTLs could explain up to 98.25% of the phenotype variations of resistance. Moreover, 17 QTLs for another eight traits were found to locate on LG3, 4, and 12 mostly with varying phenotypic contribution. Furthermore, the locus for corolla color was mapped to LG10 as a marker. The integrated map and the QTLs identified would be helpful for current genetics research and crop breeding, especially in the Solanaceae family.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity and atherosclerosis-related diseases account for over one-third of deaths in the western world. Controlling these conditions remains a major challenge due to an incomplete understanding of the molecular pathways involved. Here, we show that Wip1 phosphatase, a known negative regulator of Atm-dependent signaling, plays a major role in controlling fat accumulation and atherosclerosis in mice; specifically, Wip1 deficiency prevents both conditions. In the course of atherosclerosis, deletion of Wip1 results in suppression of macrophage conversion into foam cells, thus preventing the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. This process appears to be independent of p53 but rely on a noncanonical Atm-mTOR signaling pathway and on selective autophagy in regulation of cholesterol efflux. We propose that the Wip1-dependent control of autophagy and cholesterol efflux may provide avenues for treating obesity and atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Summary
Inhibition of VEGF signaling leads to a proinvasive phenotype in mouse models of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and in a subset of GBM patients treated with bevacizumab. Here, we demonstrate that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) directly and negatively regulates tumor cell invasion through enhanced recruitment of the protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) to a MET/VEGFR2 heterocomplex, thereby suppressing HGF-dependent MET phosphorylation and tumor cell migration. Consequently, VEGF blockade restores and increases MET activity in GBM cells in a hypoxia-independent manner, while inducing a program reminiscent of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition highlighted by a T-cadherin to N-cadherin switch and enhanced mesenchymal features. Inhibition of MET in GBM mouse models blocks mesenchymal transition and invasion provoked by VEGF ablation, resulting in substantial survival benefit.

Abstract: Summary
In plants, DNA methylation can be mediated by a class of Argonaute4 (AGO4)-associated heterochromatic siRNAs (hc-siRNAs), through a pathway termed RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). It has been thought that RdDM is solely a nuclear process, as both the biogenesis and functioning of hc-siRNAs take place in the nucleus. In this study, we unexpectedly found that hc-siRNAs are predominantly present in the cytoplasm. We demonstrated that AGO4 is loaded with hc-siRNAs in the cytoplasm and the formation of mature AGO4/siRNA complexes requires HSP90 and the cleavage activity of AGO4. Intriguingly, siRNA binding facilitates the redistribution of AGO4 into the nucleus, likely through inducing conformational change that leads to the exposure of the nuclear localization signal (NLS). Our findings reveal an unsuspected cytoplasmic step in the RdDM pathway. We propose that selective nuclear import of mature AGO4/siRNA complexes is a key regulatory point prior to the effector stage of RdDM.

Abstract: Summary
The synthesis of dTDP is unique because there is a requirement for thymidylate kinase (TMPK). All other dNDPs including dUDP are directly produced by ribonucleotide reductase (RNR). We report the binding of TMPK and RNR at sites of DNA damage. In tumor cells, when TMPK function is blocked, dUTP is incorporated during DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. Disrupting RNR recruitment to damage sites or reducing the expression of the R2 subunit of RNR prevents the impairment of DNA repair by TMPK intervention, indicating that RNR contributes to dUTP incorporation during DSB repair. We identified a cell-permeable nontoxic inhibitor of TMPK that sensitizes tumor cells to doxorubicin in vitro and in vivo, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic option.

Abstract: Summary
In neurons, transmembrane proteins are targeted to dendrites in vesicles that traffic solely within the somatodendritic compartment. How these vesicles are retained within the somatodendritic domain is unknown. Here, we use a novel pulse-chase system, which allows synchronous release of exogenous transmembrane proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to follow movements of post-Golgi transport vesicles. Surprisingly, we found that post-Golgi vesicles carrying dendritic proteins were equally likely to enter axons and dendrites. However, once such vesicles entered the axon, they very rarely moved beyond the axon initial segment but instead either halted or reversed direction in an actin and Myosin Va-dependent manner. In contrast, vesicles carrying either an axonal or a nonspecifically localized protein only rarely halted or reversed and instead generally proceeded to the distal axon. Thus, our results are consistent with the axon initial segment behaving as a vesicle filter that mediates the differential trafficking of transport vesicles.

Abstract: Summary
PhoP and PhoQ comprise a two-component system in the bacterium Salmonella enterica. PhoQ is the sensor kinase/phosphatase that modifies the phosphorylation state of the regulator PhoP in response to stimuli. The amount of phosphorylated PhoP surges after activation, then declines to reach a steady-state level. We now recapitulate this surge in vitro by incubating PhoP and PhoQ with ATP and ADP. Mathematical modeling identified PhoQ's affinity for ADP as the key parameter dictating phosphorylated PhoP levels, as ADP promotes PhoQ's phosphatase activity toward phosphorylated PhoP. The lid covering the nucleotide-binding pocket of PhoQ governs the kinase to phosphatase switch because a lid mutation that decreased ADP binding compromised PhoQ's phosphatase activity in vitro and resulted in sustained expression of PhoP-dependent mRNAs in vivo. This feedback mechanism may curtail futile ATP consumption because ADP not only stimulates PhoQ's phosphatase activity but also inhibits ATP binding necessary for the kinase reaction.

Abstract: Summary
After implantation, pluripotent epiblasts are converted to embryonic ectoderm through cell–cell interactions that significantly change the transcriptional and epigenetic networks. An entrée to understanding this vital developmental transition is the tw5 mutation of the mouse t complex. This mutation produces highly specific defects in the embryonic ectoderm before gastrulation, leading to death of the embryonic ectoderm. Using a positional cloning approach, we have now identified the mutated gene, completing a decades-long search. The gene, vacuolar protein sorting 52 (Vps52), is a mouse homolog of yeast VPS52 that is involved in the retrograde trafficking of endosomes. Our data suggest that Vps52 acts in extraembryonic tissues to support the growth and differentiation of embryonic ectoderm via cell–cell interactions. It is also required in the formation of embryonic structures at a later stage of development, revealing hitherto unknown functions of Vps52 in the development of a multicellular organism.

Abstract: Summary
Clathrin and the epithelial-specific clathrin adaptor AP-1B mediate basolateral trafficking in epithelia. However, several epithelia lack AP-1B, and mice knocked out for AP-1B are viable, suggesting the existence of additional mechanisms that control basolateral polarity. Here, we demonstrate a distinct role of the ubiquitous clathrin adaptor AP-1A in basolateral protein sorting. Knockdown of AP-1A causes missorting of basolateral proteins in MDCK cells, but only after knockdown of AP-1B, suggesting that AP-1B can compensate for lack of AP-1A. AP-1A localizes predominantly to the TGN, and its knockdown promotes spillover of basolateral proteins into common recycling endosomes, the site of function of AP-1B, suggesting complementary roles of both adaptors in basolateral sorting. Yeast two-hybrid assays detect interactions between the basolateral signal of transferrin receptor and the medium subunits of both AP-1A and AP-1B. The basolateral sorting function of AP-1A reported here establishes AP-1 as a major regulator of epithelial polarity.

Abstract: Characterization of mucins in the alimentary tract of the grass snake, Natrix natrix was performed by histochemical (PAS, Alcian Blue, pH 2.5 and pH 1.0, sialidase-Alcian Blue, pH 2.5, HID-AB pH 2.5) and lectin-histochemical (WGA, SWGA, PNA, sialidase-PNA, SBA, sialidase-SBA, DBA, sialidase-DBA, ConA, BSI-B4, AAA, UEA-1, LTA) techniques. Oesophageal lining epithelium consisted of ciliated and goblet cells, with no pluricellular glands. Mannosylated sialosulfomucins were observed. Fundic mucosa of stomach presented surface cells producing sialomucins with terminal sialic acid linked to galactose. In gastric glands neck and oxynticopeptic cells were found. Neck cells had sialomucins with mannose, N-acetylglucosamine, galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine and fucose-α-(1,2)-linked residues. Cytoplasm of oxynticopeptic cells showed N-acetylgalactosamine and fucose residues. Secretion of surface cells in pyloric mucosa was similar to that of fundic ones, differing in having fucose. Goblet cells in the small intestine of N. natrix produced sulfo- and sialomucins, with sialic acid linked to galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine residues. Mucins also presented residues of mannose. Goblet cells in the large intestine presented sulfomucins only, with terminal N-acetylgalactosamine, galactose and N-acetylglucosamine. The glycosylation patterns found are probably related to protection against injuries, gastric juice and microorganisms, both pathogenic and decomposers, as well as to dietary adaptations.

Abstract: Summary
Several lines of evidence suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of microvascular complications of diabetes, including diabetic nephropathy. However, the signaling pathways by which hyperglycemia leads to mitochondrial dysfunction are not fully understood. Here we examined the role of Rho-associated coiled coil-containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK1) on mitochondrial dynamics by generating two diabetic mouse models with targeted deletions of ROCK1 and an inducible podocyte-specific knockin mouse expressing a constitutively active (cA) mutant of ROCK1. Our findings suggest that ROCK1 mediates hyperglycemia-induced mitochondrial fission by promoting dynamin-related protein-1 (Drp1) recruitment to the mitochondria. Deletion of ROCK1 in diabetic mice prevented mitochondrial fission, whereas podocyte-specific cA-ROCK1 mice exhibited increased mitochondrial fission. Importantly, we found that ROCK1 triggers mitochondrial fission by phosphorylating Drp1 at serine 600 residue. These findings provide insights into the unexpected role of ROCK1 in a signaling cascade that regulates mitochondrial dynamics.

Abstract: Summary
Close to 50 genetic loci have been associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D), but they explain only 15% of the heritability. In an attempt to identify additional T2D genes, we analyzed global gene expression in human islets from 63 donors. Using 48 genes located near T2D risk variants, we identified gene coexpression and protein-protein interaction networks that were strongly associated with islet insulin secretion and HbA1c. We integrated our data to form a rank list of putative T2D genes, of which CHL1, LRFN2, RASGRP1, and PPM1K were validated in INS-1 cells to influence insulin secretion, whereas GPR120 affected apoptosis in islets. Expression variation of the top 20 genes explained 24% of the variance in HbA1c with no claim of the direction. The data present a global map of genes associated with islet dysfunction and demonstrate the value of systems genetics for the identification of genes potentially involved in T2D.

Abstract: Summary
The type II cell of the pulmonary alveolus is a polarized epithelial cell that secretes surfactant into the alveolar space by regulated exocytosis of lamellar bodies (LBs). This process consists of multiple sequential steps and is correlated to elevations of the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c) required for extended periods of secretory activity. Both chemical (purinergic) and mechanical (cell stretch or exposure to an air–liquid interface) stimuli give rise to complex Ca2+ signals (such as Ca2+ peaks, spikes and plateaus) that differ in shape, origin and spatio-temporal behavior. This review summarizes current knowledge about Ca2+ channels, including vesicular P2X4 purinoceptors, in type II cells and associated signaling cascades within the alveolar microenvironment, and relates stimulus-dependent activation of these pathways with distinct stages of surfactant secretion, including pre- and postfusion stages of LB exocytosis.

Abstract: Summary
The nuclear matrix-associated hnRNP U/SAF-A protein has been implicated in diverse pathways from transcriptional regulation to telomere length control to X inactivation, but the precise mechanism underlying each of these processes has remained elusive. Here, we report hnRNP U as a regulator of SMN2 splicing from a custom RNAi screen. Genome-wide analysis by CLIP-seq reveals that hnRNP U binds virtually to all classes of regulatory noncoding RNAs, including all snRNAs required for splicing of both major and minor classes of introns, leading to the discovery that hnRNP U regulates U2 snRNP maturation and Cajal body morphology in the nucleus. Global analysis of hnRNP U-dependent splicing by RNA-seq coupled with bioinformatic analysis of associated splicing signals suggests a general rule for splice site selection through modulating the core splicing machinery. These findings exemplify hnRNP U/SAF-A as a potent regulator of nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles in diverse gene expression pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors constitute a first line of defense against invading bacteria. X-linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis (XIAP) is implicated in the control of bacterial infections, and mutations in XIAP are causally linked to immunodeficiency in X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome type-2 (XLP-2). Here, we demonstrate that the RING domain of XIAP is essential for NOD2 signaling and that XIAP contributes to exacerbation of inflammation-induced hepatitis in experimental mice. We find that XIAP ubiquitylates RIPK2 and recruits the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) to NOD2. We further show that LUBAC activity is required for efficient NF-κB activation and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines after NOD2 stimulation. Remarkably, XLP-2-derived XIAP variants have impaired ubiquitin ligase activity, fail to ubiquitylate RIPK2, and cannot facilitate NOD2 signaling. We conclude that XIAP and LUBAC constitute essential ubiquitin ligases in NOD2-mediated inflammatory signaling and propose that deregulation of NOD2 signaling contributes to XLP-2 pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer cells typically exhibit aberrant DNA methylation patterns that can drive malignant transformation. Whether cancer cells are dependent on these abnormal epigenetic modifications remains elusive. We used experimental and bioinformatic approaches to unveil genomic regions that require DNA methylation for survival of cancer cells. First, we surveyed the residual DNA methylation profiles in cancer cells with highly impaired DNA methyltransferases. Then, we clustered these profiles according to their DNA methylation status in primary normal and tumor tissues. Finally, we used gene expression meta-analysis to identify regions that are dependent on DNA methylation-mediated gene silencing. We further showed experimentally that these genes must be silenced by DNA methylation for cancer cell survival, suggesting these are key epigenetic events associated with tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The prokaryotic CRISPR/Cas immune system is based on genomic loci that contain incorporated sequence tags from viruses and plasmids. Using small guide RNA molecules, these sequences act as a memory to reject returning invaders. Both the Cascade ribonucleoprotein complex and the Cas3 nuclease/helicase are required for CRISPR interference in Escherichia coli, but it is unknown how natural target DNA molecules are recognized and neutralized by their combined action. Here we show that Cascade efficiently locates target sequences in negatively supercoiled DNA, but only if these are flanked by a protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM). PAM recognition by Cascade exclusively involves the crRNA-complementary DNA strand. After Cascade-mediated R loop formation, the Cse1 subunit recruits Cas3, which catalyzes nicking of target DNA through its HD-nuclease domain. The target is then progressively unwound and cleaved by the joint ATP-dependent helicase activity and Mg2+-dependent HD-nuclease activity of Cas3, leading to complete target DNA degradation and invader neutralization.

Abstract: Summary
GATA transcription factors regulate transcription during development and differentiation by recognizing distinct GATA sites with a tandem of two conserved zinc fingers, and by mediating long-range DNA looping. However, the molecular basis of these processes is not well understood. Here, we determined three crystal structures of the full DNA-binding domain (DBD) of human GATA3 protein, which contains both zinc fingers, in complex with different DNA sites. In one structure, both zinc fingers wrap around a palindromic GATA site, cooperatively enhancing the binding affinity and kinetic stability. Strikingly, in the other two structures, the two fingers of GATA DBD bind GATA sites on different DNA molecules, thereby bridging two separate DNA fragments. This was confirmed in solution by an in-gel fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis. These findings not only provide insights into the structure and function of GATA proteins but also shed light on the molecular basis of long-range gene regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Infection leads to heightened activation of natural killer (NK) cells, a process that likely involves direct cell-to-cell contact, but how this occurs in vivo is poorly understood. We have used two-photon laser-scanning microscopy in conjunction with Toxoplasma gondii mouse infection models to address this question. We found that after infection, NK cells accumulated in the subcapsular region of the lymph node, where they formed low-motility contacts with collagen fibers and CD169+ macrophages. We provide evidence that interactions with collagen regulate NK cell migration, whereas CD169+ macrophages increase the activation state of NK cells. Interestingly, a subset of CD169+ macrophages that coexpress the inflammatory monocyte marker Ly6C had the most potent ability to activate NK cells. Our data reveal pathways through which NK cell migration and function are regulated after infection and identify an important accessory cell population for activation of NK cell responses in lymph nodes.

Abstract: Summary
The development of a complex organ requires the specification of appropriate numbers of each of its constituent cell types, as well as their proper differentiation and correct positioning relative to each other. During Drosophila cardiogenesis, all three of these processes are controlled by jumeau (jumu) and Checkpoint suppressor homologue (CHES-1-like), two genes encoding forkhead transcription factors that we discovered utilizing an integrated genetic, genomic, and computational strategy for identifying genes expressed in the developing Drosophila heart. Both jumu and CHES-1-like are required during asymmetric cell division for the derivation of two distinct cardiac cell types from their mutual precursor and in symmetric cell divisions that produce yet a third type of heart cell. jumu and CHES-1-like control the division of cardiac progenitors by regulating the activity of Polo, a kinase involved in multiple steps of mitosis. This pathway demonstrates how transcription factors integrate diverse developmental processes during organogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) is a central kinase that coordinates nutrient availability with eukaryotic cell growth. Although TORC1 signaling is repressed by various stresses in yeast, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here we report that TORC1 signaling upon heat stress is regulated by stress granules (SGs), which are cytoplasmic foci formed under certain stresses. Ectopic formation of SGs achieved by Pbp1 overexpression in unstressed cells sequesters TORC1 in this compartment, thereby blunting TORC1 signaling. Upon heat stress, a physiological SG-inducing condition, TORC1 is also recruited to SGs, which delays reactivation of TORC1 signaling during recovery from heat stress. Moreover, TORC1 reactivation is directed through SG disassembly, suggesting that SGs act as a key determinant for TORC1 reactivation during recovery from heat stress. Furthermore, this mechanism contributes to reduction of heat-induced mutations. Thus, TORC1 signaling is coupled to heat-induced SGs to protect cells from DNA damage.

Abstract: Summary
The graded Hedgehog (Hh) signal is transduced by the transmembrane Smoothened (Smo) proteins in both vertebrates and invertebrates. In Drosophila, associations between Smo and the Fused (Fu)/Costal-2 (Cos2)/Cubitus Interruptus (Ci) cytoplasmic complex lead to pathway activation, but it remains unclear how the cytoplasmic complex responds to and transduces different levels of Hh signaling. We show here that, within the Hh gradient field, low- and high-magnitude Smo activations control differentially the phosphorylation of Cos2 on two distinct serines. We also provide evidence that these phosphorylations depend on the Fu kinase activity and lead to a shift of Cos2 distribution from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane. Moreover, the distinct Cos2 phosphorylation states mediate differential Hh signaling magnitude, suggesting that phosphorylation and relocation of Cos2 to the plasma membrane facilitate high-level Hh signaling through the control of Ci nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity.

mRNAs encoding polarity and secretion factors (POLs) target the incipient bud site in yeast for localized translation during division. In pheromone-treated cells we now find that these mRNAs are also localized to the yeast-mating projection (shmoo) tip. However, in contrast to the budding program, neither the She2 nor She3 proteins are involved. Instead, the Scp160 RNA-binding protein binds POL and mating pathway mRNAs and regulates their spatial distribution in a Myo4- and cortical ER-dependent fashion. RNA binding by Scp160 is stimulated by activation of Gpa1, the G protein α subunit regulated by the pheromone receptor, and is required for pheromone gradient sensing, as well as subsequent chemotropic growth and cell-cell mating. These effects are incurred independently of obvious changes in translation; thus, mRNA trafficking is required for chemotropism and completion of the mating program. This is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of ligand-activated RNA targeting in the development of a simple eukaryote.

Abstract: The aim of this study is to compare the gross morphology of the placentae and the morphometry of terminal villi and terminal villous capillaries in pregnancies complicated by idiopathic intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) with those of normal pregnancies. 75 placentae were collected between April 2010 and March 2011. 50 placentae were associated with idiopathic IUGR and 25 were from controls. Insertion of cords, placental weights and diameters were noted. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained wax sections were analyzed stereologically. Growth of terminal villi and fetal capillaries was assessed by estimating total and mean surface areas. Villous capillarization was monitored using capillary:villus surface ratio. Measurements were done using image analysis system. In comparison with the control group, idiopathic IUGR placentae are significantly smaller (p=0.000) and lighter (p=0.000). In majority of IUGR (68%) and control (60%) cases, eccentric insertion of cord is noted. In idiopathic IUGR group, there is a significant decrease in the total areas of both terminal villi (p=0.048) and their capillaries (p=0.000) and a significant decrease in number of both terminal villi (p=0.000) and their capillaries (p=0.001), also, capillarization index is significantly smaller (p=0.038). Idiopathic IUGR is associated with reduced growth of placental terminal villi and fetal capillaries and this is accompanied by changes in measures of villous capillarization as compared with those of control placentae. Further investigations of idiopathic IUGR placentae are necessary, especially considering the histopathological changes that could affect the fetomaternal exchange, with a note that strict distinction should be made between idiopathic and nonidiopathic IUGR placentae.

Abstract: Summary
Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in insulin-resistant (type 2) diabetes. Vascular endothelial dysfunction paves the way for atherosclerosis through impaired nitric oxide availability, inflammation, and generation of superoxide. Surprisingly, we show that ablation of the three genes encoding isoforms of transcription factor FoxO in endothelial cells prevents atherosclerosis in low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout mice by reversing these subphenotypes. Paradoxically, the atheroprotective effect of FoxO deletion is associated with a marked decrease of insulin-dependent Akt phosphorylation in endothelial cells, owing to reduced FoxO-dependent expression of the insulin receptor adaptor proteins Irs1 and Irs2. These findings support a model in which FoxO is the shared effector of multiple atherogenic pathways in endothelial cells. FoxO ablation lowers the threshold of Akt activity required for protection from atherosclerosis. The data demonstrate that FoxO inhibition in endothelial cells has the potential to mediate wide-ranging therapeutic benefits for diabetes-associated cardiovascular disease.

Abstract: The present ultrastructural immunocytochemical study analyzes the localization of keratin-associated beta-proteins (beta-keratins) in the epidermis of the ancient reptile Sphenodon punctatus, a relict species adapted to mid-cold conditions. The epidermis comprises two main layers, indicated as beta- and alpha-keratin layers. The beta-layer contains small beta-proteins (beta-keratins) identified by using three different antibodies while the alpha-layer is poorly or not labeled for these proteins. Using other two antibodies directed against specific amino acid sequences identified in beta-proteins of lizard it results that a high-glycine beta-protein (HgG5) is specific for the beta-layer. Another antibody that recognizes glycine–cysteine medium-rich beta-proteins (HgGC10) immuno-stains beta- and alpha-layers. This pattern of distribution suggests that both beta- and alpha-layers contain beta-proteins of different types that associate and replace intermediate-filament alpha-keratins during the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes. Therefore the different epidermal layers of the epidermis in S. punctatus, characterized by a specific cytology, material properties and consistency appear to derive from the prevalent type of beta-proteins synthesized in each epidermal layer and not from the alternation between beta- and alpha-keratins. The present observations are discussed in comparison to previous results from lizard epidermis and indicate that beta-keratins correspond to keratin-associated proteins that through their internal beta-pleated region are capable to form filaments in addition to intermediate filaments keratins.

Abstract: Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) functions as a ubiquitous intracellular messenger besides as an oxidative stress molecule. This dual role is based on the distinct cellular responses against different concentrations of H2O2. Previously, we demonstrated that both low (> 1 mM) and high (4-10 mM) doses of exogenous H2O2 induce filamentous growth with distinct cell morphology and growth rate in Candida albicans, suggesting the different transcription response. In this study, we revealed that the sub-toxic and toxic levels of H2O2 indeed induced pseudohyphae, but not true hyphae. Supporting this, several hyphae-specific genes that are expressed in true hyphae induced by serum were not detected in either sub-toxic or toxic H2O2 condition. A DNA microarray analysis was conducted to reveal the transcription profiles in cells treated with sub-toxic and toxic conditions of H2O2. Under the sub-toxic condition, a small number of genes involved in cell proliferation and metabolism were up-regulated, whereas a large number of genes were up-regulated in the toxic condition where the genes required for growth and proliferation were selectively restricted. For pseudohyphal induction by sub-toxic H2O2, Cek1 MAPK activating the transcription factor Cph1 was shown to be important. The absence of expression of several hyphae-specific genes known to be downstream targets of Cph1-signaling pathway for true hyphae formation suggests that the Cek1-mediated signaling pathway is not solely responsible for pseudohyphal formation by subtoxic H2O2 and, but instead, complex networking pathway may exists by the activation of different regulators.

Abstract: Summary
In the cytoplasm, the correct delivery of membrane proteins is an essential and highly regulated process. The posttranslational targeting of the important tail-anchor membrane (TA) proteins has recently been under intense investigation. A specialized pathway, called the guided entry of TA proteins (GET) pathway in yeast and the transmembrane domain recognition complex (TRC) pathway in vertebrates, recognizes endoplasmic-reticulum-targeted TA proteins and delivers them through a complex series of handoffs. An early step is the formation of a complex between Sgt2/SGTA, a cochaperone with a presumed ubiquitin-like-binding domain (UBD), and Get5/UBL4A, a ubiquitin-like domain (UBL)-containing protein. We structurally characterize this UBD/UBL interaction for both yeast and human proteins. This characterization is supported by biophysical studies that demonstrate that complex formation is mediated by electrostatics, generating an interface that has high-affinity with rapid kinetics. In total, this work provides a refined model of the interplay of Sgt2 homologs in TA targeting.

Abstract: Summary
The endocannabinoid system plays a critical role in the control of energy homeostasis, but the identity and localization of the endocannabinoid signal involved remain unknown. In the present study, we developed transgenic mice that overexpress in forebrain neurons the presynaptic hydrolase, monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL), which deactivates the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol (2-AG). MGL-overexpressing mice show a 50% decrease in forebrain 2-AG levels but no overt compensation in other endocannabinoid components. This biochemical abnormality is accompanied by a series of metabolic changes that include leanness, elevated energy cost of activity, and hypersensitivity to β3-adrenergic-stimulated thermogenesis, which is corrected by reinstating 2-AG activity at CB1-cannabinoid receptors. Additionally, the mutant mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity and express high levels of thermogenic proteins, such as uncoupling protein 1, in their brown adipose tissue. The results suggest that 2-AG signaling through CB1 regulates the activity of forebrain neural circuits involved in the control of energy dissipation.

Abstract: Summary
Pre-mRNA splicing is regulated by developmental and environmental cues, but little is known about how specific signals are transduced in mammalian cells to regulate this critical gene expression step. Here, we report massive reprogramming of alternative splicing in response to EGF signaling. By blocking individual branches in EGF signaling, we found that Akt activation plays a major role, while other branches, such as the JAK/STAT and ERK pathways, make minor contributions to EGF-induced splicing. Activated Akt next branches to SR protein-specific kinases, rather than mTOR, by inducing SRPK autophosphorylation that switches the splicing kinases from Hsp70- to Hsp90-containing complexes. This leads to enhanced SRPK nuclear translocation and SR protein phosphorylation. These findings reveal a major signal transduction pathway for regulated splicing and place SRPKs in a central position in the pathway, consistent with their reputed roles in a large number of human cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Alternative inclusion of exons increases the functional diversity of proteins. Among alternatively spliced exons, tissue-specific exons play a critical role in maintaining tissue identity. This raises the question of how tissue-specific protein-coding exons influence protein function. Here we investigate the structural, functional, interaction, and evolutionary properties of constitutive, tissue-specific, and other alternative exons in human. We find that tissue-specific protein segments often contain disordered regions, are enriched in posttranslational modification sites, and frequently embed conserved binding motifs. Furthermore, genes containing tissue-specific exons tend to occupy central positions in interaction networks and display distinct interaction partners in the respective tissues, and are enriched in signaling, development, and disease genes. Based on these findings, we propose that tissue-specific inclusion of disordered segments that contain binding motifs rewires interaction networks and signaling pathways. In this way, tissue-specific splicing may contribute to functional versatility of proteins and increases the diversity of interaction networks across tissues.

Abstract: Summary
The terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, cytochrome oxidase, transfers electrons to molecular oxygen, generating water. Within the inner mitochondrial membrane, cytochrome oxidase assembles into supercomplexes, together with other respiratory chain complexes, forming so-called respirasomes. Little is known about how these higher oligomeric structures are attained. Here we report on Rcf1 and Rcf2 as cytochrome oxidase subunits in S. cerevisiae. While Rcf2 is specific to yeast, Rcf1 is a conserved subunit with two human orthologs, RCF1a and RCF1b. Rcf1 is required for growth in hypoxia and complex assembly of subunits Cox13 and Rcf2, as well as for the oligomerization of a subclass of cytochrome oxidase complexes into respirasomes. Our analyses reveal that the cytochrome oxidase of mitochondria displays intrinsic heterogeneity with regard to its subunit composition and that distinct forms of respirasomes can be formed by complex variants.

Abstract: Summary
Nucleotide excision repair factors, initially characterized as part of DNA repair, have been shown to participate in the transcriptional process in the absence of genotoxic attack. However, their molecular function when recruited at the promoters of activated genes together with the transcription machinery remained obscure. Here we show that the NER factors XPG and XPF are essential for establishing CTCF-dependent chromatin looping between the promoter and terminator of the activated RARβ2 gene. Silencing XPG and/or XPF endonucleases, or mutations in their catalytic sites, prevents CTCF recruitment, chromatin loop formation, and optimal transcription of RARβ2. We demonstrated that XPG endonuclease promotes DNA breaks and DNA demethylation at promoters allowing the recruitment of CTCF and gene looping, which is further stabilized by XPF. Our results highlight a timely orchestrated activity of the NER factors XPG and XPF in the formation of the active chromatin hub that controls gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
Nascent secretory proteins are extensively scrutinized at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Various signatures of client proteins, including exposure of hydrophobic patches or unpaired sulfhydryls, are coordinately utilized to reduce nonnative proteins in the ER. We report here the cryptic N-glycosylation site as a recognition signal for unfolding of a natively nonglycosylated protein, transthyretin (TTR), involved in familial amyloidosis. Folding and ER-associated degradation (ERAD) perturbation analyses revealed that prolonged TTR unfolding induces externalization of cryptic N-glycosylation site and triggers STT3B-dependent posttranslational N-glycosylation. Inhibition of posttranslational N-glycosylation increases detergent-insoluble TTR aggregates and decreases cell proliferation of mutant TTR-expressing cells. Moreover, this modification provides an alternative pathway for degradation, which is EDEM3-mediated N-glycan-dependent ERAD, distinct from the major pathway of Herp-mediated N-glycan-independent ERAD. Hence we postulate that STT3B-dependent posttranslational N-glycosylation is part of a triage-salvage system recognizing cryptic N-glycosylation sites of secretory proteins to preserve protein homeostasis.

Abstract: Betulinic acid (BetA) is an effective and potential anticancer chemical derived from plants. BetA can kill a broad range of tumor cell lines, but has no effect on untransformed cells. The chemical also kills melanoma, leukemia, lung, colon, breast, prostate and ovarian cancer cells via induction of apoptosis, which depends on caspase activation. However, no reports are yet available about the effects of BetA on nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), a widely spread malignancy in the world, especially in East Asia. In this study, we first showed that BetA can effectively kill CNE2 cells, a cell line derived from NPC. BetAinduced CNE2 apoptosis was characterized by typical apoptosis hallmarks: caspase activation, DNA fragmentation, and cytochrome c release. Overexpression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL could partially prevent apoptosis caused by BetA. Moreover, Bax was not activated during the induction of apoptosis. Bax/Bak knockdown and wild-type CNE2 cells showed the same kinetics of cytochrome c release. We then showed that BetA may impair mitochondrial permeability transition pores (mPTPs), which may partially contribute to cytochrome c release. These observations suggest that BetA may serve as a potent and effective anticancer agent in NPC treatment. Further exploration of the mechanism of action of BetA could yield novel breakthroughs in anti-cancer drug discovery.

Abstract: Summary
Elevated Aurora kinase-A expression is correlated with abrogation of DNA damage-induced apoptotic response and mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) override in human tumor cells. We report that Aurora-A phosphorylation of p73 at serine235 abrogates its transactivation function and causes cytoplasmic sequestration in a complex with the chaperon protein mortalin. Aurora-A phosphorylated p73 also facilitates inactivation of SAC through dissociation of the MAD2-CDC20 complex in cells undergoing mitosis. Cells expressing phosphor-mimetic mutant (S235D) of p73 manifest altered growth properties, resistance to cisplatin- induced apoptosis, as well as premature dissociation of the MAD2-CDC20 complex, and accelerated mitotic exit with SAC override in the presence of spindle damage. Elevated cytoplasmic p73 in Aurora-A overexpressing primary human tumors corroborates the experimental findings.

Abstract: Constitutive overexpression of transgenes occasionally interferes with normal growth and developmental processes in plants. Thus, the development of tissue-specific promoters that drive transgene expression has become agriculturally important. To identify tomato tissue-specific promoters, tissue-specific genes were screened using a series of in silico-based and experimental procedures, including genome-wide orthologue searches of tomato and Arabidopsis databases, isolation of tissue-specific candidates using an Arabidopsis microarray database, and validation of tissue specificity by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis and promoter assay. Using these procedures, we found 311 tissue-specific candidate genes and validated 10 tissuespecific genes by RT-PCR. Among these identified genes, histochemical analysis of five isolated promoter::GUS transgenic tomato and Arabidopsis plants revealed that their promoters have different but distinct tissue-specific activities in anther, fruit, and root, respectively. Therefore, it appears these in silico-based screening approaches in addition to the identification of new tissue-specific genes and promoters will be helpful for the further development of tailored crop development.

Abstract: The role of Arabidopsis S6 Kinase 1 (AtS6KI), a downstream target of TOR kinase, in controlling plant growth and ribosome biogenesis was characterized after generating transgenic plants expressing AtS6K1 under auxininducible promoter. Down-regulation of selected cell cycle regulatory genes upon auxin treatment was observed in the transgenic plants, confirming the negative regulatory role of AtS6K1 in the plant cell cycle progression reported earlier. Callus tissues established from these transgenic plants grew to larger cell masses with more number of enlarged cells than untransformed control, demonstrating functional implication of AtS6K1 in the control of plant cell size. The observed negative correlation between the expression of AtS6K1 and the cell cycle regulatory genes, however, was completely reversed in protoplasts generated from the transgenic plants expressing AtS6K1, suggesting a possible existence of dual regulatory mechanism of the plant cell cycle regulation mediated by AtS6K1. An alternative method of kinase assay, termed “substrate-mediated kinase pull down”, was employed to examine the additional phosphorylation on other domains of AtS6K1 and verified the phosphorylation of both amino-and carboxy-terminal domains, which is a novel finding regarding the phosphorylation target sites on plant S6Ks by upstream regulatory kinases. In addition, this kinase assay under the stress conditions revealed the salt- and sugardependencies of AtS6K1 phosphorylations.

Abstract: Summary
We have explored the role of mitochondrial function in aging by genetically and pharmacologically modifying yeast cellular respiration production during the exponential and/or stationary growth phases and determining how this affects chronological life span (CLS). Our results demonstrate that respiration is essential during both growth phases for standard CLS, but that yeast have a large respiratory capacity, and only deficiencies below a threshold (∼40% of wild-type) significantly curtail CLS. Extension of CLS by caloric restriction also required respiration above a similar threshold during exponential growth and completely alleviated the need for respiration in the stationary phase. Finally, we show that supplementation of media with 1% trehalose, a storage carbohydrate, restores wild-type CLS to respiratory-null cells. We conclude that mitochondrial respiratory thresholds regulate yeast CLS and its extension by caloric restriction by increasing stress resistance, an important component of which is the optimal accumulation and mobilization of nutrient stores.

ATP4a Is Required for Wnt-Dependent Foxj1 Expression and Leftward Flow in Xenopus Left-Right Development,

Abstract: Summary
Most vertebrate embryos break symmetry by a cilia-driven leftward flow during neurulation. In the frog Xenopus asymmetric expression of the ion pump ATP4a was reported at the 4-cell stage. The “ion-flux” model postulates that symmetry is broken flow-independently through an ATP4-generated asymmetric voltage gradient that drives serotonin through gap junctions to one side of the embryo. Here, we show that ATP4a is symmetrically expressed. Gene knockdown or pharmacological inhibition compromised organ situs, asymmetric marker gene expression, and leftward flow. The gastrocoel roof plate (GRP), where flow in frog occurs, revealed fewer, shortened, and misaligned cilia. Foxj1, a master control gene of motile cilia, was downregulated in the superficial mesoderm, from which the GRP develops. Specifically, ATP4 was required for Wnt/β-catenin-regulated Foxj1 induction and Wnt/PCP-dependent cilia polarization. Our work argues for evolutionary conservation of symmetry breakage in the vertebrates.

Abstract: Summary
MCL1, which encodes the antiapoptotic protein MCL1, is among the most frequently amplified genes in human cancer. A chemical genomic screen identified compounds, including anthracyclines, that decreased MCL1 expression. Genomic profiling indicated that these compounds were global transcriptional repressors that preferentially affect MCL1 due to its short mRNA half-life. Transcriptional repressors and MCL1 shRNAs induced apoptosis in the same cancer cell lines and could be rescued by physiological levels of ectopic MCL1 expression. Repression of MCL1 released the proapoptotic protein BAK from MCL1, and Bak deficiency conferred resistance to transcriptional repressors. A computational model, validated in vivo, indicated that high BCL-xL expression confers resistance to MCL1 repression, thereby identifying a patient-selection strategy for the clinical development of MCL1 inhibitors.

Abstract: Summary
Patterning of the dorsal-ventral axis in the early Drosophila embryo depends on the nuclear distribution of the Dorsal transcription factor. Using live two-photon light-sheet microscopy, we quantified the nuclear Dorsal gradient in space and time and found that its amplitude and basal levels display oscillations throughout early embryonic development. These dynamics raise questions regarding how cells can reproducibly establish patterns of gene expression from a rapidly varying signal. We therefore quantified domains of Dorsal target genes, discovering their expression patterns are also dynamic. Computational modeling of this system reveals a correlation between Dorsal gradient dynamics and changes in target gene expression and suggests that these dynamics, together with time averaging of noise, results in the formation of graded gene expression borders in regions where the gradient is nearly flat. We propose that mRNA levels remain plastic during transient signaling events, allowing tissues to refine patterns in the face of genetic or environmental variation.

Abstract: Summary
Numerous studies in humans link a nonsynonymous genetic polymorphism (I148M) in adiponutrin (ADPN) to various forms of fatty liver disease and liver cirrhosis. Despite its high clinical relevance, the molecular function of ADPN and the mechanism by which I148M variant affects hepatic metabolism are unclear. Here we show that ADPN promotes cellular lipid synthesis by converting lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) into phosphatidic acid. The ADPN-catalyzed LPA acyltransferase (LPAAT) reaction is specific for LPA and long-chain acyl-CoAs. Wild-type mice receiving a high-sucrose diet exhibit substantial upregulation of Adpn in the liver and a concomitant increase in LPAAT activity. In Adpn-deficient mice, this diet-induced increase in hepatic LPAAT activity is reduced. Notably, the I148M variant of human ADPN exhibits increased LPAAT activity leading to increased cellular lipid accumulation. This gain of function provides a plausible biochemical mechanism for the development of liver steatosis in subjects carrying the I148M variant.

Abstract: The remarkable recent discoveries of the proteins mediating mitochondrial Ca2+ transport (reviewed in this issue) provide an exciting opportunity to utilise this new knowledge to improve our fundamental understanding of relationships between Ca2+ signalling and bioenergetics and, importantly, to improve the understanding of diseases in which Ca2+ toxicity and mitochondrial malfunction play a crucial role. Ca2+ is an important activator of exocrine secretion, a regulator of the bioenergetics of exocrine cells and a contributor to exocrine cell damage. Exocrine secretory cells, exocrine tissues and diseases affecting exocrine glands (like Sjögren's syndrome and acute pancreatitis) will, therefore, provide worthy research areas for the application of this new knowledge of the Ca2+ transport mechanisms in mitochondria.

Abstract: Summary
Identification of replication initiation sites, termed origins, is a crucial step in understanding genome transmission in any organism. Transcription of the Trypanosoma brucei genome is highly unusual, with each chromosome comprising a few discrete transcription units. To understand how DNA replication occurs in the context of such organization, we have performed genome-wide mapping of the binding sites of the replication initiator ORC1/CDC6 and have identified replication origins, revealing that both localize to the boundaries of the transcription units. A remarkably small number of active origins is seen, whose spacing is greater than in any other eukaryote. We show that replication and transcription in T. brucei have a profound functional overlap, as reducing ORC1/CDC6 levels leads to genome-wide increases in mRNA levels arising from the boundaries of the transcription units. In addition, ORC1/CDC6 loss causes derepression of silent Variant Surface Glycoprotein genes, which are critical for host immune evasion.

Abstract: Olfactomedin 4 (OLFM4) is highly expressed in gastrointestinal cancers and has an anti-apoptotic function. The roles of OLFM4 in tumor growth and metastasis and how it functions in these processes remain elusive. We investigated the function of OLFM4 in tumor growth and metastasis using B16F10 mouse melanoma cells as an experimental system. Our results showed that OLFM4 had no positive effect on cell viability or cell cycle progression in B16F10 cells. However, it significantly suppressed the tumorigenicity of B16F10 cells, i.e., intradermal primary tumor growth and lung metastasis. OLFM4 also suppressed the migration and invasion of B16F10 cells in vitro.For further insight into the mechanisms underlying OLFM4-mediated suppression of tumor progression, we examined the effect of OLFM4 on the expression of integrin and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), both of which are involved in tumor progression. Overexpression of OLFM4 clearly reduced the expression levels of integrin α1, integrin α4, integrin α5, integrin α6, and MMP9. Moreover, forced expression of MMP9 attenuated the inhibitory activity of OLFM4 on migration and invasiveness. Our findings provide the experimental evidence that OLFM4 may function as a tumor suppressor and an anti-metastatic gene during tumor progression.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy defects have recently been associated with chromosomal instability, a hallmark of human cancer. However, the functional specificity and mechanism of action of autophagy-related factors in genome stability remain elusive. Here we report that UVRAG, an autophagic tumor suppressor, plays a dual role in chromosomal stability, surprisingly independent of autophagy. We establish that UVRAG promotes DNA double-strand-break repair by directly binding and activating DNA-PK in nonhomologous end joining. Disruption of UVRAG increases genetic instability and sensitivity of cells to irradiation. Furthermore, UVRAG was also found to be localized at centrosomes and physically associated with CEP63, an integral component of centrosomes. Disruption of the association of UVRAG with centrosomes causes centrosome instability and aneuploidy. UVRAG thus represents an autophagy-related molecular factor that also has a convergent role in patrolling both the structural integrity and proper segregation of chromosomes, which may confer autophagy-independent tumor suppressor activity.

The Effects of Rosiglitazone on Osteoblastic Differentiation, Osteoclast Formation and Bone Resorption,

Abstract: Rosiglitazone has the potential to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), which in turn can affect bone formation and resorption. However, the mechanisms by which rosiglitazone regulates osteoclastic or osteoblastic differentiation are not fully understood. This study examines how rosiglitazone affects osteoclast formation, bone resorption and osteoblast differentiation from mouse bone marrow. Rosiglitazone treatment not only inhibited the formation of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive cells, but also prevented pit formation by bone marrow cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Rosiglitazone also suppressed the receptor activator of nuclear factor (NF)-κB ligand (RANKL) receptor (RANK) expression but increased PPARγ2 expression in the cells. In addition, rosiglitazone diminished RANKL-induced activation of (NF)-κB-DNA binding by blocking IκBα phosphorylation. Furthermore, it reduced collagen and osteocalcin levels to nearly zero and prevented mRNA expression of osteoblast-specific proteins including runt-related transcription factor-2, osteocalcin, and type I collagen. However, mRNA levels of adipocyte-specific marker, aP2, were markedly increased in the cells co-incubated with rosiglitazone. These results suggest that PPARγ activation by rosiglitazone inhibits osteoblast differentiation with increased adipogenesis in bone marrow cells and also may prevent osteoclast formation and bone resorption in the cells.

Abstract: Summary
The approximately 300 human cullin-RING ligases (CRLs) are multisubunit E3s in which a RING protein, either RBX1 or RBX2, recruits an E2 to catalyze ubiquitination. RBX1-containing CRLs also can bind Glomulin (GLMN), which binds RBX1's RING domain, regulates the RBX1-CUL1-containing SCFFBW7 complex, and is disrupted in the disease Glomuvenous Malformation. Here we report the crystal structure of a complex between GLMN, RBX1, and a fragment of CUL1. Structural and biochemical analyses reveal that GLMN adopts a HEAT-like repeat fold that tightly binds the E2-interacting surface of RBX1, inhibiting CRL-mediated chain formation by the E2 CDC34. The structure explains the basis for GLMN's selectivity toward RBX1 over RBX2, and how disease-associated mutations disrupt GLMN-RBX1 interactions. Our study reveals a mechanism for RING E3 ligase regulation, whereby an inhibitor blocks E2 access, and raises the possibility that other E3s are likewise controlled by cellular proteins that mask E2-binding surfaces to mediate inhibition.

Abstract: Summary
The four mammalian Argonaute family members are thought to share redundant functions in the microRNA pathway, yet only AGO2 possesses the catalytic “slicer” function required for RNAi. Whether AGO1, AGO3, or AGO4 possesses specialized functions remains unclear. Here we show that AGO4 localizes to spermatocyte nuclei during meiotic prophase I, specifically at sites of asynapsis and the transcriptionally silenced XY subdomain, the sex body. We generated Ago4 knockout mice and show that Ago4−/− spermatogonia initiate meiosis early, resulting from premature induction of retinoic acid-response genes. During prophase I, the sex body assembles incorrectly in Ago4−/− mice, leading to disrupted meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI). This is associated with a dramatic loss of microRNAs, >20% of which arises from the X chromosome. Thus, AGO4 regulates meiotic entry and MSCI in mammalian germ cells, implicating small RNA pathways in these processes.

Abstract: Summary
Angiogenesis requires coordination of distinct cell behaviors between tip and stalk cells. Although this process is governed by regulatory interactions between the vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf) and Notch signaling pathways, little is known about the potential role of microRNAs. Through deep sequencing and functional screening in zebrafish, we find that miR-221 is essential for angiogenesis. miR-221 knockdown phenocopied defects associated with loss of the tip cell-expressed Flt4 receptor. Furthermore, miR-221 was required for tip cell proliferation and migration, as well as tip cell potential in mosaic blood vessels. miR-221 knockdown also prevented “hyper-angiogenesis” defects associated with Notch deficiency and miR-221 expression was inhibited by Notch signaling. Finally, miR-221 promoted tip cell behavior through repression of two targets: cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1b (cdkn1b) and phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 (pik3r1). These results identify miR-221 as an important regulatory node through which tip cell migration and proliferation are controlled during angiogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
We have recently demonstrated that human pediatric mesenchymal stem cells can be reprogrammed toward a Ewing sarcoma family tumor (ESFT) cancer stem cell (CSC) phenotype by mechanisms that implicate microRNAs (miRNAs). Here, we show that the miRNA profile of ESFT CSCs is shared by embryonic stem cells and CSCs from divergent tumor types. We also provide evidence that the miRNA profile of ESFT CSCs is the result of reversible disruption of TARBP2-dependent miRNA maturation. Restoration of TARBP2 activity and systemic delivery of synthetic forms of either of two of its targets, miRNA-143 or miRNA-145, inhibited ESFT CSC clonogenicity and tumor growth in vivo. Our observations suggest that CSC self-renewal and tumor maintenance may depend on deregulation of TARBP2-dependent miRNA expression.

Abstract: Summary
Variation in chromatin composition and organization often reflects differences in genome function. Histone variants, for example, replace canonical histones to contribute to regulation of numerous nuclear processes including transcription, DNA repair, and chromosome segregation. Here we focus on H2A.Bbd, a rapidly evolving variant found in mammals but not in invertebrates. We report that in human cells, nucleosomes bearing H2A.Bbd form unconventional chromatin structures enriched within actively transcribed genes and characterized by shorter DNA protection and nucleosome spacing. Analysis of transcriptional profiles from cells depleted for H2A.Bbd demonstrated widespread changes in gene expression with a net downregulation of transcription and disruption of normal mRNA splicing patterns. In particular, we observed changes in exon inclusion rates and increased presence of intronic sequences in mRNA products upon H2A.Bbd depletion. Taken together, our results indicate that H2A.Bbd is involved in formation of a specific chromatin structure that facilitates both transcription and initial mRNA processing.

Abstract: Summary
Active genes in yeast can be targeted to the nuclear periphery through interaction of cis-acting “DNA zip codes” with the nuclear pore complex. We find that genes with identical zip codes cluster together. This clustering was specific; pairs of genes that were targeted to the nuclear periphery by different zip codes did not cluster together. Insertion of two different zip codes (GRS I or GRS III) at an ectopic site induced clustering with endogenous genes that have that zip code. Targeting to the nuclear periphery and interaction with the nuclear pore is a prerequisite for gene clustering, but clustering can be maintained in the nucleoplasm. Finally, we find that the Put3 transcription factor recognizes the GRS I zip code to mediate both targeting to the NPC and interchromosomal clustering. These results suggest that zip-code-mediated clustering of genes at the nuclear periphery influences the three-dimensional arrangement of the yeast genome.

Abstract: Summary
The TOR kinase, which is present in the functionally distinct complexes TORC1 and TORC2, is essential for growth but associated with disease and aging. Elucidation of how TOR influences life span will identify mechanisms of fundamental importance in aging and TOR functions. Here we show that when TORC1 is inhibited genetically in C. elegans, SKN-1/Nrf, and DAF-16/FoxO activate protective genes, and increase stress resistance and longevity. SKN-1 also upregulates TORC1 pathway gene expression in a feedback loop. Rapamycin triggers a similar protective response in C. elegans and mice, but increases worm life span dependent upon SKN-1 and not DAF-16, apparently by interfering with TORC2 along with TORC1. TORC1, TORC2, and insulin/IGF-1-like signaling regulate SKN-1 activity through different mechanisms. We conclude that modulation of SKN-1/Nrf and DAF-16/FoxO may be generally important in the effects of TOR signaling in vivo and that these transcription factors mediate an opposing relationship between growth signals and longevity.

Abstract: Summary
We generated knockout mice for MCM8 and MCM9 and show that deficiency for these genes impairs homologous recombination (HR)-mediated DNA repair during gametogenesis and somatic cells cycles. MCM8−/− mice are sterile because spermatocytes are blocked in meiotic prophase I, and females have only arrested primary follicles and frequently develop ovarian tumors. MCM9−/− females also are sterile as ovaries are completely devoid of oocytes. In contrast, MCM9−/− testes produce spermatozoa, albeit in much reduced quantity. Mcm8−/− and Mcm9−/− embryonic fibroblasts show growth defects and chromosomal damage and cannot overcome a transient inhibition of replication fork progression. In these cells, chromatin recruitment of HR factors like Rad51 and RPA is impaired and HR strongly reduced. We further demonstrate that MCM8 and MCM9 form a complex and that they coregulate their stability. Our work uncovers essential functions of MCM8 and MCM9 in HR-mediated DSB repair during gametogenesis, replication fork maintenance, and DNA repair.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy is a major catabolic pathway in eukaryotes associated with a broad spectrum of human diseases. In autophagy, autophagosomes carrying cellular cargoes fuse with lysosomes for degradation. However, the molecular mechanism underlying autophagosome maturation is largely unknown. Here we report that TECPR1 binds to the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate and phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns[3]P) to promote autophagosome-lysosome fusion. TECPR1 and Atg16 form mutually exclusive complexes with the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate, and TECPR1 binds PtdIns(3)P upon association with the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate. Strikingly, TECPR1 localizes to and recruits Atg5 to autolysosome membrane. Consequently, elimination of TECPR1 leads to accumulation of autophagosomes and blocks autophagic degradation of LC3-II and p62. Finally, autophagosome maturation marked by GFP-mRFP-LC3 is defective in TECPR1-deficient cells. Thus, we propose that the concerted interactions among TECPR1, Atg12-Atg5, and PtdIns(3)P provide the fusion specificity between autophagosomes and lysosomes and that the assembly of this complex initiates the autophagosome maturation process.

Abstract: Summary
The molecular role of corepressors is poorly understood. Here, we studied the transcriptional function of the corepressor SMRT during terminal adipogenesis. Genome-wide DNA-binding profiling revealed that this corepressor is predominantly located in active chromatin regions and that most distal SMRT binding events are lost after differentiation induction. Promoter-proximal tethering of SMRT in preadipocytes is primarily mediated by KAISO through the conserved TCTCGCGAGA motif. Further characterization revealed that KAISO, similar to SMRT, accelerates the cell cycle and increases fat accumulation upon knockdown, identifying KAISO as an adipogenic repressor that likely modulates the mitotic clonal expansion phase of this process. SMRT-bound promoter-distal sites tend to overlap with C/EBPβ-bound regions, which become occupied by proadipogenic transcription factors after SMRT clearance. This reveals a role for SMRT in masking enhancers from proadipogenic factors in preadipocytes. Finally, we identified SMRT as an adipogenic gatekeeper as it directly fine-tunes transcription of pro- and antiadipogenic genes.

Abstract: Summary
Brains have to decide whether and how to respond to detected stimuli based on complex sensory input. The vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster evaluates food sources based on olfactory cues. Here, we performed a behavioral screen using the vinegar fly and established the innate valence of 110 odorants. Our analysis of neuronal activation patterns evoked by attractive and aversive odorants suggests that even though the identity of odorants is coded by the set of activated receptors, the main representation of odorant valence is formed at the output level of the antennal lobe. The topographic clustering within the antennal lobe of valence-specific output neurons resembles a corresponding domain in the olfactory bulb of mice. The basal anatomical structure of the olfactory circuit between insects and vertebrates is known to be similar; our study suggests that the representation of odorant valence is as well.

Abstract: Summary
Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS) is an aggressive pediatric sarcoma of muscle. Here, we show that ERMS-propagating potential is confined to myf5+ cells and can be visualized in live, fluorescent transgenic zebrafish. During early tumor growth, myf5+ ERMS cells reside adjacent normal muscle fibers. By late-stage ERMS, myf5+ cells are reorganized into distinct regions separated from differentiated tumor cells. Time-lapse imaging of late-stage ERMS revealed that myf5+ cells populate newly formed tumor only after seeding by highly migratory myogenin+ ERMS cells. Moreover, myogenin+ ERMS cells can enter the vasculature, whereas myf5+ ERMS-propagating cells do not. Our data suggest that non-tumor-propagating cells likely have important supportive roles in cancer progression and facilitate metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
The field of epigenomics has been transformed by chromatin immunoprecipitation approaches that provide for the localization of a defined protein or posttranslationally modified protein to specific chromosomal sites. While these approaches have helped us conceptualize epigenetic mechanisms, the field has been limited by the inability to define features such as the proteome and histone modifications at a specific genomic locus in an unbiased manner. We developed an unbiased approach whereby a unique native genomic locus was isolated, which was followed by high-resolution proteomic identification of specifically associated proteins and histone posttranslational modifications. This chromatin affinity purification with mass spectrometry (ChAP-MS) technique was used to specifically enrich a ∼1,000 base pair section of GAL1 chromatin under transcriptionally active and repressive conditions, as well as to identify the specifically bound proteins and histone posttranslational modifications. ChAP-MS should yield insight into the regulatory mechanisms of transcription and help identify factors that epigenetically control chromatin function.

Abstract: Summary
A hallmark of aging is an imbalance between production and clearance of reactive oxygen species and increased levels of oxidatively damaged biomolecules. Herein, we demonstrate that splenic and nodal antigen-presenting cells purified from aging mice accumulate oxidatively modified proteins with side-chain carbonylation, advanced glycation end products, and lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, we show that the endosomal accumulation of oxidatively modified proteins interferes with the efficient processing of exogenous antigens and degradation of macroautophagy-delivered proteins. In support of a causative role for oxidized products in the inefficient immune response, a decrease in oxidative stress improved the adaptive immune response to immunizing antigens. These findings underscore a previously unrecognized negative effect of age-dependent changes in cellular proteostasis on the immune response.

Abstract: Chitinase is a rate-limiting and endo-splitting enzyme involved in the bio-degradation of chitin, an important component of the cuticular exoskeleton and peritrophic matrix in insects. We isolated a cDNA-encoding chitinase from the last larval integument of the cabbage moth, Mamestra brassicae (Lepidoptera; Noctuidae), cloned the ORF cDNA into E. coli to confirm its functionality, and analyzed the deduced amino acid sequence in comparison with previously described lepidopteran chitinases. M. brassicae chitinase expressed in the transformed E. coli cells with the chitinase-encoding cDNA enhanced cell proliferation to about 1.6 times of the untransformed wild type strain in a colloidal chitin-including medium with only a very limited amount of other nutrients. Compared with the wild type strain, the intracellular levels of chitin degradation derivatives, glucosamine and N-acetylglucosamine were about 7.2 and 2.3 times higher, respectively, while the extracellular chitinase activity was about 2.2 times higher in the transformed strain. The ORF of M. brassicae chitinaseencoding cDNA consisted of 1686 nucleotides (562 amino acid residues) except for the stop codon, and its deduced amino acid composition revealed a calculated molecular weight of 62.7 and theoretical pl of 5.3. The ORF was composed of N-terminal leading signal peptide (AA 1-20), catalytic domain (AA 21-392), linker region (AA 393-498), and C-terminal chitin-binding domain (AA 499-562) showing its characteristic structure as a molting fluid chitinase. ln phylogenetic analysis, the enzymes from 6 noctuid species were grouped together, separately from a group of 3 bom-bycid and 1 tortricid enzymes, corresponding to their taxonomic relationships at both the family and genus levels.

Abstract: Mitochondria are essential for ensuring numerous fundamental physiological processes such as cellular energy, redox balance, modulation of Ca2+ signaling and important biosynthetic pathways. They also govern the cell fate by participating in the apoptosis pathway. The mitochondrial shape, volume, number and distribution within the cells are strictly controlled. The regulation of these parameters has an impact on mitochondrial function, especially in the central nervous system, where trafficking of mitochondria is critical to their strategic intracellular distribution, presumably according to local energy demands. Thus, the maintenance of a healthy mitochondrial population is essential to avoid the impairment of the processes they regulate: for this purpose, cells have developed mechanisms involving a complex system of quality control to remove damaged mitochondria, or to renew them. Defects of these processes impair mitochondrial function and lead to disordered cell function, i.e., to a disease condition. Given the standard role of mitochondria in all cells, it might be expected that their dysfunction would give rise to similar defects in all tissues. However, damaged mitochondrial function has pleiotropic effects in multicellular organisms, resulting in diverse pathological conditions, ranging from cardiac and brain ischemia, to skeletal muscle myopathies to neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we will focus on the relationship between mitochondrial (and cellular) derangements and Ca2+ dysregulation in neurodegenerative diseases, emphasizing the evidence obtained in genetic models. Common patterns, that recognize the derangement of Ca2+ and energy control as a causative factor, have been identified: advances in the understanding of the molecular regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis, and on the ways in which it could become perturbed in neurological disorders, may lead to the development of therapeutic strategies that modulate neuronal Ca2+ signaling.

Abstract: Cell therapy has proven to be a highly promising method in clinical applications, raising so much hope for the treatment of injured tissues with low, if any, self regeneration potential such as central and peripheral nervous system. Neurally induced bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (NIMSCs) as well as olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) were transplanted in a rat model of sub-acute spinal cord injury and the behavioral and histological analyses were conducted. A balloon-compression technique was used to produce an injury at T8–T9 level of spinal cord. After a week post injury, rats were injected with either NIMSCs or OECs at the center of developing lesion cavity, 3mm cranial and 3mm caudal to the cavity. Weekly behavioral assessment using BBB score was done over five-week period post transplantation and finally histological assessment was performed to locate labeled cells in the tissue in order to evaluate the reduction of cavity formation and axonal regeneration. Evaluation of locomotor performance showed significant behavioral improvement in NIMSC group over OEC and control groups. The histological analyses revealed the presence of transplanted cells in the spinal cord parenchyma. Volume of injured area that was occupied with syrinx cavity in NIMSC group was significantly less than control group. In addition, meanwhile neurofilament-positive axons significantly showed higher expression in rats receiving NIMSC compared to the other two groups. In conclusion NIMSC caused both behavioral and histological improvement that potentially makes them a promising candidate for cell therapy approaches of spinal cord injuries.

Abstract: Summary
Morphogenesis of the heart requires tight control of cardiac progenitor cell specification, expansion, and differentiation. Retinoic acid (RA) signaling restricts expansion of the second heart field (SHF), serving as an important morphogen in heart development. Here, we identify the LIM domain protein Ajuba as a crucial regulator of the SHF progenitor cell specification and expansion. Ajuba-deficient zebrafish embryos show an increased pool of Isl1+ cardiac progenitors and, subsequently, dramatically increased numbers of cardiomyocytes at the arterial and venous poles. Furthermore, we show that Ajuba binds Isl1, represses its transcriptional activity, and is also required for autorepression of Isl1 expression in an RA-dependent manner. Lack of Ajuba abrogates the RA-dependent restriction of Isl1+ cardiac cells. We conclude that Ajuba plays a central role in regulating the SHF during heart development by linking RA signaling to the function of Isl1, a key transcription factor in cardiac progenitor cells.
