Abstract: Summary
The extra-embryonic tissues that form the placenta originate from a small population of trophectoderm cells with stem cell properties, positioned at the embryonic pole of the mouse blastocyst. During the implantation stages, the polar trophectoderm rapidly proliferates and transforms into extra-embryonic ectoderm. The current model of trophoblast morphogenesis suggests that tissue folding reshapes the trophoblast during the blastocyst to egg cylinder transition. Instead of through folding, here we found that the tissue scale architecture of the stem cell compartment of the trophoblast lineage is reorganized via inversion of the epithelial polarity axis. Our findings show the developmental significance of polarity inversion and provide a framework for the morphogenetic transitions in the peri-implantation trophoblast.

Abstract: Summary
Gene-by-environment (GxE) interactions, in which a genetic variant’s phenotypic effect is condition specific, are fundamental for understanding fitness landscapes and evolution but have been difficult to identify at the single-nucleotide level. Although many condition-specific quantitative trait loci (QTLs) have been mapped, these typically contain numerous inconsequential variants in linkage, precluding understanding of the causal GxE variants. Here, we introduce BARcoded Cas9 retron precise parallel editing via homology (CRISPEY-BAR), a high-throughput precision genome editing strategy, and use it to map GxE interactions of naturally occurring genetic polymorphisms impacting yeast growth. We identified hundreds of GxE variants within condition-specific QTLs, revealing unexpected genetic complexity. Moreover, we found that 93.7% of non-neutral natural variants within ergosterol biosynthesis pathway genes showed GxE interactions, including many impacting antifungal drug resistance through diverse molecular mechanisms. In sum, our results suggest an extremely complex, context-dependent fitness landscape characterized by pervasive GxE interactions while also demonstrating massively parallel genome editing as an effective means for investigating this complexity.

Abstract: Summary
Grain size is a key component of grain yield and quality in crops. Several core players of auxin signaling have been revealed to modulate grain size; however, to date, few genetically defined pathways have been reported, and whether phosphorylation could boost degradation of Aux/IAA proteins is uncertain. Here, we show that TGW3 (also called OsGSK5) interacts with and phosphorylates OsIAA10. Phosphorylation of OsIAA10 facilitates its interaction with OsTIR1 and subsequent destabilization, but this modification hinders its interaction with OsARF4. Our genetic and molecular evidence identifies an OsTIR1-OsIAA10-OsARF4 axis as key for grain size control. In addition, physiological and molecular studies suggest that TGW3 mediates the brassinosteroid response, the effect of which can be relayed through the regulatory axis. Collectively, these findings define a auxin signaling pathway to regulate grain size, in which phosphorylation of OsIAA10 enhances its proteolysis and potentiates OsIAA10-OsARF4-mediated auxin signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Fasting strategies are under active clinical investigation in patients receiving chemotherapy. Prior murine studies suggest that alternate-day fasting may attenuate doxorubicin cardiotoxicity and stimulate nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis. In this study, human heart tissue from patients with doxorubicin-induced heart failure demonstrated increased nuclear TFEB protein. In mice treated with doxorubicin, alternate-day fasting or viral TFEB transduction increased mortality and impaired cardiac function. Mice randomized to alternate-day fasting plus doxorubicin exhibited increased TFEB nuclear translocation in the myocardium. When combined with doxorubicin, cardiomyocyte-specific TFEB overexpression provoked cardiac remodeling, while systemic TFEB overexpression increased growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) and caused heart failure and death. Cardiomyocyte TFEB knockout attenuated doxorubicin cardiotoxicity, while recombinant GDF15 was sufficient to cause cardiac atrophy. Our studies identify that both sustained alternate-day fasting and a TFEB/GDF15 pathway exacerbate doxorubicin cardiotoxicity.

Abstract: Summary
Dopamine neurons project to the striatum to control movement, cognition, and motivation via slower volume transmission as well as faster dopamine, glutamate, and GABA synaptic actions capable of conveying the temporal information in dopamine neuron firing. To define the scope of these synaptic actions, recordings of dopamine-neuron-evoked synaptic currents were made in four major striatal neuron types, spanning the entire striatum. This revealed that inhibitory postsynaptic currents are widespread, while excitatory postsynaptic currents are localized to the medial nucleus accumbens and the anterolateral-dorsal striatum, and that all synaptic actions are weak in the posterior striatum. Synaptic actions in cholinergic interneurons are the strongest, variably mediating inhibition throughout the striatum and excitation in the medial accumbens, capable of controlling their activity. This mapping shows that dopamine neuron synaptic actions extend throughout the striatum, preferentially target cholinergic interneurons, and define distinct striatal subregions.

Abstract: Background
Accumulation of glutamate damages neurons via the reactive oxygen species (ROS) injury, which was involved in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanism of neuronal oxidative stress damage caused by glutamate and the intervention targets still needs to be further studied. This study explored whether 5′ adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-induced glucose metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunction were related to glutamate-dependent ROS injury of the neuron.
Methods
Neuronal oxidative stress injury was induced by glutamate treatment in HT-22 cells. Western blotting was used to evaluate the phosphorylation of the AMPK. The XF24 Flux Analyzer was used to measure the effect of glutamate and Compound C (a well-known pharmacological inhibitor of AMPK phosphorylation) on the cellular oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of HT-22 cells. Glucose uptake, intracellular ROS, mitochondrial potential, apoptosis and cell viability were quantified using biochemical assays.
Results
Glutamate caused the phosphorylation of AMPK and subsequently promoted the glucose uptake. Furthermore, AMPK-mediated glucose uptake enhanced OCR and increased the intracellular ROS levels in neurons. The pharmacological inhibition of AMPK phosphorylation by Compound C attenuated glutamate-induced toxicity in HT22 cells by regulating the glucose uptake/mitochondrial respiration/ROS pathway.
Conclusions
The AMPK phosphorylation/glucose uptake/mitochondrial respiration/ROS pathway was involved in glutamate-induced excitotoxic injury in HT22 cells. The inhibition of AMPK phosphorylation may be a potential target for the development of therapeutic agents for treating the glutamate-induced neurotoxicity.

Abstract: Summary
The Polycomb-group chromatin modifiers play important roles to repress or switch off gene expression in plants and animals. How the active chromatin state is switched to a Polycomb-repressed state is unclear. In Arabidopsis, prolonged cold induces the switching of the highly active chromatin state at the potent floral repressor FLC to a Polycomb-repressed state, which is epigenetically maintained when temperature rises to confer “cold memory,” enabling plants to flower in spring. We report that the cis-acting cold memory element (CME) region at FLC bears bivalent marks of active histone H3K4me3 and repressive H3K27me3 that are read and interpreted by an assembly of bivalent chromatin readers to drive cold-induced switching of the FLC chromatin state. In response to cold, the 47-bp CME and its associated bivalent chromatin feature drive the switching of active chromatin state at a recombinant gene to a Polycomb-repressed domain, conferring cold memory. We reveal a paradigm for environment-induced chromatin-state switching at bivalent loci in plants.

Abstract: Objective
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common and painful joint disease with multifactorial causes. Stem cells, due to their high ability to reproduce and differentiate, have created a new horizon in tissue engineering of cartilage and bone. Secretions are one of the new therapies that can be used with stem cells or separately. This study aimed to compare the healing effects of human dental pulp stem cells, cell-free secretome, and human dental pulp mesenchymal stem cells with secretome in the induced OA in male rats.
Methods
Dental pulp mesenchymal stem cells were isolated and prepared from human dental pulp. The collagenase type II was injected into the knee of twenty-five male Sprague-Dawley rats, and after 10 weeks, OA was confirmed. Rats were divided into five groups (n = 5): 1) Human dental pulp stem cells plus secretome (HDP+Sec); 2) Human dental pulp stem cells (HDP); 3) Secretome (Sec); 4) Hyalgan as the positive control (Hya); 5) No treatment as the negative control (Ctrl). After 12 weeks since OA was confirmed, the healing process was examined by histopathology and radiology evaluations.
Results
Histopathological evaluations, radiological assessments, and matrix indexes in three treatment groups significantly improved compared to the Ctrl and Hya groups. Surface in HDP+Sec was significantly better than the Ctrl group. In radiological evaluations, a significant decrease in OA was observed in the three treatment groups in comparison with the Ctrl groups. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups in any radiological and histopathological evaluations. HDP + Sec group slightly records better results compared to Sec or HDP treatment groups.
Conclusion
It was concluded that human dental pulp stem cells and their secretome promote cartilage regeneration due to their cell protective potential as well as matrix degeneration reduction capacity.

Abstract: Summary
Nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) factors act in replication-fork protection, restart, and repair. Here, we identified a mechanism related to RNA:DNA hybrids to establish the NHEJ factor Ku-mediated barrier to nascent strand degradation in fission yeast. RNase H activities promote nascent strand degradation and replication restart, with a prominent role of RNase H2 in processing RNA:DNA hybrids to overcome the Ku barrier to nascent strand degradation. RNase H2 cooperates with the MRN-Ctp1 axis to sustain cell resistance to replication stress in a Ku-dependent manner. Mechanistically, the need of RNaseH2 in nascent strand degradation requires the primase activity that allows establishing the Ku barrier to Exo1, whereas impairing Okazaki fragment maturation reinforces the Ku barrier. Finally, replication stress induces Ku foci in a primase-dependent manner and favors Ku binding to RNA:DNA hybrids. We propose a function for the RNA:DNA hybrid originating from Okazaki fragments in controlling the Ku barrier specifying nuclease requirement to engage fork resection.

Abstract: Summary
Tumors in immune equilibrium are held in balance between outgrowth and destruction by the immune system. The equilibrium phase defines the duration of clinical remission and stable disease, and escape from equilibrium remains a major clinical problem. Using a non-replicating HSV-1 vector expressing interleukin-12 (d106S-IL12), we developed a mouse model of therapy-induced immune equilibrium, a phenomenon previously seen only in humans. This immune equilibrium was centrally reliant on interferon-γ (IFNγ). CD8+ T cell direct recognition of MHC class I, perforin/granzyme-mediated cytotoxicity, and extrinsic death receptor signaling such as Fas/FasL were all individually dispensable for equilibrium. IFNγ was critically important and played redundant roles in host and tumor cells such that IFNγ sensing in either compartment was sufficient for immune equilibrium. We propose that these redundant mechanisms of action are integrated by IFNγ to protect from oncogenic or chronic viral threats and establish IFNγ as a central node in therapy-induced immune equilibrium.

Abstract: Summary
In November 2021, Omicron BA.1, containing a raft of new spike mutations, emerged and quickly spread globally. Intense selection pressure to escape the antibody response produced by vaccines or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection then led to a rapid succession of Omicron sub-lineages with waves of BA.2 and then BA.4/5 infection. Recently, many variants have emerged such as BQ.1 and XBB, which carry up to 8 additional receptor-binding domain (RBD) amino acid substitutions compared with BA.2. We describe a panel of 25 potent monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) generated from vaccinees suffering BA.2 breakthrough infections. Epitope mapping shows potent mAb binding shifting to 3 clusters, 2 corresponding to early-pandemic binding hotspots. The RBD mutations in recent variants map close to these binding sites and knock out or severely knock down neutralization activity of all but 1 potent mAb. This recent mAb escape corresponds with large falls in neutralization titer of vaccine or BA.1, BA.2, or BA.4/5 immune serum.

Abstract: Summary
ARID1A, encoding a subunit of the SWI/SNF complex, is mutated in ∼50% of clear cell ovarian carcinoma (OCCC) cases. Here we show that inhibition of the mevalonate pathway synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) by driving inflammasome-regulated immunomodulating pyroptosis in ARID1A-inactivated OCCCs. SWI/SNF inactivation downregulates the rate-limiting enzymes in the mevalonate pathway such as HMGCR and HMGCS1, which creates a dependence on the residual activity of the pathway in ARID1A-inactivated cells. Inhibitors of the mevalonate pathway such as simvastatin suppresses the growth of ARID1A mutant, but not wild-type, OCCCs. In addition, simvastatin synergizes with anti-PD-L1 antibody in a genetic OCCC mouse model driven by conditional Arid1a inactivation and in a humanized immunocompetent ARID1A mutant patient-derived OCCC mouse model. Our data indicate that inhibition of the mevalonate pathway simultaneously suppresses tumor cell growth and boosts antitumor immunity by promoting pyroptosis, which synergizes with ICB in suppressing ARID1A-mutated cancers.

Abstract: Cisplatin, which is effective for the treatment of solid tumors, also can induce cochlear hair cell damage. Therefore, this study was intended to explore how Hippo/YAP signaling pathway affects the cochlear hair cell injury by regulating ferroptosis. After cisplatin induction, or LAT1-IN-1 (YAP activator) and verteporfin (YAP inhibitor) treatment or transfection, the viability of HEI-OC1 cells was detected by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. The iron level and the levels of oxidative stress markers (ROS, MDA and 4-HNE) were analyzed by iron assay kit, reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) assay kits, respectively. The expression of ferritin light chain (FTL) in HEI-OC1 cells was detected by immunofluorescence and protein expressions of yes associated protein (YAP,) phosphorylated YAP (p-YAP), transferrin receptor (TFRC), glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4) and solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) in HEI-OC1 cells were detected by western blot. The transcription of FTL and TFRC by YAP1 was verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. The transfection efficiency of small interfering RNA (si-RNA) specific to FTL (siRNA-FTL) and TFRC (siRNA-TFRC) was confirmed by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR). As a result, cisplatin inhibited the viability of HEI-OC1 cells by increasing free Fe2+ level and decreasing FTL level. LAT1-IN-1 promoted the viability of cisplatin-induced HEI-OC1 cells by suppressing oxidative stress level, free Fe2+ level, ferroptosis and increasing FTL level, while the effect of verteporfin was the opposite. YAP1 transcriptionally regulated the expression of FTL and TFRC. Inhibition of FTL suppressed the viability of cisplatin-induced HEI-OC1 cells by increasing oxidative stress level, free Fe2+ level, ferroptosis and decreasing FTL level, while the effect of TFRC inhibition was the opposite. In conclusion, YAP1 ameliorated cochlear hair cell injury by upregulating FTL and TFRC to suppress ferroptosis.

Abstract: Summary
Recent clinical trials revealed that immune checkpoint inhibitors and antiangiogenic reagent combination therapy improved the prognosis of various cancers. We investigated the roles of fibrocytes, collagen-producing monocyte-derived cells, in combination immunotherapy. Anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) antibody increases tumor-infiltrating fibrocytes and enhances the antitumor effects of anti-PD-L1 (programmed death ligand 1) antibody in vivo. Single-cell RNA sequencing of tumor-infiltrating CD45+ cells identifies a distinct “fibrocyte cluster” from “macrophage clusters” in vivo and in lung adenocarcinoma patients. A sub-clustering analysis reveals a fibrocyte sub-cluster that highly expresses co-stimulatory molecules. CD8+ T cell-costimulatory activity of tumor-infiltrating CD45+CD34+ fibrocytes is enhanced by anti-PD-L1 antibody. Peritumoral implantation of fibrocytes enhances the antitumor effect of PD-L1 blockade in vivo; CD86−/− fibrocytes do not. Tumor-infiltrating fibrocytes acquire myofibroblast-like phenotypes through transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)/small mothers against decapentaplegic (SMAD) signaling. Thus, TGF-βR/SMAD inhibitor enhances the antitumor effects of dual VEGF and PD-L1 blockade by regulating fibrocyte differentiation. Fibrocytes are highlighted as regulators of the response to programmed death 1 (PD-1)/PD-L1 blockade.

Abstract: Summary
A hexanucleotide (GGGGCC)n repeat expansion in C9orf72 causes amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), eliciting toxic effects through generation of RNA foci, dipeptide repeat proteins, and/or loss of C9orf72 protein. Defects in nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) have been implicated as a pathogenic mechanism underlying repeat expansion toxicity. Here, we show that loss of C9orf72 disrupts the Ran-GTPase gradient and NCT in vitro and in vivo. NCT disruption in vivo is enhanced by the presence of compositionally different types of cytoplasmic Importin β-1 granule that exhibit neuronal subtype-specific properties. We show that the abundance of Importin β-1 granules is increased in the context of C9orf72 deficiency, disrupting interactions with nuclear pore complex proteins. These granules appear to associate with the nuclear envelope and are co-immunoreactive for G3BP1 and K63-ubiquitin. These findings link loss of C9orf72 protein to gain-of-function mechanisms and defects in NCT.

Abstract: Summary
Auxilin participates in the uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs), thereby facilitating synaptic vesicle (SV) regeneration at presynaptic sites. Auxilin (DNAJC6/PARK19) loss-of-function mutations cause early-onset Parkinson’s disease (PD). Here, we utilized auxilin knockout (KO) mice to elucidate the mechanisms through which auxilin deficiency and clathrin-uncoating deficits lead to PD. Auxilin KO mice display cardinal features of PD, including progressive motor deficits, α-synuclein pathology, nigral dopaminergic loss, and neuroinflammation. Significantly, treatment with L-DOPA ameliorated motor deficits. Unbiased proteomic and neurochemical analyses of auxilin KO brains indicated dopamine dyshomeostasis. We validated these findings by demonstrating slower dopamine reuptake kinetics in vivo, an effect associated with dopamine transporter misrouting into axonal membrane deformities in the dorsal striatum. Defective SV protein sorting and elevated synaptic autophagy also contribute to ineffective dopamine sequestration and compartmentalization, ultimately leading to neurodegeneration. This study provides insights into how presynaptic endocytosis deficits lead to dopaminergic vulnerability and pathogenesis of PD.

Abstract: Summary
Hallucinations limit widespread therapeutic use of psychedelics as rapidly acting antidepressants. Here we profiled the non-hallucinogenic lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) analog 2-bromo-LSD (2-Br-LSD) at more than 33 aminergic G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). 2-Br-LSD shows partial agonism at several aminergic GPCRs, including 5-HT2A, and does not induce the head-twitch response (HTR) in mice, supporting its classification as a non-hallucinogenic 5-HT2A partial agonist. Unlike LSD, 2-Br-LSD lacks 5-HT2B agonism, an effect linked to cardiac valvulopathy. Additionally, 2-Br-LSD produces weak 5-HT2A β-arrestin recruitment and internalization in vitro and does not induce tolerance in vivo after repeated administration. 2-Br-LSD induces dendritogenesis and spinogenesis in cultured rat cortical neurons and increases active coping behavior in mice, an effect blocked by the 5-HT2A-selective antagonist volinanserin (M100907). 2-Br-LSD also reverses the behavioral effects of chronic stress. Overall, 2-Br-LSD has an improved pharmacological profile compared with LSD and may have profound therapeutic value for mood disorders and other indications.

Abstract: Summary
A large body of evidence indicates functional variations along the hippocampal longitudinal axis. To investigate whether and how value and outcome processing vary between the dorsal (DH) and the ventral hippocampus (VH), we examined neuronal activity and inactivation effects of the DH and VH in mice performing probabilistic classical conditioning tasks. Inactivation of either structure disrupts value-dependent anticipatory licking, and value-coding neurons are found in both structures, indicating their involvement in value processing. However, the DH neuronal population increases activity as a function of value, while the VH neuronal population is preferentially responsive to the highest-value sensory cue. Also, signals related to outcome-dependent value learning are stronger in the DH. VH neurons instead show rapid responses to punishment and strongly biased responses to negative prediction error. These findings suggest that the DH faithfully represents the external value landscape, whereas the VH preferentially represents behaviorally relevant, salient features of experienced events.

Abstract: In elderly individuals, aging can cause changes in the structure and function of one or more organs, increasing their susceptibility to various damage factors, especially the heart, kidney, brain and other important organs. Therefore, the incidence of cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative diseases and chronic kidney disease in the elderly population is significantly higher than that in the general population. In our previous study, the hearts of aged mice did not express the antiaging protein Klotho (KL), but peripheral elevation of KL may significantly delay cardiac aging. The kidney and brain are the main organs that produce KL, but the effects and mechanism of peripheral KL supplementation on the kidney and hippocampus are still unclear. To study the effect and possible mechanism of KL against kidney and hippocampus aging, 60 male BALB/c mice were randomly divided into the Adult group, the KL group, the D-gal-induced Aged group, and the KL + Aged group. The results showed that KL increased anti-inflammatory M2a/M2c macrophages in the kidney and hippocampus of aging mice, significantly reduced tissue inflammation and oxidative stress, and improved organ function and aging status. More importantly, we demonstrate that despite the impermeable bloodbrain barrier in mice, peripherally administered KL surprisingly enhances M2-type microglia polarization, induces cognitive enhancement and reduces neuroinflammation. Cellular experimental results suggest that KL may play a role in delaying senescence by regulating the TLR4/Myd88/NF-κB signaling pathway to regulate macrophage polarization and reduce aging-related inflammation and oxidative stress.

Abstract: Summary
The cystic fibrosis (CF) respiratory tract harbors pathogenic bacteria that cause life-threatening chronic infections. Of these, Pseudomonas aeruginosa becomes increasingly dominant with age and is associated with worsening lung function and declining microbial diversity. We aimed to understand why P. aeruginosa dominates over other pathogens to cause worsening disease. Here, we show that P. aeruginosa responds to dynamic changes in iron concentration, often associated with viral infection and pulmonary exacerbations, to become more competitive via expression of the TseT toxic effector. However, this behavior can be therapeutically targeted using the iron chelator deferiprone to block TseT expression and competition. Overall, we find that iron concentration and TseT expression significantly correlate with microbial diversity in the respiratory tract of people with CF. These findings improve our understanding of how P. aeruginosa becomes increasingly dominant with age in people with CF and provide a therapeutically targetable pathway to help prevent this shift.

Abstract: Summary
Cis-regulatory elements regulate gene expression and lineage specification. However, the potential regulation of cis-elements on mammalian embryogenesis remains largely unexplored. To address this question, we perform single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) and RNA-seq in embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5) and E13.5 mouse embryos. We construct the chromatin accessibility landscapes with cell spatial information in E7.5 embryos, showing the spatial patterns of cis-elements and the spatial distribution of potentially functional transcription factors (TFs). We further show that many germ-layer-specific cis-elements and TFs in E7.5 embryos are maintained in the cell types derived from the corresponding germ layers at later stages, suggesting that these cis-elements and TFs are important during cell differentiation. We also find a potential progenitor for Sertoli and granulosa cells in gonads. Interestingly, both Sertoli and granulosa cells exist in male gonads and female gonads during gonad development. Collectively, we provide a valuable resource to understand organogenesis in mammals.

Abstract: Summary
Inflammatory stimuli cause a state of emergency myelopoiesis leading to neutrophil-like monocyte expansion. However, their function, the committed precursors, or growth factors remain elusive. In this study we find that Ym1+Ly6Chi monocytes, an immunoregulatory entity of neutrophil-like monocytes, arise from progenitors of neutrophil 1 (proNeu1). Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) favors the production of neutrophil-like monocytes through previously unknown CD81+CX3CR1lo monocyte precursors. GFI1 promotes the differentiation of proNeu2 from proNeu1 at the cost of producing neutrophil-like monocytes. The human counterpart of neutrophil-like monocytes that also expands in response to G-CSF is found in CD14+CD16− monocyte fraction. The human neutrophil-like monocytes are discriminated from CD14+CD16− classical monocytes by CXCR1 expression and the capacity to suppress T cell proliferation. Collectively, our findings suggest that the aberrant expansion of neutrophil-like monocytes under inflammatory conditions is a process conserved between mouse and human, which may be beneficial for the resolution of inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic routing of nicotinamide (NAM) to NAD+ or 1-methylnicotinamide (MeNAM) has impacts on human health and aging. NAM is imported by cells or liberated from NAD+. The fate of 2H4-NAM in cultured cells, mice, and humans was determined by stable isotope tracing. 2H4-NAM is an NAD+ precursor via the salvage pathway in cultured A549 cells and human PBMCs and in A549 cell xenografts and PBMCs from 2H4-NAM-dosed mice and humans, respectively. 2H4-NAM is a MeNAM precursor in A549 cell cultures and xenografts, but not isolated PBMCs. NAM released from NAD+ is a poor MeNAM precursor. Additional A549 cell tracer studies yielded further mechanistic insight. NAMPT activators promote NAD+ synthesis and consumption. Surprisingly, NAM liberated from NAD+ in NAMPT activator-treated A549 cells is also routed toward MeNAM production. Metabolic fate mapping of the dual NAM sources across the translational spectrum (cells, mice, humans) illuminates a key regulatory node governing NAD+ and MeNAM synthesis.

Abstract: Summary
Multiple cancers regulate oxidative stress by activating the transcription factor NRF2 through mutation of its negative regulator, KEAP1. NRF2 has been studied extensively in KEAP1-mutant cancers; however, the role of this pathway in cancers with wild-type KEAP1 remains poorly understood. To answer this question, we induced NRF2 via pharmacological inactivation of KEAP1 in a panel of 50+ non-small cell lung cancer cell lines. Unexpectedly, marked decreases in viability were observed in >13% of the cell lines—an effect that was rescued by NRF2 ablation. Genome-wide and targeted CRISPR screens revealed that NRF2 induces NADH-reductive stress, through the upregulation of the NAD+-consuming enzyme ALDH3A1. Leveraging these findings, we show that cells treated with KEAP1 inhibitors or those with endogenous KEAP1 mutations are selectively vulnerable to Complex I inhibition, which impairs NADH oxidation capacity and potentiates reductive stress. Thus, we identify reductive stress as a metabolic vulnerability in NRF2-activated lung cancers.

Abstract: Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a major cause of injury after testicular torsion and can lead to permanent impairment of spermatogenesis. Emodin (6-methyl-1,3,8-trihydroxyanthraquinone) has potent anti-inflammatory effects and may be protective against IRI in various organs. Herein, we evaluated the effects of emodin on pyroptosis in spermatogenic cells and its role in the process of testicular IRI. A testicular torsion/detorsion (TTD) mouse model and an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) germ cell model were established. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed to evaluate the testicular ischemic injury. The expression of pyroptosis-related proteins and reactive oxygen species production in testis tissues were detected using Western blotting, quantitative real-time PCR, malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase assay kits and immunohistochemistry. Cell viability and cytotoxicity were evaluated using Cell Counting Kit-8 and lactate dehydrogenase assay kit. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunofluorescence and immunoblotting were performed to assess inflammatory protein levels. The results revealed that pyroptosis and inflammation levels were upregulated after testicular IRI, and emodin inhibited inflammation and pyroptosis by acting on NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain-associated protein 3 (NLRP3). Emodin exerts protective effects on testicular IRI by acting on the NLRP3 signaling pathway and inhibiting IRI-mediated pyroptosis. Emodin treatment attenuated testicular IRI and inhibited pyroptosis. Inhibitory effects of emodin on pyroptosis were attributed to the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasomes. Thus, emodin could be an alternative treatment for testicular IRI.

Abstract: Summary
As one of the core components of the switching or sucrose non-fermentable (SWI/SNF) complex, SMARCC1 (BAF155, SRG3) plays essential roles in activation of late inflammatory genes in response to microbial challenge. However, little is known about the mechanism of how SMARCC1 regulates the inflammatory innate response. Via functional screening, we identify the nuclear E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF138 as a negative regulator in the inflammatory innate response and show that RNF138 interacts with SMARCC1 and mediates its K48-linked polyubiquitination at position Lys643 and proteasomal degradation. As a result, the catalytic activity of RNF138 fine-tunes the kinetics of late inflammatory gene transcription by inhibiting chromatin remodeling at SWI/SNF-regulated gene loci. Reduced RNF138 and increased SMARCC1 in monocytes of rheumatoid arthritis patients are observed. These results provide mechanistic insight into the interplay among nucleosome remodeling, inflammation, and ubiquitylation and underscore the important role of the E3 ubiquitin ligases in controlling the extent and duration of inflammatory responses.

Abstract: This study aimed to exploring the pathophysiological mechanism of 7α,25-dihydroxycholesterol (7α,25-DHC) in osteoarthritis (OA) pathogenesis. 7α,25-DHC accelerated the proteoglycan loss in ex vivo organ-cultured articular cartilage explant. It was mediated by the decreasing extracellular matrix major components, including aggrecan and type II collagen, and the increasing expression and activation of degenerative enzymes, including matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 and -13, in chondrocytes cultured with 7α,25-DHC. Furthermore, 7α,25-DHC promoted caspase-dependent chondrocyte death via extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis. Moreover, 7α,25-DHC upregulated the expression of inflammatory factors, including inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, nitric oxide, and prostaglandin E2, via the production of reactive oxygen species via increase of oxidative stress in chondrocytes. In addition, 7α,25-DHC upregulated the expression of autophagy biomarkers, including beclin-1 and microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 via the modulation of p53-Akt-mTOR axis in chondrocytes. The expression of CYP7B1, caspase-3, and beclin-1 was elevated in the degenerative articular cartilage of mouse knee joint with OA. Taken together, our findings suggest that 7α,25-DHC is a pathophysiological risk factor of OA pathogenesis that is mediated a chondrocyte death via oxiapoptophagy, which is a mixed mode of apoptosis, oxidative stress, and autophagy.

Abstract: Summary
The canonical function of the Hippo signaling pathway is the regulation of organ growth. How this pathway controls cell-fate determination is less well understood. Here, we identify a function of the Hippo pathway in cell-fate decisions in the developing Drosophila eye, exerted through the interaction of Yorkie (Yki) with the transcriptional regulator Bonus (Bon), an ortholog of mammalian transcriptional intermediary factor 1/tripartite motif (TIF1/TRIM) family proteins. Instead of controlling tissue growth, Yki and Bon promote epidermal and antennal fates at the expense of the eye fate. Proteomic, transcriptomic, and genetic analyses reveal that Yki and Bon control these cell-fate decisions by recruiting transcriptional and post-transcriptional co-regulators and by repressing Notch target genes and activating epidermal differentiation genes. Our work expands the range of functions and regulatory mechanisms under Hippo pathway control.

Abstract: Cell swelling as a result of hypotonic stress is counteracted in mammalian cells by a process called regulatory volume decrease (RVD). We have recently discovered that RVD of human keratinocytes requires the LRRC8 volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC) and that Ca2+ exerts a modulatory function on RVD. However, the ion channel that is responsible for Ca2+ influx remains unknown. We investigated in this study whether the Ca2+-permeable TRPV4 ion channel, which functions as cell volume sensor in many cell types, may be involved in cell volume regulation during hypotonic stress response of human keratinocytes. We interfered with TRPV4 function in two human keratinocyte cell lines (HaCaT and NHEK-E6/E7) by using two TRPV4-specific inhibitors (RN1734 and GSK2193874), and by creating a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genetic TRPV4−/− knockout in HaCaT cells. We employed electrophysiological patch clamp analysis, fluorescence-based Ca2+ imaging and cell volume measurements to determine the functional importance of TRPV4. We could show that both hypotonic stress and direct activation of TRPV4 by the specific agonist GSK1016790A triggered intracellular Ca2+ response. Strikingly, the Ca2+ increase upon hypotonic stress was neither affected by genetic knockout of TRPV4 in HaCaT cells nor by pharmacological inhibition of TRPV4 in both keratinocyte cell lines. Accordingly, hypotonicity-induced cell swelling, downstream activation of VRAC currents as well as subsequent RVD were unaffected both in TRPV4 inhibitor-treated keratinocytes and in HaCaT-TRPV4−/− cells. In summary, our study shows that keratinocytes do not require TRPV4 for coping with hypotonic stress, which implies the involvement of other, yet unidentified Ca2+ channels.

Abstract: Summary
Variants at the GBA locus, encoding glucocerebrosidase, are the strongest common genetic risk factor for Parkinson’s disease (PD). To understand GBA-related disease mechanisms, we use a multi-part-enrichment proteomics and post-translational modification (PTM) workflow, identifying large numbers of dysregulated proteins and PTMs in heterozygous GBA-N370S PD patient induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) dopamine neurons. Alterations in glycosylation status show disturbances in the autophagy-lysosomal pathway, which concur with upstream perturbations in mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation in GBA-PD neurons. Several native and modified proteins encoded by PD-associated genes are dysregulated in GBA-PD neurons. Integrated pathway analysis reveals impaired neuritogenesis in GBA-PD neurons and identify tau as a key pathway mediator. Functional assays confirm neurite outgrowth deficits and identify impaired mitochondrial movement in GBA-PD neurons. Furthermore, pharmacological rescue of glucocerebrosidase activity in GBA-PD neurons improves the neurite outgrowth deficit. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of PTMomics to elucidate neurodegeneration-associated pathways and potential drug targets in complex disease models.

Abstract: Summary
Hyperactivity of pyramidal neurons (PNs) in CA1 is an early event in Alzheimer’s disease. However, factors accounting for the hyperactivity of CA1 PNs remain to be completely investigated. In the present study, we report that the serotonergic signaling is abnormal in the hippocampus of hAPP-J20 mice. Interestingly, chemogenetic activation of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) neurons in the median raphe nucleus (MRN) attenuates the activity of CA1 PNs in hAPP-J20 mice by regulating the intrinsic properties or inhibitory synaptic transmission of CA1 PNs through 5-HT3aR and/or 5-HT1aR. Furthermore, activating MRN 5-HT neurons improves memory in hAPP-J20 mice, and this effect is mediated by 5-HT3aR and 5-HT1aR. Direct activation of 5-HT3aR and 5-HT1aR with their selective agonists also improves the memory of hAPP-J20 mice.

Abstract: Summary
Unscheduled R loops can be a source of genome instability, a hallmark of cancer cells. Although targeted proteomic approaches and cellular analysis of specific mutants have uncovered factors potentially involved in R-loop homeostasis, we report a more open screening of factors whose depletion causes R loops based on the ability of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) to target R loops. Immunofluorescence analysis of γH2AX caused by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) covering 3,205 protein-coding genes identifies 59 potential candidates, from which 13 are analyzed further and show a significant increase of R loops. Such candidates are enriched in factors involved in chromatin, transcription, and RNA biogenesis and other processes. A more focused study shows that the DDX47 helicase is an R-loop resolvase, whereas the MeCP2 methyl-CpG-binding protein uncovers a link between DNA methylation and R loops. Thus, our results suggest that a plethora of gene dysfunctions can alter cell physiology via affecting R-loop homeostasis by different mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
Interleukin (IL)-10 is a main player in peripheral immune tolerance, the physiological mechanism preventing immune reactions to self/harmless antigens. Here, we investigate IL-10-induced molecular mechanisms generating tolerogenic dendritic cells (tolDC) from monocytes. Using genomic studies, we show that IL-10 induces a pattern of accessible enhancers exploited by aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) to promote expression of a set of core genes. We demonstrate that AHR activity occurs downstream of IL-10 signaling in myeloid cells and is required for the induction of tolerogenic activities in DC. Analyses of circulating DCs show that IL-10/AHR genomic signature is active in vivo in health. In multiple sclerosis patients, we instead observe significantly altered signature correlating with functional defects and reduced frequencies of IL-10-induced-tolDC in vitro and in vivo. Our studies identify molecular mechanisms controlling tolerogenic activities in human myeloid cells and may help in designing therapies to re-establish immune tolerance.

Abstract: Summary
The leading view in the somatosensory system indicates that area 3b serves as a cortical relay site that primarily encodes (cutaneous) tactile features limited to individual digits. Our recent work argues against this model by showing that area 3b cells can integrate both cutaneous and proprioceptive information from the hand. Here, we further test the validity of this model by studying multi-digit (MD) integration properties in area 3b. In contrast to the prevailing view, we show that most cells in area 3b have a receptive field (RF) that extends to multiple digits, with the size of the RF (i.e., the number of responsive digits) increasing across time. Further, we show that MD cells’ orientation angle preference is highly correlated across digits. Taken together, these data show that area 3b plays a larger role in generating neural representations of tactile objects, as opposed to just being a “feature detector” relay site.

Abstract: Summary
The phenotypic effect of any genetic variant can be altered by variation at other genomic loci. Known as epistasis, these genetic interactions shape the genotype-phenotype map of every species, yet their origins remain poorly understood. To investigate this, we employed high-throughput genome editing to measure the fitness effects of 1,826 naturally polymorphic variants in four strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. About 31% of variants affect fitness, of which 24% have strain-specific fitness effects indicative of epistasis. We found that beneficial variants are more likely to exhibit genetic interactions and that these interactions can be mediated by specific traits such as flocculation ability. This work suggests that adaptive evolution will often involve trade-offs where a variant is only beneficial in some genetic backgrounds, potentially explaining why many beneficial variants remain polymorphic. In sum, we provide a framework to understand the factors influencing epistasis with single-nucleotide resolution, revealing widespread epistasis among beneficial variants.

Abstract: Summary
The neuropeptide VGF was recently proposed as a neurodegeneration biomarker. The Parkinson’s disease-related protein leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) regulates endolysosomal dynamics, a process that involves SNARE-mediated membrane fusion and could regulate secretion. Here we investigate potential biochemical and functional links between LRRK2 and v-SNAREs. We find that LRRK2 directly interacts with the v-SNAREs VAMP4 and VAMP7. Secretomics reveals VGF secretory defects in VAMP4 and VAMP7 knockout (KO) neuronal cells. In contrast, VAMP2 KO “regulated secretion-null” and ATG5 KO “autophagy-null” cells release more VGF. VGF is partially associated with extracellular vesicles and LAMP1+ endolysosomes. LRRK2 expression increases VGF perinuclear localization and impairs its secretion. Retention using selective hooks (RUSH) assays show that a pool of VGF traffics through VAMP4+ and VAMP7+ compartments, and LRRK2 expression delays its transport to the cell periphery. Overexpression of LRRK2 or VAMP7-longin domain impairs VGF peripheral localization in primary cultured neurons. Altogether, our results suggest that LRRK2 might regulate VGF secretion via interaction with VAMP4 and VAMP7.

Abstract: Summary
PI3K regulatory subunit p85s normally stabilizes and regulates catalytic subunit p110s in the cytoplasm. Recent studies show that p110-free p85s in the nucleus plays important roles in biological processes. However, the mechanisms by which p85s translocate into the nucleus remain elusive. Here, we describe the mechanism by which p85β translocates into the nucleus to promote ccRCC tumorigenesis. Phosphorylation of p85β at the Y464 by FAK facilitates its nuclear translocation in the kidney through enhancing the binding of p85β to KPNA1. PIK3R2/p85β is highly expressed in ccRCC samples and associated with overall survival of ccRCC patients. Nuclear but not cytoplasmic p85β performs oncogenic functions by repressing RB1 expression and regulating the G1/S cell cycle transition. Nuclear p85β represses RB1 expression by stabilizing histone methyltransferase EZH1/EZH2 proteins. Last, the FAK inhibitor defactinib significantly suppresses the tumor growth of ccRCC with high p85β Y464 levels.

Abstract: Summary
Estrogen and progesterone have been extensively studied in the mammary gland, but the molecular effects of androgen remain largely unexplored. Transgender men are recorded as female at birth but identify as male and may undergo gender-affirming androgen therapy to align their physical characteristics and gender identity. Here we perform single-cell-resolution transcriptome, chromatin, and spatial profiling of breast tissues from transgender men following androgen therapy. We find canonical androgen receptor gene targets are upregulated in cells expressing the androgen receptor and that paracrine signaling likely drives sex-relevant androgenic effects in other cell types. We also observe involution of the epithelium and a spatial reconfiguration of immune, fibroblast, and vascular cells, and identify a gene regulatory network associated with androgen-induced fat loss. This work elucidates the molecular consequences of androgen activity in the human breast at single-cell resolution.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of arbutin (ARB) administration on oxidative stress, inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and apoptosis in an experimental testicular torsion/detorsion (T/D)-induced testicular injury model for the first time. A total of 24 male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups with six rats in each group: sham control, T/D, T/D+ARB (50 mg/kg) and T/D+ARB (100 mg/kg). Torsion and detorsion times were applied as 4 h and 2 h, respectively. The levels of lipid peroxidation [malondialdehyde (MDA)] and oxidative stress [total oxidant status (TOS) and total antioxidant status (TAS)] in testicular tissues were determined using colorimetric methods. The levels of DNA damage [8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG)], antioxidant system [superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT)], pro-inflammatory cytokines [high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), nuclear factor kappa B protein 65 (NF-κB p65), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and myeloperoxidase (MPO)], ER stress [78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP)] and apoptosis (caspase-3) markers in testicular tissues were determined using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. Johnsen's testicle scoring system was used for histological evaluation. In the T/D group, it was determined that statistically significant increasing in the levels of oxidative stress, inflammation, ER stress and apoptosis compared with sham control group (p < 0.05). ARB administrations statistically significantly restored testicular I/R damage in a dose dependent manner (p < 0.05). In addition, it was determined that the data of histological examinations supported the biochemical results. Our findings support the hypothesis that ARB may be used as a protective agent against T/D-induced testicular damage.

Abstract: Summary
Bispecific T cell engagers (TCEs) have shown promise in the treatment of various cancers, but the immunological mechanism and molecular determinants of primary and acquired resistance to TCEs remain poorly understood. Here, we identify conserved behaviors of bone marrow-residing T cells in multiple myeloma patients undergoing BCMAxCD3 TCE therapy. We show that the immune repertoire reacts to TCE therapy with cell state-dependent clonal expansion and find evidence supporting the coupling of tumor recognition via major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC class I), exhaustion, and clinical response. We find the abundance of exhausted-like CD8+ T cell clones to be associated with clinical response failure, and we describe loss of target epitope and MHC class I as tumor-intrinsic adaptations to TCEs. These findings advance our understanding of the in vivo mechanism of TCE treatment in humans and provide the rationale for predictive immune-monitoring and conditioning of the immune repertoire to guide future immunotherapy in hematological malignancies.

Abstract: Summary
A multitude of histone chaperones are required to support histones from their biosynthesis until DNA deposition. They cooperate through the formation of histone co-chaperone complexes, but the crosstalk between nucleosome assembly pathways remains enigmatic. Using exploratory interactomics, we define the interplay between human histone H3–H4 chaperones in the histone chaperone network. We identify previously uncharacterized histone-dependent complexes and predict the structure of the ASF1 and SPT2 co-chaperone complex, expanding the role of ASF1 in histone dynamics. We show that DAXX provides a unique functionality to the histone chaperone network, recruiting histone methyltransferases to promote H3K9me3 catalysis on new histone H3.3–H4 prior to deposition onto DNA. Hereby, DAXX provides a molecular mechanism for de novo H3K9me3 deposition and heterochromatin assembly. Collectively, our findings provide a framework for understanding how cells orchestrate histone supply and employ targeted deposition of modified histones to underpin specialized chromatin states.

Abstract: Summary
How canonical cytokinesis is altered during germ cell division to produce stable intercellular bridges, called “ring canals,” is poorly understood. Here, using time-lapse imaging in Drosophila, we observe that ring canal formation occurs through extensive remodeling of the germ cell midbody, a structure classically associated with its function in recruiting abscission-regulating proteins in complete cytokinesis. Germ cell midbody cores reorganize and join the midbody ring rather than being discarded, and this transition is accompanied by changes in centralspindlin dynamics. The midbody-to-ring canal transformation is conserved in the Drosophila male and female germlines and during mouse and Hydra spermatogenesis. In Drosophila, ring canal formation depends on Citron kinase function to stabilize the midbody, similar to its role during somatic cell cytokinesis. Our results provide important insights into the broader functions of incomplete cytokinesis events across biological systems, such as those observed during development and disease states.

Abstract: Summary
A better understanding of transcriptional evolution of IDH-wild-type glioblastoma may be crucial for treatment optimization. Here, we perform RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) (n = 322 test, n = 245 validation) on paired primary-recurrent glioblastoma resections of patients treated with the current standard of care. Transcriptional subtypes form an interconnected continuum in a two-dimensional space. Recurrent tumors show preferential mesenchymal progression. Over time, hallmark glioblastoma genes are not significantly altered. Instead, tumor purity decreases over time and is accompanied by co-increases in neuron and oligodendrocyte marker genes and, independently, tumor-associated macrophages. A decrease is observed in endothelial marker genes. These composition changes are confirmed by single-cell RNA-seq and immunohistochemistry. An extracellular matrix-associated gene set increases at recurrence and bulk, single-cell RNA, and immunohistochemistry indicate it is expressed mainly by pericytes. This signature is associated with significantly worse survival at recurrence. Our data demonstrate that glioblastomas evolve mainly by microenvironment (re-)organization rather than molecular evolution of tumor cells.

Abstract: Recently, interest in three-dimensional (3D) cell or tissue organoids that may, in vitro, overcome not only the practical problems associated with fetal tissue transplantation, but also provide a potential source for the regeneration of injured spinal cords, has been increasing steadily. In this study, we showed that human neural precursor cells (hNPCs) derived from the fetal spinal cord could be incubated in serum free medium at two dimensional (2D), three dimensional (3D) and tissue organoid-systems. Additionally, we investigated morphological changes over time along with the expression of proteoglycans, collagen, or myelin in 2D, 3D and tissue-like organoids. 2D cells exhibited a spindle-shaped morphology with classic hill and valley growth patterns, while 3D cells grew as clusters of undifferentiated cells and cell sheets (tissue organoids) that gradually rolled up like a carpet without forming a circular cell mass. Immunostaining was performed to demonstrate the expression of TUJ-1, MAP-2, GAD 65/67 and ChAT in 2D cells or tissue-like organoids, which stained positively for them. In addition, we observed the immunoreactivity of HNu, NG2, TUJ-1, and GFAP in tissue-like organoids. The organoid culture system studied in our work may be used as therapeutic agents for spinal cord injury (SCI), and as raw materials needed for development of new medicines to improve human responses and cure diseases.

Abstract: Activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) by lipid oxidation products, including lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC), increases the externalization of canonical transient receptor potential 6 (TRPC6) channels leading to a subsequent increase in intracellular calcium that contributes to cytoskeletal changes which inhibit endothelial cell (EC) migration in vitro and impair EC healing of arterial injuries in vivo. The PI3K p110α and p110δ catalytic subunit isoforms regulate lysoPC-induced TRPC6 externalization in vitro, but have many other functions. The goal of the current study is to identify the PI3K regulatory subunit isoform involved in TRPC6 externalization to potentially identify a more specific treatment regimen to improve EC migration and arterial healing, while minimizing off-target effects. Decreasing the p85α regulatory subunit isoform protein levels, but not the p85β and p55γ regulatory subunit isoforms, with small interfering RNA inhibits lysoPC-induced translocation of the PI3K catalytic subunit to the plasma membrane, dramatically decreased phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) production and TRPC6 externalization, and significantly improves EC migration in the presence of lysoPC. These results identify the important and specific role of p85α in controlling translocation of PI3K from the cytosol to the plasma membrane and PI3K-mediated TRPC externalization by oxidized lipids. Current PI3K inhibitors block the catalytic subunit, but our data suggest that the regulatory subunit is a novel therapeutic target to promote EC migration and healing after arterial injuries that occur with angioplasty.

Abstract: Summary
RNA virus infection usually triggers a range of host immune responses, including the induction of proinflammatory cytokines, interferons, and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Here, we report that UBL7, a ubiquitin-like protein, is upregulated during RNA virus infection and induced by type I interferon as an ISG. UBL7-deficient mice exhibit increased susceptibility to viral infection due to attenuated antiviral innate immunity. UBL7 enhances innate immune response to viral infection by promoting the K27-linked polyubiquitination of MAVS. UBL7 interacts with TRIM21, an E3 ubiquitin ligase of MAVS, and promotes the combination of TRIM21 with MAVS in a dose-dependent manner, facilitating the K27-linked polyubiquitination of MAVS and recruiting of TBK1 to enhance the IFN signaling pathway. Moreover, UBL7 has a broad-spectrum antiviral function as an immunomodulatory adaptor protein. Therefore, UBL7 positively regulates innate antiviral signaling and promotes positive feedback to enhance and amplify the antiviral response.

Abstract: Summary
Thalamoreticular circuitry plays a key role in arousal, attention, cognition, and sleep spindles, and is linked to several brain disorders. A detailed computational model of mouse somatosensory thalamus and thalamic reticular nucleus has been developed to capture the properties of over 14,000 neurons connected by 6 million synapses. The model recreates the biological connectivity of these neurons, and simulations of the model reproduce multiple experimental findings in different brain states. The model shows that inhibitory rebound produces frequency-selective enhancement of thalamic responses during wakefulness. We find that thalamic interactions are responsible for the characteristic waxing and waning of spindle oscillations. In addition, we find that changes in thalamic excitability control spindle frequency and their incidence.

Abstract: Summary
The most abundant cellular divalent cations, Mg2+ (mM) and Ca2+ (nM-μM), antagonistically regulate divergent metabolic pathways with several orders of magnitude affinity preference, but the physiological significance of this competition remains elusive. In mice consuming a Western diet, genetic ablation of the mitochondrial Mg2+ channel Mrs2 prevents weight gain, enhances mitochondrial activity, decreases fat accumulation in the liver, and causes prominent browning of white adipose. Mrs2 deficiency restrains citrate efflux from the mitochondria, making it unavailable to support de novo lipogenesis. As citrate is an endogenous Mg2+ chelator, this may represent an adaptive response to a perceived deficit of the cation. Transcriptional profiling of liver and white adipose reveals higher expression of genes involved in glycolysis, β-oxidation, thermogenesis, and HIF-1α-targets, in Mrs2−/− mice that are further enhanced under Western-diet-associated metabolic stress. Thus, lowering mMg2+ promotes metabolism and dampens diet-induced obesity and metabolic syndrome.

Abstract: Summary
Programmed cell suicide of infected bacteria, known as abortive infection (Abi), serves as an immune defense strategy to prevent the propagation of bacteriophage viruses. Many Abi systems utilize bespoke cyclic nucleotide immune messengers generated upon infection to mobilize cognate death effectors. Here, we identify a family of bacteriophage nucleotidyltransferases (NTases) that synthesize competitor cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) ligands and inhibit TIR NADase effectors activated via a linked STING CDN sensor domain (TIR-STING). Through a functional screen of NTase-adjacent phage genes, we uncover candidate inhibitors of cell suicide induced by heterologous expression of tonically active TIR-STING. Among these, we demonstrate that a virus MazG-like nucleotide pyrophosphohydrolase, Atd1, depletes the starvation alarmone (p)ppGpp, revealing a potential role for the alarmone-activated host toxin MazF as an executioner of TIR-driven Abi. Phage NTases and counterdefenses like Atd1 preserve host viability to ensure virus propagation and represent tools to modulate TIR and STING immune responses.

Abstract: Summary
Macrophages facilitate critical functions in regulating pathogen clearance and immune homeostasis in tissues. The remarkable functional diversity exhibited by macrophage subsets is dependent on tissue environment and the nature of the pathological insult. Our current knowledge of the mechanisms that regulate the multifaceted counter-inflammatory responses mediated by macrophages remains incomplete. Here, we report that CD169+ macrophage subsets are necessary for protection under excessive inflammatory conditions. We show that in the absence of these macrophages, even under mild septic conditions, mice fail to survive and exhibit increased production of inflammatory cytokines. Mechanistically, CD169+ macrophages control inflammatory responses via interleukin-10 (IL-10), as CD169+ macrophage-specific deletion of IL-10 was lethal during septic conditions, and recombinant IL-10 treatment reduced lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lethality in mice lacking CD169+ macrophages. Collectively, our findings show a pivotal homeostatic role for CD169+ macrophages and suggest they may serve as an important target for therapy under damaging inflammatory conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Notch-dependent binary fate choice between sister neurons is one of the mechanisms to generate neural diversity. How these upstream neural fate specification programs regulate downstream effector genes to control axon targeting and neuropil assembly remains less well understood. Here, we report that Notch-dependent binary fate choice in Drosophila medulla neurons is required to regulate the Netrin axon guidance pathway, which controls targeting of transmedullary (Tm) neurons to lobula. In medulla neurons of Notch-on hemilineage composed of mostly lobula-targeting neurons, Notch signaling is required to activate the expression of Netrin-B and repress the expression of its repulsive receptor Unc-5. Turning off Unc-5 is necessary for Tm neurons to target lobula. Furthermore, Netrin-B provided by Notch-on medulla neurons is required for correct targeting of Tm axons from later-generated medulla columns. Thus, the coordinate regulation of Netrin pathway components by Notch signaling ensures correct targeting of Tm axons and contributes to the neuropil assembly.

Abstract: Summary
The E4 allele of Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is associated with both metabolic dysfunction and a heightened pro-inflammatory response: two findings that may be intrinsically linked through the concept of immunometabolism. Here, we combined bulk, single-cell, and spatial transcriptomics with cell-specific and spatially resolved metabolic analyses in mice expressing human APOE to systematically address the role of APOE across age, neuroinflammation, and AD pathology. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) highlighted immunometabolic changes across the APOE4 glial transcriptome, specifically in subsets of metabolically distinct microglia enriched in the E4 brain during aging or following an inflammatory challenge. E4 microglia display increased Hif1α expression and a disrupted tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and are inherently pro-glycolytic, while spatial transcriptomics and mass spectrometry imaging highlight an E4-specific response to amyloid that is characterized by widespread alterations in lipid metabolism. Taken together, our findings emphasize a central role for APOE in regulating microglial immunometabolism and provide valuable, interactive resources for discovery and validation research.

Abstract: Summary
Nonsense mutations create premature termination codons (PTCs), activating the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway to degrade most PTC-containing mRNAs. The undegraded mRNA is translated, but translation terminates at the PTC, leading to no production of the full-length protein. This work presents targeted PTC pseudouridylation, an approach for nonsense suppression in human cells. Specifically, an artificial box H/ACA guide RNA designed to target the mRNA PTC can suppress both NMD and premature translation termination in various sequence contexts. Targeted pseudouridylation exhibits a level of suppression comparable with that of aminoglycoside antibiotic treatments. When targeted pseudouridylation is combined with antibiotic treatment, a much higher level of suppression is observed. Transfection of a disease model cell line (carrying a chromosomal PTC) with a designer guide RNA gene targeting the PTC also leads to nonsense suppression. Thus, targeted pseudouridylation is an RNA-directed gene-specific approach that suppresses NMD and concurrently promotes PTC readthrough.

Abstract: Summary
Plant leaves feature epidermal stomata that are organized in stereotyped patterns. How does the pattern originate? We provide transcriptomic, imaging, and genetic evidence that Arabidopsis embryos engage known stomatal fate and patterning factors to create regularly spaced stomatal precursor cells. Analysis of embryos from 36 plant species indicates that this trait is widespread among angiosperms. Embryonic stomatal patterning in Arabidopsis is established in three stages: first, broad SPEECHLESS (SPCH) expression; second, coalescence of SPCH and its targets into discrete domains; and third, one round of asymmetric division to create stomatal precursors. Lineage progression is then halted until after germination. We show that the embryonic stomatal pattern enables fast stomatal differentiation and photosynthetic activity upon germination, but it also guides the formation of additional stomata as the leaf expands. In addition, key stomatal regulators are prevented from driving the fate transitions they can induce after germination, identifying stage-specific layers of regulation that control lineage progression during embryogenesis.

Abstract: In males, the function of the pubococcygeus muscle (Pcm) shows a high androgen dependency. High sucrose intake increases testosterone levels in pubertal male rats. We aimed to analyze the Pcm reflex activity and fiber type in response to a 30 % sucrose diet. Wistar male rats were assigned into two groups: control and sugar. The Pcm electromyographic activity was recorded during the mechanical stimulation of the scrotal skin and penis. We also determined the relative levels of Glut4 expression, glycogen content, myofiber cross-sectional area (CSA), and the content of glycolytic and oxidative with NADH-TR or fast, intermediate, and slow fibers with alkaline (pH 9.4) ATPase histochemistry. The sugar group showed a short Pcm reflex activity, a higher Glut4 expression, and glycogen content; the CSA fibers showed a significant difference in the percentage of fibers with the different transversal areas. The number of nuclei was positively correlated with the CSA of the Pcm fibers. There was also a decrease in oxidative fibers but an increase in glycolytic fibers, while the content of fast muscle fibers increased to the detriment of intermediate and slow fibers. Thus, a high-sugar diet reduced Pcm reflex activity, fiber type, and dysregulation of skeletal muscle energy metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is the central enzyme connecting glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The importance of PDH function in T helper 17 (Th17) cells still remains to be studied. Here, we show that PDH is essential for the generation of a glucose-derived citrate pool needed for Th17 cell proliferation, survival, and effector function. In vivo, mice harboring a T cell-specific deletion of PDH are less susceptible to developing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Mechanistically, the absence of PDH in Th17 cells increases glutaminolysis, glycolysis, and lipid uptake in a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent manner. However, cellular citrate remains critically low in mutant Th17 cells, which interferes with oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), lipid synthesis, and histone acetylation, crucial for transcription of Th17 signature genes. Increasing cellular citrate in PDH-deficient Th17 cells restores their metabolism and function, identifying a metabolic feedback loop within the central carbon metabolism that may offer possibilities for therapeutically targeting Th17 cell-driven autoimmunity.

Abstract: Summary
Transcriptional enhancers have been extensively characterized, but cis-regulatory elements involved in acute gene repression have received less attention. Transcription factor GATA1 promotes erythroid differentiation by activating and repressing distinct gene sets. Here, we study the mechanism by which GATA1 silences the proliferative gene Kit during murine erythroid cell maturation and define stages from initial loss of activation to heterochromatinization. We find that GATA1 inactivates a potent upstream enhancer but concomitantly creates a discrete intronic regulatory region marked by H3K27ac, short noncoding RNAs, and de novo chromatin looping. This enhancer-like element forms transiently and serves to delay Kit silencing. The element is ultimately erased via the FOG1/NuRD deacetylase complex, as revealed by the study of a disease-associated GATA1 variant. Hence, regulatory sites can be self-limiting by dynamic co-factor usage. Genome-wide analyses across cell types and species uncover transiently active elements at numerous genes during repression, suggesting that modulation of silencing kinetics is widespread.

Abstract: Summary
The glucagon-PKA signal is generally believed to control hepatic gluconeogenesis via the CREB transcription factor. Here we uncovered a distinct function of this signal in directly stimulating histone phosphorylation for gluconeogenic gene regulation in mice. In the fasting state, CREB recruited activated PKA to regions near gluconeogenic genes, where PKA phosphorylated histone H3 serine 28 (H3S28ph). H3S28ph, recognized by 14-3-3ζ, promoted recruitment of RNA polymerase II and transcriptional stimulation of gluconeogenic genes. In contrast, in the fed state, more PP2A was found near gluconeogenic genes, which counteracted PKA by dephosphorylating H3S28ph and repressing transcription. Importantly, ectopic expression of phosphomimic H3S28 efficiently restored gluconeogenic gene expression when liver PKA or CREB was depleted. These results together highlight a different functional scheme in regulating gluconeogenesis by the glucagon-PKA-CREB-H3S28ph cascade, in which the hormone signal is transmitted to chromatin for rapid and efficient gluconeogenic gene activation.

Abstract: Summary
Maintaining persistent migration in complex environments is critical for neutrophils to reach infection sites. Neutrophils avoid getting trapped, even when obstacles split their front into multiple leading edges. How they re-establish polarity to move productively while incorporating receptor inputs under such conditions remains unclear. Here, we challenge chemotaxing HL60 neutrophil-like cells with symmetric bifurcating microfluidic channels to probe cell-intrinsic processes during the resolution of competing fronts. Using supervised statistical learning, we demonstrate that cells commit to one leading edge late in the process, rather than amplifying structural asymmetries or early fluctuations. Using optogenetic tools, we show that receptor inputs only bias the decision similarly late, once mechanical stretching begins to weaken each front. Finally, a retracting edge commits to retraction, with ROCK limiting sensitivity to receptor inputs until the retraction completes. Collectively, our results suggest that cell edges locally adopt highly stable protrusion/retraction programs that are modulated by mechanical feedback.

Abstract: Summary
DNA N6-methyladenine (6mA) is an epigenetic modification that regulates various biological processes. Here, we show that gastric cancer (GC) cells and tumors display a marked reduction in 6mA levels compared with normal gastric tissues and cells. 6mA is abundant in the surrounding transcription start sites and occurs at consensus motifs. Among the 6mA regulators, ALKBH1, a demethylase, is significantly overexpressed in GC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. Moreover, high ALKBH1 expression is associated with poor survival of patients with GC. ALKBH1 knockout in mice impairs chemically induced gastric carcinogenesis. Mechanistically, ALKBH1 mediates DNA 6mA demethylation to repress gene expression. In particular, the 6mA sites are enriched in NRF1 binding sequences and targeted for demethylation by ALKBH1. ALKBH1-induced 6mA demethylation inhibits NRF1-driven transcription of downstream targets, including multiple genes involved in the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway. Accordingly, ALKBH1 suppresses AMPK signaling, causing a metabolic shift toward the Warburg effect, which facilitates tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The enteric nervous system (ENS) consists of glial cells (EGCs) and neurons derived from neural crest precursors. EGCs retain capacity for large-scale neurogenesis in culture, and in vivo lineage tracing has identified neurons derived from glial cells in response to inflammation. We thus hypothesize that EGCs possess a chromatin structure poised for neurogenesis. We use single-cell multiome sequencing to simultaneously assess transcription and chromatin accessibility in EGCs undergoing spontaneous neurogenesis in culture, as well as small intestine myenteric plexus EGCs. Cultured EGCs maintain open chromatin at genomic loci accessible in neurons, and neurogenesis from EGCs involves dynamic chromatin rearrangements with a net decrease in accessible chromatin. A subset of in vivo EGCs, highly enriched within the myenteric ganglia and that persist into adulthood, have a gene expression program and chromatin state consistent with neurogenic potential. These results clarify the mechanisms underlying EGC potential for neuronal fate transition.

Abstract: Summary
It is widely believed that hematopoiesis after birth is established by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow and that HSC-independent hematopoiesis is limited only to primitive erythro-myeloid cells and tissue-resident innate immune cells arising in the embryo. Here, surprisingly, we find that significant percentages of lymphocytes are not derived from HSCs, even in 1-year-old mice. Instead, multiple waves of hematopoiesis occur from embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5) to E11.5 endothelial cells, which simultaneously produce HSCs and lymphoid progenitors that constitute many layers of adaptive T and B lymphocytes in adult mice. Additionally, HSC lineage tracing reveals that the contribution of fetal liver HSCs to peritoneal B-1a cells is minimal and that the majority of B-1a cells are HSC independent. Our discovery of extensive HSC-independent lymphocytes in adult mice attests to the complex blood developmental dynamics spanning the embryo-to-adult transition and challenges the paradigm of HSCs exclusively underpinning the postnatal immune system.

Abstract: Summary
Repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) elicits three-dimensional (3D) chromatin topological changes. A recent finding reveals that 53BP1 assembles into a 3D chromatin topology pattern around DSBs. How this formation of a higher-order structure is configured and regulated remains enigmatic. Here, we report that SLFN5 is a critical factor for 53BP1 topological arrangement at DSBs. Using super-resolution imaging, we find that SLFN5 binds to 53BP1 chromatin domains to assemble a higher-order microdomain architecture by driving damaged chromatin dynamics at both DSBs and deprotected telomeres. Mechanistically, we propose that 53BP1 topology is shaped by two processes: (1) chromatin mobility driven by the SLFN5-LINC-microtubule axis and (2) the assembly of 53BP1 oligomers mediated by SLFN5. In mammals, SLFN5 deficiency disrupts the DSB repair topology and impairs non-homologous end joining, telomere fusions, class switch recombination, and sensitivity to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor. We establish a molecular mechanism that shapes higher-order chromatin topologies to safeguard genomic stability.

Abstract: Summary
Distinct locations of different white adipose depots suggest anatomy-specific developmental regulation, a relatively understudied concept. Here, we report a population of Tcf21 lineage cells (Tcf21 LCs) present exclusively in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) that dynamically contributes to VAT development and expansion. During development, the Tcf21 lineage gives rise to adipocytes. In adult mice, Tcf21 LCs transform into a fibrotic or quiescent state. Multiomics analyses show consistent gene expression and chromatin accessibility changes in Tcf21 LC, based on which we constructed a gene-regulatory network governing Tcf21 LC activities. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) identifies the heterogeneity of Tcf21 LCs. Loss of Tcf21 promotes the adipogenesis and developmental progress of Tcf21 LCs, leading to improved metabolic health in the context of diet-induced obesity. Mechanistic studies show that the inhibitory effect of Tcf21 on adipogenesis is at least partially mediated via Dlk1 expression accentuation.

Abstract: Summary
Naive CD4+ T cells are more resistant to age-related loss than naive CD8+ T cells, suggesting mechanisms that preferentially protect naive CD4+ T cells during aging. Here, we show that TRIB2 is more abundant in naive CD4+ than CD8+ T cells and counteracts quiescence exit by suppressing AKT activation. TRIB2 deficiency increases AKT activity and accelerates proliferation and differentiation in response to interleukin-7 (IL-7) in humans and during lymphopenia in mice. TRIB2 transcription is controlled by the lineage-determining transcription factors ThPOK and RUNX3. Ablation of Zbtb7b (encoding ThPOK) and Cbfb (obligatory RUNT cofactor) attenuates the difference in lymphopenia-induced proliferation between naive CD4+ and CD8+ cells. In older adults, ThPOK and TRIB2 expression wanes in naive CD4+ T cells, causing loss of naivety. These findings assign TRIB2 a key role in regulating T cell homeostasis and provide a model to explain the lesser resilience of CD8+ T cells to undergo changes with age.

Abstract: Summary
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive brain tumor, with a median survival of ∼15 months. Targeted approaches have not been successful in this tumor type due to the large extent of intratumor heterogeneity. Mosaic amplification of oncogenes suggests that multiple genetically distinct clones are present in each tumor. To uncover the relationships between genetically diverse subpopulations of GBM cells and their native tumor microenvironment, we employ highly multiplexed spatial protein profiling coupled with single-cell spatial mapping of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for EGFR, CDK4, and PDGFRA. Single-cell FISH analysis of a total of 35,843 single nuclei reveals that tumors in which amplifications of EGFR and CDK4 more frequently co-occur in the same cell exhibit higher infiltration of CD163+ immunosuppressive macrophages. Our results suggest that high-throughput assessment of genomic alterations at the single-cell level could provide a measure for predicting the immune state of GBM.

Abstract: Summary
The immune microenvironment in breast cancer (BCa) is controlled by a complex network of communication between various cell types. Here, we find that recruitment of B lymphocytes to BCa tissues is controlled via mechanisms associated with cancer cell-derived extracellular vesicles (CCD-EVs). Gene expression profiling identifies the Liver X receptor (LXR)-dependent transcriptional network as a key pathway that controls both CCD-EVs-induced migration of B cells and accumulation of B cells in BCa tissues. The increased accumulation oxysterol ligands for LXR (i.e., 25-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol) in CCD-EVs is regulated by the tetraspanin 6 (Tspan6). Tspan6 stimulates the chemoattractive potential of BCa cells for B cells in an EV- and LXR-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that tetraspanins control intercellular trafficking of oxysterols via CCD-EVs. Furthermore, tetraspanin-dependent changes in the oxysterol composition of CCD-EVs and the LXR signaling axis play a key role in specific changes in the tumor immune microenvironment.

Abstract: Summary
Limb development has long served as a model system for coordinated spatial patterning of progenitor cells. Here, we identify a population of naive limb progenitors and show that they differentiate progressively to form the skeleton in a complex, non-consecutive, three-dimensional pattern. Single-cell RNA sequencing of the developing mouse forelimb identified three progenitor states: naive, proximal, and autopodial, as well as Msx1 as a marker for the naive progenitors. In vivo lineage tracing confirmed this role and localized the naive progenitors to the outer margin of the limb, along the anterior-posterior axis. Sequential pulse-chase experiments showed that the progressive transition of Msx1+ naive progenitors into proximal and autopodial progenitors coincides with their differentiation to Sox9+ chondroprogenitors, which occurs along all the forming skeletal segments. Indeed, tracking the spatiotemporal sequence of differentiation showed that the skeleton forms progressively in a complex pattern. These findings suggest an alternative model for limb skeleton development.

Abstract: Intracellular calcium (Ca2+) is an essential second messenger in eukaryotic cells regulating numerous cellular functions such as contraction, secretion, immunity, growth, and metabolism. Ca2+ signaling is also a key signal transducer in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. The store-operated Ca2+ entry pathway (SOCE) is ubiquitously expressed in eukaryotic cells, and is the primary Ca2+ influx pathway in non-excitable cells. SOCE is mediated by the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ sensing STIM proteins, and the plasma membrane Ca2+-selective Orai channels. A growing number of studies have implicated SOCE in regulating cell death primarily via the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in a variety of tissues and in response to physiological stressors such as traumatic brain injury, ischemia reperfusion injury, sepsis, and alcohol toxicity. Notably, the literature points to excessive cytosolic Ca2+ influx through SOCE in vulnerable cells as a key factor tipping the balance towards cellular apoptosis. While the literature primarily addresses the functions of STIM1 and Orai1, STIM2, Orai2 and Orai3 are also emerging as potential regulators of cell death. Here, we review the functions of STIM and Orai proteins in regulating cell death and the implications of this regulation to human pathologies.

Abstract: Background
Osteoarthritis is a main cause of deformity in aging people. The chondrogenesis of human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) has a positive effect on the cure of osteoarthritis. However, the regulatory mechanism of hADSC chondrogenesis still needs further exploration. This research investigates the role of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) in the chondrogenesis of hADSCs.
Methods
hADSCs were purchased and cultured. The interaction between IRF1 and hypoxia inducible lipid droplet associated (HILPDA) was predicted by bioinformatics analysis, and verified through dual-luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. The expressions of IRF1 and HILPDA in osteoarthritis cartilage samples were measured through qRT-PCR. After hADSCs were transfected or further induced for chondrogenesis, the chondrogenesis was visualized by Alcian blue staining, and the expressions of IRF1, HILPDA and chondrogenesis-related factors (SOX9, Aggrecan, COL2A1, MMP13, MMP3) were determined through qRT-PCR or Western blot.
Results
HILPDA bound to IRF1 in hADSCs. IRF1 and HILPDA levels were up-regulated during the chondrogenesis of hADSCs. Overexpressions of IRF1 and HILPDA promoted the chondrogenesis of hADSCs with the up-regulation of SOX9, Aggrecan and COL2A1 and the down-regulation of MMP13 and MMP3; however, IRF1 silencing generated the opposite effects. Besides, HILPDA overexpression reversed the effects of IRF1 silencing on inhibiting chondrogenesis of hADSCs and regulating the expressions of chondrogenesis-related factors.
Conclusion
IRF1 promotes the chondrogenesis of hADSCs through up-regulating HILPDA level, providing novel biomarkers for treating osteoarthritis.

Abstract: Summary
Tissue development and homeostasis depend on the balance between growth and terminal differentiation, but the mechanisms coordinating these processes remain elusive. Accumulating evidence indicates that ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) and protein synthesis, two cellular processes sustaining growth, are tightly regulated and yet can be uncoupled during stem cell differentiation. Using the Drosophila adult female germline stem cell and larval neuroblast systems, we show that Mei-P26 and Brat, two Drosophila TRIM-NHL paralogs, are responsible for uncoupling RiBi and protein synthesis during differentiation. In differentiating cells, Mei-P26 and Brat activate the target of rapamycin (Tor) kinase to promote translation, while concomitantly repressing RiBi. Depletion of Mei-P26 or Brat results in defective terminal differentiation, which can be rescued by ectopic activation of Tor together with suppression of RiBi. Our results indicate that uncoupling RiBi and translation activities by TRIM-NHL activity creates the conditions required for terminal differentiation.

Abstract: Histidine methylation serves as an intriguing strategy to introduce altered traits of target proteins, including metal ion chelation, histidine-based catalysis, molecular assembly, and translation regulation. As a newly identified histidine methyltransferase, METTL9 catalyzes N1-methylation of protein substrates containing the “His-x-His” motif (HxH, x denotes small side chain residue). Here our structural and biochemical studies revealed that METTL9 specifically methylates the second histidine of the “HxH” motif, while exploiting the first one as a recognition signature. We observed an intimate engagement between METTL9 and a pentapeptide motif, where the small “x” residue is embedded and confined within the substrate pocket. Upon complex formation, the N3 atom of histidine imidazole ring is stabilized by an aspartate residue such that the N1 atom is presented to S-adenosylmethionine for methylation. Moreover, METTL9 displayed a feature in preferred consecutive and “C-to-N” directional methylation of tandem “HxH” repeats that exist in many METTL9 substrates. Collectively, our work illustrates the molecular design of METTL9 in N1-specific methylation of the broadly existing “HxH” motifs, highlighting its importance in histidine methylation biology.

Abstract: Summary
It is widely known that stimulator of interferon genes (STING) can trigger nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling. However, whether and how the NF-κB pathway affects STING signaling remains largely unclear. Here, we report that Toll-like receptor (TLR)-, interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R)-, tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-, growth factor receptor (GF-R)-, and protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated NF-κB signaling activation dramatically enhances STING-mediated immune responses. Mechanistically, we find that STING interacts with microtubules, which plays a crucial role in STING intracellular trafficking. We further uncover that activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway induces microtubule depolymerization, which inhibits STING trafficking to lysosomes for degradation. This leads to increased levels of activated STING that persist for a longer period of time. The synergy between NF-κB and STING triggers a cascade-amplified interferon response and robust host antiviral defense. In addition, we observe that several gain-of-function mutations of STING abolish the microtubule-STING interaction and cause abnormal STING trafficking and ligand-independent STING autoactivation. Collectively, our data demonstrate that NF-κB activation enhances STING signaling by regulating microtubule-mediated STING trafficking.

Abstract: Summary
Waning immunity and emerging variants necessitate continued vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Improvements in vaccine safety, tolerability, and ease of manufacturing would benefit these efforts. Here, we develop a potent and easily manufactured nanoparticle vaccine displaying the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD). Computational design to stabilize the RBD, eliminate glycosylation, and focus the immune response to neutralizing epitopes results in an RBD immunogen that resolves issues hindering the efficient nanoparticle display of the native RBD. This non-glycosylated RBD can be genetically fused to diverse single-component nanoparticle platforms, maximizing manufacturing ease and flexibility. All engineered RBD nanoparticles elicit potently neutralizing antibodies in mice that far exceed monomeric RBDs. A 60-copy particle (noNAG-RBD-E2p) also elicits potently neutralizing antibodies in non-human primates. The neutralizing antibody titers elicited by noNAG-RBD-E2p are comparable to a benchmark stabilized spike antigen and reach levels against Omicron BA.5 that suggest that it would provide protection against emerging variants.

Abstract: Summary
Finger dexterity is manifested by coordinated patterns of muscle activity and generalization of learning across contexts. Some fingers flex, others extend, and some are immobile. Whether or not the neural control processes of these direction-specific actions are independent remains unclear. We characterized behavioral principles underlying learning and generalization of dexterous flexion and extension movements, within and across hands, using an isometric dexterity task that precisely measured finger individuation, force accuracy, and temporal synchronization. Two cohorts of participants trained for 3 days in either the flexion or extension direction. All dexterity measures in both groups showed post-training improvement, although finger extension exhibited inferior dexterity. Surprisingly, learning of finger extension generalized to the untrained flexion direction, but not vice versa. This flexion bias was also evident in the untrained hand. Our study indicates direction-specific control circuits for learning of finger flexion and extension that interact by partially, but asymmetrically, transferring between directions.

Abstract: Summary
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has had a tremendous impact worldwide. Mapping virus-host interactions is critical to understand disease progression. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important RNA regulators, but their interaction with SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not experimentally investigated. Here, using Argonaute (AGO) cross-linking immunoprecipitation combined with RNA proximity ligation (CLEAR-CLIP), we provide unbiased mapping of SARS-CoV-2/miRNA interactions. We identified six main regions on the viral RNA bound primarily by one specific miRNA. Targeted mutagenesis and AGO1-3 knockdown demonstrated that these interactions are not critical for virus production. Moreover, we identified perturbed regulation of cellular miRNA interactions during infection, including non-compensated viral sequestration of the miR-15 family. Transcriptome analysis further showed that mRNAs targeted by this miRNA family are derepressed. This work delineates the interphase between miRNA regulation and SARS-CoV-2 infection and further contributes to deciphering the full molecular interactome of this virus.

Abstract: Summary
In developing embryos, specific cell populations are often removed to remodel tissue architecture for organogenesis. During urinary tract development, an epithelial duct called the common nephric duct (CND) gets shortened and eventually eliminated to remodel the entry point of the ureter into the bladder. Here we show that non-professional efferocytosis (the process in which epithelial cells engulf apoptotic bodies) is the main mechanism that contributes to CND shortening. Combining biological metrics and computational modeling, we show that efferocytosis with actomyosin contractility are essential factors that drive the CND shortening without compromising the ureter-bladder structural connection. The disruption of either apoptosis, non-professional efferocytosis, or actomyosin results in contractile tension reduction and deficient CND shortening. Actomyosin activity helps to maintain tissue architecture while non-professional efferocytosis removes cellular volume. Together our results demonstrate that non-professional efferocytosis with actomyosin contractility are important morphogenetic factors controlling CND morphogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The Krebs cycle-derived metabolite itaconate, whose production is catalyzed by immune response gene 1 (IRG1), has potential to link immunity and metabolism in activated macrophages through alkylation or competitive inhibition of target proteins. In support of this, our previous study demonstrated that the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling platform functions as a hub in macrophage immunity and has a profound impact on the prognosis of sepsis. Interestingly, we find that itaconate, an endogenous immunomodulator, can significantly inhibit the activation of STING signaling. Moreover, 4-octyl itaconate (4-OI), which is a permeable itaconate derivative, can alkylate cysteine sites 65, 71, 88, and 147 of STING, thereby inhibiting its phosphorylation. Furthermore, itaconate and 4-OI inhibit the production of inflammatory factors in sepsis models. Our results broaden the knowledge on the role of the IRG1-itaconate axis in immunomodulation and highlight itaconate and its derivatives as potential therapeutic agents in sepsis.

Abstract: Summary
Corticospinal tract (CST) neurons innervate the deep spinal dorsal horn to sustain chronic neuropathic pain. The majority of neurons targeted by the CST are interneurons expressing the transcription factor c-Maf. Here, we used intersectional genetics to decipher the function of these neurons in dorsal horn sensory circuits. We find that excitatory c-Maf (c-MafEX) neurons receive sensory input mainly from myelinated fibers and target deep dorsal horn parabrachial projection neurons and superficial dorsal horn neurons, thereby connecting non-nociceptive input to nociceptive output structures. Silencing c-MafEX neurons has little effect in healthy mice but alleviates mechanical hypersensitivity in neuropathic mice. c-MafEX neurons also receive input from inhibitory c-Maf and parvalbumin neurons, and compromising inhibition by these neurons caused mechanical hypersensitivity and spontaneous aversive behaviors reminiscent of c-MafEX neuron activation. Our study identifies c-MafEX neurons as normally silent second-order nociceptors that become engaged in pathological pain signaling upon loss of inhibitory control.

Abstract: Summary
Apical-basal polarity and cell-fate determinants are crucial for the cell fate and control of stem cell numbers. However, their interplay leading to a precise stem cell number remains unclear. Drosophila pupal intestinal stem cells (pISCs) asymmetrically divide, generating one apical ISC progenitor and one basal Prospero (Pros)+ enteroendocrine mother cell (EMC), followed by symmetric divisions of each daughter before adulthood, providing an ideal system to investigate the outcomes of polarity loss. Using lineage tracing and ex vivo live imaging, we identify an interlocked polarity regulation network precisely determining ISC number: Bazooka inhibits Pros accumulation by activating Notch signaling to maintain stem cell fate in pISC apical daughters. A threshold of Pros promotes differentiation to EMCs and avoids ISC-like cell fate, and over-threshold of Pros inhibits miranda expression to ensure symmetric divisions in pISC basal daughters. Our work suggests that a polarity-dependent threshold of a differentiation factor precisely controls stem cell number.

Abstract: Adriamycin (ADR), an antineoplastic drug, is widely used to treat different types of cancers. Yet, the usage is limited because of its severe side effects on testis. On the other hand, gemfibrozil (GEM), as an anti-hyperlipidemic drug, has other pharmacological effects independent of lipid- lowering activity including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The present experiment was designed to investigate the effect of GEM on ADR-induced testicular injury in male rats. A total of 28 male Wistar rats were divided into 4 equal groups: Control; ADR; ADR + GEM; GEM. Serum level of testosterone, luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone were assessed. Also, testicular tissue oxidant/antioxidant markers (malondialdehyde, total antioxidant capacity, nitric oxide, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione) and proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β) were measured. Histopathological studies were conducted on testes. GEM improved hormonal profile and antioxidant defenses in comparison with ADR-treated animals. GEM, significantly reduced the production of proinflammatory cytokines compared with ADR-treated animals. Hormonal and biochemical results were further supported by testicular histopathological findings. Thus, GEM might represent a promising therapeutic modality for the attenuation of testicular injury induced by ADR in clinic.

Abstract: Previous studies have failed to show morphological differences between neck muscle alpha and gamma motor fibers or alpha and gamma motoneurons. The present study aimed to investigate the morphological features of neck muscle motor nerves and motoneurons in cats. To determine the morphological features of peripheral motor fibers, the value of the outer contours of each fiber was converted into a perfect circle after ganglionectomy to remove sensory fibers, and the fiber diameters were calculated based on their circumferences. The sizes of neck motor fibers in the peripheral nerves had an evident bimodal distribution into small and large fiber groups, as depicted in histograms. The sizes of small and large motor fibers ranged from 2 to 12 µm and from 12 to 40 µm, respectively. The small fiber group is likely to correspond to gamma motor fibers and the large fiber group to alpha motor fibers. The morphological features of neck muscle motoneurons sectioned in the horizontal plane were examined using the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) retrograde labeling technique. The diameters of the biventer cervicis and complexus motoneurons had bimodal distributions. The inflection point between the small and large diameter population was 28 µm for the biventer cervicis and 26 µm for the complexus. We also observed that larger neurons displayed more dendrites. In conclusion, we could identify morphological differences likely to correlate with alpha and gamma motoneurons in both neck muscle peripheral nerves and neck motoneurons.

Abstract: The present study evaluated healing potential of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) and BM-MSCs-conditioned medium (BM-MSCs-CM) for acute and subacute injuries in the rabbit peripheral nerve injury model. The regenerative capacity of MSCs was evaluated in 40 rabbits divided into eight groups, four groups each for acute and subacute injury models. BM-MSCs and BM-MSCS-CM were prepared by isolating allogenic bone marrow from the iliac crest. After inducing sciatic nerve crush injury, different treatments consisting of PBS, Laminin, BM-MSCs + laminin, and BM-MSCS-CM + laminin were used on the day of injury in the acute injury model and after ten days of crush injury in the subacute groups. The parameters studied included: pain, total neurological score, gastrocnemius muscle weight and volume ratio, histopathology of the sciatic nerve and gastrocnemius muscle, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Findings indicate that BM-MSCs and BM-MSCS-CM have augmented the regenerative capacity in acute and subacute injury groups with a slightly better improvement in the subacute groups than the animals in acute injury groups. Histopathology data revealed different levels of regenerative process undergoing in the nerve. Neurological observations, gastrocnemius muscle evaluation, muscle histopathology, and the SEM results depicted better healing in animals treated with BM-MSCs and BM-MSCS-CM. With this data, it could be concluded that BM-MSCs support the healing of injured peripheral nerves, and the BM-MSCS-CM does accelerate the healing of acute and subacute peripheral nerve injuries in rabbits. However, stem cell therapy may be indicated during the subacute phase for better results.

Abstract: Summary
How axon guidance pathways are utilized in coordination with temporal and spatial patterning of neural progenitors to regulate neuropil assembly is not well understood. We study this question in the Drosophila medulla using the transmedullary (Tm) projection neurons that target lobula through the inner optic chiasm (IOC). We demonstrate that the Netrin pathway plays multiple roles in guidance of Tm axons and that temporal patterning of medulla neuroblasts determines pioneer versus follower Tm neurons during this process. Loss of Frazzled (Fra) in early-born pioneer Tm neurons leads to IOC defects, while loss of Fra from follower neurons does not affect the IOC. In the follower projection neurons, Fra is required in other targeting steps including lobula branch extension and layer-specific targeting. Furthermore, different from other identified scenarios of Netrin/Fra involved axon guidance in Drosophila, we demonstrate that diffusible Netrin is required for the correct axon targeting and optic lobe organization.

Abstract: Summary
Immunogens that elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies targeting the conserved receptor-binding site (RBS) on influenza hemagglutinin may serve as candidates for a universal influenza vaccine. Here, we develop a computational model to interrogate antibody evolution by affinity maturation after immunization with two types of immunogens: a heterotrimeric “chimera” hemagglutinin that is enriched for the RBS epitope relative to other B cell epitopes and a cocktail composed of three non-epitope-enriched homotrimers of the monomers that comprise the chimera. Experiments in mice find that the chimera outperforms the cocktail for eliciting RBS-directed antibodies. We show that this result follows from an interplay between how B cells engage these antigens and interact with diverse helper T cells and requires T cell-mediated selection of germinal center B cells to be a stringent constraint. Our results shed light on antibody evolution and highlight how immunogen design and T cells modulate vaccination outcomes.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanosensory neurons that innervate the tongue provide essential information to guide feeding, speech, and social grooming. We use in vivo calcium imaging of mouse trigeminal ganglion neurons to identify functional groups of mechanosensory neurons innervating the anterior tongue. These sensory neurons respond to thermal and mechanical stimulation. Analysis of neuronal activity patterns reveal that most mechanosensory trigeminal neurons are tuned to detect moving stimuli across the tongue. Using an unbiased, multilayer hierarchical clustering approach to classify pressure-evoked activity based on temporal response dynamics, we identify five functional classes of mechanosensory neurons with distinct force-response relations and adaptation profiles. These populations are tuned to detect different features of touch. Molecular markers of functionally distinct clusters are identified by analyzing cluster representation in genetically marked neuronal subsets. Collectively, these studies provide a platform for defining the contributions of functionally distinct mechanosensory neurons to oral behaviors crucial for survival in mammals.

Abstract: Summary
Transitions in competence underlie the ability of CNS progenitors to generate a diversity of neurons and glia. Retinal progenitor cells in mouse generate early-born cell types embryonically and late-born cell types largely postnatally. We find that the transition from early to late progenitor competence is regulated by Jarid2. Loss of Jarid2 results in extended production of early cell types and extended expression of early progenitor genes. Jarid2 can regulate histone modifications, and we find reduction of repressive mark H3K27me3 on a subset of early progenitor genes with loss of Jarid2, most notably Foxp1. We show that Foxp1 regulates the competence to generate early-born retinal cell types, promotes early and represses late progenitor gene expression, and is required for extending early retinal cell production after loss of Jarid2. We conclude that Jarid2 facilitates progression of retinal progenitor temporal identity by repressing Foxp1, which is a primary regulator of early temporal patterning.

Abstract: Summary
Protective immune responses against respiratory pathogens, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza virus, are initiated by the mucosal immune system. However, most licensed vaccines are administered parenterally and are largely ineffective at inducing mucosal immunity. The development of safe and effective mucosal vaccines has been hampered by the lack of a suitable mucosal adjuvant. In this study we explore a class of adjuvant that harnesses mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells. We show evidence that intranasal immunization of MAIT cell agonists co-administered with protein, including the spike receptor binding domain from SARS-CoV-2 virus and hemagglutinin from influenza virus, induce protective humoral immunity and immunoglobulin A production. MAIT cell adjuvant activity is mediated by CD40L-dependent activation of dendritic cells and subsequent priming of T follicular helper cells. In summary, we show that MAIT cells are promising vaccine targets that can be utilized as cellular adjuvants in mucosal vaccines.

Abstract: Summary
Monocytes can differentiate into macrophages (Mo-Macs) or dendritic cells (Mo-DCs). The cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) induces the differentiation of monocytes into Mo-Macs, while the combination of GM-CSF/interleukin (IL)-4 is widely used to generate Mo-DCs for clinical applications and to study human DC biology. Here, we report that pharmacological inhibition of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) in the presence of GM-CSF and the absence of IL-4 induces monocyte differentiation into Mo-DCs. Remarkably, we find that simultaneous inhibition of PPARγ and the nutrient sensor mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) induces the differentiation of Mo-DCs with stronger phenotypic stability, superior immunogenicity, and a transcriptional profile characterized by a strong type I interferon (IFN) signature, a lower expression of a large set of tolerogenic genes, and the differential expression of several transcription factors compared with GM-CSF/IL-4 Mo-DCs. Our findings uncover a pathway that tailors Mo-DC differentiation with potential implications in the fields of DC vaccination and cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Class IB phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3Kγ) is activated in immune cells and can form two distinct complexes (p110γ-p84 and p110γ-p101), which are differentially activated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and Ras. Using a combination of X-ray crystallography, hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), electron microscopy, molecular modeling, single-molecule imaging, and activity assays, we identify molecular differences between p110γ-p84 and p110γ-p101 that explain their differential membrane recruitment and activation by Ras and GPCRs. The p110γ-p84 complex is dynamic compared with p110γ-p101. While p110γ-p101 is robustly recruited by Gβγ subunits, p110γ-p84 is weakly recruited to membranes by Gβγ subunits alone and requires recruitment by Ras to allow for Gβγ activation. We mapped two distinct Gβγ interfaces on p101 and the p110γ helical domain, with differences in the C-terminal domain of p84 and p101 conferring sensitivity of p110γ-p101 to Gβγ activation. Overall, our work provides key insight into the molecular basis for how PI3Kγ complexes are activated.

Abstract: Summary
Intestinal colonization of the oral bacterium Haemophilus parainfluenzae has been associated with Crohn’s disease (CD) severity and progression. This study examines the role of periodontal disease (PD) as a modifier for colonization of H. parainfluenzae in patients with CD and explores the mechanisms behind H. parainfluenzae-mediated intestinal inflammation. Fifty subjects with and without CD were evaluated for the presence of PD, and their oral and fecal microbiomes were characterized. PD is associated with increased levels of H. parainfluenzae strains in subjects with CD. Oral inoculation of H. parainfluenzae elicits strain-dependent intestinal inflammation in murine models of inflammatory bowel disease, which is associated with increased intestinal interferon-γ (IFN-γ)+ CD4+ T cells and disruption of the host hypusination pathway. In summary, this study establishes a strain-specific pathogenic role of H. parainfluenzae in intestinal inflammation and highlights the potential effect of PD on intestinal colonization by pathogenic H. parainfluenzae strains in patients with CD.

Abstract: Summary
Janus kinases (JAKs) mediate signal transduction downstream of cytokine receptors. Cytokine-dependent dimerization is conveyed across the cell membrane to drive JAK dimerization, trans-phosphorylation, and activation. Activated JAKs in turn phosphorylate receptor intracellular domains (ICDs), resulting in the recruitment, phosphorylation, and activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-family transcription factors. The structural arrangement of a JAK1 dimer complex with IFNλR1 ICD was recently elucidated while bound by stabilizing nanobodies. While this revealed insights into the dimerization-dependent activation of JAKs and the role of oncogenic mutations in this process, the tyrosine kinase (TK) domains were separated by a distance not compatible with the trans-phosphorylation events between the TK domains. Here, we report the cryoelectron microscopy structure of a mouse JAK1 complex in a putative trans-activation state and expand these insights to other physiologically relevant JAK complexes, providing mechanistic insight into the crucial trans-activation step of JAK signaling and allosteric mechanisms of JAK inhibition.

Abstract: Summary
CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes with a tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cell phenotype are associated with favorable prognosis in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, the relative contribution of CD8+ TRM cells to anti-tumor immunity and immune checkpoint blockade efficacy in breast cancer remains unknown. Here, we show that intratumoral CD8+ T cells in murine mammary tumors transcriptionally resemble those from TNBC patients. Phenotypic and transcriptional studies established two intratumoral sub-populations: one more enriched in markers of terminal exhaustion (TEX-like) and the other with a bona fide resident phenotype (TRM-like). Treatment with anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapy resulted in expansion of these intratumoral populations, with the TRM-like subset displaying significantly enhanced cytotoxic capacity. TRM-like CD8+ T cells could also provide local immune protection against tumor rechallenge and a TRM gene signature extracted from tumor-free tissue was significantly associated with improved clinical outcomes in TNBC patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors.

Abstract: Background
To clarify the research prospect and mechanism analysis of isorhamnetin as a therapeutic drug for bladder cancer.
Methods
Firstly, the effects of different concentrations of isorhamnetin on the expression of PPARγ/PTEN/Akt pathway protein, CA9, PPARγ, PTEN and AKT protein were discussed by western blot. The effects of isorhamnetin on the growth of bladder cells were also analyzed. Secondly, we verified whether the effect of isorhamnetin on CA9 was related to PPARγ/PTEN/Akt pathway by western blot, and the mechanism of isorhamnetin on the growth of bladder cells is related to this pathway by CCK8, cell cycle and ball formation experiment. Further, nude mouse model of subcutaneous tumor transplantation was constructed to analyze the effects of isorhamnetin, PPAR and PTEN on 5637 cell tumorigenesis and the effects of isorhamnetin on tumorigenesis and CA9 expression through PPARγ/PTEN/Akt pathway.
Results
Isorhamnetin inhibited the development of bladder cancer, and regulated the expression of PPAR, PTEN, AKT, CA9. Isorhamnetin inhibits cell proliferation and the transition of cells from G0/G1 phase to S phase, and tumor sphere formation. Carbonic anhydrase IX is a potential downstream molecule of PPARγ/PTEN/AKT pathway. Overexpression of PPARγ and PTEN inhibited expression of CA9 in bladder cancer cells and tumor tissues. Isorhamnetin reduced CA9 expression in bladder cancer via PPARγ/PTEN/AKT pathway, thereby inhibiting bladder cancer tumorigenicity.
Conclusion
Isorhamnetin has the potential to become a therapeutic drug for bladder cancer, whose antitumor mechanism is related to PPARγ/PTEN/AKT pathway. Isorhamnetin reduced CA9 expression in bladder cancer via PPARγ/PTEN/AKT pathway, thereby inhibiting bladder cancer tumorigenicity.

Abstract: Aquaporins (AQPs) are a family of transmembrane channel proteins. AQP1 and AQP4 are expressed in cerebellum amongst others. This study was designed to assess the effect of diabetes on AQP1 and AQP4 expression in cerebellum of rats. Diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of Streptozotocin 45 mg/kg in 24 adult male Sprague Dawley rats. Six rats from control and diabetic groups were sacrificed at one, four, and eight weeks post diabetic confirmation. After eight weeks, measurement of malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH) concentrations, and cerebellar mRNA expression for AQP1 and AQP4 genes were performed. Immunohistochemical evaluation of AQP1, AQP4, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) for cerebellar sections was performed for all groups. Diabetes caused degenerative changes in Purkinje cells with a significant increase in the cerebellar level of MDA and AQP1 immunoreactivity and a significant decrease in GSH level and AQP4 expression levels. However, the alteration in the AQP1 mRNA level was not statistically significant. GFAP immunoreactivity was increased in 8 W diabetic rats following its decrease in 1 W diabetic rats. Diabetes caused some alteration in the AQPs 1 and 4 expression in the cerebellum of diabetic rats which may contribute to diabetes-induced cerebellar complications.

Abstract: Transient receptor potential (TRP) polycystin-3 (TRPP3) is a non-selective cation channel activated by Ca2+ and protons and is involved in regulating ciliary Ca2+ concentration, hedgehog signaling and sour tasting. The TRPP3 channel function and regulation are still not well understood. Here we investigated regulation of TRPP3 by calmodulin (CaM) by means of electrophysiology and Xenopus oocytes as an expression model. We found that TRPP3 channel function is enhanced by calmidazolium, a CaM antagonist, and inhibited by CaM through binding of the CaM N-lobe to a TRPP3 C-terminal domain not overlapped with the EF-hand. We further revealed that the TRPP3/CaM interaction promotes phosphorylation of TRPP3 at threonine 591 by Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II, which mediates the inhibition of TRPP3 by CaM.

Abstract: Summary
Circadian oscillation of gut microbiota exerts significant influence on host physiology, but the host factors that sustain microbial oscillations are rarely reported. We compared the gut microbiome and metabolome of wild-type and BMAL1-deficient cynomolgus monkeys during a diurnal cycle by performing 16S rRNA sequencing and untargeted fecal metabolomics and uncovered the influence of intestinal H2O2 on microbial compositions. Ablation of BMAL1 induced expansion of Bacteroidota at midnight and altered microbial oscillations. Some important fecal metabolites changed significantly, and we investigated their correlations with microbes. Further analyses revealed that disturbed rhythmicity of NOX1-derived intestinal H2O2 was responsible for the altered microbial oscillations in BMAL1-deficient monkeys. Mechanistic studies showed that BMAL1 transactivated NOX1 via binding to the E1-E2 site in its promoter. Notably, BMAL1-dependent activation of NOX1 was conserved in cynomolgus monkeys and humans. Our study demonstrates the importance of intestine clock-controlled H2O2 rhythmicity on the rhythmic oscillation of gut microbiota.

Abstract: Summary
RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) has been recognized as a passively regulated multi-subunit holoenzyme. However, the extent to which RNA Pol II subunits might be important beyond the RNA Pol II complex remains unclear. Here, fractions containing disassociated RPB3 (dRPB3) were identified by size exclusion chromatography in various cells. Through a unique strategy, i.e., “specific degradation of disassociated subunits (SDDS),” we demonstrated that dRPB3 functions as a regulatory component of RNA Pol II to enable the preferential control of 3′ end processing of ribosomal protein genes directly through its N-terminal domain. Machine learning analysis of large-scale genomic features revealed that the little elongation complex (LEC) helps to specialize the functions of dRPB3. Mechanistically, dRPB3 facilitates CBC-PCF11 axis activity to increase the efficiency of 3′ end processing. Furthermore, RPB3 is dynamically regulated during development and diseases. These findings suggest that RNA Pol II gains specific regulatory functions by trapping disassociated subunits in mammalian cells.
