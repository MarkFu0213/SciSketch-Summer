Abstract: Redox activity of metal oxides are the key to the development of high-temperature thermochemical energy storage. However, few studies have reported that the reactivity of metal oxides as thermochemical energy storage is significantly affected by the changes of crystal structure and morphology during redox, caused by ion diffusion and vacancy formation and migration. In this study, we find a previously unreported high-performance thermochemical energy storage material Cu1.5Mn1.5O4 with special structure. Cu1.5Mn1.5O4 shows high energy densities during reduction and oxidation (−219.852 and 207.618 kJ/kg), and keeps 97.06% and 92.98% reactivity after 600 cycles. Voids on specific surfaces are observed after cycling, but not in the fresh sample. We find the voids provide abundant Cu2+, Mn4+ species and lattice oxygen to promote its reaction performance. Cu ions migrate obviously after oxidation and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that DCu (7.4 × 10−14 cm2 s−1) is higher than DMn (5.1 × 10−14 cm2 s−1) and DO (1.7 × 10−14 cm2 s−1). Cu1.5Mn1.5O4 exhibits voids during oxidation due to ion transport described by the Kirkendall effect. In addition, DFT calculations verify that O2− is more easily to adsorb and diffuse on (111) surface, revealing the optimal transport path and directional diffusion mechanism of O2−. These mechanisms can provide ideas for the reasonable design of materials to improve thermochemical reaction performance.

Abstract: At present, the thermoelectric eutectic tuning of thermoelectric materials remains a great challenge, so in this paper, polydopamine (PDA) was deposited on polypropylene (PP) to build up the gradient structure before spraying poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) nanowires (PEDOT nw), and then low-temperature interfacial polymerization technique was carried out to deposit PEDOT again to obtain the nano-phase-boundary-structured photothermoelectric fabrics. The presence of an energy filtration system at the interface of the two phases enhances the Seebeck coefficient, and hence the power factor, of the organic conducting polymer PEDOT. Subsequently, a photothermoelectric fabric (PA-PEDOT nw-Ty) has been obtained by introducing (polypyrrole) PPy as a photothermal layer, and finally a wet and dry photothermoelectric fabric device prepared by assembling with silver-functionalized polypropylene fabric (PP–Ag). The photothermoelectric fabric device can output 4.5 mV under 500 W of sunlight in the dry state, while the wet state photothermoelectric fabric device not only outputs 65.4 mV, but also evaporates 4 g of water within 1 h. Therefore, this study not only realizes the continuous conversion of photothermal to thermoelectric power, but also solar energy harvesting and solar vapor evaporation, which is a key step towards smart wearable products.

Abstract: Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) has attracted much attention in the current mass-production of n-type tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells because of the advantages of fast film forming rate and compatibility with in-situ doping. However, the PECVD technology is limited by the effect of ion bombardment on the ultra-thin SiO2 layer during gas ionization, together with the inevitable front wrap-around poly-Si. Here, the dual-layer poly-Si stack made up of the intrinsic poly-Si(i) and in-situ P-doped poly-Si(n+) has been achieved by adjusting the deposition power, pulse voltage duty cycle, and flow rate of the PH3, which effectively protects the tunneling SiO2 layer through the weakened ion bombardment to improve the interface passivation and contact resistivity. We have demonstrated that the pinhole density is an important reason for the thinner SiO2 layer optimized less than 1.0 nm. More importantly, the conversion efficiency of n-type TOPCon c-Si solar cells can be improved by more than 0.10% and 0.15%, respectively, by the combination of the dual-layer poly-Si stack and wrap-around poly-Si removal compared with the single-layer poly-Si counterpart with the same thickness.

Abstract: The coatings with different thermodynamic and optical properties can adjust and improve the overall performance of solid particles in solid particle solar receivers (SPSRs). In this work, the manganese iron black (PBK26) coating is prepared by water bath method and comprehensive performance of the coating is found to be the best when Fe/Mn molar ratio in PBK26 is 4:1. The high temperature radiation absorption performances of different solid particles coated by PBK26 are investigated. The results show that the spectral absorptivity of particles can be greatly improved by coating. The average spectral absorptivity of quartz sand, bauxite and mullite increases by 25.9%, 20.8% and 16.2%, respectively. However, the coated quartz sand appears coating shedding phenomenon at high temperatures, and the coating on bauxite is not complete. Only the coated mullite shows excellent coating effect and thermal stability. After long-period high temperature thermal stability experiments at 900 °C and cyclic thermal stability experiments of 30 cycles, the maximum mass loss of coated mullite is less than 0.4% and the spectral absorptivity is almost unchanged. In the wear resistance experiments the surface debris of the coated mullite increases. And there is a mass loss of 8.244% with a coating thickness loss of 27% and a spectral absorptivity decrease of 3.88% after 10 h of wear at 900 rpm. The results imply good high temperature thermal stability and acceptable wear resistance of PBK26 coated mullite, which provide an option for high temperature radiation improvement of solid particles.

Abstract: In this work, we present results on various low-temperature approaches for the metallization and interconnection of high-efficiency solar cells as silicon heterojunction (SHJ) or perovskite silicon tandems. By using fine line screen printing for the cell metallization and Ag-free or -reduced interconnection technologies, we demonstrate the potential of these approaches both for SHJ and perovskite silicon tandem cells. Furthermore, low-temperature (LT, ∼200 °C) or ultra-low-temperature (ULT, ∼150 °C) processes are utilized for metallization and interconnection to treat these temperature-sensitive solar cells with a reduced energy consumption. We compare LT soldering of SHJ cells with Pb-free alloys to state-of-the-art soldering processes and interconnection with electrically conductive adhesives (ECAs). For successful module integration of perovskite silicon tandem solar cells, these findings provide the basis to build full-size tandem modules with different interconnection technologies.

Abstract: High-performance passivating contacts with excellent electron selective property is a prerequisite for silicon solar cells with high power conversion efficiency. In this work, a highly conductive, ultra-thin electron-selective titanium nitride (TiN) film is prepared by reactive magnetron sputtering for tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar cells. The deposition parameters, crystal structure, and chemical state were systematically investigated. A higher TiN content and stronger TiN (111) diffraction peak resulted in higher conductivity. We demonstrated that the TiN film possessed a conductivity as high as 5000 S/cm and a relatively low work function of 4.26 eV. An ultra-thin TiN film (1–2 nm) was inserted between the n+ poly-Si and rear electrode to reduce the interface contact resistance and interface barrier height and subsequently obtain better electron transport. The cross-sectional morphology and elemental distribution of the n+ poly-Si/TiN/Ag interface were tested using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The developed TiN film was a proof of concept, and it demonstrated an impressive cell efficiency of 24.6% (Voc = 707.1 mV, Jsc = 41.62 mA/cm2, FF = 83.7%) on TOPCon solar cells. Our work provides vital insights and a detailed supplement toward the optimization of electron contact for silicon solar cells or perovskite solar cells. The outcomes of the study indicate the potential for use in applications involving high fill factor photovoltaic devices.

Abstract: Potassium carbonate has recently been identified as a promising candidate for thermochemical energy storage. However, as for many salt hydrates, the reaction kinetics is limited, and moreover, the hydration transition is kinetically hindered due to a metastable zone, involving limited mobility. This work aims to improve mobility by using organic potassium dopants, it shows that doping with potassium-formate and -acetate, can accelerate the hydration reaction. It has been shown that these dopants can enhance the hydration rate by two mechanisms i.e. introducing mobility due to adsorption of more water or introducing more surface area, where water adsorption can occur. This work opens up new possibilities for organic dopants to enhance the performance of salt hydrates.

Abstract: In current silicon solar cell technologies, hydrogen is incorporated into the solar cell during the fast-firing process. It passivates defects at the surface and in the bulk, but also leads to light- and elevated-temperature-induced degradation (LeTID). Although it is known that the hydrogen content and the LeTID extent can be reduced by employing a slower cooling ramp during the fast-firing process, the exact mechanism behind this phenomenon remains unclear. This study aims at closing this gap by investigating the impact of cooling ramps with different temperature plateaus on hydrogen (complexes) in B-doped FZ-Si wafers. The fired wafers are analyzed with FT-IR spectroscopy, four-point-probe resistivity measurements, and LeTID tests via effective lifetime measurements. Our findings provide evidence that hydrogen not only diffuses into the silicon bulk but can also effuse out of it during the cooling ramp. A one-dimensional hydrogen model is built in Sentaurus TCAD to simulate the in- and out-diffusion of hydrogen and to compare it with the experimental results. The experimentally determined hydrogen concentrations align with our simulation, with the diffusion being dominated by the fast-diffusing neutral hydrogen H0. Moreover, we find stronger out-diffusion at higher temperatures, resulting in a lower total hydrogen concentration for slower cooling ramps. The extent of LeTID and surface-related degradation (SRD) are found to scale with the final total hydrogen concentration in the bulk. Therefore, modifying the cooling ramp can be an effective tool to optimize the hydrogen content and minimize the impact of degradation phenomena on silicon solar cells.

Abstract: Chlorine and fluorine salts are very promising thermal storage media for high–temperature thermal energy storage (TES) systems. In this study, NaCl–KCl–NaF/nanoparticles composite phase change materials (CPCMs) were employed by an advanced high–temperature and high–pressure reactor. NaCl–KCl–NaF was adopted as the BS, while CuO and Al2O3 nanoparticles have been uniformly dispersed in different ratios to generate CPCMs from the base salt (BS). Microscopic characterization, thermal properties characterization, and economic analysis of CPCMs and the BS were performed. The findings revealed that the best results were obtained when the BS was added with 0.5 wt percent Al2O3 and 0.5 wt percent CuO nanoparticles, CPCMs have improved solid/liquid thermal conductivity by a factor of 3.70 and 1.84, and TES density by a factor of 1.13, while reducing the cost per unit of TES density by approximately 26.8%. In addition, the CPCMs and BS possess excellent operating temperature range and thermal stability, whereby they are applicable in high–temperature TES systems.

Abstract: Potential-induced degradation of the shunting type (PID-s) is a well-known problem for photovoltaic modules. However, standard PID testing at the cell or module level takes 96 h due to the time it takes for the Na ions to diffuse from the glass to the solar cell through the ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) encapsulant. This is too slow to monitor production quality in the fast-paced solar cell industry. Moreover, it results in the encapsulation of solar cells, significantly restricting characterization options after PID testing. In this work, we replace the EVA in the PID testing setup with a salt-enriched hybrid polymer, which provides the solar cell with direct access to sodium (Na) ions while at the same time avoiding encapsulation during the testing process. Solar cells that underwent PID-s testing with the salt-enriched hybrid polymer showed a maximum degradation after only 12 min, over two orders of magnitude faster than standard PID-s testing using EVA, which took 4,300 min (∼72 h) to reach maximum degradation. Hence, PID-s testing using the salt-enriched hybrid is significantly faster than conventional techniques and avoids encapsulation, thus allowing for more detailed post-PID cell analysis. This new test shows that some solar cells can recover from PID-s, which was corroborated by extending the standard test to 300 h. This important novel insight shines a new light on the PID-s mechanism and the impact of this failure mode in field operation.

Abstract: Cisplatin, a widely prescribed chemotherapeutic agent for treating solid tumors, induces DNA adducts and activates cellular defense mechanisms, including DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoint control, and apoptosis. Considering the circadian rhythmicity displayed by most chemotherapeutic agents and their varying therapeutic efficacy based on treatment timing, our study aimed to investigate whether the circadian clock system influences the DNA damage responses triggered by cisplatin in synchronized cells. We examined the DNA damage responses in circadian-synchronized wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (WT-MEF; clock-proficient cells), cryptochrome1 and 2 double knock-out MEF (CRYDKO; clock-deficient cells), and mouse hepatocarcinoma Hepa1c1c7 cells. Varying the treatment time resulted in a significant difference in the rate of platinum-DNA adduct removal specifically in circadian-synchronized WT-MEF, while CRYDKO did not exhibit such variation. Moreover, diurnal variation in other DNA damage responses, such as cell cycle checkpoint activity indicated by p53 phosphorylation status and apoptosis measured by DNA break frequency, was observed only in circadian-synchronized WT-MEF, not in CRYDKO or mouse hepatocarcinoma Hepa1c1c7 cells. These findings highlight that the DNA damage responses triggered by cisplatin are indeed governed by circadian control exclusively in clock-proficient cells. This outcome bears potential implications for enhancing or devising chronotherapy approaches for cancer patients.

Abstract: In this contribution, a novel flexible phase change textiles based on decanoic acid (DA) and polyamide 11 (PA11) blends with various DA/PA11 mass ratios, in which PA11 acted as the polymer matrix, and DA behaved as phase change ingredient, were developed via electrospinning. Besides, a conductive polypyrrole (PPy) coating was designed via in-situ polymerization. Morphological observations carried out by the SEM images demonstrated porous and highly homogeneous morphology with smooth, long, continuous, and free-bead fibers. Furthermore, forming of a uniform PPy layer on the surface was confirmed through the images. As such, conductive textiles with electrical conductivity up to 28.89 ± 1.50 S/m were prepared. Tensile testing showed that the mechanical properties did not change considerably after PPy coating. Moreover, the phase change performance was investigated using DSC analysis, where the melting and crystallization enthalpies were respectively 112.77 J/g and 110.21 J/g in the textile with the highest DA loading, i.e., 70 wt%. More notably, the phase-change enthalpies did not change considerably after 100 DSC thermal cycles. Finally, significant electro- and photo-heat storage and conversion were observed for the conductive PCM textiles. Thus, this work introduced new flexible smart textiles with significant potential in wearable and protective systems.

Abstract: Introduction
The data on the pattern of primary hematologic malignancies in Bahrain is sparse, although previously published studies suggested rising trends in their incidence. This study aimed to compare with regional and world data and identify any changing trends.
Methods
A retrospective cross-sectional chart analysis study was done on all cases of primary hematologic malignancies of bone marrow origin of Bahraini nationals presenting during the 10-year period from January 2005 to December 2014 at the sole oncology referral center in Bahrain during the study period.
Results
In a total of 272 cases, the primary hematologic malignancies in decreasing order of frequency with respective median ages at diagnosis were: acute myeloid leukemia (AML; 26.1%, 39 years), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; 22.8%, 9 years), multiple myeloma (MM, 16.2%, 57 years), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML, 14%, 39.5 years), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS; 12.5%, 56 years) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; 5.5%, 65 years). The overall crude annual incidence rate of these malignancies was 4.8/105 population. Age-specific incidence rates were found to increase dramatically with age, except for ALL, for which it peaked in the pediatric age group. The age-standardized incidence rates (ASIRs) per 105 per year were 1.47 (AML), 1.13 (MM), 0.93 (ALL), 0.85 (MDS), 0.81 (CML) and 0.44 (CLL).
Conclusion
The pattern of primary hematologic malignancies in Bahrain shows unique features that distinguish it from trends reported in Eastern and Western world populations. Compared to previously published reports, ASIR trends decreased in CML and ALL but increased in MDS and MM.

Abstract: Light- and elevated temperature-induced degradation (LeTID), which can lead to significant module power loss in the field, has been extensively studied for boron (B)-doped silicon solar cells in the past. Current mass-production has shifted to gallium (Ga)-doped silicon substrates. Therefore, process influences on LeTID must be re-investigated for the changed acceptor species, as the LeTID-degradation extent and kinetics can be drastically different. We study the influence of the dielectric layer and the firing profile on the LeTID extent in Ga-doped lifetime samples. Furthermore, the effect of the bulk doping concentration is investigated. We find that a dielectric layer with high hydrogen content, a-SiNx:H (PECVD), leads to largest LeTID degradation. However, AlOx (PECVD) interlayers serve as very effective diffusion barriers, thus mitigating LeTID, as expected from studies on B-doped material. We observe no significant dependence of LeTID susceptibility on the doping concentration. Most interestingly, it appears that modifying the peak firing temperature, which has the greatest effect on the extent of LeTID in B-doped silicon, has a much smaller effect on the Ga-doped material, with LeTID being observed even when firing at 700 °C.

Abstract: The redox system of Co3O4/CoO is very promising for the thermochemical energy storage systems coupled to concentrated solar power plants because of its high energy storage density and reversibility. Nevertheless, the practical application of Co3O4/CoO system is limited by thermal hysteresis of the redox reaction and material sintering. Here, we synthesized Co-based metal oxides doped with Al and Cr, and studied the influence of the doping of these two metal elements on the thermochemical properties and sintering resistance of the pure Co3O4/CoO system. Both Al and Cr doping narrows the thermal hysteresis of the Co3O4/CoO system. In particular, when the molar doping rate of Al is 10%, the thermal hysteresis of Co–Al oxides is only 4.02 °C, which is much narrower than that of pure Co3O4, and the increase of its oxidation temperature also means that a higher level of thermal energy can be released during oxidation. In the redox cycle, the addition of Al inhibits material sintering and the formation of a loose porous structure facilitates the oxidation, ensuring the reversibility of the redox reaction. The 10% Al–Co honeycomb shows stable conversion behavior with an average conversion of 77.75% in 15 redox cycles. Co–Al oxides exhibit excellent oxidative exothermic characteristics and long-term cycle stability, making them suitable for efficient thermochemical energy-storage processes.

Abstract: Enhancing the performance of antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) solar cells is significantly influenced by the optimization of the absorber/buffer junction. A wider bandgap buffer layer is suggested as a substitute for the traditional CdS buffer layer, for achieving this purpose. To enhance the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and mitigate parasitic absorption of Sb2Se3 cells, this study introduces zinc tin oxide (Zn,Sn)O as a substitute buffer layer instead of the narrow-bandgap and toxic CdS material. This study focuses on the simulation and numerical analysis of Sb2Se3 solar cells with (Zn,Sn)O buffer layer using the SCAPS (Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator) software. The photovoltaic performance was evaluated by investigating the impact of different fractions of x = Sn/(Zn + Sn) in the Zn1-xSnxO layer. The reduction of interface recombination and improvement of open-circuit voltage (Voc) can be attained by optimizing the band alignment through the Zn1-xSnxO layer. The most favorable interface between the Sb2Se3 and Zn1-xSnxO layers is attained when x = 0.2. In a traditional Sb2Se3/TiO2/CdS cell, the interface between the absorber and buffer layers has a −0.4 eV conduction band offset (CBO). The utilization of a Zn0.8Sn0.2O buffer layer causes an upward shift of the conduction band and a reduction of the negative CBO to −0.16 eV. Consequently, due to the wider gap between the conduction band of the Zn0.8Sn0.2O and the valence band of the Sb2Se3, interface recombination is reduced. According to the simulation results, the efficiency of the simulated Sb2Se3/TiO2/Zn0.8Sn0.2O cell is increased to 14.6%, representing a significant improvement compared to the conventional Sb2Se3/TiO2/CdS cell.

Abstract: The extraction of valuable silver (Ag) from crystalline silicon (c-Si) photovoltaic (PV) solar cells through chemical acid leaching can be affected by solar cell particle sizes. However, the effect of solar cell particle size on Ag leaching kinetics and mechanisms has not been clarified yet. In this work, integrated experiments and numerical simulations are applied to gain insights of the particle size effect. Laboratory experiments are conducted with pure c-Si PV solar cell particle sizes ranging from 0.075 to 3.15 mm to develop a particle size-oriented reaction kinetics model, and surface morphological analysis of particles with sizes ranging from 0.5 to 3.15 mm are used to visualize Ag variations on solar cell surface during leaching process. Furthermore, a Computational Fluid Dynamics-Discrete Element Method (CFD-DEM) model is developed to describe the reacting flow details of leaching process based on the proposed kinetics model. The particle and fluid dynamics analysis of simulation results are conducted to understand particle size effect on leaching at microscale. The findings indicate that leaching efficiency for particles of 0.075–0.15 mm is about 1.3 times greater than that of 1.0–3.15 mm due to the frequency and quality of particle-particle collision, particle-fluid interaction, accelerated breakdown, and removal of Ag. Overall, this work provides an insightful understanding of particle size effect on Ag leaching process and lays a foundation for optimizing Ag recovery from EoL c-Si PV solar cells.

Abstract: Reports showing that hydrogen and group-III acceptors play an important role in Light- and elevated Temperature-induced Degradation (LeTID) of Si-based solar cells highlight the need for a better understanding of interactions between these two species. In this contribution, a combination of junction spectroscopy techniques and first principles modelling has been used to study hydrogen-induced changes in electrical properties of either boron or gallium Czochralski-grown silicon co-doped with phosphorus in order to produce n-type material facilitating novel techniques to assess recombination active defects. The interactions of hydrogen with acceptor atoms have been induced via annealing of these co-doped hydrogenated samples with the application of reverse bias (RBA). These treatments have resulted in a significant increase in the net shallow donor concentration in depletion regions of both materials and in the appearance of a strong electron emission signal due to a trap with an energy level at about Ec −0.18 eV in the DLTS spectra of Si:P + B material. It is argued that this trap is related to the donor level of a BH2 complex. Calculations using density functional theory have shown that the BH2 defect has a charge-state dependent geometry, which turns out to be crucial for the proposed non-radiative recombination mechanism. The BH2 defect is therefore suggested to be the root cause of LeTID in boron-doped Si. In contrast, modelling results predict that GaH2 is a defect with shallow energy levels, without the characteristic features of a recombination centre. This is corroborated by the results of electrical measurements on hydrogenated Si:P + Ga subjected to RBA. Conventional annealing treatments were subsequently used to assess the thermal stability of acceptor-H related defects. Based on the obtained results, the peculiarities of hydrogen interactions with boron and gallium acceptors are discussed.

Abstract: Screen printing of Ag paste is a key process for implementing polycrystalline-silicon/silicon oxide (poly-Si/SiOx) passivating contacts in industrial solar cells. Thereby, the formation of Ag crystallites on the Si surface is crucial for a low-ohmic contact. Recently, it has been observed that Ag crystallites are predominantly formed within the poly-Si layer and stop at the thermal SiOx, thermal interface, causing a cuboidal shape. To avoid a direct contact of the Ag crystallites with the underlying SiOx, thermal/crystalline-Si (c-Si) interface, a multilayer approach with interlayer SiOx, inter between several poly-Si layers is presented. A stack of three 50 nm poly-Si layers achieves highest cell potential. Further, the metallization process parameters are scanned to check when this cuboidal Ag crystallite shape occurs. While different amorphous-silicon (a-Si) deposition techniques show no changes, there are strong indications that the glass frit etching is responsible for a different etching mechanism causing the breakdown of the SiOx stop.

Abstract: 1.7 eV absorber materials are important in high-performance III-V multi-junction solar cells. Here, we show that rapid thermal annealing significantly improves the carrier lifetimes in lightly doped metamorphic 1.7 eV Ga0.37In0.63P (MM GaInP) grown on GaAs by molecular beam epitaxy. A low threading dislocation density of ∼6 × 105 cm−2 was achieved through the use of an InxGa1-xAs graded buffer. Annealing enables minority carrier lifetimes in 1.7 eV p- and n-GaInP of 3.9 and 28 ns, respectively, both of which are higher than annealed lattice-matched 1.9 eV Ga0.51In0.49P (LM GaInP) grown in the same chamber. With the benefit of annealing, MM 1.7 eV GaInP front-junction solar cells show a high peak internal quantum efficiency of 94.3% and an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.17 V. We also demonstrate the first MM 1.7 eV GaInP rear-heterojunction cells with high fill factor and VOC of 85% and 1.21 V, respectively, by taking advantage of long carrier lifetime while eliminating majority carrier blocking. The high VOC values for the 1.7 eV GaInP cells presented in this work indicate promising tolerance to threading dislocations in MM GaInP.

Abstract: Solar-powered hydrated salt-based phase change materials have great potential in the field of solar building energy efficiency. However, hydrated salts suffer from leakage, subcooling and phase separation in practical applications. To address these problems, this study proposes a solution to encapsulate hydrated salt with biomass-derived carbon aerogel as a carrier, which can effectively mitigate the leakage, subcooling, and phase separation problems of hydrated salt without the need of additional modifiers. The composite phase change material exhibited high phase change enthalpy retention (92%), negligible supercooling (0.4 °C), and excellent photothermal conversion efficiency (91.5%). In addition, thanks to the rich porosity and superhydrophilicity of the carbon aerogel, a composite hygroscopic agent combined with lithium chloride was prepared for high-performance atmospheric water harvesting. The composite hygroscopic material has a moisture adsorption capacity of 2.1 g g−1 at 90% RH and can desorb more than 92.3% of the moisture by solar energy drive. The performance was stable after several adsorption-desorption cycles. The multifunctional composites based on biomass-derived carbon aerogels have excellent performance in solar thermal storage and atmospheric water harvesting, providing a new perspective on solar thermal utilization.

Abstract: Global warming and the energy crisis are major challenges facing the world today. Traditional structural design methods for radiative coolers are no longer sufficient to meet the increasingly demanding realities of these challenges. Simplifying the design process and optimizing structural parameters have become pressing issues. In this paper, a new optimization method for metasurface based daytime radiative cooler is proposed, which utilizes the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm in machine learning (ML) to construct regression models and optimize designs for two structures of quadrangular prismatic metasurface (QPM) and circular truncated cone metasurface (CTCM). The results show that the atmospheric window emissivity (mainly in the 8–13 μm range) of QPM and CTCM reaches 96.98% and 97.81%, respectively, while the absorptivity/emissivity in solar spectrum is only 9.34% and 7.21%. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the KNN regression model is only 0.74% and 0.29%, which is significantly better than other classical ML algorithms. Meanwhile, the designed structures achieve net cooling power of 63.48 W/m2 and 90.13 W/m2 at ambient temperature for both QPM and CTCM. This systematic study provides a novel approach for the design of daytime radiative coolers.

Abstract: Silicon solar cells with a tunnel oxide passivating contact (TOPCon) structure are the new mainstream products; however, emitter recombination has become the bottleneck for further improvement. The introduction of selective emitter (SE) technology becomes imperative to address this issue. In this study, the appropriate range of sheet resistance in the light-doped region (230–280 Ω/sq)and the reasonable interval of the diffusion junction depth in the heavy-doped region (1.2–1.3 μm) are presented. The selective emitter with a suitable doping distribution is realized using the mask and etch-back method. Compared to the homogeneous emitter with a sheet resistance of 150 Ω/sq, J0e of 16 fA/cm2, and J0metal-front of 500 fA/cm2, the optimum selective emitter results in a J0e-light doping of 8 fA/cm2, J0e-heavy doping of 45 fA/cm2 and J0metal-front of 213 fA/cm2. Finally, the boron SE-TOPCon cell samples UOC (726.5 mV), FF (84.01%), and efficiency (25.51%) are obtained, compared with the TOPCon cell with homogeneous emitter Uoc (717.6 mV), FF (83.77%) and efficiency (25.17%) of the reference. In addition, the efficiency potential of the boron SE-TOPCon cell (26.02%) at the optimal process conditions is determined based on device simulations. This study provides a feasible technical path for mass-produced TOPCon cells to increase the efficiency to more than 26%.

Abstract: Metallization of crystalline silicon (Si) solar cells is indispensable for reducing the cost while increasing the overall efficiency. Developing alternative materials to the most commonly used screen printed silver (Ag) contacts is a critical factor. Here, in this study, a nickel (Ni) metal paste consisting of Ni metal particles, glass frit and an organic vehicle is fabricated for screen printed Ni contacts. To prevent possible Schottky barrier formation, a graphene layer is placed on the front surface of the Si solar cell between Ni and Si forming a metal-2D-semiconductor structure ensuring the ohmic (or ohmic-like) contacts. It is demonstrated here that the graphene is transferred successfully onto the textured front surface of the cells and G/2D peaks are observed clearly, indicating the good quality of the graphene layer. Constituents of Ni metal paste, glass frit and organic vehicle, are fabricated in concordance with nickel metal powder and mixed to achieve optimal electrical output parameters. The findings suggest that the transition temperature of the glass frit is between 270 °C and 300 °C resulting in around 475 °C softening temperature, which gives excellent etching behavior to the paste. The average contact resistance of the screen printed Ni contacts governed by etching process is measured around 6.9 mΩ cm2. The SEM images of the contacts show a uniform distribution and sintering behavior similar to that of silver counterparts. The light current-voltage measurements read the open circuit voltage of 660 mV, the short circuit density of 39.11 mA/cm2 and the fill factor of 81.4% resulting in around 21% efficiency.

Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by memory loss and cognitive decline. Synaptic impairment is one of the first events to occur in the progression of this disease. Synaptic plasticity and cellular association of various plastic events have been shown to be affected in AD models. Nogo-A, a well-known axonal growth inhibitor with a recently discovered role as a plasticity suppressor, and its main receptor Nogo-66 receptor 1 (NGR1) have been found to be overexpressed in the hippocampus of Alzheimer’s patients. However, the role of Nogo-A and its receptor in the pathology of AD is still widely unknown. In this work we set out to investigate whether Nogo-A is working as a plasticity suppressor in AD. Our results show that inhibition of the Nogo-A pathway via the Nogo-R antibody in an Alzheimer’s mouse model, APP/PS1, leads to the restoration of both synaptic plasticity and associativity in a protein synthesis and NMDR-dependent manner. We also show that inhibition of the p75NTR pathway, which is strongly associated with NGR1, restores synaptic plasticity as well. Mechanistically, we propose that the restoration of synaptic plasticity in APP/PS1 via inhibition of the Nogo-A pathway is due to the modulation of the RhoA-ROCK2 pathway and increase in plasticity related proteins. Our study identifies Nogo-A as a plasticity suppressor in AD models hence targeting Nogo-A could be a promising strategy to understanding AD pathology.

Abstract: Introduction
Collecting high-dose (HD) or double-dose (DD) apheresis platelets units from a single collection offers significant benefit by improving inventory logistics and minimizing the cost per unit produced. Platelet collection yield by apheresis is primarily influenced by donor factors, but the cell separator used also affects the collection yield.
Objectives
To predict the cutoff in donor factors resulting in HD and DD platelet collections between Trima/Spectra Optia and MCS+ apheresis equipment using Classification and Regression Trees (CART) analysis.
Methods
High platelet yield collections (target ≥ 4.5 × 1011 platelets) using MCS+, Trima Accel and Spectra Optia were included. Endpoints were ≥ 6 × 1011 platelets for DD and ≥ 4.5 to < 6 × 1011 for HD collections. The CART, a tree building technique, was used to predict the donor factors resulting in high-yield platelet collections in Trima/Spectra Optia and MCS+ equipment by R programming.
Results
Out of 1,102 donations, the DDs represented 60% and the HDs, 31%. The Trima/Spectra Optia predicted higher success rates when the donor platelet count was set at ≥ 205 × 103/µl and ≥ 237 × 103/µl for HD and DD collections. The MCS+ predicted better success when the donor platelet count was ≥ 286 × 103/µl for HD and ≥ 384 × 103/µl for DD collections. Increased donor weight helped counter the effects of lower donor platelet counts only for HD collections in both the equipment.
Conclusions
The donor platelet count and weight formed the strongest criteria for predicting high platelet yield donations. Success rates for collecting DD and HD products were higher in the Trima/Spectra Optia, as they require lower donor platelet count and body weight than the MCS+.

Abstract: Reducing the width of conductive silver wires, increasing the aspect ratio, improving the utilization rate of silver paste, and enhancing the uniformity of silver wires are key issues that need to be addressed in the manufacture of solar cells. This article explores the feasibility of using glass nozzles to directly write ultra-high viscosity silver paste containing micrometer-sized particles. By preparing a glass nozzle with a diameter of 45μm, conductive silver wires with an average width of about 43±2μm and an aspect ratio of up to 0.96 can be printed. After high-temperature sintering, the width of the silver wire is 32±2μm, the aspect ratio is 0.95, and the resistance of the finger line is 0.13 Ω/cm. In addition, the conductive silver paste is a Herschel–Bulkley (HB) non-Newtonian fluid. Combining the constitutive equation of the HB fluid, a mathematical model of the silver paste flow inside the nozzle is established. Therefore, the influence of characteristic parameters of the silver paste/nozzle on the printing process can be intuitively understood.

Abstract: The use of antireflective coatings to increase the transmittance of the cover glass is a central aspect of achieving high efficiencies for solar collectors and photovoltaics alike. Considering an expected lifetime of 20–30 years for solar energy installations, the durability of the antireflective surfaces is essential. Here, a novel antireflective SiO2 coating with a hexagonally ordered closed pore structure, produced with an aerosol-based sol-gel method is benchmarked against two commercial coatings; produced with acid etching and sol-gel roll coating. The optical and mechanical properties together with contact angle characteristics were evaluated before and after various durability tests, including climate chamber tests, outdoor exposure, and abrasion. Compared to the commercial antireflective coatings with open pore structures, the novel coating performed in parity, or better, in all tests. Based on the results of humidity freeze and industrial climate chamber tests, it appears that the coating with closed pore structure has a better ability to prevent water adsorption. Additionally, the closed pore structure of the coating seems to minimize the accumulation of dirt and deposits. The abrasion and cleanability test further confirm the advantages of a closed pore structure, showcasing the coating's mechanical durability. While the coatings exhibit similar hardness and reduced elastic modulus, the closed pore coating proves to be even harder after undergoing the industrial climate chamber test, but also slightly more brittle, as indicated by the probability of crack initiation. In summary the closed pore structure is well suited for tempered and arid climates, making it a truly competitive alternative to existing antireflective coatings.

Abstract: The matching between the morphology of the backside of n-TOPCon solar cells and the tunnel oxide/n + polysilicon structure is the key to achieving high efficiency. In this work, based on the requirement of edge isolation, micro-alkali polishing and micro-alkali texturing were performed on the acid-polishing back surface. Their effects on surface morphology, passivation effect, contact resistance, and photoelectric conversion efficiency were investigated. Adding a short-time micro-alkali texturing process after acid polishing can form a surface morphology with both regional polishing and local microtexture. This can improve the contact characteristics without significantly affecting the passivation characteristics, enabling solar cells to achieve higher FF (83.30%) and average efficiency (24.15%). Compared with the acid polishing sample, the efficiency of the micro-alkali texturing sample is increased by 0.12%. The deterioration of ohmic contact caused by alkali polishing has not been eliminated by optimizing the reaction process of alkali polishing. The study of different surface morphologies-modified samples under different tunnel oxide layer growth time, also reveals the difference in the influence of tunnel oxide layer characteristics on samples with different morphologies. The acid-polishing samples show more stable FF and conversion efficiency at different thermal oxidation time, and the micro-alkali texturing samples have a significant FF advantage at shorter thermal oxidation time. These studies can be applied and validated in the photovoltaic industry.

Abstract: Daytime radiative cooling (DRC) can spontaneously cool a surface without consuming energy by reflecting sunlight and emitting thermal radiation to the outer space through atmospheric transmission windows. However, the manufacturing of efficient DRC designs with low cost, high scalability, strong applicability, and along with achieving great weather resistance for practical applications remains a challenge. Here, we report a facile strategy to fabricate spectrally selective single-layer DRC coatings by facilely embedding hydrophobically modified TiO2@SiO2 nanospheres in commercially available fluorocarbon resin matrix for improving daytime cooling. The TiO2 shell thickness, pigments volume fraction, and coating thickness are optimized using finite difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation to maximize the sunlight scattering efficiency with minimal material usage. The coating prepared with a spaying time of 40 s reflects above 93% of solar irradiance and exhibits an infrared emissivity of ∼94% at atmospheric transmittance window wavelength, leading to a desirable daytime sub-ambient temperature drop of ∼10.9 °C. Building energy simulations demonstrates that 32.6% of cooling energy can be saved per year in China when the coating is used as building envelopes. The coatings also show improved scalability, peel strength, self-cleaning, and weather resistance, which makes them attractive candidates for long period outdoor DRC applications. This work paves a new way to design radiative cooling coatings with low cost and ease of application for the development of highly energy-efficient cooling technology.

Abstract: Perovskite/Si tandem solar cells have emerged as one highly promising tandem configuration of tandem devices for 1-Sun photovoltaic systems. Up to now, heterojunction (HJ) cells have been the dominant silicon bottom cell structure and holds the record efficiency of dual-junction perovskite/Si tandem cells, whereas the investigation on perovskite/Si tandem cells using Si bottom cells that dominate today's mass markets (such as PERC and TOPCon) is still limited. In this work, we delve into the crucial optical and electrical engineering aspects required for perovskite/Si devices based on bifacial TOPCon structures (biPoly™), which has high efficiency potential as a single-junction Si cell, enables TCO-free contacts and is expected to be compatible with current mass production technologies. Simulations predict that such devices can potentially achieve a current density of 20.4 mA/cm2 despite of the parasitic absorption in poly-Si layers, comparable to that of HJ-based perovskite-Si tandem devices. We also demonstrate through simulations that edge and peripheral recombination effects can be mitigated by selecting an appropriate substrate size and employing locally doped poly-Si layers. Such improvements are also preliminarily verified with a prototype device. By carefully designing device structures and advancing fabrication techniques, perovskite/biPoly™ Si tandem cells can come closer to realizing the full potential of biPoly™ cells and achieve efficiencies comparable to those observed in devices utilizing HJ cells.

Abstract: Introduction
Scientometrics is the field concerned with measuring and analyzing academic literature, using specific metrics and data from bibliometric databases. Hematology is a broad area of science and medicine, from which several landmark scientific discoveries have emerged.
Objective
The aim of this report is to provide a snapshot of the landscape of hematology research in Brazil, based on a comprehensive analysis of published studies in hematology whose authors were affiliated to Brazilian institutions from 1980 to 2020.
Method
Articles, reviews and letters to the editor with at least one author affiliated to a Brazilian institution were retrieved from Incytes/Web of Science or Scopus databases. Importantly, only papers classified in the subject area “Hematology” by the embedded algorithms of each database were included.
Results
Considering all published papers, Brazil is in the 22nd position, contributing with around 1.1% of papers in this period. A clear and sustained increase in publication output can be observed from the early 1990′s to the present moment. Publicly-funded higher education institutions were the main contributors to the development and consolidation of the hematology scientific community, which has grown in diversity, with an increasing number of contributions from private institutions. In regard to funding, public agencies have been and remain by large as the most important funder of research in hematology in Brazil.
Conclusion
We suggest that continuous monitoring of the temporal trends of some of the data compiled in our report could potentially contribute to a clearer picture of the development of hematology research in Brazil.

Abstract: Introduction
Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) not only remains the main cause of late mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant, but also has the capacity of causing severe organ impairment in those who survive. The Notch, a highly conserved ligand-receptor pathway, is involved in many immunological processes, including inflammatory and regulatory responses. Recently, mouse models have shown that the blockage of canonical Notch signaling prevents GvHD.
Objective and Method
Due to the lack of data on the Notch pathway in human chronic GvHD, we sought to study the expression of NOTCH components in primary samples of patients who received allo-HCT and presented active cGvHD or a long-term clinical tolerance to cGvHD.
Results
Our results showed a significantly lower expression of NOTCH components in both groups that received allo-HCT, independently of their cGvHD status, when compared to healthy controls.
Conclusion
Moreover, there were no differences in gene expression levels between the active cGvHD and clinically tolerant groups. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies performed in human primary samples and our data indicate that much remains to be learned regarding NOTCH signaling as a new regulator of GvHD.

Abstract: Zirconium (Zr)-doped indium oxide (IZrO) films were prepared by reactive plasma deposition (RPD). The best IZrO film has high mobility of 151.8 cm2/V·s and low carrier concentration of 1.7 × 1020/cm3 owing to annealing treatment and hydrogen doping. IZrO film was used as a transparent conducting electrode in silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells. The SHJ cell (274.15 cm2) has a conversion efficiency of 24.55%, open-circuit voltage of 747.47 mV, short circuit current density of 39.98 mA/cm2, and filling factor of 82.18%.

Abstract: This work deals with the usage of electrically conductive adhesives (ECA) for the interconnection of shingle solar cells. In a detailed study on small-format shingle modules characterized by current-voltage, electroluminescence and magnetic field imaging measurements, the impact of an ECA reduction (usage of ECA dashes instead of a continuous ECA line) as well as the complete omission of ECA is investigated with regards to the electrical interconnection quality. Inter alia, it is demonstrated that lamination can improve interconnection quality in ECA-containing shingle joints and establish interconnection in ECA-free shingle joints by pressing adjacent shingles together and thereby forming a busbar-to-busbar contact of decent electrical quality. In a follow-up experiment, the approach of simply omitting the usage of ECA for shingle interconnection is tested with regards to thermal cycling, damp heat and dynamic mechanical load tests finding only minor compromises, if at all, in terms of long-term stability.

Abstract: Surface passivation is a crucial factor in improving the efficiency of c-Si solar cells. In this work, we develop a boron oxide/aluminum oxide stack (BOx/Al2O3) using the atomic layer deposition technique, and investigate the passivation quality and mechanism on c-Si surfaces. The BOx/Al2O3 stacks display excellent surface passivation on c-Si surfaces after annealing, superior to that of Al2O3 single layers. With the optimal BOx/Al2O3 passivation stack, we obtained a very low dark current density (J0) of 7.8 fA/cm2 (iVoc 725 mV) and 4.7 fA/cm2 (iVoc 714.6 mV) on industrial n-type (5.3 Ω cm) and p-type (3.0 Ω cm) Cz wafers, respectively. The BOx/Al2O3 stack also shows excellent passivation performance on boron-doped p+ emitters (110 Ω/sq), achieving a low J0 of 15.1 fA/cm2. The enhanced passivation quality of the BOx/Al2O3 stack can be attributed to the increased fixed negative charge density after thermal annealing. BOx/Al2O3 passivation stacks also can potentially act as an effective p-type dopant source for laser processing, which would be very desirable for high-efficiency c-Si solar cells.

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by dopaminergic neuronal cell death. Emerging evidence suggest exosomes as a crucial player in the progression and pathogenesis of PD via intercellular communication between different cell types in brain. Exosome release is enhanced from dysfunctional neurons/glia (source cells) under PD stress and mediates the transfer of biomolecules between different cell types (recipient) in brain leading to unique functional outcomes. Exosome release is modulated by alterations in the autophagy and lysosomal pathways; however, the molecular factors regulating these pathways remain elusive. Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are class of non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally by binding target mRNA and modulate its turnover and translation; however their role in modulating exosome release is not understood. Here, we analyzed the miRNAs-mRNAs network which target cellular processes regulating exosome release. hsa-miR-320a showed the maximum mRNA targets of autophagy, lysosome, mitochondria and exosome release pathways. hsa-miR-320a regulate ATG5 levels and modulate exosome release under PD stress conditions in neuronal SH-SY5Y and glial U-87 MG cells. hsa-miR-320a modulates autophagic flux, lysosomal functions, and mitochondrial ROS in neuronal SH-SY5Y and glial U-87 MG cells. Exosomes derived from hsa-miR-320a expressing source cells under PD stress conditions were actively internalized in the recipient cells and rescued cell death and mitochondrial ROS. These results suggest that hsa-miR-320a regulates autophagy and lysosomal pathways and modulates exosome release in the source cells and derived exosomes under PD stress conditions rescue cell death and mitochondrial ROS in the recipient neuronal and glial cells.

Abstract: We present a conceptual approach for the localisation and characterisation of local sites of recombination in high diffusion length semiconductors under photovoltaic field conditions. While established imaging techniques operate in this very regime of uniform “1 sun” illumination, inevitable lateral diffusion of charge carriers veils the origin and severity of localised recombination sites. To reduce this limitation due to lateral diffusion the natural choice is using focussed charge carrier excitation and detection in combination with scanning the specimen. The resulting photoluminescence intensity maps are of high spatial resolution and may be composed of a superposition of a multitude of recombination active defects influencing each other due to the high bulk diffusion length. We demonstrate the feasibility of a self-consistent calibration of the setup quantum efficiency in such experimental condition which delivers a charge carrier density map in absolute units. A solution is presented to disentangle the superposition of local sites of recombination to isolate the actual recombination activity of every site. We demonstrate the feasibility of the approach experimentally on the high diffusion length semiconductor silicon.

Abstract: Special Article
Introduction
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only curative treatment for many disorders and international data shows a growing trend.
Method
We aimed to evaluate the temporal trends in HSCT transplant rates in Argentina. A time-series analysis was performed for the period 2009 to 2018 using the national database from the National Central Coordinating Institute for Ablations and Implants. Crude and standardized transplant rates were calculated. A permutation joinpoint regression model analysis was used to identify significant changes over time.
Results
Altogether, 8,474 transplants were reported to INCUCAI by 28 centers (autologous 67.5%); the main indication was multiple myeloma (30%). The WHO age-sex standardized HSCT rates for the entire country were 153.3 HSCT/10 million inhabitants (95% CI 141.7–165.8) in 2009 and 260.1 HSCT/10 million inhabitants (95% CI 245.5–275.5) in 2018. There was a large gap in HSCT rates among the states and regions. The transplant rate was higher for autologous transplants throughout the years. Within the allogeneic group, the related donor transplant rate was higher than the unrelated donor transplant rate. The joinpoint regression analysis of HSCT rates for the whole country over time showed an observed annual percentage change of 6.3% (95% CI 5.4-7.3; p < 0.01). No changes were observed for unrelated donors during the study period.
Conclusions
Age-sex standardized HSCT rates in Argentina are increasing, mainly due to autologous and family donor allogeneic transplants. A wide variation across the country was found, demonstrating differences in the access to transplantation among Argentine regions.

Abstract: To solve the problems of volume thermal expansion and high chemical activity of metallic phase change materials (PCMs), this paper successfully prepared millimeter/centimeter-size durable Bi@Void@Kaolin macrocapsules. Fortunately, carbon powder clusters from the thermal decomposition of adhesive CMC gathered on the core PCMs, cleverly adding a reducing atmosphere into the capsules. In particular, the buffer voids of macrocapsules were created from the pores and gaps between the accumulated Bi powders, and the method of improving the bulk density of powder cores as core precursors by the cold isostatic pressing (CIP) technology solves the problem of excessive cavity volume. Thermal analysis indicates that after CIP treatment, the heat storage density of the Bi@Kaolin macrocapsule with the unpressurized powder core volume accounting for 50% can be increased by 18.4%–275.0 J/cm3, which is about 2.5 times the heat storage density of the common medium-temperature heat storage materials - concrete and NaCl, under the working temperature range of 240–300 °C. Solid-liquid PCMs need to sacrifice their density in exchange for the necessary cavity volume, therefore the “actual volumetric heat storage density” of PCMs should be specified. The results show that the proportion of sacrificial density of Bi PCM (i.e. the cavity rate of Bi-based macrocapsule) can reach the optimal value of 3.5%, its actual volumetric heat storage density can reach 558.9 J/cm3 at 240–300 °C. Surprisingly, all the Bi@Kaolin macrocapsules showed excellent cycling durability and thermal stability during 500 cycles under air atmosphere and subsequent 24 h overload-temperature oxidation tests.

Abstract: Introduction
To date, 340 antigen-organized 43 blood group systems are recognized, being ABO, Rh, Kell, Duffy, Kidd, MNS and Diego the most clinically relevant. The aim of this study was to assess the distribution of alleles and genotypes of the blood group systems Rh, Kell, Duffy, Kidd, MNS and Diego in 810 blood donors registered in the hemotherapy unit in northwest Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil
Methods
We evaluated the genetic variability of blood groups Rh (c.676G>C and c.307C>T), Kell (c.578C>T), Kidd (c.838A>G), Duffy (c.125A>G and c.1-67T>C), Diego (c.2561C>T) and MNS (c.143T>C) in 810 volunteer blood donors of Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil. The genetic profiling was performed through allelic discrimination assays using hydrolysis probes (TaqMan®) real-time PCR system.
Results
The most frequent blood group genotypes found in our study population were: RHC*Cc (51.5%), RHC*ee (70.1%), FY*A/FY*B (49.3%), GATA -67T/T (93.5%), KEL*2/KEL*2 (93.4%), JK*A/JK*B (53.2%) and DI*02/DI*02 (95.4%). Some statistical differences were observed on comparing the population of this study with populations from other states in Brazil, mainly with population of Minas Gerais, Bahia and Paraná, which showed some differences from the population of Porto Alegre, which was more similar to those of Santa Catarina and São Paulo
Conclusion
The frequency of red blood cell polymorphisms in our study is different from that of blood donors in other regions of Brazil. The results showed the importance of extended genotyping in adequate blood screening and the existence of rare genotypes in Brazilian regular blood donors

Abstract: We report on nm-scale electrical potential imaging throughout As-doped and Cu-doped CdSeTe absorbers using Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). The potential imaging was conducted both laterally and vertically on beveled films using ion milling at small glancing angle. KPFM images electrical potential on the beveled surface and assesses defect charging in the subsurface region within a screening length from the beveled surface. We found that the grain boundaries were positively charged and that there were significant potential fluctuations in both grain boundary versus grain interior and intragrain. We further found that these potential fluctuations decreased significantly toward the front interface. Time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry imaging shows that Se content increased toward the front interface, consistent with Se passivation of defects. The potential fluctuation was induced by defect charging, and the results elucidate different details of the defect configurations and grain structures of the films with different CdCl2 treatment temperatures in the As-doped CdSeTe. The defect configurations in the region near the front interface can be a main factor contributing to the device performance difference. Our potential imaging provides insights about the defects throughout the absorber films, and shows that the potential fluctuation has a direct correlation to the Voc deficit.

Abstract: Accurate determination of the contact resistivity between electrically conductive adhesives (ECAs) and solar metallization paste is a key component of optimizing the electrical performance of bonds based on ECAs, such as shingled joints. This work proposed and validates a methodology that accounts for non–negligible inhomogeneities of test structures based on ECAs and silver screen-printed metallization, such as changes in width of the ECA, to improve the accuracy in the calculation of the contact resistivity. The proposed validation uses statistical theory based on the central limit theorem and the law of large numbers showing that the contact resistivity of bonds based on two different commercially available ECAs can be clearly differentiated with a minimum confidence level of 95% and a maximum error margin of 5%. Moreover, the necessary sample size to achieve such requirements is calculated and shown to be equal to 24 test structures. The validation was done using an acryl-based adhesive loaded with silver flakes (∼10−4 Ω cm), which was compared to an epoxide-based ECA filled with silver–coated copper particles (∼10−3 Ω cm). The validated methodology indicates that the contact resistivity when using the acrylic conductive adhesive is 0.1791 ± 0.0766 mΩ cm2 while when using the epoxide-based adhesive is 0.5025 ± 0.1218 mΩ cm2. Additionally, it is shown that the standard deviation of the contact resistivity is highly dependent on the composition of the conductive adhesive. Hence, the sample size varies depending on the ECA. It is expected that the presented methodology will be a powerful instrument for developers and researchers in the improvement and optimization of ECAs and ECA bonding processes.

Abstract: The presubiculum (PRS) is an integral component of the perforant pathway that has recently been recognised as a relatively unscathed region in clinical Alzheimer’s disease (AD), despite neighbouring components of the perforant pathway, CA1 and the entorhinal cortex, responsible for formation of episodic memory and storage, showing severe hallmarks of AD including, amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, tau tangles and marked gliosis. However, the question remains whether this anatomical resilience translates into functional resilience of the PRS neurons. Using neuroanatomy combined with whole-cell electrophysiological recordings, we investigated whether the unique spatial profile of the PRS was replicable in two knock-in mouse models of AD, APPNL-F/NL-F, and APPNL-F/MAPTHTAU and whether the intrinsic properties and morphological integrity of the PRS principal neurons was maintained compared to the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) and hippocampal CA1 principal cells. Our data revealed an age-dependent Aβ and tau pathology with neuroinflammation in the LEC and CA1, but a presence of fleece-like Aβ deposits with an absence of tau tangles and cellular markers of gliosis in the PRS of the mouse models at 11–16 and 18–22 months. These observations were consistent in human post-mortem AD tissue. This spatial profile also correlated with functional resilience of strong burst firing PRS pyramidal cells that showed unaltered sub- and suprathreshold intrinsic biophysical membrane properties and gross morphology in the AD models that were similar to the properties of pyramidal cells recorded in age-matched wild-type mice (11–14 months). This was in contrast to the LEC and CA1 principal cells which showed altered subthreshold intrinsic properties such as a higher input resistance, longer membrane time constants and hyperexcitability in response to suprathreshold stimulation that correlated with atrophied dendrites in both AD models. In conclusion, our data show for the first time that the unique anatomical profile of the PRS constitutes a diffuse AD pathology that is correlated with the preservation of principal pyramidal cell intrinsic biophysical and morphological properties despite alteration of LEC and CA1 pyramidal cells in two distinct genetic models of AD. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of this resilience could be beneficial in preventing the spread of disease pathology before cognitive deficits are precipitated in AD.

Abstract: Eco-friendly, stable and thermally reliable nano enhanced phase change materials (PCMs) with improved thermal property and photo absorbance are vital competencies for solar energy harnessing. In the proposed research, we develop and investigate the morphological, chemical, optical and thermal features of biochar-eutectic PCM composite for clean energy storage. Herewith, primarily coconut shell-based biochar nanoparticle (BNP) is synthesized through carbonization process in vacuum oven at 130 °C followed by wet ball milling to reduce the size. Coconut shell being a feasible candidate in terms of economical, pore structured and light weight ensures better binding, uniform dispersion and improved intermolecular attraction with PCM. The synthesized BNP is evenly spread into the surface morphology of inorganic binary eutectic PCM comprising of 62% of sodium sulphate decahydrate (SSD) and 38% of sodium phosphate dibasic dodecahydrate (SPDD). Electromagnetic spectrum absorbance in the range of infrared and visible rays increased from 0.09 to 0.84 (833%) and transmissibility has been reduced from 83.7% to 15.11% with BNP. Developed BNP composite eutectic PCM demonstrate higher thermal conductivity (0.715 W/m⋅K) on comparison with base eutectic PCM (0.464 W/m⋅K) owing to the presence of carbon element and porous nature of BNP. Heat flow curves specifies increment in melting enthalpy of eutectic PCM from 202.3 J/g to 218.1 J/g with energy storage efficiency of 71.7%. On the basis of thermophysical properties obtained, the developed BNP composite PCM is expected to contribute effectively for thermal regulation applications.

Abstract: The electrical properties of N-type Recharged-Czochralski (RCz) silicon solar cells are significantly affected by the concentration of metal impurities in the silicon materials. In this work, several N-type RCz silicon ingots were grown using feedstock with different impurities concentration, and the distribution of minority carrier lifetime was tested. It was discovered that a broader range of feedstock impurity concentrations resulted in high and stable minority carrier lifetime of the ingots. Solar cells made from these ingots had an average efficiency of over 24.57%. Meanwhile, the results of impurities segregation calculation and solar cells electroluminescence(EL) test were given. The results indicated that ring defects were the primary cause of differences in electrical properties among silicon ingots produced from feedstock with varying impurity concentrations. Further, the process window to produce high efficiency N-type Czochralski(Cz) silicon solar cells was broadened, and the production cost could be reduced.

These challenges can be mitigated, or even prevented, through appropriate actions if the magnitude of soiling is known. Particle counting analysis is a common procedure to characterize soiling, as it can be easily performed on micrographs of glass coupons or solar devices that have been exposed to the environment. Particle counting does not, however, yield invariant results across institutions. The particle size distribution analysis is affected by the operator of the image analysis software and the methodology utilized. The results of a round-robin study are presented in this work to explore and elucidate the uncertainty related to particle counting and its effect on the characterization of the soiling of glass surfaces used in solar energy conversion systems. An international group of soiling experts analysed the same 8 micrographs using the same open-source ImageJ software package. The variation in the particle analyses results were investigated to identify specimen characteristics with the lowest coefficient of variation (CV) and the least uncertainty among the various operators. The mean particle diameter showed the lowest CV among the investigated characteristics, whereas the number of particles exhibited the largest CV. Additional parameters, such as the fractional area coverage by particles and parameters related to the distribution's shape yielded intermediate CV values. These results can provide insights on the magnitude inter-lab variability and uncertainty for optical and microscope-based soiling monitoring and characterization.

Abstract: Bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9) has been validated as one of the most potent osteoinduction factors, but its underlying mechanism remains unclear. As a member of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family, MMP13 may be involved in regulating the lineage-specific differentiation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). The goal of this study was to determine whether MMP13 regulates the osteoinduction potential of BMP9 in MEFs, which are multipotent progenitor cells widely used for stem cell biology research. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that BMP9-induced osteogenic markers and/or bone were enhanced by exogenous MMP13 in MEFs, but were reduced by MMP13 knockdown or inhibition. The expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) was induced by BMP9, which was enhanced by MMP13. The protein expression of β-catenin and phosphorylation level of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β) were increased by BMP9 in MEFs, as was the translocation of β-catenin from the cytoplasm to the nucleus; all these effects of BMP9 were enhanced by MMP13. Furthermore, the MMP13 effects of increasing BMP9-induced β-catenin protein expression and GSK-3β phosphorylation level were partially reversed by HIF-1α knockdown. These results suggest that MMP13 can enhance the osteoinduction potential of BMP9, which may be mediated, at least in part, through the HIF-1α/β-catenin axis. Our findings demonstrate a novel role of MMP13 in the lineage decision of progenitor cells and provide a promising strategy to speed up bone regeneration.

Abstract: In this study, a novel all-solid-state electrochromic device (ECD) free of indium tin oxide (ITO), tungsten(VI) oxide (WO3), and Li+ or any other liquid/gel electrolytes was prepared by a cost-effective and industrially applicable spray coating technique. The device configuration consists of a pre-formed Al-coated glass substrate for use as a counter electrode in the fabrication of an ECD with a glass/Al/Alq3/PEDOT:PSS structure. The fabricated device (2.5 × 4.0 cm2) demonstrated a reversible color change between a light-blue (off) and dark-blue (on) state, with good and homogeneous contrast. The ECD started coloring at − 0.5 V and was completely colored at – 2.0 V, showing various tones of blue according to the applied voltages. The coloration efficiency was 174.62 cm2/C and the cycle stability was achieved at least 150 times.

Abstract: This paper presents a temperature Accelerated Life Test (ALT) for space solar cells. The test is carried in dark conditions to circumvent the inherent problems of illumination ALTs. This ALT is an evolution of our previous ALT in dark conditions where just forward bias was used. Now, solar cell working conditions are emulated by means of forward/reverse bias. Forward bias emulates electric performance under illumination while reverse bias emulates the shadowing at eclipse periods or any other shadowing event (for example antennas might cast also shadows). The forward to reverse time ratio is 4:1. Furthermore, the high temperatures used in the current ALT (190, 210 and 230 °C) allow a considerable time reduction of the test. The results obtained in this ALT onto commercial GaInP/Ga(In)As/Ge triple junction solar cells suggest that the degradation mode is related with the decrease of parallel resistance, namely an initial degradation by shunts occurs in the GaInP top subcell which is followed by a parallel resistance reduction in the Ga(In)As middle subcell. The activation energy in current ALT is higher (1.06 eV) than in the previous one (0.88 eV). Reverse biasing promotes similar degradation than forward one but more intensely, i.e. in a shorter time. Therefore, reverse biasing produces a significant lower reliability than in previous ALT without reverse bias. Despite this reliability reduction, the time for a reliability of 90% is 32 years of continuous operation at a nominal temperature of 80 °C (typical of many GEO missions). Therefore, these solar cells seem very robust and with a high reliability for many space applications. It should be noted that these figures are related to the degradation caused exclusively by high temperatures and other stressors like radiation are not considered here.

Abstract: An optical function parameterization of polycrystalline MgxZn1-xO (MZO) thin films as a function of bandgap Eg has been utilized in applications for the metrology of CdTe-based solar cell structures that incorporate MZO thin films as high resistivity transparent (HRT) layers. Parametric expressions are applied to facilitate mapping spectroscopic ellipsometry (M-SE) of device structures consisting of glass/SnO2:F/MZO. M-SE is shown to provide maps in the MZO effective thickness and bandgap within confidence limits of ± 1 nm and ± 0.003 eV, respectively. As a second application of these parametric expressions, an as-deposited glass/SnO2:F/MZO/CdS/CdTe device structure has been analyzed by through-the-glass spectroscopic ellipsometry (TG-SE). Such an analysis is also shown to provide the MZO effective thickness and bandgap. The outcome of the TG-SE analysis for this device structure enables simulations of the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of the resulting solar cell assuming different recombination losses within the individual layers of the structure. A comparison of these simulations with the experimental EQE spectrum reveals improved current collection from the front of the device incorporating an MZO HRT layer.

Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted a lot of attention from researchers as the most promising photovoltaic devices due to their outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) and low-cost. Although the PSC have reached a PCE over 25%, the interface between the perovskite and hole transport layer (HTL) still is a crucial factor limiting higher PCE and long-term stability. In this work, we choose an organic molecule Bis(trifluoromethyl)benzo amide (BTFZA) to passivate defects at the perovskite/HTL interface. Owing to a strong interaction with uncoordinated Pb2+, the BTFZA effectively passivated the surface defects, remarkably promoted carrier transportation. As a result, the perovskite device based on BTFZA surface modification showed a PCE increase of 16.4% over the control device. Especially, the fill factor (FF) and the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the modified device increased significantly. In addition, the unencapsulated BTFZA-modified device maintains better PCE compared to the control device after aging for over 600 h in ambient air with extreme humidity and temperature conditions. Results suggested that the introduction of BTFZA is an effective way to regulate the surface of perovskite film aiming at highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells.

Abstract: Photovoltaic converters of high-power (λ = 800–860 nm, ELR = 150–550 W/cm2) laser radiation (PhotoVoltaic Laser Power Converters – PVLPCs) based on AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructures grown by metalorganic vapor-phase epitaxy have been developed. To increase the output voltage, the space charge region of p-GaAs/n-AlхGa1-хAs heterojunction was shifted to the n-AlхGa1-хAs wide-gap layer with a gradual “x”. The technology for embedding a rear reflector based on TiOx/SiO2/Ag into the photovoltaic converter structure by “transferring” the heterostructure to a supporting substrate and the method of bonding to form a monolithic structure of the PVLPC has been elaborated. To operate the heterostructures at an increased power density of laser radiation, they have been designed to eliminate possible potential barriers at the heterointerfaces and the frontal contact topology with a high density of the metal grid (50 μm and 125 μm contact pitch are under consideration) has been employed. PVLPCs with efficiency of 62% were obtained at the power density of monochromatic radiation (λ = 850 nm) ELR = 170 W/cm2. The finger pitch of 50 μm allows keeping efficiency more than 56% even with a fivefold increase in laser radiation (up to ELR = 500 W/cm2).

Abstract: Luminescent down-shifting (LDS) layer was introduced to tackle the issue of poor short-wavelength response of solar cell. Besides LDS effect, coating a LDS layer on the surface of a solar cell leads to a change in surface reflectance. LDS and antireflection (AR) effect are coupled and usually reported as a single effect. For those solar cell with optimized AR, it is difficult to enhance power conversion efficiency (PCE) with the LDS layer due to the variation of reflectance. In this work, we report an obvious PCE enhancement of two mainstream commercial silicon (Si) solar cells with the optimized AR by using methylammonium lead tribromide (MAPbBr3)/polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) hybrid film as a LDS layer. The used MAPbBr3/PMMA nanoplatelets solutions for LDS layer have an absolute photoluminescent quantum yield of ∼85 % (excited by 350 nm) in air atmosphere for more than 30 days, laying a foundation for the realization of effective LDS effect. Theoretical analysis has separated the AR and LDS effect. It has demonstrated that AR effect has a positive influence on LDS effect, and PMMA plays the key role in the improvement of AR. Experimental studies further elucidated the LDS and AR effect provided by MAPbBr3/PMMA hybrid film. Thanks to this combined effect, the application of MAPbBr3/PMMA hybrid film as a LDS layer on Si heterojunction solar cell yields a PCE gain of 0.3 % absolute and that on passivated emitter and rear cell produces an absolute PCE enhancement of about 0.7 %.

Abstract: Introduction
The Evans syndrome (ES) is a rare, often chronic, relapsing and treatment-refractory hematological disorder. We described the clinical features, diagnostic workup, treatment and outcome in patients with ES.
Method
We performed a retrospective chart review of patients aged < 18 years with ES admitted to a tertiary center in Brazil from 2001 to 2021. The analysis of the data was primarily descriptive, using median, interquartile range and categorical variables presented in absolute frequencies.
Main results
Twenty patients (12 female, 8 male) were evaluated in this study. The median age at the initial cytopenia was 4.98 years (1.30–12.57). The ES was secondary in nine cases (45%), of which six patients (30%) showed autoimmune disease (AID) or primary immunodeficiencies (PID) and one presented a spontaneous recovery. Steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin were first-line therapy in 19 cases. Twelve patients (63%) required second-line treatments (rituximab, cyclosporine, splenectomy, sirolimus, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine and eltrombopag). The median follow-up period was 2.41 years (1.4 –7.52). One patient (5%) died of underlying neuroblastoma, one case (5%) was lost to follow-up and four patients (20%) received a medical discharge. The median age for the 14 remaining cases was 12.6 years. Twelve patients (85.7%) were in complete response (CR) with no therapies. Two patients (14.3%) were in CR with chronic therapy.
Conclusion
As ES may be a symptom of AID and PID, a thorough rheumatological, immunologic and genetic workup and a careful follow-up are essential. The second-line treatment remains a dilemma. Further prospective studies are needed to address the optimal therapeutic combinations, morbidity and mortality in this disorder.

Abstract: Introduction
COVID-19 disease presentation is heterogeneous, from asymptomatic up to severe life-threatening forms. Getting further insights into patients with specific diseases is of particular interest. We aimed to identify profiles of hematology patients hospitalized with COVID-19 that would be associated with survival and to assess the differences between cohorts
Methods
A binational cohort of 263 patients with COVID-19 and hematological disease was studied in Paris, France and São Paulo, Brazil. Patient profiles were based on age, comorbidities, biological measurements, COVID-19 symptoms and hematological disease characteristics. A semi-supervised learning method with a survival endpoint was first used, following which, a classifier was identified to allow the classification of patients using only baseline information
Main results
Two profiles of patients were identified, one being young patients with few comorbidities and low C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimers, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatinine levels, and the other, older patients, with several comorbidities and high levels of the 4 biology markers. The profiles were strongly associated with survival (p < 0.0001), even after adjusting for age (p = 0.0002). The 30-day survival rate was 77.1% in the first profiles, versus 46.7% in the second. The Brazilian analysis emphasized the importance of age, while the French focused on the comorbidities
Conclusion
This analysis showed the importance of CRP, LHD and creatinine in the COVID-19 presentation and prognosis, whatever the geographic origin of the patients.

Abstract: In this study, we investigated the effect of Cr doping on CuMn2O4/CuMnO2 and established an oxidation (heat release) kinetic model for CuCrxMn1-xO2 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3) as an extension of our previous research on developing medium-high temperature (500–1000 °C) redox-type thermochemical energy storage materials. Our objective is to develop a reliable model for predicting the heat release power at constant temperature conditions. The as-prepared samples were characterized using XRD Rietveld refinement, SEM-EDS, and XPS analysis to obtain a more precise crystal structure and elemental states. The oxidation kinetic model was established using an isothermal oxidation method which differs from the method (non-isothermal) used in the previous study. Additionally, the pressure term was also taken into consideration. The reaction models and kinetic parameters of CuMnO2, CuCr0.1Mn0.9O2 and CuCr0.3Mn0.7O2 were determined using master plots and Arrhenius plots. Among all sample, CuCr0.1Mn0.9O2 exhibited the smallest oxidation activation energy of 29.932 kJ/mol, which was significantly lower than the previous value obtained using the non-isothermal method. Combining the reaction rate and heat release, CuCr0.1Mn0.9O2 showed the highest instantaneous power output of 4.69 kW/kg at the oxygen partial pressure of 0.5.

Abstract: In this study, the results of non-stoichiometric mesoporous aluminum titanate (mp-AlxTiOy) coating using sol-gel-based block copolymers assisted evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) have been presented. Here, a remarkably durable superhydrophilic coating with photocatalytic and anti-reflecting properties has been reported. With a Vicker's Hardness of 899 HV, mp-AlxTiOy coating on glass substrate indicates outstanding mechanical durability when exposed to the outside environment. Further, conventional accelerated ageing tests like the UV exposure test, damp-heat test, and saline resistance test were conducted to evaluate the endurance of the coating. By measuring the water contact angle, it has been proven that this coating is superhydrophilic. It has been shown through time-dependent degradation of (methylene blue, MB) dye; mp-AlxTiOy possesses photocatalytic capabilities similar to mp-TiO2. Additionally, the mp-AlxTiOy coatings were found to exhibit improved optical transmittance and a reduced refractive index value. The power gain of a conventional Si solar cell was finally studied by examining the I–V characteristics of mp-AlxTiOy coated glass coupons attached to the solar cell.

Abstract: The increasing demand for renewable and cost-effective energy sources requires not only the development of alternative solar technologies, but these new technologies must be stable enough to be used in a real-life application. For this reason, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) must be investigated not only in terms of power conversion efficiency, but also in terms of reliability. In this work, accelerated forward current stress is applied as a tool to investigate PSCs stability and degradation kinetic emulating real-life scenarios. The choice of the hole-blocking layer (HBL) plays a crucial role in PSCs intrinsic instability as well as in their degradation rate, which follows a stretched exponential law. Here, tin oxide (SnOX) and bathocuproine (BCP) are investigated as HBLs observing that for low stress currents BCP-based PSCs degrade faster than SnOX-based PSCs, whereas for large stress currents SnOX-based PSCs degrade faster than BCP-based PSCs. The results also indicated that the major cause of degradation in the devices is primarily driven by the formation of shunt paths leading to cell breakdown. Our findings offer valuable insights for improving the stability of PSCs under accelerated stress conditions and provide useful information for the design of PSC-based solar panels depending on their field of applications.

Abstract: The quality control in solar cell production relies on the acquisition of quantitative performance data (I–V-data) together with imaging diagnostics such as electroluminescence (EL) imaging. The classification of the solar cells into different quality groups based on the performance parameters or the identification of specific defects in the EL-images, such as cracks, is rather straightforward and well established. These techniques are extended in our work as we analyze the quantitative correlation between the two approaches. As a specific example, a quality issue related to the contacting of the solar cells during the solar simulator measurement is considered. We demonstrate that a reliable and fully automated classification of the images with respect to the considered quality issue can be achieved by our artificial intelligence (AI) approach. This approach is different from the majority of state-of-the-art approaches as it does not consider specific image objects or features, such as cracks or spots, but rather predicts an image category for the entire image. The performance of the developed supervised image classification approach based on a neural network is analyzed quantitatively. We show that a clear quantitative correlation between cell I–V-data and AI-predicted EL-image classes can be established. In this way, an early-warning procedure can be implemented to detect this performance related issue using the AI-analysis of the EL-images even when its appearance is rather weakly pronounced and before it can be discovered in the I–V-data. We also present results on the impact of the training data set on the performance of the neural network and key parameters describing the quality of the network.

Abstract: Introduction
The Glanzmann Thrombasthenia (GT) and Bernard-Soulier Syndrome (BSS) are rare hereditary disorders of platelet function. Their treatment often requires platelet transfusion, which can lead to the development of alloantibodies.
Objective
In this study, we aim to develop a strategy for alloantibody detection and to describe the frequency of alloimmunization in a patient population from a single center in southeastern Brazil.
Methods
Samples from patients with GT or BSS were tested using the Platelet Immunofluorescence Test (PIFT). If a positive result was obtained, a confirmatory step using the Monoclonal Antibody Immobilization of Platelet Antigens (MAIPA) and Luminex bead-based platelet assay (PAKLx) was executed. Main results: Among 11 patients with GT, we detected the presence of alloantibodies in 5 using PIFT, with confirmation through MAIPA and PAKLx in 2 (1 anti-HLA and 1 anti-HPA), resulting in a frequency of 18.1%. Among 4 patients with BSS, PIFT was positive in 3, with confirmation by MAIPA and PAKLx in 1 (anti-HLA), showing a frequency of 25%. The two patients with anti-HLA antibodies exhibited a panel reactive antibody (PRA-HLA) testing greater than 97%.
Conclusion
Our study highlights the importance of identifying platelet alloimmunization in this patient population. The proposed algorithm for platelet alloantibodies detection allows resource optimization.

Abstract: In the realm of photovoltaic devices, the future appears bright for polycrystalline perovskite solar cells. However, the promise of their efficiency is threatened by a myriad of degradation mechanisms. These mechanisms, like dark spots on a sunny day, create shadows of uncertainty on the performance of polycrystalline PSCs. Nonetheless, this article comprehensively explains these degradation mechanisms and their impact on grain boundaries in PSCs. The paper investigates grain boundaries’ effects on carrier lifetime by employing various models, such as the Matthiessen rule and the Drude–Smith method. The findings reveal that defect density is the primary factor affecting the material’s performance, and grain boundaries’ size influences its changes. Drude–Smith’s model provides a more precise estimation of the mobility, total scattering lifetime, and PL quantum yield in polycrystalline semiconductors with reduced scattering time. The presented method is verified by feeding extracted parameters into Drift-Diffusion equations and fitting them with reported experimental photovoltaic conversion efficiency data. Furthermore, based on the simulation results and the strong correlation between grain boundaries and the time factor, the study proposes a comprehensive model that can effectively predict PSCs’ degradation time.

Abstract: Introduction
Although not mandatory, medical residency has become a sine qua non condition for practicing in most medical specialties in Brazil. Residency programs are hosted mainly by university accredited academic centers and hospitals in the national public healthcare system, under guidance and accreditation by a national commission. Despite the importance of these programs for the development of the hematology workforce, few studies have addressed their characteristics and impact on society.
Methods
We performed a comprehensive cross-sectional survey of a 35-year alumni cohort from a hematology academic residency program in Brazil.
Results
In total, 86/98 (87.8%) responded to the survey. The mean age at residency completion was 28.5 years, 60.5% of the alumni were women and sixty-four (74.4%) self-declared their skin color as white. Higher rates of parental education attainment and low rates of trainee financial dependence were observed and these patterns were stable over time. While the proportion of trainees from other states increased steadily, the number of hematologists practicing in other states remained stable. Approximately half of the alumni worked both in the private and public sectors, mainly in malignant hematology and in outpatient clinics. Twenty-five percent of the alumni reported prior leadership and teaching positions, mainly as directors of transfusion services.
Conclusion
Our results provide data that can be potentially useful for policymakers and curricular development in the planning of strategies concerning the future workforce of hematologists.

Abstract: The proliferated growth of the Photovoltaic industry (PV) will eventually lead to unprecedented volumes of silicon-based solar waste. Failing to manage high volumes of waste, can lead to a huge amount of silicon metal loss and is also highly conducive to posing an environmental hazard. Therefore, efficient recovery and re-utilization after proper purification of the PV-waste-based silicon are highly obligatory for the sustainable development of the PV industry. Herein, we report the growth of small-size silicon ingots (φ = 0.5 inch, 1.0 inch) produced from recovered silicon from the waste crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar module through the Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) technique. The silicon feedstock was prepared, after the extraction of silicon cells from the used panel and chemically etching contacts, ARC (anti-reflection coating), from the cells in order to recover the silicon wafer. The silicon wafer pieces were pulverized to produce very fine powder and subsequently processed at a different set of temperature-pressure for the study of density variation. The highest density (2.33 gm/cm3) equal to the theoretical density of silicon was obtained for sample grown at temperature 1200 °C and pressure 60 MPa. The purity of the obtained ingots was found to be greater than 3 N and therefore, can find use in different industries.

Abstract: Introduction
Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (allo-HSCT) patients are exposed to acute and chronic nephrotoxic events (drugs, hypotension, infections, and microangiopathy). The need for hemodialysis (HD) may be associated with high mortality rates. However, the risk factors and clinical impact of HD are poorly understood.
Aim
To analyze survival and risk factors associated with HD in allo-HSCT Patients and methods: single-center cohort study 185 (34 HD cases versus 151 controls) consecutive adult allo-HSCT patients from 2007-2019. We performed univariate statistical analysis, then logistic regression and competing risk regression were used to multivariate analysis. Survival was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional-hazards models.
Results
The one-year HD cumulative incidence was 17.6%. Univariate analysis revealed that HD was significantly associated with male gender, age (p 0.056), haploidentical donor, grade II-IV acute GVHD, polymyxin B, amikacin, cidofovir, microangiopathy, septic shock (norepinephrine use) and steroid exposure. The median days of glycopeptides exposure (teicoplanin/vancomycin) was 16 (HD) versus 10 (no HD) (p 0.088). In multivariate analysis, we found: norepinephrine (hazard ratio, HR:3.3; 95% confidence interval, 95%CI:1.2-8.9; p 0.024), cidofovir drug (HR:11.0; 95%CI:4.6- 26.0; p < 0.001), haploidentical HSCT (HR:1.94; 95%CI:0.81-4.65; p 0.14) and Age (HR:1.01; 95%CI: 0.99-1.03; p 0.18) . The HD group had higher mortality rate (HR:6.68; 95% CI: 4.1-10.9; p < 0.001).
Conclusion
HD was associated with decreased survival in allo-HSCT. Carefully use of nephrotoxic drugs and improving immune reconstitution could reduce severe infections (shock) and patients requiring cidofovir, which taken together may result in lower rates of HD, therefore improving survival.

Abstract: Introduction
In Africa, where access to diagnosis and treatment of hemophilia is the lowest in the world, prophylaxis is rarely used in preference to on-demand treatment. There are limited data of prophylaxis treatment from sub-Saharan Africa. The aim of this study was to evaluate clinical outcomes and inhibitor development in people with hemophilia receiving low-dose prophylaxis (LDP) in a sub-Saharan African setting.
Methods
We conducted a three-year prospective study. A once or twice weekly prophylaxis regimen of 25 IU/kg of rFVIIIFc or 30 IU/kg of rFIXFc was given to Hemophilia A and B, respectively. We evaluated clinical outcomes and inhibitors occurrence, determined by screening and titration using the Nijmegen technique.
Results
A total of 15 patients were included in the LDP regimen. The mean age was 6.3 years (1.5 - 10). A significant reduction was noted in the annualized bleeding rate, from 7.53 to 1.33 (p = 0.0001); the annualized joint bleeding rate passed from 3.6 to 1.4 (p = 0.001) and the proportion of severe bleeding, from 86.1% to 16.7% (p = 0.0001). The Hemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS) moved from 9.6 to 3.4 (p = 0.0001) and the Functional Independence Score in Hemophilia (FISH) improved from 25.8 to 30.9 (p = 0.0001). School absenteeism decreased from 7.33% to 2.59%. Adherence to prophylaxis was 89.5% versus 60%. Consumption was 580 IU/kg/year versus 1254.6 IU/kg/year before and after prophylaxis, respectively. Incidence of inhibitors was 23% (3 /13 HA).
Conclusion
The LDP in Hemophilia improves the clinical outcome without a surplus risk of inhibitor development. Using extended half-life clotting factor concentrates (CFCs) is better for prophylaxis in resource-limited countries, as they allow better compliance in treatment.

Abstract: The two-dimensional (2D) monolayer butylammonium (BA)-based halide perovskites are applied for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to ultra-stable and highly crystalline. However, the systematic analysis has not been well conducted for 2D monolayer (BA)2BX4 (BPb, Sn; X = I, Br, Cl) perovskites. Here we systematically investigated the photoelectric and mechanical properties using density functional theory (DFT), further revealing the effect and mechanism of the direct and doping-modulated strain induced by external strain(stress) and pre-strain treatment technology. (BA)2PbI4, (BA)2SnI4 and (BA)2SnBr4 have excellent properties for PSCs. Based on the direct strain regulation, (BA)2SnBr4 exhibits smaller bandgaps and more stable atomic evolution than (BA)2PbI4, and better mechanical properties and smaller electrostatic macroscopic average potential difference (ΔP) than (BA)2SnI4. Based on the doping-modulated strain regulation on 2D (BA)2(Pb1-xSnx)X4, lower Pb-doping ratio induces the nonlinear dependence of bandgaps, which mainly originating from the local compressive strain effect on Sn crystal structure induced by larger Pb-atomic radius. Especially, the double-decker structure (Sn2Pb2-p) obtains excellent stability due to stress relaxation induced by in-inorganic layer homogeneity. We anticipate this work will provide the sufficient guidance for designing and fabricating green 2D or 2D/3D halide junction PSCs to improve both PCE and stability.

Abstract: In the NICU, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a concerning common respiratory complication in preterm and low birth-weight infants. Clinical studies have confirmed that human milk has an important nutritional role for children with BPD, therefore, dentification of beneficial components in human milk that prevent BPD is urgently needed. Our previous work showed that human milk exosomes (HM-Exos) could inhibit apoptosis of alveolar type II epithelial cells (AT II), and the circular RNA (circRNA)-circABPD1 were highly expressed in preterm colostrum milk exosomes. Exosomes transport circRNAs that are stable and may exert anti-inflammatory and immune effects attracted the attention of researchers, but the role and mechanism of human milk exosome-derived circABPD1 in BPD remains unclear. Here, we constructed BPD in vivo and in vitro models through exposure to hyperoxia, verified the effect of circABPD1 and revealed its mechanism through rescue experiments. We found that circABPD1 had circRNA properties, and overexpression of circABPD1 could improve reduced alveolar number, enlarged the alveolar linear intercept in vivo models of BPD, promote cell proliferation, reduce oxidative stress levels and alleviate lung epithelial cell damage in vivo and in vitro models. Mechanistically, circABPD1 targets miR-330–3p and regulates the expression of HIF1α. These results suggest that circABPD1 can improve the pathologoical changes of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, promote cell proliferation, inhibit oxidative stress level, and alleviate lung injury by targeting the miR-330–3p/HIF1α axis, which provides a new idea for the prevention and treatment of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

Abstract: Smart windows, which could save building energy consumption by modulating indoor thermal and light intensity, have attracted considerable attention in recent years. Photochromic (PC) and electrochromic (EC) are two representative working modes of smart windows. Integrating PC and EC on a single smart window is beneficial for adapting to various environments and meeting individual needs. However, it remains challenging to develop PC and EC dual-responsive materials. In this work, we reported two extended viologen derivatives, EV-1 and EV-2, with both PC and EC properties. Photochromic devices (PCDs) and electrochromic devices (ECDs) based on these materials were fabricated successfully. Under UV light irradiation, the PCDs exhibited a significant color change from transparent to green (PCD-1) and blue (PCD-2) color, and the colored state can maintain a long time (2.73 h for PCD-1 and 41.72 h for PCD-2) after removing the UV light. Owing to the extension of the conjugate length of the chromophore as compared with traditional viologens using bipyridine as chromophores, the spectra response range of the devices was extended to the near-infrared (NIR) region. To obtain different light modulation capabilities, we fabricated electrochromic devices using propylene carbonate as solvent. These devices display different colored states (red for ECD-1 and purple for ECD-2) and spectra absorption compared to PCD-1 and PCD-2. Furthermore, a photo/electrochromic device (PECD) smart window system was developed to enhance light and thermal regulation. This system offers four working modes, including off mode, photochromic mode, electrochromic mode, and photo-electrochromic mode, which opens up new possibilities for expanding its applications.

Abstract: In photovoltaic power systems, nanofluids are promising candidates for spectral beam splitters (SBSs) owing to their excellent spectral absorption regulation characteristics. The drawbacks of high cost and instability restrain the practical application of nanofluid SBSs. Here, we proposed a hybrid nanofluid SBS containing carbon quantum dots (CQDs) and antimony tin oxide (ATO) nanoparticles, which has been proven to be an excellent SBS from multiple perspectives. Both CQDs and ATO nanoparticles have low cost and super stability, which ensures the long-term practical application of hybrid nanofluid SBSs. Then, the light absorption characteristics of hybrid nanofluids can be effectively regulated because of the complementary optical properties of CQDs and ATO nanoparticles. Furthermore, the PV/T conversion model and indoor test were used to assess the filtering performance of hybrid nanofluid SBSs. The results indicate that CQD-ATO hybrid nanofluids can achieve a high merit function value of 1.815, which is significantly higher than pure CQD nanofluids and outperforms other nanofluid SBSs reported in the literature. This paper may promote the practical utilization of nanofluid SBSs in photovoltaic power systems.

Abstract: The efficient conversion of SiCl4 to SiHCl3 still presents considerable challenges for the Siemens process. The enhancement of solid-solid interaction between catalyst and silicon particles in hydrogenation of SiCl4 is viewed as a top priority. In this study, CuCl catalyst and silicon particles mixture heated at the vacuumized tube bomb reactor is found to be an effective pretreatment strategy for obtaining excellent catalytic performance as much as 21.2% under the optimum conditions. The vacuum evaporation deposition is favorable for the deposition uniformly of gaseous CuCl on the surfaces of silicon particles and the formation of Cu3Si. The moderate temperature and time of the vacuum evaporation deposition pretreatment will promote the growth of copper compounds and shorten the induction period of SiCl4 hydrogenation reaction. When CuCl and free copper of the pretreated sample are dissolved by NH4OH, the SiCl4 conversion still maintains 19.8%. Cu3Si is employed as the active phase expresses good catalytic performance where the conversion of SiCl4 is positively correlated with the content of Cu3Si.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the possibility to drastically decrease the indium (In) consumption in silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells, using ultrathin (<15 nm) ITO layers on both cell sides, in combination with SiN:H capping dielectric layers. The best ITO/dielectric combinations were assessed using optical simulations. The optimal stacks were integrated on front, rear, and both sides of complete SHJ cells. Two types of nanocrystalline layers (nc-Si:H and nc-SiOx:H) were implemented as selective layers on the front side, and proved to relax the constraints on the front ITO conductivity. Among all conditions including 100 nm references, the highest module efficiencies were obtained with 15 nm front ITO (22.4%), while modules with ITO layers below 10 nm on nc-Si:H showed very low efficiency losses compared to the reference. Integration of such ultrathin ITO layers on the rear side proved to be non-optimal since the Fill Factor (FF) losses are not counterbalanced with current gains (contrary to what is observed on the front side with ultra-thin ITO). Finally, UV reliability tests were performed and showed an enhanced reliability for modules with thinner ITO layers. After 60 kW h.m−2 of UV exposure, modules with 5 nm ITO on nc-Si:H showed the best efficiencies among all tested conditions. Subsequent damp heat tests were also performed and did not show a clear warning against using ultrathin ITOs on the front side, and in the end, modules with nc-Si:H layers feature the highest efficiencies at the end of the reliability sequence.

Abstract: To achieve a high performance in sub-module power conditioning circuits, it is important that power converters are designed in accordance with the photovoltaic (PV) cell impedance at the input. Taking this one step further, exploiting the impedance of cell strings could even support novel power conditioning approaches in PV modules. In this work, we characterize the impedance of eight single-cell laminates based on different industrial c-Si PV cell architectures. This characterization is carried out by impedance spectroscopy in dark conditions at room temperature, and the capacitive and inductive effects are evaluated through equivalent model fitting. By comparing the results for the different laminates, it is revealed how the cell design affects its impedance. Our experiments show that the PN junction capacitance at maximum power point varies for the different cells between 0.30 and 45.6 μF/cm2. The two main factors contributing to a high PV cell capacitance at maximum power point are (i) a low wafer dopant concentration and (ii) a high maximum power point voltage. In high-efficiency c-Si PV cells that will be fabricated in the coming years, increasing capacitances are expected for operation near the maximum power point. Furthermore, the single-cell laminates exhibit inductances between 63 and 130 nH, and our results indicate that the inductance is mostly affected by the number of busbars and the geometry of the metal contacts.

Abstract: Lightweight and flexible solar cell modules have great potential to be installed in locations with loading limitations and to expand the photovoltaics market. We used polyethylene terephthalate films instead of thick glass cover as front cover materials to fabricated lightweight solar cell modules with crystalline silicon solar cells. Because of the absence of a glass cover, the fabricated modules have flexible properties. The fabricated modules were subjected to accelerated degradation tests to evaluate their reliability. The test results showed that these lightweight and flexible modules exhibit high reliability under both high temperature and high humidity conditions.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a design, simulation, and measurement of a single broad-band metamaterial absorber composed of a consecutive layer of conical-shaped SiO2/Al/SiO2/Al. The circular symmetry of the conical-shaped resonator makes the metamaterial absorber polarization insensitive so that the full intensity of the sunlight can be harvested. The physical behavior of the broad-band mechanism is investigated both numerically by finite difference time domain (FDTD) and experimentally. The numerical calculations indicate the origin of broadband absorption is due to the couplings between the two metal layers sandwiched in between two dielectric SiO2 layers. The effect of geometrical parameters and the layer thicknesses are studied numerically and experimentally. The experimental results show the average absorption strength of the metamaterial absorber is around 80% within the spectral range of 400–1000 nm. The experimental and simulation spectra are well-consistent. The proposed platform has potential use in many potential applications, such as solar cells, photodetectors, cameras, etc.

Abstract: Benzyl viologens (BVs) have garnered massive attention due to their remarkable functional ability as a cathodically coloring material and glare reduction agent in electrochromic devices (ECDs). However, BV-based ECDs have some challenges, of which dimer formation due to viologen radicals is foremost, as it extensively damages the device performance. Herein, a new approach is proposed to address this issue in which five novel fluorine-substituted benzyl viologen (FSBV) are synthesized through a multi-step route based on the fluorine-atom count on the viologen moiety. Once synthesized, the FSBVs (0.01 M) were employed as an electrochromic material (ECM) along with tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate/propylene carbonate (0.5 M TBABF4/PC) as a supporting electrolyte and ferrocene (0.05 M Fc) as a counter electrode material in an ECD assembly. We observed that the family of FSBV-based ECDs demonstrated suppressed dimerization tendency, higher optical contrast, fast response time, and enhanced cycling stability compared to the pristine benzyl viologen-based device (BV/Fc ECD). In particular, PFBV/Fc ECD (from the FSBV family), that utilizes 1,1ʹ-bis(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl)-4,4ʹ-bipyridine 1,1ʹ-diium tetrafluoroborate (PFBV) as an ECM, exhibited higher optical contrast (ΔT) of ∼63.6%, high coloration efficiency of ∼304 cm2/C, fast switching time of ∼1.2 s and an excellent ΔT retention of ∼97% after 10,000 cycles, all at 603 nm. The exciting feature of this study lies in the deployment of a highly sensitive and non-invasive technique, electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM), to monitor the ultrasmall mass transmutations caused by synthesized chromophores at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The EQCM analysis revealed that the molecular structure of maneuvered viologen derivatives has a decisive role in determining the mass exchange behavior at the quartz crystal surface, which is reflected in a dissimilar degree of electrochromic performance.

Abstract: A tunneling atomic layer deposited (ALD) AlOx layer was inserted in a Si|SiOx|AlOx|MoOx|metal tunnel diode structure to investigate the impact of fixed interface charge on Schottky barrier height. ALD AlOx provides a synthesis-tunable fixed charge and can provide excellent field effect passivation at the SiOx|AlOx interface. A large (>1 × 1012 q.cm−2) negative fixed charge density was expected to decrease Schottky barrier height on p-type silicon and increase Schottky barrier height on n-type silicon by up to 0.4 eV based on an electrostatic model. Fixed charge density and interface trap state density were measured using a thick layer of AlOx in metal oxide semiconductor capacitor structures (MOSCAPs); Schottky barrier height and specific contact resistivity were measured using a tunneling-active layer of AlOx in contacted structures with MoOx. In some samples, HfOx interface layers were inserted between AlOx and silicon to quench the fixed negative charge. The Schottky barrier height was found to vary with processing conditions but did not have a strong correlation with expected fixed charge density. Thus, while fixed charge may play a role in determining the Schottky barrier height, other parameters also have significant affect. Further work is needed to minimize contact resistivity and elucidate other factors impacting the Schottky barrier height.

Abstract: The presented work focuses on the influence of different stress combinations (in climate-specific ageing tests) on polymer material degradation and electrical power loss of PV modules and how these data can be linked using advanced statistical methods. The statistical analysis is divided into three parts: in the first part, the direct effects of the climatic stresses on the electrical performance are assessed. The second part aims to correlate the electrical degradation behaviour with changes in the encapsulation material, and the third part does the same for the backsheet material of the modules. Time series of electrical data are extracted from IV curves and correlated with changes in material parameters obtained from fluorescence spectroscopy of the encapsulant as well as infrared spectroscopy and colour measurements of the backsheet. The data set analyzed consists of measurements that were taken throughout accelerated ageing experiments simulating stressors typically found for arid, tropical, moderate, and alpine climate zones. Significant correlations were found between the material changes - as indicated by the spectral measurements - and the electrical power loss of the test modules in the course of climate-specific ageing. The results of the analysis provide valuable input for possible measures of preventive maintenance based on condition monitoring of single modules. The methodology developed in this paper allows for an estimation of the power output for modules with identical design and bill of materials using simple, non-destructive measurement methods. The results from accelerated lab tests and the correlations determined from them can be used to predict the electrical power output of installed PV modules. As a result, deviations in module performance can be detected at an early stage and preventive maintenance measures in PV systems can be carried out.

Abstract: In this work, we analyse the light and elevated temperature induced degradation (LeTID) behaviour of gallium (Ga)-doped Czochralski (Cz) passivated emitter and rear cells (PERC). We show that these cells, based on industrial precursors, are prone to LeTID, degrading on average 8.3%rel in efficiency. The degradation and regeneration is slower than in boron (B)-doped PERC cells leading to a greater loss of energy over a 20 year lifespan of a solar module on a German rooftop, since, according to our experiments, regeneration does not start during that time frame. We show that the method of mitigating LeTID by slightly altering the temperature profile during fast firing, previously introduced on B-doped PERC cells, also works on Ga-doped PERC cells, reducing the maximum degradation to between 1%rel and 4%rel. This process does only slightly reduce the initial efficiency of the cell by up to 0.8%rel. Lastly, we show that increasing illumination and temperature from 0.15 suns eq. to 2 suns eq. and 75 °C to 140 °C, respectively, is an adequate way to accelerate LeTID testing on Ga-doped samples by more than two orders of magnitude while achieving qualitatively and quantitatively similar results to those obtained in a standard test.

Abstract: Objective
The accurate diagnosis of mixed-type gastric cancer from pathology images presents a formidable challenge for pathologists, given its intricate features and resemblance to other subtypes of gastric cancer. Artificial Intelligence has the potential to overcome this hurdle. This study aimed to leverage deep machine learning techniques to establish a precise and efficient diagnostic approach for this cancer type which can also predict the metastatic risk using two software, U-Net and QuPath, which have not been trialled in gastric cancers.
Methods
A U-Net neural network was trained to recognise, and segment differentiated components from 186 pathology images of mixed-type gastric cancer. Undifferentiated components in the same images were annotated using the open-source pathology imaging software QuPath. The outcomes from U-Net and QuPath were used to calculate the ratios of differentiation/undifferentiated components which were correlated to lymph node metastasis.
Results
The models established by U-Net recognised ∼91% of the regions of interest, with precision, recall, and F1 values of 90.2%, 90.9% and 94.6%, respectively, indicating a high level of accuracy and reliability. Furthermore, the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed an area under the cure of 91%, indicating good performance. A bell-curve correlation between the differentiated/undifferentiated ratio and lymphatic metastasis was found (highest risk between 0.683 and 1.03), which is paradigm-shifting.
Conclusion
U-Net and QuPath exhibit promising accuracy in the identification of differentiated and undifferentiated components in mixed-type gastric cancer, as well as paradigm-shifting prediction of metastasis. These findings bring us one step closer to their potential clinical application.

Abstract: The longevity and the cost of thermal energy storage (TES) components in solar power plants is a matter of great concern. To address this issue, three kinds of thermal spray coatings (Ni-5Al, NiCoCrAlY, and CoNiCrAlY) were successfully deposited on the low-alloy steel (P91) substrate by high velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) spraying process. The corrosion performance of the prepared coatings in Solar Salt (at 565 °C for 15 days) was evaluated in detail by gravimetric analysis, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Results revealed that all three coatings were quite dense and the substrates were generally well protected by the coatings. Compared with Ni-5Al and NiCoCrAlY coatings, the CoNiCrAlY coating exhibited the best corrosion performance owing to the formation of a dense oxide layer on the surface. Further, it was revealed that despite containing corrosion-resistant composition in NiCoCrAlY coating, the presence of a large number of phase interfaces could be the vulnerable regions that may result in local corrosion failure. Moreover, increasing the content of aluminum and using pre-alloyed powder may be an excellent solution to improve the performance of Ni-5Al coating.

Abstract: Reasonable and efficient recycling of waste crystalline silicon (c-Si) photovoltaic (PV) modules benefits environmental protection and resource conservation. The liberation and separation of solar cells in modules is the key to achieving effective recycling. The recovery of intact waste modules has been studied by some scholars, but few have specifically examined damaged modules. This study focused on modules that have been broken during transportation, installation, use, or disassembly. Two liberation methods, mechanical crushing and pyrolysis were compared from the perspectives of particle size distribution and morphological characteristics of products. In addition, for separating glass particles and solar cells of coarse fraction, an environmentally-friendly technology of gas-solid fluidized bed was introduced based on their shape and density difference. The effects of airflow velocity and fluidizing time on separation efficiency were investigated for different size fractions. Results showed that pyrolysis was a more suitable liberationliberation method for damaged modules. Higher liberation efficiency could be obtained by pyrolysis, and over-crushing of glass particles and solar cells could be avoided. The optimum pyrolysis conditions were found to be at 500 °C with a holding time of 30 min. The recovery and concentration of solar cells in the >4 mm size fraction were 91.09% and 84.4%, respectively, under the following conditions: 85 m3/h airflow velocity; 90s fluidizing time. For the 2–4 mm size fraction, the recovery and concentration were 82.29% and 80.52% under airflow velocity of 75 m3/h, fluidizing time of 90s. This research presents an alternative process for recovering damaged c-Si PV modules.

Abstract: Sb2(S, Se)3 has widely emerged as an absorber material for solar cells because of its favourable optical properties and abundant raw materials. Although the Sb2(S, Se)3 film comprises simple binary elements and has a lesser complex phase than that of quaternary copper indium gallium selenide, the distribution of atoms within its structure significantly affects its performance. More specifically, this effect is attributed to three non-equivalent positions of selenium or sulphur atoms and two non-equivalent positions of antimony atoms inside its unique quasi-one-dimensional asymmetric structure. Consequently, the composition ratios inside Sb2(Sx, Se1–x)3 significantly impact the film's properties, especially the defect properties. The underlying origins of this effect remain elusive. Along these lines, in this work, defect measurements of the Sb2(Sx, Se1–x)3 solar cells with different S-content ratios were conducted using deep-level transient spectroscopy and then discussed in detail. The analysis confirmed that deep-level defects were always present, and their lower density favoured the device's performance. Moreover, the solar cells consisting of Sb2(Sx, Se1–x)3 thin films with 0.3 S-content ratios exhibit better conversion efficiency with lower deep-level defects density and capture cross-section.

Abstract: To obtain a high-performance material with large optical contrast, fast response, stable redox reversibility and easy processability simultaneously, a novel amine monomer, N1, N1'-(spiro(fluorene-9,9′-xanthene)-2,7-diyl)-bis(N1-(4-methoxyphenyl) benzene-1,4-diamine) (SFXMOPb-NH2) was designed and prepared by inserting xanthene group core into two electron-rich triarylamine (TAA) systems. Then, SFXMOPb-NH2 was polycondensed with various carboxylic acids to obtain three high-performance polyamides (PAs), namely SFXMOPb-OA, SFXMOPb-CA, and SFXMOPb-6F, respectively, in which the SFXMOPb-OA possesses excellent properties with good solubility and thermal stability, long cycle stability (cycle times up to 20,000 s and 2000 switching cycles), high coloring efficiency (CE, up to 463 cm2 C−1), and large optical contrast (ΔT, up to 62%). Obvious color transformation from red to blue is obtained in an electrochromic device (ECD). These PAs also reveal memristors properties. It demonstrates that introducing twisted structure and ringlike ether into PAs could pave the way for design and preparation of molecules for fabrication of high-performance EC devices and memristors.

Abstract: Shingle interconnected cells and high-performance silicon solar cells are the main technologies applied for the development of next-generation Photovoltaic (PV). Nonetheless, the assembly process of high-efficiency shingle configuration modules faces several problems. Such challenges encompass the processes of complete silicon cell separation, the proper assessment of the losses during cell separation, and the post-passivation treatment of newly formed edges in the shingle module. We conducted this study to address the aforementioned issues. I) Our findings revealed that the cutting during high-efficiency cell separation should be performed on the back surface field (BSF) side; II) Furthermore, we quantified the slice cutting loss by introducing a rational definition of the cell separation factor K and utilizing the Suns-VOC method; III) Additionally, we developed efficient shingle mini-modules and passivated the sub-cell edge of the modules. These measures resulted in a considerable increase in the output power of the PV module while effectively reducing cell-to-module (CTM) losses. Based on the concept of the “Liquid-based Edge Passivation Strategy (LEPS)”- developed in this work, using a four-sub-cell configuration shingle mini-module, we finally achieved the following increased parameter efficiency: +0.32% of abs, +15.1 mV of open circuit voltage, +0.76% of fill factor, and +7.8 mW of power gain. The results obtained in this research culminated in advancing the methods employed in assembling next-generation high-efficiency PV modules and striking maximum power output PV modules. Moreover, our present findings serve as a technical reference and open up new avenues for the potential photovoltaic industry transformation and upgrading.

Abstract: N2O/Ar gas mixture are used to deposit ultra-thin silicon oxide (SiOx) layer by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), which is used as the tunneling oxide layer in the TOPCon (tunnel oxide passivated contacts) structure. It is found that the N2O/Ar flow ratios strongly affect the properties of SiOx layer, such as deposition rate, the resistance of high temperature, passivation quality, etc., thus significantly affect the properties of polysilicon passivated contact structures and the efficiency of TOPCon solar cells. The deposition rate of SiOx layer and contact resistivity of SiOx/poly-Si(n+)/SiNx:H structure decrease with the increases of Ar flow. However, there is an optimal N2O/Ar flow ratio to obtain the best passivation quality and the champion efficiency. The optimal flow ratio of N2O/Ar= 5:2 is found, and obtain the optimum thickness of SiOx and uniform polysilicon passivated contact. The highest minority carrier lifetime (τ) of 5751 μs, highest implied open circuit voltage (iVoc) of 741.3 mV, lowest single side recombination saturation current density(J0) of 4.79 fA/cm2, contact resistivity(ρcontact) of 2.23 mΩ/cm2 and champion efficiency of 25.06% are obtained at the flow ratio of N2O/Ar= 5:2.

Abstract: With the swift progress of metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs), new Pb-free perovskites represented by Cs3Sb2I9 have demonstrated broader application prospects. However, compared with Pb-based PSCs, their photovoltaic properties still need to be further improved. In this work, an all-inorganic Cs3Sb2I9 perovskite solar cell with micro-offset energy level structure is proposed. In order to explore the influences of energy level matching and internal factors on the device, we use SCAPS-1D (Solar Cells Capacitor Simulator) to simulate the device numerically. It is shown that the micro-offset energy level structure constituted by ZnOS/Cs3Sb2I9/Cu2O significantly improves the built-in electric field and carrier transport path of PSCs, promotes the motion of photogenerated electron-hole pairs between layers, and makes the device exhibit outstanding performance. Further, the PSCs are optimized in terms of transport layer doping concentration, absorber layer thickness, defect density, metal back electrode, and so on. Through comprehensive analysis of the built-in electric field, energy band structure, and recombination rate, the optimal value of doping concentration in the transport layer is determined to be 1019cm−3. In addition, the optical and electrical properties of the absorber layer are investigated by first-principles. Finally, we achieved the optimal parameters in the proposed device structure (FTO/ZnOS/Cs3Sb2I9/Cu2O/C), and the power conversion efficiency reached up to 18.29% with a fill factor of 90.59%. This work demonstrates that micro-offset energy level structure has enormous potential for future inorganic PSCs with antimony as the metal cation.

Abstract: Introduction
Lymphopenia is a laboratory marker of poor prognosis and severity of disease in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study aims to describe the immune profile of a Brazilian population.
Methods
A total of 121 consecutive patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) were analyzed between April and June 2020. Routine peripheral blood counts and multiparametric flow cytometry were performed on admission to assess lymphocytes and subsets (CD3, CD4, CD8). Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected from hospital sources.
Results
The total of 116 patients included 63 (54.3%) males; 76 (62.8%) COVID-19 patients were divided, based on clinical characteristics and mechanical ventilation (MV) use, into moderate (n = 41; no MV) and severe (n = 35; MV) groups. The control group (n = 40) was comprised of patients with SARS of different etiologies. All patients had lymphopenia, with overall lymphocyte counts and their subsets considerably lower in severe patients, when compared to the moderate and controls. Patients with a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (> 15.2) and T-cell lymphopenia (CD3 < 593 cells/µL, CD4 < 326 cells/µL, CD8 < 121 cells/µL) had a higher risk of being intubated and progressing to death. A total of 39 patients (95.1%) in the moderate group and 54.3% (n = 19) in the severe group were discharged; 28 patients died.
Conclusion
Laboratory assessment of the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and T-cell subsets may be predictive of mortality and may be useful for stratifying COVID-19 patients.

Abstract: For the first time, we have successfully combined the transient, steady-state, and small perturbation photoconductance decay lifetime measurement methods into a single system. The three operation modes complement each other and enhance the accuracy of each measurement, effectively compensating for the limitations of each individual mode. The goal is to provide very accurate carrier lifetime τ results as a function of injection level Δn over the entire illumination intensity range of interest for modern Si solar cells. The combination of the three methods not only results in mobility model-free τ(Δn) data with improved accuracy but provides the sum of the excess carrier mobilities as a function of Δn as well. This is important at high injection levels, where modern solar cells operate but mobility models in the literature exhibit significant differences. The experimental setup developed for this purpose utilizes an eddy-current photoconductance sensor and lasers for the precise light control. Maintaining stable temperature for such measurements is a challenge that is overcome by applying smart laser control and advanced ventilation. The measurements yielded excellent agreement in the τ(Δn) values determined in the three fundamentally different modes and provided mobility values close to previously presented mobility models.

Abstract: Introduction
The Band 3 is a red blood cell protein that carries the Dia and Dib antigens from the Diego blood system. The SLC4A1 gene encodes Band 3; Band 3 Memphis is a polymorphism of normal Band 3 and has two variants, but only the variant II carries the Dia antigen.
Objectives
Describe the frequencies of the DI*A and DI*B alleles and the Band 3 Memphis among blood donors, sickle cell disease (SCD) patients and Amazonian Indians.
Methods
A total of 427 blood samples were collected and separated into three groups: 206 unrelated blood donors, 90 patients with SCD and 131 Amazonian Indians. We performed DI*A/B, normal Band 3 and Band 3 Memphis genotyping, using the Polymerase Chain Reaction Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR–RFLP).
Results
The frequency of the DI*A/DI*A genotype was 0.5% in blood donors and it was not found in other groups. The frequency of the DI*A/DI*B was higher in Amazonian Indians (33.6%) and the frequency of the DI*B/DI*B was highest in blood donors (92.2%). All 105 individuals tested were positive for the presence of normal Band 3 and of these individuals, only 5/105 (4.8%) presented the Band 3 Memphis mutation.
Conclusion
We observed a higher frequency of the DI*B allele in blood donors and a low frequency of the DI*A/DI*A genotype in all groups studied. The Band 3 Memphis was found in a higher frequency in the blood donor group. Our findings highlight the importance of analyzing different population groups to gain a better understanding of the genetic association of blood group antigens.

Abstract: A two-step hydrogen plasma treatment (HPT) is carried out for Si nanocrystals/silicon oxide compound passivating contacts to improve their passivation performance. The 2-step HPT consists of a first HPT at a high temperature of 500 °C and a second HPT at a lower temperature of 300 °C. Etching of n-type polycrystalline Si (n+-poly-Si) is suppressed by using low RF power and short duration as the condition for the second HPT. For the passivating contact with thin n+-poly-Si, the implied open-circuit voltage (i-VOC) was improved to 723 mV after the 2-step HPT, which is higher than the i-VOC after the one-step HPT (718 mV) owing to enhanced hydrogenation of the Si nanocrystals/silicon oxide compound layer. On the other hand, 1.4-fold larger contact resistivity (ρc) was obtained after the 2-step HPT. This increase in ρc is probably attributed to the suppression of trap-assisted tunneling. The largest i-VOC value of 744 mV and the lowest ρc value of 12 mΩ cm2 was observed for the contact with 300-nm-thick n+-poly-Si, possibly due to enhanced field-effect passivation after the 2-step HPT.

Abstract: In a recently published article (Lange et al., 2023) [1], we envisioned and discussed a tandem solar cell concept based on a perovskite/TOPCon architecture in p-i-n configuration, that utilizes a p+/n+ polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) tunnel junction and NiOx as hole transport material of the perovskite top cell. A direct contact of NiOx to p+ poly-Si is inevitable in such a device. We investigated that junction and reported how the contact resistivity of the NiOx/p+ poly-Si junction can be improved by orders of magnitudes by intentionally inserting a nm-thin metallic Ni interlayer at that interface through the formation of nickel silicide. In this contribution, we present comprehensive data on layer stack morphology, composition and interdiffusion and the impact on the measured contact resistivity based on (scanning) transmission electron microscopy (STEM) coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) of model samples as well as the real contact structures. Diffusion and reaction processes in the NiOx/Ni/p+ poly-Si layer stack are investigated during the annealing in the temperature range between 100 °C and 500 °C for varying Ni interlayer thicknesses of 0, 1.0 and 2.0 nm. Furthermore, two NiOx syntheses routes are investigated: sputter deposition (s-NiOx) and a wet-chemical approach (wc-NiOx). We correlate the improvement of contact resistivity for both systems and temperatures <300 °C in regard to contacts without metallic Ni interlayer with the observation of pinhole formation within the SiOz. We have observed that annealing the Ag/s-NiOx junctions above 300 °C under ambient air leads to rectifying contacts and high contact resistivities due to excessive interdiffusion of Ni, O and Ag.

Abstract: In order to improve the performance of solar cells and reduce their manufacturing costs, monocrystalline silicon wafers used for manufacturing solar cells are developing towards larger sizes and ultra-thin thickness, and the diameter of diamond saw wires used to cut silicon wafers is also continuously decreasing. These aspects cause uneven thickness and lager thickness variation (TV) of the as-cut wafer during slicing process. The reason of uneven thickness was analyzed from the point of liquid bridge with capillary force between the saw wires in this paper. The mechanical equilibrium equation between the liquid bridge and the saw wires was established based on the Young-Laplace equation, and the theoretical model of the as-cut wafer thickness was derived during the sawing process. The effect of the saw wire tensioning force, span, the diameter of the core wire and the wetting angle of coolant on the as-cut wafer thickness variation was analyzed based on the model. The results show that the increase in the saw wire tensioning force, the core wire diameter and the wetting angle of coolant improved the thickness accuracy and reduced the thickness variation of the as-cut wafer. And the increase in the saw wire span reduced the thickness accuracy and increased the thickness variation. The research results of this paper provide the mechanism analysis for the thickness variation of the ultra-thin wafer during the slicing process. It is of great significance to produce the ultra-thin photovoltaic silicon wafers with the fine saw wire in the future.

Abstract: Although trace silver (Ag) substitution for Cu in Cu2ZnSn(S, Se)4 (CZTSSe) offers benefits in improving open-circuit voltage (VOC) of CZTSSe solar cells, its further development is still hindered by the fairly low short-circuit current density (JSC) owing to the increase of bandgap (Eg) of the absorber layer. Herein, a strategy is demonstrated to mitigate the poor JSC arising from the Ag substitution by tuning the Cu2+/(Cu++Cu2+) percentage in the (Cu, Ag)2ZnSnS4 (CAZTS) precursor solution. Depth characterization indicates that the appropriate Cu2+/(Cu++Cu2+) percentage in the CAZTS precursor solution increases the photogenerated charges separation and carrier transport processes for Ag-substituted CZTSSe (CAZTSSe) solar cells. Benefiting from this strategy, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.57% is achieved when the Cu2+/(Cu++Cu2+) is 50 at.%. The main factor for the improvement of PCE is due to the increase in photogenerated current density (JL) and decrease in shunt resistance (Rsh). It is demonstrated that the increase in JL results from a widening in the depletion layer width (Wd) of the p-n junction and an increase in carrier lifetime, induced by optimization of the Cu2+/(Cu++Cu2+) percentage. While the decrease in Rsh comes from the change of reaction pathways due to the change in Cu2+/(Cu++Cu2+) percentage.

Abstract: Introduction
This study was performed to evaluate the degree of 3-day chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in children with cancer who received highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) to ascertain the efficacy of aprepitant single-dose on dayL 1 plus granisetron and dexamethasone (DEX).
Methods
This clinical trial study was conducted on 120 patients in the age range of 5 to 18 years old who received chemotherapy. Patients were divided into two groups; Group A received aprepitant at 125 mg/kg on day 1 orally, followed by 80 mg/kg daily on days 2 and 3 and Group B received a single dose of aprepitant 125 mg/kg on day 1 orally and placebo on days 2 and 3. All groups received granisetron 3 mg/m2 on day 1 and DEX on days 1 to 3. The primary and secondary endpoints were to evaluate the proportion of patients with acute, delayed and overall CINV within each group.
Results
There were no significant differences between the two groups for vomiting, nausea or the use of rescue therapy. The number of patients without vomiting on day 1 was similar in both groups (96.5% vs. 98.3%, respectively; p = 0.848).
Conclusion
According to the results of this study, a single dose of aprepitant 125 mg/kg was as effective as administering three doses of aprepitant on 3 days. Therefore, the use of a single dose of aprepitant in combination with other standard treatment regimens to prevent CINV in children who received HEC was safe and efficacious and can be beneficial.

Abstract: We investigate the potential of ultra-thin HfO2 films grown by atomic layer deposition for passivating contacts to silicon focusing on variations in film thickness and post-deposition annealing temperature. A peak in passivation quality – as assessed by carrier lifetime measurements – is reported for 2.2 nm thick films annealed at 475 °C, for which a surface recombination velocity <1 cm/s is determined. For films <2.2 nm thick, there is a marked decrease in passivation quality. X-ray diffraction highlights a change from crystallised monoclinic to amorphous HfO2 as film thickness decreases from 12 nm to 2.2 nm. Kelvin probe results indicate that as-deposited 2.2–12 nm films have similar effective work functions, although the work function of 1 nm films is considerably lower. Upon post-deposition annealing in vacuum, all films exhibit a reduction in effective work function at temperatures coincident with the onset of passivation in air-annealed samples. An initial investigation into the contact resistivity in a passivating contact structure utilizing HfO2 reveals a strong post-deposition annealing temperature dependence, with the lowest resistance achieved below 375 °C, followed by a decrease in performance as temperature increases towards the optimal temperature for passivation (475 °C). Limitations of the contact structure used are discussed.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
Objective
To translate, cross-culturally adapt and validate the Sickle Cell Self-Efficacy Scale for application in the Brazilian cultural context.
Methods
This is a methodological study performed in 6 steps: 1- Forward translation; 2- Translation synthesis; 3- Back-translation; 4- Assessment by expert committee, with computation of the Content Validity Index (CVI); 5- Cultural adequacy (pre-test); 6- Reproducibility. A pre-test was performed with the participation of 10 adolescents/young adults with sickle cell disease through a telephone call and their responses were recorded on a form in a web platform. The instrument validation step was carried out with 55 adolescents/young adults with sickle cell disease, 43 of them having participated in the retest. The analysis of internal consistency and reproducibility was calculated using the Cronbach's alpha coefficient and the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), in the R statistical programming environment.
Results
The translated instrument had good acceptance among the experts, reaching an average CVI of 1.0. In assessing reliability, the scale showed acceptable internal consistency, with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.84. In the agreement analysis, the ICC was 0.923 (95% CI: 0.857 to 0.958), which indicates good temporal reproducibility.
Conclusions
Following the process of translation, cross-cultural adaptation and validation, we obtained the Brazilian version of the Sickle Cell Self-Efficacy Scale, considered valid and reliable to be applied to adolescents and young adults with sickle cell disease in Brazil.

Abstract: We evaluate the effect of storage conditions of uncured encapsulant rolls and the potential consequences on photovoltaic (PV) module performance. We show the impact of residual water trapped inside laminated double glass PV modules after lamination and during UV exposure. We focus on ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymer and its stability over 630 kWh/m2 UV exposure (equivalent to 10 years of outdoor exposure in a Central European country). Three storage conditions were tested by simulating different moisture contents to mimic relative humidity variations that can occur when polymeric foils are exposed to an uncontrolled environment, such as the PV module production line, next to the laminator machine. The presence of water during lamination had no apparent impact on module quality and performance after the fabrication but only became apparent during the aging test. The module power loss was directly related to the EVA chemical and physical degradation and varied depending on the storage history. Results indicate that when the storage is not too harsh, its effect can be somehow mitigated. Based on our observations, we leave a door open to the adoption of high-quality EVA polymers in the manufacturing of glass-glass modules. However, the storage and handling conditions prescribed by the supplier should be carefully respected.

Abstract: Monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem photovoltaics have fueled major research efforts as well as gaining rapid industrial interest. So far, most of the literature has focused on the use of currently more expensive silicon heterojunction bottom cell technology. This work demonstrates a perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell based on the industrially dominant passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC) technology. In detail, we investigate a tunnel recombination junction (TRJ) consisting of ITO/NiO/2-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl] phosphonic acid (2PACz) and compare it with an ITO/2PACz TRJ. Specifically, the NiO layer is deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD). Although ITO/2PACz-based tandem devices can reach more than 24% conversion efficiency, we observe that they suffer from a large spread in photovoltaic parameters due to electrical shunts in the perovskite top cell, caused by the inhomogeneity of the 2PACz layer on ITO. Instead, when ALD NiO is sandwiched between 2PACz and ITO, the surface coverage of 2PACz improves and the yield of the devices, in terms of all device parameters, also improves, i.e., the standard deviation decreases from 4.6% with ITO/2PACz to 2.0% with ITO/NiO/2PACz. In conclusion, thanks to the presence of NiO, the TRJ consisting of ITO/NiO/2PACz leads to a 23.7% efficient tandem device with narrow device efficiency distribution.

Abstract: The contact resistivity of interfaces in solar module interconnects has a direct impact on the series resistance of the entire module and fill factor. Thus, this impacts the performance of entire photovoltaic systems. Accurate measurement of the contact resistance is a key component of optimizing the performance of such interconnects. However, this is difficult for electrically conductive adhesive (ECA) based interconnects. This work shows that transmission line method (TLM) test structures based on ECA display non–negligible inhomogeneities leading to inaccuracies when determining the contact resistivity. Seven methods based on two models — the front– and end–contact TLM models (or a combination of both) — were investigated for four commercially available ECAs used in solar modules and their impacts on the extrapolation of the contact resistivity were quantified. It was determined that even when macroscale inhomogeneities (e.g., variations in the thickness of the ECA) are not present, microscopic structural effects influence the sheet and contact resistance. In particular, variations in the distribution of fillers significantly alter the bulk resistivity of the composites and this variability is also clearly correlated with differences in the geometry of the fillers. It is concluded that the best approach to reduce inaccuracies in the determination of the contact resistivity of ECA–based interconnects is to calculate the sheet and contact resistance locally (using three consecutive contacts) employing a redundant and modified test structure. Afterwards, the contact resistivity ought to be computed using the end–contact TLM model and the median should be assigned as the contact resistivity of the sample.
