Abstract: Summary
Polycomb group (PcG) factors maintain facultative heterochromatin and mediate many important developmental and differentiation processes. EZH2, a PcG histone H3 lysine-27 methyltransferase, is repressed in senescent cells. We show here that downregulation of EZH2 promotes senescence through two distinct mechanisms. First, depletion of EZH2 in proliferating cells rapidly initiates a DNA damage response prior to a reduction in the levels of H3K27me3 marks. Second, the eventual loss of H3K27me3 induces p16 (CDKN2A) gene expression independent of DNA damage and potently activates genes of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The progressive depletion of H3K27me3 marks can be viewed as a molecular “timer” to provide a window during which cells can repair DNA damage. EZH2 is regulated transcriptionally by WNT and MYC signaling and posttranslationally by DNA damage-triggered protein turnover. These mechanisms provide insights into the processes that generate senescent cells during aging.

Abstract: Summary
The four-chamber structure of the mammalian heart is established during embryonic development. While key regulators for ventricular development are well studied, regulatory mechanisms for atrial chamber morphogenesis remain poorly understood. Here, we found that angiopoietin-1 (Angpt1), a vascular maturation factor, is highly and specifically expressed in atrial myocardium during heart development. Loss of myocardial Angpt1 in mouse embryo led to severe impairment in atrial chamber morphogenesis. We revealed that Angpt1 deficiency results in excessive deposition of cardiac jelly, which disturbs regulation of myocardial growth, thereby impairing maturation of atrial chambers. Mechanistically, myocardial Angpt1 activates endocardial Tie2 and positively regulates expression of ADAMTS proteases, which is crucial for proper degradation of cardiac jelly. Accordingly, loss of Tie2 also impairs ADAMTS-mediated degradation of cardiac jelly in atrium. Collectively, myocardial Angpt1/endocardial Tie2 signaling in atrium promotes spatiotemporal degradation of cardiac jelly during early cardiac development and is therefore indispensable for atrial chamber morphogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
In mRNA sequences, 3′ UTRs are thought to contain most elements that specifically regulate localization, turnover, and translation. Although high-throughput experiments indicate that many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) also bind 5′ UTRs, much less is known about specific post-transcriptional control exerted by 5′ UTRs. GLD-1 is a conserved RBP and a translational repressor with essential roles in Caenorhabditis elegans germ cell development. Previously, we showed that GLD-1 binds highly conserved sites in both 3′ and 5′ UTRs. Here, by targeted single-copy insertion of transgenes, we systematically tested in vivo functionality of 5′ and 3′ UTR binding sites individually and in combination. Our data show that sites in 5′ UTRs mediate specific and strong translational repression, independent of exact position. Intriguingly, we found that the functionality of 3′ UTR sites can be masked by 5′ UTR sites and vice versa. We conclude that it is important to study both UTRs simultaneously.

Abstract: Summary
The proteasome is the central protease for intracellular protein breakdown. Coordinated binding and hydrolysis of ATP by the six proteasomal ATPase subunits induces conformational changes that drive the unfolding and translocation of substrates into the proteolytic 20S core particle for degradation. Here, we combine genetic and biochemical approaches with cryo-electron microscopy and integrative modeling to dissect the relationship between individual nucleotide binding events and proteasome conformational dynamics. We demonstrate unique impacts of ATP binding by individual ATPases on the proteasome conformational distribution and report two conformational states of the proteasome suggestive of a rotary ATP hydrolysis mechanism. These structures, coupled with functional analyses, reveal key roles for the ATPases Rpt1 and Rpt6 in gating substrate entry into the core particle. This deepened knowledge of proteasome conformational dynamics reveals key elements of intersubunit communication within the proteasome and clarifies the regulation of substrate entry into the proteolytic chamber.

Abstract: The trematode Schistosoma mansoni is a causative agent of schistosomiasis, the second most common parasitic disease of humans after malaria. Calcium homeostasis and calcium-mediated signalling pathways are of particular interest in this species. The drug of choice for treating schistosomiasis, praziquantel, disrupts the regulation of calcium uptake and there is interest in exploiting calcium-mediated processes for future drug discovery. Calmodulin is a calcium sensing protein, present in most eukaryotes. It is a critical regulator of processes as diverse as muscle contraction, cell division and, partly through interaction with voltage-gated calcium channels, intra-cellular calcium concentrations. S. mansoni expresses two highly similar calmodulins – SmCaM1 and SmCaM2. Both proteins interact with calcium, manganese, cadmium (II), iron (II) and lead ions in native gel electrophoresis. These ions also cause conformational changes in the proteins resulting in the exposure of a more hydrophobic surface (as demonstrated by anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate fluorescence assays). The proteins are primarily dimeric in the absence of calcium ions, but monomeric in the presence of this ion. Both SmCaM1 and SmCaM2 interact with a peptide corresponding to an IQ-motif derived from the α-subunit of the voltage-gated calcium channel SmCav1B (residues 1923–1945). Both proteins bound with slightly higher affinity in the presence of calcium ions. However, there was no difference between the affinities of the two proteins for the peptide. This interaction could be antagonised by chlorpromazine and trifluoperazine, but not praziquantel or thiamylal. Interestingly no interaction could be detected with the other three IQ-motifs identified in S. mansoni voltage-gated ion calcium channels.

Abstract: Summary
Oncogene-induced senescence, e.g., in melanocytic nevi, terminates the expansion of pre-malignant cells via transcriptional silencing of proliferation-related genes due to decoration of their promoters with repressive trimethylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) marks. We show here that structurally distinct H3K9-active demethylases—the lysine-specific demethylase-1 (LSD1) and several Jumonji C domain-containing moieties (such as JMJD2C)—disable senescence and permit Ras/Braf-evoked transformation. In mouse and zebrafish models, enforced LSD1 or JMJD2C expression promoted Braf-V600E-driven melanomagenesis. A large subset of established melanoma cell lines and primary human melanoma samples presented with a collective upregulation of related and unrelated H3K9 demethylase activities, whose targeted inhibition restored senescence, even in Braf inhibitor-resistant melanomas, evoked secondary immune effects and controlled tumor growth in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Stress granules are non-membranous structures that transiently form in the cytoplasm during cellular stress, where they promote translational repression of non-essential RNAs and modulate cell signaling by sequestering key signal transduction proteins. These and other functions of stress granules facilitate an adaptive cellular response to environmental adversity. A key component of stress granules is the prion-related RNA-binding protein, T cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA-1). Here, we report that recombinant TIA-1 undergoes rapid multimerization and phase separation in the presence of divalent zinc, which can be reversed by the zinc chelator, TPEN. Similarly, the formation and maintenance of TIA-1-positive stress granules in arsenite-treated cells are inhibited by TPEN. In addition, Zn2+ is released in cells treated with arsenite, before stress granule formation. These findings suggest that Zn2+ is a physiological ligand of TIA-1, acting as a stress-inducible second messenger to promote multimerization of TIA-1 and subsequent localization into stress granules.

Abstract: Summary
The protein p27Kip1 plays roles that extend beyond cell-cycle regulation during cerebral cortex development, such as the regulation of neuronal migration and neurite branching via signaling pathways that converge on the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons. Microtubule-dependent transport is essential for the maturation of neurons and the establishment of neuronal connectivity though synapse formation and maintenance. Here, we show that p27Kip1 controls the transport of vesicles and organelles along the axon of mice cortical projection neurons in vitro. Moreover, suppression of the p27Kip1 ortholog, dacapo, in Drosophila melanogaster disrupts axonal transport in vivo, leading to the reduction of locomotor activity in third instar larvae and adult flies. At the molecular level, p27Kip1 stabilizes the α-tubulin acetyltransferase 1, thereby promoting the acetylation of microtubules, a post-translational modification required for proper axonal transport.

Abstract: Forkhead box c1 (Foxc1) is a vital member of the Fox family of transcription factors which play important roles in numerous biological processes including metabolism, differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion and longevity. However, up to date, the role of Foxc1 in the development of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) has not been fully elucidated. In the present study, the markedly higher expression of Foxc1 was observed in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) of RA compared to control. Besides, we found that Foxc1 had a co-localization with THY1 (a marker for fibroblast-like synoviocytes). Moreover, during the process of TNF-α-induced inflammatory response model, Foxc1 was progressively accumulated in FLSs which was in parallel with MMP-1, MMP-13. Consistently, cell inflammatory response was distinctly hindered by small interfering RNA. Even more importantly, we discovered that Foxc1 promoted cell proliferation by upregulation PI3K/AKT signaling, which was inflammation-dependent. In summary, these data implied that Foxc1 might regulates fibroblast-like synoviocytes proliferation by reducing PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and all above findings provide novel therapeutic effects in the treatment for RA patients.

Abstract: Summary
Antisense morpholino oligomers (MOs) have been indispensable tools for developmental biologists to transiently knock down (KD) genes rather than to knock them out (KO). Here we report on the implications of genetic KO versus MO-mediated KD of the mesoderm-specifying Brachyury paralogs in the frog Xenopus tropicalis. While both KO and KD embryos fail to activate the same core gene regulatory network, resulting in virtually identical morphological defects, embryos injected with control or target MOs also show a systemic GC content-dependent immune response and many off-target splicing defects. Optimization of MO dosage and increasing incubation temperatures can mitigate, but not eliminate, these MO side effects, which are consistent with the high affinity measured between MO and off-target sequence in vitro. We conclude that while MOs can be useful to profile loss-of-function phenotypes at a molecular level, careful attention must be paid to their immunogenic and off-target side effects.

Abstract: Summary
Gene networks are rapidly growing in size and number, raising the question of which networks are most appropriate for particular applications. Here, we evaluate 21 human genome-wide interaction networks for their ability to recover 446 disease gene sets identified through literature curation, gene expression profiling, or genome-wide association studies. While all networks have some ability to recover disease genes, we observe a wide range of performance with STRING, ConsensusPathDB, and GIANT networks having the best performance overall. A general tendency is that performance scales with network size, suggesting that new interaction discovery currently outweighs the detrimental effects of false positives. Correcting for size, we find that the DIP network provides the highest efficiency (value per interaction). Based on these results, we create a parsimonious composite network with both high efficiency and performance. This work provides a benchmark for selection of molecular networks in human disease research.

Abstract: Summary
The age-associated deterioration in cellular and organismal functions associates with dysregulation of nutrient-sensing pathways and disabled autophagy. The reactivation of autophagic flux may prevent or ameliorate age-related metabolic dysfunctions. Non-toxic compounds endowed with the capacity to reduce the overall levels of protein acetylation and to induce autophagy have been categorized as caloric restriction mimetics (CRMs). Here, we show that aspirin or its active metabolite salicylate induce autophagy by virtue of their capacity to inhibit the acetyltransferase activity of EP300. While salicylate readily stimulates autophagic flux in control cells, it fails to further increase autophagy levels in EP300-deficient cells, as well as in cells in which endogenous EP300 has been replaced by salicylate-resistant EP300 mutants. Accordingly, the pro-autophagic activity of aspirin and salicylate on the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is lost when the expression of the EP300 ortholog cpb-1 is reduced. Altogether, these findings identify aspirin as an evolutionary conserved CRM.

Abstract: Summary
Successive cell divisions during embryonic cleavage create increasingly smaller cells, so intracellular structures must adapt accordingly. Mitotic spindle size correlates with cell size, but the mechanisms for this scaling remain unclear. Using live cell imaging, we analyzed spindle scaling during embryo cleavage in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus. We reveal a common scaling mechanism, where the growth rate of spindle microtubules scales with cell volume, which explains spindle shortening. Spindle assembly timing is, however, constant throughout successive divisions. Analyses in silico suggest that controlling the microtubule growth rate is sufficient to scale spindle length and maintain a constant assembly timing. We tested our in silico predictions to demonstrate that modulating cell volume or microtubule growth rate in vivo induces a proportional spindle size change. Our results suggest that scalability of the microtubule growth rate when cell size varies adapts spindle length to cell volume.

Abstract: Summary
Ciliopathies are a group of genetic disorders caused by a failure to form functional cilia. Due to a lack of structural information, it is currently poorly understood how ciliopathic mutations affect protein functionality to give rise to the underlying disease. Using X-ray crystallography, we show that the ciliopathy-associated centriolar protein CEP120 contains three C2 domains. The point mutations V194A and A199P, which cause Joubert syndrome (JS) and Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (JATD), respectively, both reduce the thermostability of the second C2 domain by targeting residues that point toward its hydrophobic core. Genome-engineered cells homozygous for these mutations have largely normal centriole numbers but show reduced CEP120 levels, compromised recruitment of distal centriole markers, and deficient cilia formation. Our results provide insight into the disease mechanism of two ciliopathic mutations in CEP120, identify putative binding partners of CEP120 C2B, and suggest a complex genotype-phenotype relation of the CEP120 ciliopathy alleles.

Abstract: Summary
B cell responses are regulated by antigen acquisition, processing, and presentation to helper T cells. These functions are thought to depend on contractile activity of non-muscle myosin IIa. Here, we show that B cell-specific deletion of the myosin IIa heavy chain reduced the numbers of bone marrow B cell precursors and splenic marginal zone, peritoneal B1b, and germinal center B cells. In addition, myosin IIa-deficient follicular B cells acquired an activated phenotype and were less efficient in chemokinesis and extraction of membrane-presented antigens. Moreover, myosin IIa was indispensable for cytokinesis. Consequently, mice with myosin IIa-deficient B cells harbored reduced serum immunoglobulin levels and did not mount robust antibody responses when immunized. Altogether, these data indicate that myosin IIa is a negative regulator of B cell activation but a positive regulator of antigen acquisition from antigen-presenting cells and that myosin IIa is essential for B cell development, proliferation, and antibody responses.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer and the second most frequent cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The multikinase inhibitor sorafenib is the only treatment option for advanced HCC. Due to tumor heterogeneity, its efficacy greatly varies between patients and is limited due to adverse effects and drug resistance. Current in vitro models fail to recapitulate key features of HCCs. We report the generation of long-term organoid cultures from tumor needle biopsies of HCC patients with various etiologies and tumor stages. HCC organoids retain the morphology as well as the expression pattern of HCC tumor markers and preserve the genetic heterogeneity of the originating tumors. In a proof-of-principle study, we show that liver cancer organoids can be used to test sensitivity to sorafenib. In conclusion, organoid models can be derived from needle biopsies of liver cancers and provide a tool for developing tailored therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Promotion of long-term depression (LTD) mechanisms by synaptotoxic soluble oligomers of amyloid-β (Aß) has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Previously, LTD was induced by relatively non-specific electrical stimulation. Exploiting optogenetics, we studied LTD using a more physiologically diffuse spatial pattern of selective pathway activation in the rat hippocampus in vivo. This relatively sparse synaptic LTD requires both the ion channel function and GluN2B subunit of the NMDA receptor but, in contrast to electrically induced LTD, is not facilitated by boosting endogenous muscarinic acetylcholine or metabotropic glutamate 5 receptor activation. Although in the absence of Aß, there is no evidence of hippocampal LTD asymmetry, in the presence of Aß, the induction of LTD is preferentially enhanced in the left hippocampus in an mGluR5-dependent manner. This circuit-selective disruption of synaptic plasticity by Aß provides a route to understanding the development of aberrant brain lateralization in AD.

Abstract: Summary
Dysfunctions in mitochondrial dynamics and metabolism are common pathological processes associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD). It was recently shown that an inherited form of PD and dementia is caused by mutations in the OPA1 gene, which encodes for a key player in mitochondrial fusion and structure. iPSC-derived neural cells from these patients exhibited severe mitochondrial fragmentation, respiration impairment, ATP deficits, and heightened oxidative stress. Reconstitution of normal levels of OPA1 in PD-derived neural cells normalized mitochondria morphology and function. OPA1-mutated neuronal cultures showed reduced survival in vitro. Intriguingly, selective inhibition of necroptosis effectively rescued this survival deficit. Additionally, dampening necroptosis in MPTP-treated mice protected from DA neuronal cell loss. This human iPSC-based model captures both early pathological events in OPA1 mutant neural cells and the beneficial effects of blocking necroptosis, highlighting this cell death process as a potential therapeutic target for PD.

Abstract: Ca2+ entry through store-operated Ca2+ channels (SOCs) in the plasma membrane (PM) of hepatocytes plays a central role in the hormonal regulation of liver metabolism. SOCs are composed of Orai1, the channel pore protein, and STIM1, the activator protein, and are regulated by hormones and reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition to Orai1, STIM1 also interacts with several other intracellular proteins. Most previous studies of the cellular functions of Orai1 and STIM1 have employed immortalised cells in culture expressing ectopic proteins tagged with a fluorescent polypeptide such as GFP. Little is known about the intracellular distributions of endogenous Orai1 and STIM1. The aims are to determine the intracellular distribution of endogenous Orai1 and STIM1 in hepatocytes and to identify novel STIM1 binding proteins. Subcellular fractions of rat liver were prepared by homogenisation and differential centrifugation. Orai1 and STIM1 were identified and quantified by western blot. Orai1 was found in the PM (0.03%), heavy (44%) and light (27%) microsomal fractions, and STIM1 in the PM (0.09%), and heavy (85%) and light (13%) microsomal fractions. Immunoprecipitation of STIM1 followed by LC/MS or western blot identified peroxiredoxin-4 (Prx-4) as a potential STIM1 binding protein. Prx-4 was found principally in the heavy microsomal fraction. Knockdown of Prx-4 using siRNA, or inhibition of Prx-4 using conoidin A, did not affect Ca2+ entry through SOCs but rendered SOCs susceptible to inhibition by H2O2. It is concluded that, in hepatocytes, a considerable proportion of endogenous Orai1 and STIM1 is located in the rough ER. In the rough ER, STIM1 interacts with Prx-4, and this interaction may contribute to the regulation by ROS of STIM1 and SOCs.

Abstract: Summary
Intratumoral CD103+ dendritic cells (DCs) are necessary for anti-tumor immunity. Here we evaluated the expression of immune regulators by CD103+ DCs in a murine model of breast cancer and identified expression of TIM-3 as a target for therapy. Anti-TIM-3 antibody improved response to paclitaxel chemotherapy in models of triple-negative and luminal B disease, with no evidence of toxicity. Combined efficacy was CD8+ T cell dependent and associated with increased granzyme B expression; however, TIM-3 expression was predominantly localized to myeloid cells in both human and murine tumors. Gene expression analysis identified upregulation of Cxcl9 within intratumoral DCs during combination therapy, and therapeutic efficacy was ablated by CXCR3 blockade, Batf3 deficiency, or Irf8 deficiency.

Abstract: Summary
Characterization of the cardiac cellulome, the network of cells that form the heart, is essential for understanding cardiac development and normal organ function and for formulating precise therapeutic strategies to combat heart disease. Recent studies have reshaped our understanding of cardiac cellular composition and highlighted important functional roles for non-myocyte cell types. In this study, we characterized single-cell transcriptional profiles of the murine non-myocyte cardiac cellular landscape using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Detailed molecular analyses revealed the diversity of the cardiac cellulome and facilitated the development of techniques to isolate understudied cardiac cell populations, such as mural cells and glia. Our analyses also revealed extensive networks of intercellular communication and suggested prevalent sexual dimorphism in gene expression in the heart. This study offers insights into the structure and function of the mammalian cardiac cellulome and provides an important resource that will stimulate studies in cardiac cell biology.

Abstract: Summary
HER2-driven cancers require phosphatidylinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling through HER3 to promote tumor growth and survival. The therapeutic benefit of HER2-targeting agents, which depend on PI3K/Akt inhibition, can be overcome by hyperactivation of the heregulin (HRG)/HER3 pathway. Here we describe an unbiased phenotypic combinatorial screening approach to identify a bispecific immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody against HER2 and HER3. In tumor models resistant to HER2-targeting agents, the bispecific IgG1 potently inhibits the HRG/HER3 pathway and downstream PI3K/Akt signaling via a “dock & block” mechanism. This bispecific IgG1 is a potentially effective therapy for breast cancer and other tumors with hyperactivated HRG/HER3 signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Dentate gyrus (DG) development requires specification of granule cell (GC) progenitors in the hippocampal neuroepithelium, as well as their proliferation and migration into the primordial DG. We identify the Plexin family members Plxna2 and Plxna4 as important regulators of DG development. Distribution of immature GCs is regulated by Sema5A signaling through PlxnA2 and requires a functional PlxnA2 GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain and Rap1 small GTPases. In adult Plxna2−/− but not Plxna2-GAP-deficient mice, the dentate GC layer is severely malformed, neurogenesis is compromised, and mossy fibers form aberrant synaptic boutons within CA3. Behavioral studies with Plxna2−/− mice revealed deficits in associative learning, sociability, and sensorimotor gating—traits commonly observed in neuropsychiatric disorder. Remarkably, while morphological defects are minimal in Plxna2-GAP-deficient brains, defects in fear memory and sensorimotor gating persist. Since allelic variants of human PLXNA2 and RAP1 associate with schizophrenia, our studies identify a biochemical pathway important for brain development and mental health.

Abstract: Summary
High salt intake is one independent risk factor for cardiac hypertrophy. Polycystic kidney disease 2-like 1 (PKD2L1, also called TRPP3) acts as a sour sensor in taste cells, and its possible role in the cardiovascular system is unknown. Here, we report that knockout of PKD2L1 exacerbated high-salt diet (HSD)-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, accompanied by cardiac dysfunction and reduced cardiac mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and enzyme activity. Furthermore, knockdown of PKD2L1 led to more serious mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and reduced Ca2+ uptake in cardiomyocytes on high salt loading. Mechanistically, PKD2L1 deficiency increased p300-mediated acetylation of histone 3 lysine 27 on the promoter of sodium/calcium exchange 1 (NCX1) by repressing AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity, resulting in NCX1 overexpression and mitochondrial Ca2+ overload. These results reveal an inhibitory effect of PKD2L1 on cardiac hypertrophy and provide a mechanistic insight into the link between mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis and cardiac hypertrophy.

Abstract: Summary
Cognitive abilities, such as volitional attention, operate under top-down, executive frontal cortical control of hierarchically lower structures. The circuit mechanisms underlying this process are unresolved. The claustrum possesses interconnectivity with many cortical areas and, thus, is hypothesized to orchestrate the cortical mantle for top-down control. Whether the claustrum receives top-down input and how this input may be processed by the claustrum have yet to be formally tested, however. We reveal that a rich anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) input to the claustrum encodes a preparatory top-down information signal on a five-choice response assay that is necessary for optimal task performance. We further show that ACC input monosynaptically targets claustrum inhibitory interneurons and spiny glutamatergic projection neurons, the latter of which amplify ACC input in a manner that is powerfully constrained by claustrum inhibitory microcircuitry. These results demonstrate ACC input to the claustrum is critical for top-down control guiding action.

Abstract: Summary
Double-strand breaks (DSBs) are critical DNA lesions that robustly activate the elaborate DNA damage response (DDR) network. We identified a critical player in DDR fine-tuning: the E3/E4 ubiquitin ligase UBE4A. UBE4A’s recruitment to sites of DNA damage is dependent on primary E3 ligases in the DDR and promotes enhancement and sustainment of K48- and K63-linked ubiquitin chains at these sites. This step is required for timely recruitment of the RAP80 and BRCA1 proteins and proper organization of RAP80- and BRCA1-associated protein complexes at DSB sites. This pathway is essential for optimal end resection at DSBs, and its abrogation leads to upregulation of the highly mutagenic alternative end-joining repair at the expense of error-free homologous recombination repair. Our data uncover a critical regulatory level in the DSB response and underscore the importance of fine-tuning the complex DDR network for accurate and balanced execution of DSB repair.

Abstract: Summary
The tumor suppressor p53 limits tumorigenesis by inducing apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and senescence. Although p53 is known to limit inflammation during tumor development, its role in regulating chronic lung inflammation is less well understood. To elucidate the function of airway epithelial p53 in such inflammation, we subjected genetically modified mice, whose bronchial epithelial club cells lack p53, to repetitive inhalations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an exposure that leads to severe chronic bronchitis and airway senescence in wild-type mice. Surprisingly, the club cell p53 knockout mice exhibited reduced airway senescence and bronchitis in response to chronic LPS exposure and were significantly protected from global lung destruction. Furthermore, pharmacological elimination of senescent cells also protected wild-type mice from chronic LPS-induced bronchitis. Our results implicate p53 in induction of club-cell senescence and correlate epithelial cell senescence of chronic airway inflammation and lung destruction.

Abstract: Summary
The formation of central CD8 T cell memory in response to infection depends on the transcription factor Tcf1 (Tcf7). Tcf1 is expressed at high levels in naive CD8 T cells but downregulated in most CD8 T cells during effector differentiation. The relevance of Tcf1 downregulation for effector differentiation and the signals controlling Tcf1 expression have not been elucidated. Here, we show that systemic inflammatory signals downregulated Tcf1 in CD8 T cells during dendritic cell vaccination and bacterial infections. The suppressive effect was mediated by the inflammatory cytokine interleukin 12 (IL-12), which acted via STAT4 in CD8 T cells. IL-12-induced Tcf1 downregulation required cell cycling, occurred at the transcriptional level, and was prevented in part by inhibiting DNA methyltransferases. Absence of Tcf1 during T cell priming circumvented the need of systemic inflammation for effector differentiation. We conclude that silencing of Tcf1 by systemic inflammation facilitates effector CD8 T cell differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
DksA and ppGpp are the central players in the stringent response and mediate a complete reprogramming of the transcriptome. A major component of the response is a reduction in ribosome synthesis, which is accomplished by the synergistic action of DksA and ppGpp bound to RNA polymerase (RNAP) inhibiting transcription of rRNAs. Here, we report the X-ray crystal structures of Escherichia coli RNAP in complex with DksA alone and with ppGpp. The structures show that DksA accesses the template strand at the active site and the downstream DNA binding site of RNAP simultaneously and reveal that binding of the allosteric effector ppGpp reshapes the RNAP–DksA complex. The structural data support a model for transcriptional inhibition in which ppGpp potentiates the destabilization of open complexes by DksA. This work establishes a structural basis for understanding the pleiotropic effects of DksA and ppGpp on transcriptional regulation in proteobacteria.

Abstract: Summary
The ability of specific neurons to regenerate their axons after injury is governed by cell-intrinsic regeneration pathways. However, the mechanisms regulating axon regeneration are not well understood. Here, we identify the brc-2 gene encoding a homolog of the mammalian BRCA2 tumor suppressor as a regulator of axon regeneration in Caenorhabditis elegans motor neurons. We show that the RHO-1/Rho GTPase-LET-502/ROCK (Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase)-regulatory non-muscle myosin light-chain (MLC-4/MLC) phosphorylation signaling pathway regulates axon regeneration. BRC-2 functions between RHO-1 and LET-502, suggesting that BRC-2 is required for the activation of LET-502 by RHO-1-GTP. We also find that one component that interacts with BRC-2, the ALP (α-actinin-associated LIM protein)/Enigma protein ALP-1, is required for regeneration and acts between LET-502 and MLC-4 phosphorylation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ALP-1 associates with LET-502 and MLC-4. Thus, ALP-1 serves as a platform to activate MLC-4 phosphorylation mediated by the RHO-1–LET-502 signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Adaptive survival requires the coordination of nutrient availability with expenditure of cellular resources. For example, in nutrient-limited environments, 50% of all S. cerevisiae genes synchronize and exhibit periodic bursts of expression in coordination with respiration and cell division in the yeast metabolic cycle (YMC). Despite the importance of metabolic and proliferative synchrony, the majority of YMC regulators are currently unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the INO80 chromatin-remodeling complex is required to coordinate respiration and cell division with periodic gene expression. Specifically, INO80 mutants have severe defects in oxygen consumption and promiscuous cell division that is no longer coupled with metabolic status. In mutant cells, chromatin accessibility of periodic genes, including TORC1-responsive genes, is relatively static, concomitant with severely attenuated gene expression. Collectively, these results reveal that the INO80 complex mediates metabolic signaling to chromatin to restrict proliferation to metabolically optimal states.

Abstract: Summary
How artificial environmental cues are biologically integrated and transgenerationally inherited is still poorly understood. Here, we investigate the mechanisms of inheritance of reproductive outcomes elicited by the model environmental chemical Bisphenol A in C. elegans. We show that Bisphenol A (BPA) exposure causes the derepression of an epigenomically silenced transgene in the germline for 5 generations, regardless of ancestral response. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), histone modification quantitation, and immunofluorescence assays revealed that this effect is associated with a reduction of the repressive marks H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 in whole worms and in germline nuclei in the F3, as well as with reproductive dysfunctions, including germline apoptosis and embryonic lethality. Furthermore, targeting of the Jumonji demethylases JMJD-2 and JMJD-3/UTX-1 restores H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 levels, respectively, and it fully alleviates the BPA-induced transgenerational effects. Together, our results demonstrate the central role of repressive histone modifications in the inheritance of reproductive defects elicited by a common environmental chemical exposure.

Abstract: Mutations in spliceosome components have been implicated in carcinogenesis of various types of cancer. One of the most frequently found is U2AF1 S34F missense mutation. Functional analyses of this mutation have been largely limited to hematological malignancies although the mutation is also frequently seen in other cancer types including lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). We examined the impact of knockdown (KD) of wild type (wt) U2AF1 and ectopic expression of two splice variant S34F mutant proteins in terms of alternative splicing (AS) pattern and cell cycle progression in A549 lung cancer cells. We demonstrate that induction of distinct AS events and disruption of mitosis at distinct sub-stages result from KD and ectopic expression of the mutant proteins. Importantly, when compared with the splicing pattern seen in LUAD patients with U2AF1 S34F mutation, ectopic expression of S34F mutants but not KD was shown to result in common AS events in several genes involved in cell cycle progression. Our study thus points to an active role of U2AF1 S34F mutant protein in inducing cell cycle dysregulation and mitotic stress. In addition, alternatively spliced genes which we describe here may represent novel potential markers of lung cancer development.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer cells often express differentiation programs unrelated to their tissue of origin, although the contribution of these aberrant phenotypes to malignancy is poorly understood. An aggressive subgroup of medulloblastoma, a malignant pediatric brain tumor of the cerebellum, expresses a photoreceptor differentiation program normally expressed in the retina. We establish that two photoreceptor-specific transcription factors, NRL and CRX, are master regulators of this program and are required for tumor maintenance in this subgroup. Beyond photoreceptor lineage genes, we identify BCL-XL as a key transcriptional target of NRL and provide evidence substantiating anti-BCL therapy as a rational treatment opportunity for select MB patients. Our results highlight the utility of studying aberrant differentiation programs in cancer and their potential as selective therapeutic vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Summary
Chromosomal rearrangements resulting in the fusion of TMPRSS2, an androgen-regulated gene, and the ETS family transcription factor ERG occur in over half of prostate cancers. However, the mechanism by which ERG promotes oncogenic gene expression and proliferation remains incompletely understood. Here, we identify a binding interaction between ERG and the mammalian SWI/SNF (BAF) ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex, which is conserved among other oncogenic ETS factors, including ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5. We find that ERG drives genome-wide retargeting of BAF complexes in a manner dependent on binding of ERG to the ETS DNA motif. Moreover, ERG requires intact BAF complexes for chromatin occupancy and BAF complex ATPase activity for target gene regulation. In a prostate organoid model, BAF complexes are required for ERG-mediated basal-to-luminal transition, a hallmark of ERG activity in prostate cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Short-term memory (STM) is crucial for animals to hold information for a small period of time. Persistent or recurrent neural activity, together with neural oscillations, is known to encode the STM at the cellular level. However, the coding mechanisms at the microcircuitry level remain a mystery. Here, we performed two-photon imaging on behaving mice to monitor the activity of neuronal microcircuitry. We discovered a neuronal subpopulation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) that exhibited emergent properties in a context-dependent manner underlying a STM-like behavior paradigm. These neuronal subpopulations exclusively comprise excitatory neurons and mainly represent a group of neurons with stronger functional connections. Microcircuitry plasticity was maintained for minutes and was absent in an animal model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Thus, these results point to a functional coding mechanism that relies on the emergent behavior of a functionally defined neuronal assembly to encode STM.

Abstract: Summary
The precise function and role of nucleosome assembly protein 1-like 1 (Nap1l1) in brain development are unclear. Here, we find that Nap1l1 knockdown decreases neural progenitor cell (NPC) proliferation and induces premature neuronal differentiation during cortical development. A similar deficiency in embryonic neurogenesis was observed in Nap1l1 knockout (KO) mice, which were generated using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis indicates that Ras-associated domain family member 10 (RassF10) may be the downstream target of Nap1l1. Furthermore, we found that Nap1l1 regulates RassF10 expression by promoting SETD1A-mediated H3K4 trimethylation at the RassF10 promoter. Nap1l1 KO defects may be rescued by RassF10 overexpression, suggesting that Nap1l1 controls NPC differentiation through RassF10. Our findings reveal an essential role for the Nap1l1 histone chaperone in cortical neurogenesis during early embryonic brain development.

Abstract: Summary
We provide a comprehensive analysis of transcription in real time by T7 RNA Polymerase (RNAP) using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer by monitoring the entire life history of transcription initiation, including stepwise RNA synthesis with near base-pair resolution, abortive cycling, and transition into elongation. Kinetically branching pathways were observed for abortive initiation with an RNAP either recycling on the same promoter or exchanging with another RNAP from solution. We detected fast and slow populations of RNAP in their transition into elongation, consistent with the efficient and delayed promoter release, respectively, observed in ensemble studies. Real-time monitoring of abortive cycling using three-probe analysis showed that the initiation events are stochastically branched into productive and failed transcription. The abortive products are generated primarily from initiation events that fail to progress to elongation, and a majority of the productive events transit to elongation without making abortive products.

Abstract: Summary
Primary cilia are sensory organelles that protrude from the cell membrane. Defects in the primary cilium cause ciliopathy disorders, with retinal degeneration as a prominent phenotype. Here, we demonstrate that the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), essential for photoreceptor development and function, requires a functional primary cilium for complete maturation and that RPE maturation defects in ciliopathies precede photoreceptor degeneration. Pharmacologically enhanced ciliogenesis in wild-type induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-RPE leads to fully mature and functional cells. In contrast, ciliopathy patient-derived iPSC-RPE and iPSC-RPE with a knockdown of ciliary-trafficking protein remain immature, with defective apical processes, reduced functionality, and reduced adult-specific gene expression. Proteins of the primary cilium regulate RPE maturation by simultaneously suppressing canonical WNT and activating PKCδ pathways. A similar cilium-dependent maturation pathway exists in lung epithelium. Our results provide insights into ciliopathy-induced retinal degeneration, demonstrate a developmental role for primary cilia in epithelial maturation, and provide a method to mature iPSC epithelial cells for clinical applications.

Abstract: Summary
The splicing factor SRSF1 promotes nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a quality control mechanism that degrades mRNAs with premature termination codons (PTCs). Here we show that transcript-bound SRSF1 increases the binding of NMD factor UPF1 to mRNAs while in, or associated with, the nucleus, bypassing UPF2 recruitment and promoting NMD. SRSF1 promotes NMD when positioned downstream of a PTC, which resembles the mode of action of exon junction complex (EJC) and NMD factors. Moreover, splicing and/or EJC deposition increase the effect of SRSF1 on NMD. Lastly, SRSF1 enhances NMD of PTC-containing endogenous transcripts that result from various events. Our findings reveal an alternative mechanism for UPF1 recruitment, uncovering an additional connection between splicing and NMD. SRSF1’s role in the mRNA’s journey from splicing to decay has broad implications for gene expression regulation and genetic diseases.

Abstract: Summary
UV-induced photoproducts are responsible for the pathological effects of sunlight. Mutations in nucleotide excision repair (NER) cause severe pathologies characterized by sunlight sensitivity, coupled to elevated predisposition to cancer and/or neurological dysfunctions. We have previously shown that in UV-irradiated non-cycling cells, only a particular subset of lesions activates the DNA damage response (DDR), and this requires NER and EXO1 activities. To define the molecular mechanism acting at these lesions, we demonstrate that Y family TLS polymerases are recruited at NER- and EXO1-positive lesion sites in non-S phase cells. The coordinated action of EXO1 and Y family TLS polymerases promotes checkpoint activation, leads to lesion repair, and is crucial to prevent cytotoxic double-strand break (DSB) formation.

Abstract: Summary
Insulin secretion from pancreatic β cells in response to high glucose (HG) critically depends on the inhibition of KATP channel activity in HG. It is generally believed that HG-induced effects are mediated by the increase in intracellular ATP, but here, we showed that, in INS-1 cells, endocytosis of KATP channel plays a major role. Upon HG stimulation, resting membrane potential depolarized by 30.6 mV (from −69.2 to −38.6 mV) and KATP conductance decreased by 91% (from 0.243 to 0.022 nS/pF), whereas intracellular ATP was increased by only 47%. HG stimulation induced internalization of KATP channels, causing a significant decrease in surface channel density, and this decrease was completely abolished by inhibiting endocytosis using dynasore, a dynamin inhibitor, or a PKC inhibitor. These drugs profoundly inhibited HG-induced depolarization. Our results suggest that the control of KATP channel surface density plays a greater role than ATP-dependent gating in regulating β cell excitability.

Abstract: Background and aim of the work
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most frequent primary liver malignancy. Chronic liver injuries as chronic hepatitis C and hepatitis B viruses, aflatoxins consumption and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease are well-established causes of HCC. HCC is associated with a series of molecular changes, as alternation in glypican-3, P53 expression and Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Hepatic cancer progenitor cells could contribute to HCC development. This research aimed to study the effectiveness of human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cell on Wnt4 and P53 genes expression, histopathological grading and hepatic progenitor cells percentage in HCC rat model.
Materials and methods
HCC was induced in the experimental group of outbred Sprague Dawley rats by administration of 50 mg/L N-nitroso-Di-Ethylamine (DEN) in drinking water for 15 weeks. Forty-six animals were used in total, they were initially subdivided into two groups; control (n = 6) and experimental (n = 40), the latter consisting of 4 DEN-unaffected, 6 DEN-lethalities and 30 surviving DEN-animals with elevated AFP. These 30 animals with elevated AFP were then subdivided into a new HCC control group (n = 15) and the stem cell treated group (n = 15). The latter group was injected with CD34+ human hematopoietic stem cell (1 × 106 cells/rat) in the rat’s tail vein. Cyclosporine A (10 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneal, starting 24 h before human stem cell transplantation. After 20 weeks passing since the beginning of the experiment, all rats were sacrificed and liver specimens were subjected to histopathological examination, RT-PCR in order to examine Wnt4 and P53 gene expression and flow cytometry to measure hepatic progenitor OV6 positive cells percentage.
Results
The saline-treated HCC group (with prior 15 week DEN exposure) showed higher levels of wnt4 and p53 gene expression (1.59 and 1.36 fold, respectively) and increased percentage in OV6+ progenitor cells (+4.9% in absolute terms) compared to saline-treated controls (p < 0.01, ANOVA). Compared with the saline HCC-group, transplantation with CD34+ human hematopoietic stem cells produced a further increase in the levels of wnt4 (+19.4%) and p53 gene expression (+53%), a 2-fold increase in the percentage of cancer progenitor cells and increased HCC pathology grading (all p < 0.01). The positive correlation between p53 and HCC grade (Spearman rho +0.73, p < 0.05) and negative correlation between wnt and OV6+% levels (rho −0.65, p < 0.05) in the saline-HCC group were not observed in the CD34+ HCC group.
Conclusions
Human CD34+ cells transplantation has a deteriorating effect on HCC.

Abstract: Summary
Primary afferents transduce environmental stimuli into electrical activity that is transmitted centrally to be decoded into corresponding sensations. However, it remains unknown how afferent populations encode different somatosensory inputs. To address this, we performed two-photon Ca2+ imaging from thousands of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in anesthetized mice while applying mechanical and thermal stimuli to hind paws. We found that approximately half of all neurons are polymodal and that heat and cold are encoded very differently. As temperature increases, more heating-sensitive neurons are activated, and most individual neurons respond more strongly, consistent with graded coding at population and single-neuron levels, respectively. In contrast, most cooling-sensitive neurons respond in an ungraded fashion, inconsistent with graded coding and suggesting combinatorial coding, based on which neurons are co-activated. Although individual neurons may respond to multiple stimuli, our results show that different stimuli activate distinct combinations of diversely tuned neurons, enabling rich population-level coding.

Abstract: Summary
MIG6 is an important tumor suppressor that binds to and negatively regulates epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Here, we report an EGFR-independent function for MIG6 as an integral component of the cell cycle machinery. We found that depletion of MIG6 causes accelerated entry into and delayed exit from mitosis. This is due to premature and prolonged activation of CDK1, a key regulator of mitotic progression at the G2/M and meta- and anaphase transitions. Furthermore, MIG6 is required for inhibition of CDK1 upon DNA damage and subsequent G2/M cell cycle arrest. Mechanistically, we found that MIG6 depletion results in reduced phosphorylation of CDK1 on the inhibitory WEE1-targeted tyrosine-15 residue. MIG6 interacts with WEE1 and promotes its stability by interfering with the recruitment of the βTrCP-SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase and consequent proteasomal degradation of WEE1. Our findings uncover a critical role of MIG6 in cell cycle progression that is likely to contribute to its potent tumor-suppressive properties.

Abstract: Summary
Sustained energy starvation leads to activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which coordinates energy status with numerous cellular processes including metabolism, protein synthesis, and autophagy. Here, we report that AMPK phosphorylates the histone methyltransferase EZH2 at T311 to disrupt the interaction between EZH2 and SUZ12, another core component of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), leading to attenuated PRC2-dependent methylation of histone H3 at Lys27. As such, PRC2 target genes, many of which are known tumor suppressors, were upregulated upon T311-EZH2 phosphorylation, which suppressed tumor cell growth both in cell culture and mouse xenografts. Pathologically, immunohistochemical analyses uncovered a positive correlation between AMPK activity and pT311-EZH2, and higher pT311-EZH2 correlates with better survival in both ovarian and breast cancer patients. Our finding suggests that AMPK agonists might be promising sensitizers for EZH2-targeting cancer therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Developmental genes can have complex cis-regulatory regions with multiple enhancers. Early work revealed remarkable modularity of enhancers, whereby distinct DNA regions drive gene expression in defined spatiotemporal domains. Nevertheless, a few reports have shown that enhancers function in multiple developmental stages, implying that enhancers can be pleiotropic. Here, we have studied the activity of the enhancers of the shavenbaby gene throughout D. melanogaster development. We found that all seven shavenbaby enhancers drive expression in multiple tissues and developmental stages. We explored how enhancer pleiotropy is encoded in two of these enhancers. In one enhancer, the same transcription factor binding sites contribute to embryonic and pupal expression, revealing site pleiotropy, whereas for a second enhancer, these roles are encoded by distinct sites. Enhancer pleiotropy may be a common feature of cis-regulatory regions of developmental genes, and site pleiotropy may constrain enhancer evolution in some cases.

Abstract: Summary
Pharmacologic inhibition of LSD1 promotes blast cell differentiation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with MLL translocations. The assumption has been that differentiation is induced through blockade of LSD1’s histone demethylase activity. However, we observed that rapid, extensive, drug-induced changes in transcription occurred without genome-wide accumulation of the histone modifications targeted for demethylation by LSD1 at sites of LSD1 binding and that a demethylase-defective mutant rescued LSD1 knockdown AML cells as efficiently as wild-type protein. Rather, LSD1 inhibitors disrupt the interaction of LSD1 and RCOR1 with the SNAG-domain transcription repressor GFI1, which is bound to a discrete set of enhancers located close to transcription factor genes that regulate myeloid differentiation. Physical separation of LSD1/RCOR1 from GFI1 is required for drug-induced differentiation. The consequent inactivation of GFI1 leads to increased enhancer histone acetylation within hours, which directly correlates with the upregulation of nearby subordinate genes.

Abstract: Summary
The Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, uses antigenic variation as a strategy to evade the host’s acquired immune response. New variants of surface-localized VlsE are generated efficiently by unidirectional recombination from 15 unexpressed vls cassettes into the vlsE locus. Using algorithms to analyze switching from vlsE sequencing data, we characterize a population of over 45,000 inferred recombination events generated during mouse infection. We present evidence for clustering of these recombination events within the population and along the vlsE gene, a role for the direct repeats flanking the variable region in vlsE, and the importance of sequence homology in determining the location of recombination, despite RecA’s dispensability. Finally, we report that non-templated sequence variation is strongly associated with recombinational switching and occurs predominantly at the 5′ end of conversion tracts. This likely results from an error-prone repair mechanism operational during recombinational switching that elevates the mutation rate > 5,000-fold in switched regions.

Abstract: Summary
The molecular foundations of Hürthle cell carcinoma (HCC) are poorly understood. Here we describe a comprehensive genomic characterization of 56 primary HCC tumors that span the spectrum of tumor behavior. We elucidate the mutational profile and driver mutations and show that these tumors exhibit a wide range of recurrent mutations. Notably, we report a high number of disruptive mutations to both protein-coding and tRNA-encoding regions of the mitochondrial genome. We reveal unique chromosomal landscapes that involve whole-chromosomal duplications of chromosomes 5 and 7 and widespread loss of heterozygosity arising from haploidization and copy-number-neutral uniparental disomy. We also identify fusion genes and disrupted signaling pathways that may drive disease pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Neutrophil granule proteases are thought to function as anti-microbial effectors, cooperatively hydrolyzing microorganisms within phagosomes, or upon deployment into the extracellular space. However, evidence also suggests that neutrophil proteases play an important role in the coordination and escalation of inflammatory reactions, but how this is achieved has been obscure. IL-1 family cytokines are important initiators of inflammation and are typically released via necrosis but require proteolytic processing for activation. Here, we show that proteases liberated from activated neutrophils can positively or negatively regulate the activity of six IL-1 family cytokines (IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-33, IL-36α, IL-36β, and IL-36γ) with exquisite sensitivity. In contrast, extracellular neutrophil proteases displayed very poor bactericidal activity, exhibiting 100-fold greater potency toward cytokine processing than bacterial killing. Thus, in addition to their classical role as phagocytes, neutrophils play an important immunoregulatory role through deployment of their granule proteases into the extracellular space to process multiple IL-1 family cytokines.

Abstract: Summary
Plant roots forage the soil for iron, the concentration of which can be dramatically lower than those needed for growth. Soil iron uptake uses the broad metal spectrum IRT1 transporter that also transports zinc, manganese, cobalt, and cadmium. Sophisticated iron-dependent transcriptional regulatory mechanisms allow plants to tightly control the abundance of IRT1, ensuring optimal absorption of iron. Here, we uncover that IRT1 acts as a transporter and receptor (transceptor), directly sensing excess of its non-iron metal substrates in the cytoplasm, to regulate its own degradation. Direct metal binding to a histidine-rich stretch in IRT1 triggers its phosphorylation by the CIPK23 kinase and facilitates the subsequent recruitment of the IDF1 E3 ligase. CIPK23-driven phosphorylation and IDF1-mediated lysine-63 polyubiquitination are jointly required for efficient endosomal sorting and vacuolar degradation of IRT1. Thus, IRT1 directly senses elevated non-iron metal concentrations and integrates multiple substrate-dependent regulations to optimize iron uptake and protect plants from highly reactive metals.

Abstract: Summary
Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are key players in the tumor microenvironment. Here, we characterize four CAF subsets in breast cancer with distinct properties and levels of activation. Two myofibroblastic subsets (CAF-S1, CAF-S4) accumulate differentially in triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC). CAF-S1 fibroblasts promote an immunosuppressive environment through a multi-step mechanism. By secreting CXCL12, CAF-S1 attracts CD4+CD25+ T lymphocytes and retains them by OX40L, PD-L2, and JAM2. Moreover, CAF-S1 increases T lymphocyte survival and promotes their differentiation into CD25HighFOXP3High, through B7H3, CD73, and DPP4. Finally, in contrast to CAF-S4, CAF-S1 enhances the regulatory T cell capacity to inhibit T effector proliferation. These data are consistent with FOXP3+ T lymphocyte accumulation in CAF-S1-enriched TNBC and show how a CAF subset contributes to immunosuppression.

Abstract: Summary
A single mutagen can generate multiple different types of DNA lesions. How different repair pathways cooperate in complex DNA lesions, however, remains largely unclear. Here we measured, clustered, and modeled the kinetics of recruitment and dissociation of 70 DNA repair proteins to laser-induced DNA damage sites in HeLa cells. The precise timescale of protein recruitment reveals that error-prone translesion polymerases are considerably delayed compared to error-free polymerases. We show that this is ensured by the delayed recruitment of RAD18 to double-strand break sites. The time benefit of error-free polymerases disappears when PARP inhibition significantly delays PCNA recruitment. Moreover, removal of PCNA from complex DNA damage sites correlates with RPA loading during 5′-DNA end resection. Our systematic study of the dynamics of DNA repair proteins in complex DNA lesions reveals the multifaceted coordination between the repair pathways and provides a kinetics-based resource to study genomic instability and anticancer drug impact.

Abstract: Summary
Animal cells have a remarkable capacity to adopt durable and heritable gene expression programs or epigenetic states that define the physical properties and diversity of somatic cell types. The maintenance of epigenetic programs depends on poorly understood pathways that prevent gain or loss of inherited signals. In the germline, epigenetic factors are enriched in liquid-like perinuclear condensates called nuage. Here, we identify the deeply conserved helicase-domain protein, ZNFX-1, as an epigenetic regulator and component of nuage that interacts with Argonaute systems to balance epigenetic inheritance. Our findings suggest that ZNFX-1 promotes the 3′ recruitment of machinery that propagates the small RNA epigenetic signal and thus counteracts a tendency for Argonaute targeting to shift 5′ along the mRNA. These functional insights support the idea that recently identified subdomains of nuage, including ZNFX-1 granules or “Z-granules,” may define spatial and temporal zones of molecular activity during epigenetic regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Human high-affinity antibodies to pathogens often recognize unrelated ligands. The molecular origin and the role of this polyreactivity are largely unknown. Here, we report that HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) are frequently polyreactive, cross-reacting with non-HIV-1 molecules, including self-antigens. Mutating bNAb genes to increase HIV-1 binding and neutralization also results in de novo polyreactivity. Unliganded paratopes of polyreactive bNAbs with improved HIV-1 neutralization exhibit a conformational flexibility, which contributes to enhanced affinity of bNAbs to various HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins and non-HIV antigens. Binding adaptation of polyreactive bNAbs to the divergent ligands mainly involves hydrophophic interactions. Plasticity of bNAbs’ paratopes may, therefore, facilitate accommodating divergent viral variants, but it simultaneously triggers promiscuous binding to non-HIV-1 antigens. Thus, a certain level of polyreactivity can be a mark of adaptable antibodies displaying optimal pathogens’ recognition.

Abstract: Summary
Huntington’s disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disease, where dysfunction and loss of striatal and cortical neurons are central to the pathogenesis of the disease. Here, we integrated quantitative studies to investigate the underlying mechanisms behind HD pathology in a systems-wide manner. To this end, we used state-of-the-art mass spectrometry to establish a spatial brain proteome from late-stage R6/2 mice and compared this with wild-type littermates. We observed altered expression of proteins in pathways related to energy metabolism, synapse function, and neurotransmitter homeostasis. To support these findings, metabolic 13C labeling studies confirmed a compromised astrocytic metabolism and regulation of glutamate-GABA-glutamine cycling, resulting in impaired release of glutamine and GABA synthesis. In recent years, increasing attention has been focused on the role of astrocytes in HD, and our data support that therapeutic strategies to improve astrocytic glutamine homeostasis may help ameliorate symptoms in HD.

Abstract: Summary
Reactive astrocytes influence post-injury recovery, repair, and pathogenesis of the mammalian CNS. Much of the regulation of astrocyte reactivity, however, remains to be understood. Using genetic loss and gain-of-function analyses in vivo, we show that the conserved MAP3K13 (also known as leucine zipper-bearing kinase [LZK]) promotes astrocyte reactivity and glial scar formation after CNS injury. Inducible LZK gene deletion in astrocytes of adult mice reduced astrogliosis and impaired glial scar formation, resulting in increased lesion size after spinal cord injury. Conversely, LZK overexpression in astrocytes enhanced astrogliosis and reduced lesion size. Remarkably, in the absence of injury, LZK overexpression alone induced widespread astrogliosis in the CNS and upregulated astrogliosis activators pSTAT3 and SOX9. The identification of LZK as a critical cell-intrinsic regulator of astrocyte reactivity expands our understanding of the multicellular response to CNS injury and disease, with broad translational implications for neural repair.

Abstract: Summary
Huntington’s disease (HD), a devastating neurodegenerative disorder, strongly affects the corticostriatal network, but the contribution of pre- and postsynaptic neurons in the first phases of disease is unclear due to difficulties performing early subcellular investigations in vivo. Here, we have developed an on-a-chip approach to reconstitute an HD corticostriatal network in vitro, using microfluidic devices compatible with subcellular resolution. We observed major defects in the different compartments of the corticostriatal circuit, from presynaptic dynamics to synaptic structure and transmission and to postsynaptic traffic and signaling, that correlate with altered global synchrony of the network. Importantly, the genetic status of the presynaptic compartment was necessary and sufficient to alter or restore the circuit. This highlights an important weight for the presynaptic compartment in HD that has to be considered for future therapies. This disease-on-a-chip microfluidic platform is thus a physiologically relevant in vitro system for investigating pathogenic mechanisms and for identifying drugs.

Abstract: Summary
Despite well-known privileged perception of dark over light stimuli, it is unknown to what extent this dark dominance is maintained when visual transients occur in rapid succession, for example, during perception of moving stimuli. Here, we address this question using dark and light transients presented at different flicker frequencies. Although both human participants and tree shrews exhibited dark dominance for temporally modulated transients, these occurred at different flicker frequencies, namely, at 11 Hz in humans and 40 Hz and higher in tree shrews. Tree shrew V1 neuronal activity confirmed that differences between light and dark flicker were maximal at 40 Hz, corresponding closely to behavioral findings. These findings suggest large differences in flicker perception between humans and tree shrews, which may be related to the lifestyle of these species. A specialization for detecting dark transients at high temporal frequencies may thus be adaptive for tree shrews, which are particularly fast-moving small mammals.

Abstract: Summary
Targeting of general coactivators is an emerging strategy to interfere with oncogenic transcription factors (TFs). However, coactivator perturbations often lead to pleiotropic effects by influencing numerous TFs. Here we identify TAF12, a subunit of TFIID and SAGA coactivator complexes, as a selective requirement for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) progression. We trace this dependency to a direct interaction between the TAF12/TAF4 histone-fold heterodimer and the transactivation domain of MYB, a TF with established roles in leukemogenesis. Ectopic expression of the TAF4 histone-fold fragment can efficiently squelch TAF12 in cells, suppress MYB, and regress AML in mice. Our study reveals a strategy for potent MYB inhibition in AML and highlights how an oncogenic TF can be selectively neutralized by targeting a general coactivator complex.

Abstract: Summary
Transcriptional pausing by RNA polymerases (RNAPs) is a key mechanism to regulate gene expression in all kingdoms of life and is a prerequisite for transcription termination. The essential bacterial transcription factor NusA stimulates both pausing and termination of transcription, thus playing a central role. Here, we report single-particle electron cryo-microscopy reconstructions of NusA bound to paused E. coli RNAP elongation complexes with and without a pause-enhancing hairpin in the RNA exit channel. The structures reveal four interactions between NusA and RNAP that suggest how NusA stimulates RNA folding, pausing, and termination. An asymmetric translocation intermediate of RNA and DNA converts the active site of the enzyme into an inactive state, providing a structural explanation for the inhibition of catalysis. Comparing RNAP at different stages of pausing provides insights on the dynamic nature of the process and the role of NusA as a regulatory factor.

Abstract: Summary
Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) requires tumors to engage metabolic mechanisms that allow sustained testosterone and/or dihydrotestosterone to stimulate progression. 17β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 4 (17βHSD4), encoded by HSD17B4, is thought to inactivate testosterone and dihydrotestosterone by converting them to their respective inert 17-keto steroids. Counterintuitively, HSD17B4 expression increases in CRPC and predicts poor prognosis. Here, we show that, of five alternative splice forms, only isoform 2 encodes an enzyme capable of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone inactivation. In contrast with other transcripts, functional expression of isoform 2 is specifically suppressed in development of CRPC in patients. Genetically silencing isoform 2 shifts the metabolic balance toward 17β-OH androgens (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone), stimulating androgen receptor (AR) and CRPC development. Our studies specifically implicate HSD17B4 isoform 2 loss in lethal prostate cancer.

Abstract: In order to investigate the effects of Rutin against restraint stress, 50 adult male mice were divided into five groups: control, restraint stress (RS), and RS with 2 doses of Rutin treatments. Mice were restrained in a conical tube for 4 h daily and Rutin was injected intraperitoneally for 15 consecutive days. Restraint stress significantly decreases body weights, testis and epididymis weights, thymus weights, visceral fats, serum concentrations of testosterone, sperm counts, sperm motility and sperm viability, while it increases serum epinephrine levels, adrenal gland weights and abnormal sperms. In addition, restraint stress severely damages the testicular histoarchitecture and spermatogenesis. Stressed groups also showed broken seminiferous tubules, few spermatozoa in lumen, less population of Leydig cells between the interstitial spaces, spermiation arrest in stage I–III and degenerated population of round spermatids in the lumen; as well as missing cells in stages IV–VI. Furthermore, lumen sizes increased in stages VII, VIII, IX and X. Residual bodies increased in stages IV–VI, VII–VIII and vacuoles found in stages XI–XII after restraint stress. PARP1 signaling is involved in apoptosis. In this study, expressional levels of cleaved PARP1 and cleaved Caspase-3 are significantly increased in testes after restraint stress. We demonstrate that Rutin significantly ameliorates the side effects induced by restraint stress.

Abstract: Summary
Phenylalanine-glycine-rich nucleoporins (FG-Nups) are intrinsically disordered proteins, constituting the selective barrier of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Previous studies showed that nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) were found to interact with FG-Nups by forming an “archetypal-fuzzy” complex through the rapid formation and breakage of interactions with many individual FG motifs. Here, we use single-molecule studies combined with atomistic simulations to show that, in sharp contrast, FG-Nup214 undergoes a coupled reconfiguration-binding mechanism when interacting with the export receptor CRM1. Association and dissociation rate constants are more than an order of magnitude lower than in the archetypal-fuzzy complex between FG-Nup153 and NTRs. Unexpectedly, this behavior appears not to be encoded selectively into CRM1 but rather into the FG-Nup214 sequence. The same distinct binding mechanisms are unperturbed in O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine-modified FG-Nups. Our results have implications for differential roles of distinctly spatially distributed FG-Nup⋅NTR interactions in the cell.

Abstract: Summary
Excitation and inhibition are highly specific in the cortex, with distinct synaptic connections made onto subtypes of projection neurons. The functional consequences of this selective connectivity depend on both synaptic strength and the intrinsic properties of targeted neurons but remain poorly understood. Here, we examine responses to callosal inputs at cortico-cortical (CC) and cortico-thalamic (CT) neurons in layer 5 of mouse prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PFC). We find callosally evoked excitation and feedforward inhibition are much stronger at CT neurons compared to neighboring CC neurons. Elevated inhibition at CT neurons reflects biased synaptic inputs from parvalbumin and somatostatin positive interneurons. The intrinsic properties of postsynaptic targets equalize excitatory and inhibitory response amplitudes but selectively accelerate decays at CT neurons. Feedforward inhibition further reduces response amplitude and balances action potential firing across these projection neurons. Our findings highlight the synaptic and cellular mechanisms regulating callosal recruitment of layer 5 microcircuits in PFC.

Abstract: Postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP) is a common systemic skeletal disease characterized by reduced bone mass and microarchitecture deterioration. Although differentially expressed SOX5 has been found in bone marrow from ovariectomized mice, its role in osteogenic differentiation in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) from bone marrow in PMOP remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the biological function of SOX5 and explore its molecular mechanism in hMSCs from patients with PMOP. Our findings showed that the mRNA and protein expression levels of SOX5 were upregulated in hMSCs isolated from bone marrow samples of PMOP patients. We also found that SOX5 overexpression decreased the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and the gene expression of osteoblast markers including Collagen I, Runx2 and Osterix, which were increased by SOX5 knockdown using RNA interference. Furthermore, TNF-α notably upregulated the SOX5 mRNA expression level, and SOX5 knockdown reversed the effect of TNF-α on osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs. In addition, SOX5 overexpression increased Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) gene expression, which was decreased by SOX5 silencing. KLF4 knockdown abrogated the suppressive effect of SOX5 overexpression on osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs. Taken together, our results indicated that TNF-α-induced SOX5 upregulation inhibited osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs through KLF4 signal pathway, suggesting that SOX5 might be a novel therapeutic target for PMOP treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Toxin-antitoxin systems are widely distributed genetic modules that regulate growth and persistence in bacteria. Many systems, including E. coli MazEF, include toxins that are endoribonucleases, but the full set of targets for these toxins remains poorly defined. Previous studies on a limited set of transcripts suggested that MazF creates a pool of leaderless mRNAs that are preferentially translated by specialized ribosomes created through MazF cleavage of mature 16S rRNA. Here, using paired-end RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and ribosome profiling, we provide a comprehensive, global analysis of MazF cleavage specificity and its targets. We find that MazF cleaves most transcripts at multiple sites within their coding regions, with very few full-length, leaderless mRNAs created. Additionally, our results demonstrate that MazF does not create a large pool of specialized ribosomes but instead rapidly disrupts ribosome biogenesis by targeting both ribosomal protein transcripts and rRNA precursors, helping to inhibit cell growth.

Abstract: Summary
Endometriosis is characterized by ectopic endometrial-like epithelium and stroma, of which molecular characteristics remain to be fully elucidated. We sequenced 107 ovarian endometriotic and 82 normal uterine endometrial epithelium samples isolated by laser microdissection. In both endometriotic and normal epithelium samples, numerous somatic mutations were identified within genes frequently mutated in endometriosis-associated ovarian cancers. KRAS is frequently mutated in endometriotic epithelium, with a higher mutant allele frequency (MAF) accompanied by arm-level allelic imbalances. Analyses of MAF, combined with multiregional sequencing, illuminated spatiotemporal evolution of the endometriosis and uterine endometrium genomes. We sequenced 109 single endometrial glands and found that each gland carried distinct cancer-associated mutations, demonstrating the heterogeneity of the genomic architecture of endometrial epithelium. Remarkable increases in MAF of mutations in cancer-associated genes in endometriotic epithelium suggest retrograde flow of endometrial cells already harboring cancer-associated mutations, with selective advantages at ectopic sites, leading to the development of endometriosis.

Abstract: Summary
Helminth infection is known for generating large amounts of poly-specific IgE. Here we demonstrate that innate-like B1 cells are responsible for this IgE production during infection with the nematode parasites Nippostrongylus brasiliensis and Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri. In vitro analysis of B1 cell immunoglobulin class switch recombination to IgE demonstrated a requirement for anti-CD40 and IL-4 that was further enhanced when IL-5 was added or when the B1 source was helminth infected mice. An IL-25-induced upregulation of IgE in B1 cells was also demonstrated. In T cell-reconstituted RAG1−/− mice, N. brasiliensis clearance was enhanced with the addition of B2 cells in an IgE-dependent manner. This enhanced clearance was impeded by reconstitution with IgE sufficient B1 cells. Mucosal mast cells mediated the B2 cell enhancement of clearance in the absence of B1 cells. The data support B1 cell IgE secretion as a regulatory response exploited by the helminth.

Abstract: Summary
Upon glucose restriction, eukaryotic cells upregulate oxidative metabolism to maintain homeostasis. Using genetic screens, we find that the mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT2) is required for robust mitochondrial oxygen consumption and low glucose proliferation. SHMT2 catalyzes the first step in mitochondrial one-carbon metabolism, which, particularly in proliferating cells, produces tetrahydrofolate (THF)-conjugated one-carbon units used in cytoplasmic reactions despite the presence of a parallel cytoplasmic pathway. Impairing cytoplasmic one-carbon metabolism or blocking efflux of one-carbon units from mitochondria does not phenocopy SHMT2 loss, indicating that a mitochondrial THF cofactor is responsible for the observed phenotype. The enzyme MTFMT utilizes one such cofactor, 10-formyl THF, producing formylmethionyl-tRNAs, specialized initiator tRNAs necessary for proper translation of mitochondrially encoded proteins. Accordingly, SHMT2 null cells specifically fail to maintain formylmethionyl-tRNA pools and mitochondrially encoded proteins, phenotypes similar to those observed in MTFMT-deficient patients. These findings provide a rationale for maintaining a compartmentalized one-carbon pathway in mitochondria.

Abstract: Summary
Actin assembly is important for cell motility. The ability of actin subunits to join or leave filaments via the barbed end is critical to actin dynamics. Capping protein (CP) binds to barbed ends to prevent subunit gain and loss and is regulated by proteins that include V-1 and CARMIL. V-1 inhibits CP by sterically blocking one binding site for actin. CARMILs bind at a distal site and decrease the affinity of CP for actin, suggested to be caused by conformational changes. We used hydrogen-deuterium exchange with mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to probe changes in structural dynamics induced by V-1 and CARMIL binding to CP. V-1 and CARMIL induce changes in both proteins’ binding sites on the surface of CP, along with a set of internal residues. Both also affect the conformation of CP’s ββ subunit “tentacle,” a second distal actin-binding site. Concerted regulation of actin assembly by CP occurs through allosteric couplings between CP modulator and actin binding sites.

Abstract: Summary
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a therapeutic target for metabolic diseases; thus, understanding its metabolic circuitry is clinically important. Many studies of BAT compare rodents mildly cold to those severely cold. Here, we compared BAT remodeling between thermoneutral and mild-cold-adapted mice, conditions more relevant to humans. Although BAT is renowned for catabolic β-oxidative capacity, we find paradoxically that the anabolic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) genes encoding ACLY, ACSS2, ACC, and FASN were among the most upregulated by mild cold and that, in humans, DNL correlates with Ucp1 expression. The regulation and function of adipocyte DNL and its association with thermogenesis are not understood. We provide evidence suggesting that AKT2 drives DNL in adipocytes by stimulating ChREBPβ transcriptional activity and that cold induces the AKT2-ChREBP pathway in BAT to optimize fuel storage and thermogenesis. These data provide insight into adipocyte DNL regulation and function and illustrate the metabolic flexibility of thermogenesis.

Abstract: Plant defence responses to various biotic stresses via systemic acquired resistance (SAR) are induced by avirulent pathogens and chemical compounds, including certain plant hormones in volatile form, such as methyl salicylate and methyl jasmonate. SAR refers to the observation that, when a local part of a plant is exposed to elicitors, the entire plant exhibits a resistance response. In the natural environment, plants are continuously exposed to avirulent pathogens that induce SAR and volatile emissions affecting neighbouring plants as well as the plant itself. However, the underlying mechanism has not been intensively studied. In this study, we evaluated whether plants “memorise” the previous activation of plant immunity when exposed repeatedly to plant defensive volatiles such as methyl salicylate and methyl jasmonate. We hypothesised that stronger SAR responses would occur in plants treated with repeated applications of the volatile plant defence compound MeSA than in those exposed to a single or no treatment. Nicotiana benthamiana seedlings subjected to repeated applications of MeSA exhibited greater protection against Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci and Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum than the control. The increase in SAR capacity in response to repeated MeSA treatment was confirmed by analysing the defence priming of the expression of N. benthamiana Pathogenesis-Related 1a (NbPR1a) and NbPR2 by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR compared with the control. We propose the concept of plant memory of plant defence volatiles and suggest that SAR is strengthened by the repeated perception of volatile compounds in plants.

Abstract: Summary
Classical mechanisms through which brain-derived molecules influence behavior include neuronal synaptic communication and neuroendocrine signaling. Here we provide evidence for an alternative neural communication mechanism that is relevant for food intake control involving cerebroventricular volume transmission of the neuropeptide melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH). Results reveal that the cerebral ventricles receive input from approximately one-third of MCH-producing neurons. Moreover, MCH cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels increase prior to nocturnal feeding and following chemogenetic activation of MCH-producing neurons. Utilizing a dual viral vector approach, additional results reveal that selective activation of putative CSF-projecting MCH neurons increases food intake. In contrast, food intake was reduced following immunosequestration of MCH endogenously present in CSF, indicating that neuropeptide transmission through the cerebral ventricles is a physiologically relevant signaling pathway for energy balance control. Collectively these results suggest that neural-CSF volume transmission signaling may be a common neurobiological mechanism for the control of fundamental behaviors.

Abstract: Summary
During somatic reprogramming, Yamanaka’s pioneer factors regulate a complex sequence of molecular events leading to the activation of a network of pluripotency factors, ultimately resulting in the acquisition and maintenance of a pluripotent state. Here, we show that, contrary to the pluripotency factors studied so far, overexpression of Mybl2 inhibits somatic reprogramming. Our results demonstrate that Mybl2 levels are crucial to the dynamics of the reprogramming process. Mybl2 overexpression changes chromatin conformation, affecting the accessibility of pioneer factors to the chromatin and promoting accessibility for early immediate response genes known to be reprogramming blockers. These changes in the chromatin landscape ultimately lead to a deregulation of key genes that are important for the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition. This work defines Mybl2 level as a gatekeeper for the initiation of reprogramming, providing further insights into the tight regulation and required coordination of molecular events that are necessary for changes in cell fate identity during the reprogramming process.

Abstract: Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and outgrowth endothelial cells (OECs) play a pivotal role in vascular regeneration in ischemic tissues; however, their therapeutic application in clinical settings is limited due to the low quality and quantity of patient-derived circulating EPCs. To solve this problem, we evaluated whether three priming small molecules (tauroursodeoxycholic acid, fucoidan, and oleuropein) could enhance the angiogenic potential of EPCs. Such enhancement would promote the cellular bioactivities and help to develop functionally improved EPC therapeutics for ischemic diseases by accelerating the priming effect of the defined physiological molecules. We found that preconditioning of each of the three small molecules significantly induced the differentiation potential of CD34+ stem cells into EPC lineage cells. Notably, long-term priming of OECs with the three chemical cocktail (OEC-3C) increased the proliferation potential of EPCs via ERK activation. The migration, invasion, and tube-forming capacities were also significantly enhanced in OEC-3Cs compared with unprimed OECs. Further, the cell survival ratio was dramatically increased in OEC-3Cs against H2O2-induced oxidative stress via the augmented expression of Bcl-2, a prosurvival protein. In conclusion, we identified three small molecules for enhancing the bioactivities of ex vivo-expanded OECs for vascular repair. Long-term 3C priming might be a promising methodology for EPC-based therapy against ischemic diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Learning processes contributing to appropriate selection and flexible switching of behaviors are mediated through the dorsal striatum, a key structure of the basal ganglia circuit. The major inputs to striatal subdivisions are provided from the intralaminar thalamic nuclei, including the central lateral nucleus (CL) and parafascicular nucleus (PF). Thalamostriatal neurons in the PF modulate the acquisition and performance of stimulus-response learning. Here, we address the roles of the CL thalamostriatal neurons in learning processes by using a selective neural pathway targeting technique. We show that the CL neurons are essential for the performance of stimulus-response learning and for behavioral flexibility, including reversal and attentional set-shifting of learned responses. In addition, chemogenetic suppression of neural activity supports the requirements of these neurons for behavioral flexibility. Our results suggest that the main contribution of the CL thalamostriatal neurons is functional control of the basal ganglia circuit linked to the prefrontal cortex.

Abstract: Summary
Succinate accumulates during ischemia, and its oxidation at reperfusion drives injury. The mechanism of ischemic succinate accumulation is controversial and is proposed to involve reversal of mitochondrial complex II. Herein, using stable-isotope-resolved metabolomics, we demonstrate that complex II reversal is possible in hypoxic mitochondria but is not the primary succinate source in hypoxic cardiomyocytes or ischemic hearts. Rather, in these intact systems succinate primarily originates from canonical Krebs cycle activity, partly supported by aminotransferase anaplerosis and glycolysis from glycogen. Augmentation of canonical Krebs cycle activity with dimethyl-α-ketoglutarate both increases ischemic succinate accumulation and drives substrate-level phosphorylation by succinyl-CoA synthetase, improving ischemic energetics. Although two-thirds of ischemic succinate accumulation is extracellular, the remaining one-third is metabolized during early reperfusion, wherein acute complex II inhibition is protective. These results highlight a bifunctional role for succinate: its complex-II-independent accumulation being beneficial in ischemia and its complex-II-dependent oxidation being detrimental at reperfusion.

Abstract: Summary
Many favorable metabolic effects have been attributed to thermogenic activity of brown adipose tissue (BAT). Yet, time of day has rarely been considered in this field of research. Here, we show that a diurnal rhythm in BAT activity regulates plasma lipid metabolism. We observed a high-amplitude rhythm in fatty acid uptake by BAT that synchronized with the light/dark cycle. Highest uptake was found at the onset of the active period, which coincided with high lipoprotein lipase expression and low angiopoietin-like 4 expression by BAT. Diurnal rhythmicity in BAT activity determined the rate at which lipids were cleared from the circulation, thereby imposing the daily rhythm in plasma lipid concentrations. In mice as well as humans, postprandial lipid excursions were nearly absent at waking. We anticipate that diurnal BAT activity is an important factor to consider when studying the therapeutic potential of promoting BAT activity.

Abstract: Neural crest stem cells that located in the postnatal hair follicle (HF-NCSC) are considered a promising tool for treatment of nervous system diseases and injuries. It is well known that HF-NCSC can be used in the spinal cord and sciatic nerve reparation but their ability to restore brain structures is poorly studied. In this article we are investigating the interaction between HF-NCSC and a nerve tissue (embryonic and adult). We have found out that HF-NCSC isolated from adult mice grow and differentiate in accordance with the mouse embryo developmental stage when co-cultured with the embryonic nerve tissue. The HF-NCSC migration is slower in the late embryonic tissue co-culture system compared to the early one. This phenomenon is related to the motor function of the cells but not to their proliferation level. We have demonstrated that the embryonic nerve tissue maintains HF-NCSC an undifferentiated status, while an adult brain tissue inhibits the cell proliferation and activates the differentiation processes. Besides, HF-NCSC pre-differentiated into the neuronal direction shows a higher survival and migration rate after the transplantation into the adult brain tissue compared to the undifferentiated HF-NCSC. Thus, we have investigated the postnatal HF-NCSC response to the nerve tissue microenvironment to analyze their possible application to the brain repair processes.

Abstract: Summary
The mammalian Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1)-signaling system plays a critical role in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis by sensing and integrating multiple extracellular and intracellular cues. Therefore, uncovering the effectors of mTORC1 signaling is pivotal to understanding its pathophysiological effects. Here we report that the transcription factor forkhead/winged helix family k1 (Foxk1) is a mediator of mTORC1-regulated gene expression. Surprisingly, Foxk1 phosphorylation is increased upon mTORC1 suppression, which elicits a 14-3-3 interaction, a reduction of DNA binding, and nuclear exclusion. Mechanistically, this occurs by mTORC1-dependent suppression of nuclear signaling by the Foxk1 kinase, Gsk3. This pathway then regulates the expression of multiple genes associated with glycolysis and downstream anabolic pathways directly modulated by Foxk1 and/or by Foxk1-regulated expression of Hif-1α. Thus, Foxk1 mediates mTORC1-driven metabolic rewiring, and it is likely to be critical for metabolic diseases where improper mTORC1 signaling plays an important role.

Abstract: Summary
The early Drosophila embryo is a large syncytial cell that compartmentalizes mitotic spindles with furrows. Before furrow ingression, an Arp2/3 actin cap forms above each nucleus and is encircled by actomyosin. We investigated how these networks transform a flat cortex into a honeycomb-like compartmental array. The growing caps circularize and ingress upon meeting their actomyosin borders, which become the furrow base. Genetic perturbations indicate that the caps physically displace their borders and, reciprocally, that the borders resist and circularize their caps. These interactions create an actomyosin cortex arrayed with circular caps. The Rac-GEF Sponge, Rac-GTP, Arp3, and actin coat the caps as a growing material that can drive cortical bending for initial furrow ingression. Additionally, laser ablations indicate that actomyosin contraction squeezes the cytoplasm, producing counterforces that swell the caps. Thus, Arp2/3 caps form clearances of the actomyosin cortex and control buckling and swelling of these clearances for metaphase compartmentalization.

Abstract: Summary
In the vertebrate retina, cone photoreceptors play crucial roles in photopic vision by transmitting light-evoked signals to ON- and/or OFF-bipolar cells. However, the mechanisms underlying selective synapse formation in the cone photoreceptor pathway remain poorly understood. Here, we found that Lrit1, a leucine-rich transmembrane protein, localizes to the photoreceptor synaptic terminal and regulates the synaptic connection between cone photoreceptors and cone ON-bipolar cells. Lrit1-deficient retinas exhibit an aberrant morphology of cone photoreceptor pedicles, as well as an impairment of signal transmission from cone photoreceptors to cone ON-bipolar cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Lrit1 interacts with Frmpd2, a photoreceptor scaffold protein, and with mGluR6, an ON-bipolar cell-specific glutamate receptor. Additionally, Lrit1-null mice showed visual acuity impairments in their optokinetic responses. These results suggest that the Frmpd2-Lrit1-mGluR6 axis regulates selective synapse formation in cone photoreceptors and is essential for normal visual function.

Abstract: Summary
Trait-associated loci often map to genomic regions encoding long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), but the role of these lncRNAs in disease etiology is largely unexplored. We show that a pair of sense/antisense lncRNA (6p22lncRNAs) encoded by CASC15 and NBAT1 located at the neuroblastoma (NB) risk-associated 6p22.3 locus are tumor suppressors and show reduced expression in high-risk NBs. Loss of functional synergy between 6p22lncRNAs results in an undifferentiated state that is maintained by a gene-regulatory network, including SOX9 located on 17q, a region frequently gained in NB. 6p22lncRNAs regulate SOX9 expression by controlling CHD7 stability via modulating the cellular localization of USP36, encoded by another 17q gene. This regulatory nexus between 6p22.3 and 17q regions may lead to potential NB treatment strategies.

Abstract: Since ancient times, some herbal medicines have been extensively used for burn and wound treatments, showing preference to the common synthetic medications by virtue of having less side effects and faster healing rate. In this study, hybrid nanofibrous scaffolds of poly-l-lactic-acid (PLLA) and gelatin incorporated L. inermis were fabricated via electrospinning technique. Morphology and characteristics of the scaffolds were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), respectively. The release profile of the L. inermis from the nanofibers was also assessed in vitro. Moreover, the structural stability of the released L. inermis from the nanofibers was evaluated using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The nanofibers showed a gradual release of L. inermis up to two days while the intact structure was preserved. Furthermore, antibacterial assay demonstrated that L. inermis-loaded nanofibrous scaffolds could effectively kill E. coli and S. aureus within 2 h. Finally, biocompatibility of the nanofibers was proven on 3T3 fibroblasts.

Abstract: Summary
The Iroquois homeodomain transcription factor gene IRX3 is expressed in the developing nervous system, limb buds, and heart, and transcript levels specify obesity risk in humans. We now report a functional role for IRX3 in human acute leukemia. Although transcript levels are very low in normal human bone marrow cells, high IRX3 expression is found in ∼30% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), ∼50% with T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and ∼20% with B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia, frequently in association with high-level HOXA gene expression. Expression of IRX3 alone was sufficient to immortalize hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in myeloid culture and induce lymphoid leukemias in vivo. IRX3 knockdown induced terminal differentiation of AML cells. Combined IRX3 and Hoxa9 expression in murine HSPCs impeded normal T-progenitor differentiation in lymphoid culture and substantially enhanced the morphologic and phenotypic differentiation block of AML in myeloid leukemia transplantation experiments through suppression of a terminal myelomonocytic program. Likewise, in cases of primary human AML, high IRX3 expression is strongly associated with reduced myelomonocytic differentiation. Thus, tissue-inappropriate derepression of IRX3 contributes significantly to the block in differentiation, which is the pathognomonic feature of human acute leukemias.

Abstract: Summary
Exercise stimulates the release of molecules into the circulation, supporting the concept that inter-tissue signaling proteins are important mediators of adaptations to exercise. Recognizing that many circulating proteins are packaged in extracellular vesicles (EVs), we employed quantitative proteomic techniques to characterize the exercise-induced secretion of EV-contained proteins. Following a 1-hr bout of cycling exercise in healthy humans, we observed an increase in the circulation of over 300 proteins, with a notable enrichment of several classes of proteins that compose exosomes and small vesicles. Pulse-chase and intravital imaging experiments suggested EVs liberated by exercise have a propensity to localize in the liver and can transfer their protein cargo. Moreover, by employing arteriovenous balance studies across the contracting human limb, we identified several novel candidate myokines, released into circulation independently of classical secretion. These data identify a new paradigm by which tissue crosstalk during exercise can exert systemic biological effects.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we find that human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocyte (CM)-fated progenitors (CFPs) that express a tetraspanin family glycoprotein, CD82, almost exclusively differentiate into CMs both in vitro and in vivo. CD82 is transiently expressed in late-stage mesoderm cells during hiPSC differentiation. Purified CD82+ cells gave rise to CMs under nonspecific in vitro culture conditions with serum, as well as in vivo after transplantation to the subrenal space or injured hearts in mice, indicating that CD82 successfully marks CFPs. CD82 overexpression in mesoderm cells as well as in undifferentiated hiPSCs increased the secretion of exosomes containing β-catenin and reduced nuclear β-catenin protein, suggesting that CD82 is involved in fated restriction to CMs through Wnt signaling inhibition. This study may contribute to the understanding of CM differentiation mechanisms and to cardiac regeneration strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Large-bodied organisms have more cells that can potentially turn cancerous than small-bodied organisms, imposing an increased risk of developing cancer. This expectation predicts a positive correlation between body size and cancer risk; however, there is no correlation between body size and cancer risk across species (“Peto’s paradox”). Here, we show that elephants and their extinct relatives (proboscideans) may have resolved Peto’s paradox in part through refunctionalizing a leukemia inhibitory factor pseudogene (LIF6) with pro-apoptotic functions. LIF6 is transcriptionally upregulated by TP53 in response to DNA damage and translocates to the mitochondria where it induces apoptosis. Phylogenetic analyses of living and extinct proboscidean LIF6 genes indicates that its TP53 response element evolved coincident with the evolution of large body sizes in the proboscidean stem lineage. These results suggest that refunctionalizing of a pro-apoptotic LIF pseudogene may have been permissive (although not sufficient) for the evolution of large body sizes in proboscideans.

Abstract: Summary
The aging liver is affected by several disorders, including steatosis, that can lead to a decline of liver functions. Here, we present evidence that the cdk4-C/EBPα-p300 axis is a critical regulator of age-associated disorders, including steatosis. We found that patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have increased levels of cdk4 and that cdk4-resistant C/EBPα-S193A mice do not develop hepatic steatosis with advancing age. Underlying mechanisms include a block in C/EBPα activation and subsequent failure in activation of enzymes involved in the development of NAFLD. Inhibition of cdk4 in aged wild-type (WT) mice by a specific cdk4 inhibitor, PD-0332991, reduces C/EBPα-p300 complexes and eliminates hepatic steatosis. Moreover, the inhibition of cdk4 in aged mice reverses many age-related disorders. Mechanisms of correction include elimination of cellular senescence and alterations in the chromatin structure of hepatocytes. Thus, the inhibition of cdk4 might be considered as a therapeutic approach to correct age-associated liver disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Taming cell-to-cell variability in gene expression is critical for precise pattern formation during embryonic development. To investigate the source and buffering mechanism of expression variability, we studied a biological clock, the vertebrate segmentation clock, controlling the precise spatiotemporal patterning of the vertebral column. By counting single transcripts of segmentation clock genes in zebrafish, we show that clock genes have low RNA amplitudes and expression variability is primarily driven by gene extrinsic sources, which is suppressed by Notch signaling. We further show that expression noise surprisingly increases from the posterior progenitor zone to the anterior segmentation and differentiation zone. Our computational model reproduces the spatial noise profile by incorporating spatially increasing time delays in gene expression. Our results, suggesting that expression variability is controlled by the balance of time delays and cell signaling in a vertebrate tissue, will shed light on the accuracy of natural clocks in multi-cellular systems and inspire engineering of robust synthetic oscillators.

Abstract: Summary
Bone marrow formation requires an orchestrated interplay between osteogenesis, angiogenesis, and hematopoiesis that is thought to be mediated by endothelial cells. The nature of the endothelial cells and the molecular mechanisms underlying these events remain unclear in humans. Here, we identify a subset of endoglin-expressing endothelial cells enriched in human bone marrow during fetal ontogeny and upon regeneration after chemotherapeutic injury. Comprehensive transcriptional characterization by massive parallel RNA sequencing of these cells reveals a phenotypic and molecular similarity to murine type H endothelium and activation of angiocrine factors implicated in hematopoiesis, osteogenesis, and angiogenesis. Interleukin-33 (IL-33) was significantly overexpressed in these endothelial cells and promoted the expansion of distinct subsets of hematopoietic precursor cells, endothelial cells, as well as osteogenic differentiation. The identification and molecular characterization of these human regeneration-associated endothelial cells is thus anticipated to instruct the discovery of angiocrine factors driving bone marrow formation and recovery after injury.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian mtDNA encodes only 13 proteins, all essential components of respiratory complexes, synthesized by mitochondrial ribosomes. Mitoribosomes contain greatly truncated RNAs transcribed from mtDNA, including a structural tRNA in place of 5S RNA as a scaffold for binding 82 nucleus-encoded proteins, mitoribosomal proteins (MRPs). Cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies have determined the structure of the mitoribosome, but its mechanism of assembly is unknown. Our SILAC pulse-labeling experiments determine the rates of mitochondrial import of MRPs and their assembly into intact mitoribosomes, providing a basis for distinguishing MRPs that bind at early and late stages in mitoribosome assembly to generate a working model for mitoribosome assembly. Mitoribosome assembly is a slow process initiated at the mtDNA nucleoid driven by excess synthesis of individual MRPs. MRPs that are tightly associated in the structure frequently join the complex in a coordinated manner. Clinically significant MRP mutations reported to date affect proteins that bind early on during assembly.

Abstract: Summary
C-low-threshold mechanoreceptors (C-LTMRs) are sensory neurons that, beyond conveying pleasant touch, modulate nociceptive transmission within the spinal cord. However, pain alleviation by C-LTMRs remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the C-LTMR-derived TAFA4 chemokine induces a reinforcement of inhibitory synaptic transmission within spinal networks, which consequently depresses local excitatory synapses and impairs synaptic transmission from high-threshold C-fibers. In animals with inflammation induced by Freund’s complete adjuvant, TAFA4 decreases the noxious stimulus-induced neuronal responses recorded in vivo and alleviates mechanical pain. Both effects are blocked by antagonists of GABAergic transmission. Furthermore, TAFA4 promotes microglial retraction in inflammation and increases the number of inhibitory synapses on lamina IIi somata. Altogether, these results demonstrate GABAergic interneurons to be the first integration relay for C-LTMRs and highlight a tight interplay between sensory neurons, microglial cells, and spinal interneurons, which fine-tunes inhibitory activity and nociceptive transmission in pathological conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Optical methods of interrogating neural circuits have emerged as powerful tools for understanding how the brain drives behaviors. Optogenetic proteins are widely used to control neuronal activity, while genetically encoded fluorescent reporters are used to monitor activity. These proteins are often expressed by injecting viruses, which frequently leads to inconsistent experiments due to misalignment of expression and optical components. Here, we describe how silk fibroin films simplify optogenetic experiments by providing targeted delivery of viruses. Films composed of silk fibroin and virus are applied to the surface of implantable optical components. After surgery, silk releases the virus to transduce nearby cells and provide localized expression around optical fibers and endoscopes. Silk films can also be used to express genetically encoded sensors in large cortical regions by using cranial windows coated with a silk/virus mixture. The ease of use and improved performance provided by silk make this a promising approach for optogenetic studies.

Abstract: Summary
Rodents explore their environment with an array of whiskers, inducing complex patterns of whisker deflections. Cortical neuronal networks can extract global properties of tactile scenes. In the primary somatosensory cortex, the information relative to the global direction of a spatiotemporal sequence of whisker deflections can be extracted at the single neuron level. To further understand how the cortical network integrates multi-whisker inputs, we imaged and recorded the mouse barrel cortex activity evoked by sequences of multi-whisker deflections generating global motions in different directions. A majority of barrel-related cortical columns show a direction preference for global motions with an overall preference for caudo-ventral directions. Responses to global motions being highly sublinear, the identity of the first deflected whiskers is highly salient but does not seem to determine the global direction preference. Our results further demonstrate that the global direction preference is spatially organized throughout the barrel cortex at a supra-columnar scale.

Abstract: Summary
MCL-1 is a BCL-2 family protein implicated in the development and chemoresistance of human cancer. Unlike its anti-apoptotic homologs, Mcl-1 deletion has profound physiologic consequences, indicative of a broader role in homeostasis. We report that the BCL-2 homology 3 (BH3) α helix of MCL-1 can directly engage very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD), a key enzyme of the mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) pathway. Proteomic analysis confirmed that the mitochondrial matrix isoform of MCL-1 (MCL-1Matrix) interacts with VLCAD. Mcl-1 deletion, or eliminating MCL-1Matrix alone, selectively deregulated long-chain FAO, causing increased flux through the pathway in response to nutrient deprivation. Transient elevation in MCL-1 upon serum withdrawal, a striking increase in MCL-1 BH3/VLCAD interaction upon palmitic acid titration, and direct modulation of enzymatic activity by the MCL-1 BH3 α helix are consistent with dynamic regulation. Thus, the MCL-1 BH3 interaction with VLCAD revealed a separable, gain-of-function role for MCL-1 in the regulation of lipid metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Growth factors induce and pattern sensory organs, but how their distribution is regulated by the extracellular matrix (ECM) is largely unclear. To address this question, we analyzed the diffusion behavior of Fgf10 molecules during sensory organ formation in the zebrafish posterior lateral line primordium. In this tissue, secreted Fgf10 induces organ formation at a distance from its source. We find that most Fgf10 molecules are highly diffusive and move rapidly through the ECM. We identify Anosmin1, which when mutated in humans causes Kallmann Syndrome, as an ECM protein that binds to Fgf10 and facilitates its diffusivity by increasing the pool of fast-moving Fgf10 molecules. In the absence of Anosmin1, Fgf10 levels are reduced and organ formation is impaired. Global overexpression of Anosmin1 slows the fast-moving Fgf10 molecules and results in Fgf10 dispersal. These results suggest that Anosmin1 liberates ECM-bound Fgf10 and shuttles it to increase its signaling range.

Abstract: We isolated and purified yak (Bos grunniens) endometrial epithelial cells and assayed different concentrations of estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) with respect to secretion of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Uterine epithelia were confirmed with Feulgen staining, karyotype analysis, and immunohistochemistry. Then, cells were treated with E2 and P4 and cultured in serum-free medium for 24 h. EGF and IGF-1 were measured with immunofluorescence, Real-time PCR (RT-PCR), Western blot (WB), and ELISA. When E2 and P4 were applied separately, the expression of EGF and IGF-1 did not change significantly, and EGF and IGF-1 gene and protein expression and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFR) gene expression were significantly increased when both hormones were combined. When the hormones were used singly, the optimal concentration of E2 was 10 ng/mL and of P4 was 100 ng/mL. When combined, the optimal E2 concentration was 10 ng/mL and P4 was 10 ng/mL. Thus, E2 and P4 can modulate expression of EGF and IGF-1 in endometrial epithelial cells at the morphological, gene, protein, and exocrine level, which is of great significance to improve the rate of yak embryo implantation and reproduction.
