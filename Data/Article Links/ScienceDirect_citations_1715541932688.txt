Abstract: The substitution of cation atoms by V, Cr and Ir in the natural and synthetic quaternary Cu2ZnSnS4 semiconductor is analyzed using first-principles methods. In most of the substitutions, the electronic structure of these modified CZTS is characterized for intermediate bands with different occupation and position within of the energy band gap. A study of the symmetry and composition of these intermediate bands is carried out for all substitutions. These bands permit additional photon absorption and emission channels depending on their occupation. The optical properties are obtained and analyzed. The absorption coefficients are split into contributions from the different absorption channels and from the inter- and intra-atomic components. The sub bandgap transitions are significant in many cases because the anion states contribute to the valence, conduction and intermediates bands. These properties could therefore be used for novel optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: Ataxin-3 (AT3) is the protein that triggers the inherited neurodegenerative disorder spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 when its polyglutamine (polyQ) stretch close to the C-terminus exceeds a critical length. AT3 consists of the N-terminal globular Josephin domain (JD) and the C-terminal disordered one. It cleaves isopeptide bonds between ubiquitin monomers, an event involved in protein quality control mechanisms. AT3 has been implicated in the pathway that sorts aggregated protein to aggresomes via microtubules, in which dynein and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) also seem to be involved. By taking advantage of small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), we have investigated the interaction of AT3 with tubulin and HDAC6. Based on SAXS results, the AT3 oligomer, consisting of 6–7 subunits, tightly binds to the tubulin hexameric oligomer in a “parallel” fashion. By SPR analysis we have demonstrated that AT3 binds to tubulin dimer with a 50nM affinity. Binding fits with a Langmuir 1:1 model and involves a single binding interface. Nevertheless, the interaction surface consists of three distinct, discontinuous tubulin-binding regions (TBR), one located in the JD, and the two others in the disordered domain, upstream and downstream of the polyQ stretch. In the absence of any of the three TBRs, the affinity is drastically reduced. By SPR we have also provided the first evidence of direct binding of AT3 to HDAC6, with affinity in the range 0.1–1μM. These results shed light on the interactions among the components of the transport machinery that sorts aggregate protein to the aggresome, and pave the way to in vivo studies aimed at further clarifying their roles.

Abstract: A finite difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation and experimental investigation of the enhanced light absorption in superstrate (PIN) type amorphous silicon germanium solar cells (a-SiGe:H) deposited on wet-etched Aluminum-doped zinc oxide (ZnO:Al) substrates are presented. Depending on the etching times, optimal vertical and lateral surface feature sizes, which balance the light scattering intensity and the light scattering angle, exist for a-SiGe:H solar cells. The surface morphology analysis, FDTD simulation, and experimental results concurrently show the maximum absorption of the long wavelength region will be achieved when the randomly textured surface with proper vertical and lateral surface feature sizes is applied in the solar cells. Due to the small inclination angle of 5°–20° on the wet-etched ZnO:Al surfaces, the light absorption is enhanced without producing a negative effect on the open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) of the a-SiGe:H solar cell, unlike the negative effects seen in hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon solar cell (μc-Si:H) on low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) ZnO substrates. An initial efficiency of 10.10% for PIN type a-SiGe:H single junction solar cell was achieved by adopting the optimized surface morphology.

Abstract: Upconversion of sub-band-gap photons has the potential to increase the efficiency of solar cells significantly, but requires modification of the solar cells. In this paper, we present a calculation framework to assess the efficiency of a combined bifacial silicon solar cell upconverter device, which is then used to optimize the solar cell׳s front and rear side anti-reflection coatings. Our calculations show that an upconverter can increase the efficiency of an optimized solar cell by 3.0% relative. Subsequently, planar bifacial n-type silicon solar cells were fabricated with optimized anti-reflection coatings. An upconversion layer – containing the upconverter phosphor β-NaY0.8Er0.2F4 embedded in the polymer perfluorocyclobutyl – was attached to the rear side of the solar cells and an external quantum efficiency arising from the upconversion of sub-band-gap photons of 1.69% was measured under 1508nm monochromatic excitation with an irradiance of 1091W/m2. This corresponds to a value of 0.15 (W/cm2)−1 when normalized to the irradiance, constituting a five-fold increase compared to the previously best published normalized values that were achieved without optimized solar cells.

Abstract: Linear polyurethane (PU) ionomers were synthesized as solid–solid phase changing materials (PCMs) for thermal energy storage. Poly(ethylene glycol)s (PEGs) with 6000 and 10,000g/mol number average molecular weight were used as latent heat storage materials, and 4,4-diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI), N-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) and 1,3-Propanesulfonate (PS) were used as supporting materials. The phase change enthalpies of PU ionomers were 142.5J/g and 152.3J/g respectively, which were much close to the highest reported value of the branched PUPCM or the cross-linking PUPCM. The results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) suggested a high degree of phase separation existed in PU ionomers. And the thermal resistance of PU ionomers was improved by the introduction of ionic groups.

Abstract: In multi-junction devices, due to the series connection of junctions, recombination current from the top junctions can be directed to the bottom ones affecting their electrical characteristics. Recently, luminescence coupling effects during External Quantum Efficiency (EQE) measurements at very intense light bias conditions indicated high recombination current flowing towards the bottom junctions of the cells. In an attempt to find the magnitude of coupling current as well as the factors affecting the optical interactions between junctions, excitation and voltage dependent Photoluminescence (PL) measurements of GaInP/GaInAs/Ge have been carried out. An investigation using junctions with different shunt resistances has been conducted to identify the impact of shunts on the coupling current. Furthermore the impact of temperature on the coupling current has been considered. Our results show that a maximum of 2.3% of the recombination current of the top junction is converted to coupling current in the middle junction depending on the devices under examination. The coupling efficiency depends on the shunt resistance of the top junctions as well as on the temperature. Furthermore a physical model of the current limiting junction was built taking into consideration the impact of local ohmic shunts in the solar cell device and used to validate the experimental data taken.

Abstract: Microparticles are produced by vesiculation of the cell plasma membrane and serve as vectors of cell-to-cell communication. Co-culture experiments have shown that hypoxia-inducible factor-α (HIF-α)-regulated-genes are up-regulated in human renal proximal tubular HK-2 cells by endothelial cell factors which might be transported inside endothelial microparticles (EMP). Here we aimed to study in HK-2 cells the effect of EMP, produced by activated endothelial cells, on HIF-α and HIF-α-regulated vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A). EMP, at a concentration much lower than that found in plasma, increased the expression of HIF-α/VEGF-A in a COX-2/EP2 receptor dependent manner. Since the EMP/cells ratio was ∼1/1000, we hypothesized that paracrine mediators produced by HK-2 cells amplified the initial signal. This hypothesis was confirmed by two facts which also suggested that the mediators were conveyed by particles released by HK-2 cells: (i) HIF-α was up-regulated in HK-2 cells treated with the pellet obtained from the conditioned medium of the EMP-treated HK-2 cells. (ii) In transwell experiments, EMP-treated cells increased the expression of HIF-α in untreated HK-2 cells. Interestingly, we detected these cells, particles that were released by EMP-treated HK-2 cells. Depending on the pathological context, activation of HIF-α and VEGF-A signaling in renal tissue/cells may have either beneficial or harmful effects. Therefore, our results suggest that their presence in the urinary space of EMP produced by activated endothelial cells may influence the outcome of a number of renal diseases.

Abstract: Chemotherapy is commonly used to treat early-stage invasive and advanced-stage breast cancer either before or after surgery. Increasing evidence from clinical analysis and in vitro studies has shown that ER-positive breast cancer cells are insensitive to chemotherapy. Complete understanding of how ERα mediates drug resistance is prerequisite to improvement of the chemotherapeutic efficacy. Over-expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) encoded by MDR1 gene is one of the major causes of drug resistance. The association between ERα and MDR1 in breast cancer is still unclear and the limited reports are conflict. This study systematically explored intrinsic link between ERα and the P-gp over-expression in paclitaxel-resistant ERα(+) breast cancer cell lines and mouse model in molecular details. Our data showed that ERα activated the MDR1 transcription in MCF-7/PTX breast cancer cells by binding to ERE1/2 and interacting with Sp1 that bridged to the downstream CG-rich element within the MDR1 promoter. Knockdown of MDR1 restrained the effect of ERα in MCF-7 cells and sensitized the cells to paclitaxel. Treatment of ICI 182,780 that selectively suppressed ERα significantly decreased the MDR1 expression and increased the sensitivity of drug resistant breast cancer cells and xenograft tumors to paclitaxel. Our data strongly demonstrated that ERα was able to increase drug resistance of breast cancer cells through activating MDR1 transcription. This novel mechanism provides new insight to how the ERα signaling regulates response of ERα(+) breast tumors to chemotherapy, which may be exploited for developing novel therapeutic strategies for breast cancer in the future.

Abstract: In this paper we study the transport-recombination mechanisms using impedance spectroscopy of organic solar cells (OSC) based on a blend of a small molecule, 7,7′-(4,4-bis(2ethylhexyl)-4H-silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b′] dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(6-fluoro-4-(5′-hexyl-[2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5] thiadiazole) (DTS(FBTTh2)2) and 1-(3-methoxycarbonyl)-propyl-1-1-phenyl-(6,6) C70 (PC70BM). We fabricate a cell with structure ITO/Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(4-styrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS))/DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC70BM/Ca/Al that exhibits Jsc=10.2mA/cm2, Voc=0.816V and FF=65% resulting in a PCE=5.4%. We model the impedance behavior using two circuital models, the parallel R-CPE and the transmission line model proposed by Belmonte et al. [1]. We compared the results to those obtained for OSC based on a standard poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT): 1-(3-methoxycarbonyl)-propyl-1-1-phenyl-(6,6) C61 (PC60BM) blend with structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PC60BM/LiF/Al. We find that in the case of the small molecule based OSC diffusion dominates over recombination for this thickness, L=125nm, even at high frequencies. We calculate the effective carrier lifetimes and mobilities for both structures using both models. Average electron mobility calculated for the small molecule cell is around 4–6.4×10−3cm2/Vs, slightly higher than that obtained for the standard blend which is around 2×10−3cm2/Vs.

Abstract: Large area processing of organic semiconductors to photovoltaic cells and modules opens up a large potential for commercialization. At the same time, the scale-up of fabrication techniques entails evaluation and optimization of several process parameters. In this study, comprising a state-of-the-art absorber polymer (PTB7, together with PC60BM), we vary processing parameters for blade coated and gravure printed active layers and evaluate their effects on solar cell performance. Thus, efficiencies of up to 3.6% for coated and 1.6% for printed cells on a flexible substrate could be obtained.

Abstract: Solution processing for kesterite Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) thin-film solar cells has the potential to provide economical and large-scale implementation of highly efficient photovoltaics. However, to date, post-sulfurization/selenization at high temperatures (500–550°C) or highly toxic solvents have generally been involved in most fabrication routes, resulting in problems such as phase separation, chalcogen loss (or Sn loss), and safety issues. In this paper, an ethanol solvent-based precursor ink is newly designed for fabricating a CZTSSe absorber layer at much lower temperatures (as low as 400°C) without a post-sulfurization/selenization process. The precursor ink is composed of a commercially available powder mixture of easily decomposable copper(II) formate, Zn, Sn, S, and Se, which allow us to fabricate a CZTSSe film with large grains (1–1.5μm) and a reasonable band gap (~1.1eV). It is found that the formation of a homogeneous CZTSSe phase could be effectively promoted by rapid annealing, suggesting that the ramping rate is a critical factor to obtaining high quality absorber layer. Our CZTSSe device (rapidly annealed at 400°C) exhibits an efficiency of 4.67% under AM 1.5 illumination.

Abstract: The efficiency of exciton extraction from nanocrystals is defined as the ratio of the number of extracted excitons to the number of absorbed photons. This efficiency is studied here based on a phenomenological model parameterized by recent experimental results in CdSe nanocrystals. Several possibilities of interplay among all possible electronic transition rates (Auger recombination, impact ionization, radiative recombination and electron–hole escape) are explored showing the possibility of obtaining efficiencies above 100% when multiple exciton generation processes are taken into account.

Abstract: In this paper we report on the fabrication of laser-doped p-type bifacial cells using self-aligned metal-plating with energy conversion efficiencies as high as 19.2%. A key fabrication step for these cells is recognising that the p-type silicon regions can be made cathodic by forward biasing the p–n junction in a process which we call here field-induced plating (FIP). Used in conjunction with light-induced plating (LIP) in the same plating apparatus, FIP can be used to form low cost nickel/copper grids on both surfaces of a cell. Furthermore, the simplicity of the FIP process means that it can potentially be performed using the same plating equipment and chemistry as used for LIP. Plating rates similar to LIP were achieved (i.e., ~10µm of copper in 10min), however there is potential to plate at much faster rates with FIP because the junction is forward-biased. This bifacial cell plating method could be adapted to metallise a range of bifacial cells including heterojunction cells.

Abstract: Ecotropic viral integration site 1 was originally identified as a retroviral integration site in murine leukemias. Several studies have established ecotropic viral integration site 1 as both a transcription factor and an interacting partner that presumably regulates gene expression. Using coimmunoprecipitation and fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis, we found that the N-terminal domain of hypermethylated in cancer 1 interacts with the proximal set of zinc fingers of ecotropic viral integration site 1. This interaction not only abolishes the DNA binding activity of ecotropic viral integration site 1 but also disrupts the transcriptional activity of an anti-apoptotic gene promoter selectively targeted by ecotropic viral integration site 1. By using flow cytometry and western blotting, here we show that hypermethylated in cancer 1 can deregulate ecotropic viral integration site 1-mediated blockage of apoptosis. We hypothesize that therapeutic upregulation of hypermethylated in cancer 1 may provide an important means of targeting ecotropic viral integration site 1-positive cancers.

Abstract: The cellular localization of A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs), protein kinase A (PKAs) and phosphodiesterases (PDEs) is a key step to the spatiotemporal regulation of the second messenger adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP). In this paper the cellular distribution of the mitochondrial AKAP 149–PKA–PDE4A complex and its implications in the cell death induced by YTX treatment, a known PDE modulator, was studied. K-562 cell line was incubated with YTX for 24 or 48h. Under these conditions AKAP 149, PKA and type-4A PDE (PDE4A) levels were measured in the cytosol, in the plasma membrane and in the nucleus. Apoptotic hallmarks were also measured after the same conditions. In addition, YTX effect on cell viability was checked after AKAP 149 and PDE4A silencing. The results obtained show a decrease in AKAP 149–PKA–PDE4A levels in cytosol after YTX exposure. 24h after the toxin addition, the complex expression increased in the plasma membrane and after 48h in the nucleus domain. Furthermore Bcl-2 levels were decreased and the expression of caspase 3 together with caspase 8 activity were increased after 24h of toxin incubation but not after 48h. These results suggest apoptotic cell death at 24h and a non-apoptotic cell death after 48h. When AKAP 149 and PDE4A were silenced YTX did not induce cellular death. In summary, AKAP 149–PKA–PDE4A complex localization is related with YTX effect in K-562 cell line. When this complex is mainly located in the plasma membrane apoptosis is activated while when the complex is in the nuclear domain non-apoptotic cellular death or cellular differentiation is activated. Therefore AKAP 149–PKA–PDE4A distribution and integrity have a key role in cellular survival.

Abstract: The electrical properties of crystalline silicon crucially depend on the mobility of minority and majority charge carriers. As parameters like the conductivity and the diffusion length are directly connected to carrier mobility, its exact prediction is essential for device simulation and material characterization. While generally accepted mobility models exist for uncompensated silicon, strong deviations have been observed in compensated silicon depending on the compensation level. Different approaches have been suggested for modeling majority carrier mobility correcting for compensation. In this work, the controversially discussed physical reasons for mobility reductions in compensated silicon are critically reviewed and we present a unified description of mobility in silicon. Based on the approach suggested by Schindler et al. [Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells 106 (2012) 31–36], which describes the modeling of majority carrier mobilities in p-type compensated silicon at room temperature, the model is extended to both majority and minority carrier mobilities in p- and n-type compensated silicon at room temperature and a description for the temperature dependence is suggested. Fit parameters are obtained based on a wide range of published and new carrier mobility data presented here. Additionally, a new parameterization for scattering of holes by phonons is presented and included in the model.

Abstract: We report the use of a bisphenol A-based epoxy resin for use as an encapsulant material on bulk-heterojunction organic photovoltaic devices which, by way of an exothermic curing process, can also thermally anneal devices leading to increases in short circuit current density, fill factor and power conversion efficiency. As well as improving the electrical characteristics of devices, the encapsulant is effective as a barrier material to protect against degradation in air. The single-step process to both anneal and encapsulate devices could lead to improvements in the efficiency of commercial-level photovoltaic fabrication processes, a goal which is in keeping with the low-energy fabrication ethos of organic electronics in general.

Abstract: Self-textured zinc oxide polycrystalline films prepared by metalorganic low-pressure chemical vapor deposition combine excellent transparency, conductivity and light-scattering ability when used as electrodes for high-efficiency thin-film silicon solar cells. However, the growth of silicon layers with low defect density, which are necessary for high-performance solar cells, often requires the rough surface morphology of as-deposited zinc oxide films to be smoothened. This is usually achieved by a post-deposition argon plasma-etching treatment. We investigate here an alternative method to modify the surface morphology by changing the zinc oxide growth conditions over only the last hundreds of nanometers of the total film thickness. We discuss two types of zinc oxide cap layers, one grown with the addition of ethanol and the other with an enhanced diethylzinc (DEZ) precursor flow. We show that the presence of either type of cap layer does not alter the layer׳s electrical properties, but does slightly diminish the layer׳s light-scattering ability. The cap layer grown with ethanol leads to a more pronounced leveling of the film texture, while the high-DEZ-grown layer better preserves the sharp features of the underlying ZnO. Finally, zinc oxide films with cap layer are used as front electrodes for tandem amorphous/microcrystalline silicon solar cells, and are compared to rough films treated with an argon plasma. With rising thickness of the capping layers, the efficiency of tandem cells increases reaching values over 12%, and approaches that of cells on Ar plasma treated ZnO films.

Abstract: Aberrant glycosylation may promote tumor invasion and metastasis. To investigate whether microRNA (miRNA) is involved in glycosylation-related metastasis, we examined the role of let-7c, a well-known tumor-suppressor miRNA, in glycosylation in murine hepatocarcinoma cell lines Hca-F and Hca-P. We found that let-7c level was higher in Hca-P cells (with lower lymphatic metastasis potential) than in Hca-F cells (with higher lymphatic metastasis potential). Overexpression of let-7c decreased hyper-N-glycosylation of Hca-F cells and repressed their metastatic and invasive ability. Mannoside acetylglucosaminyltransferase 4, isoenzyme A (Mgat4a) is a key glycosyltransferase in the pathway of synthesizing complex N-glycans. Bioinformatics analysis indicates that Mgat4a may be a target of let-7c, which has been verified by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. Furthermore, the anti-metastatic effect of overexpressed let-7c is similar to that of Mgat4a siRNAs transfection. Hence, our results suggest that let-7c may inhibit the metastatic ability of Hca-F cells, at least partially, via repressing Mgat4a activity.

Abstract: The optical performance of tandem a-Si:H/μc-Si:H (micromorph) thin film solar cell was investigated experimentally and by means of rigorous 3-D optical simulation. The interplay of intermediate reflectors, with different refractive indices and thicknesses, and front electrode surface texture was studied. Experiments and simulations show that LPCVD ZnO based front electrodes have the highest optical potential together with a low refractive index of the intermediate reflector. The intermediate reflector layer serves for redistribution of the mid-range solar spectrum between the top and bottom cell, while the sum of the top and bottom cell currents decreases with increasing IRL thickness. Additionally, promising concepts to increase the short-circuit current of the tandem solar cell are shown. The most important steps are related to lowering parasitic absorption in supportive layers by the introduction of silicon oxide layers and improving the light incoupling by introduction of anti-reflective layers.

Symmetrical Al2O3-based passivation layers for p- and n-type silicon,

Abstract: Al2O3 nanolayers, as currently used in the solar industry, provide excellent passivation over the entire injection level range for p-type Si. A high concentration of negative fixed charges guarantees excellent field effect passivation. However, on n-type Si, those fixed charges create an inversion layer at the surface, which opens an additional near-surface recombination channel. This results in a reduced minority carrier lifetime at low injection levels, which is the operation condition of solar cells. In this work, a passivation layer stack is presented, showing excellent performance within the complete injection level range symmetrically for both p- and n-type Si. This layer stack consists of 20nm Al2O3 combined with a thin HfO2 or SiO2 interface. Electrical measurements show a reduction of the fixed charge density to virtually ‘zero’, when the interface layer is adjusted accordingly. This affects the field effect passivation and leads to a decrease of the near surface recombination in n-type Si. The introduction of five cycles of atomic layer deposited HfO2 improves the effective carrier lifetime in passivated n-type Si from 6 to 15ms at an injection level of 5×1012cm−3. The same passivation stack hardly influences the lifetime in p-type Si. The effective surface recombination velocity reaches values below 1cm/s for both types of substrate doping. In case of the introduction of a 1nm thick SiO2 interface, which also results in ‘zero’ fixed charges, the surface recombination velocity reaches a value of up to 200cm/s due to enhanced surface recombination. The comparison of both passivation stacks shows that the introduction of an ultrathin HfO2 interface is the most promising approach to achieve a symmetrical passivation layer for p- and n-type Si.

Abstract: A cost-effective procedure for hydrophobization of commercial silica nanoparticles by octadecyltrichlorosilane or trichloro (1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl) silane was developed. The functionalized nanoparticle solution could easily be applied on a glass surface by Langmuir-Schaefer deposition or spincoating to create a superhydrophobic surface with the contact angle above 170°. A hydrophobization driven formation of nanoparticle clusters resulted in multiscale hierarchical surface roughness as evidenced by the stylus profilometry and atomic force microscopy. Consequently, optical measurements in the vis-NIR region revealed enhanced forward diffuse scattering and reduced reflectance in a broad interval of the incidence angles. A small sliding angle far below 1° suggests additional coating functionalities such as the self-cleaning and anti-icing. The coating was tested on a front surface of an organic photovoltaic device. A more than 6% enhancement of the photoconversion efficiency comparing with the uncoated device was achieved which may be even larger in real operation conditions considering the air pollution and humidity.

Abstract: Photoluminescence (PL) imaging over a large area (4.5×4.5cm2) is demonstrated on polycrystalline silicon thin films and solar cells on glass. PL imaging is a well-established technique for characterisation of silicon wafers and wafer-based solar cells, however its application to crystalline silicon thin films on glass was not possible due to low material quality and volume, and IR noise from the glass substrate. This paper reports methods to overcome these limitations, the design of a thin-film silicon PL imaging system, examples of PL images of silicon films at different processing stages and preliminary findings. It is demonstrated that the observed PL images qualitatively correlate with the silicon film crystal grain structure and quality.

Abstract: A photoelectrochemical (PEC) device capable of splitting water into storable hydrogen fuel by the direct use of solar energy is becoming a very attractive technology since it is clean and sustainable. Indeed, real field experiments are being developed in order to assess technological issues for large-scale usage under outdoor conditions. Following the need for developing photoelectrochemical devices with an optimized design that allows reaching a commercial performance level, the present works describes an innovative PEC cell for testing different photoelectrodes configurations, suitable for continuous operation and for easily collect the evolved gases. Moreover, a porous Teflon® diaphragm useable for a wide range of aqueous electrolyte solutions is tested. Two semiconductors were investigated: tungsten trioxide and undoped hematite. The WO3 photoelectrodes were deposited in two different substrates: (i) anodized WO3 photoelectrodes on a metal substrate and (ii) WO3 deposited by blade spreading method on a TCO glass substrate. The undoped-Fe2O3 photoanode was deposited by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis technique in a TCO glass substrate. The material deposited on glass substrates allows to obtain transparent photoelectrodes. Photocurrent–voltage characteristics were obtained for all samples characterized under three different conditions: (i) no membrane separating the anode and the cathode evolution; (ii) using a Teflon® diaphragm and (iii) using a Nafion® 212 membrane. The transparent samples (photoanodes deposited on glass substrates) produced the highest values of photocurrent when the Teflon® diaphragm was used. This photocurrent enhancement was assigned to the high reflectance showed by the diaphragm, which reflects back a significant fraction of the transmitted solar radiation.

Abstract: A way to upscale the manufacture of organic solar cells is through roll-to-roll processing in which is required to develop fully solution-processed devices. However, deposition via solution of opaque electrodes as final layer on top of the device stack has shown to still be challenging. In this work we present a simple method to develop such electrode based on silver plate-shaped micro-particles. We demonstrate that this electrode do not affect the underlying device structure while providing an optimal performance in terms of low sheet resistance and electrical stability. The final fabricated devices achieved up to 2.2% efficiency and very low device series resistance values.

Abstract: In this paper, we report a systematic study of the growth and evolution mechanism of quaternary Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) nanocrystals (NCs) in a polyetheramine solvent. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the growth mechanism of CZTSe NCs based on polyetheramine chelation. Pure-phase CZTSe NCs were synthesized by a facile one-pot heating process. High-quality CZTSe NCs were easily obtained by mixing the precursors and simply heating them to the reaction temperature. Synthesis parameters, including reaction temperature, reaction time, and precursor concentration, which influence the morphology, size, and monodispersity of CZTSe NCs, were studied in detail. Time- and temperature-dependent experiments were performed to observe the growth of CZTSe NCs. The final CZTSe NCs were evolved from triangle-like Cu2Se crystals to pure spherical crystals. On the basis of detailed time-dependent shape and elemental composition evaluations, a possible asynchronous doping growth and formation mechanism is proposed. Moreover, the optical and electrical properties of pure CZTSe NCs were also investigated. The band gap of CZTSe was approximately 1.57eV, which is close to the optimum value for solar photoelectric conversion. Further, the investigation of the current–voltage characteristics and Hall effect revealed p-type conduction, and the hole carrier concentration, hole mobility, and resistivity were found to be 3.11×1018cm−3, 8.28cm2/V-s, and 0.24Ω-cm, respectively. These results indicate that CZTSe NCs are suitable for use as an absorber layer in low-cost solar cells.

Abstract: Introduction of broadband antireflection coatings (ARCs) is a promising method to enhance efficiency of solar cells. In this paper, the TiO2–SiO2 stack coatings with refractive-index-grade structure are proposed and have been successfully fabricated via sol–gel dip-coating technique. The structure, morphology, optical properties and wettability of TiO2–SiO2 stack coatings were systemically investigated. The broadband antireflection performance is improved over the solar spectrum with increase of solar transmittance by 7.80% and maximum transmittance of 99.16% at 550nm on glass slide substrates. The responding reflectance is largely reduced and the minimum values in visible and near-infrared regions are 0.40% and 0.05%, respectively. By introducing broadband ARCs, the efficiency of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells is increased from 11.20% to 12.15%, which reveals superiority and importance of TiO2–SiO2 stack coating as an outstanding antireflection material, having high potential for practical applications.

Abstract: Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1) is an important chemoattractant for microglia. Rodent MCP1 carries a heavily glycosylated C-terminus, which has been predicted to increase local MCP1 concentration, promote MCP1 dimerization/oligomerization, and facilitate receptor engagement. Previous studies have shown that MCP1 mutant lacking the glycosylated C-terminus cannot dimerize/oligomerize, but has higher chemotactic potency than the wild-type (full-length) MCP1, suggesting that rodent MCP1 may function as a monomer. Although many groups support this hypothesis, there is no direct evidence on whether rodent MCP1 dimer is functional. In this paper, using forced recombinant dimeric MCP1 proteins we show that mouse MCP1 dimer is unable to activate Rac1, promote protrusion of lamellipodia, or induce microglial migration, although it can bind to CCR2 and mediate its internalization. These results support the idea that signaling events mediated by MCP1 require the presence of the monomeric form of this chemokine.

Abstract: We present an investigation of the electrical characteristics – recombination and contact resistance – of poly-crystalline (poly) Si/mono-crystalline (c) Si junctions and of the influence of the interfacial oxide between the poly-Si and the c-Si on these characteristics. In particular, we compare thermally grown oxides with different thickness values with wet chemically grown oxides. Both n- and p-type poly-Si emitters are investigated. For one combination (n-type poly-Si, thermal oxide), we compare planar and textured surfaces. For all oxide types investigated, we achieve combinations of low recombination current densities <20fA/cm² and low specific contact resistances <0.1Ωcm². The corresponding implied open-circuit voltages measured on our test structures are 732mV (n-type poly-Si) and 711mV (p-type poly-Si). By applying these poly-Si layers on a solar cell structure, we achieve an open-circuit voltage of 714mV and a series resistance of 0.6Ωcm².

Abstract: It is proposed that air–rock packed beds are suitable for thermal storage in solar power plants at temperatures of approximately 500–600°C. However, little has been published in the field of thermal energy storage on the suitability of rock for this particular application. Desirable characteristics of rock for this application are presented, and the different rock types are discussed in the light of these requirements. A survey of the literature in other fields on rock characteristics shows which rock is most likely to be suitable. Results from thermal cycling tests (more than 900 cycles at rates of 2°C/min) on a variety of rock samples are reported. Dolerite withstood this process well; some gneisses did but others did not. Geological maps showing the availability of potentially suitable rock in solar-rich regions of South Africa are presented. There are potentially suitable rock types (for example dolerite, granite, gneiss) in parts of the country which are deemed to have a good solar resource. Dolerite, which is found in copious quantities in insolation-rich regions, should be well-suited to packed bed thermal storage.

Abstract: Thermochemical heat storage materials such as MgSO4 and MgCl2 offer high energy storage densities and an inexpensive and clean means of long-term solar energy storage. The aim of this paper is to investigate zeolite–MgCl2 composites as potential heat storage materials, studying the link between the composites physico-chemical properties and the heat of dehydration/hydration obtained. Four series of wide pore zeolite composites containing 5–15wt% MgCl2 have been prepared and characterized. Zeolites Na-X, Mordenite and Y (Na and H) were selected with the goal of impregnating the highest quantity of MgCl2, while achieving the highest heat release/store possible. Heats of water sorption/desorption studies of MgCl2 composites using thermogravimetry coupled to differential scanning calorimetry (TG–DSC) were recorded and compared with those of analogous MgSO4 composites. Both Na-Y and H-Y containing 15wt% MgCl2 achieved the highest heats of water sorption (1173 and 970Jg−1, respectively). BET surface area and pore volume measurements lead to clarification that a retention of the host zeolites large pore volume upon impregnation is essential to allow accessibility of water molecules to the dehydrated salt particles. It was shown that MgCl2 composites offered a far superior heat release upon hydration in comparison to that of MgSO4 composites, due to the higher energy density of MgCl2, but also due to the blocking of zeolite pores with MgSO4 particles.

Abstract: In this work, we have systematically investigated the effects of illumination intensity on the electrical characteristics of GaFeO3/p-Si heterostructure. The current–voltage (I–V) measurements of the heterostructure based on GaFeO3 thin film were performed in dark and under different illumination intensities. The photocurrent in the reverse biased I–V measurement is strongly sensitive to photo-illumination. The ideality factor (n) and zero-bias barrier height (Φb0) were found to be strongly illumination dependent and while Φb0 decreases, n increases with decreasing illumination. From capacitance–voltage (C–V) characteristics, it has been seen that the capacitance decreases as the frequency increases, exhibiting a continuous distribution of the interface states at frequency range 10kHz to 1MHz. The interface state density was determined by conductance method for dark conditions. It is believed that the combination of p-Si and thin GaFeO3 layer will provide new opportunities as a photodiode sensor for visible light sensor applications.

Abstract: Exposure to accelerated humidity lifetime conditions has been proved to have detrimental effects on organic photovoltaics (OPV) performance, because of the deterioration of the electrodes of the device rather than the active layer. Normal and inverted OPV devices are investigated in order to identify their main degradation mechanisms under accelerated humidity lifetime conditions. Reverse engineering can be a useful technique to probe main degradation mechanisms of the top electrode of both normal and inverted organic photovoltaic (OPVs). By using reverse engineering methods, we show that the major degradation mechanism of inverted OPVs under accelerated humidity lifetime conditions, is due to PEDOT:PSS hole selective top contact.

Abstract: Microcapsules containing n-octadecane with different n-butyl methacrylate (BMA)-based copolymer shells were fabricated by a suspension-like polymerization method. n-butyl acrylate (BA), methacrylic acid (MAA) and acrylic acid (AA) were employed as monomers to copolymerize with BMA. The surface morphologies of the microencapsulated phase change materials (MicroPCMs) were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The thermal properties, thermal reliabilities and thermal stabilities of the MicroPCMs were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The temperature-regulated properties of the MicroPCMs were determined by an infrared thermography. The incorporation of MAA or AA to the acrylic composition of the polymer shells led to an increase in both the heat storage capacities and thermal stabilities of the MicroPCMs. The MicroPCMs with P(BMA-co-MAA) exhibit a greater heat capacity and thermal stability compared with the MicroPCMs with P(BMA-co-AA). The MicroPCMs with P(BMA-co-MAA) have the highest latent heats of melting (144.3J/g) and crystallization (152.9J/g) as well as the highest thermal resistant temperature (249°C). The phase change temperatures and enthalpies of the MicroPCMs varied little after 1000 thermal cycles. Thermal images showed that the gypsum board containing the MicroPCMs with BMA-based copolymers as shells, especially with P(BMA-co-MAA) and P(BMA-co-AA) as shells, possessed temperature-regulated properties. As a result, the MicroPCMs with BMA-based copolymers as shells have good thermal energy storage and thermal regulation potentials, such as solar energy-saving building materials.

Abstract: Electrochromic (EC) devices represent an effective way to modulate the intensity of incoming solar radiation in buildings or through the sun roofs of cars, but can also be used in helmets, sunglasses and home appliances. Herein we report on the development of all sol–gel WO3-based EC devices of a battery type, in which all three internal layers were prepared via sol–gel processes. A comparison of the performance of EC devices assembled with two different counter electrode films, i.e. V-oxide (150°C) and Sn/Mo-oxide (500°C) films deposited on fluorine dopped tin oxide (FTO) glass, is presented. The applicability of both types of counter electrodes for flexible polymeric substrates is also demonstrated. The sol–gel electrolyte (ormolyte) based on (3-glycidoxypropyl)trimethoxysilane was applied in EC devices; additionally, three different lithium salts were introduced, i.e. lithium perclorate (LiClO4), lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate (LiCF3SO3) and lithium bis(oxalato)borate (LiBOB). The spectroelectrochemical characterisation of the EC devices revealed that the optical modulation at 634nm increased when electrolytes with LiClO4<LiCF3SO3<LiBOB were used.

Abstract: We design, simulate and fabricate enhanced thin film silicon solar cells using periodically textured photonic crystal substrates. We utilize a thin film absorber layer consisting of a superlattice of alternating hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and nano-crystalline silicon (nc-Si). Rigorous vectorial simulations optimized the periodically patterned solar cells by solving Maxwell׳s equations in Fourier space. Simulations found optimized architectures for a triangular lattice of metallic nano-cones as a back-reflector, and a conformal solar cell geometry. The periodically patterned photonic crystal based substrates achieve (1) high diffraction, enhancing the path length of light in thin absorber layers and (2) plasmonic concentration of light intensity. Simulations predict an absorption enhancement of 43% for a 12-period superlattice of 800nm thickness. The optimized pitch of the photonic lattice is near 700nm. Experimentally the periodically patterned substrates were fabricated with nano-imprint lithography, and utilized as a substrate for the superlattice cells. We measured a large photo-current enhancement between the textured photonic crystal based superlattice cell and the flat cell of 21%, together with long-wavelength quantum efficiency enhancements beyond 600nm. This is an approach to achieving thin film solar cells with high currents through advanced light-trapping techniques on novel materials.

Abstract: Optical and recombination losses in thin-film solar cells based on CuInxGa1-xSe2 with the bandgaps 1.14–1.16 and 1.36–1.38eV have been evaluated. Parameters used for the analysis and calculations were verified by comparing the measured quantum efficiency spectra with the results of calculations. Optical losses due to reflections from the interfaces and absorption in the ZnO and CdS layers are found using the optical constants of materials taking into account anti-reflection coating on the ZnO surface. It is shown that for typical parameters of solar cells studied the optical losses amount to 16–18%. Losses due to the recombination of charge carriers at the front and back surfaces of the absorbing layer and in the space charge region (SCR) are calculated based on their dependences on the carrier lifetime, the concentration of uncompensated acceptors (determined the width of the SCR) and other parameters of the absorber. Total recombination losses in solar cells with the bandgaps of CuIn(Ga,In)Se2 1.14 and 1.36eV are equal to 7.0% and 4.5%, respectively. It is also shown that for solar cell with the bandgap of absorber 1.14eV, an incomplete charge collection is caused also due to non-optimal width of the SCR. An improvement of charge collection in this cell can be achieved by varying the concentration of uncompensated acceptors in the absorber. However, it is impossible to achieve such improvement for solar cells with the bandgap of 1.36eV due to shorter carrier lifetime in the material.

Abstract: The preparation, characterization and modification of eutectic hydrate salt (CaCl2·6H2O–MgCl2·6H2O) as a new phase change material (PCM) were investigated in this paper. CaCl2·6H2O was prepared using industrial grade calcium chloride (CaCl2), and then 10, 15, 20 and 25wt% MgCl2·6H2O was added into CaCl2·6H2O respectively in order to obtain CaCl2·6H2O–MgCl2·6H2O eutectic hydrate salt PCM. The modification of CaCl2·6H2O-25wt% MgCl2·6H2O material was designed by a uniform experimental method to select the efficient nucleating and thickening agents. The results show that SrCl2·6H2O and SrCO3 can be effective nucleating agents, and hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) is an excellent thickener. For CaCl2·6H2O-25wt% MgCl2·6H2O material with 3wt% SrCl2·6H2O, 1wt% SrCO3 and 0.5wt% HEC, the supercooling is reduced to 2°C, and its phase change temperature and latent heat are 21.4°C and 102.3J/g, respectively.

Abstract: The present study aims to present the current status of the results obtained using Elkem Solar Silicon (ESS™) as feedstock basis for solar cell and modules. It is shown that solar cells based on ESS™ are able to follow the development of the solar industry obtaining comparable efficiencies to standard polysilicon based cells. The characteristics of ESS™ based solar cells, having normally higher Voc and FF and lower Isc, seem to give clear advantages in the field for solar modules located at high irradiance areas. Results from several locations show enhanced electricity production of ESS™ based solar modules compared to polysilicon at increasing solar irradiance. This is explained by beneficial temperature coefficients for ESS™ based solar cells. Lower electrical loss for ESS™ modules is also expected to contribute to the same beneficial performance under conditions of high solar irradiance.

Abstract: Although the spectral effects of direct and diffuse radiation on solar photovoltaic (PV) performance are relatively well understood, recent investigations have shown that there can be a spectral bias introduced due to albedo from common ground surfaces that can impact the optimal selection of PV materials for a known location. This paper extends analysis to the effects of spectral bias due to the specular reflectivity of 22 commonly occurring surface materials (both man-made and natural) and analyzes the albedo effects on the performance of seven PV materials covering three common PV system topologies: industrial (solar farms), commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched roof applications. An effective albedo is found for each surface material and PV material combination, which can be used in lieu of broadband albedo values in PV simulations. These results enable PV material selection for specific environments enabling geographic optimization for the micro-environment, while at the same time assisting optimal surface selection in the vicinity of existing or planned PV arrays. This analysis is of particular significance for the modeling of performance of bi-facial PV modules and vertical BIPV.

Abstract: This work reports the growth of thermochromic amorphous vanadium dioxide coatings on SnO2-precoated glass substrates by atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition using vanadyl (V) triisopropoxide as single-precursor at 450°C. The best reversible transition behavior was at 65.5°C as derived from the transmittance–temperature measurements. This finding is discussed in terms of variations in microstructure occurring during the different nitrogen flow rate studies. We show that the thermochromic behavior of the oxides is determined by the presence of well-defined monoclinic vanadium dioxide.

Abstract: In order to meet the requirements of high temperature solar thermal power generation better, the melting point of mixed carbonates should be further reduced. Starting with ternary carbonates, we modified their composition ratios and added NaNO3 or NaOH as additives. Their new melting points, initial crystallization points, decomposition temperatures, specific heats and thermal stabilities were analyzed. While the melting points of the mixed nitrate/carbonate salts were maintained at 394.7°C, the melting points of the mixed hydroxide/carbonate salts were reduced to 323.2°C. Also the initial crystallization temperature of the mixed hydroxide/carbonate salts was dependent on their composition. Among the hydroxide-mixed molten salts, there are six samples with lower initial crystallization temperature. The decomposition temperature of the selected six samples was nearly 800°C. Their specific heats were fitted with the quadratic polynomial of the temperature and their thermal stability was shown by the excellent repeatability of five heating curves. Only the very first heating curves showed that the initial measured value of a melting point was higher than all the later values of the molten salts due to starting with the powder. Furthermore, possible issues that arise with the addition of NaOH are discussed.

Abstract: We study solar cell properties of single silicon wires connected at their ends to two dissimilar metals of different work functions. Effects of wire dimensions, the work functions of the metals, and minority carrier lifetimes on short circuit current as well as open circuit voltage are studied. The most efficient photovoltaic behavior is found to occur when one metal makes a Schottky contact with the wire, and the other makes an Ohmic contact. As wire length increases, both short circuit current and open circuit voltage increase before saturation occurs. Depending on the work function difference between the metals and the wire dimensions, the saturation length increases by approximately an order of magnitude with a two order magnitude increase in minority carrier length. However current per surface area exposed to light is found to decrease rapidly with increase in length. The use of a multi-contact interdigitated design for long wires is investigated to increase the photovoltaic response of the devices.

Abstract: Regenerative mechanisms that regulate intramuscular motor innervation are thought to reside in the spatiotemporal expression of axon-guidance molecules. Our previous studies proposed a heretofore unexplored role of resident myogenic stem cell (satellite cell)-derived myoblasts as a key presenter of a secreted neural chemorepellent semaphorin 3A (Sema3A); hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) triggered its expression exclusively at the early-differentiation phase. In order to verify this concept, the present study was designed to clarify a paracrine source of HGF release. In vitro experiments demonstrated that activated anti-inflammatory macrophages (CD206-positive M2) produce HGF and thereby promote myoblast chemoattraction and Sema3A expression. Media from pro-inflammatory macrophage cultures (M1) did not show any significant effect. M2 also enhanced the expression of myoblast-differentiation markers in culture, and infiltrated predominantly at the early-differentiation phase (3–5 days post-injury); M2 were confirmed to produce HGF as monitored by in vivo/ex vivo immunocytochemistry of CD11b/CD206/HGF-positive cells and by HGF in situ hybridization of cardiotoxin- or crush-injured tibialis anterior muscle, respectively. These studies advance our understanding of the stage-specific activation of Sema3A expression signaling. Findings, therefore, encourage the idea that M2 contribute to spatiotemporal up-regulation of extracellular Sema3A concentrations by producing HGF that, in turn, stimulates a burst of Sema3A secretion by myoblasts that are recruited to site of injury. This model may ensure a coordinated delay in re-attachment of motoneuron terminals onto damaged fibers early in muscle regeneration, and thus synchronize the recovery of muscle-fiber integrity and the early resolution of inflammation after injury.

Abstract: Ag grid and indium tin oxide (ITO) nanoparticles were assembled by electrohydrodynamic (EHD) jet-printing and brush-painting to realize high-quality printable, transparent conductive electrodes. Effective embedment of an EHD jet-printed Ag grid with a line width of 7.5μm in brush-painted ITO nanoparticles led to an invisible Ag grid/ITO hybrid electrode with a resistivity of 4.20×10−5Ω-cm and an optical transmittance of 83.72% at the optimized Ag grid pitch of 300μm. Increased carrier concentration supplied by the EHD jet-printed Ag grid reduced the resistivity of Ag grid/ITO hybrid electrodes compared to that of metallic electrodes. The good match between calculated and measured figure of merit values based on the filling factor (fF) indicated that embedment of an EHD jet-printed Ag grid in brush-painted ITO nanoparticle is an effective approach to obtain high quality printable transparent electrodes for use in all-printable optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: Electroluminescence and photoluminescence imaging provide spatially resolved lifetime information of solar cells with short measurement time. Its high resolution feature validates good visualization of local defects. However, the luminescence image for finished cells is a 2-dimensional image. An extension to 3-dimensional image should be included. This paper proposed a fast technique for separating front and bulk effects. “Front” in this paper refers to front surface, emitter and junction. Its quality can be varied a lot during processing and it is a most interesting region for most of the cells. Experimental results show that the method achieved a clear separation for various cells. It helped to optimize the cell processing and developing techniques. Therefore, it could become a popular characterization technique in the laboratory based on its fast, reliable and 3-demensional spatially resolved features.

Abstract: The factors affecting the optical properties of a cool, brown coating were systematically investigated using a UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer to optimize its solar reflectance. Zinc iron chromite brown is a partially near infrared (NIR) transmitting colorant. Over bare substrates, the NIR and solar reflectances of the coatings generally but not always increase when the reflectance of the substrates increases; the roughness of the substrate surface lowers both values. When applied over reflective white basecoats, the NIR and solar reflectances of the coatings increase as the basecoats thicken and saturate above a threshold value. The NIR reflectance and solar reflectance of the cool brown coating system also decrease as the topcoat thickness and the pigment concentration increase. The computed absorptance of the films containing only an acrylic emulsion and zinc iron chromite brown increases as the pigment concentration and film thickness increase.

Abstract: Lumisterol3 (L3) is produced by photochemical transformation of 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) during exposure to high doses of ultraviolet B radiation. It has been assumed that L3 is biologically inactive and is not metabolized in the body. However, some synthetic derivatives of L3 display biological activity. The aim of this study was to test the ability of CYP11A1 to metabolize L3. Incubation of L3 with bovine or human CYP11A1 resulted in the formation of three major and a number of minor products. The catalytic efficiency of bovine CYP11A1 for metabolism of L3 dissolved in 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin was approximately 20% of that reported for vitamin D3 and cholesterol. The structures of the three major products were identified as 24-hydroxy-L3, 22-hydroxy-L3 and 20,22-dihydroxy-L3 by NMR. 22-Hydroxy-L3 was further metabolized by bovine CYP11A1 to 20,22-dihydroxy-L3. Both 22-hydroxy-L3 and 20,22-dihydroxy-L3 gave rise to a minor metabolite identified from authentic standard and mass spectrometry as pregnalumisterol (pL) (product of C20–C22 side chain cleavage of L3) and two trihydroxy-L3 products. The capability of tissues expressing CYP11A1 to metabolize L3 was demonstrated using pig adrenal fragments where 20,22-dihydroxy-L3, 22-hydroxy-L3, 24-hydroxy-L3 and pL were detected by LC/MS. Thus, we have established that L3 is metabolized by CYP11A1 to 22- and 24-hydroxy-L3 and 20,22-dihydroxy-L3 as major products, as well as to pL and other minor products. The previously reported biological activity of pL and the presence of CYP11A1 in skin suggest that this pathway may serve to produce biologically active products from L3, emphasizing a novel role of CYP11A1 in sterol metabolism.

Abstract: Gelatin-based solid electrolyte (GSE) has been prepared, characterized and successfully applied to a small electrochromic device (ECD). The gelatin was cross-linked with formaldehyde, plasticized with glycerol and contained different quantities from LiClO4 or LiCl. The physical properties of these membranes were studied by impedance spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis, mechanical test and UV–visible spectrophotometry. The XRD results indicated that all membranes are predominantly amorphous with some localized ordering. The DSC results proved that the samples exhibited high stability with low glass transition temperature of −100°C. The ionic conductivity showed highest values of 1.04×10−4S/cm at 13wt% LiClO4 and 2.02×10−4S/cm at 10wt% LiCl, which is attributed to increase of the number of charge carriers. Results of ionic conductivity/temperature measurements fitted linearly to VTF behavior, independent of salt contents, indicating contribution of polymeric chain movement to ionic transport of Li+. Low values of activation energy, namely, 9.37 and 6.31kJ/mol have been deduced for samples containing LiClO4 and LiCl, respectively, which showed highest conductivities. In addition, the activation energy dropped from 11.57 to 6.31kJ/mol as the LiCl contents increased from 4 to 10wt%. Mechanical investigation showed that addition of Li salts enhanced noticeably the membrane elasticity which improved polymeric chains movement with subsequent increase of Li ions transport. At λ<280nm, the membranes exhibited ~90% transmittance. Membranes possessing highest conductivity combined with high transparency and showing good adhesion to both counter and working electrodes were assembled in a smart window device of configuration (glass/FTO/NiO/GSE/WO3/FTO/glass). The device has been characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA), and showed good performance and stability in cycling between coloring and bleached states at (±2V). It showed transmittance change of 38% at λ=600nm, response time 60s, inserted charge −35mC/cm2 and a coloration efficiency of 23cm2/C. The obtained results of mechanical, ionic conductivity, adhesion to electrodes and high transmittance properties in combination with the performance of the assembled device indicate that GSE is promising for electrochromic smart window application.

Abstract: The stability of normal and inverted organic solar cells is investigated under a highly damp condition (90% relative humidity) in air. For fair comparison, both cells are fabricated not only with the same active layers but also with the same interfacial and electrode layers. The experimental results indicate that the inverted cells do outlive the normal cells and that the top electrode/interfacial layer is a vulnerable component that affects the life time most significantly. Furthermore, inverted cells are shown to have a degradation trend that differs significantly from that of the normal cells: the former have a voltage-dominant degradation due to the change in the work function of the metal oxide-based anodic interfacial layers; and the latter have a current-dominant degradation associated with the formation of bubble-like features. Based on the causes of degradation, methods for avoiding or delaying the observed degradations are proposed and tested for each type of cells. 28 (1.4) fold enhancement in T80-lifetime is achieved for inverted (normal) cells with the proposed method.

Abstract: Alternative metal phthalocyanine (m-Pc) donors employed in mixed layer organic solar cells (OSCs) are shown to have impressive photovoltaic parameters when compared to the traditional and well-studied copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) and zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) donors. In this work, we employ a mixed layer OSC with substantially different donor-to-acceptor mixing ratios to study a wide set of m-Pc donors. The different m-Pc donors are thus studied in consideration of their intrinsic physical properties, such as the valency of their central moiety and their molecular energy levels. The non-traditional m-Pc donors are better suited when employed in Schottky OSCs with high acceptor content, allowing for improvements to all major photovoltaic parameters. In contrast, traditional m-Pc donors suffer from unavoidable charge accumulation and recombination effects in the Schottky device architecture, and are instead optimized with the standard 1-to-1 donor-to-acceptor bulk heterojunction architecture. External quantum efficiency measurements show that optimization of short circuit current density requires balancing photocurrent contributions from the m-Pc absorption and the fullerene aggregate absorption, which is accomplished by control of the donor-to-acceptor mixing ratio. Chloroindium phthalocyanine (ClInPc):C60 OSCs are shown to be capable of near-IR absorption, promising power conversion efficiencies and open circuit voltages in excess of 1V.

Abstract: We measure saturation current densities down to J0=80fA/cm2 for organic-silicon heterojunctions with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as an organic layer. This remarkably low J0 value corresponds to implied open-circuit voltages around 690mV, demonstrating the high-efficiency potential of this novel junction type. However, experimentally realized organic-silicon heterojunction solar cells showed relatively moderate efficiencies so far, typically below 12%. We demonstrate in this study that these solar cells were limited by the fact that the organic-silicon junction was localized on the cell front, resulting in a significant parasitic light absorption within the PEDOT:PSS layer. In addition, the rear surface of these front-junction solar cells was either poorly passivated or not passivated at all. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by proposing a back-junction organic-silicon solar cell, the so-called “BackPEDOT” cell. We show that placing PEDOT:PSS on the rear side instead of the front surface avoids parasitic light absorption within the PEDOT:PSS and allows for an improved surface passivation. We fabricate and characterize BackPEDOT solar cells and achieve very high open-circuit voltages of up to 663mV and short-circuit current densities of up to 39.7mA/cm2. Despite the relatively high series resistances of our first BackPEDOT cells, we achieve an energy conversion efficiency of 17.4%. The measured pseudo efficiency of the best cell of 21.2% suggests that our novel BackPEDOT cell concept is indeed suitable for easy-to-fabricate high-efficiency solar cells after some further optimization to reduce the contact resistance between the PEDOT and the n-type silicon wafer. Based on realistic assumptions we conclude that Back PEDOT cells have an efficiency potential exceeding 22%.

Abstract: Material properties of hydrogenated silicon n-layer and their impact on amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) solar cell are studied. By optimizing deposition parameters, mixed-phase n-layer with nanometer-sized Si crystallites embedded in a-Si:H matrix can be obtained, which demonstrates higher conductivity, lower activation energy and wider bandgap. Incorporating the mixed-phase n-layer into a-Si:H cell can significantly improve the open circuit voltage (Voc) up to 0.95V, which is approximately 50mV or 100mV higher than those cells with a-Si:H n-layer or microcrystalline silicon n-layer, respectively. The possible explanations of Voc enhancement brought by the mixed-phase n-layer have also been discussed. Up to now, we have achieved an initial efficiency of 9.4% with high Voc of 0.945V, FF of 0.70 and Jsc of 14.2mA/cm2 with a-Si:H i-layer thickness of 300nm and substrate temperature as high as 220°C.

Abstract: In this paper we demonstrate the use of self-assembled monolayer modified indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode in bulk heterojunction solar cell structure based on a photoactive layer of poly(3-hexylthiophene) and [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PC61BM). The device studies show that there is a significant enhancement in the short-circuit current as well as in the shunt resistance on use of the hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) layer. The enhancement in short-circuit current density is attributed to the good contact formed between the organic materials and the methyl groups of HMDS. A significant improvement in the external quantum efficiency is also observed in case of the HMDS modified ITO based solar cells.

Abstract: The most commonly used hole transporting layer (HTL) in conventional polymer solar cells is poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)poly(styrenesulfonate) PEDOT:PSS. The acidic nature of this HTL is responsible for etching of the indium tin oxide (ITO) layer which is the anode in polymer solar cells and leads to degradation of efficiency in polymer solar cells in the long run. In this article we explored the effect of plasma treated Ag as an intermediate layer between ITO and PEDOT:PSS for over one month period. It was found that the devices with plasma treated Ag as an intermediate layer with thickness of 5nm resulted in only 30% degradation over one month and did not decrease the initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) compared to the cell without the anode modification, whereas the devices without the intermediate layer, degraded up to 66% of the initial PCE. The mechanism was analyzed using XPS measurements and found out that indium from ITO etches out and diffuses to the subsequent polymer layer. Further, the experiment revealed that the presence of plasma treated Ag layer restricted the rapid indium diffusion, which accounted to enhanced device stability.

Abstract: For attaining the commercialization, the large-area roll-to-roll (R2R) slot-die-coated inverted polymer solar cells (PSCs) would be promising. The electron transport layer (ETL) plays an important role in scale-up development from small PSCs. In this work, the active layer comprising poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and sol–gel zinc oxide (ZnO) ETL were slot-die coated on flexible PET/ITO substrate as reference based on the R2R process. Aluminum-doped ZnO (AZO) instead of ZnO was also adopted. For further improving the performance of large-area PSC, we used polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE) material to tailor the nanostructure of ZnO and AZO ETLs for reducing the surface traps on ETLs using two approaches: (1) ZnO/PEIE bilayer formed by sequential deposition and (2) ZnO:PEIE hybrid composite as ETLs. The present work would demonstrate the optimum material (fabrication) parameters and how the performance of the R2R large-area slot-die coated PSC can be improved by modifying the ZnO- and AZO-based ETL structures. We also perform the various measurements and structural characterization to understand the relationship among R2R slot-die coating process, charge transport properties, film structure and photovoltaic performance as increasing the device areas from 1×0.3cm2 (power conversion efficiency: 2.69%) to 1×1cm2.

Abstract: Organic solar cells (OSCs) using thermally evaporated Ag thin films as the transparent anode are investigated with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) films as the active layer. The optimal power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.57% is obtained for the device with the 11nm thick Ag layer, namely the percolation threshold of Ag. Then an interlayer of MoO3 between the Ag anode and glass substrate is introduced. Two different thicknesses of MoO3 (2nm or 10nm) are chosen here, corresponding to the unclosed or closed MoO3 layer, respectively. It is observed that the introduction of the MoO3 interlayer can effectively improve the wetting of Ag on the substrate and reduce the percolation threshold of Ag. When the MoO3 thickness is 10nm, since the surface energy of Ag (γ=1.25Jm−2) is higher than that of MoO3 (γ=0.06Jm−2), the Ag–Ag interactions are stronger than the Ag-substrate interactions, weakening the surface-modifying effect. In contrast, since the 2nm thick unclosed MoO3 layer may create preferred nucleation sites on the substrate to enhance the lateral growth of Ag film effectively, a very low sheet resistance of 9.32 Ω/□ and a relatively high transmittance are obtained for MoO3 (2 nm)/Ag (9 nm) anode. The PCE of corresponding OSCs can be improved to 2.71%, comparable to that of ITO-based reference OSCs (PCE of 2.85%). From our results, it is concluded that the performance of the Ag thin film electrode can be improved by decreasing the percolation threshold of Ag with a MoO3 interlayer (especially when the MoO3 layer is thin). It may be instructive for the further research of metal thin film electrodes.

Abstract: Worldwide attention has been paid to high temperature phase change materials (PCMs) utilized in latent heat storage systems such as solar thermal power generation or industrial waste heat recovery. Current high temperature PCMs on basis of molten salts are suffering from inherent low thermal conductivity, which is detrimental to heat release rate and systematically thermal efficiency. Metal materials, always possessing ultrahigh thermal conductivity and satisfied heat fusion, are highly suitable as PCMs. However, the development of metal-based PCMs must overcome the package problem, namely, packing active, high temperature liquid metal into durable container. In this paper, copper capsules coated with refractory metallic shells were proposed as a novel metal PCM, which could work at temperature up to 1000°C. Copper spheres with diameter of millimeters were encapsulated with a thick chromium–nickel bilayer by a novel chromium periodic-barrel electroplating method and nickel barrel-plating method. The latent heat density of as-prepared capsules is up to 75% of the theoretical value (about 71J/g) at the melting temperature of 1077°C and the thermal resistance of chromium–nickel layer is 8.27×10−6m2k/w. Particularly, copper capsules could endure 1000 charge–discharge thermal cycles from 1050°C to 1150°C without any leakage. The structure investigations reveal the excellent oxidation resistance of capsules and good stability between copper and chromium–nickel layer, even after long-term charge–discharge cycles. The results demonstrate that as-prepared copper capsules are applicable as high temperature PCMs which can facilitate high temperature thermal energy storage systems.

Abstract: Mixed molten salt is considered as a promising medium for both heat transfer and energy storage in solar thermal power because of its many advantages such as large heat capacity, low vapor pressure, low cost, wide range of temperature in application, etc. In order to obtain molten salt with lower melting point and higher decomposition temperature, a new kind of nitrate was prepared based on different mixing ratios of KNO3–NaNO3–LiNO3–Ca(NO3)2·4H2O. Experimental results show that the melting point of some molten salts can be down to below 90°C with their decomposition temperature above 600°C. The new kind of mixed molten salts has a lower melting point and wider usable temperature range. In addition, other thermal properties such as latent heat of melting, specific heat, density, viscosity, thermal conductivity and thermal stability are measured and analyzed, which are also not worse than that of commonly used mixed molten salt. Therefore, it is a promising medium for both heat transfer and energy storage in solar thermal power plants.

Abstract: This work presents the evolution from fundamental single wire sawing experiments using structured wire for the first time to the introduction of this wire in multi-crystalline silicon wafer mass production. It is shown that via single wire experiments 100% higher throughput and more than 10% less specific energy consumption were foreseen for the replacement of straight with structured wire in mass production of multi-crystalline silicon wafers. The analysis of production data demonstrates that these predictions were even exceeded and that additionally, 45% less wire consumption and 40% less slurry consumption were achieved. This work reveals the influence on wafer metrology and gives a basic description of the dynamics in the cutting slot.

Abstract: Nanotextured Ag/Al:Si back reflectors with enhanced light-scattering efficiency for flexible thin-film solar cells were developed at a low substrate temperature (Ts) by sophisticated control of the microstructural evolution of metal films. Development was based on a structure zone model and a bilayer concept involving a high reflectivity Ag top layer deposited onto a surface-textured Al:Si bottom layer. The texture evolution with a root-mean-square (σrms) surface roughness of 60.1nm in the Al:Si bottom layer was successfully achieved at a low Ts of 100°C by abnormal grain growth. The growth was induced by the low melting point of Al and the impurity drag effect on the grain boundaries caused by the Si dopant, whereas the σrms of the pure Ag film deposited at Ts=200°C was 46.9nm. After room temperature deposition of highly reflective Ag films onto the nanotextured Al:Si bottom layers, significant improvement in the light-scattering properties of the Ag/Al:Si bilayers was obtained compared to the Al:Si films without Ag films, for which the reflection significantly decreased due to the interband absorption and low reflectivity of Al. Under optimum conditions, the light-scattering efficiency of nanotextured Ag/Al:Si bilayers deposited at Ts=75°C is comparable to that of reference Ag films at Ts=200°C. When the nanotextured Ag/Al:Si bilayers deposited at Ts=75°C as back reflectors were applied to flexible nc-Si:H thin-film solar cells, a high conversion efficiency of 8.6% was successfully achieved, and no detrimental reduction in cell performance was observed in comparison with the solar cell using the reference Ag back reflectors deposited at 200°C.

Abstract: Quaternary chalcogenide Cu2SnZnS4 (CZTS) thin films were synthesized onto Mo-coated glass substrates using electrochemical deposition with different triangle wave pulse times (τ). The effects of the triangle wave pulse time on the structural, morphological, chemical and optical properties of the CZTS thin films were investigated. X-ray diffraction showed that the as-grown CZTS thin films are single phase, with a kesterite structure, strong preferential orientation along the (112) plane and a crystal size ranging from 23 to 36nm. FESEM images show that homogeneous, smooth, uniform, and densely packed grains could be formed, although the grain size and surface roughness depended on the triangle wave pulse time. UV–vis spectroscopy showed that the CZTS film had an optical absorption coefficient over 104cm−1 in the visible region and optical band gaps of the various films ranged from 1.36 to 1.47eV, suggesting that CZTS films can be useful absorbent layers in thin film solar cells. Solar cells were fabricated with SLG/Mo/CZTS/CdS/ZnO/ITO structures, and the best conversion efficiency obtained was 1.66% with Voc=571mV, FF=40.4 and Jsc=7.22mA/cm2.

Abstract: Accumulated evidence points to a key role for endocannabinoids in cell migration, and here we sought to characterize the role of these substances in early events that modulate communication between endothelial cells and leukocytes. We found that 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) was able to initiate and complete the leukocyte adhesion cascade, by modulating the expression of selectins. A short exposure of primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to 2-AG was sufficient to prime them towards an activated state: within 1h of treatment, endothelial cells showed time-dependent plasma membrane expression of P- and E-selectins, which both trigger the initial steps (i.e., capture and rolling) of leukocyte adhesion. The effect of 2-AG was mediated by CB1 and CB2 receptors and was long lasting, because endothelial cells incubated with 2-AG for 1h released the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) for up to 24h. Consistently, TNF-α-containing medium was able to promote leukocyte recruitment: human Jurkat T cells grown in conditioned medium derived from 2-AG-treated HUVECs showed enhanced L-selectin and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL1) expression, as well as increased efficiency of adhesion and trans-migration. In conclusion, our in vitro data indicate that 2-AG, by acting on endothelial cells, might indirectly promote leukocyte recruitment, thus representing a potential therapeutic target for treatment of diseases where impaired endothelium/leukocyte interactions take place.

Abstract: We present a method for converting photoluminescence images into carrier lifetime images for silicon wafers with inhomogeneous lifetime distributions, such as multi-crystalline silicon wafers, based on a calibration factor extracted from a separate, homogeneous, mono-crystalline calibration wafer and simple optical modelling of the photoluminescence signal from both the calibration wafer and the test wafer. The method is applicable to planar wafers with uniform carrier profiles depth-wise. A multi-crystalline wafer is used to demonstrate the difference between the conventional calibration approach, where the photoluminescence signal is calibrated against a quasi-steady-state photoconductance measurement on the test sample itself, and our proposed method. The lifetimes calibrated by our method are consistent, in contrast with the lifetime calibrated by the conventional approach, in which the magnitude and injection-dependence of the lifetime is observed to be sensitive to the choice of reference area. The error in the conventional calibration method mainly originates from measurement artifacts in the quasi-steady-state photoconductance measurements on multi-crystalline wafers, which we propose to be mainly due to minority carrier trapping, radial sensitivity of the quasi-steady-state photoconductance sensor coil and overestimation of the carrier mobility sum. We also show that the proposed new method is effectively insensitive to the lifetime, doping density, reflectance and wafer thickness of the calibration wafer (provided it is below 500µm).

Abstract: An effective energy level regulation of acceptor by doping samarium phosphate nanophosphors (SmPO4 NPs) was reported for inorganic/organic hybrid solar cell applications. SmPO4 NPs doped TiO2/P3HT bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cell shows an enhanced power conversion efficiency of approaching 3% as compared with that of its counterpart without SmPO4 NPs (1.98%). The underlying photophysical mechanism was probed by applying femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and the results show that the efficiency enhancement was ascribed to the improved hot electron, less energetic electron, hole transports at the interface of BHJ apart from down-conversion photoluminescence of SmPO4 NPs. It has been evidenced that the hot electron transfer life time was shortened by more than 40% (i.e., from τhot-e=30.2 to 17.9ps) than pure TiO2 acceptor while the hole transfer lifetime was boosted by almost 20% (i.e., from 6.92 to 5.58ns). Such charge carrier improvements stem from the efficient energy level regulations by SmPO4 NPs. In detail, the conduction band (CB) edge of TiO2 has been elevated by 0.57eV while the valence band (VB) edge has been elevated by 0.32eV, thus not only narrowing down the energy offset between CB energy levels of acceptor TiO2 and donor P3HT, but also meanwhile enlarging the band gap of TiO2 itself that permits to inhibit electron-hole recombination within TiO2. This work demonstrates that samarium ions can efficiently facilitate exciton generation, dissociation and charge transport and have an important role in enhancing photovoltaic performance.

Abstract: Thin-film silicon-based solar cells are a well-established photovoltaic (PV) technology. The best reported initial and stabilized conversion efficiency is 16.3% and 13.4%, respectively. Thin-film silicon PV technology needs to achieve initial conversion efficiency approaching 20% in order to stay competitive with other PV technologies. The multi-junction approach is regarded as the main strategy for improving cells efficiency. In this contribution, we study thin-film silicon-based solar cells based on a quadruple junction device and discuss their potential for achieving a high efficiency. We carried out optical modelling of this novel device structure using state-of-the-art materials and light management techniques. We demonstrate a quadruple junction cell with simulated photo-generated current density of 8.7mA/cm2 in current-matching condition and potential initial conversion efficiency of 19.6%. A significant spectral overlap is observed between the component cells that makes the design of the current-matched device complex. We can control the spectral overlap by employing band-gap engineering of absorber layers and design an improved current-matched quadruple junction solar cell with potential initial conversion efficiency equal to 19.8%.

Abstract: Cu(In,Ga)S2nanopowder was printed on Mo-coated sodalime glass substrates and selenized from a Se-coated cover glass. The selenized Cu(In,Ga)(Se,S)2 film consisted of three layers with a different morphologies and micro-structures. Although the top layer showed large grains recrystallized from nanocrystals, the bottom layer was almost identical to the original precursor. The middle layer, as a thin boundary layer was found to be a mixture of carbon and Cu sulfoselenide. At a higher Se thickness (>1.2μm), a lower fill factor and short circuit current density were obtained, which might result from the accumulation of a Cu secondary phase. The solar cell, which consisted of Al2O3:ZnO/i-ZnO/CdS/Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)/Mo/glass using the selenized absorber, showed the following properties: efficiency=8.28%, Jsc=26.14mA/cm2, Voc=0.483V, and fill factor=65.58% for AMG1.5 at 25°C.

Abstract: In this work, p-type solar-grade Si (100) wafers with a thickness of 180μm were used to fabricate Al-doped ZnO(AZO)/n-type Si:H/i-Si:H/c-Si(p) nanowire (NW) array solar cells in which the Si:H and Al2O3 layers were deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical deposition and atomic layer deposition, respectively. To realize a good coverage of Si:H layers on the Si NWs, excessively thin Si:H layers were avoided. Moreover, since the NW array gives rise to significant light trapping, the light absorption by the Si:H layers could not be neglected. It is known that compared to amorphous Si:H, the charge mobility and light absorption are improved in the two-phase Si:H with nanocrystalline grains dispersed in the amorphous matrix. Therefore, it is important to investigate the influence of the microstructures of n-type Si:H on the performance of solar cells. On the other hand, in contrast to the Al2O3 passivation of planar Si solar cells, in this study, ultrathin Al2O3 layers were deposited on Si NWs without post-deposition annealing. We also discuss the passivation behavior of these ultrathin Al2O3 layers on n-type Si:H and the balance between the surface passivation and the role of these layers as tunnel barriers.

Abstract: Accurate characterization and reporting of organic photovoltaic (OPV) device performance remains one of the important challenges in the field. The large spread among the efficiencies of devices with the same structure reported by different groups is significantly caused by different procedures and equipment used during testing. The presented article addresses this issue by offering a new method of device testing using “suitcase sample” approach combined with outdoor testing that limits the diversity of the equipment, and a strict measurement protocol. A round robin outdoor characterization of roll-to-roll coated OPV cells and modules conducted among 46 laboratories worldwide is presented, where the samples and the testing equipment were integrated in a compact suitcase that served both as a sample transportation tool and as a holder and test equipment during testing. In addition, an internet based coordination was used via plasticphotovoltaics.org that allowed fast and efficient communication among participants and provided a controlled reporting format for the results that eased the analysis of the data. The reported deviations among the laboratories were limited to 5% when compared to the Si reference device integrated in the suitcase and were up to 8% when calculated using the local irradiance data. Therefore, this method offers a fast, cheap and efficient tool for sample sharing and testing that allows conducting outdoor measurements of OPV devices in a reproducible manner.

Abstract: A functionally graded Al-doped ZnO structure is presented which combines conductivity, visible transparency and light scattering with mechanical flexibility. The nano- and meso-architectures, constituted by a hierarchical, large surface area, mesoporous tree-like structure evolving in a compact layer, are synthesized at room temperature and are fully compatible with plastic substrates. Light trapping capability is demonstrated by showing up to 100% improvement of light absorption of a low bandgap polymer employed as the active layer.

Abstract: We present the electroluminescence and quantum efficiency of three different types of thin-film solar cells based on absorbers made from Cu(In,Ga)Se2 as well as from μc-Si:H and a-Si:H. Simulations of our experimental results show that the main contribution to the electroluminescence spectrum originates from band-to-tail transitions in the case of Cu(In,Ga)Se2, from tail-to-tail transitions in μc-Si:H, and from tail-to-tail as well as from band-to-midgap-defect transitions in a-Si:H. By comparing the electroluminescence with the quantum efficiency, we analyze the effect of localized states on the optoelectronic reciprocity relation in the three material systems. The relatively steep band–tail density of states in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 is compatible with the reciprocity relation at room temperature while the shallower band–tail density of states in μc-Si:H and the deep mid-gap defect states in a-Si:H lead to substantial deviations from the reciprocity.

Abstract: Wide experimental evidence of the phosphorus diffusion gettering beneficial effect on solar grade silicon is found by measuring electron effective lifetime and interstitial iron concentration in as-grown and post-processed samples from two ingots of upgraded metallurgical grade silicon produced by Ferrosolar. Results after two different P-diffusion processes are compared: P emitter diffusion at 850°C followed by fast cool-down (called “standard process”) or followed by slow cool-down (called “extended process”). It is shown that final lifetimes of this low cost material are in the range of those obtained with conventional material. The extended process can be beneficial for wafers with specific initial distribution and concentration of iron, e.g. materials with high concentration of big Fe precipitates, while for other cases the standard process is enough efficient. An analysis based on the comparison of measured lifetime and dissolved iron concentration with theoretical calculations helps to infer the initial iron distribution and concentration, and according to that, choose the more effective type of gettering.

Abstract: Introduction
Synovial sarcoma (SynSa) is an aggressive mesenchymal tumor, comprising approximately 10% of all soft tissue sarcomas. Over half of SynSa patients develop metastasis or local recurrence, but the underlying molecular mechanisms of the aggressive clinical behavior remain poorly characterized.
Materials and methods
Sixty-four frozen tumor specimens from 54 SynSa patients were subjected to array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and gene expression profiling. The examined set of tumor specimens included 16 primary tumors from untreated patients who did not develop metastasis/local recurrence (SynSa1 group), 26 primary tumors from untreated patients who developed metastases or local recurrence during follow-up (SynSa2 group), and 22 metachronous metastatic/recurrent SynSa tumors (SynSa3 group).
Results
AURKA and KIF18A, which play important roles in various mitotic events, were the two most up-regulated genes in SynSa2 and SynSa3 groups compared to the SynSa1 group. Expression profiles of SynSa2 and SynSa3 tumors did not show any significant differences. Analysis of genomic index (GI) based on aCGH profiles demonstrated that the SynSa1 group consisted of tumors with significantly less complex genomes compared to SynSa2 and SynSa3 groups. There was no significant difference in genome complexity between SynSa2 and SynSa3 tumors.
Conclusions
Primary SynSa tumors from patients who develop metastases or local recurrence share common molecular features with metastatic/recurrent tumors. Presented data suggest that the aggressive clinical SynSa behavior is determined early in tumorigenesis and might be related to impaired regulation of mitotic mechanisms. This article is part of a Directed Issue entitled: Rare Cancers.

Abstract: Focal contacts, large macromolecular complexes that link the extracellular matrix and the internal cell cytoskeleton, are thought to govern cell locomotion. However, the maturation process through which focal contacts control the cellular migratory machinery by changes in size and molecular composition remain unclear. Here, we fabricated cell growth substrates that contained linear ECM strips of micron- or submicron-width in order to limit the enlargement of focal contacts. We found that NBT-II cells plated on the submicron substrate possessed smaller focal complexes that exhibited a highly dynamic turnover. These cells possessed various leading edges at multiple sites of the cell periphery, which prevented the cell from advancing. In contrast, cells grown on the micron-width substrate possessed large and stable focal adhesions. Most of these cells were elongated bipolar cells that were tethered at both ends and were immobile. Further, EGF and ROCK signaling pathways can modulate the cellular migratory responses according to the substrate guidance. On the submicron-width substrate, EGF treatment increased the focal contact size and the contractile force, causing these cells to develop one leading edge and migrate along the submicron-sized ECM paths. In contrast, inhibition of ROCK signaling decreased the focal contact size for cells plated on the micron substrate. These cells became less tethered and were able to migrate along or even across the micron-sized ECM paths. Our results indicate that formation and maturation of focal contacts is controlled by both ECM cues and intracellular signaling and they play a central role in directed cell motion.

Abstract: Mitochondrial morphology is regulated by conserved proteins involved in fusion and fission processes. The mammalian Optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) that functions in mitochondrial fusion is associated with Optic Atrophy and has been implicated in inner membrane cristae remodeling during cell death. Here, we show Drosophila Optic atrophy 1-like (Opa1-like) influences mitochondrial morphology through interaction with ‘mitochondria-shaping’ proteins like Mitochondrial assembly regulatory factor (Marf) and Drosophila Mitofilin (dMitofilin). To gain an insight into Opa1-like's network, we delineated bonafide interactors like dMitofilin, Marf, Serine protease High temperature requirement protein A2 (HTRA2), Rhomboid-7 (Rho-7) along with novel interactors such as Mortalin ortholog (Hsc70-5) from Drosophila mitochondrial extract. Interestingly, RNAi mediated down-regulation of hsc70-5 in Drosophila wing imaginal disc's peripodial cells resulted in fragmented mitochondria with reduced membrane potential leading to proteolysis of Opa1-like. Increased ecdysone activity induced dysfunctional fragmented mitochondria for clearance through lysosomes, an effect enhanced in hsc70-5 RNAi leading to increased cell death. Over-expression of Opa1-like rescues mitochondrial morphology and cell death in prepupal tissues expressing hsc70-5 RNAi. Taken together, we have identified a novel interaction between Hsc70-5/Mortalin and Opa1-like that influences cellular homeostasis through mitochondrial fusion.

Abstract: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is characterized by enhanced pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell (PASMC) proliferation leading to vascular remodeling. Although, multiple factors have been associated with pathogenesis of PH the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we hypothesize that already very short exposure to hypoxia may activate molecular cascades leading to vascular remodeling. Microarray studies from lung homogenates of mice exposed to only 3h of hypoxia revealed endothelin-1 (ET-1) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) as the most upregulated genes, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway as the most differentially regulated pathway. Evaluation of these results in vitro showed that ET-1 but not CTGF stimulation of human PASMCs increased DNA synthesis and expression of proliferation markers such as Ki67 and cell cycle regulator, cyclin D1. Moreover, ET-1 treatment elevated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk)-dependent c-fos expression and phosphorylation of c-fos and c-jun transcription factors. Silencing of c-fos with siRNA abrogated the ET-1-induced proliferation of PASMCs. Expression and immunohistochemical analyses revealed higher levels of total and phosphorylated c-fos and c-jun in the vessel wall of lung samples of human idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension patents, hypoxia-exposed mice and monocrotaline-treated rats as compared to control subjects. These findings shed the light on the involvement of c-fos/c-jun in the proliferative response of PASMCs to ET-1 indicating that already very short hypoxia exposure leads to the regulation of mediators involved in vascular remodeling underlying PH.

Abstract: All previous methods for quantitatively evaluating photoluminescence (PL) images of solar cells assumed a laterally constant short circuit current density Jsc. Moreover, they had to subtract a Jsc PL image from all other PL images for considering the diffusion-limited carriers. Here a more realistic PL evaluation method is introduced, which is based on a recently published alternative model of the illuminated solar cell. In this model an analytic expression is derived by considering the illuminated current as a diffusion process between bulk and the pn-junction and linking the implied voltage in the bulk with the local pn-junction voltage under illumination. This model does not assume a laterally constant Jsc but a constant light absorption rate, and it leads to a prediction of the Jsc distribution solely based on PL imaging results. Moreover, it regards the shadowing of the cell by the busbars and grid lines. This model is applied to the quantitative evaluation of PL images of an industrial multicrystalline silicon solar cell. The resulting series resistance and saturation current density images are compared with that of an established PL evaluation method, and the resulting distribution of Jsc is compared with LBIC results. The results of the new method appear slightly more realistic than that of the old one, since they consider the inhomogeneity of Jsc.

Abstract: Titanium dioxide thin films were deposited by metal–organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) on soda–lime and indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates at 400°C. X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies revealed that the deposited films have a pure anatase phase. Thickness of the film was measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Atomic force microscopy was used to study the morphology of the deposited films. Depth profiling was monitored by using secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS). Cyclic voltammetry indicates that the transport of Li ions in the TiO2 thin film is diffusion limited. Chronoamperometry and its corresponding optical modulation measurements show that the increase of the quantity of inserted charge causes the appearance of two absorption bands, and a blueshift of the TiO2 film absorption edge. The observed optical changes were attributed to band gap broadening.

Abstract: Atomic layer deposition (ALD) was studied for ultra-thin (≤100nm) barrier coating deposition onto organic photovoltaics (OPVs) to enhance device lifetime. Herein, we report the first known investigation of the mechanical characteristics of AlOx encapsulated OPVs using nanoindentation and scratch testing with deposition temperature as a tunable parameter. The higher organic content in the AlOx film, grown at lower temperatures, enhanced the interfacial bonding at the AlOx–OPV interface and provided modulus and hardness performance exceeding that of a common polymer encapsulant. Furthermore, AlOx׳s organic content impeded fracture propagation, confirming the durability enhancement associated with this approach.

Abstract: We present all-solution processed, indium tin oxide-free organic solar cells on mechanically flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates with power conversion efficiencies up to 4.8%. The mechanical properties of the devices are dictated by the electrodes from either metal-organic silver inks or a combination of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate) and silver nanowires. Both electrodes can sustain high tensile strains. The influence of mechanical strain on the solar cell performance was experimentally studied in situ by measuring the J–V curves of elongated samples under illumination. At a strain of 14%, we still observed 90% of the initial device power output. At higher strain, crack formation within the electrodes was identified as the origin for device failure.

Abstract: Lamins are structural components of the nuclear lamina and integral parts of the nucleoplasm. The tripartite domain structure partitions the molecule into an amino-terminal head, central rod and a carboxy-terminal tail domain. The tail domain contains a nuclear localization sequence and in most lamins an additional CaaX motif, which is necessary to post-translationally process prelamin to mature lamin. As players of nuclear and cellular integrity, lamins must possess unrestrained access to the nucleus. To study whether nuclear trafficking of lamins is compromised in laminopathies, we determined relative nuclear import activities between expressed prelamin A and selected laminopathy-inducing mutants thereof. Furthermore, the impact of inhibition of maturation on nuclear import of expressed prelamin A was examined. To perform quantitative transport measurements, import competent but lamina incorporation-deficient GFP- or DsRed-tagged prelamin A deletion mutants were used, which lacked the head and rod domain (ΔHR-prelamin A). Nuclear accumulation of ΔHR-prelamin A carrying the lipodystrophy and metabolic syndrome-inducing mutations R419C and L421P or progeria-causing deletions was significantly reduced, but that of the maturation-deficient mutant ΔHR-prelamin A SSIM was significantly increased. In the case of the full length prelamin A mutants R419C and L421P altered subcellular localization and reduced lamina incorporation were detected, with the prelamin A-binding protein Narf being redistributed into R419-containing aggregates. The results suggest that impaired nuclear transport of certain prelamin A mutants may represent a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of certain laminopathies.

Abstract: Multi-junction (MJ) solar cells show an important dependence on the incident spectrum due to the internal series connection of several cells with different band gap energies. The influence of spectral variations on the performance of HCPV modules or systems is different from that in MJ solar cells since they use optical devices to concentrate the light on the solar cell surface. The spectral distribution of irradiance is affected by atmospheric parameters and changes during the course of day, month or year. Because of this, several authors have done different studies to analyse and quantify the spectral effects on the performance of HCPV modules. However, there are still important issues that have not been addressed. In this paper, a deep analysis of the spectral effects on the performance of different HCPV modules with different multi-junction solar cells and Fresnel lenses on an annual time scale and their study and comparison at locations with different climate conditions is conducted. In order to address this issue, ground-based climatologies at the locations studied, spectra simulations with the SMARTS model and the spectral factor of a HCPV module have been used. Results show that the annual spectral losses vary from 6% to 51% depending on the climate conditions of the location and the HCPV module.

Abstract: The performance of InAs/GaAs quantum dot solar cells was investigated up to an optical concentration of 500-suns. A high temperature spacer layer between successive layers of quantum dots was used to reduce the degradation in the open circuit voltage relative to a control device without quantum dots. This improvement is explained using optical data while structural imaging of quantum dot stacks confirm that the devices are not limited by strain. The evolution of the open circuit voltage as a function of number of suns concentration was observed to be nearly ideal when compared with a high performance single junction GaAs solar cell. Analysis of Suns-Voc measurements reveal diode ideality factors as low as 1.16 which is indicative of a low concentration of defects in the devices.

Abstract: The incorporation of a cationically functionalized fullerene interfacial layer (NMFP-Br) into an inverted poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) bulk heterojunction photovoltaic cell results in a significant power conversion efficiency (PCE) improvement of 67%, from 2.1% to 3.5%, relative to cells without an interfacial layer. The incorporation of NMFP-Br as an ITO modifying interfacial layer results in a 190mV increase in the open-circuit voltage, 13% increase in fill factor, and 250% reduction in series resistance. Cell efficiencies are greater than or comparable to other reported cells based on organic electron injection layers with the same active layer and electrode configuration. The orthogonal solubility afforded by ionic functionality allows for sequential solution phase deposition without the necessity of chemical cross-linking of the fullerene based interfacial layer. Inverted devices incorporating a single phase, ionically functionalized fullerene interfacial layer have not been previously demonstrated. The unusually high conductivity of NMFP-Br films is investigated and shown to be ~3 orders of magnitude higher than PCBM and contributes to the substantial reduction in series resistance.

Abstract: First principles calculations are performed to study the electronic and optical properties of Cu-doped, N-doped and (Cu+2N)-co-doped anatase TiO2. Strong hybridization between Cu 3d and N 2p orbitals above the valence band leads to the formation of an isolated intermediate band (IB) deep in the band gap of pure TiO2. The new energetic features, predicted by DFT, have been experimentally confirmed using UV–vis–NIR spectroscopy. In particular, the diffuse reflectance spectrum of the co-doped TiO2 sample shows the presence of two edges which confirm the existence of IB in the band gap. This IB in the band gap of TiO2 is responsible for high visible light absorption through a two-step optical transition between valence and conduction bands via the IB. In mono-doped samples, only a reduction of the band gap is observed which is consistent with the first-principles calculations. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of mono- and co-doped TiO2 samples establishes the chemical states of several atomic elements and especially clarifies the key presence of O-vacancies leading to a new position of conduction band minima. The presence of broad IB and the absence of dopant energy levels close to the conduction band minimum in (Cu+2N)-co-doped TiO2 qualify it to be an efficient material for photovoltaic conversion, photocatalytic water splitting, and photocatalytic degradation of pollutants.

Abstract: Basic cell penetrating peptides are tools for molecular cellular internalization of nonmembrane permeable molecules. Their uptake mechanisms involve energy-dependent and energy-independent pathways such as endocytosis, direct translocation or physical endocytosis. These mechanisms are ruled by both, the peptides physicochemical properties and structure and by the membrane lipids characteristics and organization. Herein we used plasma membrane spheres and membrane models to study the membrane perturbations induced by three arginine-rich cell penetrating peptides. Nona-arginine (R9) and the amphipathic peptide RWRRWWRRW (RW9) induced positive membrane curvature in the form of buds and membrane tubes. Membranous tubes underwent rolling resulting in formation of multilamellar membrane particles at the surface of the plasma membrane spheres. The amphipathic peptides RW9 and RRWRRWWRRWWRRWRR (RW16) provoked lipid and membrane associated protein domain separation as well as changes in membrane fluidity and cholesterol redistribution. These data suggest that membrane domains separation and the formation of multilamellar membranous particles would be involved in arginine-rich cell penetrating peptides internalization.

Abstract: Separation and quantification of recombination losses in thin-film Cu(In1−xGax)Se2 solar cells is paramount to understanding the current state-of-the-art and future improvements, but an effective characterization technique has been lacking. We use the recently developed temperature–illumination-dependent open-circuit voltage method to extract individual recombination rates at the buffer/absorber interface, in the space-charge region, and in the quasi-neutral region, as well as the carrier lifetime and surface recombination velocity for devices with low (x=30%) and high (x=84%) Ga absorbers. In the low-Ga absorber, recombination in the quasi-neutral region dominates. In the high-Ga absorber, interface recombination dominates. The open-circuit voltage deficit of the high-Ga device originates from an inadequacy of band bending in the absorber and a lack of strong inversion at the buffer/absorber interface. As two promising mitigating strategies for the open-circuit voltage deficit problem at high-Ga levels, we highlight a homojunction in the absorber or alternative transparent conducting oxides with low work function.

Abstract: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most common and fatal form of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), short, single-stranded RNAs that regulate protein expression in a post-transcriptional manner, have recently been demonstrated to contribute to IPF pathogenesis. We have previously identified WNT1-inducible signaling pathway protein 1 (WISP1) as a highly expressed pro-fibrotic mediator in IPF, but the underlying mechanisms resulting in increased WISP1 expression, remain elusive. Here, we investigated whether WISP1 is a target of miRNA regulation. We applied a novel supervised machine learning approach, which predicted miR-30a/d and miR-92a target sites in regions of the human WISP1 3′UTR preferentially bound by the miRNA ribonucleoprotein complex. Both miRNAs were decreased in IPF samples, whereas WISP1 protein was increased. We demonstrated further that transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1-induced WISP1 expression in primary lung fibroblasts in vitro and lung homogenates in vivo. Notably, miR-30a and miR-92a reversed TGF-β1-induced WISP1 mRNA expression in lung fibroblasts. Moreover, miR-92a inhibition increased WISP1 protein expression in lung fibroblasts. An inverse relationship for WISP1 and miR-92a was found in a TGF-β1 dependent lung fibrosis model in vivo. Finally, we found significantly increased WISP1 expression in primary IPF fibroblasts, which negatively correlated with miR-92a level ex vivo. Altogether, our findings indicate a regulatory role of miR-92a for WISP1 expression in pulmonary fibrosis.

Abstract: Spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) is used to study the dependence of the band-gap energy for Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) on temperature ranging from 50 to 350K. A CZTSe thin film prepared by the pseudo-bulk approach allows direct observation of the fundamental band-gap E0(A,B) in the SE data without need for multi-layer modeling. We obtain accurate energy values for E0(A,B) and its spin–orbit splitting component E0(C) from standard lineshape analysis of the second-energy-derivative spectra. The E0(A,B) and E0(C) energies for CZTSe decrease with increasing temperature, as for many semiconductors, but their temperature dependencies are relatively weak. Our experimental observation can be explained in terms of relatively small change in bond-length and strong p–d states coupling at the valence band maximum.

Delphinidin inhibits VEGF induced-mitochondrial biogenesis and Akt activation in endothelial cells,

Abstract: Delphinidin, an anthocyanin present in red wine, has been reported to exert vasculoprotective properties on endothelial cells, including vasorelaxing and anti-apoptotic effects. Moreover, delphinidin treatment in a rat model of post-ischemic neovascularization has been described to exert anti-angiogenic property. Angiogenesis is an energetic process and VEGF-induced angiogenesis is associated with mitochondrial biogenesis. However, whether delphinidin induces changes in mitochondrial biogenesis has never been addressed. Effects of delphinidin were investigated in human endothelial cells at a concentration described to be anti-angiogenic in vitro (10−2g/l). mRNA expression of mitochondrial biogenesis factors, mitochondrial respiration, DNA content and enzyme activities were assessed after 48h of stimulation. Delphinidin increased mRNA expression of several mitochondrial biogenesis factors, including NRF1, ERRα, Tfam, Tfb2m and PolG but did not affect neither mitochondrial respiration, DNA content nor enzyme activities. In presence of delphinidin, VEGF failed to increase mitochondrial respiration, DNA content, complex IV activity and Akt activation in endothelial cells. These results suggest a possible association between inhibition of VEGF-induced mitochondrial biogenesis through Akt pathway by delphinidin and its anti-angiogenic effect, providing a novel mechanism sustaining the beneficial effect of delphinidin against pathologies associated with excessive angiogenesis such as cancers.

Abstract: High blood glucose levels are the main feature of diabetes. However, the underlying mechanism linking high glucose concentration to diabetic complications is still not fully elucidated, particularly with regard to human physiology. Excess of glucose is likely to trigger a metabolic response depending on the cell features, activating deleterious pathways involved in the complications of diabetes. In this study, we aim to elucidate how acute and prolonged hyperglycaemia alters the biology and metabolism in human fibroblasts and endothelial cells. We found that hyperglycaemia triggers a metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis that is maintained over prolonged time. Moreover, osmotic pressure is a major factor in the early metabolic response, decreasing both mitochondrial transmembrane potential and cellular proliferation. After prolonged exposure to hyperglycaemia we observed decreased mitochondrial steady-state and uncoupled respiration, together with a reduced ATP/ADP ratio. At the same time, we could not detect major changes in mitochondrial transmembrane potential and reactive oxygen species. We suggest that the physiological and metabolic alterations observed in healthy human primary fibroblasts and endothelial cells are an adaptive response to hyperglycaemia. The severity of metabolic and bioenergetics impairment associated with diabetic complications may occur after longer glucose exposure or due to interactions with cell types more sensitive to hyperglycaemia.

Abstract: Charge separation is an important elementary step in solar cells with donor/acceptor heterojunctions. In this work, light-induced electron spin resonance (LESR) is used to study the charge transfer and recombination of photo-generated charge carriers in inorganic/organic hybrid composites of CuInS2 nanoparticles with the conjugated polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) or the electron acceptor phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), respectively. After synthesis, the CuInS2 nanoparticles are surrounded by a ligand shell composed of relatively long-chained organic molecules. A ligand shell modification with hexanethiol was applied to the CuInS2 nanoparticles to study the influence of the ligand shell on the charge separation process. The effect of the hexanethiol treatment on the initial ligand shell present after synthesis was analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). We demonstrate that charge transfer in both the CuInS2/P3HT and CuInS2/PCBM composites is possible and in case of P3HT strongly influenced by the ligand shell. The recombination kinetics of photo-generated charge carriers reveals that trapping is especially governed by the organic semiconductor. Laboratory solar cells with CuInS2/P3HT or CuInS2/PCBM as the photoactive layer are presented as well.

Abstract: A simple and effective transparent conducting electrodes (TCEs) based on reduced graphene oxide film embedded with silver nanowire- (AgNW-rGO) was developed. The AgNW-rGO hybrid electrode was fabricated by using a simple and scalable dip-coating method. This solution processed TCEs showed high electrical conductivity when compared with pristine AgNW. AgNW-rGO TCEs also exhibited better stability than the pristine AgNW film when exposed to the ambient atmosphere. The electrical conductivity is found to increase by 4-fold with increase in the number of dipping cycles of AgNW after coating the graphene oxide (GO). This increase in the observed conductivity is attributed to the gas-barrier property of GO. AgNW/rGO TCEs exhibited a sheet resistance of 27Ω/□ with transparency=72% at 550nm.

Abstract: Thin films of yttrium hydride have for almost 20 years been under investigation for optoelectronic and solar energy applications due to the hydrogen-induced switching in electronic state from the metallic elemental yttrium and yttrium dihydride to the transparent semiconductor material yttrium trihydride. In this study, we investigate the electronic structure of yttrium, yttrium hydride and yttrium oxide by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and kelvin probe measurements. The investigated samples have been prepared by reactive sputtering deposition. We show that the electronic work function of transparent yttrium hydride is of 4.76eV and that the recently discovered photochromic reaction lowers the electronic work function of the transparent hydride by 0.2eV.

Abstract: Thermochromic VO2 windows have the potential of managing heat transfer in an efficient way. However, several problems such as a high transition temperature ~68°C and high deposition temperatures (over 400°C) limit their applicability. We present a novel approach for the fabrication of thermochromic VO2 films in which High Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering (HiPIMS) is used for deposition. Indeed, HiPIMS is known for its high ionization degree of sputtered species that allows one to control the evolution of the film microstructure by ion bombardment. The optical and other physical properties of the obtained HiPIMS VO2 coatings are first presented. Based on spectrophotometry, ellipsometry, AFM, SEM, TOF-SIMS, Raman spectroscopy and XRD results, we show that it is possible to deposit dense stoichiometric crystalline VO2 films at lower substrate temperatures (300°C) compared to other approaches. These films exhibit a high infrared modulation (ΔT2500nm of 61% between 30°C and 90°C), low surface roughness (Rrms under 10% of total thickness for films approximately 100nm thick), and lower transition temperatures than the bulk material (Tc down to 50°C for thicker films).

Abstract: Rear side passivation and local back surface field formation are two of the main technological challenges for n-type PERL silicon solar cells. A promising approach is the PassDop process. This process combines a phosphorous doped passivation layer deposited on the rear side with a subsequent laser process to create both a local contact opening as well as a local back surface field. In this paper we introduce a new layer system based on doped amorphous silicon nitride (the fPassDop process) which is able to passivate the n-type surface after a firing step as typically used for screen printed contacts. After the firing step, an effective recombination velocity <5cm/s can be reached with this layer. The measured sheet resistance is in the range of 60Ω/sq after the laser process. In a first test the fPassDop process is applied to small area solar cells achieving a conversion efficiency of 21.3% (675mV Voc). Additionally, we fabricated large area n-type solar cells with screen printed front side contacts achieving 20.1% efficiency and Voc of 668mV.

Abstract: Poly (3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), at six molecular weights varying from 5kDa to 72kDa (Mw), was used to prepare P3HT: phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) nanoparticulate organic photovoltaic (NP OPV) devices and the effect of this variation on device performance is reported. Power conversion efficiency (PCE) is observed to peak for the mid-range of molecular weights tested, this behaviour varies from the trend generally observed with bulk heterojunction (BHJ) devices, where high molecular weight polymers deliver the highest PCEs. Here we demonstrate that polymer molecular weight affects the electronic, morphological and compositional structure of the nanoparticulate film. Significantly, it is the domain composition that is most highly correlated with device performance and this composition is driven by the PCBM mobility and aggregation within the nanoparticulate structure.

Abstract: HDAC inhibitors (HDIs) induce irreversible cell cycle arrest and senescence in E1A+Ras expressing cells. Furthermore, HDIs activate Gadd45α/NF-κB signaling pathway to suppress apoptosis thereby promoting the cell survival. Here, to clarify the role of Gadd45α in realization of the antiapoptotic program, we compared wild-type E1A+Ras cells and the cells with knockout of gadd45α gene (Gadd45α−/− cells). As in Gadd45α-expressing E1A+Ras cells, HDIs induce irreversible cell cycle arrest in Gadd45α−/− cells, but the arrested cells do not senesce and eventually die due to activation of the apoptotic death program. These data suggest that the expression of Gadd45α is involved in maintaining the balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic stimuli, while lack or loss of Gadd45 directs the cells to apoptosis after HDIs treatment. Appropriately Gadd45α-deficient cells demonstrate a higher level of pro-apoptotic signals, whereas the anti-apoptotic program is suppressed. The elevated apoptotic background of Gadd45α−/− cells is accompanied by higher levels of Ser15-phosphorylated p53 and p21/Waf1 proteins that additionally commit the cells to HDIs-induced apoptosis. Additionally, loss of Gadd45α protein activates the DDR signaling pathway as demonstrated by nuclear pATM staining, accumulation of γH2AX foci and an increase of single-strand DNA breaks. Thus, in wild-type E1A+Ras cells the p53-dependent expression of Gadd45α is necessary not only for DNA repair and HDI-induced cellular senescence, but also to withstand to apoptosis after DNA damage and stress. Therefore the use of HDIs in combination with agents that block Gadd45α function may have promise for cancer therapy.

Abstract: Light-induced plating (LIP) as one of alternative metallization technologies has been widely investigated for solar cell metallization, especially for laser-doped selective emitter (LDSE) silicon solar cells. Plating of nickel layer is very crucial in the whole metallization process because nickel is the initial layer on the laser doped area, acting as both contact and barrier layer. The negative effect of poor nickel layer on performance degradation was initially evaluated on LDSE solar cells. Several parameters of light induced nickel plating were then investigated via a laboratory scale plating bath to understand the mechanism of light induced nickel plating directly on the laser doped silicon. Finally, the effect of nickel plating improvement on the performance of large area laser-doped multi-crystalline solar cells was studied via an industrial plating system. By optimization of the applied voltage in the plating nickel, the operation window of laser power was enlarged. At last, an independent confirmed cell efficiency of 17.8% was achieved on large area (243.4cm2) LDSE multi-crystalline silicon.

Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents the major histological subtype of liver cancer. Tumorigenic changes in hepatic cells potentially result from aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs). Individual microRNA gene may give rise to miRNAs of different length, named isomiRNAs that proved to be functionally relevant. Since microRNA length heterogeneity in hepatic tissue has not been described before, we employed next-generation sequencing to comprehensively analyze microRNA transcriptome in HCC tumors (n=24) and unaffected tissue adjacent to tumors (n=24), including samples with (n=15) and without cirrhosis (n=9). We detected 374 microRNAs expressed in liver, including miR-122-5p that constituted over 39% of the hepatic miRnome. Among the liver expressed miRs, the levels of 64 significantly differed between tumor and control samples (FDR<0.05, fold change>2). Top deregulated miRNAs included miR-1269a (T/N=22.95), miR-3144-3p (T/N=5.24), miR-183-5p (T/N=4.63), miR-10b-5p (T/N=3.87), miR-490-3p (T/N=0.13), miR-199a-5p (T/N=0.17), miR-199a-3p/miR-199b-3p (T/N=0.19), miR-214-5p (T/N=0.20) and miR-214-3p (T/N=0.21). Almost all miRNA genes produced several mature molecules differing in length (isomiRNAs). The reference sequence was not the most prevalent in 38.6% and completely absent in 10.5% of isomiRNAs. Over 26.1% of miRNAs produced isoforms carrying≥2 alternative seed regions, of which 35.5% constituted novel, previously unknown seeds. This fact sheds new light on the percentage of the human genome regulated by microRNAs and their variants. Among the most deregulated miRNAs, miR-199a-3p/miR-199b-3p (T/N fold change=0.18, FDR=0.005) was expressed in 9 isoforms with 3 different seeds, concertedly leading to upregulation of TGF-beta signaling pathway (OR=1.99; p=0.004). In conclusion, the study reveals the comprehensive miRNome of hepatic tissue and provides new tools for investigation of microRNA-dependent pathways in cirrhotic liver and hepatocellular carcinoma.
