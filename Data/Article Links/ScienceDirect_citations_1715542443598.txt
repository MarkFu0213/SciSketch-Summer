Abstract: Summary
Tau aggregation into insoluble filaments is the defining pathological hallmark of tauopathies. However, it is not known what controls the formation and templated seeding of strain-specific structures associated with individual tauopathies. Here, we use cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the structures of tau filaments from corticobasal degeneration (CBD) human brain tissue. Cryo-EM and mass spectrometry of tau filaments from CBD reveal that this conformer is heavily decorated with posttranslational modifications (PTMs), enabling us to map PTMs directly onto the structures. By comparing the structures and PTMs of tau filaments from CBD and Alzheimer’s disease, it is found that ubiquitination of tau can mediate inter-protofilament interfaces. We propose a structure-based model in which cross-talk between PTMs influences tau filament structure, contributing to the structural diversity of tauopathy strains. Our approach establishes a framework for further elucidating the relationship between the structures of polymorphic fibrils, including their PTMs, and neurodegenerative disease.

Abstract: Summary
Most bacterial and all archaeal cells are encapsulated by a paracrystalline, protective, and cell-shape-determining proteinaceous surface layer (S-layer). On Gram-negative bacteria, S-layers are anchored to cells via lipopolysaccharide. Here, we report an electron cryomicroscopy structure of the Caulobacter crescentus S-layer bound to the O-antigen of lipopolysaccharide. Using native mass spectrometry and molecular dynamics simulations, we deduce the length of the O-antigen on cells and show how lipopolysaccharide binding and S-layer assembly is regulated by calcium. Finally, we present a near-atomic resolution in situ structure of the complete S-layer using cellular electron cryotomography, showing S-layer arrangement at the tip of the O-antigen. A complete atomic structure of the S-layer shows the power of cellular tomography for in situ structural biology and sheds light on a very abundant class of self-assembling molecules with important roles in prokaryotic physiology with marked potential for synthetic biology and surface-display applications.

Abstract: Summary
Enteric-associated neurons (EANs) are closely associated with immune cells and continuously monitor and modulate homeostatic intestinal functions, including motility and nutrient sensing. Bidirectional interactions between neuronal and immune cells are altered during disease processes such as neurodegeneration or irritable bowel syndrome. We investigated the effects of infection-induced inflammation on intrinsic EANs (iEANs) and the role of intestinal muscularis macrophages (MMs) in this context. Using murine models of enteric infections, we observed long-term gastrointestinal symptoms, including reduced motility and loss of excitatory iEANs, which was mediated by a Nlrp6- and Casp11-dependent mechanism, depended on infection history, and could be reversed by manipulation of the microbiota. MMs responded to luminal infection by upregulating a neuroprotective program via β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) signaling and mediated neuronal protection through an arginase 1-polyamine axis. Our results identify a mechanism of neuronal death post-infection and point to a role for tissue-resident MMs in limiting neuronal damage.

Abstract: Hypoxia plays important roles in cancer progression by inducing angiogenesis, metastasis, and drug resistance. However, the effects of hypoxia on long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) expression have not been clarified. Herein, we evaluated alterations in lncRNA expression in lung cancer cells under hypoxic conditions using lncRNA microarray analyses. Among 40,173 lncRNAs, 211 and 113 lncRNAs were up- and downregulated, respectively, in both A549 and NCI-H460 cells. Uroplakin 1A (UPK1A) and UPK1A-antisense RNA 1 (AS1), which showed the highest upregulation under hypoxic conditions, were selected to investigate the effects of UPK1A-AS1 on the expression of UPK1A and the mechanisms of hypoxia-inducible expression. Following transfection of cells with small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), the hypoxia-induced expression of UPK1A and UPK1A-AS1 was significantly reduced, indicating that HIF-1α played important roles in the hypoxia-induced expression of these targets. After transfection of cells with UPK1A siRNA, UPK1A and UPK1A-AS1 levels were reduced. Moreover, transfection of cells with UPK1A-AS1 siRNA downregulated both UPK1A-AS1 and UPK1A. RNase protection assays demonstrated that UPK1A and UPK1A-AS1 formed a duplex; thus, transfection with UPK1A-AS1 siRNA decreased the RNA stability of UPK1A. Overall, these results indicated that UPK1A and UPK1A-AS1 expression increased under hypoxic conditions in a HIF-1α-dependent manner and that formation of a UPK1A/UPK1A-AS1 duplex affected RNA stability, enabling each molecule to regulate the expression of the other.

Abstract: Summary
Optical tissue transparency permits scalable cellular and molecular investigation of complex tissues in 3D. Adult human organs are particularly challenging to render transparent because of the accumulation of dense and sturdy molecules in decades-aged tissues. To overcome these challenges, we developed SHANEL, a method based on a new tissue permeabilization approach to clear and label stiff human organs. We used SHANEL to render the intact adult human brain and kidney transparent and perform 3D histology with antibodies and dyes in centimeters-depth. Thereby, we revealed structural details of the intact human eye, human thyroid, human kidney, and transgenic pig pancreas at the cellular resolution. Furthermore, we developed a deep learning pipeline to analyze millions of cells in cleared human brain tissues within hours with standard lab computers. Overall, SHANEL is a robust and unbiased technology to chart the cellular and molecular architecture of large intact mammalian organs.

Abstract: Summary
VAMP7 is involved in autophagy and in exocytosis-mediated neurite growth, two yet unconnected cellular pathways. Here, we find that nutrient restriction and activation of autophagy stimulate axonal growth, while autophagy inhibition leads to loss of neuronal polarity. VAMP7 knockout (KO) neuronal cells show impaired neurite growth, whereas this process is increased in autophagy-null ATG5 KO cells. We find that endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-phagy-related LC3-interacting-region-containing proteins Atlastin 3 and Reticulon 3 (RTN3) are more abundant in autophagy-related protein ATG5 KO and less abundant in VAMP7 KO secretomes. Treatment of neuronal cells with ATG5 or VAMP7 KO conditioned medium does not recapitulate the effect of these KOs on neurite growth. A nanobody directed against VAMP7 inhibits axonal overgrowth induced by nutrient restriction. Furthermore, expression of the inhibitory Longin domain of VAMP7 impairs the subcellular localization of RTN3 in neurons. We propose that VAMP7-dependent secretion of RTN3 regulates neurite growth.

Abstract: Summary
Global warming and emerging plant diseases challenge agricultural food/feed production. We identify mechanism(s) regulating both plant thermotolerance and disease resistance. Using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS)-based genetic screening, we identify a thioredoxin-like 1 (TRXL1) gene involved in plant nonhost disease resistance and thermotolerance. TRXL1 is reduced, partly degraded via proteases and proteasome, and alters its chloroplast localization during heat stress. TRXL1 interacts with more than 400 proteins, including chaperonin CPN60A, caseinolytic protease (CLPC1), and NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase (NADP-MDH). Chaperonin 60A (CPN60A) guards TRXL1 from degradation, whereas CLPC1 degrades TRXL1 during heat stress. TRXL1 regulates NADP-MDH activity, leading to an increase in malate level and inhibition of superoxide radical formation. We show that CPN60A and NADP-MDH positively regulate nonhost resistance, and CPN60A positively and CLPC1 negatively regulate thermotolerance. This study shows an antagonistic post-translational regulation of TRXL1 by CPN60A and CLPC1 and regulation of MDH by TRXL1, leading to plant disease resistance and thermotolerance.

Abstract: Summary
We undertook a comprehensive proteogenomic characterization of 95 prospectively collected endometrial carcinomas, comprising 83 endometrioid and 12 serous tumors. This analysis revealed possible new consequences of perturbations to the p53 and Wnt/β-catenin pathways, identified a potential role for circRNAs in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and provided new information about proteomic markers of clinical and genomic tumor subgroups, including relationships to known druggable pathways. An extensive genome-wide acetylation survey yielded insights into regulatory mechanisms linking Wnt signaling and histone acetylation. We also characterized aspects of the tumor immune landscape, including immunogenic alterations, neoantigens, common cancer/testis antigens, and the immune microenvironment, all of which can inform immunotherapy decisions. Collectively, our multi-omic analyses provide a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians, identify new molecular associations of potential mechanistic significance in the development of endometrial cancers, and suggest novel approaches for identifying potential therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Summary
Elucidating the mechanisms that controlled T cell activation requires visualization of the spatial organization of multiple proteins on the submicron scale. Here, we use stoichiometrically accurate, multiplexed, single-molecule super-resolution microscopy (DNA-PAINT) to image the nanoscale spatial architecture of the primary inhibitor of the T cell signaling pathway, Csk, and two binding partners implicated in its membrane association, PAG and TRAF3. Combined with a newly developed co-clustering analysis framework, we find that Csk forms nanoscale clusters proximal to the plasma membrane that are lost post-stimulation and are re-recruited at later time points. Unexpectedly, these clusters do not co-localize with PAG at the membrane but instead provide a ready pool of monomers to downregulate signaling. By generating CRISPR-Cas9 knockout T cells, our data also identify that a major risk factor for autoimmune diseases, the protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22) locus, is essential for Csk nanocluster re-recruitment and for maintenance of the synaptic PAG population.

Abstract: Summary
Calcium (Ca2+) is the primary stimulus for transmembrane protein 16 (TMEM16) Ca2+-activated chloride channels and phospholipid scramblases, which regulate important physiological processes ranging from smooth muscle contraction to blood coagulation and tumor progression. Binding of intracellular Ca2+ to two highly conserved orthosteric binding sites in transmembrane helices (TMs) 6–8 efficiently opens the permeation pathway formed by TMs 3–7. Recent structures of TMEM16K and TMEM16F scramblases revealed an additional Ca2+ binding site between TM2 and TM10, whose functional relevance remains unknown. Here, we report that Ca2+ binds with high affinity to the equivalent third Ca2+ site in TMEM16A to enhance channel activation. Our cadmium (Cd2+) metal bridging experiments reveal that the third Ca2+ site’s conformational states can profoundly influence TMEM16A’s opening. Our study thus confirms the existence of a third Ca2+ site in TMEM16A, defines its functional importance in channel gating, and provides insight into a long-range allosteric gating mechanism of TMEM16 channels and scramblases.

Abstract: Summary
Misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) activate IRE1α endoribonuclease in mammalian cells, which mediates XBP1 mRNA splicing to produce an active transcription factor. This promotes the expression of specific genes to alleviate ER stress, thereby attenuating IRE1α. Although sustained activation of IRE1α is linked to human diseases, it is not clear how IRE1α is attenuated during ER stress. Here, we identify that Sec63 is a subunit of the previously identified IRE1α/Sec61 translocon complex. We find that Sec63 recruits and activates BiP ATPase through its luminal J-domain to bind onto IRE1α. This leads to inhibition of higher-order oligomerization and attenuation of IRE1α RNase activity during prolonged ER stress. In Sec63-deficient cells, IRE1α remains activated for a long period of time despite the presence of excess BiP in the ER. Thus, our data suggest that the Sec61 translocon bridges IRE1α with Sec63/BiP to regulate the dynamics of IRE1α signaling in cells.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy is a conserved catabolic homeostasis process central for cellular and organismal health. During autophagy, small single-membrane phagophores rapidly expand into large double-membrane autophagosomes to encapsulate diverse cargoes for degradation. It is thought that autophagic membranes are mainly derived from preformed organelle membranes. Instead, here we delineate a pathway that expands the phagophore membrane by localized phospholipid synthesis. Specifically, we find that the conserved acyl-CoA synthetase Faa1 accumulates on nucleated phagophores and locally activates fatty acids (FAs) required for phagophore elongation and autophagy. Strikingly, using isotopic FA tracing, we directly show that Faa1 channels activated FAs into the synthesis of phospholipids and promotes their assembly into autophagic membranes. Indeed, the first committed steps of de novo phospholipid synthesis at the ER, which forms stable contacts with nascent autophagosomes, are essential for autophagy. Together, our work illuminates how cells spatially tune synthesis and flux of phospholipids for autophagosome biogenesis during autophagy.

Abstract: Summary
The association between macrocephaly and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) suggests that the mechanisms underlying excessive neural growth could contribute to ASD pathogenesis. Consistently, neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) of ASD individuals with early developmental brain enlargement are inherently more proliferative than control NPCs. Here, we show that hiPSC-derived NPCs from ASD individuals with macrocephaly display an altered DNA replication program and increased DNA damage. When compared with the control NPCs, high-throughput genome-wide translocation sequencing (HTGTS) demonstrates that ASD-derived NPCs harbored elevated DNA double-strand breaks in replication stress-susceptible genes, some of which are associated with ASD pathogenesis. Our results provide a mechanism linking hyperproliferation of NPCs with the pathogenesis of ASD by disrupting long neural genes involved in cell-cell adhesion and migration.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in FAMIN cause arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease in early childhood, and a common genetic variant increases the risk for Crohn's disease and leprosy. We developed an unbiased liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry screen for enzymatic activity of this orphan protein. We report that FAMIN phosphorolytically cleaves adenosine into adenine and ribose-1-phosphate. Such activity was considered absent from eukaryotic metabolism. FAMIN and its prokaryotic orthologs additionally have adenosine deaminase, purine nucleoside phosphorylase, and S-methyl-5′-thioadenosine phosphorylase activity, hence, combine activities of the namesake enzymes of central purine metabolism. FAMIN enables in macrophages a purine nucleotide cycle (PNC) between adenosine and inosine monophosphate and adenylosuccinate, which consumes aspartate and releases fumarate in a manner involving fatty acid oxidation and ATP-citrate lyase activity. This macrophage PNC synchronizes mitochondrial activity with glycolysis by balancing electron transfer to mitochondria, thereby supporting glycolytic activity and promoting oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial H+ and phosphate recycling.

Aging and gut microbiota dysbiosis that reshape brain immune cell plasticity and homeostasis has not been fully delineated. Using Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq), we analyze compositional and transcriptional changes of the brain immune landscape in response to aging and gut dysbiosis. Discordance between canonical surface-marker-defined immune cell types and their transcriptomes suggest transcriptional plasticity among immune cells. Ly6C+ monocytes predominate a pro-inflammatory signature in the aged brain, while innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) shift toward an ILC2-like profile. Aging increases ILC-like cells expressing a T memory stemness (Tscm) signature, which is reduced through antibiotics-induced gut dysbiosis. Systemic changes due to aging and gut dysbiosis increase propensity for neuroinflammation, providing insights into gut dysbiosis in age-related neurological diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 complex plays a central role in response to DNA double-strand breaks. Here, we identify a patient with bone marrow failure and developmental defects caused by biallelic RAD50 mutations. One of the mutations creates a null allele, whereas the other (RAD50E1035Δ) leads to the loss of a single residue in the heptad repeats within the RAD50 coiled-coil domain. This mutation represents a human RAD50 separation-of-function mutation that impairs DNA repair, DNA replication, and DNA end resection without affecting ATM-dependent DNA damage response. Purified recombinant proteins indicate that RAD50E1035Δ impairs MRE11 nuclease activity. The corresponding mutation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae causes severe thermosensitive defects in both DNA repair and Tel1ATM-dependent signaling. These findings demonstrate that a minor heptad break in the RAD50 coiled coil suffices to impede MRE11 complex functions in human and yeast. Furthermore, these results emphasize the importance of the RAD50 coiled coil to regulate MRE11-dependent DNA end resection in humans.

Abstract: Summary
Pathogenic autoantibodies arise in many autoimmune diseases, but it is not understood how the cells making them evade immune checkpoints. Here, single-cell multi-omics analysis demonstrates a shared mechanism with lymphoid malignancy in the formation of public rheumatoid factor autoantibodies responsible for mixed cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. By combining single-cell DNA and RNA sequencing with serum antibody peptide sequencing and antibody synthesis, rare circulating B lymphocytes making pathogenic autoantibodies were found to comprise clonal trees accumulating mutations. Lymphoma driver mutations in genes regulating B cell proliferation and V(D)J mutation (CARD11, TNFAIP3, CCND3, ID3, BTG2, and KLHL6) were present in rogue B cells producing the pathogenic autoantibody. Antibody V(D)J mutations conferred pathogenicity by causing the antigen-bound autoantibodies to undergo phase transition to insoluble aggregates at lower temperatures. These results reveal a pre-neoplastic stage in human lymphomagenesis and a cascade of somatic mutations leading to an iconic pathogenic autoantibody.

Abstract: Summary
Covalent modifications to histones are essential for development, establishing distinct and functional chromatin domains from a common genetic sequence. Whereas repressed chromatin is robustly inherited, no mechanism that facilitates inheritance of an activated domain has been described. Here, we report that the Set3C histone deacetylase scaffold Snt1 can act as a prion that drives the emergence and transgenerational inheritance of an activated chromatin state. This prion, which we term [ESI+] for expressed sub-telomeric information, is triggered by transient Snt1 phosphorylation upon cell cycle arrest. Once engaged, the prion reshapes the activity of Snt1 and the Set3C complex, recruiting RNA pol II and interfering with Rap1 binding to activate genes in otherwise repressed sub-telomeric domains. This transcriptional state confers broad resistance to environmental stress, including antifungal drugs. Altogether, our results establish a robust means by which a prion can facilitate inheritance of an activated chromatin state to provide adaptive benefit.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanisms by which exercise benefits human health remain incompletely understood. With the emergence of omics techniques, mapping of the molecular response to exercise is increasingly accessible. Here, we perform an untargeted metabolomics profiling of plasma from a randomized, within-subjects, crossover study of either endurance exercise or resistance exercise, two types of skeletal muscle activity that have differential effects on human physiology. A high-resolution time-series analyses reveal shared as well as exercise-mode-specific perturbations in a multitude of metabolic pathways. Moreover, the analyses reveal exercise-induced changes in metabolites that are recognized to act as signaling molecules. Thus, we provide a metabolomic signature of how dissimilar modes of exercise affect the organism in a time-resolved fashion.

Abstract: Summary
Aging is closely associated with increased susceptibility to breast cancer, yet there have been limited systematic studies of aging-induced alterations in the mammary gland. Here, we leverage high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing to generate a detailed transcriptomic atlas of young and aged murine mammary tissues. By analyzing epithelial, stromal, and immune cells, we identify age-dependent alterations in cell proportions and gene expression, providing evidence that suggests alveolar maturation and physiological decline. The analysis also uncovers potential pro-tumorigenic mechanisms coupled to the age-associated loss of tumor suppressor function and change in microenvironment. In addition, we identify a rare, age-dependent luminal population co-expressing hormone-sensing and secretory-alveolar lineage markers, as well as two macrophage populations expressing distinct gene signatures, underscoring the complex heterogeneity of the mammary epithelia and stroma. Collectively, this rich single-cell atlas reveals the effects of aging on mammary physiology and can serve as a useful resource for understanding aging-associated cancer risk.

Abstract: Summary
IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the leading cause of kidney failure due to an incomplete understanding of its pathogenesis. We perform single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on kidneys and CD14+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected from IgAN and normal samples. In IgAN, upregulation of JCHAIN in mesangial cells provides insight into the trigger mechanism for the dimerization and deposition of IgA1 in situ. The pathological mesangium also demonstrates a prominent inflammatory signature and increased cell-cell communication with other renal parenchymal cells and immune cells, suggesting disease progress from the mesangium to the entire kidney. Specific gene expression of kidney-resident macrophages and CD8+ T cells further indicates abnormal regulation associated with proliferation and inflammation. A transitional cell type among intercalated cells with fibrosis signatures is identified, suggesting an adverse outcome of interstitial fibrosis. Altogether, we systematically analyze the molecular events in the onset and progression of IgAN, providing a promising landscape for disease treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Fibrosis can develop in most organs and causes organ failure. The most common type of lung fibrosis is known as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, in which fibrosis starts at the lung periphery and then progresses toward the lung center, eventually causing respiratory failure. Little is known about the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis and periphery-to-center progression of the disease. Here we discovered that loss of Cdc42 function in alveolar stem cells (AT2 cells) causes periphery-to-center progressive lung fibrosis. We further show that Cdc42-null AT2 cells in both post-pneumonectomy and untreated aged mice cannot regenerate new alveoli, resulting in sustained exposure of AT2 cells to elevated mechanical tension. We demonstrate that elevated mechanical tension activates a TGF-β signaling loop in AT2 cells, which drives the periphery-to-center progression of lung fibrosis. Our study establishes a direct mechanistic link between impaired alveolar regeneration, mechanical tension, and progressive lung fibrosis.

Abstract: Summary
The regular distribution of trichomes on leaves in Arabidopsis is a well-understood model system for two-dimensional pattern formation. It involves more than 10 genes and is governed by two patterning principles, the activator-inhibitor (AI) and the activator-depletion (AD) mechanisms, though their relative contributions are unknown. The complexity of gene interactions, protein interactions, and intra- and intercellular mobility of proteins makes it very challenging to understand which aspects are relevant for pattern formation. In this study, we use global mathematical methods combined with a constraining of data to identify the structure of the underlying network. To constrain the model, we perform a genetic, cell biological, and biochemical study of weak ttg1 alleles. We find that the core of trichome patterning is a combination of AI and AD mechanisms differentiating between two pathways activating the long-range inhibitor CPC and the short-range inhibitor TRY.

Abstract: Summary
Mucosal barrier immunity is essential for the maintenance of the commensal microflora and combating invasive bacterial infection. Although immune and epithelial cells are thought to be the canonical orchestrators of this complex equilibrium, here, we show that the enteric nervous system (ENS) plays an essential and non-redundant role in governing the antimicrobial protein (AMP) response. Using confocal microscopy and single-molecule fluorescence in situ mRNA hybridization (smFISH) studies, we observed that intestinal neurons produce the pleiotropic cytokine IL-18. Strikingly, deletion of IL-18 from the enteric neurons alone, but not immune or epithelial cells, rendered mice susceptible to invasive Salmonella typhimurium (S.t.) infection. Mechanistically, unbiased RNA sequencing and single-cell sequencing revealed that enteric neuronal IL-18 is specifically required for homeostatic goblet cell AMP production. Together, we show that neuron-derived IL-18 signaling controls tissue-wide intestinal immunity and has profound consequences on the mucosal barrier and invasive bacterial killing.

Abstract: Summary
The nuclear pore complex forms a highly crowded selective barrier with intrinsically disordered regions at the nuclear membrane to coordinate nucleocytoplasmic molecular communications. Although oxidative stress is known to alter the barrier function, the molecular mechanism underlying this adaptive control of the nuclear pore complex remains unknown. Here we uncover a systematic control of the crowding barrier within the nuclear pore in response to various redox environments. Direct measurements of the crowding states using a crowding-sensitive FRET (Förster resonance energy transfer) probe reveal specific roles of the nuclear pore subunits that adjust the degree of crowding in response to different redox conditions, by adaptively forming or disrupting redox-sensitive disulfide bonds. Relationships between crowding control and the barrier function of the nuclear pore are investigated by single-molecular fluorescence measurements of nuclear transport. Based on these findings, we propose a proximal control model of molecular crowding in vivo that is dynamically regulated at the molecular level.

Abstract: Summary
In eukaryotes, heterochromatin is generally located at the nuclear periphery. This study investigates the biological significance of perinuclear positioning for heterochromatin maintenance and gene silencing. We identify the nuclear rim protein Amo1NUPL2 as a factor required for the propagation of heterochromatin at endogenous and ectopic sites in the fission yeast genome. Amo1 associates with the Rix1PELP1-containing RNA processing complex RIXC and with the histone chaperone complex FACT. RIXC, which binds to heterochromatin protein Swi6HP1 across silenced chromosomal domains and to surrounding boundary elements, connects heterochromatin with Amo1 at the nuclear periphery. In turn, the Amo1-enriched subdomain is critical for Swi6 association with FACT that precludes histone turnover to promote gene silencing and preserve epigenetic stability of heterochromatin. In addition to uncovering conserved factors required for perinuclear positioning of heterochromatin, these analyses elucidate a mechanism by which a peripheral subdomain enforces stable gene repression and maintains heterochromatin in a heritable manner.

Abstract: Summary
The identity of cellular populations that drive liver regeneration after injury is the subject of intense study, and the contributions of polyploid hepatocytes to organ regeneration and homeostasis have not been systematically assessed. Here, we developed a multicolor reporter allele system to genetically label and trace polyploid cells in situ. Multicolored polyploid hepatocytes undergo ploidy reduction and subsequent re-polyploidization after transplantation, providing direct evidence of the hepatocyte ploidy conveyor model. Marker segregation revealed that ploidy reduction rarely involves chromosome missegregation in vivo. We also traced polyploid hepatocytes in several different liver injury models and found robust proliferation in all settings. Importantly, ploidy reduction was seen in all injury models studied. We therefore conclude that polyploid hepatocytes have extensive regenerative capacity in situ and routinely undergo reductive mitoses during regenerative responses.

Abstract: Summary
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a monogenic disorder caused by mutations in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene. Mortality in CF patients is mostly due to respiratory sequelae. Challenges with gene delivery have limited attempts to treat CF using in vivo gene therapy, and low correction levels have hindered ex vivo gene therapy efforts. We have used Cas9 and adeno-associated virus 6 to correct the ΔF508 mutation in readily accessible upper-airway basal stem cells (UABCs) obtained from CF patients. On average, we achieved 30%–50% allelic correction in UABCs and bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) from 10 CF patients and observed 20%–50% CFTR function relative to non-CF controls in differentiated epithelia. Furthermore, we successfully embedded the corrected UABCs on an FDA-approved porcine small intestinal submucosal membrane (pSIS), and they retained differentiation capacity. This study supports further development of genetically corrected autologous airway stem cell transplant as a treatment for CF.

Abstract: Summary
Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play critical functional and regulatory roles in cellular processes. They are essential for macromolecular complex formation, which in turn constitutes the basis for protein interaction networks that determine the functional state of a cell. We and others have previously shown that chromatographic fractionation of native protein complexes in combination with bottom-up mass spectrometric analysis of consecutive fractions supports the multiplexed characterization and detection of state-specific changes of protein complexes. In this study, we extend co-fractionation and mass spectrometric data analysis to perform quantitative, network-based studies of proteome organization, via the size-exclusion chromatography algorithmic toolkit (SECAT). This framework explicitly accounts for the dynamic nature and rewiring of protein complexes across multiple cell states and samples, thus, elucidating molecular mechanisms that are differentially implemented across different experimental settings. Systematic analysis of multiple datasets shows that SECAT represents a highly scalable and effective methodology to assess condition/state-specific protein-network state. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the Supplemental Information.

Abstract: Summary
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Twins Study created an integrative molecular profile of an astronaut during NASA’s first 1-year mission on the International Space Station (ISS) and included comparisons to an identical Earth-bound twin. The unique biochemical profiles observed when landing on Earth after such a long mission (e.g., spikes in interleukin-1 [IL-1]/6/10, c-reactive protein [CRP], C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 [CCL2], IL-1 receptor antagonist [IL-1ra], and tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α]) opened new questions about the human body’s response to gravity and how to plan for future astronauts, particularly around initiation or resolution of inflammation. Here, single-cell, multi-omic (100-plex epitope profile and gene expression) profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) showed changes to blood cell composition and gene expression post-flight, specifically for monocytes and dendritic cell precursors. These were consistent with flight-induced cytokine and immune system stress, followed by skeletal muscle regeneration in response to gravity. Finally, we examined these profiles relative to 6-month missions in 28 other astronauts and detail potential pharmacological interventions for returning to gravity in future missions.

Abstract: Summary
Cerebellar neurons can signal sensory and motor events, but their role in active sensorimotor processing remains unclear. We record and manipulate Purkinje cell activity during a task that requires mice to rapidly discriminate between multisensory and unisensory stimuli before motor initiation. Neuropixels recordings show that both sensory stimuli and motor initiation are represented by short-latency simple spikes. Optogenetic manipulation of short-latency simple spikes abolishes or delays motor initiation in a rate-dependent manner, indicating a role in motor initiation and its timing. Two-photon calcium imaging reveals task-related coherence of complex spikes organized into conserved alternating parasagittal stripes. The coherence of sensory-evoked complex spikes increases with learning and correlates with enhanced temporal precision of motor initiation. These results suggest that both simple spikes and complex spikes govern sensory-driven motor initiation: simple spikes modulate its latency, and complex spikes refine its temporal precision, providing specific cellular substrates for cerebellar sensorimotor control.

Abstract: Summary
Stress granules are condensates of non-translating mRNAs and proteins involved in the stress response and neurodegenerative diseases. Stress granules form in part through intermolecular RNA-RNA interactions, and to better understand how RNA-based condensation occurs, we demonstrate that RNA is effectively recruited to the surfaces of RNA or RNP condensates in vitro. We demonstrate that, through ATP-dependent RNA binding, the DEAD-box protein eIF4A reduces RNA condensation in vitro and limits stress granule formation in cells. This defines a function for eIF4A to limit intermolecular RNA-RNA interactions in cells. These results establish an important role for eIF4A, and potentially other DEAD-box proteins, as ATP-dependent RNA chaperones that limit the condensation of RNA, analogous to the function of proteins like HSP70 in combatting protein aggregates.

Abstract: Summary
Concurrent loss-of-function mutations in STK11 and KEAP1 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) are associated with aggressive tumor growth, resistance to available therapies, and early death. We investigated the effects of coordinate STK11 and KEAP1 loss by comparing co-mutant with single mutant and wild-type isogenic counterparts in multiple LUAD models. STK11/KEAP1 co-mutation results in significantly elevated expression of ferroptosis-protective genes, including SCD and AKR1C1/2/3, and resistance to pharmacologically induced ferroptosis. CRISPR screening further nominates SCD (SCD1) as selectively essential in STK11/KEAP1 co-mutant LUAD. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of SCD1 confirms the essentiality of this gene and augments the effects of ferroptosis induction by erastin and RSL3. Together these data identify SCD1 as a selective vulnerability and a promising candidate for targeted drug development in STK11/KEAP1 co-mutant LUAD.

Abstract: Summary
The testis expresses the largest number of genes of any mammalian organ, a finding that has long puzzled molecular biologists. Our single-cell transcriptomic data of human and mouse spermatogenesis provide evidence that this widespread transcription maintains DNA sequence integrity in the male germline by correcting DNA damage through a mechanism we term transcriptional scanning. We find that genes expressed during spermatogenesis display lower mutation rates on the transcribed strand and have low diversity in the population. Moreover, this effect is fine-tuned by the level of gene expression during spermatogenesis. The unexpressed genes, which in our model do not benefit from transcriptional scanning, diverge faster over evolutionary timescales and are enriched for sensory and immune-defense functions. Collectively, we propose that transcriptional scanning shapes germline mutation signatures and modulates mutation rates in a gene-specific manner, maintaining DNA sequence integrity for the bulk of genes but allowing for faster evolution in a specific subset.

Abstract: Summary
Accumulating evidence indicates that patient-derived organoids (PDOs) can predict drug responses in the clinic, but the ability of PDOs to predict responses to chemoradiation in cancer patients remains an open question. Here we generate a living organoid biobank from patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation (NACR) enrolled in a phase III clinical trial. Our co-clinical trial data confirm that rectal cancer organoids (RCOs) closely recapitulate the pathophysiology and genetic changes of corresponding tumors. Chemoradiation responses in patients are highly matched to RCO responses, with 84.43% accuracy, 78.01% sensitivity, and 91.97% specificity. These data imply that PDOs predict LARC patient responses in the clinic and may represent a companion diagnostic tool in rectal cancer treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Neuromuscular networks assemble during early human embryonic development and are essential for the control of body movement. Previous neuromuscular junction modeling efforts using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) generated either spinal cord neurons or skeletal muscles in monolayer culture. Here, we use hPSC-derived axial stem cells, the building blocks of the posterior body, to simultaneously generate spinal cord neurons and skeletal muscle cells that self-organize to generate human neuromuscular organoids (NMOs) that can be maintained in 3D for several months. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of individual organoids revealed reproducibility across experiments and enabled the tracking of the neural and mesodermal differentiation trajectories as organoids developed and matured. NMOs contain functional neuromuscular junctions supported by terminal Schwann cells. They contract and develop central pattern generator-like neuronal circuits. Finally, we successfully use NMOs to recapitulate key aspects of myasthenia gravis pathology, thus highlighting the significant potential of NMOs for modeling neuromuscular diseases in the future.

Abstract: Summary
A safe and controlled manipulation of endocytosis in vivo may have disruptive therapeutic potential. Here, we demonstrate that the anti-emetic/anti-psychotic prochlorperazine can be repurposed to reversibly inhibit the in vivo endocytosis of membrane proteins targeted by therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, as directly demonstrated by our human tumor ex vivo assay. Temporary endocytosis inhibition results in enhanced target availability and improved efficiency of natural killer cell-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), a mediator of clinical responses induced by IgG1 antibodies, demonstrated here for cetuximab, trastuzumab, and avelumab. Extensive analysis of downstream signaling pathways ruled out on-target toxicities. By overcoming the heterogeneity of drug target availability that frequently characterizes poorly responsive or resistant tumors, clinical application of reversible endocytosis inhibition may considerably improve the clinical benefit of ADCC-mediating therapeutic antibodies.

Abstract: Summary
Prokaryotic toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are composed of a toxin capable of interfering with key cellular processes and its neutralizing antidote, the antitoxin. Here, we focus on the HEPN-MNT TA system encoded in the vicinity of a subtype I-D CRISPR-Cas system in the cyanobacterium Aphanizomenon flos-aquae. We show that HEPN acts as a toxic RNase, which cleaves off 4 nt from the 3′ end in a subset of tRNAs, thereby interfering with translation. Surprisingly, we find that the MNT (minimal nucleotidyltransferase) antitoxin inhibits HEPN RNase through covalent di-AMPylation (diadenylylation) of a conserved tyrosine residue, Y109, in the active site loop. Furthermore, we present crystallographic snapshots of the di-AMPylation reaction at different stages that explain the mechanism of HEPN RNase inactivation. Finally, we propose that the HEPN-MNT system functions as a cellular ATP sensor that monitors ATP homeostasis and, at low ATP levels, releases active HEPN toxin.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) have been detected in autism and related disorders, but how these mutations disrupt nervous system function is unknown. Here, we define the effects of DNMT3A mutations associated with neurodevelopmental disease. We show that diverse mutations affect different aspects of protein activity but lead to shared deficiencies in neuronal DNA methylation. Heterozygous DNMT3A knockout mice mimicking DNMT3A disruption in disease display growth and behavioral alterations consistent with human phenotypes. Strikingly, in these mice, we detect global disruption of neuron-enriched non-CG DNA methylation, a binding site for the Rett syndrome protein MeCP2. Loss of this methylation leads to enhancer and gene dysregulation that overlaps with models of Rett syndrome and autism. These findings define the effects of DNMT3A haploinsufficiency in the brain and uncover disruption of the non-CG methylation pathway as a convergence point across neurodevelopmental disorders.

Abstract: Summary
The three-dimensional structures of chromosomes are increasingly being recognized as playing a major role in cellular regulatory states. The efficiency and promiscuity of phage Mu transposition was exploited to directly measure in vivo interactions between genomic loci in E. coli. Two global organizing principles have emerged: first, the chromosome is well-mixed and uncompartmentalized, with transpositions occurring freely between all measured loci; second, several gene families/regions show “clustering”: strong three-dimensional co-localization regardless of linear genomic distance. The activities of the SMC/condensin protein MukB and nucleoid-compacting protein subunit HU-α are essential for the well-mixed state; HU-α is also needed for clustering of 6/7 ribosomal RNA-encoding loci. The data are explained by a model in which the chromosomal structure is driven by dynamic competition between DNA replication and chromosomal relaxation, providing a foundation for determining how region-specific properties contribute to both chromosomal structure and gene regulation.

Abstract: Summary
N6 methylation at adenosine 1832 (m6A1832) of mammalian 18S rRNA, occupying a critical position within the decoding center, is modified by a conserved methyltransferase, METTL5. Here, we find that METTL5 shows strong substrate preference toward the 18S A1832 motif but not the other reported m6A motifs. Comparison with a yeast ribosome structural model unmodified at this site indicates that the modification may facilitate mRNA binding by inducing conformation changes in the mammalian ribosomal decoding center. METTL5 promotes p70-S6K activation and proper translation initiation, and the loss of METTL5 significantly reduces the abundance of polysome. METTL5 expression is elevated in breast cancer patient samples and is required for growth of several breast cancer cell lines. We further find that Caenorhabditis elegans lacking the homolog metl-5 develop phenotypes known to be associated with impaired translation. Altogether, our findings uncover critical and conserved roles of METTL5 in the regulation of translation.

Abstract: Summary
Gut-innervating nociceptor sensory neurons respond to noxious stimuli by initiating protective responses including pain and inflammation; however, their role in enteric infections is unclear. Here, we find that nociceptor neurons critically mediate host defense against the bacterial pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (STm). Dorsal root ganglia nociceptors protect against STm colonization, invasion, and dissemination from the gut. Nociceptors regulate the density of microfold (M) cells in ileum Peyer’s patch (PP) follicle-associated epithelia (FAE) to limit entry points for STm invasion. Downstream of M cells, nociceptors maintain levels of segmentous filamentous bacteria (SFB), a gut microbe residing on ileum villi and PP FAE that mediates resistance to STm infection. TRPV1+ nociceptors directly respond to STm by releasing calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a neuropeptide that modulates M cells and SFB levels to protect against Salmonella infection. These findings reveal a major role for nociceptor neurons in sensing and defending against enteric pathogens.

Abstract: Summary
By incorporating an artificial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation mechanism, a biotic/abiotic integration is designed to improve the anti-tumor effect of neutrophils by artificially potentiating their ROS effector mechanism in a remotely controlled route. Specifically, the photosensitizer Ce6 is nano-packaged by the albumin BSA to achieve biocompatible and efficient integration with neutrophils (NEs). Reinfusion of the engineered NEs into 4T1 tumor-bearing mice led to more Ce6 accumulation in tumors relative to Ce6 nanoformulation. At the peak of accumulation, tumor illumination activates the embedded Ce6 for ROS generation and NETosis formation. Because of the ROS-intensified cytolytic effect, the growth of 4T1 tumors is inhibited significantly. The photo-controlled process largely avoids the off-target effects observed frequently in current cell therapies. The strategy directly generates ROS effector molecules with spatiotemporal precision. This engineering approach is able to potentiate the native capacity of immune cells independent of the tumor microenvironment.

Abstract: Summary
Goal-directed behavior requires the interaction of multiple brain regions. How these regions and their interactions with brain-wide activity drive action selection is less understood. We have investigated this question by combining whole-brain volumetric calcium imaging using light-field microscopy and an operant-conditioning task in larval zebrafish. We find global, recurring dynamics of brain states to exhibit pre-motor bifurcations toward mutually exclusive decision outcomes. These dynamics arise from a distributed network displaying trial-by-trial functional connectivity changes, especially between cerebellum and habenula, which correlate with decision outcome. Within this network the cerebellum shows particularly strong and predictive pre-motor activity (>10 s before movement initiation), mainly within the granule cells. Turn directions are determined by the difference neuroactivity between the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres, while the rate of bi-hemispheric population ramping quantitatively predicts decision time on the trial-by-trial level. Our results highlight a cognitive role of the cerebellum and its importance in motor planning.

Abstract: Summary
Lymphoid cells that produce interleukin (IL)-17 cytokines protect barrier tissues from pathogenic microbes but are also prominent effectors of inflammation and autoimmune disease. T helper 17 (Th17) cells, defined by RORγt-dependent production of IL-17A and IL-17F, exert homeostatic functions in the gut upon microbiota-directed differentiation from naive CD4+ T cells. In the non-pathogenic setting, their cytokine production is regulated by serum amyloid A proteins (SAA1 and SAA2) secreted by adjacent intestinal epithelial cells. However, Th17 cell behaviors vary markedly according to their environment. Here, we show that SAAs additionally direct a pathogenic pro-inflammatory Th17 cell differentiation program, acting directly on T cells in collaboration with STAT3-activating cytokines. Using loss- and gain-of-function mouse models, we show that SAA1, SAA2, and SAA3 have distinct systemic and local functions in promoting Th17-mediated inflammatory diseases. These studies suggest that T cell signaling pathways modulated by the SAAs may be attractive targets for anti-inflammatory therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Long non-coding RNAs can often fold into different conformations. Telomerase RNA, an essential component of the telomerase ribonucleoprotein (RNP) enzyme, must fold into a defined structure to fulfill its function with the protein catalytic subunit (TERT) and other accessory factors. However, the mechanism by which the correct folding of telomerase RNA is warranted in a cell is still unknown. Here we show that La-related protein Pof8 specifically recognizes the conserved pseudoknot region of telomerase RNA and instructs the binding of the Lsm2-8 complex to its mature 3′ end, thus selectively protecting the correctly folded RNA from exonucleolytic degradation. In the absence of Pof8, TERT assembles with misfolded RNA and produces little telomerase activity. Therefore, Pof8 plays a key role in telomerase RNA folding quality control, ensuring that TERT only assembles with functional telomerase RNA to form active telomerase. Our finding reveals a mechanism for non-coding RNA folding quality control.

Abstract: Summary
Integrin αvβ8 binds with exquisite specificity to latent transforming growth factor-β (L-TGF-β). This binding is essential for activating L-TGF-β presented by a variety of cell types. Inhibiting αvβ8-mediated TGF-β activation blocks immunosuppressive regulatory T cell differentiation, which is a potential therapeutic strategy in cancer. Using cryo-electron microscopy, structure-guided mutagenesis, and cell-based assays, we reveal the binding interactions between the entire αvβ8 ectodomain and its intact natural ligand, L-TGF-β, as well as two different inhibitory antibody fragments to understand the structural underpinnings of αvβ8 binding specificity and TGF-β activation. Our studies reveal a mechanism of TGF-β activation where mature TGF-β signals within the confines of L-TGF-β and the release and diffusion of TGF-β are not required. The structural details of this mechanism provide a rational basis for therapeutic strategies to inhibit αvβ8-mediated L-TGF-β activation.

Abstract: Summary
Teneurins are ancient metazoan cell adhesion receptors that control brain development and neuronal wiring in higher animals. The extracellular C terminus binds the adhesion GPCR Latrophilin, forming a trans-cellular complex with synaptogenic functions. However, Teneurins, Latrophilins, and FLRT proteins are also expressed during murine cortical cell migration at earlier developmental stages. Here, we present crystal structures of Teneurin-Latrophilin complexes that reveal how the lectin and olfactomedin domains of Latrophilin bind across a spiraling beta-barrel domain of Teneurin, the YD shell. We couple structure-based protein engineering to biophysical analysis, cell migration assays, and in utero electroporation experiments to probe the importance of the interaction in cortical neuron migration. We show that binding of Latrophilins to Teneurins and FLRTs directs the migration of neurons using a contact repulsion-dependent mechanism. The effect is observed with cell bodies and small neurites rather than their processes. The results exemplify how a structure-encoded synaptogenic protein complex is also used for repulsive cell guidance.

Abstract: Summary
The propagation of electrical impulses along axons is highly accelerated by the myelin sheath and produces saltating or “jumping” action potentials across internodes, from one node of Ranvier to the next. The underlying electrical circuit, as well as the existence and role of submyelin conduction in saltatory conduction remain, however, elusive. Here, we made patch-clamp and high-speed voltage-calibrated optical recordings of potentials across the nodal and internodal axolemma of myelinated neocortical pyramidal axons combined with electron microscopy and experimentally constrained cable modeling. Our results reveal a nanoscale yet conductive periaxonal space, incompletely sealed at the paranodes, which separates the potentials across the low-capacitance myelin sheath and internodal axolemma. The emerging double-cable model reproduces the recorded evolution of voltage waveforms across nodes and internodes, including rapid nodal potentials traveling in advance of attenuated waves in the internodal axolemma, revealing a mechanism for saltation across time and space.

Abstract: Complement fragment iC3b serves as a major opsonin for facilitating phagocytosis via its interaction with complement receptors CR3 and CR4, also known by their leukocyte integrin family names, αMβ2 and αXβ2, respectively. Although there is general agreement that iC3b binds to the αM and αX I-domains of the respective β2-integrins, much less is known regarding the regions of iC3b contributing to the αX I-domain binding. In this study, using recombinant αX I-domain, as well as recombinant fragments of iC3b as candidate binding partners, we have identified two distinct binding moieties of iC3b for the αX I-domain. They are the C3 convertase-generated N-terminal segment of the C3b α’-chain (α’NT) and the factor I cleavage-generated N-terminal segment in the CUBf region of α-chain. Additionally, we have found that the CUBf segment is a novel binding moiety of iC3b for the αM I-domain. The CUBf segment shows about a 2-fold higher binding activity than the α’NT for αX I-domain. We also have shown the involvement of crucial acidic residues on the iC3b side of the interface and basic residues on the I-domain side.

Abstract: Summary
Immune responses in diverse tissue sites are critical for protective immunity and homeostasis. Here, we investigate how tissue localization regulates the development and function of human natural killer (NK) cells, innate lymphocytes important for anti-viral and tumor immunity. Integrating high-dimensional analysis of NK cells from blood, lymphoid organs, and mucosal tissue sites from 60 individuals, we identify tissue-specific patterns of NK cell subset distribution, maturation, and function maintained across age and between individuals. Mature and terminally differentiated NK cells with enhanced effector function predominate in blood, bone marrow, spleen, and lungs and exhibit shared transcriptional programs across sites. By contrast, precursor and immature NK cells with reduced effector capacity populate lymph nodes and intestines and exhibit tissue-resident signatures and site-specific adaptations. Together, our results reveal anatomic control of NK cell development and maintenance as tissue-resident populations, whereas mature, terminally differentiated subsets mediate immunosurveillance through diverse peripheral sites.

Abstract: Summary
The ability to identify single-nucleotide mutations is critical for probing cell biology and for precise detection of disease. However, the small differences in hybridization energy provided by single-base changes makes identification of these mutations challenging in living cells and complex reaction environments. Here, we report a class of de novo-designed prokaryotic riboregulators that provide ultraspecific RNA detection capabilities in vivo and in cell-free transcription-translation reactions. These single-nucleotide-specific programmable riboregulators (SNIPRs) provide over 100-fold differences in gene expression in response to target RNAs differing by a single nucleotide in E. coli and resolve single epitranscriptomic marks in vitro. By exploiting the programmable SNIPR design, we implement an automated design algorithm to develop riboregulators for a range of mutations associated with cancer, drug resistance, and genetic disorders. Integrating SNIPRs with portable paper-based cell-free reactions enables convenient isothermal detection of cancer-associated mutations from clinical samples and identification of Zika strains through unambiguous colorimetric reactions.

Abstract: Summary
Cell polarity is fundamental for tissue morphogenesis in multicellular organisms. Plants and animals evolved multicellularity independently, and it is unknown whether their polarity systems are derived from a single-celled ancestor. Planar polarity in animals is conferred by Wnt signaling, an ancient signaling pathway transduced by Dishevelled, which assembles signalosomes by dynamic head-to-tail DIX domain polymerization. In contrast, polarity-determining pathways in plants are elusive. We recently discovered Arabidopsis SOSEKI proteins, which exhibit polar localization throughout development. Here, we identify SOSEKI as ancient polar proteins across land plants. Concentration-dependent polymerization via a bona fide DIX domain allows these to recruit ANGUSTIFOLIA to polar sites, similar to the polymerization-dependent recruitment of signaling effectors by Dishevelled. Cross-kingdom domain swaps reveal functional equivalence of animal and plant DIX domains. We trace DIX domains to unicellular eukaryotes and thus show that DIX-dependent polymerization is an ancient mechanism conserved between kingdoms and central to polarity proteins.

Abstract: Summary
In many tissues, stem cell (SC) proliferation is dynamically adjusted to regenerative needs. How SCs adapt their metabolism to meet the demands of proliferation and how changes in such adaptive mechanisms contribute to age-related dysfunction remain poorly understood. Here, we identify mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake as a central coordinator of SC metabolism. Live imaging of genetically encoded metabolite sensors in intestinal SCs (ISCs) of Drosophila reveals that mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake transiently adapts electron transport chain flux to match energetic demand upon proliferative activation. This tight metabolic adaptation is lost in ISCs of old flies, as declines in mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake promote a “Warburg-like” metabolic reprogramming toward aerobic glycolysis. This switch mimics metabolic reprogramming by the oncogene RasV12 and enhances ISC hyperplasia. Our data identify a critical mechanism for metabolic adaptation of tissue SCs and reveal how its decline sets aging SCs on a metabolic trajectory reminiscent of that seen upon oncogenic transformation.

Abstract: Summary
Changes in stem cell activity may underpin aging. However, these changes are not completely understood. Here, we combined single-cell profiling with machine learning and in vivo functional studies to explore how hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) divisions patterns evolve with age. We first trained an artificial neural network (ANN) to accurately identify cell types in the hematopoietic hierarchy and predict their age from single-cell gene-expression patterns. We then used this ANN to compare identities of daughter cells immediately after HSC divisions and found that the self-renewal ability of individual HSCs declines with age. Furthermore, while HSC cell divisions are deterministic and intrinsically regulated in young and old age, they are variable and niche sensitive in mid-life. These results indicate that the balance between intrinsic and extrinsic regulation of stem cell activity alters substantially with age and help explain why stem cell numbers increase through life, yet regenerative potency declines.

Abstract: Summary
Epithelial tissues represent vital interfaces between organisms and their environment. As they are constantly exposed to harmful pathogens, innocuous commensals, and environmental microbes, it is essential they sense and elicit appropriate responses toward these different types of microbes. Here, we demonstrate that the epithelial cytokine interleukin-36γ (IL-36γ) acts as a global discriminator of pathogenic and harmless microbes via cell damage and proteolytic activation. We show that intracellular pro-IL-36γ is upregulated by both fungal and bacterial epithelial microbes; yet, it is only liberated from cells, and subsequently processed to its mature, potent, proinflammatory form, by pathogen-mediated cell damage and pathogen-derived proteases. This work demonstrates that IL-36γ senses pathogen-induced cell damage and proteolytic activity and is a key initiator of immune responses and pathological inflammation within epithelial tissues. As an apically located epithelial proinflammatory cytokine, we therefore propose that IL-36γ is critical as the initial discriminator of harmless microbes and invasive pathogens within epithelial tissues.

Abstract: Summary
DNA damage tolerance (DDT) and homologous recombination (HR) stabilize replication forks (RFs). RAD18/UBC13/three prime repair exonuclease 2 (TREX2)-mediated proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) ubiquitination is central to DDT, an error-prone lesion bypass pathway. RAD51 is the recombinase for HR. The RAD51 K133A mutation increased spontaneous mutations and stress-induced RF stalls and nascent strand degradation. Here, we report in RAD51K133A cells that this phenotype is reduced by expressing a TREX2 H188A mutation that deletes its exonuclease activity. In RAD51K133A cells, knocking out RAD18 or overexpressing PCNA reduces spontaneous mutations, while expressing ubiquitination-incompetent PCNAK164R increases mutations, indicating DDT as causal. Deleting TREX2 in cells deficient for the RF maintenance proteins poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) or FANCB increased nascent strand degradation that was rescued by TREX2H188A, implying that TREX2 prohibits degradation independent of catalytic activity. A possible explanation for this occurrence is that TREX2H188A associates with UBC13 and ubiquitinates PCNA, suggesting a dual role for TREX2 in RF maintenance.

Abstract: Summary
Recognition of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) is crucial for the plant’s immune response. How this sophisticated perception system can be usefully deployed in roots, continuously exposed to microbes, remains a mystery. By analyzing MAMP receptor expression and response at cellular resolution in Arabidopsis, we observed that differentiated outer cell layers show low expression of pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) and lack MAMP responsiveness. Yet, these cells can be gated to become responsive by neighbor cell damage. Laser ablation of small cell clusters strongly upregulates PRR expression in their vicinity, and elevated receptor expression is sufficient to induce responsiveness in non-responsive cells. Finally, localized damage also leads to immune responses to otherwise non-immunogenic, beneficial bacteria. Damage-gating is overridden by receptor overexpression, which antagonizes colonization. Our findings that cellular damage can “switch on” local immune responses helps to conceptualize how MAMP perception can be used despite the presence of microbial patterns in the soil.

Abstract: Summary
Stem-cell-derived tissues could transform disease research and therapy, yet most methods generate functionally immature products. We investigate how human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) differentiate into pancreatic islets in vitro by profiling DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility, and histone modification changes. We find that enhancer potential is reset upon lineage commitment and show how pervasive epigenetic priming steers endocrine cell fates. Modeling islet differentiation and maturation regulatory circuits reveals genes critical for generating endocrine cells and identifies circadian control as limiting for in vitro islet function. Entrainment to circadian feeding/fasting cycles triggers islet metabolic maturation by inducing cyclic synthesis of energy metabolism and insulin secretion effectors, including antiphasic insulin and glucagon pulses. Following entrainment, hPSC-derived islets gain persistent chromatin changes and rhythmic insulin responses with a raised glucose threshold, a hallmark of functional maturity, and function within days of transplantation. Thus, hPSC-derived tissues are amenable to functional improvement by circadian modulation.

Abstract: Summary
The extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration is highly elevated in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and remains tightly regulated in normal tissues. Using phage display technology, we establish a method to identify an antibody that can bind to an antigen only in the presence of ATP. Crystallography analysis reveals that ATP bound in between the antibody-antigen interface serves as a switch for antigen binding. In a transgenic mouse model overexpressing the antigen systemically, the ATP switch antibody binds to the antigen in tumors with minimal binding in normal tissues and plasma and inhibits tumor growth. Thus, we demonstrate that elevated extracellular ATP concentration can be exploited to specifically target the TME, giving therapeutic antibodies the ability to overcome on-target off-tumor toxicity.

Abstract: Summary
Changes in antibody glycosylation are linked to inflammation across several diseases. Alterations in bulk antibody galactosylation can predict rheumatic flares, act as a sensor for immune activation, predict gastric cancer relapse, track with biological age, shift with vaccination, change with HIV reservoir size on therapy, and decrease in HIV and HCV infections. However, whether changes in antibody Fc biology also track with reservoir rebound time remains unclear. The identification of a biomarker that could forecast viral rebound time could significantly accelerate the downselection and iterative improvement of promising HIV viral eradication strategies. Using a comprehensive antibody Fc-profiling approach, the level of HIV-specific antibody Fc N-galactosylation is significantly associated with time to rebound after treatment discontinuation across three independent cohorts. Thus virus-specific antibody glycosylation may represent a promising, simply measured marker to track reservoir reactivation.

Abstract: Summary
Wnt dependency and Lgr5 expression define multiple mammalian epithelial stem cell types. Under defined growth factor conditions, such adult stem cells (ASCs) grow as 3D organoids that recapitulate essential features of the pertinent epithelium. Here, we establish long-term expanding venom gland organoids from several snake species. The newly assembled transcriptome of the Cape coral snake reveals that organoids express high levels of toxin transcripts. Single-cell RNA sequencing of both organoids and primary tissue identifies distinct venom-expressing cell types as well as proliferative cells expressing homologs of known mammalian stem cell markers. A hard-wired regional heterogeneity in the expression of individual venom components is maintained in organoid cultures. Harvested venom peptides reflect crude venom composition and display biological activity. This study extends organoid technology to reptilian tissues and describes an experimentally tractable model system representing the snake venom gland.

Abstract: Summary
Toxoplasma gondii chronically infects a quarter of the world’s population, and its recrudescence can cause life-threatening disease in immunocompromised individuals and recurrent ocular lesions in the immunocompetent. Acute-stage tachyzoites differentiate into chronic-stage bradyzoites, which form intracellular cysts resistant to immune clearance and existing therapies. The molecular basis of this differentiation is unknown, despite being efficiently triggered by stresses in culture. Through Cas9-mediated screening and single-cell profiling, we identify a Myb-like transcription factor (BFD1) necessary for differentiation in cell culture and in mice. BFD1 accumulates during stress and its synthetic expression is sufficient to drive differentiation. Consistent with its function as a transcription factor, BFD1 binds the promoters of many stage-specific genes and represents a counterpoint to the ApiAP2 factors that dominate our current view of parasite gene regulation. BFD1 provides a genetic switch to study and control Toxoplasma differentiation and will inform prevention and treatment of chronic infections.

Abstract: Summary
Gap junctions are present in most tissues and play essential roles in various biological processes. However, we know surprisingly little about the molecular mechanisms underlying gap junction formation. Here, we uncover the essential role of a conserved EGF- and laminin-G-domain-containing protein nlr-1/CASPR in the regulation of gap junction formation in multiple tissues across different developmental stages in C. elegans. NLR-1 is located in the gap junction perinexus, a region adjacent to but not overlapping with gap junctions, and forms puncta before the clusters of gap junction channels appear on the membrane. We show that NLR-1 can directly bind to actin to recruit F-actin networks at the gap junction formation plaque, and the formation of F-actin patches plays a critical role in the assembly of gap junction channels. Our findings demonstrate that nlr-1/CASPR acts as an early stage signal for gap junction formation through anchoring of F-actin networks.

Abstract: Summary
Many bacteria contain an RNA repair operon, encoding the RtcB RNA ligase and the RtcA RNA cyclase, that is regulated by the RtcR transcriptional activator. Although RtcR contains a divergent version of the CARF (CRISPR-associated Rossman fold) oligonucleotide-binding regulatory domain, both the specific signal that regulates operon expression and the substrates of the encoded enzymes are unknown. We report that tRNA fragments activate operon expression. Using a genetic screen in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, we find that the operon is expressed in the presence of mutations that cause tRNA fragments to accumulate. RtcA, which converts RNA phosphate ends to 2′, 3′-cyclic phosphate, is also required. Operon expression and tRNA fragment accumulation also occur upon DNA damage. The CARF domain binds 5′ tRNA fragments ending in cyclic phosphate, and RtcR oligomerizes upon binding these ligands, a prerequisite for operon activation. Our studies reveal a signaling pathway involving broken tRNAs and implicate the operon in tRNA repair.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanotransduction, the conversion of mechanical stimuli into electrical signals, is a fundamental process underlying essential physiological functions such as touch and pain sensing, hearing, and proprioception. Although the mechanisms for some of these functions have been identified, the molecules essential to the sense of pain have remained elusive. Here we report identification of TACAN (Tmem120A), an ion channel involved in sensing mechanical pain. TACAN is expressed in a subset of nociceptors, and its heterologous expression increases mechanically evoked currents in cell lines. Purification and reconstitution of TACAN in synthetic lipids generates a functional ion channel. Finally, a nociceptor-specific inducible knockout of TACAN decreases the mechanosensitivity of nociceptors and reduces behavioral responses to painful mechanical stimuli but not to thermal or touch stimuli. We propose that TACAN is an ion channel that contributes to sensing mechanical pain.

The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) ATPases VPS4A and VPS4B score as strong synthetic lethal dependencies. VPS4A is essential in cancers harboring loss of VPS4B adjacent to SMAD4 on chromosome 18q and VPS4B is required in tumors with co-deletion of VPS4A and CDH1 (E-cadherin) on chromosome 16q. We demonstrate that more than 30% of cancers selectively require VPS4A or VPS4B. VPS4A suppression in VPS4B-deficient cells selectively leads to ESCRT-III filament accumulation, cytokinesis defects, nuclear deformation, G2/M arrest, apoptosis, and potent tumor regression. CRISPR-SpCas9 screening and integrative genomic analysis reveal other ESCRT members, regulators of abscission, and interferon signaling as modifiers of VPS4A dependency. We describe a compendium of synthetic lethal vulnerabilities and nominate VPS4A and VPS4B as high-priority therapeutic targets for cancers with 18q or 16q loss.

Abstract: Summary
Generating mammalian cells with desired mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences is enabling for studies of mitochondria, disease modeling, and potential regenerative therapies. MitoPunch, a high-throughput mitochondrial transfer device, produces cells with specific mtDNA-nuclear DNA (nDNA) combinations by transferring isolated mitochondria from mouse or human cells into primary or immortal mtDNA-deficient (ρ0) cells. Stable isolated mitochondrial recipient (SIMR) cells isolated in restrictive media permanently retain donor mtDNA and reacquire respiration. However, SIMR fibroblasts maintain a ρ0-like cell metabolome and transcriptome despite growth in restrictive media. We reprogrammed non-immortal SIMR fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with subsequent differentiation into diverse functional cell types, including mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), adipocytes, osteoblasts, and chondrocytes. Remarkably, after reprogramming and differentiation, SIMR fibroblasts molecularly and phenotypically resemble unmanipulated control fibroblasts carried through the same protocol. Thus, our MitoPunch “pipeline” enables the production of SIMR cells with unique mtDNA-nDNA combinations for additional studies and applications in multiple cell types.

Abstract: Summary
The tumor microenvironment (TME) is critical for tumor progression. However, the establishment and function of the TME remain obscure because of its complex cellular composition. Using a mouse genetic system called mosaic analysis with double markers (MADMs), we delineated TME evolution at single-cell resolution in sonic hedgehog (SHH)-activated medulloblastomas that originate from unipotent granule neuron progenitors in the brain. First, we found that astrocytes within the TME (TuAstrocytes) were trans-differentiated from tumor granule neuron precursors (GNPs), which normally never differentiate into astrocytes. Second, we identified that TME-derived IGF1 promotes tumor progression. Third, we uncovered that insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) is produced by tumor-associated microglia in response to interleukin-4 (IL-4) stimulation. Finally, we found that IL-4 is secreted by TuAstrocytes. Collectively, our studies reveal an evolutionary process that produces a multi-lateral network within the TME of medulloblastoma: a fraction of tumor cells trans-differentiate into TuAstrocytes, which, in turn, produce IL-4 that stimulates microglia to produce IGF1 to promote tumor progression.

Abstract: Summary
Rapid regeneration of smooth muscle after vascular injury is essential for maintaining arterial function. The existence and putative roles of resident vascular stem cells (VSCs) in artery repair are controversial, and vessel regeneration is thought to be mediated by proliferative expansion of pre-existing smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Here, we performed cell fate mapping and single-cell RNA sequencing to identify Sca1+ VSCs in the adventitial layer of artery walls. After severe injury, Sca1+ VSCs migrate into the medial layer and generate de novo SMCs, which subsequently expand more efficiently compared with pre-existing smooth muscle. Genetic lineage tracing using dual recombinases distinguished a Sca1+PDGFRa+ VSC subpopulation that generates SMCs, and genetic ablation of Sca1+ VSCs or specific knockout of Yap1 in Sca1+ VSCs significantly impaired artery repair. These findings provide genetic evidence of a bona fide Sca1+ VSC population that produces SMCs and delineates their critical role in vessel repair.

Abstract: Summary
We present the largest exome sequencing study of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to date (n = 35,584 total samples, 11,986 with ASD). Using an enhanced analytical framework to integrate de novo and case-control rare variation, we identify 102 risk genes at a false discovery rate of 0.1 or less. Of these genes, 49 show higher frequencies of disruptive de novo variants in individuals ascertained to have severe neurodevelopmental delay, whereas 53 show higher frequencies in individuals ascertained to have ASD; comparing ASD cases with mutations in these groups reveals phenotypic differences. Expressed early in brain development, most risk genes have roles in regulation of gene expression or neuronal communication (i.e., mutations effect neurodevelopmental and neurophysiological changes), and 13 fall within loci recurrently hit by copy number variants. In cells from the human cortex, expression of risk genes is enriched in excitatory and inhibitory neuronal lineages, consistent with multiple paths to an excitatory-inhibitory imbalance underlying ASD.

Abstract: Summary
In response to biotic stress, plants produce suites of highly modified fatty acids that bear unusual chemical functionalities. Despite their chemical complexity and proposed roles in pathogen defense, little is known about the biosynthesis of decorated fatty acids in plants. Falcarindiol is a prototypical acetylenic lipid present in carrot, tomato, and celery that inhibits growth of fungi and human cancer cell lines. Using a combination of untargeted metabolomics and RNA sequencing, we discovered a biosynthetic gene cluster in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) required for falcarindiol production. By reconstituting initial biosynthetic steps in a heterologous host and generating transgenic pathway mutants in tomato, we demonstrate a direct role of the cluster in falcarindiol biosynthesis and resistance to fungal and bacterial pathogens in tomato leaves. This work reveals a mechanism by which plants sculpt their lipid pool in response to pathogens and provides critical insight into the complex biochemistry of alkynyl lipid production.

Abstract: Summary
Cytosine methylation of DNA is a widespread modification of DNA that plays numerous critical roles. In the yeast Cryptococcus neoformans, CG methylation occurs in transposon-rich repeats and requires the DNA methyltransferase Dnmt5. We show that Dnmt5 displays exquisite maintenance-type specificity in vitro and in vivo and utilizes similar in vivo cofactors as the metazoan maintenance methylase Dnmt1. Remarkably, phylogenetic and functional analysis revealed that the ancestral species lost the gene for a de novo methylase, DnmtX, between 50–150 mya. We examined how methylation has persisted since the ancient loss of DnmtX. Experimental and comparative studies reveal efficient replication of methylation patterns in C. neoformans, rare stochastic methylation loss and gain events, and the action of natural selection. We propose that an epigenome has been propagated for >50 million years through a process analogous to Darwinian evolution of the genome.

Abstract: Summary
Selective autophagy of organelles is critical for cellular differentiation, homeostasis, and organismal health. Autophagy of the ER (ER-phagy) is implicated in human neuropathy but is poorly understood beyond a few autophagosomal receptors and remodelers. By using an ER-phagy reporter and genome-wide CRISPRi screening, we identified 200 high-confidence human ER-phagy factors. Two pathways were unexpectedly required for ER-phagy. First, reduced mitochondrial metabolism represses ER-phagy, which is opposite of general autophagy and is independent of AMPK. Second, ER-localized UFMylation is required for ER-phagy to repress the unfolded protein response via IRE1α. The UFL1 ligase is brought to the ER surface by DDRGK1 to UFMylate RPN1 and RPL26 and preferentially targets ER sheets for degradation, analogous to PINK1-Parkin regulation during mitophagy. Our data provide insight into the cellular logic of ER-phagy, reveal parallels between organelle autophagies, and provide an entry point to the relatively unexplored process of degrading the ER network.

Abstract: Summary
Canonical mRNA translation in eukaryotes begins with the formation of the 43S pre-initiation complex (PIC). Its assembly requires binding of initiator Met-tRNAiMet and several eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) to the small ribosomal subunit (40S). Compared to their mammalian hosts, trypanosomatids present significant structural differences in their 40S, suggesting substantial variability in translation initiation. Here, we determine the structure of the 43S PIC from Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite causing Chagas disease. Our structure shows numerous specific features, such as the variant eIF3 structure and its unique interactions with the large rRNA expansion segments (ESs) 9S, 7S, and 6S, and the association of a kinetoplastid-specific DDX60-like helicase. It also reveals the 40S-binding site of the eIF5 C-terminal domain and structures of key terminal tails of several conserved eIFs underlying their activities within the PIC. Our results are corroborated by glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays in both human and T. cruzi and mass spectrometry data.

Abstract: Summary
Cognitive dysfunction and reactive microglia are hallmarks of traumatic brain injury (TBI), yet whether these cells contribute to cognitive deficits and secondary inflammatory pathology remains poorly understood. Here, we show that removal of microglia from the mouse brain has little effect on the outcome of TBI, but inducing the turnover of these cells through either pharmacologic or genetic approaches can yield a neuroprotective microglial phenotype that profoundly aids recovery. The beneficial effects of these repopulating microglia are critically dependent on interleukin-6 (IL-6) trans-signaling via the soluble IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and robustly support adult neurogenesis, specifically by augmenting the survival of newborn neurons that directly support cognitive function. We conclude that microglia in the mammalian brain can be manipulated to adopt a neuroprotective and pro-regenerative phenotype that can aid repair and alleviate the cognitive deficits arising from brain injury.

Abstract: Summary
The mystery of general anesthesia is that it specifically suppresses consciousness by disrupting feedback signaling in the brain, even when feedforward signaling and basic neuronal function are left relatively unchanged. The mechanism for such selectiveness is unknown. Here we show that three different anesthetics have the same disruptive influence on signaling along apical dendrites in cortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons in mice. We found that optogenetic depolarization of the distal apical dendrites caused robust spiking at the cell body under awake conditions that was blocked by anesthesia. Moreover, we found that blocking metabotropic glutamate and cholinergic receptors had the same effect on apical dendrite decoupling as anesthesia or inactivation of the higher-order thalamus. If feedback signaling occurs predominantly through apical dendrites, the cellular mechanism we found would explain not only how anesthesia selectively blocks this signaling but also why conscious perception depends on both cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical connectivity.

Abstract: Summary
During chronic infection, the inflammatory cytokine interferon gamma (IFNγ) damages hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) by disrupting quiescence and promoting excessive terminal differentiation. However, the mechanism by which IFNγ hinders HSC quiescence remains undefined. Using intravital 3-dimensional microscopy, we find that IFNγ disrupts the normally close interaction between HSCs and CXCL12-abundant reticular (CAR) cells in the HSC niche. IFNγ stimulation increases expression of the cell surface protein BST2, which we find is required for IFNγ-dependent HSC relocalization and activation. IFNγ stimulation of HSCs increases their E-selectin binding by BST2 and homing to the bone marrow, which depends on E-selectin binding. Upon chronic infection, HSCs from mice lacking BST2 are more quiescent and more resistant to depletion than HSCs from wild-type mice. Overall, this study defines a critical mechanism by which IFNγ promotes niche relocalization and activation in response to inflammatory stimulation and identifies BST2 as a key regulator of HSC quiescence.

Abstract: Summary
Plants are foundational for global ecological and economic systems, but most plant proteins remain uncharacterized. Protein interaction networks often suggest protein functions and open new avenues to characterize genes and proteins. We therefore systematically determined protein complexes from 13 plant species of scientific and agricultural importance, greatly expanding the known repertoire of stable protein complexes in plants. By using co-fractionation mass spectrometry, we recovered known complexes, confirmed complexes predicted to occur in plants, and identified previously unknown interactions conserved over 1.1 billion years of green plant evolution. Several novel complexes are involved in vernalization and pathogen defense, traits critical for agriculture. We also observed plant analogs of animal complexes with distinct molecular assemblies, including a megadalton-scale tRNA multi-synthetase complex. The resulting map offers a cross-species view of conserved, stable protein assemblies shared across plant cells and provides a mechanistic, biochemical framework for interpreting plant genetics and mutant phenotypes.

Abstract: Summary
Store-operated Orai1 calcium channels function as highly Ca2+-selective ion channels and are broadly expressed in many tissues including the central nervous system, but their contributions to cognitive processing are largely unknown. Here, we report that many measures of synaptic, cellular, and behavioral models of learning are markedly attenuated in mice lacking Orai1 in forebrain excitatory neurons. Results with focal glutamate uncaging in hippocampal neurons support an essential role of Orai1 channels in amplifying NMDA-receptor-induced dendritic Ca2+ transients that drive activity-dependent spine morphogenesis and long-term potentiation at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses. Consistent with these signaling roles, mice lacking Orai1 in pyramidal neurons (but not interneurons) exhibit striking deficits in working and associative memory tasks. These findings identify Orai1 channels as essential regulators of dendritic spine Ca2+ signaling, synaptic plasticity, and cognition.

Abstract: Summary
Altering ubiquitination by disruption of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) affects hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance. However, comprehensive knowledge of DUB function during hematopoiesis in vivo is lacking. Here, we systematically inactivate DUBs in mouse hematopoietic progenitors using in vivo small hairpin RNA (shRNA) screens. We find that multiple DUBs may be individually required for hematopoiesis and identify ubiquitin-specific protease 15 (USP15) as essential for HSC maintenance in vitro and in transplantations and Usp15 knockout (KO) mice in vivo. USP15 is highly expressed in human hematopoietic tissues and leukemias. USP15 depletion in murine progenitors and leukemia cells impairs in vitro expansion and increases genotoxic stress. In leukemia cells, USP15 interacts with and stabilizes FUS (fused in sarcoma), a known DNA repair factor, directly linking USP15 to the DNA damage response (DDR). Our study underscores the importance of DUBs in preserving normal hematopoiesis and uncovers USP15 as a critical DUB in safeguarding genome integrity in HSCs and leukemia cells.

One key aspect of epigenetic inheritance is that chromatin structures can be stably inherited through generations after the removal of the signals that establish such structures. In fission yeast, the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway is critical for the targeting of histone methyltransferase Clr4 to pericentric repeats to establish heterochromatin. However, pericentric heterochromatin cannot be properly inherited in the absence of RNAi, suggesting the existence of mechanisms that counteract chromatin structure inheritance. Here, we show that mutations of components of the INO80 chromatin-remodeling complex allow pericentric heterochromatin inheritance in RNAi mutants. The ability of INO80 to counter heterochromatin inheritance is attributed to one subunit, Iec5, which promotes histone turnover at heterochromatin but has little effects on nucleosome positioning at heterochromatin, gene expression, or the DNA damage response. These analyses demonstrate the importance of the INO80 chromatin-remodeling complex in controlling heterochromatin inheritance and maintaining the proper heterochromatin landscape of the genome.

Abstract: Summary
Responsiveness to external cues is a hallmark of biological systems. In complex environments, it is crucial for organisms to remain responsive to specific inputs even as other internal or external factors fluctuate. Here, we show how the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans can discriminate between different food levels to modulate its lifespan despite temperature perturbations. This end-to-end robustness from environment to physiology is mediated by food-sensing neurons that communicate via transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and serotonin signals to form a multicellular gene network. Specific regulations in this network change sign with temperature to maintain similar food responsiveness in the lifespan output. In contrast to robustness of stereotyped outputs, our findings uncover a more complex robustness process involving the higher order function of discrimination in food responsiveness. This process involves rewiring a multicellular network to compensate for temperature and provides a basis for understanding gene-environment interactions. Together, our findings unveil sensory computations that integrate environmental cues to govern physiology.

Abstract: Summary
Dicistrovirus intergenic region internal ribosomal entry sites (IGR IRESs) do not require initiator tRNA, an AUG codon, or initiation factors and jumpstart translation from the middle of the elongation cycle via formation of IRES/80S complexes resembling the pre-translocation state. eEF2 then translocates the [codon-anticodon]-mimicking pseudoknot I (PKI) from ribosomal A sites to P sites, bringing the first sense codon into the decoding center. Halastavi árva virus (HalV) contains an IGR that is related to previously described IGR IRESs but lacks domain 2, which enables these IRESs to bind to individual 40S ribosomal subunits. By using in vitro reconstitution and cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), we now report that the HalV IGR IRES functions by the simplest initiation mechanism that involves binding to 80S ribosomes such that PKI is placed in the P site, so that the A site contains the first codon that is directly accessible for decoding without prior eEF2-mediated translocation of PKI.

Abstract: Summary
Cytokines are highly pleiotropic ligands that regulate the immune response. Here, using interleukin-6 (IL-6) as a model system, we perform detailed phosphoproteomic and transcriptomic studies in human CD4+ T helper 1 (Th-1) cells to address the molecular bases defining cytokine functional pleiotropy. We identify CDK8 as a negative regulator of STAT3 transcriptional activities, which interacts with STAT3 upon IL-6 stimulation. Inhibition of CDK8 activity, using specific small molecule inhibitors, reduces the IL-6-induced phosphoproteome by 23% in Th-1 cells, including STAT3 S727 phosphorylation. STAT3 binding to target DNA sites in the genome is increased upon CDK8 inhibition, which results in a concomitant increase in STAT3-mediated transcriptional activity. Importantly, inhibition of CDK8 activity under Th-17 polarizing conditions results in an enhancement of Th-17 differentiation. Our results support a model where CDK8 regulates STAT3 transcriptional processivity by modulation of its gene loci resident time, critically contributing to diversification of IL-6 responses.

Abstract: Summary
The anti-tumor potency of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPis) has been linked to trapping of PARP1 on damaged chromatin. However, little is known about their impact on PARP2, an isoform with overlapping functions at DNA lesions. Whether the release of PARP1/2 from DNA lesions is actively catalyzed by molecular machines is also not known. We found that PARPis robustly trap PARP2 and that the helicase ALC1 (CHD1L) is strictly required for PARP2 release. Catalytic inactivation of ALC1 quantitatively traps PARP2 but not PARP1. ALC1 manipulation impacts the response to single-strand DNA breaks through PARP2 trapping, potentiates PARPi-induced cancer cell killing, and mediates synthetic lethality upon BRCA deficiency. The chromatin remodeler ALC1 actively drives PARP2 turnover from DNA lesions, and PARP2 contributes to the cellular responses of PARPi. This suggests that disrupting the ATP-fueled remodeling forces of ALC1 might enable therapies that selectively target the DNA repair functions of PARPs in cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Proteins are essential agents of biological processes. To date, large-scale profiling of cell line collections including the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) has focused primarily on genetic information whereas deep interrogation of the proteome has remained out of reach. Here, we expand the CCLE through quantitative profiling of thousands of proteins by mass spectrometry across 375 cell lines from diverse lineages to reveal information undiscovered by DNA and RNA methods. We observe unexpected correlations within and between pathways that are largely absent from RNA. An analysis of microsatellite instable (MSI) cell lines reveals the dysregulation of specific protein complexes associated with surveillance of mutation and translation. These and other protein complexes were associated with sensitivity to knockdown of several different genes. These data in conjunction with the wider CCLE are a broad resource to explore cellular behavior and facilitate cancer research.

Abstract: Summary
Plasma cells provide high-affinity antibodies against invading pathogens. Although transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms have been extensively studied for plasma cell differentiation, how these mechanisms respond to environmental cues remains largely unexplored. In this study, we show that ascorbic acid (vitamin C), an essential nutrient, is able to promote plasma cell differentiation and humoral immune response by enhancing TET2/3-mediated DNA demethylation. Ascorbic acid treatment during B cell activation has persistent effects on later plasma cell differentiation by predisposing germinal center B cells toward the plasma cell lineage. Conversely, ascorbic acid deficiency in vivo blocks plasma cell differentiation and attenuates the humoral immune response following antigen immunization. We further demonstrate that such effects of ascorbic acid on plasma cell differentiation require DNA methylcytosine oxidases TET2 and TET3. Our study thus reveals a previously uncharacterized link between essential nutrients and epigenetic regulation of plasma cell differentiation and humoral immune response.

Abstract: Summary
The γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC) is an essential regulator of centrosomal and acentrosomal microtubule formation, yet its structure is not known. Here, we present a cryo-EM reconstruction of the native human γ-TuRC at ∼3.8 Å resolution, revealing an asymmetric, cone-shaped structure. Pseudo-atomic models indicate that GCP4, GCP5, and GCP6 form distinct Y-shaped assemblies that structurally mimic GCP2/GCP3 subcomplexes distal to the γ-TuRC “seam.” We also identify an unanticipated structural bridge that includes an actin-like protein and spans the γ-TuRC lumen. Despite its asymmetric architecture, the γ-TuRC arranges γ-tubulins into a helical geometry poised to nucleate microtubules. Diversity in the γ-TuRC subunits introduces large (>100,000 Å2) surfaces in the complex that allow for interactions with different regulatory factors. The observed compositional complexity of the γ-TuRC could self-regulate its assembly into a cone-shaped structure to control microtubule formation across diverse contexts, e.g., within biological condensates or alongside existing filaments.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria and lysosomes are functionally linked, and their interdependent decline is a hallmark of aging and disease. Despite the long-standing connection between these organelles, the function(s) of lysosomes required to sustain mitochondrial health remains unclear. Here, working in yeast, we show that the lysosome-like vacuole maintains mitochondrial respiration by spatially compartmentalizing amino acids. Defects in vacuole function result in a breakdown in intracellular amino acid homeostasis, which drives age-related mitochondrial decline. Among amino acids, we find that cysteine is most toxic for mitochondria and show that elevated non-vacuolar cysteine impairs mitochondrial respiration by limiting intracellular iron availability through an oxidant-based mechanism. Cysteine depletion or iron supplementation restores mitochondrial health in vacuole-impaired cells and prevents mitochondrial decline during aging. These results demonstrate that cysteine toxicity is a major driver of age-related mitochondrial deterioration and identify vacuolar amino acid compartmentation as a cellular strategy to minimize amino acid toxicity.

Abstract: Summary
Glioblastomas exhibit vast inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity, complicating the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Current in vitro models are limited in preserving the cellular and mutational diversity of parental tumors and require a prolonged generation time. Here, we report methods for generating and biobanking patient-derived glioblastoma organoids (GBOs) that recapitulate the histological features, cellular diversity, gene expression, and mutational profiles of their corresponding parental tumors. GBOs can be generated quickly with high reliability and exhibit rapid, aggressive infiltration when transplanted into adult rodent brains. We further demonstrate the utility of GBOs to test personalized therapies by correlating GBO mutational profiles with responses to specific drugs and by modeling chimeric antigen receptor T cell immunotherapy. Our studies show that GBOs maintain many key features of glioblastomas and can be rapidly deployed to investigate patient-specific treatment strategies. Additionally, our live biobank establishes a rich resource for basic and translational glioblastoma research.

Abstract: Summary
In C. elegans, expression of the UPRER transcription factor xbp-1s in neurons cell non-autonomously activates the UPRER in the intestine, leading to enhanced proteostasis and lifespan. To better understand this signaling pathway, we isolated neurons from animals expressing neuronal xbp-1s for transcriptomic analysis, revealing a striking remodeling of transcripts involved in neuronal signaling. We then identified signaling molecules required for cell non-autonomous intestinal UPRER activation, including the biogenic amine tyramine. Expression of xbp-1s in just two pairs of neurons that synthesize tyramine, the RIM and RIC interneurons, induced intestinal UPRER activation and extended longevity, and exposure to stress led to splicing and activation of xbp-1 in these neurons. In addition, we found that neuronal xbp-1s modulates feeding behavior and reproduction, dependent upon tyramine synthesis. XBP-1s therefore remodels neuronal signaling to coordinately modulate intestinal physiology and stress-responsive behavior, functioning as a global regulator of organismal responses to stress.

Abstract: Summary
Human gut development requires the orchestrated interaction of differentiating cell types. Here, we generate an in-depth single-cell map of the developing human intestine at 6–10 weeks post-conception. Our analysis reveals the transcriptional profile of cycling epithelial precursor cells; distinct from LGR5-expressing cells. We propose that these cells may contribute to differentiated cell subsets via the generation of LGR5-expressing stem cells and receive signals from surrounding mesenchymal cells. Furthermore, we draw parallels between the transcriptomes of ex vivo tissues and in vitro fetal organoids, revealing the maturation of organoid cultures in a dish. Lastly, we compare scRNA-seq profiles from pediatric Crohn’s disease epithelium alongside matched healthy controls to reveal disease-associated changes in the epithelial composition. Contrasting these with the fetal profiles reveals the re-activation of fetal transcription factors in Crohn’s disease. Our study provides a resource available at www.gutcellatlas.org, and underscores the importance of unraveling fetal development in understanding disease.

Abstract: Summary
KCNQ1, also known as Kv7.1, is a voltage-dependent K+ channel that regulates gastric acid secretion, salt and glucose homeostasis, and heart rhythm. Its functional properties are regulated in a tissue-specific manner through co-assembly with beta subunits KCNE1–5. In non-excitable cells, KCNQ1 forms a complex with KCNE3, which suppresses channel closure at negative membrane voltages that otherwise would close it. Pore opening is regulated by the signaling lipid PIP2. Using cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), we show that KCNE3 tucks its single-membrane-spanning helix against KCNQ1, at a location that appears to lock the voltage sensor in its depolarized conformation. Without PIP2, the pore remains closed. Upon addition, PIP2 occupies a site on KCNQ1 within the inner membrane leaflet, which triggers a large conformational change that leads to dilation of the pore’s gate. It is likely that this mechanism of PIP2 activation is conserved among Kv7 channels.

Abstract: Summary
Technologies to reprogram cell-type specification have revolutionized the fields of regenerative medicine and disease modeling. Currently, the selection of fate-determining factors for cell reprogramming applications is typically a laborious and low-throughput process. Therefore, we use high-throughput pooled CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) screens to systematically map human neuronal cell fate regulators. We utilize deactivated Cas9 (dCas9)-based gene activation to target 1,496 putative transcription factors (TFs) in the human genome. Using a reporter of neuronal commitment, we profile the neurogenic activity of these factors in human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), leading to a curated set of pro-neuronal factors. Activation of pairs of TFs reveals neuronal cofactors, including E2F7, RUNX3, and LHX8, that improve conversion efficiency, subtype specificity, and maturation of neuronal cell types. Finally, using multiplexed gene regulation with orthogonal CRISPR systems, we demonstrate improved neuronal differentiation with concurrent activation and repression of target genes, underscoring the power of CRISPR-based gene regulation for programming complex cellular phenotypes.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian tissues engage in specialized physiology that is regulated through reversible modification of protein cysteine residues by reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS regulate a myriad of biological processes, but the protein targets of ROS modification that drive tissue-specific physiology in vivo are largely unknown. Here, we develop Oximouse, a comprehensive and quantitative mapping of the mouse cysteine redox proteome in vivo. We use Oximouse to establish several paradigms of physiological redox signaling. We define and validate cysteine redox networks within each tissue that are tissue selective and underlie tissue-specific biology. We describe a common mechanism for encoding cysteine redox sensitivity by electrostatic gating. Moreover, we comprehensively identify redox-modified disease networks that remodel in aged mice, establishing a systemic molecular basis for the long-standing proposed links between redox dysregulation and tissue aging. We provide the Oximouse compendium as a framework for understanding mechanisms of redox regulation in physiology and aging.

Abstract: Summary
Consumption of glucosinolates, pro-drug-like metabolites abundant in Brassica vegetables, has been associated with decreased risk of certain cancers. Gut microbiota have the ability to metabolize glucosinolates, generating chemopreventive isothiocyanates. Here, we identify a genetic and biochemical basis for activation of glucosinolates to isothiocyanates by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a prominent gut commensal species. Using a genome-wide transposon insertion screen, we identified an operon required for glucosinolate metabolism in B. thetaiotaomicron. Expression of BT2159-BT2156 in a non-metabolizing relative, Bacteroides fragilis, resulted in gain of glucosinolate metabolism. We show that isothiocyanate formation requires the action of BT2158 and either BT2156 or BT2157 in vitro. Monocolonization of mice with mutant BtΔ2157 showed reduced isothiocyanate production in the gastrointestinal tract. These data provide insight into the mechanisms by which a common gut bacterium processes an important dietary nutrient.

Abstract: Summary
Repeated exposure to pathogens or their antigens triggers anamnestic antibody responses that are higher in magnitude and affinity than the primary response. These involve reengagement of memory B cell (MBC) clones, the diversity and specificity of which determine the breadth and effectiveness of the ensuing antibody response. Using prime-boost models in mice, we find that secondary responses are characterized by a clonality bottleneck that restricts the engagement of the large diversity of MBC clones generated by priming. Rediversification of mutated MBCs is infrequent within secondary germinal centers (GCs), which instead consist predominantly of B cells without prior GC experience or detectable clonal expansion. Few MBC clones, generally derived from higher-affinity germline precursors, account for the majority of secondary antibody responses, while most primary-derived clonal diversity is not reengaged detectably by boosting. Understanding how to counter this bottleneck may improve our ability to elicit antibodies to non-immunodominant epitopes by vaccination.

Abstract: Summary
The chromatin protein positive coactivator 4 (PC4) has multiple functions, including chromatin compaction. However, its role in immune cells is largely unknown. We show that PC4 orchestrates chromatin structure and gene expression in mature B cells. B-cell-specific PC4-deficient mice show impaired production of antibody upon antigen stimulation. The PC4 complex purified from B cells contains the transcription factors (TFs) IKAROS and IRF4. IKAROS protein is reduced in PC4-deficient mature B cells, resulting in de-repression of their target genes in part by diminished interactions with gene-silencing components. Upon activation, the amount of IRF4 protein is not increased in PC4-deficient B cells, resulting in reduction of plasma cells. Importantly, IRF4 reciprocally induces PC4 expression via a super-enhancer. PC4 knockdown in human B cell lymphoma and myeloma cells reduces IKAROS protein as an anticancer drug, lenalidomide. Our findings establish PC4 as a chromatin regulator of B cells and a possible therapeutic target adjoining IKAROS in B cell malignancies.

Abstract: Summary
Cortical layer 1 (L1) interneurons have been proposed as a hub for attentional modulation of underlying cortex, but the transformations that this circuit implements are not known. We combined genetically targeted voltage imaging with optogenetic activation and silencing to study the mechanisms underlying sensory processing in mouse barrel cortex L1. Whisker stimuli evoked precisely timed single spikes in L1 interneurons, followed by strong lateral inhibition. A mild aversive stimulus activated cholinergic inputs and evoked a bimodal distribution of spiking responses in L1. A simple conductance-based model that only contained lateral inhibition within L1 recapitulated the sensory responses and the winner-takes-all cholinergic responses, and the model correctly predicted that the network would function as a spatial and temporal high-pass filter for excitatory inputs. Our results demonstrate that all-optical electrophysiology can reveal basic principles of neural circuit function in vivo and suggest an intuitive picture for how L1 transforms sensory and modulatory inputs.
