Abstract: Summary
Early responses to vaccination are important for shaping both humoral and cellular protective immunity. Dissecting innate vaccine signatures may predict immunogenicity to help optimize the efficacy of mRNA and other vaccine strategies. Here, we characterize the cytokine and chemokine responses to the 1st and 2nd dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA (Pfizer/BioNtech) vaccine in antigen-naive and in previously coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-infected individuals (NCT04743388). Transient increases in interleukin-15 (IL-15) and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) levels early after boost correlate with Spike antibody levels, supporting their use as biomarkers of effective humoral immunity development in response to vaccination. We identify a systemic signature including increases in IL-15, IFN-γ, and IP-10/CXCL10 after the 1st vaccination, which were enriched by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and IL-6 after the 2nd vaccination. In previously COVID-19-infected individuals, a single vaccination results in both strong cytokine induction and antibody titers similar to the ones observed upon booster vaccination in antigen-naive individuals, a result with potential implication for future public health recommendations.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanical signals from the tumor microenvironment modulate cell mechanics and influence cell metabolism to promote cancer aggressiveness. Cells withstand external forces by adjusting the stiffness of their cytoskeleton. Microtubules (MTs) act as compression-bearing elements. Yet how cancer cells regulate MT dynamic in response to the locally constrained environment has remained unclear. Using breast cancer as a model of a disease in which mechanical signaling promotes disease progression, we show that matrix stiffening rewires glutamine metabolism to promote MT glutamylation and force MT stabilization, thereby promoting cell invasion. Pharmacologic inhibition of glutamine metabolism decreased MT glutamylation and affected their mechanical stabilization. Similarly, decreased MT glutamylation by overexpressing tubulin mutants lacking glutamylation site(s) decreased MT stability, thereby hampering cancer aggressiveness in vitro and in vivo. Together, our results decipher part of the enigmatic tubulin code that coordinates the fine-tunable properties of MT and link cell metabolism to MT dynamics and cancer aggressiveness.

Abstract: Summary
Coordination between cell differentiation and proliferation during development requires the balance between asymmetric and symmetric modes of cell division. However, the cellular intrinsic cue underlying the choice between these two division modes remains elusive. Here, we show evidence in Caenorhabditis elegans that the invariable lineage of the division modes is specified by the balance between antagonizing complexes of partitioning-defective (PAR) proteins. By uncoupling unequal inheritance of PAR proteins from that of fate determinants during cell division, we demonstrate that changes in the balance between PAR-2 and PAR-6 can be sufficient to re-program the division modes from symmetric to asymmetric and vice versa in two daughter cells. The division mode adopted occurs independently of asymmetry in cytoplasmic fate determinants, cell-size asymmetry, and cell-cycle asynchrony between sister cells. We propose that the balance between PAR proteins represents an intrinsic self-organizing cue for the specification of the two division modes during development.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) relies on the elongation factors PAF1 complex (PAF), RTF1, and SPT6. Here, we use rapid factor depletion and multi-omics analysis to investigate how these elongation factors influence RNA Pol II elongation activity in human cells. Whereas depletion of PAF subunits PAF1 and CTR9 has little effect on cellular RNA synthesis, depletion of RTF1 or SPT6 strongly compromises RNA Pol II activity, albeit in fundamentally different ways. RTF1 depletion decreases RNA Pol II velocity, whereas SPT6 depletion impairs RNA Pol II progression through nucleosomes. These results show that distinct elongation factors stimulate either RNA Pol II velocity or RNA Pol II progression through chromatin in vivo. Further analysis provides evidence for two distinct barriers to early elongation: the promoter-proximal pause site and the +1 nucleosome. It emerges that the first barrier enables loading of elongation factors that are required to overcome the second and subsequent barriers to transcription.

Abstract: Summary
The recent advent of CRISPR and other molecular tools enabled the reconstruction of cell lineages based on induced DNA mutations and promises to solve the ones of more complex organisms. To date, no lineage reconstruction algorithms have been rigorously examined for their performance and robustness across dataset types and number of cells. To benchmark such methods, we decided to organize a DREAM challenge using in vitro experimental intMEMOIR recordings and in silico data for a C. elegans lineage tree of about 1,000 cells and a Mus musculus tree of 10,000 cells. Some of the 22 approaches submitted had excellent performance, but structural features of the trees prevented optimal reconstructions. Using smaller sub-trees as training sets proved to be a good approach for tuning algorithms to reconstruct larger trees. The simulation and reconstruction methods here generated delineate a potential way forward for solving larger cell lineage trees such as in mouse.

Abstract: Summary
Exocrine secretion commonly employs micron-scale vesicles that fuse to a limited apical surface, presenting an extreme challenge for maintaining membrane homeostasis. Using Drosophila melanogaster larval salivary glands, we show that the membranes of fused vesicles undergo actomyosin-mediated folding and retention, which prevents them from incorporating into the apical surface. In addition, the diffusion of proteins and lipids between the fused vesicle and the apical surface is limited. Actomyosin contraction and membrane crumpling are essential for recruiting clathrin-mediated endocytosis to clear the retained vesicular membrane. Finally, we also observe membrane crumpling in secretory vesicles of the mouse exocrine pancreas. We conclude that membrane sequestration by crumpling followed by targeted endocytosis of the vesicular membrane, represents a general mechanism of exocytosis that maintains membrane homeostasis in exocrine tissues that employ large secretory vesicles.

Abstract: Summary
The combination of PD-L1 inhibitor durvalumab and PARP inhibitor olaparib added to standard paclitaxel neoadjuvant chemotherapy (durvalumab/olaparib/paclitaxel [DOP]) was investigated in the phase II I-SPY2 trial of stage II/III HER2-negative breast cancer. Seventy-three participants were randomized to DOP and 299 to standard of care (paclitaxel) control. DOP increased pathologic complete response (pCR) rates in all HER2-negative (20%–37%), hormone receptor (HR)-positive/HER2-negative (14%–28%), and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (27%–47%). In HR-positive/HER2-negative cancers, MammaPrint ultra-high (MP2) cases benefited selectively from DOP (pCR 64% versus 22%), no benefit was seen in MP1 cancers (pCR 9% versus 10%). Overall, 12.3% of patients in the DOP arm experienced immune-related grade 3 adverse events versus 1.3% in control. Gene expression signatures associated with immune response were positively associated with pCR in both arms, while a mast cell signature was associated with non-pCR. DOP has superior efficacy over standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy in HER2-negative breast cancer, particularly in a highly sensitive subset of high-risk HR-positive/HER2-negative patients.

Abstract: Summary
Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-related hepatocellular carcinoma and liver disorders have become the leading causes for the need of liver transplantation in developed countries. Lipotoxicity plays a central role in NASH progression by causing endoplasmic reticulum stress and disrupting protein homeostasis. To identify key molecules that mitigate the detrimental consequences of lipotoxicity, we performed integrative multiomics analysis and identified the E3 ligase tripartite motif 16 (TRIM16) as a candidate molecule. In particular, we found that lipid accumulation and inflammation in a mouse NASH model is mitigated by TRIM16 overexpression but aggravated by its depletion. Multiomics analysis showed that TRIM16 suppressed NASH progression by attenuating the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway; specifically, by preferentially interacting with phospho-TAK1 to promote its degradation. Together, these results identify TRIM16 as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of NASH.

Abstract: Summary
The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway senses cytosolic DNA and induces interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) to activate the innate immune system. Here, we report the unexpected discovery that cGAS also senses dysfunctional protein production. Purified ribosomes interact directly with cGAS and stimulate its DNA-dependent activity in vitro. Disruption of the ribosome-associated protein quality control (RQC) pathway, which detects and resolves ribosome collision during translation, results in cGAS-dependent ISG expression and causes re-localization of cGAS from the nucleus to the cytosol. Indeed, cGAS preferentially binds collided ribosomes in vitro, and orthogonal perturbations that result in elevated levels of collided ribosomes and RQC activation cause sub-cellular re-localization of cGAS and ribosome binding in vivo as well. Thus, translation stress potently increases DNA-dependent cGAS activation. These findings have implications for the inflammatory response to viral infection and tumorigenesis, both of which substantially reprogram cellular protein synthesis.

Abstract: Summary
Crohn’s disease (CD) is a kind of refractory intestinal inflammatory diseases. Pyroptosis was recently identified as a gasdermin-mediated proinflammatory cell death. However, it is unclear whether gasdermin-mediated pyroptosis participates in the pathogenesis of CD. Here, we show that the pyroptosis-inducing fragment GSDME N-terminal is obviously detected in the inflamed colonic mucosa but not in the uninflamed mucosa of patients with CD, suggesting that GSDME-mediated pyroptosis may be correlated with intestinal mucosal inflammation in CD. To investigate the role of GSDME in colitis development, Gsdme−/− mice and wild-type (WT) littermate controls were treated with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) to induce colitis. We found that Gsdme−/− mice exhibit less-severe intestinal inflammation than WT controls do. Furthermore, our results indicate that GSDME-mediated epithelial-cell pyroptosis induces intestinal inflammation through the release of proinflammatory intracellular contents. In summary, we show that GSDME participates in the pathogenesis of CD through GSDME-mediated pyroptosis to release proinflammatory cytokines.

Abstract: Summary
Maintaining a suitable level of sensitivity to environmental cues is crucial for proper function of adult stem cells. Here, we explore how the intrinsic sensitivity of skin hair follicle (HF) progenitors to growth stimuli is dynamically regulated. We discover miR-24 is an miRNA whose expression in HF progenitors inversely correlates with their growth potency in vivo. We show that its upregulation in adult skin epithelium leads to blunted responses of HF progenitors to growth cues and retards hair regeneration, while its conditional ablation leads to hyper-sensitized growth responsiveness of HF progenitors and precocious hair regeneration. Mechanistically, we find that miR-24 limits the intrinsic growth competence of HF progenitor by directly targeting Plk3, whose downregulation leads to reduced expression of CCNE1, a key cyclin for cell-cycle entry. These findings reveal an miRNA-mediated dynamic and cell-intrinsic mechanism used by HF progenitors to adapt their regenerative competence for different physiological conditions.

Abstract: Purpose
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a high-risk type of lung cancer. Raddeanin A exerts anti-tumor activity by regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis, but its role in NSCLC remains to be elucidated. This study was to investigate the effect of raddeanin A in NSCLC and its mechanism.
Methods
The effect of raddeanin A (2, 4, 8, 10 μmol/L) on the viability, proliferation and apoptosis of A549 and H1299 cells was determined by cell counting kit-8, colony formation and flow cytometry assays, respectively. Next, western blot was performed to examine the protein expressions of cleaved caspase-3, Bax, phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (p-STAT3) and STAT3. Subsequently, the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mitochondrial membrane potential of NSCLC cells were detected by 2′, 7′-dichlorofluorescein-diacetate (DCFH-DA) and JC-1 assay. Lastly, the effect of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on the apoptosis, ROS generation, and STAT3 was evaluated by the above-mentioned assays again.
Results
Raddeanin A treatment had no obvious effect on 16HBE cells viability, but it inhibited viability and proliferation of A549 and H1299 cells, promoted the apoptosis, increased the protein expressions of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax, generated intracellular ROS, as well as decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and the expressions of p-STAT3 and STAT3 in A549 and H1299 cells. After cells treated with NAC, the effect of raddeanin A was reversed, as evidenced by the apoptosis and ROS generation were suppressed, and the expression of p-STAT3 was promoted.
Conclusion
Raddeanin A suppressed the proliferation and induced apoptosis of NSCLC cells via promoting the ROS-mediated STAT3 inactivation.

Abstract: Summary
While the intrinsic apoptosis pathway is thought to play a central role in shaping the B cell lineage, its precise role in mature B cell homeostasis remains elusive. Using mice in which mature B cells are unable to undergo apoptotic cell death, we show that apoptosis constrains follicular B (FoB) cell lifespan but plays no role in marginal zone B (MZB) cell homeostasis. In these mice, FoB cells accumulate abnormally. This intensifies intercellular competition for BAFF, resulting in a contraction of the MZB cell compartment, and reducing the growth, trafficking, and fitness of FoB cells. Diminished BAFF signaling dampens the non-canonical NF-κB pathway, undermining FoB cell growth despite the concurrent triggering of a protective p53 response. Thus, MZB and FoB cells exhibit a differential requirement for the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Homeostatic apoptosis constrains the size of the FoB cell compartment, thereby preventing competition-induced FoB cell atrophy.

Abstract: Summary
Neurexins are key organizer molecules that regulate synaptic function and are implicated in autism and schizophrenia. β-neurexins interact with numerous cell adhesion and receptor molecules, but their neuronal localization remains elusive. Using single-molecule tracking and high-resolution microscopy to detect neurexin1β and neurexin3β in primary hippocampal neurons from knockin mice, we demonstrate that endogenous β-neurexins are present in fewer than half of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Moreover, we observe a large extrasynaptic pool of β-neurexins on axons and show that axonal β-neurexins diffuse with higher surface mobility than those transiently confined within synapses. Stimulation of neuronal activity further increases the mobility of synaptic and axonal β-neurexins, whereas inhibition causes the opposite. Blocking ectodomain cleavage by metalloproteases also reduces β-neurexin mobility and enhances glutamate release. These findings suggest that the surface mobility of endogenous β-neurexins inside and outside of synapses is dynamically regulated and linked to neuronal activity.

Abstract: Background
Dermal scaffolds for tissue regeneration are nowadays an effective alternative in not only wound healing surgeries but also breast reconstruction, abdominal wall reconstruction and tendon reinforcement. The present study describes the development of a decellularization protocol applied to human split-thickness skin from cadaveric donors to obtain dermal matrix using an easy and quick procedure.
Methods
Complete split-thickness donor was decellularized through the combination of hypertonic and enzymatic methods. To evaluate the absence of epidermis and dermal cells, and ensure the integrity of the extracellular matrix (ECM) structure, histological analysis was performed. Residual genetic content and ECM biomolecules (collagen, elastin, and glycosaminoglycan) were quantified and tensile strength was tested to measure the effect of the decellularization technique on the mechanical properties of the tissue.
Results
Biomolecules quantification, residual genetic content (below 50 ng/mg dry tissue) and histological structure assessment showed the efficacy of the decellularization process and the preservation of the ECM. The biomechanical tests confirmed the preservation of native properties in the acellular tissue.
Conclusions
The acellular dermal matrix obtained from whole split-thickness skin donor with the newly developed decellualrization protocol, maintains the desired biomechanical and structural properties and represents a viable treatment option for patients.

Abstract: Summary
Cells do not exist in isolation; they continuously act within and react to their environment. And this environment is not static; it continuously adapts and responds to cells. Here, we investigate how vascular structure and function impact emergent cell population behavior using an agent-based model (ABM). Our ABM enables researchers to “mix and match” cell agents, subcellular modules, and microenvironment components ranging from simple nutrient sources to complex, realistic vascular architectures that accurately capture hemodynamics. We use this ABM to highlight the bilateral relationship between cells and nearby vasculature, demonstrate the effect of vascular structure on environmental heterogeneity, and emphasize the non-linear, non-intuitive relationship between vascular function and the behavior of cell populations over time. Our ABM is well suited to characterizing in vitro and in vivo studies, with applications from basic science to translational synthetic biology and medicine. The model is freely available at https://github.com/bagherilab/ARCADE. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic plasticity in cancer cells makes use of metabolism-targeting agents very challenging. Drug-induced metabolic rewiring may, however, uncover vulnerabilities that can be exploited. We report that resistance to glycolysis inhibitor 3-bromopyruvate (3-BrPA) arises from DNA methylation in treated cancer cells and subsequent silencing of the monocarboxylate transporter MCT1. We observe that, unexpectedly, 3-BrPA-resistant cancer cells mostly rely on glycolysis to sustain their growth, with MCT4 as an essential player to support lactate flux. This shift makes cancer cells particularly suited to adapt to hypoxic conditions and resist OXPHOS inhibitors and anti-proliferative chemotherapy. In contrast, blockade of MCT4 activity in 3-BrPA-exposed cancer cells with diclofenac or genetic knockout, inhibits growth of derived spheroids and tumors in mice. This study supports a potential mode of collateral lethality according to which metabolic adaptation of tumor cells to a first-line therapy makes them more responsive to a second-line treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Differentiation and homeostasis of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are tightly controlled by the interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) signaling, yet the mechanisms governing these processes are incompletely understood. Here, we report that transcription factor Bach2 attenuates IL-2R signaling to coordinate Treg differentiation and homeostasis. Bach2 is required for the quiescence, survival, and maintenance of resting Treg cells (rTregs). Unexpectedly, Bach2 directly represses CD25 (IL-2Rα) and subsequently attenuates IL-2R signaling in Tregs. Upregulated CD25/IL-2R signaling in Bach2-deficient rTregs acts as a parallel pathway to partially counteract their poor survival and maintenance. Furthermore, Bach2 suppresses CD25/IL-2R signaling in T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells. Bach2 deficiency in Tregs prevents the formation of highly differentiated Tfr cells, associated with aberrant GC response. Finally, a mild and late onset of autoimmune disease is observed in mice with Bach2-deficient Tregs. Thus, Bach2 balances IL-2R signaling to orchestrate development and homeostasis of various Treg subsets.

Abstract: Summary
The hippocampus is one of two niches in the mammalian brain with persistent neurogenesis into adulthood. The neurogenic capacity of hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs) declines with age, but the molecular mechanisms of this process remain unknown. In this study, we find that fibroblast growth factor 13 (FGF13) is essential for the post-natal neurogenesis in mouse hippocampus, and FGF13 deficiency impairs learning and memory. In particular, we find that FGF13A, the nuclear isoform of FGF13, is involved in the maintenance of NSCs and the suppression of neuronal differentiation during post-natal hippocampal development. Furthermore, we find that FGF13A interacts with ARID1B, a unit of Brahma-associated factor chromatin remodeling complex, and suppresses the expression of neuron differentiation-associated genes through chromatin modification. Our results suggest that FGF13A is an important regulator for maintaining the self-renewal and neurogenic capacity of NSCs in post-natal hippocampus, revealing an epigenomic regulatory function of FGFs in neurogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Enveloped virus entry requires the fusion of cellular and viral membranes, a process directed by their viral fusion glycoproteins. Our current knowledge of this process has been shaped by structural studies of the pre- and post-fusion conformations of these viral fusogens. These structural snapshots have revealed the start and end states necessary for fusion, but the dynamics of the intermediate conformations have remained unclear. Using the influenza C virus hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion glycoprotein as a model, we report the structural and biophysical characterization of a trapped intermediate. Crystallographic studies revealed a structural reorganization of the C terminus to create a second chain reversal region, resulting in the N and C termini being positioned in opposing directions. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and bimane-induced quenching measurements suggest intermediate formation is mediated by conserved hydrophobic residues. Our study reveals a late-stage extended intermediate structural event. This work adds to our understanding of virus cell fusion.

Abstract: Summary
The formation of new vessels requires a tight synchronization between proliferation, differentiation, and sprouting. However, how these processes are differentially activated, often by neighboring endothelial cells (ECs), remains unclear. Here, we identify cell cycle progression as a regulator of EC sprouting and differentiation. Using transgenic zebrafish illuminating cell cycle stages, we show that venous and lymphatic precursors sprout from the cardinal vein exclusively in G1 and reveal that cell-cycle arrest is induced in these ECs by overexpression of p53 and the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors p27 and p21. We further demonstrate that, in vivo, forcing G1 cell-cycle arrest results in enhanced vascular sprouting. Mechanistically, we identify the mitogenic VEGFC/VEGFR3/ERK axis as a direct inducer of cell-cycle arrest in ECs and characterize the cascade of events that render “sprouting-competent” ECs. Overall, our results uncover a mechanism whereby mitogen-controlled cell-cycle arrest boosts sprouting, raising important questions about the use of cell cycle inhibitors in pathological angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Drug development is hampered by poor target selection. Phenotypic screens using neurons differentiated from patient stem cells offer the possibility to validate known and discover novel disease targets in an unbiased fashion. To identify targets for managing hyperexcitability, a pathological feature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we design a multi-step screening funnel using patient-derived motor neurons. High-content live cell imaging is used to evaluate neuronal excitability, and from a screen against a chemogenomic library of 2,899 target-annotated compounds, 67 reduce the hyperexcitability of ALS motor neurons carrying the SOD1(A4V) mutation, without cytotoxicity. Bioinformatic deconvolution identifies 13 targets that modulate motor neuron excitability, including two known ALS excitability modulators, AMPA receptors and Kv7.2/3 ion channels, constituting target validation. We also identify D2 dopamine receptors as modulators of ALS motor neuron excitability. This screen demonstrates the power of human disease cell-based phenotypic screens for identifying clinically relevant targets for neurological disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the cellular composition of the tumor microenvironment and the interactions of the cells is essential to the development of successful immunotherapies in cancer. We perform single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of 9,885 cells isolated from the omentum in 6 patients with ovarian cancer and identify 9 major cell types, including cancer, stromal, and immune cells. Transcriptional analysis of immune cells stratifies our patient samples into 2 groups: (1) high T cell infiltration (high Tinf) and (2) low T cell infiltration (low Tinf). TOX-expressing resident memory CD8+ T (CD8+ Trm) and granulysin-expressing CD4+ T cell clusters are enriched in the high Tinf group. Concurrently, we find unique plasmablast and plasma B cell clusters, and finally, NR1H2+IRF8+ and CD274+ macrophage clusters, suggesting an anti-tumor response in the high Tinf group. Our scRNA-seq study of metastatic tumor samples provides important insights in elucidating the immune response within ovarian tumors.

Abstract: Summary
While misfolding of alpha-synuclein (αSyn) is central to the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD), fundamental questions about its structure and function at the synapse remain unanswered. We examine synaptosomes from non-transgenic and transgenic mice expressing wild-type human αSyn, the E46K fPD-causing mutation, or an amplified form of E46K (“3K”). Synaptosomes from mice expressing the 3K mutant show reduced Ca2+-dependent vesicle exocytosis, altered synaptic vesicle ultrastructure, decreased SNARE complexes, and abnormal levels of certain synaptic proteins. With our intra-synaptosomal nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) method, we reveal that WT αSyn participates in heterogeneous interactions with synaptic components dependent on endogenous αSyn and synaptosomal integrity. The 3K mutation markedly alters these interactions. The synaptic microenvironment is necessary for αSyn to reach its native conformations and establish a physiological interaction network. Its inability to populate diverse conformational ensembles likely represents an early step in αSyn dysfunction that contributes to the synaptotoxicity observed in synucleinopathies.

Abstract: Summary
Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are inactivated by dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs), the activities of which are tightly regulated during cell differentiation. Using knockdown screening and single-cell transcriptional analysis, we demonstrate that DUSP4 is the phosphatase that specifically inactivates p38 kinase to promote megakaryocyte (Mk) differentiation. Mechanistically, PRMT1-mediated methylation of DUSP4 triggers its ubiquitinylation by an E3 ligase HUWE1. Interestingly, the mechanistic axis of the DUSP4 degradation and p38 activation is also associated with a transcriptional signature of immune activation in Mk cells. In the context of thrombocytopenia observed in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), we demonstrate that high levels of p38 MAPK and PRMT1 are associated with low platelet counts and adverse prognosis, while pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK or PRMT1 stimulates megakaryopoiesis. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the role of the PRMT1-DUSP4-p38 axis on Mk differentiation and present a strategy for treatment of thrombocytopenia associated with MDS.

Abstract: Summary
Interleukin-17 (IL-17)-producing γδ (γδ17) T cells are innate-like lymphocytes that contribute to protective anti-microbial responses but are also implicated in pathogenic inflammation at barrier sites. Understanding tissue-specific signals that regulate this subset is important to boost host defense mechanisms, but also to mitigate immunopathology. Here, we demonstrate that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a cyclooxygenase-dependent member of the eicosanoid family, directly enhances cytokine production by circulating and tissue-specific γδ17 T cells in vitro. Gain- and loss-of-function in vivo approaches further reveal that although provision of PGE2 amplifies psoriasiform inflammation, ablation of host mPGES1-dependent PGE2 synthesis is dispensable for cutaneous γδ17 T cell activation. By contrast, loss of endogenous PGE2 production or depletion of the gut microbiota compromises intestinal γδ17 T cell responses and increases disease severity during experimental colitis. Together, our results demonstrate how a lipid mediator can synergize with tissue-specific signals to enhance innate lymphocyte production of IL-17 during barrier inflammation.

Abstract: Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have attracted an interest for personalized cell based therapy along with various other applications. There have been few studies that effective nanomaterial based scaffolds act as alternative to the commonly used feeder dependent in vitro maintenance of iPSCs. The present study provides the fundamental information on ex vivo behavior of canine iPSC (ciPSCs) maintained on carboxylic acid (COOH) functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes (COOH-SWCNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (COOH-MWCNTs) substrates. Here in we evaluated the comparative colony morphology, propagation, characterization, cytocompatibility and differentiation capability of ciPSC cultured on MEF feeder taken as control, and COOH-SWCNTs and COOH-MWCNTs substrates. We observed a healthy growth of ciPSCs on both the types of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) similar to feeder. The ciPSC colonies grown on both CNTs were positive for alkaline phosphatase staining and expressed pluripotent markers with notable significance. Further, the ciPSC colonies grew on these CNTs retained the in vitro differentiation ability into three germ layers as well as cardiac cell. Cytotoxicity analysis revealed that (COOH) functionalized CNTs provided a culture condition of low cytotoxicity. The results of the present study indicated that (COOH) functionalized CNTs could be used as xeno-free substrate to support the maintenance of iPSCs.

Abstract: Summary
In an event reminiscent of eukaryotic ubiquitination, the bacterial prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein (Pup)-proteasome system (PPS) marks target proteins for proteasomal degradation by covalently attaching Pup, the bacterial tagging molecule. Yet, ubiquitin is released from its conjugated target following proteasome binding, whereas Pup enters the proteasome and remains conjugated to the target. Here, we report that although Pup can be degraded by the bacterial proteasome, it lacks favorable 20S core particle (CP) cleavage sites and is thus a very poor 20S CP substrate. Reconstituting the PPS in vitro, we demonstrate that during pupylated protein degradation, Pup can escape unharmed and remain conjugated to a target-derived degradation fragment. Removal of this degradation fragment by Dop, a depupylase, facilitates Pup recycling and re-conjugation to a new target. This study thus offers a mechanistic model for Pup recycling and demonstrates how a lack of protein susceptibility to proteasome-mediated cleavage can play a mechanistic role in a biological system.

Abstract: Summary
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 relies on cellular RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to replicate and spread, although which RBPs control its life cycle remains largely unknown. Here, we employ a multi-omic approach to identify systematically and comprehensively the cellular and viral RBPs that are involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection. We reveal that SARS-CoV-2 infection profoundly remodels the cellular RNA-bound proteome, which includes wide-ranging effects on RNA metabolic pathways, non-canonical RBPs, and antiviral factors. Moreover, we apply a new method to identify the proteins that directly interact with viral RNA, uncovering dozens of cellular RBPs and six viral proteins. Among them are several components of the tRNA ligase complex, which we show regulate SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, we discover that available drugs targeting host RBPs that interact with SARS-CoV-2 RNA inhibit infection. Collectively, our results uncover a new universe of host-virus interactions with potential for new antiviral therapies against COVID-19.

Abstract: Tribbles homolog 2 (TRIB2) is implicated in tumorigenesis and drug resistance in various types of cancers. However, the role of TRIB2 in the regulation of tumorigenesis and drug resistance of cancer stem cells (CSCs) is still elusive. In the present study, we showed increased expression of TRIB2 in spheroid-forming and aldehyde dehydrogenase-positive CSC populations of A2780 epithelial ovarian cancer cells. Short hairpin RNA-mediated silencing of TRIB2 expression attenuates the spheroid-forming, migratory, tumorigenic, and drug-resistant properties of A2780 cells, whereas overexpression of TRIB2 increases the CSC-like characteristics. TRIB2 overexpression induced GSK3β inactivation by augmenting AKT-dependent phosphorylation of GSK3β at Ser9, followed by increasing β-catenin level via reducing the GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of β-catenin. Treatment of TRIB2-ovexpressed A2780 cells with the phosphoinositide-3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 abrogated TRIB2-stimulated proliferation, migration, drug resistance of A2780 cells. These results suggest a critical role for TRIB2 in the regulation of CSC-like properties by increasing the stability of β-catenin protein via the AKT-GSK3β-dependent pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Synchronized activity in neural circuits, detected as oscillations in the extracellular field potential, has been associated with learning and memory. Neural circuits in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), a mid-temporal lobe structure, generate oscillations in specific frequency bands to mediate emotional memory functions. However, how BLA circuits generate oscillations in distinct frequency bands is not known. Of these, sharp-waves (SWs) are repetitive, brief transitions that contain a low-frequency (<20 Hz) envelope, often coupled with ripples (100–300 Hz), have been associated with memory consolidation. Here, we show that SWs are retained in the BLA ex vivo and generated by local circuits. We demonstrate that an action potential in a chandelier interneuron is sufficient to initiate SWs through local circuits. Using a physiologically constrained model, we show that microcircuits organized as chandelier-interneuron-driven modules reproduce SWs and associated cellular events, revealing a functional role for chandelier interneurons and microcircuits for SW generation.

Abstract: DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mechanism affecting genome structure, gene regulation, and the silencing of transposable elements. Cell- and tissue-specific methylation patterns are critical for differentiation and development in eukaryotes. Dynamic spatiotemporal methylation data in these cells or tissues is, therefore, of great interest. However, the construction of bisulfite sequencing libraries can be challenging if the starting material is limited or the genome size is small, such as in Arabidopsis. Here, we describe detailed methods for the purification of Arabidopsis embryos at all stages, and the construction of comprehensive bisulfite libraries from small quantities of input. We constructed bisulfite libraries by releasing embryos from intact seeds, using a different approach for each developmental stage, and manually picking single-embryo with microcapillaries. From these libraries, reliable Arabidopsis methylome data were collected allowing, on average, 11-fold coverage of the genome using as few as five globular, heart, and torpedo embryos as raw input material without the need for DNA purification step. On the other hand, purified DNA from as few as eight bending torpedo embryos or a single mature embryo is sufficient for library construction when RNase A is treated before DNA extraction. This method can be broadly applied to cells from different tissues or cells from other model organisms. Methylome construction can be achieved using a minimal amount of input material using our method; thereby, it has the potential to increase our understanding of dynamic spatiotemporal methylation patterns in model organisms.

Abstract: Summary
Competitive cell interactions play a crucial role in quality control during development and homeostasis. Here, we show that cancer cells use such interactions to actively eliminate wild-type intestine cells in enteroid monolayers and organoids. This apoptosis-dependent process boosts proliferation of intestinal cancer cells. The remaining wild-type population activates markers of primitive epithelia and transits to a fetal-like state. Prevention of this cell-state transition avoids elimination of wild-type cells and, importantly, limits the proliferation of cancer cells. Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling is activated in competing cells and is required for cell-state change and elimination of wild-type cells. Thus, cell competition drives growth of cancer cells by active out-competition of wild-type cells through forced cell death and cell-state change in a JNK-dependent manner.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity is an established risk factor for cancer in many tissues. In the mammalian intestine, a pro-obesity high-fat diet (HFD) promotes regeneration and tumorigenesis by enhancing intestinal stem cell (ISC) numbers, proliferation, and function. Although PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor) nuclear receptor activity has been proposed to facilitate these effects, their exact role is unclear. Here we find that, in loss-of-function in vivo models, PPARα and PPARδ contribute to the HFD response in ISCs. Mechanistically, both PPARs do so by robustly inducing a downstream fatty acid oxidation (FAO) metabolic program. Pharmacologic and genetic disruption of CPT1A (the rate-controlling enzyme of mitochondrial FAO) blunts the HFD phenotype in ISCs. Furthermore, inhibition of CPT1A dampens the pro-tumorigenic consequences of a HFD on early tumor incidence and progression. These findings demonstrate that inhibition of a HFD-activated FAO program creates a therapeutic opportunity to counter the effects of a HFD on ISCs and intestinal tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Dysregulated glycine metabolism is emerging as a common denominator in cardiometabolic diseases, but its contribution to atherosclerosis remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate impaired glycine-oxalate metabolism through alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGXT) in atherosclerosis. As found in patients with atherosclerosis, the glycine/oxalate ratio is decreased in atherosclerotic mice concomitant with suppression of AGXT. Agxt deletion in apolipoprotein E-deficient (Apoe−/−) mice decreases the glycine/oxalate ratio and increases atherosclerosis with induction of hepatic pro-atherogenic pathways, predominantly cytokine/chemokine signaling and dysregulated redox homeostasis. Consistently, circulating and aortic C-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) and superoxide in lesional macrophages are increased. Similar findings are observed following dietary oxalate overload in Apoe−/− mice. In macrophages, oxalate induces mitochondrial dysfunction and superoxide accumulation, leading to increased CCL5. Conversely, AGXT overexpression in Apoe−/− mice increases the glycine/oxalate ratio and decreases aortic superoxide, CCL5, and atherosclerosis. Our findings uncover dysregulated oxalate metabolism via suppressed AGXT as a driver and therapeutic target in atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Piezo1, a calcium-permeable non-selective cationic channel that senses mechanical stimulation in multicellular organisms, mediates various biological processes, including angiogenesis. The supply of nutrients and oxygen through newly formed blood vessels at the fractured lesion is critical for bone fracture repair. The elucidation of the underlying mechanisms involved in angiogenesis and bone repair can aid in improving fracture healing. Here, mice with endothelial cell-specific deletion of Piezo1 channels were used to examine the role of Piezo1 in the initiation of fracture healing. The expression and distribution of Piezo1 was explored in the vasculature of the bone. The deletion of endothelial Piezo1 resulted in impaired bone fracture repair, downregulation of calcium-activated proteolytic calpain activity during vascularization, inhibition of osteoblast maturation and ossification, downregulation of phosphorylated PI3K-AKT, and impaired Notch signaling during bone fracture union. These findings indicated that Piezo1 protein is a potential target for enhancing bone regeneration and treating delayed or nonunion bone fractures.

Abstract: Summary
Glucose is arguably the most important molecule in metabolism, and its dysregulation underlies diabetes. We describe a family of single-wavelength genetically encoded glucose sensors with a high signal-to-noise ratio, fast kinetics, and affinities varying over four orders of magnitude (1 μM to 10 mM). The sensors allow mechanistic characterization of glucose transporters expressed in cultured cells with high spatial and temporal resolution. Imaging of neuron/glia co-cultures revealed ∼3-fold faster glucose changes in astrocytes. In larval Drosophila central nervous system explants, intracellular neuronal glucose fluxes suggested a rostro-caudal transport pathway in the ventral nerve cord neuropil. In zebrafish, expected glucose-related physiological sequelae of insulin and epinephrine treatments were directly visualized. Additionally, spontaneous muscle twitches induced glucose uptake in muscle, and sensory and pharmacological perturbations produced large changes in the brain. These sensors will enable rapid, high-resolution imaging of glucose influx, efflux, and metabolism in behaving animals.

Abstract: Summary
Figure-ground segregation, the brain’s ability to group related features into stable perceptual entities, is crucial for auditory perception in noisy environments. The neuronal mechanisms for this process are poorly understood in the auditory system. Here, we report figure-ground modulation of multi-unit activity (MUA) in the primary and non-primary auditory cortex of rhesus macaques. Across both regions, MUA increases upon presentation of auditory figures, which consist of coherent chord sequences. We show increased activity even in the absence of any perceptual decision, suggesting that neural mechanisms for perceptual grouping are, to some extent, independent of behavioral demands. Furthermore, we demonstrate differences in figure encoding between more anterior and more posterior regions; perceptual saliency is represented in anterior cortical fields only. Our results suggest an encoding of auditory figures from the earliest cortical stages by a rate code.

Abstract: Mitochondria play crucial roles during oocyte development. In this study, we have investigated mitochondrial morphology, mtDNA, Ca2+-ATP enzyme activity, and mitochondrial fission factor (mff) expression levels during oogenesis of the silver pomfret Pampus argenteus. The mtDNA increased with oocyte development, and mitochondrial morphology and distribution were stage-specific. In the perinucleolar oocytes, oval mitochondria were dispersed in the cytoplasm. In previtellogenic oocytes, mitochondria massively increased and aggregated, forming mitochondrial clouds. At the same time, two morphologically different types of mitochondria had been distinguished, one of which was elongated with well-developed cristae, and the other was round with distorted and fused cristae. During vitellogenesis, the increases in mitochondria with well-developed cristae and in Ca2+-ATPase enzymatic activity were accompanied by an accumulation of yolk substance, suggesting the possible participation of mitochondria in the formation of vitellogenesis. Furthermore, we examined the cDNA of mff its transcript levels in relation to oocyte development. The transcript levels of mff were high in the perinucleolar stage, increasing to the highest level at the previtellogenic stage. Immunocytochemistry showed that MFF was detected in the cytoplasm of previtellogenic and midvitellogenic oocytes. We speculated that the mff-mediated mitochondrial fission may play a crucial role in oocyte development, especially in vitellogenesis.

Abstract: Psoriasis is an immune-mediated chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by erythema, scales, and infiltration of the skin, which causes deleterious effects on patient quality of life. TRP channel played important roles in the generation and conductance of itch signal . According to our results, psoriasis induced itch was TRPV4 dependent, and TRPV4 expression in both epidermis and DRG were up-regulated in psoriasis. Thus, TRPV4 is an attractive candidate for treating psoriasis induced itch. Cimifugin is a common compound in antipruritic Chinese medicine. In our study, GSK1016790A, a TRPV4 channel specific agonist, induced acute itch was inhibited by cimifugin in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, cimifugin treatment reduced the scratching behavior and reversed the TRPV4 up-regulation induced by psoriasis. In particular, cimifugin decreased GSK1016790A induced calcium response both in HaCaT cells and DRG neurons. Importantly, in TRPV4 transfected HEK293 cells, GSK101 induced calcium response was also significantly inhibited by cimifugin pretreatment. Consistent with our calcium imaging result, cimifugin pretreatment also inhibited GSK101 induced inward currents. Our study delineated a new role of TRPV4 in psoriasis and emphasized the antipruritic effect of cimifugin, which opened a new avenue to itch management in psoriasis.

Abstract: Summary
High-frequency activity bursts in the hippocampus, known as ripples, are thought to support memory consolidation during “offline” states, such as sleep. Recently, human hippocampal ripples have been observed during “online” episodic memory tasks. It remains unclear whether similar ripple activity occurs during other cognitive states, including different types of episodic memory. However, identifying genuine ripple events in the human hippocampus is challenging. To address these questions, spectro-temporal ripple identification was applied to human hippocampal recordings across a variety of cognitive tasks. Overall, ripple attributes were stable across tasks of visual perception and associative memory, with mean rates lower than offline states of rest and sleep. In contrast, while more complex visual attention tasks did not modulate ripple attributes, rates were enhanced for more complex autobiographical memory conditions. Therefore, hippocampal ripples reliably occur across cognitive states but are specifically enhanced during offline states and complex memory processes, consistent with a role in consolidation.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear envelope assembly during late mitosis includes rapid formation of several thousand complete nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). This efficient use of NPC components (nucleoporins or “NUPs”) is essential for ensuring immediate nucleocytoplasmic communication in each daughter cell. We show that octameric subassemblies of outer and inner nuclear pore rings remain intact in the mitotic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) after NPC disassembly during prophase. These “inherited” subassemblies then incorporate into NPCs during post-mitotic pore formation. We further show that the stable subassemblies persist through multiple rounds of cell division and the accompanying rounds of NPC mitotic disassembly and post-mitotic assembly. De novo formation of NPCs from newly synthesized NUPs during interphase will then have a distinct initiation mechanism. We postulate that a yet-to-be-identified modification marks and “immortalizes” one or more components of the specific octameric outer and inner ring subcomplexes that then template post-mitotic NPC assembly during subsequent cell cycles.

Abstract: Summary
Increasing evidence suggests that the reactivation of initially inhibited signaling pathways causes drug resistance. Here, we analyze how network topologies affect signaling responses to drug treatment. Network-dependent drug resistance is commonly attributed to negative and positive feedback loops. However, feedback loops by themselves cannot completely reactivate steady-state signaling. Newly synthesized negative feedback regulators can induce a transient overshoot but cannot fully restore output signaling. Complete signaling reactivation can only occur when at least two routes, an activating and inhibitory, connect an inhibited upstream protein to a downstream output. Irrespective of the network topology, drug-induced overexpression or increase in target dimerization can restore or even paradoxically increase downstream pathway activity. Kinase dimerization cooperates with inhibitor-mediated alleviation of negative feedback. Our findings inform drug development by considering network context and optimizing the design drug combinations. As an example, we predict and experimentally confirm specific combinations of RAF inhibitors that block mutant NRAS signaling.

Abstract: Summary
WhiB7 represents a distinct subclass of transcription factors in the WhiB-Like (Wbl) family, a unique group of iron-sulfur (4Fe-4S] cluster-containing proteins exclusive to the phylum of Actinobacteria. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), WhiB7 interacts with domain 4 of the primary sigma factor (σA4) in the RNA polymerase holoenzyme and activates genes involved in multiple drug resistance and redox homeostasis. Here, we report crystal structures of the WhiB7:σA4 complex alone and bound to its target promoter DNA at 1.55-Å and 2.6-Å resolution, respectively. These structures show how WhiB7 regulates gene expression by interacting with both σA4 and the AT-rich sequence upstream of the −35 promoter DNA via its C-terminal DNA-binding motif, the AT-hook. By combining comparative structural analysis of the two high-resolution σA4-bound Wbl structures with molecular and biochemical approaches, we identify the structural basis of the functional divergence between the two distinct subclasses of Wbl proteins in Mtb.

Abstract: Summary
A body of evidence indicates that metazoan immune and aging pathways are largely interconnected, but the mechanisms involved in their homeostatic control remain unclear. In this study, we find that the PITX (paired-like homeodomain) transcription factor UNC-30 controls the tradeoff between immunity and longevity from the nervous system in Caenorhabditis elegans. PITX/UNC-30 functional loss enhances immunity in a GATA/ELT-2- and p38 MAPK/PMK-1-dependent manner and reduced longevity by activating MXD/MDL-1 and the C2H2-type zinc finger transcription factor PQM-1. The immune inhibitory and longevity stimulatory functions of PITX/UNC-30 require the sensory neuron ASG and a signaling pathway controlled by NPR-1, which is a G protein-coupled receptor related to mammalian neuropeptide Y receptors. Our findings uncover a suppressive role of GABAergic signaling in the neural control of a biological tradeoff where energy is allocated toward immunity at the expense of longevity.

Abstract: Summary
The mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), the highly selective channel responsible for mitochondrial Ca2+ entry, plays important roles in physiology and pathology. However, only few pharmacological compounds directly and selectively modulate its activity. Here, we perform high-throughput screening on a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug library comprising 1,600 compounds to identify molecules modulating mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. We find amorolfine and benzethonium to be positive and negative MCU modulators, respectively. In agreement with the positive effect of MCU in muscle trophism, amorolfine increases muscle size, and MCU silencing is sufficient to blunt amorolfine-induced hypertrophy. Conversely, in the triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, benzethonium delays cell growth and migration in an MCU-dependent manner and protects from ceramide-induced apoptosis, in line with the role of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in cancer progression. Overall, we identify amorolfine and benzethonium as effective MCU-targeting drugs applicable to a wide array of experimental and disease conditions.

Abstract: We investigated the effects of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α on articular cartilage under mechanical stimulation and the associated mechanisms. Chondrocytes, isolated from articular cartilage from the knee, hip, and shoulder joints of Wistar rats, were subjected to 20 % tensile stress under hypoxic (5% O2) conditions for 24 h. HIF-1α and aggrecan expression was significantly enhanced with mechanical stimulation under hypoxia but not significantly altered with mechanical stimulation under normoxia. The nuclear translocation of HIF-1α was enhanced by mechanical stress under hypoxia. Under both normoxia and hypoxia, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs (ADAM-TS) 5 expression was significantly reduced with mechanical stimulation compared to that in the group without mechanical stimulation. However, HIF-1α knockdown mitigated changes in aggrecan and ADAM-TS5 expression mediated by mechanical stimulation under hypoxia. The effects of treadmill running on HIF-1α production in the articular cartilage of rat knee joints were also analyzed. HIF-1α production increased in the moderate running group and decreased to the same levels as those in the control group in the excessive running group. This suggests that HIF-1α regulates aggrecan and ADAM-TS5 expression in response to mechanical stimulation under hypoxia and general mechanical stimulation in articular cartilage under hypoxia, while controlling cartilage homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
The contribution of adipose-derived FGF21 to energy homeostasis is unclear. Here we show that browning of inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) by β-adrenergic agonists requires autocrine FGF21 signaling. Adipose-specific deletion of the FGF21 co-receptor β-Klotho renders mice unresponsive to β-adrenergic stimulation. In contrast, mice with liver-specific ablation of FGF21, which eliminates circulating FGF21, remain sensitive to β-adrenergic browning of iWAT. Concordantly, transgenic overexpression of FGF21 in adipocytes promotes browning in a β-Klotho-dependent manner without increasing circulating FGF21. Mechanistically, we show that β-adrenergic stimulation of thermogenic gene expression requires FGF21 in adipocytes to promote phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ and mobilization of intracellular calcium. Moreover, we find that the β-adrenergic-dependent increase in circulating FGF21 occurs through an indirect mechanism in which fatty acids released by adipocyte lipolysis subsequently activate hepatic PPARα to increase FGF21 expression. These studies identify FGF21 as a cell-autonomous autocrine regulator of adipose tissue function.

Abstract: Summary
Iron overload is positively associated with diabetes risk. However, the role of iron in adipose tissue remains incompletely understood. Here, we report that transferrin-receptor-1-mediated iron uptake is differentially required for distinct subtypes of adipocytes. Notably, adipocyte-specific transferrin receptor 1 deficiency substantially protects mice from high-fat-diet-induced metabolic disorders. Mechanistically, low cellular iron levels have a positive impact on the health of the white adipose tissue and can restrict lipid absorption from the intestine through modulation of vesicular transport in enterocytes following high-fat diet feeding. Specific reduction of adipocyte iron by AAV-mediated overexpression of the iron exporter Ferroportin1 in adult mice effectively mimics these protective effects. In summary, our studies highlight an important role of adipocyte iron in the maintenance of systemic metabolism through an adipocyte-enterocyte axis, offering an additional level of control over caloric influx into the system after feeding by regulating intestinal lipid absorption.

Abstract: Summary
Medulloblastoma (MB) is a malignant pediatric brain tumor arising in the cerebellum. Although abnormal GABAergic receptor activation has been described in MB, studies have not yet elucidated the contribution of receptor-independent GABA metabolism to MB pathogenesis. We find primary MB tumors globally display decreased expression of GABA transaminase (ABAT), the protein responsible for GABA metabolism, compared with normal cerebellum. However, less aggressive WNT and SHH subtypes express higher ABAT levels compared with metastatic G3 and G4 tumors. We show that elevated ABAT expression results in increased GABA catabolism, decreased tumor cell proliferation, and induction of metabolic and histone characteristics mirroring GABAergic neurons. Our studies suggest ABAT expression fluctuates depending on metabolite changes in the tumor microenvironment, with nutrient-poor conditions upregulating ABAT expression. We find metastatic MB cells require ABAT to maintain viability in the metabolite-scarce cerebrospinal fluid by using GABA as an energy source substitute, thereby facilitating leptomeningeal metastasis formation.

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the deadliest primary brain neoplasm, heavily infiltrated with tumor-associated microglia/macrophages (TAM), which has received a great deal of interest. Bearing in mind that the number of peripheral macrophages by the 14th day is negligible, in our study TAM were referred to as microglia. Here we evaluated histopathological characterization of TAM and kinetics of their infiltration in U87 orthotopic GBM, a commonly used model in preclinical research. To mimic different stages of GBM growth, we evaluated three-time points. Our data showed that the highest areal density of TAM was 7 days after GBM inoculation, with ability to proliferate early after initiation of GBM growth. The areal density of TAM within the tumor correlated with GBM growth and proliferation. Moreover, microglia underwent substantial morphological changes upon exposure to GBM cells. A transition from ramified morphology in peritumoral area to ameboid shape with larger soma and shortened, thick branches in the tumor core was observed. Higher areal fraction of blood vessels also correlated with the areal density of TAM. Given these pro-invasive features of microglia, this GBM model represents a good basis for further testing microglia as a target and new strategy to fight with.

Abstract: Summary
The preoptic area (POA) is a key brain region for regulation of body temperature (Tb), dictating thermogenic, cardiovascular, and behavioral responses that control Tb. Previously characterized POA neuronal populations all reduced Tb when activated. Using mice, we now identify POA neurons expressing bombesin-like receptor 3 (POABRS3) as a population whose activation increased Tb; inversely, acute inhibition of these neurons reduced Tb. POABRS3 neurons that project to either the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus or the dorsomedial hypothalamus increased Tb, heart rate, and blood pressure via the sympathetic nervous system. Long-term inactivation of POABRS3 neurons caused increased Tb variability, overshooting both increases and decreases in Tb set point, with RNA expression profiles suggesting multiple types of POABRS3 neurons. Thus, POABRS3 neuronal populations regulate Tb and heart rate, contribute to cold defense, and fine-tune feedback control of Tb. These findings advance understanding of homeothermy, a defining feature of mammalian biology.

Abstract: Summary
The transition of oxidized 5-methylcytosine (5mC) intermediates into the base excision repair (BER) pipeline to complete DNA demethylation remains enigmatic. We report here that UHRF2, the only paralog of UHRF1 in mammals that fails to rescue Uhrf1−/− phenotype, is physically and functionally associated with BER complex. We show that UHRF2 is allosterically activated by 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and acts as a ubiquitin E3 ligase to catalyze K33-linked polyubiquitination of XRCC1. This nonproteolytic action stimulates XRCC1’s interaction with the ubiquitin binding domain-bearing RAD23B, leading to the incorporation of TDG into BER complex. Integrative epigenomic analysis in mouse embryonic stem cells reveals that Uhrf2-fostered TDG-RAD23B-BER complex is functionally linked to the completion of DNA demethylation at active promoters and that Uhrf2 ablation impedes DNA demethylation on latent enhancers that undergo poised-to-active transition during neuronal commitment. Together, these observations highlight an essentiality of 5hmC-switched UHRF2 E3 ligase activity in commissioning the accomplishment of active DNA demethylation.

Abstract: Summary
Language models have recently emerged as a powerful machine-learning approach for distilling information from massive protein sequence databases. From readily available sequence data alone, these models discover evolutionary, structural, and functional organization across protein space. Using language models, we can encode amino-acid sequences into distributed vector representations that capture their structural and functional properties, as well as evaluate the evolutionary fitness of sequence variants. We discuss recent advances in protein language modeling and their applications to downstream protein property prediction problems. We then consider how these models can be enriched with prior biological knowledge and introduce an approach for encoding protein structural knowledge into the learned representations. The knowledge distilled by these models allows us to improve downstream function prediction through transfer learning. Deep protein language models are revolutionizing protein biology. They suggest new ways to approach protein and therapeutic design. However, further developments are needed to encode strong biological priors into protein language models and to increase their accessibility to the broader community.

Abstract: Summary
A metabolic imbalance between lipid synthesis and degradation can lead to hepatic lipid accumulation, a characteristic of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Here, we report that high-fat-diet-induced sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c, a key transcription factor that regulates lipid biosynthesis, impairs autophagic lipid catabolism via altered H2S signaling. SREBP-1c reduced cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE) via miR-216a, which in turn decreased hepatic H2S levels and sulfhydration-dependent activation of Unc-51-like autophagy-activating kinase 1 (ULK1). Furthermore, Cys951Ser mutation of ULK1 decreased autolysosome formation and promoted hepatic lipid accumulation in mice, suggesting that the loss of ULK1 sulfhydration was directly associated with the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Moreover, silencing of CSE in SREBP-1c knockout mice increased liver triglycerides, confirming the connection between CSE, autophagy, and SREBP-1c. Overall, our results uncover a 2-fold mechanism for SREBP-1c-driven hepatic lipid accumulation through reciprocal activation and inhibition of hepatic lipid biosynthesis and degradation, respectively.

Abstract: Summary
CA1 and subiculum (SUB) connect the hippocampus to numerous output regions. Cells in both areas have place-specific firing fields, although they are more dispersed in SUB. Weak responses to head direction and running speed have been reported in both regions. However, how such information is encoded in CA1 and SUB and the resulting impact on downstream targets are poorly understood. Here, we estimate the tuning of simultaneously recorded CA1 and SUB cells to position, head direction, and speed. Individual neurons respond conjunctively to these covariates in both regions, but the degree of mixed representation is stronger in SUB, and more so during goal-directed spatial navigation than free foraging. Each navigational variable could be decoded with higher precision, from a similar number of neurons, in SUB than CA1. The findings point to a possible contribution of mixed-selective coding in SUB to efficient transmission of hippocampal representations to widespread brain regions.

Abstract: Summary
In ribosomopathies, perturbed expression of ribosome components leads to tissue-specific phenotypes. What accounts for such tissue-selective manifestations as a result of mutations in the ribosome, a ubiquitous cellular machine, has remained a mystery. Combining mouse genetics and in vivo ribosome profiling, we observe limb-patterning phenotypes in ribosomal protein (RP) haploinsufficient embryos, and we uncover selective translational changes of transcripts that controlling limb development. Surprisingly, both loss of p53, which is activated by RP haploinsufficiency, and augmented protein synthesis rescue these phenotypes. These findings are explained by the finding that p53 functions as a master regulator of protein synthesis, at least in part, through transcriptional activation of 4E-BP1. 4E-BP1, a key translational regulator, in turn, facilitates selective changes in the translatome downstream of p53, and this thereby explains how RP haploinsufficiency may elicit specificity to gene expression. These results provide an integrative model to help understand how in vivo tissue-specific phenotypes emerge in ribosomopathies.

Abstract: Summary
The human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-bound viral antigens serve as an immunological signature that can be selectively recognized by T cells. As viruses evolve by acquiring mutations, it is essential to identify a range of presented viral antigens. Using HLA peptidomics, we are able to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-derived peptides presented by highly prevalent HLA class I (HLA-I) molecules by using infected cells as well as overexpression of SARS-CoV-2 genes. We find 26 HLA-I peptides and 36 HLA class II (HLA-II) peptides. Among the identified peptides, some are shared between different cells and some are derived from out-of-frame open reading frames (ORFs). Seven of these peptides were previously shown to be immunogenic, and we identify two additional immunoreactive peptides by using HLA multimer staining. These results may aid the development of the next generation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on presented viral-specific antigens that span several of the viral genes.

Abstract: Summary
Depleting the microenvironment of important nutrients such as arginine is a key strategy for immune evasion by cancer cells. Many tumors overexpress arginase, but it is unclear how these cancers, but not T cells, tolerate arginine depletion. In this study, we show that tumor cells synthesize arginine from citrulline by upregulating argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1). Under arginine starvation, ASS1 transcription is induced by ATF4 and CEBPβ binding to an enhancer within ASS1. T cells cannot induce ASS1, despite the presence of active ATF4 and CEBPβ, as the gene is repressed. Arginine starvation drives global chromatin compaction and repressive histone methylation, which disrupts ATF4/CEBPβ binding and target gene transcription. We find that T cell activation is impaired in arginine-depleted conditions, with significant metabolic perturbation linked to incomplete chromatin remodeling and misregulation of key genes. Our results highlight a T cell behavior mediated by nutritional stress, exploited by cancer cells to enable pathological immune evasion.

Abstract: Summary
Preadipocytes dynamically produce sensory cilia. However, the role of primary cilia in preadipocyte differentiation and adipose homeostasis remains poorly understood. We previously identified transition fiber component FBF1 as an essential player in controlling selective cilia import. Here, we establish Fbf1tm1a/tm1a mice and discover that Fbf1tm1a/tm1a mice develop severe obesity, but surprisingly, are not predisposed to adverse metabolic complications. Obese Fbf1tm1a/tm1a mice possess unexpectedly healthy white fat tissue characterized by spontaneous upregulated beiging, hyperplasia but not hypertrophy, and low inflammation along the lifetime. Mechanistically, FBF1 governs preadipocyte differentiation by constraining the beiging program through an AKAP9-dependent, cilia-regulated PKA signaling, while recruiting the BBS chaperonin to transition fibers to suppress the hedgehog signaling-dependent adipogenic program. Remarkably, obese Fbf1tm1a/tm1a mice further fed a high-fat diet are protected from diabetes and premature death. We reveal a central role for primary cilia in the fate determination of preadipocytes and the generation of metabolically healthy fat tissue.

Abstract: Summary
Slow oscillations (≲ 1 Hz), a hallmark of slow-wave sleep and deep anesthesia across species, arise from spatiotemporal patterns of activity whose complexity increases as wakefulness is approached and cognitive functions emerge. The arousal process constitutes an open window to the unknown mechanisms underlying the emergence of such dynamical richness in awake cortical networks. Here, we investigate the changes in network dynamics as anesthesia fades out in the rat visual cortex. Starting from deep anesthesia, slow oscillations gradually increase their frequency, eventually expressing maximum regularity. This stage is followed by the abrupt onset of an infra-slow (~0.2 Hz) alternation between sleep-like oscillations and activated states. A population rate model reproduces this transition driven by an increased excitability that brings it to periodically cross a critical point. Based on our model, dynamical richness emerges as a competition between two metastable attractor states, a conclusion strongly supported by the data.

Abstract: Summary
In the failing heart, the cardiac myocyte microtubule network is remodeled, which contributes to cellular contractile failure and patient death. However, the origins of this deleterious cytoskeletal reorganization are unknown. We now find that oxidative stress, a condition characteristic of heart failure, leads to cysteine oxidation of microtubules. Our electron and fluorescence microscopy experiments revealed regions of structural damage within the microtubule lattice that occurred at locations of oxidized tubulin. The incorporation of GTP-tubulin into these damaged, oxidized regions led to stabilized “hot spots” within the microtubule lattice, which suppressed the shortening of dynamic microtubules. Thus, oxidative stress may act inside of cardiac myocytes to facilitate a pathogenic shift from a sparse microtubule network into a dense, aligned network. Our results demonstrate how a disease condition characterized by oxidative stress can trigger a molecular oxidation event, which likely contributes to a toxic cellular-scale transformation of the cardiac myocyte microtubule network.

Abstract: Summary
Mosaic analysis with double markers (MADM) offers one approach to visualize and concomitantly manipulate genetically defined cells in mice with single-cell resolution. MADM applications include the analysis of lineage, single-cell morphology and physiology, genomic imprinting phenotypes, and dissection of cell-autonomous gene functions in vivo in health and disease. Yet, MADM can only be applied to <25% of all mouse genes on select chromosomes to date. To overcome this limitation, we generate transgenic mice with knocked-in MADM cassettes near the centromeres of all 19 autosomes and validate their use across organs. With this resource, >96% of the entire mouse genome can now be subjected to single-cell genetic mosaic analysis. Beyond a proof of principle, we apply our MADM library to systematically trace sister chromatid segregation in distinct mitotic cell lineages. We find striking chromosome-specific biases in segregation patterns, reflecting a putative mechanism for the asymmetric segregation of genetic determinants in somatic stem cell division.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin is organized in the nucleus via CTCF loops and compartmental domains. Here, we compare different cell types to identify distinct paradigms of compartmental domain formation in human tissues. We identify and quantify compartmental forces correlated with histone modifications characteristic of transcriptional activity and previously underappreciated roles for distinct compartmental domains correlated with the presence of H3K27me3 and H3K9me3, respectively. We present a computer simulation model capable of predicting compartmental organization based on the biochemical characteristics of independent chromatin features. Using this model, we show that the underlying forces responsible for compartmental domain formation in human cells are conserved and that the diverse compartmentalization patterns seen across cell types are due to differences in chromatin features. We extend these findings to Drosophila to suggest that the same principles are at work beyond humans. These results offer mechanistic insights into the fundamental forces driving the 3D organization of the genome.

Abstract: γδ T cell is one of the most important pathogenic immune cells in autoimmunity, especially in mucosal and epithelial diseases. Metabolism is essential for the maintenance of immune homeostasis. However, unlike αβ T cells, the metabolic regulation of γδ T cell activation still remain unclear. Here, we identified glutamine metabolism as a critical regulator for the generation of IL-17-producing γδ T cells. Metabolic screening uncovered that amino acids related to glutamine metabolism increased most obviously during γδ T cell activation. Pharmaceutical blocking of glutamine impaired IL-17 production in γδ T cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanism studies further revealed that genes downregulated upon glutamine deprivation enriched in IL-17 and IL-23/STAT3 signaling pathways. Consistent with this, the activation of STAT3 was suppressed after glutamine blocking. More importantly, application of glutamine antagonist in vivo alleviated the progression of IL-23 induced psoriatic mice model. In addition, both the glutamine level and the expression of glutamine related enzymes were found higher in psoriasis patients when compared with healthy controls. Therefore, our work identified an important metabolic regulatory pathway in γδ T cell activation and suggested that glutamine metabolism could be used as a target for the treatment of γδ T cell related diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity has become a global pandemic. Identification of key factors in adipogenesis helps to tackle obesity and related metabolic diseases. Here, we show that DDB1 binds the histone reader BRWD3 to promote adipogenesis and diet-induced obesity. Although typically recognized as a component of the CUL4-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, DDB1 stimulates adipogenesis independently of CUL4. A DDB1 mutant that does not bind CUL4A or CUL4B fully restores adipogenesis in DDB1-deficient cells. Ddb1+/− mice show delayed postnatal development of white adipose tissues and are protected from diet-induced obesity. Mechanistically, by interacting with BRWD3, DDB1 is recruited to acetylated histones in the proximal promoters of ELK1 downstream immediate early response genes and facilitates the release of paused RNA polymerase II, thereby activating the transcriptional cascade in adipogenesis. Our findings have uncovered a CUL4-independent function of DDB1 in promoting the transcriptional cascade of adipogenesis, development of adipose tissues, and onset of obesity.

Abstract: Summary
Bacterial communities are in a continuous adaptive and evolutionary race for survival. In this work we expand our knowledge on the chemical interplay and specific mutations that modulate the transition from antagonism to co-existence between two plant-beneficial bacteria, Pseudomonas chlororaphis PCL1606 and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42. We reveal that the bacteriostatic activity of bacillaene produced by Bacillus relies on an interaction with the protein elongation factor FusA of P. chlororaphis and how mutations in this protein lead to tolerance to bacillaene and other protein translation inhibitors. Additionally, we describe how the unspecific tolerance of B. amyloliquefaciens to antimicrobials associated with mutations in the glycerol kinase GlpK is provoked by a decrease of Bacillus cell membrane permeability, among other pleiotropic responses. We conclude that nutrient specialization and mutations in basic biological functions are bacterial adaptive dynamics that lead to the coexistence of two primary competitive bacterial species rather than their mutual eradication.

Abstract: Summary
COVID-19 pathology involves dysregulation of diverse molecular, cellular, and physiological processes. To expedite integrated and collaborative COVID-19 research, we completed multi-omics analysis of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, including matched analysis of the whole-blood transcriptome, plasma proteomics with two complementary platforms, cytokine profiling, plasma and red blood cell metabolomics, deep immune cell phenotyping by mass cytometry, and clinical data annotation. We refer to this multidimensional dataset as the COVIDome. We then created the COVIDome Explorer, an online researcher portal where the data can be analyzed and visualized in real time. We illustrate herein the use of the COVIDome dataset through a multi-omics analysis of biosignatures associated with C-reactive protein (CRP), an established marker of poor prognosis in COVID-19, revealing associations between CRP levels and damage-associated molecular patterns, depletion of protective serpins, and mitochondrial metabolism dysregulation. We expect that the COVIDome Explorer will rapidly accelerate data sharing, hypothesis testing, and discoveries worldwide.

Abstract: Summary
The lymphatic vasculature plays important roles in the physiology of the organs in which it resides, though a clear mechanistic understanding of how this crosstalk is mediated is lacking. Here, we performed single-cell transcriptional profiling of human and mouse adipose tissue and found that lymphatic endothelial cells highly express neurotensin (NTS/Nts). Nts expression is reduced by cold and norepinephrine in an α-adrenergic-dependent manner, suggesting a role in adipose thermogenesis. Indeed, NTS treatment of brown adipose tissue explants reduced expression of thermogenic genes. Furthermore, adenoviral-mediated overexpression and knockdown or knockout of NTS in vivo reduced and enhanced cold tolerance, respectively, an effect that is mediated by NTSR2 and ERK signaling. Inhibition of NTSR2 promoted energy expenditure and improved metabolic function in obese mice. These data establish a link between adipose tissue lymphatics and adipocytes with potential therapeutic implications.

Abstract: Summary
Viruses influence the fate of nutrients and human health by killing microorganisms and altering metabolic processes. Organosulfur metabolism and biologically derived hydrogen sulfide play dynamic roles in manifestation of diseases, infrastructure degradation, and essential biological processes. Although microbial organosulfur metabolism is well studied, the role of viruses in organosulfur metabolism is unknown. Here, we report the discovery of 39 gene families involved in organosulfur metabolism encoded by 3,749 viruses from diverse ecosystems, including human microbiomes. The viruses infect organisms from all three domains of life. Six gene families encode for enzymes that degrade organosulfur compounds into sulfide, whereas others manipulate organosulfur compounds and may influence sulfide production. We show that viral metabolic genes encode key enzymatic domains, are translated into protein, and are maintained after recombination, and sulfide provides a fitness advantage to viruses. Our results reveal viruses as drivers of organosulfur metabolism with important implications for human and environmental health.

Abstract: Summary
What regulates the spatiotemporal distribution of cell elimination in tissues remains largely unknown. This is particularly relevant for epithelia with high rates of cell elimination where simultaneous death of neighboring cells could impair epithelial sealing. Here, using the Drosophila pupal notum (a single-layer epithelium) and a new optogenetic tool to trigger caspase activation and cell extrusion, we first showed that death of clusters of at least three cells impaired epithelial sealing; yet, such clusters were almost never observed in vivo. Accordingly, statistical analysis and simulations of cell death distribution highlighted a transient and local protective phase occurring near every cell death. This protection is driven by a transient activation of ERK in cells neighboring extruding cells, which inhibits caspase activation and prevents elimination of cells in clusters. This suggests that the robustness of epithelia with high rates of cell elimination is an emerging property of local ERK feedback.

Abstract: Summary
Several types of pathogenic bacteria produce genotoxins that induce DNA damage in host cells. Accumulating evidence suggests that a central function of these genotoxins is to dysregulate the host’s immune response, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To address this issue, we investigated the effects of the most widely expressed bacterial genotoxin, the cytolethal distending toxin (CDT), on T cells—the key mediators of adaptive immunity. We show that CDT induces premature senescence in activated CD4 T cells in vitro and provide evidence suggesting that infection with genotoxin-producing bacteria promotes T cell senescence in vivo. Moreover, we demonstrate that genotoxin-induced senescent CD4 T cells assume a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) which, at least partly, is orchestrated by the ATM-p38 signaling axis. These findings provide insight into the immunomodulatory properties of bacterial genotoxins and uncover a putative link between bacterial infections and T cell senescence.

Abstract: Summary
We report severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike ΔH69/V70 in multiple independent lineages, often occurring after acquisition of receptor binding motif replacements such as N439K and Y453F, known to increase binding affinity to the ACE2 receptor and confer antibody escape. In vitro, we show that, although ΔH69/V70 itself is not an antibody evasion mechanism, it increases infectivity associated with enhanced incorporation of cleaved spike into virions. ΔH69/V70 is able to partially rescue infectivity of spike proteins that have acquired N439K and Y453F escape mutations by increased spike incorporation. In addition, replacement of the H69 and V70 residues in the Alpha variant B.1.1.7 spike (where ΔH69/V70 occurs naturally) impairs spike incorporation and entry efficiency of the B.1.1.7 spike pseudotyped virus. Alpha variant B.1.1.7 spike mediates faster kinetics of cell-cell fusion than wild-type Wuhan-1 D614G, dependent on ΔH69/V70. Therefore, as ΔH69/V70 compensates for immune escape mutations that impair infectivity, continued surveillance for deletions with functional effects is warranted.

Abstract: Summary
RBM39 is a known splicing factor and coactivator. Here, we report that RBM39 functions as a master transcriptional regulator that interacts with the MLL1 complex to facilitate chromatin binding and H3K4 trimethylation in breast cancer cells. We identify RBM39 functional domains required for DNA and complex binding and show that the loss of RBM39 has widespread effects on H3K4me3 and gene expression, including key oncogenic pathways. RBM39’s RNA recognition motif 3 (RRM3) functions as a dominant-negative domain; namely, it disrupts the complex and H3K4me trimethylation and expression of RBM/MLL1 target genes. RRM3-derived cell-penetrating peptides phenocopy the effects of the loss of RBM39 to decrease growth and survival of all major subtypes of breast cancer and yet are nontoxic to normal cells. These findings establish RBM39/MLL1 as a major contributor to the abnormal epigenetic landscape in breast cancer and lay the foundation for peptide-mediated cancer-specific therapy based on disruption of RBM39 epigenomic functions.

Abstract: Summary
Glutaminase regulates glutaminolysis to promote cancer cell proliferation. However, the mechanism underlying glutaminase activity regulation is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that kidney-type glutaminase (GLS) is highly expressed in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) specimens with correspondingly upregulated glutamine dependence for PDAC cell proliferation. Upon oxidative stress, the succinyl-coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase ADP-forming subunit β (SUCLA2) phosphorylated by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) at S79 dissociates from GLS, resulting in enhanced GLS K311 succinylation, oligomerization, and activity. Activated GLS increases glutaminolysis and the production of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and glutathione, thereby counteracting oxidative stress and promoting tumor cell survival and tumor growth in mice. In addition, the levels of SUCLA2 pS79 and GLS K311 succinylation, which were mutually correlated, were positively associated with advanced stages of PDAC and poor prognosis for patients. Our findings reveal critical regulation of GLS by SUCLA2-coupled GLS succinylation regulation and underscore the regulatory role of metabolites in glutaminolysis and PDAC development.

Abstract: Summary
Projection neuron subtype identities in the cerebral cortex are established by expressing pan-cortical and subtype-specific effector genes that execute terminal differentiation programs bestowing neurons with a glutamatergic neuron phenotype and subtype-specific morphology, physiology, and axonal projections. Whether pan-cortical glutamatergic and subtype-specific characteristics are regulated by the same genes or controlled by distinct programs remains largely unknown. Here, we show that FEZF2 functions as a transcriptional repressor, and it regulates subtype-specific identities of both corticothalamic and subcerebral neurons by selectively repressing expression of genes inappropriate for each neuronal subtype. We report that TLE4, specifically expressed in layer 6 corticothalamic neurons, is recruited by FEZF2 to inhibit layer 5 subcerebral neuronal genes. Together with previous studies, our results indicate that a cortical glutamatergic identity is specified by multiple parallel pathways active in progenitor cells, whereas projection neuron subtype-specific identity is achieved through selectively repressing genes associated with alternate identities in differentiating neurons.

Abstract: Summary
The outer membrane protects Gram-negative bacteria from the host environment. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major outer membrane constituent, has distinct components (lipid A, core, O-antigen) generated by specialized pathways. In this study, we describe the surprising convergence of these pathways through FlmX, an uncharacterized protein in the intracellular pathogen Francisella. FlmX is in the flippase family, which includes proteins that traffic lipid-linked envelope components across membranes. flmX deficiency causes defects in lipid A modification, core remodeling, and O-antigen addition. We find that an F. tularensis mutant lacking flmX is >1,000,000-fold attenuated. Furthermore, FlmX is required to resist the innate antimicrobial LL-37 and the antibiotic polymyxin. Given FlmX’s central role in LPS modification and its conservation in intracellular pathogens Brucella, Coxiella, and Legionella, FlmX may represent a novel drug target whose inhibition could cripple bacterial virulence and sensitize bacteria to innate antimicrobials and antibiotics.

Abstract: The tunicate, Styela plicata (Lesueur, 1823) present an open circulator system with a tubular heart and blood flowing in lacunae among organs, bathing the tissues directly. Blood vascular lacunae are present in the tunica that is situated outside the epidermis and present a fibrous structure. The cells of the tunic are in straight contact with the blood vessels or are highly mobile. Ascidians are considered model organisms in comparative immunology of the chordate, and hold an important phylogenetic position as sister group of vertebrates. In recent years, numerous studies have reported the presence of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in the genome of non-mammalian organisms including invertebrates. Two TLRs, designated Ci‐TLR1 and Ci-TLR2 were expressed in the stomach, intestine and in numerous hemocytes of Ciona intestinalis, demonstrating that these key transmembrane proteins are evolutionarily conserved in ascidians. In this study for the first time, hemocytes aggregates were identified by confocal immunofluorescence techniques, using TLR2 antibody in the tunica of Styela plicata; furthermore, α-Smooth Muscle Actin (α-SMA) expression has been shown in the cells lining the vessels of the tunic. Our results support the view that the TLR-mediated innate immune functions are conserved in ascidian tissues.

Abstract: Summary
To understand how chromatin domains coordinate gene expression, we dissected select genetic elements organizing topology and transcription around the Prdm14 super enhancer in mouse embryonic stem cells. Taking advantage of allelic polymorphisms, we developed methods to sensitively analyze changes in chromatin topology, gene expression, and protein recruitment. We show that enhancer insulation does not rely strictly on loop formation between its flanking boundaries, that the enhancer activates the Slco5a1 gene beyond its prominent domain boundary, and that it recruits cohesin for loop extrusion. Upon boundary inversion, we find that oppositely oriented CTCF terminates extrusion trajectories but does not stall cohesin, while deleted or mutated CTCF sites allow cohesin to extend its trajectory. Enhancer-mediated gene activation occurs independent of paused loop extrusion near the gene promoter. We expand upon the loop extrusion model to propose that cohesin loading and extrusion trajectories originating at an enhancer contribute to gene activation.

Abstract: Summary
Meningioma-1 (MN1) overexpression in AML is associated with poor prognosis, and forced expression of MN1 induces leukemia in mice. We sought to determine how MN1 causes AML. We found that overexpression of MN1 can be induced by translocations that result in hijacking of a downstream enhancer. Structure predictions revealed that the entire MN1 coding frame is disordered. We identified the myeloid progenitor-specific BAF complex as the key interaction partner of MN1. MN1 over-stabilizes BAF on enhancer chromatin, a function directly linked to the presence of a long polyQ-stretch within MN1. BAF over-stabilization at binding sites of transcription factors regulating a hematopoietic stem/progenitor program prevents the developmentally appropriate decommissioning of these enhancers and results in impaired myeloid differentiation and leukemia. Beyond AML, our data detail how the overexpression of a polyQ protein, in the absence of any coding sequence mutation, can be sufficient to cause malignant transformation.

Abstract: Summary
Organogenesis requires exquisite spatiotemporal coordination of cell morphogenesis, migration, proliferation, and differentiation of multiple cell types. For gonads, this involves complex interactions between somatic and germline tissues. During Drosophila ovary morphogenesis, primordial germ cells (PGCs) either are sequestered in stem cell niches and are maintained in an undifferentiated germline stem cell state or transition directly toward differentiation. Here, we identify a mechanism that links hormonal triggers of somatic tissue morphogenesis with PGC differentiation. An early ecdysone pulse initiates somatic swarm cell (SwC) migration, positioning these cells close to PGCs. A second hormone peak activates Torso-like signal in SwCs, which stimulates the Torso receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling pathway in PGCs promoting their differentiation by de-repression of the differentiation gene, bag of marbles. Thus, systemic temporal cues generate a transitory signaling center that coordinates ovarian morphogenesis with stem cell self-renewal and differentiation programs, highlighting a more general role for such centers in reproductive and developmental biology.

Abstract: Summary
Somatic DNA copy number variations (CNVs) are prevalent in cancer and can drive cancer progression, albeit with often uncharacterized roles in altering cell signaling states. Here, we integrate genomic and proteomic data for 5,598 tumor samples to identify CNVs leading to aberrant signal transduction. The resulting associations recapitulate known kinase-substrate relationships, and further network analysis prioritizes likely causal genes. Of the 303 significant associations we identify from the pan-tumor analysis, 43% are replicated in cancer cell lines, including 44 robust gene-phosphosite associations identified across multiple tumor types. Several predicted regulators of hippo signaling are experimentally validated. Using RNAi, CRISPR, and drug screening data, we find evidence of kinase addiction in cancer cell lines, identifying inhibitors for targeting of kinase-dependent cell lines. We propose copy number status of genes as a useful predictor of differential impact of kinase inhibition, a strategy that may be of use in the future for anticancer therapies.

Abstract: Summary
T regulatory (Treg) cells are crucial to maintain immune tolerance and repress antitumor immunity, but the mechanisms governing their cellular redox homeostasis remain elusive. We report that glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4) prevents Treg cells from lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis in regulating immune homeostasis and antitumor immunity. Treg-specific deletion of Gpx4 impairs immune homeostasis without substantially affecting survival of Treg cells at steady state. Loss of Gpx4 results in excessive accumulation of lipid peroxides and ferroptosis of Treg cells upon T cell receptor (TCR)/CD28 co-stimulation. Neutralization of lipid peroxides and blockade of iron availability rescue ferroptosis of Gpx4-deficient Treg cells. Moreover, Gpx4-deficient Treg cells elevate generation of mitochondrial superoxide and production of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) that facilitates T helper 17 (TH17) responses. Furthermore, Treg-specific ablation of Gpx4 represses tumor growth and concomitantly potentiates antitumor immunity. Our studies establish a crucial role for Gpx4 in protecting activated Treg cells from lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis and offer a potential therapeutic strategy to improve cancer treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Klebsiella pneumoniae ST258 is a human pathogen associated with poor outcomes worldwide. We identify a member of the acyltransferase superfamily 3 (atf3), enriched within the ST258 clade, that provides a major competitive advantage for the proliferation of these organisms in vivo. Comparison of a wild-type ST258 strain (KP35) and a Δatf3 isogenic mutant generated by CRISPR-Cas9 targeting reveals greater NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase transcription and ATP generation, fueled by increased glycolysis. The acquisition of atf3 induces changes in the bacterial acetylome, promoting lysine acetylation of multiple proteins involved in central metabolism, specifically Zwf (glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase). The atf3-mediated metabolic boost leads to greater consumption of glucose in the host airway and increased bacterial burden in the lung, independent of cytokine levels and immune cell recruitment. Acquisition of this acyltransferase enhances fitness of a K. pneumoniae ST258 isolate and may contribute to the success of this clonal complex as a healthcare-associated pathogen.

Abstract: Summary
N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) on mRNAs mediates different biological processes and its dysregulation contributes to tumorigenesis. How m6A dictates its diverse molecular and cellular effects in leukemias remains unknown. We found that YTHDC1 is the essential m6A reader in myeloid leukemia from a genome-wide CRISPR screen and that m6A is required for YTHDC1 to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation and form nuclear YTHDC1-m6A condensates (nYACs). The number of nYACs increases in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells compared with normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. AML cells require the nYACs to maintain cell survival and the undifferentiated state that is critical for leukemia maintenance. Furthermore, nYACs enable YTHDC1 to protect m6A-mRNAs from the PAXT complex and exosome-associated RNA degradation. Collectively, m6A is required for the formation of a nuclear body mediated by phase separation that maintains mRNA stability and control cancer cell survival and differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
The immune response to a chronic viral infection is uniquely tailored to balance viral control and immunopathology. The role of myeloid cells in shaping the response to chronic viral infection, however, is poorly understood. We perform single-cell RNA sequencing of myeloid cells during acute and chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection to address this question. Our analysis identifies a cluster of suppressive neutrophils that is enriched in chronic infection. Furthermore, suppressive neutrophils highly express the gene encoding Proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus-1 (PIM1), a kinase known to promote mitochondrial fitness and cell survival. Pharmacological inhibition of PIM1 selectively diminishes suppressive neutrophil-mediated immunosuppression without affecting the function of monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs). Decreased accumulation of suppressive neutrophils leads to increased CD8 T cell function and viral control. Mechanistically, PIM kinase activity is required for maintaining fused mitochondrial networks in suppressive neutrophils, but not in M-MDSCs, and loss of PIM kinase function causes increased suppressive neutrophil apoptosis.

Abstract: Summary
RNA helicases play critical roles in various biological processes, including serving as viral RNA sensors in innate immunity. Here, we find that RNA helicase DEAH-box helicase 15 (DHX15) is essential for type I interferon (IFN-I, IFN-β), type III IFN (IFN-λ3), and inflammasome-derived cytokine IL-18 production by intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in response to poly I:C and RNA viruses with preference of enteric RNA viruses, but not DNA virus. Importantly, we generate IEC-specific Dhx15-knockout mice and demonstrate that DHX15 is required for controlling intestinal inflammation induced by enteric RNA virus rotavirus in suckling mice and reovirus in adult mice in vivo, which owes to impaired IFN-β, IFN-λ3, and IL-18 production in IECs from Dhx15-deficient mice. Mechanistically, DHX15 interacts with NLRP6 to trigger NLRP6 inflammasome assembly and activation for inducing IL-18 secretion in IECs. Collectively, our report reveals critical roles for DHX15 in sensing enteric RNA viruses in IECs and controlling intestinal inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Mucus-secreting goblet cells are the dominant cell type in pulmonary diseases, e.g., asthma and cystic fibrosis (CF), leading to pathologic mucus metaplasia and airway obstruction. Cytokines including IL-13 are the major players in the transdifferentiation of club cells into goblet cells. Unexpectedly, we have uncovered a previously undescribed pathway promoting mucous metaplasia that involves VEGFa and its receptor KDR. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis coupled with genetic mouse modeling demonstrates that loss of epithelial VEGFa, KDR, or MEK/ERK kinase promotes excessive club-to-goblet transdifferentiation during development and regeneration. Sox9 is required for goblet cell differentiation following Kdr inhibition in both mouse and human club cells. Significantly, airway mucous metaplasia in asthmatic and CF patients is also associated with reduced KDR signaling and increased SOX9 expression. Together, these findings reveal an unexpected role for VEGFa/KDR signaling in the defense against mucous metaplasia, offering a potential therapeutic target for this common airway pathology.

Abstract: Summary
Responding to different dynamic levels of stress is critical for mammalian survival. Disruption of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling is proposed to underlie hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation observed in stress-related psychiatric disorders. In this study, we show that FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP5) plays a critical role in fine-tuning MR:GR balance in the hippocampus. Biotinylated-oligonucleotide immunoprecipitation in primary hippocampal neurons reveals that MR binding, rather than GR binding, to the Fkbp5 gene regulates FKBP5 expression during baseline activity of glucocorticoids. Notably, FKBP5 and MR exhibit similar hippocampal expression patterns in mice and humans, which are distinct from that of the GR. Pharmacological inhibition and region- and cell type-specific receptor deletion in mice further demonstrate that lack of MR decreases hippocampal Fkbp5 levels and dampens the stress-induced increase in glucocorticoid levels. Overall, our findings demonstrate that MR-dependent changes in baseline Fkbp5 expression modify GR sensitivity to glucocorticoids, providing insight into mechanisms of stress homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
As a critical machinery for rapid pathogen removal, resident memory T cells (TRMs) are locally generated after the initial encounter. However, their development accompanying tumorigenesis remains elusive. Using a murine breast cancer model, we show that TRMs develop in the tumor, the contralateral mammary mucosa, and the pre-metastatic lung. Single-cell RNA sequencing of TRMs reveals two phenotypically distinct populations representing their active versus quiescent phases. These TRMs in different tissue compartments share the same TCR clonotypes and transcriptomes with a subset of intratumoral effector/effector memory T cells (TEff/EMs), indicating their developmental ontogeny. Furthermore, CXCL16 is highly produced by tumor cells and CXCR6− TEff/EMs are the major subset preferentially egressing the tumor to form distant TRMs. Functionally, releasing CXCR6 retention in the primary tumor amplifies tumor-derived TRMs in the lung and leads to superior protection against metastases. This immunologic fortification suggests a potential strategy to prevent metastasis in clinical oncology.

The assay is established through targeting specific metabolic pathways and using “input” and “output” metabolite pairs. The changes in the extracellular output that are generated and released into the extracellular media from the input are assessed as the activity of the pathway. The screening for the glycolytic pathway and amino acid metabolism reveals the activities of the present drugs, 6-BIO and regorafenib, that regulate the metabolic fate of tumor cells.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the tremendous success of super-resolution microscopy, multi-color in vivo applications are still rare. Here we present live-cell multi-label STED microscopy in vivo and in vitro by combining spectrally separated excitation and detection with temporal sequential imaging of reversibly switchable fluorescent proteins (RSFPs). Triple-label STED microscopy resolves pre- and postsynaptic nano-organizations in vivo in mouse visual cortex employing EGFP, Citrine, and the RSFP rsEGP2. Combining the positive and negative switching RSFPs Padron and Dronpa-M159T enables dual-label STED microscopy. All labels are recorded quasi-simultaneously by parallelized on- and off-switching of the RSFPs within the fast-scanning axis. Depletion is performed by a single STED beam so that all channels automatically co-align. Such an addition of a second or third marker merely requires a switching laser, minimizing setup complexity. Our technique enhances in vivo STED microscopy, making it a powerful tool for studying multiple synaptic nano-organizations or the tripartite synapse in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
HIV monoclonal antibodies for viral reservoir eradication strategies will likely need to recognize reactivated infected cells and potently drive Fc-mediated innate effector cell activity. We systematically characterize a library of 185 HIV-envelope-specific antibodies derived from 15 spontaneous HIV controllers (HCs) that selectively exhibit robust serum Fc functionality and compared them to broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) in clinical development. Within the 10 antibodies with the broadest cell-recognition capability, seven originated from HCs and three were bNAbs. V3-loop-targeting antibodies are enriched among the top cell binders, suggesting the V3-loop may be selectively exposed and accessible on the cell surface. Fc functionality is more variable across antibodies, which is likely influenced by distinct binding topology and corresponding Fc accessibility, highlighting not only the importance of target-cell recognition but also the need to optimize for Fc-mediated elimination. Ultimately, our results demonstrate that this comprehensive selection process can identify monoclonal antibodies poised to eliminate infected cells.

Abstract: Summary
Sensory neurons relay gut-derived signals to the brain, yet the molecular and functional organization of distinct populations remains unclear. Here, we employed intersectional genetic manipulations to probe the feeding and glucoregulatory function of distinct sensory neurons. We reconstruct the gut innervation patterns of numerous molecularly defined vagal and spinal afferents and identify their downstream brain targets. Bidirectional chemogenetic manipulations, coupled with behavioral and circuit mapping analysis, demonstrated that gut-innervating, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP1R)-expressing vagal afferents relay anorexigenic signals to parabrachial nucleus neurons that control meal termination. Moreover, GLP1R vagal afferent activation improves glucose tolerance, and their inhibition elevates blood glucose levels independent of food intake. In contrast, gut-innervating, GPR65-expressing vagal afferent stimulation increases hepatic glucose production and activates parabrachial neurons that control normoglycemia, but they are dispensable for feeding regulation. Thus, distinct gut-innervating sensory neurons differentially control feeding and glucoregulatory neurocircuits and may provide specific targets for metabolic control.

Abstract: Summary
The TSC complex is a critical negative regulator of the small GTPase Rheb and mTORC1 in cellular stress signaling. The TSC2 subunit contains a catalytic GTPase activating protein domain and interacts with multiple regulators, while the precise function of TSC1 is unknown. Here we provide a structural characterization of TSC1 and define three domains: a C-terminal coiled-coil that interacts with TSC2, a central helical domain that mediates TSC1 oligomerization, and an N-terminal HEAT repeat domain that interacts with membrane phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs). TSC1 architecture, oligomerization, and membrane binding are conserved in fungi and humans. We show that lysosomal recruitment of the TSC complex and subsequent inactivation of mTORC1 upon starvation depend on the marker lipid PI3,5P2, demonstrating a role for lysosomal PIPs in regulating TSC complex and mTORC1 activity via TSC1.

Abstract: Summary
Cell death events continuously challenge epithelial barrier function yet are crucial to eliminate old or critically damaged cells. How such apoptotic events are spatio-temporally organized to maintain epithelial homeostasis remains unclear. We observe waves of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and AKT serine/threonine kinase (Akt) activity pulses that originate from apoptotic cells and propagate radially to healthy surrounding cells. This requires epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) signaling. At the single-cell level, ERK/Akt waves act as spatial survival signals that locally protect cells in the vicinity of the epithelial injury from apoptosis for a period of 3–4 h. At the cell population level, ERK/Akt waves maintain epithelial homeostasis (EH) in response to mild or intense environmental insults. Disruption of this spatial signaling system results in the inability of a model epithelial tissue to ensure barrier function in response to environmental insults.

Abstract: Summary
To identify therapeutic targets for KRAS mutant pancreatic cancer, we conduct a druggable genome small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen and determine that suppression of BCAR1 sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells to ERK inhibition. Integrative analysis of genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screens also identify BCAR1 as a top synthetic lethal interactor with mutant KRAS. BCAR1 encodes the SRC substrate p130Cas. We determine that SRC-inhibitor-mediated suppression of p130Cas phosphorylation impairs MYC transcription through a DOCK1-RAC1-β-catenin-dependent mechanism. Additionally, genetic suppression of TUBB3, encoding the βIII-tubulin subunit of microtubules, or pharmacological inhibition of microtubule function decreases levels of MYC protein in a calpain-dependent manner and potently sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells to ERK inhibition. Accordingly, the combination of a dual SRC/tubulin inhibitor with an ERK inhibitor cooperates to reduce MYC protein and synergistically suppress the growth of KRAS mutant pancreatic cancer. Thus, we demonstrate that mechanistically diverse combinations with ERK inhibition suppress MYC to impair pancreatic cancer proliferation.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial respiratory complex subunits assemble in supercomplexes. Studies of supercomplexes have typically relied upon antibody-based quantification, often limited to a single subunit per respiratory complex. To provide a deeper insight into mitochondrial and supercomplex plasticity, we combine native electrophoresis and mass spectrometry to determine the supercomplexome of skeletal muscle from sedentary and exercise-trained mice. We quantify 422 mitochondrial proteins within 10 supercomplex bands in which we show the debated presence of complexes II and V. Exercise-induced mitochondrial biogenesis results in non-stoichiometric changes in subunits and incorporation into supercomplexes. We uncover the dynamics of supercomplex-related assembly proteins and mtDNA-encoded subunits after exercise. Furthermore, exercise affects the complexing of Lactb, an obesity-associated mitochondrial protein, and ubiquinone biosynthesis proteins. Knockdown of ubiquinone biosynthesis proteins leads to alterations in mitochondrial respiration. Our approach can be applied to broad biological systems. In this instance, comprehensively analyzing respiratory supercomplexes illuminates previously undetectable complexity in mitochondrial plasticity.

Abstract: Summary
Gut microbiota educate the local and distal immune system in early life to imprint long-term immunological outcomes while maintaining the capacity to dynamically modulate the local mucosal immune system throughout life. It is unknown whether gut microbiota provide signals that dynamically regulate distal immune responses following an extra-gastrointestinal infection. We show here that gut bacteria composition correlated with the severity of malaria in children. Using the murine model of malaria, we demonstrate that parasite burden and spleen germinal center reactions are malleable to dynamic cues provided by gut bacteria. Whereas antibiotic-induced changes in gut bacteria have been associated with immunopathology or impairment of immunity, the data demonstrate that antibiotic-induced changes in gut bacteria can enhance immunity to Plasmodium. This effect is not universal but depends on baseline gut bacteria composition. These data demonstrate the dynamic communications that exist among gut bacteria, the gut-distal immune system, and control of Plasmodium infection.

Abstract: In vertebrate eyes, the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) provides structural and functional homeostasis to the retina. The RPE takes up retinol (ROL) to be dehydrogenated and isomerized to 11-cis-retinaldehyde (11-cis-RAL), which is a functional photopigment in mammalian photoreceptors. As excessive ROL is toxic, the RPE must also establish mechanisms to protect against ROL toxicity. Here, we found that the levels of retinol dehydrogenases (RDHs) are commonly decreased in phosphatase tensin homolog (Pten)-deficient mouse RPE, which degenerates due to elevated ROL and that can be rescued by feeding a ROL-free diet. We also identified that RDH gene expression is regulated by forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors, which are inactivated by hyperactive Akt in the Pten-deficient mouse RPE. Together, our findings suggest that a homeostatic pathway comprising PTEN, FOXO, and RDH can protect the RPE from ROL toxicity.
