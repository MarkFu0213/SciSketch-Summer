Abstract: Summary
An electron-hole droplet is a unique form of matter that occurs as a metallic phase in semiconductors, and its formation has been almost exclusively linked to cryogenic condensation of long-lived excitons. Creating room-temperature electron-hole droplets in semiconductors has remained an outstanding challenge. Here, we report plausible spectroscopic indications of a cloud of room-temperature electron-hole droplets in optically excited CH3NH3PbBr3 single crystals. Droplet characters shown by the excitation threshold and optical hysteresis are demonstrated. The observed two-stage photoluminescence decaying histogram indicates rapid thermal dissociation of room-temperature excitons into hot electron-hole plasma vapor and subsequent droplet nucleation toward a metastable size. Our study sheds light on the vapor-to-liquid phase evolution in optically excited crystal bulk of direct band gap semiconductors and paves the way for further exploration toward intriguing optoelectronic and valleytronic applications.

Abstract: Summary
Applying additives to perovskite precursor solutions is an effective way to passivate perovskite films for the construction of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with increased power-conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and enhanced stabilities. Ionic liquids (ILs) with halide anions have been applied as additives. Here, we report the application of imidazolium-based ILs, containing the nitrile functionality in the cation and chloride anion, as additives for triple-cation (Cs+, formamidinium [FA+], methylammonium [MA+]) PSCs. We found that a Cl-I exchange takes place between the I− anion of the triple-cation precursors and the Cl− anion of the IL. The fabricated PSCs containing perovskite films with the ILs show high PCEs (in the best case 22.86%) and high stabilities, with the unencapsulated devices retaining about 95% of their original efficiencies after 1,000 h. The mechanistic basis for the passivation effect of the IL additives in the perovskite films is described.

Abstract: Summary
Chelating lability significantly hinders the development of Mn(II)-based magnetic resonance image (MRI) contrast agents. Herein, using 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N’,N’’,N’’’-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) as a chelating unit, we show that multinuclear Mn(II) united-DOTA chelates are of up to 69-fold higher inertness than Magnevist, a clinical Gd-based contrast agent. The unusual inertness could be ascribed to the multiplexed uniting of Mn(II) chelates, which is illustrated by a series of controlled studies on model compounds. Besides, molecular longitudinal relaxivities of Mn(II) united-DOTA chelates are 17–167 times higher than those of mononuclear Mn(II) complexes. Dynamic in vivo MRI experiments further reveal that Mn(II) united-DOTA complexes could provide more substantial and persistent contrast enhancement than both Mn-DOTA and Magnevist. Our efforts not only demonstrate that multinuclear Mn(II) united-DOTA complexes are a superior alternative to Gd-based contrast agents, but also highlight the significance of chelate unification as a simple yet powerful strategy for the construction of high-performance Mn(II)-based contrast agents.

Abstract: Eukaryotic gene expression is controlled at multiple steps that work in harmony to ensure proper maintenance of cellular morphology and function. Such regulatory mechanisms would include transcriptional gene regulation, which is in turn controlled by chromatin remodeling, distinct topologically associating domains of the chromatin structure, cis-regulatory elements such as enhancers and promoters, action of trans-acting factors, DNA methylation, RNA modifications, and post-translational modification of histones. These guiding mechanisms of gene expression play critical roles in the epigenetic setting of individual cells within the eukaryotic systems. Some epigenetic factors may play multiple functional roles in guarding the accurate gene expression program of the eukaryotic cells, especially within the central nervous system. A well-studied example of such multi-functional factors is the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2), a nuclear protein that is encoded by the X-linked MECP2 gene. Here, we aim to provide an overview of eukaryotic gene regulation, the three-dimensional chromatin organization, standard techniques to study newly synthesized RNA transcripts, and the role of MeCP2 as an important transcriptional regulator in eukaryotes.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) show a decline in pluripotency and differentiation with increased cell culture passages in 2D cultures. The 2D monolayer culture fails to correctly imitate the architecture and microenvironments of in-vivo cell models. Alternatively, 3D culture may improve the simulations of in-vivo cell microenvironments with wide applications in cell culture and drug discovery. In the present study, we compared various 3D culturing techniques such as 3D micro-well (3D-S), hanging drop (HD), and ultra-low attachment (ULA) plate-based spheroid culture to study their effect on morphology, viability, pluripotency, cell surface markers, immunomodulatory factors, and differentiation capabilities of Wharton’s jelly-mesenchymal stem cells (WJ-MSCs). The cell morphology, viability, and senescence of 3D cultured WJ-MSCs were comparable to cells in 2D culture. The expression of pluripotency markers (OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG) was enhanced upto 2–8 fold in 3D cultured WJ-MSCs when compared to 2D culture. Moreover, the immunomodulatory factors (IDO, IL-10, LIF, ANG1, and VEGF) were significantly elevated in ULA based 3D cultured WJ-MSCs. Furthermore, significant enhancement in the differentiation potential of WJ-MSCs towards adipocyte (ADP and C/EBP-α), osteocyte (OPN and RUNX2), and definitive endodermal (SOX17, FOXA2, and CXCR4) lineages in 3D culture conditions were observed. Additionally, the osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation potential of WJ-MSCs over the time points 7 days, 14 days, and 28 days was also significantly increased in 3D culture groups. Our study demonstrates that stemness properties of WJ-MSCs were significantly enhanced in 3D cultures and ULA-based culture outperformed other methods with high pluripotency gene expression and enhanced differentiation potential. This study indicates the efficacy of 3D cultures to bridge the gap between 2D cell culture and animal models in regenerative medicine.

Abstract: Summary
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is a popular method for characterizing and quantifying defects in materials. Analyzing digitized TEM images is typically done manually, which is a time-consuming and potentially error-prone task that is not scalable to large dataset sizes, motivating development of automated methods for quantifying and analyzing defects in TEM images. In this work, we perform semantic segmentation of multiple defect types in electron microscopy images of irradiated FeCrAl alloys using a deep learning mask regional convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN) model. We evaluate the performance of the model based on distributions of defect shapes, sizes, and areal densities relevant to informing physical modeling and understanding irradiated Fe-based materials properties. To better understand the performance and present limitations of the model, we provide examples of useful evaluation tests, which include a suite of random splits and dataset-size-dependent and domain-targeted cross-validation tests, exposing potential weak points in the model applicability domain. Our model predicts the expected irradiation-induced material hardening to within 10–20 MPa (about 10% of total hardening), on par with experimental error. Finally, we discuss the first phase of an effort to provide an easy-to-use, open-source object detection tool to the broader community for identifying defects in new images.

Abstract: Summary
Hydrogen fuel cells are needed for long-haul, heavy-duty transportation applications that are beyond the range of electric vehicle technology. Recently, advances in membrane science have enabled alkaline fuel cells, which in principle do not require precious metal catalysts, to compete with fuel cells that utilize acidic membranes. Here, we combine cryo-electron microscopy, electrochemistry, and numerical modeling to understand the performance of the cathode of alkaline fuel cells, where oxygen combines with water to make hydroxide anions. We examine the conventional electrode architecture, where catalyst nanoparticles are supported on carbon and surrounded by a thin film of ionomer, with a new architecture of catalyst particles on gas-permeable fluorocarbon fibers. These studies show that the conventional architecture would work more efficiently with ionomers that are more permeable to oxygen. The fiber architecture manages oxygen and ion transport well, but its performance is limited by the activity of the catalyst.

Abstract: Summary
Growing imbalances between electricity demand and supply from variable renewable energy sources (VREs) create increasingly large swings in electricity prices. Polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzers can help to buffer against these imbalances and minimize the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) by ramping up production of hydrogen through high-current-density operation when low-cost electricity is abundant, and ramping down current density to operate efficiently when electricity prices are high. We introduce a technoeconomic model that optimizes current density profiles for dynamically operated electrolyzers, while accounting for the potential of increased degradation rates, to minimize LCOH for any given time-of-use (TOU) electricity pricing. This model is used to predict LCOH from different methods of operating a PEM electrolyzer for historical and projected electricity prices in California and Texas, which were chosen due to their high penetration of VREs. Results reveal that dynamic operation could enable reductions in LCOH ranging from 2% to 63% for historical 2020 pricing and 1% to 53% for projected 2030 pricing. Moreover, high-current-density operation above 2.5 A cm−2 is increasingly justified at electricity prices below $0.03 kWh−1. These findings suggest an actionable means of lowering LCOH and guide PEM electrolyzer development toward devices that can operate efficiently at a range of current densities.

Abstract: Summary
While densified wood emerges as a promising candidate to replace metals in structural applications, joining densified wood is critical to extend its size and shape for practical applications. Here, we investigate the roles of chemical composition and material microstructure in determining corrosion rates by studying the behavior of galvanized low-carbon steel embedded in three wood materials: natural basswood, delignified wood, and densified wood. Delignification selectively reduces acidic precursors, hemicelluloses and lignin, in wood and increases its pH value, which is also more stable at elevated temperatures. Though delignification causes densified wood to be more hydrophilic, the highly dense structure significantly reduces ion diffusion in wood. Both delignification and densification lead to exceptionally low corrosion rates for metal embedded within densified wood. This work sheds light on new approaches to corrosion resistance that can be applied to a broad range of uses for engineered wood.

Abstract: Actin is among the most abundant proteins in eukaryotic cells and assembles into dynamic filamentous networks regulated by many actin binding proteins. The actin cytoskeleton must be finely tuned, both in space and time, to fulfill key cellular functions such as cell division, cell shape changes, phagocytosis and cell migration. While actin oxidation by reactive oxygen species (ROS) at non-physiological levels are known for long to impact on actin polymerization and on the cellular actin cytoskeleton, growing evidence shows that direct and reversible oxidation/reduction of specific actin amino acids plays an important and physiological role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton. In this review, we describe which actin amino acid residues can be selectively oxidized and reduced in many different ways (e.g. disulfide bond formation, glutathionylation, carbonylation, nitration, nitrosylation and other oxidations), the cellular enzymes at the origin of these post-translational modifications, and the impact of actin redox modifications both in vitro and in vivo. We show that the regulated balance of oxidation and reduction of key actin amino acid residues contributes to the control of actin filament polymerization and disassembly at the subcellular scale and highlight how improper redox modifications of actin can lead to pathological conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Development of efficient and stable electrodes for hydrogen and oxygen evolution from water constituted of abundant elements and prepared by sustainable and scalable procedures is of considerable importance for producing green hydrogen from renewable electricity. Herein, a method for the preparation of Ni2P, Fe2P, and FeP supported on N-doped graphene (NiP/NG and FeP/NG) is reported. The procedure uses metal salts, phosphorous oxide, and chitosan as precursors of metal phosphide and N-doped graphene, avoiding the use of undesirable and hazardous precursors, such as PH3 or NaH2PO2, and rendering a material with a strong metal phosphide-graphene interaction. Moreover, NiP/NG and FeP/NG electrodes are demonstrated to be more efficient than the benchmark catalysts Pt/C and RuO2, for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively, at a large current density (300 mA/cm2). In addition, water electrolysis was carried out using NiP/NG//FeP/NG electrodes, also demonstrating improved efficiency and stability compared with Pt/C//RuO2 at a current density (400 mA/cm2) near industrial requirements.

Abstract: Summary
New catalysts and product diversification of direct CH4 conversion remain very challenging in catalysis. Here, we report FeOx/ZnO photo-catalysts for the conversion of CH4 to liquid oxygenates with high yield (4,108 μmol·gcat−1·h−1) and nearly 100% selectivity. Based on the combinative results from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance, radical quenching, and theoretical calculations, it is found that, in addition to the activation of CH4 in the liquid phase, the presence of highly dispersed FeO3 motifs in the ZnO lattice facilitates the formation of surface-active O− species; this plays an effective role for CH4 activation to ·CH3 radicals. Meanwhile, HCHO is obtained as the major product in our system, rather than the typically reported CH3OH, and this may offer new opportunities to extend the product structure of CH4 upgrading via tandem catalysis.

With the development of aquatic monitoring in oceanic science and environmental protection via tens of thousands of electronic detectors and sensors, the exploitation of energy supply technology for such off-grid electronic devices in ocean informatics is an urgent issue to be addressed. In particular, researchers are seeking alternative candidates to supply power to devices connected to the internet of things in oceanic conditions with diverse light intensities. Herein, we report the potential of organic photovoltaic materials in oceanic applications. The wide-bandgap PM6:IO-4Cl cell achieves a champion efficiency of 23.11% at a sea depth of 5 m because of film absorption spectrum matching with photons passing through the body of water. This work confirms the potential of wide-bandgap organic materials in oceanic photovoltaic applications.

Abstract: Summary
Structural diversity and low cost make organic materials ideal candidates for next-generation energy storage applications. To obtain high-performance electrode materials for lithium (Li)-organic batteries, the identification of suitable organic molecules that exhibit multiple and stable redox states, limited solubility, and improved conductivity is critical. The leverage of bio-derived redox-active motifs holds great promise due to their built-in functionality and availability from natural resources. Here, we report the structural evolution from naturally occurring, two-electron accepting carbonylpyridinium units into four-electron accepting small organic molecules and their incorporation into high-performance polymers. Impressively, CP2-based electrode can read up to 807 mAh g−1 after 300 cycles at a current density of 0.2 A g−1. The superior battery performance rivals that of state-of-the-art Li-ion batteries and opens the door toward significantly broadening the impact of this critical energy-storage technology.

Abstract: Summary
Grain boundaries (GBs) are common features in materials and can tune their physical and/or chemical properties. GBs in graphene could degrade electrical or thermal properties and, thus, are widely supposed to be avoided in related applications. However, the potential to utilize GBs in graphene remains to be explored. Here we reveal that, contrary to traditional negative effects, GBs can efficiently tune ion transport properties, but this remains poorly understood. By controlling the GB density in graphene, we achieve precise tuning of proton permeance with a range of 2 orders of magnitude. We study the reactivity of GBs and attain 3–6 times higher permeance of ions for GB-rich samples than for GB-poor samples. We obtain a proton conductivity 3–4 orders of magnitude higher than commercial Nafion membranes with higher selectivity. Our work discloses the crucial roles of GBs to tailor ion transport and shows the potential of designing GBs in 2D material for membrane applications.

Abstract: An in vitro bone triple culture involving human primary osteoblasts, osteocytes and osteoclasts enables the investigation of bone healing factors, drugs or biomaterials in a model system for native bone tissue. The present study analyses the impact of Sr2+ as well as hypoxic cultivation (5% O2 content or chemically induced by Co2+) on bone cells. The three cell types were cultivated together in the presence of 100 µM Sr2+, hypoxic conditions or in the presence of 75 µM Co2+. After cultivation the cell types were separated and analysed on mRNA and protein level individually. In response to Sr2+ osteoblasts showed a downregulation of IBSP expression and a stimulation of ALP activity. Osteocyte gene marker expression of PDPN, MEPE, RANKL, OPG, osteocalcin and likewise the amount of secreted osteocalcin was reduced in the presence of Sr2+. Activity of osteoclast-specific enzymes TRAP and CAII was enhanced compared to the Sr2+ free control. Hypoxic conditions induced by both 5% O2 or a Co2+ treatment led to decreased DNA content of all bone cells and downregulated expression of osteoblast markers ALPL and IBSP as well as osteocyte markers PDPN, RANKL and OPG. In addition, Co2+ induced hypoxia decreased gene and protein expression of osteocalcin in osteocytes. In response to the Co2+ treatment, the TRAP gene expression and activity was increased. This study is the first to analyse the effects of Sr2+ or hypoxia on triple cultures with primary human bone cells. The investigated in vitro bone model might be suitable to reduce animal experiments in early stages of biomaterial and drug development.

Abstract: Summary
Poor oxidation stability of ether solvents at the cathode restricts the use of dilute ether electrolytes with conventional concentrations around 1 M in high-voltage, lithium-metal batteries. Here, we report an anion-adsorption approach to altering the ether solvent environment within the electrical double layer (EDL) at the cathode by adding a small amount of nitrate so that the oxidation tolerance of nitrate-containing dilute ether electrolytes is enhanced up to 4.4 V (versus Li/Li+), leading to complete compatibility with high-voltage cathodes and exhibiting superior cycling stability. Constant potential molecular dynamics simulations reveal that ether molecules are mostly excluded from the cathode because of nitrate occupation in the inner layer of the EDL, thus suppressing ether oxidative decomposition. This work highlights that regulating the interfacial structure by adding surface adsorbates, rather than passivating the cathode-electrolyte interphase or changing ion solvation, can help to enhance the oxidation stability of ether solvents.

Abstract: Summary
Strong metal-support interactions (SMSIs), one of the core concepts in the field of catalysis, have a substantial influence on catalytic performance, especially stability. Conventional view holds that only reducible metal-oxide supports could induce a SMSI encapsulation state upon high-temperature treatments. Herein, we demonstrate a high-temperature SMSI between platinum and sulfur-doped carbon (S-C) supports, featuring charge transfer, suppression of H2/CO adsorption, and support of encapsulation. We find that the strong chemical interaction between platinum and sulfur atoms greatly suppresses platinum sintering at moderate temperatures of 300°C–700°C, along with the subsequent formation of SMSI encapsulation structures at high temperatures of 900°C–1,100°C. The high-temperature SMSI endowed the Pt/S-C catalysts with outstanding sintering resistance up to 1,100°C and enhanced electrocatalytic oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) durability in H2–air proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs).

Abstract: Summary
Typical organic photovoltaic semiconductors exhibit high exciton binding energy (Eb, typically >300 meV), hindering the development of organic solar cells based on a single photovoltaic material (SPM-OSCs). Herein, compared with the control molecule (Y6), Y6Se with selenium substitution exhibits reduced Eb and faster relaxation of the exciton state or the intermediate intra-moiety excimer state, indicating that the exciton dissociation in Y6Se film can be driven by lower energy. The SPM-OSCs based on Y6Se film without and with 1 wt % p-type polymer additive exhibit long charge-carrier lifetime, and extended electron diffusion length, leading to impressive power conversion efficiencies of 3.07% and 3.94%, respectively, which are significantly higher than those values reported for SPM-OSCs based on single photovoltaic small molecules in the literature. In addition, the SPM-OSCs based on Y6Se show superior thermal stability, relative to the typical bulk heterojunction OSCs based on Y6Se blending with polymer donor.

Abstract: Proteins of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) family play a central role in regulating actin cytoskeletal dynamics in a wide range of cellular processes. Genetic mutations or misregulation of these proteins are tightly associated with many diseases. The WASP-family proteins act by transmitting various upstream signals to their conserved WH2-Central-Acidic (WCA) peptide sequence at the C-terminus, which in turn binds to the Arp2/3 complex to stimulate the formation of branched actin networks at membranes. Despite this common feature, the regulatory mechanisms and cellular functions of distinct WASP-family proteins are very different. Here, we summarize and clarify our current understanding of WASP-family proteins and how disruption of their functions is related to human disease.

Abstract: Summary
During the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there has been a dramatic increase in the use of medical products and personal protective equipment, such as masks, gowns, and disposable syringes, to treat patients or administer vaccines. However, this may lead to generation of large quantities of biohazardous medical waste. Here, an alternating-magnetic-field-initiated catalytic strategy is proposed to convert disposable syringes into hydrogen-rich gases and high-value graphite. Specifically, in addition to selecting heavy fraction of bio-oil as initiator, disposable syringe needles are used as radio frequency electromagnetic wave receptors to initiate the deconstruction of disposable syringe plastic. The highest H2 yield of 39.9 mmol g-1 is achieved, and 30.1 mmol g-1 is maintained after 10 cycles. Moreover, a high carbon yield of 286 mg g-1 can be obtained. Beyond disposable syringes, this strategy could help to solve the emerging issue for other types of medical waste (e.g., mask and protective clothing) disposal.

Abstract: Summary
Due to the high energy density and low production cost, silicon oxide (SiOx) is recognized as one of the most promising anode materials for lithium-ion batteries. However, the low initial coulombic efficiency and rapid capacity attenuation of SiOx anodes severely restricts its commercial application. Here, we propose a scalable strategy of pre-lithiation followed by a thermal passivation to improve the initial coulombic efficiency of SiOx anodes, boosting the large-scale commercial applications of the pre-lithiation strategy. First, the hollow porous SiOx@C spheres (Hp-SiOx@C) with adjustable shell thickness are designed using a self-transformation method, and then an air-stable pre-lithiated Hp-SiOx@C (ASP-Hp-SiOx@C) anode is prepared through an electrochemical pre-lithiation followed by a thermal passivation strategy. The ASP-Hp-SiOx@C anode delivers high initial coulombic efficiency of 99.2% and stable cycling performance after being exposed to the atmosphere with 10%–20% relative humidity for 48 h.

Abstract: Osteoclasts are bone resorbing cells that are responsible for physiological and pathological bone resorption. Macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) binds to the M-CSF receptor (c-FMS) and plays a key role in the differentiation and survival of macrophages and osteoclasts. THOC5, a member of the THO complex, has been shown to regulate hematopoiesis and M-CSF-induced macrophage differentiation. However, the role of THOC5 in osteoclasts remains unclear. Here, our study reveals a new role of THOC5 in osteoclast formation. We found that THOC5 shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm in an M-CSF signaling dependent manner. THOC5 bound to FICD, a proteolytic cleavage product of c-FMS, and THOC5 facilitates the nuclear translocations of FICD. Decreased expression of THOC5 by siRNA-mediated knock down suppressed osteoclast differentiation, in part, by regulating RANK, a key receptor of osteoclasts. Mechanistically, knock down of THOC5 inhibited the expression of RANKL-induced FOS and NFATc1. Our findings highlight THOC5′s function as a positive regulator of osteoclasts.

Abstract: Summary
Heterometallic lanthanide complexes, especially with specific metal arrays, are attracting special attention due to their unusual physical properties, which have found many applications in various fields, including high-performance molecular optical/magnetic devices and multifunctional probes for bioassays and bioimaging. However, due to the similar chemical properties of lanthanide ions, their construction is still challenging. Here, we report a new modular approach for the facile and efficient preparation of sequence-specific heterometallic lanthanide-complex-based dendritic architectures, which are termed as sequence-controlled heterolayered lanthanide-ligand structures (SHELLs). As a demonstration, a series of SHELLs containing desired lanthanide chelates with designed sequences are quickly synthesized by iterative covalent linking and extensively characterized with various instruments. The special optical and/or magnetic features of these dendritic structures implicate their promising potential as multifunctional agents. Our study underlines the bright prospective of SHELLs and the substantial significance of this modular strategy for the development of well-ordered giant heterometallic architectures.

Abstract: Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are inherited metabolic diseases caused by storage of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), however, various modulations of the course of these diseases were identified recently due to impairment of different cellular processes. Here, using transcriptomic analyses in cells derived from patients suffering from eleven types of MPS, we demonstrated that expression of dozens to hundreds of genes coding for proteins involved in signal transduction processes is significantly changed in MPS cell relative to controls. When studying membrane estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1) and oxytocin receptor (OXTR) in more detail, we unexpectedly found formation of aggregates of GPER1 in MPS I, and those of OXTR in both MPS I and MPS II cells. The presence of these aggregates did not correlate with levels of expression of GPER1 and OXTR genes and levels of corresponding gene products. On the other hand, the aggregates disappeared in cells treated with enzymes which are otherwise deficient in MPS I and MPS II, causing efficient degradation of GAGs. We demonstrated that GPER1 and OXTR aggregates might be formed due to interactions with GAGs rather than arising from changes of levels of these proteins in cells.

Abstract: Summary
MXenes have gained significant attention for development of flexible or wearable electronics. However, intrinsic sediment waste from the MXene production process is usually discarded, greatly decreasing efficiency. Rational use of MXene waste (trash) in wearables may improve economic benefits. Here, a strategy that integrates MXene nanosheets (treasure) with sediment trash is employed to construct a smart wearable self-powered health monitoring system. A flexible solid-state supercapacitor (FSSC) consisting of a robust MXene/polyamide (MX-PA) film delivers good specific capacitance and mechanical properties. An MXene trash-based pressure sensor realizes effective monitoring of physiological signals. By integrating the FSSC and pressure sensor, the self-powered smart system can remotely receive physiological feedback for evaluating human health status. This work explores a feasible strategy to take full advantage of MXene starting materials and may expand scalable fabrication of MXene-based smart wearables in healthcare fields.

Abstract: Summary
Two-dimensional materials resistive random-access memories (RRAMs) are known to exhibit excellent nonvolatile resistive switching (NVRS) performance. However, most two-dimensional materials are produced as monocrystal films with little attention paid to their stacked, discontinuous, and loose polycrystal states, which may allow for more facile atomic diffusion. Here, we propose a liquid-phase self-assembly (LPSA) method to fabricate stacked hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) polycrystal film (SHPF) and demonstrate its NVRS behavior. Three device architectures with different electrodes are studied, all of which exhibit resistive switching behaviors. The Al/h-BN/Pt device shows 120 current-voltage (I-V) sweeps without degradation, and the Al/h-BN/ITO device exhibits an on/off ratio of ∼104. The proposed LPSA method can serve as a facile and low-cost way to fabricate memory materials on arbitrary substrates. Moreover, stacked, discontinuous, and loose polycrystal film can facilitate the study of NVRS, which opens up an additional avenue for many potential functional applications.

Abstract: Summary
The ferroelectric phase transition of GeTe thermoelectric materials caused by the 4s2 lone-pair electrons of Ge2+ leads to the sudden change of thermal expansion coefficient, which severely restrains its practical applications. Herein, we demonstrate a successful way to suppress the ferroelectric phase-transition temperature down to below room temperature in GeTe. Our approach involves LiSbTe2 alloying, where the charge distribution is manipulated to reduce the influence of the stereochemical activity of the cation lone-pair electrons on the crystal structure. LiSbTe2 alloying can also promote multi-band convergence and enhance phonon scattering. Consequently, a superior ZTave of 1.38 within 300—773 K is achieved in cubic (GeTe)0.70(LiSbTe2)0.30 alloys, which is significantly higher than the reported results for room temperature or near-room temperature cubic GeTe systems so far. Moreover, the calculated conversion efficiency of 17% is also the highest among all nontoxic p-type polycrystalline thermoelectric materials. This work takes a solid step forward in the application of GeTe.

Abstract: Human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) are pluripotent cells that gradually lose their self-renewal and regenerative potential, to give rise to mature cells of the hematopoietic system by differentiation. HSPC infusion is used to restore hematopoietic function in patients with a variety of onco-hematologic and immune-mediated disorders. The functionality of these cells is therefore of great importance to ensure the homeostasis of the hematopoietic system. Melatonin plays an important role as immunomodulatory and oncostatic hormone. In the present manuscript, we aimed at evaluating the activity of melatonin in modulating HSPC senescence, in the attempt to improve their hemopoietic regenerative potential. We exposed HSPCs to melatonin, in different conditions, and then analyzed the expression of genes regulating cell cycle and cell senescence. Moreover, we assessed cell senescence by β-galactosidase and telomerase activity. Our results showed the ability of melatonin to counteract HSPC senescence, thus paving the way for enhanced efficiency in their clinical application.

Abstract: We have shown the connection of hyaluronan synthesis activity with the enhanced shedding of extracellular vesicles, but detailed morphological analysis of those hyaluronan-induced EVs is still missing. In this study we utilized a comprehensive set of high-resolution imaging techniques to characterize in high detail the size and morphology of EVs originating from stable MCF7 breast cancer cell line and transiently transfected cells expressing GFP-HAS3. To avoid possible artefacts or loss of EVs resulting from the isolation process, special attention was paid to analysis of EVs in situ in monolayer and in 3D cultures. The results of this study show that GFP-HAS3 expressing MCF7 cells produce morphologically diverse EVs but also demonstrates the variation in results obtained with different experimental setup, which emphasizes the importance of comparison between different methods when interpreting the observations.

Abstract: Summary
Element doping can fabricate different types of oxygen vacancies (Ov) on TiO2, but the effects of Ov coordination and configuration on the oxidation reaction remain unclear. Here, we modify the local geometric ligand environment of Ov by doping N and B into anatase TiO2 (N-TiO2 and B-TiO2). N−–Ti3+–Ov is induced in N-TiO2 by substituting O with N, which has similar ionic size and electronegativity, and Ti3+–Ov is found in TiO2 and B-TiO2. Density functional theory calculations indicate that N−–Ti3+–Ov is more reactive than Ti3+–Ov toward O2 activation. The resultant N-TiO2-0.25 enriched in N−–Ti3+–Ov contributes to a rapid formation of superoxygen species (•O2−), which increase the oxidation rate of primary C–H bonds in toluene, and thus exhibits much higher selectivity and yield. The fabrication of N−–Ti3+–Ov develops doped catalysts with improved Ov reactivity and enhanced primary C–H bond oxidation selectivity.

Abstract: Summary
All-solid-state lithium batteries have attracted great attention because of their high safety, considerable energy density, and long lifespan. However, poor interfacial contact between the electrolyte and electrode has hindered its development. Here, we design the integration of a low-tortuous electrode and an in-situ-polymerized electrolyte for all-solid-state lithium-metal batteries. Vertically aligned channels are produced in electrode materials using the ice-templating method, and then a solid polymer electrolyte is penetrated into aligned porous channels of the electrodes by in situ UV-curing polymerization. The lithium metal cells using the electrode and electrolyte integration exhibit excellent discharge specific capacity and cycle stability at room temperature. This superior electrochemical performance is because of the good electrode/electrolyte interfacial contact and fast ion-diffusion kinetics in the electrode. This work provides a simple, efficient, and practical strategy to fabricate high-energy-density solid-state batteries.

Abstract: Summary
Hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets (h-BNNSs) are a functional material with excellent performance; they have broad application prospects in the field of heat dissipation of electronic devices. To achieve commercial application as soon as possible, there is an urgent need to develop a simple, controllable, and scalable method to produce high-quality h-BNNSs. Here, a scalable and controllable approach is proposed to exfoliate high-quality h-BNNSs from hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) flakes that relies on efficient reduction of h-BNNS interlayer interaction by rapid volume expansion of water in icing. The effectiveness and feasibility of this method are verified by molecular dynamics simulations. The thickness of h-BNNSs is determined by freezing and exfoliation cycles, and monolayer h-BNNSs can be obtained after five cycles of freezing and exfoliation. The as-obtained h-BNNSs have excellent dispersibility in water, enabling versatile application as polymer additives, thermal conductive fillers, flame retardants, and more.

Abstract: Summary
Highly selective anion recognition and extraction is challenging and yet critical for removal of pollutants from the environment and the effective recovery of valuable chemicals from low-content (at sub-ppm or ppb level) sources. In this paper, we detail the gram-scale synthesis of a superphane 2, an anion receptor that selectively binds ReO4−. Superphane 2 can extract perrhenate from solid mixtures containing traces of ReO4− anion (as low as 200 ppb) and aqueous media with near 100% selectivity over large excesses of competing anions. Meanwhile, up to 99.99% of ReO4− can be separated from complex simulated aqueous waste streams containing ppm-level perrhenate via either liquid-liquid extraction or simple column adsorption. Importantly, after extraction or adsorption, superphane 2 can be recycled and reused by simple treatment with aqueous NaHCO3.

Abstract: LUZP1 (leucine zipper protein 1) was first described as being important for embryonic development. Luzp1 null mice present defective neural tube closure and cardiovascular problems, which cause perinatal death. Since then, LUZP1 has also been implicated in the etiology of diseases like the 1p36 and the Townes-Brocks syndromes, and the molecular mechanisms involving this protein started being uncovered. Proteomics studies placed LUZP1 in the interactomes of the centrosome-cilium interface, centriolar satellites, and midbody. Concordantly, LUZP1 is an actin and microtubule-associated protein, which localizes to the centrosome, the basal body of primary cilia, the midbody, actin filaments and cellular junctions. LUZP1, like its interactor EPLIN, is an actin-stabilizing protein and a negative regulator of primary cilia formation. Moreover, through the regulation of actin, LUZP1 has been implicated in the regulation of cell cycle progression, cell migration and epithelial cell apical constriction. This review discusses the latest findings concerning LUZP1 molecular functions and implications in disease development.

Abstract: Summary
Lignin is a significant byproduct from the pulp and paper industry. However, the conversion of lignin to a resource with added value is plagued by expensive processing. Here we report that the syringyl units (S) of sodium lignosulfonate (LS) exhibit phosphorescence in water with a lifetime of ∼2 ms and the lifetime can be prolonged up to ∼618 ms by encapsulation in Ca3(PO4)2 due to the formation of H-type dimers of the S units (LS@Ca3(PO4)2). Motivated by this, we develop afterglow paper through the in situ generation of LS@Ca3(PO4)2 in the paper matrix. The afterglow emission of the paper is sensitive to H2O2, enabling its application as a sensor for liquid/vapor H2O2. Moreover, the afterglow paper is shown to be suitable for use in anti-counterfeiting applications, enabling the development of a more sustainable pulp and paper industry.

Abstract: Summary
Hybrid concentrator photovoltaic-thermal (CPV/T) systems generate both electricity and process heat by splitting concentrated sunlight onto CPV cells and a thermal receiver utilizing a heat-transfer fluid. Such energy co-generation increases total conversion efficiency and reduces system costs to compete with more widely used electricity and heat-generation methods in target markets. Here, we design and prototype a sunflower-like CPV/T system that collects a portion of the incoming sunlight using triple-junction CPV cells operating with an average temperature of <85°C. In the same receiver, thermal output >245°C may be generated from both waste heat from the CPV cells and a spatially separated fraction of the incoming concentrated light illuminating a heat-exchanger coil. In total, >65% of incident sunlight is converted to electricity or process heat. On-sun field tests validate this model and guide future development, and a techno-economic model demonstrates a US average levelized cost of heat of 2.5 ¢/kWth.

Abstract: Approximately 170 RNA modifications have been identified and these are critical for determining the fate and function of cellular RNAs. Similar to human transcripts, viral RNAs possess an extensive RNA modification landscape. While initial efforts largely focused on investigating the RNA modification landscape in the context of RNA virus infection, a growing body of work has explored the impact of RNA modifications on DNA virus biology. These studies have revealed roles for RNA modifications in DNA virus infection, including gene regulation and viral pathogenesis. In this review, we will discuss the current knowledge on how RNA modifications impact DNA virus biology.

Abstract: Summary
Inhibiting frost formation is of fundamental importance for many industrial applications, ranging from various infrastructures to thermal systems. Sustaining a frost-free surface without reducing heat transfer efficiency is a great challenge. We hereby propose a counterintuitive approach to achieve sustainable anti-frosting under high heat flux subcooled condensation by accelerating the nucleation-to-departure cycle of condensed liquid, demonstrated by manipulating initial nucleation and reducing thermal resistance using a three-dimensional nanowire network. High heat flux subcooled condensation is maintained without frost formation on the frost-free surface at a low surface temperature of −15°C for more than 5 h in humid air with a relative humidity of 75%. More than 10 times enhancement in the steady-state heat flux is obtained on the frost-free surface compared with the state-of-the-art low solid fraction non-wetting nanostructured surfaces. This passive frost-free surface may hold promise for increasing the efficiency of thermal systems while inspiring the design of frost-free surfaces.

Abstract: Summary
Graphitic carbon nitride is a benchmark n-type polymer photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution from water in suspension systems, though it is extremely inefficient in photoelectrochemical (PEC) systems. Minimizing the considerable discrepancy between the two systems is challenging but necessary for applications. Efficient electron collection on the catalyst surface is key to carbon nitride’s photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance in suspension systems, but it is rarely achieved in PEC films because of the electron transfer barrier from bulk to the surface. Here, we report a hydrogel-based PEC photocathode that inherits the intrinsic advantages of suspension systems, providing a suspension-like environment for carbon nitride hydrogen evolution. This promotes electron trapping at heteroatom-induced shallow surface trap states, mitigates space charge layer, and reduces charge migration distance in hydrogel-supported heteroatoms-doped carbon nitride nanosheets, enabling efficient electron collection on the surface, leading to 10-time improvement in photocathodic performance. This study provides proof of concept for mimicking suspension in photoelectrodes that can be applied to various powder-based photoelectrochemical cells.

Abstract: Patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) have a high risk of developing lung cancer compared with the general population. The morbidity of lung cancer in IPF patient ranges from 3% to 22%, and in some cases exceeds 50%, and these patients have a reduced survival time. However, the mechanisms through which IPF increases the morbidity and mortality in lung cancer remain unclear. By carefully analyzing the pathological features of these two diseases, we uncovered that, first, similar to IPF, lung carcinomas are more frequently found in the peripheral area of the lungs and, second, lung cancers tend to develop from the honeycomb areas in IPF. In accordance with the above pathological features, due to the spatial location, the peripheral areas of the lung experience a high stretch force because the average distance between adjacent alveolar cells in this area tends to be larger than that at the central lung when inflated; furthermore, the honeycomb areas, comprised of condensed fibrous tissue, are characterized by increased stiffness. Both of these pathological features of lung cancer and IPF are coincidentally related to abnormal mechanical forces (stretch and tissue stiffness). Therefore, we believe that the aberrant mechanical forces that are generated in the lung with IPF may contribute to the onset and progression of lung cancer. In this review, we discuss the possible effects of mechanical forces that are generated in IPF on the initiation and progression of lung cancer from the perspective of the hallmarks of cancer, including proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis, cancer stem cells, immunology, epigenetics, and metabolism, so as to advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of IPF-related lung cancer and to harness these concepts for lung cancer mechanotherapies.

Abstract: Summary
Solar-driven formic acid dehydrogenation shows great potential for sustainable hydrogen utilization. Nevertheless, photothermal catalytic materials that are essential to dehydrogenation not only exhibit limited solar absorption and large heat loss but also heavily rely on noble metals, limiting efficient and low-cost hydrogen generation. Here, we report a porous MXene monolith that enables interfacial heat localization and propose a defect-engineering strategy for MXenes to realize the coordinated regulation of photothermal property and catalytic activity, which is further evidenced by density functional theory calculations. As a result, this design achieves a hydrogen generation rate of 401 mmol g−1 h−1 with an H2 selectivity of 100% and catalytic stability over 45 h of operation, significantly surpassing many state-of-the-art, Pd-based noble metal materials. The work provides new insight into the design of photothermal catalytic MXenes and may open a new application toward solar hydrogen generation.

Abstract: Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signals to enhance or destabilize the vascular endothelial barrier depending on the receptor engaged. Here, we investigated the differential barrier effects of S1P on two influential primary endothelial cell (EC) types, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs). S1PR1 (barrier protective) and S1PR3 (barrier disruptive) surface and gene expression were quantified by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence, and RT-qPCR, respectively. Functional evaluation of EC monolayer permeability in response to S1P was quantified with transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and small molecule permeability. S1P significantly enhanced HUVEC barrier function, while promoting HPMEC barrier breakdown. Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry analysis showed select, S1PR3-high HPMECs, suggesting susceptibility to barrier destabilization following S1P exposure. Reevaluation of HPMEC barrier following S1P exposure under inflamed conditions demonstrated synergistic barrier disruptive effects of pro-inflammatory cytokine and S1P. The role of the Rho-ROCK signaling pathway under these conditions was confirmed through ROCK1/2 inhibition (Y-27632). Thus, the heterogeneous responses of ECs to S1P signaling are mediated through Rho-ROCK signaling, and potentially driven by differences in the surface expression of S1PR3.

Abstract: The tight interaction between somatic and germline cells is conserved in animal spermatogenesis. The testes of Drosophila melanogaster are the model of choice to identify processes responsible for mature gamete production. However, processes of differentiation and soma-germline interactions occurring in somatic cyst cells are currently understudied. Here we focused on the comparison of transcriptome expression patterns of early and mature somatic cyst cells to find out the developmental changes taking place in them. We employed a FACS-based approach for the isolation of early and mature somatic cyst cells from fly testes, subsequent preparation of RNA-Seq libraries, and analysis of gene differential expression in the sorted cells. We found increased expression of genes involved in cell cycle-related processes in early cyst cells, which is necessary for the proliferation and self-renewal of a crucial population of early cyst cells, cyst stem cells. Genes proposedly required for lamellipodium-like projection organization for proper cyst formation were also detected among the upregulated ones in early cyst cells. Gene Ontology and interactome analyses of upregulated genes in mature cyst cells revealed a striking over-representation of gene categories responsible for metabolic and catabolic cellular processes, as well as genes supporting the energetic state of the cells provided by oxidative phosphorylation that is carried out in mitochondria. Our comparative analyses of differentially expressed genes revealed major peculiarities in early and mature cyst cells and provide novel insight into their regulation, which is important for male fertility.

Abstract: Summary
Twisting the branches of an organic molecule will enhance luminescence; however, this is often accompanied by the rotation of the branches that will reduce luminescence, offering a contradiction. Thus, deep insight into this contradiction and creating some effective solutions to make a good trade-off have become critical but challenging. Here, we report a smart structural design to fine-tune the twisting of the branches of triangular organic building blocks through steric hindrance, including anchoring of organic units or further construction of uranyl-organic metal-organic frameworks (U-MOFs). Both theoretical calculations and experimental results disclose that the fluorescence performance in the solid for both organic ligands and corresponding U-MOFs highly correlates with the twisting of the branches, and both the anchoring of organic units and the construction of U-MOFs would be effective tools to modulate the trade-off between twisting and rotation, and that rotation could play a key role in promoting a turn-on antenna effect.

Abstract: Summary
Solar vapor generation, which uses photothermal materials to desalinate seawater by evaporation, is a promising technology to mitigate the water scarcity problem, but its performance is hindered by large heat leak and salt accumulation problems. Here we report an umbrella evaporator that achieves efficient vapor generation and salt harvesting concurrently via double-sided evaporation and reveal the salt nucleation, growth, and falling mechanism. The evaporator reaches an evaporation rate of 1.25 kg m−2·h−1 under ambient conditions, and its continuous operation for vapor and salt production from seawater is demonstrated. The salt mobility on the evaporation surface determines whether the salt could accumulate at the edge, which is influenced by water supply, solar intensity, salinity, and Mg2+ and Ca2+ contents.A simple salt creeping test on a glass slide is developed to determine whether and to what extent seawater needs to be pre-treated for continuous operation.

Abstract: Summary
Artificial photosynthesis of H2O2, an environmentally friendly oxidant and a clean fuel, holds great promise. However, improving its efficiency and stability for industrial implementation remains highly challenging. Here, we report the visible-light H2O2 artificial photosynthesis by digging pro-superoxide radical carbon vacancies in three-dimensional hierarchical porous g-C3N4 through a simple hydrolysis-freeze-drying-thermal treatment. A significant electronic structure change is revealed upon the implantation of carbon vacancies, broadening visible-light absorption and facilitating the photogenerated charge separation. The strong electron affinity of the carbon vacancies promotes superoxide radical (⋅O2−) formation, significantly boosting the H2O2 photocatalytic production. The developed photocatalyst shows an H2O2 evolution rate of 6287.5 μM g−1 h−1 under visible-light irradiation with a long cycling stability being the best-performing photocatalyst among all reported g-C3N4-based systems. Our work provides fundamental insight into highly active and stable photocatalysts with great potential for safe industrial H2O2 production.

Abstract: Summary
Designing efficient bifunctional catalysts that can catalyze overall water splitting to generate hydrogen—an attractive, environmentally friendly and renewable energy carrier—is tremendously important to combat the global warming and energy crisis. Here, we report an atomistic-level understanding of the overall water splitting mechanism, 2H2O → 2H2 + O2, mediated by C60-supported vanadium single atoms. Detailed reaction pathways are calculated, and key intermediates with nominal chemical formulas of C60V+(H2O)2 and C60V+O2 are characterized by infrared spectroscopy. When mediated by an isolated V+, the overall water splitting reaction stops due to geometric restrictions with end product V+(OH)2 or V+O(H2O), whereas it can proceed to complete a catalytic cycle in the presence of the C60-support. Our analyses reveal that the vanadium center undergoes several formal oxidation state changes resulting from the unique electron donating/accepting ability of the C60-support, acting as an “electron sponge,” additional to its role in facilitating the hydrogen transfer.

Abstract: Summary
Non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) aggregation is crucial in determining bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaic (OPV) performance. However, it is still a big challenge to characterize the nanostructure of NFAs in the disordered donor-acceptor intermixed phase. Here, we demonstrate a method to characterize NFA aggregation and composition in the intermixed phase by measuring NFA concentration-dependent ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy of BHJ films. In various polymer:NFA films, an absorption shift as a function of increasing molecular concentration (ASIMC) phenomenon is observed, and different NFA aggregation behaviors can be distinguished. The ASIMC method was then applied to study the influence of processing conditions on the NFA concentration in the intermixed phase of devices to establish a correlation with device efficiency. The current work provides a feasible tool to study the nanostructure of NFAs in the complex polymer matrix and to understand the variations in the NFA concentration in the intermixed phase under non-equilibrium conditions.

Abstract: Epigenetic modifications by polycomb repressive complex (PRC) molecules appear to play a role in the tumorigenesis and aggressiveness of neuroblastoma (NB). Embryonic ectoderm development (EED) is a member of the PRC2 complex that binds to the H3K27me3 mark deposited by EZH2 via propagation on adjacent nucleosomes. We herein investigated the molecular roles of EED in MYCN-amplified NB cells using EED-knockdown (KD) shRNAs, EED-knockout sgRNAs, and the EED small molecule inhibitor EED226. The suppression of EED markedly inhibited NB cell proliferation and flat and soft agar colony formation. A transcriptome analysis using microarrays of EED-KD NB cells indicated the de-repression of cell cycle-regulated and differentiation-related genes. The results of a GSEA analysis suggested that inhibitory cell cycle-regulated gene sets were markedly up-regulated. Furthermore, an epigenetic treatment with the EED inhibitor EED226 and the HDAC inhibitors valproic acid/SAHA effectively suppressed NB cell proliferation and colony formation. This combined epigenetic treatment up-regulated cell cycle-regulated and differentiation-related genes. The ChIP sequencing analysis of histone codes and PRC molecules suggested an epigenetic background for the de-repression of down-regulated genes in MYCN-amplified/PRC2 up-regulated NB.

Abstract: Summary
Room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) electrolytes are excellent candidates for highly stable electrochromic (EC) devices because of their wide electrochemical windows and good environmental stability. However, the small crystal spacings and molecular gaps of conventional EC materials limit the ion-diffusion rate of RTILs’ large cations. The multiple insertions/extractions of large cations can destroy the structure of the conventional EC materials, leading to structural collapse and poor EC performance. Here, we demonstrate that metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with large intrinsic pores in crystals are promising materials for stable and high-performance RTIL-based EC systems. The MOFs’ large intrinsic hexagonal channels provide suitable ion-transport channels for RTILs, leading to ideal electrochemical stability. We further demonstrate a patterned large-area MOF/RTIL-based EC device, suggesting the promise in future digital displays.

Abstract: Summary
The spatial variations in chemical composition and transport properties of the interphase formed on reactive metal electrodeposits dictate the stability and reversibility of electrochemical cells that use reactive metals as anodes. Here we report on the influence of carbonate and fluorinated electrolytes infused with ethers as additives on the physical-chemical characteristics and reversibility of metallic lithium (Li) during early stages of electrodeposition and later stages of deep cycling of Li metal anodes. We show that a feasible strategy for achieving and sustaining kinetically enhanced interphases through the cycle life of Li electrodeposits is by simultaneous use of sacrificial electrolyte components that undergo electroreduction to enrich the interphase with fluorinated species in tandem with cleaning electrolyte components that promote dissolution and removal of less desirable carbonaceous compounds. We demonstrate that this approach translates to high electrochemical reversibility during deep cycling of the Li metal anode and improved performance of Li metal batteries.

Abstract: Summary
Photoreduction conversion of soluble U(VI) to insoluble U(IV) is considered a promising strategy for uranium capture from radioactive wastewater and seawater. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are emerging as potential photocatalysts due to their inherent large surface areas, tunable cavities, and tailorable photo response. Herein, the electronic structure of UiO-66-NH2 (Zr-MOF) is modulated by missing-linker defects and node metal substitution, allowing for the reduced energy needed to transfer the excited linker’s electrons to the node’s unoccupied d orbitals, which contributes to enhanced photocatalytic uranium extraction capacity. Moreover, the missing-linker defects create more open frameworks, which facilitate fast diffusion of uranyl ions (UO22+) into inner pores and hence increase utilization of the hidden adsorption binding sites. Consequently, light-irradiated Zr/Ti-MOF-25 delivers a high uranium sorption capacity (8.66 ± 0.29 mg-U/g-Ads) with excellent antimicrobial ability in natural seawater. Creation of defects in MOFs opens novel opportunities for enhancing uranium capture through combined complexation and photoreduction.

Abstract: Cells respond to and actively remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM). The dynamic and bidirectional interaction between cells and ECM, especially their mechanical interactions, has been found to play an essential role in triggering a series of complex biochemical and biomechanical signal pathways and in regulating cellular functions and behaviours. The collagen gel contraction assay (CGCA) is a widely used method to investigate cell–ECM interactions in 3D environments and provides a mechanically associated readout reflecting 3D cellular contractility. In this review, we summarize various versions of CGCA, with an emphasis on recent high-throughput and low-consumption CGCA techniques. More importantly, we focus on the technique of force monitoring during the contraction of collagen gel, which provides a quantitative characterization of the overall forces generated by all the resident cells in the collagen hydrogel. Accordingly, we present recent biological applications of the CGCA, which have expanded from the initial wound healing model to other studies concerning cell–ECM interactions, including fibrosis, cancer, tissue repair and the preparation of biomimetic microtissues.

Abstract: Summary
Porous materials have recently been explored as highly effective photosensitizers for the photocatalytic detoxification of sulfur mustard. However, most porous material-based photosensitizers are reliant on heavy-metal effects and require non-realistic light sources and O2-enriched atmosphere to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). To overcome such health problems and practical limitations, we here report a porous organic polymer (POP) photosensitizer (KUP-3) with a protonated imidazoline core, notably showing the generation of types I and II ROS. Owing to its robust framework, KUP-3 can be incorporated into fabrics or melamine sponges via in situ polymerization.

Abstract: Summary
Neuromorphic computing with brain-like functions has become one of the important strategies for the von Neumann bottleneck. However, current artificial neuromorphic systems are mainly based on volatile or non-volatile synaptic devices, which limit the flexibility and computational efficiency of neuromorphic computing systems. Here, we report an adaptive immunomorphic hardware based on the heterostructure of MXene-TiO2 complexes and organic semiconductors. The hardware has photon-triggered synaptic plasticity for accurate recognition and electrically triggered non-volatile retention for effective preservation of weight values. As a result, the retraining time and power consumption of the hardware can be reduced by 95% and 96%, respectively. Moreover, the array system expanded to 5 × 5 can extract special information from complex signals within 0.2 s, enabling feature information recognition. This work, therefore, provides a new strategy for improving the efficiency of artificial neuromorphic computation and has significant application prospects in intelligent sensing systems and edge computing.

Abstract: Summary
The butterfly Apatura ilia’s wings change colors during flapping, which plays a major role in conveying information and avoiding predators. Inspired by the muscle-driven flapping mechanism, here, we fabricate a highly efficient photothermally responsive MXene-hydrogel muscle and achieve a dynamic structural color imaging system based on the MXene-hydrogel muscle manipulated photonic crystal actuator arrays. Our optimized MXene-hydrogel-muscle artificial muscle has a stable and quick photothermal response owing to the high photothermal transformation efficiency of MXene (∼100%). Consequently, our photonic crystal (PhC) actuator exhibits robust structural stability and fatigue resistance (more than 500 cycles), and its response time is ∼5 s. The PhC actuator can give real-time visual feedback in response to heating and near-infrared irradiation. They offer exciting possibilities for applications in sensors, displays, camouflage coatings, cryptography, and many other fields. Our experiments and theoretical analysis reveal the quantitative structure-activity relationship of the responsive PhC actuator.

Abstract: The role of the actin cytoskeleton during receptor-mediated endocytosis (RME) has been well characterized in yeast for many years. Only more recently has the interplay between the actin cytoskeleton and RME been extensively explored in mammalian cells. These studies have revealed the central roles of BAR proteins in RME, and have demonstrated significant roles of BAR proteins in linking the actin cytoskeleton to this cellular process. The actin cytoskeleton generates and transmits mechanical force to promote the extension of receptor-bound endocytic vesicles into the cell. Many adaptor proteins link and regulate the actin cytoskeleton at the sites of endocytosis. This review will cover key effectors, adaptors and signalling molecules that help to facilitate the invagination of the cell membrane during receptor-mediated endocytosis, including recent insights gained on the roles of BAR proteins. The final part of this review will explore associations of alterations to genes encoding BAR proteins with cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Catalytic deoxygenative conversion of amides to substituted amines is an efficient pathway for amine synthesis. α-Substituted amines are generally obtained by classic nucleophilic addition of nucleophiles to active electrophilic intermediates formed from amides. Here, we develop a deoxygenative reaction of amides that combines iridium catalysis and photochemical organocatalysis, giving structurally diverse β-substituted tertiary alkylamines with moderate to excellent yields (up to 93%) with broad substrate scope (57 examples). Mechanistic studies suggest that the combination of iridium (Ir)-catalyzed partial reduction of amides and photochemical organocatalysis of α-bromoketones under visible light plays a crucial role in cross-coupling of these two readily accessible feedstocks. The active electrophilic radicals from photochemical organocatalysis act as functionalization partners with the in-situ-formed enamine intermediates from the Ir-catalyzed reduction of amides instead of traditional nucleophilic addition to iminium ions, leading to formation of β-substituted amines.

Abstract: Summary
Biomass-derived chemicals can offer unique chemical functionality relative to petroleum-derived building blocks. To this end, here we report that β-ketoadipic acid (βKA), a C6 diacid with a β-ketone group, can be used as a performance-advantaged replacement for adipic acid in a nylon-6,6 analog. Building on our previous efforts to produce shikimate-derived products from carbohydrates, Pseudomonas putida KT2440 is engineered to produce βKA from glucose, achieving a 26 g/L titer. Following purification, βKA imparts an increase of 69°C above the nylon-6,6 glass transition temperature and 20% reduced water permeability, equivalent to nylon-6,10. Molecular simulations predict that the enhanced thermal properties result from rigidity introduced by the β-ketone. Process analysis predicts that βKA can be produced for US$1.94/kg from sugars, requiring 63% less energy and emitting 43% less greenhouse gases than fossil-based adipic acid. Overall, this study illustrates the potential for βKA to serve as a useful building block for bio-based polymers.

Abstract: The viscoelastic parameters of the cell can report on the cell state, cellular processes and diseases. Cell mechanics strongly rely on the properties of the cytoskeleton, an important system of subcellular filaments, especially on the high-level structures that actin forms together with actin-binding proteins (ABPs). In normal cells, components of the cytoskeleton are highly integrated, and their functions are well orchestrated. In contrast, impaired expression and functioning of ABPs lead to the increasing ability of cancer cells to resist chemotherapy and metastasize. ABP-mediated changes in the cytoskeleton architecture can lead to changes in the mechanical properties of the actin network, both locally and at the level of the whole cell. Until now, in cancer-related studies, mechanical data have been used less frequently, compared to biochemical tests or cell migration assays. Here, we will review current methods for analyzing the mechanical properties of cells and provide the available data on the contribution of ABPs in determining cell mechanical properties important for the investigation of cellular functions, particularly in cancers.

Abstract: Summary
The fabrication of a flexible all-solid supercapacitor able to work under various deformations, even under extreme conditions, remains challenging because of the rigidity of electrodes, the freezing of gel electrolytes, and interfacial contact problems. Here, we report a flexible supercapacitor with excellent mechanical deformation and ultra-low temperature tolerance assembled by using the designed MXene/carboxymethyl cellulose film electrode and all-round polyvinyl alcohol/LiCl (PVA/LiCl) hydrogel electrolyte. The supercapacitor combines mechanically flexible (12.7 MPa at 5.9% strain) and highly conductive (267 S/cm) electrodes with the PVA/LiCl hydrogel electrolyte with high ion conductivity, excellent mechanical properties, self-adhesion, and antifreezing ability. As a result, the assembled supercapacitor exhibits a high specific capacitance (113.13 mF cm−2) with a retention of ∼95% under mechanical deformations, and more importantly, the electrochemical stability can be maintained even at −40°C when subjected to severe deformations. This work offers an option to design flexible supercapacitors as environment-adaptable energy-storage devices.

Abstract: Summary
Dynamic control of sunlight entering a building through glazing panels (e.g., windows, curtain walls, and skylights) is essential for reducing building energy consumption. Here, we demonstrate a dual-mode glazing panel with switchable reflectance (89% versus 17%) via reversible electrodeposition of a silver film on a transparent glass of the glazing. In cooling mode, the silver film-coated glazing, functioning as a radiative cooler, achieves net cooling power of 20–60 W/m2 on a summer day with direct solar irradiance of 560–970 W/m2. In heating mode, transparent glazing absorbs only 13% and allows ∼70% of sunlight to shine through, providing a net heating power of around 400 W/m2 on a winter day with solar irradiance of 540 W/m2. Simulations show that employing such dynamic glazing panels in a medium-size office building (∼5,000 m2) could save up to 23% annual heating/cooling energy consumption under the local climates of 15 U.S. cities.

Abstract: Summary
Redox flow batteries (RFBs) are emerging as viable options for grid-scale energy storage, but their elevated costs hamper commercialization. Enhancing the porous carbon electrode performance to improve power density and reduce system costs is an effective strategy toward widespread deployment; however, the porous carbon electrode must satisfy multiple contradictory roles, including providing high surface area, low pressure drop, and facile mass transport, thus motivating electrode engineering efforts. In this work, we systematically explore the non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) technique as a platform to synthesize a family of distinct microstructures for use in RFBs. Flow cell studies in commercially relevant redox pairs (i.e., Fe2+/3+, V2+/3+, and V4+/5+) are performed, revealing diverse performance profiles, synthesis-structure-performance relationships, and opportunities for high-power electrode materials. We anticipate that, with further refinement and customization, NIPS electrodes can broadly benefit electrode engineering efforts for electrochemical energy storage and conversion applications.

Specifically, we mine data from related literature to build a specific database and give a prediction based on the basic molecular structures of blending polymers and, as auxiliary, the blending composition. Our model obtains at least 75% accuracy on the dataset consisting of thousands of entries. We demonstrate that the relationship between structure and properties can be learned and simulated by a machine-learning method.

Abstract: Summary
Adsorptive separation of the smallest or largest molecules from a mixture can be realized by the sieving effect; however, it is still an arduous task to specifically discriminate between the intermediate-sized component from a complicated multicomponent mixture. Here, we report a strategy via cooperative control of intralayer and interlayer space for selective adsorption of ethane from methane and propane on a 2D-layered MOF termed Ni(4-DPDS)2CrO4. The intralayer channels work as main adsorption sites, while interlayer channels are designed to achieve optimal discrepancy of kinetic diffusion rates. The restricted diffusion of C3H8 in the interlayer channels results in a dramatic inversed, equilibrium-kinetic, combined selectivity for C2H6/C3H8. Mixture breakthrough experiments manifest an efficient capture of C2H6 owing to the equilibrium-kinetic synergetic effect. The mechanism for selective gas adsorption is well supported by kinetic results and crystallography studies, demonstrating that fabrication of MOFs with multiple distinct controllable micropores enables selective capture of intermediate-sized molecules.

Abstract: Summary
Predicting the glass transition temperature (Tg) is of critical importance as it governs the thermomechanical performance of conjugated polymers (CPs). Here, we report a predictive modeling framework to predict Tg of CPs through the integration of machine learning (ML), molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and experiments. With 154 Tg data collected, an ML model is developed by taking simplified “geometry” of six chemical building blocks as molecular features, where side-chain fraction, isolated rings, fused rings, and bridged rings features are identified as the dominant ones for Tg. MD simulations further unravel the fundamental roles of those chemical building blocks in dynamical heterogeneity and local mobility of CPs at a molecular level. The developed ML model is demonstrated for its capability of predicting Tg of several new high-performance solar cell materials to a good approximation. The established predictive framework facilitates the design and prediction of Tg of complex CPs, paving the way for addressing device stability issues that have hampered the field from developing stable organic electronics.

Abstract: Summary
Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) is an emerging approach to solve the worldwide water crisis. Metal-organic frameworks and hydrogels have been extensively explored as sorbents for AWH; however, they suffer from relatively low water sorption capacity in arid conditions, a feature innately owned by a common material: deliquescent sorbents. Deliquescent sorbents are, however, limited by inevitable water leakage and restricted capacity. Here, we develop an efficient AWH approach that achieves an excellent water harvesting capacity of 2.62 g/g even in arid conditions by designing devices consisting of a superhydrophilic inside matrix loaded with deliquescent sorbents for efficient water adsorption, superhydrophobic and elastic fibrous skin for adaptative expansion, and water leakage prevention. The fibrous skin also exhibits a preferred radiative cooling effect, extending effective humidity and sorption capacity. The all-in-one design that combines heterogeneous wettability, radiative cooling, and elasticity-induced adaptivity opens a new route for addressing water challenges in a wide range of working conditions.

Abstract: tT cells migrate to lymphoid organs to become activated through specific contacts with antigen-presenting cells bearing foreign antigens. During migration and activation, T lymphocytes are exposed not only to diverse biochemical inputs, but also to different mechanical conditions. Passage from the blood or lymph to solid tissues involves lymphocyte rolling, firm arrest and diapedesis through endothelial monolayers. Throughout this process, cells are subjected to diverse fluid flow regimes. After extravasation, T lymphocytes crawl through viscoelastic media of different biochemical and mechanical properties and geometries. In lymph nodes, T cell contact with antigen-presenting cells is guided by rigidity cues and ligand-receptor interactions. T lymphocyte adaptation to diverse mechanical regimes involves multiple signaling and morphological modifications, many of which enable the conversion of mechanical forces into biochemical signals and vice-versa. These components enable T lymphocyte survival, homing and activation. Here, we review the mechanisms that enable T lymphocytes to survive and thrive under the different mechanical conditions they encounter during their life cycle. These processes require the integration of diverse signaling networks that convert extracellular mechano-chemical cues into force, movement and activation.

Abstract: Summary
Graphene nanoporous membranes are the ultimate ultrathin nanoporous membranes and have enormous potential applications due to efficient heat and mass transfer that is limited only by interfacial evaporation kinetics. Developing such membranes requires fundamental understanding of evaporation at the single-pore level, which has remained largely unexplored. Herein, we report the experimental study of kinetically limited evaporation from single/multiple circular graphene nanopores with diameters from 24 to 347 nm. We show that, despite a wide variation, the evaporation flux increases as nanopore diameter decreases and that the maximum evaporation flux exceeds the upper kinetic limit predicted by the classical Hertz-Knudsen relation for nanopores with diameters below 60 nm. We associate the enhancement with edge-facilitated evaporation and minimum contaminant accumulation at the liquid-vapor interface. We further find that such enhanced ultrafast evaporation exhibits a temperature-insensitive but diameter-dependent manner. Our work provides new insights into nanoscale evaporation and will shed light on developing 2D nanomaterials-based membrane evaporators.

Abstract: Summary
Stable, rapid, and large-scale production of high-quality, large-size two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals single crystals is an important prerequisite for realizing the potential of highly integrated 2D devices. Here, we report a chloride-mediated chemical vapor transport (CVT) approach to achieve large-scale production of MoTe2 and WTe2 single crystals with lateral sizes up to 2 cm and extremely high quality. The largest magnetoresistance and carrier mobility can reach 170% and 1,390.09 cm2 V-1 s-1 for 2H-MoTe2 crystals and 506,017% and 11,952.10 cm2 V-1 s-1 for Td-WTe2 crystals, respectively, and all are among the best reported ones. Compared with the conventional CVT method, which has a long growth cycle and much reactive reagent surplus, the growth speed of the current method is about 73 to 9,144 times faster, with ultrahigh yields of nearly 100%. The high crystallinity guarantees the crystals can be easily exfoliated to large-scale 2D crystals down to monolayers for assembling 2D high-performance devices.

Abstract: Summary
By adopting structural conformations with sub-nanometer precision, nature creates highly concentrated pigment-protein arrays to capture solar energy with high efficiency. Synthetic analogs of such systems exhibit concentration-dependent fluorescence quenching when approaching pigment concentrations of that seen in biological systems. Here, we report on systems of acid-functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes and aminophenyl tetraporphyrins that create a novel synthetic pigment-scaffold complex. The complex does not follow the trend of typical fluorescence quenching. Our steady-state and time-resolved data suggest an optimal concentration that offers a luminescence enhancement compared with the expected standard Stern-Volmer quenching relationship. The quenching is modified by controlling the pigment-distance via agglomerate size to near the upper limit for Dexter transfer of 10 Å as confirmed by dynamic light scattering measurements and chromophore-chromophore distance calculations. Our results highlight a synthetic complex with facile synthesis to investigate resonant electron transfer processes that do not follow traditional luminescence self-quenching relationships.

Abstract: Summary
Solid-state lithium-metal batteries possess intrinsic advantages in terms of both safety and energy density. However, the fundamental origin of electrochemical lithium deposition heterogeneity in solid-state batteries is much less understood than that in lithium-metal batteries using a liquid electrolyte, partly due to the difficulties of directly mapping lithium-deposition reaction fronts and the associated changes in local stress of the solid-state electrolyte. Here, we trace the evolution of three-dimensional microscopic stress and demonstrate that the stress distribution is rather broad in a garnet solid-state electrolyte during processing and battery cycling using confocal Raman spectroscopy. We further discuss the effect of local stress variations on the overpotential of lithium deposition as the most likely origin of lithium-deposition heterogeneity in garnet systems. The ex situ stress-mapping tool developed in this work provides a strong basis for understanding the electromechanical effects, a prerequisite to fully unlock the potential of solid-state lithium-metal batteries.

Abstract: The evolutionary relationship of cells within tissues having a similar function but located in different anatomical sites is of considerable biological interest. The development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) protocols has greatly enhanced opportunities to address this topic. Here we focus on cells in the epithelium which lines two regions of the human respiratory tract and the male genital ducts to delineate the shared, differentiated functions of the different cell populations. Transcriptomic data were used to assess the gene expression profiles of human bronchial, nasal, and epididymal epithelium (HBE, HNE, and HEE). Bulk RNA-seq showed many shared genes expressed in cells from the nasal and bronchial epithelium and highlighted their divergence from the epididymal epithelium. ScRNA-seq in HBE and HNE cells demonstrated overlapping gene expression patterns within basal and secretory cell populations. Moreover, the distribution of cell types was altered in HNE cells derived from donors with cystic fibrosis (CF) when compared to cells from healthy donors. Next, the HBE and HNE datasets were merged and confirmed intersection of cell type gene expression profiles from the two sites. However, secretory and ciliated cells were the most abundant types in the HBE samples, while more basal cells were seen in the HNE populations. We then merged single-cell data from the epididymis to determine if overlapping functions of these cells corresponded to those in the airway. Of note, only the pulmonary ionocytes/epididymis clear cells showed a strongly conserved identity, which was confirmed by imputation in bulk RNA-seq datasets from the same cells.

Abstract: Summary
Among the many environmental problems affecting human health and safety, air and water pollution affect millions of people globally. H2O2 is a clean oxidant for production of hydroxyl radicals (OH⋅) that decomposes nearly all organic pollutants. However, electro-Fenton (EF) strategies for producing H2O2 are still unsatisfactory because of intermittent production, negative decomposition, and the wide use of pure O2 or/and proton exchange membranes. Here we report a wood-derived solid ionic conductor (WSIC) to propose a solid EF strategy for continuous cathodic production of giant H2O2 using only air and water. Effective activation of H2O2 by FeOCl generates OH⋅, which continuously degrades aqueous (99.9%, Rhodamine B) or mineralizes gaseous toluene into CO2 and H2O at room temperature. Our findings are a fundamental step toward development of next-generation of advanced oxidation processes that are sustainable and cost effective.

Abstract: Summary
A water droplet impacting onto a supercooled surface is typically considered to freeze and adhere to the substrate. This ice accretion poses safety and economic threats to transportation infrastructure, power generation/transmission systems, and telecommunication facilities. Here we report the observation of ultra-low ice-substrate adhesion (0–50 kPa) and remarkable self-deicing during droplet-impact freezing on copper surfaces having medium to high supercooling (30°C–80°C). Mechano-thermo-hydraulic coupling during droplet-impact freezing governs the ice-substrate adhesion by gapping the droplet-substrate contact, enabling self-peeling facilitated by thermal-mechanical stress relaxation. We observe a strong adhesion region in the center of the frozen droplet, which determines the adhesion strength, and develop a regime map to delineate the dependence of adhesion/peeling on droplet inertia, substrate supercooling, and surface wettability. Our work demonstrates key mechanisms governing ice-substrate adhesion during impact icing and presents an approach to passive self-deicing.

Abstract: Objective
In order to clarify the interaction mechanism, the phenotype and abnormal gene loci of FXI, FXII, and PS were investigated in this study.
Methods
Chinese pedigree with hereditary combined deficiency of coagulation factor (F) XI, FXII, and PS was enrolled in our study. Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), partial thromboplastin time (PT), FXI:C, FXII:C, and protein S (PS):C were determined using the one-stage coagulation method. FXI:antigen (Ag), FXII:Ag, and PS:Ag were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Exons and introns of the FXI, FXII, and PS genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and gene sequencing results were analyzed using Chromas software.
Results
A deletion of two bases located in introns A-149 and-150 within the FXI gene of the proband, his father, wife, and both sons. A missense variant in exon 14 (GGT → AGT, Gly542Ser) within FXII of the proband, his parents, and both sons. Four variants in exon 4 within the PS gene of all members of the pedigree: GTT → GTG (Val46Val), CGC → CTC (Arg49Leu), CGT → CAT (Arg60His), and CAG → TAG (Gln61stop).
Conclusions
None of the pedigree members showed a tendency for bleeding or thrombosis. Therefore, we speculated that the lack of coagulation factors counteracted the lack of PS, restoring the balance between the coagulation and anticoagulation systems. Another possible explanation is that these defects individually have only partial penetrance.

Abstract: Summary
Object localization through active elastic waves is a crucial technology but generally requires a transducer array with complex hardware. Although computational sensing can overcome the shortcomings of transducer array by merging artificially designed structures into the sensing process, coding spatial elastic waves for active object sensing is still a knowledge gap. Here, we propose a scattering-coded architectured boundary composed of randomly distributed scatterers for computational sensing of objects with a single transducer. The multiple scattering effects of the architectured boundary introduce complexity into scattered fields to achieve a highly uncorrelated scattering coding of Lamb waves, thereby eliminating the ambiguity of the object location information. We demonstrate that the object locations can be uniquely identified by using the scattering-coded architectured boundary. The proposed strategy opens avenues for artificially designed boundaries with the capability of information coding and identification, providing important applications in wave sensing such as human-machine interactions and structural monitoring.

Abstract: Summary
Surface- or bulk-passivation using organic additives plays a critical role in improving the performance and stability of hybrid perovskite solar cells (HPSCs). Here, we report 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA) as an additive to reduce crystallization and passivate defects. Because of the dual functionality of the HEA additive, the optimized HPSCs yield 22.05% and 21.46% power conversion efficiency (PCE), respectively, for mesostructured negative-intrinsic-positive (n-i-p)- and planar positive-intrinsic-negative (p-i-n)-type device configurations, which is much higher than control devices. Large devices with 1 cm2 active area also produce a promising 20.03% PCE, which is comparable to the current efficiency. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS) measurement analysis indicates the HEA settles not only in grain boundaries but also within the perovskite grain, which facilitates passivation and suppresses halogen-ion migration. Importantly, photostability analysis reveals negligible efficiency loss over 1,000 h under continuous 1 sun illumination under different environmental conditions.

Abstract: Unexplained infertility affects about one-third of infertile couples and is defined as the failure to identify the cause of infertility despite extensive evaluation of the male and female partners. Therefore, there is a need for a multiparametric approach to study sperm function. Recently, we developed a Fluorescence-Based Ratiometric Analysis of Sperm Centrioles (FRAC) assay to determine sperm centriole quality. Here, we perform a pilot study of sperm from 10 fertile men and 10 men in couples with unexplained infertility, using three centriolar biomarkers measured at three sperm locations from two sperm fractions, representing high and low sperm quality. We found that FRAC can identify men from couples with unexplained infertility as the likely source of infertility. Higher quality fractions from 10 fertile individuals were the reference population. All 180 studied FRAC values in the 10 fertile individuals fell within the reference population range. Eleven of the 180 studied FRAC values in the 10 infertile patients were outliers beyond the 95% confidence intervals (P = 0.0008). Three men with unexplained infertility had outlier FRAC values in their higher quality sperm fraction, while four had outlier FRAC values in their lower quality sperm fraction (3/10 and 4/10, P = 0.060 and P = 0.025, respectively), suggesting that these four individuals are infertile due, in part, to centriolar defects. We propose that a larger scale study should be performed to determine the ability of FRAC to identify male factor infertility and its potential contribution to sperm multiparametric analysis.

Abstract: Summary
Conjugated polymers (CPs) that have both a high extinction coefficient (ε) and a high photothermal conversion efficiency (η) in the second near-infrared (NIR-II) region (1,000–1,700 nm) are highly desirable for photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and photothermal therapy (PTT). Here, we report that introducing polycyclic, auxochromic, and coplanar effects together into conjugated backbones affords isoindigo-based CPs with strong absorption and high η in the NIR-II region. Water-dispersed nanoparticles (NPs) of the typical polymer P4TTD-OT, with an ε in mass of 37.1 g−1 cm−1 and an η of 72.9% at 1,064 nm, show superior PAI properties. PAI of 40 mm depth at 1,064 nm is achieved at a lower laser fluence of 7.0 mJ cm−2 with chicken breast muscle as a model tissue, while a signal-to-background ratio of up to 42 dB is realized in the in vivo NIR-II PAI using the 4T1 tumor-bearing mouse model. The NPs can also serve as an effective NIR-II nanoagent for PAI-guided PTT.

Abstract: We analysed iron biomarkers and their relationships in 30 subjects with HFE mutations and moderate hyperferritinaemia undergoing iron removal at our blood donation centre. Body mass index (BMI) and liver enzymes were assessed. Serum iron (SI), ferritin, transferrin saturation (TSAT), hepcidin and non-transferrin bound iron (NTBI) were measured serially. Seventeen subjects had p.C282Y/p.C282Y, nine p.C282Y/p.H63D, four p.H63D/p.H63D. Median age (p = 0.582), BMI (p = 0.500) and ferritin (p = 0.089) were comparable. At baseline, 12/17 p.C282Y/p.C282Y and 2/9 p.C282Y/p.H63D had measurable NTBI (p = 0.003). The p.C282Y/p.C282Y had higher TSAT (p < 0.001), lower hepcidin (p = 0.031) and hepcidin/ferritin ratio (p = 0.073). After treatment, iron indices were similar among groups, except TSAT (higher in p.C282Y/p.C282Y; p = 0.06). Strong relationships were observed between ferritin and TSAT (R = 0.71), NTBI and TSAT (R = 0.61), NTBI and SI (R = 0.54) in p.C282Y/p.C282Y. Hepcidin correlated weakly with ferritin in p.C282Y/p.C282Y (R = 0.37) but strongly in p.C282Y/p.H63D (R = 0.66) and p.H63D/p.H63D (R = 0.72), while relationships with TSAT were weak (R = 0.27), moderate (R = 0.55) and strong (R = 0.61), respectively. Low penetrance p.C282Y/p.C282Y phenotype displays hepcidin dysregulation and biochemical risk for iron toxicity.

Abstract: Summary
Abundant sodium resources provide compelling competitive advantage for sodium-ion battery (SIBs) applications. Correspondingly, it is urgently required to develop high-performance and low-cost anode materials for SIBs. Here, we report a composite of antimony nanoparticles anchored on N/S co-doped 3D carbon for superior SIB anodes. During the synthesis, NaCl exerts a “pinning effect” to restrict the growth of antimony in the carbon matrix and results in nano-sized antimony particles. Given the enhanced-charge/ion-transfer kinetics ensured by nano-Sb and the structural advantages derived from the N/S co-doped 3D porous carbon, which not only remain robust upon cycling but also undergo graphitization by the ion shuttle effect to stimulate a stronger electrochemical response during the activation process, this composite maintains a 98.9% capacity ratio over 20,000 cycles at 10 A g-1. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the degree of graphitization has a linear relationship with the ionic radius.

Abstract: Summary
Biological swarms produce movement patterns that enhance their viability and functionality. We investigate the importance of internal heterogeneity within a group for the generation and transformation of group movement patterns. We find that an increase in the activity difference between a pair of chemically reactive gels and the rest causes the gel group to evolve from irregular random motion to ordered periodic swing-forward and circular motions. Our results imply that internal heterogeneity within a group is a key factor in generating ordered motion patterns, such as linear or curved locomotion, and disperse or compact population distributions. Dynamical analysis of collective pattern transitions reveals that the location and level of activity of a few “leaders” act as control parameters for bifurcations of collective-motion patterns. Our results suggest a possible origin of swarm motion patterns and may also be used to tailor robot swarms to enhance flexibility and robustness.

Abstract: Introduction
Inflammatory response-induced coagulopathy is a common complication associated with severe form of covid-19 infection. Evidences suggest that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) play a significant role in triggering the immunothrombosis in this condition. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of surface neutrophilic myeloperoxidase (MPO) as NETosis biomarker for predicting the risk of covid-19-associated coagulopathies.
Methods
Covid-19 infection was assessed by real-time-PCR and plasma d-dimer levels were measured by ELFA. Based on the covid-19 infection and d-dimer level outcomes, patients were categorized into four groups. Any alteration in the serum level of IL-6, H3Cit and neutrophilic surface MPO were analyzed by CLIA, ELISA, and flow cytometry, respectively.
Results
H3Cit variations and different d-dimer values confirmed the association between NETosis and coagulopathies. Findings showed that the expression of neutrophilic MPO reduced in cases with NETosis, which was correlated with increased levels of H3Cit. ANC/MPO ratio was signified as a valuable marker to discriminate the covid-19 and non covid-19-associated coagulopathies and could be considered as a prognostic factor due to its noteworthy correlation with serum IL-6 concentration.
Conclusion
Declined levels of surface neutrophilic MPO in NETosis correlate with covid-19-associated coagulopathies and increased IL-6 levels, as a potential biomarker of covid-19 disease severity.

Abstract: Microglia are the most prominent immune resident cell population in the central nervous system (CNS). In the healthy CNS, microglia survey their surrounding microenvironment, through recurrent extension and retraction of filopodia-like membrane protrusions, without evident cell body displacement. Microglia undergo dramatic transcriptomic and shape changes upon brain insults or neurodegenerative disease states and adopt a classical immune effector function (producing an extensive array of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, chemokines, and reactive oxygen species) to re-establish tissue homeostasis. While the biophysical principles underlying microglia morphological changes remain elusive, several recent studies have highlighted the pivotal role of the actin and non-muscle myosin II filamentous cytoskeleton in this process. In this work, we discuss how subcellular topological patterning of the actin and myosin cytoskeleton can control microglial cell shape dynamics and how it can potentially feedback on their functional specialization, which is of great importance to understanding the mechanisms of microglial action in homeostatic conditions and CNS disease states.

Abstract: Cell migration is essential for a variety of biological processes, such as embryogenesis, wound healing, and the immune response. After more than a century of research—mainly on flat surfaces—, there are still many unknowns about cell motility. In particular, regarding how cells migrate within 3D matrices, which more accurately replicate in vivo conditions. We present a novel in silico model of 3D mesenchymal cell migration regulated by the chemical and mechanical profile of the surrounding environment. This in silico model considers cell’s adhesive and nuclear phenotypes, the effects of the steric hindrance of the matrix, and cells ability to degradate the ECM. These factors are crucial when investigating the increasing difficulty that migrating cells find to squeeze their nuclei through dense matrices, which may act as physical barriers. Our results agree with previous in vitro observations where fibroblasts cultured in collagen-based hydrogels did not durotax toward regions with higher collagen concentrations. Instead, they exhibited an adurotactic behavior, following a more random trajectory. Overall, cell’s migratory response in 3D domains depends on its phenotype, and the properties of the surrounding environment, that is, 3D cell motion is strongly dependent on the context.

Abstract: Summary
The decomposition of jet fuel at elevated temperatures leads to fuel fouling and deposit formation on metallic walls. Here, we develop and study an innovative sol-gel silicon dioxide (SiO2) hybrid anti-fouling coating to mitigate fuel fouling. Our coating has low surface roughness (<1 nm) and low surface energy (<12 mJ/m2), reducing the heterogeneous nucleation rate during deposition. The sol-gel SiO2, which forms the base coating, further minimizes exposure of the metal substrate to the fuel, which can act as a catalyst and increase the decomposition reaction rate. We tested the fouling behavior in a custom-built fuel fouling test loop. Tests were able to characterize the efficacy of our coatings and to benchmark performance with bare copper, stainless steel, and Inconel 600 metals as well as commercial anti-fouling coatings, such as alumina and SilcoTek. Our coating demonstrated reduced fouling rates of at least 96% when compared with bare samples.

Abstract: Summary
CO-selective metals (e.g., Ag) on Cu catalysts improve the selectivity of multi-carbon (C2+) products in electrochemical CO2 reduction. However, the origin of the improvement remains unclear due to the convolution of tandem and interface effects. Here, Ag@C@Cu core-shell catalysts were synthesized, in which the thin carbon interlayer inhibited the direct interaction between Ag and Cu while still allowing the reduction of CO2 on Ag, thus isolating the tandem effect from other effects. This catalyst produced higher ratios of ethanol to ethylene relative to the monometallic Cu catalyst, demonstrating that the locally increased CO concentration promoted the ethanol pathway over the ethylene pathway. Further, the selectivity of ethanol was optimized by tuning the thickness of the Cu shell. This work provides a rational approach to design core-shell catalysts for understanding structure-performance relationships and demonstrates the key role of the tandem effect in tuning the selectivity of C2+ products.

Abstract: Summary
Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is one of the highest mortality diseases in the world. It is critical to treat AMI patients within a few hours, which can explain the high mortality. However, timely diagnosis of AMI out of hospital is still challenging because of low accuracy, sophisticated testing procedures, and requirement of experienced professionals. Here, we propose ultra-sensitive, facile, and rapid detection of the AMI biomarker by using a three-dimensional affinity biosensor (3DA-biosensor), which uses a graphene field-effect transistor constructed with a superwetting hydrogel-aptamer hybrid layer. The 3DA-biosensor exhibits the high sensitivity, adjustable sensitive range, and self-filtration ability, evidenced by a limit of detection down to 1.08 × 10−9 nM in whole blood. Through preliminary application tests, the 3DA-biosensor enables the identification of positive or negative for patient samples within 5 min, with the accuracy rate over 94%, paving a way for convenient self-screening of AMI for the patients with suspected symptoms.

Abstract: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) participate in cell-stroma crosstalk within the tumor microenvironment and fibroblasts (Fb) contribute to tumor promotion in thyroid cancer. However, the role of tumor-stroma derived EVs still needs to be deciphered. We hypothesized that the interaction of thyroid tumor cells with Fb would liberate EVs with a specific proteomic profile, which would have an impact on EV-functionality in thyroid tumor progression-related events. Tumor (TPC-1, 8505c) and non-tumor (NThyOri) thyroid cells were co-cultured with human Fb. EVs, obtained by ultracentrifugation of conditioned media, were characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis and western blotting. EV-proteomic analysis was performed by mass-spectrometry, and metalloproteinases (MMPs) were studied by zymography. EV-exchange was evaluated using immunofluorescence, confocal microscopy and FACS. EVs expressed classical exosome markers, with EVs from thyroid tumor cell-Fb co-cultures showing a proteomic profile related to extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. Bidirectional crosstalk between Fb and TPC-1 cells produced significantly more EVs than their isolated cells, and potentiated EV-functionality. In line with this, Fb-TPC-1 derived EVs induced MMP2 activation in NThyOri supernatants, and MMP2 activity could be evidenced in Fb and TPC-1 contact-independent co-cultures. Besides, MMP2 interactors allowed us to discriminate between EVs from thyroid tumoral and non-tumoral milieus. Interestingly, Fb internalized more EVs from TPC-1 than from NThyOri producing cells. Fb and thyroid tumor cell crosstalk produces specialized EVs with an ECM remodeling proteomic profile, enabling activation of MMP2 and possibly facilitating ECM-degradation, which is potentially linked with thyroid tumor progression.

Abstract: Summary
Photochemistry and photocatalysis are promising approaches to derive solar energy for solving the global energy and environment crisis. However, some practical aspects remain daunting, mainly due to the slow reaction kinetics, especially for multiphase reactions involving gaseous reactants. Here, we report that the oxidation of methyl orange, golden orange II, and levoglucosan by Fe(III)-oxalate photochemistry and by g-C3N4 photocatalysis can be significantly increased (up to two orders of magnitude) with decreasing microdroplet diameter, from around 2,000 to 100 μm. Using simulated Raman scattering microscopy, we observe strong interface enrichment and pH alternation within the microdroplets. Experimental and theoretical results indicate that the rate increase is mainly caused by the size-dependent air-water interface properties of microdroplets. Furthermore, we demonstrate the scalability of microdroplet photoreactions. This work not only provides an efficient pathway for improving the photochemistry and photocatalysis efficiencies but also shows important implications for atmospheric photochemistry.

Abstract: Summary
Renewable generation of fuels using solar energy is a promising technology whose deployment hinges on the discovery of materials with a combination of durability and solar-to-chemical conversion efficiency that has yet to be demonstrated. Stable operation of photoanodes has been demonstrated with wide-gap semiconductors, as well as protected visible gap semiconductors. Visible photoresponse from electrochemically stable materials is quite rare. In this paper, we report the high-throughput discovery of an amorphous Ni-Sb (1:1) oxide photoanode that meets the requirements of operational stability, visible photoresponse, and appreciable photovoltage. X-ray absorption characterization of Ni and Sb establishes a structural connection to rutile NiSb2O6, guiding electronic structure characterization via X-ray photoelectron experiments and density functional theory. This amorphous photoanode opens avenues for photoelectrode development due to the lack of crystal anisotropy combined with its operational stability, which mitigates the formation of an interphase that disrupts the semiconductor-electrolyte junction.

Abstract: Summary
One key factor that affects the reaction yield and selectivity of nanoparticle-catalyzed photochemical reactions is the type of hole scavengers. In this work, we examine the effect of hole scavengers in photoreduction of nitrobenzene catalyzed by cadmium sulfide quantum dots. We discover that the hole scavengers can determine the reduction pathway as well as the final product. Specifically, when methanol is the solvent and the sole hole scavenger, or when it is used in conjunction with ascorbic acid, ammonium formate, mercaptopropionic acid, or sodium borohydride, the reaction follows a direct reduction pathway. In contrast, with methanol and sodium sulfite, the reaction proceeds via a coupling route. Some hole scavengers directly participate in the redox reaction of intermediates. This study demonstrates that the type of hole scavenger can alter the reaction pathways and determine the reaction outcome and should be chosen with careful consideration.

Abstract: Summary
An appropriate electron transport layer (ETL) with better energy alignment and enhanced charge transfer, thereby helping efficient extraction and transport of photogenerated carriers, is essential to achieve the creation of high-performance devices. In this work, we use functionalized MXene modified with fluoroalkylsilane and dodecyltrimethoxysilane molecules, denoted as SnO2-MF and SnO2-MH, as nanosheet dopants in the SnO2 ETL. From density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ultraviolet photoelectron spectra (UPS) spectra, we see that better band alignment is achieved for the SnO2-MH ETL. Meanwhile, functionalized MXene nanosheets represent high electrical conductivity and mobility and could form zero Schottky barrier heterojunction with SnO2, effectively and rapidly enhancing carrier transfer. Finally, the suitable surface energy achieved by functionalized MXene additives can enlarge the grain size of perovskite thin films. Consequently, a significant improvement of power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 20.98% to 23.66% (24.12% for the champion device with a fill factor [FF] over 0.84) can be achieved for devices based on the SnO2-MH ETL, which also possess improved moisture resistance and operational stability.

Abstract: Homeodomain only protein (Hopx, HOPX) is a highly evolutionarily conserved, homeodomain-containing, small protein expressed in multiple tissues and cell types, including those of hematopoietic origin. The quasi-ubiquitous presence of Hopx contrasts with its specialized and context-dependent roles in various cell lineages. Recently, versatile functions of Hopx have been revealed in immune cells, including T lymphocytes with effector and regulatory roles. The induction of Hopx expression can indicate early developmental and differentiation pathways, and early Hopx expression characterizes the recently identified pre-effector T cells that become destined for subsequent effector differentiation. Further, specific molecular mechanisms of Hopx are indispensable for the functional homeostasis of peripherally induced regulatory T cells (pTreg cells). Here we offer a perspective on these diverse roles of Hopx in immune cells and discuss the recent advances that helped to clarify the relevant functions and mechanisms of Hopx.

Abstract: The link between hyperuricemia (HUA) and the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) has been well established. However, the mechanisms of thrombus generation and the effect of HUA on procoagulant activity (PCA) of erythrocytes remain unclear no matter in uremia or hyperuricemia. Here, phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure, microparticles (MPs) release, cytosolic Ca2+, TMEM16F expression, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation of erythrocyte were detected by flow cytometer. PCA was assessed by coagulation time, purified coagulation complex and fibrin production assays. The fibrin formation was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). We found that PS exposure, MPs generation, TMEM16F expression and consequent PCA of erythrocyte in HUA patients significantly increased compared to those in healthy volunteers. Furthermore, high UA induced PS exposure, and MPs release of erythrocyte in concentration and time-dependent manners in vitro, which enhanced the PCA of erythrocyte and was inhibited by lactadherin, a PS inhibitor. Additionally, using SEM, we also observed compact fibrin clots with highly-branched networks and thin fibers supported by red blood cells (RBCs) and RBC-derived MPs (RMPs). Importantly, we demonstrated UA enhanced the production of ROS and lipid peroxidation and reduced the generation of glutathione (GSH) of erythrocyte, which enhanced TMEM16F activity and followed PS externalization and RMPs formation. Collectively, these results suggest that Ca2+-dependent TMEM16F activation may be responsible for UA-induced PS exposure and MPs release of RBC, which thereby contribute to the prothrombotic risk in HUA.

Abstract: The T cell-mediated immune responses associated with asymptomatic infection (AS) of SARS-CoV-2 remain largely unknown. The diversity of T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire is essential for generating effective immunity against viral infections in T cell response. Here, we performed the single-cell TCR sequencing of the PBMC samples from five AS subjects, 33 symptomatic COVID-19 patients and eleven healthy controls to investigate the size and the diversity of TCR repertoire. We subsequently analyzed the TCR repertoire diversity, the V and J gene segment deference, and the dominant combination of αβ VJ gene pairing among these three study groups. Notably, we revealed significant TCR preference in the AS group, including the skewed usage of TRAV1-2-J33-TRBV6-4-J2-2 and TRAV1-2-J33-TRBV6-1-J2-3. Our findings may shed new light on understanding the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 and help identify optimal TCRs for development of novel therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Abstract: Summary
External short circuiting (ESC) is a main source of battery faults. However, the ESC damage mechanism and its evolution process are unclear, resulting in difficulties in safety management. Here, we report the impact of different ESC durations on battery performance and divide the ESC process into four stages. The analysis reveals that there is a benign regime in which the ESC effect is comparable to nominal charge-discharge cycling. When ESC duration is close to a critical time, there is a benign-to-malignant transition. The critical time corresponds to the inflection point at the end of battery current curve, which reflects heating-induced membrane melting and contraction that distorts the jellyroll. The critical time surface under various conditions is established and the center temperatures of the critical time and battery completely failure are disclosed, paving the way for fault diagnosis and using “benign ESC” in a controlled fashion.

Abstract: Cranial sutures are dynamic structures in which stem cell biology, bone formation, and mechanical forces interface, influencing the shape of the skull throughout development and beyond. Over the past decade, there has been significant progress in understanding mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) differentiation in the context of suture development and genetic control of suture pathologies, such as craniosynostosis. More recently, the mechanosensory function of sutures and the influence of mechanical signals on craniofacial development have come to the forefront. There is currently a gap in understanding of how mechanical signals integrate with MSC differentiation and ossification to ensure appropriate bone development and mediate postnatal growth surrounding sutures. In this review, we discuss the role of mechanosensation in the context of cranial sutures, and how mechanical stimuli are converted to biochemical signals influencing bone growth, suture patency, and fusion through mediation of cell differentiation. We integrate key knowledge from other paradigms where mechanosensation forms a critical component, such as bone remodeling and orthodontic tooth movement. The current state of the field regarding genetic, cellular, and physiological mechanisms of mechanotransduction will be contextualized within suture biology.
