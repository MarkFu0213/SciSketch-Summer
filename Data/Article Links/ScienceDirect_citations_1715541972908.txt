Abstract: Summary
Dicer controls the biogenesis of microRNAs (miRNAs) and is essential for neurogenesis. Recent reports show that the levels and substrate selectivity of DICER result in the preferential biogenesis of specific miRNAs in vitro. However, how dicer expression levels and miRNA biogenesis are regulated in vivo and how this affects neurogenesis is incompletely understood. Here we show that during zebrafish hindbrain development dicer expression levels are controlled by miR-107 to tune the biogenesis of specific miRNAs, such as miR-9, whose levels regulate neurogenesis. Loss of miR-107 function stabilizes dicer levels and miR-9 biogenesis across the ventricular hindbrain zone, resulting in an increase of both proliferating progenitors and postmitotic neurons. miR-9 ectopic accumulation in differentiating neuronal cells recapitulated the excessive neurogenesis phenotype. We propose that miR-107 modulation of dicer levels in differentiating neuronal cells is required to maintain the homeostatic levels of specific miRNAs, whose precise accumulation is essential for neurogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Increasing chemotherapy delivery to tumors, while enhancing drug uptake and reducing side effects, is a primary goal of cancer research. In mouse and human cancer models in vivo, we show that coadministration of low-dose Cilengitide and Verapamil increases tumor angiogenesis, leakiness, blood flow, and Gemcitabine delivery. This approach reduces tumor growth, metastasis, and minimizes side effects while extending survival. At a molecular level, this strategy alters Gemcitabine transporter and metabolizing enzyme expression levels, enhancing the potency of Gemcitabine within tumor cells in vivo and in vitro. Thus, the dual action of low-dose Cilengitide, in vessels and tumor cells, improves chemotherapy efficacy. Overall, our data demonstrate that vascular promotion therapy is a means to improve cancer treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Although persistent elevations in circulating glucose concentrations promote compensatory increases in pancreatic islet mass, unremitting insulin resistance causes deterioration in beta cell function that leads to the progression to diabetes. Here, we show that mice with a knockout of the CREB coactivator CRTC2 in beta cells have impaired oral glucose tolerance due to decreases in circulating insulin concentrations. CRTC2 was found to promote beta cell function in part by stimulating the expression of the transcription factor MafA. Chronic hyperglycemia disrupted cAMP signaling in pancreatic islets by activating the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF1)-dependent induction of the protein kinase A inhibitor beta (PKIB), a potent inhibitor of PKA catalytic activity. Indeed, disruption of the PKIB gene improved islet function in the setting of obesity. These results demonstrate how crosstalk between nutrient and hormonal pathways contributes to loss of pancreatic islet function.

Hox Proteins Act as Transcriptional Guarantors to Ensure Terminal Differentiation,

Abstract: Summary
Cell differentiation usually occurs with high fidelity, but the expression of many transcription factors is variable. Using the touch receptor neurons (TRNs) in C. elegans, we found that the Hox proteins CEH-13/lab and EGL-5/Abd-B overcome this variability by facilitating the activation of the common TRN fate determinant mec-3 in the anterior and posterior TRNs, respectively. CEH-13 and EGL-5 increase the probability of mec-3 transcriptional activation by the POU-homeodomain transcription factor UNC-86 using the same Hox/Pbx binding site. Mutation of ceh-13 and egl-5 resulted in an incomplete (∼40%) loss of the TRN fate in respective TRNs, which correlates with quantitative mRNA measurements showing two distinct modes (all or none) of mec-3 transcription. Therefore, Hox proteins act as transcriptional “guarantors” in order to ensure reliable and robust gene expression during terminal neuronal differentiation. Guarantors do not activate gene expression by themselves but promote full activation of target genes regulated by other transcription factors.

Abstract: Summary
We provide microarray data comparing genome-wide differential expression and pathology throughout life in four lines of “amyloid” transgenic mice (mutant human APP, PSEN1, or APP/PSEN1) and “TAU” transgenic mice (mutant human MAPT gene). Microarray data were validated by qPCR and by comparison to human studies, including genome-wide association study (GWAS) hits. Immune gene expression correlated tightly with plaques whereas synaptic genes correlated negatively with neurofibrillary tangles. Network analysis of immune gene modules revealed six hub genes in hippocampus of amyloid mice, four in common with cortex. The hippocampal network in TAU mice was similar except that Trem2 had hub status only in amyloid mice. The cortical network of TAU mice was entirely different with more hub genes and few in common with the other networks, suggesting reasons for specificity of cortical dysfunction in FTDP17. This Resource opens up many areas for investigation. All data are available and searchable at http://www.mouseac.org.

Abstract: Summary
Cytoplasmic RNA granules play a central role in mRNA metabolism, but the importance of mitochondrial RNA granules remains relatively unexplored. We characterized their proteome and found that they contain a large toolbox of proteins dedicated to RNA metabolism. Investigation of four uncharacterized putative RNA-binding proteins—two RNA helicases, DHX30 and DDX28, and two proteins of the Fas-activated serine-threonine kinase (FASTKD) family, FASTKD2 and FASTKD5—demonstrated that both helicases and FASTKD2 are required for mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis showed that DDX28 and FASTKD2 bound the 16S rRNA. FASTKD5 is required for maturing precursor mRNAs that are not flanked by tRNAs and that therefore cannot be processed by the canonical mRNA maturation pathway. Silencing FASTKD5 rendered mature COX I mRNA almost undetectable, which severely reduced the synthesis of COX I, resulting in a complex IV assembly defect. These data demonstrate that mitochondrial RNA granules are centers for posttranscriptional RNA processing and the biogenesis of mitochondrial ribosomes.

Abstract: Summary
Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies are major drivers of autoimmune pathology, but they are also used in the form of intravenous IgG (IVIg) therapy to suppress autoantibody activity. To identify the pathways underlying human autoantibody and IVIg activity, we established a humanized mouse model of an autoantibody-dependent autoimmune disease responding to treatment with IVIg preparations. We show that the human IgG subclass strongly impacts autoantibody activity and that the Fc-receptor genotype of the human donor immune system further modulates autoantibody activity. Human mononuclear phagocytes were responsible for autoantibody activity, and IVIg therapy was able to suppress disease pathology in an Fc-fragment-dependent manner. While highly sialylated IgG glycovariants were essential for IVIg activity, it was independent of the Fc-receptor genotype and did not result in a general block of activating or the neonatal Fc-receptor. These findings may help in the development of strategies to block autoantibody and enhance therapeutic IVIg activity in humans.

Abstract: Summary
Polarized sorting of newly synthesized proteins to the somatodendritic and axonal domains of neurons occurs by selective incorporation into distinct populations of vesicular transport carriers. An unresolved issue is how the vesicles themselves are sorted to their corresponding neuronal domains. Previous studies concluded that the axon initial segment (AIS) is an actin-based filter that selectively prevents passage of somatodendritic vesicles into the axon. We find, however, that most somatodendritic vesicles fail to enter the axon at a more proximal region in the axon hillock, herein referred to as the pre-axonal exclusion zone (PAEZ). Forced coupling of a somatodendritic cargo protein to an axonally directed kinesin is sufficient to drive transport of whole somatodendritic vesicles through the PAEZ toward the distal axon. Based on these findings, we propose that polarized sorting of transport vesicles occurs at the PAEZ and depends on the ability of the vesicles to acquire an appropriately directed microtubule motor.

Abstract: Summary
Molecular signatures specific to particular tumor types are required to design treatments for resistant tumors. However, it remains unclear whether tumors and corresponding cell lines used for drug development share such signatures. We developed similarity core analysis (SCA), a universal and unsupervised computational framework for extracting core molecular features common to tumors and cell lines. We applied SCA to mRNA/miRNA expression data from various sources, comparing melanoma cell lines and metastases. The signature obtained was associated with phenotypic characteristics in vitro, and the core genes CAPN3 and TRIM63 were implicated in melanoma cell migration/invasion. About 90% of the melanoma signature genes belong to an intrinsic network of transcription factors governing neural development (TFAP2A, DLX2, ALX1, MITF, PAX3, SOX10, LEF1, and GAS7) and miRNAs (211-5p, 221-3p, and 10a-5p). The SCA signature effectively discriminated between two subpopulations of melanoma patients differing in overall survival, and classified MEKi/BRAFi-resistant and -sensitive melanoma cell lines.

Abstract: Summary
Bacteria are central to human health and disease, but existing tools to edit microbial consortia are limited. For example, broad-spectrum antibiotics are unable to precisely manipulate bacterial communities. Bacteriophages can provide highly specific targeting of bacteria, but assembling well-defined phage cocktails solely with natural phages can be a time-, labor- and cost-intensive process. Here, we present a synthetic biology strategy to modulate phage host ranges by engineering phage genomes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We used this technology to redirect Escherichia coli phage scaffolds to target pathogenic Yersinia and Klebsiella bacteria, and conversely, Klebsiella phage scaffolds to target E. coli by modular swapping of phage tail components. The synthetic phages achieved efficient killing of their new target bacteria and were used to selectively remove bacteria from multi-species bacterial communities with cocktails based on common viral scaffolds. We envision this approach accelerating phage biology studies and enabling new technologies for bacterial population editing.

Abstract: Summary
Many genes that affect replicative lifespan (RLS) in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae also affect aging in other organisms such as C. elegans and M. musculus. We performed a systematic analysis of yeast RLS in a set of 4,698 viable single-gene deletion strains. Multiple functional gene clusters were identified, and full genome-to-genome comparison demonstrated a significant conservation in longevity pathways between yeast and C. elegans. Among the mechanisms of aging identified, deletion of tRNA exporter LOS1 robustly extended lifespan. Dietary restriction (DR) and inhibition of mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) exclude Los1 from the nucleus in a Rad53-dependent manner. Moreover, lifespan extension from deletion of LOS1 is nonadditive with DR or mTOR inhibition, and results in Gcn4 transcription factor activation. Thus, the DNA damage response and mTOR converge on Los1-mediated nuclear tRNA export to regulate Gcn4 activity and aging.

Abstract: Summary
Membrane trafficking of integrins plays a pivotal role in cell proliferation and migration. How endocytosed integrins are targeted either for recycling or lysosomal delivery is not fully understood. Here, we show that fibronectin (FN) binding to α5β1 integrin triggers ubiquitination and internalization of the receptor complex. Acidification facilitates FN dissociation from integrin α5β1 in vitro and in early endosomes, promoting receptor complex deubiquitination by the USP9x and recycling to the cell surface. Depending on residual ligand occupancy of receptors, some α5β1 integrins remain ubiquitinated and are captured by ESCRT-0/I, containing histidine domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase (HD-PTP) and ubiquitin-associated protein 1 (UBAP1), and are directed for lysosomal proteolysis, limiting receptor downstream signaling and cell migration. Thus, HD-PTP or UBAP1 depletion confers a pro-invasive phenotype. Thus, pH-dependent FN-integrin dissociation and deubiquitination of the activated integrin α5β1 are required for receptor resensitization and cell migration, representing potential targets to modulate tumor invasiveness.

Abstract: Most of the axons in the vertebrate nervous system are surrounded by a lipid-rich membrane called myelin, which promotes rapid conduction of nerve impulses and protects the axon from being damaged. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating disease of the CNS characterized by infiltration of immune cells and progressive damage to myelin and axons. One potential way to treat MS is to enhance the endogenous remyelination process, but at present there are no available treatments to promote remyelination in patients with demyelinating diseases. Sulfasalazine is an anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating drug that is used in rheumatology and inflammatory bowel disease. Its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties prompted us to test the ability of sulfasalazine to promote remyelination. In this study, we found that sulfasalazine promotes remyelination in the CNS of a transgenic zebrafish model of NTR/MTZ-induced demyelination. We also found that sulfasalazine treatment reduced the number of macrophages/microglia in the CNS of demyelinated zebrafish larvae, suggesting that the acceleration of remyelination is mediated by the immunomodulatory function of sulfasalazine. Our data suggest that temporal modulation of the immune response by sulfasalazine can be used to overcome MS by enhancing myelin repair and remyelination in the CNS.

Abstract: Summary
Morphogen signaling is critical for the growth and patterning of tissues in embryos and adults, but how morphogen signaling gradients are generated in tissues remains controversial. The morphogen Nodal was proposed to form a long-range signaling gradient via a reaction-diffusion system, on the basis of differential diffusion rates of Nodal and its antagonist Lefty. Here we use a specific zebrafish Nodal biosensor combined with immunofluorescence for phosphorylated Smad2 to demonstrate that endogenous Nodal is unlikely to diffuse over a long range. Instead, short-range Nodal signaling activation in a temporal window is sufficient to determine the dimensions of the Nodal signaling domain. The size of this temporal window is set by the differentially timed production of Nodal and Lefty, which arises mainly from repression of Lefty translation by the microRNA miR-430. Thus, temporal information is transformed into spatial information to define the dimensions of the Nodal signaling domain and, consequently, to specify mesendoderm.

Abstract: Summary
Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) mediates nonshivering thermogenesis and, upon cold exposure, is induced in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and subcutaneous white adipose tissue (iWAT). Here, by high-throughput screening using the UCP1 promoter, we identify Zfp516 as a transcriptional activator of UCP1 as well as PGC1α, thereby promoting a BAT program. Zfp516 itself is induced by cold and sympathetic stimulation through the cAMP-CREB/ATF2 pathway. Zfp516 directly binds to the proximal region of the UCP1 promoter, not to the enhancer region where other transcription factors bind, and interacts with PRDM16 to activate the UCP1 promoter. Although ablation of Zfp516 causes embryonic lethality, knockout embryos still show drastically reduced BAT mass. Overexpression of Zfp516 in adipose tissue promotes browning of iWAT even at room temperature, increasing body temperature and energy expenditure and preventing diet-induced obesity. Zfp516 may represent a future target for obesity therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear membrane microdomains are proposed to act as platforms for regulation of nuclear function, but little is known about the mechanisms controlling their formation. Organization of the plasma membrane is regulated by actin polymerization, and the existence of an actin pool in the nucleus suggests that a similar mechanism might operate here. We show that nuclear membrane organization and morphology are regulated by the nuclear level of active Rac1 through actin polymerization-dependent mechanisms. Rac1 nuclear export is mediated by two internal nuclear export signals and through its interaction with nucleophosmin-1 (B23), which acts as a Rac1 chaperone inside the nucleus. Rac1 nuclear accumulation alters the balance between cytosolic Rac1 and Rho, increasing RhoA signaling in the cytoplasm and promoting a highly invasive phenotype. Nuclear Rac1 shuttling is a finely tuned mechanism for controlling nuclear shape and organization and cell invasiveness.

Abstract: Summary
Microbial CRISPR-Cas systems are divided into Class 1, with multisubunit effector complexes, and Class 2, with single protein effectors. Currently, only two Class 2 effectors, Cas9 and Cpf1, are known. We describe here three distinct Class 2 CRISPR-Cas systems. The effectors of two of the identified systems, C2c1 and C2c3, contain RuvC-like endonuclease domains distantly related to Cpf1. The third system, C2c2, contains an effector with two predicted HEPN RNase domains. Whereas production of mature CRISPR RNA (crRNA) by C2c1 depends on tracrRNA, C2c2 crRNA maturation is tracrRNA independent. We found that C2c1 systems can mediate DNA interference in a 5′-PAM-dependent fashion analogous to Cpf1. However, unlike Cpf1, which is a single-RNA-guided nuclease, C2c1 depends on both crRNA and tracrRNA for DNA cleavage. Finally, comparative analysis indicates that Class 2 CRISPR-Cas systems evolved on multiple occasions through recombination of Class 1 adaptation modules with effector proteins acquired from distinct mobile elements.

Abstract: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key regulator of angiogenesis and thus contributes to many vasoproliferative retinopathies including retinopathy of prematurity. Based on the importance of canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channels in VEGF signaling, we firstly evaluated the expression of TRPC channels in mouse retina by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. All seven TRPC channels were expressed in mouse retina. TRPC4 channels were chosen for further analysis based on their upregulation on hypoxic retina according to the GEO database under the identifier GSE19886. Interestingly, TRPC4 suppression by intravitreal injection of siRNA against mTRPC4 significantly inhibited retinal neovascularization. To further investigate the effect of TRPC4 suppression on neovascularization, human retina microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs) that are responsible for initiating neovascularization in response to increased VEGF in OIR retina were transfected with siRNA against TRPC4. As we have expected, suppression of TRPC4 effectively inhibited VEGF-induced migration and tube formation as well. Further evaluation on VEGF signaling pathway by western blot analysis of signaling molecules discovered that VEGF-induced activation of ERK, p38 MAPK and AKT signaling pathways were inhibited by suppression of TRPC4. These findings suggest that suppression of TRPC4 could be an alternative therapeutic option for VEGF-induced retinal neovascularization.

Abstract: Summary
T cell engineering is a powerful means to rapidly generate anti-tumor T cells. The costimulatory properties of second-generation chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) determine the overall potency of adoptively transferred T cells. Using an in vivo “stress test” to challenge CD19-targeted T cells, we studied the functionality and persistence imparted by seven different CAR structures providing CD28 and/or 4-1BB costimulation. One configuration, which uses two signaling domains (CD28 and CD3ζ) and the 4-1BB ligand, provided the highest therapeutic efficacy, showing balanced tumoricidal function and increased T cell persistence accompanied by an elevated CD8/CD4 ratio and decreased exhaustion. Remarkably, induction of the IRF7/IFNβ pathway was required for optimal anti-tumor activity. Thus, 1928z-41BBL T cells possess strikingly potent intrinsic and immunomodulatory qualities.

Abstract: Summary
E-cadherin is the major adhesion receptor in epithelial adherens junctions, which connect cells to form tissues and are essential for morphogenesis and homeostasis. The mechanism by which E-cadherin monomers cluster and become organized in adherens junctions remains poorly understood. Here, using superresolution microscopy techniques in combination with structure-informed functional mutations, we found that loosely organized clusters of approximately five E-cadherin molecules that form independently of cis or trans interactions, and that are delimited by the cortical F-actin meshwork, are the precursors of trans-ligated adhesive clusters that make up the adherens junction. The density of E-cadherin clusters was wide ranged, and notably, we could detect densities consistent with the crystal lattice structure at the core of adhesive clusters, which were dependent on extracellular domain interactions. Thus, our results elucidate the nanoscale architecture of adherens junctions, as well as the molecular mechanisms driving its assembly.

Abstract: Summary
The generation of pancreas, liver, and intestine from a common pool of progenitors in the foregut endoderm requires the establishment of organ boundaries. How dorsal foregut progenitors activate pancreatic genes and evade the intestinal lineage choice remains unclear. Here, we identify Pdx1 and Sox9 as cooperative inducers of a gene regulatory network that distinguishes the pancreatic from the intestinal lineage. Genetic studies demonstrate dual and cooperative functions for Pdx1 and Sox9 in pancreatic lineage induction and repression of the intestinal lineage choice. Pdx1 and Sox9 bind to regulatory sequences near pancreatic and intestinal differentiation genes and jointly regulate their expression, revealing direct cooperative roles for Pdx1 and Sox9 in gene activation and repression. Our study identifies Pdx1 and Sox9 as important regulators of a transcription factor network that initiates pancreatic fate and sheds light on the gene regulatory circuitry that governs the development of distinct organs from multi-lineage-competent foregut progenitors.

Abstract: Summary
The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a model organism for replicative aging studies; however, conventional lifespan measurement platforms have several limitations. Here, we present a microfluidics platform that facilitates simultaneous lifespan and gene expression measurements of aging yeast cells. Our multiplexed high-throughput platform offers the capability to perform independent lifespan experiments using different yeast strains or growth media. Using this platform in minimal media environments containing glucose, we measured the full lifespan of individual yeast cells in wild-type and canonical gene deletion backgrounds. Compared to glucose, in galactose we observed a 16.8% decrease in replicative lifespan accompanied by an ∼2-fold increase in single-cell oxidative stress levels reported by PSOD1-mCherry. Using PGAL1-YFP to measure the activity of the bistable galactose network, we saw that OFF and ON cells are similar in their lifespan. Our work shows that aging cells are committed to a single phenotypic state throughout their lifespan.

Abstract: Neurons possess an elaborate system of endolysosomes. Recently, endolysosomes were found to have readily releasable stores of intracellular calcium; however, relatively little is known about how such ‘acidic calcium stores’ affect calcium signaling in neurons. Here we demonstrated in primary cultured neurons that calcium released from acidic calcium stores triggered calcium influx across the plasma membrane, a phenomenon we have termed “acidic store-operated calcium entry (aSOCE)”. aSOCE was functionally distinct from store-operated calcium release and calcium entry involving endoplasmic reticulum. aSOCE appeared to be governed by N-type calcium channels (NTCCs) because aSOCE was attenuated significantly by selectively blocking NTCCs or by siRNA knockdown of NTCCs. Furthermore, we demonstrated that NTCCs co-immunoprecipitated with the lysosome associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1), and that aSOCE is accompanied by increased cell-surface expression levels of NTCC and LAMP1 proteins. Moreover, we demonstrated that siRNA knockdown of LAMP1 or Rab27a, both of which are key proteins involved in lysosome exocytosis, attenuated significantly aSOCE. Taken together our data suggest that aSOCE occurs in neurons, that aSOCE plays an important role in regulating the levels and actions of intraneuronal calcium, and that aSOCE is regulated at least in part by exocytotic insertion of N-type calcium channels into plasma membranes through LAMP1-dependent lysosome exocytosis.

Abstract: Summary
Collective cell migration is a highly regulated morphogenetic movement during embryonic development and cancer invasion that involves the precise orchestration and integration of cell-autonomous mechanisms and environmental signals. Coordinated lateral line primordium migration is controlled by the regulation of chemokine receptors via compartmentalized Wnt/β-catenin and fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) signaling. Analysis of mutations in two exostosin glycosyltransferase genes (extl3 and ext2) revealed that loss of heparan sulfate (HS) chains results in a failure of collective cell migration due to enhanced Fgf ligand diffusion and loss of Fgf signal transduction. Consequently, Wnt/β-catenin signaling is activated ectopically, resulting in the subsequent loss of the chemokine receptor cxcr7b. Disruption of HS proteoglycan (HSPG) function induces extensive, random filopodia formation, demonstrating that HSPGs are involved in maintaining cell polarity in collectively migrating cells. The HSPGs themselves are regulated by the Wnt/β-catenin and Fgf pathways and thus are integral components of the regulatory network that coordinates collective cell migration with organ specification and morphogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The small GTPase Rab11 dynamically changes its location to regulate various cellular processes such as endocytic recycling, secretion, and cytokinesis. However, our knowledge of its upstream regulators is still limited. Here, we identify the RAB-11-interacting protein-1 (REI-1) as a unique family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for RAB-11 in Caenorhabditis elegans. Although REI-1 and its human homolog SH3-binding protein 5 do not contain any known Rab-GEF domains, they exhibited strong GEF activity toward Rab11 in vitro. In C. elegans, REI-1 is expressed in the germline and co-localizes with RAB-11 on the late-Golgi membranes. The loss of REI-1 specifically impaired the targeting of RAB-11 to the late-Golgi compartment and the recycling endosomes in embryos and further reduced the RAB-11 distribution to the cleavage furrow, which resulted in cytokinesis delay. These results suggest that REI-1 is a GEF specifically regulating the RAB-11 localization and functions in early embryos.

Abstract: Summary
DNA is wrapped in a left-handed fashion around histone octasomes containing the centromeric histone H3 variant CENP-A. However, DNA topology studies have suggested that DNA is wrapped in a right-handed manner around the CENP-A nucleosome that occupies the yeast point centromere. Here, we determine the DNA linking number difference (ΔLk) stabilized by the yeast centromere and the contribution of the centromere determining elements (CDEI, CDEII, and CDEIII). We show that the intrinsic architecture of the yeast centromere stabilizes +0.6 units of ΔLk. This topology depends on the integrity of CDEII and CDEIII, but it is independent of cbf1 binding to CDEI and of the variable length of CDEII. These findings suggest that the interaction of the CBF3 complex with CDEIII and a distal CDEII segment configures a right-handed DNA loop that excludes CDEI. This loop is then occupied by a CENP-A histone complex, which does not have to be inherently right-handed.

Abstract: Summary
Replication and transcription of influenza virus genome mainly depend on its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), composed of the PA, PB1, and PB2 subunits. Although extensively studied, the underlying mechanism of the RdRP complex is still unclear. Here we report the biochemical characterization of influenza RdRP subcomplex comprising PA, PB1, and N terminus of PB2, which exist as dimer in solution and can assemble into a tetramer state, regulated by vRNA promoter. Using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, we have reconstructed the RdRP tetramer complex at 4.3 Å, highlighting the assembly and interfaces between monomers within the tetrameric structure. The individual RdRP subcomplex contains all the characterized motifs and appears as a cage-like structure. High-throughput mutagenesis profiling revealed that residues involved in the oligomer state formation are critical for viral life cycle. Our results lay a solid base for understanding the mechanism of replication of influenza and other negative-stranded RNA viruses.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial division is essential for mitosis and metazoan development, but a mechanistic role in cancer biology remains unknown. Here, we examine the direct effects of oncogenic RASG12V-mediated cellular transformation on the mitochondrial dynamics machinery and observe a positive selection for dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), a protein required for mitochondrial network division. Loss of DRP1 prevents RASG12V-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and renders cells resistant to transformation. Conversely, in human tumor cell lines with activating MAPK mutations, inhibition of these signals leads to robust mitochondrial network reprogramming initiated by DRP1 loss resulting in mitochondrial hyper-fusion and increased mitochondrial metabolism. These phenotypes are mechanistically linked by ERK1/2 phosphorylation of DRP1 serine 616; DRP1S616 phosphorylation is sufficient to phenocopy transformation-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, and DRP1S616 phosphorylation status dichotomizes BRAFWT from BRAFV600E-positive lesions. These findings implicate mitochondrial division and DRP1 as crucial regulators of transformation with leverage in chemotherapeutic success.

Abstract: Summary
Alterations in mitophagy have been increasingly linked to aging and age-related diseases. There are, however, no convenient methods to analyze mitophagy in vivo. Here, we describe a transgenic mouse model in which we expressed a mitochondrial-targeted form of the fluorescent reporter Keima (mt-Keima). Keima is a coral-derived protein that exhibits both pH-dependent excitation and resistance to lysosomal proteases. Comparison of a wide range of primary cells and tissues generated from the mt-Keima mouse revealed significant variations in basal mitophagy. In addition, we have employed the mt-Keima mice to analyze how mitophagy is altered by conditions including diet, oxygen availability, Huntingtin transgene expression, the absence of macroautophagy (ATG5 or ATG7 expression), an increase in mitochondrial mutational load, the presence of metastatic tumors, and normal aging. The ability to assess mitophagy under a host of varying environmental and genetic perturbations suggests that the mt-Keima mouse should be a valuable resource.

Amphiphysin 2 Orchestrates Nucleus Positioning and Shape by Linking the Nuclear Envelope to the Actin and Microtubule Cytoskeleton,

Abstract: Summary
Nucleus positioning is key for intracellular organization, cell differentiation, and organ development and is affected in many diseases, including myopathies due to alteration in amphiphysin-2 (BIN1). The actin and microtubule cytoskeletons are essential for nucleus positioning, but their crosstalk in this process is sparsely characterized. Here, we report that impairment of amphiphysin/BIN1 in Caenorhabditis elegans, mammalian cells, or muscles from patients with centronuclear myopathy alters nuclear position and shape. We show that AMPH-1/BIN1 binds to nesprin and actin, as well as to the microtubule-binding protein CLIP170 in both species. Expression of the microtubule-anchoring CAP-GLY domain of CLIP170 fused to the nuclear-envelope-anchoring KASH domain of nesprin rescues nuclear positioning defects of amph-1 mutants. Amphiphysins thus play a central role in linking the nuclear envelope with the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons. We propose that BIN1 has a direct and evolutionarily conserved role in nuclear positioning, altered in myopathies.

Abstract: Summary
Type II CRISPR systems defend against invasive DNA by using Cas9 as an RNA-guided nuclease that creates double-stranded DNA breaks. Dual RNAs (CRISPR RNA [crRNA] and tracrRNA) are required for Cas9’s targeting activities observed to date. Targeting requires a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) and crRNA-DNA complementarity. Cas9 orthologs (including Neisseria meningitidis Cas9 [NmeCas9]) have also been adopted for genome engineering. Here we examine the DNA cleavage activities and substrate requirements of NmeCas9, including a set of unusually complex PAM recognition patterns. Unexpectedly, NmeCas9 cleaves single-stranded DNAs in a manner that is RNA guided but PAM and tracrRNA independent. Beyond the need for guide-target pairing, this “DNase H” activity has no apparent sequence requirements, and the cleavage sites are measured from the 5′ end of the DNA substrate’s RNA-paired region. These results indicate that tracrRNA is not strictly required for NmeCas9 enzymatic activation, and expand the list of targeting activities of Cas9 endonucleases.

Abstract: Summary
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide public health threat that increases risk of death due to cardiovascular complications, including left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Novel therapeutic targets are needed to design treatments to alleviate the cardiovascular burden of CKD. Previously, we demonstrated that circulating concentrations of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23 rise progressively in CKD and induce LVH through an unknown FGF receptor (FGFR)-dependent mechanism. Here, we report that FGF23 exclusively activates FGFR4 on cardiac myocytes to stimulate phospholipase Cγ/calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cell signaling. A specific FGFR4-blocking antibody inhibits FGF23-induced hypertrophy of isolated cardiac myocytes and attenuates LVH in rats with CKD. Mice lacking FGFR4 do not develop LVH in response to elevated FGF23, whereas knockin mice carrying an FGFR4 gain-of-function mutation spontaneously develop LVH. Thus, FGF23 promotes LVH by activating FGFR4, thereby establishing FGFR4 as a pharmacological target for reducing cardiovascular risk in CKD.

Abstract: Cyclophosphamide (CP), an alkylating antineoplastic agent is widely used in the treatment of solid tumors and B-cell malignant disease. It is known to cause urinary bladder damage due to inducing oxidative stress. Moringa oleifera (Mof) is commonly known as drumstick tree. Moringa leaves have been reported to be a rich source of β-carotene, protein, vitamin C, calcium, and potassium. It acts as a good source of natural antioxidants; due to the presence of various types of antioxidant compounds such as ascorbic acid, flavonoids, phenolics and carotenoids. The aim of this work was to test the possible antioxidant protective effects of M. oleifera leaves against CP induced urinary bladder toxicity in rats. Female Wister albino rats were divided into 4 groups. Group I served as control, received orally normal saline, group II received a single dose CP 100mg/kg intraperitoneally, group III and VI both received orally hydroethanolic extract of Mof; 500mg/kg and 1000mg/kg respectively daily for a week, 1h before and 4h after CP administration. Rats were sacrificed 24h after CP injection. The bladder was removed, sectioned, and subjected to light, transition electron microscopic studies, and biochemical studies (measuring the parameter of lipid peroxidation; malondialdehyde along with the activities of the antioxidant enzyme reduced glutathione). The bladders of CP treated rats showed ulcered mucosa, edematous, hemorrhagic, and fibrotic submucosa by light microscopy. Ultrastructure observation showed; losing large areas of uroepithelium, extended intercellular gaps, junction complexes were affected as well as damage of mitochondria in the form of swelling and destruction of cristae. Biochemical analysis showed significant elevation of malondialdhyde, while reduced glutathione activity was significantly lowered. From the results obtained in this work, we can say that Moringa leaves play an important role in ameliorating and protecting the bladder from CP toxicity.

Abstract: Summary
A major challenge in biology is determining how evolutionarily novel characters originate; however, mechanistic explanations for the origin of new characters are almost completely unknown. The evolution of pregnancy is an excellent system in which to study the origin of novelties because mammals preserve stages in the transition from egg laying to live birth. To determine the molecular bases of this transition, we characterized the pregnant/gravid uterine transcriptome from tetrapods to trace the evolutionary history of uterine gene expression. We show that thousands of genes evolved endometrial expression during the origins of mammalian pregnancy, including genes that mediate maternal-fetal communication and immunotolerance. Furthermore, thousands of cis-regulatory elements that mediate decidualization and cell-type identity in decidualized stromal cells are derived from ancient mammalian transposable elements (TEs). Our results indicate that one of the defining mammalian novelties evolved from DNA sequences derived from ancient mammalian TEs co-opted into hormone-responsive regulatory elements distributed throughout the genome.

Abstract: Summary
Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), a class of 26- to 32-nt non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), function in germline development, transposon silencing, and epigenetic regulation. We performed deep sequencing and annotation of untreated and periodate-treated small RNA cDNA libraries from human fetal and adult germline and reference somatic tissues. This revealed abundant piRNAs originating from 150 piRNA-encoding genes, including some exhibiting gender-specific expression, in fetal ovary and adult testis—developmental periods coinciding with mitotic cell divisions expanding fetal germ cells prior to meiotic divisions. The absence of reads mapping uniquely to annotated piRNA genes demonstrated their paucity in fetal testis and adult ovary and absence in somatic tissues. We curated human piRNA-expressing regions and defined their precise borders and observed piRNA-guided cleavage of transcripts antisense to some piRNA-producing genes. This study provides insights into sex-specific mammalian piRNA expression and function and serves as a reference for human piRNA analysis and annotation.

Abstract: Summary
Although the intrinsic antiviral cell defenses of many kingdoms utilize pathogen-specific small RNAs, the antiviral response of chordates is primarily protein based and not uniquely tailored to the incoming microbe. In an effort to explain this evolutionary bifurcation, we determined whether antiviral RNAi was sufficient to replace the protein-based type I interferon (IFN-I) system of mammals. To this end, we recreated an RNAi-like response in mammals and determined its effectiveness to combat influenza A virus in vivo in the presence and absence of the canonical IFN-I system. Mammalian antiviral RNAi, elicited by either host- or virus-derived small RNAs, effectively attenuated virus and prevented disease independently of the innate immune response. These data find that chordates could have utilized RNAi as their primary antiviral cell defense and suggest that the IFN-I system emerged as a result of natural selection imposed by ancient pathogens.

Abstract: Summary
Primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma (PMBCL) is an aggressive non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, predominantly affecting young patients. We analyzed 45 primary PMBCL tumor biopsies and 3 PMBCL-derived cell lines for the presence of genetic alterations involving the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II transactivator CIITA and found frequent aberrations consisting of structural genomic rearrangements, missense, nonsense, and frame-shift mutations (53% of primary tumor biopsies and all cell lines). We also detected intron 1 mutations in 47% of the cases, and detailed sequence analysis strongly suggests AID-mediated aberrant somatic hypermutation as the mutational mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrate that genomic lesions in CIITA result in decreased protein expression and reduction of MHC class II surface expression, creating an immune privilege phenotype in PMBCL. In summary, we establish CIITA alterations as a common mechanism of immune escape through reduction of MHC class II expression in PMBCL, with potential implications for future treatments targeting microenvironment-related biology.

Abstract: Summary
TRIM-NHL proteins are conserved among metazoans and control cell fate decisions in various stem cell linages. The Drosophila TRIM-NHL protein Brain tumor (Brat) directs differentiation of neuronal stem cells by suppressing self-renewal factors. Brat is an RNA-binding protein and functions as a translational repressor. However, it is unknown which RNAs Brat regulates and how RNA-binding specificity is achieved. Using RNA immunoprecipitation and RNAcompete, we identify Brat-bound mRNAs in Drosophila embryos and define consensus binding motifs for Brat as well as a number of additional TRIM-NHL proteins, indicating that TRIM-NHL proteins are conserved, sequence-specific RNA-binding proteins. We demonstrate that Brat-mediated repression and direct RNA-binding depend on the identified motif and show that binding of the localization factor Miranda to the Brat-NHL domain inhibits Brat activity. Finally, to unravel the sequence specificity of the NHL domain, we crystallize the Brat-NHL domain in complex with RNA and present a high-resolution protein-RNA structure of this fold.

Abstract: Non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate the translation of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) involved in the growth and development of a variety of cells, including primordial germ cells (PGCs) which play an essential role in germ cell development. However, the target mRNAs and the regulatory networks influenced by miRNAs in PGCs remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate a novel miRNAs control PGC development through targeting mRNAs involved in various cellular pathways. We reveal the PGC-enriched expression patterns of nine miRNAs, including miR-10b, -18a, -93, -106b, -126-3p, -127, -181a, -181b, and -301, using miRNA expression analysis along with mRNA microarray analysis in PGCs, embryonic gonads, and postnatal testes. These miRNAs are highly expressed in PGCs, as demonstrated by Northern blotting, miRNA in situ hybridization assay, and miRNA qPCR analysis. This integrative study utilizing mRNA microarray analysis and miRNA target prediction demonstrates the regulatory networks through which these miRNAs regulate their potential target genes during PGC development. The elucidated networks of miRNAs disclose a coordinated molecular mechanism by which these miRNAs regulate distinct cellular pathways in PGCs that determine germ cell development.

Abstract: Summary
The gut microbiota plays a key role in host metabolism. Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5), a flagellin receptor, is required for gut microbiota homeostasis. Accordingly, TLR5-deficient (T5KO) mice are prone to develop microbiota-dependent metabolic syndrome. Here we observed that T5KO mice display elevated neutral lipids with a compositional increase of oleate [C18:1 (n9)] relative to wild-type littermates. Increased oleate contribution to hepatic lipids and liver SCD1 expression were both microbiota dependent. Analysis of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and 13C-acetate label incorporation revealed elevated SCFA in ceca and hepatic portal blood and increased liver de novo lipogenesis in T5KO mice. Dietary SCFAs further aggravated metabolic syndrome in T5KO mice. Deletion of hepatic SCD1 not only prevented hepatic neutral lipid oleate enrichment but also ameliorated metabolic syndrome in T5KO mice. Collectively, these results underscore the key role of the gut microbiota-liver axis in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases.

Abstract: Summary
While recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEpo) has been widely used to treat anemia in cancer patients, concerns about its adverse effects on patient survival have emerged. A lack of correlation between expression of the canonical EpoR and rhEpo’s effects on cancer cells prompted us to consider the existence of an alternative Epo receptor. Here, we identified EphB4 as an Epo receptor that triggers downstream signaling via STAT3 and promotes rhEpo-induced tumor growth and progression. In human ovarian and breast cancer samples, expression of EphB4 rather than the canonical EpoR correlated with decreased disease-specific survival in rhEpo-treated patients. These results identify EphB4 as a critical mediator of erythropoietin-induced tumor progression and further provide clinically significant dimension to the biology of erythropoietin.

Abstract: Summary
In vertebrate retinal development, the axonal terminals of retinal neurons make synaptic contacts within narrow fixed regions, and these locations are maintained thereafter. However, the mechanisms and biological logic of the organization of these fixed synapse locations are poorly understood. We show here that a membrane scaffold protein, 4.1G, is highly expressed in retinal photoreceptors and is essential for the arrangement of their correct synapse location. The 4.1G-deficient retina exhibits mislocalization of photoreceptor terminals, although their synaptic connections are normally formed. The 4.1G protein binds to the AP3B2 protein, which is involved in neuronal membrane trafficking, and promotes neurite extension in an AP3B2-dependent manner. 4.1G mutant mice showed visual acuity impairments in an optokinetic response, suggesting that correct synapse location is required for normal visual function. Taken together, the data in this study provide insight into the mechanism and importance of proper synapse location in neural circuit formation.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor-educated blood platelets (TEPs) are implicated as central players in the systemic and local responses to tumor growth, thereby altering their RNA profile. We determined the diagnostic potential of TEPs by mRNA sequencing of 283 platelet samples. We distinguished 228 patients with localized and metastasized tumors from 55 healthy individuals with 96% accuracy. Across six different tumor types, the location of the primary tumor was correctly identified with 71% accuracy. Also, MET or HER2-positive, and mutant KRAS, EGFR, or PIK3CA tumors were accurately distinguished using surrogate TEP mRNA profiles. Our results indicate that blood platelets provide a valuable platform for pan-cancer, multiclass cancer, and companion diagnostics, possibly enabling clinical advances in blood-based “liquid biopsies”.

Abstract: Summary
Migrating fibroblasts undergo contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL), a process that was discovered five decades ago and still is not fully understood at the molecular level. We identify the Slit2-Robo4-srGAP2 signaling network as a key regulator of CIL in fibroblasts. CIL involves highly dynamic contact protrusions with a specialized actin cytoskeleton that stochastically explore cell-cell overlaps between colliding fibroblasts. A membrane curvature-sensing F-BAR domain pre-localizes srGAP2 to protruding edges and terminates their extension phase in response to cell collision. A FRET-based biosensor reveals that Rac1 activity is focused in a band at the tip of contact protrusions, in contrast to the broad activation gradient in contact-free protrusions. SrGAP2 specifically controls the duration of Rac1 activity in contact protrusions, but not in contact-free protrusions. We propose that srGAP2 integrates cell edge curvature and Slit-Robo-mediated repulsive cues to fine-tune Rac1 activation dynamics in contact protrusions to spatiotemporally coordinate CIL.

Abstract: Summary
Blood vessel stability is essential for embryonic development; in the adult, many diseases are associated with loss of vascular integrity. The ETS transcription factor ERG drives expression of VE-cadherin and controls junctional integrity. We show that constitutive endothelial deletion of ERG (ErgcEC-KO) in mice causes embryonic lethality with vascular defects. Inducible endothelial deletion of ERG (ErgiEC-KO) results in defective physiological and pathological angiogenesis in the postnatal retina and tumors, with decreased vascular stability. ERG controls the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by promoting β-catenin stability, through signals mediated by VE-cadherin and the Wnt receptor Frizzled-4. Wnt signaling is decreased in ERG-deficient endothelial cells; activation of Wnt signaling with lithium chloride, which stabilizes β-catenin levels, corrects vascular defects in ErgcEC-KO embryos. Finally, overexpression of ERG in vivo reduces permeability and increases stability of VEGF-induced blood vessels. These data demonstrate that ERG is an essential regulator of angiogenesis and vascular stability through Wnt signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Period (PER) protein phosphorylation is a critical regulator of circadian period, yet an integrated understanding of the role and interaction between phosphorylation sites that can both increase and decrease PER2 stability remains elusive. Here, we propose a phosphoswitch model, where two competing phosphorylation sites determine whether PER2 has a fast or slow degradation rate. This mathematical model accurately reproduces the three-stage degradation kinetics of endogenous PER2. We predict and demonstrate that the phosphoswitch is intrinsically temperature sensitive, slowing down PER2 degradation as a result of faster reactions at higher temperatures. The phosphoswitch provides a biochemical mechanism for circadian temperature compensation of circadian period. This phosphoswitch additionally explains the phenotype of Familial Advanced Sleep Phase (FASP) and CK1εtau genetic circadian rhythm disorders, metabolic control of PER2 stability, and how drugs that inhibit CK1 alter period. The phosphoswitch provides a general mechanism to integrate diverse stimuli to regulate circadian period.

Abstract: Summary
Splicing factor SRSF1 is upregulated in human breast tumors, and its overexpression promotes transformation of mammary cells. Using RNA-seq, we identified SRSF1-regulated alternative splicing (AS) targets in organotypic three-dimensional MCF-10A cell cultures that mimic a context relevant to breast cancer. We identified and validated hundreds of endogenous SRSF1-regulated AS events. De novo discovery of the SRSF1 binding motif reconciled discrepancies in previous motif analyses. Using a Bayesian model, we determined positional effects of SRSF1 binding on cassette exons: binding close to the 5′ splice site generally promoted exon inclusion, whereas binding near the 3′ splice site promoted either exon skipping or inclusion. Finally, we identified SRSF1-regulated AS events deregulated in human tumors; overexpressing one such isoform, exon-9-included CASC4, increased acinar size and proliferation, and decreased apoptosis, partially recapitulating SRSF1’s oncogenic effects. Thus, we uncovered SRSF1 positive and negative regulatory mechanisms, and oncogenic AS events that represent potential targets for therapeutics development.

Abstract: Summary
Strategies to target angiogenesis include inhibition of the vessel-stabilizing properties of vascular pericytes. Pericyte depletion in early-stage non-hypoxic tumors suppressed nascent angiogenesis, tumor growth, and lung metastasis. In contrast, pericyte depletion in advanced-stage hypoxic tumors with pre-established vasculature resulted in enhanced intra-tumoral hypoxia, decreased tumor growth, and increased lung metastasis. Furthermore, depletion of pericytes in post-natal retinal blood vessels resulted in abnormal and leaky vasculature. Tumor transcriptome profiling and biological validation revealed that angiopoietin signaling is a key regulatory pathway associated with pericyte targeting. Indeed, pericyte targeting in established mouse tumors increased angiopoietin-2 (ANG2/Angpt2) expression. Depletion of pericytes, coupled with targeting of ANG2 signaling, restored vascular stability in multiple model systems and decreased tumor growth and metastasis. Importantly, ANGPT2 expression correlated with poor outcome in patients with breast cancer. These results emphasize the potential utility of therapeutic regimens that target pericytes and ANG2 signaling in metastatic breast cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The integrity of chromatin, which provides a dynamic template for all DNA-related processes in eukaryotes, is maintained through replication-dependent and -independent assembly pathways. To address the role of histone deposition in the absence of DNA replication, we deleted the H3.3 chaperone Hira in developing mouse oocytes. We show that chromatin of non-replicative developing oocytes is dynamic and that lack of continuous H3.3/H4 deposition alters chromatin structure, resulting in increased DNase I sensitivity, the accumulation of DNA damage, and a severe fertility phenotype. On the molecular level, abnormal chromatin structure leads to a dramatic decrease in the dynamic range of gene expression, the appearance of spurious transcripts, and inefficient de novo DNA methylation. Our study thus unequivocally shows the importance of continuous histone replacement and chromatin homeostasis for transcriptional regulation and normal developmental progression in a non-replicative system in vivo.

Abstract: In the interaction between plants and pathogens, carbon (C) resources provide energy and C skeletons to maintain, among many functions, the plant immune system. However, variations in C availability on pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) triggered immunity (PTI) have not been systematically examined. Here, three types of starch mutants with enhanced susceptibility to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 hrcC were examined for PTI. In a dark period-dependent manner, the mutants showed compromised induction of a PTI marker, and callose accumulation in response to the bacterial PAMP flagellin, flg22. In combination with weakened PTI responses in wild type by inhibition of the TCA cycle, the experiments determined the necessity of C-derived energy in establishing PTI. Global gene expression analyses identified flg22 responsive genes displaying C supply-dependent patterns. Nutrient recycling-related genes were regulated similarly by C-limitation and flg22, indicating re-arrangements of expression programs to redirect resources that establish or strengthen PTI. Ethylene and NAC transcription factors appear to play roles in these processes. Under C-limitation, PTI appears compromised based on suppression of genes required for continued biosynthetic capacity and defenses through flg22. Our results provide a foundation for the intuitive perception of the interplay between plant nutrition status and pathogen defense.

Abstract: Summary
The ChREBP/Mondo-Mlx transcription factors are activated by sugars and are essential for sugar tolerance. They promote the conversion of sugars to lipids, but beyond this, their physiological roles are insufficiently understood. Here, we demonstrate that in an organism-wide setting in Drosophila, Mondo-Mlx controls the majority of sugar-regulated genes involved in nutrient digestion and transport as well as carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolism. Furthermore, human orthologs of the Mondo-Mlx targets display enrichment among gene variants associated with high circulating triglycerides. In addition to direct regulation of metabolic genes, Mondo-Mlx maintains metabolic homeostasis through downstream effectors, including the Activin ligand Dawdle and the Gli-similar transcription factor Sugarbabe. Sugarbabe controls a subset of Mondo-Mlx-dependent processes, including de novo lipogenesis and fatty acid desaturation. In sum, Mondo-Mlx is a master regulator of other sugar-responsive pathways essential for adaptation to a high-sugar diet.

Inhibition of antigen receptor-dependent Ca2+ signals and NF-AT activation by P2X7 receptors in human B lymphocytes,

Abstract: One of the first intracellular signals after antigen binding by the antigen receptor of B lymphocytes is the increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), which is followed by several intracellular signaling events like the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NF-AT controlling the fate of B lymphocytes after their activation. Extracellular ATP, which is released from cells under several pathological conditions, is considered a danger-associated signal serving as an immunomodulator. We investigated the interaction of antigen receptor (BCR) and P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) activation on [Ca2+]i signaling and on nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NF-AT in human B lymphocytes. Although the P2X7R is an ATP-gated Ca2+-permeable ion channel, P2X7R activation inhibits the BCR-mediated [Ca2+]i responses. This effect is mimicked by cell membrane depolarization induced by an increase in the extracellular K+ concentration or by application of the Na+ ionophore gramicidin, but is abolished by stabilization of the membrane potential using the K+ ionophore valinomycin, by extracellular Mg2+, which is known to inhibit P2X7R-dependent effects, or by replacing Na+ by the less P2X7R-permeable Tris+ ion. Furthermore, P2X7R activation by ATP inhibits the BCR-dependent translocation of the transcription factor NF-ATc1 to the nucleus. We therefore conclude that extracellular ATP via the P2X7R mediates inhibitory effects on B cell activation. This may be of relevance for understanding of the activation of the BCR under pathological conditions and for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting human B lymphocytes or P2X7 receptors.

Abstract: Summary
Elucidating the determinants of aggressiveness in lethal prostate cancer may stimulate therapeutic strategies that improve clinical outcomes. We used experimental models and clinical databases to identify GATA2 as a regulator of chemotherapy resistance and tumorigenicity in this context. Mechanistically, direct upregulation of the growth hormone IGF2 emerged as a mediator of the aggressive properties regulated by GATA2. IGF2 in turn activated IGF1R and INSR as well as a downstream polykinase program. The characterization of this axis prompted a combination strategy whereby dual IGF1R/INSR inhibition restored the efficacy of chemotherapy and improved survival in preclinical models. These studies reveal a GATA2-IGF2 aggressiveness axis in lethal prostate cancer and identify a therapeutic opportunity in this challenging disease.

Abstract: Summary
A central question in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) research is the identity of the tumor-initiating cell, and its contribution to the malignant phenotype and genomic state. We examine the potential of adult lineage-restricted progenitors to induce fully penetrant GBM using CNS progenitor-specific inducible Cre mice to mutate Nf1, Trp53, and Pten. We identify two phenotypically and molecularly distinct GBM subtypes governed by identical driver mutations. We demonstrate that the two subtypes arise from functionally independent pools of adult CNS progenitors. Despite histologic identity as GBM, these tumor types are separable based on the lineage of the tumor-initiating cell. These studies point to the cell of origin as a major determinant of GBM subtype diversity.

Abstract: Summary
Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is a widespread post-transcriptional mechanism, but its genomic landscape and clinical relevance in cancer have not been investigated systematically. We characterized the global A-to-I RNA editing profiles of 6,236 patient samples of 17 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas and revealed a striking diversity of altered RNA-editing patterns in tumors relative to normal tissues. We identified an appreciable number of clinically relevant editing events, many of which are in noncoding regions. We experimentally demonstrated the effects of several cross-tumor nonsynonymous RNA editing events on cell viability and provide the evidence that RNA editing could selectively affect drug sensitivity. These results highlight RNA editing as an exciting theme for investigating cancer mechanisms, biomarkers, and treatments.

Abstract: Summary
The MLE helicase remodels the roX lncRNAs, enabling the lncRNA-mediated assembly of the Drosophila dosage compensation complex. We identified a stable MLE core comprising the DExH helicase module and two auxiliary domains: a dsRBD and an OB-like fold. MLEcore is an unusual DExH helicase that can unwind blunt-ended RNA duplexes and has specificity for uridine nucleotides. We determined the 2.1 Å resolution structure of MLEcore bound to a U10 RNA and ADP-AlF4. The OB-like and dsRBD folds bind the DExH module and contribute to form the entrance of the helicase channel. Four uridine nucleotides engage in base-specific interactions, rationalizing the conservation of uridine-rich sequences in critical roX substrates. roX2 binding is orchestrated by MLE’s auxiliary domains, which is prerequisite for MLE localization to the male X chromosome. The structure visualizes a transition-state mimic of the reaction and suggests how eukaryotic DEAH/RHA helicases couple ATP hydrolysis to RNA translocation.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy is essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis. Although adaptors have been demonstrated to facilitate the assembly of the Atg14L-Beclin 1-Vps34-Vps15 complex, which functions in autophagosome formation, it remains unknown whether the autophagy machinery actively recruits such adaptors. WD40-repeat proteins are a large, highly conserved family of adaptors implicated in various cellular activities. However, the role of WD40-repeat-only proteins, such as RACK1, in postnatal mammalian physiology remains unknown. Here, we report that hepatocyte-specific RACK1 deficiency leads to lipid accumulation in the liver, accompanied by impaired Atg14L-linked Vps34 activity and autophagy. Further exploration indicates that RACK1 participates in the formation of autophagosome biogenesis complex upon its phosphorylation by AMPK at Thr50. Thr50 phosphorylation of RACK1 enhances its direct binding to Vps15, Atg14L, and Beclin 1, thereby promoting the assembly of the autophagy-initiation complex. These observations provide insight into autophagy induction and establish a pivotal role for RACK1 in postnatal mammalian physiology.

Abstract: The Caenorhabditis elegans peroxidasins, PXN-1 and PXN-2, are extracellular peroxidases; pxn-2 is involved in muscle-epidermal attachment during embryonic morphogenesis and in specific axon guidance. Here we investigate potential roles of the other homologue of peroxidasin, pxn-1, in C. elegans. A pxn-1 deletion mutant showed high lethality under heat-stress conditions. Using a transcriptional GFP reporter, pxn-1 expression was observed in various tissues including neurons, muscles, and hypodermis. A translational fusion showed that PXN-1::GFP was secreted and localized in extracellular matrix, particularly along body wall muscles and pharyngeal muscles. Various neuronal developmental defects were observed in pxn-1 mutants and in pxn-1 over-expressing animals, including handedness, branching, breakage, tangling, and defasciculation. These results suggest that pxn-1, like other peroxidasins, plays an important role throughout development.

Abstract: Summary
A decline in mitochondrial respiration represents the root cause of a large number of inborn errors of metabolism. It is also associated with common age-associated diseases and the aging process. To gain insight into the systemic, biochemical consequences of respiratory chain dysfunction, we performed a case-control, prospective metabolic profiling study in a genetically homogenous cohort of patients with Leigh syndrome French Canadian variant, a mitochondrial respiratory chain disease due to loss-of-function mutations in LRPPRC. We discovered 45 plasma and urinary analytes discriminating patients from controls, including classic markers of mitochondrial metabolic dysfunction (lactate and acylcarnitines), as well as unexpected markers of cardiometabolic risk (insulin and adiponectin), amino acid catabolism linked to NADH status (α-hydroxybutyrate), and NAD+ biosynthesis (kynurenine and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid). Our study identifies systemic, metabolic pathway derangements that can lie downstream of primary mitochondrial lesions, with implications for understanding how the organelle contributes to rare and common diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The displacement loop (D loop) is a DNA strand invasion product formed during homologous recombination. Disruption of nascent D loops prevents recombination, and during synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA), disruption of D loops extended by DNA polymerase ensures a non-crossover outcome. The proteins implicated in D loop disruption are DNA motor proteins/helicases that act by moving DNA junctions. Here we report that D loops can also be disrupted by DNA topoisomerase 3 (Top3), and this disruption depends on Top3’s catalytic activity. Yeast Top3 specifically disrupts D loops mediated by yeast Rad51/Rad54; protein-free D loops or D loop mediated by bacterial RecA protein or human RAD51/RAD54 resist dissolution. Also, the human Topoisomerase IIIa-RMI1-RMI2 complex is capable of dissolving D loops. Consistent with genetic data, we suggest that the extreme growth defect and hyper-recombination phenotype of Top3-deficient yeast cells is partially a result of unprocessed D loops.

Abstract: Summary
O2 sensing is essential for mammalian homeostasis. Peripheral chemoreceptors such as the carotid body (CB) contain cells with O2-sensitive K+ channels, which are inhibited by hypoxia to trigger fast adaptive cardiorespiratory reflexes. How variations of O2 tension (PO2) are detected and the mechanisms whereby these changes are conveyed to membrane ion channels have remained elusive. We have studied acute O2 sensing in conditional knockout mice lacking mitochondrial complex I (MCI) genes. We inactivated Ndufs2, which encodes a protein that participates in ubiquinone binding. Ndufs2-null mice lose the hyperventilatory response to hypoxia, although they respond to hypercapnia. Ndufs2-deficient CB cells have normal functions and ATP content but are insensitive to changes in PO2. Our data suggest that chemoreceptor cells have a specialized succinate-dependent metabolism that induces an MCI state during hypoxia, characterized by the production of reactive oxygen species and accumulation of reduced pyridine nucleotides, which signal neighboring K+ channels.

Abstract: BCS1L gene encodes mitochondrial protein and is a member of conserved AAA protein family. This gene is involved in the incorporation of Rieske FeS and Qcr10p into complex III of respiratory chain. In our previous study, AluYRa2-derived alternative transcript in rhesus monkey genome was identified. However, this transcript has not been reported in human genome. In present study, we conducted evolutionary analysis of AluYRa2-exonized transcript with various primate genomic DNAs and cDNAs from humans, rhesus monkeys, and crab-eating monkeys. Remarkably, our results show that AluYRa2 element has only been integrated into genomes of Macaca species. This Macaca lineage-specific integration of AluYRa2 element led to exonization event in the first intron region of BCS1L gene by producing a conserved 3′ splice site. Intriguingly, in rhesus and crab-eating monkeys, more diverse transcript variants by alternative splicing (AS) events, including exon skipping and different 5′ splice sites from humans, were identified. Alignment of amino acid sequences revealed that AluYRa2-exonized transcript has short N-terminal peptides. Therefore, AS events play a major role in the generation of various transcripts and proteins during primate evolution. In particular, lineage-specific integration of Alu elements and species-specific Alu-derived exonization events could be important sources of gene diversification in primates.

Abstract: Summary
Modulation of neural responses is frequently observed in the superior colliculus (SC), a retinorecipient midbrain structure that controls orienting and the localization of attention. Although behavioral contingencies that influence SC responses are well documented, the neural pathways and molecular mechanisms responsible for this modulation are not completely understood. Here, we illustrate a dopaminergic system that strongly impacts neural responses in the SC. After using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to detail the transcriptome of dopamine-related genes in the SC, we show that D1 receptors are enriched in the superficial visual SC, while D2 receptors segregate to the intermediate multimodal/motor SC. Retrograde injections into the SC consistently label A13, a small dopamine cell group located in the zona incerta. We surmise that A13 mimics dopaminergic effects that we observed in SC slices, which suggests that dopamine in the SC may reduce the tendency of an animal to orient or attend to salient stimuli.

Abstract: Summary
A functional genomics study revealed that the activity of acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2) contributes to cancer cell growth under low-oxygen and lipid-depleted conditions. Comparative metabolomics and lipidomics demonstrated that acetate is used as a nutritional source by cancer cells in an ACSS2-dependent manner, and supplied a significant fraction of the carbon within the fatty acid and phospholipid pools. ACSS2 expression is upregulated under metabolically stressed conditions and ACSS2 silencing reduced the growth of tumor xenografts. ACSS2 exhibits copy-number gain in human breast tumors, and ACSS2 expression correlates with disease progression. These results signify a critical role for acetate consumption in the production of lipid biomass within the harsh tumor microenvironment.

Abstract: Summary
Cold stress is a major environmental factor that limits plant growth and development. The C-repeat-binding factor (CBF)-dependent cold signaling pathway is extensively studied in Arabidopsis; however, the specific protein kinases involved in this pathway remain elusive. Here we report that OST1 (OPEN STOMATA 1), a well-known Ser/Thr protein kinase in ABA signaling, acts upstream of CBFs to positively regulate freezing tolerance. The ost1 mutants show freezing hypersensitivity, whereas transgenic plants overexpressing OST1 exhibit enhanced freezing tolerance. The OST1 kinase is activated by cold stress. Moreover, OST1 interacts with both the transcription factor ICE1 and the E3 ligase HOS1 in the CBF pathway. Cold-activated OST1 phosphorylates ICE1 and enhances its stability and transcriptional activity. Meanwhile, OST1 interferes with the interaction between HOS1 and ICE1, thus suppressing HOS1-mediated ICE1 degradation under cold stress. Our results thus uncover the unexpected roles of OST1 in modulating CBF-dependent cold signaling in Arabidopsis.

Abstract: EphA7 is a key molecule in regulating the development of the dien- and mesencephalon. To get insight into the mechanism of how EphA7 gene expression is regulated during the dorsal specification of the dien- and mesencephalon, we investigated the cis-acting regulatory sequence driving EphA7 to the dorsal midline of the dien- and mesencephalon. Transgenic LacZ reporter analysis, using overlapping EphA7 BACs, was used to narrow down the dorsal midline-specific enhancer, revealing the 25.3 kb genomic region as the enhancer candidate. Strikingly, this genomic DNA was located far downstream of the EphA7 transcription start site, +302.6 kb to +327.9 kb. Further enhancer mapping, using comparative genomic analysis and transgenic methods, showed that the 187 bp genomic DNA alone, approximately 305 kb downstream of the EphA7 transcription start site, was sufficient to act as the dorsal midline-specific enhancer of EphA7. Importantly, our results indicate that the 187 bp dorsal midline-specific enhancer is critically regulated by homeobox transcription factors during the development of the dien- and mesencephalon.

Abstract: Summary
Centrioles are essential for cilia and centrosome assembly. In centriole-containing cells, centrioles always form juxtaposed to pre-existing ones, motivating a century-old debate on centriole biogenesis control. Here, we show that trans-autoactivation of Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4), the trigger of centriole biogenesis, is a critical event in the spatial control of that process. We demonstrate that centrioles promote PLK4 activation through its recruitment and local accumulation. Though centriole removal reduces the proportion of active PLK4, this is rescued by concentrating PLK4 to the peroxisome lumen. Moreover, while mild overexpression of PLK4 only triggers centriole amplification at the existing centriole, higher PLK4 levels trigger both centriolar and cytoplasmatic (de novo) biogenesis. Hence, centrioles promote their assembly locally and disfavor de novo synthesis. Similar mechanisms enforcing the local concentration and/or activity of other centriole components are likely to contribute to the spatial control of centriole biogenesis under physiological conditions.

Abstract: Summary
A more complete understanding of aberrant oncogenic signaling in neuroblastoma, a malignancy of the developing sympathetic nervous system, is paramount to improving patient outcomes. Recently, we identified LIN28B as an oncogenic driver in high-risk neuroblastoma. Here, we identify the oncogene RAN as a LIN28B target and show regional gain of chromosome 12q24 as an additional somatic alteration resulting in increased RAN expression. We show that LIN28B influences RAN expression by promoting RAN Binding Protein 2 expression and by directly binding RAN mRNA. Further, we demonstrate a convergence of LIN28B and RAN signaling on Aurora kinase A activity. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that LIN28B-RAN-AURKA signaling drives neuroblastoma oncogenesis, suggesting that this pathway may be amenable to therapeutic targeting.

Abstract: Summary
The Par polarity complex creates mutually exclusive cortical domains in diverse animal cells. Activity of the atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) is a key output of the Par complex as phosphorylation removes substrates from the Par domain. Here, we investigate how diverse, apparently unrelated Par substrates couple phosphorylation to cortical displacement. Each protein contains a basic and hydrophobic (BH) motif that interacts directly with phospholipids and also overlaps with aPKC phosphorylation sites. Phosphorylation alters the electrostatic character of the sequence, inhibiting interaction with phospholipids and the cell cortex. We searched for overlapping BH and aPKC phosphorylation site motifs (i.e., putative phosphoregulated BH motifs) in several animal proteomes. Candidate proteins with strong PRBH signals associated with the cell cortex but were displaced into the cytoplasm by aPKC. These findings demonstrate a potentially general mechanism for exclusion of proteins from the Par cortical domain in polarized cells.

Abstract: Summary
Tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) reside in barrier tissues and provide local immediate protective immunity. Here, we show that the salivary gland (SG) most-effectively induces CD8+ and CD4+ TRM cells against murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), which persists in and spreads from this organ. TRM generation depended on local antigen for CD4+, but not CD8+, TRM cells, highlighting major differences in T cell subset-specific demands for TRM development. CMV-specific CD8+ T cells fail to control virus replication upon primary infection in the SG due to CMV-induced MHC I downregulation in glandular epithelial cells. Using intraglandular infection, we challenge this notion and demonstrate that memory CD8+ T cells confer immediate protection against locally introduced MCMV despite active viral immune evasion, owing to early viral tropism to cells that largely withstand MHC I downregulation. Thus, we unravel a yet-unappreciated role for memory CD8+ T cells in protecting mucosal tissues against CMV infection.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in Wnt-signaling coreceptor LRP6 have been linked to coronary artery disease (CAD) by unknown mechanisms. Here, we show that reduced LRP6 activity in LRP6R611C mice promotes loss of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) differentiation, leading to aortic medial hyperplasia. Carotid injury augmented these effects and led to partial to total vascular obstruction. LRP6R611C mice on high-fat diet displayed dramatic obstructive CAD and exhibited an accelerated atherosclerotic burden on LDLR knockout background. Mechanistically, impaired LRP6 activity leads to enhanced non-canonical Wnt signaling, culminating in diminished TCF7L2 and increased Sp1-dependent activation of PDGF signaling. Wnt3a administration to LRP6R611C mice improved LRP6 activity, led to TCF7L2-dependent VSMC differentiation, and rescued post-carotid-injury neointima formation. These findings demonstrate the critical role of intact Wnt signaling in the vessel wall, establish a causal link between impaired LRP6/TCF7L2 activities and arterial disease, and identify Wnt signaling as a therapeutic target against CAD.

Abstract: Summary
The basal ganglia play a critical role in shaping motor behavior. For this function, the activity of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the striatonigral and striatopallidal pathways must be integrated. It remains unclear whether the activity of the two pathways is primarily coordinated by synaptic plasticity mechanisms. Using a model of Parkinson’s disease, we determined the circuit and behavioral effects of concurrently regulating cell-type-specific forms of corticostriatal long-term synaptic depression (LTD) by inhibiting small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (SKs) of the dorsolateral striatum. At striatopallidal synapses, SK channel inhibition rescued the disease-linked deficits in endocannabinoid (eCB)-dependent LTD. At striatonigral cells, inhibition of these channels counteracted a form of adenosine-mediated LTD by activating the ERK cascade. Interfering with eCB-, adenosine-, and ERK signaling in vivo alleviated motor abnormalities, which supports that synaptic modulation of striatal pathways affects behavior. Thus, our results establish a central role of coordinated synaptic plasticity at MSN subpopulations in motor control.

Abstract: Recently it has been reported that reactive oxygen species plays an important role in several physiological processes. Reactive oxygen species are generated by reactive oxygen-synthesizing enzymes (Nox). We immunohistochemically investigated expression and localization of the Nox family in a mouse circumvallate papillae. In the epithelium of the circumvallate papilla, Nox 1, 2, 3, and 4, Noxo1, and Noxa1 were expressed. In the circumvallate papilla, Nox2 was more weakly expressed in the lateral than in the upper part, and Nox3 was not expressed. In the taste buds, Nox 1, 2, 3, and 4, Noxo1, and Noxa1 were expressed; the Nox expression pattern varied with the cell type. In type II cells, Nox 1, 3, and 4, Noxo1, and Noxa1 were expressed. In type III cells, Nox2, besides Nox 1, 3, and 4, Noxo1, and Noxa1, were specifically expressed, unlike in other taste bud cells. In the mouse circumvallate papilla, Nox is always expressed, suggesting the generation of reactive oxygen species. Of note, all cells comprising taste buds expressed Nox, with each showing a specific Nox expression pattern.

Abstract: Summary
Mouse whiskers are somatotopically mapped in brainstem trigeminal nuclei as neuronal modules known as barrelettes. Whisker-related afferents form barrelettes in ventral principal sensory (vPrV) nucleus, whereas mandibular input targets dorsal PrV (dPrV). How barrelette neuron identity and circuitry is established is poorly understood. We found that ectopic Hoxa2 expression in dPrV neurons is sufficient to attract whisker-related afferents, induce asymmetrical dendrite arbors, and allow ectopic barrelette map formation. Moreover, the thalamic area forming whisker-related barreloids is prenatally targeted by both vPrV and dPrV axons followed by perinatal large-scale pruning of dPrV axons and refinement of vPrV barrelette input. Ectopic Hoxa2 expression allows topographically directed targeting and refinement of dPrV axons with vPrV axons into a single whisker-related barreloid map. Thus, a single HOX transcription factor is sufficient to switch dPrV into a vPrV barrelette neuron program and coordinate input-output topographic connectivity of a dermatome-specific circuit module.

Abstract: Most imprinted genes are concerned with embryonic development, especially placental development. Here, we identified a placenta-specific imprinted gene Qpct. Our results show that Qpct is widely expressed during early embryonic development and can be detected in the telecephalon, midbrain, and rhombencephalon at E9.5–E11.5. Moreover, Qpct is strikingly expressed in the brain, lung and liver in E15.5. Expression signals for Qpct achieved a peak at E15.5 during placental development and were only detected in the labyrinth layer in E15.5 placenta. ChIP assay results suggest that the modification of histone H3K4me3 can result in maternal activating of Qpct.

Abstract: The quintessential property of developing cardiomyocytes is their ability to beat spontaneously. The mechanisms underlying spontaneous beating in developing cardiomyocytes are thought to resemble those of adult heart, but have not been directly tested. Contributions of sarcoplasmic and mitochondrial Ca2+-signaling vs. If-channel in initiating spontaneous beating were tested in human induced Pluripotent Stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CM) and rat Neonatal cardiomyocytes (rN-CM). Whole-cell and perforated-patch voltage-clamping and 2-D confocal imaging showed: (1) both cell types beat spontaneously (60–140/min, at 24°C); (2) holding potentials between −70 and 0mV had no significant effects on spontaneous pacing, but suppressed action potential formation; (3) spontaneous pacing at −50mV activated cytosolic Ca2+-transients, accompanied by in-phase inward current oscillations that were suppressed by Na+-Ca2+-exchanger (NCX)- and ryanodine receptor (RyR2)-blockers, but not by Ca2+- and If-channels blockers; (4) spreading fluorescence images of cytosolic Ca2+-transients emanated repeatedly from preferred central cellular locations during spontaneous beating; (5) mitochondrial un-coupler, FCCP at non-depolarizing concentrations (∼50nM), reversibly suppressed spontaneous pacing; (6) genetically encoded mitochondrial Ca2+-biosensor (mitycam-E31Q) detected regionally diverse, and FCCP-sensitive mitochondrial Ca2+-uptake and release signals activating during INCX oscillations; (7) If-channel was absent in rN-CM, but activated only negative to −80mV in hiPS-CM; nevertheless blockers of If-channel failed to alter spontaneous pacing.

Abstract: Summary
Polycomb Group (PcG) proteins maintain transcriptional repression throughout development, mostly by regulating chromatin structure. Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), a component of the Polycomb machinery, is responsible for the methylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me2/3). Jarid2 was previously identified as a cofactor of PRC2, regulating PRC2 targeting to chromatin and its enzymatic activity. Deletion of Jarid2 leads to impaired orchestration of gene expression during cell lineage commitment. Here, we reveal an unexpected crosstalk between Jarid2 and PRC2, with Jarid2 being methylated by PRC2. This modification is recognized by the Eed core component of PRC2 and triggers an allosteric activation of PRC2’s enzymatic activity. We show that Jarid2 methylation is important to promote PRC2 activity at a locus devoid of H3K27me3 and for the correct deposition of this mark during cell differentiation. Our results uncover a regulation loop where Jarid2 methylation fine-tunes PRC2 activity depending on the chromatin context.

A 3′ Poly(A) Tract Is Required for LINE-1 Retrotransposition,

Abstract: Summary
L1 retrotransposons express proteins (ORF1p and ORF2p) that preferentially mobilize their encoding RNA in cis, but they also can mobilize Alu RNA and, more rarely, cellular mRNAs in trans. Although these RNAs differ in sequence, each ends in a 3′ polyadenosine (poly(A)) tract. Here, we replace the L1 polyadenylation signal with sequences derived from a non-polyadenylated long non-coding RNA (MALAT1), which can form a stabilizing triple helix at the 3′ end of an RNA. L1/MALAT RNAs accumulate in cells, lack poly(A) tails, and are translated; however, they cannot retrotranspose in cis. Remarkably, the addition of a 16 or 40 base poly(A) tract downstream of the L1/MALAT triple helix restores retrotransposition in cis. The presence of a poly(A) tract also allows ORF2p to bind and mobilize RNAs in trans. Thus, a 3′ poly(A) tract is critical for the retrotransposition of sequences that comprise approximately one billion base pairs of human DNA.

Abstract: Summary
Plasmodium falciparum engineer infected erythrocytes to present the malarial protein, VAR2CSA, which binds a distinct type chondroitin sulfate (CS) exclusively expressed in the placenta. Here, we show that the same CS modification is present on a high proportion of malignant cells and that it can be specifically targeted by recombinant VAR2CSA (rVAR2). In tumors, placental-like CS chains are linked to a limited repertoire of cancer-associated proteoglycans including CD44 and CSPG4. The rVAR2 protein localizes to tumors in vivo and rVAR2 fused to diphtheria toxin or conjugated to hemiasterlin compounds strongly inhibits in vivo tumor cell growth and metastasis. Our data demonstrate how an evolutionarily refined parasite-derived protein can be exploited to target a common, but complex, malignancy-associated glycosaminoglycan modification.

Abstract: Summary
Tumors are typically sequenced to depths of 75x–100x (exome) or 30x–50x (whole genome). We demonstrate that current sequencing paradigms are inadequate for tumors that are impure, aneuploid, or clonally heterogeneous. To reassess optimal sequencing strategies, we performed ultra-deep (up to ∼312x) whole genome sequencing and exome capture (up to ∼433x) of a primary acute myeloid leukemia, its subsequent relapse, and a matched normal skin sample. We tested multiple alignment and variant calling algorithms and validated ∼200,000 putative SNVs by sequencing them to depths of ∼1,000x. Additional targeted sequencing provided over 10,000x coverage and ddPCR assays provided up to ∼250,000x sampling of selected sites. We evaluated the effects of different library generation approaches, depth of sequencing, and analysis strategies on the ability to effectively characterize a complex tumor. This dataset, representing the most comprehensively sequenced tumor described to date, will serve as an invaluable community resource (dbGaP: phs000159).

Abstract: Summary
If specific and functional kinase- or phosphatase-substrate interactions are optimized for binding compared to promiscuous interactions, then changes in phosphorylation should occur faster on functional versus promiscuous substrates. To test this hypothesis, we designed a high temporal resolution global phosphoproteomics protocol to study the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) response in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The method provides accurate, stimulus-specific measurement of phosphoproteome changes, quantitative analysis of phosphodynamics at sub-minute temporal resolution, and detection of more phosphosites. Rates of evolution of dynamic phosphosites were comparable to those of known functional phosphosites and significantly lower than static or longer-time-frame dynamic phosphosites. Kinetic profile analyses indicated that putatively functional kinase- or phosphatase-substrate interactions occur more rapidly, within 60 s, than promiscuous interactions. Finally, we report many changes in phosphorylation of proteins implicated in cytoskeletal and mitotic spindle dynamics that may underlie regulation of cell cycle and morphogenesis.

Abstract: The present study investigated the testis and sperm morphology of the tropical fish Gymnotus carapo after exposure to increasing CdCl2 concentrations (5–40μM) for 24 and 96h. The treatments induced Cd accumulation in the testis and a decrease in the gonadosomatic index from a 10μM. Cd induced alterations in testis since 24h; however the extension and severity of damages increased after 96h in all tested concentrations. Marked variations in the cysts size, proliferation of the interstitial tissue, infiltration of inflammatory cells, necrosis, reduction of germ cells and sperm aggregation was observed in 96h treated fishes. In this time, there was a complete absence of germ cells in the testis of fish treated with 40μM. The ultrastructural analysis allowed for the visualization of the initial damages over germ cells, such as the presence of vacuoles in the cytoplasm of spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and spermatids. Exposed fish (20μM for 24 and 96h) had alterations in sperm number and morphology. These results are important for establishing a direct correlation between the Cd accumulation and incidence of damages and can help characterize the mechanism of Cd-induced pathogenesis in the male reproductive system.

Abstract: Summary
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene amplification and mutations are the most common oncogenic events in glioblastoma (GBM), but the mechanisms by which they promote aggressive tumor growth are not well understood. Here, through integrated epigenome and transcriptome analyses of cell lines, genotyped clinical samples, and TCGA data, we show that EGFR mutations remodel the activated enhancer landscape of GBM, promoting tumorigenesis through a SOX9 and FOXG1-dependent transcriptional regulatory network in vitro and in vivo. The most common EGFR mutation, EGFRvIII, sensitizes GBM cells to the BET-bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 in a SOX9, FOXG1-dependent manner. These results identify the role of transcriptional/epigenetic remodeling in EGFR-dependent pathogenesis and suggest a mechanistic basis for epigenetic therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding how chromatin modification regulates development and disease can be limited by available material. Despite recent progress, balancing high-quality and reliable mapping using chromatin-immunoprecipitation-based deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) remains a challenge. We report two techniques, recovery via protection (RP)-ChIP-seq and favored amplification RP-ChIP-seq (FARP-ChIP-seq), that provide reproducible mapping in as few as 500 cells. RP-ChIP-seq allows detection of age-associated epigenetic changes in a single mouse lens, whereas FARP-ChIP-seq accurately maps histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and H3K27me3 in long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs), short-term HSCs (ST-HSCs), and multi-potent progenitors (MPPs) from one mouse. These datasets not only highlight genes that may be involved in lens aging but also indicate a lack of H3K4me3/H3K27me3 bivalency on hematopoietic genes in HSCs.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanisms contributing to transcription-associated genomic instability are both complex and incompletely understood. Although R-loops are normal transcriptional intermediates, they are also associated with genomic instability. Here, we show that BRCA1 is recruited to R-loops that form normally over a subset of transcription termination regions. There it mediates the recruitment of a specific, physiological binding partner, senataxin (SETX). Disruption of this complex led to R-loop-driven DNA damage at those loci as reflected by adjacent γ-H2AX accumulation and ssDNA breaks within the untranscribed strand of relevant R-loop structures. Genome-wide analysis revealed widespread BRCA1 binding enrichment at R-loop-rich termination regions (TRs) of actively transcribed genes. Strikingly, within some of these genes in BRCA1 null breast tumors, there are specific insertion/deletion mutations located close to R-loop-mediated BRCA1 binding sites within TRs. Thus, BRCA1/SETX complexes support a DNA repair mechanism that addresses R-loop-based DNA damage at transcriptional pause sites.

Abstract: L-type voltage gated Ca2+ channels (LTCCs) are widely expressed within different brain regions including the hippocampus. The isoforms Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 have been shown to be involved in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory, cognitive functions that require proper hippocampal neurogenesis. In vitro, functional LTCCs are expressed on neuronal progenitor cells, where they promote neuronal differentiation. Expression of LTCCs on neural stem and progenitor cells within the neurogenic regions in the adult brain in vivo has not been examined so far, and a contribution of the individual isoforms Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 to adult neurogenesis remained to be clarified. To reveal the role of these channels we first evaluated the expression patterns of Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone (SVZ) in adult (2- and 3-month old) and middle-aged (15-month old) mice on mRNA and protein levels. We performed immunohistological analysis of hippocampal neurogenesis in adult and middle-aged Cav1.3−/− mice and finally addressed the importance of Cav1.3 for hippocampal function by evaluating spatial memory and depression-like behavior in adult Cav1.3−/− mice. Our results showed Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 expression at different stages of neuronal differentiation. While Cav1.2 was primarily restricted to mature NeuN+ granular neurons, Cav1.3 was expressed in Nestin+ neural stem cells and in mature NeuN+ granular neurons. Adult and middle-aged Cav1.3−/− mice showed severe impairments in dentate gyrus neurogenesis, with significantly smaller dentate gyrus volume, reduced survival of newly generated cells, and reduced neuronal differentiation. Further, Cav1.3−/− mice showed impairment in the hippocampus dependent object location memory test, implicating Cav1.3 as an essential element for hippocampus-associated cognitive functions. Thus, modulation of LTCC activities may have a crucial impact on neurogenic responses and cognition, which should be considered for future therapeutic administration of LTCCs modulators.

Abstract: Summary
Mast cells are critical promoters of adaptive immunity in the contact hypersensitivity model, but the mechanism of allergen sensitization is poorly understood. Using Mcpt5-CreTNFFL/FL mice, we show here that the absence of TNF exclusively in mast cells impaired the expansion of CD8+ T cells upon sensitization and the T-cell-driven adaptive immune response to elicitation. T cells primed in the absence of mast cell TNF exhibited a diminished efficiency to transfer sensitization to naive recipients. Specifically, mast cell TNF promotes CD8+ dendritic cell (DC) maturation and migration to draining lymph nodes. The peripherally released mast cell TNF further critically boosts the CD8+ T-cell-priming efficiency of CD8+ DCs, thereby linking mast cell effects on T cells to DC modulation. Collectively, our findings identify the distinct potential of mast cell TNF to amplify CD8+ DC functionality and CD8+ T-cell-dominated adaptive immunity, which may be of great importance for immunotherapy and vaccination approaches.

Abstract: Summary
The DEAD-box protein DDX6 is a central component of translational repression mechanisms in maternal mRNA storage in oocytes and microRNA-mediated silencing in somatic cells. DDX6 interacts with the CCR4-NOT complex and functions in concert with several post-transcriptional regulators, including Edc3, Pat1, and 4E-T. We show that the conserved CUP-homology domain (CHD) of human 4E-T interacts directly with DDX6 in both the presence and absence of the central MIF4G domain of CNOT1. The 2.1-Å resolution structure of the corresponding ternary complex reveals how 4E-T CHD wraps around the RecA2 domain of DDX6 and contacts CNOT1. Although 4E-T CHD lacks recognizable sequence similarity with Edc3 or Pat1, it shares the same DDX6-binding surface. In contrast to 4E-T, however, the Edc3 and Pat1 FDF motifs dissociate from DDX6 upon CNOT1 MIF4G binding in vitro. The results underscore the presence of a complex network of simultaneous and/or mutually exclusive interactions in DDX6-mediated repression.

Abstract: COPI vesicles are essential to the retrograde transport of proteins in the early secretory pathway. The COPI coatomer complex consists of seven subunits, termed α-, β-, β′-, γ-, δ-, ε-, and ζ-COP, in yeast and mammals. Plant genomes have homologs of these subunits, but the essentiality of their cellular functions has hampered the functional characterization of the subunit genes in plants. Here we have employed virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) and dexamethasone (DEX)-inducible RNAi of the COPI subunit genes to study the in vivo functions of the COPI coatomer complex in plants. The β′-, γ-, and δ-COP subunits localized to the Golgi as GFP-fusion proteins and interacted with each other in the Golgi. Silencing of β′-, γ-, and δ-COP by VIGS resulted in growth arrest and acute plant death in Nicotiana benthamiana, with the affected leaf cells exhibiting morphological markers of programmed cell death. Depletion of the COPI subunits resulted in disruption of the Golgi structure and accumulation of autolysosome-like structures in earlier stages of gene silencing. In tobacco BY-2 cells, DEX-inducible RNAi of β′-COP caused aberrant cell plate formation during cytokinesis. Collectively, these results suggest that COPI vesicles are essential to plant growth and survival by maintaining the Golgi apparatus and modulating cell plate formation.

Abstract: Summary
Eosinophils are white blood cells that function in innate immunity and participate in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory and neoplastic disorders. Their secretory granules contain four cytotoxic proteins, including the eosinophil major basic protein (MBP-1). How MBP-1 toxicity is controlled within the eosinophil itself and activated upon extracellular release is unknown. Here we show how intragranular MBP-1 nanocrystals restrain toxicity, enabling its safe storage, and characterize them with an X-ray-free electron laser. Following eosinophil activation, MBP-1 toxicity is triggered by granule acidification, followed by extracellular aggregation, which mediates the damage to pathogens and host cells. Larger non-toxic amyloid plaques are also present in tissues of eosinophilic patients in a feedback mechanism that likely limits tissue damage under pathological conditions of MBP-1 oversecretion. Our results suggest that MBP-1 aggregation is important for innate immunity and immunopathology mediated by eosinophils and clarify how its polymorphic self-association pathways regulate toxicity intra- and extracellularly.

Abstract: Summary
In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, insight into gene function is typically obtained by in silico homology searches and/or phenotypic analyses of strains bearing mutations within open reading frames. However, the studies herein illustrate how mRNA function is not limited to the expression of a cognate protein. We demonstrate that a stress-induced protein-encoding mRNA (irvA) from the dental caries pathogen Streptococcus mutans directly modulates target mRNA (gbpC) stability through seed pairing interactions. The 5′ untranslated region of irvA mRNA is a trans riboregulator of gbpC and a critical activator of the DDAG stress response, whereas IrvA functions independently in the regulation of natural competence. The irvA riboregulatory domain controls GbpC production by forming irvA-gbpC hybrid mRNA duplexes that prevent gbpC degradation by an RNase J2-mediated pathway. These studies implicate a potentially ubiquitous role for typical protein-encoding mRNAs as riboregulators, which could alter current concepts in gene regulation.

Abstract: Summary
During somitogenesis in embryos, a posteriorly moving differentiation front arrests the oscillations of “segmentation clock” genes, leaving behind a frozen, periodic pattern of expression stripes. Both mathematical theories and experimental observations have invoked a “clock and wavefront” model to explain this phenomenon, in which long-range molecular gradients control the movement of the front and therefore the placement of the stripes in the embryo. Here, we develop a fundamentally different model—a progressive oscillatory reaction-diffusion (PORD) system driven by short-range interactions. In this model, posterior movement of the front is a local, emergent phenomenon that, in contrast to the clock and wavefront model, is not controlled by global positional information. The PORD model explains important features of somitogenesis, such as size regulation, that previous reaction-diffusion models could not explain. Moreover, the PORD and clock and wavefront models make different predictions about the results of FGF-inhibition and tissue-cutting experiments, and we demonstrate that the results of these experiments favor the PORD model.

Abstract: Summary
Glioblastomas display hierarchies with self-renewing cancer stem-like cells (CSCs). RNA sequencing and enhancer mapping revealed regulatory programs unique to CSCs causing upregulation of the iron transporter transferrin, the top differentially expressed gene compared with tissue-specific progenitors. Direct interrogation of iron uptake demonstrated that CSCs potently extract iron from the microenvironment more effectively than other tumor cells. Systematic interrogation of iron flux determined that CSCs preferentially require transferrin receptor and ferritin, two core iron regulators, to propagate and form tumors in vivo. Depleting ferritin disrupted CSC mitotic progression, through the STAT3-FoxM1 regulatory axis, revealing an iron-regulated CSC pathway. Iron is a unique, primordial metal fundamental for earliest life forms, on which CSCs have an epigenetically programmed, targetable dependence.

Abstract: Summary
The intestinal epithelium is the most rapidly self-renewing tissue in adult animals and maintained by intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in both Drosophila and mammals. To comprehensively identify genes and pathways that regulate ISC fates, we performed a genome-wide transgenic RNAi screen in adult Drosophila intestine and identified 405 genes that regulate ISC maintenance and lineage-specific differentiation. By integrating these genes into publicly available interaction databases, we further developed functional networks that regulate ISC self-renewal, ISC proliferation, ISC maintenance of diploid status, ISC survival, ISC-to-enterocyte (EC) lineage differentiation, and ISC-to-enteroendocrine (EE) lineage differentiation. By comparing regulators among ISCs, female germline stem cells, and neural stem cells, we found that factors related to basic stem cell cellular processes are commonly required in all stem cells, and stem-cell-specific, niche-related signals are required only in the unique stem cell type. Our findings provide valuable insights into stem cell maintenance and lineage-specific differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Histones and their posttranslational modifications influence the regulation of many DNA-dependent processes. Although an essential role for histone-modifying enzymes in these processes is well established, defining the specific contribution of individual histone residues remains a challenge because many histone-modifying enzymes have nonhistone targets. This challenge is exacerbated by the paucity of suitable approaches to genetically engineer histone genes in metazoans. Here, we describe a platform in Drosophila for generating and analyzing any desired histone genotype, and we use it to test the in vivo function of three histone residues. We demonstrate that H4K20 is neither essential for DNA replication nor for completion of development, unlike inferences drawn from analyses of H4K20 methyltransferases. We also show that H3K36 is required for viability and H3K27 is essential for maintenance of cellular identity but not for gene activation. These findings highlight the power of engineering histones to interrogate genome structure and function in animals.

Abstract: Summary
Tissue homeostasis requires somatic stem cell maintenance; however, mechanisms regulating this process during organogenesis are not well understood. Here, we identify asymmetrically renewing basal and luminal stem cells in the mammary end bud. We demonstrate that SLIT2/ROBO1 signaling regulates the choice between self-renewing asymmetric cell divisions (ACDs) and expansive symmetric cell divisions (SCDs) by governing Inscuteable (mInsc), a key member of the spindle orientation machinery, through the transcription factor Snail (SNAI1). Loss of SLIT2/ROBO1 signaling increases SNAI1 in the nucleus. Overexpression of SNAI1 increases mInsc expression, an effect that is inhibited by SLIT2 treatment. Increased mInsc does not change cell proliferation in the mammary gland (MG) but instead causes more basal cap cells to divide via SCD, at the expense of ACD, leading to more stem cells and larger outgrowths. Together, our studies provide insight into how the number of mammary stem cells is regulated by the extracellular cue SLIT2.

Abstract: Summary
The highly conserved COP9 signalosome (CSN) complex is a key regulator of all cullin-RING-ubiquitin ligases (CRLs), the largest family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. Until now, it was accepted that the CSN is composed of eight canonical components. Here, we report the discovery of an additional integral and stoichiometric subunit that had thus far evaded detection, and we named it CSNAP (CSN acidic protein). We show that CSNAP binds CSN3, CSN5, and CSN6, and its incorporation into the CSN complex is mediated through the C-terminal region involving conserved aromatic residues. Moreover, depletion of this small protein leads to reduced proliferation and a flattened and enlarged morphology. Finally, on the basis of sequence and structural properties shared by both CSNAP and DSS1, a component of the related 19S lid proteasome complex, we propose that CSNAP, the ninth CSN subunit, is the missing paralogous subunit of DSS1.

Abstract: Summary
Determination of left-right asymmetry in mouse embryos is established by a leftward fluid flow that is generated by clockwise rotation of node cilia. How node cilia achieve stable unidirectional rotation has remained unknown, however. Here we show that brief exposure to the microtubule-stabilizing drug paclitaxel (Taxol) induces randomly directed rotation and changes the ultrastructure of node cilia. In vivo observations and a computer simulation revealed that a regular 9+0 arrangement of doublet microtubules is essential for stable unidirectional rotation of node cilia. The 9+2 motile cilia of the airway, which manifest planar beating, are resistant to Taxol treatment. However, the airway cilia of mice lacking the radial spoke head protein Rsph4a undergo rotational movement instead of planar beating, are prone to microtubule rearrangement, and are sensitive to Taxol. Our results suggest that the absence of radial spokes allows node cilia to rotate unidirectionally but, as a trade-off, renders them ultrastructurally fragile.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding individual variation is fundamental to personalized medicine. Yet interpreting complex phenotype data, such as multi-compartment metabolomic profiles, in the context of genotype data for an individual is complicated by interactions within and between cells and remains an unresolved challenge. Here, we constructed multi-omic, data-driven, personalized whole-cell kinetic models of erythrocyte metabolism for 24 healthy individuals based on fasting-state plasma and erythrocyte metabolomics and whole-genome genotyping. We show that personalized kinetic rate constants, rather than metabolite levels, better represent the genotype. Additionally, changes in erythrocyte dynamics between individuals occur on timescales of circulation, suggesting detected differences play a role in physiology. Finally, we use the models to identify individuals at risk for a drug side effect (ribavirin-induced anemia) and how genetic variation (inosine triphosphatase deficiency) may protect against this side effect. This study demonstrates the feasibility of personalized kinetic models, and we anticipate their use will accelerate discoveries in characterizing individual metabolic variation.

Abstract: Ca2+ influx via store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) plays critical roles in many essential cellular functions. The Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channel complex, consisting of Orai and STIM, is one of the major components of store-operated Ca2+ (SOC) channels. Our previous study demonstrated that histamine can cause sustained Ca2+ entry through SOC channels in OUMS-27 cells derived from human chondrosarcoma. This SOCE was increased by low- and decreased by high-concentrations of 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR and Western blot analyses revealed abundant expressions of Orai1, Orai2 and STIM1. Introduction of dominant negative mutant of Orai1, or siOrai1 knockdown significantly attenuated SOCE. Following histamine application, single molecule imaging using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy demonstrated punctate Orai1–STIM1 complex formation in plasma membrane. In contrast, knockdown or over-expression of Orai2 resulted in an increase or a decrease in SOCE, respectively. Finally, TIRF imaging revealed direct coupling between Orai1 and Orai2, and suggested that Orai2 reduces Orai1 function by formation of a hetero-tetramer. These results provide substantial evidence that Orai1, Orai2 and STIM1 form functional CRAC channels in OUMS-27 cells and that these complexes are responsible for sustained Ca2+ entry in response to agonist stimulation.
