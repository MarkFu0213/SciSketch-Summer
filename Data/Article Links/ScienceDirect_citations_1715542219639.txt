Abstract: Knowledge about the aging behavior of the polymeric encapsulation material in photovoltaic (PV) modules is a very important factor for lifetime prediction. The inability to apply conventional characterization methods without destruction of the module creates the need for new, sensitive and non-invasive characterization methods. Luminescence has recently been introduced as a non-destructive method to follow the degradation of the most common encapsulation material, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA). In aged PV modules inhomogeneous luminescence patterns were found, which are specific for different aging factors such as accelerated thermal aging, UV aging or outdoor weathering. Spatially resolved dynamic scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements of the encapsulating EVA of two sets of differently aged PV mini modules reveals a correlation of the recrystallization peak temperature and the luminescence patterns. The spatial distribution of additives in the EVA and the onset temperature of oxidation were found to show no convincing correlation to the luminescence patterns. The results substantiate that a spatial inhomogeneity of crosslinking properties is a manifestation of aging effects, which is attributed to diffusion limited oxidation (DLO) conditions in the EVA between cell and front glass. The characterization of the EVA luminescence behavior taken over the module surface appears as a valuable tool to assess DLO effects.

Abstract: Thermochromic VO2 has received great attention for smart window application because of its ability to control solar heat gain in response to the temperature variations. It goes through a first order reversible phase transition from the semiconductor to metallic state at critical temperature of 68°C, having higher infrared reflectance above this temperature. This paper summarizes some prominent theories behind this phase transition and presents a comprehensive review of recent progress in all-solution synthesis of VO2 thin film with a particular focus on sol-gel method. Emphasis is given to highlight different precursors exploited to prepare thin films with adjustable morphology and optimized optical properties. Actually, VO2-based coatings show good combination of integrated luminous transmittance (33.1–81.3%) and solar modulation ability (2.2–22.3%). The effect of various dopants such as tungsten, magnesium on thermochromic properties of VO2 thin films is also elaborated. These studies indicate that innovative solutions are essential to overcome the current shortcomings associated with practical application of VO2.

Abstract: We investigated the role of the intracellular energy-sensing AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in the in vitro antiglioma effect of the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor indomethacin. Indomethacin was more potent than COX inhibitors diclofenac, naproxen, and ketoprofen in reducing the viability of U251 human glioma cells. Antiglioma effect of the drug was associated with p21 increase and G2M cell cycle arrest, as well as with oxidative stress, mitochondrial depolarization, caspase activation, and the induction of apoptosis. Indomethacin increased the phosphorylation of AMPK and its targets Raptor and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and reduced the phosphorylation of mTOR and mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) substrates p70S6 kinase and PRAS40 (Ser183). AMPK knockdown by RNA interference, as well as the treatment with the mTORC1 activator leucine, prevented indomethacin-mediated mTORC1 inhibition and cytotoxic action, while AMPK activators metformin and AICAR mimicked the effects of the drug. AMPK activation by indomethacin correlated with intracellular ATP depletion and increase in AMP/ATP ratio, and was apparently independent of COX inhibition or the increase in intracellular calcium. Finally, the toxicity of indomethacin towards primary human glioma cells was associated with the activation of AMPK/Raptor/ACC and subsequent suppression of mTORC1/S6K. By demonstrating the involvement of AMPK/mTORC1 pathway in the antiglioma action of indomethacin, our results support its further exploration in glioma therapy.

Abstract: Thermal energy storage (TES) has gained growing interest in the area of renewable energy due to its great potential for increasing the efficiency of concentrated solar power (CSP) plants. One of the central issues is the development of a working body with desirable properties, namely, thermal conductivity; heat capacity; density; price; availability; and eco-friendliness. This study reports the thermophysical characterization and proposes a reliable and industrial appropriate treatment route for natural Magnetite to obtain a material possessing not only a combination of the above properties, but also the possibility of easy control (programming) of thermal conductivity in a wide range of values. The combination of such properties is exceptional and crucially advantageous for TES applications like packed-bed heat storage systems.

Abstract: Solar technologies require improved material performances or new materials functions, either to improve energy capture or to develop new conversion principles. This work presents a low cost pathway to realize 2D nanophotonic molybdenum crystals having a transition in their optical properties with a tunable cut-off wavelength. These nanostructured materials have a dual function. They can be used as selective solar absorbers and/or selective infrared emitters. This novel pathway for producing low cost nanostructured materials creates new opportunities for solar capture in Concentrated Solar Power, Solar Thermophotovoltaics, Solar Thermo-Electrical Generators and for infrared emission control in thermophotovoltaic technologies.

Abstract: In this paper, a simple and cost-effective wet chemical method is presented to form quasi-inverted pyramids (QIP) on ultrathin c-Si for efficient light trapping and sufficient wettability. The QIP is fabricated by a well-known two-step Ag assisted chemical etching method followed by a post nanostructure rebuilding (NSR) process. The variation of [Ag+] realizes the modulation of QIP size from sub-micro scale to micro scale. The comparable average absorptance value of 50µm c-Si with double-sided QIP fabricated under 0.5mM [Ag+] (QIP-50) to that of 182µm c-Si with double-sided conventional micro-scale pyramid in the spectral range of 300 – 1100nm demonstrates an over 3.6-fold reduction in material usage. In comparison with nanopores-structured light-trapping configuration, the QIP-50 possesses much smaller specific surface area of ~2.39, which alleviates the surface recombination losses. After wet oxidation treatment, the water contact angle (WCA) of QIP-50 (35.73°) can achieve a comparable value to that of wet oxidized polished wafer (33.30°), demonstrating sufficient wettability of the QIP for high efficiency ultrathin c-Si/PEDOT:PSS hybrid solar cells. The finding of QIP with both efficient light trapping and superior wettability provides a new opportunity to improve the performance of ultrathin c-Si/PEDOT:PSS hybrid solar cells with a simple process at low cost.

Abstract: A solution-processable planar perylene diimide, N,N´-dipentyl-3,4,9,10-perylenedicarboximide (PDI), has been demonstrated as a suitable acceptor material to replace the conventional fullerene derivatives (e.g., PCBM) found in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The energy offset between the perovskite and PDI layers was optimized by varying the ratio of halides (iodide to bromide) to improve the exciton dissociation and carrier transport. The PDI acceptor material had higher electron mobility and smoother morphology on perovskite relative to those of PCBM, leading to enhancements in the short circuit current density, fill factor, and power conversion efficiency. The incorporation of PDI in the perovskite devices decreased recombination losses and improved the device stability. The performance of the best PSC containing PDI as the electron transport layer (11%) was higher than that of the best device featuring PCBM (10%).

Abstract: Conjugated polymer poly(9-vinylcarbazole) (PVK) has been explored as an efficient hole transport material (HTM) to replace poly(3,4-ethylenedio-xythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) for the preparation of p-i-n type, inverted planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells. The PVK film can be facilely deposited by room-temperature solution-casting without any doping or post treatments. Using MAPbI3 as the photoactive layer, a 15.8% stabilized power conversion efficiency was achieved in ITO/PVK/MAPbI3/PCBM/Ag devices, which is a significant improvement compared with 12.1% from devices using PEDOT:PSS as the HTM. The perovskite photoactive layer cast on PVK HTM has higher crystallinity and less PbI2 residues, leading to a higher charge recombination resistance of the device. After a storage of 1000h, the PCE of PVK- and PEDOT:PSS- based devices dropped to 82.5% and 56% respectively, and demonstrated that the PVK-based perovskite devices is more stable compared with the PEDOT:PSS-based devices.

Abstract: Single-junction Ge solar cells have been epitaxially grown on GaAs (001) substrates by a low pressure metalorganic chemical vapor deposition using isobutylgermane. Various growth conditions have been studied to reduce the high doping level of over 1×1019cm−3 of the p-type Ge epitaxial layer, which is detrimental to the minority carrier collection efficiency. By increasing the growth rate and employing a discontinuous doping technique, the p-type doping level of the epitaxial Ge layer has been lowered to 2×1018cm−3, and the hole mobility increased from 44 to 162cm2/Vs. A high power conversion efficiency of 6.72% can be achieved under AM1.5G illumination by the epitaxial Ge solar cell with the lowered doping level in the p-type Ge base region. The spectral response of the epitaxial Ge solar cell with a 5µm thick base layer is good enough to use for InGaP/GaAs/Ge triple-junction solar cells.

Abstract: Copper antimony sulfide (CuSbS2) thin films were prepared by annealing and rapid thermal processing (RTP) of Sb2S3–Cu precursor layers at different conditions. Sb2S3 thin films (200nm) were deposited by chemical bath deposition from a solution containing SbCl3 and Na₂S₂O₃. Copper layers were thermally evaporated onto the Sb2S3 thin films. A systematic study was done by varying Cu layer thickness as well as the heating conditions. Cu thickness was varied from low (<10nm) to 100nm and the heating conditions were annealing at 380°C, RTP at 500/600°C and annealing at 380°C followed by RTP. The thin films formed at different conditions were analyzed using different techniques to determine their crystalline structure, morphology, elemental composition, chemical state and physical properties. For the given Sb2S3 thickness, Cu 50nm was identified as the effective Cu thickness for the formation of CuSbS2. The CuSbS2 thin films formed at different conditions were incorporated in photovoltaic structures of superstrate configuration: Glass/ITO/CdS/CuSbS2. The best photovoltaic parameters obtained were Voc=665mV, Jsc=1.35mA/cm2, FF=0.62 and η=0.6% measured under illumination using AM1.5 radiation from a solar simulator. Voc and FF are the highest values ever reported for the CuSbS2 based solar cells. The present work strengthens the research activities to improve CuSbS2 based photovoltaic performance, and thus PV technologies using earth abundant and non-toxic materials.

Abstract: As the main electrical power source of spacecraft, solar cells require high electrical performance and light weight, to provide enough electrical power for missions in space and to lower costs for launching. Multi-junction compound semiconductor solar cells generate relatively high power, but their rigid substrates are tens or hundreds of times thicker than the solar cells. In this paper, methods are described to realize flexible space solar cell arrays that can be wrapped on non-planar surfaces, by removing the rigid substrates and integrating the thin solar cells on flexible substrates. Cover glasses were integrated over the solar cells on flexible substrates through an guided-printing method, providing both flexibility and radiation shielding. Experimental results and mechanical analysis demonstrate the mechanical and electrical performances of these flexible space solar cell arrays.

Abstract: In this paper, a novel Na2SO4·10H2O-Na2HPO4·12H2O eutectic hydrated salt (EHS) with melting temperature of 31.2℃/no phase separation was firstly prepared for thermal energy storage applications at heating solar greenhouses and active solar heating systems in buildings. In order to inhibit supercooling and enhance thermal conductivity of EHS, nano-α-Al2O3 at different weight proportions was loaded into EHS. The multi-factors orthogonal test method has been employed to evaluate the nucleation effects of nano-α-Al2O3. Besides, various characterization techniques such as DSC, OM, SEM and FT-IR were adopted to investigate the thermal properties, microstructure and chemical stability. The results showed that nano-α-Al2O3 was a highly effective nucleating agent and excellent thermal conductive filler. The supercooling degree was reduced from 7.8℃ to 1.6℃ and the thermal conductivities were improved by up to 61.3% when adding 4.5wt% nano-α-Al2O3 and 1.0wt% borax. Moreover, the latent heat of 4.5wt% nano-α-Al2O3 modified EHS decreased by only about 8% and its melting point maintained constant as that of pure EHS. In addition, the modified EHS had good thermal and chemical stability after 200 thermal cycles.

Abstract: Objective/background
To assess the percentage of CD4+, CD8+, and natural killer cells (CD16+, CD56+) in children with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) at presentation and study their impact on disease chronicity.
Methods
This case–control study was conducted at the Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Unit, Menoufia University Hospital (tertiary care center in Egypt). The study was held on 30 children presenting with ITP; they were followed-up and classified into two groups: 15 children with acute ITP; and 15 children with chronic ITP. Patients were compared to a group of 15 healthy children of matched age and sex. Measurements of CD4+, CD8+, and natural killer cells (CD16+, CD56+) by flow cytometry were assessed and compared in these groups.
Results
CD4+ and CD4+/CD8+ were significantly lower in acute and chronic patients than the control group (p<0.05 and p<0.001, respectively), with no significant difference between acute and chronic patients (p>0.05). However, CD8+ was significantly higher in acute and chronic patients than the control group (p<0.05), with no significant difference between acute and chronic patients (p>0.05). Natural killer cell percent was significantly lower in acute patients than the control group (p<0.001), with no significant difference between chronic and control groups (p>0.05).
Conclusion
ITP is associated with immunity dysfunction denoted by the increase in cytotoxic T lymphocytes and the decrease in natural killer cells.

Abstract: Low Voc is the major factor limiting the current efficiency of pure sulfide Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) thin film solar cells. In this work, stacking two CZTS layers with different majority doping levels is employed to increase Voc. With this double-layer structure, the obtained highest efficiency is 7.57% with Voc of 734mV, Jsc of 15.4mA/cm2 and FF of 67.0%. Compared to the traditional device with single CZTS layer (Efficiency: 7.62%, Voc: 665mV, Jsc: 20.0mA/cm2, FF: 57.3%), the average Voc has been increased by 70–80mV. However the Jsc was decreased due to voids within the CZTS and severe band tailing problem, limiting the further boost of efficiency for double-layer CZTS solar cell.

This method generates randomly shaped cone-like structures that offer a clear advantage over nanowires by enabling straightforward passivation with standard techniques. Average reflection values as low as 3% have been achieved. Optimizing the thickness of anti-reflective coatings, the doping depth and the screen-printed metal firing process increases the short circuit current of the cell by 0.82mA/cm2 over the reference cells, which had a pyramidal texture without nano-texturing.

Abstract: Hydrogen doped indium oxide (In2O3:H) with excellent optoelectronic properties, deposited using atomic layer deposition (ALD), has been made applicable as a window electrode material for silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells. It is particularly challenging to integrate ALD In2O3:H into SHJ solar cells due to a low reactivity of the metalorganic precursor cyclopentadienyl indium (InCp) with the H-terminated surface of a-Si:H. This challenge has been overcome by a simple and effective plasma-based surface pretreatment developed in this work. A remote inductively coupled O2 or Ar plasma has been used to modify the surface of a-Si:H, thereby promoting the adsorption of InCp on the surface. The impact of the short plasma exposure on c-Si/a-Si:H interface passivation has also been studied. It has been found that the observed degradation of the interface is not due to ion bombardment, but rather due to ultraviolet emission from the plasma. Fortunately, these light-induced defects have been found to be metastable, and the interface passivation can thus easily be fully recovered by a short post-annealing. Using such a mild Ar plasma pretreatment, ALD In2O3:H has been successfully implemented in a SHJ solar cell. A short-circuit current density of 40.1mA/cm2, determined from external quantum efficiency, is demonstrated for a textured SHJ solar cell with an In2O3:H window electrode, compared to 38.5mA/cm2 for a reference cell that has the conventional Sn-doped indium oxide (In2O3:Sn, ITO) window electrode. The enhanced photocurrent stems from a reduced parasitic absorption of In2O3:H in the entire wavelength range of 400–1200nm.

Abstract: In this work, lead chloride (PbCl2) and lead acetate trihydrate (Pb(Ac)2·3H2O) mixed precursors are introduced to prepare perovskite films. PbCl2 has been reported to enhance crystallinity but long annealing time is required. Pb(Ac)2·3H2O is used because it is cheap and easy to get, and lead acetate offers fast crystallization process, meanwhile the trihydrate might improve the film stability. With an optimal blending ratio of the two precursors (1:1mol ratio), compact and full-coverage perovskite film with large grain sizes (>1µm) are obtained, and the speed of perovskite film formation is greatly accelerated. Moreover, the film prepared in a 1:1mol ratio of the two precursors exhibits good moisture liability for several days under around 70% RH environment. As a result, the PbCl2: Pb(Ac)2·3H2O (1:1) results in the highest efficiency of 14.77%. The findings in this work provide a facile way to improve the perovskite film quality and stability.

Abstract: Viologen-based liquid electrochromic mixtures provide high performance in terms of optical contrast and response time. However, their use in flexible ECDs is quite limited due to the risk of leakage and difficult manufacturing and handling. Herein, it is demonstrated that the incorporation of viologen-based electrochromic mixtures into paper-matrix is a promising solution to overcome the mentioned issues. The performance of flexible paper-based devices using both water-free and water-based formulations containing viologens is assessed for the first time and compared with paper-free devices. The benefits of using paper on the homogeneity, life-time (operating devices above 1000 redox cycles) and robustness against bending (operating devices above 200 bending cycles) is proven: while short-circuits, inhomogeneous coloration and ITO-etching usually occur in the paper-free devices, these concerns are avoided when the liquid mixtures are embedded within the paper-matrix while keeping the good electrochromic performance typically provided by liquid formulations. Additionally, a patterned bi-chromic (blue-green) device is presented as a proof-of-concept to show the potential of these paper-based systems in the field of flexible EC displays.

Abstract: An unconventional approach is applied for the first time to study the effect of silver nanoparticles incorporation in plasmonic organic photovoltaic devices. The incorporation of silver nanoparticles in the photoactive film results in enhanced PV performance and stability with respect to the reference device. The role of the local morphology in improving the plasmonic device properties is addressed by time-resolved high spatial resolution X-ray diffraction investigations. TR-HRXD was performed in-situ on an integrated OPV device incorporating silver nanoparticles in the photoactive layer during annealing (simulating the working conditions). Such time-space resolved method allowed tracking the modifications of the structural properties at each layer and interfaces. Remarkably, it is demonstrated that it possible to track the variation of the plasmonic spatial distribution inside the device over time, a factor strongly influencing the photovoltaic performance.

Abstract: Precursor and substrate costs currently limit the adoption of III-V photovoltaics for large scale manufacturing. Here, we use water-mediated close-spaced vapor transport (CSVT) to produce homojunction GaAs devices with pressed GaAs powder as an alternative to expensive gas-phase precursors. These unpassivated devices reach Voc >910mV, demonstrating the plausibility of CSVT as an alternative method for growth of III-V epitaxial films for photovoltaic devices. We find that Zn-doping of the absorber films decreases after a number of growths cycles using a single source, which suggests an alternative transport agent should be investigated for p-type doping. Performance of these solar cells is largely limited by formation of macroscopic surface defects which we find to be caused by particulate transfer from the source material and the formation of oxide phases during growth. We present strategies for mitigating these defects and improving device performance.

Abstract: High temperature thermal energy storage (TES) is a crucial technology ensuring continuous generation of power from solar energy and plays a major role in the industrial field. Choosing the optimal storage material remains a great challenge. From the literature, it is understood that the natural rock is a good suitable material for TES in concentrating solar power (CSP) plants. However, not much work has been published on the behavior of rock and its suitability for TES. This paper evaluates the potential of rocks as candidate materials for use in high temperature thermal storage. On one hand, we provide literatures on sensible heat storage (SHS) materials and works carried out on packed rock beds, and on the other hand, experimental tests are conducted and data are analyzed and discussed in order to choose the best rocks among fifty two varieties. According to various criteria, the obtained results show that dolerite, granodiorite, hornfels, gabbro and quartzitic sandstone are the good candidates to be used as storage materials for air-based solar systems.

Abstract: The impact of the anodization process of anodic aluminum oxide fabrication and post-deposition anneal on effective carrier lifetime of Si nanowires are reported. The anodization process with suitable switched-off anodization currents results in enhanced effective carrier lifetime of Si nanowires that are significantly higher than that of early and late switched-off anodization currents. Furthermore, the anodic aluminum oxide template exhibits an efficient passivation upon post-deposition anneal, yielding a maximum value of 228μs under thermal treatment at 650°C. First fabrication of Si nanowire solar cell embedded with anodic aluminum oxide template was carried out. Through post-deposition anneal prior to the fabrication of Si nanowire solar cells, the performance of Si nanowire solar cells was significantly improved. This established the impact of thermal treatment on opto-electronic characteristics of Si nanowires embedded with anodic aluminum oxide.

Abstract: The use of nanofluids as the working fluid in systems for converting solar to thermal energy has led to remarkable progresses. This study has investigated the thermo-optical characteristics of nanofluids containing Graphene oxide nanoplatelets/deionized water as the working fluid for low-temperature direct absorption solar collectors (DASCs). The prepared samples of nanofluid contain graphene oxide nanoplatelets based on deionized water with weight percentages of 0.001, 0.005, 0.015 and 0.045. Results show that the applied nanofluid has suitable ability compared to the base fluid in absorbing solar energy, ranging from 200 to 2500nm. Also, results from calculation of absorbed energy's fraction suggest that the minimum height or thickness of the nanofluid layer having the ability of full sun's energy, is for the nanofluid with weight percentage of 0.045 and height of 3cm that has the ability of absorbing 99.6% of energy. The thermal conductivity coefficient of prepared samples was measured at temperature ranging 25–50. Results showed that increasing the weight percentage of nanofluid along with increase in temperature would improve nanofluid's thermal properties in comparison with the base fluid. Finally, by investigating the impact of weight percentage of the nanofluid's temperature on radiative properties and thermal conductivity, this nanofluid with strong absorption band in the range of 280–350nm (nanometers) was introduced and proposed as the appropriate environment for using direct absorption solar collectors.

Abstract: Thin film organic photovoltaic cell (TFOSC) is increasingly becoming an alternative solar energy converter and offering several potential advantages over inorganic molecules based devices. Tremendous research progresses have been made on the realization of TFOSC in the last two decades. Despite intensive research efforts towards reaching the required 10% power conversion efficiency (PCE) threshold, the device environmental stability and the constant requirement for high vacuum top metal electrode deposition still remain the major challenges. One of the encouraging findings in terms of alternative device architecture that caters for these challenges is the inverted device architecture of polymer solar cells. This review covers recent progress and approaches that have been achieved to improve device performance due to the changes in properties and structures of the constituent layers such as electrodes, active layers and buffer layers of the inverted organic solar cell.

Abstract: Zn diffusion processes in n-Ga0.78In0.22As0.2Sb0.8 epitaxial films are studied using different diffusion sources, a series of the Zn profiles with single and double humps are obtained. The group V-atoms (As and Sb) are found to have little effect on suppressing the surface “dead region”. The Ga and In atoms have entirely different effect on diffusion although they are both group III-atoms. The “dead region” is suppressed completely under Ga-rich conditions, while the suppression will not occur under In-rich conditions. The GaInAsSb cells are fabricated under pure Zn and Ga-rich conditions. An electrical heating thermophotovoltaic system is fabricated for cell testing. Under the radiation from 1055°C-SiN ceramics emitter, the output power density of the GaInAsSb cell obtained under Ga-rich condition is much larger than that of the cell obtained under pure Zn condition, which demonstrated that the GaInAsSb cells can be fabricated without precise etching under Ga-rich conditions.

Abstract: Endogenous neural stem cells (NSCs) are the most promising sources for replacing cells lost after spinal cord injury (SCI). We have previously shown that substance P (SP), a neuropeptide, improves functional recovery after SCI and increases the numbers of cells in lesion sites, but how this occurs is unclear. Here, we investigate whether SP regulates the neurogenesis of resident NSCs as well as exerting a beneficial effect on functional improvement. We found that SP (5nmol/kg) treatment markedly improved functional recovery and elicited robust activation of endogenous NSCs and boosted the number of EdU+ proliferating cells differentiating into neurons, but it reduced astroglial differentiation in the lesion sites. Consistently, treatment with SP (10nM) in vitro significantly increased the proliferation of NSCs via activating the Erk1/2 signaling pathway and promoted neuronal differentiation but not astroglial differentiation. These results suggest that SP may represent a potential therapeutic agent for SCI via enhancing endogenous neurogenesis.

Abstract: Thin film solar cells may exhibit high conversion efficiencies provided their active material exhibits a high quality, like in the case of crystalline silicon, and if incident light coupling and absorption are appropriately controlled. We propose to integrate an advanced light trapping process relying on photonic crystals including a controlled pseudo-disorder. Thanks to Rigorous Coupled Wave Analysis, we determine the optimized nanophotonic structures that should be appropriately introduced in 1µm thick crystalline silicon layers standing on a metal layer like aluminum. Thanks to a carefully controlled pseudo-disorder perturbation, absorption in these designed nanopatterns overcome that predicted in the case of fully optimized square lattice photonic crystals. Fabricated structures are analyzed in light of this numerical investigation to evidence the impact of such controlled perturbations, but also the influence of the measurement method and the technological imperfections. Thanks to the optimized perturbated photonic crystals, the integrated absorption in 1µm thick crystalline Silicon layer increases from 37.7%, in the case of the unpatterned stack, to 70.7%. The sole effect of pseudo-disorder on the fully optimized simply periodic photonic crystals leads to an absolute increase of the integrated absorption up to 2%, as predicted by simulations, while both structures are fabricated using exactly the same process flow.

Abstract: Intermediate reflecting layers (IRL) in multijunction solar cells improve the spectral light management and thereby increase the overall energy conversion efficiency. Nevertheless, the incorporation of an IRL can increase parasitic losses in the device mainly by three effects: (i) parasitic absorption in the IRL, (ii) increased parasitic absorption in the transparent front electrode due to the light reflection at the IRL, and (iii) reflection losses due to insufficient absorption of light in the top solar cell that is reflected at the IRL. Here, we investigate the different contributions of these three loss mechanisms on the external quantum efficiency and short-circuit current density by a combination of experiment and optical simulation. The parasitic absorption in the transparent front electrode is varied experimentally by a post-deposition laser annealing process on the front electrode layer. The experimental work is supplemented by rigorous optical simulations which allow to extract and vary the parasitic absorption losses in the IRL by a variation of the optical material properties. Furthermore, the cell reflectance is studied by experiment and simulation for different layer configurations. Our comparative study reveals that the dominating parasitic losses are absorption within the intermediate reflector and reflection out of the solar cell. From this study, we show one possible solution for advanced light management in tandem solar cells with intermediate reflectors.

Abstract: Solar cells based on evaporated Cs2O/GaSe9 and Cs2O/Se (as comparison) active layers have been investigated. We correlate their performance with devices previously reported without Cs2O. GaSe9 appears as a very promising solar absorber because of its attractive optical and electrical properties. We improved device performance by around 30% by inserting a Cs2O thin interlayer. Current density-voltage, capacitance-voltage and impedance spectroscopy measurements were used to characterize the effect of Cs2O layer on device performance. The charge carrier concentration and the built-in potential were derived using Schottky-Mott relation. The enhancement promoted by Cs2O is attributed to an improvement in electron extraction efficiency by FTO, and the avoidance of Se sublimation during the annealing process. The insertion of the metallic oxide also increases the built-in potential at FTO/GaSe9 interface. Dynamic processes were clearly identified by impedance spectroscopy under complex modulus analysis, confirming better capabilities of charge collection by the Cs2O containing electrodes.

Abstract: Organic-inorganic perovskite cell has shown a great deal of interest in past few years due to its ability to achieve high power conversion efficiency (PCE). Use of charge transport layers such as n-type TiO2 and p-type doped spiroOMeTAD in a n-i-p device architecture has shown enhanced perovskite solar cell device performance. Use of doped spiroOMeTAD as hole transport layer in the n-i-p device structure has been effective but possess disadvantages such as complex processing, use of corrosive additives, processing in ambient air for efficient hole doping. Here we report the study of solution processed benzodithiophene based polymer PBDTT-FTTE as an alternative hole transport layer to doped small molecule spiroOMeTAD. PBDT-FTTE doped with 3% DIO (diiodooctane) achieved PCE of 11.6% which was comparable to matching PCE of 11.6% obtained from using spiroOMeTAD as hole transport layer. We showed that unlike spiroOMeTAD, polymer PBDTT-FTTE is processed inside N2 filled glove box and is easier to process as compared to spiroOMeTAD which requires processing in ambient humid air and is doped with additives mixed in corrosive solvent, causing degradation to perovskite layer underneath.

Abstract: Thermal energy storage (TES) is a critical component in a concentrated solar power (CSP) plant since it is able to provide dispatchability and increase the capacity factor of the plant. Recently the Brayton power cycle using supercritical carbon dioxide (s-CO2) has attracted considerable attention as it allows a higher thermal to electric power conversion efficiency compared to the conventional Rankine cycle using subcritical steam. However, no commercial TES has yet been developed for integration with a s-CO2 based plant. One reason is the lack of a suitable storage material. This work explores the use of a eutectic NaCl-Na2CO3 salt as a reliable high temperature phase change material (PCM). The PCM has been thermally cycled up to 1000 times. Its thermo-physical properties have been measured before and after it has been subjected to the thermal cycling and its corrosion behavior has been investigated. This eutectic salt shows good thermal stability without degradation after cycling 1000 times between 600 and 650°C. The corrosion rate on stainless steel 316 (SS316) increases linearly up to 350 cycles, and thereafter it stabilizes at 70mg/cm2.

Abstract: For the first time, pristine ZnO nano-particles can be used as effective catalyst for water disinfection by killing and complete mineralization of two gram negative bacteria with direct solar light. Just like in earlier studies, pristine nano-size ZnO particles have shown anti-bacterial activity against two types of gram negative bacteria, E. coli and P. aeruginosa, where up to 20% of the former and 25% of the latter have been killed in the dark. Under direct solar radiation, the pristine ZnO particles readily catalyzed bacterial photo-degradation. While earlier studies were mostly limited to bacterial death and growth inhibition by pristine ZnO particles, the results describe for the first time how bacteria and their organic content can be completely photo-mineralized by direct solar radiations in 60min. Only the bacterial cell wall fragments resisted the photo-degradation process. Under the reaction conditions, the degradation occurred by the UV tail of the direct solar light, where the ZnO nano-particles behaved as photo-catalysts. The results show the added value of using ZnO nano-particles as photo-catalysts in water disinfection strategies, leaving no resulting organic molecules in water.

Abstract: A smart supercapacitor shares the same electrochemical processes as a conventional energy storage device while also having electrochromic functionality. The smart supercapacitor device can sense the energy storage level, which it displays in a visually discernible manner, providing increased convenience in everyday applications. Here, we report an electro-optically tunable smart supercapacitor based on an oxygen-rich nanograin WO3 electrode. The nanostructured WO3 electrode is dark blue in color in the charged state and becomes transparent in its discharged state with a high optical modulation of 82%. The supercapacitor has a specific capacitance of 228Fg−1 at 0.25 Ag−1 with a large potential window (1.4V). It is highly durable, exhibits good electrochemical stability over 2000 cycles, retains 75% of its initial capacitance, and exhibits high coloration efficiency (~170cm2/C). The excellent electrochromic and electrochemical supercapacitor properties of the electrode is due to the synergetic effect between nanograin morphology and excess oxygen. A smart-supercapacitor fabricated with an oxygen-rich nanograin WO3 electrode exhibits a superb combination of energy storage and highly-efficient electrochromic features in one device that can monitor the energy storage level through visible changes in color.

Abstract: Thin-film solar cells with a kesterite-type Cu2ZnSnSxSe4−x absorber have been prepared via a two-step process based on a metal salt solution with subsequent annealing in Se-containing nitrogen-atmosphere. Particular attention is paid to the interface between absorber and molybdenum, where the formation of secondary phases could be proven by a model experiment. To inhibit this formation, different back contact configurations of Mo and TiN have been tested. It is shown that TiN is an effective chalcogen barrier and avoids the formation of MoSxSe2−x, but influences the crystallinity of the absorber layer in a negative way, thereby also decreasing the open-circuit voltage. An effect on short-circuit current density and series resistance was not observed. The best results were obtained with an additional, thin Mo-layer on top of the TiN.

Abstract: Efficient PbS quantum dot (QD) solar cell with the traditional structure requires an inorganic buffer layer that is usually fabricated at high temperature, which is not compatible with the industrially preferential roll-to-roll fabrication process. Identification of a suitable buffer layer and efficient device construction are thus of particular significance. Herein, we fabricate PbS quantum dot solar cells in an inverted structure using poly(thiophene) (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as the anode buffer layer. The resulting devices present a high efficiency of 4.1%, among the best values of inverted PbS QD solar cells. Electrochemical and photoelectric characterizations have shown that, compared with high-temperature annealed nickel oxide (NiO) and vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) layers, the low-temperature processed PEDOT:PSS layer has a more compatible film properties for efficient injection and collection of charges from PbS QD active layer. Our work provides a promising strategy for fabrication of QD solar cells in an economical and efficient way.

Abstract: In this paper, we report a simple and highly reproducible strategy to fabricate a high-performance hysteresis-free organic-inorganic based perovskite solar cell (PSC). A single-step, fast deposition-crystallization method has been adopted for preparing MAPbI3 based perovskite film. The role of ethoxyethane as an anti-solvent and the importance of deposition time in film crystallization have been investigated in detail. The solvent deposition time is observed to have a significant impact on the crystal growth and performance of PSCs. Intensive characterization, which includes scanning electron microscopy, UV–visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction studies and photovoltaic characterization, has been carried out to attribute the improved performance. In addition, the influence of FK209 Co(III) complex doped in organic hole transporting material for better charge extraction and transportation in PSC has been discussed in detail. This proposed strategy, involving a co-solvent deposition time of 10s and 1.3% doping of FK209 Co (III) complex, provides a high 90% reproducible, hysteresis-free PSC with an average power conversion efficiency of 13.3% corresponding to an increment in photocurrent density (Jsc) by 31% and open circuit voltage (Voc) by 6%.

Abstract: Solar Photovoltaic (PV) cells can absorb up to 80% of the incident solar radiation obtained from the solar band, however, only a small amount of this absorbed incident energy is transformed into electricity depending on the conversion efficiency of the PV cells and part of remainder energy increases the temperature of PV cell. High solar radiation and ambient temperature lead to an elevated photovoltaic cell operating temperature, which affects its lifespan and power output adversely. Number of techniques have been attempted to maintain the temperature of photovoltaic cells close to their nominal operating value. In the present review various cooling techniques such as natural and forced air cooling, hydraulic cooling, heat pipe cooling, cooling with phase change materials and thermoelectric cooling of PV panels are discussed at length. It is important to note that, though cooling techniques are highly needed to regulate the PV module temperature, especially for mega installations, these should be economically viable too.

Abstract: In this paper, the experimental results of a 10MeV proton irradiation on concentrator GaInP/GaAs/Ge lattice-matched triple-junction solar cells and their corresponding subcells are examined. Electro-optical characterization such as external quantum efficiency, light and dark I-V measurements, is performed together with theoretical device modeling in order to guide the analysis of the degradation behavior. The GaInP (on Ge) and Ge cell showed a power loss between beginning of life and end of life of about 4% while the GaInP/GaAs/Ge and GaAs solar cells exhibited the highest damage measured of 12% and 10%, respectively for an irradiation fluence equivalent to an 8-years satellite mission in Low Earth Orbit. The results from single-junction solar cells correlate well with those of triple-junction solar cells. The performance of concentrator solar cells structures is similar to that of traditional space-targeted designs reported in literature suggesting that no special changes may be required to use triple junction concentrator solar cells in space.

Abstract: Objective/background
Chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the standard treatment for multiple myeloma (MM). Thalidomide or bortezomib may be combined with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone, in what are known as the CTD and VCD protocols, respectively. The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics and response rates obtained with CTD and VCD, observing whether the inclusion of bortezomib to treat MM patients in Brazil increases therapeutic efficiency.
Methods
Forty-three MM patients treated with induction protocols CTD and VCD between January 2010 and March 2015 were included. The parameters analyzed were staging, frequency of comorbidities prior to treatment, response rates obtained at each induction cycle, progression-free survival, and overall survival of patients.
Results
Very good partial response and complete response obtained with the VCD protocol were superior, compared with the CTD treatment. The presence of comorbidities was similar in the two groups, except kidney failure, which prevailed in the VCD group. Also, 78.3% and 48.3% of patients treated with the VCD and CTD protocols underwent autologous HSCT, respectively. In patients given the VCD protocol, 45.5% had complete response before autologous HSCT. Among those given CTD, this number was only 7.1% (p=0.023). Disease progression after autologous HSCT did not differ between the two groups.
Conclusion
VCD afforded better responses than the CTD protocol, and improved patient condition before autologous HSCT. However, more studies are necessary including more patients and addressing various clinical conditions, besides the analysis of cost-effectiveness of these treatments.

Abstract: Recent developments of PSCs have achieved great progress with power conversion efficiency reached to 22.1%. The crystal growth process as an important factor will significantly influence the quality of perovskite films and the device performance. In this paper, we demonstrate a simple approach for fast preparation based on the precursor compositions of (FAPbI3) 0.85 (MAPbBr3)0.15 by regulating the temperature during annealing process for transition from FAI, PbI2, MABr, and PbBr2 to perovskite. The film will be shaped in 15s for one-step deposition at annealing temperature of 220°C. It has been found that higher temperature will induce perovskite to form larger size and oriented crystal grains rapidly. This will contribute to longer carrier lifetime and smaller carrier recombination which, are beneficial for solar cell device. The champion cell with PCE of 17.1% had been obtained measured under conditions of AM 1.5G, 100mW/cm2. Furthermore, this method exhibits good stability which is benefited from large size crystal, the device will not be deteriorated and the PCE maintained over 90% after 3 months.

Abstract: Cubic perovskite BaSnO3 (BSO) nanostructure has rationally been addressed as a promising charge carrier transporting material in dye sensitized solar cells (DSCs) next to TiO2. In the present work, the Fe impurity ions have initially been introduced into BSO crystallographic system with the help of solution chemistry for systematically altering the position of atoms in their lattice point towards developing insight properties. The changing of physical properties (structural, morphological, optical and magnetic) of BSO semiconductor by Fe doping is significantly confirmed by using fundamental characteristic tools. After authentically identifying the desirable physico-chemical properties of BSO by a gradient Fe dopant, we sensitively engineer the pristine, 0.01%, 0.03% and 0.05% Fe doped BSO/TiCl4 treatment/TiO2 scattering layer novel photoelectrodes for fabricating DSCs. As scientifically expected that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of Fe doped BSO/TiCl4 treatment/TiO2 scattering layer photoanodes is increased as compared to that of pristine BSO/TiCl4 treatment/TiO2 scattering layer photoanode. We have achieved one of the highest PCE in 0.03% Fe doped BSO/TiCl4 treatment/TiO2 scattering layer photoelectrode based DSCs, the obtained maximum value is 7.78%. The stability of the novel BSO photoelectrodes is then measured by using transient photocurrent and photovoltage measurements.

Abstract: The microstructure and intermetallic phase growth in solder joints of photovoltaic modules are investigated because of their significance for interconnection reliability. Interconnector ribbons with Sn60Pb40, Sn62Pb36Ag2, Sn43Bi57, Sn41Bi57Ag2 and Sn91Zn9 are soldered on the front busbars of industrial crystalline silicon solar cells. Cross sections are inspected using microscopy, SEM and EDX. The interconnections are isothermally aged, whereas the intermetallic layer thickness is determined successively. The microstructural changes in the bonds are characterized. Grain coarsening, volume increase of intermetallic compounds, Sn-penetration into the metallization and growth of grain boundaries between the phases are found. The composition of the intermetallic phases within Sn91Zn9-bonds is discussed. A diffusion model is used to simulate the intermetallic layer growth after 3000h at 85°C and thermal cycling from −40°C to 85°C for 600 cycles. A prognosis of the phase growth within the photovoltaic module after 25 years at the location Freiburg in Germany is made. It is found that the Ag3Sn-phase using Sn43Bi57 extends to 6.6µm after 3000h at 85°C as compared to 2.6µm for Sn60Pb40. After 25 years in Freiburg the Ag3Sn-layer within Sn43Bi57 joints is predicted to be 2.4µm whereas within Sn60Pb40-bonds only 2.2µm.

Abstract: A novel Mo/ZrSiN/ZrSiON/SiO2 solar selective absorbing coating has been investigated, which was prepared by magnetron sputtering on stainless steel substrate. A high solar absorptance of 0.94 and a low thermal emittance of 0.06 at 25°C were achieved. By proportionally decreasing the thicknesses of the ZrSiN, ZrSiON and SiO2 layers, the thermal emittance at 500°C was decreased significantly from 0.19 to 0.12 (Δε=0.07) while keeping the solar absorptance unchanged. The coating also showed high thermal stability at 500°C in vacuum, implying that it is a promising candidate for high temperature concentrated solar power (CSP) applications.

Abstract: A clean and flexible synthesis of TiO2 nanocrystallites for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and perovskite solar cells (PSCs) was proposed. Anatase nanocrystallites with different morphologies and sizes ranging from 5nm to 30nm were synthesized in one pot via the microwave solvothermal method using different types of alcohol solvents, namely, n-propanol (NPA), isopropanol (IPA), and octanol (OCT). No ionic additive was added during the synthesis. The influences of crystallite size and morphology on the photovoltaic performances of the DSSCs and PSCs were investigated. Results showed that using OCT (5–7nm) as a photoanode offered the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE), which gave rise to the apparent high dye loading capability and long electron recombination lifetime of OCT. The best PCE of the OCT-based DSSC device reached 9.58%, with the film thickness being only 10.6μm where no scattering layer was needed. By contrast, the IPA (20–30nm)-based photoanode showed good adaptability to PSC applications because of its homogeneity and large mean pore size that facilitated the infiltration of the perovskite sensitizer. The IPA-based PSC device attained the highest PCE of 15.3%, with Jsc being 21.55mA/cm2 and VOC being 1.07V.

Abstract: Polymer solar cell (PSC) manufacturing is strongly influenced by the thin film deposition method with the morphology of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) coupled intimately to the efficiency of the device. Although ideally scalable deposition methods suitable for sheet-to-sheet (S2S) or roll-to-roll (R2R) production should be used in the investigation of PSCs, research still predominately relies on spin-coating due to ease of use and lower associated costs. Here we present the development and characterization of a lab-scale slot-die coater and demonstrate its use to fabricate air-stable, large-area, solar cell modules. We adapt an entry level paint applicator into a fully-functional S2S slot-die coater and provide its open source documentation to support the research community in availing itself of scalable photovoltaic technologies for device fabrication. The optimization of the process parameters results in homogeneous layers that have been extensively characterized by light beam induced current (LBIC), micro photoluminescence (PL), and micro Raman mapping of whole modules. We report the successful demonstration of the fabrication of PSC modules with an active area above 35cm2 and a power conversion efficiency exceeding 3%. We also investigate the behavior of the module characteristics at different annealing temperatures and its stability during operation under ambient conditions. This work will facilitate research on scaling up of laboratory organic electronic devices and allow more efficient transition from Lab-to-Fab.

Abstract: A new model of solar reactor based on a double-loop fluidized bed involving CeO2 nanoparticles and two gas streams, N2 and CO2, for efficient thermochemical fuel production, is presented. The fluidized bed reactors are commonly used to carry out a variety of chemical reactions, due to solid granular materials, which play the fundamental role of catalyst. In the system under investigation, the overall reaction CO2→CO+1⁄2O2 is achieved, by means of a thermochemical two-step cycle, based on CeO2 nanoparticles. The first step (CeO2 thermal reduction) has been implemented with a solar-driven endothermic dissociation of the metal oxide to lower-valence metal-oxide. The second step (CO2 splitting) has been carried out with an exothermic oxidation of the reduced metal-oxide, which is produced in the first step, to form CO. The use of nanoparticles as catalyst allows maximizing the surface area of reaction, and at the same time, the reactor based on double-loop fluidized bed allows continuous operation, without alternating flows of inert sweep gas and CO2. The thermodynamic analysis of the system under investigation showed a calculated maximum ideal efficiency of about 63%.

Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSC) are intensively studied due to their low-cost processing and high light-to-electricity conversion efficiency. However, the difficulty of the large scale fabrication hinders their practical applications, and the structure tuning of the nanomaterials to optimize PSC is still challenging. In this study, we fabricate nanosheet-based PSCs using mesoscopic TiO2 nanosheets (NS) and p-type NiO nanosheets (NS) as electron transport material (ETM) and inorganic hole transport material (HTM), respectively. Furthermore, as the counter electrode (CE), carbon black/graphite can be applied by screen printing process to fabricate PSCs with the TiO2/ZrO2/NiO/carbon (CH3NH3PbI3) structure. The nanosheet-based PSC with printable carbon counter electrode shows a promising conversion efficency of 7.50%, significantly higher than the value of 6.40% of the device using the HTM of NiO nanoparticles (NP). The electrochemical impedance analysis exhibits that NS structured PSC can decrease the electron recombination effectively and enhance the collection of the charge carriers. This research presents a novel nanostructured PSC with printable carbon counter electrode, which is promising for PSC engineering technique and large scale manufacture with low cost.

Abstract: The development of efficient perovskite solar devices fully fabricated in air conditions at low temperature is investigated. A 10.0% average efficiency was achieved for a CH3NH3PbI3 p-i-n planar perovskite solar cell with null hysteresis processed in an environment with relative humidity as high as 70%. This result was enabled by a fine control over the perovskite precursor composition, adapting the solvent engineering process to ambient air conditions and implementing nickel oxide as hole-transporting layer. The presented strategy contributes towards the establishment of processing methodologies leading to scale up high performance perovskite solar cells where processing in ambient air at low temperature is highly desirable.

Abstract: Polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) layers on thin silicon oxide films have received strong research interest as they form excellent carrier selective junctions on crystalline silicon substrates after appropriate thermal processing. Recently, we presented a new method to determine the pinhole density in interfacial oxide films of poly-Si on oxide (POLO)-junctions with excellent electrical properties. The concept of magnification of nanometer-size pinholes in the interfacial oxide by selective etching of the underlying crystalline silicon is used to investigate the influence of annealing temperature on pinhole densities. Eventually, the pinholes are detected by optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. We present results on the pinhole density in POLO-junctions with J0 values as low as 1.4 fA/cm2. The stability of this method is demonstrated by proving that no new holes are introduced to the oxide during the etching procedure for a wide range of etching times. Finally, we show the applicability to multiple oxide types and thickness values, differently doped poly-Si layers as well as several types of wafer surface morphologies. For wet chemically grown oxides, we verified the existence of pinholes with an areal density of 2×107cm−2 even already after annealing at a temperature of 750°C (lower than the optimum annealing temperature for these junctions).

Abstract: A considerable number of patients with advanced gastric cancer have a clear predilection for metastasis to the great omentum, an organ mainly composed of adipose tissue. However, it remains unclear why tumor cells preferentially spread to and progress in the omentum. Here, we used a two-dimensional co-culture system to simulate the crosstalk between adipocytes and gastric cancer cells and showed that after co-culture with isolated omental adipocytes, gastric cancer cells exhibited a significant increase in lipid uptake and enhanced invasiveness. A lipidomic study showed that gastric cancer cells accumulated higher levels of oleic acid during the co-culture. By performing an assay of key enzymes in lipid synthesis, we demonstrated that the increased amount of oleic acid in gastric cancer cells mainly came from the adjacent adipocytes in the co-culture system. Furthermore, our data showed that at a certain concentration range, oleic acid treatment enhanced the invasiveness of gastric cancer cells in vitro and in a CAM assay, through the PI3K/Akt pathway, with the associated increased expression of the key pro-invasion factor MMP-2. Taken together, our results demonstrated that adipocytes may serve as an exogenous source of oleic acid that promotes gastric cancer cell invasion through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

Abstract: Magnesium dititanate MgTi2O5, thin films have been grown on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates using a newly synthesized heterobimetallic single molecular precursor [Mg2Ti4(O)2(OH)4(TFA)8(THF)6]·THF (1) (where TFA=trifluroacetato and THF=tetrahydrofuran) using the aerosol assisted chemical vapor deposition technique (AACVD). The precursor complex (1), isolated in crystalline form by reacting magnesium (II) acetate tertahydrate with titanium (IV) isopropoxide and trifluroacetic acid in THF solution, was characterized by FTIR, single-crystal X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analyses. Thin films prepared at 500, 550 and 600°C were inspected by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission gun-scanning electron microscopic (FESEM), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which demonstrated the development of phase pure orthorhombic porous microspherical objects of MgTi2O5 with precise stoichiometry. The optical analysis showed that MgTi2O5 has a direct band gap of 3.4eV. The photoelectrochemical (PEC) experiments on MgTi2O5 electrodes showed maximum anodic photocurrent density of 400μA/cm2 at 0.7V vs. Ag/AgCl/3M KCl under simulated solar irradiation of AM 1.5G (100mW/cm2) in 1M NaOH. The improved PEC performance of MgTi2O5 electrode was attributed to the increased photo absorption ability, elevated surface area, and more efficient electron/hole transfer which were confirmed by measurements such as linear sweep voltage, transient photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.

Abstract: The effect of crystal orientation of CH3NH3PbI3 on photovoltaic properties has rarely been studied due to the lack of method to fabricate perovskite films with well-controlled crystal orientation in specific direction. Here, we have controlled the orientation of CH3NH3PbI3 crystal by changing organic precursors (CH3NH3I and CH3NH3Cl) and successfully fabricated highly oriented CH3NH3PbI3 crystals with two different orientations to the substrate. When we investigated the effect of crystal orientation on photovoltaic performance using the films with two different crystal orientations, we have realized that the crystal orientation of perovskite is directly related to power conversion efficiency (PCE). The PCE difference due to different crystal orientation is interpreted by the charge transfer lifetime. Faster charge transfer from perovskite layer to charge transport layer exhibits higher JSC and PCE.

Abstract: In a recent work, we studied donor-acceptor blend based organic photovoltaics and, by utilizing a combination of morphology simulations and device modeling, demonstrated that block copolymer compatibilizers with appropriately selected energy levels can be used in such systems to give rise to highly efficient devices that, in some cases, can even outperform idealized morphologies. In the present study, we probe whether morphological simulations can be used in conjunction with simple morphological descriptors as a means to screen the performance characteristics of such energy cascade based ternary blend devices as predicted using device-level simulations. Towards this objective, we present results from different parameter combinations to demonstrate that the domain size, percolation ratio, tortuosity of domains, and concentration gradient at the interface between donors and acceptors correlate strongly with the device performance of such ternary blend systems. Subsequently, we present extensive parameter studies where we simultaneously vary the blend composition, the degree of polymerization of the donor homopolymer, and the acceptor composition of the donor-b-acceptor block copolymer to identify blend formulations that give rise to such optimal morphological and device characteristics. Finally, we demonstrate that, while the overall device performance depends on a combination of morphological factors, the morphological descriptors identified in our work may help identify promising blend formulations.

Abstract: The majority of parabolic trough concentrating solar power plants consist of an indirect system where the heat transfer fluid (typically synthetic oil) exchanges energy with a secondary circuit which is connected to the power cycle. Synthetic oil has a technical limitation by the maximum operating temperature. This results in the search for new fluids. On the other hand, with the aim of having energy when there is no sun shining, it has increased the use of thermal storage. Thermal energy storage systems are composed of molten salts and presents higher operating temperatures than synthetic oil. Thus, direct systems, in which thermal storage and heat transfer fluid are unified and normally molten salts, emerge to improve the power cycle performance. To determine the future potential of direct systems, this paper evaluates the environmental damage of two types of molten salts and synthetic oil in order to decide whether the use of salts is better than synthetic oil, from an environmental point of view by using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) techniques. LCA results showed greater impacts in the synthetic oil case than the molten salts.

Abstract: Nectin-4 is well known as a junction protein. Recent reports have implicated it in cancer, but there has been little exploration of its functional significance in metastasis and cancer stem cells. Here, using the breast cancer metastasis model system, we report Nectin-4 is a marker for breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) and provide experimental evidence suggesting that it utilizes WNT/β-Catenin signaling via Pi3k/Akt axis for self renewal of BCSCs. In vitro, in vivo, ex vivo and clinical pathological data showed upregulated Nectin-4 in breast cancer metastasis and WNT/β-Catenin signaling. Nectin-4 depletion inhibited EMT, metastasis, invasion, and the WNT/β-Catenin pathway; conversely, Nectin-4 overexpression in null cells upregulated EMT and metastasis and also induced WNT/β-Catenin signaling via Pi3k/Akt axis, which in turn, controls cancer stem cell proliferation. Induced Nectin-4 was observed in breast tumor patient samples and in breast tumor metastases to axillary lymph nodes, which indicated that Nectin-4 is not only a BCSC marker but also a breast cancer metastasis marker. The current study provides clear evidence that Nectin-4 is a BCSC marker and is responsible for breast cancer metastasis.

Abstract: The alneal is one of the most effective methods of electrically passivating a silicon surface, and has been used by numerous research groups since the 1980s. In this work, we present an enhanced alneal process that substantially improves its effectiveness. Previously, the success afforded by the standard alneal has been attributed to the chemical passivation provided by hydrogenation of the Si-SiO2 interface. However, the work presented here shows that it is possible to enhance the surface passivation by simultaneously introducing a component of Field Effect Passivation (FEP). Where the standard alneal is seen to provide lifetimes of ~2.1ms, equivalent to a surface recombination velocity (SRV) of 3.3cm/s, the enhanced alneal can provide a lifetime of 5.6ms on 1Ωcm, n-type Si, equivalent to a SRV 0.4cm/s. The charge required for this enhanced passivation can be introduced in the order of minutes and has the potential to be introduced at the same time as the aluminium is deposited, thus, resulting in no extra processing time. Secondary ion mass spectroscopy showed that the nature of the charge is likely to be K and Na cations residing at the Si-SiO2 interface. The possibility of increasing the surface passivation beyond that of the standard alneal points to the importance of both chemical and field effect components of passivation, and is therefore of significant interest to high efficiency silicon solar cell research.

Abstract: Next-generation power systems require higher temperatures to increase the efficiency of electricity production in the power block. Concentrating solar power (CSP) technology is looking for high temperature thermal fluids able to work in the range of 550–750°C. Molten chlorides containing NaCl, KCl, MgCl2, and/or ZnCl2 are being considered for solar receivers and/or sensible- or latent- thermal energy storage systems. Vapor pressures of chlorides are high enough that in combination with oxygen gaseous compounds will produce a harsh atmosphere that is generally very aggressive to common chromia forming alloys. Corrosion mitigations must consider a solution in which both zones (immersed in fluid and exposed to vapor phase) will be protected. This could easily be obtained using alloy surface modification approaches. Surface passivation, produced after pre-oxidation treatments, of alumina forming alloys (Inconel 702, Haynes 224 and Kanthal APMT) was evaluated in molten 35.59wt% MgCl2 – 64.41wt% KCl thermally cycled from 550°C to 700°C in flowing Ar and static zero air (ZA) atmospheres. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests and metallographic characterization showed that the best performing alloy was pre-oxidized In702 in ZA at 1050°C for 4h due to the formation of protective, dense and continuous alumina layers. The alumina layers were unstable when flowing Ar was used as the inert atmosphere during corrosion evaluations. Corrosion results in static ZA are promising for next-generation CSP applications using molten chlorides because alumina scales were stable after 185h of immersion in the oxygen-containing atmosphere. Alumina layers in pre-oxidized Al-FA In702 grew from 5µm (before immersion) to 13µm (after 185h of immersion). The use of these alloys could be commercial feasibility and cost-effective because of the possibility of using oxygen-containing atmospheres instead of keeping enclosed systems with inert atmospheres to protect alloys from corrosion in molten chlorides.

Ligands of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha promote glutamate transporter-1 endocytosis in astrocytes,

Abstract: Astrocytes, a stellate-shape glial population in the central nervous system (CNS), maintain glutamate homeostasis in adult CNS by undergoing glutamate uptake at the synapse through their glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) can be activated by endogenous saturated fatty acids to regulate astrocytic lipid metabolism and functions. However, it is unclear if PPARα can exert the regulatory action on GLT-1 expression in astrocytes. This study showed that treatment with palmitic acid (PA) and the other two PPARα agonists (GW 7647 and WY 14,643) caused no change in the morphology of astrocytes, whereas membranous GLT-1 protein levels in astrocytes were significantly decreased by PA and PPARα agonists. Through lentivirus-mediated overexpression of GLT-1 tagged with red fluorescent protein (GLT-1-RFP), we also observed that GLT-1-RFP puncta in the processes of astrocytes were inhibited by the PPARα agonists. This reduction was prevented by the addition of the PPARα antagonist, GW6471. GLT-1-RFP was co-localized to the early endosome marker–EEA1 in astrocytes treated with the PPARα agonists. Moreover, PPARα-induced inhibition in membranous GLT-1 expression was abolished by the addition of dynamin inhibitor (dynasore). Furthermore, the co-treatment of astrocytes with PPARα agonists and dynasore, or with PPARα agonists and protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor bis-indolylmaleimide 1 (BIS1), prevented the endocytosis of GLT-1-RFP. Based on the results, we conclude that the PPARα agonists increased GLT-1 endocytosis in astrocytes possibly through the PKC signaling pathway. In addition, our findings provide important information of PPARα involvement in the downregulation of astrocytic glutamate uptake via the promoted GLT-1 endocytosis.

Abstract: The defects states and carrier density of CZTSe absorber layers are two of the crucial factors that decide the photovoltaic performance of CZTSe thin film solar cells. Fine tailoring the defects and carrier density is a key to push the power conversion efficiency of CZTSe solar cells to a more competitive level. In this work, the phase properties, defect states, and carrier density of CZTSe thin film are well controlled by fine tuning the ratio of Zn/Sn in the range from 0.75 to 1.27. Capacity-Voltage measurements and Admittance Spectroscopy are used to characterize the carrier density, depletion region width, and defect states of the CZTSe solar cells. The results indicate that the defects states and carrier density of CZTSe layer are very sensitive to the ratio of Zn/Sn. Combining experimental results and numerical simulation, the statistic regularities of the photovoltaic parameters of the CZTSe solar cells with different ratios of Zn/Sn is well explained. The increase of VOC of CZTSe solar cells with the ratio of Zn/Sn is related to both the increased carrier density and the decreased deep level defects states. The decline of JSC of the Zn-rich solar cells is caused by both the shrunken depletion region width and a large barrier caused by ZnSe phase. This barrier is the cause for a low fill factor in the Zn-rich solar cells. Overall, the CZTSe solar cells with a stoichiometric ratio of Zn/Sn=1.02 have favorable defects property and carrier density, thus resulting in the highest photovoltaic efficiency of 10.21%.

Abstract: Objective/background
A decision about the need for antimicrobial therapy in a patient with febrile neutropenia after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is often complicated because of the low frequency of culture isolation and reduced clinical manifestation of infection. Usefulness and choice of sepsis biomarkers to distinguish bloodstream infection (BSI) from other causes of febrile episode is still argued in HSCT recipients in modern epidemiological situations characterized by the emergence of highly resistant gram-negative microorganisms. In this study a comparative analysis of diagnostic values of presepsin, procalcitonin (PCT), and C-reactive protein (CRP) was performed as sepsis biomarkers in adult patients after HSCT in a condition of high prevalence of gram-negative pathogens.
Methods
A prospective observational clinical study was performed at the Center of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation in Minsk, Republic of Belarus. The biomarkers (presepsin, PCT, and CRP) were assessed in a 4-hour period after the onset of febrile neutropenia episode in adult patients after HSCT. Microbiologically-confirmed BSI caused by a gram-negative pathogen was set as a primary outcome.
Results
Clinical and laboratory data were analyzed in 52 neutropenic patients after HSCT aged 18–79years. Out of the biomarkers assessed, the best diagnostic value was shown in presepsin (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.889, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.644–0.987, p<.0001) with 75% sensitivity and 100% specificity, then in PCT (AUC: 0.741, 95% CI: 0.573–0.869, p=.0037) with 62% sensitivity and 88% specificity. The optimal cut-off value for CRP was set as 165mg/L, while it had an average diagnostic value (AUC: 0.707, 95% CI: 0.564–0.825, p=.0049) with low sensitivity (40%) and should not be routinely recommended as a biomarker in adult patients with suspected BSI after HSCT.
Conclusion
Presepsin may be recommended in adult patients with suspected gram-negative BSI after HSCT as a possible additional supplementary test with a cut-off value of 218pg/mL. PCT is inferior to presepsin in terms of sensitivity and specificity, but still shows a good quality of diagnostic value with an optimal cut-off value of 1.5ng/mL. CRP showed an average diagnostic value with low sensitivity (40%) and should not be routinely recommended as a biomarker in adult patients with suspected BSI after HSCT in a condition of high prevalence of gram-negative pathogens.

Abstract: We report improved efficiency of GaInP solar cells by broadband omnidirectional antireflection owing to dielectric composite nanostructures. The dielectric composite nanostructures consisted of a nanopatterned SiO2 layer and its underlying thin films composed of SiO2 and SiNx dielectric layers. The GaInP solar cells decorated with these dielectric composite nanostructures exhibited significant antireflection for wavelengths in the 285–700nm range, for incidence angles up to 60°, compared with those of bare cells and cells with a single antireflection layer (SARL). Accordingly, the photovoltaic performance of our solar cells was significantly better. Short circuit current density (Jsc) of 13.28mA/cm2 and fill factor (FF) of 85.47% were obtained at AM 1.5G for these cells. The short circuit current density was 1.43 and 1.05 times higher than those for the bare cells and for the cells with a SARL, respectively. In the meantime, the fill factor was higher by 12% compared with that for the bare cells, although the improvement relative to the cells with a SARL was only marginal. Further investigation has indicated that these dielectric composite nanostructures effectively suppressed the dark saturation current and their surface passivation effect was stronger than that exhibited by the SARL-decorated GaInP solar cells, for the applied voltage below 1.34V. As a result, conversion efficiency of 15.10% was achieved, which was 5.91% and 1.05% higher than those for the bare and SARL-decorated cells, respectively. Further analysis of the photovoltaic performance of the cells suggested that the improved performance can be attributed to the specific surface treatment, implying that these dielectric composite nanostructures can be truly employed in GaInP solar cells to enhance the conversion efficiency of these cells.

Abstract: Selective emitter diffusion technology has demonstrated a direct PV cell efficiency increase, due to a good ohmic contact and high blue response. These PV devices will be assembled to fabricate the final and commercial PV modules where the power enhancement is the most valuable one. The traditional encapsulant material is ethylene-vinyl-acetate (EVA) which ultraviolet wavelength cut off is placed in the region where selective emitter technology improvement is performed. Photovoltaic industry has developed innovate materials to overcome these issues. Among them, a low ultraviolet cut off EVA can be easily acquired. Our study demonstrates that with the correct PV module encapsulant configuration, part of the developed PV cell efficiency improvement related to selective emitter technology can be successfully translated at the end of the value chain; that is, the final PV module.

Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with a composite mesoporous TiO2–In2O3 electron transport layer were constructed and tested. For the formation of the In2O3 overlayer three different molar concentrations of the precursor indium(III) acetylacetonate were investigated (TiO2–In2O3 (1) 46mM, TiO2–In2O3 (2) 50mM and TiO2–In2O3 (3) 56mM). In2O3 was chosen because of its slightly higher conduction band placement compared with TiO2 which could facilitate the charge transport of the photogenerated electrons from the conduction band edge of the perovskite to the TiO2, reducing the recombination rate. The electron transport films were characterized structurally and morphologically, while the electrical properties of the PSCs with the TiO2–In2O3 bilayer were examined in detail and compared against cells with pristine TiO2. All layers were deposited by the spin coating method and at ambient conditions of temperature and humidity. The structure that was used for the mesostructured PSCs was FTO/c-TiO2/mp-TiO2/(In2O3)/CH3NH3I3−xClx/P3HT/Au. The optimum device performance was observed for PSCs with the TiO2–In2O3 (2) electron layer, having an improved short–circuit current density and open–circuit voltage, with an overall power conversion efficiency of almost 12.9%.

Abstract: The degradation and durability of different selective solar absorbers surfaces in outdoor exposure testing (OET) sites with different atmospheric corrosivity (maritime/industrial and urban atmospheres) were investigated for the optimization of accelerated aging tests to the qualification in terms of durability of selective solar absorber coatings in different environments. Two Outdoor Exposure Testing (OET) sites were constructed, the climate was characterized and the atmospheric corrosivity categories were determined by corrosion rate measurements of standard specimens (carbon steel, zinc, copper and aluminium) during 12 months, according to ISO 9223, ISO 9225 and ISO 9226:2012. Two Physical Vapour Deposition (PVD) coatings (commercially available) and three paint coatings (commercially available) were also exposed in the two OET sites with evaluation of degradation after 1, 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12 months of exposure in terms of optical properties (solar absorptance and thermal emittance), morphology and chemical evaluation (SEM/EDS and XRD). The selective solar absorber surfaces submitted to OET sites for one year were ranked according to their performance in terms of optical properties and corrosion over time. The results obtained show the relevance of outdoor exposure testing sites, namely in places with high corrosivity as in marine and/or industrial areas as a reliable way to verify the corrosion resistance of new materials and products and the evolution of optical properties degradation of absorber surfaces in the presence of high concentration of contaminants.

Abstract: We have synthesized CuInSe2-ZnSe (CZISe) thin films by two-step sequential process and tested its potential for photovoltaic application. The material exhibits a high absorption coefficient (>105cm−1 at wavelength lower than 800nm) and a direct band gap around 1.2eV, being an excellent candidate for absorber in thin film solar cells. The power and temperature dependent photoluminescence properties were similar to chalcopyrite and kesterite type materials. In a first optimization round, we have studied the influence of Cu content on the structural and electrical properties of CZISe. The optimum range of Cu/(Zn+In) ratio was identified that yielded the best performance of solar cells. The champion cell demonstrated an efficiency of 7.6% with an open circuit voltage as high as 520mV, corroborating the possible high interest of this alloy for the development of sustainable, cost-efficient and critical raw materials reduced thin film photovoltaic technologies.

Abstract: A novel ternary hematite (α-Fe2O3)-based nanostructured photoanode with excellent photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance consisting of 2D-electrochemical reduced graphene oxide (eRGO) and nickel oxide (NiO) was successfully developed through electrodeposition synthesis method. Surface morphology studies showed that the flexible eRGO sheets provided intimate and coherent interfaces between α-Fe2O3, NiO, and eRGO that enhanced charge transfer properties and thus, lowering the recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. The incorporation of eRGO and NiO has also endowed α-Fe2O3 nanostructured photoanode with a wider spectral absorption range, where the light absorption intensities in the visible light and near infrared regions were improved. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis further confirmed that the ternary eRGO/NiO/α-Fe2O3 nanostructured photoanode possessed the lowest charge transfer resistance among all as-synthesized photoanodes. This indicates that the combinatorial effects of eRGO and NiO could improve the electron mobility and prolong the recombination process of photogenerated charge carriers that result in enhanced PEC performance. In this instance, the eRGO sheets act as surface passivation layer and electron transporting bridge that increase the electrons transfer at the semiconductor/liquid junction. Whilst NiO serves as hole scavenger that also effectively hinders the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, and provides electron donor centres that accelerate the interfacial charge transfer. Finally, the hydrogen evolution rate from the ternary eRGO/NiO/α-Fe2O3 nanostructured photoanode was measured to be 92μmolh−1cm−2, which was about 3-fold higher than bare α-Fe2O3 nanostructured photoanode. It is expected that the fundamental understanding gained through this study is helpful for the rational design and construction of highly efficient ternary nanostructured heterojunction photoanodes for application in PEC water splitting.

Abstract: Theoretical model and numerical analysis of charge accumulation within a single GaSb quantum dots layer embedded in GaAs-based Schottky diode is performed. We hereby give an analytical calculation of the capacitance–voltage (C–V) characteristic of GaAs-based Schottky barrier structure incorporating GaSb self-assembled quantum dots layer. The Schottky barrier is derived in different bias voltage region based on solving analytically Poisson׳s equation, including the effects of the dots size dispersion and the Fermi statistics of the holes in the quantum dots. The numerical simulation of capacitance–voltage curves exhibits a plateau that is caused by the high carrier concentration and the saturation of the quantum dots levels upon the applied voltage. These results are in good agreement with experiments done by Hwang et al.

Abstract: For CdTe solar cells copper seems to be necessary to achieve best energy conversion efficiencies, whilst it is known to be the main reason of cell performance degradation due to its tendency to diffuse through the bulk. Some studies have shown a direct connection between defect concentration and copper, but little has been discussed about its relation to the CdTe etching. Within this study many samples with Cu/Au back-contact have been prepared with different etching times and tested applying thermal, luminous and electrical stresses. We have analyzed the aging effects on the cell performance and on the nature and concentration of the defects by means of a variety of characterization techniques, like atomic force microscopy, Raman, current-voltage, capacitance-voltage, drive level capacitance profiling and admittance spectroscopies. Results of the accelerated lifetime tests show that different performance degradation is observed for cells with differently etched absorber. Solar cells made with optimized etching have very low degradation while the strongest performance reduction is detected for unetched cells despite their initial efficiency is as high as for the case of etched absorbers.

Abstract: In this paper, we reported a VO2-based thermochromic window using bistratal glasses of TiO2 antireflection coating as well as Al: ZnO/SiO2 coatings, respectively. The thermochromic behavior of VO2 was modulated by TiO2 antireflection layers based on skin comfort design for the first time. The film thickness of TiO2(240nm)/VO2(70nm)/TiO2(10nm)/Glass structure has been optimized based on modulation of 1350 ~ 2500nm solar radiation by calculation. A remarkable improvement in mid-infrared reflectivity was obtained using Al: ZnO with SiO2 layer, and the film thickness has been optimized as SiO2 (~100nm)/Al: ZnO (300nm)/Glass to achieve a suitable integrated luminous transmittance. This two multilayered stacks were combined together with different orders to form a multifunctional window for energy efficient fenestration. This work provides a new insight for structural design of multilayer thin films and serves as starting points for developing novel coatings for windows with superior energy efficiency.

Abstract: High performance, function durability, thermal stability and mechanical robustness have long been pursued for advanced antireflective thin films. In the current work, we developed a novel and effective approach to fabricate mechanically robust, humidity-resistant, thermally stable high-performance antireflective thin films with reinforcing silicon phosphate centers from an acid-catalyzed hybrid silica sol. The thin film has a hierarchically nanoporous structure, resulting in favorable antireflective properties. After being coated with the antireflective thin film, the maximum and average transmittances of K9 glass increase from 92.1% and 92.0% (400–800nm) to 99.7% and 98.8% (400–800nm), respectively. In addition, the thin film shows favorable humidity-resistance and heat-resistance, and these extraordinary performances are attributed to its rich heat-resistant and hydrophobic groups. Moreover, mechanical strength measurements indicate the thin film has extraordinary 5H pencil hardness and 5A adhesion to substrate because of the formation of silicon phosphate centers in the thin film, which significantly reinforce the thin film. These high-performance antireflective thin films are promising in solar energy utilization, especially in solar cells.

Abstract: Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is the receptor for bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) triggering production of pro-inflammatory cytokines which help eradicate the bacteria but could also be harmful when overproduced. The signaling activity of TLR4 is modulated by cholesterol level in cellular membranes, which in turn is affected by bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP), a phospholipid enriched in late endosomes. We found that exogenously added BMP isomers become incorporated into the plasma membrane and intracellular vesicles of macrophages and strongly reduced LPS-stimulated production of a chemokine RANTES, which was correlated with inhibition of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) controlling Rantes expression. To investigate the mechanism underlying the influence of BMP on TLR4 signaling we applied Laurdan and studied the impact of BMP incorporation on lipid packing, a measure for membrane order. Enrichment of model and cellular membranes with BMP significantly reduced their order and the reduction was maintained during stimulation of cells with LPS. This effect of BMP was abolished by enrichment of macrophages with cholesterol. In parallel, the inhibitory effect of BMP exerted on the TLR4-dependent phosphorylation of IRF3 was also reversed. Taken together our results indicate that BMP reduces the order of macrophage membranes which contributes to the inhibition of TLR4-dependent RANTES production.

Abstract: Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) is overexpressed in many cancers and acts as a tumor stem cell marker. Here, we investigated the role of DCLK1 and microRNA-424 (miR-424) in ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC), a histopathologically distinct subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer associated with poor prognosis and chemotherapy resistance. Analysis of samples from 30 OCCC patients showed that DCLK1 was upregulated and miR-424 was downregulated in tumors compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues. DCLK1 overexpression promoted OCCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, whereas DCLK1 knockdown reduced cell viability and invasion and induced growth arrest in vitro and in vivo. Dual-luciferase reporter assays revealed that miR-424 directly targets DCLK1 and downregulates its expression. Transfection of ES-2 cells with miR-424 mimics downregulated DCLK1 and suppressed the effects of DCLK1 overexpression on upregulating matrix metalloprotease-9 and promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Taken together, these data demonstrate that miR-424 has the capacity to suppress cell invasion and EMT in OCCC by downregulating DCLK1, suggesting potential therapeutic targets and strategies for the treatment of this disease.

Abstract: Application-specific requirements for future perovskite solar cells include lightweight, mechanical resilience, and deformability for multi-purpose utilizations ranging from electronic skin and implant in the body to wearable textiles. Here we demonstrate the experimental realization of intrinsically bendable, stretchable, twistable, and compressible perovskite solar cells made by adsorbing hole-transporting polyaniline, solvothermal-processed halide (5-AVA)y(CH3NH3)1−yPbI3 or (5-AVA)y(CH3NH3)1−yPbI3−xClx precursor as well as electron-transporting [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl with three-dimensional amphiphilic gel matrix. The multi-deformable perovskite solar cell with CH3NH3PbI3 crystals yields a power conversion efficiency of 3.62% at undeformed state and AM1.5G sunlight irradiation, while the efficiency can increase to 4.51% at a bending angle of 140°, to 4.46% at an elongation of 220%, to 5.10% at a twist angle of 360°, and to 5.57% at a compression ratio of 80%. After hundreds of arbitrary deformations, the solar cell still remains ~130% efficiency. Owing to an amphiphilic surface, the solar cell is relatively stable for 7 days when exposed in 78%-humidity ambient air. This work represents a significant step forward, as it realizes the solvothermal synthesis of halide CH3NH3PbX3 (X=I, Cl) precursors and low-temperature fabrication, arbitrary deformations without sacrificing power conversion efficiency along with promising humidity-resistance in ambient atmosphere for perovskite solar cells.

Abstract: Leucine serves not only as a substrate for protein synthesis, but also as a signal molecule involved in protein metabolism. However, whether the levels of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), which have damaging effects on cellular DNA, proteins, and lipids, are regulated by leucine is still unclear. Here, we report that leucine supplementation reduces ROS levels in intestinal epithelial cells of weaned piglets. A proteomics analysis revealed that leucine supplementation induces an energy metabolism switch from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) towards glycolysis. The leucine-induced ROS reduction and the energy metabolism switch were further validated in cultured cells. Mechanistically, our data revealed that leucine-induced ROS reduction actually depends on the energy metabolism switch from OXPHOS towards glycolysis through the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)- hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1α) pathway. These findings reveal a vital regulatory role of leucine as the signal molecule involved in an energy metabolism switch in mammals.

Abstract: Recent advances in the performance and stability of lead halide perovskite solar cells announce a promising future for this technology. As the understanding of lab scale device fabrication progresses technology developments in the area of up-scaling are required to demonstrate their viability on an industrial and pre-commercial scale. These developments include replacing slow spin coated deposition techniques with continuous roll to roll compatible slot-die methods. In this work we demonstrate the suitability of a one-step slot-die coating method for the deposition of lead halide perovskite layers, in particular for infiltration into a mesoporous titania scaffold. Appropriate crystallisation dynamics of the perovskite are achieved by careful control of the substrate temperature in combination with a post-processed rapid air knife application. We show that devices fully processed in air using this method deliver a photovoltaic conversion efficiency up to 9.2%, this is comparable to those manufactured using a spin coating process.

Abstract: Between 10% and 30% of commercial cast silicon ingots is discarded due to contamination caused by the casting process. A significant contaminant in the scrap volume is metal precipitates, which are difficult to getter effectively and degrade minority charge carrier lifetime, hence limiting solar cell efficiency potential. We show here that the unusable red zone can be restored in high-performance multicrystalline silicon wafers. Adding a high temperature dissolution anneal prior to phosphorus diffusion dissolves the metal precipitates within the wafer bulk, and leaves the metal point defects in a mobile state to be readily gettered by phosphorus diffusion gettering during the solar cell process. The efficiency of the dissolution gettering treatment increases with increasing temperature, with a temperature of 1150°C eliminating the very low lifetime region of the wafers completely. Additionally, we find that the red zone does not re-emerge after a 60min oxidation anneal at 900°C, confirming that the achieved benefit is tolerant to any high temperature processing following the phosphorus diffusion gettering process.

Abstract: In this study, we are interested by the caesium-tin mixed salt of 1-vanado-11-molybdophosphoric acid (CsSnPMo11VO40) with Cs/Sn ~ 1, micro and mesoporous material with a large specific surface area and a good thermal stability. Caesium atoms in Cs3HPMo11VO40 are partially substituted by tin in order to facilitate the electron transfer in the redox processes. The synthesis and characterization by BET measurement, inductively coupled plasma (ICP), X-ray diffraction (XRD), 31P NMR, thermal analysis (TGA and DTA), UV–Vis and Raman spectroscopies, infrared technique of the Keggin-type compound CsSnPMo11VO40 are reported. The forbidden band (1.72eV) is due to the crystal field splitting of Mo6+: 4d orbital in octahedral site and the compound exhibits a chemical stability at neutral pH and semiconducting properties due to molybdenum mixed valences. The intensity-potential (J-E) characteristic shows a small hysteresis while the capacitance measurement (C−2 - E) of the junction CsSnPMo11VO40/electrolyte in Na2SO4 electrolyte exhibits a rectifying behavior with a Schottky type barrier; the positive slope is characteristic of n type conduction with a flat band potential of −0.30 VSCE. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) shows two overlapped semicircles attributed to the bulk contribution (Rb=168Ωcm2) and grains boundaries (Rgb=806Ωcm2). The depletion angle (−16°) is ascribed to a constant phase element (CPE, 67µFcm−2). The photosensitivity in the visible light involves d–d transition and the energy diagram shows the feasibility of the material for the HCrO4- reduction upon visible light (109mWcm−2). The disappearance rate is found to be 4mmolmn−1 (mg catalyst)−1 and the chromate reduction obeys to a first order kinetic with a half-life of 83mn.

Abstract: Counter electrodes plays a vital role in electron transport in operation of QDSSCs. The lower charge transfer resistance at counter electrode - electrolyte interface fecilitates improvement in photoconversion efficiency. The present study describes a novel and facile Spray Pyrolysis method for fabrication of low cost α-MoO3-Carbon composite (α-MoO3–C) material which is used as counter electrode (CE) in QDSSCs. The QDSSC with TiO2 photoanode sensitized by cadmium sulphide (CdS) QDs and polysulfide as electrolyte and α-MoO3-C composite as counter electrode exhibited solar energy-to-electricity conversion efficiency of 1.29%, which is better than those of the cells that used platinum and Cu2S as counter electrodes. QDSSCs with α-MoO3-C composite used as counter electrode gives stable and reproducible performance. The improvement in efficiency with α-MoO3-C composite Counter electrode was mainly driven by the improvement in photocurrent density and decrease in charge transfer resistance at counter electrode – electrolyte interface. Electrochemical impedence spectroscopy studies are carried out to understand electron transport in the device at various interfaces. α-MoO3-C composite has shown more electrocatalytic response for the reduction of redox species of the polysulfide than platinum and Cu2S.

Abstract: Cancer initiation and progression follow complex changes of cellular architecture and biomechanical property. Cancer cells with more submissive (or “softer”) than their healthy counterparts attributed to the reorganization of the complex cytoskeleton structure, may be considered as a potential anti-tumor therapeutic target. In this study, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was carried out to detect the topographical and biophysical changes of nasopharyngeal carcinoma CNE-2Z cells and normal nasopharyngeal epithelial cells NP69-SV40T by treating the Disulfiram chelated with Cu2+ (DSF-Cu). DSF-Cu induced the apoptotic population, ROS production and decreased the NF-κB-p65 expression of CNE-2Z cells, which was much higher than those of NP69-SV40T cells. DSF-Cu caused the obvious changes of cell morphology and membrane ultrastructure in CNE-2Z cells. The roughness decreased and stiffness increased significantly in CNE-2Z cells, which correlated with the rearrangement of intracellular F-actin, FLNa and α-tubulin structures in CNE-2Z cells. And the adhesion force of CNE-2Z cells was also increased accompanied with the increased E-cadherin expression. However, these results could not be observed in the NP69-SV40T cells even the concentration of DSF reached up to 400nM. Finally, the detection of cell wound scratch assay confirmed DSF-Cu could inhibit the migration of CNE-2Z cells, but no effect on NP69-SV40T cells. These findings demonstrated the selective cytotoxicity of DSF-Cu in CNE-2Z cells may attribute to the different mechanical properties and cytoskeleton rearrangement from the normal nasopharyngeal epithelial cells.

Abstract: The radiation hardness of AlGaAs single-junction solar cells is investigated for various n-i-p solar cell designs. The material composition in both the n-p regions is varied between 3.5% and 16% Al-content, whereas the intrinsic region has a higher Al-content between 3.5% and 23%. The beginning-of-life and end-of-life quantum efficiency and current – voltage characteristics are discussed to establish trends as a function of material bandgap. It is found that, increasing the Al-content of AlGaAs tends to increase the radiation hardness of the solar cells up to an efficiency remaining factor of 85%. This enhancement mostly originates from an improved open circuit voltage remaining factor that is caused by a deterioration of the beginning-of-life performance as the Al-content increases. However, a degradation in photocurrent is observed for increasing Al content in the intrinsic region, which is partially due to minority carrier potential barriers at the base/intrinsic heterointerface. In general, increasing the bandgap of the intrinsic region improves radiation hardness, but the formation of potential barriers for minority carriers must be avoided. The diffusion lengths and damage coefficients are also extracted by modeling the quantum efficiency.

Abstract: This paper presents an original investigation method to highlight the differences of mobilities and transport mechanisms of charge carriers in organic materials solar cells. Two types of polymer: fullerene solar cells were investigated: ITO/ PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM /Al and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PCDTBT:PCBM/Al. The I–V characteristics were done under standard illumination (1000W/m2) using a mask placed at different distances from the collecting cathode position. The influence of the distance between the irradiation area and the position of the collecting electrode on the performances of solar cells was studied. It has been observed that the short-circuit current and the open-circuit voltage considerably increase with the decrease of the distance between the cathode and the irradiation area. This study method gives also the opportunity to find the suitable collecting grid layout (distance between electrodes) depending on the nature of the organic materials. Moreover it can also explain the differences observed between the reported values in literature for the conversion efficiencies of organic solar cells.

Abstract: The fabrication and properties of a Ge-based Kesterite Cu2ZnGeSe4 (CZGSe) solar cell are discussed. The existence of the quaternary compound has been verified by physical methods such as X Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS). The Cu2ZnGeSe4 solar cell has a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.5% under AM1.5G illumination which is among the highest reported for pure Ge substitution. Detailed low temperature current-voltage and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements show that the Cu2ZnGeSe4 absorber has less bulk defects and less band tailing in contrast to the typical characteristics of Cu2ZnSnSe4 devices. These beneficial opto-electronic properties also resulted in a high open circuit voltage (Voc) of 744mV which is amongst the highest values reported for Kesterite materials.

Abstract: Photo-activated processes have been widely recognized as cost-effective and environmentally friendly routes for both renewable energy generation and purification/cleaning technologies. We report herein on a plasma-assisted approach for the synthesis of Fe2O3-TiO2 nanosystems functionalized with Au nanoparticles. Fe2O3 nanostructures were grown by plasma enhanced-chemical vapor deposition, followed by the sequential sputtering of titanium and gold under controlled conditions, and final annealing in air. The target nanosystems were subjected to a thorough multi-technique characterization, in order to elucidate the interrelations between their chemico-physical properties and the processing conditions. Finally, the functional performances were preliminarily investigated in both sunlight-assisted H2O splitting and photocatalytic activity tests in view of self-cleaning applications. The obtained results highlight the possibility of tailoring the system behaviour and candidate the present Fe2O3-TiO2-Au nanosystems as possible multi-functional low-cost platforms for light-activated processes.

Abstract: The colour rendering index (CRI) and correlated colour temperature (CCT) of daylight change upon transmission through a variable transmittance suspended particle device (SPD) switchable glazing. The luminous transmittance of SPD glazing was found to vary from 0.02 to 0.55 in opaque and transparent state respectively. Below 0.14 transmittance, the CRI for a particular SPD glazing was less than 80. No strong correlation was found between CCT and CRI. The CRI of SPD glazing in a transparent state was similar to double panes glazing for SPD glazing transmittance greater than 0.24.

Abstract: A dynamic electrical model is introduced to investigate the hysteretic effects in the J-V characteristics of perovskite based solar cells. By making a simple ansatz for the polarization relaxation, our model is able to reproduce qualitatively and quantitatively detailed features of measured J-V characteristics. Pre-poling effects are discussed, pointing out the differences between initially over- and under-polarized samples. In particular, the presence of the current overshoot observed in the reverse characteristics is correlated with the solar cell pre-conditioning. Furthermore, the dynamic hysteresis is analyzed with respect to changing the bias scan rate, the obtained results being consistent with experimentally reported data: the hysteresis amplitude is maximum at intermediate scan rates, while at very slow and very fast ones it becomes negligible. The effects induced by different relaxation time scales are assessed. The proposed dynamic electrical model offers a comprehensive view of the solar cell operation, being a practical tool for future calibration of tentative microscopic descriptions.

Abstract: High-temperature (>500°C) chlorosilane gas streams are prevalent in the manufacture of polycrystalline silicon, the feedstock for silicon-based solar panels and electronics. This study investigated the influence of metallurgical grade silicon on the corrosion behavior of pure iron in these types of environments. The experiment included exposing pure iron samples at 600°C to a silicon tetrachloride/hydrogen input gas mixture with and without embedding the samples in silicon. The samples in a packed bed of silicon had significantly higher mass gains compared to samples not in a packed bed. Comparison to diffusion studies suggest that the increase in mass gain of embedded samples is due to a higher silicon activity from the gas phase reaction with silicon. The experimental results were supported by chemical equilibrium calculations which showed that more-active trichlorosilane and dichlorosilane species are formed from silicon tetrachloride in silicon packed bed conditions.

Abstract: We report on the fabrication of a 5.2% efficiency Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) solar cell made by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) featuring an ultra-thin absorber layer (less than 450nm). Solutions to the issues of reproducibility and micro-particulate ejection often encountered with PLD are proposed. At the optimal laser fluence, amorphous CZTS precursors with optimal stoichiometry for solar cells are deposited from a single target. Such precursors do not result in detectable segregation of secondary phases after the subsequent annealing step. In the analysis of the solar cell device, we focus on the effects of the finite thickness of the absorber layer. Depletion region width, carrier diffusion length, and optical losses due to incomplete light absorption and back contact reflection are quantified. We conclude that material- and junction quality is comparable to that of thicker state-of-the-art CZTS devices, even though the efficiency is lower due to optical losses.

Abstract: Both Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy enable assessment of the effect of electrical bias on the surface potential of the layers of a solar cell. We report on a comprehensive comparison of surface potential measurements on an interdigitated back contact solar cell using these two techniques. Measurements under different values of electrical biases are performed on and between the metallic contacts. They show a good agreement between the surface potential obtained with Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy and the Scanning Electron Microscopy signal. In order to provide an accurate comparison, the scanned areas are adjacent to each other and accurate repositioning is achieved thanks to a nano-indentation between the contacts. We show that measurements under reverse bias are of interest to locate nano-defects and measurements under forward bias are relevant to identify local series resistance issues. We suggest that a setup combining Scanning Electron Microscopy and Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy under different values of the electrical bias should be valuable since the former is a high throughput technique enabling measurements on large scan areas, while the latter is a quantitative, low noise, and unintrusive local technique.

Abstract: We report on the effects of zinc oxide (ZnO) morphology on the photovoltaic performance of inverted polymer solar cells (PSCs). Three different ZnO layers, fabricated from a sol–gel, nanoparticles (NPs), or nanorods (NRs), were employed as electron-collecting interlayers (ECIs) to compare their electrical, morphological, and optical properties in poly[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-bA]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]-thiophenediyl] (PTB7): [6,6]-phenyl-C70-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM)-based inverted PSCs. The work functions of all the ZnO layers were lower than or similar to the electron affinity of the acceptor, PC70BM, allowing the ZnO-coated indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates to act as efficient electron-collecting electrodes. The ZnO NRs induced not only stronger scattering effects but also more efficient electron collection than those of the devices with ZnO sol‒gel or NP ECIs, resulting in enhanced external quantum efficiency and, consequently, the highest power conversion efficiency (8.38±0.09%) under illumination (AM 1.5G, 100mW/cm2). The optical effects of the ZnO NRs were confirmed by a finite-difference time-domain simulation.

Abstract: Using spray-coating technique, we successfully fabricated conventional ITO-based and inverted ITO-free polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on a conjugated polymer poly[2,3-bis-(3-octyloxyphenyl) quinoxaline-5,8-diyl-alt-thiophene-2,5-diyl] (TQ1) as the donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) or [6,6] -phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the acceptor. Environment-friendly non-halogenated solvents were used to process the active layers. The influence of substrate temperatures and processing solvents on the photovoltaic performance of the ITO-based TQ1:PC61BM PSCs was systemically investigated. A higher substrate temperature can accelerate the solvent evaporating rate and afford a micro-textured rougher surface, which efficiently reduced light reflectance and enhanced absorption. Furthermore, finer phase separation was observed when using this high substrate temperature, which led to enhanced photocurrent due to the reduced bimolecular recombination. The device performance of spray-processed PSCs using the non-halogenated solvent mixtures was comparable to that of spray-processed PSCs using the halogenated o-dichlorobenzene (oDCB), which demonstrates that the non-halogenated solvents are very promising in spray-processed PSCs. This work sheds new light on developing efficient roll-to-roll compatible spray-coated PSCs with environment-friendly solvents.

Abstract: Sugar alcohols (SA) are attractive phase change materials (PCM) for thermal energy storage applications at low-to-medium temperatures (70–180°C). Five pure sugar alcohols (xylitol, adonitol, L-arabitol, erythritol, D-mannitol) and three eutectic blends (eythritol/xylitol, L-arabitol/erythritol, L-arabitol/xylitol) are investigated in this paper. Experimental characterization of such materials as PCMs is provided. This encompasses the measurement of their melting point and latent heat of fusion, as well as the experimental determination of all key physical properties (specific heat, thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity, density, viscosity) as a function of the temperature. The performances of the studied materials are compared to those of most currently used PCMs (paraffin waxes, salt hydrates etc.) in the field of thermal energy storage. The most significant applications, including solar seasonal energy storage, are also discussed.

Abstract: Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) critically contributes to the host defense, and its amount determines the mobilization efficiency of HSF1 under stress conditions. To date, how HSF1 amount is regulated remains largely unknown. We found that methylene blue (MB), an anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory agent, increased the amount of HSF1 in BV-2 microglia, primary microglia, astrocytes, neurons and vital organs. The increased HSF1 contributed to a more increase in nuclear translocation of HSF1, association of HSF1 with heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) promoters and Hsp70 expression levels, and also induced a synergistic protection against oxidative stress-induced injuries in MB and heat shock-treated cells. The MB-induced increase in the amount of HSF1 was not associated with light exposition as well as the change in HSF1 gene transcription or macroautophagy, but associated with the proteasome-ubiquitin system. The acetyltransferase p300 was considered to mediate the effect of MB on HSF1, as p300 inhibition or silencing prevented the increase in HSF1-p300 interaction as well as the amount and acetylation level of HSF1 in MB-treated cells. Moreover, inhibition of protein kinase A α (PKAα) was found to attenuate the MB-induced increase in HSF1 amount and HSF1-p300 interaction. These findings were ascertained in primary microglia, astrocytes and neurons where p300 or PKA inhibition prevented the increase in the amount of HSF1 after MB treatment. Taken together, our results showed that MB increases the amount of HSF1 through promotion of PKA-mediated increase in HSF1-p300 interaction, providing evidence to illustrate a new pharmacological effect of MB in clinical application.

Abstract: A new graphene aerosol hybridized CdO/SnO2 (CdO/SnO2/GA) heterostructure is fabricated for visible photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants. Firstly, CdO/SnO2 heteronanostructure is prepared by solid-state conversion of a nano coordination polymer. Then, the prepared CdO/SnO2 material is hybridized with graphene oxide under hydrothermal condition to get the CdO/SnO2/GA hybrid. The CdO/SnO2/GA hybrid is successfully characterized by powdered X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy and UV–Visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. It is observed that CdO/SnO2/GA exhibits improvement in visible light photocatalytic activity towards degradation of dyes compared to pure CdO/SnO2, GA or earlier reported SnO2/graphene based hybrids. The enhanced photocatalytic activity can be ascribed by synergistic effect of CdO, SnO2 and graphene, and also for higher surface area and porous nature of the graphene aerosol and effective charge separation in the CdO/SnO2/GA. Importantly, graphene and dye are also acting as the co-photosensitizer with CdO/SnO2 absorbing more visible light and enhancing charge separations. Furthermore, the CdO/SnO2/GA hybrid exhibits high photo-stability up to five cycles without any photo-corrosion implying its potential applications for environmental remediation.

Abstract: Angiotensin (Ang) Ⅱ-induced cardiac hypertrophy can deteriorate to heart failure, a leading cause of mortality. Endogenous Cathepsin V (CTSV) has been reported to be cardioprotective against hypertrophy. However, little is known about the effect of exogenous CTSV on cardiac hypertrophy. We used the human cardiomyocytes HCM as a cell model to investigate the effects of exogenous CTSV on Ang Ⅱ-induced cardiac cell hypertrophy. Cell surface area and expression of classical markers of hypertrophy were analyzed. We further explored the mechanism of CTSV cardioprotective by assessing the levels and activities of PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK signaling pathway proteins. We found that pre-treating cardiomyocytes with CTSV could significantly inhibit Ang Ⅱ-induced hypertrophy. The mRNA expression of hypertrophy markers ANP, BNP and β-MHC was obviously elevated in Ang Ⅱ-treated cardiac cells. Whereas, exogenous CTSV effectively halted this elevation. Further study revealed that the protective effects of exogenous CTSV might be mediated by repressing the phosphorylation of proteins in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK pathways. Based on our results, we concluded that exogenous CTSV inhibited Ang Ⅱ-induced hypertrophy in HCM cells by inhibiting PI3K/Akt/mTOR. This study provides experimental evidence for the application of CTSV protein for the treatment of cardiac hypertrophy.

Abstract: In this project we examined how the presence of human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs) modifies (supports or inhibits) colorectal and pancreatic cancer cell progression in mice peritoneal cavity. Experiments were performed using primary, omentum-derived HPMCs, commercially available colorectal (SW-480) and pancreatic (PSN-1) cancer cells, and immunocompromised SCID mice. Tumor growth within the peritoneal cavity was monitored using bioluminescence. Adhesion of the cancer cells to HPMCs was examined using a fluorescence-based method, while the incidence of apoptosis was quantified using flow cytometry. Experiments showed that SW480 and PSN-1 cells formed tumors in vivo at higher efficiency when they were injected alone than in the presence of HPMCs. In vitro investigations confirmed that firm adhesion of SW480 and PSN-1 cells to HPMCs is mediated by interactions between ICAM-1 and CD43. They also revealed that IL-6 and TNFα up-regulate the expression of cell-bound ICAM-1 and the secretion of soluble ICAM-1 (sICAM-1). The basal release of sICAM-1 by HPMCs positively correlated with the expression of the cell-bound molecule. sICAM-1 inhibited dose-dependently the adhesion of SW480 and PSN-1 cells to HPMCs. Cancer cells that did not adhere to HPMCs displayed increased activity of caspase-3 and -9, increased incidence of apoptosis, and an inability to re-adhesion, as compared with their intact counterparts not exposed to sICAM-1. Our findings indicate that under certain conditions HPMCs are capable of inhibiting growth of gastrointestinal tumors in a mechanism involving the anti-adhesive capabilities of sICAM-1.

Distribution of isoforms of ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR) in cyanobacteria in two growth conditions,

Abstract: Ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR) transfers reducing equivalents between ferredoxin and NADP(H) in the photosynthetic electron transport chains of chloroplasts and cyanobacteria. In most cyanobacteria, FNR is coded by a single petH gene. The structure of FNR in photosynthetic organisms can be constituted by FAD-binding and NADPH-binding domains (FNR-2D), or by these and an additional N-terminal domain (FNR-3D). In this article, biochemical evidence is provided supporting the induction of FNR-2D by iron or combined nitrogen deficiency in the cyanobacteria Synechocystis PCC 6803 and Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413. In cell extracts of these cyanobacteria, most of FNR was associated to phycobilisomes (PBS) or phycocyanin (PC), and the rest was found as free enzyme. Free FNR activity increased in both cyanobacteria under iron stress and during diazotrophic conditions in A. variabilis. Characterization of FNR from both cyanobacteria showed that the PBS-associated enzyme was FNR-3D and the free enzyme was mostly a FNR-2D isoform. Predominant isoforms in heterocysts of A. variabilis were FNR-2D; where its N-terminal sequence lacked an initial (formyl)methionine. This means that FNR-3D is targeted to thylakoid membrane, and anchored to PBS, and FNR-2D is found as a soluble protein in the cytoplasm, when iron or fixed nitrogen deficiencies prevail in the environment. Moreover, given that Synechocystis and Anabaena variabilis are dissimilar in genotype, phenotype and ecology, the presence of these two-domain proteins in these species suggests that the mechanism of FNR induction is common among cyanobacteria regardless of their habitat and morphotype.

Abstract: This article reviews the state of the art and historical development of thermophotovoltaic (TPV) energy conversion along with that of the main competing technologies, i.e. Stirling, Brayton, thermoelectrics, and thermionics, in the field of space power generation. Main advantages of TPV are the high efficiency, the absence of moving parts, and the fact that it directly generates DC power. The main drawbacks are the unproven reliability and the low rejection temperature, which makes necessary the use of relatively large radiators. This limits the usefulness of TPV to small/medium power applications (100We-class) that includes radioisotope (RTPV) and small solar thermal (STPV) generators. In this article, next generation TPV concepts are also revisited in order to explore their potential in future space power applications. Among them, multiband TPV cells are found to be the most promising in the short term because of their higher conversion efficiencies at lower emitter temperatures; thus significantly reducing the amount of rejected heat and the required radiator mass.

Abstract: 4-pirydone-3-carboxamide-1β-d-ribonucleoside (4PYR) is an endogenous nucleoside that could be converted to triphosphates, diphosphates, monophosphates and an analogue of NAD − 4PYRAD. Elevated level of these compounds have been reported in chronic renal failure, cancer and active HIV infection. However, little is known about the effect on cell functionality and the metabolic pathways. This study tested effects of 4PYR in different cell types on nucleotide, energy metabolism and clarified enzymes that are involved in conversions of 4PYR. We have found that human neuroblastoma cells, human malignant melanoma cells, human adipose-derived stem cells, human bone marrow-derived stem cells, human dermal microvascular endothelial cells and human embryonic kidney cells, were capable to convert 4PYR into its derivatives. This was associated with deterioration of cellular energetics. Incubation with 4PYR did not affect mitochondrial function, but decreased glycolytic rate (as measured by extracellular acidification) in endothelial cells. Silencing of adenosine kinase, cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase II and nicotinamide nucleotide adenylyltransferase 3, blocked metabolism of 4PYR. Incubation of endothelial cells with 4PYR decreased AMP deaminase activity by 40%. The main finding of this paper is that human cells (including cancer type) are capable of metabolizing 4PYR that lead to deterioration of energy metabolism, possibly as the consequence of inhibition of glycolysis. This study, it was also found that several enzymes of nucleotide metabolism could also contribute to the 4PYRconversions

Abstract: Self-absorption in luminophores is considered a major obstacle on the way towards efficient luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs). It is commonly expected that upon increasing luminophore concentration in an LSC the absorption of the luminophores increases as well and therefore self-absorption losses will have higher impact on the performance of the device. In this work we construct a fully functioning liquid phase LSC where the luminophore concentration can be altered without changing other conditions in the experimental set-up. We step-wise enlarge the concentration of the luminophores Lumogen Red 305 and Lumogen Orange 240, while monitoring the electrical output and self-absorption effects. Contrary to common belief, self-absorption does not increasingly limit the performance of LSCs when the luminophore concentration increases.
