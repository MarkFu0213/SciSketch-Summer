Abstract: The present study was conducted to investigate localization and function of TRPV2 channel in a mouse macrophage cell line, TtT/M87. We infected an adenovirus vector encoding TRPV2 tagged with c-Myc in the extracellular domain. Immunoreactivity of c-Myc epitope exposed to the cell surface formed a ring structure, which was colocalized with markers of the podosome, namely β-integrin, paxillin and Pyk2. The ring structure was also observed in TRPV2-GFP-expressing cells using total internal reflection fluorescent microscopy. Addition of formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) increased the number of podosome and increased the intensity of the TRPV2 signal associated with the podosome. Measurement of subplasmalenmal free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]pm) revealed that [Ca2+]pm was elevated around the podosome. fMLP further increased [Ca2+]pm in this region, which was abolished by a TRPV2 inhibitor ruthenium red. Phosphorylated Pyk2 was detected in fMLP-treated cells, and knockdown of TRPV2 reduced the expression of phospho-Pyk2. Introduction of dominant-negative Pyk2 or knockdown of TRPV2 increased the number of podosome. Conversely, elevation of [Ca2+]pm by the addition of ionomycin reduced the number of podosome. These results indicate that TRPV2 is localized abundantly in the podosome and increases [Ca2+]pm by the podosome. The elevation of [Ca2+]pm is critical to regulate assembly of the podosome.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatic glucose production (HGP) is crucial for glucose homeostasis, but the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Here, we show that a calcium-sensing enzyme, CaMKII, is activated in a calcium- and IP3R-dependent manner by cAMP and glucagon in primary hepatocytes and by glucagon and fasting in vivo. Genetic deficiency or inhibition of CaMKII blocks nuclear translocation of FoxO1 by affecting its phosphorylation, impairs fasting- and glucagon/cAMP-induced glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, and lowers blood glucose levels, while constitutively active CaMKII has the opposite effects. Importantly, the suppressive effect of CaMKII deficiency on glucose metabolism is abrogated by transduction with constitutively nuclear FoxO1, indicating that the effect of CaMKII deficiency requires nuclear exclusion of FoxO1. This same pathway is also involved in excessive HGP in the setting of obesity. These results reveal a calcium-mediated signaling pathway involved in FoxO1 nuclear localization and hepatic glucose homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
The von Hippel-Lindau tumor-suppressor gene (VHL) is lost in most clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC). Here, using human ccRCC specimens, VHL-deficient cells, and xenograft models, we show that miR-204 is a VHL-regulated tumor suppressor acting by inhibiting macroautophagy, with MAP1LC3B (LC3B) as a direct and functional target. Of note, higher tumor grade of human ccRCC was correlated with a concomitant decrease in miR-204 and increase in LC3B levels, indicating that LC3B-mediated macroautophagy is necessary for RCC progression. VHL, in addition to inducing endogenous miR-204, triggered the expression of LC3C, an HIF-regulated LC3B paralog, that suppressed tumor growth. These data reveal a function of VHL as a tumor-suppressing regulator of autophagic programs.

Abstract: Summary
The hypoxia inducible transcription factors (HIFs) control many mediators of vascular response, including both angiogenic factors and small molecules such as nitric oxide (NO). In studying how endothelial HIF response itself affects metastasis, we found that loss of HIF-1α in endothelial cells reduces NO synthesis, retards tumor cell migration through endothelial layers, and restricts tumor cell metastasis, and that loss of HIF-2α has in each case the opposite effect. This results from differential regulation of NO homeostasis that in turn regulates vascular endothelial growth factor expression in an NO-dependent feedback loop. These opposing roles for the two HIF factors indicate that both they and endothelial cells regulate metastasis as malignancy progresses.

Abstract: Summary
Cell-type-specific control of gene expression is critical for the development of multicellular organisms. To investigate the mechanisms which underlie this, we have studied the regulation of the model genes Mdc and Il12b, whose stimulus-induced expression is tightly restricted to specific cells of the immune system. Surprisingly, we find that neither the promoter nor the enhancer sequences of these genes are sufficient to direct this cell-type specificity. Instead, the activities of upstream enhancers are repressed in nonexpressing cells by high levels of trimethylated H3K9 in their flanking regions. Genome-wide analysis indicates that this manner of regulation is shared by numerous enhancers of cell-type-specific genes. In dendritic cells and macrophages, the stimulus-induced demethylase Jmjd2d controls H3K9me3 levels at these regions, and is thereby required for Mdc and Il12b transcription. By experimentally assaying multiple enhancers in a variety of cell types, we show that regulation by H3K9me3 is a widely used mechanism which imparts specificity to the activities of otherwise broadly functional enhancers.

Abstract: Summary
Proper assembly of kinetochores (KTs) during mitosis is required for bipolar attachment of spindle microtubules (MTs) and the accumulation of spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) components. Here we show that testis-expressed protein 14 (Tex14), which has been implicated in midbody function, is recruited to KTs by Plk1 in a Cdk1-dependent manner during early mitosis. Exclusion of Tex14 from kinetochores results in an inability to efficiently localize outer KT components, impaired KT-MT attachment, chromosome congression defects, and whole-chromosome instability. In addition, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of Tex14 by Plk1 during metaphase promotes APCCdc20-mediated Tex14 degradation. Inhibition of this phosphorylation event causes retention of Tex14 at KTs and results in delayed metaphase-to-anaphase transition and chromosome segregation defects. Our findings identify Tex14 as an important mediator of KT structure and function and the fidelity of chromosome separation.

Abstract: Summary
The evolution of the brain and behavior are coupled puzzles. The genetic bases for brain evolution are widely debated, yet whether newly evolved genes impact the evolution of the brain and behavior is vaguely understood. Here, we show that during recent evolution in Drosophila, new genes have frequently acquired neuronal expression, particularly in the mushroom bodies. Evolutionary signatures combined with expression profiling showed that natural selection influenced the evolution of young genes expressed in the brain, notably in mushroom bodies. Case analyses showed that two young retrogenes are expressed in the olfactory circuit and facilitate foraging behavior. Comparative behavioral analysis revealed divergence in foraging behavior between species. Our data suggest that during adaptive evolution, new genes gain expression in specific brain structures and evolve new functions in neural circuits, which might contribute to the phenotypic evolution of animal behavior.

Abstract: Summary
Some of the most serious diseases involve altered size and structure of the arterial wall. Elucidating how arterial walls are built could aid understanding of these diseases, but little is known about how concentric layers of muscle cells and the outer adventitial layer are assembled and patterned around endothelial tubes. Using histochemical, clonal, and genetic analysis in mice, here we show that the pulmonary artery wall is constructed radially, from the inside out, by two separate but coordinated processes. One is sequential induction of successive cell layers from surrounding mesenchyme. The other is controlled invasion of outer layers by inner layer cells through developmentally regulated cell reorientation and radial migration. We propose that a radial signal gradient controls these processes and provide evidence that PDGF-B and at least one other signal contribute. Modulation of such radial signaling pathways may underlie vessel-specific differences and pathological changes in arterial wall size and structure.

Abstract: Summary
The ubiquitin-proteasome system targets many cellular proteins for degradation and thereby controls most cellular processes. Although it is well established that proteasome inhibition is lethal, the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here, we show that proteasome inhibition results in a lethal amino acid shortage. In yeast, mammalian cells, and flies, the deleterious consequences of proteasome inhibition are rescued by amino acid supplementation. In all three systems, this rescuing effect occurs without noticeable changes in the levels of proteasome substrates. In mammalian cells, the amino acid scarcity resulting from proteasome inhibition is the signal that causes induction of both the integrated stress response and autophagy, in an unsuccessful attempt to replenish the pool of intracellular amino acids. These results reveal that cells can tolerate protein waste, but not the amino acid scarcity resulting from proteasome inhibition.

Abstract: Summary
A balance between Six2-dependent self-renewal and canonical Wnt signaling-directed commitment regulates mammalian nephrogenesis. Intersectional studies using chromatin immunoprecipitation and transcriptional profiling identified direct target genes shared by each pathway within nephron progenitors. Wnt4 and Fgf8 are essential for progenitor commitment; cis-regulatory modules flanking each gene are cobound by Six2 and β-catenin and are dependent on conserved Lef/Tcf binding sites for activity. In vitro and in vivo analyses suggest that Six2 and Lef/Tcf factors form a regulatory complex that promotes progenitor maintenance while entry of β-catenin into this complex promotes nephrogenesis. Alternative transcriptional responses associated with Six2 and β-catenin cobinding events occur through non-Lef/Tcf DNA binding mechanisms, highlighting the regulatory complexity downstream of Wnt signaling in the developing mammalian kidney.

Abstract: The high capacity, low affinity Ca2+ storage protein chromogranins are marker proteins of secretory granules that contain the most Ca2+ in secretory cells. Along with the abundantly expressed chromogranins, the IP3R/Ca2+ channels, the major intracellular Ca2+ channels, are also expressed in secretory granules the most. Chromogranins not only induce formation of secretory granules but also are suggested to produce the small IP3-sensitive nucleoplasmic Ca2+ store vesicles in the nucleus. Chromogranins A (CGA) and B (CGB) also directly bind the IP3Rs and activate the IP3R/Ca2+ channels at the intragranular pH 5.5. But at a near physiological pH 7.5 only CGB interacts with the IP3Rs due to stronger interaction of CGB for the IP3Rs, which is several orders of magnitude stronger than that of CGA, and activates the IP3R/Ca2+ channels. Therefore, the CGB-IP3R coupling is proposed to play key roles in the IP3-mediated Ca2+ signaling mechanisms in the cytoplasm through both secretory granules and the ER, and in the nucleus through the small IP3-sensitive nucleoplasmic Ca2+ store vesicles. Chromogranin B is further suggested to participate in transcription control and to target secretory granule components, including the IP3Rs, to newly formed secretory granules. Defects in secretory granule-related functions are directly linked to major human diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, secretory cell cancers, cystic fibrosis, acute pancreatitis, and cardiac hypertrophy. Therefore, realization of secretory granules as the major intracellular Ca2+ storage and control organelle in secretory cells promises to open new horizon in understanding the Ca2+ storage, signaling, and control mechanisms throughout the biokingdom.

Abstract: The cell line RIRI-PX1 was established from neonate larval tissues of Papilio xuthus by performing primary cultures in the modified Grace medium that was supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The cell line primarily consisted of spindle-shaped and spherical cells which attached themselves to the flask. The population-doubling times (PDTs) at the 50th and 60th passage were 42.5h and 42.1h respectively. The average chromosome numbers of RIRI-PX1 cell line from passage 5 to passage 50 ranged from 103 to 199. It was confirmed that RIRI-PX1 cell line was derived from P. xuthus by comparing the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (COI) of RIRI-PX1 cells and P. xuthus eggs. This cell line was susceptible to the Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcNPV) and produced high yield of polyhedral occlusion bodies (43.9OBs/cell) after 10 days of infection by AcNPV. The virus titer of AcNPV infected RIRI-PX1 cells was 3.25×107TCID50/ml. We concluded that the RIRI-PX1 cell line is established from the neonate larvae tissues successfully and the cells of the cell line are sensitive to AcNPV.

Abstract: Summary
Adipose tissue secretes adipokines that mediate insulin resistance, a characteristic feature of obesity and type 2 diabetes. By differential proteome analysis of cellular models of insulin resistance, we identified progranulin (PGRN) as an adipokine induced by TNF-α and dexamethasone. PGRN in blood and adipose tissues was markedly increased in obese mouse models and was normalized with treatment of pioglitazone, an insulin-sensitizing agent. Ablation of PGRN (Grn−/−) prevented mice from high fat diet (HFD)-induced insulin resistance, adipocyte hypertrophy, and obesity. Grn deficiency blocked elevation of IL-6, an inflammatory cytokine, induced by HFD in blood and adipose tissues. Insulin resistance induced by chronic administration of PGRN was suppressed by neutralizing IL-6 in vivo. Thus, PGRN is a key adipokine that mediates HFD-induced insulin resistance and obesity through production of IL-6 in adipose tissue, and may be a promising therapeutic target for obesity.

Abstract: Summary
Ferroportin is the primary means of cellular iron efflux and a key component of iron metabolism. Hepcidin regulates Fpn activity by inducing its internalization and degradation. The mechanism of internalization is reported to require JAK2 activation, phosphorylation of Fpn tyrosine residues 302 and 303, and initiation of transcription through STAT3 phosphorylation. These findings suggest Fpn may be a target for therapeutic intervention through JAK2 modulation. To evaluate the proposed mechanism, Fpn internalization was assessed using several techniques combined with reagents that specifically recognized cell-surface Fpn. In vitro results demonstrated that Hepc-induced Fpn internalization did not require JAK2 or phosphorylation of Fpn residues 302 and 303, nor did it induce JAK-STAT signaling. In vivo, inhibition of JAK2 had no effect on Hepc-induced hypoferremia. However, internalization was delayed by mutation of two Fpn lysine residues that may be targets of ubiquitination.

Abstract: Summary
Specialized somatosensory neurons detect temperatures ranging from pleasantly cool or warm to burning hot and painful (nociceptive). The precise temperature ranges sensed by thermally sensitive neurons is determined by tissue-specific expression of ion channels of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family. We show here that in Drosophila, TRPA1 is required for the sensing of nociceptive heat. We identify two previously unidentified protein isoforms of dTRPA1, named dTRPA1-C and dTRPA1-D, that explain this requirement. A dTRPA1-C/D reporter was exclusively expressed in nociceptors, and dTRPA1-C rescued thermal nociception phenotypes when restored to mutant nociceptors. However, surprisingly, we find that dTRPA1-C is not a direct heat sensor. Alternative splicing generates at least four isoforms of dTRPA1. Our analysis of these isoforms reveals a 37-amino-acid-long intracellular region (encoded by a single exon) that is critical for dTRPA1 temperature responses. The identification of these amino acids opens the door to a biophysical understanding of a molecular thermosensor.

Abstract: Regenerative endodontics aims to preserve, repair or regenerate the dental pulp tissue. Dental pulp stem cells, have a potential use in dental tissue generation. However, specific requirements to drive the dental tissue generation are still obscured. We established an in vivo model for studying the survival of dental pulp cells (DPC) and their potential to generate dental pulp tissue. DPC were mixed with collagen scaffold with or without slow release bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP-4) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2). The cell suspension was transplanted into a vascularized tissue engineering chamber in the rat groin. Tissue constructs were harvested after 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks and processed for histomorphological and immunohistochemical analysis. After 2 weeks newly formed tissue with new blood vessel formation were observed inside the chamber. DPC were found around dentin, particularly around the vascular pedicle and also close to the gelatin microspheres. Cell survival, was confirmed up to 8 weeks after transplantation. Dentin Sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) positive matrix production was detected in the chamber, indicating functionality of dental pulp progenitor cells. This study demonstrates the potential of our tissue engineering model to study rat dental pulp cells and their behavior in dental pulp regeneration, for future development of an alternative treatment using these techniques.

Abstract: Summary
We characterized leukemia stem cells (LSC) in chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) using a transgenic mouse model. LSC were restricted to cells with long-term hematopoietic stem cell (LTHSC) phenotype. CML LTHSC demonstrated reduced homing and retention in the bone marrow (BM), related to decreased CXCL12 expression in CML BM, resulting from increased G-CSF production by leukemia cells. Altered cytokine expression in CML BM was associated with selective impairment of normal LTHSC growth and a growth advantage to CML LTHSC. Imatinib (IM) treatment partially corrected abnormalities in cytokine levels and LTHSC growth. These results were validated using human CML samples and provide improved understanding of microenvironmental regulation of normal and leukemic LTHSC and their response to IM in CML.

Abstract: The eSMT rat is a new spontaneous model of type 2 diabetes that develops a progressive diabetic syndrome with a stronger incidence in males than in females. We decide to investigate the progression of the pancreatic histopathological changes during the lifespan of the eSMT rat, especially those associated with islet cell populations. Besides that, some plasmatic parameters were evaluated in order to correlate them with the morphological findings. Male eSMT and Sprague-Dawley control rats were used. The results showed a dramatic decrease of the volume density (VD) of endocrine tissue in the eSMT rats without evidence of insulitis. Islets became fragmented structures with strong presence of interstitial fibrosis. Consequently, plasma insulin levels showed a significant decrease, while plasma glucose, cholesterol and triglyceride levels were increased. Normal rats showed no significant changes in the VD of endocrine tissue, except for the older animals, where the VD of β-cell population was increased. Early derangements observed in islets, together with the progressive decrease of endocrine tissue and the metabolic disorders described, would be responsible for an irreversible pathologic condition which avoids the animal survival beyond about 18 months of age. However, there is still a need to investigate the causes of endocrine tissue decrease and its possible association with an inflammatory process that it could be associated with the development and progression of fibrosis.

Abstract: Summary
The notion that decapping leads irreversibly to messenger RNA (mRNA) decay was contradicted by the identification of capped transcripts missing portions of their 5′ ends and a cytoplasmic complex that can restore the cap on uncapped mRNAs. In this study, we used accumulation of uncapped transcripts in cells inhibited for cytoplasmic capping to identify the targets of this pathway. Inhibition of cytoplasmic capping results in the destabilization of some transcripts and the redistribution of others from polysomes to nontranslating messenger ribonucleoproteins, where they accumulate in an uncapped state. Only a portion of the mRNA transcriptome is affected by cytoplasmic capping, and its targets encode proteins involved in nucleotide binding, RNA and protein localization, and the mitotic cell cycle. The 3′ untranslated regions of recapping targets are enriched for AU-rich elements and microRNA binding sites, both of which function in cap-dependent mRNA silencing. These findings identify a cyclical process of decapping and recapping that we term cap homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is the most prevalent esophageal cancer type in the United States. The TNF-α/mTOR pathway is known to mediate the development of EAC. Additionally, aberrant activation of Gli1, downstream effector of the Hedgehog (HH) pathway, has been observed in EAC. In this study, we found that an activated mTOR/S6K1 pathway promotes Gli1 transcriptional activity and oncogenic function through S6K1-mediated Gli1 phosphorylation at Ser84, which releases Gli1 from its endogenous inhibitor, SuFu. Moreover, elimination of S6K1 activation by an mTOR pathway inhibitor enhances the killing effects of the HH pathway inhibitor. Together, our results established a crosstalk between the mTOR/S6K1 and HH pathways, which provides a mechanism for SMO-independent Gli1 activation and also a rationale for combination therapy for EAC.

Abstract: Summary
Basal-like breast cancers (BLBC) express a luminal progenitor gene signature. Notch receptor signaling promotes luminal cell fate specification in the mammary gland, while suppressing stem cell self-renewal. Here we show that deletion of Lfng, a sugar transferase that prevents Notch activation by Jagged ligands, enhances stem/progenitor cell proliferation. Mammary-specific deletion of Lfng induces basal-like and claudin-low tumors with accumulation of Notch intracellular domain fragments, increased expression of proliferation-associated Notch targets, amplification of the Met/Caveolin locus, and elevated Met and Igf-1R signaling. Human BL breast tumors, commonly associated with JAGGED expression, elevated MET signaling, and CAVEOLIN accumulation, express low levels of LFNG. Thus, reduced LFNG expression facilitates JAG/NOTCH luminal progenitor signaling and cooperates with MET/CAVEOLIN basal-type signaling to promote BLBC.

Abstract: After the discovery of molecules modulating G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are able to selectively affect one signaling pathway over others for a specific GPCR, thereby “biasing” the signaling, it has become obvious that the original model of GPCRs existing in either an “on” or “off” conformation is too simple. The current explanation for this biased agonism is that GPCRs can adopt multiple active conformations stabilized by different molecules, and that each conformation affects intracellular signaling in a different way. In the present study we sought to investigate biased agonism of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), by looking at 12 well-known orthosteric CaSR agonists in 3 different CaSR signaling pathways: Gq/11 protein, Gi/o protein, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). Here we show that apart from Gq/11 and Gi/o signaling, ERK1/2 is activated through recruitment of β-arrestins. Next, by measuring activity of all three signaling pathways we found that barium, spermine, neomycin, and tobramycin act as biased agonist in terms of efficacy and/or potency. Finally, polyamines and aminoglycosides in general were biased in their potencies toward ERK1/2 signaling. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that several active conformations of CaSR, stabilized by different molecules, exist, which affect intracellular signaling distinctly.

Abstract: BCG-activated macrophages (BAM) could kill the tumor cells through cell-cell contact. In this process membrane proteins play an important role. However, up to date, few membrane proteins were revealed. In this study, we selected a surface molecule named Trim59, which was specifically expressed on BAM membrane (compared with the negative control). We cloned and prokaryoticly expressed the extracellular domain of Trim59, purified the recombinant protein and generated polyclonal antibodies. Immunohistochemistry showed that Trim59 abundantly expressed in spleen, stomach and ovary; intermediately expressed in brain, lung, kidney, muscle and intestine; but not in thymus, liver, heart, uterus. Using the antibodies to block Trim59 on BAM significantly reduced BAM cytotoxicity against MCA207 cells. This demonstrated that Trim59 serves as an indispensable molecule in maintaining BAM activity. Overexpression of Trim59 in Raw264.7 cell line failed to lyse target MCA207 cells, which potentiated Trim59 per se could not enhance macrophage cytotoxicity; on another hand, overexpression of Trim59 enhance the pinocytosis and Phagocytosis activity of Raw-264.7, which imply Trim59 might mediate the cell-molecule interaction. Our results indicate Trim59 might be an essential accessory molecule in mediating BAM tumoricidal functions; and Trim59 is a phagocytosis-correlated molecule.

Abstract: Mitochondria possess a sophisticated array of Ca2+ transport systems reflecting their key role in physiological Ca2+ homeostasis. With the exception of most yeast strains, energized organelles are endowed with a very fast and efficient mechanism for Ca2+ uptake, the ruthenium red (RR)-sensitive mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU); and one main mechanism for Ca2+ release, the RR-insensitive 3Na+–Ca2+ antiporter. An additional mechanism for Ca2+ release is provided by a Na+ and RR-insensitive release mechanism, the putative 3H+–Ca2+ antiporter. A potential kinetic imbalance is present, however, because the Vmax of the MCU is of the order of 1400nmol Ca2+mg−1 proteinmin−1 while the combined Vmax of the efflux pathways is about 20nmol Ca2+mg−1 proteinmin−1. This arrangement exposes mitochondria to the hazards of Ca2+ overload when the rate of Ca2+ uptake exceeds that of the combined efflux pathways, e.g. for sharp increases of cytosolic [Ca2+]. In this short review we discuss the hypothesis that transient opening of the Ca2+-dependent permeability transition pore may provide mitocondria with a fast Ca2+ release channel preventing Ca2+ overload. We also address the relevance of a mitochondrial Ca2+ release channel recently discovered in Drosophila melanogaster, which possesses intermediate features between the permeability transition pore of yeast and mammals.

Abstract: The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is the original model synapse, and while others have emerged, especially as models of plasticity involving coincidence detectors, the NMJ continues to provide useful new information. It remains, for example, one of the best understood synapses in terms of the relationship between structure and function. In particular, the advent of new tools for fluorescence imaging has allowed the processes of vesicle exocytosis, endocytosis, and receptor activation to be spatially mapped in considerable detail. Here, we will focus on the spatial properties of transmitter release at the presynaptic motor terminal at the mouse NMJ. The preparation offers several experimental advantages, such as easy accessibility, a nearly planar, unobstructed view of several hundred square microns of synaptic membrane, as well as a highly stereotyped, consistent structure of a fully differentiated adult mammalian synapse.

Abstract: Summary
Both mitochondria, which are metabolic powerhouses, and telomeres, which help maintain genomic stability, have been implicated in cancer and aging. However, the signaling events that connect these two cellular structures remain poorly understood. Here, we report that the canonical telomeric protein TIN2 is also a regulator of metabolism. TIN2 is recruited to telomeres and associates with multiple telomere regulators including TPP1. TPP1 interacts with TIN2 N terminus, which contains overlapping mitochondrial and telomeric targeting sequences, and controls TIN2 localization. We have found that TIN2 is posttranslationally processed in mitochondria and regulates mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Reducing TIN2 expression by RNAi knockdown inhibited glycolysis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and enhanced ATP levels and oxygen consumption in cancer cells. These results suggest a link between telomeric proteins and metabolic control, providing an additional mechanism by which telomeric proteins regulate cancer and aging.

Abstract: Dehydration-responsive element-binding proteins (DREBs) regulate plant responses to environmental stresses. In the current study, transcription of DREB2C, a class 2 Arabidopsis DREB, was induced by a superoxide anion propagator, methyl viologen (MV). The oxidative stress tolerance of DREB2C-overexpressing transgenic plants was significantly greater than that of wild-type plants, as measured by ion leakage and chlorophyll fluorescence under light conditions. The transcriptional activity of several ascorbate peroxidase (APX) genes as well as APX protein activity was induced in DREB2C overexpressors. Additionally, the level of H2O2 in the overexpressors was lower than in wt plants under similar oxidative stress conditions. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay and transient activatorreporter assay showed that APX2 expression was regulated by heat shock factor A3 (HsfA3) and that HsfA3 is regulated at the transcriptional level by DREB2C. These results suggest that DREB2C plays an important role in promoting oxidative stress tolerance in Arabidopsis.

Abstract: Summary
Translational control depends on phosphorylation of eIF2α by PKR-like ER kinase (PERK). To examine the role of PERK in cognitive function, we selectively disrupted PERK expression in the adult mouse forebrain. In the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of PERK-deficient mice, eIF2α phosphorylation and ATF4 expression were diminished and were associated with enhanced behavioral perseveration, decreased prepulse inhibition, reduced fear extinction, and impaired behavioral flexibility. Treatment with the glycine transporter inhibitor SSR504734 normalized eIF2α phosphorylation, ATF4 expression, and behavioral flexibility in PERK-deficient mice. Moreover, the expression levels of PERK and ATF4 were reduced in the frontal cortex of human patients with schizophrenia. Together, our findings reveal that PERK plays a critical role in information processing and cognitive function and that modulation of eIF2α phosphorylation and ATF4 expression may represent an effective strategy for treating behavioral inflexibility associated with several neurological disorders such as schizophrenia.

Abstract: Summary
One of the unique characteristics of cellular signaling pathways is that a common signaling pathway can selectively regulate multiple cellular functions of a hormone; however, this selective downstream control through a common signaling pathway is poorly understood. Here we show that the insulin-dependent AKT pathway uses temporal patterns multiplexing for selective regulation of downstream molecules. Pulse and sustained insulin stimulations were simultaneously encoded into transient and sustained AKT phosphorylation, respectively. The downstream molecules, including ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) selectively decoded transient, sustained, and both transient and sustained AKT phosphorylation, respectively. Selective downstream decoding is mediated by the molecules' network structures and kinetics. Our results demonstrate that the AKT pathway can multiplex distinct patterns of blood insulin, such as pulse-like additional and sustained-like basal secretions, and the downstream molecules selectively decode secretion patterns of insulin.

Abstract: Summary
Recent studies underscore the importance of myeloid cells in rendering distant organs hospitable for disseminating tumor cells to colonize. However, what enables myeloid cells to have an apparently superior capacity to colonize distant organs is unclear. Here, we show that S1PR1-STAT3 upregulation in tumor cells induces factors that activate S1PR1-STAT3 in various cells in premetastatic sites, leading to premetastatic niche formation. Targeting either S1PR1 or STAT3 in myeloid cells disrupts existing premetastatic niches. S1PR1-STAT3 pathway enables myeloid cells to intravasate, prime the distant organ microenvironment and mediate sustained proliferation and survival of their own and other stromal cells at future metastatic sites. Analyzing tumor-free lymph nodes from cancer patients shows elevated myeloid infiltrates, STAT3 activity, and increased survival signal.

Abstract: Summary
Although the genomic pattern of nucleosome positioning is broadly conserved, quantitative aspects vary over evolutionary timescales. We identify the cis and trans determinants of nucleosome positioning using a functional evolutionary approach involving S. cerevisiae strains containing large genomic regions from other yeast species. In a foreign species, nucleosome depletion at promoters is maintained over poly(dA:dT) tracts, whereas internucleosome spacing and all other aspects of nucleosome positioning tested are not. Interestingly, the locations of the +1 nucleosome and RNA start sites shift in concert. Strikingly, in a foreign species, nucleosome-depleted regions occur fortuitously in coding regions, and they often act as promoters that are associated with a positioned nucleosome array linked to the length of the transcription unit. We suggest a three-step model in which nucleosome remodelers, general transcription factors, and the transcriptional elongation machinery are primarily involved in generating the nucleosome positioning pattern in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
High-throughput sequencing has allowed for unprecedented detail in gene expression analyses, yet its efficient application to single cells is challenged by the small starting amounts of RNA. We have developed CEL-Seq, a method for overcoming this limitation by barcoding and pooling samples before linearly amplifying mRNA with the use of one round of in vitro transcription. We show that CEL-Seq gives more reproducible, linear, and sensitive results than a PCR-based amplification method. We demonstrate the power of this method by studying early C. elegans embryonic development at single-cell resolution. Differential distribution of transcripts between sister cells is seen as early as the two-cell stage embryo, and zygotic expression in the somatic cell lineages is enriched for transcription factors. The robust transcriptome quantifications enabled by CEL-Seq will be useful for transcriptomic analyses of complex tissues containing populations of diverse cell types.

Abstract: Summary
Detection of foreign materials is the first step of successful immune responses. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) was shown to directly bind cyclic diguanylate monophosphate (c-di-GMP), a bacterial second messenger, and to elicit strong interferon responses. Here we elucidate the structural features of the cytosolic c-di-GMP binding domain (CBD) of STING and its complex with c-di-GMP. The CBD exhibits an α + β fold and is a dimer in the crystal and in solution. Surprisingly, one c-di-GMP molecule binds to the central crevice of a STING dimer, using a series of stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions. We show that STING is autoinhibited by an intramolecular interaction between the CBD and the C-terminal tail (CTT) and that c-di-GMP releases STING from this autoinhibition by displacing the CTT. The structures provide a remarkable example of pathogen-host interactions in which a unique microbial molecule directly engages the innate immune system.

Abstract: Summary
Skeletal muscle growth and regeneration rely on myogenic progenitor and satellite cells, the stem cells of postnatal muscle. Elimination of Notch signals during mouse development results in premature differentiation of myogenic progenitors and formation of very small muscle groups. Here we show that this drastic effect is rescued by mutation of the muscle differentiation factor MyoD. However, rescued myogenic progenitors do not assume a satellite cell position and contribute poorly to myofiber growth. The disrupted homing is due to a deficit in basal lamina assembly around emerging satellite cells and to their impaired adhesion to myofibers. On a molecular level, emerging satellite cells deregulate the expression of basal lamina components and adhesion molecules like integrin α7, collagen XVIIIα1, Megf10, and Mcam. We conclude that Notch signals control homing of satellite cells, stimulating them to contribute to their own microenvironment and to adhere to myofibers.

Abstract: Summary
Fbw7 is the substrate recognition component of the Skp1-Cullin-F-box (SCF)-type E3 ligase complex and a well-characterized tumor suppressor that targets numerous oncoproteins for destruction. Genomic deletion or mutation of FBW7 has been frequently found in various types of human cancers; however, little is known about the upstream signaling pathway(s) governing Fbw7 stability and cellular functions. Here we report that Fbw7 protein destruction and tumor suppressor function are negatively regulated by the prolyl isomerase Pin1. Pin1 interacts with Fbw7 in a phoshorylation-dependent manner and promotes Fbw7 self-ubiquitination and protein degradation by disrupting Fbw7 dimerization. Consequently, overexpressing Pin1 reduces Fbw7 abundance and suppresses Fbw7's ability to inhibit proliferation and transformation. By contrast, depletion of Pin1 in cancer cells leads to elevated Fbw7 expression, which subsequently reduces Mcl-1 abundance, sensitizing cancer cells to Taxol. Thus, Pin1-mediated inhibition of Fbw7 contributes to oncogenesis, and Pin1 may be a promising drug target for anticancer therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Interactions between epithelial cells are mediated by adherens junctions that are dynamically regulated during development. Here we show that the turnover of β-catenin is increased at cell interfaces that are targeted for disassembly during Drosophila axis elongation. The Abl tyrosine kinase is concentrated at specific planar junctions and is necessary for polarized β-catenin localization and dynamics. abl mutant embryos have decreased β-catenin turnover at shrinking edges, and these defects are accompanied by a reduction in multicellular rosette formation and axis elongation. Abl promotes β-catenin phosphorylation on the conserved tyrosine 667 and expression of an unphosphorylatable β-catenin mutant recapitulates the defects of abl mutants. Notably, a phosphomimetic β-cateninY667E mutation is sufficient to increase β-catenin turnover and rescue axis elongation in abl deficient embryos. These results demonstrate that the asymmetrically localized Abl tyrosine kinase directs planar polarized junctional remodeling during Drosophila axis elongation through the tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin.

The CDK Subunit CKS2 Counteracts CKS1 to Control Cyclin A/CDK2 Activity in Maintaining Replicative Fidelity and Neurodevelopment,

Abstract: Summary
CKS proteins are evolutionarily conserved cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) subunits whose functions are incompletely understood. Mammals have two CKS proteins. CKS1 acts as a cofactor to the ubiquitin ligase complex SCFSKP2 to promote degradation of CDK inhibitors, such as p27. Little is known about the role of the closely related CKS2. Using a Cks2−/− knockout mouse model, we show that CKS2 counteracts CKS1 and stabilizes p27. Unopposed CKS1 activity in Cks2−/− cells leads to loss of p27. The resulting unrestricted cyclin A/CDK2 activity is accompanied by shortening of the cell cycle, increased replication fork velocity, and DNA damage. In vivo, Cks2−/− cortical progenitor cells are limited in their capacity to differentiate into mature neurons, a phenotype akin to animals lacking p27. We propose that the balance between CKS2 and CKS1 modulates p27 degradation, and with it cyclin A/CDK2 activity, to safeguard replicative fidelity and control neuronal differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. Patients whose tumors exhibit overexpression or amplification of the MYC oncogene (c-MYC) usually have an extremely poor prognosis, but there are no animal models of this subtype of the disease. Here, we show that cerebellar stem cells expressing Myc and mutant Trp53 (p53) generate aggressive tumors following orthotopic transplantation. These tumors consist of large, pleiomorphic cells and resemble human MYC-driven MB at a molecular level. Notably, antagonists of PI3K/mTOR signaling, but not Hedgehog signaling, inhibit growth of tumor cells. These findings suggest that cerebellar stem cells can give rise to MYC-driven MB and identify a novel model that can be used to test therapies for this devastating disease.

Abstract: Summary
NAD(P)H oxidase has been shown to be important in the development of salt-sensitive hypertension. Here, we show that the expression of a subunit of NAD(P)H oxidase, p67phox, was increased in response to a high-salt diet in the outer renal medulla of the Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rat, an animal model for human salt-sensitive hypertension. The higher expression of p67phox, not the other subunits observed, was associated with higher NAD(P)H oxidase activity and salt sensitivity in SS rats compared with a salt-resistant strain. Genetic mutations of the SS allele of p67phox were found in the promoter region and contributed to higher promoter activity than that of the salt-resistant strain. To verify the importance of p67phox, we disrupted p67phox in SS rats using zinc-finger nucleases. These rats exhibited a significant reduction of salt-sensitive hypertension and renal medullary oxidative stress and injury. p67phox could represent a target for salt-sensitive hypertension therapy.

Abstract: Local Ca2+ signaling requires proper targeting of the Ca2+ signaling toolkit to specific cellular locales. Different isoforms of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump (PMCA) are responsible for Ca2+ extrusion at the apical and basolateral membrane of polarized epithelial cells, but the mechanisms and signals for differential targeting of the PMCAs are not well understood. Recent work demonstrated that the alternatively spliced w-insert in PMCA2 directs this pump to the apical membrane. We now show that inserting the w-insert into the corresponding location of the PMCA4 isoform confers apical targeting to this normally basolateral pump. Mutation of a di-leucine motif in the C-tail thought to be important for basolateral targeting did not enhance apical localization of the chimeric PMCA4(2w)/b. In contrast, replacing the C-terminal Val residue by Leu to optimize the PDZ ligand site for interaction with the scaffolding protein NHERF2 enhanced the apical localization of PMCA4(2w)/b, but not of PMCA4x/b. Functional studies showed that both apical PMCA4(2w)/b and basolateral PMCA4x/b handled ATP-induced Ca2+ signals with similar kinetics, suggesting that isoform-specific functional characteristics are retained irrespective of membrane targeting. Our results demonstrate that the alternatively spliced w-insert provides autonomous apical targeting information in the PMCA without altering its functional characteristics.

Abstract: Chromatophores show significant changes during healing of skin wounds in Labeo rohita (Common Name – Rohu). Wound area can be divided into regions I, II and III. After infliction of wound, skin colour becomes significantly dark by 2h that is gradually restored by 2d. In regions II and III at 5min, epidermal melanophores appear with beaded dendrites. In these regions at 2h and in region I at 6h, epidermal melanophores appear small, rounded or irregular shaped having dendritic processes with aggregated melanosomes. Subsequently, melanophores appear having elongated dendrites with dispersed or aggregated melanosomes. At 24h, clusters of pigmented bodies appear in regions I and II. These bodies increase up to 2d, and then diminish gradually and disappear by 8d. Changes in dermal melanophores in region II at 5min indicate the onset of degeneration. Degenerating melanophores increase up to 12h, then gradually decline, and disappear by 4d. Simultaneously, stellate melanophore reappear, gradually increase and appear like control by 8d. Dermal melanophores in region III at different intervals appear stellate. In region I stellate dermal melanophores appear at 4d. Stellate melanophores in all regions show different distribution of dispersed or aggregated melanosomes. With the appearance of dermal melanophores, highly refractive, crystalline structures, possibly the refractive platelets of the iridophores, are visualized around them. At subsequent intervals, these are frequently observed. This study provides interesting insights in injury induced changes in chromatophores in fish. The findings could be considered useful in perception of intriguing features in the development of pigment research in future.

Abstract: Summary
As they enter mitosis, animal cells undergo profound actin-dependent changes in shape to become round. Here we identify the Cdk1 substrate, Ect2, as a central regulator of mitotic rounding, thus uncovering a link between the cell-cycle machinery that drives mitotic entry and its accompanying actin remodeling. Ect2 is a RhoGEF that plays a well-established role in formation of the actomyosin contractile ring at mitotic exit, through the local activation of RhoA. We find that Ect2 first becomes active in prophase, when it is exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, activating RhoA to induce the formation of a mechanically stiff and rounded metaphase cortex. Then, at anaphase, binding to RacGAP1 at the spindle midzone repositions Ect2 to induce local actomyosin ring formation. Ect2 localization therefore defines the stage-specific changes in actin cortex organization critical for accurate cell division.

Abstract: Summary
The proepicardial organ is an important transient structure that contributes cells to various cardiac lineages. However, its contribution to the coronary endothelium has been disputed, with conflicting data arising in chick and mouse. Here we resolve this conflict by identifying two proepicardial markers, Scleraxis (Scx) and Semaphorin3D (Sema3D), that genetically delineate heretofore uncharacterized proepicardial subcompartments. In contrast to previously fate-mapped Tbx18/WT-1-expressing cells that give rise to vascular smooth muscle, Scx- and Sema3D-expressing proepicardial cells give rise to coronary vascular endothelium both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, Sema3D+ and Scx+ proepicardial cells contribute to the early sinus venosus and cardiac endocardium, respectively, two tissues linked to vascular endothelial formation at later stages. Taken together, our studies demonstrate that the proepicardial organ is a molecularly compartmentalized structure, reconciling prior chick and mouse data and providing a more complete understanding of the progenitor populations that establish the coronary vascular endothelium.

Abstract: Nutrient restriction (NR) prolongs longevity via enhanced mitochondrial function. We tested the hypothesis that NR enhances resistance to ischemia/reperfusion (IR) arrhythmias via preserved calcium (Ca) cycling and mitochondrial function. We examined the protective effects of NR on regional IR in cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocyte monolayers. Optical mapping of intracellular Ca and mitochondrial membrane potential Δψm was performed using Rhod 2-AM and TMRE, respectively. Regional ischemia was mimicked by covering a portion of monolayer with a glass coverslip until loss of Ca propagation, and reperfusion was mimicked by removing the coverslip. NR was mimicked by culture in serum- and glucose-free medium for 24h. Relative to controls, NR monolayers: (1) sustained Ca oscillations during longer periods of ischemia (19.2±1.8min vs 10.4±1.4min, p<0.001); (2) had attenuated increases in Ca transient duration (CaD) and time decay constant (Tau) during ischemia; (3) had preserved conduction velocity (CV) during early reperfusion, leading to protection against reperfusion arrhythmias; (4) had minimal “rebound” decreased CaD and Tau during reperfusion; and (5) had no depolarization of Δψm during IR. NR attenuates IR arrhythmias via (1) stable calcium cycling and (2) prevention of Δψm depolarization during IR. Enhanced mitochondrial resistance to IR arrhythmias may play a role in NR-induced longevity prolongation.

Abstract: Summary
Neonatal survival in mammals is crucially dependent upon maintenance of body temperature. Neonatal body temperature is largely maintained by thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT). BAT develops perinatally in mice requiring integration of adipogenic and thermoregulatory gene pathways. We describe a regulatory mutation in the imprinted gene cluster on mouse chromosome 12 resulting in early postnatal lethality. Maternal inheritance of this mutation impairs the ability of young mice to maintain body temperature. While mechanisms of perinatal BAT development are well understood, our work highlights a second phase of BAT recruitment necessary to support small animals newly independent of the nest. We show that the imprinted delta-like homolog 1/preadipocyte factor (Dlk1/Pref1) and iodothyronine deiodinase type 3 (Dio3) functions converge on the development of brown fat at the transition to independent life. This shows that appropriate dosage control at imprinted loci can act as a critical determinant in postnatal survival during phases of physiological adaptation.

Abstract: Summary
MLN4924 is an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) in clinical trials for the treatment of cancer. MLN4924 is a mechanism-based inhibitor, with enzyme inhibition occurring through the formation of a tight-binding NEDD8-MLN4924 adduct. In cell and xenograft models of cancer, we identified treatment-emergent heterozygous mutations in the adenosine triphosphate binding pocket and NEDD8-binding cleft of NAEβ as the primary mechanism of resistance to MLN4924. Biochemical analyses of NAEβ mutants revealed slower rates of adduct formation and reduced adduct affinity for the mutant enzymes. A compound with tighter binding properties was able to potently inhibit mutant enzymes in cells. These data provide rationales for patient selection and the development of next-generation NAE inhibitors designed to overcome treatment-emergent NAEβ mutations.

Abstract: Odontoblasts are involved in the transduction of stimuli applied to exposed dentin. Although expression of thermo/mechano/osmo-sensitive transient receptor potential (TRP) channels has been demonstrated, the properties of TRP vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)-mediated signaling remain to be clarified. We investigated physiological and pharmacological properties of TRPV1 and its functional coupling with cannabinoid (CB) receptors and Na+–Ca2+ exchangers (NCXs) in odontoblasts. Anandamide (AEA), capsaicin (CAP), resiniferatoxin (RF) or low-pH evoked Ca2+ influx. This influx was inhibited by capsazepine (CPZ). Delay in time-to-activation of TRPV1 channels was observed between application of AEA or CAP and increase in [Ca2+]i. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, however, an immediate increase in [Ca2+]i was observed on administration of extracellular Ca2+, followed by activation of TRPV1 channels. Intracellular application of CAP elicited inward current via opening of TRPV1 channels faster than extracellular application. With extracellular RF application, no time delay was observed in either increase in [Ca2+]i or inward current, indicating that agonist binding sites are located on both extra- and intracellular domains. KB-R7943, an NCX inhibitor, yielded an increase in the decay time constant during TRPV1-mediated Ca2+ entry. Increase in [Ca2+]i by CB receptor agonist, 2-arachidonylglycerol, was inhibited by CB1 receptor antagonist or CPZ, as well as by adenylyl cyclase inhibitor. These results showed that TRPV1-mediated Ca2+ entry functionally couples with CB1 receptor activation via cAMP signaling. Increased [Ca2+]i by TRPV1 activation was extruded by NCXs. Taken together, this suggests that cAMP-mediated CB1-TRPV1 crosstalk and TRPV1-NCX coupling play an important role in driving cellular functions following transduction of external stimuli to odontoblasts.

Abstract: Because micronutrients in human diets ultimately come from plant sources, malnutrition of essential minerals is a significant public health concern. By increasing the expression of nicotianamine synthase (NAS), we fortified the level of bioavailable iron in rice seeds. Activation of iron deficiency-inducible OsNAS2 resulted in a rise in Fe content (3.0-fold) in mature seeds. Its ectopic expression also increased that content. Enhanced expression led to higher tolerance of Fe deficiency and better growth under elevated pH. Mice fed with OsNAS2-D1 seeds recovered more rapidly from anemia, indicating that bioavailable Fe contents were improved by this increase in OsNAS2 expression.

Abstract: Summary
Endothelial cells (ECs) form cell-cell adhesive junctional structures maintaining vascular integrity. This barrier is dynamically regulated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor signaling. We created an inducible knockin mouse model to study the contribution of the integrin-associated focal adhesion tyrosine kinase (FAK) signaling on vascular function. Here we show that genetic or pharmacological FAK inhibition in ECs prevents VEGF-stimulated permeability downstream of VEGF receptor or Src tyrosine kinase activation in vivo. VEGF promotes tension-independent FAK activation, rapid FAK localization to cell-cell junctions, binding of the FAK FERM domain to the vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) cytoplasmic tail, and direct FAK phosphorylation of β-catenin at tyrosine-142 (Y142) facilitating VE-cadherin-β-catenin dissociation and EC junctional breakdown. Kinase inhibited FAK is in a closed conformation that prevents VE-cadherin association and limits VEGF-stimulated β-catenin Y142 phosphorylation. Our studies establish a role for FAK as an essential signaling switch within ECs regulating adherens junction dynamics.

Abstract: Summary
The Mis18 complex has been identified as a critical factor for the centromeric localization of a histone H3 variant, centromeric protein A (CENP-A), which is responsible for the specification of centromere identity in the chromosome. However, the functional role of Mis18 complex is largely unknown. Here, we generated Mis18α conditional knockout mice and found that Mis18α deficiency resulted in lethality at early embryonic stage with severe defects in chromosome segregation caused by mislocalization of CENP-A. Further, we demonstrate Mis18α's crucial role for epigenetic regulation of centromeric chromatin by reinforcing centromeric localization of DNMT3A/3B. Mis18α interacts with DNMT3A/3B, and this interaction is critical for maintaining DNA methylation and hence regulating epigenetic states of centromeric chromatin. Mis18α deficiency led to reduced DNA methylation, altered histone modifications, and uncontrolled noncoding transcripts in centromere region by decreased DNMT3A/3B enrichment. Together, our findings uncover the functional mechanism of Mis18α and its pivotal role in mammalian cell cycle.

Abstract: Summary
Allostery and covalent modification are major means of fast-acting metabolic regulation. Their relative roles in responding to environmental changes remain, however, unclear. Here we examine this issue, using as a case study the rapid decrease in pyruvate kinase flux in yeast upon glucose removal. The main pyruvate kinase isozyme (Cdc19) is phosphorylated in response to environmental cues. It also exhibits positively cooperative (ultrasensitive) allosteric activation by fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). Glucose removal causes accumulation of Cdc19’s substrate, phosphoenolpyruvate. This response is retained in strains with altered protein-kinase-A or AMP-activated-protein-kinase activity or with CDC19 carrying mutated phosphorylation sites. In contrast, yeast engineered with a CDC19 point mutation that ablates FBP-based regulation fail to accumulate phosphoenolpyruvate. They also fail to grow on ethanol and slowly resume growth upon glucose upshift. Thus, while yeast pyruvate kinase is covalently modified in response to glucose availability, its activity is controlled almost exclusively by ultrasensitive allostery.

Abstract: Potato virus X (PVX) contains five viral proteins as well as cŕs-acting elements like stem-loop 1 (SL1) RNAs at the 5’ region. SL1 RNAs are involved in PVX RNA replication, encapsidation, translation, and cell-to-cell movement. In this study, we performed two-dimensional electrophoresis Northwestern blot analysis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry and identified 24 tobacco proteins that interact with SL1 RNAs. Interestingly, one-third of the identified host proteins have been shown to interact with many plant viral proteins. In addition, we demonstrated that PVX capsid protein can bind to both SL1(+/-) RNAs. We further selected three Nicotiana benthamiana proteins including NbMPB2Cb, NbMBF1, and NbCPIP2a, to confirm results of Northwestern blot analysis. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that NbMPB2Cb and NbMBF1 bind to both SL1(+/-) RNAs in vitro. In contrast, NbCPIP2a interacts only SL1(+) RNA. Taken together, we provide a list of host proteins interacting with PVX SL1 RNAs, which would be good candidates for the study of viral RNA-host protein interaction.

Abstract: DEC1 is a transcription repressor that is induced by Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-α/β (HIF-α/β). In this study, we found that either hypoxic treatment or ectopic expression of DEC1 blocks induction of a master adipogenic transactivator, peroxisome proliferative activated receptor-γ2 (PPARγ2) in 3T3-L1 cells. DEC1 did not prevent C/EBPβ, which is an upstream transactivator for PPARγ2, from occupying the PPARγ2 promoter. DEC1 occupied the PPARγ2 promoter by interacting with DNA-bound C/EBPβ. DEC1 occupancy was accompanied by a reduction of acetylated histones and an increase in histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) occupancy on the PPARγ2 promoter. Based on the fact that DEC1 interacts with HDAC1, this study suggests that DEC1 blocks adipogenesis by reinforcing HDAC1 recruitment to the PPARγ2 promoter. This study implies that DEC1 is one of the mediators that reset the pattern of PPARγ2 expression in response to hypoxia.

Abstract: Summary
Microglia are the resident phagocytes of the brain that are responsible for the clearance of injured neurons, an essential step in subsequent tissue regeneration. How death signals are controlled both in space and time to attract these cells toward the site of injury is a topic of great interest. To this aim, we have used the optically transparent zebrafish larval brain and identified rapidly propagating Ca2+ waves that determine the range of microglial responses to neuronal cell death. We show that while Ca2+-mediated microglial responses require ATP, the spreading of intercellular Ca2+ waves is ATP independent. Finally, we identify glutamate as a potent inducer of Ca2+-transmitted microglial attraction. Thus, this real-time analysis reveals the existence of a mechanism controlling microglial targeted migration to neuronal injuries that is initiated by glutamate and proceeds across the brain in the form of a Ca2+ wave.

Abstract: Summary
It is a long-held paradigm that cell fusion reprograms gene expression but the extent of reprogramming and whether it is affected by the cell types employed remain unknown. We recently showed that the silencing of somatic genes is attributable to either trans-acting cellular environment or cis-acting chromatin context. Here, we examine how trans- versus cis-silenced genes in a somatic cell type behave in fusions to another somatic cell type or to embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We demonstrate that while reprogramming of trans-silenced somatic genes occurs in both cases, reprogramming of cis-silenced somatic genes occurs only in somatic-ESC fusions. Importantly, ESCs reprogram the somatic genome in two distinct phases: trans-reprogramming occurs rapidly, independent of DNA replication, whereas cis-reprogramming occurs with slow kinetics requiring DNA replication. We also show that pluripotency genes Oct4 and Nanog are cis-silenced in somatic cells. We conclude that cis-reprogramming capacity is a fundamental feature distinguishing ESCs from somatic cells.

Abstract: Summary
Cells constantly adjust their metabolism in response to environmental conditions, yet major mechanisms underlying survival remain poorly understood. We discover a posttranscriptional mechanism that integrates starvation response with GTP homeostasis to allow survival, enacted by the nucleotide (p)ppGpp, a key player in bacterial stress response and persistence. We reveal that (p)ppGpp activates global metabolic changes upon starvation, allowing survival by regulating GTP. Combining metabolomics with biochemical demonstrations, we find that (p)ppGpp directly inhibits the activities of multiple GTP biosynthesis enzymes. This inhibition results in robust and rapid GTP regulation in Bacillus subtilis, which we demonstrate is essential to maintaining GTP levels within a range that supports viability even in the absence of starvation. Correspondingly, without (p)ppGpp, gross GTP dysregulation occurs, revealing a vital housekeeping function of (p)ppGpp; in fact, loss of (p)ppGpp results in death from rising GTP, a severe and previously unknown consequence of GTP dysfunction.

Abstract: Summary
The heterogeneous nature of mammalian PRC1 complexes has hindered our understanding of their biological functions. Here, we present a comprehensive proteomic and genomic analysis that uncovered six major groups of PRC1 complexes, each containing a distinct PCGF subunit, a RING1A/B ubiquitin ligase, and a unique set of associated polypeptides. These PRC1 complexes differ in their genomic localization, and only a small subset colocalize with H3K27me3. Further biochemical dissection revealed that the six PCGF-RING1A/B combinations form multiple complexes through association with RYBP or its homolog YAF2, which prevents the incorporation of other canonical PRC1 subunits, such as CBX, PHC, and SCM. Although both RYBP/YAF2- and CBX/PHC/SCM-containing complexes compact chromatin, only RYBP stimulates the activity of RING1B toward H2AK119ub1, suggesting a central role in PRC1 function. Knockdown of RYBP in embryonic stem cells compromised their ability to form embryoid bodies, likely because of defects in cell proliferation and maintenance of H2AK119ub1 levels.

Abstract: Summary
We and others previously identified NKX2-1, also known as TITF1 and TTF-1, as a lineage-survival oncogene in lung adenocarcinomas. Here we show that NKX2-1 induces the expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1), which in turn sustains a favorable balance between prosurvival PI3K-AKT and pro-apoptotic p38 signaling, in part through ROR1 kinase-dependent c-Src activation, as well as kinase activity-independent sustainment of the EGFR-ERBB3 association, ERBB3 phosphorylation, and consequential PI3K activation. Notably, ROR1 knockdown effectively inhibited lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, irrespective of their EGFR status, including those with resistance to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib. Our findings thus identify ROR1 as an “Achilles' heel” in lung adenocarcinoma, warranting future development of therapeutic strategies for this devastating cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the principles governing mammalian gene regulation has been hampered by the difficulty in measuring in vivo binding dynamics of large numbers of transcription factors (TF) to DNA. Here, we develop a high-throughput Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation (HT-ChIP) method to systematically map protein-DNA interactions. HT-ChIP was applied to define the dynamics of DNA binding by 25 TFs and 4 chromatin marks at 4 time-points following pathogen stimulus of dendritic cells. Analyzing over 180,000 TF-DNA interactions we find that TFs vary substantially in their temporal binding landscapes. This data suggests a model for transcription regulation whereby TF networks are hierarchically organized into cell differentiation factors, factors that bind targets prior to stimulus to prime them for induction, and factors that regulate specific gene programs. Overlaying HT-ChIP data on gene-expression dynamics shows that many TF-DNA interactions are established prior to the stimuli, predominantly at immediate-early genes, and identified specific TF ensembles that coordinately regulate gene-induction.

Abstract: Summary
Orientation of cell division is a vital aspect of tissue morphogenesis and growth. Asymmetric divisions generate cell fate diversity and epithelial stratification, whereas symmetric divisions contribute to tissue growth, spreading, and elongation. Here, we describe a mechanism for positioning the spindle in symmetric cell divisions of an embryonic epithelium. We show that during the early stages of epiboly, spindles in the epithelium display dynamic behavior within the plane of the epithelium but are kept firmly within this plane to give a symmetric division. This dynamic stability relies on balancing counteracting forces: an apically directed force exerted by F-actin/myosin-2 via active cortical flow and a basally directed force mediated by microtubules and myosin-10. When both forces are disrupted, spindle orientation deviates from the epithelial plane, and epithelial surface is reduced. We propose that this dynamic mechanism maintains symmetric divisions while allowing the quick adjustment of division plane to facilitate even tissue spreading.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor-initiating cells have been suggested to be rare in many cancers. We tested this in mouse malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) and found that 18% of primary and 49% of passaged MPNST cells from Nf1+/−; Ink4a/Arf−/− mice formed tumors upon transplantation, whereas only 1.8% to 2.6% of MPNST cells from Nf1+/−; p53+/− mice did. MPNST cells of both genotypes require laminin binding to β1-integrin for clonogenic growth. Most MPNST cells from Nf1+/−; Ink4a/Arf−/− mice expressed laminin, whereas most MPNST cells from Nf1+/−; p53+/− mice did not. Exogenous laminin increased the percentage of MPNST cells from Nf1+/−; p53+/− but not Nf1+/−; Ink4a/Arf−/− mice that formed tumorigenic colonies. Tumor-forming potential is common among MPNST cells, but the assay conditions required to detect it vary with tumor genotype.

Abstract: In rat pancreatic β cells, arachidonic acid (AA) triggered intracellular Ca2+ release. This effect could be mimicked by eicosatetraynoic acid, indicating that AA metabolism is not required. The AA-mediated Ca2+ signal was not affected by inhibition of ryanodine receptors or emptying of ryanodine-sensitive store but was reduced by ∼70% following the disruption of acidic stores (treatment with bafilomycin A1 or glycyl-phenylalanyl-β-naphthylamide (GPN)). The action of AA did not involve TRPM2 channels or NAADP receptors because intracellular dialysis of adenosine diphosphoribose (ADPR; an activator of TRPM2 channels) or NAADP did not affect the AA response. In contrast, stimulation of IP3 receptors via intracellular dialysis of adenophostin A, or exogenous application of ATP largely abolished the AA-mediated Ca2+ signal. Intracellular dialysis of heparin abolished the ATP-mediated Ca2+ signal but not the AA response, suggesting that the action of AA did not involve the IP3-binding site. Treatment with the SERCA pump inhibitor, thapsigargin, reduced the amplitude of the AA-mediated Ca2+ signal by ∼70%. Overall, our finding suggests that AA mobilizes Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum as well as an acidic store and both stores could be depleted by IP3 receptor agonist. The possibility of secretory granules as targets of AA is discussed.

Developmental profile of localized spontaneous Ca2+ release events in the dendrites of rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons,

Abstract: Recent experiments demonstrate that localized spontaneous Ca2+ release events can be detected in the dendrites of pyramidal cells in the hippocampus and other neurons (J. Neurosci. 29 (2009) 7833–7845). These events have some properties that resemble ryanodine receptor mediated “sparks” in myocytes, and some that resemble IP3 receptor mediated “puffs” in oocytes. They can be detected in the dendrites of rats of all tested ages between P3 and P80 (with sparser sampling in older rats), suggesting that they serve a general signaling function and are not just important in development. However, in younger rats the amplitudes of the events are larger than the amplitudes in older animals and almost as large as the amplitudes of Ca2+ signals from backpropagating action potentials (bAPs). The rise time of the event signal is fast at all ages and is comparable to the rise time of the bAP fluorescence signal at the same dendritic location. The decay time is slower in younger animals, primarily because of weaker Ca2+ extrusion mechanisms at that age. Diffusion away from a brief localized source is the major determinant of decay at all ages. A simple computational model closely simulates these events with extrusion rate the only age dependent variable.

Abstract: Summary
Here we show that Rab25 permits the sorting of ligand-occupied, active-conformation α5β1 integrin to late endosomes/lysosomes. Photoactivation and biochemical approaches show that lysosomally targeted integrins are not degraded but are retrogradely transported and recycled to the plasma membrane at the back of invading cells. This requires CLIC3, a protein upregulated in Rab25-expressing cells and tumors, which colocalizes with active α5β1 in late endosomes/lysosomes. CLIC3 is necessary for release of the cell rear during migration on 3D matrices and is required for invasion and maintenance of active Src signaling in organotypic microenvironments. CLIC3 expression predicts lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis in operable cases of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The identification of CLIC3 as a regulator of a recycling pathway and as an independent prognostic indicator in PDAC highlights the importance of active integrin trafficking as a potential drive to cancer progression in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in Pkd1, encoding polycystin-1 (PC1), cause autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). We show that the carboxy-terminal tail (CTT) of PC1 is released by γ-secretase-mediated cleavage and regulates the Wnt and CHOP pathways by binding the transcription factors TCF and CHOP, disrupting their interaction with the common transcriptional coactivator p300. Loss of PC1 causes increased proliferation and apoptosis, while reintroducing PC1-CTT into cultured Pkd1 null cells reestablishes normal growth rate, suppresses apoptosis, and prevents cyst formation. Inhibition of γ-secretase activity impairs the ability of PC1 to suppress growth and apoptosis and leads to cyst formation in cultured renal epithelial cells. Expression of the PC1-CTT is sufficient to rescue the dorsal body curvature phenotype in zebrafish embryos resulting from either γ-secretase inhibition or suppression of Pkd1 expression. Thus, γ-secretase-dependent release of the PC1-CTT creates a protein fragment whose expression is sufficient to suppress ADPKD-related phenotypes in vitro and in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
The formation of mRNPs controls the interaction of the translation and degradation machinery with individual mRNAs. The yeast Scd6 protein and its orthologs regulate translation and mRNA degradation in yeast, C. elegans, D. melanogaster, and humans by an unknown mechanism. We demonstrate that Scd6 represses translation by binding the eIF4G subunit of eIF4F in a manner dependent on its RGG domain, thereby forming an mRNP repressed for translation initiation. Strikingly, several other RGG domain-containing proteins in yeast copurify with eIF4E/G and we demonstrate that two such proteins, Npl3 and Sbp1, also directly bind eIF4G and repress translation in a manner dependent on their RGG motifs. These observations identify the mechanism of Scd6 function through its RGG motif and indicate that eIF4G plays an important role as a scaffolding protein for the recruitment of translation repressors.

Abstract: Summary
The control and function of RNA are governed by the specificity of RNA binding proteins. Here, we describe a method for global unbiased analysis of RNA-protein interactions that uses in vitro selection, high-throughput sequencing, and sequence-specificity landscapes. The method yields affinities for a vast array of RNAs in a single experiment, including both low- and high-affinity sites. It is reproducible and accurate. Using this approach, we analyzed members of the PUF (Pumilio and FBF) family of eukaryotic mRNA regulators. Our data identify effects of a specific protein partner on PUF-RNA interactions, reveal subsets of target sites not previously detected, and demonstrate that designer PUF proteins can precisely alter specificity. The approach described here is, in principle, broadly applicable for analysis of any molecule that binds RNA, including proteins, nucleic acids, and small molecules.

Abstract: The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effects on hippocampal vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels in rats when they experience hippocampal-dependent spatial learning via the Morris water maze (MWM) task. Rats underwent one of two different versions of the MWM: weak or intensive. After one day of intensive training, a highly sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure VEGF protein levels in the hippocampus, cortex, and serum, and higher levels were found in the trained group compared to a naive control group. VEGF levels also increased in rats that swam only for durations equal to the intensive training periods. In contrast, rats trained under the weaker MWM paradigm for five days showed a decrease in hippocampal VEGF protein level. Mimicking increases in neuronal VEGF in the hippocampus by direct infusion of VEGF into CA1 resulted in up-regulation of the phosphorylation of the cAMP response element-binding (CREB) protein and the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases II (CaMKII). These results suggest that VEGF may be a physiological parameter involved in learning procedures that include physical activity.

Abstract: Summary
Several types of retinal interneurons exhibit spikes but lack axons. One such neuron is the AII amacrine cell, in which spikes recorded at the soma exhibit small amplitudes (<10 mV) and broad time courses (>5 ms). Here, we used electrophysiological recordings and computational analysis to examine the mechanisms underlying this atypical spiking. We found that somatic spikes likely represent large, brief action potential-like events initiated in a single, electrotonically distal dendritic compartment. In this same compartment, spiking undergoes slow modulation, likely by an M-type K conductance. The structural correlate of this compartment is a thin neurite that extends from the primary dendritic tree: local application of TTX to this neurite, or excision of it, eliminates spiking. Thus, the physiology of the axonless AII is much more complex than would be anticipated from morphological descriptions and somatic recordings; in particular, the AII possesses a single dendritic structure that controls its firing pattern.

HJURP Uses Distinct CENP-A Surfaces to Recognize and to Stabilize CENP-A/Histone H4 for Centromere Assembly,

Abstract: Summary
Centromeres are defined by the presence of chromatin containing the histone H3 variant, CENP-A, whose assembly into nucleosomes requires the chromatin assembly factor HJURP. We find that whereas surface-exposed residues in the CENP-A targeting domain (CATD) are the primary sequence determinants for HJURP recognition, buried CATD residues that generate rigidity with H4 are also required for efficient incorporation into centromeres. HJURP contact points adjacent to the CATD on the CENP-A surface are not used for binding specificity but rather to transmit stability broadly throughout the histone fold domains of both CENP-A and H4. Furthermore, an intact CENP-A/CENP-A interface is a requirement for stable chromatin incorporation immediately upon HJURP-mediated assembly. These data offer insight into the mechanism by which HJURP discriminates CENP-A from bulk histone complexes and chaperones CENP-A/H4 for a substantial portion of the cell cycle prior to mediating chromatin assembly at the centromere.

Abstract: Summary
Morphogenesis is a developmental phase during which cell fates are executed. Mechanical forces shaping individual cells play a key role during tissue morphogenesis. By investigating morphogenesis of the Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodite vulva, we show that the force-generating actomyosin network is differentially regulated by NOTCH and EGFR/RAS/MAPK signaling to shape the vulval tube. NOTCH signaling activates expression of the RHO kinase LET-502 in the secondary cell lineage through the ETS-family transcription factor LIN-1. LET-502 induces actomyosin-mediated contraction of the apical lumen in the secondary toroids, thereby generating a dorsal pushing force. In contrast, MAPK signaling in the primary lineage downregulates LET-502 RHO kinase expression to prevent toroid contraction and allow the gonadal anchor cell to expand the dorsal lumen of the primary toroids. The antagonistic action of the MAPK and NOTCH pathways thus controls vulval tube morphogenesis linking cell fate specification to morphogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The compartmental organization of eukaryotic cells is maintained dynamically by vesicular trafficking. SNARE proteins play a crucial role in intracellular membrane fusion and need to be targeted to their proper donor or acceptor membrane. The molecular mechanisms that allow for the secretory vesicles carrying the v-SNARE TI-VAMP/VAMP7 to leave the cell center, load onto microtubules, and reach the periphery to mediate exocytosis are largely unknown. Here, we show that the TI-VAMP/VAMP7 partner Varp, a Rab21 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, interacts with GolginA4 and the kinesin 1 Kif5A. Activated Rab21-GTP in turn binds to MACF1, an actin and microtubule regulator, which is itself a partner of GolginA4. These components are required for directed movement of TI-VAMP/VAMP7 vesicles from the cell center to the cell periphery. The molecular mechanisms uncovered here suggest an integrated view of the transport of vesicles carrying a specific v-SNARE toward the cell surface.

Abstract: Summary
Activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) is an endothelial-specific member of the TGF-β/BMP receptor family that is inactivated in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). How ALK1 signaling regulates angiogenesis remains incompletely understood. Here we show that ALK1 inhibits angiogenesis by cooperating with the Notch pathway. Blocking Alk1 signaling during postnatal development in mice leads to retinal hypervascularization and the appearance of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Combined blockade of Alk1 and Notch signaling further exacerbates hypervascularization, whereas activation of Alk1 by its high-affinity ligand BMP9 rescues hypersprouting induced by Notch inhibition. Mechanistically, ALK1-dependent SMAD signaling synergizes with activated Notch in stalk cells to induce expression of the Notch targets HEY1 and HEY2, thereby repressing VEGF signaling, tip cell formation, and endothelial sprouting. Taken together, these results uncover a direct link between ALK1 and Notch signaling during vascular morphogenesis that may be relevant to the pathogenesis of HHT vascular lesions.

Abstract: Summary
Nutritional and pharmacological stimuli can dramatically alter the cellular phenotypes in white adipose tissue (WAT). Utilizing genetic lineage tracing techniques, we demonstrate that brown adipocytes (BA) that are induced by β3-adrenergic receptor activation in abdominal WAT arise from the proliferation and differentiation of cells expressing platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα), CD34, and Sca-1 (PDGFRα+ cells). PDGFRα+ cells have a unique morphology in which extended processes contact multiple cells in the tissue microenvironment. Surprisingly, these cells also give rise to white adipocytes (WA) that can comprise up to 25% of total fat cells in abdominal fat pads following 8 weeks of high-fat feeding. Isolated PDGFRα+ cells differentiated into both BA and WA in vitro and generated WA after transplantation in vivo. The identification of PDGFRα+ cells as bipotential adipocyte progenitors will enable further investigation of mechanisms that promote therapeutic cellular remodeling in adult WAT.

However the signaling pathway mediated by ROCK had not been investigated so far and it was not known whether ROCK also contributed to Ca2+ signaling in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), which undergo profound phenotypic changes. Our results showed that in VSMC, ROCK inhibition by Y-27632 or H-1152 had no effect on the Ca2+ response to vasopressin, while in aorta the vasopressin-induced Ca2+ entry was significantly decreased. The inhibition of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) by ML-7 depressed the vasopressin-induced Ca2+ signal in aorta but not in VSMC. The difference in ROCK sensitivity of vasopressin-induced Ca2+ entry between aorta and VSMC was not related to an alteration of the RhoA/ROCK pathway. However, MLCK expression and activity were depressed in cultured cells compared to aorta. We concluded that the regulation of vasopressin-induced Ca2+ entry by ROCK in aorta could involve the myosin cytoskeleton and could be prevented by the downregulation of MLCK in VSMC. These results underline the important differences in Ca2+ regulation between whole tissue and cultured cells.

Abstract: Summary
Emerging evidence indicates that membrane lipids regulate protein networking by directly interacting with protein-interaction domains (PIDs). As a pilot study to identify and functionally annodate lipid-binding PIDs on a genomic scale, we performed experimental and computational studies of PDZ domains. Characterization of 70 PDZ domains showed that ∼40% had submicromolar membrane affinity. Using a computational model built from these data, we predicted the membrane-binding properties of 2,000 PDZ domains from 20 species. The accuracy of the prediction was experimentally validated for 26 PDZ domains. We also subdivided lipid-binding PDZ domains into three classes based on the interplay between membrane- and protein-binding sites. For different classes of PDZ domains, lipid binding regulates their protein interactions by different mechanisms. Functional studies of a PDZ domain protein, rhophilin 2, suggest that all classes of lipid-binding PDZ domains serve as genuine dual-specificity modules regulating protein interactions at the membrane under physiological conditions.

Abstract: Energy supply is the most prominent function of mitochondria, but in addition, mitochondria are indispensable for a multitude of other important cellular functions including calcium (Ca2+) signaling and buffering, the supply of metabolites and the sequestration of apoptotic factors. The efficiency of those functions highly depends on the proper positioning of mitochondria within the cytosol. In lymphocytes, mitochondria preferentially localize into the vicinity (∼200nm) of the immune synapse (IS). This localization is regulated by motor-based cytoskeleton-mediated transport, the fusion/fission dynamics of mitochondria, and probably also through tethering with the ER. IS formation also induces the accumulation of CRAC/ORAI1 Ca2+ channels, the CRAC/ORAI channel activator STIM1, K+ channels and plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA) within the IS. Such a large agglomeration of Ca2+ binding organelles and proteins highlights the IS as a critical cellular compartment for Ca2+ dependent lymphocyte activation. At the IS, Ca2+ microdomains generated beneath open CRAC/ORAI channels provide a rapid, robust and reliable mechanism for driving cellular responses in mast cells and T cells. Here, we discuss the relevance of motor-based mitochondrial transport, fusion, fission and tethering for mitochondrial localization in T cells and the importance of subplasmalemmal mitochondria to control local CRAC/ORAI1-dependent Ca2+ microdomains at the IS for efficient T lymphocyte activation.

Abstract: Summary
The association between hyperinflammatory states and numerous diseases is widely recognized, but our understanding of the molecular strategies that have evolved to prevent uncontrolled activation of inflammatory responses remains incomplete. Here, we report a critical, nontranscriptional role of GPS2 as a guardian against hyperstimulation of the TNF-α-induced gene program. GPS2 cytoplasmic actions are required to specifically modulate RIP1 ubiquitylation and JNK activation by inhibiting TRAF2/Ubc13 enzymatic activity. In vivo relevance of GPS2 anti-inflammatory role is confirmed by inhibition of TNF-α target genes in macrophages and by improved insulin signaling in the adipose tissue of aP2-GPS2 transgenic mice. As the nontranscriptional role is complemented by GPS2 functioning as positive and negative cofactor for nuclear receptors, in vivo overexpression also results in elevated circulating level of Resistin and development of hepatic steatosis. Together, these studies define GPS2 as a molecular guardian required for precise control of inflammatory responses involved in immunity and homeostasis.

Abstract: The present study was conducted to clarify the regional distribution and relative frequency of endocrine cells secreting serotonin, substance P (SP), cholecystokinin-8 (CCK-8), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and neurotensin in the small and large intestine of the mole-rats (Spalax leucodon), by specific immunohistochemical methods. In the small and large intestine of mole-rats (Spalax leucodon), serotonin, SP and VIP were identified with various frequencies, but CCK-8 and neurotensin were not observed. Most of the IR cells in the small and large intestine were located in the intestinal crypt and epithelium however, they were more frequency in the intestinal crypt. Serotonin-IR cells were detected throughout the whole intestinal tract, predominantly in the duodenum and colon. SP-IR cells were demonstrated throughout the whole intestinal tract except for the ileum and rectum with highest frequencies in the cecum. VIP-IR cells were found in all parts of the small intestine except for the large intestine. In conclusion, the general distribution patterns and relative frequency of intestinal endocrine cells of the mole-rats (Spalax leucodon) was similar to those of some rodent species. However, some species-dependent unique distributions and frequencies characteristics of endocrine cells were also observed in the present study.

Abstract: Summary
Synovial sarcoma is a translocation-associated sarcoma where the underlying chromosomal event generates SS18-SSX fusion transcripts. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that the SS18-SSX fusion oncoprotein is both necessary and sufficient to support tumorigenesis; however, its mechanism of action remains poorly defined. We have purified a core SS18-SSX complex and discovered that SS18-SSX serves as a bridge between activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) and transducin-like enhancer of split 1 (TLE1), resulting in repression of ATF2 target genes. Disruption of these components by siRNA knockdown or treatment with HDAC inhibitors rescues target gene expression, leading to growth suppression and apoptosis. Together, these studies define a fundamental role for aberrant ATF2 transcriptional dysregulation in the etiology of synovial sarcoma.

Abstract: Summary
The PI3K/mTOR-pathway is the most commonly dysregulated pathway in epithelial cancers and represents an important target for cancer therapeutics. Here, we show that dual inhibition of PI3K/mTOR in ovarian cancer-spheroids leads to death of inner matrix-deprived cells, whereas matrix-attached cells are resistant. This matrix-associated resistance is mediated by drug-induced upregulation of cellular survival programs that involve both FOXO-regulated transcription and cap-independent translation. Inhibition of any one of several upregulated proteins, including Bcl-2, EGFR, or IGF1R, abrogates resistance to PI3K/mTOR inhibition. These results demonstrate that acute adaptive responses to PI3K/mTOR inhibition in matrix-attached cells resemble well-conserved stress responses to nutrient and growth factor deprivation. Bypass of this resistance mechanism through rational design of drug combinations could significantly enhance PI3K-targeted drug efficacy.

Abstract: Summary
Protein gradients play a central role in the spatial organization of cells, but the mechanisms of their formation are incompletely understood. This study analyzes the determinants responsible for establishing bipolar gradients of the ATPase MipZ, a key regulator of division site placement in Caulobacter crescentus. We have solved the crystal structure of MipZ in different nucleotide states, dissected its ATPase cycle, and investigated its interaction with FtsZ, ParB, and the nucleoid. Our results suggest that the polar ParB complexes locally stimulate the formation of ATP-bound MipZ dimers, which are then retained near the cell poles through association with chromosomal DNA. Due to their intrinsic ATPase activity, dimers eventually dissociate into freely diffusible monomers that undergo spontaneous nucleotide exchange and are recaptured by ParB. These findings clarify the molecular function of a conserved gradient-forming system and reveal mechanistic principles that might be commonly used to sustain protein gradients within cells.

Abstract: Summary
Müller glia (MG) dedifferentiation into a cycling population of multipotent progenitors is crucial to zebrafish retina regeneration. The mechanisms underlying MG dedifferentiation are unknown. Here we report that heparin-binding epidermal-like growth factor (HB-EGF) is rapidly induced in MG residing at the injury site and that pro-HB-EGF ectodomain shedding is necessary for retina regeneration. Remarkably, HB-EGF stimulates the formation of multipotent MG-derived progenitors in the uninjured retina. We show that HB-EGF mediates its effects via an EGFR/MAPK signal transduction cascade that regulates the expression of regeneration-associated genes, like ascl1a and pax6b. We also uncover an HB-EGF/Ascl1a/Notch/hb-egfa-signaling loop that helps define the zone of injury-responsive MG. Finally, we show that HB-EGF acts upstream of the Wnt/β-catenin-signaling cascade that controls progenitor proliferation. These data provide a link between extracellular signaling and regeneration-associated gene expression in the injured retina and suggest strategies for stimulating retina regeneration in mammals.

Abstract: Primary lung tumors, breast tumors, and melanoma metastasize mainly in the brain where therapy is limited to surgery and radiation. To investigate the molecular basis of brain metastases, we isolated brain-trophic metastatic MDA-MB-435-LvBr2 (LvBr2) cells via left ventricle (LV) injection of MDA-MB-435 cells into immunodeficiency (NOD/ SCID) mice. Whereas parent MDA-MB-435 cells displayed an elongated morphology, LvBr2 cells were round and displayed an aggregated distribution. LvBr2 cells expressed lower β-catenin levels and higher heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C1/C2 (hnRNPC) levels than parental cells. Since microRNAs are known to play an important role in cancer progression including metastasis, we screened microRNAs expressed specifically in brain metastases. MicroRNA-146a was almost undetectable in LvBr2 cells and highly expressed in the parental cells. Overexpression of miR-146a increased β-catenin expression and suppressed the migratory and invasive activity of LvBr2 cells. The miR-146a-elicited decrease in hnRNPC in turn lowered the expression of MMP-1, uPA, and uPAR and inhibited the migratory and invasive activity of LvBr2 cells. Taken together, our findings indicate that miR-146a is virtually absent from brain metastases and can suppress their metastatic potential including their migratory and invasive activities associated with upregulation of β-catenin and downregulation of hnRNPC.

Abstract: Summary
Neural crest cells are a transient stem cell-like population appearing during vertebrate embryonic development. Generation of the cranial neural crest is known to require a balanced combination of FGF and BMP levels. However, it is poorly understood how the functions of such growth factors are controlled in the extracellular space. Anosmin is an extracellular matrix protein implicated in FGF signaling and mutated in Kallmann syndrome. Here, we demonstrate that anosmin is synthesized locally in the cranial neural crest of chicken embryos and is essential for cranial neural crest formation. Anosmin upregulates FGF8 and BMP5 gene expression; it also enhances FGF8 activity while inhibiting BMP5 and WNT3a signaling. Taken together, our data establish that the matrix protein anosmin is required for cranial neural crest formation, with functional modulation of FGF, BMP, and WNT.

Abstract: Summary
Zinc is an essential trace element involved in many biological processes and human diseases. Because zinc deficiency and excess are deleterious, animals require homeostatic mechanisms to maintain zinc levels in response to dietary fluctuations. Here, we demonstrate that lysosome-related organelles in intestinal cells of C. elegans, called gut granules, function as the major site of zinc storage. Zinc storage in gut granules promotes detoxification and subsequent mobilization, linking cellular and organismal zinc metabolism. The cation diffusion facilitator protein CDF-2 plays a critical role in this process by transporting zinc into gut granules. In response to high dietary zinc, gut granules displayed structural changes characterized by a bilobed morphology with asymmetric distributions of zinc and molecular markers. We defined a genetic pathway that mediates the formation of bilobed morphology. These findings elucidate mechanisms of zinc storage, detoxification, and mobilization in C. elegans and may be relevant to other animals.

Abstract: Summary
Rab GTPases define the vesicle trafficking pathways underpinning cell polarization and migration. Here, we find that Rab4, Rab11, and Rab14 and the candidate Rab GDP-GTP exchange factors (GEFs) FAM116A and AVL9 are required for cell migration. Rab14 and its GEF FAM116A localize to and act on an intermediate compartment of the transferrin-recycling pathway prior to Rab11 and after Rab5 and Rab4. This Rab14 intermediate recycling compartment has specific functions in migrating cells discrete from early and recycling endosomes. Rab14-depleted cells show increased N-cadherin levels at junctional complexes and cannot resolve cell-cell junctions. This is due to decreased shedding of cell-surface N-cadherin by the ADAM family protease ADAM10/Kuzbanian. In FAM116A- and Rab14-depleted cells, ADAM10 accumulates in a transferrin-positive endocytic compartment, and the cell-surface level of ADAM10 is correspondingly reduced. FAM116 and Rab14 therefore define an endocytic recycling pathway needed for ADAM protease trafficking and regulation of cell-cell junctions.

Abstract: Summary
The TOR complex 1 (TORC1) in yeast is regulated by various stress conditions. However, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. In this study, we show that stresses affect TORC1 function through Rho1, a member of Rho family GTPases. Upon activation by stresses, Rho1 binds directly to Kog1, a unique component of TORC1, resulting in downregulation of TORC1 activity and disruption of its membrane association. The binding also triggers the release and activation of the Tap42-2A phosphatase, a major effector of TORC1 that resides on the complex. Rapamycin and caffeine also induce Rho1 activation. While the two agents inhibit TOR directly, their effects on TORC1 signaling are largely dependent on Rho1 activation. Our findings demonstrate that TORC1 acts both upstream and downstream of Rho1 GTPase, unveiling a mechanism that integrates stress and nutrient signals to coordinate Rho1-mediated spatial expansion and TORC1-dependent mass increase.

Abstract: 1,2-Dibromoethane and glycidol are well known genotoxic carcinogens, which have been widely used in industry. To identify a specific biomarker for these carcinogens in cells, the cellular proteome of L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells treated with these compounds was analyzed by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS). Of 50 protein spots showing a greater than 1.5-fold increase or decrease in intensity compared to control cells on a 2-D gel, we focused on the candidate biomarker moesin. Western analysis using monoclonal rabbit anti-moesin confirmed the identity of the protein and its increased level of expression upon exposure to the carcinogenic compounds. Moesin expression also increased in cells treated with six additional genotoxic carcinogens, verifying that moesin could serve as a biomarker to monitor phenotypic change upon exposure to genotoxic carcinogens in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells.

Abstract: Summary
Discovering how histone variants that mark distinct chromatin regions affect a developmental program is a major challenge in the epigenetics field. To assess the importance of the H3.3 histone variant and its dedicated histone chaperone HIRA, we used an established developmental model, Xenopus laevis. After the early rapid divisions exploiting a large maternal pool of both replicative H3.2 and replacement H3.3, H3.3 transcripts show a distinct peak of expression at gastrulation. Depletion of both H3.2 and H3.3 leads to an early gastrulation arrest. However, with only H3.3 depletion, defects occur at late gastrulation, impairing further development. Providing exogenous H3.3 mRNAs, but not replicative H3.2 mRNAs, rescues these defects. Notably, downregulation of the H3.3 histone chaperone HIRA similarly impairs late gastrulation, and we find a global defect in H3.3 incorporation into chromatin comparable to H3.3 depletion. We discuss how specific HIRA-dependent H3.3 deposition is required for chromatin dynamics during gastrulation.

Abstract: Summary
Signaling events that regulate central nervous system (CNS) angiogenesis and blood-brain barrier (BBB) formation are only beginning to be elucidated. By evaluating the gene expression profile of mouse vasculature, we identified DR6/TNFRSF21 and TROY/TNFRSF19 as regulators of CNS-specific angiogenesis in both zebrafish and mice. Furthermore, these two death receptors interact both genetically and physically and are required for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated JNK activation and subsequent human brain endothelial sprouting in vitro. Increasing beta-catenin levels in brain endothelium upregulate DR6 and TROY, indicating that these death receptors are downstream target genes of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, which has been shown to be required for BBB development. These findings define a role for death receptors DR6 and TROY in CNS-specific vascular development.

Abstract: Summary
Medulloblastomas that display a large cell/anaplastic morphology and overexpress the cellular c-MYC gene are highly aggressive and carry a very poor prognosis. This so-called MYC-subgroup differs in its histopathology, gene expression profile, and clinical behavior from other forms of medulloblastoma. We generated a mouse model of MYC-subgroup medulloblastoma by transducing Trp53-null cerebellar progenitor cells with Myc. The cardinal features of these mouse medulloblastomas closely mimic those of human MYC-subgroup tumors and significantly differ from mouse models of the Sonic-Hedgehog- and WNT-disease subgroups. This mouse model should significantly accelerate understanding and treatment of the most aggressive form of medulloblastoma and infers distinct roles for MYC and MYCN in tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Summary
To gain insight into the interplay of processes and species that maintain a correctly folded, functional proteome, we have developed a computational model called FoldEco. FoldEco models the cellular proteostasis network of the E. coli cytoplasm, including protein synthesis, degradation, aggregation, chaperone systems, and the folding characteristics of protein clients. We focused on E. coli because much of the needed input information—including mechanisms, rate parameters, and equilibrium coefficients—is available, largely from in vitro experiments; however, FoldEco will shed light on proteostasis in other organisms. FoldEco can generate hypotheses to guide the design of new experiments. Hypothesis generation leads to system-wide questions and shows how to convert these questions to experimentally measurable quantities, such as changes in protein concentrations with chaperone or protease levels, which can then be used to improve our current understanding of proteostasis and refine the model. A web version of FoldEco is available at http://foldeco.scripps.edu.

Abstract: Summary
There is increasing evidence that some cancers are hierarchically organized, sustained by a relatively rare population of cancer-initiating cells (C-ICs). Although the capacity to initiate tumors upon serial transplantation is a hallmark of all C-ICs, little is known about the genes that control this process. Here, we establish that ID1 and ID3 function together to govern colon cancer-initiating cell (CC-IC) self-renewal through cell-cycle restriction driven by the cell-cycle inhibitor p21. Regulation of p21 by ID1 and ID3 is a central mechanism preventing the accumulation of excess DNA damage and subsequent functional exhaustion of CC-ICs. Additionally, silencing of ID1 and ID3 increases sensitivity of CC-ICs to the chemotherapeutic agent oxaliplatin, linking tumor initiation function with chemotherapy resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Gram-negative bacteria often modify their lipopolysaccharide (LPS), thereby increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents and avoidance of the host immune system. However, it is unclear how bacteria adjust the levels and activities of LPS-modifying enzymes in response to the modification status of their LPS. We now address this question by investigating the major regulator of LPS modifications in Salmonella enterica. We report that the PmrA/PmrB system controls expression of a membrane peptide that inhibits the activity of LpxT, an enzyme responsible for increasing the LPS negative charge. LpxT’s inhibition and the PmrA-dependent incorporation of positively charged L-4-aminoarabinose into the LPS decrease Fe3+ binding to the bacterial cell. Because Fe3+ is an activating ligand for the sensor PmrB, transcription of PmrA-dependent LPS-modifying genes is reduced. This mechanism enables bacteria to sense their cell surface by its effect on the availability of an inducing signal for the system regulating cell-surface modifications.

Abstract: Summary
Clinical evidence indicates that mutation/activation of EGF receptors (EGFRs) is mutually exclusive with the presence of K-RAS oncogenes in lung and colon tumors. We have validated these observations using genetically engineered mouse models. However, development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas driven by K-Ras oncogenes are totally dependent on EGFR signaling. Similar results were obtained using human pancreatic tumor cell lines. EGFRs were also essential even in the context of pancreatic injury and absence of p16Ink4a/p19Arf. Only loss of p53 made pancreatic tumors independent of EGFR signaling. Additional inhibition of PI3K and STAT3 effectively prevented proliferation of explants derived from these p53-defective pancreatic tumors. These findings may provide the bases for more rational approaches to treat pancreatic tumors in the clinic.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are built from ∼30 different proteins called nucleoporins or Nups. Previous studies have shown that several Nups exhibit cell-type-specific expression and that mutations in NPC components result in tissue-specific diseases. Here we show that a specific change in NPC composition is required for both myogenic and neuronal differentiation. The transmembrane nucleoporin Nup210 is absent in proliferating myoblasts and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) but becomes expressed and incorporated into NPCs during cell differentiation. Preventing Nup210 production by RNAi blocks myogenesis and the differentiation of ESCs into neuroprogenitors. We found that the addition of Nup210 to NPCs does not affect nuclear transport but is required for the induction of genes that are essential for cell differentiation. Our results identify a single change in NPC composition as an essential step in cell differentiation and establish a role for Nup210 in gene expression regulation and cell fate determination.

Abstract: Tracking of transplanted cells has become an important procedure in cell therapy. We studied the in vitro dye retention, survival and in vivo tracking of stem cells with PKH26 dye. Sheep BMSCs and ADSCs were labeled with 2, 4 and 8μmol of PKH26 and monitored for six passages. Labeled BMSCs and ADSCs acquired mean cumulative population doubling of 12.7±0.4 and 14.6±0.5; unlabeled samples had 13.8±0.5 and 15.4±0.6 respectively. Upon staining with 2, 4 and 8μmol PKH26, BMSCs had retentions of 40.0±5.8, 60.0±2.9 and 95.0±2.9%, while ADSCs had 92.0±1.2, 95.0±1.2 and 98.0±1.2%. ADSCs retentions were significantly higher at 2 and 4μmol. On dye retention comparison at 8μmol and 4μmol for BMSCs and ADSCs; ADSCs were significantly higher at passages 2 and 3. The viability of BMSCs reduced from 94.0±1.2% to 90.0±0.6% and ADSCs from 94.0±1.2% to 52.0±1.2% (p<0.05) after 24h. BMSCs had significant up regulation of the cartilage genes for both the labeled and the unlabeled samples compared to ADSCs (p<0.05). PKH26 fluorescence was detected on the resected portions of the regenerated neo-cartilage. The recommended concentration of PKH26 for ADSCs is 2μmol and BMSCs is 8μmol, and they can be tracked up to 49 days.

Histone H3 Lysine 56 Methylation Regulates DNA Replication through Its Interaction with PCNA,

Abstract: Summary
Histone modifications play important roles in regulating DNA-based biological processes. Of the modified sites, histone H3 lysine 56 (H3K56) is unique in that it lies within the globular core domain near the entry-exit sites of the nucleosomal DNA superhelix and its acetylation state in yeast is a marker for newly synthesized histones in transcription, DNA repair, and DNA replication. We now report the presence of H3K56 monomethylation (H3K56me1) in mammalian cells and find that the histone lysine methytransferase G9a/KMT1C is required for H3K56me1 both in vivo and in vitro. We also find that disruption of G9a or H3K56 impairs DNA replication. Furthermore, H3K56me1 associates with the replication processivity factor PCNA primarily in G1 phase of the cell cycle and, directly, in vitro. These results find H3K56me1 in mammals and indicate a role for H3K56me1 as a chromatin docking site for PCNA prior to its function in DNA replication.

Abstract: Lck Interacting Membrane protein (LIME) was previously characterized as a transmembrane adaptor protein mediating TCR-dependent T cell activation. Here, we show that LIME associates with Vav in response to TCR stimulation and is required for Vav guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity for Rac1. Consistent with this finding, actin polymerization at the immunological synapse (IS) was markedly enhanced by overexpression of LIME, but was reduced by expression of a LIME shRNA. Moreover, TCR-mediated cell adhesion to ICAM-1, laminin, or fibronectin was downregulated by expression of LIME shRNA. In addition, in the IS, LIME but not LAT was found to localize at the peripheral-supramolecular activation cluster (p-SMAC) where the integrins were previously shown to be localized. Together, these results establish LIME as a transmembrane adaptor protein linking TCR stimulation to IS formation and integrin activation through activation of Vav.
