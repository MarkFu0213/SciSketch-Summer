Abstract: Centrioles and basal bodies (referred to hereafter as centrioles for simplicity) are microtubule-based cylindrical organelles that are typically ∼450-nm long and ∼250nm in diameter. The centriole is composed of three distinct regions: the distal part characterized by microtubule doublets, the central core that harbors microtubule triplets, which are also present in the proximal part that also contains the cartwheel, a structure crucial for centriole assembly. The cartwheel was initially revealed by conventional electron microscopy of resin-embedded samples and is thought to impart the near universal ninefold symmetry of centrioles. Deciphering the native architecture of the cartwheel has proven challenging owing to its small dimensions and the difficulties in isolating it. Here, we present a method to purify and analyze the structure of the exceptionally long Trichonympha centriole by cryotomography and subtomogram averaging. Using this method, we revealed the native architecture of the proximal cartwheel-containing region at ∼40Å-resolution. This method can be applied as a general strategy for uncovering the structure of centrioles in other species.

Abstract: Here we reported that co-administration of docetaxel and a cell-permeable short-chain ceramide (C6) resulted in a striking increase in growth inhibition and apoptosis in primary and transformed breast cells (MCF-7 and MDA-231), which were associated with mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening, a significant reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and the pro-apoptotic AMP-Protein Kinase (AMPK) as well as c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) activations. Contrarily, the mPTP blocker sanglifehrin A (SfA) or the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) largely inhibited co-administration-induced cytotoxicity. Further, cyclosporin A (CsA), the inhibitor of cyclophilin-D (Cyp-D, the key mPTP component), as well as Cyp-D RNA silencing also suppressed breast cancer cell death by the co-treatment, while cells overexpressing Cyp-D showed hypersensitivity to docetaxel. Meanwhile, JNK and AMPK inhibition alleviated cell death induced by the co-administration in cultured breast cancer cells. Significantly, C6 ceramide plus docetaxel caused dramatic human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-1/-2 degradation and downstream Akt/Erk inhibition in HER-2 expressing MDA-231 cells. These in vitro findings provide confidence in support of further development of C6 ceramide as an adjunct of docetaxel for the treatment of the metastatic breast cancer.

Abstract: Human somatic stem cells with neural differentiation potential can be valuable for developing cell-based therapies, including treatment of birth-related defects, while avoiding issues associated with cell reprogramming. Precisely defining the “identity” and differentiation potential of somatic stem cells from different sources, has proven difficult, given differences in sets of specific markers, protocols used and lack of side-by-side characterization of these cells in different studies. Therefore, we set to compare expression of mesenchymal and neural markers in human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs), pediatric adipose-derived stem cells (p-ADSCs) in parallel with human neural stem cells (NSCs). We show that UC-MSCs at a basal level express mesenchymal and so-called “neural” markers, similar to that we previously reported for the p-ADSCs. All somatic stem cell populations studied, independently from tissue and patient of origin, displayed a remarkably similar expression of surface markers, with the main difference being the restricted expression of CD133 and CD34 to NSCs. Expression of certain surface and neural markers was affected by the expansion medium used. As predicted, UC-MSCs and p-ADSCs demonstrated tri-mesenchymal lineage differentiation potential, though p-ADSCs display superior chondrogenic differentiation capability. UC-MSCs and p-ADSCs responded also to neurogenic induction by up-regulating neuronal markers, but crucially they appeared morphologically immature when compared with differentiated NSCs. This highlights the need for further investigation into the use of these cells for neural therapies. Crucially, this study demonstrates the lack of simple means to distinguish between different cell types and the effect of culture conditions on their phenotype, and indicates that a more extensive set of markers should be used for somatic stem cell characterization, especially when developing therapeutic approaches.

Abstract: We have previously demonstrated that the anti-apoptotic protein BAD is expressed in normal human breast tissue and shown that BAD inhibits expression of cyclin D1 to delay cell-cycle progression in breast cancer cells. Herein, expression of proteins in breast tissues was studied by immunohistochemistry and results were analyzed statistically to obtain semi-quantitative data. Biochemical and functional changes in BAD-overexpressing MCF7 breast cancer cells were evaluated using PCR, reporter assays, western blotting, ELISA and extracellular matrix invasion assays. Compared to normal tissues, Grade II breast cancers expressed low total/phosphorylated forms of BAD in both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments. BAD overexpression decreased the expression of β-catenin, Sp1, and phosphorylation of STATs. BAD inhibited Ras/MEK/ERK and JNK signaling pathways, without affecting the p38 signaling pathway. Expression of the metastasis-related proteins, MMP10, VEGF, SNAIL, CXCR4, E-cadherin and TlMP2 was regulated by BAD with concomitant inhibition of extracellular matrix invasion. Inhibition of BAD by siRNA increased invasion and Akt/p-Akt levels. Clinical data and the results herein suggest that in addition to the effect on apoptosis, BAD conveys anti-metastatic effects and is a valuable prognostic marker in breast cancer.

Abstract: SREBP-1 and mTOR have been proved to involve in renal lipid metabolism of diabetes mellitus. In the present study, we investigated the effect of co-regulation of SREBP-1 and mTOR on renal lipid metabolism using diabetic mice and cultured renal tubular cells. The results showed that compared with those in high glucose-stimulated HKC cells single transfected with shRNA-SREBP-1 vector, the level of SREBP-1 protein were significantly reduced by 64.1% followed by decreased FASN mRNA, ACC mRNA, ADRP protein and lipid droplets in HKC cells co-transfected with shRNA-SREBP-1 vector and kinase-dead mTOR vector. Furthermore, diabetic mice co-injected with shRNA-SREBP-1 vector and kinase-dead mTOR vector showed that renal SREBP-1 protein, FASN mRNA and ACC mRNA were respectively decreased by 34.6%, 45.9%, 22.0% in comparison with those in diabetic mice single injected with shRNA-SREBP-1 vector accompanied by reduced ADRP protein and triglyceride content. In the end our study suggests that co-regulation of SREBP-1 and mTOR in kidney of diabetic mice is more effective in lowering renal lipogenesis than only regulation of SREBP-1.

Abstract: Heat stress (HS) in hot climates is a major cause that strongly negatively affects milk yield in dairy cattle, leading to immeasurable economic loss. The heat stress response of bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs) is one component of the acute systemic response to HS. Gene networks of BMECs respond to environmental heat loads with both intra- and extracellular signals that coordinate cellular and whole-animal metabolism. Our experimental objective was to characterize the direct effects of heat stress on the cultured bovine mammary epithelial cells by microarray analyses. The data identified 2716 differentially expressed genes in 43,000 transcripts which were changed significantly between heat-stressed and normal bovine mammary epithelial cells (fold change ≥2, P ≤ 0.001). Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed that these differentially expressed genes are involved in different pathways that regulate cytoskeleton, cell cycle, and stress response processes. Our study provides an overview of gene expression profile and the interaction between gene expression and heat stress, which will lead to further understanding of the potential effects of heat stress on bovine mammary glands.

Abstract: Renal ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) is one of the main causes of the acute kidney injury (AKI) that usually occurs during clinical surgery. Autophagy plays an important role in recovery from acute ischemic kidney injury. MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) was reported to inhibit autophagy in several diseases. However, the molecular mechanism of miR-21 on autophagy during renal I/R is still unclear. For the in vitro study, NRK-52E cells were transfected with miR-21 mimics and subjected to I/R. Results showed that miR-21 mimics inhibited cell viability and induced cell apoptosis in NRK-52E cells. Expression of beclin-1 and LC3-II was induced, and p62 was decreased by I/R. miR-21 mimics inhibited this induction. RT-PCR and western blotting assay showed that miR-21 mimics inhibited the protein level of Rab11a, but not the mRNA level. A luciferase activity assay showed that miR-21 directly targeted Rab11a 3′-UTR. Rab11a overexpression attenuated the effect of miR-21 mimics and I/R on cell viability and cell apoptosis. The expression of beclin-1 and LC3-II was increased, and p62 was decreased by Rab11a overexpression. For the in vivo assay in a rat I/R model, the miR-21 level was increased during renal I/R injury. Pre-treatment with miR-21 inhibitor injection attenuated the renal injury, and enhanced expression of LC3-II and beclin-1. The results showed that miR-21 inhibited autophagy by targeting Rab11a in renal I/R, indicating that Rab11a might be a new medical target for the treatment of renal I/R.

Abstract: Rationale
Vessel formation is a crucial event in tissue repair after injury. Thus, one assumption of innovative therapeutic approaches is the understanding of its molecular mechanisms. Notwithstanding our knowledge of the role of Protein Kinase C epsilon (PKCε) in cardio-protection and vascular restenosis, its role in vessel progenitor differentiation remains elusive.
Objective
Given the availability of PKCε pharmacological modulators already tested in clinical trials, the specific aim of this study is to unravel the role of PKCε in vessel progenitor differentiation, with implications in vascular pathology and vasculogenesis.
Methods and results
Mouse Peri-Vascular Adipose Tissue (PVAT) was used as source of mesenchymal vessel progenitors. VEGF-induced differentiation of PVAT cells down-regulates both PKCε and p-PAK1 protein expression levels. PKCε overexpression and activation: i) reduced the expression levels of SMA and PECAM in endothelial differentiation of PVAT cells; ii) completely abrogated tubules formation in collagen gel assays; iii) increased the expression of p-PAK1.
Conclusion
PKCε negatively interferes with vessel progenitor differentiation via interaction with PAK-1.

HSP70 inhibits stress-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis by competitively binding to FAF1,

Abstract: Stress-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of a variety of cardiovascular diseases. Our early studies showed that HSP70 effectively inhibited apoptosis, but the underlying mechanism remained unclear. Fas-associated factor 1 (FAF1) is a member of the Fas death-inducing signaling complex (Fas-DISC) that acts upstream of caspase-8. We investigated the interactions among FAF1, HSP70, and FAS in stressed cardiomyocytes to elucidate the protective mechanism of HSP70. FAS and caspase-3/8 activity was higher in cardiomyocytes undergoing stress-induced apoptosis in restraint-stressed rats compared with cardiomyocytes in non-stressed rats, which indicated that the Fas signaling pathway was activated after restraint stress. Geranylgeranylacetone (GGA) induced an increase in HSP70 expression, which reduced stress-induced apoptosis. Additionally, overexpression of HSP70 via transfection with the pEGFP-rHSP70 plasmid attenuated norepinephrine (NE)-induced apoptosis. FAF1 expression increased during stress-induced apoptosis, and overexpression of FAF1 exacerbated NE-induced apoptosis. We also found that HSP70 interacted with FAF1. Overexpression of HSP70 inhibited the binding of FAF1 to FAS in H9C2 cells, which indicated that HSP70 suppressed NE-induced apoptosis by competitively binding to FAF1. An N-terminal deletion mutant of HSP70 (HSP70-△N) was unable to interact with FAF1. After HSP70-△N was transfected into H9C2 cells, the cells were unable to attenuate the NE-induced increases in caspase-8 and apoptosis. These results indicate that the 1–120 sequence of HSP70 binds to FAF1, which alters the interactions between FAS and FAF1 and inhibits the activation of the Fas signaling pathway and apoptosis.

Absence of keratins 8 and 18 in rodent epithelial cell lines associates with keratin gene mutation and DNA methylation: Cell line selective effects on cell invasion,

Abstract: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in carcinoma is associated with dramatic up-regulation of vimentin and down-regulation of the simple-type keratins 8 and 18 (K8/K18), but the mechanisms of these changes are poorly understood. We demonstrate that two commonly-studied murine (CT26) and rat (IEC-6) intestinal cell lines have negligible K8/K18 but high vimentin protein expression. Proteasome inhibition led to a limited increase in K18 but not K8 stabilization, thereby indicating that K8/K18 absence is not due, in large part, to increased protein turnover. CT26 and IEC-6 cells had <10% of normal K8/K18 mRNA and exhibited decreased mRNA stability, with K8 mRNA levels being higher in IEC-6 versus CT26 and K18 being higher in CT26 versus IEC-6 cells. Keratin gene sequencing showed that KRT8 in CT26 cells had a 21-nucleotide deletion while K18 in IEC-6 cells had a 9-amino acid in-frame insertion. Furthermore, the KRT8 promoter in CT26 and the KRT18 promoter in IEC-6 are hypermethylated. Inhibition of DNA methylation using 5-azacytidine increased K8 or K18 in some but all the tested rodent epithelial cell lines. Restoring K8 and K18 by lentiviral transduction reduced CT26 but not IEC-6 cell matrigel invasion. K8/K18 re-introduction also decreased E-cadherin expression in IEC-6 but not CT26 cells, suggesting that the effect of keratin expression on epithelial to mesenchymal transition is cell-line dependent. Therefore, some commonly utilized rodent epithelial cell lines, unexpectedly, manifest barely detectable keratin expression but have high levels of vimentin. In the CT26 and IEC-6 intestinal cell lines, keratin expression correlates with keratin gene insertion or deletion and with promoter methylation, which likely suppress keratin transcription and mRNA or protein stability.

Abstract: Summary
The genome-wide identification of gene functions in malaria parasites is hampered by a lack of reverse genetic screening methods. We present a large-scale resource of barcoded vectors with long homology arms for effective modification of the Plasmodium berghei genome. Cotransfecting dozens of vectors into the haploid blood stages creates complex pools of barcoded mutants, whose competitive fitness can be measured during infection of a single mouse using barcode sequencing (barseq). To validate the utility of this resource, we rescreen the P. berghei kinome, using published kinome screens for comparison. We find that several protein kinases function redundantly in asexual blood stages and confirm the targetability of kinases cdpk1, gsk3, tkl3, and PBANKA_082960 by genotyping cloned mutants. Thus, parallel phenotyping of barcoded mutants unlocks the power of reverse genetic screening for a malaria parasite and will enable the systematic identification of genes essential for in vivo parasite growth and transmission.

Abstract: Arginine methylation is a posttranslational modification that is of importance in diverse cellular processes. Recent proteomic mass spectrometry studies reported arginine methylation of ataxin-2-like (ATXN2L), the paralog of ataxin-2, a protein that is implicated in the neurodegenerative disorder spinocerebellar ataxia type 2. Here, we investigated the methylation state of ATXN2L and its significance for ATXN2L localization. We first confirmed that ATXN2L is asymmetrically dimethylated in vivo, and observed that the nuclear localization of ATXN2L is altered under methylation inhibition. We further discovered that ATXN2L associates with the protein arginine-N-methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1). Finally, we showed that neither mutation of the arginine–glycine-rich motifs of ATXN2L nor methylation inhibition alters ATXN2L localization to stress granules, suggesting that methylation of ATXN2L is probably not mandatory.

Abstract: The lysosomal degradation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is essential for receptor signaling and down regulation. Once internalized, GPCRs are sorted within the endocytic pathway and packaged into intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) that bud inward to form the multivesicular endosome (MVE). The mechanisms that control GPCR sorting and ILV formation are poorly understood. Quantitative strategies are important for evaluating the function of adaptor and scaffold proteins that regulate sorting of GPCRs at MVEs. In this chapter, we outline two strategies for the quantification and visualization of GPCR sorting into the lumen of MVEs. The first protocol utilizes a biochemical approach to assay the sorting of GPCRs in a population of cells, whereas the second strategy examines GPCR sorting in individual cells using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. Combined, these assays can be used to establish the kinetics of activated GPCR lysosomal trafficking in response to specific ligands, as well as evaluate the contribution of endosomal adaptors to GPCR sorting at MVEs. The protocols presented in this chapter can be adapted to analyze GPCR sorting in a myriad of cell types and tissues, and expanded to analyze the mechanisms that regulate MVE sorting of other cargoes.

Abstract: The goal of this study was to assess the in vitro differentiation capacity of human bone marrow-derived stem cells (hBMSCs) along retinal lineages. Mononuclear cells (MNC) were isolated from bone marrow (BM) and mobilized peripheral blood (mPB) using Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation, and were sorted by magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) for specific stem cell subsets (CD34+CD38+/CD34+CD38−). These cells were then co-cultured on human retinal pigment epithelial cells (hRPE) for 7 days. The expression of stem cell, neural and retina-specific markers was examined by immunostaining, and the gene expression profiles were assessed after FACS separation of the co-cultured hBMSCs by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Furthermore, in vitro functionality of the differentiated cells was analyzed by quantifying phagocytosis of CY5-labeled photoreceptor outer segments (POS). After 7 days of co-culture, hBMSCs adopted an elongated epithelial-like morphology and expressed RPE-specific markers, such as RPE65 and bestrophin. In addition, these differentiated cells were able to phagocytose OS, one of the main characteristics of native RPE cells. Our data demonstrated that human CD34+CD38− hBMSC may differentiate towards an RPE-like cell type in vitro and could become a new type of autologous donor cell for regenerative therapy in retinal degenerative diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The adult prostate possesses a significant regenerative capacity that is of great interest for understanding adult stem cell biology. We demonstrate that leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5) is expressed in a rare population of prostate epithelial progenitor cells, and a castration-resistant Lgr5+ population exists in regressed prostate tissue. Genetic lineage tracing revealed that Lgr5+ cells and their progeny are primarily luminal. Lgr5+ castration-resistant cells are long lived and upon regeneration, both luminal Lgr5+ cells and basal Lgr5+ cells expand. Moreover, single Lgr5+ cells can generate multilineage prostatic structures in renal transplantation assays. Additionally, Lgr5+ cell depletion revealed that the regenerative potential of the castrated adult prostate depends on Lgr5+ cells. Together, these data reveal insights into the cellular hierarchy of castration-resistant Lgr5+ cells, indicate a requirement for Lgr5+ cells during prostatic regeneration, and identify an Lgr5+ adult stem cell population in the prostate.

Abstract: Summary
Colinear HOX expression during hindbrain and spinal cord development diversifies and assigns regional neural phenotypes to discrete rhombomeric and vertebral domains. Despite the precision of HOX patterning in vivo, in vitro approaches for differentiating human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to posterior neural fates coarsely pattern HOX expression thereby generating cultures broadly specified to hindbrain or spinal cord regions. Here, we demonstrate that successive activation of fibroblast growth factor, Wnt/β-catenin, and growth differentiation factor signaling during hPSC differentiation generates stable, homogenous SOX2+/Brachyury+ neuromesoderm that exhibits progressive, full colinear HOX activation over 7 days. Switching to retinoic acid treatment at any point during this process halts colinear HOX activation and transitions the neuromesoderm into SOX2+/PAX6+ neuroectoderm with predictable, discrete HOX gene/protein profiles that can be further differentiated into region-specific cells, e.g., motor neurons. This fully defined approach significantly expands capabilities to derive regional neural phenotypes from diverse hindbrain and spinal cord domains.

Abstract: The quantification of cell traction forces requires three key steps: cell plating on a deformable substrate, measurement of substrate deformation, and the numerical estimation of the corresponding cell traction forces. The computing steps to measure gel deformation and estimate the force field have somehow limited the adoption of this method in cell biology labs. Here we propose a set of ImageJ plug-ins so that every lab equipped with a fluorescent microscope can measure cell traction forces.

Abstract: Summary
During bacterial infections, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signals through the MyD88- and TRIF-dependent pathways to promote pro-inflammatory and interferon (IFN) responses, respectively. Bacteria can inhibit the MyD88 pathway, but if the TRIF pathway is also targeted is unclear. We demonstrate that, in addition to MyD88, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis inhibits TRIF signaling through the type III secretion system effector YopJ. Suppression of TRIF signaling occurs during dendritic cell (DC) and macrophage infection and prevents expression of type I IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokines. YopJ-mediated inhibition of TRIF prevents DCs from inducing natural killer (NK) cell production of antibacterial IFNγ. During infection of DCs, YopJ potently inhibits MAPK pathways but does not prevent activation of IKK- or TBK1-dependent pathways. This singular YopJ activity efficiently inhibits TLR4 transcription-inducing activities, thus illustrating a simple means by which pathogens impede innate immunity.

Abstract: The embryos of echinoids (sea urchins and sand dollars) serve as excellent models for studying cilia differentiation and stages of the cilia life cycle including ciliogenic initiation, growth, maintenance, and retraction. Early in echinoid development, uniform motile cilia form on all cells simultaneously but then rapidly differentiate into multiple cilia types that differ in morphology, motility, and signaling sensitivity. Metal ion treatments that shift germ layer boundaries and thereby “animalize” or “vegetalize” embryos can be used to enrich for low-abundance cilia types rendering those specialized cilia and the differentiation processes they exhibit much easier to study. The experimental advantages of having robust cilia growth and differentiation is tempered by the challenge of restraining ciliated embryos well enough to view the process of ciliogenesis live. We have developed four observation chambers as modifications of the Kiehart chamber for long-term light microscopic imaging of ciliated echinoid embryos. One of these systems employs paramagnetic beads to render ciliated larvae magnetic so they can be gently and reversibly trapped directly under the objective lens. With this magnetic trapping system, the larva can be positioned and repositioned until they achieve the orientation with the clearest view of any cilia of interest. These methods of gentle embryo restraint allow normal embryo development and the normal ciliogenic cycle and ciliary differentiation processes to continue in direct view. Sequential image series can then be collected and analyzed to quantitatively study the wide spectrum of cilia behaviors and properties that arise in developing echinoid embryos.

Abstract: The centrosome and cilium are evolutionarily conserved components of the microtubule cytoskeleton, and act as a cellular signaling center that regulates the activity of numerous developmental signaling pathways. Several genetic syndromes, called the ciliopathies, are associated with defects in the structure or function of the centrosome–cilium complex. In the mammalian kidney, these organelles are found at the apical surface of renal epithelial cells lining the various segments of the nephron, where they relay information from the extracellular environment to the interior of the cell. Cilium-based signaling plays an important role in the development and homeostasis of mammalian kidneys, and ciliary dysfunction is implicated in the pathogenesis of cystic kidney disease. Given the importance of centrosomes and cilia in renal function, techniques used to visualize these organelles, analyze their composition, and test their functionality have become essential in many studies of kidney development and disease. Fluorescence microscopy is a powerful, widely used technique that has enhanced our understanding of molecular mechanisms that regulate the assembly, maintenance, and function of these organelles in various organs. Here, we present detailed steps for the isolation of kidneys from adult and embryonic mice, describe protocols to label centrosomes and cilia in renal tissues, and methods used to culture and image kidneys ex vivo.

Abstract: Primary cilia are signaling organelles that have been shown to coordinate cellular responses to extracellular cues during physiological processes ranging from organ patterning to cell cycle regulation. A variety of receptors, including G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), downstream effectors (adenylyl cyclases), and second messengers, such as calcium, accumulate in the ciliary compartment. Isolation of GPCRs is essential for studying posttranslational modifications, intracellular trafficking, and protein–protein interactions that are important in downstream signaling. However, the presence of multiple hydrophobic transmembrane domains, and the inherent conformational flexibility of GPCRs make their extraction from membranes and solubilization particularly challenging. Here, we describe detailed methods for immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation of GPCRs from whole cell extracts. These methods are applicable for studying other multipass transmembrane proteins (such as adenylyl cyclases). We also describe methods for determining GPCR phosphorylation, surface labeling by biotinylation, and cross-linking to detect transient interactions with other proteins. These methods are amenable for studying both ciliary and nonciliary GPCRs in the context of cellular signaling pathways.

Abstract: Malignant skin melanoma is one of the most deadly human cancers. Extracellular matrix (ECM) influences the growth of malignant tumors by modulating tumor cells adhesion and migration. Hyaluronan is an essential component of the ECM, and its amount is altered in many tumors, suggesting an important role for hyaluronan in tumorigenesis. Nonetheless its role in melanomagenesis is not understood. In this study we produced a MV3 melanoma cell line with inducible expression of the hyaluronan synthase 3 (HAS3) and studied its effect on the behavior of the melanoma cells. HAS3 overexpression expanded the cell surface hyaluronan coat and decreased melanoma cell adhesion, migration and proliferation by cell cycle arrest at G1/G0. Melanoma cell migration was restored by removal of cell surface hyaluronan by Streptomyces hyaluronidase and by receptor blocking with hyaluronan oligosaccharides, while the effect on cell proliferation was receptor independent. Overexpression of HAS3 decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation suggesting that inhibition of MAP-kinase signaling was responsible for these suppressive effects on the malignant phenotype of MV3 melanoma cells.

Abstract: The intracellular positioning of both lysosomes and mitochondria meets the requirements of degradation and energy supply, which are respectively the two major functions for cellular maintenance. The positioning of both lysosomes and mitochondria is apparently affected by the nutrient status of the cells. However, the mechanism coordinating the positioning of the organelles has not been sufficiently elucidated. Lysosome-associated membrane proteins-1 and -2 (LAMP-1 and LAMP-2) are highly glycosylated proteins that are abundant in lysosomal membranes. In the present study, we demonstrated that the siRNA-mediated downregulation of LAMP-1, LAMP-2 or their combination enhanced the perinuclear localization of mitochondria, in the pre-osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1. On the other hand, in the osteocytic cell line MLO-Y4, in which both the lysosomes and mitochondria originally accumulate in the perinuclear region and mitochondria also fill dendrites, the effect of siRNA of LAMP-1 or LAMP-2 was barely observed. LAMPs are not directly associated with mitochondria, and there do not seem to be any accessory molecules commonly required to recruit the motor proteins to lysosomes and mitochondria. Our results suggest that LAMPs may regulate the positioning of lysosomes and mitochondria. A possible mechanism involving the indirect and context-dependent action of LAMPs is discussed.

Abstract: Summary
Receptor interacting protein kinase-3 (RIP3) is an essential kinase for necroptotic cell death signaling and has been implicated in antiviral cell death signaling upon DNA virus infection. Here, we performed high-throughput RNAi screening and identified RIP3 as a positive regulator of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB) replication in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). RIP3 regulates autophagy, a process utilized by CVB for viral replication factory assembly, and depletion of RIP3 inhibits autophagic flux and leads to the accumulation of autophagosomes and amphisomes. Additionally, later in infection, RIP3 is cleaved by the CVB-encoded cysteine protease 3Cpro, which serves to abrogate RIP3-mediated necrotic signaling and induce a nonnecrotic form of cell death. Taken together, our results show that temporal targeting of RIP3 allows CVB to benefit from its roles in regulating autophagy while inhibiting the induction of necroptotic cell death.

Abstract: The microscopic nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) serves as an excellent animal model for studying membrane traffic. This is due in part to its highly advanced genetics and genomics, and a transparent body that allows the visualization of fluorescently tagged molecules in the physiologically relevant context of the intact organism. Notably, C. elegans oocytes, coelomocytes, and intestinal epithelia have been established as facile cellular models to explore nonpolarized and polarized cell membrane trafficking mechanisms. In this chapter, we describe in vivo C. elegans assays, utilizing fluorescent dyes or proteins, to examine the molecular mechanisms that control endocytosis and endocytic recycling. Tissue-specific, steady-state imaging and associated quantitative analysis allow the identification and interpretation of subcellular events in the intact animal. To better understand the kinetic characteristics of recycling tubules that mediate membrane protein recycling, we describe recently developed dynamic-imaging assays in intestinal epithelial cells. Such methods bring new clarity to the system, helping to elucidate the functional roles of recycling mediators.

Abstract: The survival rate for patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) has not seen marked improvement in recent decades despite enhanced efforts in prevention and the introduction of novel therapies. We have reported that pharmacological exacerbation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) is an effective approach to killing OSCC cells. The UPR is executed via distinct signaling cascades whereby an initial attempt to restore folding homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum during stress is complemented by an apoptotic response if the defect cannot be resolved. To identify novel small molecules able to overwhelm the adaptive capacity of the UPR in OSCC cells, we engineered a complementary cell-based assay to screen a broad spectrum of chemical matter. Stably transfected CHO-K1 cells that individually report (luciferase) on the PERK/eIF2α/ATF4/CHOP (apoptotic) or the IRE1/XBP1 (adaptive) UPR pathways, were engineered [1]. The triterpenoids dihydrocelastrol and celastrol were identified as potent inducers of UPR signaling and cell death in a primary screen and confirmed in a panel of OSCC cells and other cancer cell lines. Biochemical and genetic assays using OSCC cells and modified murine embryonic fibroblasts demonstrated that intact PERK-eIF2–ATF4-CHOP signaling is required for pro-apoptotic UPR and OSCC death following celastrol treatment.

Abstract: In cell culture, many adherent mammalian cells undergo substantial actin cytoskeleton rearrangement prior to mitosis as they detach from the extracellular matrix and become spherical. At the end of mitosis, the actin cytoskeleton is required for cytokinesis and the reassembly of interphase structures as cells spread and reattach to substrate. To understand the processes regulating mitotic cytoskeletal remodeling, we studied how mitotic phosphorylation regulates filamin A (FLNa). FLNa is an actin-crosslinking protein that was previously identified as a cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) binding partner and substrate in vitro. Using quantitative label-based mass spectrometry, we find that FLNa serines 1084, 1459 and 1533 are phosphorylated in mitotic HeLa cells and all three sites match the phosphorylation consensus sequence of Cdk1. To investigate the functional role of mitotic FLNa phosphorylation, we mutated serines 1084, 1459 and 1533 to nonphosphorylatable alanine residues and expressed GFP-tagged FLNaS1084A,S1459A,S1533A (FLNa-AAA GFP) in a FLNa-deficient human melanoma cell line called M2. M2 cells expressing FLNa-AAA GFP have enhanced FLNa-AAA GFP and actin localization at sites of contact between daughter cells, impaired post-mitotic daughter cell separation and defects in cell migration. Therefore, mitotic phosphorylation of FLNa is important for successful cell division and interphase cell behavior.

Abstract: Leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains 1 (LRIG1) is a pan-negative regulator of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway. The aim of this study was to investigate the underlying mechanism of LRIG1 in the regulation of vasculogenic mimicry (VM) formation in glioma cells. We constructed an enhanced green fluorescent protein plasmid (pEGFP) system, pEGFP-C1-LRIG1, for overexpression of LRIG1, and transfected it into human glioma cell line SHG-44. Under hypoxic conditions induced by CoCl2, we investigated the effects of LRIG1 overexpression on VM formation and VM-dependent malignant behaviors including migration, invasion, and proliferation. Additionally, we explored the effects of LRIG1 on the expression levels of major components of the EGFR/PI3K/AKT pathway as well as E-cadherin and vimentin. We found that LRIG1 overexpression is able to inhibit hypoxia-induced VM formation, migration, invasion, and proliferation. Furthermore, LRIG1 overexpression counteracts hypoxia-induced increase in the expression of phosphorylated EGFR (pEGFR), PI3K (pPI3K), and AKT (pAKT) and reverts hypoxia-induced alteration in E-cadherin and vimentin expression levels. In LRIG1 knockdown SHG-44 cells, however, hypoxia-induced VM formation and alteration in E-cadherin and vimentin expression levels were exacerbated. These results suggest that the inhibitory effects of LRIG1 are most likely mediated by suppression of the EGFR/PI3K/AKT pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Our findings provide compelling evidence implicating LRIG1 in glioma pathophysiology, suggesting that gene therapy using LRIG1 may serve as a treatment for this disease.

Abstract: Neuroblasts represent the predominant migrating cell type in the adult mouse brain. There are, however, increasing evidences of migration of other neural precursors. This work aims at identifying in vivo endogenous early neural precursors, different from neuroblasts, able to migrate in response to brain injuries. The monoclonal antibody Nilo1, which unequivocally identifies type B astrocytes and embryonic radial glia, was coupled to magnetic glyconanoparticles (mGNPs). Here we show that Nilo1–mGNPs in combination with magnetic resonance imaging in living mice allowed the in vivo identification of endogenous type B astrocytes at their niche, as well as their migration to the lesion site in response to glioblastoma, demyelination, cryolesion or mechanical injuries. In addition, Nilo1+ adult radial glia-like structures were identified at the lesion site a few hours after damage. For all damage models used, type B astrocyte migration was fast and orderly. Identification of Nilo1+ cells surrounding an induced glioblastoma was also possible after intraperitoneal injection of the antibody. This opens up the possibility of an early identification of the initial damage site(s) after brain insults, by the migration of type B astrocytes.

Abstract: Adult mammary stem cells have been identified in several species including the bovine. They are responsible for the development of the gland and for cyclic remodeling during estrous cycles and pregnancy. Epithelial cell subpopulations exist within the mammary gland. We and others showed previously that the Colony Forming Cell (CFC) assay can be used to detect lineage-restricted mammary progenitors. We carried out CFCs with bovine mammary cells and manually separated colonies with specific morphologies associated with either a luminal or a myoepithelial phenotype. Expression of specific markers was assessed by immunocytochemistry or by flow cytometry to confirm that the manual separation resulted in isolation of phenotipically different cells. When transplanted in recipient immunodeficient mice, we found that only myoepithelial-like colonies gave rise to outgrowths that resembled bovine mammary alveoli, thus proving that adult stem cells were maintained during culture and segregated with myoepithelial cells. After recovery of the cells from the transplanted mice and subsequent progenitor content analysis, we found a tendency to detect a higher progenitor frequency when myoepithelial-like colonies were transplanted. We here demonstrate that bovine adult mammary stem cells can be sustained in short-term culture and that they can be enriched by manually selecting for basal-like morphology.

Abstract: Aging is associated with increased inflammation and reduced hippocampal neurogenesis, which may in turn contribute to cognitive impairment. Taurine is a free amino acid found in numerous diets, with anti-inflammatory properties. Although abundant in the young brain, the decrease in taurine concentration with age may underlie reduced neurogenesis. Here, we assessed the effect of taurine on hippocampal neurogenesis in middle-aged mice. We found that taurine increased cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus through the activation of quiescent stem cells, resulting in increased number of stem cells and intermediate neural progenitors. Taurine had a direct effect on stem/progenitor cells proliferation, as observed in vitro, and also reduced activated microglia. Furthermore, taurine increased the survival of newborn neurons, resulting in a net increase in adult neurogenesis. Together, these results show that taurine increases several steps of adult neurogenesis and support a beneficial role of taurine on hippocampal neurogenesis in the context of brain aging.

Abstract: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is increasing its application in life sciences for electron density measurements of ultrathin sections. These are traditionally analyzed with transmission electron microscopy (TEM); by most labs, SEM analysis still is associated with surface imaging only. Here we report several advantages of SEM for thin sections over TEM, both for structural inspection, as well as analyzing immuno-targeted labels such as quantum dots (QDs) and gold, where we find that QD-labeling is ten times more efficient than gold-labeling. Furthermore, we find that omitting post-staining with uranyl and lead leads to QDs readily detectable over the ultrastructure, but under these conditions ultrastructural contrast was even almost invisible in TEM examination. Importantly, imaging in SEM with STEM detection leads to both outstanding QDs and ultrastructural contrast. STEM imaging is superior over back-scattered electron imaging of these non-contrasted samples, whereas secondary electron detection cannot be used at all. We conclude that examination of ultrathin sections by SEM, which may be immunolabeled with QDs, will allow rapid and straightforward analysis of large fields with more efficient labeling than can be achieved with immunogold. The large fields of view routinely achieved with SEM, but not with TEM, allows straightforward raw data sharing using virtual microscopy, also known as nanotomy when this concerns EM data in the life sciences.

Abstract: Summary
Embryonic stem cells hold great promise for various diseases because of their unlimited capacity for self-renewal and ability to differentiate into any cell type in the body. However, despite over 3 decades of research, there have been no reports on the safety and potential efficacy of pluripotent stem cell progeny in Asian patients with any disease. Here, we report the safety and tolerability of subretinal transplantation of human embryonic-stem-cell (hESC)-derived retinal pigment epithelium in four Asian patients: two with dry age-related macular degeneration and two with Stargardt macular dystrophy. They were followed for 1 year. There was no evidence of adverse proliferation, tumorigenicity, ectopic tissue formation, or other serious safety issues related to the transplanted cells. Visual acuity improved 9–19 letters in three patients and remained stable (+1 letter) in one patient. The results confirmed that hESC-derived cells could serve as a potentially safe new source for regenerative medicine.

Abstract: Summary
The PfEMP1 family of surface proteins is central for Plasmodium falciparum virulence and must retain the ability to bind to host receptors while also diversifying to aid immune evasion. The interaction between CIDRα1 domains of PfEMP1 and endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) is associated with severe childhood malaria. We combine crystal structures of CIDRα1:EPCR complexes with analysis of 885 CIDRα1 sequences, showing that the EPCR-binding surfaces of CIDRα1 domains are conserved in shape and bonding potential, despite dramatic sequence diversity. Additionally, these domains mimic features of the natural EPCR ligand and can block this ligand interaction. Using peptides corresponding to the EPCR-binding region, antibodies can be purified from individuals in malaria-endemic regions that block EPCR binding of diverse CIDRα1 variants. This highlights the extent to which such a surface protein family can diversify while maintaining ligand-binding capacity and identifies features that should be mimicked in immunogens to prevent EPCR binding.

Abstract: Summary
The outcome of the interaction between Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and a macrophage depends on the interplay between host defense and bacterial immune subversion mechanisms. MicroRNAs critically regulate several host defense mechanisms, but their role in the Mtb-macrophage interplay remains unclear. MicroRNA profiling of Mtb-infected macrophages revealed the downregulation of miR-let-7f in a manner dependent on the Mtb secreted effector ESAT-6. We establish that let-7f targets A20, a feedback inhibitor of the NF-κB pathway. Expression of let-7f decreases and A20 increases with progression of Mtb infection in mice. Mtb survival is attenuated in A20-deficient macrophages, and the production of TNF, IL-1β, and nitrite, which are mediators of immunity to Mtb, is correspondingly increased. Further, let-7f overexpression diminishes Mtb survival and augments the production of cytokines including TNF and IL-1β. These results uncover a role for let-7f and its target A20 in regulating immune responses to Mtb and controlling bacterial burden.

Abstract: In vitro reconstitution of simplified biological systems from molecular parts has proven to be a powerful method for investigating the biochemical and biophysical principles underlying cellular processes. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in reconstitution of protein–membrane interactions to understand the critical role played by membranes in organizing molecular-scale events into micron-scale patterns and protrusions. However, while all reconstitution experiments depend on identifying and isolating an essential set of soluble biomolecules, such as proteins, DNA, and RNA, reconstitution of membrane-based processes involves the additional challenge of forming and working with lipid bilayer membranes with composition, fluidity, and mechanical properties appropriate for the process at hand. Here we discuss a selection of methods for forming synthetic lipid bilayer membranes and present a versatile electroformation protocol that our lab uses for reconstituting proteins on giant unilamellar vesicles. This synthetic membrane-based approach to reconstitution offers the ability to study protein organization and activity at membranes under more cell-like conditions, addressing a central challenge to accomplishing the grand goal of “building the cell.”

Abstract: Endocytic recycling represents a major mechanism for continuous supply of molecules to the plasma membrane. Particularly, outbound trafficking of the recycling endosome (RE) or RE-derived vesicles can be upregulated by cellular signaling, through mobilization of specialized protein complexes acting as transport machineries. Therefore, biochemical and functional characterization of cell signaling molecules that operate multimeric protein complexes in membrane transport provides important insights to signaling-regulated trafficking events. In this chapter, we described biochemical approaches and reporter assays in differentiated adipocytes to determine the activity and function of the small GTPase RalA, which relays upstream insulin signaling to the exocyst complex that targets intracellular vesicles bearing the Glut4 transporter to the plasma membrane. The experimental design outlined in this chapter can be applied to other regulated transport events facilitated by the exocyst complex, as well as other GTPases that operate distinct transport complexes in specific physiological settings.

Abstract: Macrophages are phagocytic cells that constitute the primary barrier against microbial infection. However, the frequency of this interaction has likely led to the selection and retention of specific strategies to subvert the antimicrobial behavior of these cells. Many intracellular pathogens manipulate their host macrophages, in order to survive, avoid degradation and immune recognition. Much of the antimicrobial defenses mobilized by the macrophage function through the lysosomal compartment and it is the subversion of these mechanisms that are the target of many pathogenic microbes. To investigate the potential manipulation of lysosomal function by infectious agents, the protocols provided here describe a wide range of techniques developed to study various lysosome functions, ranging from phagosome–lysosome fusion to a panel of hydrolytic activities. The suitability of various protocols for specific contexts is addressed. In addition to providing detailed methods for the elucidation of lysosome function and their applications to microbial infections, approaches are also discussed for developing new protocols that would complement our knowledge of microbial manipulation of lysosome functions. The continued technical evolution of these methods is central to increasing our understanding of host–pathogen interactions and cell biology in general.

Abstract: Summary
Androgens are widely used for treating Fanconi anemia (FA) and other human bone marrow failure syndromes, but their mode of action remains incompletely understood. Aged Fancd2−/− mice were used to assess the therapeutic efficacy of oxymetholone (OXM) and its mechanism of action. Eighteen-month-old Fancd2−/− mice recapitulated key human FA phenotypes, including reduced bone marrow cellularity, red cell macrocytosis, and peripheral pancytopenia. As in humans, chronic OXM treatment significantly improved these hematological parameters and stimulated the proliferation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. RNA-Seq analysis implicated downregulation of osteopontin as an important potential mechanism for the drug’s action. Consistent with the increased stem cell proliferation, competitive repopulation assays demonstrated that chronic OXM therapy eventually resulted in stem cell exhaustion. These results expand our knowledge of the regulation of hematopoietic stem cell proliferation and have direct clinical implications for the treatment of bone marrow failure.

Abstract: Neuroblastoma, a malignancy of multipotent embryonic neural crest cells, is the most common extracranial solid cancer in childhood and most common cancer in infancy. Cellular phenotype has been shown to be an important determinant of the malignant potential in human neuroblastoma cells and tumors. Whereas neuroblastic (N-type) are moderately malignant and nonneuronal (S-type) cells are nonmalignant, I-type stem cells are highly tumorigenic, irrespective of N-myc amplification status. In the present study, we sought to determine which genes were overexpressed in the I-type cells which might characterize and maintain the stem cell state and/or malignancy of human neuroblastoma cancer stem cells. We used a microarray platform to compare the steady-state expression levels of mRNAs from 13 human neuroblastoma cell lines representing the three cellular phenotypes. Using qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses, we identified seven genes whose expression is consistently elevated exclusively in neuroblastoma cancer stem cells: CD133, KIT, NOTCH1, GPRC5C, PIGF2, TRKB, and LNGFR. Moreover, we show that the genes are phenotype specific, as differentiation of I-type BE(2)-C cells to either an N- or S-type morphology results in significantly reduced mRNA expression. Finally, we show that NOTCH1 plays an important role in maintaining the stem cell phenotype. The identification and characterization of these genes, elevated in highly malignant neuroblastoma stem cells, could provide the basis for developing novel therapies for treatment of this lethal childhood cancer.

Abstract: The effects of reactive oxygen species on cells have attracted considerable attention in relation to oxidative stress and related disorders. Superoxide (O2−) is the primary reactive oxygen species formed in animals as a byproduct or purposeful product of enzymes. We recently established an O2−-generating nanodevice that produces O2− continuously even in culture medium, by improving an original nanodevice. The new nanodevice, named Device II, efficiently induced cell death in Caco-2 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Catalase largely recovered the cell viability, while superoxide dismutase rather lowered the viability. Flow cytometric and fluorescence microscopic analyses revealed that phosphatidylserine was exposed on the cells and that caspase-3 was activated in the cells after treatment with Device II. These findings indicated that exogenously added O2− caused apoptosis in Caco-2 cells through its derivative H2O2.

Abstract: Environmental influences and insults by reproductive toxicant exposure can lead to impaired spermatogenesis or infertility. Understanding how toxicants disrupt spermatogenesis is critical for determining how environmental factors contribute to impaired fertility. While current animal models are available, understanding of the reproductive toxic effects on human fertility requires a more robust model system. We recently demonstrated that human pluripotent stem cells can differentiate into spermatogonial stem cells/spermatogonia, primary and secondary spermatocytes, and haploid spermatids; a model that mimics many aspects of human spermatogenesis. Here, using this model system, we examine the effects of 2-bromopropane (2-BP) and 1,2,dibromo-3-chloropropane (DBCP) on in vitro human spermatogenesis. 2-BP and DBCP are non-endocrine disrupting toxicants that are known to impact male fertility. We show that acute treatment with either 2-BP or DBCP induces a reduction in germ cell viability through apoptosis. 2-BP and DBCP affect viability of different cell populations as 2-BP primarily reduces spermatocyte viability, whereas DBCP exerts a much greater effect on spermatogonia. Acute treatment with 2-BP or DBCP also reduces the percentage of haploid spermatids. Both 2-BP and DBCP induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation leading to an oxidized cellular environment. Taken together, these results suggest that acute exposure with 2-BP or DBCP causes human germ cell death in vitro by inducing ROS formation. This system represents a unique platform for assessing human reproductive toxicity potential of various environmental toxicants in a rapid, efficient, and unbiased format.

Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid induces ROS-mediated cleavage of HSP90 in leukemia cells,

Abstract: Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is a molecular chaperone that supports stability of client proteins. We found that HSP90 was cleaved to 55 kDa protein after treatment with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors including suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) in several leukemia cell lines. We further analyzed molecular changes induced by SAHA in K562 cells. The SAHA-induced cleavage of HSP90 was blocked by a pan-caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk, implying that the process is dependent on caspase activity. However, the experiments using antagonistic and agonistic Fas antibodies revealed that the cleavage of HSP90 was not dependent on Fas signaling. SAHA induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the cleavage of HSP90 was blocked by a ROS scavenger N-acetylcystein (NAC). We also confirmed that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) induced cleavage of HSP90 in a similar manner. Caspase 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 10 were activated by treatment with SAHA, and the activities were reduced by the pretreatment of NAC. Treatment of the cells with caspase 10 inhihitor, but not other inhibitors of caspases activated by SAHA, prevented cleavage of HSP90 by SAHA. SAHA-induced ROS generation and HSP90 cleavage were dependent on newly synthesized unknown proteins. Taken together, our results suggest that the cleavage of HSP90 by SAHA is mediated by ROS generation and caspase 10 activation. HSP90 cleavage may provide an additional mechanism involved in anti-cancer effects of HDAC inhibitors.

Abstract: Summary
The utility of stem cells and their progeny in adult transplantation models has been limited by poor survival and integration. We designed an injectable and bioresorbable hydrogel blend of hyaluronan and methylcellulose (HAMC) and tested it with two cell types in two animal models, thereby gaining an understanding of its general applicability for enhanced cell distribution, survival, integration, and functional repair relative to conventional cell delivery in saline. HAMC improves cell survival and integration of retinal stem cell (RSC)-derived rods in the retina. The pro-survival mechanism of HAMC is ascribed to the interaction of the CD44 receptor with HA. Transient disruption of the retinal outer limiting membrane, combined with HAMC delivery, results in significantly improved rod survival and visual function. HAMC also improves the distribution, viability, and functional repair of neural stem and progenitor cells (NSCs). The HAMC delivery system improves cell transplantation efficacy in two CNS models, suggesting broad applicability.

Abstract: Sorting of cargoes in endosomes occurs through their concentration into sorting platforms, called microdomains, from which transport intermediates are formed. The WASH complex localizes to such endosomal microdomains and triggers localized branched actin nucleation by activating the Arp2/3 complex. These branched actin networks are required for both the lateral compartmentalization of endosome membranes into distinct microdomains and for the fission of transport intermediates from these sorting platforms. In this chapter, we provide experimental protocols to study these two aspects of WASH physiology. We first describe how to image the dynamic membrane tubules resulting from the defects of WASH-mediated fission. We then describe how to study quantitatively the microdomain localization of WASH in live and fixed cells. Since microdomains are below the resolution limit of conventional light-microscopy techniques, this required the development of specific image analysis pipelines, which are detailed. The guidelines presented in this chapter can apply to other endomembrane microdomains beyond WASH in order to increase our understanding of trafficking in molecular and quantitative terms.

Abstract: Recycling endosomes (REs) form an extensive and complex network of subcompartmentalized vesicular and tubular elements that connect with the cell surface and other endosomes in macrophages. As surveillance and defense cells of the innate immune system, macrophages are highly dependent on REs for their active and voluminous cell surface turnover and endocytic, exocytic, and recycling of membrane and cargo. Here we set out three approaches for imaging and analyzing REs in macrophages, based on the expression of fluorescently labeled RE-associated proteins and the uptake of fluorescent cargo. Subcompartments of the REs are identified by co-expression and co-localization analysis of RE associated Rab GTPases. Transferrin is a well-known cargo marker as it recycles through REs and it is compared here to other cargo, revealing how different endocytic routes intersect with REs. We show how the movement of transferrin through REs can be modeled and quantified in live cells. Finally, since phagosomes are a signature organelle for macrophages, and REs fuse with the maturing phagosome, we show imaging of REs with phagosomes using a genetically encoded pH-sensitive SNARE-based probe. Together these approaches provide multiple ways to comprehensively analyze REs and the important roles they play in these immune cells and more broadly in other cell types.

Abstract: Summary
Primordial germ cells (PGCs) are lineage-restricted unipotent cells that can dedifferentiate into pluripotent embryonic germ cells (EGCs). Here we performed whole-transcriptome analysis during the conversion of PGCs into EGCs, a process by which cells acquire pluripotency. To examine the molecular mechanism underlying this conversion, we focused on Blimp-1 and Akt, which are involved in PGC specification and dedifferentiation, respectively. Blimp-1 overexpression in embryonic stem cells suppressed the expression of downstream targets of the pluripotency network. Conversely, Blimp-1 deletion in PGCs accelerated their dedifferentiation into pluripotent EGCs, illustrating that Blimp-1 is a pluripotency gatekeeper protein in PGCs. AKT signaling showed a synergistic effect with basic fibroblast growth factor plus 2i+A83 treatment on EGC formation. AKT played a major role in suppressing genes regulated by MBD3. From these results, we defined the distinct functions of Blimp-1 and Akt and provided mechanistic insights into the acquisition of pluripotency in PGCs.

MitoGraph is optimized and validated for quantifying the volume of tubular mitochondrial networks in budding yeast. We therefore include the experimental protocol, microscopy conditions, and software parameters focusing on mitochondria in budding yeast. However, MitoGraph can also be applied to mitochondria in other cell types and possibly other intracellular structures. We begin with our protocol and then include substantial discussion of the validation, requirements, and limits of MitoGraph to aid a wide range of potential users in applying MitoGraph to their data and troubleshooting any potential problems that arise.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of methionine on cell proliferation, antioxidant activity, apoptosis, the expression levels of related genes (HSF-1, HSP70, Bax and Bcl-2) and the expression levels of protein (HSP70) in mammary epithelial cells, after heat treatment. Methionine (60 mg/L) increased the viability and attenuated morphological damage in hyperthermia-treated bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs). Additionally, methionine significantly reduced lactate dehydrogenase leakage, malondialdehyde formation, nitric oxide, and nitric oxide synthase activity. Superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase enzymatic activity was increased significantly in the presence of methionine. Bovine mammary epithelial cells also exhibited a certain amount of HSP70 reserve after methionine pretreatment for 24 h, and the expression level of the HSP70 gene and protein further increased with incubation at 42°C for 30 min. Compared to the control, the expression of HSF-1 mRNA increased, and there was a significantly reduced expression of Bax/Bcl-2 mRNA and a reduced activity of caspase-3 against heat stress. Methionine also increased survival and decreased early apoptosis of hyperthermia-treated BMECs. Thus, methionine has cytoprotective effects on hyperthermia-induced damage in BMECs.

Abstract: Recent data indicate that serum Hsp70 (HSPA1A) levels are increased in type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus. However, there is no report in the literature on circulating Hsp70 levels in gestational diabetes mellitus. In this pilot study, we measured serum Hsp70 levels in 11 pregnant women with pregestational diabetes, 38 women with gestational diabetes, and 40 healthy pregnant women with ELISA. Plasma glucose levels, serum insulin concentrations, HbA1c values, and the Homeostatic Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) index were also determined. According to our results, serum Hsp70 concentrations were significantly higher in women with pregestational and gestational diabetes mellitus than in healthy pregnant women. In addition, pregestational diabetic women had significantly higher Hsp70 levels than those with gestational diabetes. Furthermore, in the group of women with gestational diabetes mellitus, serum Hsp70 levels showed a significant positive correlation with HbA1c values. However, there was no other relationship between clinical features and metabolic parameters of the study subjects and their serum Hsp70 levels in either study group. In conclusion, we demonstrated for the first time in the literature that serum Hsp70 levels are increased and correlate with HbA1c values in women with gestational diabetes mellitus. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to determine whether circulating Hsp70 plays a causative role in the pathogenesis of gestational diabetes or elevated serum Hsp70 levels are only consequences of the disease.

Abstract: The effect of acidosis, a biochemical hallmark of the tumor microenvironment, on cancer progression and metastasis is complex. Both pro- and anti-tumorigenic effects of acidosis have been reported and the acidic microenvironment has been exploited for specific delivery of drugs, imaging agents, and genetic constructs into tumors. In this study we investigate the spreading and focal adhesion of B16F10 melanoma cells that are genetically engineered to overexpress the pH-sensing G protein-coupled receptor GPR4. By using cell attachment assays we found that GPR4 overexpression delayed cell spreading and altered the spatial localization of dynamic focal adhesion complex, such as the localization of phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin, at acidic pH. The potential G-protein and downstream signaling pathways that are responsible for these effects were also investigated. By using the Rho inhibitor CT04 (C3 transferase), the Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibitors Y27632 and thiazovivin, the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) inhibitor staurosporine or a G12/13 inhibitory construct, cell spreading was restored whereas the inhibition and activation of the Gq and Gs pathways had little or no effect. Altogether our results indicate that through the G12/13/Rho signaling pathway GPR4 modulates focal adhesion dynamics and reduces cell spreading and membrane ruffling.

Abstract: Excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and tissue contraction after injury can lead to esthetic and functional problems. Fibroblasts and myofibroblasts activated by transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 play a key role in these processes. The persistence of (myo)fibroblasts and their excessive ECM production and continuous wound contraction have been linked to pathological scarring. The identification of compounds reducing myofibroblast survival and function may thus offer promising therapeutic strategies to optimize impaired wound healing. The plant-derived polyphenol curcumin has shown promising results as a wound healing therapeutic in vivo; however, the exact mechanism is still unclear. In vitro, curcumin induces apoptosis in various cell types via a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent mechanism. Here we treated human dermal fibroblasts with TGF-β1 to induce myofibroblast differentiation, and compared the responses of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts to 25µM curcumin. Curcumin induced caspase-independent apoptosis in both fibroblasts and myofibroblasts in a ROS-dependent manner. Oxidative stress leads to the induction of several antioxidant systems to regain cellular homeostasis. We detected stress-induced induction of heme oxygenase (HO)-1 in fibroblasts but not in myofibroblasts following curcumin exposure. Instead, myofibroblasts expressed higher levels of heat shock protein (HSP)72 compared to fibroblasts in response to curcumin, suggesting that TGF-β1 treatment alters the stress-responses of the cells. However, we did not detect any differences in curcumin toxicity between the two populations. The differential stress responses in fibroblasts and myofibroblasts may open new therapeutic approaches to reduce myofibroblasts and scarring.

Abstract: Biomarkers are important tools in medicine, which can be used for monitoring disease progression and response to therapy. One of the main problems in rare lysosomal storage diseases is that there are over 70 different diseases, all with different biochemical storage profiles. Developing biochemical biomarkers therefore requires an individual assay per disease/subgroup of diseases. An alternative approach is to develop an assay that is independent of the specific macromolecules stored. This chapter discusses an assay that may serve as a universal biomarker for these diseases and measures the expansion of the late endosomal/lysosomal system. We have developed an assay that takes advantage of a commercially available late endosomal/lysosomal probe, LysoTracker, which becomes trapped in the acidic compartment of cells and emits a fluorescent signal that can be detected using flow cytometry. In this chapter, we detail the methodology behind this assay and discuss the factors that need to be considered when establishing this assay in clinical and research settings.

Abstract: The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is responsible for most of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, whether HBV plays an important role during hepatocarcinogenesis through effecting miRNAs remains unknown. Here, we reported that HBV up-regulated microRNA-181a (miR-181a) by enhancing its promoter activity. Simultaneously, we found that miR-181a inhibited apoptosis in vitro and promoted tumor cell growth in vivo. TNF receptor superfamily member 6 (Fas) was further identified as a target of miR-181a. We also found that Fas could reverse the apoptosis-inhibition effect induced by miR-181a. Moreover, HBV could inhibit cell apoptosis by down-regulating Fas expression, which could be reversed by miR-181a inhibitor. Our data demonstrated that HBV suppressed apoptosis of hepatoma cells by up-regulating miR-181a expression and down-regulating Fas expression, which may provide a new understanding of the mechanism in HBV-related HCC pathogenesis.

Abstract: Terrestrial snails which live under dry and hot conditions need efficient mechanisms of adaptation to counteract the problems of desiccation and over-heating. A profoundly heat tolerant snail species is the Mediterranean Xeropicta derbentina, exhibiting different shell colour morphs ranging from pale white to darkly banded. Considering that dark-pigmented snails are believed to have a disadvantage due to faster heating, we investigated possible differences in the stress markers Hsp70 and lipid peroxideation between four pre-defined colour morphs which were exposed to different temperatures for eight hours. The highest Hsp70 levels were observed in response to 38-40 °C. Levels decreased when this temperature was exceeded. Snails of a pre-defined colour category 3 (with a large black band at the umbilicus side of the shell) showed the most prominent Hsp70 response. Lipid peroxideation levels also showed a maximum at 38°C but displayed a second peak at rather high temperatures at which the Hsp70 level already had decreased (45-48 °C). Particularly pure white snails (category 1) and the most pigmented ones (category 4) were found to have different levels of lipid peroxidation at 38°C and 45°C compared to the other morphs. A hypothesis involving a combined two-phase defence mechanism, to which both, the Hsp70 protection system and the antioxidant defence system, may contribute, is discussed.

Abstract: Heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) is one of the most important chaperone proteins that modulates smooth muscle contraction. Here we investigated the effects of HSP27 expression on cytoskeleton dynamics and contractile function of human bladder smooth muscle cells (BSMCs) in vitro. Cultured human BSMCs were transfected with lentiviral vectors expressing either HSP27 or HSP27-siRNAs. Normal BSMCs cells and cells transfected with the empty lentivirus were used as control. Cells were then cultured on Flexcell flexible membrane dishes and mechanical stretch (14.8% elongation) was applied. The stretch caused significant disruption of actin cytoskeletal structure and decrease in F/G-actin ratio in BSMCs with HSP27 over-expression, knock-down and control groups (P<0.05) as indicated by phalloidin-FITC staining. It was also shown that the structure of actin filaments in HSP27 over-expressed cells recovered and F/G-actin ratio significantly increased at 12h after stretching compared to unstretched cells (P<0.05), but not in HSP27 knock-down cells, suggesting that HSP27 promoted the recovery of cytoskeletal structure in BSMCs from stretch-induced injury. In addition, the contractile force of BSMCs was enhanced by over-expression of HSP27 and attenuated by knock-down of HSP27 (P<0.05), suggesting a pivotal role of HSP27 in regulating bladder smooth muscle contraction.

Abstract: Summary
Fungal infections remain a threat due to the lack of broad-spectrum fungal vaccines and protective antigens. Recent studies showed that attenuated Blastomyces dermatitidis confers protection via T cell recognition of an unknown but conserved antigen. Using transgenic CD4+ T cells recognizing this antigen, we identify an amino acid determinant within the chaperone calnexin that is conserved across diverse fungal ascomycetes. Calnexin, typically an ER protein, also localizes to the surface of yeast, hyphae, and spores. T cell epitope mapping unveiled a 13-residue sequence conserved across Ascomycota. Infection with divergent ascomycetes, including dimorphic fungi, opportunistic molds, and the agent causing white nose syndrome in bats, induces expansion of calnexin-specific CD4+ T cells. Vaccine delivery of calnexin in glucan particles induces fungal antigen-specific CD4+ T cell expansion and resistance to lethal challenge with multiple fungal pathogens. Thus, the immunogenicity and conservation of calnexin make this fungal protein a promising vaccine target.

Abstract: Endolysosomes are emerging as key players that generate as well as respond to intracellular Ca2+ signals. The role of Ca2+ in modulating acidic organelle function has long been recognized, but it is now emerging that acidic organelles also act as intracellular Ca2+ stores; they actively sequester Ca2+ in their lumina and release it to the cytosol upon activation of endolysosomal Ca2+ channels. This local Ca2+ signal is crucial for endolysosomal function and/or global Ca2+ signaling. Importantly, defects in endolysosomal Ca2+ are associated with disease. This chapter discusses several complimentary approaches to monitor endolysosomal Ca2+, with particular emphasis on the inherent pitfalls that can plague the unwary.

Abstract: Centrosomes are major microtubule-organizing centers in eukaryotic cells and play a critical role in embryonic development and asymmetric cell division. Centrosomes comprise a pair of centrioles surrounded by an amorphous proteinaceous meshwork called the pericentriolar material (PCM). Robust deposition of PCM around the centrioles is essential for a centrosome to achieve full microtubule nucleating potential. Despite the wealth of information on PCM composition and function, the mechanism and regulation of PCM assembly have been difficult to ascertain, due in part to the lack of an in vitro system. Here, we describe methods to establish an in vitro system to study PCM assembly in Caenorhabditis elegans. Specifically, we describe (1) how to express and purify the C. elegans PCM proteins SPD-5, SPD-2, and PLK-1 from baculovirus-infected insect cells, (2) how to assemble these proteins into PCM-like structures in vitro, and (3) how to quantify this assembly process in a semiautomated fashion.

Abstract: Summary
Intrinsic restriction factors and viral nucleic acid sensors are important for the anti-viral response. Here, we show how upstream sensing of retroviral reverse transcripts integrates with the downstream effector APOBEC3, an IFN-induced cytidine deaminase that introduces lethal mutations during retroviral reverse transcription. Using a murine leukemia virus (MLV) variant with an unstable capsid that induces a strong IFNβ antiviral response, we identify three sensors, IFI203, DDX41, and cGAS, required for MLV nucleic acid recognition. These sensors then signal using the adaptor STING, leading to increased production of IFNβ and other targets downstream of the transcription factor IRF3. Using knockout and mutant mice, we show that APOBEC3 limits the levels of reverse transcripts that trigger cytosolic sensing, and that nucleic acid sensing in vivo increases expression of IFN-regulated restriction factors like APOBEC3 that in turn reduce viral load. These studies underscore the importance of the multiple layers of protection afforded by host factors.

Abstract: Summary
The mycobacterial ESX-1 virulence locus accelerates macrophage recruitment to the forming tuberculous granuloma. Newly recruited macrophages phagocytose previously infected apoptotic macrophages to become new bacterial growth niches. Granuloma macrophages can then necrose, releasing mycobacteria into the extracellular milieu, which potentiates their growth even further. Using zebrafish with genetic or pharmacologically induced macrophage deficiencies, we find that global macrophage deficits increase susceptibility to mycobacterial infection by accelerating granuloma necrosis. This is because reduction in the macrophage supply below a critical threshold decreases granuloma macrophage replenishment to the point where apoptotic infected macrophages, failing to get engulfed, necrose. Reducing macrophage demand by removing bacterial ESX-1 offsets the susceptibility of macrophage deficits. Conversely, increasing macrophage supply in wild-type fish by overexpressing myeloid growth factors induces resistance by curtailing necrosis. These findings may explain the susceptibility of humans with mononuclear cytopenias to mycobacterial infections and highlight the therapeutic potential of myeloid growth factors in tuberculosis.

CD99 inhibits CD98-mediated β1 integrin signaling through SHP2-mediated FAK dephosphorylation,

Abstract: The human CD99 protein is a 32-kDa type I transmembrane glycoprotein, while CD98 is a disulfide-linked 125-kDa heterodimeric type II transmembrane glycoprotein. It has been previously shown that CD99 and CD98 oppositely regulate β1 integrin signaling, though the mechanisms by which this regulation occurs are not known. Our results revealed that antibody-mediated crosslinking of CD98 induced FAK phosphorylation at Y397 and facilitated the formation of the protein kinase Cα (PKCα)–syntenin-focal adhesion kinase (FAK), focal adhesions (FAs), and IPP–Akt1–syntenin complex, which mediates β1 integrin signaling. In contrast, crosslinking of CD99 disrupted the formation of the PKCα–syntenin–FAK complex as well as FA via FAK dephosphorylation. The CD99-induced dephosphorylation of FAK was apparently mediated by the recruitment of Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-2 (SHP2) to the plasma membrane and subsequent activation of its phosphatase activity. Further consequences of the activation of SHP2 included the disruption of FAK–talin and talin–β1 integrin interactions and attenuation in the formation of the IPP–Akt1–syntenin complex at the plasma membrane, which resulted in reduced cell–ECM adhesion. This report uncovers the molecular mechanisms underlying the inverse regulation of β1 integrin signaling by CD99 and CD98 and may provide a novel therapeutic approach to treat inflammation and cancer.

Abstract: Summary
We utilized induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from Huntington’s disease (HD) patients as a human model of HD and determined that the disease phenotypes only manifest in the differentiated neural stem cell (NSC) stage, not in iPSCs. To understand the molecular basis for the CAG repeat expansion-dependent disease phenotypes in NSCs, we performed transcriptomic analysis of HD iPSCs and HD NSCs compared to isogenic controls. Differential gene expression and pathway analysis pointed to transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and netrin-1 as the top dysregulated pathways. Using data-driven gene coexpression network analysis, we identified seven distinct coexpression modules and focused on two that were correlated with changes in gene expression due to the CAG expansion. Our HD NSC model revealed the dysregulation of genes involved in neuronal development and the formation of the dorsal striatum. The striatal and neuronal networks disrupted could be modulated to correct HD phenotypes and provide therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Glioblastoma cells exhibit highly invasive behavior whose mechanisms are not yet fully understood. The present study explores the relationship between the invasion capacity of 5 glioblastoma cell lines differing in p53 and PTEN status, expression of mTOR and several other marker proteins involved in cell invasion, actin cytoskeleton organization and cell morphology. We found that two glioblastoma lines mutated in both p53 and PTEN genes (U373-MG and SNB19) exhibited the highest invasion rates through the Matrigel or collagen matrix. In DK-MG (p53wt/PTENwt) and GaMG (p53mut/PTENwt) cells, F-actin mainly occurred in the numerous stress fibers spanning the cytoplasm, whereas U87-MG (p53wt/PTENmut), U373-MG and SNB19 (both p53mut/PTENmut) cells preferentially expressed F-actin in filopodia and lamellipodia. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed the abundant filopodia and lamellipodia in the PTEN mutated cell lines. Interestingly, the gene profiling analysis revealed two clusters of cell lines, corresponding to the most (U373-MG and SNB19, i.e. p53 and PTEN mutated cells) and less invasive phenotypes. The results of this study might shed new light on the mechanisms of glioblastoma invasion.

Abstract: Mutations in the human DJ-1/PARK7 gene are associated with familial Parkinson’s disease. DJ-1 belongs to a large, functionally diverse family with homologues in all biological kingdoms. Several activities have been demonstrated for DJ-1: an antioxidant protein, a redox-regulated molecular chaperone and a modulator of multiple cellular signalling pathways. The majority of functional studies have focussed on human DJ-1 (hDJ-1), but studies on DJ-1 homologues in Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Dugesia japonica and Escherichia coli also provide evidence of a role for DJ-1 as an antioxidant. Here, we show that dehydration is a potent inducer of a dj-1 gene in the anhydrobiotic nematode Panagrolaimus superbus. Our secondary structure and homology modelling analyses shows that recombinant DJ-1 protein from P. superbus (PsuDJ-1.1) is a well-folded protein, which is similar in structure to the hDJ-1. PsuDJ-1.1 is a heat stable protein; with T1/2 unfolding transition values of 76 and 70°C obtained from both circular dichroism (CD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements respectively. We found that PsuDJ-1.1 is an efficient antioxidant that also functions as a ‘holdase’ molecular chaperone that can maintain its chaperone function in a reducing environment. In addition to its chaperone activity, PsuDJ-1.1 may also be an important non-enzymatic antioxidant, capable of providing protection to P. superbus from oxidative damage when the nematodes are in a desiccated, anhydrobiotic state.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression at post-transcriptional level. miRNA dysregulation plays a causal role in cancer progression. In this study, miR-208-3p was highly expressed and directly repressed ARID2 expression. As a result, ARID2 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was decreased. In vitro, miR-208-3p down-regulation and ARID2 over-expression elicited similar inhibitory effects on HCC cell proliferation and invasion. In vivo test results revealed that miR-208-3p down-regulation inhibited HCC tumorigenesis in Hep3B cells. Moreover, ARID2 was possibly a downstream element of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFβ1)/miR-208-3p/ARID2 regulatory pathway. These findings suggested that miR-208-3p up-regulation is associated with HCC cell progression and may provide a new target for liver cancer treatment.

Abstract: Background
Sphere formation, one method for identifying self-renewal ability, has been used to report that cancer stem-like cells exist in rat C6 glioma cells. Recent studies suggested that cancer stem-like cells share the stem cell properties of self-renewal and multipotent ability of neural stem cells and might be regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs). However, the mechanism of miRNA involvement in the sphere formation and neural differentiation abilities of cancer stem-like cells is poorly understood.
Results
We found that miRNA-30c could assist in sphere formation of C6 cells under defined conditions in neural stem cell medium DMEM/F12-bFGF-EGF-B27. Moreover, overexpression of miRNA-30c might reduce 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX)-induced neural differentiation, as the expression of neural markers, especially glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), decreased. Further experiments revealed that miRNA-30c inhibited the IBMX-induced astrocyte differentiation via targeting the upstream genes and inactivating phosphorylation of STAT3 of the JAK-STAT3 pathway. Subsequently, the expression of GFAP was reduced and the number of astrocyte differentiation from C6 cells decreased.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that miRNA-30c could play a regulatory role in self-renewal and neural differentiation in C6 glioma cells.

Abstract: The TGFβ signaling pathway is essential to epithelial homeostasis and is often inhibited during progression of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Recently, an important role for TGFβ signaling has been described in the crosstalk between epithelial and stromal cells regulating squamous tumor cell invasion in mouse models of head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Loss of TGFβ signaling, in either compartment, leads to HNSCC however, the mechanisms involved are not well understood. Using organotypic reconstruct cultures (OTC) to model the interaction between epithelial and stromal cells that occur in dysplastic lesions, we show that loss of TGFβ signaling promotes an invasive phenotype in both fibroblast and epithelial compartments. Employing immortalized esophageal keratinocytes established to reproduce common mutations of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, we show that treatment of OTC with inhibitors of TGFβ signaling (A83-01 or SB431542) enhances invasion of epithelial cells into a fibroblast-embedded Matrigel/collagen I matrix. Invasion induced by A83-01 is independent of proliferation but relies on protease activity and expression of ADAMTS-1 and can be altered by matrix density. This invasion was associated with increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL1 and EGFR ligands HB-EGF and TGFα. Altering EGF signaling prevented or induced epithelial cell invasion in this model. Loss of expression of the TGFβ target gene ROBO1 suggested that chemorepulsion may regulate keratinocyte invasion. Taken together, our data show increased invasion through inhibition of TGFβ signaling altered epithelial-fibroblasts interactions, repressing markers of activated fibroblasts, and altering integrin-fibronectin interactions. These results suggest that inhibition of TGFβ signaling modulates an array of pathways that combined promote multiple aspects of tumor invasion.

Abstract: Caveolin-1(CAV1) is a tyrosine-phosphorylated scaffold protein of caveolae with multiple interacting partners. It functions both as an oncogene and a tumour suppressor depending upon the cellular contexts. In the early stage of colorectal cancers (CRC), CAV1 suppresses tumour progression, while over-expression of CAV1 reduced the tumourigenicity of colon carcinoma cells. In contrast, elevated level of CAV1 was reported in stage III CRC. To address this ambiguity, we studied the functional role and the regulation of CAV1 expression during colonocyte differentiation and apoptosis. Here, we reported for the first time that CAV1 expression was increased during colonocyte differentiation and mediated butyrate-induced differentiation and apoptosis of HT29 cells. CAV1 expression was silenced by promoter hypermethylation in HT-29 cells and reactivated by prolonged histone hyperacetylation of the promoter upon treatment of the cells with butyrate. However, the methylation status was unaltered by butyrate. We for the first time showed that HDAC inhibitor-mediated transactivation of CAV1 was regulated by methylation density of the promoter. Our study further explains the underlying mechanisms of the anti-cancer property of butyrate in CRC.

Abstract: Summary
Hereditary hemochromatosis, an iron overload disease caused by a deficiency in the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin, is associated with lethal infections by siderophilic bacteria. To elucidate the mechanisms of this susceptibility, we infected wild-type and hepcidin-deficient mice with the siderophilic bacterium Vibrio vulnificus and found that hepcidin deficiency results in increased bacteremia and decreased survival of infected mice, which can be partially ameliorated by dietary iron depletion. Additionally, timely administration of hepcidin agonists to hepcidin-deficient mice induces hypoferremia that decreases bacterial loads and rescues these mice from death, regardless of initial iron levels. Studies of Vibrio vulnificus growth ex vivo show that high iron sera from hepcidin-deficient mice support extraordinarily rapid bacterial growth and that this is inhibited in hypoferremic sera. Our findings demonstrate that hepcidin-mediated hypoferremia is a host defense mechanism against siderophilic pathogens and suggest that hepcidin agonists may improve infection outcomes in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis or thalassemia.

Abstract: The increased osteoclastic activity accounts for pathological bone loss in diseases including osteoporosis. MicroRNAs are widely accepted to be involved in the regulation of osteopenic diseases. Recently, the low expression of miR-218 was demonstrated in CD14+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis. However, its role and the underlying mechanism in osteoporosis are still undefined. Here, an obvious decrease in miR-218 expression was observed during osteoclastogenesis under receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) stimulation, in both osteoclast precursors of bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) and RAW 264.7. Further analysis confirmed that overexpression of miR-218 obviously attenuated the formation of multinuclear mature osteoclasts, concomitant with the decrease in Trap and Cathepsin K levels, both the master regulators of osteoclastogenesis. Moreover, miR-218 up-regulation dramatically inhibited osteoclast precursor migration, actin ring formation and bone resorption. Mechanism assay demonstrated that miR-218 overexpression attenuated the expression of p38MAPK, c-Fos and NFATc1 signaling molecules. Following preconditioning with P79350, an agonist of p38MAPK, the inhibitor effect of miR-218 on osteoclastogenesis and bone-resorbing activity was strikingly ameliorated. Together, this study revealed a crucial role of miR-218 as a negative regulator for osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption by suppressing the p38MAPK-c-Fos-NFATc1 pathway. Accordingly, this research will provide a promising therapeutic agent against osteopenic diseases including osteoporosis.

Abstract: Summary
The cytoplasmic RNA helicase RIG-I mediates innate sensing of RNA viruses. The genomes of influenza A virus (FLUAV) are encapsidated by the nucleoprotein and associated with RNA polymerase, posing potential barriers to RIG-I sensing. We show that RIG-I recognizes the 5′-triphosphorylated dsRNA on FLUAV nucleocapsids but that polymorphisms at position 627 of the viral polymerase subunit PB2 modulate RIG-I sensing. Compared to mammalian-adapted PB2-627K, avian FLUAV nucleocapsids possessing PB2-627E are prone to increased RIG-I recognition, and RIG-I-deficiency partially restores PB2-627E virus infection of mammalian cells. Heightened RIG-I sensing of PB2-627E nucleocapsids correlates with previously established lower affinity of 627E-containing PB2 for nucleoprotein and is increased by further nucleocapsid instability. The effect of RIG-I on PB2-627E nucleocapsids is independent of antiviral signaling, suggesting that RIG-I-nucleocapsid binding alone can inhibit infection. These results indicate that RIG-I is a direct avian FLUAV restriction factor and highlight nucleocapsid disruption as an antiviral strategy.

Abstract: The concerted movement of cilia propels inhaled contaminants out of the lungs, safeguarding the respiratory system from toxins, pathogens, pollutants, and allergens. Motile cilia on the multiciliated cells (MCCs) of the airway epithelium are physically oriented along the tissue axis for directional motility, which depends on the planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway. The MCCs of the mouse respiratory epithelium have emerged as an important model for the study of motile ciliogenesis and the PCP signaling mechanism. Unlike other motile ciliated or planar polarized tissues, airway epithelial cells are relatively easily accessible and primary cultures faithfully model many of the essential features of the in vivo tissue. There is growing interest in understanding how cells acquire and polarize motile cilia due to the impact of mucociliary clearance on respiratory health. Here, we present methods for observing and quantifying the planar polarized orientation of motile cilia both in vivo and in primary culture airway epithelial cells. We describe how to acquire and evaluate electron and light microscopy images of ciliary ultrastructural features that reveal planar polarized orientation. Furthermore, we describe the immunofluorescence localization of PCP pathway components as a simple readout for airway epithelial planar polarization and ciliary orientation. These methods can be adapted to observe ciliary orientation in other multi- and monociliated cells and to detect PCP pathway activity in any tissue or cell type.

Abstract: Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) is a protein associated with prolonged life expectancy. We investigated whether life extension is associated with cardioprotection against hypoxia. The proposed study is to develop approaches to reduce hypoxic damage through the use of the sirtuin pathway and to elucidate the mechanism involved. For that purpose we subjected cardiomyocytes from transgenic mice (TG) with over-expression of SIRT6, to hypoxic stress in cell cultures. We hypothesized that cardiomyocytes from transgenic mice subjected to prolonged hypoxia may release survival factors or fewer damage markers to protect them from hypoxic stress compared with wild type (WT) mice. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK) released to the medium and propidium iodide (PI) binding, were markedly decreased following hypoxia in TG cardiomyocytes. The protective mechanism of SIRT6 over-expression includes the activation of pAMPKα pathway, the increased protein level of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), the inhibition of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB), the decrease of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the reduction in the protein level of phospho-protein kinase B (pAkt) during hypoxia. Together, all these processes impede the necrosis/apoptosis pathways leading to the improved survival of cardiomyocytes following hypoxia, which might explain life extension.

Abstract: Cell surface receptors that have been internalized and enter the endocytic pathway have multiple fates including entrance into the multivesicular body pathway on their way to lysosomal degradation, recycling back to the cell surface, or retrograde trafficking out of the endolysosomal system back to the Golgi apparatus. Two ubiquitously expressed protein complexes, WASH and the endosomal coat complex retromer, function together to play a central role in directing the fate of receptors into the latter two pathways. In this chapter, we describe fluorescent- and flow cytometry-based methods for analyzing the recycling and retrograde trafficking of two receptors, α5β1 and CI-M6PR, whose intracellular fates are regulated by WASH and retromer activity. The guidelines presented in this chapter can be applied to the analysis of any cell surface or intracellular membrane protein to determine the impact of WASH or retromer deregulation on its intracellular trafficking route.

Abstract: Summary
Glial cells can be in vivo reprogrammed into functional neurons in the adult CNS; however, the process by which this reprogramming occurs is unclear. Here, we show that a distinct cellular sequence is involved in SOX2-driven in situ conversion of adult astrocytes to neurons. This includes ASCL1+ neural progenitors and DCX+ adult neuroblasts (iANBs) as intermediates. Importantly, ASCL1 is required, but not sufficient, for the robust generation of iANBs in the adult striatum. These progenitor-derived iANBs predominantly give rise to calretinin+ interneurons when supplied with neurotrophic factors or the small-molecule valproic acid. Patch-clamp recordings from the induced neurons reveal subtype heterogeneity, though all are functionally mature, fire repetitive action potentials, and receive synaptic inputs. Together, these results show that SOX2-mediated in vivo reprogramming of astrocytes to neurons passes through proliferative intermediate progenitors, which may be exploited for regenerative medicine.

Abstract: L1CAM plays important roles during ontogeny, including promotion of neuronal cell migration and neuritogenesis, and stimulation of axonal outgrowth, fasciculation and myelination. These functions are at least partially exerted through a 16-mer amino acid sequence in the third fibronectin type III-like repeat of L1, which associates with several interaction partners, including integrins, other adhesion molecules and growth factor receptors. Here, using the Tomlinson I library for phage display, we obtained two single-chain variable fragment antibodies (scFvs) against this peptide sequence of human L1, hereafter called H3 peptide. Both scFvs recognize the H3 peptide and the extracellular domain of L1, as tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining of L1 expresssing cells. Furthermore, both scFvs reduce U-87 MG cell adhesion to fibronectin, while stimulating cell migration. Application of scFvs to human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells promote process outgrowth. Similar to triggering of endogenous L1 functions at the cell surface, both scFvs activate the signal transducers Erk and Src in these cells. Our results indicate that scFvs against a functionally pivotal domain in L1 trigger its regeneration-beneficial functions in vitro, encouraging thoughts on therapy of neurodegenerative diseases in the hope to ameliorate human nervous system diseases.

Impaired function of bone marrow stromal cells in systemic mastocytosis,

Abstract: Patients with systemic mastocytosis (SM) have a wide variety of problems, including skeletal abnormalities. The disease results from a mutation of the stem cell receptor (c-kit) in mast cells and we wondered if the function of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs; also known as MSCs or mesenchymal stem cells) might be affected by the invasion of bone marrow by mutant mast cells. As expected, BMSCs from SM patients do not have a mutation in c-kit, but they proliferate poorly. In addition, while osteogenic differentiation of the BMSCs seems to be deficient, their adipogenic potential appears to be increased. Since the hematopoietic supportive abilities of BMSCs are also important, we also studied the engraftment in NSG mice of human CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors, after being co-cultured with BMSCs of healthy volunteers vs. BMSCs derived from patients with SM. BMSCs derived from the bone marrow of patients with SM could not support hematopoiesis to the extent that healthy BMSCs do. Finally, we performed an expression analysis and found significant differences between healthy and SM derived BMSCs in the expression of genes with a variety of functions, including the WNT signaling, ossification, and bone remodeling. We suggest that some of the symptoms associated with SM might be driven by epigenetic changes in BMSCs caused by dysfunctional mast cells in the bone marrow of the patients.

Abstract: The intestinal epithelium is a particularly attractive biological adult model to study epigenetic mechanisms driving adult stem cell renewal and cell differentiation. Since epigenetic modifications are dynamic, we have developed an original ex vivo approach to study the expression and epigenetic profiles of key genes associated with either intestinal cell pluripotency or differentiation by isolating cryosections of the intestinal crypt-villus axis. Gene expression, DNA methylation and histone modifications were studied by qRT-PCR, methylation-specific PCR and micro-chromatin immunoprecipitation, respectively. Using this approach, it was possible to identify segment-specific methylation and chromatin profiles. We show that (i) expression of intestinal stem cell markers (Lgr5, Ascl2) exclusively in the crypt is associated with active histone marks, (ii) promoters of all pluripotency genes studied and transcription factors involved in intestinal cell fate (Cdx2) harbour a bivalent chromatin pattern in the crypts and (iii) expression of differentiation markers (Muc2, Sox9) along the crypt-villus axis is associated with DNA methylation. Hence, using an original model of cryosectioning along the crypt-villus axis that allows in situ detection of dynamic epigenetic modifications, we demonstrate that regulation of pluripotency and differentiation markers in healthy intestinal mucosa involves different and specific epigenetic mechanisms.

Abstract: Drosophila larval neuroblasts (NBs) are an excellent model for asymmetric division and cell cycle studies in general. For decades, visualizing relevant structures like centrosomes, chromosomes, or the mitotic spindle relied exclusively on immunofluorescence on fix samples. More recently, improvements on sensitivity and acquisition speed of different confocal systems have made it possible to acquire time-resolved images of combined fluorescent reporters from single larval NBs. Here, we provide protocols to visualize centrosomes and other organelles from both primary cultures of isolated single NBs and ex vivo, whole-mounted larval brains.

Abstract: Increasing evidence has shown that mechanical cues from the environment play an important role in cell biology. Mechanotransduction or the study of how cells can sense these mechanical cues, and respond to them, is an active field of research. However, it is still not clear how cells sense and respond to mechanical cues. Thus, new tools are being rapidly developed to quantitatively study cell mechanobiology. Particularly, force measurement tools such as micropillar substrates have provided new insights into the underlying mechanisms of mechanosensing. In this chapter, we provide detailed protocol for fabrication, characterization, functionalization, and use of the micropillar substrates.

Abstract: Summary
The gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori interacts intimately with the gastric mucosa to avoid the microbicidal acid in the stomach lumen. The cues H. pylori senses to locate and colonize the gastric epithelium have not been well defined. We show that metabolites emanating from human gastric organoids rapidly attract H. pylori. This response is largely controlled by the bacterial chemoreceptor TlpB, and the main attractant emanating from epithelia is urea. Our previous structural analyses show that TlpB binds urea with high affinity. Here we demonstrate that this tight binding controls highly sensitive responses, allowing detection of urea concentrations as low as 50 nM. Attraction to urea requires that H. pylori urease simultaneously destroys the signal. We propose that H. pylori has evolved a sensitive urea chemodetection and destruction system that allows the bacterium to dynamically and locally modify the host environment to locate the epithelium.

Abstract: The ability to rapidly and specifically modify the genome of mammalian cells has been a long-term goal of biomedical researchers. Recently, the clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system from bacteria has been exploited for genome engineering in human cells. The CRISPR system directs the RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease to a specific genomic locus to induce a DNA double-strand break that may be subsequently repaired by homology-directed repair using an exogenous DNA repair template. Here we describe a protocol using CRISPR/Cas9 to achieve bi-allelic insertion of a point mutation in human cells. Using this method, homozygous clonal cell lines can be constructed in 5–6 weeks. This method can also be adapted to insert larger DNA elements, such as fluorescent proteins and degrons, at defined genomic locations. CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering offers exciting applications in both basic science and translational research.

Abstract: Summary
Epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) in mice and rats are primed pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). They barely contribute to chimeric embryos when injected into blastocysts. Reprogramming of EpiSCs to embryonic stem cell (ESC)-like cells (rESCs) may occur in response to LIF-STAT3 signaling; however, low reprogramming efficiency hampers potential use of rESCs in generating chimeras. Here, we describe dramatic improvement of conversion efficiency from primed to naive-like PSCs through upregulation of E-cadherin in the presence of the cytokine LIF. Analysis revealed that blocking nuclear localization of β-CATENIN with small-molecule inhibitors significantly enhances reprogramming efficiency of mouse EpiSCs. Although activation of Wnt/β-catenin signals has been thought desirable for maintenance of naive PSCs, this study provides the evidence that inhibition of nuclear translocation of β-CATENIN enhances conversion of mouse EpiSCs to naive-like PSCs (rESCs). This affords better understanding of gene regulatory circuits underlying pluripotency and reprogramming of PSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Analyses of gene expression in single mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) cultured in serum and LIF revealed the presence of two distinct cell subpopulations with individual gene expression signatures. Comparisons with published data revealed that cells in the first subpopulation are phenotypically similar to cells isolated from the inner cell mass (ICM). In contrast, cells in the second subpopulation appear to be more mature. Pluripotency Gene Regulatory Network (PGRN) reconstruction based on single-cell data and published data suggested antagonistic roles for Oct4 and Nanog in the maintenance of pluripotency states. Integrated analyses of published genomic binding (ChIP) data strongly supported this observation. Certain target genes alternatively regulated by OCT4 and NANOG, such as Sall4 and Zscan10, feed back into the top hierarchical regulator Oct4. Analyses of such incoherent feedforward loops with feedback (iFFL-FB) suggest a dynamic model for the maintenance of mESC pluripotency and self-renewal.

Abstract: Summary
The differentiation of pluripotent stem cells to hepatocytes is well established, yet current methods suffer from several drawbacks. These include a lack of definition and reproducibility, which in part stems from continued reliance on recombinant growth factors. This has remained a stumbling block for the translation of the technology into industry and the clinic for reasons associated with cost and quality. We have devised a growth-factor-free protocol that relies on small molecules to differentiate human pluripotent stem cells toward a hepatic phenotype. The procedure can efficiently direct both human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells to hepatocyte-like cells. The final population of cells demonstrates marker expression at the transcriptional and protein levels, as well as key hepatic functions such as serum protein production, glycogen storage, and cytochrome P450 activity.

Abstract: Summary
Resistance and tolerance are two defense strategies employed by the host against microbial threats. Autophagy-mediated degradation of bacteria has been extensively described as a major resistance mechanism. Here we find that the dominant function of autophagy proteins during infections with the epidemic community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus USA300 is to mediate tolerance rather than resistance. Atg16L1 hypomorphic mice (Atg16L1HM), which have reduced autophagy, were highly susceptible to lethality in both sepsis and pneumonia models of USA300 infection. Autophagy confers protection by limiting the damage caused by α-toxin, particularly to endothelial cells. Remarkably, Atg16L1HM mice display enhanced survival rather than susceptibility upon infection with α-toxin-deficient S. aureus. These results identify an essential role for autophagy in tolerance to Staphylococcal disease and highlight how a single virulence factor encoded by a pathogen can determine whether a given host factor promotes tolerance or resistance.

Abstract: Trypanosoma brucei is a flagellated eukaryotic pathogen responsible for sleeping sickness in central Africa. Because of the presence of a long motile flagellum (>20 μm) and its amenity to genetic manipulation, it is becoming an attractive model to study the assembly and the functions of cilia and flagella. In recent years, several aspects have been investigated, especially intraflagellar transport (IFT) that has been exhaustively characterized at the light microscopy level. In this manuscript, we review various methods to express fluorescent fusion proteins and to record IFT in living trypanosomes in normal or mutant contexts. We present an approach for separating anterograde and retrograde IFT, hence facilitating quantification of train speed, frequency, and size. A statistical analysis to discriminate different subpopulations of IFT trains is also summarized. These methods have proven their efficiency for the study of IFT in trypanosomes and could be applied to any other organism.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the mechanisms of cancer initiation will help to prevent and manage the disease. At present, the role of the breast microenvironment in transformation remains unknown. As BMP2 and BMP4 are important regulators of stem cells and their niches in many tissues, we investigated their function in early phases of breast cancer. BMP2 production by tumor microenvironment appeared to be specifically upregulated in luminal tumors. Chronic exposure of immature human mammary epithelial cells to high BMP2 levels initiated transformation toward a luminal tumor-like phenotype, mediated by the receptor BMPR1B. Under physiological conditions, BMP2 controlled the maintenance and differentiation of early luminal progenitors, while BMP4 acted on stem cells/myoepithelial progenitors. Our data also suggest that microenvironment-induced overexpression of BMP2 may result from carcinogenic exposure. We reveal a role for BMP2 and the breast microenvironment in the initiation of stem cell transformation, thus providing insight into the etiology of luminal breast cancer.

Abstract: Thymopentin is a group of biologically active peptide secreted mainly by the epithelial cells of thymic cortex and medulla. Whether it promotes T cells production from human embryonic stem cells(hESCs) in vitro remains an elusive issue. In the present study, we develop a novel strategy that enhances T-cell lineage differentiation of hESCs in collagen matrix culture by sequential cytokine cocktails treatment combined with thymopentin stimulation. We observed that approximately 30.75% cells expressed CD34 on day 14 of the cultures and expressed the surface markers of erythroid, lymphoid and myeloid lineages. The results of colony assays and gene expressions by RT-PCR analysis also demonstrated that hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) derived from hESCs were capable of multi-lineage differentiation. Further study revealed that culturing with thymopentin treatment, the CD34+CD45RA+CD7+ cells sorted from HPCs expressed T-cell-related genes, IKAROS, DNTT, TCRγ and TCRβ, and T-cell surface markers, CD3, cytoplasmic CD3, CD5, CD27, TCRγδ, CD4 and CD8. The differentiated cells produced the cytokines including IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α in response to stimulation, providing the evidence for T-cell function of these cells. In conclusion, thymopentin enhances T-cell lineage differentiation from hESCs in vitro by mimicking thymus peptide environment in vivo.

The miR-134 attenuates the expression of transcription factor FOXM1 during pluripotent NT2/D1 embryonal carcinoma cell differentiation,

Abstract: Transcription factor FOXM1 plays a critical role in maintenance of stem cell pluripotency through stimulating the transcription of pluripotency-related genes in mouse pluripotent stem cells. In this study, we have found that the repression of FOXM1 expression is mediated by FOXM1 3′UTR during retinoic acid-induced differentiation of human pluripotent NT2/D1 embryonal carcinoma cells. FOXM1 3′UTR contains a microRNA response element (MRE) for miR-134, which has been shown to attenuate the expression of pluripotency-related genes post-transcriptionally during mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation. We have determined that miR-134 is induced during RA-induced differentiation of NT2/D1 cells and the overexpression of miR-134 represses the expression of FOXM1 protein but not FOXM1 mRNA. Furthermore, the expression of OCT4 is diminished by FOXM1 knockdown and the OCT4 promoter is regulated directly by FOXM1, suggesting that FOXM1 is required for maintaining the expression of OCT4 in NT2/D1 cells. Together, our results suggest that FOXM1 is essential for human pluripotent stem cells and miR-134 attenuates its expression during differentiation.

Dedifferentiation of cancer cells following recovery from a potentially lethal damage is mediated by H2S–Nampt,

Abstract: Recently, we reported that cancer cells that recover from a potentially lethal damage gain new phenotypic features comprised of mitochondrial structural remodeling associated with increased glycolytic dependency and drug resistance. Here, we demonstrate that a subset of cancer cells, upon recovery from a potentially lethal damage, undergo dedifferentiation and express genes, which are characteristic of undifferentiated stem cells. While these cells are competent in maintaining differentiated progeny of tumor, they also exhibit transdifferentiation potential. Dedifferentiation is characterized by accumulation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which triggers up-regulation of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) accompanied by changes in the redox state. The molecular events triggered by Nampt include elevated production of NAD+ and up-regulation of H2S producing enzymes, cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) and cystathionase (CTH) with 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MST) being detectable only in 3D spheroids. Suppression of Nampt, or inactivation of H2S producing enzymes, all reduce H2S production and reverse the ability of cells to dedifferentiate. Moreover, H2S induced stem cell markers in parental cancer cells in a manner similar to that observed in damage recovered cells. These data suggest of existence of a positive feedback loop between H2S and Nampt that controls dedifferentiation in cancer cells that recover from a potentially lethal damage.

Abstract: As a large, nonmembrane bound organelle, the centrosome must rely heavily on protein–protein interactions to assemble itself in the cytoplasm and perform its functions as a microtubule-organizing center. Therefore, to understand how this organelle is built and functions, one must understand the protein–protein interactions made by each centrosome protein. Unfortunately, the highly interconnected nature of the centrosome, combined with its predicted unstructured, coil-rich proteins, has made the use of many standard approaches to studying protein–protein interactions very challenging. The yeast-two hybrid (Y2H) system is well suited for studying the centrosome and is an important complement to other biochemical approaches. In this chapter we describe how to carry out a directed Y2H screen to identify the direct interactions between a given centrosome protein and a library of others. Specifically, we detail using a bioinformatics-based approach (structure prediction programs) to subdivide proteins and screen for interactions using an array-based Y2H approach. We also describe how to use the interaction information garnered from this screen to generate mutations to disrupt specific interactions using mutagenic-PCR and a “reverse” Y2H screen. Finally, we discuss how information from such a screen can be integrated into existing models of centrosome assembly and how it can initiate and guide extensive in vitro and in vivo experimentation to test these models.

Abstract: The physiology and functions of ion channels have been major topics of interest in biomedical research. Patch clamping is one of the most powerful techniques used in the study of ion channels and has been widely applied to the investigation of electrical properties of ion channels on the plasma membrane in a variety of cells. A number of ion channels have been found in intracellular lysosomal membranes. However, their properties had been difficult to study due to the lack of a direct patch-clamping methodology on lysosomal membranes. Past attempts to record lysosomal channels that were forced to express on the plasma membrane or reconstituted into lipid bilayers have largely generated inconclusive and conflicting results. Recently, a novel lysosome patch-clamping technique has been developed, making it possible to examine lysosomal channels under near physiological conditions. This chapter provides a detailed description of this technique, which has been successfully applied in several studies concerning lysosomal ion channels. This technique will expand our understanding of the nature of lysosomes and lysosome-related diseases.

Abstract: Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can be transfected by electroporation, liposomal reagents, and viral transduction methods. The cationic polymer polyethylenimine (PEI) has been shown to transfect a variety of differentiated mammalian cell types, including mouse ESCs, but existing methods require the use of additional equipment that is not readily accessible to most labs. Here we describe conditions that permit for the efficient transfection of mouse ESCs with low cytotoxicity and without the need for specialized equipment. Our goal was to devise a protocol for the PEI-mediated transfection of mouse ESCs that was comparable in ease to commercial transfection reagents. For these studies, we compared PEI transfection efficiency and cytotoxicity to a well-known liposomal transfection reagent, Lipofectamine2000™ (LF2K), using fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, cell viability assays, and Western blotting. We provide evidence that PEI transfection of mouse ESCs compares favorably to LF2K. Our optimized protocol for efficient transfection of mouse ESCs with PEI is detailed in this report.

Abstract: Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) acts as a facilitator of metastatic dissemination in the invasive margin of malignant tumors where active tumor–stromal crosstalks take place. Co-cultures of cancer cells with cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are often used as in vitro models of EMT. We established a tumor–fibroblast proximity co-culture using HT-29 tumor spheroids (TSs) with CCD-18co fibroblasts. When co-cultured with TSs, CCD-18co appeared activated, and proliferative activity as well as cell migration increased. Expression of fibronectin increased whereas laminin and type I collagen decreased in TSs co-cultured with fibroblasts compared to TSs alone, closely resembling the margin of in vivo xenograft tissue. Active TGFβ1 in culture media significantly increased in TS co-cultures but not in 2D co-cultures of cancer cells–fibroblasts, indicating that 3D context-associated factors from TSs may be crucial to crosstalks between cancer cells and fibroblasts. We also observed in TSs co-cultured with fibroblasts increased expression of α-SMA, EGFR and CTGF; reduced expression of membranous β-catenin and E-cadherin, together suggesting an EMT-like changes similar to a marginal region of xenograft tissue in vivo. Overall, our in vitro TS–fibroblast proximity co-culture mimics the EMT-state of the invasive margin of in vivo tumors in early metastasis.

Elastic hydrogel substrate supports robust expansion of murine myoblasts and enhances their engraftment,

Abstract: The application of satellite cell-derived myoblasts in regenerative medicine has been restricted by the rapid loss of stemness during in vitro cell expansion using traditional culture systems. However, studies published in the past decade have highlighted the influence of substrate elasticity on stem cell fate and revealed that culture on a soft hydrogel substrate can promote self-renewal and prolong the regenerative potential of muscle stem cells. Whether hydrogel substrates have similar effects after long-term robust expansion remains to be determined. Herein we prepared an elastic chitosan/beta-glycerophosphate/collagen hydrogel mimicking the soft microenvironment of muscle tissues for use as the substrate for satellite cell culture and investigated its influence on long-term cell expansion. After 20 passages in culture, satellite cell-derived myoblasts cultured on our hydrogel substrate exhibited significant improvements in proliferation capability, cell viability, colony forming frequency, and potential for myogenic differentiation compared to those cultured on a routine rigid culture surface. Immunochemical staining and western blot analysis both confirmed that myoblasts cultured on the hydrogel substrate expressed higher levels of several differentiation-related markers, including Pax7, Pax3, and SSEA-1, and a lower level of MyoD compared to myoblasts cultured on rigid culture plates (all p<0.05). After transplantation into the tibialis anterior of nude mice, myoblasts that had been cultured on the hydrogel substrate demonstrated a significantly greater engraftment efficacy than those cultured on the traditional surface. Collectively, these results indicate that the elastic hydrogel substrate supported robust expansion of murine myoblasts and enhanced their engraftment in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
The persistence of a latent reservoir containing transcriptionally silent, but replication-competent, integrated provirus is a serious challenge to HIV eradication. HIV integration is under the control of LEDGF/p75, the cellular cofactor of viral integrase. Investigating possible postintegration roles for LEDGF/p75, we find that LEDGF/p75 represses HIV expression in latently infected cells. LEDGF/p75 associated with two proteins involved in the control of gene expression and chromatin structure, Spt6 and Iws1, to form a stable complex. Iws1 plays a role in the establishment of latent infection, whereas Spt6 functions to recruit Iws1 and LEDGF/p75 to the silenced provirus and maintains histone occupancy at the HIV promoter. In latently infected cells, depletion of the complex results in reactivation of HIV expression Altogether, our results indicate that a complex containing LEDGF/p75, Iws1, and Spt6 participates in regulating postintegration steps of HIV latency.

Abstract: Summary
Human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived pancreatic progenitor cells effectively reverse hyperglycemia in rodent models of type 1 diabetes, but their capacity to treat type 2 diabetes has not been reported. An immunodeficient model of type 2 diabetes was generated by high-fat diet (HFD) feeding in SCID-beige mice. Exposure to HFDs did not impact the maturation of macroencapsulated pancreatic progenitor cells into glucose-responsive insulin-secreting cells following transplantation, and the cell therapy improved glucose tolerance in HFD-fed transplant recipients after 24 weeks. However, since diet-induced hyperglycemia and obesity were not fully ameliorated by transplantation alone, a second cohort of HFD-fed mice was treated with pancreatic progenitor cells combined with one of three antidiabetic drugs. All combination therapies rapidly improved body weight and co-treatment with either sitagliptin or metformin improved hyperglycemia after only 12 weeks. Therefore, a stem cell-based therapy may be effective for treating type 2 diabetes, particularly in combination with antidiabetic drugs.
