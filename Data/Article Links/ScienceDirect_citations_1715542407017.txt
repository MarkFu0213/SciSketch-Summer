Abstract: In this work, we developed a facile route to fabricate highly transparent conductive AZO thin films by using an aqueous solution process followed by an ultraviolet (UV) exposure technique at an annealing temperature as low as 200 °C, where the aluminum citrate complex was used as the Al doping source. Various of deposition parameters in the AZO thin films fabrication process were studied and optimized. The mechanisms on UV exposure and heat treatment to the conductivity improvement and conductivity stability of the AZO films were analysed. Results showed that the AZO thin films under the best parameters conditions demonstrated an optical transmittance higher than 85% in the visible spectra region and a lowest electrical resistivity of 4.8 × 10−3 Ω cm, while exhibited densely oriented columnar grains and uniform surface morphology as well as uniform composition distribution. The UV exposure could remove carbon species from the surface of the AZO thin films to reduce oxygen-related defects and release free carriers at the boundaries and interfaces, thereby improving the conductivity of the AZO thin films. The simultaneous treatment of the AZO thin film by ultraviolet exposure and heat treatment could remove carbon species at a deeper thickness, thereby improving the conductive stability of the AZO thin films. Kesterite Cu2ZnSnS4 thin film solar cells incorporating the optimal AZO thin films as top electrodes demonstrated a best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.15%, which was comparable to the PCE value obtained by using the sputtering deposited AZO thin films as top electrodes.

Abstract: To accelerate the commercialization of organic photovoltaics (OPVs), researchers should use scalable coating approaches compatible with roll-to-roll production in understanding the performance for OPV module manufacturing. The performance of OPV module is strongly changed by the interfacial materials, thin film deposition methods, and processing atmosphere with the film-forming properties of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) layer influenced intimately to the efficiency of the devices. Herein, we present a reliable process flow and module architecture to demonstrate an air-stable, large-area, and solution-processable OPV module, which the electron transporting layer (ETL), BHJ layer, and hole transporting layer (HTL) are all deposited by slot-die coating and processed in the ambient. Thus prepared module achieved a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.56% with an active area of 23.7 cm2 and FF up to 65% under 100 mW/cm2 AM1.5G irradiation. The cell to module loss is found to be 5.5% only in PCE. The encapsulated module also performed superior stability, the performance remained almost unchanged, and PCE can still maintain about 91.7% of the initial value after 1000 h light soaking. We believe this module performed an extremely high PCE reported for OPV module fabricated by ambient slot-die coating in single junction architecture, inferring that the industrialization of OPVs is promising and expectable.

Abstract: Hole transport layers (HTLs) plays critical role in CsPbI2Br perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, few studies have been done to develop new and sensitive-dopant-free HTL for CsPbI2Br PSCs. Here, a low-cost fluorinated N',N',N'',N''-tetrakis(4-methoxyphenyl)spiro[fluorene-9,9'-xanthene]-2,7-diamine (2mF-X59) was synthesized and applied as sensitive-dopant-free HTL into CsPbI2Br PSCs. After modified the 2mF-X59 and CsPbI2Br surface by 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquino-dimethane (F4-TCNQ), a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.42% was obtained for CsPbI2Br PSC with an impressive open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.23 V, which is higher than that of the most previously reported CsPbI2Br PSCs with the doped Spiro-OMeTAD. More importantly, the CsPbI2Br PSCs with the newly developed HTLs showed remarkable stability retaining more than 94% of their initial PCE value after aging in air for 30 days without encapsulation. Therefore, we firmly believe that our new 2mF-X59 HTL created via molecular engineering is a promising candidate for preparing high performance CsPbI2Br PSCs.

Abstract: Nanoscale science rapidly enters nearly every field of technology providing perspectives of new advanced applications. In the area of thermal energy storage (TES) doping molten salts with small amounts of nanoparticles represents tremendous interest due to the perspective of pronounced enhancement of their thermophysical properties. This is particularly important for the concentrated solar power (CSP) technology where a considerable decrease of investment costs is required. However, the information about materials degradation in direct contact with molten salts based nanofluids is practically absent. In this work, the compatibility of carbon steel A516.Gr70 with NaNO3-KNO3-Ca(NO3)2 (15-43-42 wt%) molten salt known as HitecXL doped with SiO2 nanoparticles was evaluated under thermal cycling conditions. We demonstrate that the presence of nanoparticles in the salt considerably increases the corrosion rates even for carbon steel protected by spray-graphitization method – the anti-corrosion method capable of reducing the corrosion rates for nanoparticles-free-HitecXL under similar conditions.

Abstract: The crystallization of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) to form nanowires has attracted considerable interest because this process significantly increases the hole mobility when compared to amorphous P3HT, leading to improved performance in photovoltaic and other organic electronic devices. However, full characterization of the crystallization self-assembly of the polymer chains in solution has not been achieved yet, due to limited use of in−situ not destructive techniques. Here, we investigate the ageing-driven formation and evolution of regioregular (rr) P3HT nanostructures in chlorobenzene solution using small angle neutron scattering (SANS) and UV–Vis spectroscopy. We have monitored how the shape of the rr-P3HT aggregates evolves. The initial states for rr-P3HT chains are the random coils, which straighten to form rods. These subsequently π - π stack to form 2D lamellae, which further stack to create nanowires. The formation of nanowires is promoted both by the length of ageing and by low temperatures (4∘C). Temperatures above >40∘C reverse the formation of nanowires. Additionally, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and grazing incidence wide angle x-ray scattering (GIWAXS) reveal that the nanowires can be successfully aligned during deposition by off-axis spin coating. Finally, the anisotropic conductivity of the aligned rr-P3HT nanowire films is reported. This is significant for applications such as gas sensing or organic thin film transistors, where increased conductivity and controlled nanostructure are desirable.

Abstract: This work presents the upscaling of the tunnel IBC technology on large area, Czochralski (Cz) n-type wafers. At the junction level, a self-aligned PECVD masking technology has been developed for the deposition of hydrogenated nano-crystalline silicon (nc-Si:H) layers on industrial 6-inch pseudo-square wafers. This damage free patterning technology allows state-of-the-art passivation with a minority carrier lifetime of 9 ms at an injection level of 1015 cm-3, thus enabling extremely long diffusion lengths up to several millimetres. The use of indium-free, cost effective aluminium-doped zinc oxide strongly reduces the materials bill of the tunnel-IBC technology while maintaining very low contact resistance for both the electron and the hole contacts. Remarkably, these tunnel-IBC devices demonstrated a conversion efficiency of 25% on large area (90.25 cm2) industrial wafer with a thickness of 155 μm. Series resistance analysis points out probable losses from the hole contact and the base. The limitation of the Transfer Length Method is discussed when used to extract the hole contact resistance.

Abstract: Ga0.51In0.49P solar cells with compositionally-graded (AlzGa1-z)xIn1-xP window/emitter structures were grown via molecular beam epitaxy using a digital alloy based grading approach. Spatially-resolved internal quantum efficiency modeling for such structures predicts short wavelength current collection enhancements due to increased optical transparency, elimination of discrete window-emitter interfaces, and introduction of internal drift fields. Epitaxial device structures based on different graded window/emitter variations were designed to deconvolve these effects. Fabricated test devices were found to yield significant increases in carrier collection (>10% absolute quantum efficiency) in the short wavelength region of the solar spectrum (λ < 550 nm) versus a reference cell with discrete window and emitter layers. AM0-integrated internal quantum efficiency (λ < 550 nm) showed an increase of nearly 2 mA/cm2 for the highest performing devices. Most of this improvement (75%) can be attributed to increased optical transmission through the window-emitter region, while the remainder is attributed to reduced interface/surface recombination velocities and drift-field enhanced carrier transport.

Abstract: A phase change material (PCM) with both high thermal storage/release rate and good photo-thermal conversion performance not only is a good working medium for thermal energy storage system but also show potential use in solar thermal utilization. Herein, a strategy of further improving thermal characteristics of an organic PCM/expanded graphite (EG) composite was explored. In this work, PA is selected as PCM. Specifically, the PA/EG composite was pressed into round blocks with different EG packing densities, and it is shown that the block that has the EG packing density of 320 Kg/m3 exhibits both large enthalpy and high thermal conductivity. Then, two carbon materials, carbon fiber (CF) and graphite sheet (GS), were introduced into the optimal EG-based binary block to prepare two series of ternary blocks with different mass ratios of CF (GS) to EG, respectively. It is found that the ternary blocks containing GS always exhibit larger enthalpy and higher thermal conductivity than the ones containing CF at every identical mass ratio. The suitable mass ratio of GS to EG has been selected as 0.5, at which the obtained ternary block possesses a thermal conductivity of 16.5 W/mK, showing an increase by ca. 24%, while its enthalpy just decreases very slightly, as compared with the binary one. Moreover, it is revealed that the introduction of GS makes the ternary block exhibit accelerated heat storage and release rates and enhanced photo-thermal conversion performance. These good characteristics along with excellent thermal reliability endow the PA/GS/EG block with potential applications.

Abstract: From viewpoint of engineering application, to dramatically enhance the photocatalyst performance is the absolute truth for solar energy photocatalysis. Although various modification strategies have been developed to enhance the activity of a photocatalyst, the improvement extent is actually not obvious with a single strategy. In this work, abundant bismuth is used to obtain the Bi-doped TiO2 (Dx), Bi@TiO2 (Sy) and Bi@Bi-doped TiO2 (SyDx) samples. Compared with original TiO2, the activities of Dx and Sy can only increase by 0.26 and 1.9 times under UV light irradiation (λ≤ 400 nm), respectively; however, the degradation activity of S10D1 has increased by 4.5 times, showing an obvious synergistic effect between Mott-Schottky junction and oxygen defect, in which oxygen defect and Mott-Schottky junction obviously expands the light adsorption range and promotes reduces the charge transfer and separation. To the best of our knowledge, the abundant, environmental-friendly bismuth-based Bi@Bi-doped TiO2 has not been reported so far. The simple integration strategy is remarkably efficient to greatly enhance the photocatalytic activity, compared to single strategy.

Abstract: The accumulation of dust and dirt on PV modules can cause significant energy yield losses, especially in dusty environments. The application of anti-soiling coatings (ASC) is seen as a promising mitigation approach to reduce cleaning frequency and thus cleaning costs. In order to examine the effectiveness of coatings, outdoor tests are usually necessary, but these are subject to varying and complex weather conditions. Therefore, an advanced laboratory soiling test setup and corresponding sequential testing procedures representing the underlying physics of soiling and self-cleaning processes were developed, aiming at fast, reliable and standardized evaluation of the anti-soiling performance of glass coatings. The methods include the control of important environmental parameters during dust deposition and a controlled dust removal by utilization of wind blow or centrifugal forces. Besides method evaluation experiments, comparative soiling experiments were performed for uncoated solar-grade float glass, an anti-reflective coating (ARC) and an ASC. The dusts used for the tests were collected from PV modules located in Dunhuang (cold desert climate, China) and Doha (hot desert climate, Qatar). For sample characterization and soiling loss determination, optical transmittance and light microscopy measurements were performed. Both wind blow and rotational force test (RFT) procedures reveal a reduced dust accumulation for the ARC and a further increased anti-soiling behavior for the ASC. The presented test results are consistent with other outdoor and laboratory soiling studies. Compared to wind blow testing, the rotational force test setup significantly improves the controllability of test parameters and provides a better selectivity of coating performance.

Abstract: It has been proposed that the aberrant expressions of the classical apoptosis-related genes and the subsequent decrease of apoptosis contribute to the development of cisplatin resistance in gastric cancer. However, little is known about the correlation and the molecular regulation mechanisms of cisplatin and the apoptosis-related gene expressions. Herein, we first identified the expressions of the anti-apoptotic BCL2 and the prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase-2 (PTGS2) genes, which were abundant in the gastric carcinoma and associated with poor patient survival, were closely related with the resistance against cisplatin. Further investigations revealed that PTGS2 served as an essential mediator involved in the developing process of the resistance against cisplatin via mediating the inhibition effects of cisplatin on BCL2 expression. Mechanistically, cisplatin induced PTGS2 expression through ROS/NF-κB pathway. In addition, PTGS2 mediated cisplatin-induced BCL2 expression and subsequent resistance to apoptosis via PGE2/EP4/MAPKs (ERK1/2, P38) axis. Analysis of the clinical specimens demonstrated that PTGS2 and BCL2 were positively correlated in human gastric cancer. Moreover, in the xenograft models, inhibition of PTGS2 by celecoxib significantly augmented the cytotoxic efficacy of cisplatin in the resistant gastric cancer via suppression of PTGS2 and BCL2 expressions regulated by ERK1/2 and P38 signal axis, suggesting PTGS2 might be employed as an adjunctive therapeutic target for reversal of the chemoresistance in a subset of cisplatin resistant gastric cancer.

Abstract: Exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known to participate in myocardial repair after myocardial infarction (MI), but the mechanism remains unclear. Here, we isolated exosomes from adipose-derived MSCs (ADSCs) and examined their effect on MI-induced cardiac damage. To examine the underlying mechanism, H9c2 cells, cardiac fibroblasts, and HAPI cells were used to study the effect of ADSC-exosomes on hypoxia-induced H9c2 apoptosis, TGF-β1-induced fibrosis of cardiac fibroblasts, and hypoxia-induced macrophage M1 polarization using qRT-PCR, western blot, ELISA, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. ADSC-exosome treatment mitigated MI-induced cardiac damage by suppressing cardiac dysfunction, cardiac apoptosis, cardiac fibrosis, and inflammatory responses in vitro and in vivo. In addition, ADSC-exosome treatment promoted macrophage M2 polarization. Further experiments found that S1P/SK1/S1PR1 signaling was involved in the ADSC-exosome-mediated myocardial repair. Silencing of S1PR1 reversed the inhibitory effect of ADSC-exosomes on MI-induced cardiac apoptosis and fibrosis in vitro. ADSC-exosome-induced macrophage M2 polarization was also reversed after downregulation of S1PR1 under hypoxia conditions, which promoted NFκB and TGF-β1 expression, and suppressed the MI-induced cardiac fibrosis and inflammatory response. In sum, these results indicate that ADSC-derived exosomes ameliorate cardiac damage after MI by activating S1P/SK1/S1PR1 signaling and promoting macrophage M2 polarization.

Abstract: Ceramide is emerging as one of the players of inflammation in lung diseases. However, data on its inflammatory role in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) as part of the extracellular machinery driven by lung mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) are missing. We obtained an in vitro model of CF-MSC by treating control human lung MSCs with a specific CFTR inhibitor. We characterized EVs populations derived from MSCs (ctr EVs) and CF-MSCs (CF-EVs) and analyzed their sphingolipid profile by LC–MS/MS. To evaluate their immunomodulatory function, we treated an in vitro human model of CF, with both EVs populations. Our data show that the two EVs populations differ for the average size, amount, and rate of uptake. CF-EVs display higher ceramide and dihydroceramide accumulation as compared to control EVs, suggesting the involvement of the de novo biosynthesis pathway in the parental CF-MSCs. Higher sphingomyelinase activity in CF-MSCs, driven by inflammation-induced ceramide accumulation, sustains the exocytosis of vesicles that export new formed pro-inflammatory ceramide. Our results suggest that CFTR dysfunction associates with an enhanced sphingolipid metabolism leading to the release of EVs that export the excess of pro-inflammatory Cer to the recipient cells, thus contributing to maintain the unresolved inflammatory status of CF.

Abstract: Skin wound healing is a complex physiological process that maintains the integrity of the skin tissues, involving a variety of distinct cell types and signaling molecules. The specific signaling pathways or extracellular cues that govern the healing processes remain elusive. Microvesicles (MVs) have recently emerged as critical mediators of cell communication by delivery of genetic materials to target cells. In this study, we found the direct delivery of HEKa-MVs expressing miR-21 mimics significantly promoted the healing of skin wound in diabetic rats. In-depth studies showed that MV miR-21 promoted fibroblast migration, differentiation, and contraction, induced a pro-angiogenic process of endothelial cells and mediated a pro-inflammatory response. Mechanically, MV miR-21 might target specific essential effector mRNA in fibroblasts such as MMP-1, MMP-3, TIMP3, and TIMP4 to increase MMPs expression and enzymatic activities. Moreover, MV miR-21 regulated ɑ-SMA and N-cadherin to induce fibroblast-myofibroblast differentiation. MV miR-21 up-regulated the IL-6 and IL-8 expressions and their secretion to amplify the immune response. Furthermore, MV miR-21 down-regulated PTEN and RECK in protein level, and activate MAPK/ERK signaling cascade, thereby promoting fibroblast functions. Thus, our study has provided for the first time the basis for the potential application of HEKa-MVs, and MV miR-21 in particular for wound healing.

Abstract: Carrier recombination in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cells is one of the critical factors determining cell performance loss. Additionally, heterointerface recombination is the most detrimental recombination pathway based on the Shockley–Read–Hall mechanism. Various methods have been applied to impede interface recombination, and the introduction of a valence band offset (ΔEV) produced by a homogeneous Cu-deficient layer (CDL) has been proved to be effective for improving cell efficiency. However, the relationship between ΔEV and recombination processes has not yet been fully clarified. In this work, through a Se interval irradiation process, ΔEV was incorporated into CIGS solar cells with bandgap grading so as to explore the correlation between the ΔEV effect and heterointerface recombination, which was demonstrated by both SCAPS-1D simulation and experiment. Moreover, illumination-dependent open-circuit voltage (Suns–Voc) and temperature-dependent open-circuit voltage (Voc–T) measurements were performed to quantitatively estimate the recombination rates at the interface, in the space-charge region (SCR), and in the quasi-neutral region (QNR), contributing to elaboration of the mechanism by which ΔEV serves as a hole barrier at the interface, thereby reducing heterointerface recombination and enhancing cell performance.

Abstract: The aim of this work is to evaluate whether silicon heterojunction solar cells, lacking highly emissive, heavily doped silicon layers, could be better candidates for hybrid photovoltaic thermal collectors than standard aluminium-diffused back contact solar cells. To this end, the near and mid infrared emissivity of full silicon heterojunction solar cells, as well as of its constituent materials – crystalline silicon wafer, indium tin oxide, n-, i- and p-type amorphous silicon – have been assessed by means of ellipsometry and FTIR. The experimental results show that the thermal emissivity of these cells is actually as high as in the more traditional structures, ~80% at 8 μm. Detailed optical modelling combining raytracing and transfer matrix formalism shows that the emissivity in these cells originates in the transparent conductive oxide layers themselves, where the doping is not high enough to result in a reflection that exceeds the increased free carrier absorption. Further modelling suggests that it is possible to obtain lower emissivity solar cells, but that a careful optimization of the transparent conductive layer needs to be done to avoid hindering the photovoltaic performance.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the thermal performances of an adaptive radiator made of 16 electroemissive devices (EEDs) acting as electro-active materials for thermal control of satellites. EEDs are similar to an electrochemical cell where one electrode serves as active layer in the infrared and is made of a conducting polymer, the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), interpenetrated into a polyethylene oxide/nitrile butadiene rubber (PEO/NBR) solid gel electrolyte as supporting matrix. First, EEDs were placed in moderate vacuum (10-3 bars) to estimate their optical cyclability c.a. 4000 cycles in neutral and oxidized state. Then, an electro-emissive radiator (EER) assembled with 16 EEDs (total area of 80cm2) was tested under space vacuum conditions. “Hot” and “cold” operating cases of the satellite were simulated and ability of the radiator to control radiative exchanges between the satellite and its environment was estimated by comparison with the currently used optical solar reflector (OSR) radiators. In low emissivity state, the EER can slow down the rejection of heat in a cold environment which is an interesting feature in terms of energy saving. Also when the EER is not directly exposed to the sun, it is able to reject the heat in the same way as the OSR radiator in a hot phase. By comparing the electrical consumption with a system operating with OSR, an energy saving in the order of 25% was demonstrated. Finally the EER exhibits bistability during many hours, i.e. memory effect once electrically switched into a given emissivity state, allowing to further reduce the electrical consumption.

Abstract: Access to water and clean energy is a major concern in modern society. Although there have been huge improvements in the efficiency of solar interfacial evaporation as a technique to obtain clean water, it remains challenging for solar-driven interfacial evaporation systems to maintain stable steam generation and water production without an energy storage system. To overcome these issues, we propose a coupled tunable photothermal and joule-heating process for interfacial evaporation using a low-cost commercial carbon fiber (CF) material. The CF material had a high porosity, good water absorption, salt-rejection ability, and high total absorption (93%) and electrical conductivity (1666 S/m), which make it suitable for photothermal and joule-heating conversion. By coupling photothermal and joule-heating processes through the same CF material as the evaporation medium, a stable and efficient interfacial evaporation performance could be achieved, in which the input power of the electrical energy could be adjusted to match the loss of solar energy. Through coupled evaporation experiments, it was found that the evaporation rate reached 1.36 kg m−2 h−1, with sun irradiation power of 1 kW m−2. For photothermal conversion or joule-heating conversion, the efficiency first decreased and then increased. “Cold Vapor’’, with a lower input power, resulted in a higher efficiency, whereas heat localization led to a significant decrease in the relative ratio of the thermal losses and improved the efficiency at a higher input power. This work has further improved the multi-process coupling and multi-energy complementary process and will promote its actual application.

Abstract: The directly irradiated solid particle solar receiver (SPSR) is a very useful design due to its ability to safely absorb high solar irradiance fluxes. The heat transfer fluid in the directly irradiated SPSR should consist of solid particles that do not agglomerate or fracture, have a high solar weighted absorptivity and good chemical stability at high temperature. This study analyzes the thermophysical properties, spectral absorptivity and flow stability of candidate solid particles for use in an SPSR. Most particles had excellent thermal and chemical stability following heat treatment at 1000 °C. The thermophysical analysis showed that SiO2 in the particles strongly impacted the specific heat variations with temperature. An insert was added in the quartz hopper to form a semi-annular flow channel and improve the particle flow stability during the discharge process. The measurements show how the heat treatment, operating temperature, particle size, and elemental composition influence the radiative properties. Three particles were found to have the best characteristics for the SPSR. An analysis of the energy conservation showed that the steady-state SPSR thermal efficiency can exceed 65% with the grey ceramsite sand when heated to 1073 K by an average radiant flux of 400 kW/m2.

Abstract: The skull bones are formed by osteoblasts by intramembranous ossification. WNT signaling is a regulator of bone formation. Retinoic Acid (RA) act as a teratogen affecting craniofacial development. We evaluated the effects of RA on the differentiation and mineralization of MC-3T3 cells, and on the expression of WNT components. MC-3T3 were cultured with or without 0.5 μM RA in osteogenic medium and mineralization was assessed by alizarin red staining. The expression of osteogenic marker genes and WNT genes was evaluated at several time points up to 28 days. RA significantly inhibited MC-3T3 mineralization (p < 0.01), without affecting ALP activity or Alp gene expression. Both parameters gradually increased in time. During culture, RA stimulated Runx2 expression at 14 and 28 days compared to the respective controls (p < 0.05). Also, RA significantly reduced Sp7 expression at days 14 and 21 (p < 0.05). Simultaneously, RA significantly reduced the expression of the WNT genes cMyc, Lef1, Lrp5, Lrp6 and Wnt11 compared to the controls (p < 0.05). In contrast, RA increased the expression of the WNT inhibitors Dkk1 at day 21 and Dkk2 at days 14 and 21 (p < 0.01). Our data indicate that RA disrupts osteogenic differentiation and mineralization by inhibiting WNT signaling.

Abstract: Poly(hydroxymethyl 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PhmEDOT) and Poly(3,4- ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) thin films are prepared by electropolymerization method on indium tin oxide conducting glass in this study. Surface morphology of the thin films is observed using a scanning electron microscopy. Electrochemical and electrochromic properties including redox behaviors, UV–Vis absorbance spectra at different applying potentials, coloring/bleaching response times and transmittance modulation ability of the thin films are investigated. Photoelectrochromic devices (PECDs) composed of the PhmEDOT or the PEDOT thin films and dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanodes were assembled, and their photoelectrochromic performances compared. According to the obtained results, the PECD using the PhmEDOT thin film has faster photoelectrochromic coloring/bleaching rates and better transmittance modulation ability than the one using the PEDOT thin film.

Abstract: Hot corrosion by molten salts has detrimental effect on various industrial and infrastructural systems particularly on the Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants. To enhance durability of the CSP plants′ components, while decreasing the production cost of electricity, the graphitization anticorrosion method for carbon steel in contact with molten binary nitrate salt is proposed in this work. To shed some light on the corrosion mechanisms and quantify corrosion rates a combination of advanced material characterization techniques like Focused Ion Beam, SEM, EDX, XPS depth profiling, XRD was applied. It has been demonstrated that the surface spray-coating by graphite reduces the corrosion rate at least by factor of 6 and stabilizes the corrosion scale by iron carbide crystals at 390 °C.

Abstract: Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (ADTKD) is a rare group of disease that affect the tubules of the kidney. There are 4 known subtypes of ADTKD classified based on causative genes and clinical features. In our study, we aimed to identify the causative subtypes of ADTKD in a Tunisian ADTKD family (3 affected members), in whom standard nephrological diagnosis did not provide clear subtype of ADTKD, until genetic testing was performed. Sanger sequencing was performed for UMOD, HNF1β and REN genes. Mutational analysis allowed us to detect a heterozygous mutation in the REN gene: c.1172C > G, (p.T391R) in exon 10. In silico analyses predicted that the novel likely pathogenic mutation affect protein stability and 3D structure. Our study highlights the importance of establishing a genetic diagnosis to identify the subtype of ADTKD for better patient care. To the best of our knowledge, we report here a first Tunisian ADTKD-REN family.

Abstract: Solar-dirven water evaporation is an effective way to utilize solar energy for the fresh water production. In this paper, we constructed a hybrid photothermal conversion material including porous TiO2 foams as the water molecule transfer layer and carbon as the photothermal sensitizer. The amorphous TiO2 porous layer was prepared by the anodization of Ti foam, and then carbon materials were deposited on the surface of TiO2 layers by the hydrothermal-assisted annealing carbonization of fruit (cherry, grape, orange and apple) residue. The investigation indicated that the TiO2 substrate prepared with anodization voltage of 30 V showed the excellent microstructure and photothermal conversion efficiency, and the carbon produced from grape residue had the high evaporation rate of 1.42 kg m−2 h−1 and photothermal conversion efficiency of 59.43% under 1.5 sun irradiation (150 kW/m2). The influence of irradiation power intensity on the water evaporation was also explored, and the photothermal membrane also showed high evaporation efficiency of seawater, and the evaporation rate and photothermal conversion efficiency nearly maintained the stable value, showing superstability after 12 irradiation cycles. Based on our experimental data, the design strategy of hybrid photothermal membranes would provide effective guidance for photothermal materials in applications of seawater desalination and wastewater treatment.

Abstract: Two-dimensional layered transition metal dichalcogenide exhibit important characteristics such as suitable bandgap, high absorption coefficient, and favourable electron transport properties for their uses in nano-electronic such as ultrathin solar cells. We adopted a hybrid simulation approach, where density functional calculations are performed for optoelectronic properties of semiconductor materials and macroscopic device simulation is carried out to evaluate photovoltaic response. We investigated electronic and optical properties of bulk WS2, WSe2 and noticed very high absorption coefficient, making them suitable absorber materials for solar cell. Further, the electronic and optical properties of an ultrathin WSSe Janus layer are investigated using density functional theory and noticed low reflectance and high bandgap, supporting its usefulness as a buffer layer for W(S/Se)2 absorbers. The computed density functional results for W(S/Se)2 and Janus WSSe are used to simulate the photovoltaic response of WSSe/W(S/Se)2 solar cell using macroscopic device simulation. The photovoltaic performance of a single junction solar cell is optimized for W(S/Se)2 absorbers and WSSe Janus buffer materials. The effect of absorber layer thickness, carrier concentration, and contact work function is evaluated to understand the solar cell performance. We noticed that interface recombination speed between absorber and buffer layer and minority carrier lifetime are affecting the solar cell performance. The maximum efficiency of about ~17.73% and 18.87% is noticed for optimized WSSe/WS2 and WSSe/WSe2 solar cell. The present study will provide a new approach to design, develop, and optimize a solar cell and evaluate the impact of different materials parameters on solar cell performance.

Abstract: This work addresses the influence of molten nitrate salt chemistry on the corrosion behavior of a martensitic high temperature steel and an austenitic stainless steel. It is one of the first addressing controlled degradation of Solar Salt by controlling the gas atmosphere on top of the melt, thus driving the formation of corrosive ions, mainly oxide ions but also nitrite ions. The stainless steel and high temperature steel samples are subjected to the different operating conditions to demonstrate the variations in corrosivity as a function of gas atmosphere and additionally of artificially added chloride impurities. The results indicate that the atmosphere has a direct impact on the formation of corrosive oxide and nitrite ions. The low Cr-steel is found to be more sensitive to chloride impurities, while the stainless steel corrosion is enhanced by the presence of nitrites and oxide ions. All studies are supported by profound molten salt analysis throughout the experiments including the analysis of nitrate, nitrite, oxide and chromate ions as well as cation compositions. Steel samples are analyzed by scanning electron microscopy methods and corrosion rates are extrapolated from 1200 h experiments.

Abstract: Wet-chemical approaches were utilized to fabricate electrochromic (EC) thin films of different chemical nature, but compatible to each other in terms of coloration and electrochemical properties. A metallo-supramolecular polyelectrolyte (Fe-MEPE) thin film is shown to exhibit a large visible light transmittance change (Δτv) of 54% when switched from deep blue-violet (Fe2+) to colorless (Fe3+). On the other hand, a soft sol-gel peroxo-based approach was pursued to fabricate non-stoichiometric nickel oxide (Ni1-xO) thin films on transparent conductive glass at low process temperature. Ni1-xO, due to the Ni2+/Ni3+ redox couple, shows an EC response with a Δτv of 44% when switched from a colorless state (Ni2+) to a grey-brown mixed-valence state (Ni2+/Ni3+). Proof-of-concept is provided for a glass-based EC device combining Fe-MEPE and Ni1-xO electrodes. The excellent EC performance is manifested in a Δτv of 28% for the full cell and a low haze of <2%. The EC films presented can be deposited on transparent conductive substrates via spin-coating, dip-coating, or slot-die deposition. The viability of this approach for later industrial production is demonstrated by the example of roll-to-roll (R2R) processing on transparent conductive films (TCF).

Abstract: Cost-effective and scalable solution to fabricate high-performance photothermal materials is the key to enable widespread application for solar steam generation. Herein, we report the facile and scalable fabrication of monolithic porous foam based on cross-linked aromatic polymer (PDVB-PS) using styrene as monomer and divinylbenzene as cross-linking agent through a facile one-step hydrothermal method. The resulting PDVB-PS foam possesses well-controlled porous structure, open channel structure, low apparent density and low thermal conductivity (0.038Wm−1k−1). After modification with sodium alginate and polypyrrole, the as-modified PDVB-PS (named as PPy-coated M-PDVB-PS) shows a superhydrophilic wettability (water contact angle ∼ 0°) and stronger light absorption (ca. 90%), which could dramatically enhance its water transportation ability and photothermal property. Taking advantages of these unique physicochemical properties mentioned above, a high solar-vapor conversion efficiency of 87.6% for the PPy-coated M-PDVB-PS was obtained under 1-sun irradiation, showing great potentials for real applications. More importantly, as a kind of representative synthetic polymers, the success in employment of the PPy-coated M-PDVB-PS as efficient photothermal materials shown in this study may also open a new opportunity for rational design and fabrication of polymer-based solar generators derived from commercial available low-cost raw chemicals with simple and scalable manufacture process for practical solar steam generation on large scale.

Abstract: Silver ants forage at extremely high environmental temperatures, the hairs of which play a crucial role in reducing the body temperature via enhanced optical reflection and radiative heat dissipation as a passive daytime radiative cooler. Inspired by the hierarchical feature structure of the hairs, we fabricated the flexible photonic architectures (FPA) on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). With some modification to the feature structure, the FPA-PDMS exhibited not only a large emittance in the mid-infrared spectral range, comparable with that of state-of-the-art thermal emitters, but also the record-high transmittance and haze in the visible and near-infrared range, which would be particularly appealing to photovoltaic devices for maximizing sunlight absorption and minimizing parasitic heat. The ease of application of the FPA-PDMS was demonstrated in both emerging perovskite and mature commercial crystalline silicon solar cells, where the FPA-PDMS was electrostatically attached to their glass superstrates or covers and the improvements in photovoltaic characteristics as a result of enhanced light harvesting were confirmed through laboratory measurements. Though the synergetic effects of the improved transparency and heat radiation brought by the FPA-PDMS need to be characterized outdoors in the future, these findings pave the way for suppressing optical and thermal losses simultaneously in opto-electric-thermal coupled devices through learning sophistically evolved photonic architectures from nature.

Abstract: Sub-bandgap sunlight provides a source of heat generation in solar cells that is detrimental to performance, especially in space applications where heat dissipation is limited. In this work we assess the impact that an advanced rear-side contact scheme for multi-junction solar cells has on the cell temperature. Our results show that this scheme reduces the optical power absorption below the bandgap of germanium by 81% compared to a standard, full metallization design. Measurements of the electrical and thermal power fluxes performed in vacuum demonstrate that this lower near-infrared light absorption results in 8% less heat dissipated in the cell with the novel rear-side contact scheme when operating at 25 °C. Modelling of the operating temperature for both cells when fully encapsulated with glass indicates that this effect will also result in a reduction of the operating temperature of 9 °C for the novel design.

Abstract: Chemical crosslinking is an important strategy for preparation of form stable phase change materials (FSPCMs). However, the influence of different crosslinking structure on the properties of FSPCMs is not very clear currently. In this work, PEG-based FSPCMs are synthesized by free-radical polymerization. They possess different crosslinking densities, and the location of PEG moieties include two different sites (backbone or side chain). The chemical structure, phase change property, crystal structure, mechanical performance, and thermal reliability of the FSPCMs are studied and compared with respect to their different crosslinking structure. It is found that the phase change enthalpy and degree of crystallinity increase with decreasing crosslinking density, and PEG moieties locating in side chain is preferable. With decreasing crosslinking density, the spherulites of the FSPCMs become larger, but always smaller than that of pristine PEG. The results can be explained by the restriction on movement/assembly of PEG moieties by the crosslinking network. The mechanical performance of FSPCMs with PEG moieties located in backbone is preferable than that in side chain. Tensile strength is maximized with poly(ethylene glycol) acrylate (Mn = 12000) as monomer, and elongation at break increases monotonically with decreasing crosslinking density. The findings of this work will contribute to the future design of FSPCMs with optimized overall thermal energy storage and mechanical properties.

Abstract: Improving the optical transmittance and electrical conductivity in transparent conductors (TC) has been a critical issue for decades due to their numerous applications. In this paper, we suggest an approach to produce extremely conductive TC material from electroplated Ni microfiber networks (NiMFs) in order to achieve highly efficient and aesthetically superior thin-film solar cells and modules. The high cross-sectional aspect ratio of NiMFs significantly enhanced their electrical conductivity and optical transmittance simultaneously. The TC structure employing NiMFs was a successful substitute for conventional patterned grids in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 thin-film solar cells because it reduced the series resistance, which is especially advantageous for large-area cells. The NiMF-induced transmittance loss was compensated for by the formation of a light diffusion layer on the NiMF. We propose that the excellent performance of NiMF TC materials enables the elimination or significant reduction of the grids in thin-film solar cells and modules.

Abstract: Sb2S3 semiconductor is among the absorber materials that have currently received an increased attention from scientific community since it presents adequate physical properties for solar cell fabrication. In addition, it is also based on abundant and relatively low-toxic elements. Nevertheless, so far, Sb2S3 solar cells in planar configuration are limited to efficiency values lower than 8%, being mechanisms behind such low performances still unknown. In this work we perform theoretical calculations to study the impact of recombination mechanisms at both Sb2S3 bulk material and Sb2S3/CdS interface on solar cells, in order to explain low efficiencies reported for this technology, for the first time. The comparison of model outcomes to the experimental data reported in the literature demonstrates good correspondence. It is found that current Sb2S3 solar cells are dominated by a combination of factors such as non-ideal series and shunt resistances, Sb2S3 non-radiative recombination and Sb2S3/CdS interface recombination. By improving Sb2S3/CdS interface and Sb2S3 bulk material quality, a solar cell efficiency of 11.8% could be achieved, which is limited by the effect of series and shunt resistances. Therefore, the same attention should be paid to both defects and resistances to promote device efficiency over 12%, achieving a new record value of 18.4%. Conditions under which each loss mechanism is dominant are presented and discussed. Finally, it is demonstrated that under optimized conditions and with the use of an antireflection coating layer, an efficiency about 20% is expected.

Abstract: Accumulating evidence suggests that IL-9 and IL-9-producing cells exert various roles in antitumor immunity. Our study examined the IL-9 production in CD8+ T cells from breast cancer patients as compared to healthy controls. IL-9 secretion was undetectable in CD8+ T cells ex vivo, but could be readily detected following anti-TCR or PMA + ionomycin stimulation, and was higher in breast cancer patients than in healthy controls. The capacity to express IL-9 was not universal to all CD8+ T cells, but was favored in IL-9Rhigh CD8+ T cells, which were also present in breast cancer patients at significantly higher frequency than in healthy controls. Interestingly, exogenous IL-9 could significantly increase the expression of both IL-9 and IL-9R in IL-9Rhigh, but not IL-9Rlow, CD8+ T cells. IL-9Rhigh CD8+ T cells ex vivo presented lower expression of KLRG-1, PD-1, and Tim-3 than IL-9Rlow CD8+ T cells. Additionally, IL-9Rhigh CD8+ T cells following anti-TCR and PMA + ionomycin stimulation presented higher IL-2 and IL-17 expression, and lower IFN-γ expression, than IL-9Rlow CD8+ T cells. IL-9-expressing CD8+ T cells could be found in some, but not all, resected breast tumors. IL-9R expression, on the other hand, was readily present in CD8+ T cells, but with high variability from patient to patient. Patients with high intratumoral IL-9 expression also tended to present high IL-9R expression. Together, these data demonstrate that a transcriptionally distinctive IL-9-producing CD8+ T cell subset was elevated in breast cancer patients and could be found inside the tumor, with higher capacity to produce IL-2 and IL-17 and lower expression of inhibitory receptors.

Abstract: High temperature phase change materials (PCMs)-encapsulated microcapsules with large heat exchange area for addressing specific energy storage have increasing application potentials in many fields. Herein, a novel hybrid multiwalled microcapsule LiF@GO@SiO2 with high phase change temperature was designed and fabricated, which could overcome strong corrosion and volume expansion of lithium fluoride (LiF) during heat storage process. The multiwalled structure of microcapsule contained three layers, consisting of volume expansion buffer layer polydopamine (PDA), anti-corrosion leakage-proof layer (GO) and heat-resist strength layer (SiO2), respectively. Volume expansion buffer layer would be vanished during thermal cycling, and GO as well as SiO2 layers played important roles in protecting molten LiF from leakage. A series of tests including SEM, SEM-EDS, FTIR, XPS, XRD and TGA revealed that three-layer shells were sequentially coated on the surface of core material LiF successfully. Besides, DSC results via quantitatively analyzing, indicated that LiF@GO@SiO2 microcapsules had high phase change temperature of 848 °C, encapsulation ratio of 82.0% and latent melting heat of 894.5 J/g. In addition, encapsulation ratio of the microcapsule had a minor deflection within 5% after 10 times loops by calculating and comparing corresponding enthalpies, which displayed prepared microcapsule could be used repeatedly in high temperature energy storage. Overall, our results opened new avenues for the utilization of high temperature PCMs and their packaging technique.

Abstract: Crystalline molybdenum oxide nanoparticles (MoO3 NPs) were prepared by laser ablation synthesis in solution (LASiS). The resulting MoO3 NPs are water suspended with average size of 23 nm. Subsequently, in order to produce hole injection layers for solar cells, these nanoparticles were processed as thin films onto indium tin oxide (ITO)/glass substrate using ultrasonic spray deposition, which allows fast and uniform deposition in large areas with controllable thickness and low roughness; the water is removed by heating the substrate during the processing. Moreover, scanning electronic microscopy images pointed out that the bottom of the films is mainly composed of small nanoparticles. Thereafter, the optimized glass/ITO/MoO3NPs/PTB7:PC71BM/Ca/Al solar cells displayed open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.75 V, short circuit current density (Jsc) of 13 mA/cm2, fill factor (FF) of 58% and power conversion efficiency of 5.7% under AM1.5 illumination, presenting increased stability when compared with devices having polymeric hole transporting layer. Since LASiS method does not require the use of organic precursors/solvents, it is a green route to produce MoO3 NPs. In addition, the ultrasonic spray deposition is a versatile method to achieve homogeneous and transparent thin films from water suspended nanoparticles. The organic solar cell response pointed out the potential use of these procedures to produce hole injection layers for photovoltaic devices.

Abstract: The ‘Solar salt’ (60% NaNO3-40% KNO3, wt. %) is the most used heat transfer and storage material in high temperature CSP systems. The main drawback is its high melting temperature of 228 °C, which requires extra-energy to keep it in the liquid state and avoid damage to pipes at low temperatures. Multi-component salts are combinations of different cations and anions. The difference in size of the ions hinders the crystallization of the material and provides lower melting temperatures. Multi-component salts are considered in this study to replace simpler combinations, such as binary and ternary eutectic mixtures. Herein, we report on two novel six-component nitrates with a melting temperature of 60–75 °C and a thermal stability up to ~500 °C under a linear heating program in N2 atmosphere. Properties such as the thermal conductivity in solid and molten state, heat capacity and vibrational spectra were evaluated. The study of the thermal behaviour of these materials using differential scanning calorimetry was insufficient, hence alternative and complementary techniques were used, such as: the three-omega technique, optical transmission and Raman spectroscopy. Multi-component salts were found to solidify as amorphous solids even at slow cooling rates and water was found to behave as a catalyst of crystallization.

Abstract: Flexible monolithic silica aerogel was prepared using an ambient pressure drying method without extra modifying and solvent-exchange process by controlling the crosslinking degree of the network and in-situ modification of methyl groups to the siloxane backbone. The introduction of the CH3-riched trimethylmethoxysilane (TMMS) molecules transforms silica clusters from originally rigid network structure with high crosslinking degree into flexible network structure with low crosslinking degree, not only improving the flexibility of the aerogel, but also endowing the hydrophobic property. The monolith feature, flexibility, hierarchical porous structure and hydrophobicity make the aerogel an ideal porous support for fabricating shape-stabilized phase change materials (PCMs). The obtained monolithic Paraffin (PA)/Aerogel composite shows high loading amount of PCMs, enhanced phase change enthalpy and good thermal stability. It is convenient to produce diverse shapes of monolithic composite PCMs to satisfy a range of specific requirements for energy storage applications.

Abstract: Luminescent Solar Concentrators (LSC) have been extensively analysed from the point of view of design to improve its performance, but there are still open questions about long-term stability at outdoor conditions, which reduce its commercial interest. A study of photo-stability of a LSC is presented in this work. The prototype consists in an organic dye, encapsulated at pilot scale (10 × 10 cm2) to reproduce real operating conditions. Outdoor monitoring and indoor aging tests are performed to evaluate what are the critical failures, their cause, and possible mitigation solutions to provide long-term stability to the LSC device. A correlation between encapsulating materials and dye photoluminescence properties is identified, which clarify the photo-degradation mechanism of the LSC. These results provide a better comprehension of the design strategies required to ensure the required operational stability for the industrialization of these devices.

Abstract: The ability of electrical insulating materials within a module to act as insulators is a key safety requirement for photovoltaic (PV) technology. Presently, however, the durability of backsheets may not be readily assessed. For example, the mechanical tensile test continues to be developed, and its use has not been validated such that a technically based pass/fail criteria may be established. This study examines the use of simple indentation methods, including durometer hardness and instrumented indentation, as a means to quantitively assess the degradation of PV backsheets. Characteristics including: hardness, modulus, load/displacement profile, creep hold response, and residual impression are explored in an empirical study. Glass/encapsulant/backsheet mini-modules constructed using backsheets including: polyamide (specifically the AAA backsheet product), poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), polyvinyl fluoride (PVF) laminate (“TPE”), and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) were examined. An M-type durometer as well as Berkovich and cube-corner tips were used in the indentation experiments. Additional characterizations were performed to interpret the indentation measurements including: surface roughness measurements using atomic force microscopy (AFM), a chemical structure study using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and phase-transition measurements using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results are analyzed in the context of the combined accelerated stress test (C-AST) also explored in this study. Instrumented indentation (i.e., using a Berkovich tip) was able to distinguish between backsheets and quantify the effects of accelerated testing (including up to 60%, 25%, and 20% change in hardness, modulus, and creep displacement, respectively). The embrittlement of the backsheets was not readily assessable using cube-corner indentation. Cracking of the known-bad polyamide backsheet was observed from the C-AST, which was not observed to result from steady state UV weathering.

Abstract: Hot electrons produced by the surface plasmon decay can be efficiently utilized to drive photochemical reactions on a semiconductor surface. Considering this aspect of plasmonics, we have evaluated the visible light photocatalytic performance of Ag–TiO2(B)–C3N4 and Au–TiO2(B)–C3N4 heterostructures in the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) and phenol. The synergetic effect of plasmonic hot electron injection and interfacial charge transfer in the heterostructures lead to 6–9 fold enhancement in the photodecomposition rate of RhB (phenol) over TiO2(B) and C3N4. Time-resolved photoluminescence study shows fast charge transfer through the integrated network of the heterostructure. The photocurrent is measured at 470 nm, 510 nm and 575 nm, near the plasmonic excitations of Ag and Au as well as under white light illumination (400–800 nm). Plasmonic systems show more than 6-fold enhancement in photocurrent over bare TiO2(B) under illumination near monochromatic plasmonic excitation. The overall photocurrent resulting from white light illumination is 2-fold stronger than that under plasmonic excitation. The increase is due to the contribution from Ti3+ excitation, hot electron injection, and charge transfer from TiO2(B) to C3N4. We propose that Ti3+ states in TiO2(B) provide channels for direct hot electron transfer from metal to semiconductor facilitating charge separation for participation in photocatalysis.

Abstract: Reflector materials directly affect the performance of concentrating solar applications such as solar thermal power plants or process heat installations. For concentrating collectors the specular reflectance and scattering of reflector materials in the near specular range is of special relevance for a good performance. In this article, we show characteristic bidirectional scatter and specular reflectance curves for solar materials, such as glass-based, polymer-based and aluminum-based reflectors, measured using the instrument VLABS, a commercial reflectometer and a spectrophotometer. The solar weighted specular reflectance is a relevant performance indicator, allowing the comparison of the different reflectors. However, usually it is not measured in solar laboratories. This is why this article presents a method for modelling of solar weighted specular reflectance based on hemispheric reflectance and single wavelength measurements. The model applies surface scatter theory and the concept of total integrated scatter. It allows to predict the specular reflectance for the solar spectral range. The application of the model to solar reflector materials with different surface roughness features and the impact of beam spread on the solar weighted specular reflectance is shown. The methodology allows for an improved evaluation and comparison of innovative reflector materials for solar applications.

Abstract: Highly ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNTAs) have been controllably prepared by anodizing Ti foils and been used as the support for co-depositing noble Au–Pt quantum dots (QDs) with good dispersion. Well dispersed Au–Pt nanoparticles around 5 nm have been simultaneously deposited on the TNTAs through a facilely simultaneous photo-irradiation-reduction method. The prepared samples have been well-characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, XPS, UV–Vis and EC-AFM methods. The photo-degradation of Rh B under visible light (with a 420 nm cutoff) has been used as a model response to characterize the photocatalytic properties of the prepared samples; and the co-decorated Au–Pt/TNTAs show a remarkable enhancement of visible-light-driven photocatalytic properties with good stability. This shows that the co-decorated Au–Pt quantum dots could effectively utilize the visible light and suppress the recombination of electron-hole pair, although the loaded amount is ultra-low, which induces an optimized photocatalytic activity under visible light.

Abstract: Vacuum adsorption was conducted to fabricate bio-based polyethylene glycol (PEG)/wood flour (WF) composites as novel shape-stable phase change materials (SSPCMs). The structure–property relationships and comprehensive performance of PEG/WF phase change materials (PCMs) prepared with different average molecular weights of PEG and different length-to-diameter ratios of WF were investigated through various characterization techniques. The relationship between the average molecular weight and mass content of PEG with the properties and structure of the prepared PEG/WF PCMs was evaluated. Leakage test results showed that WF with a high length-to-diameter ratio (HWF) exhibited much higher adsorption capacity for PEG than that of WF with a low length-to-diameter ratio (LWF). The maximum adsorption content of PEG was found to be 70 wt% in those PEG/HWF PCMs and both proceeded with excellent shape stability without leakage when the average molecular weight of PEG was more than 4000. The maximum content of PEG1000 in novel PEG/HWF PCMs without any leakage above the melting point of PEG was 75 wt%. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy results indicated that physical interactions occurred between WF and PEG, but chemical reactions did not take place. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis demonstrated that the crystallization of PEG in SSPCMs decreased. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis demonstrated that the phase transition temperature did not depend on the content and length-to-diameter ratio of the WF. Simultaneously, the highest melting latent heat of the prepared PEG/HWF SSPCM was 108.6 J/g, and its enthalpy efficiency reached more than 75.05%. Thermal cycling test and TGA analysis results demonstrated that PEG/WF SSPCMs had good thermal reliability and chemical stability and showed potential for applications in solar thermal energy storage and biomass energy.

Abstract: We report the improvement of Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) solar cells via doping NaErF4@NaYF4 (NEYF) nanoparticles. The NEYF nanoparticles were doped into the CZTSSe layer as an absorber in a solar cell with the conventional structure of SLG/Mo/absorber/CdS/i-ZnO/ITO/Al. It is found that NEYF doping could increase open circuit voltage (VOC), short circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) of the CZTSSe solar cell, which enables the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) increase from 4.03% of CZTSSe solar cell up to 7.10%. For the solar cell with a NEYF-doped CZTSSe (CZTSSe:NEYF) absorber, the improved VOC and JSC are mainly due to the decrease in reverse saturation current density (J0) and the improvement in photocurrent density (JL) brought by NEYF doping, while the enhancement in fill factor should be ascribed to the decreased series resistance (Rs). The mechanisms of change in the J0, JL, Rs and band gap (Eg) from NEYF doping are discussed in detail by comparative study of composition, structure and electrical properties of the CZTSSe:NEYF and CZTSSe films as well as interfacial structures of CZTSSe:NEYF and CZTSSe solar cells in the present work.

Abstract: A novel electrochromic material consisting of a phosphonate-substituted triarylamine (TAA-P) precursor on mesoporous antimony doped tin oxide (ATO) was prepared. When subjected to anodic potential, surface-confined TAA-P undergoes in situ dimerization as demonstrated by electrochemical and spectroscopic methods. The newly formed dimer tetra-N-phenyl benzidine (TPB) exhibits multi-electrochromic behavior, from colorless TPB0 via the bronze colored radical TPB+•, and further to green TPB2+ species. The films show a remarkably fast electrochromic response (2.6 s for coloring and 0.3 s for bleaching), high coloration efficiency (−280 cm2/C), and high electrochromic contrast (ΔT = 82% at 700 nm) when switched between colorless and dark green states. The comparison of TPB@ATO with an analogues titanium dioxide hybrid film (TPB@TiO2) revealed the importance of electronic conductivity within the inorganic semiconductor scaffold present in ATO but missing in TiO2 at positive potentials. We have prepared an electrochromic film with the ability to switch from colorless to dark green within a very short time, paving the path for state-of-the-art applications such as optical shutters.

Abstract: The influence of PCBM on the electronic energy levels of P3HT:PCBM photocathodes was investigated in a non-aqueous electrolyte using a benzoquinone redox couple. The presence of PCBM introduces a density of interface states at the semiconductor-electrolyte interface, consequently leading to the formation of an interfacial dipole layer and decrease in the built-in potential developed at the semiconductor-electrolyte interface. Photoelectrochemical measurements reveal a decrease in photovoltage from 0.26 V to 0.16 V and cathodic shift in onset potential from -0.27 V to -0.34 V (vs. Ag/Ag+) as PCBM content of the P3HT:PCBM photocathode is increased from 0 through 50 wt%. Additionally, depletion layer widths decreased from 90 nm to 50 nm. When the thickness of the active layer was controlled to coincide with the depletion layer thickness (e.g., 90 nm), photocurrent densities at pristine P3HT photocathodes were found to be higher than for P3HT:PCBM photocathodes. This suggests that the built-in electric field within the active layer is seemingly capable of effective exciton dissociation in the absence of a fullerene acceptor.

Abstract: Perovskite-based solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as a very promising solar photovoltaic technology with fivefold increase observed in the device efficiency within less than 10 years of its inception. The efficiency of these solar cells is strongly affected by the quality of perovskite layer surface coverage and its grain size. Although use of antisolvents such as chlorobenzene has been used to treat methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) resulting in grain size of ca. 200–300 nm, one still needs to minimize the grain boundaries to reduce their impact on recombination. In this study, we have successfully incorporated [6, 6]-phenyl-C70-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM) acceptor as an additive in the perovskite layer of the mesoscopic solar cell devices, which not only leads to the formation of larger grains with fewer grain boundaries resulting in reduced charge carriers recombination, the band alignment between CH3NH3PbI3 and TiO2 was also found to improve. The device having the optimum PC70BM concentration in perovskite showed enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) due to improvement in current density (JSC) and fill-factor (FF), correlated to the decrease in charge transfer resistance (RCT). The devices using PC70BM additive exhibit over 15% improvement in the power conversion efficiency or PCE (15.5% for PC70BM containing device and 13.3% PCE for the reference device with no acceptor additive). More importantly, the device containing PC70BM acceptor additive, retained ca. 75% of the original PCE for 250 h when kept at 85 °C without encapsulation in an ambient at 20% RH.

Abstract: Bifacial and semitransparent hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) thin-film solar cells were prepared with front and rear transparent conducting oxide (TCO) contacts using a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition process. Increased power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and average visible transmissions (AVTs) in the visible wavelength range were realized in the cases of the bifacial and semitransparent solar cells based on the optimization of the device designs, such as front TCO contacts, intrinsic a-Si:H absorbers (i-a-Si:H), p-type hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon carbide, and n-type hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon layers. The dependencies of the performance parameters of the solar cells on the illumination direction and intensity were also investigated systematically. As the film thickness of the i-a-Si:H absorber layers increased from 150 nm to 450 nm, the PCEs of the solar cells respectively increased in the ranges of 6.01–7.50% and 5.25–6.25% when front and rear illuminations were used for a standard light intensity of 100 mW/cm2, while the AVTs decreased from 22.76% to 15.67% irrespective of illumination direction. The best PCEs of the bifacial and semitransparent solar cells that were fabricated with the use of optimal conditions were respectively equal to 7.94% and 6.20% when front and rear illumination conditions were used. The corresponding AVT was equal to 14.34%. The performance parameters of bifacial and semitransparent a-Si:H solar cells at varying illumination intensities in the range of 10–100 mW/cm2 were also investigated, and yielded consistent PCE values in the range of 6.39–6.62% with front illumination, and 4.95–5.15% with rear illumination.

Abstract: In this study, aluminum gallium nitride/gallium nitride heterostructure grown on the sapphire substrate is used as the photoanodes for the generation of hydrogen gas and formic acid through water photoelectrolysis and carbon dioxide reduction, respectively, in photoelectrochemical reaction. These processes are conducted using carbon dioxide-containing sodium chloride aqueous solution and seawater, as the electrolytes. The typical production rates of formic acid and hydrogen gas produced from photoanodes made of aluminum gallium nitride/gallium nitride heterostructure are significantly higher than those of photoanodes made of a single gallium nitride epitaxial layer. This enhancement in production rate is attributed to facilitated transport of photogenerated electrons by two-dimensional electron gas at the aluminum gallium nitride/gallium nitride interface from the working area to the ohmic metal electrode on the photoelectrodes.

Abstract: Roofs with high-reflectance (solar reflectance) coating, commonly known as cool roofs, can stay cool in the sun, thereby reducing building energy consumption and mitigating the urban heat island. However, chemical-physical degradation and biological growth can decrease their solar reflectance and the ability to save energy. In this study, the solar spectral reflectance of 12 different roofing products with an initial albedo of 0.56–0.90 was measured before exposure and once every three months over 32 months. Specimens were exposed on the roofs of dormitory buildings in Xiamen and Chengdu, each major urban areas with hot summers. The albedos of high and medium-lightness coatings stabilized in the ranges 0.45–0.62 and 0.36–0.59 in both cities, respectively. This study yielded albedo loss exceeded those reported in the latest Chinese standard by 0.08–0.15. Finally, DesignBuilder (EnergyPlus) simulations estimate that a new cool roof with albedo 0.78 on a six-story dormitory building will yield annual site energy savings (heating and cooling) for the top floor, which are 8.01 kWh/m2 (24.2%) and 9.12 kWh/m2 (26.3%) per unit floor area in Xiamen and Chengdu, respectively; while an aged cool roof with albedo 0.45 and 0.56 will yield the annual savings by 5.12 kWh/m2 (15.4%) and 2.47 kWh/m2 (10.5%) in these two cities.

Abstract: Reducing the as-cut thickness of silicon wafers is one of the key issues to significantly lower the manufacturing costs of the photovoltaic industry. The pursuit of this objective is encouraged by the outstanding development of diamond wire sawing technology, which in addition to being twice more productive, also has great potential for further kerf reduction. However, in order to avoid higher breakage rates, it is crucial to understand how the sawing process affects the mechanical resistance of wafers as their thickness decreases. In this study, wafers of 180, 160 and 140 μm thickness were cut out of monocrystalline and multicrystalline silicon bricks. Their mechanical strength was evaluated by performing 4-line bending tests coupled with finite element simulations. The specimens were loaded in the parallel and perpendicular direction with respect to the saw marks. Because of the particular shape and orientation of the sawing-induced defects, all tested wafers are significantly weaker in parallel loading. While monocrystalline and multicrystalline wafers exhibit similar mechanical strength when bent perpendicular to the sawing marks, multicrystalline wafers are 30% less resistant in parallel loading. Finally, it is shown that the fracture stress of a wafer of a given silicon quality is independent of its thickness.

Abstract: Organic-inorganic lead halide perovskites have shown great potential in efficient photovoltaic devices. However, there are issues related to device stability and reliability and the high power conversion efficiencies (PCE) are typically demonstrated on cell areas much less than 0.2 cm2. The main challenges which limit high efficiencies in larger area devices lie on the low temperature solution processing methods which typically produce lower quality perovskites with defects (pinholes and traps) and the undesired increase in series resistance with cell area. Herein, the control of the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) adduct intermediate phase for the formation of the defect-free perovskite layer and their suitability for larger area solar cells are investigated. We have also selected different conducting substrates, namely indium tin oxide (ITO) with sheet resistance of 10 Ω/□ and fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates with sheet resistances of 7 and 15 Ω/□ to characterize the effect of substrate sheet resistance and transparency on the photovoltaic performance in large area devices. We demonstrate high PCEs of 18.2% for small area devices (0.16 cm2) and 15.1% for large area device (2 cm2) using the DMSO-enriched recipe. In addition, enhanced device stability was observed, where the devices sustained 94% of their initial efficiency after 105 days without encapsulation. These results confirm that the fine control of adduct intermediate phase for reduced-defect perovskite film provides a simple and universal solution for larger area, efficient and stable perovskite solar cells.

Abstract: Amorphous metal coatings were developed to improve the corrosion resistance of structural alloys in molten salts for use as salt-facing materials in concentrating solar power (CSP) and molten salt reactor (MSR) applications. Three coatings were tested. One Fe-based, fully amorphous coating, and two Ni-based partially amorphous coatings. The candidate coatings were applied to samples made from Ni-based alloy 230, and exposed to KCl–MgCl2 at 750 °C for 300 h in sealed Mo capsules. After exposure, uncoated alloy 230 samples were depleted in chromium near the surface, as measured by SEM-EDS. The attack had an average depth of 33 μm. All three coatings performed well, showing no observable degradation during exposure, despite chromium contents between 20% and 40%. XRD and TEM measurements showed the coatings were fully crystallized after exposure, so the excellent corrosion resistance can likely be attributed to the recrystallized microstructure of the coatings.

Abstract: Due to the huge consumption of energy and shortage of resources, passive cooling is becoming an efficient way for saving energy with a function of reducing energy consumption. This work presents a multifunctional SiO2@TiO2/ZnO laminated coating with high luminous transmittance, self-cleaning capability and radiative cooling performance used for energy-efficient windows. SiO2@TiO2 nanospheres as an upper coating were designed as antireflection layer to achieve high luminous transmittance and degradation layer to achieve self-cleaning. While ZnO nanorods as an undercoat were designed as highly reflective layer to realize radiative cooling and support layer to stabilize upper layer. The bilayer coating exhibits excellent antireflective property for reducing 16% reflectivity in the visible region, thus increasing transmittance up to 73%. TiO2 behaves well on degradation of organic pollutants, as it can completely decompose organic matter within 3 h under UV radiation. This would have a positive impact on the self-cleaning ability of the as-fabricated laminated coating and further beneficial for increasing indoor brightness. Both infrared reflectance spectra and infrared thermal images provide valid evidence of high infrared reflectance and outstanding radiative cooling performance. The reflectivity of the laminated coating is 50.25% higher than that of the blank glass, so the temperature gets 4.5 °C reduction under the same radiation conditions. Therefore, SiO2@TiO2/ZnO laminated coating shows great potential in application of energy-efficient windows and may have an inspiration on developments of smart windows.

Abstract: Within the last years, an increased occurrence of backsheet cracking, especially of Polyamide-based backsheets, was observed in PV installations and reported in literature. Thus, a detailed failure analysis on cracked polymeric backsheets was performed in order to identify the drivers leading to the unexpected behaviour of the Polyamide multilayer composites. Using a unique combination of analytical tools allowed for deducing a spatially resolved representation of material degradation effects within a PV module for the first time. The correlation of local material degradation effects with the influence zones of external and internal stresses enables the derivation of the main factors for the formation of different types of cracks in Polyamide backsheets.

Abstract: The constantly refreshed efficiency records have put the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) at the forefront of photovoltaic research. Power conversion efficiency (PCE) is a key factor as well as the most intuitive parameter to assess the photovoltaic performance of a PSC. This work proposes an easier and faster scheme to simulate PCEs of PSCs only using the reflectance and transmittance data of the perovskite materials. Taking the CH3NH3PbI3 PSC and the Cs2AgBiBr6 PSC as examples, the complex refractive indices of CH3NH3PbI3 and Cs2AgBiBr6 are derived from the experimentally measured reflectance and transmittance spectra, which are then used in the transfer matrix method to simulate the process of light propagating through the PSC. The light absorption derived from the transfer matrix method determines the photo-generated current in the current-voltage characteristics. Influences of the series resistance and the shunt resistance on PCEs are also taken into account. The best-performing CH3NH3PbI3 and Cs2AgBiBr6 PSCs fabricated in this work exhibit PCEs of 15.72% and 1.55%. By comparison, simulations predict PCEs of 18.45% and 4.64%, which are slightly overestimated but reasonable.

Abstract: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a highly heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders that are more commonly diagnosed in boys than in girls. The reasons for gender differences in ASD are unknown and no definitive current evidence can explain male predominance. Therefore, in search for laboratory biomarkers responsible for ASD, a comprehensive metabolomics study was performed by metabolic profiling of urine samples in 51 ASD subjects and 51 age- and sex-matched children with typical development. Orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) models with poor quality failed to perform the analysis based on gender in the ASD and control groups. OPLS-DA models based on single-sex samples, especially in female subjects, had better clustering between the ASD and control groups with an increase in the R2 and Q2 values compared with those in the whole group. Significantly increased levels of adenine, 2-Methylguanosine, creatinine, and 7alpha-hydroxytestololactone and a decrease in creatine were observed in the female ASD subjects. In particular, 7alpha-hydroxytestololactone, which has a structure similar to that of testolactone, was positively correlated with adenine (Pearson correlation coefficient, r = 0.738, p < 0.01), creatinine (r = 0.826, p < 0.01), and 2-Methylguanosine (r = 0.757, p < 0.01) and negatively correlated with creatine (r=-0.413, p < 0.05). A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis using the creatinine:creatine ratio yielded an area under the curve of 0.913 (95% CI: 0.806–1). These metabolites may be sex-related or sex-sensitive to an extent and can be valuable for identification of the molecular pathways involved in the gender bias in manifestation of ASD. The creatinine:creatine ratio has a potential to be a good predictor of ASD in the female subjects.

Abstract: Kaposi Sarcoma Herpes Virus (KSHV) is an oncovirus belonging to the human gammaherpesvirus family, able to infect several immune cell types including B cells, dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes. In this study, we found that KSHV infection of monocytes counteracted the Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) increase induced by Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor (M-CSF), prevented c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) phosphorylation and inhibited autophagy, leading to an impairment of cell survival and differentiation into macrophages. We also show that, to further dysregulate immune response in monocytes, KSHV reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF α) while increased the release of the immune suppressive cytokine Interleukin-10 (IL-10). These results unveils new strategies put in place by KSHV to induce immune suppression and to persist into the infected host.

Abstract: Perovskite photovoltaics has emerged as a promising technology for highly efficient and low-cost solar cells. Further advances in the power conversion efficiencies are awaited by improved light harvesting concepts. One promising route to improve the current-generation in the perovskite solar cells employs nanophotonic perovskite layers. This work reports on a facile route to fabricate nanophotonic perovskite solar cells with enhanced current generation by employing thermal nanoimprint lithography. The nanoimprinted perovskite solar cells show a relative increase in power conversion efficiency by 2% with respect to their planar reference devices. The enhancement in the external quantum efficiency near the bandgap of the nanoimprinted perovskite solar cells by the coupling of the incident light to quasi-guided modes is analyzed in detail. As an outlook, the potential of the nanoimprinting route for semi-transparent perovskite solar cells is discussed via numerical simulations with relative enhancements in short-circuit current density of up to 9%. This increase is particularly promising for nanophotonic perovskite-based multi-junction solar cells.

Abstract: Indium antimonide photovoltaic cells are specifically designed and fabricated for use in a near-field thermophotovoltaic device demonstrator. The optimum conditions for growing the p-n junction stack of the cell by means of solid-source molecular beam epitaxy are investigated. Then processing of circular micron-sized mesa structures, including passivation of the side walls, is described. The resulting photovoltaic cells, cooled down to around 77 K in order to operate optimally, exhibit excellent performances in the dark and under far-field illumination by thermal sources in the [600–1000] °C temperature range. A short-circuit current beyond 10 μA, open-circuit voltage reaching almost 85 mV, fill factor of 0.64 and electrical power at the maximum power point larger than 0.5 μW are measured for the cell with the largest mesa diameter under the highest illumination. These results demonstrate that these photovoltaic cells will be suitable for measuring a near-field enhancement of the generated electrical power.

Abstract: Odontoblasts forms dentin as the main hard tissue of the tooth. Autophagy is a highly conserved homeostasis involved in odontoblast differentiation. DSPP (Dentin sialophosphoprotein) and Cbfα1 (Core binding factor α1) are typical factors in odontoblasts of the dentin-pulp complex. However, the relationship between Cbfα1 and DSPP as well as the role of Cbfα1 involved in the autophagy during odontoblast differentiation are poorly understood. In this study, we found the stimulation with FGF2 in MDPC-23 cells resulted in the suppression of autophagy and promotion of cell differentiation. We demonstrated that both mRNA and protein levels of Cbfα1 and DSPP were elevated upon FGF2 stimulation coupled with the inhibition of autophagy in MDPC-23 cells. Further results revealed that overdose of Cbfα1 increased the expression of DSPP, and also suppressed autophagy in MDPC-23 cells. Using luciferase reporter assay and EMSA, we illustrated that Cbfα1 upregulated DSPP expression through binding to the specific sites 5′-TACCTCA (-3950 bp to -3944 bp) and 5′-ACCACA (-3106 bp to -3101 bp) in DSPP promoter. Furthermore, ChIP assay results revealed that FGF2 treatment enhanced this binding of Cbfα1 to DSPP promoter. Signaling pathway inhibitor screening further revealed Cbfα1 suppressed autophagy involved in Wnt I signaling. Moreover, knockdown of Cbfα1 using siRNA silencing approach reversed the FGF2-mediated suppression of autophagy in MDPC-23 cells. Thus, these findings illustrate a novel regulatory mechanism by which Cbfα1 transcriptionally enhances DSPP expression, and also provide an insight into the inhibitory action of Cbfα1 in autophagy thereby facilitating odontoblast differentiation upon FGF2 stimulation.

Abstract: A solid-state electrochromic (EC) device with high thermal durability was successfully fabricated by the combination of Fe(II)-based metallo-supramolecular polymer (polyFe) as a cathodically coloring EC layer, a poly(methyl methacrylate)-based solid-state electrolyte layer, and Prussian blue (PB) as an anodically coloring EC layer between two indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass conducting substrates. Spray coating technique was used to make polyFe film on ITO-glass. Counter materials were investigated to improve the long-term durability and performance of solid state devices. The polyFe layer thickness was optimized at 240 ± 50 nm, resulting in better electrochromic performance of the fabricated device with transmittance change of ~54% and 95% cyclic stability after 1000 cycles with a short response time by applying voltages of +2.7 V and −1.3 V reversibly. Importantly, the thermal stability of the fabricated solid device was also explored, and we achieved maximum temperature stability at 100 °C with 50% retention of device properties in this study.

Abstract: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an essential role in cancer development. However, the contribution of the lncRNA LINC00997 to kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) has not been thoroughly elucidated to date. In this study, we examined the expression and biological effect of LINC00997 in KIRC development. We also investigated the potential mechanism underlying the observed effects. We found that LINC00997 is highly expressed in multiple carcinomas, being highest in stage IV KIRC in our RNA-Seq datasets. In addition, our data demonstrated that in KIRC patients, higher levels of LINC00997 are correlated with lower overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates. In 18 cases of KIRC, we found that LINC00997 expression was greater in cancer tissues and metastases than in normal tissues. These results revealed that S100A11 is positively associated with LINC00997 in KIRC, which is positively correlated with metastasis-associated molecules VIM, MMP2 and MMP7. Our in vitro wound healing assay and Transwell tests demonstrated that interfering with either LINC00997 or S100A11 expression reduced migration of 786-O cells by inhibiting VIM, MMP2 and MMP7 expression. Importantly, we verified LINC00997 and STAT3 binding by RIP and determined that both LINC00997 and STAT3 bind to the S100A11 promoter, as shown by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. In addition, inhibiting LINC00997 or STAT3 expression attenuated S100A11 levels. Consequently, the LINC00997-STAT3-S100A11 axis may promote the development of KIRC, and LINC00997 may represent a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for KIRC patients.

Abstract: Well-crystalline and stoichiometric M-phase vanadium dioxide (VO2 (M)) ultrafine nanoparticles are desired in fabricating high-efficient VO2-based flexible thermochromic films. In this study, a novel solvent annealing technique is developed to avoid growth and agglomeration of VO2 (M) nanoparticles in the post-annealing process. Oxygen-deficient VO2 (D) nanoparticles (~36 nm) are firstly prepared by a facial hydrothermal method. A double-layered reactor is designed to separate the surfactant-modified VO2 (D) nanoparticles physically from H2O2 which serves as the oxidant. The unique reactor enables the formation of a moderate oxygenation environment in the solvent annealing process, making the transformation of oxygen-deficient VO2 to VO2 (M) more controllable. The growth and agglomeration of VO2 nanoparticles are effectively suppressed due to the surface modification by polyvinyl pyrrolidone, liquid environment and low temperature. The obtained VO2 (M) nanoparticles have an average particle size of ~41 nm. The flexible film prepared with the VO2 (M) nanoparticles exhibit excellent thermochromic properties with ΔTsol reaching 18.03% and Tlum up to 58.33%. This amazing performance is attributed to the high quality of VO2 (M) nanoparticles and ultrafine particle size that makes the surface plasmon absorption take effect in the solar light region. This work demonstrates the proposed solvent annealing technique is an effective approach to prepare high-quality ultrafine VO2 (M) nanoparticles for achieving efficient thermochromic performance of the flexible smart windows.

Abstract: Solar selective absorber coatings (SSACs) have been one of promising strategies for conversing solar radiation into heat source. To enhance the solar absorption properties, various strategies have been developed to fabricate the SSACs, involving multilayer structure, texturing surface, metal nitrides and carbides, etc., whereas these often entailed sophisticated processes and expensive material costs. Therefore, developing the simple method to yield platforms with excellent optical properties is highly desired. Here, we showed a simple and effective method to boost the optical absorptivity, namely low vacuum pre-annealing process. The resulting absorptance of WOx/SiO2 SSACs is significantly raised from 0.91 to 0.93, and the emittance remains around 0.055 only after annealing at below 300 °C for 10 h. The optical absorptivity of the pre-annealing SSAC is on par with most of absorbers, and it still remained excellent thermal stability in high-vacuum at 400 °C. This simple and efficient method could be a prospective strategy for booting the spectral absorption in the design of the desirable SSACs.

Abstract: The development of cost-effective and reliable high temperature phase change materials (HTPCMs) for solar thermal energy storage is an important step in the future application of concentrated solar thermal technologies. Inorganic eutectic salts relying on their advantages such as low cost, high melting temperatures and latent heats of fusion, are promising candidates for HTPCMs. However, both the thermal conductivity and thermal stability of the inorganic salts are relatively low. In addition, they have corrosion issues with containment materials at high temperatures. All of these issues have been problematic for their use in this application. A potential solution to these issues is the development of HTPCM composites, where high temperature molten salts as PCMs are encapsulated by supporting materials to achieve improved corrosion resistance with containment materials and enhanced thermal conductivity and thermal stability. This paper reviews current trends and recent developments in the preparation and classification of high temperature (>300 °C) PCM composites. The effect of developed HTPCM composites on their melting point, latent heat of fusion, thermal stability and heat transfer performance are also discussed in the context of this review.

Abstract: In pondering of new promising transparent conductors to replace the cost rising indium tin oxide (ITO), Cu nanowire (CuNW) films have been widely concerned, but both the adhesion and thermostability of CuNWs are very poor. In this paper, highly reliable copper nanowire transparent films on flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates, with synchronously enhanced adhesion, improved thermostability and reduced resistivity, are prepared via electroplating welding at room temperature. The sheet resistance of the flexible welded CuNW films reduces from ~200 to ~30 Ω/sq at the transmittance of ~83%. Meanwhile, the sheet resistance does not show significant change after bending and taping test, suggesting a good adhesion of welded CuNW films to the PET substrate. Moreover, the flexible welded CuNW films show good stability to resist long-term storage and high temperature (150 °C). The thermal performance of the flexible welded CuNW films as visible transparent heaters via Joule heating is also assessed. Rapid response times (~30 s) at a low bias voltage (5.5 V) and good thermal resistance characteristics are found using measured thermal imaging data and thermochromic paint printed on top of the transparent heater. This simple, low-cost, and scalable CuNW electroplating welding technique provides an innovative approach for the preparation of next-generation flexible transparent electrodes for future optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: Interactions between stainless steel 316L and eutectic Li2CO3 + K2CO3 + Na2CO3 at 450 °C were investigated for thermal energy storage. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Electron Back-Scatter Diffraction (EBSD), Scanning Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (SKPFM), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), neutron diffraction pattern, material loss, micro-hardness, polarization and impedance measurements were used to compare the alloy's response in unrolled (0%) condition versus 20% and 30% cold-rolled conditions. Cold-rolling increased the number of grains, grain boundaries and density of dislocations. Initially, faster corrosion accompanied by more areas of localized attack was confirmed by Volta potential measurements. However, recovery and the formation of a surface film were found to decelerate corrosion for longer times. Cold-rolling-induced dislocations were found to facilitate carbon diffusion and subsequently carburize the material leading to increased corrosion resistance. Consequently, the overall long-time corrosion rate was not noticeably affected by cold-rolling.

Abstract: Non-traditional photovoltaic (PV) modules, such as solar shingles, facades and skins, are expected to increase in market share as the solar industry matures and moves to fill building integrated photovoltaics niches. The advent of building integration and the application of photovoltaics to multiple surfaces come with fabrication challenges and inherent geometrical, optical and thermal constraints. In this paper, we investigate the curved lamination process and the integration of a dichroic polymeric film within the laminate for the particular case of a large-scale optical collector called a ”PVMirror”. PVMirror is a concentrating solar power (CSP)/PV hybrid design that combines the high efficiency of PV and storage capability of CSP using a dichroic film. The film does not degrade upon lamination and exhibits good adhesion to encapsulants. Multiple lamination approaches, such as tuning the thickness of the encapsulant, are shown to significantly reduce the impact of the lamination process on the shape error of PVMirror modules, which could also be applied to the fabrication of other non-traditional PV modules.

Abstract: This work comprises a systematic experimental investigation of the effect of gel electrolytes in the properties of partly covered photoelectrochromic devices. A series of gel electrolytes was fabricated with different concentrations of poly(methyl methacrylate), PMMA, (Mw 120.000), ranging from 0% w/w to 45% w/w, dissolved in acetonitrile with 0.5 M lithium iodide, 0.005 M iodine and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine. The ionic conductivity of the electrolytes was in the order of 10−5 S/cm, decreasing with increasing PMMA concentration. These electrolytes were incorporated in partly covered photoelectrochromic devices. It was found that with increasing PMMA concentration, the power conversion efficiency of the incorporated solar cells decreases (from 1.7% to 0.5%), mostly due to the reduction of the short-circuit current. Regarding coloration kinetics, the photocoloration efficiency, PhCE of the devices was nearly constant up to 35% w/w concentration of PMMA, decreasing with further increase in the PMMA concentration. Of the electrolytes tested, that with 35% w/w concentration of PMMA was favored as it leads to devices with satisfactory electrical and optical characteristics. The long-term stability of devices with the aforementioned electrolyte was tested. A gradual decrease of the coloration depth with storage time was observed, due to losses at the WO3/electrolyte interface. A 35 nm thin ZnS barrier on top of WO3 suppressed these losses, leading to a stabilized contrast ratio of 2.1:1, 137 days post fabrication. Devices exposed to insolation in open-circuit and in short-circuit conditions remained operational for more than 200 days, without the stability problems related to liquid electrolytes.

Abstract: TNF receptor proteins were primarily recognized as adaptor proteins that ligate with the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factor (TNFR) family to execute various signaling pathways. However, recent studies showed that they act as a signal-transducing molecules and are reported to have a functional role as a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor family member. Seven members of this family have been identified to date. Among TNF receptor family, TRAF7 does not share a common TRAF domain homology. The tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor (TRAF) domain comprises of about 230 amino acid motif at the C-terminal region that has the capability to bind TNFR and execute different downstream signaling pathways. Moreover, N-terminal RING and ZINC finger constituted by the tumor necrosis factor associated protein 2 and tumor necrosis factor associated protein 6 are critical and execute various downstream signaling events. TRAF proteins have emerged as critical regulators that provide the cellular response to stress and lead to cell death. Nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-KB) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) pathways are activated through tumor necrosis factor associated protein 2, tumor necrosis factor associated protein 5 and tumor necrosis factor associated protein 6 members. TRAF proteins in pathogenesis were observed from their abnormal expression in diseased tissue and in normal tissue, suggesting its important role in physiological processes. Recently, unique specificity of TRAF4 for glycoprotein Ibβ (GPIbβ) and glycoprotein VI (GPVI) in human platelets has been reported. The multifunctional effects of TRAIP (TNF) interacting protein in many cellular signaling pathways emerged as very important signaling molecule. Furthermore, the new insights into the structure of TRAF members along with new studies involved in health and disease prompted to explore their role particularly the TNF receptor associated proteins with novel inhibitor protein TRAIP (TNF) interacting protein and human diseases associated with it. As such, this review emphasis on tumor necrosis factor receptor associated proteins, present their current understanding with novel inhibitor protein TRAIP (TNF) interacting protein.

Abstract: Ternary carbonate (K2CO3–Li2CO3–Na2CO3, 4:4:2 mass ratio) can be used as a high-temperature heat transfer and thermal storage medium in concentrated solar power systems. Ternary carbonate nanofluids with 1.0 wt% SiO2 nanoparticles were prepared by mechanical mixing at high temperatures in order to enhance the specific heat capacity and the thermal conductivity. The effects of stirring rate (500 rpm, 750 rpm, and 1000 rpm) and stirring time (15 min, 30 min, and 60 min) on the thermal properties of the as-prepared nanofluids were analyzed. The results showed that the dispersion homogeneity of the nanoparticles in the nanofluids varied with the stirring rate and the mixing time, thereby affecting the formation of special nanostructures. The maximum enhancements in specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity at a temperature of 540 °C, stirring rate of 750 rpm and stirring time of 30 min were 38.5% and 50%, respectively. The specific heat capacity of the optimal nanofluids had no significant deterioration after the thermostatic (at 600 °C for 150 h) and thermal shock (50 cycles) experiments were conducted.

Abstract: Thermal stress of ceramics and high temperature materials have gained much attentions in the recent years due to their involving and increasing interest in highly advanced and severe applications. However, ceramic materials experience a high degree of brittleness and sensitivity to mechanical damage under thermal and mechanical loadings. This in turn promote the generation of thermal stresses of high magnitude. Catastrophic thermal stress failure of ceramic materials affects mainly on their successful implementation in high temperature and energy applications. Concept of thermal stress, its causes, consequences and ways to prevent its distressing failure should be inclusively studied and introduced. Moreover, due to the increased importance of solar radiation and its great role in solving the global energy deficiency problem, much efforts and studies should be exerted in overcoming the thermal stress generated among its components. So that, this article will handle several aspects concerning the thermal stress of high temperature ceramic materials. Besides, its causes and different ways to enhance thermal stress durability and resistance will be included. In addition, for the first time we will discuss the direct relationship between the thermal stress, thermoelectricity and solar energy absorption. Finally, inclusive studies on thermal stress of laminated and multilayer composites will be covered and investigated.

Abstract: Translin is a multifunctional DNA/RNA binding protein involved in DNA repair and RNA metabolism. It has two basic regions and involvement of some residues in these regions in nucleic acid binding is established experimentally. Here we report the functional role of four residues of basic region II, Y85, R86, H88, R92 and one residue of C terminal region, K193 in nucleic acid binding using substitution mutant variants. CD analysis of the mutant proteins showed that secondary structure was maintained in all the mutant proteins in comparison to wild type protein. Octameric state was maintained in all the mutants of basic region as evidenced by TEM, DLS, native PAGE and gel filtration analyses. However, K193G mutation completely abolished the octameric state of Translin protein and consequently its ability to bind ssDNA/ssRNA. The mutants of the basic region II exhibited a differential effect on nucleic acid binding, with R86A and R92G as most deleterious. Interestingly, H88A mutant showed higher nucleic acid binding affinity in comparison to the wild type Translin. An in silico analysis of the mutant variant sequences predicted all the mutations to be destabilizing, causing increase in flexibility and also leading to disruption of local interactions. The differential effect of mutations on DNA/RNA binding where octameric state is maintained could be attributed to these predicted disturbances.

Abstract: Background/aims
Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a major catechin found in green tea, plays an important anti-tumor role and is involved in various other biological processes, such as, neuroprotection by prevention of aggregation of misfolded proteins generated because of genetic defects. Surfactant protein A2 mutations (G231V and F198S) have been identified to be associated with pulmonary fibrosis and lung cancer, and these mutations cause protein aggregation, instability as well as secretion deficiency. The present study focused on investigating the inhibitory effects of EGCG on aggregation of mutant SP-A2 and elucidating the potential mechanisms underlying this action.
Methods
Wild-type and mutant SP-A2 were transiently expressed in CHO-K1 cells. The aggregated and soluble proteins were separated into NP-40-insoluble and NP-40-soluble fractions. Protein stability was validated by chymotrypsin limited proteolysis assay. Western blot and RT-PCR were used to determine the protein and mRNA expression level, respectively.
Results
Mutant SP-A2 alone or wild-type SP-A2 co-expressed with G231V formed NP-40-insoluble aggregates in CHO-K1 cells. EGCG significantly suppressed this aggregation and alleviated mutant SP-A2 accumulation in the ER. When combined with 4-PBA, EGCG treatment completely blocked mutant SP-A2 aggregate formation. Though secretion of mutant protein was not affected, EGCG facilitated protein instability in both wild-type and mutant protein. Importantly, MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, reversed EGCG-induced aggregate reduction.
Conclusions
EGCG inhibits aggregation of misfolded SP-A2 via induction of protein instability and activation of proteasomal pathway for aggregate degradation.

Abstract: A low concentrator photovoltaic is presented and the optical losses within a double glazed window assembly are described. The use of plastic instead of glass is analyzed for its reduced weight and hence greater power to weight ratios. Although the transmittance of glass is higher, the power to weight ratio of the plastic devices was almost double that of the glass counterparts and even higher than the original non concentrating silicon cell. The plastic Topas material was found to be the best performing material overall. Crystal Clear, a plastic resin, had a higher average transmittance but had a lower optical efficiency due to the cold cast manufacturing process in comparison to injection moulding of the other materials. This proves the importance of considering both the materials and their associated manufacturing quality. External quantum efficiencies, optical properties, silicon cell temperatures and performance is analyzed for concentrating photovoltaic devices made of varying optical materials. The measurement methods for optical analysis are given in an attempt to separate the optical losses experimentally. The Silicon cells were found to gain higher temperatures due to the insulating plastic optics in comparison to glass but these effects are eliminated during vertical window orientation where instead the encapsulate dominates the insulation of the cell. The results presented here prove plastic optics to be a worthwhile alternative to glass for use in low concentration photovoltaic systems and have the significant effect of reversing the weight disadvantage concentrator photovoltaic technology has compared to standard flat plate solar panels.

Abstract: With growing interest in the use of solar thermal applications to produce renewable and sustainable energy, coupled with the remarkable progress being made in nanotechnology, many innovative solutions have been proposed to improve the performance of solar energy harvesting technologies. Plasmonic nanofluids based on noble metallic nanoparticles are promising media for direct absorption solar collectors, which exploit localized surface plasmon resonance to enhance absorptivity within the solar spectrum. Plasmonic nanofluids can be used to control spectral absorption and scattering efficiencies by tailoring the morphologies of plasmonic nanoparticles. The absorption characteristics can be tuned to match the incident solar radiation, which boosts energy conversion efficiency, even at very low concentrations of nanoparticles. This reduces the collector's pumping power. The spectral absorption characteristics can also be exploited in photovoltaic/thermal systems by increasing the nanofluid transmissivity only in the photovoltaic working bands. This paper presents a comprehensive review of plasmonic nanofluids for solar thermal applications, including the design and development methods of new plasmonic materials. Understanding solar simulator concepts is also crucial for verifying and validating the use of spectral selective plasmonic materials in volumetric absorption solar collectors under normal or high flux irradiance. The optical characteristics of plasmonic nanofluids are reviewed along with the latest developments in conventional and novel materials for various solar thermal applications.

Abstract: The relevance of RNA processing has been increasingly recognized in a variety of diseases. We previously identified serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1) as an oncodriver in glioma via splicing control. However, its splicing-independent roles and mechanisms are poorly defined in glioma. In this study, by integrating the data mining of SRSF1-co-expressed genes, SRSF1-affected genes and experimental studies, we demonstrated that SRSF1 was the most highly expressed SRSF in the 9 tumor types tested, and it was a crucial cell cycle regulator in glioma. Importantly, we identified nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript1 (NEAT1), an upregulated long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) in glioma, as a target of SRSF1. Endogenous NEAT1 inhibition resembled the effect of SRSF1 knockdown on glioma cell proliferation by retarding cell cycle. Mechanistically, we proved that SRSF1 bound to NEAT1 and facilitated its RNA stability. The positive correlation between SRSF1 and NEAT1 levels in cancers further supported the positive regulation of NEAT1 by SRSF1. Collectively, our results provide novel insights on the splicing-independent mechanisms of SRSF1 in glioma, and confirm that NEAT1, whose stability maintained by SRSF1, implicates gliomagenesis by regulating cell cycle. Both SRSF1 and NEAT1 may serve as promising targets for antineoplastic therapies.

Abstract: This paper describes the impact of phosphorus dopant concentrations in n-type passivated contact structures. Free carrier absorption (FCA) of the phosphorus doped poly-Si layers was studied by using different phosphorus dopant concentrations, with a range of from 9 × 1019 to 2.3 × 1020 cm−3, and different poly-Si layer thicknesses, with a range of from 30 to 200 nm. In the worst case, the effect of FCA reduce the short circuit current density by 0.89 mA/cm2. The impacts of tunnel SiO2 thicknesses, poly-Si thicknesses and diffusion temperatures on the performances of the poly-Si passivated contacts were studied. Phosphorus concentrations induced silicon surface field passivation play an important role in passivated contact structure. On the planar n-type mono crystalline-silicon substrates, excellent J0 value of 6.5 fA/cm2 was achieved by optimizing phosphorus doping in poly-Si films and silicon substrate. Different poly-Si thickness and diffusion temperature were studied simultaneously to optimize the phosphorous dopants in the poly-Si passivated contacts for the specified poly-Si thickness. N-type silicon solar cell have been fabricated by using the optimized poly-Si passivated contacts, as addressed above. Average efficiency of 22.52%, and best cell efficiency of 23.04% were demonstrated.

Abstract: Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) has gained significant attention as a solar cell absorber material owing to its great long-time application potential. In this study, the precursors deposited by single quaternary target sputtering were annealed in different S/S + Se ratios atmosphere and CZTSSe solar cells were prepared. The mechanism of the S/Se replacement process and its effect on the composition, morphology, bandgap, and performance of the CZTSSe solar cells were systematically investigated. It was found that a decrease in the Se content in the annealing atmosphere showed an effect on the growth and properties of the thin films similar to that shown by an increase in the S/(S + Se) ratio. However, this effect was much milder than that of the increase in the S/(S + Se) ratio. The S/(S + Se) ratio of the CZTSSe thin films could be controlled by varying their S and Se contents in the annealing atmosphere and then adjusting their bandgaps. An increase in the bandgap improved the open circuit voltage and efficiency of the resulting solar cells. The cell annealed with the S:Se molar ratio of 1:3 showed an efficiency of 8.41% without anti-reflection coating.

Abstract: The integration of versatile properties, like hydrophobic, contamination-resistant, anti-icing and high-reflective, is highly desirable for the next-generation cool material. Herein, such kind of multifunctional cool material is realized by simply mixing acrylonitrile-styrene-acrylate (ASA) resin with fluorine-modified titanium dioxide (TiO2). The fluoro-organic chains perform high-efficient influence on the surface wettability, which further promotes the desired features. Owing to the presence of air layer and decreased water contact area, the as-prepared cool material performs improved freezing delay time up to 825 s and excellent contamination-resistant feature even after immersion in dyes for five days. Simultaneously, the cool material displays higher near-infrared (NIR) reflectance up to 54.2%, which induces great cooling effect of about 7 °C lower than that of polymer matrix. The successful combination of several properties offers a scalable technology for next-generation cool material with desired multifunctional features.

Abstract: In recent years, a strong growth in power conversion efficiency of all-polymer solar cells (up to 11.0%) has been realized through extensive material and device research. For practical application, high intrinsic thermal stability of the photoactive layer is a crucial requirement for long lifetimes. In this study, two new vinyl-functionalized monomers (TPD-V, NDI-V) were synthesized as the third monomer to produce two new series of cross-linkable benzodithiophene (BDT)-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD)-based polymer donors and naphthalenediimide (NDI)-based polymer acceptors by random copolymerization. By synthetically tuning the molar content of vinyl units, the crosslinked properties of the polymers were explored. It is found that these crosslinkable polymers with small molar content of vinyl unit can be mostly crosslinked upon long-term heating. Meanwhile, by employing crosslinking of PA/PD blend, all-PSCs were fabricated and the thermal-stability were studied. As a result, the all-PSCs based both crosslinkable polymer donor PBDT-TPD-8 and acceptor PNDI-T-5 retained 86% of its highest PCE (106% of its initial PCE) without obvious burn-in efficiency loss under 24 h of continuous accelerated heating (150 °C), while the reference devices based non-crosslinkable PBDT-TPD-0/PNDI-T-0 only retained 40% of its highest PCE (51% of its initial PCE). The results demonstrate photoactive layer crosslinking can stabilize morphology under long term thermal stress leading to excellent thermal-stability of the devices.

Abstract: Zinc oxide (ZnO) thin films grown on glass substrates are prepared by means of the Ion Layer Gas Reaction process. The XRD pattern revealed that the ZnO lattice parameters decrease continuously, with the increasing of the film thickness, indicating a continuous variation in the compressive strain. The influence of the thickness on the optical, morphological and structural properties of deposited ZnO thin films was investigated. The UV–Vis absorption spectra of deposited thin films were shown to exhibit a blue-shift, resulting in an increase in the optical band gap from 3.13 eV to 3.24 eV. Structural parameters such as crystallite size, lattice parameters, Zn–O bond length, and residual stress have been determined, and the compressive strain (tensile stress) is found to increase with the increasing of spray time and in turn deposited thin film thickness. The PL spectra of deposited ZnO films, show stronger PL intensity with increasing deposited thin film thickness, which confirm the influence of deposited film thickness on the recombination process of charge carriers and thus on its optical properties. These results, were confirmed by the photo-electrochemical experiments. In addition, a wettability alteration and shift from hydrophobic to hydrophilic surface is observed under UV light exposure, which shows that structural defects and surface morphology of deposited thin films were also demonstrated to have a direct impact on deposited films’ optical properties. Furthermore, to further confirm these experimental optical results, theoretical first principle calculations were conducted. In addition, a wettability alteration and shift from hydrophobic to hydrophilic surface is observed under UV light exposure.

Abstract: We investigate the versatility of anodically grown silicon dioxide (SiO2) films in the context of process durability and exceptional surface passivation for high efficiency (>23%) silicon solar cell architectures. We show that a room temperature anodic oxidation can achieve a thickness of ~70 nm within ~30 min, comparable to the growth rate of a thermal oxide at 1000 °C. We demonstrate that anodic SiO2 films can mask against wet chemical silicon etching and high temperature phosphorus diffusions, thereby permitting a low thermal budget method to form patterned structures. We investigate the saturation current density J0 of anodic SiO2/silicon nitride stacks on phosphorus diffused and undiffused silicon and show that a J0 of <10 fA cm−2 can be achieved in both cases. Finally, to showcase the anodic SiO2 films on a device level, we employed the anodic SiO2/silicon nitride stack to passivate the rear surface of an interdigitated back contact solar cell, achieving an efficiency of 23.8%.

Abstract: High temperature passivating contacts for c-Si based solar cells are intensively studied because of their potential in boosting solar cell efficiency while being compatible with industrial processes at high temperatures. In this work, the hydrogenation mechanism of fired passivating contacts (FPC) based on c-Si/SiOx/nc-SiCx(p) stacks was investigated. More specifically, the correlation between passivation and local re-distribution of hydrogen resulting from the application of different types of interfacial oxides (SiOx) and post-hydrogenation processes was analyzed. To do so, the applied processing sequence was interrupted at different stages in order to characterize the samples. To assess the hydrogen content, deuterium was introduced (alongside/instead of hydrogen) and secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) was used for depth profiling. Combining these results with lifetime measurements, the key role played by hydrogen in the passivation of defects at the c-Si/SiOx interface is discussed. The SIMS profiles show that hydrogen almost completely effuses out of the SiCx(p) during firing, but can be re-introduced by hydrogenation via forming gas anneal (FGA) or by release from a hydrogen containing layer such as SiNx:H. A pile-up of H at the c-Si/SiOx interface was observed and identified as a key element in the FPC's passivation mechanism. Moreover, the samples hydrogenated with SiNx:H exhibited higher H content compared to those treated by FGA, resulting in higher iVOC values. Further investigations revealed that the doping of the SiCx layer does not affect the amount of interfacial defects passivated by the hydrogenation process presented in this work. Eventually, an effect of the oxide's nature on passivation quality is evidenced. iVOC values of up to 706 mV and 720 mV were reached with FPC test structures using chemical and UV-O3 tunneling oxides, respectively, and up to 739 mV using a reference passivation sample featuring a ~25 nm thick thermal oxide.

Abstract: The solid-liquid phase behavior of three saturated aliphatic symmetrical sulfones (n-SO2-n) were assessed for potential use as Phase Change Materials (PCM) using TGA, DSC and XRD. The compounds were synthesized in high yield and purity via the simple solvent-free oxidation reaction of the fatty sulfides. The sulfones demonstrated properties suitable for medium temperature thermal energy storage applications. TGA measurements confirmed that the sulfones commences weight loss with onset temperatures up to 283 °C. The crystal structure and the thermal transition parameters of the sulfones were not significantly affected by cooling rate. 18-SO2-18 and 12-SO2-12 crystallized in the thermodynamically stable β-form and 10-SO2-10 crystallized in the γ-form, and all adopted single-molecular layer stacking configurations along the plane normal. DSC indicated that these compounds can rapidly store and release large amounts of thermal energy (>200 J/g) as latent heat between 89-109 °C with minimal supercooling. The sulfones presented higher melting temperatures compared to analogous monofunctional lipid-based counterparts such as fatty acids, fatty alcohols, ethers, monoesters, diesters, monoamides and alkanes attributed to the added strong sulfonyl-sulfonyl attraction between the highly polar sulfonyl groups. Importantly, this work shows that linear saturated lipid-based sulfones can extend the available range of the current available organic, lipid-based PCMs.

Abstract: Melanoma is the most aggressive type of cutaneous tumors due to its metastatic potential and high mortality. Increased levels of reactive oxygen species, including superoxide anion (O2−), and the consequent installation of a pro-oxidant environment are associated with melanoma development. The enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS), responsible for the production of nitric oxide (NO), when uncoupled is as a source of O2−, for example by the absence of its cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). Western blot analysis showed increased expression of endothelial and inducible NOS in human melanoma cells, altering the stoichiometry between NOS levels and BH4 concentration and together with decreased BH4:BH2 ratio are contributing to NOS uncoupling. The treatment of melanoma cells with exogenous BH4 increased NO concentration and decreased O2− levels, leading to NOS coupling, which in turn reduced cell viability, cell proliferation and the ability of melanoma cells to form melanoma spheroids. Moreover, BH4 level restoration rendered melanoma cells more sensitive to apoptosis, demonstrating the role of dysfunctional NOS in melanoma genesis.

Abstract: Lithography-free interdigitated back-contact silicon heterojunction (IBC-SHJ) solar cells with dopant-free metal oxides (TiO2 and MoOx) as the carriers selective transport layers were investigated. Spin-coating and hot-wire reactive-sublimation deposition together with low cost mask technology were used to fabricate the solar cells. Insertion of a SiOx layer with the thickness of about 2.4 nm between the intrinsic amorphous Si (a-Si:H(i)) passivation layer and the spin-coated TiO2 layer greatly improves the solar cell performance due to the enhanced field-effect passivation of the a-Si:H(i)/SiOx/TiO2 layer stack. Efficiency up to 20.24% was achieved on the lithography-free and dopant-free IBC-SHJ devices with a-Si:H(i)/SiOx/TiO2 layer stack as the electron selective transport layer, a-Si:H(i)/MoOx as the hole selective transport layer, and WOx as the antireflection layer. The novel IBC-SHJ solar cells show significant advantages in simplification of the technology and process compared with the IBC-SHJ devices whose back surface pattering and carrier selective layers relied on photolithography and plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD).

Abstract: Chromogenic materials are widely used in the field of smart window with controllable throughput of solar energy and visible light. However, single modulation mode is often difficult to meet practical applications. Herein, we construct a novel multilayer device by effectively integrating thermochromic (TC) and electrochromic (EC) materials to selectively modulate visible and near-infrared (NIR) transmittance. The all-solid-state VO2-based multilayer device consists of VO2/LiTaO3/WO3 sandwich structure, with transparent conductor FTO and ITO as bottom electrode and top electrode, respectively. Therefore, this five-layer structure realized four reversible optical states, that is, TC layer passively responds to environmental temperature, while EC layer actively responds to external voltage simultaneously. Moreover, reversible migration of Li+ within the lattice of VO2 is achieved with a low voltage (just 3 V bias), which has an obvious effect (over 10 °C) on its phase change temperature (PCT). Finally, this novel dual-response VO2-based multilayer device provide a new strategy for VO2-based smart window applications.

Abstract: Solar cells and modules are usually optimized separately under standard test conditions (STC). However, the actual performance under field exposure depends on module design, installation and environmental conditions. This work therefore presents a methodology to predict the annual yield of crystalline silicon solar modules for varying module configurations and environments using a time step simulation approach. We define and quantify 12 effects that affect the annual module performance, starting with solar cells in air under STC to a complete module under realistic conditions. We consider the interaction of optical, thermal and electrical effects in the module and combine it with an angular, spectral and time resolved light source. The model enables understanding the impact of the module environment, such as regions with high wind speeds or high diffuse light, on the annual output of a particular module type. We validate our model with measured power and temperature data for crystalline silicon heterojunction solar cell modules and find an agreement of the annual yield within 0.7%. We quantify the annual gains and losses for this module and identify that major losses are caused by elevated operating temperatures (2.3%) and reflection losses at the front glass (2.6%). Critically, the coupling gains at the cell surface increase significantly by 1.5% when considering angular light irradiance compared to normal incidence. Finally, we apply our Cell-to-Module-Yield method to a 72-cell mono-crystalline PERC module, where the main annual yield losses are caused by reflection at the front glass and ohmic losses in the connector ribbons.

Abstract: Sb2Se3 is a promising candidate for environment-friendly and cost-efficiently thin film photovoltaics thanks to its material advantages and superior optoelectronic properties. However, it has intrinsically low electrical conductivity, which leads to unsatisfactory device performance and limited scope of applications. Herein, we demonstrated an effective strategy of electrical conductivity-induced Sb2Se3-based photovoltaic performance improvement. Three Sb2Se3-based targets with chemical composition of Sb2Se3, Sb2Se3.3 and Sb2(Se0.9I0.1)3 have been firstly prepared by using high-temperature melting technique. Then the high-quality thin films can be obtained through an effective Radio Frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering process. A novel Sb2Se3 quasi-homojunction thin film solar cell was fabricated for the first time and the highest power conversion efficiency reaches already a highly interesting 2.65%. The combined features of unique quasi-homojunction device structure and advantageous full-vacuum preparation process further demonstrated its attractive potential for thin film photovoltaic applications.

Abstract: Organic-inorganic halide perovskite materials have emerged as highly efficient solar absorbers produced under low-cost processing conditions. However, due to the hygroscopic nature of halide perovskite materials, moisture significantly affects the stability, lifetime and performance of the device. In this work, we combine thiocyanate-doped pseudohalide perovskite with additive solvents to achieve compact films showing high-quality crystal grains with improved longevity of the perovskite films using a simple two-step spin-coating method under ambient conditions. Indeed, we confirm that humidity has a profound impact on the crystal quality. Perovskite films with grain sizes as large as 4 μm are produced in high humidity conditions, using methylammonium iodide precursor solution mixed with deionized water and ethanol. Power conversion efficiencies up-to 9.4% have been achieved for optimized planar device architectures fabricated above 60% relative humidity. Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and current-voltage characteristics for devices stored in ambient conditions for more than 480 h show that the films are quite stable with only a 12% decay of their initial power conversion efficiency.

Abstract: Hot corrosion is profoundly detrimental to construction elements in Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants affecting their lifetime, running costs and safety. In this work we have studied the anticorrosion effect of TiO2 nanoparticles additives on carbon steel using XRD, XPS with depth profiling, EDX and FIB/SEM techniques. The results revealed that the addition of 1 wt% of TiO2 nanoparticles to molten binary nitrate salt reduces the corrosion rate of carbon steel more than twice and stabilizes the corrosion scale at 390 °C. The anticorrosion effect of TiO2 nanoadditive was attributed to the formation of iron-titanium mixed oxide on the carbon steel surface. It was confirmed by XRD and TGA techniques that addition of TiO2 nanoparticles does not alter the stability of the salt. In view of presented results, the feasibility of molten salts based nanofluids in the CSPs can be reconsidered in terms of improved compatibility with construction materials.

Abstract: Perovskite solar cells have great development prospects due to their high photoelectric conversion efficiency and low cost. However, perovskite materials are easy to decompose under water conditions, directly reducing the efficiency of perovskite solar cells. Cluster model was applied to study the mechanism of the effect of water on perovskite materials. Density functional theory has carried on to theoretically calculate the structure and energy of perovskite cluster after adsorbing water molecules. The usage of independent gradient model (IGM) showed the interaction region between perovskite cluster and water molecules. The bonding types between atoms were qualitatively obtained by analysis of atoms in molecules (AIM), and the microscopic mechanism of interaction between perovskite cluster and water molecules is revealed. The results show that when the number of the interactions between perovskite cluster and water molecules increases, the stability of the adsorption configuration will enhance. The interaction type between perovskite cluster and water molecules belongs to hydrogen bond and it also affects the stability of the perovskite cluster. This result can contribute to understand the stability of perovskite clusters by studying water adsorption on (CH3NH3)4SnI6 and to furtherly improve the practicability of perovskite solar cells.

Abstract: A possible research path to increase the photo-generated current in silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells is to replace doped layers on the front-side of the cell, which result in significant parasitic light absorption losses. MoOx is one candidate to replace the p-doped a-Si:H layer in such devices, although it is claimed to be relatively unstable to thermal treatments. We found that a MoOx film with a thickness of 6 nm is sufficient to achieve a JSC of 36 mA/cm2, which is 0.5 mA/cm2 on average higher than that of our classical SHJ reference cell. We also established a contact sintering condition for printed Ag at 160 °C after MoOx deposition, without degrading the cell performance. The champion MoOx-contacted cell yielded VOC of 724 mV and FF of 74.1%, resulting in an efficiency of 19.3%. From a detailed analysis of the interfaces of the hole contact, an interfacial a-SiOx of 1.6–2 nm was observed between a-Si:H and MoOx irrespective of the MoOx thickness (6–10 nm) before and after contact sinter annealing at 160 °C. We postulate that this a-SiOx layer acts as an interfacial dipole layer and also increases the contact resistivity at this contact. The intrinsic stability of the optimised MoOx-contacted cell is studied using a one-cell mini-module under standard damp-heat testing (85 °C/85% humidity/1000 h). More than 97 %rel of the original efficiency is maintained after 1010 h of testing, which is comparable to the behavior observed in a classical SHJ reference one-cell mini-module that was similarly tested.

Abstract: Factor VII (FVII) is a key serine protease in blood coagulation. N-glycosylation in FVII has been shown to be critical for protein secretion. To date, however, the underlying biochemical mechanism remains unclear. Recently, we found that N-glycans in the transmembrane serine protease corin are critical for calnexin-assisted protein folding and extracellular expression. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that N-glycans in the FVII protease domain mediate calnexin-assisted protein folding and that naturally occurring F7 mutations abolishing N-glycosylation impair FVII secretion. We expressed human FVII wild-type (WT) and mutant proteins lacking one or both N-glycosylation sites in HEK293 and HepG2 cells in the presence or absence of a glucosidase inhibitor. FVII expression, secretion and binding to endoplasmic reticulum chaperones were examined by immune staining, co-immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, and ELISA. We found that N-glycosylation at N360 in the protease domain, but not N183 in the pro-peptide domain, of human FVII is required for protein secretion. Elimination of N-glycosylation at N360 impaired calnexin-assisted FVII folding and secretion. Similar results were observed in WT FVII when N-glycan-calnexin interaction was blocked by glucosidase inhibition. Naturally occurring F7 mutations abolishing N-glycosylation at N360 reduced FVII secretion in HEK293 and HepG2 cells. These results indicate that N-glycans in the FVII protease domain mediate calnexin-assisted protein folding and subsequent extracellular expression. Naturally occurring F7 mutations abolishing N-glycosylation in FVII may impair this mechanism, thereby reducing FVII levels in patients.

Abstract: The aim of the present study is to investigate the molecular mechanisms of Cisplatin- induced placental toxicity and teratogenicity in rats and the ameliorating role of N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC). Cisplatin was administrated intraperitoneally at 5 mg/kg.b.wt as a single dose on the 12th day of gestation while NAC was administered orally throughout gestation either alone or in concomitant injection of Cisplatin at 200 mg/kg.b.wt. Cisplatin + NAC group showed reduction in the elevated morphological, visceral and skeletal abnormalities as well as the morphological and histopathological changes in placenta compared to Cisplatin - treated rats. Importantly, NAC attenuated Cisplatin-induced placental apoptosis through down-regulation of Fas and Caspase-3 genes expression. In conclusion, induction of placental apoptosis by overexpression of Fas and Caspase-3 genes gives a new insight into the mechanism of Cisplatin teratogenicity. The protective role of NAC, on the other hand, was characterized by attenuation of Fas and Caspase-3 genes- mediated apoptosis.

Abstract: For future mass production, it is the best choice to fabricate highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in the ambient air. Interface modification is widely reported as an effective method for boosting the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of PSCs. In our manuscript, CsBr as the interface modification material was introduced into the mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2) via two ways: doping into the mp-TiO2 layer and inserting between the mp-TiO2 and perovskite films. It was found that CsBr interface modification, especially by doping into the mp-TiO2 layer, can passivate the trap states originated from VO in mp-TiO2 leading to enhanced carrier transport properties, meliorate surface property of mp-TiO2 resulting in high-quality perovskite films, improve the carrier extraction and decrease the trap recombination in the interface. High-quality perovskite films, with increased grain size, reduced grain boundaries and pinholes, were obtained after CsBr modification, and further applied for the PSCs. The whole preparation process of the PSCs was finished in ambient air. The champion device with CsBr doped into the mp-TiO2 layer yielded a highest PCE of 17.33%, while the pristine device showed a PCE of 14.95%. Furthermore, the champion PSC with CsBr doped into the mp-TiO2 layer exhibited a much better stability, which could maintain over 80% of the original PCE after 1000h storing in ambient air without any encapsulation. This work presents an approach to develop air-processed efficient and stable PSCs by interface modification for future mass production.
