Abstract: Summary
Specific interactions between proteins and DNA are essential to many biological processes. Yet, it remains unclear how the diversification in DNA-binding specificity was brought about, and the mutational paths that led to changes in specificity are unknown. Using a pair of evolutionarily related DNA-binding proteins, each with a different DNA preference (ParB [Partitioning Protein B] and Noc [Nucleoid Occlusion Factor], which both play roles in bacterial chromosome maintenance), we show that specificity is encoded by a set of four residues at the protein-DNA interface. Combining X-ray crystallography and deep mutational scanning of the interface, we suggest that permissive mutations must be introduced before specificity-switching mutations to reprogram specificity and that mutational paths to new specificity do not necessarily involve dual-specificity intermediates. Overall, our results provide insight into the possible evolutionary history of ParB and Noc and, in a broader context, might be useful for understanding the evolution of other classes of DNA-binding proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a molecular chaperone regulating the activity of diverse client proteins together with a plethora of different co-chaperones. Whether these functionally cooperate has remained enigmatic. We analyze all double mutants of 11 Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hsp90 co-chaperones in vivo concerning effects on cell physiology and the activation of specific client proteins. We find that client activation is supported by a genetic network with weak epistasis between most co-chaperones and a few modules with strong genetic interactions. These include an epistatic module regulating protein translation and dedicated epistatic networks for specific clients. For kinases, the bridging of Hsp70 and Hsp90 by Sti1/Hop is essential for activation, whereas for steroid hormone receptors, an epistatic module regulating their dwell time on Hsp90 is crucial, highlighting the specific needs of different clients. Thus, the Hsp90 system is characterized by plastic co-chaperone networks fine-tuning the conformational processing in a client-specific manner.

Abstract: Stem cell-based therapy has emerged as an attractive method for regenerating and repairing the lost heart organ. On other hand, poor survival and maintenance of the cells transferred into the damaged heart tissue are broadly accepted as serious barriers to enhance the efficacy of the regenerative therapy. For this reason, external factors, such as antioxidants are used as a favorite strategy by the investigators to improve the cell survival and retention properties. Therefore, the present study was conducted to investigate the In -vitro effect of L-carnitine (LC) on the telomere length and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene expression in the cardiac differentiated bone marrow resident CD117+ stem cells through Wnt3/β-catenin and ERK1/2 pathways. To do this, bone marrow resident CD117+ stem cells were enriched by the magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) method, and were differentiated to the cardiac cells in the absence (-LC) and presence of the LC (+LC). Also, characterization of the enriched c-kit+ cells was performed using the flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry. At the end of the treatment period, the cells were subjected to the real-time PCR technique along with western blotting assay for measurement of the telomere length and assessment of mRNA and protein, respectively. The results showed that 0.2 mM LC caused the elongation of the telomere length and increased the hTERT gene expression in the cardiac differentiated CD117+ stem cells. In addition, a significant increase was observed in the mRNA and protein expression of Wnt3, β-catenin and ERK1/2 as key components of these pathways. It can be concluded that the LC can increase the telomere length as an effective factor in increasing the cell survival and maintenance of the cardiac differentiated bone marrow resident CD117+ stem cells via Wnt3/β-catenin and ERK1/2 signaling pathway components.

Abstract: Calsequestrin is the major Ca2+ binding protein in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), serves as the main Ca2+ storage and buffering protein and is an important regulator of Ca2+ release channels in both skeletal and cardiac muscle. It is anchored at the junctional SR membrane through interactions with membrane proteins and undergoes reversible polymerization with increasing Ca2+ concentration. Calsequestrin provides high local Ca2+ at the junctional SR and communicates changes in luminal Ca2+ concentration to Ca2+ release channels, thus it is an essential component of excitation-contraction coupling. Recent studies reveal new insights on calsequestrin trafficking, Ca2+ binding, protein evolution, protein-protein interactions, stress responses and the molecular basis of related human muscle disease, including catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). Here we provide a comprehensive overview of calsequestrin, with recent advances in structure, diverse functions, phylogenetic analysis, and its role in muscle physiology, stress responses and human pathology.

Abstract: Summary
High-throughput imaging has led to an explosion of observations about cell-size homeostasis across the kingdoms of life. Among bacteria, “adder” behavior—in which a constant size increment appears to be added during each cell cycle—is ubiquitous, while various eukaryotes show other size-homeostasis behaviors. Since interactions between cell-cycle progression and growth ultimately determine such behaviors, we developed a general model of cell-cycle regulation. Our analyses reveal a range of scenarios that are plausible but fail to regulate cell size, indicating that mechanisms of cell-cycle regulation are stringently limited by size-control requirements, and possibly why certain cell-cycle features are strongly conserved. Cell-cycle features can play unintuitive roles in altering size-homeostasis behaviors: noisy regulator production can enhance adder behavior, while Whi5-like inhibitor dilutors respond sensitively to perturbations to G2/M control and noisy G1/S checkpoints. Our model thus provides holistic insights into the mechanistic implications of size-homeostasis experimental measurements.

Abstract: Summary
The transitions from developing to adult quiescent and activated neural stem cells (NSCs) are not well understood. Here, we use single-cell transcriptional profiling and lineage tracing to characterize these transitions in the murine forebrain. We show that the two forebrain NSC parental populations, embryonic cortex and ganglionic eminence radial precursors (RPs), are highly similar even though they make glutamatergic versus gabaergic neurons. Both RP populations progress linearly to transition from a highly active embryonic to a dormant adult stem cell state that still shares many similarities with embryonic RPs. When adult NSCs of either embryonic origin become reactivated to make gabaergic neurons, they acquire a developing ganglionic eminence RP-like identity. Thus, transitions from embryonic RPs to adult NSCs and back to neuronal progenitors do not involve fundamental changes in cell identity, but rather reflect conversions between activated and dormant NSC states that may be determined by the niche environment.

Abstract: Summary
Human pluripotent stem cells differentiated to insulin-secreting β cells (SC-β cells) in islet organoids could provide an unlimited cell source for diabetes cell replacement therapy. However, current SC-β cells generated in vitro are transcriptionally and functionally immature compared to native adult β cells. Here, we use single-cell transcriptomic profiling to catalog changes that occur in transplanted SC-β cells. We find that transplanted SC-β cells exhibit drastic transcriptional changes and mature to more closely resemble adult β cells. Insulin and IAPP protein secretions increase upon transplantation, along with expression of maturation genes lacking with differentiation in vitro, including INS, MAFA, CHGB, and G6PC2. Other differentiated cell types, such as SC-α and SC-enterochromaffin (SC-EC) cells, also exhibit large transcriptional changes. This study provides a comprehensive resource for understanding human islet cell maturation and provides important insights into maturation of SC-β cells and other SC-islet cell types to enable future differentiation strategy improvements.

Abstract: Summary
In vertebrates, epithelial permeability is regulated by the tight junction (TJ) formed by specialized adhesive membrane proteins, adaptor proteins, and the actin cytoskeleton. Despite the TJ’s critical physiological role, a molecular-level understanding of how TJ assembly sets the permeability of epithelial tissue is lacking. Here, we identify a 28-amino-acid sequence in the TJ adaptor protein ZO-1, which is responsible for actin binding, and show that this interaction is essential for TJ permeability. In contrast to the strong interactions at the adherens junction, we find that the affinity between ZO-1 and actin is surprisingly weak, and we propose a model based on kinetic trapping to explain how affinity could affect TJ assembly. Finally, by tuning the affinity of ZO-1 to actin, we demonstrate that epithelial monolayers can be engineered with a spectrum of permeabilities, which points to a promising target for treating transport disorders and improving drug delivery.

Abstract: Summary
Histone methyltransferase KMT2D harbors frequent loss-of-function somatic point mutations in several tumor types, including melanoma. Here, we identify KMT2D as a potent tumor suppressor in melanoma through an in vivo epigenome-focused pooled RNAi screen and confirm the finding by using a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) based on conditional and melanocyte-specific deletion of KMT2D. KMT2D-deficient tumors show substantial reprogramming of key metabolic pathways, including glycolysis. KMT2D deficiency aberrantly upregulates glycolysis enzymes, intermediate metabolites, and glucose consumption rates. Mechanistically, KMT2D loss causes genome-wide reduction of H3K4me1-marked active enhancer chromatin states. Enhancer loss and subsequent repression of IGFBP5 activates IGF1R-AKT to increase glycolysis in KMT2D-deficient cells. Pharmacological inhibition of glycolysis and insulin growth factor (IGF) signaling reduce proliferation and tumorigenesis preferentially in KMT2D-deficient cells. We conclude that KMT2D loss promotes tumorigenesis by facilitating an increased use of the glycolysis pathway for enhanced biomass needs via enhancer reprogramming, thus presenting an opportunity for therapeutic intervention through glycolysis or IGF pathway inhibitors.

Abstract: Summary
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a dominant genetic disorder manifesting, in part, as cognitive defects. Previous study indicated that neurofibromin (NF1 protein) interacts with valosin-containing protein (VCP)/P97 to control dendritic spine formation, but the mechanism is unknown. Here, using Nf1+/– mice and transgenic mice overexpressing wild-type Vcp/p97, we demonstrate that neurofibromin acts with VCP to control endoplasmic reticulum (ER) formation and consequent protein synthesis and regulates dendritic spine formation, thereby modulating contextual fear memory and social interaction. To validate the role of protein synthesis, we perform leucine supplementation in vitro and in vivo. Our results suggest that leucine can effectively enter the brain and increase protein synthesis and dendritic spine density of Nf1+/– neurons. Contextual memory and social behavior of Nf1+/– mice are also restored by leucine supplementation. Our study suggests that the “ER-protein synthesis” pathway downstream of neurofibromin and VCP is a critical regulator of dendritic spinogenesis and brain function.

Abstract: HslUV is a bacterial heat shock protein complex consisting of the AAA+ ATPase component HslU and the protease component HslV. HslV is a threonine (Thr) protease employing the N-terminal Thr residue in the mature protein as the catalytic residue. To date, HslUV from Gram-negative bacteria has been extensively studied. However, the mechanisms of action and activation of HslUV from Gram-positive bacteria, which have an additional N-terminal sequence before the catalytic Thr residue, remain to be revealed. In this study, we determined the crystal structures of HslV from the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus with and without HslU in the crystallization conditions. The structural comparison suggested that a structural transition to the symmetric form of HslV was triggered by ATP-bound HslU. More importantly, the additional N-terminal sequence was cleaved in the presence of HslU and ATP, exposing the Thr9 residue at the N-terminus and activating the ATP-dependent protease activity. Further biochemical studies demonstrated that the exposed N-terminal Thr residue is critical for catalysis with binding to the symmetric HslU hexamer. Since eukaryotic proteasomes have a similar additional N-terminal sequence, our results will improve our understanding of the common molecular mechanisms for the activation of proteasomes.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular metabolism governs the susceptibility of CD4 T cells to HIV-1 infection. Multiple early post-fusion steps of HIV-1 replication are restricted in resting peripheral blood CD4 T cells; however, molecular mechanisms that underlie metabolic control of these steps remain undefined. Here, we show that mTOR activity following T cell stimulatory signals overcomes metabolic restrictions in these cells by enabling the expansion of dNTPs to fuel HIV-1 reverse transcription (RT), as well as increasing acetyl-CoA to stabilize microtubules that transport RT products. We find that catalytic mTOR inhibition diminishes the expansion of pools of both of these metabolites by limiting glucose and glutamine utilization in several pathways, thereby suppressing HIV-1 infection. We demonstrate how mTOR-coordinated biosyntheses enable the early steps of HIV-1 replication, add metabolic mechanisms by which mTOR inhibitors block HIV-1, and identify some metabolic modules downstream of mTOR as druggable targets for HIV-1 inhibition.

Abstract: Summary
Mutant p53 (mutp53) loses its tumor suppressor properties but gains oncogenic functions of driving malignancy. However, it remains largely unknown how mutp53 drives cancer metastasis. Here, we show that wild-type p53 (WTp53) suppresses the secretion of heat shock protein 90-alpha (Hsp90α), whereas mutp53 enhances Hsp90α vesicular trafficking and exosome-mediated secretion. Long-term delivery of an antibody that blocks extracellular Hsp90α (eHsp90α) function extends the survival of p53−/− mice and attenuates the invasiveness of p53 mutant tumors. Furthermore, mass spectrometry and functional analysis identified a critical role for Rab coupling protein (RCP) in mutp53-induced Hsp90α secretion. RCP knockdown decreases eHsp90α levels and inhibits malignant progression. Notably, recombinant Hsp90α re-introduction markedly rescues the impaired migration and invasion abilities caused by RCP depletion. Taken together, these findings elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which mutp53 executes oncogenic activities via its downstream RCP-mediated Hsp90α secretion and a strategy to treat human cancers expressing mutp53 proteins.

Abstract: Summary
In animal embryos, the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) hands developmental control from maternal to zygotic gene products. We show that the maternal proteome represents more than half of the protein-coding capacity of Drosophila melanogaster’s genome, and that 2% of this proteome is rapidly degraded during the MZT. Cleared proteins include the post-transcriptional repressors Cup, Trailer hitch (TRAL), Maternal expression at 31B (ME31B), and Smaug (SMG). Although the ubiquitin-proteasome system is necessary for clearance of these repressors, distinct E3 ligase complexes target them: the C-terminal to Lis1 Homology (CTLH) complex targets Cup, TRAL, and ME31B for degradation early in the MZT and the Skp/Cullin/F-box-containing (SCF) complex targets SMG at the end of the MZT. Deleting the C-terminal 233 amino acids of SMG abrogates F-box protein interaction and confers immunity to degradation. Persistent SMG downregulates zygotic re-expression of mRNAs whose maternal contribution is degraded by SMG. Thus, clearance of SMG permits an orderly MZT.

Abstract: Summary
Odors are well known to elicit strong emotional and behavioral responses that become strengthened throughout learning, yet the specific cellular systems involved in odor learning and the direct influence of these on behavior are unclear. Here, we investigate the representation of odor-reward associations within two areas recipient of dense olfactory input, the posterior piriform cortex (pPCX) and the olfactory tubercle (OT), using electrophysiological recordings from mice engaged in reward-based learning. Neurons in both regions represent conditioned odors and do so with similar information content, yet the proportion of neurons recruited by conditioned rewarded odors and the magnitudes and durations of their responses are greater in the OT. Using fiber photometry, we find that OT D1-type dopamine-receptor-expressing neurons flexibly represent odors based on reward associations, and using optogenetics, we show that these neurons influence behavioral engagement. These findings contribute to a model whereby OT D1 neurons support odor-guided motivated behaviors.

Abstract: Background
We investigated uterine histopathological and ultrastructural changes in female dogs with pyometra induced by Escherichia coli (E. coli) inoculation using progesterone and/or estradiol.
Methods
Dogs were ovariectomized and classified into six groups: Groups 1–6 corresponding to estradiol treatment followed by progesterone supplementation, progesterone supplementation only, estradiol supplementation only, simultaneous treatment using estradiol and progesterone, similar to Group 1 but with a double dose, and control group, respectively.
Results
Pyometra was successfully induced in Groups 1, 2, 4, and 5, but not in Group 3. An uneven endometrial surface was observed, along with a purulent discharge, bleeding, inflammatory lesions, cystic endometrial hyperplasia (CEH) or cystic endometrial atrophy. Endometrial thickness percentage, uterine wall thickness, and the percentage of endometrial cyst area increased. Endometrial epithelial mushroom-like hyperplasia and the honeycomb-like structure exposed under the epithelium after flaky exfoliation were found, and the glandular epithelial villi became longer or shorter. Mitochondria expansion and increased lysosome were observed. Endoplasmic reticulum dilation and swelling and many inflammatory cells, especially plasma cell infiltration in the stroma, were found.
Conclusions
Endometrial histopathology and ultrastructural changes in affected dogs were accompanied by induction of pyometra, and they were affected by different hormonal patterns and E. coli.

Abstract: Summary
Macrophages play a central role in intestinal immunity, but inappropriate macrophage activation is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Here, we identify granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) as a critical regulator of intestinal macrophage activation in patients with IBD and mice with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. We find that GM-CSF drives the maturation and polarization of inflammatory intestinal macrophages, promoting anti-microbial functions while suppressing wound-healing transcriptional programs. Group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) are a major source of GM-CSF in intestinal inflammation, with a strong positive correlation observed between ILC or CSF2 transcripts and M1 macrophage signatures in IBD mucosal biopsies. Furthermore, GM-CSF-dependent macrophage polarization results in a positive feedback loop that augmented ILC3 activation and type 17 immunity. Together, our data reveal an important role for GM-CSF-mediated ILC-macrophage crosstalk in calibrating intestinal macrophage phenotype to enhance anti-bacterial responses, while inhibiting pro-repair functions associated with fibrosis and stricturing, with important clinical implications.

Whole-body regeneration relies on the re-establishment of body axes for patterning of new tissue. Wnt signaling is required to correctly regenerate tissues along the primary axis in many animals. However, the causal mechanisms that first launch Wnt signaling during regeneration are poorly characterized. We use the acoel worm Hofstenia miamia to identify processes that initiate Wnt signaling during posterior regeneration and find that the ligand wnt-3 is upregulated early in posterior-facing wounds. Functional studies reveal that wnt-3 is required to regenerate posterior tissues. wnt-3 is expressed in stem cells, it is needed for their proliferation, and its function is stem cell dependent. Chromatin accessibility data reveal that wnt-3 activation requires input from the general wound response. In addition, the expression of a different Wnt ligand, wnt-1, before amputation is required for wound-induced activation of wnt-3. Our study establishes a gene regulatory network for initiating Wnt signaling in posterior tissues in a bilaterian.

Abstract: Summary
Pyroptosis has emerged as a key mechanism by which inflammasomes promote host defense against microbial pathogens and sterile inflammation. Gasdermin D (GSDMD)-mediated cell lysis is a hallmark of pyroptosis, but our understanding of cell death signaling during pyroptosis is fragmented. Here, we show that independently of GSDMD-mediated plasma membrane permeabilization, inflammasome receptors engage caspase-1 and caspase-8, both of which redundantly promote activation of apoptotic executioner caspase-3 and caspase-7 in pyroptotic macrophages. Impaired GSDMD pore formation downstream of caspase-1 and caspase-8 activation suffices to unmask the apoptotic phenotype of pyroptotic macrophages. Combined inactivation of initiator caspase-1 and caspase-8, or executioner caspase-3 and caspase-7, is required to abolish inflammasome-induced DEVDase activity during pyroptosis and in apoptotic Gsdmd−/− cells. Collectively, these results unveil a robust apoptotic caspase network that is activated in parallel to GSDMD-mediated plasma membrane permeabilization and safeguards cell death induction in pyroptotic macrophages.

Abstract: Summary
High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths of women in the United States. Disease-associated mutations have been identified by the Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network. However, aside from mutations in TP53 or the RB1 pathway that are common in HGSOC, the contributions of mutation combinations are unclear. Here, we report CRISPR mutagenesis of 20 putative HGSOC driver genes to identify combinatorial disruptions of genes that transform either ovarian surface epithelium stem cells (OSE-SCs) or non-stem cells (OSE-NSs). Our results support the OSE-SC theory of HGSOC initiation and suggest that most commonly mutated genes in HGSOC have no effect on OSE-SC transformation initiation. Our results indicate that disruption of TP53 and PTEN, combined with RB1 disruption, constitutes a core set of mutations driving efficient transformation in vitro. The combined data may contribute to more accurate modeling of HGSOC development.

Abstract: Summary
Osteogenic suppressors such as Sclerostin not only regulate skeletal development and regeneration but also serve as anti-osteoporosis drug targets. However, very few druggable suppressors have been identified due to limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing osteogenesis. Here, we show that fibroblast activation protein (Fap), a serine protease inhibited by the bone growth factor Osteolectin, is an osteogenic suppressor. Genetic deletion of Fap significantly ameliorates limb trabecular bone loss during aging. Pharmacological inhibition of Fap significantly promotes bone formation and inhibits bone resorption in wild-type mice by differentially regulating canonical Wnt and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathways. Pharmacological inhibition of Fap promotes osteoblast differentiation, inhibits osteoclast differentiation, and significantly attenuates osteoporosis in ovariectomized mice. Epistasis analyses in zebrafish show that Osteolectin functions as an endogenous inhibitor of Fap to promote vertebrae mineralization. Taken together, we identify Fap as an important osteogenic suppressor and a potential drug target to treat osteoporosis.

Abstract: Summary
The α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor participates in diverse aspects of brain physiology and disease. Neurons tightly control α7 assembly, which relies upon NACHO, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized integral membrane protein. By constructing α7 chimeras and mutants, we find that NACHO requires the α7 ectodomain to promote receptor assembly and surface trafficking. Also critical are two amino acids in the α7 second transmembrane domain. NACHO-mediated assembly is independent and separable from that induced by cholinergic ligands or RIC-3 protein, the latter of which acts on the large α7 intracellular loop. Proteomics indicates that NACHO associates with the ER oligosaccharyltransferase machinery and with calnexin. Accordingly, NACHO-mediated effects on α7 assembly and channel function require N-glycosylation and calnexin chaperone activity. These studies identify ER pathways that mediate α7 assembly by NACHO and provide insights into novel pharmacological strategies for these crucial nicotinic receptors.

Abstract: Autonomous Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activation induces abnormal diastolic Ca2+ leak, which leads to triggered arrhythmias in a wide range of cardiovascular diseases, including diabetic cardiomyopathy. In hyperglycemia, Ca2+ handling alterations can be aggravated under stress conditions via the β-adrenergic signaling pathway, which also involves CaMKII activation. However, little is known about intracellular Ca2+ handling disturbances under β-adrenergic stimulation in cardiomyocytes of the prediabetic metabolic syndrome (MetS) model with obesity, and the participation of CaMKII in these alterations. MetS was induced in male Wistar rats by administering 30 % sucrose in drinking water for 16 weeks. Fluo 3-loaded MetS cardiomyocytes exhibited augmented diastolic Ca2+ leak (in the form of spontaneous Ca2+ waves) under basal conditions and that Ca2+ leakage was exacerbated by isoproterenol (ISO, 100 nM). At the molecular level, [3H]-ryanodine binding and basal phosphorylation of cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) at Ser2814, a CaMKII site, were increased in heart homogenates of MetS rats with no changes in RyR2 expression. These alterations were not further augmented by Isoproterenol. SERCA pump activity was augmented 48 % in MetS hearts before β-adrenergic stimuli, which is associated to augmented PLN phosphorylation at T17, a target of CaMKII. In MetS hearts. CaMKII auto-phosphorylation (T287) was increased by 80 %. The augmented diastolic Ca2+ leak was prevented by CaMKII inhibition with AIP. In conclusion, CaMKII autonomous activation in cardiomyocytes of MetS rats with central obesity significantly contributes to abnormal diastolic Ca2+ leak, increasing the propensity for β-adrenergic receptor-driven lethal arrhythmias.

Abstract: Summary
Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the gene encoding G protein-coupled receptor 35 (GPR35) are associated with increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease. However, the mechanisms by which GPR35 modulates intestinal immune homeostasis remain undefined. Here, integrating zebrafish and mouse experimental models, we demonstrate that intestinal Gpr35 expression is microbiota dependent and enhanced upon inflammation. Moreover, murine GPR35+ colonic macrophages are characterized by enhanced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We identify lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) as a potential endogenous ligand produced during intestinal inflammation, acting through GPR35 to induce tumor necrosis factor (Tnf) expression in macrophages. Mice lacking Gpr35 in CX3CR1+ macrophages aggravate colitis when exposed to dextran sodium sulfate, which is associated with decreased transcript levels of the corticosterone-generating gene Cyp11b1 and macrophage-derived Tnf. Administration of TNF in these mice restores Cyp11b1 expression and intestinal corticosterone production and ameliorates DSS-induced colitis. Our findings indicate that LPA signals through GPR35 in CX3CR1+ macrophages to maintain TNF-mediated intestinal homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Synaptic plasticity is a key mechanism of learning and memory. Synaptic plasticity mechanisms within the nucleus accumbens (NAc) mediate differential behavioral adaptations. Feedforward inhibition in the NAc occurs when glutamatergic afferents onto medium spiny neurons (MSNs) collateralize onto fast-spiking parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons (PV-INs), which exert GABAergic control over MSN action potential generation. Here, we find that feedforward glutamatergic synapses onto PV-INs in the NAc core selectively express Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs). Ca2+ influx by CP-AMPARs on PV-INs triggers long-term depression (LTD) mediated by endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling at presynaptic cannabinoid type-1 (CB1) receptors (CB1Rs). Moreover, CP-AMPARs authorize tonic eCB signaling to negatively regulate glutamate release probability. Blockade of CP-AMPARs in the NAc core in vivo is sufficient to disinhibit locomotor output. These findings elucidate mechanisms by which PV-IN-embedded microcircuits in the NAc undergo activity-dependent shifts in synaptic strength.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular responses to stimuli can evolve over time, resulting in distinct early and late phases in response to a single signal. DNA damage induces a complex response that is largely orchestrated by the transcription factor p53, whose dynamics influence whether a damaged cell will arrest and repair the damage or will initiate cell death. How p53 responses and cellular outcomes evolve in the presence of continuous DNA damage remains unknown. Here, we have found that a subset of cells switches from oscillating to sustained p53 dynamics several days after undergoing damage. The switch results from cell cycle progression in the presence of damaged DNA, which activates the caspase-2-PIDDosome, a complex that stabilizes p53 by inactivating its negative regulator MDM2. This work defines a molecular pathway that is activated if the canonical checkpoints fail to halt mitosis in the presence of damaged DNA.

Abstract: Summary
Calcium is a second messenger crucial to a myriad of cellular processes ranging from regulation of metabolism and cell survival to vesicle release and motility. Current strategies to directly manipulate endogenous calcium signals lack cellular and subcellular specificity. We introduce SpiCee, a versatile and genetically encoded chelator combining low- and high-affinity sites for calcium. This scavenger enables altering endogenous calcium signaling and functions in single cells in vitro and in vivo with biochemically controlled subcellular resolution. SpiCee paves the way to investigate local calcium signaling in vivo and directly manipulate this second messenger for therapeutic use.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR-Cas12c/d proteins share limited homology with Cas12a and Cas9 bacterial CRISPR RNA (crRNA)-guided nucleases used widely for genome editing and DNA detection. However, Cas12c (C2c3)- and Cas12d (CasY)-catalyzed DNA cleavage and genome editing activities have not been directly observed. We show here that a short-complementarity untranslated RNA (scoutRNA), together with crRNA, is required for Cas12d-catalyzed DNA cutting. The scoutRNA differs in secondary structure from previously described tracrRNAs used by CRISPR-Cas9 and some Cas12 enzymes, and in Cas12d-containing systems, scoutRNA includes a conserved five-nucleotide sequence that is essential for activity. In addition to supporting crRNA-directed DNA recognition, biochemical and cell-based experiments establish scoutRNA as an essential cofactor for Cas12c-catalyzed pre-crRNA maturation. These results define scoutRNA as a third type of transcript encoded by a subset of CRISPR-Cas genomic loci and explain how Cas12c/d systems avoid requirements for host factors including ribonuclease III for bacterial RNA-mediated adaptive immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Activated macrophages must carefully calibrate their inflammatory responses to balance efficient pathogen control with inflammation-mediated tissue damage, but the molecular underpinnings of this “balancing act” remain unclear. Using genetically engineered mouse models and primary macrophage cultures, we show that Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling induces the expression of the transcription factor Spic selectively in patrolling monocytes and tissue macrophages by a nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-dependent mechanism. Functionally, Spic downregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines and promotes iron efflux by regulating ferroportin expression in activated macrophages. Notably, interferon-gamma blocks Spic expression in a STAT1-dependent manner. High levels of interferon-gamma are indicative of ongoing infection, and in its absence, activated macrophages appear to engage a “default” Spic-dependent anti-inflammatory pathway. We also provide evidence for the engagement of this pathway in sterile inflammation. Taken together, our findings uncover a pathway wherein counter-regulation of Spic by NF-κB and STATs attune inflammatory responses and iron metabolism in macrophages.

Abstract: Summary
Spatiotemporal control of Wnt/β-catenin signaling is critical for organism development and homeostasis. The poly-(ADP)-ribose polymerase Tankyrase (TNKS1) promotes Wnt/β-catenin signaling through PARylation-mediated degradation of AXIN1, a component of the β-catenin destruction complex. Although Wnt/β-catenin is a niche-restricted signaling program, tissue-specific factors that regulate TNKS1 are not known. Here, we report prostate-associated gene 4 (PAGE4) as a tissue-specific TNKS1 inhibitor that robustly represses canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling in human cells, zebrafish, and mice. Structural and biochemical studies reveal that PAGE4 acts as an optimal substrate decoy that potently hijacks substrate binding sites on TNKS1 to prevent AXIN1 PARylation and degradation. Consistently, transgenic expression of PAGE4 in mice phenocopies TNKS1 knockout. Physiologically, PAGE4 is selectively expressed in stromal prostate fibroblasts and functions to establish a proper Wnt/β-catenin signaling niche through suppression of autocrine signaling. Our findings reveal a non-canonical mechanism for TNKS1 inhibition that functions to establish tissue-specific control of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Spermatogenesis is a complex process of sperm generation, including mitosis, meiosis, and spermiogenesis. During spermiogenesis, histones in post-meiotic spermatids are removed from chromatin and replaced by protamines. Although histone-to-protamine exchange is important for sperm nuclear condensation, the underlying regulatory mechanism is still poorly understood. Here, we identify PHD finger protein 7 (PHF7) as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for histone H3K14 in post-meiotic spermatids. Generation of Phf7-deficient mice and Phf7 C160A knockin mice with impaired E3 ubiquitin ligase activity reveals defects in histone-to-protamine exchange caused by dysregulation of histone removal factor Bromodomain, testis-specific (BRDT) in early condensing spermatids. Surprisingly, E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of PHF7 on histone ubiquitination leads to stabilization of BRDT by attenuating ubiquitination of BRDT. Collectively, our findings identify PHF7 as a critical factor for sperm chromatin condensation and contribute to mechanistic understanding of fundamental phenomenon of histone-to-protamine exchange and potential for drug development for the male reproduction system.

Abstract: Summary
NTRK1 gene fusions are actionable drivers of numerous human malignancies. Here, we show that expression of the TPR-NTRK1 fusion kinase in immortalized mouse pancreatic ductal epithelial (IMPE) (pancreas) or mouse lung epithelial (MLE-12) cells is sufficient to promote rapidly growing tumors in mice. Both tumor models are exquisitely sensitive to targeted inhibition with entrectinib, a tropomyosin-related kinase A (TRKA) inhibitor. Initial regression of NTRK1-driven tumors is driven by induced expression of BIM, such that BIM silencing leads to a diminished response to entrectinib in vivo. However, the emergence of drug-resistant disease limits the long-term durability of responses. Based on the reactivation of RAF>MEK>ERK signaling observed in entrectinib-treated tumors, we show that the combination of entrectinib plus the MEK1/2 inhibitor cobimetinib dramatically forestalls the onset of drug resistance in vivo. Collectively, these data provide a mechanistic rationale for rapid clinical deployment of combined inhibition of TRKA plus MEK1/2 in NTRK1-driven cancers.

Abstract: Summary
When evaluating anti-cancer drugs, two different measurements are used: relative viability, which scores an amalgam of proliferative arrest and cell death, and fractional viability, which specifically scores the degree of cell killing. We quantify relationships between drug-induced growth inhibition and cell death by counting live and dead cells using quantitative microscopy. We find that most drugs affect both proliferation and death, but in different proportions and with different relative timing. This causes a non-uniform relationship between relative and fractional response measurements. To unify these measurements, we created a data visualization and analysis platform called drug GRADE, which characterizes the degree to which death contributes to an observed drug response. GRADE captures drug- and genotype-specific responses, which are not captured using traditional pharmacometrics. This study highlights the idiosyncratic nature of drug-induced proliferative arrest and cell death. Furthermore, we provide a metric for quantitatively evaluating the relationship between these behaviors.

Abstract: In this study, we describe a novel function of TNNC1 (Troponin C1, Slow Skeletal and Cardiac Type), a component of actin-bound troponin, as a tumor suppressor of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). First, the expression of TNNC1 was strongly down-regulated in cancer tissues compared to matched normal lung tissues, and down-regulation of TNNC1 was shown to be strongly correlated with increased mortality among LUAD patients. Interestingly, TNNC1 expression was enhanced by suppression of KRAS, and ectopic expression of TNNC1 in turn inhibited KRASG12D-mediated anchorage independent growth of NIH3T3 cells. Consistently, activation of KRAS pathway in LUAD patients was shown to be strongly correlated with down-regulation of TNNC1. In addition, ectopic expression of TNNC1 inhibited colony formation of multiple LUAD cell lines and induced DNA damage, cell cycle arrest and ultimately apoptosis. We further examined potential correlations between expression levels of TNNC1 and various clinical parameters and found that low-level expression is significantly associated with invasiveness of the tumor. Indeed, RNA interference-mediated down-regulation of TNNC1 led to significant enhancement of invasiveness in vitro. Collectively, our data indicate that TNNC1 has a novel function as a tumor suppressor and is targeted for down-regulation by KRAS pathway during the carcinogenesis of LUAD.

Abstract: Summary
Rare variants in GRIN genes, which encode NMDAR subunits, are strongly associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Among these, GRIN2A, which encodes the GluN2A subunit of NMDARs, is widely accepted as an epilepsy-causative gene. Here, we functionally characterize the de novo GluN2A-S1459G mutation identified in an epilepsy patient. We show that S1459 is a CaMKIIα phosphorylation site, and that endogenous phosphorylation is regulated during development and in response to synaptic activity in a dark rearing model. GluN2A-S1459 phosphorylation results in preferential binding of NMDARs to SNX27 and a corresponding decrease in PSD-95 binding, which consequently regulates NMDAR trafficking. Furthermore, the epilepsy-associated GluN2A-S1459G variant displays defects in interactions with both SNX27 and PSD-95, resulting in trafficking deficits, reduced spine density, and decreased excitatory synaptic transmission. These data demonstrate a role for CaMKIIα phosphorylation of GluN2A in receptor targeting and implicate NMDAR trafficking defects as a link to epilepsy.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a potential source of osteoblasts for the treatment of osteoporosis, but how to better preserve the stemness of MSCs in vitro culture conditions is the main challenge for MSC transplantation. The use of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) supplement has been described and used extensively to increase the expansion of MSCs. Cumulative evidence indicates that bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2; a member of the TGF-β superfamily) is a secreted protein that promotes bone formation, which can regulate cell growth, differentiation, and development. Here we found that BMP2, in combination with FGF2, not only enhanced the proliferation of Macaca bone marrow-derived MSCs but also strengthened their osteogenic potential after short-term expansion in vitro. During long-term expansion, these cells still retained their osteogenic potential as well as other functional characteristics of pluripotent MSCs, which are gradually lost in the absence of BMP2. In addition, the BMP antagonist Noggin did not affect MSC expansion and the osteogenic potential. This study demonstrates that the regulation of BMP signaling can maintain the effectiveness of MSCs during expansion, which promotes the clinical application of MSCs in bone repair.

Abstract: Summary
Valosin-containing protein (VCP)/p97 is an AAA-ATPase that extracts polyubiquitinated substrates from multimeric macromolecular complexes and biological membranes for proteasomal degradation. During p97-mediated extraction, the substrate is largely deubiquitinated as it is threaded through the p97 central pore. How p97-extracted substrates are targeted to the proteasome with few or no ubiquitins is unknown. Here, we report that p97-extracted membrane proteins undergo a second round of ubiquitination catalyzed by the cytosolic ubiquitin ligase RNF126. RNF126 interacts with transmembrane-domain-specific chaperone BAG6, which captures p97-liberated substrates. RNF126 depletion in cells diminishes the ubiquitination of extracted membrane proteins, slows down their turnover, and dramatically stabilizes otherwise transient intermediates in the cytosol. We reconstitute the reubiquitination of a p97-extracted, misfolded multispanning membrane protein with purified factors. Our results demonstrate that p97-extracted substrates need to rapidly engage ubiquitin ligase-chaperone pairs that rebuild the ubiquitin signal for proteasome targeting to prevent harmful accumulation of unfolded intermediates.

Abstract: Summary
Despite its clear impact on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk, apolipoprotein (apo) E4’s contributions to AD etiology remain poorly understood. Progress in answering this and other questions in AD research has been limited by an inability to model human-specific phenotypes in an in vivo environment. Here we transplant human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neurons carrying normal apoE3 or pathogenic apoE4 into human apoE3 or apoE4 knockin mouse hippocampi, enabling us to disentangle the effects of apoE4 produced in human neurons and in the brain environment. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), we identify key transcriptional changes specific to human neuron subtypes in response to endogenous or exogenous apoE4. We also find that Aβ from transplanted human neurons forms plaque-like aggregates, with differences in localization and interaction with microglia depending on the transplant and host apoE genotype. These findings highlight the power of in vivo chimeric disease modeling for studying AD.

Abstract: Summary
Machine learning that generates biological hypotheses has transformative potential, but most learning algorithms are susceptible to pathological failure when exploring regimes beyond the training data distribution. A solution to address this issue is to quantify prediction uncertainty so that algorithms can gracefully handle novel phenomena that confound standard methods. Here, we demonstrate the broad utility of robust uncertainty prediction in biological discovery. By leveraging Gaussian process-based uncertainty prediction on modern pre-trained features, we train a model on just 72 compounds to make predictions over a 10,833-compound library, identifying and experimentally validating compounds with nanomolar affinity for diverse kinases and whole-cell growth inhibition of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Uncertainty facilitates a tight iterative loop between computation and experimentation and generalizes across biological domains as diverse as protein engineering and single-cell transcriptomics. More broadly, our work demonstrates that uncertainty should play a key role in the increasing adoption of machine learning algorithms into the experimental lifecycle.

Abstract: Summary
Sprouty-related, EVH1 domain-containing (SPRED) proteins negatively regulate RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling following growth factor stimulation. This inhibition of RAS is thought to occur primarily through SPRED1 binding and recruitment of neurofibromin, a RasGAP, to the plasma membrane. Here, we report the structure of neurofibromin (GTPase-activating protein [GAP]-related domain) complexed with SPRED1 (EVH1 domain) and KRAS. The structure provides insight into how the membrane targeting of neurofibromin by SPRED1 allows simultaneous interaction with activated KRAS. SPRED1 and NF1 loss-of-function mutations occur across multiple cancer types and developmental diseases. Analysis of the neurofibromin-SPRED1 interface provides a rationale for mutations observed in Legius syndrome and suggests why SPRED1 can bind to neurofibromin but no other RasGAPs. We show that oncogenic EGFR(L858R) signaling leads to the phosphorylation of SPRED1 on serine 105, disrupting the SPRED1-neurofibromin complex. The structural, biochemical, and biological results provide new mechanistic insights about how SPRED1 interacts with neurofibromin and regulates active KRAS levels in normal and pathologic conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Adipocytes deficient in fatty acid synthase (iAdFASNKO) emit signals that mimic cold exposure to enhance the appearance of thermogenic beige adipocytes in mouse inguinal white adipose tissues (iWATs). Both cold exposure and iAdFASNKO upregulate the sympathetic nerve fiber (SNF) modulator Neuregulin 4 (Nrg4), activate SNFs, and require adipocyte cyclic AMP/protein kinase A (cAMP/PKA) signaling for beige adipocyte appearance, as it is blocked by adipocyte Gsα deficiency. Surprisingly, however, in contrast to cold-exposed mice, neither iWAT denervation nor Nrg4 loss attenuated adipocyte browning in iAdFASNKO mice. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of iWAT stromal cells revealed increased macrophages displaying gene expression signatures of the alternately activated type in iAdFASNKO mice, and their depletion abrogated iWAT beiging. Altogether, these findings reveal that divergent cellular pathways are sufficient to cause adipocyte browning. Importantly, adipocyte signaling to enhance alternatively activated macrophages in iAdFASNKO mice is associated with enhanced adipose thermogenesis independent of the sympathetic neuron involvement this process requires in the cold.

Abstract: Summary
RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play critical roles in regulating gene expression by modulating splicing, RNA stability, and protein translation. Stimulus-induced alterations in RBP function contribute to global changes in gene expression, but identifying which RBPs are responsible for the observed changes remains an unmet need. Here, we present Transite, a computational approach that systematically infers RBPs influencing gene expression through changes in RNA stability and degradation. As a proof of principle, we apply Transite to RNA expression data from human patients with non-small-cell lung cancer whose tumors were sampled at diagnosis or after recurrence following treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. Transite implicates known RBP regulators of the DNA damage response and identifies hnRNPC as a new modulator of chemotherapeutic resistance, which we subsequently validated experimentally. Transite serves as a framework for the identification of RBPs that drive cell-state transitions and adds additional value to the vast collection of publicly available gene expression datasets.

Abstract: Summary
The DNA-dependent pattern recognition receptor, cGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase), mediates communication between the DNA damage and the immune responses. Mitotic chromosome missegregation stimulates cGAS activity; however, it is unclear whether progression through mitosis is required for cancercell-intrinsic activation of anti-tumor immune responses. Moreover, it is unknown whether cell cycle checkpoint disruption can restore responses in cancer cells that are recalcitrant to DNAdamage-induced inflammation. Here, we demonstrate that prolonged cell cycle arrest at the G2-mitosis boundary from either excessive DNA damage or CDK1 inhibition prevents inflammatory-stimulated gene expression and immune-mediated destruction of distal tumors. Remarkably, DNAdamage-induced inflammatory signaling is restored in a RIG-I-dependent manner upon concomitant disruption of p53 and the G2 checkpoint. These findings link aberrant cell progression and p53 loss to an expanded spectrum of damage-associated molecular pattern recognition and have implications for the design of rational approaches to augment anti-tumor immune responses.

Abstract: Summary
Canonical Wnt signaling is emerging as a major regulator of endocytosis. Here, we report that Wnt-induced macropinocytosis is regulated through glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and the β-catenin destruction complex. We find that mutation of Axin1, a tumor suppressor and component of the destruction complex, results in the activation of macropinocytosis. Surprisingly, inhibition of GSK3 by lithium chloride (LiCl), CHIR99021, or dominant-negative GSK3 triggers macropinocytosis. GSK3 inhibition causes a rapid increase in acidic endolysosomes that is independent of new protein synthesis. GSK3 inhibition or Axin1 mutation increases lysosomal activity, which can be followed with tracers of active cathepsin D, β-glucosidase, and ovalbumin degradation. Microinjection of LiCl into the blastula cavity of Xenopus embryos causes a striking increase in dextran macropinocytosis. The effects of GSK3 inhibition on protein degradation in endolysosomes are blocked by the macropinocytosis inhibitors EIPA or IPA-3, suggesting that increases in membrane trafficking drive lysosomal activity.

Abstract: Summary
Ebola virus (EBOV) causes a severe, often fatal disease in humans and nonhuman primates. Within the past decade, EBOV has caused two large and difficult-to-control outbreaks, one of which recently ended in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Bats are the likely reservoir of EBOV, but little is known of their relationship with the virus. We perform serial passages of EBOV in human and bat cells and use circular sequencing to compare the short-term evolution of the virus. Virus populations passaged in bat cells have sequence markers indicative of host RNA editing enzyme activity, including evidence for ADAR editing of the EBOV glycoprotein. Multiple regions in the EBOV genome appear to have undergone adaptive evolution when passaged in bat and human cells. Individual mutated viruses are rescued and characterized. Our results provide insight into the host species-specific evolution of EBOV and highlight the adaptive flexibility of the virus.

Abstract: Summary
Sex differences manifest in many diseases and may drive sex-specific therapeutic responses. To understand the molecular basis of sex differences, we evaluated sex-biased gene regulation by constructing sample-specific gene regulatory networks in 29 human healthy tissues using 8,279 whole-genome expression profiles from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. We find sex-biased regulatory network structures in each tissue. Even though most transcription factors (TFs) are not differentially expressed between males and females, many have sex-biased regulatory targeting patterns. In each tissue, genes that are differentially targeted by TFs between the sexes are enriched for tissue-related functions and diseases. In brain tissue, for example, genes associated with Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease are targeted by different sets of TFs in each sex. Our systems-based analysis identifies a repertoire of TFs that play important roles in sex-specific architecture of gene regulatory networks, and it underlines sex-specific regulatory processes in both health and disease.

Abstract: Summary
Using genome-wide radiogenetic profiling, we functionally dissect vulnerabilities of cancer cells to ionizing radiation (IR). We identify ERCC6L2 as a major determinant of IR response, together with classical DNA damage response genes and members of the recently identified shieldin and CTC1-STN1-TEN1 (CST) complexes. We show that ERCC6L2 contributes to non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), and it may exert this function through interactions with SFPQ. In addition to causing radiosensitivity, ERCC6L2 loss restores DNA end resection and partially rescues homologous recombination (HR) in BRCA1-deficient cells. As a consequence, ERCC6L2 deficiency confers resistance to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition in tumors deficient for both BRCA1 and p53. Moreover, we show that ERCC6L2 mutations are found in human tumors and correlate with a better overall survival in patients treated with radiotherapy (RT); this finding suggests that ERCC6L2 is a predictive biomarker of RT response.

Abstract: Summary
Lactate is used as an energy source by producer cells or shuttled to neighboring cells and tissues. Both glucose and lactate fulfill the bioenergetic demand of neurons, the latter imported from astrocytes. The contribution of astrocytic lactate to neuronal bioenergetics and the mechanisms of astrocytic lactate production are incompletely understood. Through in vivo 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy, 13C glucose mass spectroscopy, and electroencephalographic and molecular studies, here we show that the energy sensor AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates neuronal survival in a non-cell-autonomous manner. Ampk-null mice are deficient in brain lactate and are seizure prone. Ampk deletion in astroglia, but not neurons, causes neuronal loss in both mammalian and fly brains. Mechanistically, astrocytic AMPK phosphorylated and destabilized thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), enabling expression and surface translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT1, glucose uptake, and lactate production. Ampk loss in astrocytes causes TXNIP hyperstability, GLUT1 misregulation, inadequate glucose metabolism, and neuronal loss.

Abstract: Summary
Enzymes or enzyme complexes can be concentrated in different cellular loci to modulate distinct functional processes in response to specific signals. How cells condense and compartmentalize enzyme complexes for spatiotemporally distinct cellular events is not well understood. Here we discover that specific and tight association of GIT1 and β-Pix, a pair of GTPase regulatory enzymes, leads to phase separation of the complex without additional scaffolding molecules. GIT1/β-Pix condensates are modular in nature and can be positioned at distinct cellular compartments, such as neuronal synapses, focal adhesions, and cell-cell junctions, by upstream adaptors. Guided by the structure of the GIT/PIX complex, we specifically probed the role of phase separation of the enzyme complex in cell migration and synapse formation. Our study suggests that formation of modular enzyme complex condensates via phase separation can dynamically concentrate limited quantities of enzymes to distinct cellular compartments for specific and optimal signaling.

Abstract: Summary
A fundamental question in developmental biology is how morphogens, such as bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), form precise signaling gradients to impart positional and functional identity to the cells of the early embryo. We combine rigorous mutant analyses with quantitative immunofluorescence to determine that the proteases Bmp1a and Tolloid spatially restrict the BMP antagonist Chordin in dorsoventral (DV) axial patterning of the early zebrafish gastrula. We show that maternally deposited Bmp1a plays an unexpected and non-redundant role in establishing the BMP signaling gradient, while the Bmp1a/Tolloid antagonist Sizzled is surprisingly dispensable. Combining computational modeling and in vivo analyses with an immobile Chordin construct, we demonstrate that long-range Chordin diffusion is not necessary for BMP gradient formation and DV patterning. Our data do not support a counter-gradient of Chordin and instead favor a Chordin sink, established by Bmp1a and Tolloid, as the primary mechanism that drives BMP gradient formation.

Abstract: Summary
MutSα and MutSβ play important roles in DNA mismatch repair and are linked to inheritable cancers and degenerative disorders. Here, we show that MSH2 and MSH3, the two components of MutSβ, bind SLX4 protein, a scaffold for the assembly of the SLX1-SLX4-MUS81-EME1-XPF-ERCC1 (SMX) trinuclease complex. SMX promotes the resolution of Holliday junctions (HJs), which are intermediates in homologous recombinational repair. We find that MutSβ binds HJs and stimulates their resolution by SLX1-SLX4 or SMX in reactions dependent upon direct interactions between MutSβ and SLX4. In contrast, MutSα does not stimulate HJ resolution. MSH3-depleted cells exhibit reduced sister chromatid exchanges and elevated levels of homologous recombination ultrafine bridges (HR-UFBs) at mitosis, consistent with defects in the processing of recombination intermediates. These results demonstrate a role for MutSβ in addition to its established role in the pathogenic expansion of CAG/CTG trinucleotide repeats, which is causative of myotonic dystrophy and Huntington’s disease.

Abstract: Summary
The UbiA superfamily of intramembrane prenyltransferases catalyzes an isoprenyl transfer reaction in the biosynthesis of lipophilic compounds involved in cellular physiological processes. Digeranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate (DGGGP) synthase (DGGGPase) generates unique membrane core lipids for the formation of the ether bond between the glycerol moiety and the alkyl chains in archaea and has been confirmed to be a member of the UbiA superfamily. Here, the crystal structure is reported to exhibit nine transmembrane helices along with a large lateral opening covered by a cytosolic cap domain and a unique substrate-binding central cavity. Notably, the lipid-bound states of this enzyme demonstrate that the putative substrate-binding pocket is occupied by the lipidic molecules used for crystallization, indicating the binding mode of hydrophobic substrates. Collectively, these structural and functional studies provide not only an understanding of lipid biosynthesis by substrate-specific lipid-modifying enzymes but also insights into the mechanisms of lipid membrane remodeling and adaptation.

Abstract: Summary
Aberrant redox signaling underlies the pathophysiology of many chronic metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes (T2D). Methodologies aimed at rebalancing systemic redox homeostasis have had limited success. A noninvasive, sustained approach would enable the long-term control of redox signaling for the treatment of T2D. We report that static magnetic and electric fields (sBE) noninvasively modulate the systemic GSH-to-GSSG redox couple to promote a healthier systemic redox environment that is reducing. Strikingly, when applied to mouse models of T2D, sBE rapidly ameliorates insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in as few as 3 days with no observed adverse effects. Scavenging paramagnetic byproducts of oxygen metabolism with SOD2 in hepatic mitochondria fully abolishes these insulin sensitizing effects, demonstrating that mitochondrial superoxide mediates induction of these therapeutic changes. Our findings introduce a remarkable redox-modulating phenomenon that exploits endogenous electromagneto-receptive mechanisms for the noninvasive treatment of T2D, and potentially other redox-related diseases.

Abstract: NB4 cell, the human acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cell line, was treated with various concentrations of arsenic trioxide (ATO) to induce apoptosis, measured by staining with 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD) by flow cytometry. 2’, 7’-dichlorodihydro-fluorescein-diacetate (DCF-DA) and MitoSOX™ Red mitochondrial superoxide indicator were used to detect intracellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). The steady-state level of SO2 (Cysteine sulfinic acid, Cys-SO2H) form for peroxiredoxin 3 (PRX3) was measured by a western blot. To evaluate the effect of sulfiredoxin 1 depletion, NB4 cells were transfected with small interfering RNA and analyzed for their influence on ROS, redox enzymes, and apoptosis. The mitochondrial ROS of NB4 cells significantly increased after ATO treatment. NB4 cell apoptosis after ATO treatment increased in a time- dependent manner. Increased SO2 form and dimeric PRX3 were observed as a hyperoxidation reaction in NB4 cells post- ATO treatment, in concordance with mitochondrial ROS accumulation. Sulfiredoxin 1 expression is downregulated by small interfering RNA transfection, which potentiated mitochondrial ROS generation and cell growth arrest in ATO- treated NB4 cells. Our results indicate that ATO-induced ROS generation in APL cell mitochondria is attributable to PRX3 hyperoxidation as well as dimerized PRX3 accumulation, subsequently triggering apoptosis. The downregulation of sulfiredoxin 1 could amplify apoptosis in ATO-treated APL cells.

Abstract: Summary
Lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi)/LTi-like cells are critical for lymphoid organogenesis and regulation of adaptive immunity in various tissues. However, the maintenance and regulation mechanisms of LTi-like cells among different tissues are not clear yet. Here, we find that LTi-like cells from different tissues display heterogeneity. The maintenance of LTi-like cells in the mesenteric lymph node (mLN), but not the gut, requires RANKL signaling from CD4+ T cells. LTi-like cells from the mLN, but not the gut, could in turn inhibit the development of T follicular helper cells and subsequent humoral responses during intestinal immunization in an ID2- and PD-L1-dependent manner. Together, our findings implicate that the interaction between LTi-like cells and T cells in the mLN could precisely control the intestinal mucosal adaptive immune response.

Abstract: Summary
During development of the central nervous system (CNS), neurons polarize and rapidly extend their axons to assemble neuronal circuits. The growth cone leads the axon to its target and drives axon growth. Here, we explored the mechanisms underlying axon growth in three dimensions. Live in situ imaging and super-resolution microscopy combined with pharmacological and molecular manipulations as well as biophysical force measurements revealed that growth cones extend CNS axons independent of pulling forces on their substrates and without the need for adhesions in three-dimensional (3D) environments. In 3D, microtubules grow unrestrained from the actomyosin cytoskeleton into the growth cone leading edge to enable rapid axon extension. Axons extend and polarize even in adhesion-inert matrices. Thus, CNS neurons use amoeboid mechanisms to drive axon growth. Together with our understanding that adult CNS axons regenerate by reactivating developmental processes, our findings illuminate how cytoskeletal manipulations enable axon regeneration in the adult CNS.

Abstract: Summary
Golgi fragmentation and ER exit site disassembly are considered to be the leading causes of the mitotic block of secretion from the ER. Although the mechanisms of Golgi fragmentation have been extensively characterized, ER exit block early in mitosis is not well understood. We previously demonstrated that TANGO1 organizes ER exit sites by directly interacting with Sec16. In this study, we identified TANGO1 as a regulator of ER exit site disassembly during mitosis. TANGO1 phosphorylation was observed to be coordinately regulated by a kinase (CK1) and a phosphatase (PP1). CK1-mediated TANGO1 phosphorylation reduces binding to Sec16, leading to the disassembly of ER exit sites. CK1 constantly phosphorylates TANGO1, whereas PP1-mediated dephosphorylation of TANGO1 decreases during mitosis. Thus, the phosphorylation status of TANGO1, which is controlled by balanced activities of the kinase CK1 and the phosphatase PP1, regulates the organization of ER exit sites during the cell cycle.

Abstract: Summary
Oligodendrogenesis occurs during early postnatal development, coincident with neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, raising the possibility that microglia-dependent pruning mechanisms that modulate neurons regulate myelin sheath formation. Here we show a population of ameboid microglia migrating from the ventricular zone into the corpus callosum during early postnatal development, termed “the fountain of microglia,” phagocytosing viable oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) before onset of myelination. Fractalkine receptor-deficient mice exhibit a reduction in microglial engulfment of viable OPCs, increased numbers of oligodendrocytes, and reduced myelin thickness but no change in axon number. These data provide evidence that microglia phagocytose OPCs as a homeostatic mechanism for proper myelination. A hallmark of hypomyelinating developmental disorders such as periventricular leukomalacia and of adult demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis is increased numbers of oligodendrocytes but failure to myelinate, suggesting that microglial pruning of OPCs may be impaired in pathological states and hinder myelination.

Abstract: Arginine kinase (AK), a bioenergy-related enzyme, is distributed widely in invertebrates. The role of highly conserved histidines in AKs is still unascertained. In this study, the highly conserved histidine 284 (H284) in AK of Daphnia magna (DmAK) was replaced with alanine to elucidate the role of H284. We examined the alteration of catalytic activity and structural changes of H284A in DmAK. The catalytic activity of H284A was reduced dramatically compared to that in wild type (WT). Thus the crystal structure of H284A displayed several structural changes, including the alteration of D324, a hydrogen-bonding network around H284, and the disruption of π-stacking between the imidazole group of the H284 residue and the adenine ring of ATP. These findings suggest that such alterations might affect a conformational change of the specific loop consisting of G310-V322 at the antiparallel β-sheet region. Thus, we speculated that the H284 residue might play an important role in the conformational change of the specific loop when ATP binds to the substrate-binding site of DmAK

Abstract: Summary
Craniofacial abnormalities often involve sutures, the growth centers of the skull. To characterize the organization and processes governing their development, we profile the murine frontal suture, a model for sutural growth and fusion, at the tissue- and single-cell level on embryonic days (E)16.5 and E18.5. For the wild-type suture, bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis identifies mesenchyme-, osteogenic front-, and stage-enriched genes and biological processes, as well as alternative splicing events modifying the extracellular matrix. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis distinguishes multiple subpopulations, of which five define a mesenchyme-osteoblast differentiation trajectory and show variation along the anteroposterior axis. Similar analyses of in vivo mouse models of impaired frontal suturogenesis in Saethre-Chotzen and Apert syndromes, Twist1+/− and Fgfr2+/S252W, demonstrate distinct transcriptional changes involving angiogenesis and ribogenesis, respectively. Co-expression network analysis reveals gene expression modules from which we validate key driver genes regulating osteoblast differentiation. Our study provides a global approach to gain insights into suturogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the novel viral disease COVID-19. With no approved therapies, this pandemic illustrates the urgent need for broad-spectrum antiviral countermeasures against SARS-CoV-2 and future emerging CoVs. We report that remdesivir (RDV) potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung cells and primary human airway epithelial cultures (EC50 = 0.01 μM). Weaker activity is observed in Vero E6 cells (EC50 = 1.65 μM) because of their low capacity to metabolize RDV. To rapidly evaluate in vivo efficacy, we engineered a chimeric SARS-CoV encoding the viral target of RDV, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2. In mice infected with the chimeric virus, therapeutic RDV administration diminishes lung viral load and improves pulmonary function compared with vehicle-treated animals. These data demonstrate that RDV is potently active against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in vivo, supporting its further clinical testing for treatment of COVID-19.

Abstract: Summary
The PTEN tumor suppressor controls cell death and survival by regulating functions of various molecular targets. While the role of PTEN lipid-phosphatase activity on PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and inhibition of PI3K pathway is well characterized, the biological relevance of PTEN protein-phosphatase activity remains undefined. Here, using knockin (KI) mice harboring cancer-associated and functionally relevant missense mutations, we show that although loss of PTEN lipid-phosphatase function cooperates with oncogenic PI3K to promote rapid mammary tumorigenesis, the additional loss of PTEN protein-phosphatase activity triggered an extensive cell death response evident in early and advanced mammary tumors. Omics and drug-targeting studies revealed that PI3Ks act to reduce glucocorticoid receptor (GR) levels, which are rescued by loss of PTEN protein-phosphatase activity to restrain cell survival. Thus, we find that the dual regulation of GR by PI3K and PTEN functions as a rheostat that can be exploited for the treatment of PTEN loss-driven cancers.

Abstract: Stringent regulation of the chondrocyte cell cycle is required for endochondral bone formation. During the longitudinal growth of long bones, mesenchymal stem cells condense and differentiate into chondrocytes. Epiphyseal chondrocytes sequentially differentiate to form growth-plate cartilage, which is subsequently replaced with bone. Although the importance of nuclear factor 1C (Nfic) in hard tissue formation has been extensively studied, knowledge regarding its biological roles and molecular mechanisms in this process remains insufficient. Herein, we demonstrated that Nfic deficiency affects femoral growth-plate formation. Chondrocyte proliferation was downregulated and the number of apoptotic cell was increased in the growth plates of Nfic-/- mice. Further, the expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21 was upregulated in the primary chondrocytes of Nfic-/- mice, whereas that of cyclin D1 was downregulated. Our findings suggest that Nfic may contribute to postnatal chondrocyte proliferation by inhibiting p21 expression and by increasing the stability of cyclin D1 protein.

Abstract: Summary
(p)ppGpp is a nucleotide messenger universally produced in bacteria following nutrient starvation. In E. coli, ppGpp inhibits purine nucleotide synthesis by targeting several different enzymes, but the physiological significance of their inhibition is unknown. Here, we report the structural basis of inhibition for one target, Gsk, the inosine-guanosine kinase. Gsk creates an unprecedented, allosteric binding pocket for ppGpp by restructuring terminal sequences, which restrains conformational dynamics necessary for catalysis. Guided by this structure, we generated a chromosomal mutation that abolishes Gsk regulation by ppGpp. This mutant strain accumulates abnormally high levels of purine nucleotides following amino-acid starvation, compromising cellular fitness. We demonstrate that this unrestricted increase in purine nucleotides is detrimental because it severely depletes pRpp and essential, pRpp-derived metabolites, including UTP, histidine, and tryptophan. Thus, our results reveal the significance of ppGpp’s regulation of purine nucleotide synthesis and a critical mechanism by which E. coli coordinates biosynthetic processes during starvation.

Abstract: Summary
Effector, but not naïve, T cells are activated by toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2) stimulation, leading to cytokine production and proliferation. We found that the differential response is attributable to the lack of expression of the adaptor protein TIRAP in naive T cells. TIRAP expression is induced upon T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation and sustained by strong interleukin-2 (IL-2) signals. Expression of TIRAP requires TCR- and IL-2-induced mTORC1 activation. TLR2 stimulation induced the activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and ERK, leading to much higher production of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) by T helper 1 (Th1) cells cultured in a high concentration of IL-2 than by those cultured in a low concentration of IL-2. In contrast, TLR2 stimulation induces mTORC1 activation through TIRAP, which is essential for TLR2-mediated IFN-γ production. These data demonstrate that the mTORC1 signal confers the response to TLR2 signaling by inducing TIRAP expression and that the TIRAP-mTORC1 axis is critical for TLR2-mediated IFN-γ production by effector T cells.

Abstract: Summary
Transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) is a non-selective cation channel, broadly expressed throughout the body. Despite its expression in the mammalian brain, little is known about the contribution of TRPA1 to cortical function. Here, we characterize how TRPA1 affects sensory information processing in two cortical areas in mice: the primary vibrissal (whisker) somatosensory cortex (vS1) and the primary visual cortex (V1). In vS1, local activation of TRPA1 by allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) increases the ongoing activity of neurons and their evoked response to vibrissal stimulation, producing a positive gain modulation. The gain modulation is reversed by TRPA1 inhibitor HC-030031 and is absent in TRPA1 knockout mice. Similarly, in V1, TRPA1 activation increases the gain of direction and orientation selectivity. Linear decoding of V1 population activity confirms faster and more reliable encoding of visual signals under TRPA1 activation. Overall, our findings reveal a physiological role for TRPA1 in enhancing sensory signals in the mammalian cortex.

Abstract: Summary
The NADase SARM1 is a central switch in injury-activated axon degeneration, an early hallmark of many neurological diseases. Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of autoinhibited (3.3 Å) and active SARM1 (6.8 Å) and provide mechanistic insight into the tight regulation of SARM1’s function by the local metabolic environment. Although both states retain an octameric core, the defining feature of the autoinhibited state is a lock between the autoinhibitory Armadillo/HEAT motif (ARM) and catalytic Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains, which traps SARM1 in an inactive state. Mutations that break this lock activate SARM1, resulting in catastrophic neuronal death. Notably, the mutants cannot be further activated by the endogenous activator nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), and active SARM1 is product inhibited by Nicotinamide (NAM), highlighting SARM1’s functional dependence on key metabolites in the NAD salvage pathway. Our studies provide a molecular understanding of SARM1’s transition from an autoinhibited to an injury-activated state and lay the foundation for future SARM1-based therapies to treat axonopathies.

Abstract: Summary
DNA binding allosterically activates the cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP [cGAMP] synthase) to synthesize 2′3′-cGAMP, using Mg2+ as the metal cofactor that catalyzes two nucleotidyl-transferring reactions. We previously found that Mn2+ potentiates cGAS activation, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we report that Mn2+ directly activates cGAS. Structural analysis reveals that Mn2+-activated cGAS undergoes globally similar conformational changes to DNA-activated cGAS but forms a unique η1 helix to widen the catalytic pocket, allowing substrate entry and cGAMP synthesis. Strikingly, in Mn2+-activated cGAS, the linear intermediates pppGpG and pGpA take an inverted orientation in the active pocket, suggesting a noncanonical but accelerated cGAMP cyclization without substrate flip-over. Moreover, unlike the octahedral coordination around Mg2+, the two catalytic Mn2+ are coordinated by triphosphate moiety of the inverted substrate, independent of the catalytic triad residues. Our findings thus uncover Mn2+ as a cGAS activator that initiates noncanonical 2′3′-cGAMP synthesis.

Abstract: Summary
DNA double strand breaks induce oscillatory expression of the transcription factor p53 that is dependent on ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) activity and the rate of double strand break resolution. Although p53 dynamics are known to play a role in the regulation of cell fate determination, the consequences of the variability in dynamics associated with differences in repair rates and utilized repair pathways are unknown. Using single-cell time-lapse microscopy, we found that disruption of specific repair pathways has distinct impacts on p53 dynamics. The small-molecule rucaparib, an inhibitor of the alternative end-joining-associated protein poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), increased p53 pulse duration, altering the temporal expression of multiple p53 target genes. As a result, combination treatments of the radiomimetic drug neocarzinostatin with rucaparib drove prolonged growth arrest beyond that of DNA damage alone. This study highlights how pharmacological manipulation of DNA repair pathways may be used to alter p53 dynamics to enhance therapeutic regimens.

Abstract: Summary
The crosstalk between tumor cells and the adjacent normal epithelium contributes to cancer progression, but its regulators have remained elusive. Here, we show that breast cancer cells maintained in hypoxia release small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) that activate mitochondrial dynamics, stimulate mitochondrial movements, and promote organelle accumulation at the cortical cytoskeleton in normal mammary epithelial cells. This results in AKT serine/threonine kinase (Akt) activation, membrane focal adhesion turnover, and increased epithelial cell migration. RNA sequencing profiling identified integrin-linked kinase (ILK) as the most upregulated pathway in sEV-treated epithelial cells, and genetic or pharmacologic targeting of ILK reversed mitochondrial reprogramming and suppressed sEV-induced cell movements. In a three-dimensional (3D) model of mammary gland morphogenesis, sEV treatment induced hallmarks of malignant transformation, with deregulated cell death and/or cell proliferation, loss of apical-basal polarity, and appearance of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers. Therefore, sEVs released by hypoxic breast cancer cells reprogram mitochondrial dynamics and induce oncogenic changes in a normal mammary epithelium.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the important roles of protein kinase Cε (PKCε) and transient receptor potential vanilloind 1 (TRPV1) in inflammatory hypersensitivity, how PKCε is involved in the regulation of thermal hyperalgesia is not fully understood. We report here that PKCε is SUMOylated at a C-terminal lysine residue (K534), which enhances the sensitivity of the TRPV1 channel. We demonstrate that PKCε phosphorylation promotes its SUMOylation, which in turn regulates the phosphorylation level of TRPV1 serine 800 residue via controlling the binding of PKCε and TRPV1 and increased PKCε kinase activity. More importantly, the reduced ability of PKCε knockdown mice to develop inflammatory thermal hyperalgesia was rescued by viral infection of lumbar 4/5 dorsal root ganglia neurons of wild-type PKCε, but not the SUMOylation-deficient PKCε mutant. Therefore, the SUMOylation of PKCε potentiates inflammatory thermal hyperalgesia through stabilizing the interaction with TRPV1 to enhance its function by phosphorylation.

Abstract: Summary
Advanced maternal age is highly associated with a decline in oocyte quality, but effective approaches to improve it have still not been fully determined. Here, we report that in vivo supplementation of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) efficaciously improves the quality of oocytes from naturally aged mice by recovering nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) levels. NMN supplementation not only increases ovulation of aged oocytes but also enhances their meiotic competency and fertilization ability by maintaining the normal spindle/chromosome structure and the dynamics of the cortical granule component ovastacin. Moreover, single-cell transcriptome analysis shows that the beneficial effect of NMN on aged oocytes is mediated by restoration of mitochondrial function, eliminating the accumulated ROS to suppress apoptosis. Collectively, our data reveal that NMN supplementation is a feasible approach to protect oocytes from advanced maternal age-related deterioration, contributing to the improvement of reproductive outcome of aged women and assisted reproductive technology.

Abstract: Summary
Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of mice show opposing activities upon the initiation of a food-seeking lever press task. Ventromedial striatal (VMS)-MSNs are inhibited but ventrolateral striatal (VLS)-MSNs are activated; these activities mediate action selection and action initiation, respectively. To understand what input shapes the opposing MSN activities, here, we monitor cortical input activities at the cell population level and artificially reverse them. We demonstrate that the ventral hippocampus (vHP) and the insular cortex (IC) are major inputs to the VMS and VLS, both projections show silencing at the trial start time, and the vHP-VMS and IC-VLS pathways form functionally coupled input-output units during the task. Of note, the upstream IC silencing is converted to the downstream VLS-MSN activation. We find biased localization of striatal parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PV INs) and verify PV IN-dependent feedforward architecture in the VLS. Our results reveal a distinct mode of cortico-striatal signal conveyance via feedforward disinhibition in behaving animals.

Abstract: Summary
Cell competition in the thymus is a homeostatic process that drives turnover. If the process is impaired, thymopoiesis can be autonomously maintained for several weeks, but this causes leukemia. We aimed to understand the effect of cell competition on thymopoiesis, identify the cells involved, and determine how the process is regulated. Using thymus transplantation experiments, we found that cell competition occurs within the double-negative 2 (DN2) and 3 early (DN3e) thymocytes and inhibits thymus autonomy. Furthermore, the expansion of DN2b is regulated by a negative feedback loop that is imposed by double-positive thymocytes and determines the kinetics of thymopoiesis. This feedback loop affects the cell cycle duration of DN2b, in a response controlled by interleukin 7 availability. Altogether, we show that thymocytes do not merely follow a pre-determined path if provided with the correct signals. Instead, thymopoiesis dynamically integrates cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous aspects that fine-tune normal thymus function.

Abstract: Summary
Lethal drugs can induce incomplete cell death in a population of cancer cells, a phenomenon referred to as fractional killing. Here, we show that high-throughput population-level time-lapse imaging can be used to quantify fractional killing in response to hundreds of different drug treatments in parallel. We find that stable intermediate levels of fractional killing are uncommon, with many drug treatments resulting in complete or near-complete eradication of all cells, if given enough time. The kinetics of fractional killing over time vary substantially as a function of drug, drug dose, and genetic background. At the molecular level, the antiapoptotic protein MCL1 is an important determinant of the kinetics of fractional killing in response to MAPK pathway inhibitors but not other lethal stimuli. These studies suggest that fractional killing is governed by diverse lethal stimulus-specific mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
A large share of the non-coding transcriptome in yeast is controlled by the Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 (NNS) complex, which promotes transcription termination of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes, and by the nuclear exosome, which limits the steady-state levels of the transcripts produced. How unconstrained ncRNA levels affect RNA metabolism and gene expression are long-standing and important questions. Here, we show that degradation of ncRNAs by the exosome is required for freeing Nrd1 and Nab3 from the released transcript after termination. In exosome mutants, these factors are sequestered by ncRNAs and cannot be efficiently recycled to sites of transcription, inducing termination defects at NNS targets. ncRNA-dependent, genome-wide termination defects can be recapitulated by the expression of a degradation-resistant, circular RNA containing a natural NNS target in exosome-proficient cells. Our results have important implications for the mechanism of termination, the general impact of ncRNAs abundance, and the importance of nuclear ncRNA degradation.

Abstract: Summary
eIF3, a multi-subunit complex with numerous functions in canonical translation initiation, is known to interact with 40S and 60S ribosomal proteins and translation elongation factors, but a direct involvement in translation elongation has never been demonstrated. We found that eIF3 deficiency reduced early ribosomal elongation speed between codons 25 and 75 on a set of ∼2,700 mRNAs encoding proteins associated with mitochondrial and membrane functions, resulting in defective synthesis of their encoded proteins. To promote elongation, eIF3 interacts with 80S ribosomes translating the first ∼60 codons and serves to recruit protein quality-control factors, functions required for normal mitochondrial physiology. Accordingly, eIF3e+/− mice accumulate defective mitochondria in skeletal muscle and show a progressive decline in muscle strength. Hence, eIF3 interacts with 80S ribosomes to enhance, at the level of early elongation, the synthesis of proteins with membrane-associated functions, an activity that is critical for mitochondrial physiology and muscle health.

Abstract: Summary
Overweight and obesity are associated with type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, cardiovascular disease and cancer, but all fat is not equal, as storing excess lipid in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (SWAT) is more metabolically favorable than in visceral fat. Here, we uncover a critical role for mTORC2 in setting SWAT lipid handling capacity. We find that subcutaneous white preadipocytes differentiating without the essential mTORC2 subunit Rictor upregulate mature adipocyte markers but develop a striking lipid storage defect resulting in smaller adipocytes, reduced tissue size, lipid re-distribution to visceral and brown fat, and sex-distinct effects on systemic metabolic fitness. Mechanistically, mTORC2 promotes transcriptional upregulation of select lipid metabolism genes controlled by PPARγ and ChREBP, including genes that control lipid uptake, synthesis, and degradation pathways as well as Akt2, which encodes a major mTORC2 substrate and insulin effector. Further exploring this pathway may uncover new strategies to improve insulin sensitivity.

Abstract: Summary
RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) commonly feature multiple RNA-binding domains (RBDs), which provide these proteins with a modular architecture. Accumulating evidence supports that RBP architectural modularity and adaptability define the specificity of their interactions with RNA. However, how multiple RBDs recognize their cognate single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) sequences in concert remains poorly understood. Here, we use Upstream of N-Ras (Unr) as a model system to address this question. Although reported to contain five ssRNA-binding cold-shock domains (CSDs), we demonstrate that Unr includes an additional four CSDs that do not bind RNA (pseudo-RBDs) but are involved in mediating RNA tertiary structure specificity by reducing the conformational heterogeneity of Unr. Disrupting the interactions between canonical and non-canonical CSDs impacts RNA binding, Unr-mediated translation regulation, and the Unr-dependent RNA interactome. Taken together, our studies reveal a new paradigm in protein-RNA recognition, where interactions between RBDs and pseudo-RBDs select RNA tertiary structures, influence RNP assembly, and define target specificity.

Abstract: Summary
Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) is the first enzyme in the serine synthesis pathway in which it is also the rate-limiting enzyme. It is significantly upregulated in many cancers, especially breast cancer. However, the posttranslational mechanism of PHGDH upregulation in breast cancer is unknown. In this study, we find that RNF5, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is essential for the degradation of PHGDH protein. PHGDH is degraded by RNF5 to prevent the proliferation of breast cancer cells. The acetylation of PHGDH at K58 is able to disrupt the interaction of RNF5-PHGDH and promote the proliferation of breast cancer cells. Tip60 and SIRT2 regulate the reversible acetylation modification of PHGDH in response to glucose alteration. Moreover, PHGDH is significantly upregulated in samples of human breast cancer and is associated with decreased RNF5 expression. This implies a potential therapeutic target through the interference interaction of PHGDH-RNF5 to degrade PHGDH in breast cancer.

Abstract: Summary
APC mutation activation of Wnt/β-catenin drives initiation of colorectal carcinogenesis (CRC). Additional factors potentiate β-catenin activation to promote CRC. Western diets are enriched in linoleic acid (LA); LA-enriched diets promote chemically induced CRC in rodents. 15-Lipoxygenase-1 (15-LOX-1), the main LA-metabolizing enzyme, is transcriptionally silenced during CRC. Whether LA and 15-LOX-1 affect Wnt/β-catenin signaling is unclear. We report that high dietary LA promotes CRC in mice treated with azoxymethane or with an intestinally targeted Apc mutation (ApcΔ580) by upregulating Wnt receptor LRP5 protein expression and β-catenin activation. 15-LOX-1 transgenic expression in mouse intestinal epithelial cells suppresses LRP5 protein expression, β-catenin activation, and CRC. 15-LOX-1 peroxidation of LA in phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphates (PI3P_LA) leads to PI3P_13-HODE formation, which decreases PI3P binding to SNX17 and LRP5 and inhibits LRP5 recycling from endosomes to the plasma membrane, thereby increasing LRP5 lysosomal degradation. This regulatory mechanism of LRP5/Wnt/β-catenin signaling could be therapeutically targeted to suppress CRC.

Abstract: Summary
Plant somatic embryogenesis refers to a phenomenon where embryos develop from somatic cells in the absence of fertilization. Previous studies have revealed that the phytohormone auxin plays a crucial role in somatic embryogenesis by inducing a cell totipotent state, although its underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we show that auxin rapidly rewires the cell totipotency network by altering chromatin accessibility. The analysis of chromatin accessibility dynamics further reveals a hierarchical gene regulatory network underlying somatic embryogenesis. Particularly, we find that the embryonic nature of explants is a prerequisite for somatic cell reprogramming. Upon cell reprogramming, the B3-type totipotent transcription factor LEC2 promotes somatic embryo formation by direct activation of the early embryonic patterning genes WOX2 and WOX3. Our results thus shed light on the molecular mechanism by which auxin promotes the acquisition of plant cell totipotency and establish a direct link between cell totipotent genes and the embryonic development pathway.

Abstract: Summary
How are diverse regulatory strategies integrated to impose appropriately patterned gene expression that underlie in vivo phenotypes? Here, we reveal how coordinated miRNA regulation and neural-specific alternative polyadenylation (APA) of a single locus controls complex behaviors. Our entry was the unexpected observation that deletion of Bithorax complex (BX-C) miRNAs converts virgin female flies into a subjective post-mated behavioral state, normally induced by seminal proteins following copulation. Strikingly, this behavioral switch is directly attributable to misregulation of homothorax (hth). We localize specific CNS abdominal neurons where de-repressed Hth compromises virgin behavior in BX-C miRNA mutants. Moreover, we use genome engineering to demonstrate that precise mutation of hth 3′ UTR sites for BX-C miRNAs or deletion of its neural 3′ UTR extension containing most of these sites both induce post-mated behaviors in virgins. Thus, facilitation of miRNA-mediated repression by neural APA is required for virgin females to execute behaviors appropriate to their internal state.

Abstract: CaV1.2 and transient receptor potential canonical channel 3 (TRPC3) are two proteins known to have important roles in pathological cardiac hypertrophy; however, such roles still remain unclear. A better understanding of these roles is important for furthering the clinical understanding of heart failure. We previously reported that Trpc3-knockout (KO) mice are resistant to pathologic hypertrophy and that their CaV1.2 protein expression is reduced. In this study, we aimed to examine the relationship between these two proteins and characterize their role in neonatal cardiomyocytes. We measured CaV1.2 expression in the hearts of wild-type (WT) and Trpc3−/− mice, and examined the effects of Trpc3 knockdown and overexpression in the rat cell line H9c2. We also compared the hypertrophic responses of neonatal cardiomyocytes cultured from Trpc3−/− mice to a representative hypertrophy-causing drug, isoproterenol (ISO), and measured the activity of nuclear factor of activated T cells 3 (NFAT3) in neonatal cardiomyocytes (NCMCs). We inhibited the L-type current with nifedipine, and measured the intracellular calcium concentration using Fura-2 with 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG)-induced Ba2+ influx. When using the Trpc3-mediated Ca2+ influx, both intracellular calcium concentration and calcium influx were reduced in Trpc3-KO myocytes. Not only was the expression of CaV1.2 greatly reduced in Trpc3-KO cardiac lysate, but the size of the CaV1.2 currents in NCMCs was also greatly reduced. When NCMCs were treated with Trpc3 siRNA, it was confirmed that the expression of CaV1.2 and the intracellular nuclear transfer activity of NFAT decreased. In H9c2 cells, the ISO activated- and verapamil inhibited- Ca2+ influxes were dramatically attenuated by Trpc3 siRNA treatment. In addition, it was confirmed that both the expression of CaV1.2 and the size of H9c2 cells were regulated according to the expression and activation level of TRPC3. We found that after stimulation with ISO, cell hypertrophy occurred in WT myocytes, while the increase in size of Trpc3-KO myocytes was greatly reduced. These results suggest that not only the cell hypertrophy process in neonatal cardiac myocytes and H9c2 cells were regulated according to the expression level of CaV1.2, but also that the expression level of CaV1.2 was regulated by TRPC3 through the activation of NFAT.

Abstract: Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease with a high incidence characterized by irreversible destruction of alveolar bone. This study aimed to investigate the effect of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) on osteogenic differentiation and its molecular mechanism. TNF-α inhibited osteogenic differentiation as revealed by the lower accumulation of osteoblastic genes like runt-related transcription factor (Runx2), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteoprotegerin (OPG), and osteocalcin (OCN). Moreover, TNF-α down-regulated the expressions of LC3II, ATG7, and beclin 1 (BECN1); suggesting that autophagy was inhibited during the process of osteogenic differentiation. Consistently, Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway members such as low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5), β-catenin, and phosphorylated-β-catenin (p-β-catenin) were reduced by TNF-α. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of TNF-α on osteogenic differentiation and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway could be abated by autophagy inducers but exacerbated by autophagy inhibitors. The most intriguing finding of all was that TNF-α inhibited osteoblastic differentiation and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by down-regulating autophagy, and autophagy positively regulated the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and thus influenced osteoblastic differentiation. Our study provides a theoretical basis for autophagy-inducer therapy for the alveolar bone loss caused by periodontitis.

Abstract: Lysosomes are generally thought to be required only for the late stages of phagosome maturation, providing the proton pumps (V-ATPases) and hydrolases needed to acidify and degrade the ingested prey. A recent paper by Davis et al. (EMBO J. [2020], doi:10.15252/embj.2019104058) reports the involvement of lysosomes at a much earlier stage, namely in scission of phagosomes from the plasma membrane. Here we analyze these findings, highlighting a number of unexpected observations and unresolved questions.

Abstract: The imbalance between the proliferation and apoptosis of B-cell precursors is an important contributor to the pathogenesis of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL), while its specific regulatory mechanism remains perplexing. This study aimed to expound the underlying mechanism of the proliferation and apoptosis of BCP-ALL cells from the perspective of non-coding RNA. In this study, long non-coding RNA colorectal neoplasia differentially expressed (LncRNA CRNDE) was upregulated in the bone marrow of BCP-ALL patients and BCP-ALL cell lines (NALM-6 and RS4;11). Functionally, LncRNA CRNDE knockdown restrained cell proliferation and boosted cell apoptosis in NALM-6 and RS4;11 cells. The subsequent investigation confirmed that LncRNA CRNDE bound to miR-345-5p and negatively regulated miR-345-5p expression. The overexpression of miR-345-5p suppressed cell proliferation and boosted cell apoptosis in NALM-6 and RS4;11 cells. Further experiments revealed that miR-345-5p downregulated cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) expression by targeting its mRNA directly. CREB overexpression reversed the effect of miR-345-5p mimic on cell proliferation and apoptosis in NALM-6 and RS4;11 cells. Finally, in vivo experiments showed that LncRNA CRNDE knockdown prolonged the survival of mice xenotransplanted with NALM-6 cells. In conclusion, LncRNA CRNDE upregulated CREB expression by suppressing miR-345-5p, thus promoting cell proliferation and reducing cell apoptosis in BCP-ALL.

Abstract: Summary
Bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) are members of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) cytokine family promoting differentiation, homeostasis, and self-renewal of multiple tissues. We show that signaling through the bone morphogenic protein receptor 1α (BMPR1α) sustains expression of FOXP3 in Treg cells in peripheral lymphoid tissues. BMPR1α signaling promotes molecular circuits supporting acquisition and preservation of Treg cell phenotype and inhibiting differentiation of pro-inflammatory effector Th1/Th17 CD4+ T cell. Mechanistically, increased expression of KDM6B (JMJD3) histone demethylase, an antagonist of the polycomb repressive complex 2, underlies lineage-specific changes of T cell phenotypes associated with abrogation of BMPR1α signaling. These results reveal that BMPs are immunoregulatory cytokines mediating maturation and stability of peripheral FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Treg cells) and controlling generation of iTreg cells. Thus, we establish that BMPs, a large cytokine family, are an essential link between stromal tissues and the adaptive immune system involved in sustaining tissue homeostasis by promoting immunological tolerance.

Abstract: Summary
Intratumoral heterogeneity is associated with aggressive tumor behavior, therapy resistance, and poor patient outcomes. Such heterogeneity is thought to be dynamic, shifting over periods of minutes to hours in response to signaling inputs from the tumor microenvironment. However, models of this process have been inferred from indirect or post-hoc measurements of cell state, leaving the temporal details of signaling-driven heterogeneity undefined. Here, we developed a live-cell model system in which microenvironment-driven signaling dynamics can be directly observed and linked to variation in gene expression. Our analysis reveals that paracrine signaling between two cell types is sufficient to drive continual diversification of gene expression programs. This diversification emerges from systems-level properties of the EGFR-RAS-ERK signaling cascade, including intracellular amplification of amphiregulin-mediated paracrine signals and differential kinetic filtering by target genes including Fra-1, c-Myc, and Egr1. Our data enable more precise modeling of paracrine-driven transcriptional variation as a generator of gene expression heterogeneity. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the Supplemental Information.

Abstract: Summary
DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) are dangerous lesions threatening genomic stability. Fidelity of DSB repair is best achieved by recombination with a homologous template sequence. In yeast, transcript RNA was shown to template DSB repair of DNA. However, molecular pathways of RNA-driven repair processes remain obscure. Utilizing assays of RNA-DNA recombination with and without an induced DSB in yeast DNA, we characterize three forms of RNA-mediated genomic modifications: RNA- and cDNA-templated DSB repair (R-TDR and c-TDR) using an RNA transcript or a DNA copy of the RNA transcript for DSB repair, respectively, and a new mechanism of RNA-templated DNA modification (R-TDM) induced by spontaneous or mutagen-induced breaks. While c-TDR requires reverse transcriptase, translesion DNA polymerase ζ (Pol ζ) plays a major role in R-TDR, and it is essential for R-TDM. This study characterizes mechanisms of RNA-DNA recombination, uncovering a role of Pol ζ in transferring genetic information from transcript RNA to DNA.

Abstract: Changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) produced by ryanodine receptor (RyR) agonist, caffeine (caf), and ionotropic agonists: N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) agonist, NMDA and P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) agonist, 3′-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyl adenosine 5′-triphosphate (BzATP) were measured in cultured mouse cortical astrocytes loaded with the fluorescent calcium indicator Fluo3-AM in a confocal laser scanning microscope. In mouse astrocytes cultured in standard medium (SM), treatment with caf increased [Ca2+]i, with a peak response occurring about 10 min after stimulus application. Peak responses to NMDA or BzATP were observed about <1 min and 4.5 min post stimulus, respectively. Co-treatment with NMDA or BzATP did not alter the peak response to caf in astrocytes cultured in SM, the absence of the effects being most likely due to asynchrony between the response to caf, NMDA and BzATP. Incubation of astrocytes with neuron-condition medium (NCM) for 24 h totally abolished the caf-evoked [Ca2+]i increase. In NCM-treated astrocytes, peak of [Ca2+]i rise evoked by NMDA was delayed to about 3.5 min, and that induced by BzATP occurred about three minutes earlier than in SM. The results show that neurons secrete factors that negatively modulate RyR-mediated Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) in astrocytes and alter the time course of Ca2+ responses to ionotropic stimuli.

Abstract: The effectiveness of stem cell-based periodontal tissue engineering need to be assessed by preclinical animal studies. Dog models are widely used animal models; however, there are not sufficient data on characterization of canine dental mesenchymal stem cells. Therefore, we aimed to compare the characteristics among canine and human periodontal ligament stem cells and canine and human dental pulp stem cells. Canine periodontal ligament stem cells and dental pulp stem cells showed significantly weaker clonogenic capability, and proliferation and migration capacity, and they displayed lower positive rates for CD90, CD73, CD105, and STRO-1. All of these canine and human cells showed multilineage differentiation potential. After osteogenic induction, the expression of alkaline phosphatase was obviously upregulated in human dental mesenchymal stem cells, but it was not upregulated in canine dental pulp stem cells. Other osteogenic genes, such as runt-related transcription factor 2 and bone morphogenetic protein 2, were upregulated in all induced canine and human cells, but their upregulation occurred later in canine cells. These results confirmed the stem cell properties of canine mesenchymal stem cells, but also suggested that more attention should be paid to the choice of appropriate research approaches, osteogenic gene markers, and time points for the utilization of canine dental mesenchymal stem cells due to their distinct characteristics.

Abstract: Summary
Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) have enormous potential for the study of human cardiac disorders. However, their physiological immaturity severely limits their utility as a model system and their adoption for drug discovery. Here, we describe maturation media designed to provide oxidative substrates adapted to the metabolic needs of human iPSC (hiPSC)-CMs. Compared with conventionally cultured hiPSC-CMs, metabolically matured hiPSC-CMs contract with greater force and show an increased reliance on cardiac sodium (Na+) channels and sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium (Ca2+) cycling. The media enhance the function, long-term survival, and sarcomere structures in engineered heart tissues. Use of the maturation media made it possible to reliably model two genetic cardiac diseases: long QT syndrome type 3 due to a mutation in the cardiac Na+ channel SCN5A and dilated cardiomyopathy due to a mutation in the RNA splicing factor RBM20. The maturation media should increase the fidelity of hiPSC-CMs as disease models.

Abstract: Summary
The glycome undergoes characteristic changes during histogenesis and organogenesis, but our understanding of the importance of select glycan structures for tissue formation and homeostasis is incomplete. Here, we present a human organotypic platform that allows genetic dissection of cellular glycosylation capacities and systematic interrogation of the roles of distinct glycan types in tissue formation. We used CRISPR-Cas9 gene targeting to generate a library of 3D organotypic skin tissues that selectively differ in their capacity to produce glycan structures on the main types of N- and O-linked glycoproteins and glycolipids. This tissue library revealed distinct changes in skin formation associated with a loss of features for all tested glycoconjugates. The organotypic skin model provides phenotypic cues for the distinct functions of glycoconjugates and serves as a unique resource for further genetic dissection and identification of the specific structural features involved. The strategy is also applicable to other organotypic tissue models.

Abstract: Summary
Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease that features the death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the retina, often as a result of prolonged increases in intraocular pressure. We show that preventing the formation of neuroinflammatory reactive astrocytes prevents the death of RGCs normally seen in a mouse model of glaucoma. Furthermore, we show that these spared RGCs are electrophysiologically functional and thus still have potential value for the function and regeneration of the retina. Finally, we demonstrate that the death of RGCs depends on a combination of both an injury to the neurons and the presence of reactive astrocytes, suggesting a model that may explain why reactive astrocytes are toxic only in some circumstances. Altogether, these findings highlight reactive astrocytes as drivers of RGC death in a chronic neurodegenerative disease of the eye.

Abstract: Summary
H3K27M diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) are fatal and lack treatments. They mainly harbor H3.3K27M mutations resulting in H3K27me3 reduction. Integrated analysis in H3.3K27M cells, tumors, and in vivo imaging in patients showed enhanced glycolysis, glutaminolysis, and tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolism with high alpha-ketoglutarate (α-KG) production. Glucose and/or glutamine-derived α-KG maintained low H3K27me3 in H3.3K27M cells, and inhibition of key enzymes in glycolysis or glutaminolysis increased H3K27me3, altered chromatin accessibility, and prolonged survival in animal models. Previous studies have shown that mutant isocitrate-dehydrogenase (mIDH)1/2 glioma cells convert α-KG to D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG) to increase H3K27me3. Here, we show that H3K27M and IDH1 mutations are mutually exclusive and experimentally synthetic lethal. Overall, we demonstrate that H3.3K27M and mIDH1 hijack a conserved and critical metabolic pathway in opposing ways to maintain their preferred epigenetic state. Consequently, interruption of this metabolic/epigenetic pathway showed potent efficacy in preclinical models, suggesting key therapeutic targets for much needed treatments.

Abstract: Summary
IRF5 polymorphisms are associated with multiple immune-mediated diseases, including ulcerative colitis. IRF5 contributions are attributed to its role in myeloid lineages. How T cell-intrinsic IRF5 contributes to inflammatory outcomes is not well understood. We identify a previously undefined key role for T cell-intrinsic IRF5. In mice, IRF5 in CD4+ T cells promotes Th1- and Th17-associated cytokines and decreases Th2-associated cytokines. IRF5 is required for the optimal assembly of the TCR-initiated signaling complex and downstream signaling at early times, and at later times binds to promoters of Th1- and Th17-associated transcription factors and cytokines. IRF5 also regulates chemokine receptor-initiated signaling and, in turn, T cell migration. In vivo, IRF5 in CD4+ T cells enhances the severity of experimental colitis. Importantly, human CD4+ T cells from high IRF5-expressing disease-risk genetic carriers demonstrate increased chemokine-induced migration and Th1/Th17 cytokines and reduced Th2-associated and anti-inflammatory cytokines. These data demonstrate key roles for T cell-intrinsic IRF5 in inflammatory outcomes.

Abstract: Summary
mTOR is a serine/threonine kinase and a master regulator of cell growth and proliferation. Raptor, a scaffolding protein that recruits substrates to mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), is known to be phosphorylated during mitosis, but the significance of this phosphorylation remains largely unknown. Here we show that raptor expression and mTORC1 activity are dramatically reduced in cells arrested in mitosis. Expression of a non-phosphorylatable raptor mutant reactivates mTORC1 and significantly reduces cytotoxicity of the mitotic poison Taxol. This effect is mediated via degradation of PDCD4, a tumor suppressor protein that inhibits eIF4A activity and is negatively regulated by the mTORC1/S6K pathway. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of eIF4A is able to enhance the effects of Taxol and restore sensitivity in Taxol-resistant cancer cells. These findings indicate that the mTORC1/S6K/PDCD4/eIF4A axis has a pivotal role in the death versus slippage decision during mitotic arrest and may be exploited clinically to treat tumors resistant to anti-mitotic agents.
