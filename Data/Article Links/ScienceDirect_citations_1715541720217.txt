Abstract: As a new method to improve the light trapping in solar cells, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) has attracted considerable attention because of its unique characteristics. Several studies have been reported on the photocurrent improvement of Si solar cells by surface plasmons, while little research has been done on III–V solar cells. In this work, we performed a systematic study of SPR on GaAs thin film solar cells with different sizes of Ag nanoparticles on the surface. The nanoparticles were fabricated by annealing E-beam evaporated Ag films in a N2 atmosphere. It was found that the surface plasmon resonance wavelength does not undergo a simple red-shift with increasing metal thickness. It depends on the shape of the metal nanoparticles and the interparticle spacing. It is necessary to optimize the particle size to obtain an optimum enhancement throughout the visible spectrum for solar cells. We found that the optimum thickness of the Ag film was 6nm under our experimental conditions. Furthermore, from the calculation based on the external quantum efficiency data, the short circuit current density of a GaAs solar cell with 6nm Ag film after annealing was increased by 14.2% over that of the untreated solar cell.

Abstract: The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a program of cellular development associated with loss of cell–cell contacts, a decreased cell adhesion and substantial morphological changes. Besides its importance for numerous developmental processes, EMT has also been held responsible for the development and progression of tumors and formation of metastases. The influence of the cytokine transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) induced EMT on structure, migration, cytoskeletal dynamics and long-term correlations of the mammalian epithelial cell lines NMuMG, A549 and MDA-MB231 was investigated with time-resolved impedance analysis. The three cell lines show important differences in concentration dependency, cellular morphology and dynamics upon their response to TGF-β1. A549 cells and the non-tumor mouse epithelial cell line NMuMG show a substantial change in morphology mirrored in stepwise changes of their phenotype upon cytokine treatment. Impedance based measurements of micromotility reveal a complex dynamic response to TGF-β1 exposure which leads to a transient increase in fluctuation amplitude and long-term correlation. These changes in fluctuation amplitude are also detectable for MDA-MB231 cells, whereas the long-term correlation remains unvaried. We were able to distinguish three time domains during EMT. Initially, all cell lines display an increase in micromotion lasting 4 to 9h termed transitional state I. This regime is followed by transitional state II lasting approximately 20h, where cellular dynamics are diminished and, in case of the NMuMG cell line, a loss of cell–cell contacts occurs. Finally, the transformation into the mesenchymal-like phenotype occurs 24–30h after exposure to TGF-β1.

Abstract: The multilayer Al/Sb thin films were deposited on quartz glass substrates using magnetron sputtering method and annealed at high temperature to obtain AlSb films. The experimental conditions were optimized to obtain the AlSb single phase. XRD measurements indicate that high-temperature annealing is necessary to form AlSb and is helpful to the grain growth of AlSb polycrystalline. The average grain size of AlSb polycrystalline increases obviously with the increase in annealing temperature when higher than 500°C. The electrical measurements show that the prepared AlSb films are p-type semiconductors with the conductivity activation energy of 0.21 and 0.01eV. The optical band gap for a typical AlSb film is 1.76eV. The obvious photovoltaic effect has been observed in TCO/CdS/AlSb/ZnTe:Cu/Au devices, which demonstrated the potential of AlSb film as the absorber layer in thin film solar cells.

Abstract: We investigate sintering and reorganization of electrochemically etched mesoporous Ge layers. Sintering in nitrogen, forming gas, or argon atmospheres always yields a reorganized and oxidized porous layer. Water-insoluble Ge native oxides produced during etching do not hinder thermal reorganization, but evolve to water soluble oxides during annealing. Reorganized porous layers hence dissolve in subsequent water or HF dips. Sintering in hydrogen atmospheres removes native Ge oxides and prevents oxidation of porous layers. Porous layers with porosities less than 30% exhibit a compact closed surface after sintering, whereas porous layers with porosities exceeding 50% collapse. The porosity decreases linearly in a range of 57%–45% for electrolyte concentrations and in a range of 35–50wt% for a specific resistivity of 0.013Ωcm and an etching current density of 5mAcm−2. We obtain porosities below 30% by using substrate resistivities in the 0.015–0.030Ωcm range, etching current densities below 2.5mAcm−2 and an electrolyte concentration of HF 50wt%.

Abstract: Resveratrol, a polyphenolic compound rich in grapes and red wine, has been reported to protect cells against oxidative damage and cell death by increasing cellular antioxidant/detoxification capacity. Cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for respiratory diseases and oxidative damage is implicated in its pathogenesis. Here we investigated the enhancement of antioxidant capacity by resveratrol and its potential protection against cell death caused by cigarette smoke in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBE1). At concentrations that did not affect cell growth, resveratrol activated Nrf2 signaling and increased the expression of NAD(P)H:quinone reductase-1, heme oxygenase-1, and the catalytic subunit of glutamate cysteine ligase. Surprisingly, instead of protecting against cell death, resveratrol significantly enhanced cigarette smoke extract-induced apoptosis. To define the underlying mechanism, the effect of resveratrol on caspase activity was examined and it was found that resveratrol significantly enhanced cigarette smoke-stimulated caspase activity. In conclusion, results from this study suggest that although resveratrol increased antioxidant and detoxification capacity, it increased rather than protected against cigarette smoke-induced apoptosis.

Abstract: We present the novel use of spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) for the development of a-Si:H solar cell. SE is a very fast and useful tool to measure various optical properties of thin film. In the case of a-Si:H thin film analysis, generally, SE is used to estimate the film thickness, roughness, void fraction, optical constants such as (n,k), and so forth. In this study, optical parameters from SE measurements were analyzed with relation to structural and electrical properties of a-Si:H thin film for solar cell. By analyzing IR absorption spectra and conductivity measurements, it was affirmed that <ε2> and parameter A by Tauc–Lorentz model fitting of SE data are representative parameters qualifying a-Si:H thin film, and that they have close relationships with FF and light induced degradation property of solar cells. Based on the analysis, solar cells that have i-layers with various Eg were optimized. By this research, easier and faster methodology to develop a-Si:H thin film for thin film Si solar cells using SE measurements was established.

Abstract: Solar-grade silicon microparticles have been prepared by a two-stage technique consisting of a combustion process in a SiO2+αMg (α is the mole number of Mg) system in an inert atmosphere and the hydrometallurgical treatment of the combustion product. It has been shown that the refining behavior of the metallic impurities from combustion-synthesized silicon (CS-Si) is better than that of metallic impurities from metallurgical-grade silicon (MG-Si) since CS-Si particles have a unique microporous network structure, which makes the hydrometallurgical treatment process very efficient. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis results indicate that silicon of purity greater than 99.99% can be obtained by the developed technique. The principle of the hydrometallurgical purification of CS-Si is discussed in the context of particle morphology and a comprehensive explanation for porous structure formation is provided.

Abstract: While sputtering has been shown to be capable of depositing aluminum oxide suitable for surface passivation, the mechanisms for this are yet to be firmly established and its potential realized. In this paper, we investigate the relationships between the oxygen in the sputtering process to the resulting composition of the deposited film and the surface passivation obtained. We find that surface passivation is not strongly dependent on the bulk composition of the film. Instead the results indicate that the interfacial silicon oxide layer that forms after annealing between the aluminum oxide film and the silicon is a much more important factor; it is this combined structure of aluminum oxide, silicon oxide and silicon that is crucial for obtaining negative charges and excellent surface passivation.

Abstract: The maximum power temperature coefficients of a-Si modules are negative in indoor measurements, whereas the performance increases with module temperature in outdoor measurements. In order to resolve the discrepancy, we investigate the temperature coefficients of a-Si modules by two different methods corresponding to two different time scales. The results are that the temperature coefficient for a shorter time scale of several hours is negative, although the temperature coefficient for a longer time scale of seasons is positive. These results suggest that the discrepancy in temperature coefficient is partially caused by the effects of thermal annealing and light soaking. Therefore, the history of module temperature and received solar irradiance would be required for the correction of the performance of a-Si modules. In addition, we reveal that the effect of solar spectrum is also a contributory factor in the discrepancy.

Abstract: Shape-stabilized phase change materials (PCMs) composed of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and mesoporous active carbon (AC) were prepared by a blending and impregnating method. Various techniques were carried out to characterize the structural and thermal properties of the composites. Lower phase change temperatures and enthalpies were observed as the weight percentage and molecular weight of PEG was decreased. The crystallinity of PEG in the PCMs decreased with the increase in the AC content. The activation energy of the PEG phase change decreased with higher PEG weight percentages. We conclude that the phase change properties of the PEG/AC PCMs are influenced by the adsorption confinement of the PEG segments from the porous structure of AC and also the interference of AC by acting as an impurity with perfect PEG crystallization.

Abstract: Plastic shading nets are being used extensively in hot and sunny regions to protect plants from intense solar radiation. Different varieties of these nets are commercially available. However, the choice of net to fulfill specific shading requirements often depends on empirical or economic criteria and not on scientific considerations because essential information used to characterize the different types of nets is not available. In order to replace expensive measuring facilities that use artificial lighting to investigate the radiative properties of plastic shading nets, a simple method was presented to investigate these properties under global, diffuse and direct beam solar radiation conditions. Measurements were performed on clear sunny days, (December 28, 2008–February 10, 2009). Nets with colors and shading factors that are most commonly used in hot regions were selected for the study. The results showed that the behaviors of the plastic nets under solar radiation conditions were similar to those of translucent materials. Accordingly, it is possible to (i) treat plastic nets as translucent materials and (ii) investigate the equivalent optical constants (i.e., refractive indexes and extinction coefficients) for plastic nets as functions of the net solidity, texture type and color. Solidity and color of the net had significant effects on the radiative properties and the effect of color was much more than the effect of solidity. The shading factor of a plastic net, is a function of the daytime, depends on several design and meteorological parameters, so it cannot be used to describe a net. However, the net solidity together with color, and the daily integrals of the shading factor and of the radiative properties are appropriate parameters for describing a net.

Abstract: This paper describes the development status of high-efficiency heterojunction with intrinsic thin-layer (HIT) solar cells at SANYO Electric. Presently, the conversion efficiency of our standard HIT solar cell has reached a level of 23.0% for a practical size of (100.4cm2) substrate. On the other hand, we have developed special technologies for effectively using thinner substrates for HIT solar cells. Surprisingly, we have achieved a quite high open circuit voltage (Voc) of 743mV, and a high conversion efficiency of 22.8% using only a 98-μm-thick substrate. A 98-μm-thick cell also exhibits a good temperature coefficient, and allows the thickness of the substrate to be reduced by more than 50% while maintaining its efficiency. These results suggest that the HIT solar cell has the potential to further improve cost-performance.

Abstract: We have developed zinc oxide (ZnO) film and CO2 plasma treatment for the use as an intermediate layer between top and bottom cell in order to improve performance of micromorph silicon solar cells. The CO2 plasma treatment was performed by very high frequency plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (VHF PECVD) technique, and the ZnO interface layer was deposited by DC-magnetron sputtering method. Effects of both techniques on the cell performance were comparatively investigated. We found that the ZnO interface layer and CO2 plasma treatment were effective in enhancing Voc, Jsc as well as FF of the cells as the same. The micromorph solar cells using an optimized ZnO interface layer and the CO2 plasma treatment indicated initial conversion efficiency of 11.4% and 11.2%, respectively. Experimental results indicated that the CO2 plasma treatment technique is more suitable for using in cell fabrication process than the ZnO interface layer since it is simpler and has no negative impact of possible shunts.

Abstract: A simple and low-cost method for analyzing amorphous silicon solar cells and modules, which have low values of the fill factor (FF), is proposed. Low fill factors can occur mainly because of 3 reasons: (a) excessive recombination due to “bad” intrinsic layers; (b) shunts and (c) very high series resistance. The method described here allows one to discriminate between (a), (b) and (c). It consists of measuring the J–V curves at different light intensities, varying typically from 0.05 to 1 sun. It has been called the “variable intensity method (VIM)”. Here, one plots Rsc=∂V/∂J (at V=0) and Roc=∂V/∂J (at J=0) as a function of Jsc. From the slope of the Rsc–Jsc curve, one derives the “collection voltage Vcoll”; from the asymptotic value of Rsc for low values of Jsc (<0.1mA/cm2) one obtains the “true” shunt resistance Rshunt; from the asymptotic value of Roc for high values of Jsc (around 10mA/cm2) one obtains the “true” series resistance Rseries. This paper shows quantitatively how too low values of Vcoll and of Rshunt as well as how too high a value of Rseries lead to a low value of FF for both cells and panels/modules.

Abstract: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) replicates by the reverse transcription of the viral 3.5kb pregenomic RNA. Therefore the level of expression of this transcript in the liver is a primary determinant of HBV biosynthesis. In vivo neonatal transcription of the HBV 3.5kb pregenomic RNA is developmental regulated by hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α). In addition, viral biosynthesis in non-hepatoma cells can be supported directly by this nuclear receptor. However HBV transcription and replication can be supported by additional nuclear receptors including the retinoid X receptor α/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (RXRα/PPARα), retinoid X receptor α/farnesoid X receptor α (RXRα/FXRα), liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH1) and estrogen-related receptors (ERR) in non-hepatoma cells. Therefore during neonatal liver development, HNF4α may progressively activate viral transcription and replication by binding directly to the proximal HNF4α recognition sequence within the nucleocapsid promoter. Alternatively, HNF4α may support viral biosynthesis in vivo indirectly by activating a network of liver-enriched nuclear receptors that, in combination, direct HBV 3.5kb pregenomic RNA transcription and replication.

Abstract: Estrogen is known for its positive stimulatory effects on surfactant proteins. ErbB4 receptor and its ligand neuregulin (NRG) positively stimulate lung development. ErbB receptors interact with nuclear receptors and ErbB4 co-regulates estrogen receptor (ER)α expression in breast cells. ERβ is highly expressed in pneumocytes and its deletion leads to fewer alveoli and reduced elastic recoil. A similar picture was seen in ErbB4-deleted lungs. We hypothesized that estrogen signals its effect on surfactant protein B (Sftpb) expression through interactions of ERβ and ErbB4. Estrogen and NRG treatment decreased cell numbers and stimulated Sftpb expression in type II cells. Estrogen and NRG both stimulated phosphorylation of ERβ and co-localization of both receptors. Overexpression of ERβ increased the cell number and Sftpb expression, which was further augmented by estrogen and NRG. Finally, estrogen and NRG stimulated ERβ and ErbB4 binding to the Sftpb promoter. Overexpression of these receptors stimulated Sftpb promoter activation, which was further enhanced by estrogen and NRG. The stimulatory effect of estrogen and NRG was abolished in ErbB4 deletion and reconstituted by re-expression of full-length ErbB4 in fetal ErbB4-deleted type II cells. Estrogen-induced nuclear translocation of ErbB4 required the intact γ-secretase cleavage site but not the nuclear localization sequence of the ErbB4 receptor, suggesting that ERβ might function as a nuclear chaperone for ErbB4. These studies demonstrate that estrogen effects on Sftpb expression require an interaction of ERβ and ErbB4. We speculate that the stimulatory effects of estrogen on Sftpb are under transcriptional control of ErbB4.

Abstract: A conducting polymer composite, poly(3-octylthiophene)/cadmium sulfide (POT/CdS) was first synthesized. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) depict the morphology of the samples, defining that CdS was successfully coated by poly(3-octylthiophene) molecules. X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and infrared spectroscopy (IR) show that there is a chemical interaction in the composite. The energy gap of the POT/CdS composite is lower at 0.824eV, which also shows that the optical performance of the new material is far superior to POT or CdS separately, by ultraviolet–visible spectra (UV–vis). Solar cell was sensitized by POT/CdS. A solar-to-electric energy conversion efficiency of 0.581% was attained with the system. The results show that POT/CdS nanocomposites are promising materials with excellent performance characteristics in photoelectric applications.

Abstract: We have developed a simple and reproducible 2-step self-assembly method for the fabrication of broadband, omnidirectional antireflection coating on glass substrate with 4in. size. The glass surface has been modified to be positively charged, then the negatively charged nano silica is self-assembled to the glass substrate by electrostatic attraction. The nanostructure on the glass substrate reduces the reflection significantly, which results in enhanced transmittance. Transmittance as high as 97.7% at 499nm has been obtained for a double-side coated glass substrate. Obvious reduction in weighted reflectance is still observed up to 60° incident angle.

Abstract: New ruthenium(II)–polypyridyl complexes 1a (X=H) and 1b (X=Cl) having 2,6-bis(4-carboxyquinolin-2-yl)pyridine derivatives were synthesized as a sensitizer for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), and their photophysical and photochemical properties were characterized. Both of the complexes showed broad electronic absorption bands in the near-IR region, which were assigned to the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transitions. On the other hand, the photovoltaic performance of the DSCs sensitized with them were different from each other. The DSC sensitized with 1a exhibited higher IPCE value than that of the one sensitized with 1b. The substituent effects on the ligand on photovoltaic performance of the DSCs were examined.

Abstract: In this work, we analyze the effect of rough ZnO front electrodes developed in-house favoring high current versus “smoother” substrates favoring good Voc and FF on the properties of microcrystalline silicon (μc-Si:H) cells. Complete μc-Si:H p-i-n solar cells with intrinsic layer thicknesses varying from 1 to 6μm were deposited using very high frequency plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. The better scattering capabilities of rough substrates induce a significantly higher cell current in comparison to the smooth one for all the thicknesses. This allows a current output of more than 27mAcm−2 for cells thicker than 4μm. As a result, there is no full compensation of poor light scattering by thickness increase up to 6μm in μc-Si:H solar cells. Concerning the electrical characteristics, good quality cells are obtained for all thicknesses on smooth substrates, whereas the thick cells on rough substrates exhibit poorer electrical characteristics. Cells grown on smooth substrates show excellent stability under light soaking and atmospheric storage for all the thicknesses. However, a high increase of the saturation current is evidenced after atmospheric storage for cells grown on rough substrates and thus a degradation of their electrical characteristics is observed.

Abstract: Silicon wafer thickness reduction without increasing the wafer strength leads to a high breakage rate during subsequent handling and processing steps. Cracking of solar cells has become one of the major sources of solar module failure and rejection. Hence, it is important to evaluate the mechanical strength of solar cells and influencing factors. The purpose of this work is to understand the fracture behavior of silicon solar cells and to provide information regarding the bending strength of the cells. Triple junctions, grain size and grain boundaries are considered to investigate the effect of crystallinity features on silicon wafer strength. Significant changes in fracture strength are found as a result of metallization morphology and crystallinity of silicon solar cells. It is observed that aluminum paste type influences the strength of the solar cells.

Abstract: Monodisperse, indium doped zinc oxide (IZO) nanoparticles were prepared via the polyol-mediated synthesis and incorporated into regular and inverted poly-(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) and [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester organic photovoltaic devices as buffer layers between the active layer and the cathode. Efficient hole blocking at the particle buffer layers leads to an enhanced open-circuit voltage of the solar cells. This effect is even more pronounced for inverted device architectures. Device degradation studies revealed a solar cell performance reduction upon sample exposition to ambient atmosphere. However, this degradation is fully reversible under UV illumination. In addition, the n-doped IZO particles form suitable charge carrier transport layers for an efficient recombination in an intermediate recombination zone in tandem solar cells. Accordingly we have fabricated fully solution-processed tandem solar cells and investigated their optoelectronic properties.

Abstract: Copper-stimulated P-type ATPases are essential in the fine-tuning of intracellular copper. In the present work we characterized a copper-dependent ATPase hydrolysis in a native Golgi-enriched preparation from liver and investigated its modulation by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). The very high-affinity Atp7b copper pump presented here shows a K0.5 for free copper of 2.5×10−17M in bathocuproine disulfonate/copper buffer and ATP hydrolysis was inhibited 50% upon stimulation of PKA pathway, using forskolin, cAMP or cholera toxin. Incubation with PKA inhibitor (PKAi5–24 peptide) raises Cu(I)-ATPase activity by 50%. Addition of purified PKA α-catalytic subunit increases K0.5 for free copper (6.2×10−17M) without modification in the affinity for ATP in the low-affinity range of the substrate curve (∼1mM). The Hill coefficient for free copper activation also remains unchanged if exogenous PKA is added (2.7 and 2.3 in the absence and presence of PKA, respectively). The results demonstrate that this high-affinity copper pump in its natural environment is a target of the liver PKA pathway, being regulatory phosphorylation able to influence both turnover rate and ion affinity.

Abstract: We studied the performance improvement of HIT solar cells by optimizing H2 plasma exposure and deposition of thin a-S:H layer on c-Si. With increasing H2 treatment time, the VOC increases until 80s and then decreases, indicating the optimum time is 80s. It is found that the cell performance is almost the same with and without a thin a-Si:H layer when 80s plasma is treated on the c-Si before i-layer deposition. The conversion efficiency of 14.04% was achieved at the substrate temperature of 160°C.

Abstract: Scavenger Receptor B1 has been shown to play a prominent role in the uptake and delivery of vitamin E from HDL and is likely involved in regulating vitamin E in the lung. We have previously demonstrated that lung Scavenger Receptor B1 levels (protein and mRNA) are modulated by cigarette smoke in mice and this was accompanied by changes in lung vitamin E. To further characterize the molecular mechanism(s) involved in this process, human alveolar epitheliall cells were exposed to cigarette smoke and Scavenger Receptor B1 cellular levels and distribution were assessed. Results demonstrated that Scavenger Receptor B1 localizes in patches on the cellular membrane and in the perinuclear area of control cells. Upon cigarette smoke exposure, Scavenger Receptor B1 first translocated to the cell surface (within the first 12h of exposure) and then cell levels (protein and mRNA levels) decreased significantly at 24h. This decline was accompanied by increased Scavenger Receptor B1 ubiquitination which may explain the decrease in the protein levels. Cigarette smoke induced changes in both sub-cellular redistribution and ubiquitination of Scavenger Receptor B1 together with our previous in vivo data provides evidence that cigarette smoke exposure may alter lung's ability to control its tocopherol levels.

Abstract: We study microcrystalline germanium (μc-Ge) film as narrow gap semiconductor materials for infrared absorbers by reactive sputtering with inert gas/mixtures. H2 mixed with Ne, Ar and Xe was used as sputtering gases, in order to research effects of the ion damage. A higher deposition rate is obtained by using inert gases with a larger mass. But the crystallinity becomes lower by the damage due to larger mass ions. In the Ar/H2 mixtures, the structure changes from crystalline to amorphous with increase in the Ar/H2 flow rate ratio. The damage of Xe ion is too large to crystallize the films, but the influence of Ne on the crystallinity is not significant. The photo-sensitivity is obtained in the mixed structures between crystalline and amorphous given by proper ion damages. The amorphous parts probably contribute suppression of the grain-boundary defects. The observation of photo-sensitivity indicates the possibility of μc-Ge as a narrow gap material for PV cells.

Abstract: This work presents results from a study carried out on the Mo/CuInS2/ZnS stacked layers, using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). This system will be used later for the fabrication of solar cells with Mo/CuInS2/ZnS/TCO structure, where the layers conforming it will perform as an electrical contact, absorber layer and buffer layer, respectively. The layers of the Mo/CuInS2/ZnS system were deposited sequentially on soda lime glass substrates. The Mo film was deposited by DC magnetron sputtering, the CuInS2 (CIS) layer was grown by co-evaporation of precursors in a two-stage process and the ZnS was deposited by co-evaporation and by CBD (chemical bath deposition) using a solution containing zinc acetate, sodium citrate, ammonia and thiourea.The performed study provided significant information regarding crystalline structure, grain boundaries and defects visualization of each one of the layers as well as of the Mo/CuInS2 and CuInS2/ZnS interfaces.

Abstract: We report the fabrication of long-lived polymer solar cells using a new donor–acceptor type alternating copolymer, poly(5,5,10,10-tetrakis(2-ethylhexyl)-5,10-dihydroindeno[2,1-α]indene-2,7-diyl)-co-4,7-di-2-thienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (PININE–DTBT) in bulk heterojunction composites with the fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl C70-butyricacidmethyl ester (PC70BM). The PININE–DTBT:PC70BM solar cells exhibit an extended device lifetime (as compared with other polymer systems) with a reasonable power conversion efficiency of ∼2.7% under air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G) irradiation of 100mW/cm2. The long-lived feature of the devices originates from the photo-oxidation resistant backbone unit and the deep HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) level of PININE–DTBT.

Abstract: Replacing the passivation layer of Si3N4 with ITO/SiOx coupled materials on the homogeneity Cz–Si based p–n junction has been fabricated by using normal device processing, and a larger short-circuit current density (49.73mA/cm2) is obtained for this SINP architecture (semiconductor–insulator–n/p junction). The higher short-circuit current density, the mediate open-circuit voltage and filled factor may arise from an equivalent resistance of the device system. A distinct shift of the spectral response and responsivity to ultraviolet and blue wavelength was found for the shallow junction SINP cell, which was also manifested by high quantum efficiency in the same wavelength. The prominent response was still mainly assigned to be the contribution from the space charge region and base section of the cell in the experiments.

Abstract: High conversion efficiency for (amorphous/microcrystalline) "micromorph" tandem solar cells requires both a dedicated light management, to keep the absorber layers as thin as possible, and optimized growth conditions of the microcrystalline silicon (μc-Si:H) material. Efficient light trapping is achieved here by use of textured front and back contacts as well as by implementing an intermediate reflecting layer (IRL) between the individual cells of the tandem. This paper discusses the latest developments of IRLs at IMT Neuchâtel: SiOx based for micromorphs on glass and ZnO based IRLs for micromorphs on flexible substrates were successfully incorporated in micromorph tandem cells leading to high, matched, current above 13.8mA/cm2 for p–i–n tandems. In n–i–p configuration, asymmetric intermediate reflectors were employed to achieve currents of up to 12.5mA/cm2. On glass substrates, initial and stabilized efficiencies exceeding 13% and 11%, respectively, were thus obtained on 1cm2 cells, while on plastic foils with imprinted gratings, 11.2% initial and 9.8% stable efficiency could be reached. Recent progress on the development of effective front and back contacts will be described as well.

Abstract: The long-term behaviour of photovoltaic modules governs their economic feasibility. Amorphous silicon devices experience an initial degradation which is partially reversible due to thermal annealing. This degradation is commonly investigated using indoor light-soaking setups, typically leaving the devices open circuited. Alternatively, devices would be placed outdoors and in most cases are left open circuited as well. The outdoor exposure is closer to realistic performance as the devices will experience continuously changing environments as well as seasonal annealing and degradation cycles. However in both cases, the loading is not as it would be in realistic operation, where devices are operating at the maximum power point. The aim of this study is to verify if the practice of keeping modules at Voc is appropriate for outdoor measurements. The differences in the long term behaviour of the devices due to different loading strategies are investigated for open circuit, short circuit, fixed resistor loading, and MPPT. It is investigated for single junctions with more than 1 year outdoor exposure. It is shown that one needs to at least load the modules resistively to achieve realistic degradation rates, as the degradation at Voc overestimates by 23% and at Isc underestimates by 7.69% relative to the MPPT condition.

Abstract: We report analysis about generation data of a 100kW PV system. The system consists of seven polycrystalline silicon arrays and three thin-film arrays. The rated power of each array is 10kW. Thin-film is made of tandem structure comprising amorphous silicon and microcrystalline silicon. For each array, tilt angles are arranged in 10°, 20° or 30°. And directions are facing due south, south–south east 30° and south–south west 30°. We have been analyzing generation data of the system since 2007 to understand the influence of system arrangement. The knowledge we have got until now is below.(a)Seasonal annealing occurs in thin-film arrays because thin-film cells contain amorphous silicon. Thus, theoretically, as for reduction of conversion efficiency in high temperature season, reduction of thin-film arrays is smaller than polycrystalline’s. We analyzed the ratio of seasonal generation energy (kWh) by using measured data of the system. Generation energy ratio in summer of thin-film is larger than polycrystalline’s. This is same trend as the theory.(b)There is a simulated data of solar irradiation that had been calculated by using meteorological data of 30 years. According to this simulated data, optimum condition of the system is arranged in tilt angle of 28.4° and facing due south. (The system is situated at latitude 33° north.) And simulation data shows that yearly irradiation decreases as tilt angle and direction become far from optimum condition. We analyzed yearly generation energy of each array in the system. Each array’s reduction percentages of generated energy from optimum condition were smaller than simulation value.

Abstract: Multi-junction solar cells have the potential to provide higher efficiencies than single junction devices and to reduce the impact of Staebler–Wronski degradation on amorphous silicon (a-Si) devices. They could, therefore, reduce the cost of solar electricity. However, their characterization presents additional challenges over that of single junction devices. Achieving acceptable accuracy of any current–voltage calibration requires correction of the current–voltage data with external quantum efficiency measurements and spectral mismatch calculations. This paper presents voltage-dependent EQE curves for both single junction and double junction a-Si solar cells, along with dispersion curves extracted from these data. In the case of single junction a-Si devices the mismatch factor is known to be voltage-dependent and a similar trend is shown to apply to multi-junction devices as well. However, the error introduced into current–voltage calibrations due to this bias dependence is found to be <1% for spectral mismatch calculations.

Abstract: Silicon nanowire (SiNW) arrays were grown directly on a P type Si substrate, pre-deposited with gold catalyst, and then made into solar cell for photovoltaic characteristic measurement. Different growth conditions of SiNWs, including variation of the flow rate ratio of SiH4 versus N2, and the thickness of Au film, which can be sputtered into different size of nanoparticles, will be made in order to obtain an optimum photovoltaic conversion efficiency. The morphologies and crystalline structure of the nanowires are studied by SEM, TEM and XRD. The SiNW array surface is shown to have good antireflection property, and is expected to raise light absorption and short circuit current. The photovoltaic performance of the solar cells with SiNWs grown at different conditions is measured and discussed. More effort is still needed to raise the performance of SiNW solar cells.

Abstract: The transparent inter-electrodes with the p/n heterojunction consisting of the solution-processible ZnO nanoparticles as the n-type and the conventional hole injection layers (MoO3 or PEDOT:PSS) as the p-type materials are studied for developing tandem organic solar cells employing different band gap active materials (i.e., P3HT:PCBM blend layer for larger band gap material in the bottom cell and ZnPc/C60 bilayer for smaller band gap material in the top cell). For the ZnO/PEDOT:PSS inter-electrode, the VOC corresponding to the sum of VOC’s of the top and bottom unit cells is obtained, denoting that the two unit cells are successfully connected in series. For the ZnO/MoO3 inter-electrode, the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the tandem cell is smaller than the sum of VOC’s of the top and bottom unit cells, but it can be increased by inserting a very thin Al layer (∼3nm) between ZnO and MoO3 (ZnO/Al/MoO3) as the recombination center for carriers.

Abstract: CdTe thin films were deposited by CSS at a pressure of 1mbar, under different mixtures of argon and oxygen and in vacuum, on glass substrates. The samples were prepared under three source–substrate temperature conditions. The films were characterized by X-ray diffraction, UV–vis spectroscopy, SEM and two-probe resistivity. XRD patterns indicated that the films grown at low oxygen content and source temperature of 550°C with substrate temperature of 400°C showed a high preferential orientation in the (111) plane. The crystalline grain size was between 31 and 40nm. The films had a direct band gap in the range 1.44–1.49eV. SEM images showed higher aggregate sizes for the films deposited at higher temperatures and grain size decreases as oxygen content increases. The resistivity of the films was around 1×106Ωcm.

CITED2 controls the hypoxic signaling by snatching p300 from the two distinct activation domains of HIF-1α,

Abstract: HIF-1α plays a central role in cellular adaptation to hypoxia, and is closely related to the pathogeneses of life-threatening disorders. HIF-1α induces the expressions of numerous hypoxia-induced genes through two transactivation domains; N-terminal TAD (NAD) and C-terminal TAD (CAD). Furthermore, p300 is known to boost CAD-dependent transactivation, and CBP/p300-interacting transactivator with an ED-rich tail 2 (CITED2) inhibits HIF-1α-driven gene expression by interfering with the interaction between CAD and p300. However, few researches have focused on the role of CITED2 in the regulation of NAD activity, and thus, we addressed this point. CITED2 was found to attenuate the hypoxic activations of NAD-dependent and CAD-dependent genes, suggesting that CITED2 negatively regulates both CAD and NAD. Immunoprecipitation analyses showed that NAD interacts with the Cystein/Histidine region (CH) 1 and CH3 domains of p300. Moreover, CH1 and CH3 both were required for NAD-dependent transactivation. Furthermore, CITED2 was found to inactivate NAD by interfering with NAD binding to CH1, but not to CH3. These results indicate that CITED2 inactivates HIF-1α by blocking p300 recruitment by both NAD and CAD. We also found that pVHL inhibits NAD activity regardless of NAD degradation by blocking the interaction between p300 and NAD. Summarizing, NAD was activated by binding to p300, and this was blocked by either CITED2 or pVHL. We propose that pVHL controls NAD during normoxia and that CITED2 controls NAD during hypoxia. Our results provide a new strategy for controlling HIF-1α.

Abstract: Al doped ZnO (AZO) film was continuously deposited on ITO precursor on glass substrate by d.c. magnetron sputtering. The thickness of ITO was varied from 30 to 120nm in order to investigate the effect of ITO thickness on crystallinity of AZO film. X-ray diffraction measurement shows that AZO film grown on ITO has an enhanced (00 2) preferred orientation as the ITO thickness was increased. The crystalline structure improvement of AZO film with an increase of ITO precursor thickness is due to the near-epitaxial growth of AZO on ITO precursor. As the ITO thickness was increased, mobility of AZO film by the Hall measurement was significantly increased from 5.4cm2/Vs (no ITO) to 23.6cm2/Vs (ITO 120nm), and resistivity was about 81.7% improved from 1.99×10−3 to 3.63×10−4Ωcm. The AZO films with ITO revealed excellent average transmission of visible (90.0%) and NIR (89.6%) regions, whereas those of AZO film without ITO were 82.1% and 88.1%, respectively. The haze values of AZO film with ITO of 90 and 120 nm are similar or higher than those of AZO film without ITO. The surface textured AZO film with ITO precursor is promising for optoelectronic applications such as the front TCO of thin film solar cells.

Abstract: We demonstrated a counter electrode in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) using the graphene-based multi-walled carbon nanotubes (GMWNTs) structure. Graphene layers were prepared by drop casting on a SiO2/Si substrate and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) were synthesized on graphene layers using iron catalyst by chemical vapor deposition. The structural properties of GMWNTs were investigated by transmission electron microscope and field-emission scanning electron microscopy. The GMWNTs sheets were lifted off from the Si substrate by buffered oxide etching and were transplanted on fluorine-doped tin oxide glass by Van der Waals force as a counter electrode. From the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and energy conversion efficiencies, electrochemical properties of GMWNTs were comparable with those of MWNTs counter electrode. The results suggested that GMWNTs were one of the candidates for a counter electrode for dye-sensitized solar cells.

Abstract: Tapered aluminum-doped vertical zinc oxide nanorod arrays have been prepared by using simple electrodeposition at 75°C from an aqueous solution of zinc nitrate and aluminum nitrate. Two substrates were used, i.e., copper indium gallium (di)selenide solar cells and a solar thermal absorber. The resulting nanorod arrays were of high optical quality, indicting their applicability as a light coupling layer via a moth-eye effect by means of the subwavelength structure. The weighted global reflectance of the substrates’ surface is decreased after coating it with the light coupling layer. The coating layer boosts the solar cells’ short-circuit current without an obvious effect on their open-circuit voltage and changes the solar thermal absorber layer to a novel solar selective surface. The studies show that the aluminum-doped vertical zinc oxide nanorod arrays are an excellent light coupling element for both solar cell antireflective coating and solar thermal selective surfaces.

Abstract: This study focuses on the optimal configuration and suitable flow rate in photovoltaic thermal (PV/T) system. Design and verification were carried out by finite element method (FEM) to solve computational fluid dynamic (CFD) problem and to determine the suitable flow in a collector system. COMSOL MULTIPHYSICS® software was used for the analysis. The computed results were then comparatively evaluated against a set of result samples obtained from testing data of the 16 modules of PV/T system—a configuration with 4 strings (horizontal-axis) of 4 modules in-series (vertical-axis) (4×4). The redesign of PV/T system was further studied by changing the system configuration from a 4×4 configuration to simulate various configurations consisting of 8×2, 3×4, 4×3 and 6×2. For the same number of PV/T module (16), the 4×4 configuration provided better flow distribution, when compared with an 8×2 configuration. When decreasing to 12 modules, it was shown that the 3×4 configuration resulted in the most suitable flow distribution, compared with the 4×3 and 6×2 configurations. From these results, it can be concluded that the number of strings used was inversely proportional to the flow distribution quality. Experimental results have also shown that the optimized flow rate for the 4×4 configuration was approximately 1–3L/min.

Abstract: The effects of incorporation of aluminum nitride (AlN) in the gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) of a quasi-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) were studied in terms of performance of the cell. The electrolyte, consisting of lithium iodide (LiI), iodine (I2), and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN), was solidified with poly(vinyidene fluoride-co-hexafluoro propylene) (PVDF-HFP). The 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5wt% of AlN were added to the electrolyte for this study. XRD analysis showed a reduction of crystallinity in the polymer PVDF-HFP for all the additions of AlN. The DSSC fabricated with a GPE containing 0.1wt% AlN showed a short-circuit current density (JSC) and power-conversion efficiency (η) of 12.92±0.54mA/cm2 and 5.27±0.23%, respectively, at 100mW/cm2 illumination, in contrast to the corresponding values of 11.52±0.21mA/cm2 and 4.75±0.08% for a cell without AlN. The increases both in JSC and in η of the promoted DSSC are attributed to the higher apparent diffusion coefficient of I− in its electrolyte (3.52×10−6cm2/s), compared to that in the electrolyte without AlN of a DSSC (2.97×10−6cm2/s). At-rest stability of the quasi-solid-state DSSC with 0.1wt% of AlN was found to decrease hardly by 5% and 7% at room temperature and at 40°C, respectively, after 1000h duration. The DSSC with a liquid electrolyte showed a decrease of about 40% at room temperature, while it virtually lost its performance in about 150h at 40°C. Explanations are further substantiated by means of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and by porosity measurements.

Abstract: Highly ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays fabricated by anodization are very attractive to dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) due to their superior charge percolation and slower charge recombination. However, the efficiency of TiO2-nanotube-based DSCs is 6.89%, which is still lower than that of TiO2-nanoparticle-based DSCs. We have suggested the transplanting the highly ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays to FTO glass to improve the performance of TiO2-nanotube-based DSCs. DSCs based on transplanted TiO2 nanotube arrays and TiO2 nanoparticles were fabricated by same process and materials to exclude the unexpected factors. In TiO2 thickness of ca. 15μm, the efficiency of 2.91% in front-side illuminated DSCs based on TiO2 nanotube arrays was higher than those in back-side illuminated DSCs based on TiO2 nanotube arrays and in front-side illuminated DSCs based on TiO2 nanoparticle. Front-side illuminated DSCs based on TiO2 nanotube arrays having various thicknesses were successfully fabricated. The efficiency in DSCs having 20.0μm thick TiO2 nanotube arrays was improved to 5.36% by TiCl4 treatment.

Abstract: Solar cells, especially thin film solar cells, utilize rough surfaces actively in order to improve light trapping efficiency. In this study, we propose a new optical simulation method, which is capable of taking into consideration the realistic surface and interface morphology. The proposed simulation algorithm is based upon a non-sequential ray tracing technique, and direct calculation of the optical absorption energy is performed by separating the light passing through medium into the coherent part and the incoherent part in the course of non-sequential ray tracing throughout the whole region of solar cell structure. It was shown that the new method can give more accurate estimation of the absolute absorption energy in the individual layer when applied for a thin film Si solar cell structure with rough surface of bidirectional scattering distribution function. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm was proved to be very effective in analyzing solar cells with complex geometry like concentrator photovoltaic system, which necessitates the combination of coherent and incoherent calculation.

Abstract: Wnt/β-catenin signaling is known for its role in embryogenesis as well as carcinogenesis. In the liver, it plays many critical roles during hepatic development and regeneration, and its dysregulation is evident in aberrant hepatic growth during various liver tumors. Its chief cellular roles in the liver include regulation of processes of cell proliferation, apoptosis, oxidative stress and differentiation, which in turn contributes to hepatic growth, zonation, xenobiotic metabolism and other metabolic processes inherent to the liver. Most of these functions of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling are dictated through the highly temporal and tissue-specific or non-specific transcriptional targets of the pathway. In addition, some of the critical functions such as cell–cell adhesion and perhaps maintenance of various junctions that are critical from an epithelial cell biology perspective are also a function of β-catenin, which is the central component of the canonical Wnt pathway. Various animal models and clinical studies have demonstrated the spectra of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in liver health and disease. Thus therapeutic modulation of this pathway for improved hepatic health is inevitable in the future. The current review discusses the advances in our understanding of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling in liver physiology and pathology especially in hepatic metabolism and various tumors in adult liver and goes on to extrapolate the pre-clinical significance and possible translational implications of such findings.

Abstract: Printing and spray technologies are the most recent and novel approaches to form organic photovoltaics (OPV) with inexpensive, high speed, and environmentally friendly process. With an electrohydrodynamic atomization (EHDA) approach, the active layer composed of polymer mixture (P3HT:PCBM) was successively fabricated. Operating conditions for obtaining the stable cone jet mode were determined with various applied voltages and liquid feed flow rates. The size distribution of EHDA droplets was characterized by aerodynamic particle sizer (APS) measurement. The mode diameters of the droplets were 580 and 670nm, respectively, when the liquid flow rates were 1 and 20μl/min. The maximum power conversion efficiency of 0.48% was obtained under AM 1.5 solar simulation for an OPV device fabricated in air.

Abstract: We posit the following hypothesis: Independently of whether malignant tumors are initiated by a fundamental reprogramming of gene expression or seeded by stem cells, “waves” of gene expression that promote metabolic changes occur during carcinogenesis, beginning with oncogene-mediated changes, followed by hypoxia-induced factor (HIF)-mediated gene expression, both resulting in the highly glycolytic “Warburg” phenotype and suppression of mitochondrial biogenesis. Because high proliferation rates in malignancies cause aglycemia and nutrient shortage, the third (second oncogene) “wave” of adaptation stimulates glutaminolysis, which in certain cases partially re-establishes oxidative phosphorylation; this involves the LKB1-AMPK-p53, PI3K-Akt-mTOR axes and MYC dysregulation. Oxidative glutaminolysis serves as an alternative pathway compensating for cellular ATP. Together with anoxic glutaminolysis it provides pyruvate, lactate, and the NADPH pool (alternatively to pentose phosphate pathway). Retrograde signaling from revitalized mitochondria might constitute the fourth “wave” of gene reprogramming. In turn, upon reversal of the two Krebs cycle enzymes, glutaminolysis may partially (transiently) function even during anoxia, thereby further promoting malignancy. The history of the carcinogenic process within each malignant tumor determines the final metabolic phenotype of the selected surviving cells, resulting in distinct cancer bioenergetic phenotypes ranging from the highly glycolytic “classic Warburg” to partial or enhanced oxidative phosphorylation. We discuss the bioenergetically relevant functions of oncogenes, the involvement of mitochondrial biogenesis/degradation in carcinogenesis, the yet unexplained Crabtree effect of instant glucose blockade of respiration, and metabolic signaling stemming from the accumulation of succinate, fumarate, pyruvate, lactate, and oxoglutarate by interfering with prolyl hydroxylase domain enzyme-mediated hydroxylation of HIFα prolines.

Abstract: The amorphous incubation layer, which is formed in the initial growth stage of hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon (μc-Si:H) thin film deposited at low temperature, is harmful to the electric properties of film. In this study, the effect of the addition of HCl gas on the reduction of such an amorphous incubation layer was investigated during the silicon deposition on a glass substrate at 220°C by hot-wire chemical vapor deposition process using the Raman spectroscopy, the X-ray diffraction and the field-emission scanning electron microscopy. In the initial stage of deposition where the silicon film deposited without HCl addition consisted almost entirely of the amorphous incubation layer; highly crystalline silicon films could be deposited with HCl addition. As the flow rate of HCl increased, the crystallinity of silicon films increased but the film growth rate decreased. The surface morphology of films prepared with HCl addition became smoother with smaller grain size than that prepared without HCl.

Abstract: Texturing of silicon (Si) wafer surface is a key to enhance light absorption and improve the solar cell performance. While alkaline texturing of single-crystalline Si (sc-Si) wafers was well established, no chemical solution has been successfully developed for multi-crystalline Si (mc-Si) wafers. Reactive-ion-etch (RIE) is a promising technique for effective texturing of both sc-Si and mc-Si wafers, regardless of crystallographic characteristics, and more suitable for thin wafers. However, due to the use of plasma source generated by high power, the wafer surface gets a physical damage during the processing, which requires an additional subsequent damage-removal wet processing. In this work, we developed a damage-free RIE texturing for mc-Si solar cells. An improved self-masking RIE texturing process, developed in this study, produced ∼0.7% absolute efficiency gain on 156×156mm2 mc-Si cells, where the gas ratio and the plasma power density were keys to mitigate the plasma-induced-damage during the RIE processing while maintaining decent surface reflectance. In the self-masking RIE texturing, a mixture of SF6/Cl2/O2 gases was found to significantly affect the surface morphology uniformity and reflectance, where an optimal etch depth was found to be 200–400nm. We achieved Jsc gain of ∼1.3mA/cm2 while maintaining decent FFs of ∼0.78 without a Voc loss after optimization of firing conditions.

Abstract: The photovoltaic (PV) rapid growth suffers the severe shortage of silicon. The metallurgical route to solar grade (SoG) silicon is the alternative solution. One of the methods suggested the fractional melting process. Because the metal impurities in the metallurgical grade (MG) silicon such as Fe, Al, Ti and Cu deteriorate the efficiency of the solar cell seriously, it is important to remove those metal elements from MG-Si to upgrade the silicon. The refining behaviors of the metal impurities, however, do not equal in FM process. Cu and Al behaviors in the Si during FM process are studied using SEM, EPMA and ICP-AES. The diffusion coefficient and the grain boundary (GB) enrichment behaviors of the elements are rationalized to cause the difference.

Abstract: The chemical stability of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) determines both the cell performance and the cell life-time. The presence of water in the solar cell from surrounding leakage through the imperfection packaging sealants causes the decrease in life-time of photogenerated electrons on the working electrodes, which induces the occurrence of the dark current to the electrolytes and thus leakage current significantly deteriorated the life-time of the DSSC. Reliable electrolyte additives diminishing the influences of water to the DSSCs degradation process becomes a critical issue in maintaining an acceptable cell life-time. In this work, the effects of four benzimidazole derivatives a–d as the electrolyte additives in the presence of water were comprehensively examined by time-dependent photovoltaic performance of the cells. As a result, open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), efficiency (η), and fill factor (FF) collected from I–V curves were studied. In addition, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique was implemented to evaluate the effects of the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at the interfaces between TiO2/dye/electrolyte. Results showed that the bis-benzimidazole derivative c gives significant improvement in the long-term stability due to the effective protection of the ligands between dye and working electrodes from the attack by environmental water molecules.

Abstract: The Wnt/β-catenin pathway plays a key role in liver development, regeneration and tumorigenesis. Among human cancers tightly linked to abnormal Wnt/β-catenin signaling, hepatoblastoma (HB) presents with the highest rate (50–90%) of β-catenin mutations. HB is the most common malignant tumor of the liver in childhood. This embryonic tumor differs from hepatocellular carcinoma by the absence of viral etiology and underlying liver disease, and by distinctive morphological patterns evoking hepatoblasts, the bipotent precursors of hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. Recent studies of the molecular pathogenesis of hepatoblastoma have led to identify two major tumor subclasses resembling early and late phases of prenatal liver development and presenting distinctive chromosomal alterations. It has been shown that the molecular signature of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in hepatoblastoma is mainly imposed by liver context, but differs according to developmental stage. Finally, the differentiation stage of tumor cells strongly influences their invasive and metastatic properties, therefore affecting clinical behavior.

Abstract: Human cytomegalovirus utilizes cellular signal transduction pathways to activate viral or cellular transcription factors involved in the control of viral gene expression and DNA replication. In the present study, we demonstrate that Harvey-ras-transformed cells show increased permissiveness to human cytomegalovirus when compared to their parental non-transformed cells. Both the progeny viral yield and the protein levels were elevated in the human cytomegalovirus-infected Harvey-ras-transformed cells requiring active viral gene replication, as shown by the infection with UV-inactivated human cytomegalovirus. Inhibition of Ras or of key molecules of the Ras pathway, effectively suppressed viral infection in the Harvey-ras-transformed cells. On a cellular level, the human cytomegalovirus-infected Harvey-ras-transformed cells formed larger cellular foci, which were significantly higher in number, compared to the uninfected cells and preferentially recruited human cytomegalovirus virions, thereby incriminating human cytomegalovirus infection for the increased transformation of these cells. Furthermore, proliferation assays revealed a higher rate for the human cytomegalovirus-infected Harvey-ras-transformed cells compared to mock-infected cells, whereas human cytomegalovirus infection had no considerable effect on the proliferation of the non-transformed cells. Higher susceptibility to apoptosis was also detected in the human cytomegalovirus-infected ras-transformed cells, which in combination with the higher progeny virus reveals a mode by which human cytomegalovirus achieves efficient spread of infection in the cells expressing the oncogenic Harvey-ras (12V) gene. Collectively, our data suggest that human cytomegalovirus employs the host-cell Ras signaling pathway to ensue viral expression and ultimately successful propagation.

Abstract: The pleiotropic growth factor TGFβ1 promotes many of the pathogenic mechanisms observed in lung fibrosis and airway remodeling, such as aberrant extracellular matrix deposition due to both fibroblast activation and fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation. Serum amyloid P (SAP), a member of the pentraxin family of proteins inhibits bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis through an inhibition of pulmonary fibrocyte and pro-fibrotic alternative (M2) macrophage accumulation. It is unknown if SAP has effects downstream of TGFβ1, a major mediator of pulmonary fibrosis. Using the lung specific TGFβ1 transgenic mouse model, we determined that SAP inhibits all of the pathologies driven by TGFβ1 including apoptosis, airway inflammation, pulmonary fibrocyte accumulation and collagen deposition, without affecting levels of TGFβ1. To explore the role of monocyte derived cells in this model we used liposomal clodronate to deplete pulmonary macrophages. This led to pronounced anti-fibrotic effects that were independent of fibrocyte accumulation. Administration of SAP mirrored these effects and reduced both pulmonary M2 macrophages and increased chemokine IP10/CXCL10 expression in a SMAD 3-independent manner. Interestingly, SAP concentrations were reduced in the circulation of IPF patients and correlated with disease severity. Last, SAP directly inhibited M2 macrophage differentiation of monocytes obtained from these patients. These data suggest that the beneficial anti-fibrotic effects of SAP in TGFβ1-induced lung disease are via modulating monocyte responses.

Abstract: Cell proliferation only proceeds when metabolism is capable of providing a budget of metabolic intermediates that is adequate to ensure both energy regeneration and the synthesis of cell building blocks in sufficient amounts. In tumor cells, the glycolytic pyruvate kinase isoenzyme M2 (PKM2, M2-PK) determines whether glucose is converted to lactate for regeneration of energy (active tetrameric form, Warburg effect) or used for the synthesis of cell building blocks (nearly inactive dimeric form). This review discusses the regulation mechanisms of pyruvate kinase M2 expression by different transcription factors as well as the regulation of pyruvate kinase M2 activity by direct interaction with certain oncoproteins, tyrosine and serine phosphorylation, binding of phosphotyrosine peptides, association with other glycolytic and non glycolytic enzymes, the promyelocytic leukemia tumor suppressor protein, as well as metabolic intermediates. An intervention in the regulation mechanisms of the expression, activity and tetramer to dimer ratio of pyruvate kinase M2 has severe consequences for metabolism as well as proliferation and tumorigenic capacity of the cells which makes this enzyme a promising target for potential therapeutic approaches. The quantification of the dimeric form of pyruvate kinase M2 (Tumor M2-PK) in plasma and stool allows early detection of tumors and therapy control. Several different mechanisms may induce a translocation of pyruvate kinase M2 into the nucleus. The role of pyruvate kinase M2 in the nucleus is complex as witnessed by evidence of its effect both as pro-proliferative as well as pro-apoptotic stimuli.

Abstract: The performance of four ribbons of lead SnAgPb (SAP) and lead-free SnAgCu (SAC) photovoltaic (PV) ribbons in patterned (pat-) and high-conductivity (con-) types soldered on silicon solar cells are investigated by electron characteristics and microstructure analyses. The electrical performances of the solar strings were characterized before and after the soldering process by a solar flasher, and strings with commercial ribbons of lead and lead-free are compared. In general, lead ribbon solar strings show lower power loss value than lead-free counterparts. And the commercial lead and lead-free ribbon strings show highest power loss around 6.66%–10.65% of all the solar strings. Furthermore, the power losses for patterned lead (pat-SAP) and lead-free (pat-SAC) solar string are 3.93% and 5.51%, respectively, implying that a patterned structure should improve the soldering process and result in lower power loss. Yet, significant low output power loss values are detected in the solar strings which are soldered with high-conductivity ribbons. It is estimated that the power loss for high-conductivity lead (con-SAP) and lead-free (con-SAC) solar strings are 3.89% and 4.43%, respectively. And a similar condition was revealed when the solder materials were practically interconnected the solar cells in PV modules. According to the microstructure analyses, the low power loss of con-SAP solar string should be due to the good electrical performance in low series resistance (Rs) and high shunt resistance (Rsh), thus resulting in a high fill factor of the solar device.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells stimulate tumor growth in vivo through a lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-dependent mechanism. However, the molecular mechanism by which mesenchymal stem cells stimulate tumorigenesis is largely elusive. In the present study, we demonstrate that conditioned medium from A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549 CM) induces expression of periostin, an extracellular matrix protein, in human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hASCs). A549 CM-stimulated periostin expression was abrogated by pretreatment of hASCs with the LPA receptor 1 (LPA1) inhibitor Ki16425 or short hairpin RNA-mediated silencing of LPA1, suggesting a key role of the LPA–LPA1 signaling axis in A549 CM-stimulated periostin expression. Using a xenograft transplantation model of A549 cells, we demonstrated that co-injection of hASCs potentiated tumor growth of A549 cells in vivo and that co-transplanted hASCs expressed not only periostin but also α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), a marker of carcinoma-associated fibroblasts. Small interfering RNA- or short hairpin RNA-mediated silencing of periostin resulted in blockade of LPA-induced α-SMA expression in hASCs. In addition, silencing of periostin resulted in blockade of hASC-stimulated growth of A549 xenograft tumors and in vivo differentiation of transplanted hASCs to α-SMA-positive carcinoma-associated fibroblasts. Conditioned medium derived from LPA-treated hASCs (LPA CM) potentiated proliferation and adhesion of A549 cells and short interfering RNA-mediated silencing or immunodepletion of periostin from LPA CM abrogated proliferation and adhesion of A549 cells. These results suggest a pivotal role for hASC-secreted periostin in growth of A549 xenograft tumors within the tumor microenvironment.

Abstract: In this report, non-aggregated anatase TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized by mild solvothermal process in 1-butanol. By varying solvothermal reaction temperature and time, TiO2 particle size was controlled from 5.3 to 9.0nm, while maintaining pure anatase phase and optical clearance in the concentrated dispersion (5wt%). Spin coating of TiO2 dispersions resulted in transparent thin films with thickness controllability, and it was confirmed that the mild solvothermal reaction significantly increased the refractive index of the thin films without post-thermal treatment. In addition to the fabrication of low-temperature processed thin films, the inverse opal TiO2 films were also fabricated by the colloidal templating method followed by thermal calcination to reveal the improved volume shrinkage of the mesoporous TiO2 films.

Cellular iron depletion weakens induction of heme oxygenase-1 by cadmium,

Abstract: Heme oxygenase-1 is an inducible cytoprotective gene, although its induction by environmental factors is not completely understood. This study aimed to ascertain if specific nutritive factors or related compounds influence heme oxygenase-1 expression. In HCT-116 cells, cadmium increased heme oxygenase-1 enzymatic activity. This effect of cadmium was weaker in cells made iron-deficient with the iron chelator, desferrioxamine, which was associated with repression of heme oxygenase-1 protein and mRNA expression. The repression by desferrioxamine of cadmium-induced heme oxygenase-1 upregulation was reversed upon iron replenishment of the cells. Additionally, it was found that thiol antioxidants inhibited the heme oxygenase-1 upregulation caused by cadmium and also by ethacrynic acid, which each decreased intracellular glutathione as did buthionine sulfoxamine. Interestingly, cadmium and ethacrynic acid increased nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and subsequent heme oxygenase-1 expression, but buthionine sulfoxamine did not. Furthermore, NADPH oxidase inhibitors (diphenyleneiodonium and apocynin, and a superoxide scavenger (Tiron) inhibited cadmium-induced upregulation of heme oxygenase-1. Diphenyleneiodonium was the most potent and inhibited NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase as well, whereas apocynin and Tiron did not. It is concluded that adequate amounts of iron, which at the atomic level can serve as the pivotal element of heme in NADPH oxidase, must be present in cells to permit what appears to be thiol redox-sensitive, NADPH oxidase-dependent upregulation of heme oxygenase-1. Thus, these findings are significant because they suggest that cells without adequate iron would be unable to fully express the stress gene, heme oxygenase-1, when confronted with the toxic metal, cadmium.

Abstract: We report the characteristics of Ga-doped zinc oxide (GZO) films prepared by a highly efficient cylindrical rotating magnetron sputtering (CRMS) system as a function of substrate temperature for use as a transparent conducting electrode in bulk hetero-junction organic solar cells (OSCs). Using a rotating cylindrical GZO target, low sheet resistance (∼11.67Ω/square) and highly transparent (90%) GZO films were deposited with high usage (∼80%) of the cylindrical GZO target. High usage of the cylindrical GZO target in the CRMS system indicates that CRMS is a promising deposition technique to prepare cost-efficient GZO electrodes for low cost OSCs. Resistivity and optical transmittance of the CRMS-grown GZO film were mainly affected by substrate temperature because the grain size and activation of the Ga dopant were critically dependent on the substrate temperature. In addition, the performance of OSC fabricated on GZO electrode sputtered at 230°C (11.67Ω/square) is better than OSC fabricated on as-deposited GZO electrode (29.20Ω/square). OSCs fabricated on the GZO electrode sputtered at 230°C showed an open circuit voltage of 0.558V, short circuit current of 8.987mA/cm2, fill factor of 0.628 and power conversion efficiency of 3.149%.

Abstract: The compositional distribution of Ga and S in Cu(InGa)(SeS)2 films fabricated by a simultaneous selenization and sulfization process was systematically investigated. At low H2Se/H2S reaction temperature (490°C), most Ga remains at the back of the film adjacent to the Mo back contact. However, the Ga/III ratios at the top and bottom of the Cu(InGa)(SeS)2 layer monotonically increase and decrease with reaction temperatures, respectively. At T>550°C, homogeneous distribution of elemental Ga and In through film is achieved. Further increase of the reaction temperature (e.g., T>550°C) causes phase segregation on the surface of the Cu(InGa)(SeS)2 film confirmed by XRD, GIXRD and EDS analysis.

Abstract: A highly soluble amorphous fullerene derivative substituted with dihexylfluorene (DHFCBM) was synthesized and used as an electron acceptor material for P3HT-based bulk heterojunction solar cells. By fitting the experimental J–V curves with space charge limited current equation, the electron mobility of DHFCBM was determined to be 4×10−4cm2/Vs, possibly leading to balanced charge transport with P3HT. From structural and morphological analysis using X-ray diffraction, UV–vis absorption, and atomic force microscopy, we found that the amorphous nature of DHFCBM stabilized the nanomorphology of P3HT:DHFCBM blend films under high temperature annealing. By optimizing blend ratios and annealing conditions, P3HT:DHFCBM-based solar cells yielded power conversion efficiencies in excess of 3%. In addition, the fabricated cells maintained their initial performances even after high temperature annealing for long times, as predicted from the stable nanomorphology. We believe that the use of thermally stable amorphous fullerene as an electron acceptor can be a promising strategy for commercialization of organic solar cells.

Abstract: Photovoltaics cost has been declining following a 70% learning curve. Now the challenge is to bring down the cost of solar electricity to make it competitive with conventional sources within the next decade. In the long run, the module efficiencies tend to reach 80% of the champion cell efficiencies. Using a semiempirical methodology, it has been shown earlier that while the triple junction a-Si:H thin film technology is competitive, CIGS and CdTe thin film module technologies are highly competitive and presently offer the best approach for significantly exceeding the cost/performance levels of standard and non-standard crystalline Si PV technologies. Since 2006, the production of thin film solar cell in the U.S. has surpassed that of c-Si. At present, the production of CIGS PV modules lags considerably behind that of CdTe PV modules. This is mainly because of its complexity. Scale-up issues related to various CIGS preparation technologies such as co-evaporation, metallic precursor deposition by magnetron sputtering and non-vacuum techniques such as ink-jet printing, electroplating or doctor-blade technology followed by their selenization/sulfurization are discussed so as to assist the CIGS technology to attain its full potential. Besides the welcome announcements of large volume production, it is essential to achieve the production cost below $1/Wp in the near term and attain production speeds comparable to CdTe production speeds. Comparable production speeds are expected to be achieved within the next decade. This will enable reduction of CIGS module production costs to ∼65¢/Wp that would be comparable to the CdTe module projected production cost. Additionally CIGS will have a higher efficiency premium.

Abstract: Three environmental factors of irradiance, solar spectral distribution and module temperature greatly affect the performances of photovoltaic (PV) modules. If the environmental factors can be estimated by basic meteorological data (BMD) announced by an official organization in various areas, the performances of PV modules can be estimated easily. In this study, a relationship between the environmental factors and the BMD was analyzed. The performances of Si-based (crystalline Si and thin-film Si) PV modules were estimated by the relationship. As a result, errors between the estimation and actual performances in the crystalline Si and thin-film PV modules were within 1.88% and 0.58% in Kusatsu city, Japan (34°58′N, 135°57′E). This methodology can be useful for rating the performance of PV modules at various areas.

Abstract: The Pax5 and its isoforms influence proliferation of B- and T-cells, during development and oncogenesis but molecular mechanism and host–tumor relationship is not clear. This report describes status of Pax5 isoforms and co-regulation of molecular markers of ascite cells causing Dalton's lymphoma in murine. Higher expressions of Pax5, CD19, CD3, Ras and Raf were observed in DLA cells. The levels of transcripts as well as p53 protein were also higher in DLA cells. The transcript of p53 from DLA cells was a variant of p53 having deletion of 50bp as compared to control. On annotation, it reflects transformation related protein p53 pseudogene mRNA. Lower level of superoxide dismutase (SOD) indicates oxidative stress and higher level of LDH5 in DLA cells reflects hypoxia in cancerous condition. The expression of Pax5d/e isoforms in DLA cells suggests presence of resting B-cells. Thus, isoforms of Pax5 and co-regulation of T- and B-cells associated genes influence phenotypic traits of ascetic cells causing Dalton's lymphoma.

Abstract: In previous studies we have demonstrated that prion protein (PrP) interacts with tubulin and disrupts microtubular cytoskeleton by inducing tubulin oligomerization. These observations may explain the molecular mechanism of toxicity of cytoplasmic PrP in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). Here, we check whether microtubule associated proteins (MAPs) that regulate microtubule stability, influence the PrP-induced oligomerization of tubulin. We show that tubulin preparations depleted of MAPs are more prone to oligomerization by PrP than those containing traces of MAPs. Tau protein, a major neuronal member of the MAPs family, reduces the effect of PrP. Importantly, phosphorylation of Tau abolishes its ability to affect the PrP-induced oligomerization of tubulin. We propose that the binding of Tau stabilizes tubulin in a conformation less susceptible to oligomerization by PrP. Since elevated phosphorylation of Tau leading to a loss of its function is observed in Alzheimer disease and related tauopathies, our results point at a possible molecular link between these neurodegenerative disorders and TSEs.

Abstract: In this work, we propose the use of Woods metal, which is an eutectic alloy of Pb/Bi/Cd/Sn (25%, 50%, 12.5% and 12.5%, respectively), as a convenient substitute to evaporated aluminum for testing polymeric organic photovoltaic (OPVs) devices. The Woods metal, which melts at 75°C, was used as cathode and it permits an easy and quick device implementation that can be performed through a vacuum free process. As anode, the commercial and transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) deposited on glass slides was used. OPVs cells were prepared based on 6-nitro-3-(E)-3-(4-dimethylaminophenyl)allylidene)-2,3-dihydrobenzo[d]-[1,3,2]-oxazaborole (M1) and (E)-3-(4-dimethylaminophenyl)allylidene)-2,3-dihydrobenzo[d]-[1,3,2]-oxazaborole (M2), which are conjugated organo-boron molecules, the well known photoconductor polymer MEH–PPV, and the fullerene PC61BM as the sensitizer. M1 and M2 were mixed with MEH–PPV to enhance the absorption of the OPVs devices. The OPVs cell electrical performance is acceptable considering the fast evaluation of promising materials.

Abstract: To improve the intrinsic stability of the component of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), we have fabricated the unit cell using solvent-free ionic liquid electrolyte. The degradation in the continuous 1 sun light soaking test at 60°C over 15,000h was effectively suppressed, compared with the cell using γ-butyrolactone electrolyte. The lifetime for outdoor use was estimated over 15 years from acceleration factor based on the outdoor exposure test. To confirm the stability of the DSC under practical outdoor use, we fabricated the solar light using the DSC modules, rechargeable batteries and bright light emitting diode (LED). The solar lights have been emitting a bright white light at night using the electricity from batteries charged by the DSC modules during the daytime in any weather condition for a half year.

Abstract: Bleomycin treatment of A549 cells induces senescence rather than apoptosis, a more usual response of cancer cells to cytotoxic drugs. We have previously shown that upregulation of caveolin-1, the main structural component of caveolae, plays a key role in this process. In order to gain a better understanding of the molecular basis of this phenomenon, caveolin-1-enriched microdomains of untreated and bleomycin-treated growth-arrested A549 cells were analysed for differential protein expression using 2-D DIGE followed by LC–MS/MS. One of these differentially expressed proteins was found to be the multidrug resistance-associated protein (MGr1-Ag). We show that MGr1-Ag becomes partly localised in lipid rafts following bleomycin treatment, and that MGr1-Ag and caveolin-1 occur in a common protein complex in vivo using co-immunoprecipitation studies. GST pull-down assays demonstrated an increased interaction between MGr1-Ag and caveolin-1 following bleomycin treatment in vitro. Our results reveal MGr1-Ag as a novel lipid raft protein; its increased association with caveolin-1 in bleomycin-induced cell cycle arrest and subsequent cellular senescence might contribute to the success of chemotherapy.

Abstract: The In2O3–ZnO (IZO) thin films were prepared on polyethylene terephthalate substrate at room temperature by direct current (dc) magnetron sputtering. The properties of IZO thin films were studied in terms of O2 concentration and deposition parameters. As the O2 concentration in O2/Ar gas increased, the transmittances of the films were increased up to 90% and the resistivities were decreased. The systematic variation of process parameters including dc power, gas pressure and target-to-substrate distance was performed to examine the properties of the deposited films. It was disclosed that there was an optimum O2 concentration for high transmittance and low resistivity. With decrease in dc power and gas pressure and increase in target-to-substrate distance, the IZO films with high transmittance and low resistivity were obtained. The observation of the IZO films by atomic force microscopy indicated that the microstructure and surface morphology of the films were responsible for the transmittance. It was demonstrated that IZO films with a resistivity of 5.1×10−4Ωcm and an optical transmission of 90% in the visible spectrum could be prepared at room temperature on flexible substrates.

Abstract: p-Type hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) was deposited on n-type crystalline silicon (c-Si) substrates to obtain hetero-junction diodes. Additionally, a thin intrinsic a-Si:H layer was inserted between both the p-type film and the n-type substrate to study its passivation effect on the c-Si surface. The amorphous films were obtained by the hot wire chemical vapor deposition (HWCVD) technique, using a tungsten filament and silane (SiH4), hydrogen (H2) and diborane (B2H6) gases, where the deposition parameters such as gas flow, substrate temperature and filament temperature were varied. Optical band gap, deposition rate and conductivity were measured for all the films. We studied the influence of the quality of the amorphous films upon the performance of the hetero-junction diodes. In particular, the diode ideality factor (n) and the saturation current density (J0) were determined by measuring the current–voltage characteristics in dark conditions. It is shown that the presence of the intrinsic layer is fundamental for making good diodes, since devices made without this film cause the diodes to have high saturation current density and ideality factor (J0>10×10−6A/cm2, n>4) as compared to diodes with a good intrinsic layer (J0=5×10−9A/cm2, n=1.39). The results obtained are encouraging, but the quality of the intrinsic films still should be improved for applying them to HIT solar cells.

Abstract: The hydrogenated silicon nitride films (SiNx:H) deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) technique is commonly used as an antireflection coating as well as surface passivating layer of crystalline silicon solar cells. The refractive indices of SiNx:H films could be changed by varying the growth gas ratio R(=NH3/SiH4+NH3) and annealing temperature. For optimum SiNx:H film, the optical and chemical characterization tools by varying the film deposition and annealing condition were employed in this study. Metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) devices were fabricated using SiNx:H as an insulator layer and they were subjected to capacitance–voltage (C–V) and current–voltage (I–V) measurements for electrical characterization. The effect of rapid thermal annealing (RTA) on the surface passivation as well as antireflection properties of the SiNx:H films deposited at various process conditions were also investigated for the fabrication of low cost and high efficiency silicon solar cells.

Abstract: We developed heterojunction-based Schottky solar cells consisting of π-conjugated polymers and n-type GaN. Poly (3,4-ethylendioxythiophene):poly (styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was used as the transparent Schottky contact material and their electrical properties were investigated in comparison with those of a polyaniline (PANI) Schottky contact. The PEDOT:PSS/n-GaN/sapphire (0001) sample exhibited high-quality rectifying characteristics with a low reverse leakage current of less than 10−8A/cm2 at a reverse bias voltage of −3V. While investigating the photovoltaic performance, it was observed that the open-circuit voltage of the PEDOT:PSS/n-GaN/sapphire (0001) sample reached 0.8V, which was much superior to the photovoltage reported for a conventional metal/GaN Schottky photodetector. We also confirmed that the PEDOT:PSS is as promising a material as PANI for π-conjugated polymer/GaN Schottky solar cells.

Abstract: A zinc-finger protein which regulates apoptosis and cell cycle arrest 1 (Zac1) is a novel seven-zinc-finger protein that can bind a specific GC-rich DNA element and has intrinsic transactivation activity; therefore, its role as a transcription factor has been proposed. Zac1 not only promotes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis but also acts as a transcriptional cofactor for nuclear receptors and p53. In this study, we examined the functional roles of mouse Zac1 (mZac1) in HeLa cells treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (PMA), a potent Activator protein 1 (AP-1) activator. At first, we found that mZac1 prolonged and enhanced PMA-induced AP-1 activity in both HeLa and HeLa/p53 shRNA cells. We further identified physical and functional interactions between mZac1 and AP-1 proteins (either c-Jun, c-Fos or both). Finally, we showed that Zac1 might function as a selective coactivator of AP-1, demonstrated by AP-1-dependent transcriptional activation of collagenase, c-Fos and p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter activities. Identification of AP-1 as a specific target for Zac1-mediated transcriptional events not only establishes a direct link between these two pivotal regulatory proteins but also raises the possibility that Zac1 contributes to certain AP-1-dependent biological effects.

Abstract: We report a brief study on the effect of strong base addition to the hole-collecting buffer layer [poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)] on the performance of polymer solar cells made using blend films of poly(3-hexylthiophene) and soluble fullerene. A concentrated aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was added to the PEDOT:PSS solution to decrease its acidity. The optical absorption spectra of modified buffer layers were measured to investigate the influence of NaOH addition on the spectral shape, while the surface of modified buffer layers was examined using atomic force microscopy. Results showed that the acidity of PEDOT:PSS solutions was remarkably reduced by adding the NaOH solution. However, the performance of solar cells was slightly degraded, which has been attributed to the decreased charge transportability as evidenced from the dark current–voltage characteristics.

Abstract: A 3D distributed model is developed and implemented based on circuit analysis software for the investigation of spatial variation in performance due to the distributed nature and non-uniformity of solar cell properties. This is applied to LBIC measurements where it is used for sensitivity analysis of the measurements with respect to certain parameters in series connected thin film PV modules. The model is used to explain the differences in dark and illuminated measurements, which clearly shows the illuminated LBIC signal is largely dependent on the homogeneity of the background illumination. The dark LBIC is largely affected by the shunt resistance of the neighbouring cells rather than by the signal strength of the cell under test. It is required to bring the cell into limiting conditions, which then gives a signal one order of magnitude stronger than that in the non-limiting case. The simulations are validated against measurements taken in these regimes.

Abstract: We report on the characteristics of a TiO2 passivating layer grown by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering on F-doped SnO2 (FTO) electrodes as a function of its thickness. The optical transparency, surface roughness and passivation properties of the TiO2 layer passivating the FTO electrode depend on the thickness of the TiO2 passivating layer. In addition, it was found that the power conversion efficiency of the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) is critically dependent on the thickness of RF sputtered TiO2 layer inserted between FTO electrode and nanoporous TiO2 layer. The DSSC fabricated on 50nm thick TiO2 passivating FTO electrode showed the maximum power conversion efficiency of 4.42% due to effective prevention of the electron transfer to electrolyte. This indicates that the thickness optimization of the TiO2 passivating layer is one of the important parameter to obtain high performance DSSCs.

Abstract: The ability to controllably tune the work function of transparent conductors is essential for optimizing the efficiency of thin film solar photovoltaics. Here we use Kelvin force microscopy on lithographically patterned ZnO:Al thin films to measure the dependence of the work function on oxygen content during synthesis. Films were synthesized by low temperature reactive sputtering from a Zn:Al 1.2wt% target. At optimal oxygen content the resistivity is 3×10−4Ωcm with nearly 90% optical transmission in the 400–1100nm wavelength range relevant to solar photovoltaics. We find that the expected relationship between band filling and work function breaks down in the vicinity of optimal oxygen stoichiometry. For oxygen-rich ZnO:Al films we measure large work functions close to 5eV. Our results suggest a method for fabricating transparent oxide electron conductors with large, tunable work functions that could be of relevance in designing electrodes for solid state energy conversion technologies.

Abstract: MG Si can be effectively refined using a fractional melting process. The efficiency of fractional melting depends on two parameters, the heating rate and the wetness. Generally, the heating rate should be slow to ensure impurity diffusion and, in order to perfectly separate the liquid from the solid/liquid mixture, there should not be higher wetness. Many MG Si metal impurities exhibit retrograde solubility. The metal impurity behaviors with retrograde solubility were studied during the FM process. The change of the microstructure during the process was also studied with a SEM and an EPMA. Due to the retrograde behavior, slow heating below the maximum solubility temperature was not necessary to refine MG Si. For the FM process, the operating temperature range to refine MG Si should be carefully selected considering the behavior of major metal impurities in the mushy zone.

Abstract: Polyaniline (PANI) thin films studded with nano-islands on their surface are electrochemically synthesized. The surface morphology of these films can be adjusted by controlling the deposition time during the synthesis. The PANI films decorated with nano-islands are used as the buffer layer in the organic solar cells based on a blend of poly[2-methoxy-5-(3′,7′-dimethyloctyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] (MDMO-PPV) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). The investigation on the characteristics of the solar cells demonstrates that the nano-islands on the PANI buffer surface are helpful in improving the solar cell performance.

Abstract: Temperature control of solar cells at high concentrations is a key issue. Short-term efficiency drop and long-term degradation should be avoided by effective cooling methods. Liquid immersion cooling eliminates the contact thermal resistance of back cooling and should improve cell performance. A 250X dish concentrator with two-axis tracking was utilized to evaluate a new CPV system using de-ionized water for immersion cooling. Time-dependent temperature distributions of the PV module of high power back point-contact cells were measured, as well as the I–V curves. The cooling capacities of the liquid immersion approach are very favorable. The module temperature can be cooled to 45°C at a 940W/m2 direct normal irradiance, 17°C ambient temperature and 30°C water inlet temperature. The temperature distribution of the module is quite uniform, but the electrical performance of the cell module degrades after a fairly long time immersion in the de-ionized water.

Abstract: Textured ZnO:Al films with excellent light scattering properties as a front electrode of silicon thin film solar cells were prepared on glass substrates by an in-line rf magnetron sputtering, followed by a wet-etching process to modify the surface morphologies of the films. Deposition parameters and wet etching conditions of the films were controlled precisely to obtain the optimized surface features. All as-deposited films show a strong preferred orientation in the [001] direction under our experimental conditions. The microstructure of the films was significantly affected by working pressure and film compactness was reduced with increasing working pressure, while the effect of a substrate temperature on the microstructure is less pronounced. A low resistivity of 4.25×10−4Ωcm and high optical transmittance of above 80% in a visible range were obtained in the films deposited at 1.5mTorr and 100°C. After wet etching process, the surface morphologies of the films were changed dramatically depending on the microstructure and film compactness of the initial films. By controlling the surface feature, the haze factor and angular resolved distribution of the textured ZnO:Al films were improved remarkably when compared with commercial SnO2:F films. The textured ZnO:Al and SnO2:F films were applied as substrates for a silicon thin film solar cells with tandem structure of a-Si:H/μc-Si:H. Compared with the solar cells with the SnO2:F films, a significant enhancement in the short-circuit current density of the μc-Si:H bottom cell was achieved, which is due to the improved light scattering on the highly textured ZnO:Al film surfaces in the long wavelength above 600nm.

Abstract: The paper reviews the material requirements of microcrystalline silicon (μc-Si) in terms of the device operation and configuration for thin film solar cells and thin film transistors (TFTs). We investigated the material properties of μc-Si films deposited by using 13.56MHz plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) from a conventional H2 dilution in SiH4. Two types of intrinsic μc-Si films deposited at the high pressure narrow electrode gap and the low pressure wide electrode gap were studied for the solar cell absorption layers. The material properties were characterized using dark conductivity, Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscope (TEM) measurements. The μc-Si quality and solar cell performance were mainly determined by microstructure characteristics. Solar cells adopting the optimized μc-Si film demonstrated high stability with no significant changes in solar cell performance after air exposure for six months and subsequent illumination for over 300h. The results can be explained that low ion bombardment and high atomic hydrogen density under the PECVD condition of the high pressure narrow electrode gap produce high-quality μc-Si films for solar cell application.

Abstract: The novel PKCθ isoform is highly expressed in T-cells, brain and skeletal muscle and originally thought to have a restricted distribution. It has been extensively studied in T-cells and shown to be important for apoptosis, T-cell activation and proliferation. Recent studies showed its presence in other tissues and importance in insulin signaling, lung surfactant secretion, intestinal barrier permeability, platelet and mast-cell functions. However, little information is available for PKCθ activation by gastrointestinal (GI) hormones/neurotransmitters and growth factors. In the present study we used rat pancreatic acinar cells to explore their ability to activate PKCθ and the possible interactions with important cellular mediators of their actions. Particular attention was paid to cholecystokinin (CCK), a physiological regulator of pancreatic function and important in pathological processes affecting acinar function, like pancreatitis. PKCθ-protein/mRNA was present in the pancreatic acini, and T538-PKCθ phosphorylation/activation was stimulated only by hormones/neurotransmitters activating phospholipase C. PKCθ was activated in time- and dose-related manner by CCK, mediated 30% by high-affinity CCKA-receptor activation. CCK stimulated PKCθ translocation from cytosol to membrane. PKCθ inhibition (by pseudostrate-inhibitor or dominant negative) inhibited CCK- and TPA-stimulation of PKD, Src, RafC, PYK2, p125FAK and IKKα/β, but not basal/stimulated enzyme secretion. Also CCK- and TPA-induced PKCθ activation produced an increment in PKCθ's direct association with AKT, RafA, RafC and Lyn. These results show for the first time the PKCθ presence in pancreatic acinar cells, its activation by some GI hormones/neurotransmitters and involvement in important cell signaling pathways mediating physiological responses (enzyme secretion, proliferation, apoptosis, cytokine expression, and pathological responses like pancreatitis and cancer growth).

Abstract: (2,7-bis[5′-(9,9-dioctylfluorene-2-yl)-2,2′-dithienyl-5-yl]-9,9-dioctylfluorene) (F3Th4) was used as a secondary electron donor material in the poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):[6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) bulk-heterojunction photovoltaic cell. It is shown that the combination of F3Th4 with P3HT allows strong light absorption. The mechanism of charge transfer in the multi-donor PV cell was investigated; it shows that efficient energy transfer takes place from F3Th4 to P3HT. However, the short-circuit current (JSC) of the multi-donor bulk-heterojunction photovoltaic (PV) cell still decreased. The possible reason for the smaller photocurrent is worsening of transport property after addition of F3Th4.

Abstract: Solar grade, p-type multicrystalline silicon wafers with large grains from different parts of silicon ingots produced by the metallurgical route (SoG-Si) at ELKEM Solar were studied using a number of complementary methods such as microwave photoconductivity decay, deep level transient spectroscopy, transmission and scanning electron microscopy, X-ray fluorescence, and secondary ion mass spectroscopy. Wafers from the top of the ingots have uniform spatial distributions of both minority carrier lifetime (average lifetime τ=3.2μs) and concentrations of illumination-sensitive recombination centers (Nrc=3×1010−2×1011cm−3) over the whole wafers. Wafers from the bottom of the ingots have regions of very low lifetimes (τ=0.3μs) and high concentrations of illumination-sensitive recombination centers (Nrc=2×1012cm−3). In the top part of the ingots the observed DLTS peaks can be attributed to copper-related extended defects, and the DLTS results from grains and grain boundaries are not significantly different. The main factors limiting the lifetime in the high lifetime regions are concluded to be illumination-sensitive recombination centers such as Fe–B pairs, B–O complexes, and Cu-related extended defects. The low lifetimes in the bottom part of the ingots are explained by a combination of several factors including high concentrations of illumination-sensitive recombination centers and of some deleterious elements (S, Na and Al), and a large amount of structural defects.

Abstract: Surface passivation has been recognized as a crucial step in the evaluation of minority carrier lifetime of photovoltaic materials as well as in the fabrication of high efficient solar cells. Dilute acids of HF and HCl are employed for germanium (Ge) surface passivation. An effective lifetime of passivated Ge wafers has been evaluated by a microwave photoconductive decay (μ-PCD) measurement. Surface recombination velocities, S, of H- and Cl-terminated Ge surfaces are 23 and 37cm/s, respectively. The stability of passivated Ge surfaces against exposure to air has also been examined. The HCl-passivated Ge surfaces are found to be more robust than HF-passivated surfaces.

Abstract: The iodide and tri-iodide reduction–oxidation couples in the liquid electrolyte of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are very reactive and corrosive with the other components of the DSSCs, especially the sealing material. A leakage of the liquid electrolyte to cells generally occurs in the DSSCs because of a chemical reaction between the sealing material and the electrolyte. This leakage is correlated to the long-term stability and energy conversion efficiency of the dye-sensitized solar module. This study examined the reactions between the electrolyte and the glass using a leaching test with the aim of using this material as the matrix of the sealing materials in DSSCs. The prepared samples were evaluated using an inductively coupled plasma spectroscope, a nanoindentation test, an atomic force microscope and a contact angle analyzer. After the leaching test, the zinc and boron ions from the glass were leached into the electrolyte after immersion for 1h. The elastic modulus, hardness, and surface roughness of the glass changed after the formation of the leached layer of the glass surface. The results suggested that the compositions of the oxide sealant should be considered in terms of the chemical stability in the electrolyte.

Abstract: Endothelin-1 induced signaling is characterized by an early induction of a nuclear factor-kappa B p65/mitogen-activated phosphokinase p38 transcription complex via its A-receptor versus a late induction via diacylglycerol, and protein kinase C. A possible interaction between these two pathways and a potential function for protein kinase C in this context has not previously been elucidated. Here we report that in Caki-1 tumor cells, protein kinase C α is a part of the transcription complex. With importin α4 and α5 as chaperones, the transcription complex transmigrates into the nucleus. Protein kinase C α blocks the nuclear release of pri-microRNA 15a by direct binding shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and Duolink immune histology. The expression levels of miRNA 15a can be further manipulated by transfection of si-protein kinase C α, or an expression vector containing protein kinase C α or miRNA 15. The miRNA 15a regulation by protein kinase C α is detectable in different malignant human tumor cell lines (renal cell carcinoma, breast carcinoma, and melanoma). Furthermore, all three cell lines harbor both endothelin receptors (ETAR/ETBR). Specific blockage of each receptor leads to major reduction of miRNA 15a expression due to increased nuclear protein kinase C α translocation. We conclude that the nuclear binding of pri-microRNA 15a is a novel function of protein kinase C α, which plays an important role in endothelin-1 mediated signaling. Since several endothelin-sensitive, malignant tumor cell lines harbor this regulation, it could indicate a more general role in tumor biology.

Abstract: Al conducting films are formed from the Al pastes with various amounts of glass powders. Pb-based glass powders with submicron size and spherical shape prepared by spray pyrolysis are used. The Al films formed from the Al pastes with high amount of glass powders have good adhesion properties with Si wafers. The optimum glass contents showing the minimum sheet resistance of the Al film changed according to the firing temperatures. The optimum glass contents are 7, 5 and 3wt% of Al content at firing temperatures of 700, 800 and 900°C, respectively. The minimum sheet resistance of the Al film with thickness of 31.4μm is 9.5mΩ/sq.

Abstract: Improving the front metallization quality of silicon solar cells should be a key to enhance cell performance. In this work, we investigated a two-layer metallization scheme involving light-induced plating (LIP) and tried to quantify its impact on the series resistance of the front grid metals and FFs on finished cells. To estimate the effect of LIP processing on a printed and fired seed layer, individual components of series resistance were measured before and after LIP processing. Among them, grid resistance and contact resistance were closely observed because of their large contribution to series resistance. To optimize the plating on the seed metal grid, the grid resistance of the two-layer metal grid structure was calculated as a function of cross section area of the plated layer. Contact resistivity of the grid before and after LIP processing was analyzed to understand the contact resistance reduction, as well. As a result, the efficiency of solar cells with 80μm seed metal grid width increased by 0.3% absolute compared with conventional solar cells of 120μm metal grid width. The total area of electrodes in conventional cells was 1800mm2 and electrodes area of LIP processed solar cells was 1400mm2. The efficiency gain was due to reduction of shadowing loss from 7.7% to 6.0% without the increase of resistance due to two-layer front metallization.

Abstract: Fractal analysis in cancer cell investigation provided meaningful insights into the relationship between morphology and phenotype. Some reports demonstrated that changes in cell shape precede and trigger dramatic modifications in both gene expression and enzymatic function. Nonetheless, metabolomic pattern in cells undergoing shape changes have been not still reported. Our study was aimed to investigate if modifications in cancer cell morphology are associated to relevant transition in tumour metabolome, analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and principal component analysis. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, exposed to an experimental morphogenetic field, undergo a dramatic change in their membrane profiles. Both cell lines recover a more rounded shape, loosing spindle and invasive protrusions, acquiring a quite “normal” morphology. This result, quantified by fractal analysis, shows that normalized bending energy (a global shape characterization expressing the amount of energy needed to transform a specific shape into its lowest energy state) decreases after 48h. Later on, a significant shift from a high to a low glycolytic phenotype was observed on both cell lines: glucose flux begins to drop off at 48h, leading to reduced lactate accumulation, and fatty acids and citrate synthesis slow-down after 72h. Moreover, de novo lipidogenesis is inhibited and nucleotide synthesis is reduced, as indicated by the positive correlation between glucose and formate. In conclusion, these data indicate that the reorganization of cell membrane architecture, induced by environmental cues, is followed by a relevant transition of the tumour metabolome, suggesting cells undergo a dramatic phenotypic reversion.

Abstract: Zinc oxide (ZnO) thin films have been successfully grown by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) technique using deuterium water (D2O) and water (H2O) mixtures as oxidants for diethylzinc (DEZ). B2H6 was also employed as a dopant gas. It was found that the crystal orientation of ZnO films strongly depends on D2O/H2O ratio. As a result, the surface morphology of ZnO changed from textured surface morphology to smooth surface morphology with increase in the ratio of D2O/H2O. Moreover, it was also observed that the carrier concentration of ZnO films did not change with the ratio of D2O/H2O, while the mobility of these films was strongly dependent on the D2O/H2O ratio. Without D2O addition, the resistivity of films had its lowest value and the minimum sheet resistance was 10Ω/square. All films showed transmittance higher than 80% in the visible region. Moreover, the haze values of these films could be controlled by the ratio of D2O/H2O. These results indicate that the crystal orientation and surface morphology of the low resistivity ZnO films can be modified by using a mixture of D2O and H2O without changing the deposition temperature. Thus, the obtained ZnO films are promising for use as a front TCO layer in Si-based thin film solar cells.

Abstract: Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cells with a superstrate structure were fabricated using a lift-off process. To widen the variety of substrate choices for CIGS solar cells, a lift-off process was developed without an intentional sacrificial layer between the CIGS and Mo back-contact layers. The CIGS solar cells fabricated on Mo/soda-lime glass (SLG) were transferred to an alternative SLG substrate. The conversion efficiency of the CIGS solar cells with the superstrate structure was 5.1%, which was almost half that of the CIGS solar cells with a substrate structure prior to the lift-off process. The low conversion efficiency was caused by the high series resistance and low shunt resistance, which would be due to the junction resistance between the CIGS/back contact and cracks introduced during the lift-off process, respectively.

Abstract: Metal-wrap-through (MWT) is a promising technique to improve the solar cell performance cost effectively because it can be easily integrated into the current production line with only two additional processing steps. Metal filling through the via-holes is a key to obtain low series resistances and good FFs. In this study, several screen printing process conditions were examined to find out an optimal filling state of the metal contacts. Various shapes of the filled metals in the via-holes were formed with different printing conditions, and the shape of the filled metal results in different series resistance values. Optimization of the printing conditions dramatically reduced the series resistance of the MWT cells. The maximum and minimum series resistance values of the cells obtained are 8.56 and 0.114Ωcm2, respectively. As a result, we achieved an efficiency of 16.3% using the optimal printing condition on 156mm×156mm solar-grade multi-crystalline silicon wafer, which was 0.8% absolute higher than the baseline cell efficiency.

Abstract: A number of p-type emitters of solar cells, covered with a thin, copper-doped CdS layer, show a significant increase in open circuit voltage and fill factor. This is caused by field limitation in the junction to 50kV/cm, and induced by field quenching in photo-conducting CdS. As a result, the junction field increases when the bias is reduced from forward toward Voc; however, it cannot increase above the critical field for the onset of field quenching. Consequently, electron leakage through the junction interface is reduced, which could otherwise occur in uncoated solar cells when the junction field approaches tunneling fields. In addition, with increasing quenching the Fermi level moves further away from the conduction band, causing the bands at the junction interface to disconnect. As a consequence of field quenching, the CdS enters a range of negative differential conductivity, creating a high-field domain that absorbs increased voltage in the reverse bias range without increasing the junction field. The doping density with Cu is critical; it is self-adjusted by limited solubility of Cu in CdS and is extremely difficult to realize homogeneously for any other known semiconductor cover layer.

Abstract: Sialyl Lewis x (sLex) is a selectin ligand whose overexpression in epithelial cancers mediates metastasis formation. The molecular basis of sLex biosynthesis in colon cancer tissues is still unclear. The prerequisite for therapeutic approaches aimed at sLex down-regulation in cancer, is the identification of rate-limiting steps in its biosynthesis. We have studied the role of α1,3-fucosyltransferases (Fuc-Ts) potentially involved in sLex biosynthesis in specimens of normal and cancer colon as well as in experimental systems. We found that: (i) in colon cancer, but not in normal mucosa where the antigen was poorly expressed, sLex correlated with a Fuc-T which, like Fuc-TVI, was active on 3′sialyllactosamine at a low concentration (Fuc-TSLN); (ii) competitive RT-PCR analysis revealed that the level of Fuc-T mRNA expression in both normal and cancer colon was Fuc-TVI>Fuc-TIII>Fuc-TIV; Fuc-TV and Fuc-TVII expression was negligible; (iii) sLex was expressed only by the gastrointestinal cell lines displaying both Fuc-TVI mRNA and Fuc-TSLN activity, but not by those expressing only Fuc-TIII mRNA; (iv) transfection with Fuc-TVI cDNA, but not with Fuc-TIII cDNA, induced sLex expression in gastrointestinal cell lines; (v) Fuc-TVI knock-down with specific siRNA induced down-regulation of Fuc-TVI mRNA and Fuc-TSLN activity and a dramatic inhibition of sLex expression. These data indicate that in colon cancer tissues Fuc-TVI is a key regulator of sLex biosynthesis which can be the target of RNA-interference-based gene knock-down approaches.
