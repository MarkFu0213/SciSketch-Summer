Abstract: The respiratory system is a vital component of our body, essential for both oxygen uptake and immune defense. Knowledge of cellular composition and function in different parts of the respiratory tract provides the basis for a better understanding of the pathological processes involved in various diseases such as chronic respiratory diseases and cancer. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a proficient approach for the identification and transcriptional characterization of cellular phenotypes. Although the mouse is an essential tool for the study of lung development, regeneration, and disease, a scRNA-seq mouse atlas of the lung in which all epithelial cell types are included and annotated systematically is lacking. Here, we established a single-cell transcriptome landscape of the mouse lower respiratory tract by performing a meta-analysis of seven different studies in which mouse lungs and trachea were analyzed by droplet and/or plate-based scRNA-seq technologies. We provide information on the best markers for each epithelial cell type, propose surface markers for the isolation of viable cells, harmonized the annotation of cell types, and compare the mouse single-cell transcriptomes with human scRNA-seq data of the lung.

Abstract: Summary
Genomic instability can promote inflammation and tumor development. Previous research revealed an unexpected layer of regulation of genomic instability by a cytoplasmic protein MYO10; however, the underlying mechanism remained unclear. Here, we report a protein stability-mediated mitotic regulation of MYO10 in controlling genome stability. We characterized a degron motif and phosphorylation residues in the degron that mediate β-TrCP1-dependent MYO10 degradation. The level of phosphorylated MYO10 protein transiently increases during mitosis, which is accompanied by a spatiotemporal cellular localization change first accumulating at the centrosome then at the midbody. Depletion of MYO10 or expression of MYO10 degron mutants, including those found in cancer patients, disrupts mitosis, increases genomic instability and inflammation, and promotes tumor growth; however, they also increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to Taxol. Our studies demonstrate a critical role of MYO10 in mitosis progression, through which it regulates genome stability, cancer growth, and cellular response to mitotic toxins.

Abstract: Summary
Upon antigen-specific T cell receptor (TCR) engagement, human CD4+ T cells proliferate and differentiate, a process associated with rapid transcriptional changes and metabolic reprogramming. Here, we show that the generation of extramitochondrial pyruvate is an important step for acetyl-CoA production and subsequent H3K27ac-mediated remodeling of histone acetylation. Histone modification, transcriptomic, and carbon tracing analyses of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH)-deficient T cells show PDH-dependent acetyl-CoA generation as a rate-limiting step during T activation. Furthermore, T cell activation results in the nuclear translocation of PDH and its association with both the p300 acetyltransferase and histone H3K27ac. These data support the tight integration of metabolic and histone-modifying enzymes, allowing metabolic reprogramming to fuel CD4+ T cell activation. Targeting this pathway may provide a therapeutic approach to specifically regulate antigen-driven T cell activation.

Abstract: Summary
Pressure therapy (PT) is an effective intervention for reducing scarring, but its underlying mechanism remains largely unclear. Here, we demonstrate that human scar-derived myofibroblasts dedifferentiate into normal fibroblasts in response to PT, and we identify how SMYD3/ITGBL1 contributes to the nuclear relay of mechanical signals. In clinical specimens, reductions in SMYD3 and ITGBL1 expression levels are strongly associated with the anti-scarring effects of PT. The integrin β1/ILK pathway is inhibited in scar-derived myofibroblasts upon PT, leading to decreased TCF-4 and subsequently to reductions in SMYD3 expression, which reduces the levels of H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and further suppresses ITGBL1 expression, resulting the dedifferentiation of myofibroblasts into fibroblasts. In animal models, blocking SMYD3 expression results in reductions of scarring, mimicking the positive effects of PT. Our results show that SMYD3 and ITGBL1 act as sensors and mediators of mechanical pressure to inhibit the progression of fibrogenesis and provide therapeutic targets for fibrotic diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Knowledge about evolution of clonal hematopoiesis, which may drive malignant progression, is crucial for clinical decision-making. We investigated the landscape of clonal evolution by error-corrected sequencing on 7,045 sequential samples from 3,359 individuals in the prospective population-based Lifelines cohort, with a special focus on cytosis and cytopenia. Spliceosome (SRSF2/U2AF1/SF3B1) and JAK2 mutated clones show highest growth rates over a median 3.6-year period, while clone sizes for DNMT3A and TP53 increase only marginally, independent of cytosis or cytopenia. Nevertheless, large differences are observed between individuals carrying the same mutation, indicative of modulation by non-mutation-related factors. Clonal expansion is not dependent on classical cancer risk factors (e.g., smoking). Risk for incident myeloid malignancy diagnosis is highest for JAK2, spliceosome, or TP53 mutations and absent for DNMT3A, and it is mostly preceded by cytosis or cytopenia. The results provide important insight into high-risk evolutionary patterns to guide monitoring of “CHIP” and “CCUS.”

Abstract: Summary
Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a non-obligate precursor of invasive breast cancer (IBC). Due to a lack of biomarkers able to distinguish high- from low-risk cases, DCIS is treated similar to early IBC even though the minority of untreated cases eventually become invasive. Here, we characterized 115 patient-derived mouse-intraductal (MIND) DCIS models reflecting the full spectrum of DCIS observed in patients. Utilizing the possibility to follow the natural progression of DCIS combined with omics and imaging data, we reveal multiple prognostic factors for high-risk DCIS including high grade, HER2 amplification, expansive 3D growth, and high burden of copy number aberrations. In addition, sequential transplantation of xenografts showed minimal phenotypic and genotypic changes over time, indicating that invasive behavior is an intrinsic phenotype of DCIS and supporting a multiclonal evolution model. Moreover, this study provides a collection of 19 distributable DCIS-MIND models spanning all molecular subtypes.

Abstract: Summary
Genome regulation involves complex protein interactions that are often mediated through post-translational modifications (PTMs). SUMOylation—modification by the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)—has been implicated in numerous essential processes in eukaryotes. In Drosophila, SUMO is required for viability and fertility, with its depletion from ovaries leading to heterochromatin loss and ectopic transposon and gene activation. Here, we developed a proteomics-based strategy to uncover the Drosophila ovarian “SUMOylome,” which revealed that SUMOylation is widespread among proteins involved in heterochromatin regulation and different aspects of the Piwi-interacting small RNA (piRNA) pathway that represses transposons. Furthermore, we show that SUMOylation of several piRNA pathway proteins occurs in a Piwi-dependent manner. Together, these data highlight broad implications of protein SUMOylation in epigenetic regulation and indicate novel roles of this modification in the cellular defense against genomic parasites. Finally, this work provides a resource for the study of SUMOylation in other biological contexts in the Drosophila model.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity-mediated hypoxic stress underlies inflammation, including interferon (IFN)-γ production by natural killer (NK) cells in white adipose tissue. However, the effects of obesity on NK cell IFN-γ production remain obscure. Here, we show that hypoxia promotes xCT-mediated glutamate excretion and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) expression in white adipocytes, resulting in CXCR4+ NK cell recruitment. Interestingly, this spatial proximity between adipocytes and NK cells induces IFN-γ production in NK cells by stimulating metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5). IFN-γ then triggers inflammatory activation of macrophages and augments xCT and CXCL12 expression in adipocytes, forming a bidirectional pathway. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of xCT, mGluR5, or IFN-γ receptor in adipocytes or NK cells alleviates obesity-related metabolic disorders in mice. Consistently, patients with obesity showed elevated levels of glutamate/mGluR5 and CXCL12/CXCR4 axes, suggesting that a bidirectional pathway between adipocytes and NK cells could be a viable therapeutic target in obesity-related metabolic disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Important decisions often involve choosing between complex environments that define future item encounters. Despite its importance for adaptive behavior and distinct computational challenges, decision-making research primarily focuses on item choice, ignoring environment choice altogether. Here we contrast previously studied item choice in ventromedial prefrontal cortex with lateral frontopolar cortex (FPl) linked to environment choice. Furthermore, we propose a mechanism for how FPl decomposes and represents complex environments during decision making. Specifically, we trained a choice-optimized, brain-naive convolutional neural network (CNN) and compared predicted CNN activation with actual FPl activity. We showed that the high-dimensional FPl activity decomposes environment features to represent the complexity of an environment to make such choice possible. Moreover, FPl functionally connects with posterior cingulate cortex for guiding environment choice. Further probing FPl’s computation revealed a parallel processing mechanism in extracting multiple environment features.

Abstract: Summary
We characterized the role of structural variants, a largely unexplored type of genetic variation, in two non-Alzheimer’s dementias, namely Lewy body dementia (LBD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD)/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). To do this, we applied an advanced structural variant calling pipeline (GATK-SV) to short-read whole-genome sequence data from 5,213 European-ancestry cases and 4,132 controls. We discovered, replicated, and validated a deletion in TPCN1 as a novel risk locus for LBD and detected the known structural variants at the C9orf72 and MAPT loci as associated with FTD/ALS. We also identified rare pathogenic structural variants in both LBD and FTD/ALS. Finally, we assembled a catalog of structural variants that can be mined for new insights into the pathogenesis of these understudied forms of dementia.

Abstract: Summary
At active human genes, the +1 nucleosome is located downstream of the RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) pre-initiation complex (PIC). However, at inactive genes, the +1 nucleosome is found further upstream, at a promoter-proximal location. Here, we establish a model system to show that a promoter-proximal +1 nucleosome can reduce RNA synthesis in vivo and in vitro, and we analyze its structural basis. We find that the PIC assembles normally when the edge of the +1 nucleosome is located 18 base pairs (bp) downstream of the transcription start site (TSS). However, when the nucleosome edge is located further upstream, only 10 bp downstream of the TSS, the PIC adopts an inhibited state. The transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) shows a closed conformation and its subunit XPB contacts DNA with only one of its two ATPase lobes, inconsistent with DNA opening. These results provide a mechanism for nucleosome-dependent regulation of transcription initiation.

Abstract: Summary
Ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is typically diagnosed at an advanced stage, with multiple genetically heterogeneous clones existing in the tumors long before therapeutic intervention. Herein we integrate clonal composition and topology using whole-genome sequencing data from 510 samples of 148 patients with HGSC in the prospective, longitudinal, multiregion DECIDER study. Our results reveal three evolutionary states, which have distinct features in genomics, pathways, and morphological phenotypes, and significant association with treatment response. Nested pathway analysis suggests two evolutionary trajectories between the states. Experiments with five tumor organoids and three PI3K inhibitors support targeting tumors with enriched PI3K/AKT pathway with alpelisib. Heterogeneity analysis of samples from multiple anatomical sites shows that site-of-origin samples have 70% more unique clones than metastatic tumors or ascites. In conclusion, these analysis and visualization methods enable integrative tumor evolution analysis to identify patient subtypes using data from longitudinal, multiregion cohorts.

Abstract: Peroxiredoxins (Prdxs) are thiol-dependent enzymes that scavenge peroxides. Previously, we found that Prdxs were hyperoxidized in a Parkinson's disease model induced by paraquat (PQ), which led to their inactivation, perpetuating reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. Herein, we evaluated the redox state of the typical 2-Cys-Prx subgroup. We found that PQ induces ROS compartmentalization in different organelles, reflected by the 2-Cys-Prdx hyperoxidation pattern detected by redox eastern blotting. 2-Cys Prdxs are most vulnerable to hyperoxidation, while atypical 2-Cys Peroxiredoxin 5 (Prdx5) is resistant and is expressed in multiple organelles, such as mitochondria, peroxisomes, and cytoplasm. Therefore, we overexpressed human Prdx5 in the dopaminergic SHSY-5Y cell line using the adenoviral vector Ad-hPrdx5. Prdx5 overexpression was confirmed by western blotting and immunofluorescence (IF) and effectively decreased PQ-mediated mitochondrial and cytoplasmic ROS assessed with a mitochondrial superoxide indicator and DHE through IF or flow cytometry. Decreased ROS mediated by Prdx5 in the main subcellular compartments led to overall cell protection against PQ-induced cell death, which was demonstrated by flow cytometry using Annexin V labeling and 7-AAD. Therefore, Prdx5 is an attractive therapeutic target for PD, as its overexpression protects dopaminergic cells from ROS and death, which warrants further experimental animal studies for its subsequent application in clinical trials.

Abstract: Summary
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic metabolic disorder caused by overnutrition and can lead to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The transcription factor Forkhead box K1 (FOXK1) is implicated in regulation of lipid metabolism downstream of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), but its role in NAFLD-NASH pathogenesis is understudied. Here, we show that FOXK1 mediates nutrient-dependent suppression of lipid catabolism in the liver. Hepatocyte-specific deletion of Foxk1 in mice fed a NASH-inducing diet ameliorates not only hepatic steatosis but also associated inflammation, fibrosis, and tumorigenesis, resulting in improved survival. Genome-wide transcriptomic and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses identify several lipid metabolism-related genes, including Ppara, as direct targets of FOXK1 in the liver. Our results suggest that FOXK1 plays a key role in the regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism and that its inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy for NAFLD-NASH, as well as for HCC.

Abstract: Summary
The melanocortin pathway is well established to be critical for body-weight regulation in both rodents and humans. Despite extensive studies focusing on this pathway, the downstream brain sites that mediate its action are not clear. Here, we found that, among the known paraventricular hypothalamic (PVH) neuron groups, those expressing melanocortin receptors 4 (PVHMc4R) preferably project to the ventral part of the lateral septum (LSv), a brain region known to be involved in emotional behaviors. Photostimulation of PVHMc4R neuron terminals in the LSv reduces feeding and causes aversion, whereas deletion of Mc4Rs or disruption of glutamate release from LSv-projecting PVH neurons causes obesity. In addition, disruption of AMPA receptor function in PVH-projected LSv neurons causes obesity. Importantly, chronic inhibition of PVH- or PVHMc4R-projected LSv neurons causes obesity associated with reduced energy expenditure. Thus, the LSv functions as an important node in mediating melanocortin action on body-weight regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Inner ear disorders are among the most common congenital abnormalities; however, current tissue culture models lack the cell type diversity to study these disorders and normal otic development. Here, we demonstrate the robustness of human pluripotent stem cell-derived inner ear organoids (IEOs) and evaluate cell type heterogeneity by single-cell transcriptomics. To validate our findings, we construct a single-cell atlas of human fetal and adult inner ear tissue. Our study identifies various cell types in the IEOs including periotic mesenchyme, type I and type II vestibular hair cells, and developing vestibular and cochlear epithelium. Many genes linked to congenital inner ear dysfunction are confirmed to be expressed in these cell types. Additional cell-cell communication analysis within IEOs and fetal tissue highlights the role of endothelial cells on the developing sensory epithelium. These findings provide insights into this organoid model and its potential applications in studying inner ear development and disorders.

Abstract: Calmodulin (CaM) is a ubiquitous, calcium-sensing protein that regulates a multitude of processes throughout the body. In response to changes in [Ca2+], CaM modifies, activates, and deactivates enzymes and ion channels, as well as many other cellular processes. The importance of CaM is highlighted by the conservation of an identical amino acid sequence in all mammals. Alterations to CaM amino acid sequence were once thought to be incompatible with life. During the last decade modifications to the CaM protein sequence have been observed in patients suffering from life-threatening heart disease (calmodulinopathy). Thus far, inadequate or untimely interaction between mutant CaM and several proteins (LTCC, RyR2, and CaMKII) have been identified as mechanisms underlying calmodulinopathy. Given the extensive number of CaM interactions in the body, there are likely many consequences for altering CaM protein sequence. Here, we demonstrate that disease-associated CaM mutations alter the sensitivity and activity of the Ca2+-CaM-enhanced serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin (CaN). Biophysical characterization by circular dichroism, solution NMR spectroscopy, stopped-flow kinetic measurements, and MD simulations provide mechanistic insight into mutation dysfunction as well as highlight important aspects of CaM Ca2+ signal transduction. We find that individual CaM point mutations (N53I, F89L, D129G, and F141L) impair CaN function, however, the mechanisms are not the same. Specifically, individual point mutations can influence or modify the following properties: CaM binding, Ca2+ binding, and/or Ca2+kinetics. Moreover, structural aspects of the CaNCaM complex can be altered in manners that indicate changes to allosteric transmission of CaM binding to the enzyme active site. Given that loss of CaN function can be fatal, as well as evidence that CaN modifies ion channels already associated with calmodulinopathy, our results raise the possibility that altered CaN function contributes to calmodulinopathy.

Abstract: Summary
High blood pressure (BP) is the major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Genome-wide association studies have identified genetic variants for BP, but functional insights into causality and related molecular mechanisms lag behind. We functionally characterize 4,608 genetic variants in linkage with 135 BP loci in vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes by massively parallel reporter assays. High densities of regulatory variants at BP loci (i.e., ULK4, MAP4, CFDP1, PDE5A) indicate that multiple variants drive genetic association. Regulatory variants are enriched in repeats, alter cardiovascular-related transcription factor motifs, and spatially converge with genes controlling specific cardiovascular pathways. Using heuristic scoring, we define likely causal variants, and CRISPR prime editing finally determines causal variants for KCNK9, SFXN2, and PCGF6, which are candidates for developing high BP. Our systems-level approach provides a catalog of functionally relevant variants and their genomic architecture in two trait-relevant cell lines for a better understanding of BP gene regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Translation is the process by which ribosomes synthesize proteins. Ribosome profiling recently revealed that many short sequences previously thought to be noncoding are pervasively translated. To identify protein-coding genes in this noncanonical translatome, we combine an integrative framework for extremely sensitive ribosome profiling analysis, iRibo, with high-powered selection inferences tailored for short sequences. We construct a reference translatome for Saccharomyces cerevisiae comprising 5,400 canonical and almost 19,000 noncanonical translated elements. Only 14 noncanonical elements were evolving under detectable purifying selection. A representative subset of translated elements lacking signatures of selection demonstrated involvement in processes including DNA repair, stress response, and post-transcriptional regulation. Our results suggest that most translated elements are not conserved protein-coding genes and contribute to genotype-phenotype relationships through fast-evolving molecular mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
BRCA1 and BRCA2 both function in DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination (HR). Due to their HR defect, BRCA1/2-deficient cancers are sensitive to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPis), but they eventually acquire resistance. Preclinical studies yielded several PARPi resistance mechanisms that do not involve BRCA1/2 reactivation, but their relevance in the clinic remains elusive. To investigate which BRCA1/2-independent mechanisms drive spontaneous resistance in vivo, we combine molecular profiling with functional analysis of HR of matched PARPi-naive and PARPi-resistant mouse mammary tumors harboring large intragenic deletions that prevent reactivation of BRCA1/2. We observe restoration of HR in 62% of PARPi-resistant BRCA1-deficient tumors but none in the PARPi-resistant BRCA2-deficient tumors. Moreover, we find that 53BP1 loss is the prevalent resistance mechanism in HR-proficient BRCA1-deficient tumors, whereas resistance in BRCA2-deficient tumors is mainly induced by PARG loss. Furthermore, combined multi-omics analysis identifies additional genes and pathways potentially involved in modulating PARPi response.

Abstract: Summary
Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy can induce complete responses in mismatch repair-deficient and microsatellite instability-high (d-MMR/MSI-H) colorectal cancers (CRCs). However, the underlying mechanism for pathological complete response (pCR) to immunotherapy has not been completely understood. We utilize single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to investigate the dynamics of immune and stromal cells in 19 patients with d-MMR/MSI-H CRC who received neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade. We found that in tumors with pCR, there is a concerted decrease in CD8+ Trm-mitotic, CD4+ Tregs, proinflammatory IL1B+ Mono and CCL2+ Fibroblast following treatment, while the proportions of CD8+ Tem, CD4+ Th, CD20+ B, and HLA-DRA+ Endothelial cells increase. Proinflammatory features in the tumor microenvironment mediate the persistence of residual tumors by modulating CD8+ T cells and other response-associated immune cell populations. Our study provides valuable resources and biological insights into the mechanism of successful ICI therapy and potential targets for improving treatment efficacy.

Abstract: Ischemic stroke seriously endangers human health and even death. This study aimed to investigate the role of KLF10/CTRP3 in oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R)-induced brain microvascular endothelial cells injury, as well as the regulatory effects of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. OGD/R-induced human microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs) were used to simulate the model of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. The expression of KLF10/CTRP3 in OGD/R-induced hBMECs as well as the transfection efficiency were all detected by RT-qPCR and western blot. The interaction of KLF10 and CTRP3 was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). The viability, apoptosis and endothelial permeability of OGD/R-induced hBMECs was detected by CCK-8, TUNEL and FITC-Dextran assay kit. The capacity of cell migration was assessed by wound healing assay. The expression of apoptosis related proteins, oxidative stress levels and tight junction proteins was also detected. As a result, the expression of KLF10 was increased in OGD/R-induced hBMECs and downregulation of KLF10 could promote the viability, migration and suppress the apoptosis, oxidative stress and endothelial permeability by downregulating the expression of caspase 3, Bax, cleaved PARP, ROS, MDA, and upregulating the expression of Bcl-2, SOD, GSH-Px, ZO-1, occludin, claudin-5. Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway was inhibited in OGD/R-induced hBMECs, which was activated by downregulation of KLF10. KLF10 was demonstrated to be combined with CTRP3 and KLF10 inhibited transcription of CTRP3 in hBMECs. The above changes affected by downregulation of KLF10 could be reversed by the interference with CTRP3. In conclusion, KLF10 knockdown improved OGD/R-induced brain microvascular endothelial cell injury and barrier dysfunction through the activation of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, which was weakened by the downregulation of CTRP3.

Abstract: Summary
Glioblastoma (GBM) recurrence originates from invasive margin cells that escape surgical debulking, but to what extent these cells resemble their bulk counterparts remains unclear. Here, we generated three immunocompetent somatic GBM mouse models, driven by subtype-associated mutations, to compare matched bulk and margin cells. We find that, regardless of mutations, tumors converge on common sets of neural-like cellular states. However, bulk and margin have distinct biology. Injury-like programs associated with immune infiltration dominate in the bulk, leading to the generation of lowly proliferative injured neural progenitor-like cells (iNPCs). iNPCs account for a significant proportion of dormant GBM cells and are induced by interferon signaling within T cell niches. In contrast, developmental-like trajectories are favored within the immune-cold margin microenvironment resulting in differentiation toward invasive astrocyte-like cells. These findings suggest that the regional tumor microenvironment dominantly controls GBM cell fate and biological vulnerabilities identified in the bulk may not extend to the margin residuum.

Abstract: Dishevelled family proteins (DVL1–3), key scaffold proteins, act on canonical and non-canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. DVL has been implicated in various tumor progression. However, its role and underlying mechanisms in gastric cancer (GC) remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of DVL in GC development using cell lines and 209 GC specimens. We analyzed three orthologs of DVL in GC tissues and paired adjacent non-tumor tissues, and only DVL2 is highly expressed in GC tissues. We also analyzed clinicopathological data on DVL2 expression in gastric cancer specimens. In immunohistochemistry, DVL2 expression was up-regulated in GC tissues compared with paired adjacent non-tumor tissues (153/209, 73.2%). DVL2 expression level was significantly correlated with many clinicopathological parameters such as T stage (P < 0.001) and N stage (P < 0.001). Survival analysis showed that the overall survival (OS) of patients with high expression of DVL2 was significantly shorter than those with low expression. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that DVL2 expression was an important and independent prognostic factor for gastric cancer patients (P = 0.011, HR=1.78, 95%CI (1.14–2.79). Depletion of endogenous DVL2 using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) inhibited GC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. The abnormal activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is mainly achieved through the abnormal expression of DVL2. DVL2 is highly expressed in gastric cancer tissues, which may be a new independent risk factor for the prognosis of gastric cancer patients. In gastric cancer, DVL2 overexpression plays a crucial role in the occurrence and development of gastric cancer, so it may become a new, effective and complementary therapeutic target for gastric cancer.

Abstract: Summary
During childhood, neural systems supporting high-level cognitive processes undergo periods of rapid growth and refinement, which rely on the successful coordination of activation across the brain. Some coordination occurs via cortical hubs—brain regions that coactivate with functional networks other than their own. Adult cortical hubs map into three distinct profiles, but less is known about hub categories during development, when critical improvement in cognition occurs. We identify four distinct hub categories in a large youth sample (n = 567, ages 8.5–17.2), each exhibiting more diverse connectivity profiles than adults. Youth hubs integrating control-sensory processing split into two distinct categories (visual control and auditory/motor control), whereas adult hubs unite under one. This split suggests a need for segregating sensory stimuli while functional networks are experiencing rapid development. Functional coactivation strength for youth control-processing hubs are associated with task performance, suggesting a specialized role in routing sensory information to and from the brain’s control system.

Abstract: Summary
Rhythmic flicker stimulation has gained interest as a treatment for neurodegenerative diseases and as a method for frequency tagging neural activity. Yet, little is known about the way in which flicker-induced synchronization propagates across cortical levels and impacts different cell types. Here, we use Neuropixels to record from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), the primary visual cortex (V1), and CA1 in mice while presenting visual flicker stimuli. LGN neurons show strong phase locking up to 40 Hz, whereas phase locking is substantially weaker in V1 and is absent in CA1. Laminar analyses reveal an attenuation of phase locking at 40 Hz for each processing stage. Gamma-rhythmic flicker predominantly entrains fast-spiking interneurons. Optotagging experiments show that these neurons correspond to either parvalbumin (PV+) or narrow-waveform somatostatin (Sst+) neurons. A computational model can explain the observed differences based on the neurons’ capacitative low-pass filtering properties. In summary, the propagation of synchronized activity and its effect on distinct cell types strongly depend on its frequency.

Abstract: Summary
Biomolecular condensation underlies the biogenesis of an expanding array of membraneless assemblies, including stress granules (SGs), which form under a variety of cellular stresses. Advances have been made in understanding the molecular grammar of a few scaffold proteins that make up these phases, but how the partitioning of hundreds of SG proteins is regulated remains largely unresolved. While investigating the rules that govern the condensation of ataxin-2, an SG protein implicated in neurodegenerative disease, we unexpectedly identified a short 14 aa sequence that acts as a condensation switch and is conserved across the eukaryote lineage. We identify poly(A)-binding proteins as unconventional RNA-dependent chaperones that control this regulatory switch. Our results uncover a hierarchy of cis and trans interactions that fine-tune ataxin-2 condensation and reveal an unexpected molecular function for ancient poly(A)-binding proteins as regulators of biomolecular condensate proteins. These findings may inspire approaches to therapeutically target aberrant phases in disease.

Abstract: Summary
Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have uncovered numerous trait-associated loci across the human genome, most of which are located in noncoding regions, making interpretation difficult. Moreover, causal variants are hard to statistically fine-map at many loci because of widespread linkage disequilibrium. To address this challenge, we present a strategy utilizing transcription factor (TF) binding quantitative trait loci (bQTLs) for colocalization analysis to identify trait associations likely mediated by TF occupancy variation and to pinpoint likely causal variants using motif scores. We applied this approach to PU.1 bQTLs in lymphoblastoid cell lines and blood cell trait GWAS data. Colocalization analysis revealed 69 blood cell trait GWAS loci putatively driven by PU.1 occupancy variation. We nominate PU.1 motif-altering variants as the likely shared causal variants at 51 loci. Such integration of TF bQTL data with other GWAS data may reveal transcriptional regulatory mechanisms and causal noncoding variants underlying additional complex traits.

Abstract: Summary
Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis may improve early-stage breast cancer treatment via non-invasive tumor burden assessment. To investigate subtype-specific differences in the clinical significance and biology of ctDNA shedding, we perform serial personalized ctDNA analysis in hormone receptor (HR)-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in the I-SPY2 trial. ctDNA positivity rates before, during, and after NAC are higher in TNBC than in HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer patients. Early clearance of ctDNA 3 weeks after treatment initiation predicts a favorable response to NAC in TNBC only. Whereas ctDNA positivity associates with reduced distant recurrence-free survival in both subtypes. Conversely, ctDNA negativity after NAC correlates with improved outcomes, even in patients with extensive residual cancer. Pretreatment tumor mRNA profiling reveals associations between ctDNA shedding and cell cycle and immune-associated signaling. On the basis of these findings, the I-SPY2 trial will prospectively test ctDNA for utility in redirecting therapy to improve response and prognosis.

Abstract: Summary
Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 is a foodborne pathogen that specifically colonizes and infects the human large intestine. EHEC O157:H7 engages intricate regulatory pathways to detect host intestinal signals and regulate virulence-related gene expression during colonization and infection. However, the overall EHEC O157:H7 virulence regulatory network in the human large intestine remains incompletely understood. Here, we report a complete signal regulatory pathway where the EvgSA two-component system responds to high-nicotinamide levels produced by microbiota in the large intestine and directly activates loci of enterocyte effacement genes to promote EHEC O157:H7 adherence and colonization. This EvgSA-mediated nicotinamide signaling regulatory pathway is conserved and widespread among several other EHEC serotypes. Moreover, disruption of this virulence-regulating pathway by the deletion of evgS or evgA significantly decreased EHEC O157:H7 adherence and colonization in the mouse intestinal tract, indicating that these genes could be potential targets for the development of new therapeutics for EHEC O157:H7 infection.

However, adipocyte FASN knockout (KO) increases acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) and malonyl-CoA in addition to depletion of palmitate. We explore which of these metabolite changes triggers adipose browning by generating eight adipose-selective KO mouse models with loss of ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), ACC2, malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD) or FASN, or dual KOs ACLY/FASN, ACC1/FASN, and ACC2/FASN. Preventing elevation of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA by depletion of adipocyte ACLY or ACC1 in combination with FASN KO does not block the browning of iWAT. Conversely, elevating malonyl-CoA levels in MCD KO mice does not induce browning. Strikingly, adipose ACC1 KO induces a strong iWAT thermogenic response similar to FASN KO while also blocking malonyl-CoA and palmitate synthesis. Thus, ACC1 and FASN are strong suppressors of adipocyte thermogenesis through promoting lipid synthesis rather than modulating the DNL intermediates acetyl-CoA or malonyl-CoA.

Abstract: Summary
Control of dynamical processes is vital for maintaining correct cell regulation and cell-fate decisions. Numerous regulatory networks show oscillatory behavior; however, our knowledge of how one oscillator behaves when stimulated by two or more external oscillatory signals is still missing. We explore this problem by constructing a synthetic oscillatory system in yeast and stimulate it with two external oscillatory signals. Letting model verification and prediction operate in a tight interplay with experimental observations, we find that stimulation with two external signals expands the plateau of entrainment and reduces the fluctuations of oscillations. Furthermore, by adjusting the phase differences of external signals, one can control the amplitude of oscillations, which is understood through the signal delay of the unperturbed oscillatory network. With this we reveal a direct amplitude dependency of downstream gene transcription. Taken together, these results suggest a new path to control oscillatory systems by coupled oscillator cooperativity.

Abstract: Summary
Age-associated neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases are mainly caused by protein aggregation. The etiologies of these neurodegenerative diseases share a chemical environment. However, how chemical cues modulate neurodegeneration remains unclear. Here, we found that in Caenorhabditis elegans, exposure to pheromones in the L1 stage accelerates neurodegeneration in adults. Perception of pheromones ascr#3 and ascr#10 is mediated by chemosensory neurons ASK and ASI. ascr#3 perceived by G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) DAF-38 in ASK activates glutamatergic transmission into AIA interneurons. ascr#10 perceived by GPCR STR-2 in ASI activates the secretion of neuropeptide NLP-1, which binds to the NPR-11 receptor in AIA. Activation of both ASI and ASK is required and sufficient to remodel neurodevelopment via AIA, which triggers insulin-like signaling and inhibits autophagy in adult neurons non-cell-autonomously. Our work reveals how pheromone perception at the early developmental stage modulates neurodegeneration in adults and provides insights into how the external environment impacts neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Non-native conformations drive protein-misfolding diseases, complicate bioengineering efforts, and fuel molecular evolution. No current experimental technique is well suited for elucidating them and their phenotypic effects. Especially intractable are the transient conformations populated by intrinsically disordered proteins. We describe an approach to systematically discover, stabilize, and purify native and non-native conformations, generated in vitro or in vivo, and directly link conformations to molecular, organismal, or evolutionary phenotypes. This approach involves high-throughput disulfide scanning (HTDS) of the entire protein. To reveal which disulfides trap which chromatographically resolvable conformers, we devised a deep-sequencing method for double-Cys variant libraries of proteins that precisely and simultaneously locates both Cys residues within each polypeptide. HTDS of the abundant E. coli periplasmic chaperone HdeA revealed distinct classes of disordered hydrophobic conformers with variable cytotoxicity depending on where the backbone was cross-linked. HTDS can bridge conformational and phenotypic landscapes for many proteins that function in disulfide-permissive environments.

Abstract: Summary
Inherited bone marrow failure associated with heterozygous mutations in GATA2 predisposes toward hematological malignancies, but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the mechanistic basis of marrow failure in a zebrafish model of GATA2 deficiency. Single-cell transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility assays reveal that loss of gata2a leads to skewing toward the erythroid lineage at the expense of myeloid cells, associated with loss of cebpa expression and decreased PU.1 and CEBPA transcription factor accessibility in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Furthermore, gata2a mutants show impaired expression of npm1a, the zebrafish NPM1 ortholog. Progressive loss of npm1a in HSPCs is associated with elevated levels of DNA damage in gata2a mutants. Thus, Gata2a maintains myeloid lineage priming through cebpa and protects against genome instability and marrow failure by maintaining expression of npm1a. Our results establish a potential mechanism underlying bone marrow failure in GATA2 deficiency.

Abstract: Summary
Maternal RNAs are stored from minutes to decades in oocytes throughout meiosis I arrest in a transcriptionally quiescent state. Recent reports, however, propose a role for nascent transcription in arrested oocytes. Whether arrested oocytes launch nascent transcription in response to environmental or hormonal signals while maintaining the meiosis I arrest remains undetermined. We test this by integrating single-cell RNA sequencing, RNA velocity, and RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization on C. elegans meiosis I arrested oocytes. We identify transcripts that increase as the arrested meiosis I oocyte ages, but rule out extracellular signaling through ERK MAPK and nascent transcription as a mechanism for this increase. We report transcript acquisition from neighboring somatic cells as a mechanism of transcript increase during meiosis I arrest. These analyses provide a deeper view at single-cell resolution of the RNA landscape of a meiosis I arrested oocyte and as it prepares for oocyte maturation and fertilization.

Abstract: Summary
Disseminated cancer cells (DCCs) in secondary organs can remain dormant for years to decades before reactivating into overt metastasis. Microenvironmental signals leading to cancer cell chromatin remodeling and transcriptional reprogramming appear to control onset and escape from dormancy. Here, we reveal that the therapeutic combination of the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine (AZA) and the retinoic acid receptor ligands all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) or AM80, an RARα-specific agonist, promotes stable dormancy in cancer cells. Treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) or breast cancer cells with AZA+atRA induces a SMAD2/3/4-dependent transcriptional program that restores transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)-signaling and anti-proliferative function. Significantly, either combination, AZA+atRA or AZA+AM80, strongly suppresses HNSCC lung metastasis formation by inducing and maintaining solitary DCCs in a SMAD4+/NR2F1+ non-proliferative state. Notably, SMAD4 knockdown is sufficient to drive resistance to AZA+atRA-induced dormancy. We conclude that therapeutic doses of AZA and RAR agonists may induce and/or maintain dormancy and significantly limit metastasis development.

Abstract: Summary
Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common degenerative disorder, affecting approximately half of the elderly population. In this study, we find that the expressions of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) IGFBP7-OT and its maternal gene, IGFBP7, are upregulated and positively correlated in osteoarthritic cartilage. Overexpression of IGFBP7-OT significantly inhibits chondrocyte viability, promotes chondrocyte apoptosis, and reduces extracellular matrix components, whereas IGFBP7-OT knockdown has the opposite effects. IGFBP7-OT overexpression promotes cartilage degeneration and markedly aggravates the monosodium iodoacetate-induced OA phenotype in vivo. Further mechanistic research reveals that IGFBP7-OT promotes OA progression by upregulating IGFBP7 expression. Specifically, IGFBP7-OT suppresses the occupancy of DNMT1 and DNMT3a on the IGFBP7 promoter, thereby inhibiting methylation of the IGFBP7 promoter. The upregulation of IGFBP7-OT in OA is partially controlled by METTL3-mediated N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification. Collectively, our findings reveal that m6A modification of IGFBP7-OT promotes OA progression by regulating the DNMT1/DNMT3a-IGFBP7 axis and provide a potential therapeutical target for OA treatment.

Co-option of endogenous retroviruses through genetic escape from TRIM28 repression,

Abstract: Summary
Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) have rewired host gene networks. To explore the origins of co-option, we employed an active murine ERV, IAPEz, and an embryonic stem cell (ESC) to neural progenitor cell (NPC) differentiation model. Transcriptional silencing via TRIM28 maps to a 190 bp sequence encoding the intracisternal A-type particle (IAP) signal peptide, which confers retrotransposition activity. A subset of “escapee” IAPs (∼15%) exhibits significant genetic divergence from this sequence. Canonical repressed IAPs succumb to a previously undocumented demarcation by H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 in NPCs. Escapee IAPs, in contrast, evade repression in both cell types, resulting in their transcriptional derepression, particularly in NPCs. We validate the enhancer function of a 47 bp sequence within the U3 region of the long terminal repeat (LTR) and show that escapee IAPs convey an activating effect on nearby neural genes. In sum, co-opted ERVs stem from genetic escapees that have lost vital sequences required for both TRIM28 restriction and autonomous retrotransposition.

Abstract: Summary
Altered hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) fate underlies primary blood disorders but microenvironmental factors controlling this are poorly understood. Genetically barcoded genome editing of synthetic target arrays for lineage tracing (GESTALT) zebrafish were used to screen for factors expressed by the sinusoidal vascular niche that alter the phylogenetic distribution of the HSC pool under native conditions. Dysregulated expression of protein kinase C delta (PKC-δ, encoded by prkcda) increases the number of HSC clones by up to 80% and expands polyclonal populations of immature neutrophil and erythroid precursors. PKC agonists such as cxcl8 augment HSC competition for residency within the niche and expand defined niche populations. CXCL8 induces association of PKC-δ with the focal adhesion complex, activating extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling and expression of niche factors in human endothelial cells. Our findings demonstrate the existence of reserve capacity within the niche that is controlled by CXCL8 and PKC and has significant impact on HSC phylogenetic and phenotypic fate.

Abstract: Summary
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron subvariants have seriously attacked the antibody barrier established by natural infection and/or vaccination, especially the recently emerged BQ.1.1 and XBB.1. However, crucial mechanisms underlying the virus escape and the broad neutralization remain elusive. Here, we present a panoramic analysis of broadly neutralizing activity and binding epitopes of 75 monoclonal antibodies isolated from prototype inactivated vaccinees. Nearly all neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) partly or totally lose their neutralization against BQ.1.1 and XBB.1. We report a broad nAb, VacBB-551, that effectively neutralizes all tested subvariants including BA.2.75, BQ.1.1, and XBB.1. We determine the cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of VacBB-551 complexed with the BA.2 spike and perform detailed functional verification to reveal the molecular basis of N460K and F486V/S mutations mediating the partial escape of BA.2.75, BQ.1.1, and XBB.1 from the neutralization of VacBB-551. Overall, BQ.1.1 and XBB.1 raised the alarm over SARS-CoV-2 evolution with unprecedented antibody evasion from broad nAbs elicited by prototype vaccination.

Abstract: Macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions accumulate large amounts of unesterified cholesterol. Excess cholesterol load leads to cell death of macrophages, which is associated with the progression of atherosclerotic lesions. Calcium depletion in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and subsequent pro-apoptotic aberrant calcium signaling are key events in cholesterol-induced macrophage death. Although these concepts imply cytoplasmic calcium events in cholesterol-loaded macrophages, the mechanisms linking cholesterol accumulation to cytoplasmic calcium response have been poorly investigated. Based on our previous finding that extracellularly applied cholesterol evoked robust calcium oscillations in astrocytes, a type of glial cells in the brain, we hypothesized that cholesterol accumulation in macrophages triggers cytoplasmic calcium elevation. Here, we showed that cholesterol application induces calcium transients in THP-1-derived and peritoneal macrophages. Inhibition of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) and l-type calcium channels (LTCCs) prevented cholesterol-induced calcium transients and ameliorated cholesterol-induced macrophage death. These results suggest that cholesterol-induced calcium transients through IP3Rs and LTCCs are crucial mechanisms underlying cholesterol-induced cell death of macrophages.

Abstract: Extensive communication at the stem cell-niche interface and asymmetric stem cell division is key for the homeostasis of the Drosophila male germline stem cell system. To improve our understanding of these processes, we analysed the function of the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) component Bub3 and the nucleoporin Nup75, a component of the nuclear pore complex realizing the transport of signalling effector molecules to the nucleus, in the Drosophila testis. By lineage-specific interference, we found that the two genes control germline development and maintenance. Bub3 is continuously required in the germline, as its loss results in the beginning in an over-proliferation of early germ cells and later on in loss of the germline. The absence of the germline lineage in such testes has dramatic cell non-autonomous consequences, as cells co-expressing markers of hub and somatic cyst cell fates accumulate and populate in extreme cases the whole testis. Our analysis of Nups showed that some of them are critical for lineage maintenance, as their depletion results in the loss of the affected lineage. In contrast, Nup75 plays a role in controlling proliferation of early germ cells but not differentiating spermatogonia and seems to be involved in keeping hub cells quiescent. In sum, our analysis shows that Bub3 and Nup75 are required for male germline development and maintenance.

Abstract: Summary
The complex functions of neuronal synapses depend on their tightly interconnected protein network, and their dysregulation is implicated in the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. However, it remains unclear how synaptic molecular networks are altered biochemically in these disorders. Here, we apply multiplexed imaging to probe the effects of RNAi knockdown of 16 autism- and schizophrenia-associated genes on the simultaneous joint distribution of 10 synaptic proteins, observing several protein composition phenotypes associated with these risk genes. We apply Bayesian network analysis to infer hierarchical dependencies among eight excitatory synaptic proteins, yielding predictive relationships that can only be accessed with single-synapse, multiprotein measurements performed simultaneously in situ. Finally, we find that central features of the network are affected similarly across several distinct gene knockdowns. These results offer insight into the convergent molecular etiology of these widespread disorders and provide a general framework to probe subcellular molecular networks.

Abstract: Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) are large tetrameric channels which sit mostly in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mediate Ca2+ release from intracellular stores in response to extracellular stimuli in almost all cells. Dual regulation of IP3Rs by IP3 and Ca2+ itself, upstream “licensing”, and the arrangement of IP3Rs into small clusters in the ER membrane, allow IP3Rs to generate spatially and temporally diverse Ca2+ signals. The characteristic biphasic regulation of IP3Rs by cytosolic Ca2+ concentration underpins regenerative Ca2+ signals by Ca2+-induced Ca2+-release, while also preventing uncontrolled explosive Ca2+ release. In this way, cells can harness a simple ion such as Ca2+ as a near-universal intracellular messenger to regulate diverse cellular functions, including those with conflicting outcomes such as cell survival and cell death. High-resolution structures of the IP3R bound to IP3 and Ca2+ in different combinations have together started to unravel the workings of this giant channel. Here we discuss, in the context of recently published structures, how the tight regulation of IP3Rs and their cellular geography lead to generation of “elementary” local Ca2+ signals known as Ca2+ “puffs”, which form the fundamental bottleneck through which all IP3-mediated cytosolic Ca2+ signals must first pass.

Abstract: Summary
Amplification of MDM2 on supernumerary chromosomes is a common mechanism of P53 inactivation across tumors. Here, we investigated the impact of MDM2 overexpression on chromatin, gene expression, and cellular phenotypes in liposarcoma. Three independent regulatory circuits predominate in aggressive, dedifferentiated tumors. RUNX and AP-1 family transcription factors bind mesenchymal gene enhancers. P53 and MDM2 co-occupy enhancers and promoters associated with P53 signaling. When highly expressed, MDM2 also binds thousands of P53-independent growth and stress response genes, whose promoters engage in multi-way topological interactions. Overexpressed MDM2 concentrates within nuclear foci that co-localize with PML and YY1 and could also contribute to P53-independent phenotypes associated with supraphysiologic MDM2. Importantly, we observe striking cell-to-cell variability in MDM2 copy number and expression in tumors and models. Whereas liposarcoma cells are generally sensitive to MDM2 inhibitors and their combination with pro-apoptotic drugs, MDM2-high cells tolerate them and may underlie the poor clinical efficacy of these agents.

Abstract: Summary
Single-cell transcriptomic platforms provide an opportunity to map an organism’s response to environmental cues with high resolution. Here, we applied single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to establish the tissue and cell type-resolved transcriptome of the adult C. elegans and characterize the inter- and trans-generational transcriptional impact of ethanol. We profiled the transcriptome of 41,749 nuclei resolving into 31 clusters, representing a diverse array of adult cell types including syncytial tissues. Following exposure to human-relevant doses of alcohol, several germline, striated muscle, and neuronal clusters were identified as being the most transcriptionally impacted at the F1 and F3 generations. The effect on germline clusters was confirmed by phenotypic enrichment analysis as well as by functional validation, which revealed a remarkable inter- and trans-generational increase in germline apoptosis, aneuploidy, and embryonic lethality. Together, snRNA-seq represents a valuable approach for the detailed examination of an adult organism’s response to environmental exposures.

Abstract: Summary
It is challenging to apply traditional mutational scanning to voltage-gated sodium channels (NaVs) and functionally annotate the large number of coding variants in these genes. Using a cytosine base editor and a pooled viability assay, we screen a library of 368 guide RNAs (gRNAs) tiling NaV1.2 to identify more than 100 gRNAs that change NaV1.2 function. We sequence base edits made by a subset of these gRNAs to confirm specific variants that drive changes in channel function. Electrophysiological characterization of these channel variants validates the screen results and provides functional mechanisms of channel perturbation. Most of the changes caused by these gRNAs are classifiable as loss of function along with two missense mutations that lead to gain of function in NaV1.2 channels. This two-tiered strategy to functionally characterize ion channel protein variants at scale identifies a large set of loss-of-function mutations in NaV1.2.

Abstract: Summary
Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists promote nicotine avoidance. Here, we show that the crosstalk between GLP-1 and nicotine extends beyond effects on nicotine self-administration and can be exploited pharmacologically to amplify the anti-obesity effects of both signals. Accordingly, combined treatment with nicotine and the GLP-1R agonist, liraglutide, inhibits food intake and increases energy expenditure to lower body weight in obese mice. Co-treatment with nicotine and liraglutide gives rise to neuronal activity in multiple brain regions, and we demonstrate that GLP-1R agonism increases excitability of hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons and dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Further, using a genetically encoded dopamine sensor, we reveal that liraglutide suppresses nicotine-induced dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens in freely behaving mice. These data support the pursuit of GLP-1R-based therapies for nicotine dependence and encourage further evaluation of combined treatment with GLP-1R agonists and nicotinic receptor agonists for weight loss.

Abstract: Summary
Mitophagy plays an important role in mitochondrial homeostasis by selective degradation of mitochondria. During mitophagy, mitochondria should be fragmented to allow engulfment within autophagosomes, whose capacity is exceeded by the typical mitochondria mass. However, the known mitochondrial fission factors, dynamin-related proteins Dnm1 in yeasts and DNM1L/Drp1 in mammals, are dispensable for mitophagy. Here, we identify Atg44 as a mitochondrial fission factor that is essential for mitophagy in yeasts, and we therefore term Atg44 and its orthologous proteins mitofissin. In mitofissin-deficient cells, a part of the mitochondria is recognized by the mitophagy machinery as cargo but cannot be enwrapped by the autophagosome precursor, the phagophore, due to a lack of mitochondrial fission. Furthermore, we show that mitofissin directly binds to lipid membranes and brings about lipid membrane fragility to facilitate membrane fission. Taken together, we propose that mitofissin acts directly on lipid membranes to drive mitochondrial fission required for mitophagy.

Abstract: Summary
Dravet syndrome (DS) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by loss-of-function variants in SCN1A, which encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel subunit Nav1.1. We recently showed that neocortical vasoactive intestinal peptide interneurons (VIP-INs) express Nav1.1 and are hypoexcitable in DS (Scn1a+/−) mice. Here, we investigate VIP-IN function at the circuit and behavioral level by performing in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging in awake wild-type (WT) and Scn1a+/− mice. VIP-IN and pyramidal neuron activation during behavioral transition from quiet wakefulness to active running is diminished in Scn1a+/− mice, and optogenetic activation of VIP-INs restores pyramidal neuron activity to WT levels during locomotion. VIP-IN selective Scn1a deletion reproduces core autism-spectrum-disorder-related behaviors in addition to cellular- and circuit-level deficits in VIP-IN function, but without epilepsy, sudden death, or avoidance behaviors seen in the global model. Hence, VIP-INs are impaired in vivo, which may underlie non-seizure cognitive and behavioral comorbidities in DS.

Abstract: Summary
During bloodstream infections, neutrophils home to the liver as part of an intravascular immune response to eradicate blood-borne pathogens, but the mechanisms regulating this crucial response are unknown. Using in vivo imaging of neutrophil trafficking in germ-free and gnotobiotic mice, we demonstrate that the intestinal microbiota guides neutrophil homing to the liver in response to infection mediated by the microbial metabolite D-lactate. Commensal-derived D-lactate augments neutrophil adhesion in the liver independent of granulopoiesis in bone marrow or neutrophil maturation and activation in blood. Instead, gut-to-liver D-lactate signaling primes liver endothelial cells to upregulate adhesion molecule expression in response to infection and promote neutrophil adherence. Targeted correction of microbiota D-lactate production in a model of antibiotic-induced dysbiosis restores neutrophil homing to the liver and reduces bacteremia in a model of Staphylococcus aureus infection. These findings reveal long-distance traffic control of neutrophil recruitment to the liver by microbiota-endothelium crosstalk.

Abstract: Summary
The one-carbon metabolism enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2 (MTHFD2) is involved in the regulation of tumor oncogenesis and immune cell functions, but whether it can contribute to macrophage polarization remains elusive. Here, we show that MTHFD2 suppresses polarization of interferon-γ-activated macrophages (M(IFN-γ)) but enhances that of interleukin-4-activated macrophages (M(IL-4)) both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, MTHFD2 interacts with phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) to suppress PTEN’s phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) phosphatase activity and enhance downstream Akt activation, independent of the N-terminal mitochondria-targeting signal of MTHFD2. MTHFD2-PTEN interaction is promoted by IL-4 but not IFN-γ. Furthermore, amino acid residues (aa 215–225) of MTHFD2 directly target PTEN catalytic center (aa 118–141). Residue D168 of MTHFD2 is also critical for regulating PTEN’s PIP3 phosphatase activity by affecting MTHFD2-PTEN interaction. Our study suggests a non-metabolic function of MTHFD2 by which MTHFD2 inhibits PTEN activity, orchestrates macrophage polarization, and alters macrophage-mediated immune responses.

Abstract: Summary
Aging results in a decline in neural stem cells (NSCs), neurogenesis, and cognitive function, and evidence is emerging to demonstrate disrupted adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus of patients with several neurodegenerative disorders. Here, single-cell RNA sequencing of the dentate gyrus of young and old mice shows that the mitochondrial protein folding stress is prominent in activated NSCs/neural progenitors (NPCs) among the neurogenic niche, and it increases with aging accompanying dysregulated cell cycle and mitochondrial activity in activated NSCs/NPCs in the dentate gyrus. Increasing mitochondrial protein folding stress results in compromised NSC maintenance and reduced neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus, neural hyperactivity, and impaired cognitive function. Reducing mitochondrial protein folding stress in the dentate gyrus of old mice improves neurogenesis and cognitive function. These results establish the mitochondrial protein folding stress as a driver of NSC aging and suggest approaches to improve aging-associated cognitive decline.

Abstract: Ferroptosis is a newly found form of non-apoptotic regulated cell death that is essential for the advancement of cancer. Tiliroside (Til), an effective natural flavonoid glycoside of oriental paperbush flower, has been explored as a potential anticancer agent in a few cancer types. However, it is unclear whether and how Til could promote the death of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells by inducing ferroptosis. Our study determined that Til induced cell death and attenuated cell proliferation in TNBC cells in vitro and in vivo with less toxicity for the first time. Functional assays showed that ferroptosis was the predominant form that contributed to Til-induced cell death of TNBC. Mechanistically, Til induces ferroptosis of TNBC cells via independent PUFA-PLS pathways but is closely involved in the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. Silencing of HO-1 substantially abrogated the tumor-inhibiting effects of Til. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the natural product Til exerted its antitumor activity on TNBC by promoting ferroptosis, and the HO-1/SLC7A11 pathway plays an indispensable role in Til-induced ferroptotic cell death.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular and organismal phenotypes are controlled by complex gene regulatory networks. However, reference maps of gene function are still scarce across different organisms. Here, we generated synthetic genetic interaction and cell morphology profiles of more than 6,800 genes in cultured Drosophila cells. The resulting map of genetic interactions was used for machine learning-based gene function discovery, assigning functions to genes in 47 modules. Furthermore, we devised Cytoclass as a method to dissect genetic interactions for discrete cell states at the single-cell resolution. This approach identified an interaction of Cdk2 and the Cop9 signalosome complex, triggering senescence-associated secretory phenotypes and immunogenic conversion in hemocytic cells. Together, our data constitute a genome-scale resource of functional gene profiles to uncover the mechanisms underlying genetic interactions and their plasticity at the single-cell level.

Abstract: Summary
RNA interference (RNAi) is a well-established antiviral immunity. However, for mammalian somatic cells, antiviral RNAi becomes evident only when viral suppressors of RNAi (VSRs) are disabled by mutations or VSR-targeting drugs, thereby limiting its scope as a mammalian immunity. We find that a wild-type alphavirus, Semliki Forest virus (SFV), triggers the Dicer-dependent production of virus-derived small interfering RNAs (vsiRNAs) in both mammalian somatic cells and adult mice. These SFV-vsiRNAs are located at a particular region within the 5′ terminus of the SFV genome, Argonaute loaded, and active in conferring effective anti-SFV activity. Sindbis virus, another alphavirus, also induces vsiRNA production in mammalian somatic cells. Moreover, treatment with enoxacin, an RNAi enhancer, inhibits SFV replication dependent on RNAi response in vitro and in vivo and protects mice from SFV-induced neuropathogenesis and lethality. These findings show that alphaviruses trigger the production of active vsiRNA in mammalian somatic cells, highlighting the functional importance and therapeutic potential of antiviral RNAi in mammals.

Abstract: Summary
Recent studies have highlighted the importance of understanding the architecture and function of microvasculature, and dysfunction of these microvessels may underlie neurodegenerative disease. Here, we utilize a high-precision ultrafast laser-induced photothrombosis (PLP) method to occlude single capillaries and then quantitatively study the effects on vasodynamics and surrounding neurons. Analysis of the microvascular architecture and hemodynamics after single-capillary occlusion reveals distinct changes upstream vs. downstream branches, which shows rapid regional flow redistribution and local downstream blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage. Focal ischemia via capillary occlusions surrounding labeled target neurons induces dramatic and rapid lamina-specific changes in neuronal dendritic architecture. Further, we find that micro-occlusion at two different depths within the same vascular arbor results in distinct effects on flow profiles in layers 2/3 vs layer 4. The current results reveal laminar-scale regulation distinctions in microinfarct response and raise the possibility that relatively greater impacts on microvascular function contribute to cognitive decline in neurodegenerative disease.

Abstract: Objective
In this study, it was aimed to provide a therapeutic approach for T1DM by encapsulating the pancreatic islets with mesenchymal stem cells and decellularized pancreatic extracellular matrix to support the survival of islets while maintaining their cellular activity.
Method
Pancreatic extracellular matrix was decellularized using different concentrations of detergent series. After the preparation of the protein-based tissue extracellular matrix was shown to be free of cells or any genetic material by molecular, immunofluorescence and histochemical techniques. Following the homogenization of the decellularized pancreatic extracellular matrix and the analysis of its protein composition by LC-MS, the matrix proteins were incorporated with pancreatic islets and rat adipose tissue-derived MSCs (rAT-MSCs) in alginate microcapsules. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion property of the islet cells in the microbeads was evaluated by insulin ELISA. The gene expression profile of the encapsulated cells was analyzed by Real-Time PCR.
Results
Unlike the protein composition of whole pancreatic tissue, the decellularized pancreas matrix was free of histone proteins or proteins originated from mitochondria. The protein matrix derived from pancreatic tissue was shown to support the growth and maintenance of the islet cells. When compared to the non-encapsulated pancreatic islet, the encapsulated cells demonstrate to be more efficient in terms of insulin expression.
Conclusion
The extracellular pancreatic matrix obtained in this study was directly used as supplementary in the alginate-based microcapsule enhancing the cell survival. The tissue matrix protein and alginate had a synergistic effect on total insulin secretion, which might have the potential to overcome the insulin deficiency. Despite the improvement in the cell viability and the number, the efficiency of the insulin secretion in response to glucose stimulation from the alginate microcapsules did not meet the expectation when compared with the non-encapsulated pancreatic islets.

Abstract: Summary
Bacterial cells were long thought to be “bags of enzymes” with minimal internal structures. In recent years, membrane-less organelles formed by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of proteins or nucleic acids have been found to be involved in many important biological processes, although most of them were studied on eukaryotic cells. Here, we report that NikR, a bacterial nickel-responsive regulatory protein, exhibits LLPS both in solution and inside cells. Analyses of cellular nickel uptake and cell growth of E. coli confirm that LLPS enhances the regulatory function of NikR, while disruption of LLPS in cells promotes the expression of nickel transporter (nik) genes, which are negatively regulated by NikR. Mechanistic study shows that Ni(II) ions induces the accumulation of nik promoter DNA into the condensates formed by NikR. This result suggests that the formation of membrane-less compartments can be a regulatory mechanism of metal transporter proteins in bacterial cells.

Abstract: Summary
Ruptured ectopic pregnancy (REP), a pregnancy complication caused by aberrant implantation, deep invasion, and overgrowth of embryos in fallopian tubes, could lead to rupture of fallopian tubes and accounts for 4%–10% of pregnancy-related deaths. The lack of ectopic pregnancy phenotypes in rodents hampers our understanding of its pathological mechanisms. Here, we employed cell culture and organoid models to investigate the crosstalk between human trophoblast development and intravillous vascularization in the REP condition. Compared with abortive ectopic pregnancy (AEP), the size of REP placental villi and the depth of trophoblast invasion are correlated with the extent of intravillous vascularization. We identified a key pro-angiogenic factor secreted by trophoblasts, WNT2B, that promotes villous vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, and vascular network expansion in the REP condition. Our results reveal the important role of WNT-mediated angiogenesis and an organoid co-culture model for investigating intricate communications between trophoblasts and endothelial/endothelial progenitor cells.

Abstract: Summary
One of the major cellular mechanisms to ensure cellular protein homeostasis is the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. This pathway is triggered by accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER lumen. The ER stress response is also activated in the premature aging disease Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS). Here, we explore the mechanism of activation of the ER stress response in HGPS. We find that aggregation of the diseases-causing progerin protein at the nuclear envelope triggers ER stress. Induction of ER stress is dependent on the inner nuclear membrane protein SUN2 and its ability to cluster in the nuclear membrane. Our observations suggest that the presence of nucleoplasmic protein aggregates can be sensed, and signaled to the ER lumen, via clustering of SUN2. These results identify a mechanism of communication between the nucleus and the ER and provide insight into the molecular disease mechanisms of HGPS.

Abstract: Summary
High myopia (HM) is one of the leading causes of visual impairment and blindness worldwide. Here, we report a whole-exome sequencing (WES) study in 9,613 HM cases and 9,606 controls of Han Chinese ancestry to pinpoint HM-associated risk variants. Single-variant association analysis identified three newly identified -genetic loci associated with HM, including an East Asian ancestry-specific low-frequency variant (rs533280354) in FKBP5. Multi-ancestry meta-analysis with WES data of 2,696 HM cases and 7,186 controls of European ancestry from the UK Biobank discerned a newly identified European ancestry-specific rare variant in FOLH1. Functional experiments revealed a mechanism whereby a single G-to-A transition at rs533280354 disrupted the binding of transcription activator KLF15 to the promoter of FKBP5, resulting in decreased transcription of FKBP5. Furthermore, burden tests showed a significant excess of rare protein-truncating variants among HM cases involved in retinal blood vessel morphogenesis and neurotransmitter transport.

Abstract: Summary
DNA supercoiling has emerged as a major contributor to gene regulation in bacteria, but how DNA supercoiling impacts transcription dynamics in eukaryotes is unclear. Here, using single-molecule dual-color nascent transcription imaging in budding yeast, we show that transcriptional bursting of divergent and tandem GAL genes is coupled. Temporal coupling of neighboring genes requires rapid release of DNA supercoils by topoisomerases. When DNA supercoils accumulate, transcription of one gene inhibits transcription at its adjacent genes. Transcription inhibition of the GAL genes results from destabilized binding of the transcription factor Gal4. Moreover, wild-type yeast minimizes supercoiling-mediated inhibition by maintaining sufficient levels of topoisomerases. Overall, we discover fundamental differences in transcriptional control by DNA supercoiling between bacteria and yeast and show that rapid supercoiling release in eukaryotes ensures proper gene expression of neighboring genes.

Abstract: Summary
PERIOD (PER) and Casein Kinase 1δ regulate circadian rhythms through a phosphoswitch that controls PER stability and repressive activity in the molecular clock. CK1δ phosphorylation of the familial advanced sleep phase (FASP) serine cluster embedded within the Casein Kinase 1 binding domain (CK1BD) of mammalian PER1/2 inhibits its activity on phosphodegrons to stabilize PER and extend circadian period. Here, we show that the phosphorylated FASP region (pFASP) of PER2 directly interacts with and inhibits CK1δ. Co-crystal structures in conjunction with molecular dynamics simulations reveal how pFASP phosphoserines dock into conserved anion binding sites near the active site of CK1δ. Limiting phosphorylation of the FASP serine cluster reduces product inhibition, decreasing PER2 stability and shortening circadian period in human cells. We found that Drosophila PER also regulates CK1δ via feedback inhibition through the phosphorylated PER-Short domain, revealing a conserved mechanism by which PER phosphorylation near the CK1BD regulates CK1 kinase activity.

Abstract: Summary
The HUSH complex recognizes and silences foreign DNA such as viruses, transposons, and transgenes without prior exposure to its targets. Here, we show that endogenous targets of the HUSH complex fall into two distinct classes based on the presence or absence of H3K9me3. These classes are further distinguished by their transposon content and differential response to the loss of HUSH. A de novo genomic rearrangement at the Sox2 locus induces a switch from H3K9me3-independent to H3K9me3-associated HUSH targeting, resulting in silencing. We further demonstrate that HUSH interacts with the termination factor WDR82 and—via its component MPP8—with nascent RNA. HUSH accumulates at sites of high RNAPII occupancy including long exons and transcription termination sites in a manner dependent on WDR82 and CPSF. Together, our results uncover the functional diversity of HUSH targets and show that this vertebrate-specific complex exploits evolutionarily ancient transcription termination machinery for co-transcriptional chromatin targeting and genome surveillance.

Abstract: Lipid metabolism is believed to play an important role in cancer. This study aimed to investigate the role and possible mechanism of fatty acid transporter protein 2 (FATP2) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). FATP2 expression and its relationship with NSCLC prognosis were analyzed using the TCGA database. The si-RNA was used to intervene FATP2 in NSCLC cells, and the effects of si-FATP2 on cell proliferation, apoptosis, lipid deposition, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) morphology, and the proteins expressions of fatty acid metabolism and ER stress were analyzed. In addition, Co-IP analyzed the interaction between FATP2 and ACSL1, and further analyzed the possible mechanism of FATP2 in regulating lipid metabolism using pcDNA-ACSL1. Results found that FATP2 was overexpressed in NSCLC and associated with poor prognosis. Si-FATP2 significantly inhibited the proliferation and lipid metabolism of A549 and HCC827 cells, and induced ER stress to promote apoptosis. Further studies confirmed the protein interaction between FATP2 and ACSL1. Si-FATP2 and pcDNA-ACSL1 co-transfection further inhibit the proliferation and lipid deposition of NSCLS cells, and promote the decomposition of fatty acids. In conclusion, FATP2 promoted the progression of NSCLC by regulating lipid metabolism through ACSL1.

Abstract: Summary
Monocytes are abundant immune cells that infiltrate inflamed organs. However, the majority of monocyte studies focus on circulating cells, rather than those in tissue. Here, we identify and characterize an intravascular synovial monocyte population resembling circulating non-classical monocytes and an extravascular tissue-resident monocyte-lineage cell (TR-MC) population distinct in surface marker and transcriptional profile from circulating monocytes, dendritic cells, and tissue macrophages that are conserved in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. TR-MCs are independent of NR4A1 and CCR2, long lived, and embryonically derived. TR-MCs undergo increased proliferation and reverse diapedesis dependent on LFA1 in response to arthrogenic stimuli and are required for the development of RA-like disease. Moreover, pathways that are activated in TR-MCs at the peak of arthritis overlap with those that are downregulated in LFA1−/− TR-MCs. These findings show a facet of mononuclear cell biology that could be imperative to understanding tissue-resident myeloid cell function in RA.

Abstract: Summary
Lateral roots (LRs) are crucial for plants to sense environmental signals in addition to water and nutrient absorption. Auxin is key for LR formation, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we report that Arabidopsis ERF1 inhibits LR emergence by promoting local auxin accumulation with altered distribution and regulating auxin signaling. Loss of ERF1 increases LR density compared with the wild type, whereas ERF1 overexpression causes the opposite phenotype. ERF1 enhances auxin transport by upregulating PIN1 and AUX1, resulting in excessive auxin accumulation in the endodermal, cortical, and epidermal cells surrounding LR primordia. Furthermore, ERF1 represses ARF7 transcription, thereby downregulating the expression of cell-wall remodeling genes that facilitate LR emergence. Together, our study reveals that ERF1 integrates environmental signals to promote local auxin accumulation with altered distribution and repress ARF7, consequently inhibiting LR emergence in adaptation to fluctuating environments.

Abstract: Summary
Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) produce large amounts of type 2 cytokines including interleukin-5 (IL-5) and IL-13 in response to various stimuli, causing allergic and eosinophilic diseases. However, the cell-intrinsic regulatory mechanisms of human ILC2s remain unclear. Here, we analyze human ILC2s derived from different tissues and pathological conditions and identify ANXA1, encoding annexin A1, as a commonly highly expressed gene in non-activated ILC2s. The expression of ANXA1 decreases when ILC2s activate, but it increases autonomously as the activation subsides. Lentiviral vector-based gene transfer experiments show that ANXA1 suppresses the activation of human ILC2s. Mechanistically, ANXA1 regulates the expression of the metallothionein family genes, including MT2A, which modulate intracellular zinc homeostasis. Furthermore, increased intracellular zinc levels play an essential role in the activation of human ILC2s by promoting the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathways and GATA3 expression. Thus, the ANXA1/MT2A/zinc pathway is identified as a cell-intrinsic metalloregulatory mechanism for human ILC2s.

Abstract: Summary
Male mice lacking the androgen receptor (AR) in pancreatic β cells exhibit blunted glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), leading to hyperglycemia. Testosterone activates an extranuclear AR in β cells to amplify glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) insulinotropic action. Here, we examined the architecture of AR targets that regulate GLP-1 insulinotropic action in male β cells. Testosterone cooperates with GLP-1 to enhance cAMP production at the plasma membrane and endosomes via: (1) increased mitochondrial production of CO2, activating the HCO3−-sensitive soluble adenylate cyclase; and (2) increased Gαs recruitment to GLP-1 receptor and AR complexes, activating transmembrane adenylate cyclase. Additionally, testosterone enhances GSIS in human islets via a focal adhesion kinase/SRC/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 actin remodeling cascade. We describe the testosterone-stimulated AR interactome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome that contribute to these effects. This study identifies AR genomic and non-genomic actions that enhance GLP-1-stimulated insulin exocytosis in male β cells.

Abstract: Summary
Locoregional monotherapy with heterodimeric interleukin (IL)-15 (hetIL-15) in a triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) orthotopic mouse model resulted in tumor eradication in 40% of treated mice, reduction of metastasis, and induction of immunological memory against breast cancer cells. hetIL-15 re-shaped the tumor microenvironment by promoting the intratumoral accumulation of cytotoxic lymphocytes, conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1s), and a dendritic cell (DC) population expressing both CD103 and CD11b markers. These CD103intCD11b+DCs share phenotypic and gene expression characteristics with both cDC1s and cDC2s, have transcriptomic profiles more similar to monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs), and correlate with tumor regression. Therefore, hetIL-15, a cytokine directly affecting lymphocytes and inducing cytotoxic cells, also has an indirect rapid and significant effect on the recruitment of myeloid cells, initiating a cascade for tumor elimination through innate and adoptive immune mechanisms. The intratumoral CD103intCD11b+DC population induced by hetIL-15 may be targeted for the development of additional cancer immunotherapy approaches.

Abstract: Summary
Coronins play critical roles in actin network formation. The diverse functions of coronins are regulated by the structured N-terminal β propeller and the C-terminal coiled coil (CC). However, less is known about a middle “unique region” (UR), which is an intrinsically disordered region (IDR). The UR/IDR is an evolutionarily conserved signature in the coronin family. By integrating biochemical and cell biology experiments, coarse-grained simulations, and protein engineering, we find that the IDR optimizes the biochemical activities of coronins in vivo and in vitro. The budding yeast coronin IDR plays essential roles in regulating Crn1 activity by fine-tuning CC oligomerization and maintaining Crn1 as a tetramer. The IDR-guided optimization of Crn1 oligomerization is critical for F-actin cross-linking and regulation of Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization. The final oligomerization status and homogeneity of Crn1 are contributed by three examined factors: helix packing, the energy landscape of the CC, and the length and molecular grammar of the IDR.

Abstract: Alterations in calcium (Ca2+) signaling is a major mechanism in the development of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), a side effect caused by multiple chemotherapy regimens. CIPN is associated with numbness and incessant tingling in hands and feet which diminishes quality of life during treatment. In up to 50% of survivors, CIPN is essentially irreversible. There are no approved, disease-modifying treatments for CIPN. The only recourse for oncologists is to modify the chemotherapy dose, a situation that can compromise optimal chemotherapy and impact patient outcomes. Here we focus on taxanes and other chemotherapeutic agents that work by altering microtubule assemblies to kill cancer cells, but also have off-target toxicities. There have been many molecular mechanisms proposed to explain the effects of microtubule-disrupting drugs. In neurons, an initiating step in the off-target effects of treatment by taxane is binding to neuronal calcium sensor 1 (NCS1), a sensitive Ca2+ sensor protein that maintains the resting Ca2+ concentration and dynamically enhances responses to cellular stimuli. The taxane/NCS1 interaction causes a Ca2+ surge that starts a pathophysiological cascade of consequences. This same mechanism contributes to other conditions including chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment. Strategies to prevent the Ca2+ surge are the foundation of current work.

Abstract: Summary
Presynaptic plasticity adjusts neurotransmitter (NT) liberation. Short-term facilitation (STF) tunes synapses to millisecond repetitive activation, while presynaptic homeostatic potentiation (PHP) of NT release stabilizes transmission over minutes. Despite different timescales of STF and PHP, our analysis of Drosophila neuromuscular junctions reveals functional overlap and shared molecular dependence on the release-site protein Unc13A. Mutating Unc13A’s calmodulin binding domain (CaM-domain) increases baseline transmission while blocking STF and PHP. Mathematical modeling suggests that Ca2+/calmodulin/Unc13A interaction plastically stabilizes vesicle priming at release sites and that CaM-domain mutation causes constitutive stabilization, thereby blocking plasticity. Labeling the functionally essential Unc13A MUN domain reveals higher STED microscopy signals closer to release sites following CaM-domain mutation. Acute phorbol ester treatment similarly enhances NT release and blocks STF/PHP in synapses expressing wild-type Unc13A, while CaM-domain mutation occludes this, indicating common downstream effects. Thus, Unc13A regulatory domains integrate signals across timescales to switch release-site participation for synaptic plasticity.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the role of the immune microenvironment in modulating intratumor heterogeneity is essential for effective cancer therapies. Using multicolor lineage tracing in genetically engineered mouse models and single-cell transcriptomics, we show that slowly progressing tumors contain a multiclonal landscape of relatively homogeneous subpopulations within a well-organized tumor microenvironment. In more advanced and aggressive tumors, however, the multiclonal landscape develops into competing dominant and minor clones accompanied by a disordered microenvironment. We demonstrate that this dominant/minor landscape is associated with differential immunoediting, in which minor clones are marked by an increased expression of IFNγ-response genes and the T cell-activating chemokines Cxcl9 and Cxcl11. Furthermore, immunomodulation of the IFNγ pathway can rescue minor clones from elimination. Notably, the immune-specific gene signature of minor clones exhibits a prognostic value for biochemical recurrence-free survival in human prostate cancer. These findings suggest new immunotherapy approaches for modulating clonal fitness and tumor progression in prostate cancer.

Abstract: Calcium is a crucial messenger of intracellular and extracellular signals, regulating a great variety of cellular processes such as cell death, proliferation, and metabolism. Inside the cell, calcium signaling is one of the main interorganelle communication mediators, with central functional roles at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, Golgi complex, and lysosomes. Lysosomal function is highly dependent on lumenal calcium and most of the lysosomal membrane-localised ion channels regulate several lysosomal functions and properties such as lumenal pH. One of these functions configures a specific type of cell death involving lysosomes, named lysosome-dependent cell death (LDCD), which contributes to maintenance of tissue homeostasis, development and pathology when deregulated. Here, we cover the fundamental aspects of LDCD with a special focus on recent advances in calcium signaling in LDCD.

Abstract: Summary
Synaptic dysfunction is implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BP). We use quantitative mass spectrometry to carry out deep, unbiased proteomic profiling of synapses purified from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of 35 cases of SCZ, 35 cases of BP, and 35 controls. Compared with controls, SCZ and BP synapses show substantial and similar proteomic alterations. Network analyses reveal upregulation of proteins associated with autophagy and certain vesicle transport pathways and downregulation of proteins related to synaptic, mitochondrial, and ribosomal function in the synapses of individuals with SCZ or BP. Some of the same pathways are similarly dysregulated in the synaptic proteome of mutant mice deficient in Akap11, a recently discovered shared risk gene for SCZ and BP. Our work provides biological insights into molecular dysfunction at the synapse in SCZ and BP and serves as a resource for understanding the pathophysiology of these disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Technology for crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) followed by sequencing (CLIP-seq) has identified the transcriptomic targets of hundreds of RNA-binding proteins in cells. To increase the power of existing and future CLIP-seq datasets, we introduce Skipper, an end-to-end workflow that converts unprocessed reads into annotated binding sites using an improved statistical framework. Compared with existing methods, Skipper on average calls 210%–320% more transcriptomic binding sites and sometimes >1,000% more sites, providing deeper insight into post-transcriptional gene regulation. Skipper also calls binding to annotated repetitive elements and identifies bound elements for 99% of enhanced CLIP experiments. We perform nine translation factor enhanced CLIPs and apply Skipper to learn determinants of translation factor occupancy, including transcript region, sequence, and subcellular localization. Furthermore, we observe depletion of genetic variation in occupied sites and nominate transcripts subject to selective constraint because of translation factor occupancy. Skipper offers fast, easy, customizable, and state-of-the-art analysis of CLIP-seq data.

Abstract: Summary
Emerging evidence suggests that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play diverse and critical roles in neural development, function, and disease. Here, we examine neuronal lncRNAs in a model system that offers enormous advantages for deciphering their functions: the Drosophila olfactory system. This system is numerically simple, its neurons are exquisitely well defined, and it drives multiple complex behaviors. We undertake a comprehensive survey of linear and circular lncRNAs in the Drosophila antenna and identify a wealth of lncRNAs enriched in it. We generate an unprecedented lncRNA-to-neuron map, which reveals that olfactory receptor neurons are defined not only by their receptors but also by the combination of lncRNAs they express. We identify species-specific lncRNAs, including many that are expressed primarily in pheromone-sensing neurons and that may act in modulation of pheromonal responses or in speciation. This resource opens many new opportunities for investigating the roles of lncRNAs in the nervous system.

Abstract: Summary
PARP1, an established anti-cancer target that regulates many cellular pathways, including DNA repair signaling, has been intensely studied for decades as a poly(ADP-ribosyl)transferase. Although recent studies have revealed the prevalence of mono-ADP-ribosylation upon DNA damage, it was unknown whether this signal plays an active role in the cell or is just a byproduct of poly-ADP-ribosylation. By engineering SpyTag-based modular antibodies for sensitive and flexible detection of mono-ADP-ribosylation, including fluorescence-based sensors for live-cell imaging, we demonstrate that serine mono-ADP-ribosylation constitutes a second wave of PARP1 signaling shaped by the cellular HPF1/PARP1 ratio. Multilevel chromatin proteomics reveals histone mono-ADP-ribosylation readers, including RNF114, a ubiquitin ligase recruited to DNA lesions through a zinc-finger domain, modulating the DNA damage response and telomere maintenance. Our work provides a technological framework for illuminating ADP-ribosylation in a wide range of applications and biological contexts and establishes mono-ADP-ribosylation by HPF1/PARP1 as an important information carrier for cell signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Checkpoint inhibitors are effective in recurrent/metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer (R/M NPC). RATIONALE-309 (NCT03924986) randomized 263 treatment-naive R/M NPC patients to tislelizumab or placebo every 3 weeks (Q3W), plus chemotherapy (Q3W for 4–6 cycles). At interim analysis, progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly longer with tislelizumab-chemotherapy versus placebo-chemotherapy (hazard ratio: 0.52; 95% confidence interval: 0.38, 0.73; p < 0.0001). PFS benefit for tislelizumab-chemotherapy versus placebo-chemotherapy was observed regardless of programmed death-ligand 1 expression. PFS after next line of treatment and overall survival showed favorable trends for tislelizumab-chemotherapy versus placebo-chemotherapy. The safety profile was similar between arms. Gene expression profiling (GEP) identified immunologically “hot” tumors, and showed an activated dendritic cell (DC) signature was associated with tislelizumab-chemotherapy PFS benefit. Our results support that tislelizumab-chemotherapy should be considered as first-line treatment for R/M NPC, and GEP and activated DC signature results may help identify patients who might benefit most from immunochemotherapy treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Dynamic and coordinated axonal responses to changing environments are critical for establishing neural connections. As commissural axons migrate across the CNS midline, they are suggested to switch from being attracted to being repelled in order to approach and to subsequently leave the midline. A molecular mechanism that is hypothesized to underlie this switch in axonal responses is the silencing of Netrin1/Deleted in Colorectal Carcinoma (DCC)-mediated attraction by the repulsive SLIT/ROBO1 signaling. Using in vivo approaches including CRISPR-Cas9-engineered mouse models of distinct Dcc splice isoforms, we show here that commissural axons maintain responsiveness to both Netrin and SLIT during midline crossing, although likely at quantitatively different levels. In addition, full-length DCC in collaboration with ROBO3 can antagonize ROBO1 repulsion in vivo. We propose that commissural axons integrate and balance the opposing DCC and Roundabout (ROBO) signaling to ensure proper guidance decisions during midline entry and exit.

Abstract: Summary
The neural mechanisms by which animals initiate goal-directed actions, choose between options, or explore opportunities remain unknown. Here, we develop a spatial gambling task in which mice, to obtain intracranial self-stimulation rewards, self-determine the initiation, direction, vigor, and pace of their actions based on their knowledge of the outcomes. Using electrophysiological recordings, pharmacology, and optogenetics, we identify a sequence of oscillations and firings in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and prefrontal cortex (PFC) that co-encodes and co-determines self-initiation and choices. This sequence appeared with learning as an uncued realignment of spontaneous dynamics. Interactions between the structures varied with the reward context, particularly the uncertainty associated with the different options. We suggest that self-generated choices arise from a distributed circuit based on an OFC-VTA core determining whether to wait for or initiate actions, while the PFC is specifically engaged by reward uncertainty in action selection and pace.

Abstract: Summary
Liver metastasis is a major cause of death in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Fatty liver promotes liver metastasis, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We demonstrated that hepatocyte-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) in fatty liver enhanced the progression of CRC liver metastasis by promoting oncogenic Yes-associated protein (YAP) signaling and an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Fatty liver upregulated Rab27a expression, which facilitated EV production from hepatocytes. In the liver, these EVs transferred YAP signaling-regulating microRNAs to cancer cells to augment YAP activity by suppressing LATS2. Increased YAP activity in CRC liver metastasis with fatty liver promoted cancer cell growth and an immunosuppressive microenvironment by M2 macrophage infiltration through CYR61 production. Patients with CRC liver metastasis and fatty liver had elevated nuclear YAP expression, CYR61 expression, and M2 macrophage infiltration. Our data indicate that fatty liver-induced EV-microRNAs, YAP signaling, and an immunosuppressive microenvironment promote the growth of CRC liver metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Crosstalk between cardiac cells is critical for heart performance. Here we show that vascular cells within human cardiac organoids (hCOs) enhance their maturation, force of contraction, and utility in disease modeling. Herein we optimize our protocol to generate vascular populations in addition to epicardial, fibroblast, and cardiomyocyte cells that self-organize into in-vivo-like structures in hCOs. We identify mechanisms of communication between endothelial cells, pericytes, fibroblasts, and cardiomyocytes that ultimately contribute to cardiac organoid maturation. In particular, (1) endothelial-derived LAMA5 regulates expression of mature sarcomeric proteins and contractility, and (2) paracrine platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ) signaling from vascular cells upregulates matrix deposition to augment hCO contractile force. Finally, we demonstrate that vascular cells determine the magnitude of diastolic dysfunction caused by inflammatory factors and identify a paracrine role of endothelin driving dysfunction. Together this study highlights the importance and role of vascular cells in organoid models.

Abstract: Summary
Adhesion G protein-coupled receptors (aGPCRs) are a large GPCR class that direct diverse fundamental biological processes. One prominent mechanism for aGPCR agonism involves autoproteolytic cleavage, which generates an activating, membrane-proximal tethered agonist (TA). How universal this mechanism is for all aGPCRs is unclear. Here, we investigate G protein induction principles of aGPCRs using mammalian latrophilin 3 (LPHN3) and cadherin EGF LAG-repeat 7-transmembrane receptors 1–3 (CELSR1–3), members of two aGPCR families conserved from invertebrates to vertebrates. LPHNs and CELSRs mediate fundamental aspects of brain development, yet CELSR signaling mechanisms are unknown. We find that CELSR1 and CELSR3 are cleavage deficient, while CELSR2 is efficiently cleaved. Despite differential autoproteolysis, CELSR1–3 all engage GαS, and CELSR1 or CELSR3 TA point mutants retain GαS coupling activity. CELSR2 autoproteolysis enhances GαS coupling, yet acute TA exposure alone is insufficient. These studies support that aGPCRs signal via multiple paradigms and provide insights into CELSR biological function.

Abstract: Stem cell populations are defined by their capacity to self-renew and to generate differentiated progeny. These unique characteristics largely depend on the stem cell micro-environment, the so-called stem cell niche. Niches were identified for most adult stem cells studied so far, but we know surprisingly little about how somatic stem cells and their niche come together during organ formation. Using the neuromasts of teleost fish, we have previously reported that neural stem cells recruit their niche from neighboring epithelial cells, which go through a morphological and molecular transformation. Here, we tackle quantitative, temporal, and clonal aspects of niche formation in neuromasts by using 4D imaging in transgenic lines, and lineage analysis in mosaic fish. We show that niche recruitment happens in a defined temporal window during the formation of neuromasts in medaka, and after that, the niche is enlarged mainly by the proliferation of niche cells. Niche recruitment is a non-clonal process that feeds from diverse epithelial cells that do not display a preferential position along the circumference of the forming neuromast. Additionally, we cover niche formation and expansion in zebrafish to show that distant species show common features during organogenesis in the lateral line system. Overall, our findings shed light on the process of niche formation, fundamental for the maintenance of stem cells not only in medaka but also in many other multicellular organisms.

Abstract: Summary
The primate frontal lobe (FL) is sensitive to aging-related neurocognitive decline. However, the aging-associated molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, using physiologically aged non-human primates (NHPs), we depicted a comprehensive landscape of FL aging with multidimensional profiling encompassing bulk and single-nucleus transcriptomes, quantitative proteome, and DNA methylome. Conjoint analysis across these molecular and neuropathological layers underscores nuclear lamina and heterochromatin erosion, resurrection of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), activated pro-inflammatory cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) signaling, and cellular senescence in post-mitotic neurons of aged NHP and human FL. Using human embryonic stem-cell-derived neurons recapitulating cellular aging in vitro, we verified the loss of B-type lamins inducing resurrection of ERVs as an initiating event of the aging-bound cascade in post-mitotic neurons. Of significance, these aging-related cellular and molecular changes can be alleviated by abacavir, a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, either through direct treatment of senescent human neurons in vitro or oral administration to aged mice.

Abstract: Summary
Lassa fever is an acute hemorrhagic fever caused by the zoonotic Lassa virus (LASV). The LASV glycoprotein complex (GPC) mediates viral entry and is the sole target for neutralizing antibodies. Immunogen design is complicated by the metastable nature of recombinant GPCs and the antigenic differences among phylogenetically distinct LASV lineages. Despite the sequence diversity of the GPC, structures of most lineages are lacking. We present the development and characterization of prefusion-stabilized, trimeric GPCs of LASV lineages II, V, and VII, revealing structural conservation despite sequence diversity. High-resolution structures and biophysical characterization of the GPC in complex with GP1-A-specific antibodies suggest their neutralization mechanisms. Finally, we present the isolation and characterization of a trimer-preferring neutralizing antibody belonging to the GPC-B competition group with an epitope that spans adjacent protomers and includes the fusion peptide. Our work provides molecular detail information on LASV antigenic diversity and will guide efforts to design pan-LASV vaccines.

Abstract: Summary
Neutrophil aggregation and clearance are important factors affecting neuroinflammatory injury during acute ischemic stroke. Emerging evidence suggests that energy metabolism is essential for microglial functions, especially microglial phagocytosis, which determines the degree of brain injury. Here, we demonstrate that Resolvin D1 (RvD1), a lipid mediator derived from docosahexaenic acid (DHA), promotes the phagocytosis of neutrophils by microglia, thereby reducing neutrophil accumulation in the brain and alleviating neuroinflammation in the ischemic brain. Further studies reveal that RvD1 reprograms energy metabolism from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), providing sufficient energy for microglial phagocytosis. Moreover, RvD1 enhances microglial glutamine uptake and stimulates glutaminolysis to support OXPHOS to boost ATP production depending on adenosine 5′-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation. Overall, our results reveal that RvD1 reprograms energy metabolism to promote the microglial phagocytosis of neutrophils after ischemic stroke. These findings may guide perspectives for stroke therapy from modulating microglial immunometabolism.

Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory disease of the colon and tends to relapse. Higenamine (HG) has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-apoptotic activities. This study aimed to investigate the role of HG in the treatment of UC as well as the underlying mechanism. In vivo and in vitro models of UC were respectively established in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced mice and DSS-induced NCM460 cells. The weight and disease performance and disease activity index (DAI) of mice were recorded every day. The colon length was measured and pathological changes of colon tissues were observed by HE staining. The apoptosis of colon cells in mice was detected by Tunel assay and FITC-dextran was used to detect intestinal permeability in mice. The MPO activity and expression of tight junction proteins and Galectin-3/TLR4/NF-κB pathway related proteins in colon tissues and cells were detected by MPO assay kit and western blot. The levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-10 in serum and cells, and levels of DAO and D-LA in serum were all detected by assay kits. The viability and apoptosis of NCM460 cells were analyzed by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry analysis, and permeability of NCM460 monolayers was detected by TEER measurement. As a result, HG improved the weight, DAI, colon length and pathological changes of DSS-induced UC mice. HG alleviated DSS-induced colon inflammation, inhibited DSS-induced apoptosis of mouse colonic epithelial cells and restored the integrity of the mucosa barrier in mice. In addition, HG suppressed the Galectin-3/TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway in DSS-induced UC mice. Similarly, HG improved viability and epithelial barrier function, and suppressed the apoptosis and inflammation of DSS-induced NCM460 cells by inhibiting the Galectin-3/TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway. Galectin-3 overexpression could reverse the effect of HG on DSS-induced NCM460 cells. In conclusion, HG improved DSS-induced UC through the inactivation of Galectin-3/TLR4/NF-κB pathway in vivo and in vitro.

Abstract: Background
Diabetes Mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by insulin dysfunction or failure of the pancreatic β-cells to produce insulin resulting in hyperglycemia. Adverse effects of hyperglycemic conditions continue to be common, reducing treatment adherence. Intensified therapies are required for the constant loss of endogenous islet reserve.
Aim
This study aimed to evaluate the effect of Nimbin semi-natural analogs (N2, N5, N7, and N8) from A. indica on high glucose-induced ROS and apoptosis with insulin resistance in L6 myotubes evaluated along with Wortmannin and Genistein inhibitors and the expression of key genes in the insulin signalling pathway.
Materials and methods
The analogs were screened for anti-oxidant and anti-diabetic activity using cell-free assays; The ability of analogs to suppress ROS and prevent apoptosis induced by High glucose and uptake glucose and glycogen storage in L6 myotubes was evaluated using DCFH-DA, AO-PI and 2NBDG staining. Further, the glucose uptake was performed in the presence of Insulin Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (IRTK) inhibitors, and the expression of key genes PI3K, Glut-4, GS and IRTK in the insulin signalling pathway were evaluated.
Key findings
The Nimbin analogs were not toxic to the L6 cells, and the analogs could scavenge ROS and suppress cellular damage induced due to high glucose. Enhanced glucose uptake was observed in N2, N5 and N7 compared to N8. The maximum activity of optimum concentration was found to be 100 μM. The N2, N5 and N7 showed an increase in IRTK, which is equivalent to insulin at a concentration of 100 µM. The IRTK inhibitor with Genistein (50 µM) confirmed the presence of IRTK-dependent glucose transport activation; it also supports the expression of key genes PI3K, Glut-4, GS and IRTK. As a result of PI3K activation, N2, N5, and N7 exhibited the insulin-mimetic effect by enhancing glucose uptake and glycogen conversion regulating glucose metabolism.
Significance
N2, N5 and N7 could therapeutically benefit against insulin resistance by glucose metabolism modulation, insulin secretion, β-cell stimulation, inhibition of gluconeogenic enzymes and ROS protection.

Abstract: Summary
Crosstalk among organs/tissues is important for regulating systemic metabolism. Here, we demonstrate inter-organ crosstalk between hepatic insulin and hypothalamic leptin actions, which maintains survival during food shortages. In inducible liver insulin receptor knockout mice, body weight is increased with hyperphagia and decreased energy expenditure, accompanied by increased circulating leptin receptor (LepR) and decreased hypothalamic leptin actions. Additional hepatic LepR deficiency reverses these metabolic phenotypes. Thus, decreased hepatic insulin action suppresses hypothalamic leptin action with increased liver-derived soluble LepR. Human hepatic and circulating LepR levels also correlate negatively with hepatic insulin action indices. In mice, food restriction decreases hepatic insulin action and energy expenditure with increased circulating LepR. Hepatic LepR deficiency increases mortality with enhanced energy expenditure during food restriction. The liver translates metabolic cues regarding energy-deficient status, which is reflected by decreased hepatic insulin action, into soluble LepR, thereby suppressing energy dissipation and assuring survival during food shortages.

Abstract: Summary
Although most eukaryotic proteins are targeted for proteasomal degradation by ubiquitination, a subset have been demonstrated to undergo ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation (UbInPD). However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms driving UbInPD and the degrons involved. Utilizing the GPS-peptidome approach, a systematic method for degron discovery, we found thousands of sequences that promote UbInPD; thus, UbInPD is more prevalent than currently appreciated. Furthermore, mutagenesis experiments revealed specific C-terminal degrons required for UbInPD. Stability profiling of a genome-wide collection of human open reading frames identified 69 full-length proteins subject to UbInPD. These included REC8 and CDCA4, proteins which control proliferation and survival, as well as mislocalized secretory proteins, suggesting that UbInPD performs both regulatory and protein quality control functions. In the context of full-length proteins, C termini also play a role in promoting UbInPD. Finally, we found that Ubiquilin family proteins mediate the proteasomal targeting of a subset of UbInPD substrates.

Abstract: Background
Gastric cancer (GC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Heterophyllin B (HB) has been proved to be a potential drug in cancer treatment.
Methods
In the current study, GC cells were treated with 0, 10, 25, or 50 μM of HB. Cell viability was determined by utilizing MTT assay. Flow cytometry was carried out for cell apoptosis and cell cycle analysis. The expression levels of IRE1, CHOP, GRP78 and Bcl-2 in cells and tumors were measured by Western blot and immunohistochemistry, respectively.
Results
Our data uncovered that HB administration significantly suppressed GC cell viability, but facilitated GC cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase. The effects of HB on GC cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle showed dosage-dependent manner. Furthermore, expression of ER stress-associated proteins like IRE1, CHOP and GRP78 was markedly upregulated, while anti-apoptosis protein Bcl2 expression was inhibited by HB treatment in a dosage-dependent manner. Our data indicated that HB treatment facilitated caspase-3 expression in a dose-dependent manner, but had no effect on caspase-8 expression. Importantly, the inhibition of HB to GC cell apoptosis and cell cycle process and the promotion of HB to GC cell proliferation were partly rescued by inhibition of ER stress utilizing 4-PBA. In animal experiments, HB administration suppressed GC tumor growth, boosted IRE1, CHOP and GRP78 expression and inhibited Bcl-2 expression.
Conclusion
All in all, HB treatment could effectively suppress GC cells proliferation and tumors growth and facilitate GC cells apoptosis and cell cycle arrest through activating ER stress. Our data indicated that HB may be a potential drug for GC treatment.

Abstract: Summary
The role that human papillomavirus (HPV) oncogenes play in suppressing responses to immunotherapy in cancer deserves further investigation. In particular, the effects of HPV E5 remain poorly understood relative to E6 and E7. Here, we demonstrate that HPV E5 is a negative regulator of anti-viral interferon (IFN) response pathways, antigen processing, and antigen presentation. Using head and neck cancer as a model, we identify that E5 decreases expression and function of the immunoproteasome and that the immunoproteasome, but not the constitutive proteasome, is associated with improved overall survival in patients. Moreover, immunopeptidome analysis reveals that HPV E5 restricts the repertoire of antigens presented on the cell surface, likely contributing to immune escape. Mechanistically, we discover a direct interaction between E5 and stimulator of interferon genes (STING), which suppresses downstream IFN signaling. Taken together, these findings identify a powerful molecular mechanism by which HPV E5 limits immune detection and mediates resistance to immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
In addition to membranous organelles, autophagy selectively degrades biomolecular condensates, in particular p62/SQSTM1 bodies, to prevent diseases including cancer. Evidence is growing regarding the mechanisms by which autophagy degrades p62 bodies, but little is known about their constituents. Here, we established a fluorescence-activated-particle-sorting-based purification method for p62 bodies using human cell lines and determined their constituents by mass spectrometry. Combined with mass spectrometry of selective-autophagy-defective mouse tissues, we identified vault, a large supramolecular complex, as a cargo within p62 bodies. Mechanistically, major vault protein directly interacts with NBR1, a p62-interacting protein, to recruit vault into p62 bodies for efficient degradation. This process, named vault-phagy, regulates homeostatic vault levels in vivo, and its impairment may be associated with non-alcoholic-steatohepatitis-derived hepatocellular carcinoma. Our study provides an approach to identifying phase-separation-mediated selective autophagy cargoes, expanding our understanding of the role of phase separation in proteostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Although population-level analyses revealed significant roles for CTCF and cohesin in mammalian genome organization, their contributions at the single-cell level remain incompletely understood. Here, we used a super-resolution microscopy approach to measure the effects of removal of CTCF or cohesin in mouse embryonic stem cells. Single-chromosome traces revealed cohesin-dependent loops, frequently stacked at their loop anchors forming multi-way contacts (hubs), bridging across TAD boundaries. Despite these bridging interactions, chromatin in intervening TADs was not intermixed, remaining separated in distinct loops around the hub. At the multi-TAD scale, steric effects from loop stacking insulated local chromatin from ultra-long range (>4 Mb) contacts. Upon cohesin removal, the chromosomes were more disordered and increased cell-cell variability in gene expression. Our data revise the TAD-centric understanding of CTCF and cohesin and provide a multi-scale, structural picture of how they organize the genome on the single-cell level through distinct contributions to loop stacking.

Abstract: Summary
c-Src tyrosine kinase is a renowned key intracellular signaling molecule and a potential target for cancer therapy. Secreted c-Src is a recent observation, but how it contributes to extracellular phosphorylation remains elusive. Using a series of domain deletion mutants, we show that the N-proximal region of c-Src is essential for its secretion. The tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 (TIMP2) is an extracellular substrate of c-Src. Limited proteolysis-coupled mass spectrometry and mutagenesis studies verify that the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of c-Src and the P31VHP34 motif of TIMP2 are critical for their interaction. Comparative phosphoproteomic analyses identify an enrichment of PxxP motifs in phosY-containing secretomes from c-Src-expressing cells with cancer-promoting roles. Inhibition of extracellular c-Src using custom SH3-targeting antibodies disrupt kinase-substrate complexes and inhibit cancer cell proliferation. These findings point toward an intricate role for c-Src in generating phosphosecretomes, which will likely influence cell-cell communication, particularly in c-Src-overexpressing cancers.
