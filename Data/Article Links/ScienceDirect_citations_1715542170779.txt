Abstract: Challenges of cell-based cancer therapy include effectively homing therapeutic cells to the disease site and producing a controlled response in recognition of the microenvironment. While stem cells have been intensively studied for treating cancer as they naturally home towards sites of injury, they have drawbacks due to their pluripotency. In this paper we have shown that a stable HEK293 cell line expressing VEGFR2 and CarQ (an engineered Ca2+-sensitive RhoA) can home towards a cell colony expressing VEGF. Upon VEGF binding to VEGFR2, a Ca2+ signal is produced that in turn activates CarQ-mediated cell blebbing. With the addition of VSVG, these homing cells can further initiate pH-dependent fusion upon reaching the cell colony. This protein system can form the basis of engineering cells for therapeutic intervention by homing and inhibiting tumour growth by pH-dependent fusion.

Abstract: Summary
The innate immune system tightly regulates activation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) to avoid inappropriate expression. Pathological ISG activation resulting from aberrant nucleic acid metabolism has been implicated in autoimmune disease; however, the mechanisms governing ISG suppression are unknown. Through a genome-wide genetic screen, we identified DEAD-box helicase 6 (DDX6) as a suppressor of ISGs. Genetic ablation of DDX6 induced global upregulation of ISGs and other immune genes. ISG upregulation proved cell intrinsic, imposing an antiviral state and making cells refractory to divergent families of RNA viruses. Epistatic analysis revealed that ISG activation could not be overcome by deletion of canonical RNA sensors. However, DDX6 deficiency was suppressed by disrupting LSM1, a core component of mRNA degradation machinery, suggesting that dysregulation of RNA processing underlies ISG activation in the DDX6 mutant. DDX6 is distinct among DExD/H helicases that regulate the antiviral response in its singular ability to negatively regulate immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is an aggressive malignancy of the bile ducts, with poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Here, we describe the integrated analysis of somatic mutations, RNA expression, copy number, and DNA methylation by The Cancer Genome Atlas of a set of predominantly intrahepatic CCA cases and propose a molecular classification scheme. We identified an IDH mutant-enriched subtype with distinct molecular features including low expression of chromatin modifiers, elevated expression of mitochondrial genes, and increased mitochondrial DNA copy number. Leveraging the multi-platform data, we observed that ARID1A exhibited DNA hypermethylation and decreased expression in the IDH mutant subtype. More broadly, we found that IDH mutations are associated with an expanded histological spectrum of liver tumors with molecular features that stratify with CCA. Our studies reveal insights into the molecular pathogenesis and heterogeneity of cholangiocarcinoma and provide classification information of potential therapeutic significance.

Abstract: Summary
Cell size homeostasis can be achieved by size checkpoints that couple cell size to cell-cycle progression or by alternative mechanisms such as constant extension. In mammalian cells, the existence of strict size checkpoints remains controversial due to the technical limitations in determining cell size directly and accurately. We developed a microfabricated channel system that linearizes mammalian cell growth and facilitates cell size measurements. By tracking cell length, while directly visualizing cell-cycle progression in rat basophilic leukemia cells and RAW 264.7 macrophages, we examined the mechanisms of size homeostasis and the existence of a size checkpoint at the G1/S transition. Our analysis revealed a two-tier size homeostasis mechanism where a G1 “sizer” or “adder” could operate, depending on the birth size of the cells.

Abstract: Summary
Recent advances in self-organizing, 3-dimensional tissue cultures of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provided an in vitro model that recapitulates many aspects of the in vivo developmental steps. Using Rax-GFP-expressing ESCs, newly generated Six3−/− iPSCs, and conditional null Six3delta/f;Rax-Cre ESCs, we identified Six3 repression of R-spondin 2 (Rspo2) as a required step during optic vesicle morphogenesis and neuroretina differentiation. We validated these results in vivo by showing that transient ectopic expression of Rspo2 in the anterior neural plate of transgenic mouse embryos was sufficient to inhibit neuroretina differentiation. Additionally, using a chimeric eye organoid assay, we determined that Six3 null cells exert a non-cell-autonomous repressive effect during optic vesicle formation and neuroretina differentiation. Our results further validate the organoid culture system as a reliable and fast alternative to identify and evaluate genes involved in eye morphogenesis and neuroretina differentiation in vivo.

IDH1 Mutation Promotes Tumorigenesis by Inhibiting JNK Activation and Apoptosis Induced by Serum Starvation,

Abstract: Summary
Two hallmarks of cancer cells are their resistance to apoptosis and ability to thrive despite reduced levels of vital serum components. c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation is crucial for apoptosis triggered by serum starvation (SS), and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutations are tumorigenic, in part, because they produce the abnormal metabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). However, it is unknown whether 2-HG-induced tumorigenesis is partially due to JNK inhibition and thus defective SS-induced apoptosis. We show here, using IDH1-R132Q knockin mutant mouse cells, that 2-HG inhibits JNK activation induced only by SS and not by UV or doxorubicin, and thus can block apoptosis. Upon SS, Cdc42 normally disrupts mixed lineage kinase 3’s (MLK3’s) auto-inhibition, triggering the MLK3-MKK4/7-JNK-Bim apoptotic cascade. 2-HG binds to Cdc42 and abolishes its association with MLK3, inactivating MLK3 and apoptosis. Allograft tumor assays in mice demonstrate that this mechanism contributes to tumorigenesis driven by mutant IDH1, a result confirmed by detection of JNK inactivation in human gliomas harboring IDH1-R132H mutations.

Abstract: Summary
Activating mutations in the KRAS oncogene are highly prevalent in tumors, especially those of the colon, lung, and pancreas. To better understand the genetic dependencies that K-Ras mutant cells rely upon for their growth, we employed whole-genome CRISPR loss-of-function screens in two isogenic pairs of cell lines. Since loss of essential genes is uniformly toxic in CRISPR-based screens, we also developed a small hairpin RNA (shRNA) library targeting essential genes. These approaches uncovered a large set of proteins whose loss results in the selective reduction of K-Ras mutant cell growth. Pathway analysis revealed that many of these genes function in the mitochondria. For validation, we generated isogenic pairs of cell lines using CRISPR-based genome engineering, which confirmed the dependency of K-Ras mutant cells on these mitochondrial pathways. Finally, we found that mitochondrial inhibitors reduce the growth of K-Ras mutant tumors in vivo, aiding in the advancement of strategies to target K-Ras-driven malignancy.

Abstract: Summary
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a motor neuron disease caused by reduced levels of the survival of motor neuron (SMN) protein. SMN is part of a multiprotein complex that facilitates the assembly of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). SMN has also been found to associate with mRNA-binding proteins, but the nature of this association was unknown. Here, we have employed a combination of biochemical and advanced imaging methods to demonstrate that SMN promotes the molecular interaction between IMP1 protein and the 3′ UTR zipcode region of β-actin mRNA, leading to assembly of messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes that associate with the cytoskeleton to facilitate trafficking. We have identified defects in mRNP assembly in cells and tissues from SMA disease models and patients that depend on the SMN Tudor domain and explain the observed deficiency in mRNA localization and local translation, providing insight into SMA pathogenesis as a ribonucleoprotein (RNP)-assembly disorder.

Abstract: Summary
The growth cone is an essential structure for nerve growth. Although its membrane and cytoskeleton are likely to interact coordinately during nerve growth, the mechanisms are unknown due to their close proximity. Here, we used superresolution microscopy to simultaneously observe vesicles and F-actin in growth cones. We identified a novel vesicular generation mechanism that is independent of clathrin and dependent on endophilin-3- and dynamin-1 and that occurs proximal to the leading edge simultaneously with fascin-1-dependent F-actin bundling. In contrast to conventional clathrin-dependent endocytosis, which occurs distal from the leading edge at the basal surfaces of growth cones, this mechanism was distinctly observed at the apical surface using 3D imaging and was involved in mediating axon growth. Reduced endophilin or fascin inhibited this endocytic mechanism. These results suggest that, at the leading edge, vesicles are coordinately generated and transported with actin bundling during nerve growth.

Abstract: Summary
Notch signaling in neural progenitor cell is triggered by ligands expressed in adjacent cells. To identify the sources of active Notch ligands in the mouse retina, we negatively regulated Notch ligand activity in various neighbors of retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) by eliminating mindbomb E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (Mib1). Mib1-deficient retinal cells failed to induce Notch activation in intra-lineage RPCs, which prematurely differentiated into neurons; however, Mib1 in post-mitotic retinal ganglion cells was not important. Interestingly, Mib1 in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) also contributed to Notch activation in adjacent RPCs by supporting the localization of active Notch ligands at RPE-RPC contacts. Combining this RPE-driven Notch signaling and intra-retinal Notch signaling, we propose a model in which one RPC daughter receives extra Notch signals from the RPE to become an RPC, whereas its sister cell receives only a subthreshold level of intra-retinal Notch signal and differentiates into a neuron.

Abstract: Summary
p62/SQSTM1 (p62) is a scaffolding protein that facilitates the formation and degradation of ubiquitinated aggregates via its self-interaction and ubiquitin binding domains. The regulation of this process is unclear but may relate to the post-translational modification of p62. In the present study, we find that Keap1/Cullin3 ubiquitinates p62 at lysine 420 within its UBA domain. Substitution of lysine 420 with an arginine diminishes p62 sequestration and degradation activity similar what is seen when the UBA domain is deleted. Overexpression of Keap1/Cullin3 in p62-WT-expressing cells increases ubiquitinated inclusion formation and p62's association with LC3 and rescues proteotoxicity. This effect is not seen in cells expressing a mutant p62 that fails to interact with Keap1. Interestingly, p62 disease mutants have diminished or absent UBA domain ubiquitination. These data suggest that the ubiquitination of p62’s UBA domain at lysine 420 may regulate p62’s function and be disrupted in p62-associated disease.

Abstract: We hypothesized that inflammation affects number and activity of osteoclasts (OCs) via enhancing autophagy. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced autophagy, osteoclastogenesis, and cytoplasmic reactive oxygen species (ROS) in bone marrow-derived macrophages that were pre-stimulated with receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand. An autophagy inhibitor, 3-methyladenine (3-MA) decreased LPS-induced OC formation and bone resorption, indicating that autophagy is responsible for increasing number and activity of OCs upon LPS stimulus. Knockdown of autophagy-related protein 7 attenuated the effect of LPS on OC-specific genes, supporting a role of LPS as an autophagy inducer in OC. Removal of ROS decreased LPS-induced OC formation as well as autophagy. However, 3-MA did not affect LPS-induced ROS levels, suggesting that ROS act upstream of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase in LPS-induced autophagy. Our results suggest the possible use of autophagy inhibitors targeting OCs to reduce inflammatory bone loss.

Abstract: Summary
Immunotherapy and particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors have resulted in remarkable clinical responses in patients with immunogenic tumors, although most cancers develop resistance to immunotherapy. The molecular mechanisms of tumor resistance to immunotherapy remain poorly understood. We now show that induction of the histone methyltransferase Ezh2 controls several tumor cell-intrinsic and extrinsic resistance mechanisms. Notably, T cell infiltration selectively correlated with high EZH2-PRC2 complex activity in human skin cutaneous melanoma. During anti-CTLA-4 or IL-2 immunotherapy in mice, intratumoral tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) production and T cell accumulation resulted in increased Ezh2 expression in melanoma cells, which in turn silenced their own immunogenicity and antigen presentation. Ezh2 inactivation reversed this resistance and synergized with anti-CTLA-4 and IL-2 immunotherapy to suppress melanoma growth. These anti-tumor effects depended on intratumorally accumulating interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-producing PD-1low CD8+ T cells and PD-L1 downregulation on melanoma cells. Hence, Ezh2 serves as a molecular switch controlling melanoma escape during T cell-targeting immunotherapies.

Abstract: Summary
Discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is a tyrosine kinase collagen adhesion receptor that mediates cell migration through association with non-muscle myosin IIA (NMIIA). Because DDR1 is implicated in cancer fibrosis, we hypothesized that DDR1 interacts with NMIIA to enable collagen compaction by traction forces. Mechanical splinting of rat dermal wounds increased DDR1 expression and collagen alignment. In periodontal ligament of DDR1 knockout mice, collagen mechanical reorganization was reduced >30%. Similarly, cultured cells with DDR1 knockdown or expressing kinase-deficient DDR1d showed 50% reduction of aligned collagen. Tractional remodeling of collagen was dependent on DDR1 clustering, activation, and interaction of the DDR1 C-terminal kinase domain with NMIIA filaments. Collagen remodeling by traction forces, DDR1 tyrosine phosphorylation, and myosin light chain phosphorylation were increased on stiff versus soft substrates. Thus, DDR1 clustering, activation, and interaction with NMIIA filaments enhance the collagen tractional remodeling that is important for collagen compaction in fibrosis.

Abstract: Summary
The evolutionary stability of synthetic genetic circuits is key to both the understanding and application of genetic control elements. One useful but challenging situation is a switch between life and death depending on environment. Here are presented “essentializer” and “cryodeath” circuits, which act as kill switches in Escherichia coli. The essentializer element induces cell death upon the loss of a bi-stable cI/Cro memory switch. Cryodeath makes use of a cold-inducible promoter to express a toxin. We employ rational design and a toxin/antitoxin titering approach to produce and screen a small library of potential constructs, in order to select for constructs that are evolutionarily stable. Both kill switches were shown to maintain functionality in vitro for at least 140 generations. Additionally, cryodeath was shown to control the growth environment of a population, with an escape frequency of less than 1 in 105 after 10 days of growth in the mammalian gut.

Abstract: Summary
PKCε, an oncogenic member of the PKC family, is aberrantly overexpressed in epithelial cancers. To date, little is known about functional interactions of PKCε with other genetic alterations, as well as the effectors contributing to its tumorigenic and metastatic phenotype. Here, we demonstrate that PKCε cooperates with the loss of the tumor suppressor Pten for the development of prostate cancer in a mouse model. Mechanistic analysis revealed that PKCε overexpression and Pten loss individually and synergistically upregulate the production of the chemokine CXCL13, which involves the transcriptional activation of the CXCL13 gene via the non-canonical nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway. Notably, targeted disruption of CXCL13 or its receptor, CXCR5, in prostate cancer cells impaired their migratory and tumorigenic properties.

Abstract: Summary
Loss of ER Ca2+ homeostasis triggers endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and drives ER-PM contact sites formation in order to refill ER-luminal Ca2+. Recent studies suggest that the ER stress sensor and mediator of the unfolded protein response (UPR) PERK regulates intracellular Ca2+ fluxes, but the mechanisms remain elusive. Here, using proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID), we identified the actin-binding protein Filamin A (FLNA) as a key PERK interactor. Cells lacking PERK accumulate F-actin at the cell edges and display reduced ER-PM contacts. Following ER-Ca2+ store depletion, the PERK-FLNA interaction drives the expansion of ER-PM juxtapositions by regulating F-actin-assisted relocation of the ER-associated tethering proteins Stromal Interaction Molecule 1 (STIM1) and Extended Synaptotagmin-1 (E-Syt1) to the PM. Cytosolic Ca2+ elevation elicits rapid and UPR-independent PERK dimerization, which enforces PERK-FLNA-mediated ER-PM juxtapositions. Collectively, our data unravel an unprecedented role of PERK in the regulation of ER-PM appositions through the modulation of the actin cytoskeleton.

Abstract: Summary
Many pathogens initiate infection at mucosal surfaces, and tissue-resident memory T (Trm) cells play an important role in protective immunity, yet the tissue-specific signals that regulate Trm differentiation are poorly defined. During Yersinia infection, CD8+ T cell recruitment to areas of inflammation within the intestine is required for differentiation of the CD103−CD69+ Trm subset. Intestinal proinflammatory microenvironments have elevated interferon (IFN)-β and interleukin-12 (IL-12), which regulated Trm markers, including CD103. Type I interferon-receptor- or IL-12-receptor-deficient T cells functioned similarly to wild-type (WT) cells during infection; however, the inability of T cells to respond to inflammation resulted in defective differentiation of CD103−CD69+ Trm cells and reduced Trm persistence. Intestinal macrophages were the main producers of IFN-β and IL-12 during infection, and deletion of CCR2+ IL-12-producing cells reduced the size of the CD103− Trm population. These data indicate that intestinal inflammation drives phenotypic diversity and abundance of Trm cells for optimal tissue-specific immunity.

Abstract: Phospholipase C-zeta (PLCZ1), a strong candidate of egg-activating sperm factor, can induce Ca2+ oscillations and cause egg activation. For the application of PLCZ1 to clinical use, we examined the pattern of Ca2+ responses and developmental rate by comparing PLCZ1 RNA injection methods with the other current methods, such as cytosolic aspiration, electrical stimulation and ionomycin treatment in human oocytes. We found that the pattern of Ca2+ oscillations after PLCZ1 RNA injection exhibited similar characteristics to that after ICSI treatment. We also determined the optimal concentration of human PLCZ1 RNA to activate the human oocytes. Our findings suggest that human PLCZ1 RNA is a better therapeutic agent to rescue human oocytes from failed activation, leading to normal and efficient development.

Abstract: Summary
In mammalian cells, histone deacetylase (HDAC) and Sirtuin (SIRT) are two families responsible for removing acetyl groups from acetylated proteins. Here, we describe protein deacetylation coupled with deacetylimination as a function of lysyl oxidase (LOX) family members. LOX-like 3 (Loxl3) associates with Stat3 in the nucleus to deacetylate and deacetyliminate Stat3 on multiple acetyl-lysine sites. Surprisingly, Loxl3 N-terminal scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) repeats, rather than the C-terminal oxidase catalytic domain, represent the major deacetylase/deacetyliminase activity. Loxl3-mediated deacetylation/deacetylimination disrupts Stat3 dimerization, abolishes Stat3 transcription activity, and restricts cell proliferation. In Loxl3−/− mice, Stat3 is constitutively acetylated and naive CD4+ T cells are potentiated in Th17/Treg cell differentiation. When overexpressed, the SRCR repeats from other LOX family members can catalyze protein deacetylation/deacetylimination. Thus, our findings delineate a hitherto-unknown mechanism of protein deacetylation and deacetylimination catalyzed by lysyl oxidases.

Abstract: Summary
Increasing evidence has demonstrated that small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) play important roles in tumorigenesis. We systematically investigated the expression landscape and clinical relevance of snoRNAs in >10,000 samples across 31 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We observed overall elevated expression of snoRNAs and their ribonucleoproteins in multiple cancer types. We showed complex regulation of snoRNA expression by their host genes, copy number variation, and DNA methylation. Unsupervised clustering revealed that the snoRNA expression subtype is highly concordant with other molecular/clinical subtypes. We further identified 46 clinically relevant snoRNAs and experimentally demonstrated functional roles of SNORD46 in promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. We developed a user-friendly data portal, SNORic, to benefit the research community. Our study highlights the significant roles of snoRNAs in the development and implementation of biomarkers or therapeutic targets for cancer and provides a valuable resource for cancer research.

Abstract: Summary
How the developmental potential of differentiating stem cell progeny becomes rapidly and stably restricted following asymmetric stem cell division is unclear. In the fly larval brain, earmuff (erm) uniquely functions to restrict the developmental potential of intermediate neural progenitors (INPs) generated by asymmetrically dividing neural stem cells (neuroblasts). Here we demonstrate that the histone deacetylase Hdac1/Rpd3 functions together with self-renewal transcriptional repressors to maintain the erm immature INP enhancer in an inactive but poised state in neuroblasts. Within 2 hr of immature INP birth, downregulation of repressor activities alleviates Rpd3-mediated repression on the erm enhancer, enabling acetylation of multiple histone proteins and activating Erm expression. Erm restricts the developmental potential in immature INPs by repressing genes encoding neuroblast transcriptional activators. We propose that poising the fast-activating enhancers of master regulators of differentiation through continual histone deacetylation in stem cells enables self-renewal and rapid restriction of developmental potential following asymmetric division.

Abstract: Tissue engineering is a new strategy which proposed to treat numerous human diseases nowadays. Three dimensional (3D) scaffolds fill the gap between two dimensional cell culture (2D) and animal tissues through mimicking the environmental behaviors surrounding the cells. In this study, hUCMs into insulin producing cells in fibrin scaffold were differentiated compare to conventional culture condition. Differentiation rate was estimated by real time PCR, immunocytochemistry (ICC) and the chemiluminesence (CLIA) and enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Real time PCR's results showed an increasing expression in NKX2.2, PDX1 and INS (producing the hormone insulin) genes in fibrin scaffold. Furthermore ICC analysis exhibited that insulin and pro-insulin proteins were more in fibrin scaffolds. CLIA and EIA on insulin and C peptide secretion indicated that both of groups were sensitive to the glucose challenge test but significant higher response was observed in fibrin scaffold (6.5 fold in 3D, 1.8 fold in 2D culture). It could be concluded that differentiation of hUCM cells into insulin producing cells in fibrin scaffold 3D culture system is much more efficient than 2D conventional culture system.

Abstract: Summary
Various factors differentially recognize trimethylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) near promoters, H3K4me2 just downstream, and promoter-distal H3K4me1 to modulate gene expression. This methylation “gradient” is thought to result from preferential binding of the H3K4 methyltransferase Set1/complex associated with Set1 (COMPASS) to promoter-proximal RNA polymerase II. However, other studies have suggested that location-specific cues allosterically activate Set1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments show that H3K4 methylation patterns on active genes are not universal or fixed and change in response to both transcription elongation rate and frequency as well as reduced COMPASS activity. Fusing Set1 to RNA polymerase II results in H3K4me2 throughout transcribed regions and similarly extended H3K4me3 on highly transcribed genes. Tethered Set1 still requires histone H2B ubiquitylation for activity. These results show that higher-level methylations reflect not only Set1/COMPASS recruitment but also multiple rounds of transcription. This model provides a simple explanation for non-canonical methylation patterns at some loci or in certain COMPASS mutants.

Abstract: The transcriptional activator AphB has been implicated in acid resistance and pathogenesis in the food borne pathogens Vibrio vulnificus and Vibrio cholerae. To date, the full-length AphB crystal structure of V. cholerae has been determined and characterized by a tetrameric assembly of AphB consisting of a DNA binding domain and a regulatory domain (RD). Although acidic pH and low oxygen tension might be involved in the activation of AphB, it remains unknown which ligand or stimulus activates AphB at the molecular level. In this study, we determine the crystal structure of the AphB RD from V. vulnificus under aerobic conditions without modification at the conserved cysteine residue of the RD, even in the presence of the oxidizing agent cumene hydroperoxide. A cysteine to serine amino acid residue mutant RD protein further confirmed that the cysteine residue is not involved in sensing oxidative stress in vitro. Interestingly, an unidentified small molecule was observed in the inter-subdomain cavity in the RD when the crystal was incubated with cumene hydroperoxide molecules, suggesting a new ligand-binding site. In addition, we confirmed the role of AphB in acid tolerance by observing an aphB-dependent increase in cadC transcript level when V. vulnificus was exposed to acidic pH. Our study contributes to the understanding of the AphB molecular mechanism in the process of recognizing the host environment.

Abstract: Summary
In segmented tissues, anterior and posterior compartments represent independent morphogenetic domains, which are made of distinct lineages separated by boundaries. During dorsal closure of the Drosophila embryo, specific “mixer cells” (MCs) are reprogrammed in a JNK-dependent manner to express the posterior determinant engrailed (en) and cross the segment boundary. Here, we show that JNK signaling induces de novo expression of en in the MCs through repression of Polycomb (Pc) and release of the en locus from the silencing PcG bodies. Whereas reprogramming occurs in MCs from all thoracic and abdominal segments, cell mixing is restricted to the central abdominal region. We demonstrate that this spatial control of MC remodeling depends on the antagonist activity of the Hox genes abdominal-A and Abdominal-B. Together, these results reveal an essential JNK/en/Pc/Hox gene regulatory network important in controlling both the plasticity of segment boundaries and developmental reprogramming.

Abstract: Summary
The CRISPR-associated protein Cas12a (Cpf1), which has been repurposed for genome editing, possesses two distinct nuclease activities: endoribonuclease activity for processing its own guide RNAs and RNA-guided DNase activity for target DNA cleavage. To elucidate the molecular basis of both activities, we determined crystal structures of Francisella novicida Cas12a bound to guide RNA and in complex with an R-loop formed by a non-cleavable guide RNA precursor and a full-length target DNA. Corroborated by biochemical experiments, these structures reveal the mechanisms of guide RNA processing and pre-ordering of the seed sequence in the guide RNA that primes Cas12a for target DNA binding. Furthermore, the R-loop complex structure reveals the strand displacement mechanism that facilitates guide-target hybridization and suggests a mechanism for double-stranded DNA cleavage involving a single active site. Together, these insights advance our mechanistic understanding of Cas12a enzymes and may contribute to further development of genome editing technologies.

Abstract: Summary
Piwi family protein Aubergine (Aub) maintains genome integrity in late germ cells of the Drosophila ovary through Piwi-associated RNA-mediated repression of transposon activities. Although it is highly expressed in germline stem cells (GSCs) and early progeny, it remains unclear whether it plays any roles in early GSC lineage development. Here we report that Aub promotes GSC self-renewal and GSC progeny differentiation. RNA-iCLIP results show that Aub binds the mRNAs encoding self-renewal and differentiation factors in cultured GSCs. Aub controls GSC self-renewal by preventing DNA-damage-induced Chk2 activation and by translationally controlling the expression of self-renewal factors. It promotes GSC progeny differentiation by translationally controlling the expression of differentiation factors, including Bam. Therefore, this study reveals a function of Aub in GSCs and their progeny, which promotes translation of self-renewal and differentiation factors by directly binding to its target mRNAs and interacting with translational initiation factors.

Abstract: Summary
The proteasome holoenzyme is activated by its regulatory particle (RP) consisting of two subcomplexes, the lid and the base. A key event in base assembly is the formation of a heterohexameric ring of AAA-ATPases, which is guided by at least four RP assembly chaperones in mammals: PAAF1, p28/gankyrin, p27/PSMD9, and S5b. Using cryogenic electron microscopy, we analyzed the non-AAA structure of the p28-bound human RP at 4.5 Å resolution and determined seven distinct conformations of the Rpn1-p28-AAA subcomplex within the p28-bound RP at subnanometer resolutions. Remarkably, the p28-bound AAA ring does not form a channel in the free RP and spontaneously samples multiple “open” and “closed” topologies at the Rpt2-Rpt6 and Rpt3-Rpt4 interfaces. Our analysis suggests that p28 assists the proteolytic core particle to select a specific conformation of the ATPase ring for RP engagement and is released in a shoehorn-like fashion in the last step of the chaperone-mediated proteasome assembly.

Abstract: Summary
Stem cell-based therapy for type 1 diabetes would benefit from implementation of a cell purification step at the pancreatic endoderm stage. This would increase the safety of the final cell product, allow the establishment of an intermediate-stage stem cell bank, and provide a means for upscaling β cell manufacturing. Comparative gene expression analysis revealed glycoprotein 2 (GP2) as a specific cell surface marker for isolating pancreatic endoderm cells (PECs) from differentiated hESCs and human fetal pancreas. Isolated GP2+ PECs efficiently differentiated into glucose responsive insulin-producing cells in vitro. We found that in vitro PEC proliferation declines due to enhanced expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors CDKN1A and CDKN2A. However, we identified a time window when reducing CDKN1A or CDKN2A expression increased proliferation and yield of GP2+ PECs. Altogether, our results contribute tools and concepts toward the isolation and use of PECs as a source for the safe production of hPSC-derived β cells.

Abstract: Summary
Saccharomyces cerevisiae mating-type switching is initiated by a double-strand break (DSB) at MATa, leaving one cut end perfectly homologous to the HMLα donor, while the second end must be processed to remove a non-homologous tail before completing repair by gene conversion (GC). When homology at the matched end is ≤150 bp, efficient repair depends on the recombination enhancer, which tethers HMLα near the DSB. Thus, homology shorter than an apparent minimum efficient processing segment can be rescued by tethering the donor near the break. When homology at the second end is ≤150 bp, second-end capture becomes inefficient and repair shifts from GC to break-induced replication (BIR). But when pol32 or pif1 mutants block BIR, GC increases 3-fold, indicating that the steps blocked by these mutations are reversible. With short second-end homology, absence of the RecQ helicase Sgs1 promotes gene conversion, whereas deletion of the FANCM-related Mph1 helicase promotes BIR.

Abstract: Summary
Isogenic cells in a common environment show substantial cell-to-cell variation in gene expression, often referred to as “expression noise.” Here, we use multiple single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets to identify features associated with high or low expression noise in mouse embryonic stem cells. These include the core promoter architecture of a gene, with CpG island promoters and a TATA box associated with low and high noise, respectively. High noise is also associated with “conflicting” chromatin states—the absence of transcription-associated histone modifications or the presence of repressive ones in active genes. Genes regulated by pluripotency factors through super-enhancers show high and correlated expression variability, consistent with fluctuations in the pluripotent state. Together, our results provide an integrated view of how core promoters, chromatin, regulation, and pluripotency fluctuations contribute to the variability of gene expression across individual stem cells.

Abstract: Summary
The tumor suppressor PTEN executes cellular functions predominantly through its phosphatase activity. Here we identified a phosphatase-independent role for PTEN during vesicular trafficking of the glucose transporter GLUT1. PTEN physically interacts with SNX27, a component of the retromer complex that recycles transmembrane receptors such as GLUT1 from endosomes to the plasma membrane. PTEN binding with SNX27 prevents GLUT1 accumulation at the plasma membrane because of defective recycling and thus reduces cellular glucose uptake. Mechanistically, PTEN blocks the association of SNX27 with VPS26 and thereby hinders assembly of a functional retromer complex during the receptor recycling process. Importantly, we found a PTEN somatic mutation (T401I) that is defective in disrupting the association between SNX27 and VPS26, suggesting a critical role for PTEN in controlling optimal GLUT1 levels at the membrane to prevent tumor progression. Together, our results reveal a fundamental role of PTEN in the regulation of the SNX27 retromer pathway, which governs glucose transport and might contribute to PTEN tumor suppressor function.

Abstract: The uncoupling protein 4 (ucp-4) gene is involved in age-dependent neurodegeneration in C. elegans. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the mechanism underlying the association between mitochondrial uncoupling and neurodegeneration by examining the effects of uncoupling agents and ucp-4 overexpression in C. elegans. Treatment with either DNP or CCCP improved neuronal defects in wild type during aging. Uncoupling agents also restored neuronal phenotypes of ucp-4 mutants to those exhibited by wild type, while ucp-4 overexpression attenuated the severity of age-dependent neurodegeneration. Neuronal improvements were further associated with reductions in mitochondrial membrane potentials. However, these age-dependent neuroprotective effects were limited in mitophagy-deficient mutant, pink-1, background.

Abstract: Summary
Promoting development and function of brown and beige fat may reduce obesity. Here, we show that fat SIRT6 expression is markedly induced by cold exposure and a β-adrenergic agonist. Deletion of SIRT6 in adipose tissue impairs the thermogenic function of brown adipocytes, causing a morphological “whitening” of brown fat, reduced oxygen (O2) consumption, obesity, decreased core body temperature, and cold sensitivity. Fat SIRT6-deleted mice exhibit increased blood glucose levels, severe insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis. Moreover, SIRT6 deficiency inhibits the browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) following cold exposure or β3-agonist treatment. Depletion of SIRT6 expression in brown adipocytes reduces expression of thermogenic genes, causing a reduction in cellular respiration. Conversely, SIRT6 overexpression in primary fat cells stimulates the thermogenic program. Mechanistically, SIRT6 interacts with and promotes phospho-ATF2 binding to the PGC-1α gene promoter to activate its expression. The present study reveals a critical role for SIRT6 in regulating thermogenesis of fat.

Abstract: Summary
Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) causes lifelong recurrent pathologies without a cure. How infection by HSV-1 triggers disease processes, especially in the immune-privileged avascular human cornea, remains a major unresolved puzzle. It has been speculated that a cornea-resident molecule must tip the balance in favor of pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic conditions observed with herpetic, as well as non-herpetic, ailments of the cornea. Here, we demonstrate that heparanase (HPSE), a host enzyme, is the molecular trigger for multiple pathologies associated with HSV-1 infection. In human corneal epithelial cells, HSV-1 infection upregulates HPSE in a manner dependent on HSV-1 infected cell protein 34.5. HPSE then relocates to the nucleus to regulate cytokine production, inhibits wound closure, enhances viral spread, and thus generates a toxic local environment. Overall, our findings implicate activated HPSE as a driver of viral pathogenesis and call for further attention to this host protein in infection and other inflammatory disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of inherited polyneuropathies. Mutations in 80 genetic loci can cause forms of CMT, resulting in demyelination and axonal dysfunction. The clinical presentation, including sensory deficits, distal muscle weakness, and atrophy, can vary greatly in severity and progression. Here, we used mouse models of CMT to demonstrate genetic interactions that result in a more severe neuropathy phenotype. The cell adhesion molecule Nrcam and the Na+ channel Scn8a (NaV1.6) are important components of nodes. Homozygous Nrcam and heterozygous Scn8a mutations synergized with both an Sh3tc2 mutation, modeling recessive demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 4C, and mutations in Gars, modeling dominant axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2D. We conclude that genetic variants perturbing the structure and function of nodes interact with mutations affecting the cable properties of axons by thinning myelin or reducing axon diameter. Therefore, genes integral to peripheral nodes are candidate modifiers of peripheral neuropathy.

Abstract: Summary
Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) regulates the DNA damage response as well as DNA double-strand break repair through homologous recombination. Here we show that ATM is hyperactive when the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) is chemically inhibited or when the DNA-PKcs gene is deleted in human cells. Pre-incubation of ATM protein with active DNA-PKcs also significantly reduces ATM activity in vitro. We characterize several phosphorylation sites in ATM that are targets of DNA-PKcs and show that phospho-mimetic mutations at these residues significantly inhibit ATM activity and impair ATM signaling upon DNA damage. In contrast, phospho-blocking mutations at one cluster of sites increase the frequency of apoptosis during normal cell growth. DNA-PKcs, which is integral to the non-homologous end joining pathway, thus negatively regulates ATM activity through phosphorylation of ATM. These observations illuminate an important regulatory mechanism for ATM that also controls DNA repair pathway choice.

Abstract: Summary
The small ventral lateral neurons (sLNvs) constitute a central circadian pacemaker in the Drosophila brain. They organize daily locomotor activity, partly through the release of the neuropeptide pigment-dispersing factor (PDF), coordinating the action of the remaining clusters required for network synchronization. Despite extensive efforts, the basic principles underlying communication among circadian clusters remain obscure. We identified classical neurotransmitters released by sLNvs through disruption of specific transporters. Adult-specific RNAi-mediated downregulation of the glycine transporter or impairment of glycine synthesis in LNv neurons increased period length by nearly an hour without affecting rhythmicity of locomotor activity. Electrophysiological recordings showed that glycine reduces spiking frequency in circadian neurons. Interestingly, downregulation of glycine receptor subunits in specific sLNv targets impaired rhythmicity, revealing involvement of glycine in information processing within the network. These data identify glycinergic inhibition of specific targets as a cue that contributes to the synchronization of the circadian network.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity has become a global issue, and the overconsumption of food is thought to be a major contributor. However, the regulatory neural circuits that regulate palatable food consumption remain unclear. Here, we report that somatostatin (SOM) neurons and GABAergic (VGAT) neurons in the basal forebrain (BF) play specific roles in regulating feeding. Optogenetic stimulation of BF SOM neurons increased fat and sucrose intake within minutes and promoted anxiety-like behaviors. Furthermore, optogenetic stimulation of projections from BF SOM neurons to the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) selectively resulted in fat intake. In addition, activation of BF VGAT neurons rapidly induced general food intake and gnawing behaviors. Whole-brain mapping of inputs and outputs showed that BF SOM neurons form bidirectional connections with several brain areas important in feeding and regulation of emotion. Collectively, these results suggest that BF SOM neurons play a selective role in hedonic feeding.

Abstract: Summary
We have combined a machine-learning approach with other strategies to optimize knockout efficiency with the CRISPR/Cas9 system. In addition, we have developed a multiplexed sgRNA expression strategy that promotes the functional ablation of single genes and allows for combinatorial targeting. These strategies have been combined to design and construct a genome-wide, sequence-verified, arrayed CRISPR library. This resource allows single-target or combinatorial genetic screens to be carried out at scale in a multiplexed or arrayed format. By conducting parallel loss-of-function screens, we compare our approach to existing sgRNA design and expression strategies.

Abstract: Oleanolic acid (OA) has neurotrophic effects on neurons, although its use as a neurological drug requires further research. In the present study, we investigated the effects of OA and OA derivatives on the neuronal differentiation of rat hippocampal neural progenitor cells. In addition, we investigated whether the class II histone deacetylase (HDAC) 5 mediates the gene expression induced by OA. We found that OA and OA derivatives induced the formation of neurite spines and the expression of synapse-related molecules. OA and OA derivatives stimulated HDAC5 phosphorylation, and concurrently the nuclear export of HDCA5 and the expression of HDAC5 target genes, indicating that OA and OA derivatives induce neural differentiation and synapse formation via a pathway that involves HDAC5 phosphorylation.

Abstract: Horses with big bone fractures have low chance to live mainly due to the lake of a proper treatment strategy. We believe that further attempts in equine bone tissue engineering will probably be required to meet all the needs for the lesion therapies. Therefore in this study we aimed to investigate the osteogenic differentiation capacity of equine adipose-derived stem cells (e-ASCs) on nano-bioactive glass (nBGs) coated poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) nanofibers scaffold (nBG-PLLA). Using electrospinning technique, PLLA scaffold was prepared successfully and coated with nBGs. Fabricated nanofibers were characterized by MTT, SEM, and FTIR analyses, and then osteogenic differentiation potential of isolated e-ASCs was investigated by the most key osteogenic markers, namely Alizarin red-S, ALP, calcium content and bone related (RUNX2, Collagen I, Osteonectin, and ALP) gene markers. Our results indicated that nBGs was successfully coated on PLLA scaffold and this scaffold had no negative (p>0.05) effect on cell growth rate as indicated by MTT assay. Moreover, e-ASCs that differentiated on nBGs-PLLA scaffold showed a higher (p<0.05) ALP activity, more (p<0.05) calcium content, and higher (p<0.05) expression of bone-related genes than that on uncoated PLLA scaffold and TCPS. According to the results, a combination of bioceramics and biopolymeric nanofibers hold valuable promising potentials to use for bone tissue engineering application and regenerative medicine.

Abstract: Objective
A new method was presented to prepare clinical-grade human adipose-derived stromal stem cells (ASCs) and its safety in vitro, such as biological characteristics and genetic features alteration were investigated.
Methods
The morphology of the ASCs which were cultured in vitro using serum-free medium was observed. Cell cycle and CD markers profile were tested by flow cytometry, while karyotype was analyzed by the chromosome G-banding technology. Growth factors expression was tested by ELISA and tumor-related genes were analyzed by the real-time PCR, respectively.
Results
ASCs were adult stem cells with spindle shape. The proliferation ratio of ASCs began to slow down after 10 passages, and was significant after 15 passages. Cell cycle analysis revealed that the percentage of G2 phase and S phase cells was stable. There was no obvious missing, translocation or dislocation in terms of karyotype. Expression level of tumor relevant genes and cytokines at different passages had no significant difference.
Conclusions
The clinical-grade ASCs prepared with this new method, less than ten passages, was safe for clinical trials.

Abstract: Summary
Abnormal folate one-carbon metabolism (FOCM) is implicated in neural tube defects (NTDs), severe malformations of the nervous system. MTHFR mediates unidirectional transfer of methyl groups from the folate cycle to the methionine cycle and, therefore, represents a key nexus in partitioning one-carbon units between FOCM functional outputs. Methionine cycle inhibitors prevent neural tube closure in mouse embryos. Similarly, the inability to use glycine as a one-carbon donor to the folate cycle causes NTDs in glycine decarboxylase (Gldc)-deficient embryos. However, analysis of Mthfr-null mouse embryos shows that neither S-adenosylmethionine abundance nor neural tube closure depend on one-carbon units derived from embryonic or maternal folate cycles. Mthfr deletion or methionine treatment prevents NTDs in Gldc-null embryos by retention of one-carbon units within the folate cycle. Overall, neural tube closure depends on the activity of both the methionine and folate cycles, but transfer of one-carbon units between the cycles is not necessary.

Abstract: In this study, qRT-PCR was employed to identify that miR-186 expression level in NSCLC tissues are highly associated with lymph node metastasis. In addition, through the application of western blotting, luciferase assay and qRT-PCR, it was found that miR-186 targeted 3′UTR of cdc42 mRNA and down-regulated cdc42 protein level in a post-transcriptional manner. Transwell assay indicated that cdc42 partially reversed the effect of miR-186 mimics. Besides, miR-186 was proved to regulate EMT by influencing biomarkers of this process and cell adhesion ability. Thus, miR-186 is a potential target for NSCLC therapy. miR-186 is proposed to be one of tumor-suppressors and may serve as a therapeutic target in NSCLC treatment.

Abstract: Neurons undergo dramatic changes in their gene expression profiles in response to synaptic stimulation. The coupling of neuronal excitation to gene transcription is well studied and is mediated by signaling pathways activated by cytoplasmic and nuclear calcium transients. Despite this, the minimum synaptic activity required to induce gene expression remains unknown. To address this, we used cultured hippocampal neurons and cellular compartment analysis of temporal activity by fluorescence in situ hybridization (catFISH) that allows detection of nascent transcripts in the cell nucleus. We found that a single burst of action potentials, consisting of 24.4±5.1 action potentials during a 6.7±1.9s depolarization of 19.5±2.0mV causing a 9.3±0.9s somatic calcium transient, is sufficient to activate transcription of the immediate early gene arc (also known as Arg3.1). The total arc mRNA yield produced after a single burst-induced nuclear calcium transient was very small and, compared to unstimulated control neurons, did not lead to a significant increase in arc mRNA levels measured using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) of cell lysates. Significantly increased arc mRNA levels became detectable in hippocampal neurons that had undergone 5–8 consecutive burst-induced nuclear calcium transients at 0.05–0.15Hz. These results indicate that a single burst-induced nuclear calcium transient can activate gene expression and that transcription is rapidly shut off after synaptic stimulation has ceased.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity-induced white adipose tissue (WAT) fibrosis is believed to accelerate WAT dysfunction. However, the cellular origin of WAT fibrosis remains unclear. Here, we show that adipocyte platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α-positive (PDGFRα+) progenitors adopt a fibrogenic phenotype in obese mice prone to visceral WAT fibrosis. More specifically, a subset of PDGFRα+ cells with high CD9 expression (CD9high) originates pro-fibrotic cells whereas their CD9low counterparts, committed to adipogenesis, are almost completely lost in the fibrotic WAT. PDGFRα pathway activation promotes a phenotypic shift toward PDGFRα+CD9high fibrogenic cells, driving pathological remodeling and altering WAT function in obesity. These findings translated to human obesity as the frequency of CD9high progenitors in omental WAT (oWAT) correlates with oWAT fibrosis level, insulin-resistance severity, and type 2 diabetes. Collectively, our data demonstrate that in addition to representing a WAT adipogenic niche, different PDGFRα+ cell subsets modulate obesity-induced WAT fibrogenesis and are associated with loss of metabolic fitness.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular metabolite balance and mitochondrial function are under circadian control, but the pathways connecting the molecular clock to these functions are unclear. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARδ) enables preferential utilization of lipids as fuel during exercise and is a major driver of exercise endurance. We show here that the circadian repressors CRY1 and CRY2 function as co-repressors for PPARδ. Cry1−/−;Cry2−/− myotubes and muscles exhibit elevated expression of PPARδ target genes, particularly in the context of exercise. Notably, CRY1/2 seem to repress a distinct subset of PPARδ target genes in muscle compared to the co-repressor NCOR1. In vivo, genetic disruption of Cry1 and Cry2 enhances sprint exercise performance in mice. Collectively, our data demonstrate that CRY1 and CRY2 modulate exercise physiology by altering the activity of several transcription factors, including CLOCK/BMAL1 and PPARδ, and thereby alter energy storage and substrate selection for energy production.

Abstract: Summary
Stress granules are mRNA-protein assemblies formed from nontranslating mRNAs. Stress granules are important in the stress response and may contribute to some degenerative diseases. Here, we describe the stress granule transcriptome of yeast and mammalian cells through RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of purified stress granule cores and single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) validation. While essentially every mRNA, and some noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), can be targeted to stress granules, the targeting efficiency varies from <1% to >95%. mRNA accumulation in stress granules correlates with longer coding and UTR regions and poor translatability. Quantifying the RNA-seq analysis by smFISH reveals that only 10% of bulk mRNA molecules accumulate in mammalian stress granules and that only 185 genes have more than 50% of their mRNA molecules in stress granules. These results suggest that stress granules may not represent a specific biological program of messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) assembly, but instead form by condensation of nontranslating mRNPs in proportion to their length and lack of association with ribosomes.

Abstract: Summary
While the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) gene functions as a tumor suppressor in a variety of cancer types, we explored its oncogenic role in breast tumorigenesis. The MEN1 gene product menin is involved in H3K4 trimethylation and co-activates transcription. We integrated ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data to identify menin target genes. Our analysis revealed that menin-dependent target gene promoters display looping to distal enhancers that are bound by menin, FOXA1 and GATA3. In this fashion, MEN1 co-regulates a proliferative breast cancer-specific gene expression program in ER+ cells. In primary mammary cells, MEN1 exerts an anti-proliferative function by regulating a distinct expression signature. Our findings clarify the cell-type-specific functions of MEN1 and inform the development of menin-directed treatments for breast cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Monoubiquitination and deubiquitination of FANCD2:FANCI heterodimer is central to DNA repair in a pathway that is defective in the cancer predisposition syndrome Fanconi anemia (FA). The “FA core complex” contains the RING-E3 ligase FANCL and seven other essential proteins that are mutated in various FA subtypes. Here, we purified recombinant FA core complex to reveal the function of these other proteins. The complex contains two spatially separate FANCL molecules that are dimerized by FANCB and FAAP100. FANCC and FANCE act as substrate receptors and restrict monoubiquitination to the FANCD2:FANCI heterodimer in only a DNA-bound form. FANCA and FANCG are dispensable for maximal in vitro ubiquitination. Finally, we show that the reversal of this reaction by the USP1:UAF1 deubiquitinase only occurs when DNA is disengaged. Our work reveals the mechanistic basis for temporal and spatial control of FANCD2:FANCI monoubiquitination that is critical for chemotherapy responses and prevention of Fanconi anemia.

Abstract: Summary
Basement membranes (BMs) are specialized extracellular matrices required for tissue organization and organ formation. We study the role of laminin and its integrin receptor in the regulation of tissue migration during Drosophila oogenesis. Egg production in Drosophila involves the collective migration of follicle cells (FCs) over the BM to shape the mature egg. We show that laminin content in the BM increases with time, whereas integrin amounts in FCs do not vary significantly. Manipulation of integrin and laminin levels reveals that a dynamic balance of integrin-laminin amounts determines the onset and speed of FC migration. Thus, the interplay of ligand-receptor levels regulates tissue migration in vivo. Laminin depletion also affects the ultrastructure and biophysical properties of the BM and results in anterior-posterior misorientation of developing follicles. Laminin emerges as a key player in the regulation of collective cell migration, tissue stiffness, and the organization of anterior-posterior polarity in Drosophila.

Abstract: Summary
Starvation causes comprehensive metabolic changes, which are still not fully understood. Here, we used quantitative proteomics and RNA sequencing to examine the temporal starvation responses in wild-type Caenorhabditis elegans and animals lacking the transcription factor HLH-30. Our findings show that starvation alters the abundance of hundreds of proteins and mRNAs in a temporal manner, many of which are involved in central metabolic pathways, including lipoprotein metabolism. We demonstrate that premature death of hlh-30 animals under starvation can be prevented by knockdown of either vit-1 or vit-5, encoding two different lipoproteins. We further show that the size and number of intestinal lipid droplets under starvation are altered in hlh-30 animals, which can be rescued by knockdown of vit-1. Taken together, this indicates that survival of hlh-30 animals under starvation is closely linked to regulation of intestinal lipid stores. We provide the most detailed poly-omic analysis of starvation responses to date, which serves as a resource for further mechanistic studies of starvation.

Abstract: Summary
Prostate cancer exhibits a lineage-specific dependence on androgen signaling. Castration resistance involves reactivation of androgen signaling or activation of alternative lineage programs to bypass androgen requirement. We describe an aberrant gastrointestinal-lineage transcriptome expressed in ∼5% of primary prostate cancer that is characterized by abbreviated response to androgen-deprivation therapy and in ∼30% of castration-resistant prostate cancer. This program is governed by a transcriptional circuit consisting of HNF4G and HNF1A. Cistrome and chromatin analyses revealed that HNF4G is a pioneer factor that generates and maintains enhancer landscape at gastrointestinal-lineage genes, independent of androgen-receptor signaling. In HNF4G/HNF1A-double-negative prostate cancer, exogenous expression of HNF4G at physiologic levels recapitulates the gastrointestinal transcriptome, chromatin landscape, and leads to relative castration resistance.

Abstract: Summary
The gut microbiome participates in numerous physiologic functions and communicates intimately with the host immune system. Antimicrobial peptides are critical components of intestinal innate immunity. We report a prominent role for antimicrobials secreted by pancreatic acini in shaping the gut microbiome that is essential for intestinal innate immunity, barrier function, and survival. Deletion of the Ca2+ channel Orai1 in pancreatic acini of adult mice resulted in 60%–70% mortality within 3 weeks. Despite robust activation of the intestinal innate immune response, mice lacking acinar Orai1 exhibited intestinal bacterial outgrowth and dysbiosis, ultimately causing systemic translocation, inflammation, and death. While digestive enzyme supplementation was ineffective, treatments constraining bacterial outgrowth (purified liquid diet, broad-spectrum antibiotics) rescued survival, feeding, and weight gain. Pancreatic levels of cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP) were reduced, and supplement of synthetic CRAMP prevented intestinal disease. These findings reveal a critical role for antimicrobial pancreatic secretion in gut innate immunity.

Abstract: Summary
MicroRNA-122, an abundant and conserved liver-specific miRNA, regulates hepatic metabolism and functions as a tumor suppressor, yet systematic and direct biochemical elucidation of the miR-122 target network remains incomplete. To this end, we performed Argonaute crosslinking immunoprecipitation (Argonaute [Ago]-CLIP) sequencing in miR-122 knockout and control mouse livers, as well as in matched human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and benign liver tissue to identify miRNA target sites transcriptome-wide in two species. We observed a majority of miR-122 binding on 3′ UTRs and coding exons followed by extensive binding to other genic and non-genic sites. Motif analysis of miR-122-dependent binding revealed a G-bulged motif in addition to canonical motifs. A large number of miR-122 targets were found to be species specific. Upregulation of several common mouse and human targets, most notably BCL9, predicted survival in HCC patients. These results broadly define the molecular consequences of miR-122 downregulation in hepatocellular carcinoma.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we describe a multiplexed immunohistochemical platform with computational image processing workflows, including image cytometry, enabling simultaneous evaluation of 12 biomarkers in one formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue section. To validate this platform, we used tissue microarrays containing 38 archival head and neck squamous cell carcinomas and revealed differential immune profiles based on lymphoid and myeloid cell densities, correlating with human papilloma virus status and prognosis. Based on these results, we investigated 24 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas from patients who received neoadjuvant GVAX vaccination and revealed that response to therapy correlated with degree of mono-myelocytic cell density and percentages of CD8+ T cells expressing T cell exhaustion markers. These data highlight the utility of in situ immune monitoring for patient stratification and provide digital image processing pipelines to the community for examining immune complexity in precious tissue sections, where phenotype and tissue architecture are preserved to improve biomarker discovery and assessment.

Abstract: Summary
Protein responses to extracellular cues are governed by gene transcription, mRNA degradation and translation, and protein degradation. In order to understand how these time-dependent processes cooperate to generate dynamic responses, we analyzed the response of human mammary cells to the epidermal growth factor (EGF). Integrating time-dependent transcript and protein data into a mathematical model, we inferred for several proteins their pre-and post-stimulus translation and degradation coefficients and found that they exhibit complex, time-dependent variation. Specifically, we identified strategies of protein production and degradation acting in concert to generate rapid, transient protein bursts in response to EGF. Remarkably, for some proteins, for which the response necessitates rapidly decreased abundance, cells exhibit a transient increase in the corresponding degradation coefficient. Our model and analysis allow inference of the kinetics of mRNA translation and protein degradation, without perturbing cells, and open a way to understanding the fundamental processes governing time-dependent protein abundance profiles.

Abstract: Summary
Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a fatal pediatric cancer with limited therapeutic options. The majority of cases of DIPG exhibit a mutation in histone-3 (H3K27M) that results in oncogenic transcriptional aberrancies. We show here that DIPG is vulnerable to transcriptional disruption using bromodomain inhibition or CDK7 blockade. Targeting oncogenic transcription through either of these methods synergizes with HDAC inhibition, and DIPG cells resistant to HDAC inhibitor therapy retain sensitivity to CDK7 blockade. Identification of super-enhancers in DIPG provides insights toward the cell of origin, highlighting oligodendroglial lineage genes, and reveals unexpected mechanisms mediating tumor viability and invasion, including potassium channel function and EPH receptor signaling. The findings presented demonstrate transcriptional vulnerabilities and elucidate previously unknown mechanisms of DIPG pathobiology.

Abstract: Summary
Current worldwide figures suggest that obesity is pandemic. Understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms would help develop viable anti-obesity therapies. Here, we assess the influence of obesity-induced inflammation on white adipocyte cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling, which is beneficial for adipocyte differentiation and thermogenesis. We find that murine gonadal and not inguinal fat is prone to obesity-induced inflammation. Correspondingly, the cGMP cascade is dysregulated in gonadal but not in inguinal fat of obese mice. Analysis of two independent human cohorts reveals a defective cGMP pathway only in visceral fat of obese subjects. Congruently, cGMP signaling is dysregulated in tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)-treated primary white adipocytes. TNF-α-mediated suppression of sGCβ1 is mediated via NF-κB, whereas PKG is repressed by JNK signaling. Additionally, TNF-α-activated JNK signaling suppresses PPARγ and aP2. Taken together, the intensity of obesity-induced inflammation dictates the amplitude of cGMP signaling dysregulation in white adipocytes through distinct pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Collective migration of epithelial cells underlies diverse tissue-remodeling events, but the mechanisms that coordinate individual cell migratory behaviors for collective movement are largely unknown. Studying the Drosophila follicular epithelium, we show that the cadherin Fat2 and the receptor tyrosine phosphatase Lar function in a planar signaling system that coordinates leading and trailing edge dynamics between neighboring cells. Fat2 signals from each cell's trailing edge to induce leading edge protrusions in the cell behind, in part by stabilizing Lar's localization in these cells. Conversely, Lar signals from each cell's leading edge to stimulate trailing edge retraction in the cell ahead. Fat2/Lar signaling is similar to planar cell polarity signaling in terms of sub-cellular protein localization; however, Fat2/Lar signaling mediates short-range communication between neighboring cells instead of transmitting long-range information across a tissue. This work defines a key mechanism promoting epithelial migration and establishes a different paradigm for planar cell-cell signaling.

Abstract: Summary
The transcription factor EB (TFEB) is an essential component of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy for the adaptive response to food deprivation. To address the physiological function of TFEB in skeletal muscle, we have used muscle-specific gain- and loss-of-function approaches. Here, we show that TFEB controls metabolic flexibility in muscle during exercise and that this action is independent of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator1α (PGC1α). Indeed, TFEB translocates into the myonuclei during physical activity and regulates glucose uptake and glycogen content by controlling expression of glucose transporters, glycolytic enzymes, and pathways related to glucose homeostasis. In addition, TFEB induces the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, and oxidative phosphorylation. This coordinated action optimizes mitochondrial substrate utilization, thus enhancing ATP production and exercise capacity. These findings identify TFEB as a critical mediator of the beneficial effects of exercise on metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
As an important regulator of macrophage cholesterol efflux and HDL biogenesis, miR-33 is a promising target for treatment of atherosclerosis, and numerous studies demonstrate that inhibition of miR-33 increases HDL levels and reduces plaque burden. However, important questions remain about how miR-33 impacts atherogenesis, including whether this protection is primarily due to direct effects on plaque macrophages or regulation of lipid metabolism in the liver. We demonstrate that miR-33 deficiency in Ldlr−/− mice promotes obesity, insulin resistance, and hyperlipidemia but does not impact plaque development. We further assess how loss of miR-33 or addition of miR-33b in macrophages and other hematopoietic cells impact atherogenesis. Macrophage-specific loss of miR-33 decreases lipid accumulation and inflammation under hyperlipidemic conditions, leading to reduced plaque burden. Therefore, the pro-atherogenic effects observed in miR-33-deficient mice are likely counterbalanced by protective effects in macrophages, which may be the primary mechanism through which anti-miR-33 therapies reduce atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Summary
After having translated short upstream open reading frames, ribosomes can re-initiate translation on the same mRNA. This process, referred to as re-initiation, controls the translation of a large fraction of mammalian cellular mRNAs, many of which are important in cancer. Key ribosomal binding proteins involved in re-initiation are the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2D (eIF2D) or the homologous complex of MCT-1/DENR. We determined the structures of these factors bound to the human 40S ribosomal subunit in complex with initiator tRNA positioned on an mRNA start codon in the P-site using a combination of cryoelectron microscopy and X-ray crystallography. The structures, supported by biochemical experiments, reveal how eIF2D emulates the function of several canonical translation initiation factors by using three independent, flexibly connected RNA binding domains to simultaneously monitor codon-anticodon interactions in the ribosomal P-site and position the initiator tRNA.

Abstract: Summary
Vms1 translocates to damaged mitochondria in response to stress, whereupon its binding partner, Cdc48, contributes to mitochondrial protein homeostasis. Mitochondrial targeting of Vms1 is mediated by its conserved mitochondrial targeting domain (MTD), which, in unstressed conditions, is inhibited by intramolecular binding to the Vms1 leucine-rich sequence (LRS). Here, we report a 2.7 Å crystal structure of Vms1 that reveals that the LRS lies in a hydrophobic groove in the autoinhibited MTD. We also demonstrate that the oxidized sterol, ergosterol peroxide, is necessary and sufficient for Vms1 localization to mitochondria, through binding the MTD in an interaction that is competitive with binding to the LRS. These data support a model in which stressed mitochondria generate an oxidized sterol receptor that recruits Vms1 to support mitochondrial protein homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Intravasation, active entry of cancer cells into the circulation, is often considered to be a relatively late event in tumor development occurring after stromal invasion. Here, we provide evidence that intravasation can be initiated early during tumor development and proceed in parallel to or independent of tumor invasion into surrounding stroma. By applying direct and unbiased intravasation-scoring methods to two histologically distinct human cancer types in live-animal models, we demonstrate that intravasation takes place almost exclusively within the tumor core, involves intratumoral vasculature, and does not involve vasculotropic cancer cells invading tumor-adjacent stroma and migrating along tumor-converging blood vessels. Highlighting an additional role for EGFR in cancer, we find that EGFR is required for the development of an intravasation-sustaining intratumoral vasculature. Intratumoral localization of intravasation supports the notion that overt metastases in cancer patients could be initiated much earlier during cancer progression than appreciated within conventional clinical tumor staging systems.

Abstract: Dietary supplements have exhibited myriads of positive health effects on human health conditions and with the advent of new technological advances, including in the fields of proteomics, genomics, and metabolomics, biological and pharmacological activities of dietary supplements are being evaluated for their ameliorative effects in human ailments. Recent interests in understanding and discovering the molecular targets of phytochemical-gene-protein-metabolite dynamics resulted in discovery of a few protein signature candidates that could potentially be used to assess the effects of dietary supplements on human health. Persimmon (Diospyros kaki) is a folk medicine, commonly used as dietary supplement in China, Japan, and South Korea, owing to its different beneficial health effects including anti-diabetic implications. However, neither mechanism of action nor molecular biomarkers have been discovered that could either validate or be used to evaluate effects of persimmon on human health. In present study, Mass Spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic studies were accomplished to discover proteomic molecular signatures that could be used to understand therapeutic potentials of persimmon leaf extract (PLE) in diabetes amelioration. Saliva, serum, and urine samples were analyzed and we propose that salivary proteins can be used for evaluating treatment effectiveness and in improving patient compliance. The present discovery proteomics study demonstrates that salivary proteomic profile changes were found as a result of PLE treatment in prediabetic subjects that could specifically be used as potential protein signature candidates.

Abstract: Summary
Telomeres employ TRF2 to protect chromosome ends from activating the DNA damage sensor MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN), thereby repressing ATM-dependent DNA damage checkpoint responses. How TRF2 prevents MRN activation at dysfunctional telomeres is unclear. Here, we show that the phosphorylation status of NBS1 determines the repair pathway choice of dysfunctional telomeres. The crystal structure of the TRF2-NBS1 complex at 3.0 Å resolution shows that the NBS1 429YQLSP433 motif interacts specifically with the TRF2TRFH domain. Phosphorylation of NBS1 serine 432 by CDK2 in S/G2 dissociates NBS1 from TRF2, promoting TRF2-Apollo/SNM1B complex formation and the protection of leading-strand telomeres. Classical-NHEJ-mediated repair of telomeres lacking TRF2 requires phosphorylated NBS1S432 to activate ATM, while interaction of de-phosphorylated NBS1S432 with TRF2 promotes alternative-NHEJ repair of telomeres lacking POT1-TPP1. Our work advances understanding of how the TRF2TRFH domain orchestrates telomere end protection and reveals how the phosphorylation status of the NBS1S432 dictates repair pathway choice of dysfunctional telomeres.

Abstract: Summary
Although signaling from phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and AKT to mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is prominently dysregulated in high-grade glial brain tumors, blockade of PI3K or AKT minimally affects downstream mTOR activity in glioma. Allosteric mTOR inhibitors, such as rapamycin, incompletely block mTORC1 compared with mTOR kinase inhibitors (TORKi). Here, we compared RapaLink-1, a TORKi linked to rapamycin, with earlier-generation mTOR inhibitors. Compared with rapamycin and Rapalink-1, TORKi showed poor durability. RapaLink-1 associated with FKBP12, an abundant mTOR-interacting protein, enabling accumulation of RapaLink-1. RapaLink-1 showed better efficacy than rapamycin or TORKi, potently blocking cancer-derived, activating mutants of mTOR.

Abstract: Summary
Potentially harmful stimuli are detected at the skin by nociceptor sensory neurons that drive rapid protective withdrawal reflexes and pain. We set out to define, at a millisecond timescale, the relationship between the activity of these sensory neurons and the resultant behavioral output. Brief optogenetic activation of cutaneous nociceptors was found to activate only a single action potential in each fiber. This minimal input was used to determine high-speed behavioral responses in freely behaving mice. The localized stimulus generated widespread dynamic repositioning and alerting sub-second behaviors whose nature and timing depended on the context of the animal and its position, activity, and alertness. Our findings show that the primary response to injurious stimuli is not limited, fixed, or localized, but is dynamic, and that it involves recruitment and gating of multiple circuits distributed throughout the central nervous system at a sub-second timescale to effectively both alert to the presence of danger and minimize risk of harm.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial protein (MP) dysfunction has been linked to neurodegenerative disorders (NDs); however, the discovery of the molecular mechanisms underlying NDs has been impeded by the limited characterization of interactions governing MP function. Here, using mass spectrometry (MS)-based analysis of 210 affinity-purified mitochondrial (mt) fractions isolated from 27 epitope-tagged human ND-linked MPs in HEK293 cells, we report a high-confidence MP network including 1,964 interactions among 772 proteins (>90% previously unreported). Nearly three-fourths of these interactions were confirmed in mouse brain and multiple human differentiated neuronal cell lines by primary antibody immunoprecipitation and MS, with many linked to NDs and autism. We show that the SOD1-PRDX5 interaction, critical for mt redox homeostasis, can be perturbed by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-linked SOD1 allelic variants and establish a functional role for ND-linked factors coupled with IκBɛ in NF-κB activation. Our results identify mechanisms for ND-linked MPs and expand the human mt interaction landscape.

Abstract: Summary
Drug combinations are synergistic when their combined efficacy exceeds the sum of the individual actions, but they rarely include ineffective drugs that become effective only in combination. We identified several “enabling pairs” of neutralizing and non-neutralizing anti-ebolavirus monoclonal antibodies, whose combination exhibited new functional profiles, including transforming a non-neutralizing antibody to a neutralizer. Sub-neutralizing concentrations of antibodies 2G4 or m8C4 enabled non-neutralizing antibody FVM09 (IC50 >1 μM) to exhibit potent neutralization (IC50 1–10 nM). While FVM09 or m8C4 alone failed to protect Ebola-virus-infected mice, a combination of the two antibodies provided 100% protection. Furthermore, non-neutralizers FVM09 and FVM02 exponentially enhanced the potency of two neutralizing antibodies against both Ebola and Sudan viruses. We identified a hotspot for the binding of these enabling antibody pairs near the interface of the glycan cap and GP2. Enabling cooperativity may be an underappreciated phenomenon for viruses, with implications for the design and development of immunotherapeutics and vaccines.

Abstract: Summary
Interferon-regulatory factors (IRFs) are a family of transcription factors (TFs) that translate viral recognition into antiviral responses, including type I interferon (IFN) production. Dengue virus (DENV) and other clinically important flaviviruses are suppressed by type I IFN. While mice lacking the type I IFN receptor (Ifnar1−/−) succumb to DENV infection, we found that mice deficient in three transcription factors controlling type I IFN production (Irf3−/− Irf5−/− Irf7−/− triple knockout [TKO]) survive DENV challenge. DENV infection of TKO mice resulted in minimal type I IFN production but a robust type II IFN (IFN-γ) response. Using loss-of-function approaches for various molecules, we demonstrate that the IRF-3-, IRF-5-, IRF-7-independent pathway predominantly utilizes IFN-γ and, to a lesser degree, type I IFNs. This pathway signals via IRF-1 to stimulate interleukin-12 (IL-12) production and IFN-γ response. These results reveal a key antiviral role for IRF-1 by activating both type I and II IFN responses during DENV infection.

Abstract: Nitrogen is one of the most important mineral elements for plant growth. We studied the functional roles of Oryza sativa DNA BINDING WITH ONE FINGER 18 (OsDOF18) in controlling ammonium uptake. The growth of null mutants of OsDOF18 was retarded in a medium containing ammonium as the sole nitrogen source. In contrast, those mutants grew normally in a medium with nitrate as the sole nitrogen source. The gene expression was induced by ammonium but not by nitrate. Uptake of ammonium was lower in osdof18 mutants than in the wild type, while that of nitrate was not affected by the mutation. This indicated that OsDOF18 is involved in regulating ammonium transport. Among the 10 ammonium transporter genes examined here, expression of OsAMT1;1, OsAMT1;3, OsAMT2;1, and OsAMT4;1 was reduced in osdof18 mutants, demonstrating that the ammonium transporter genes function downstream of OsDOF18. Genes for nitrogen assimilation were also affected in the mutants. These results provide evidence that OsDOF18 mediates ammonium transport and nitrogen distribution, which then affects nitrogen use efficiency.

Abstract: Adipose tissue plays a central role in regulating dynamic crosstalk between tissues and organs. A detailed description of molecules that are differentially expressed upon changes in adipose tissue mass is expected to increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie obesity and related metabolic co-morbidities. Our previous studies suggest a possible link between endophilins (SH3Grb2 proteins) and changes in body weight. To explore this further, we sought to assess the distribution of endophilin A2 (EA2) in human adipose tissue and experimental animals. Human paired adipose tissue samples (subcutaneous and visceral) were collected from subjects undergoing elective abdominal surgery and abdominal liposuction. We observed elevated EA2 gene expression in the subcutaneous compared to that in the visceral human adipose tissue. EA2 gene expression negatively correlated with adiponectin and chemerin in visceral adipose tissue, and positively correlated with TNF-α in subcutaneous adipose tissue. EA2 gene expression was significantly downregulated during differentiation of preadipocytes in vitro. In conclusion, this study provides a description of EA2 distribution and emphasizes a need to study the roles of this protein during the progression of obesity.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria play an integral role in cell death, autophagy, immunity, and inflammation. We previously showed that Nur77, an orphan nuclear receptor, induces apoptosis by targeting mitochondria. Here, we report that celastrol, a potent anti-inflammatory pentacyclic triterpene, binds Nur77 to inhibit inflammation and induce autophagy in a Nur77-dependent manner. Celastrol promotes Nur77 translocation from the nucleus to mitochondria, where it interacts with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), a scaffold protein and E3 ubiquitin ligase important for inflammatory signaling. The interaction is mediated by an LxxLL motif in TRAF2 and results not only in the inhibition of TRAF2 ubiquitination but also in Lys63-linked Nur77 ubiquitination. Under inflammatory conditions, ubiquitinated Nur77 resides at mitochondria, rendering them sensitive to autophagy, an event involving Nur77 interaction with p62/SQSTM1. Together, our results identify Nur77 as a critical intracellular target for celastrol and unravel a mechanism of Nur77-dependent clearance of inflamed mitochondria to alleviate inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
The study of enhancers has been hampered by the scarcity of methods to systematically quantify their endogenous activity. We develop Mosaic-seq to systematically perturb enhancers and measure their endogenous activities at single-cell resolution. Mosaic-seq uses a CRISPR barcoding system to jointly measure a cell’s transcriptome and its sgRNA modulators, thus quantifying the effects of dCas9-KRAB-mediated enhancer repression in single cells. Applying Mosaic-seq to 71 constituent enhancers from 15 super-enhancers, our analysis of 51,448 sgRNA-induced transcriptomes finds that only a small number of constituents are major effectors of target gene expression. Binding of p300 and RNAPII are key features of these constituents. We determine two key parameters of enhancer activity in single cells: their penetrance in a population and their contribution to expression in these cells. Through combinatorial interrogation, we find that simultaneous repression of multiple weak constituents can alter super-enhancer activity in a manner greatly exceeding repression of individual constituents.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian embryos transiently exhibit aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect), a metabolic adaptation also observed in cancer cells. The role of this particular type of metabolism during vertebrate organogenesis is currently unknown. Here, we provide evidence for spatiotemporal regulation of glycolysis in the posterior region of mouse and chicken embryos. We show that a posterior glycolytic gradient is established in response to graded transcription of glycolytic enzymes downstream of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling. We demonstrate that glycolysis controls posterior elongation of the embryonic axis by regulating cell motility in the presomitic mesoderm and by controlling specification of the paraxial mesoderm fate in the tail bud. Our results suggest that glycolysis in the tail bud coordinates Wnt and FGF signaling to promote elongation of the embryonic axis.

Abstract: Summary
The anti-FcRH5/CD3 T cell-dependent bispecific antibody (TDB) targets the B cell lineage marker FcRH5 expressed in multiple myeloma (MM) tumor cells. We demonstrate that TDBs trigger T cell receptor activation by inducing target clustering and exclusion of CD45 phosphatase from the synapse. The dimensions of the target molecule play a key role in the efficiency of the synapse formation. The anti-FcRH5/CD3 TDB kills human plasma cells and patient-derived myeloma cells at picomolar concentrations and results in complete depletion of B cells and bone marrow plasma cells in cynomolgus monkeys. These data demonstrate the potential for the anti-FcRH5/CD3 TDB, alone or in combination with inhibition of PD-1/PD-L1 signaling, in the treatment of MM and other B cell malignancies.

Abstract: Summary
Protein synthesis is the most energy-consuming process in a proliferating cell, and understanding what controls protein abundances represents a key question in biology and biotechnology. We quantified absolute abundances of 5,354 mRNAs and 2,198 proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under ten environmental conditions and protein turnover for 1,384 proteins under a reference condition. The overall correlation between mRNA and protein abundances across all conditions was low (0.46), but for differentially expressed proteins (n = 202), the median mRNA-protein correlation was 0.88. We used these data to model translation efficiencies and found that they vary more than 400-fold between genes. Non-linear regression analysis detected that mRNA abundance and translation elongation were the dominant factors controlling protein synthesis, explaining 61% and 15% of its variance. Metabolic flux balance analysis further showed that only mitochondrial fluxes were positively associated with changes at the transcript level. The present dataset represents a crucial expansion to the current resources for future studies on yeast physiology.

Abstract: Summary
Dendrite aberration is a common feature of neurodegenerative diseases caused by protein toxicity, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely elusive. Here, we show that nuclear polyglutamine (polyQ) toxicity resulted in defective terminal dendrite elongation accompanied by a loss of Golgi outposts (GOPs) and a decreased supply of plasma membrane (PM) in Drosophila class IV dendritic arborization (da) (C4 da) neurons. mRNA sequencing revealed that genes downregulated by polyQ proteins included many secretory pathway-related genes, including COPII genes regulating GOP synthesis. Transcription factor enrichment analysis identified CREB3L1/CrebA, which regulates COPII gene expression. CrebA overexpression in C4 da neurons restores the dysregulation of COPII genes, GOP synthesis, and PM supply. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-PCR revealed that CrebA expression is regulated by CREB-binding protein (CBP), which is sequestered by polyQ proteins. Furthermore, co-overexpression of CrebA and Rac1 synergistically restores the polyQ-induced dendrite pathology. Collectively, our results suggest that GOPs impaired by polyQ proteins contribute to dendrite pathology through the CBP-CrebA-COPII pathway.

Abstract: Summary
The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex is highly conserved from yeast to human, and aberrant SWI/SNF complexes contribute to human disease. The Snf5/SMARCB1/INI1 subunit of SWI/SNF is a tumor suppressor frequently lost in pediatric rhabdoid cancers. We examined the effects of Snf5 loss on the composition, nucleosome binding, recruitment, and remodeling activities of yeast SWI/SNF. The Snf5 subunit is shown by crosslinking-mass spectrometry (CX-MS) and subunit deletion analysis to interact with the ATPase domain of Snf2 and to form a submodule consisting of Snf5, Swp82, and Taf14. Snf5 promotes binding of the Snf2 ATPase domain to nucleosomal DNA and enhances the catalytic and nucleosome remodeling activities of SWI/SNF. Snf5 is also required for SWI/SNF recruitment by acidic transcription factors. RNA-seq analysis suggests that both the recruitment and remodeling functions of Snf5 are required in vivo for SWI/SNF regulation of gene expression. Thus, loss of SNF5 alters the structure and function of SWI/SNF.

Abstract: Summary
Targeting the tumor vasculature with antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) is a promising anti-cancer strategy that in order to be realized must overcome several obstacles, including identification of suitable targets and optimal warheads. Here, we demonstrate that the cell-surface protein CD276/B7-H3 is broadly overexpressed by multiple tumor types on both cancer cells and tumor-infiltrating blood vessels, making it a potentially ideal dual-compartment therapeutic target. In preclinical studies CD276 ADCs armed with a conventional MMAE warhead destroyed CD276-positive cancer cells, but were ineffective against tumor vasculature. In contrast, pyrrolobenzodiazepine-conjugated CD276 ADCs killed both cancer cells and tumor vasculature, eradicating large established tumors and metastases, and improving long-term overall survival. CD276-targeted dual-compartment ablation could aid in the development of highly selective broad-acting anti-cancer therapies.

Abstract: In this biphasic study, 45 male wistar rats were divided into 9 groups. In Phase 1, Group 1 was treated with normal saline and served as the overall control, group 2 was treated with 95% Ethanol and represents the ulcer control, groups 3 and 4 received coconut water (CW; 4ml/100g BWt) and milk (CM; 4ml/100g BWt) for 4weeks while group 5 received Omeprazole (Omep; 20mg/kg BWt) during terminal week. 95% Ethanol-induced ulceration followed the treatments in all except group 1. In the second phase, Group 1 was the overall control, group 2 served as ulcer control by receiving acetic acid only, group 3 received coconut milk, and group 4 received omep. CM and omep were administered post-ulcer induction for 3 and 6days twice daily. Blood collection after 1hour was through cardiac puncture for haemocytometry, and gastric tissues harvested for histopathological investigations. Results showed significantly reduced ulcer score and gastric lesion index in Omep, CW and CM groups compared to ulcer control. WBC, neutrophil, lymphocyte counts in Omep, CW and CM groups were significantly reduced compared to ulcer and overall control groups. C-reactive protein was significantly reduced in CM compared to control. Neutrophil Infiltration score reduced while mucus cell density increased significantly in Omep; CM compared to control. EGFR and CD 31 assessment revealed significantly higher expressions in coconut-milk group compared to the ulcer control. We conclude that the protective effects of coconut (water and milk) is expressed by inflammation suppression, upregulation of mucus cell population and catalyses mucosa homeostasis via angiogenesis and mucosal cell proliferation following mucosa. erosion.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanistic (or mammalian) target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) integrates signals from growth factors and nutrients to control biosynthetic processes, including protein, lipid, and nucleic acid synthesis. We find that the mTORC1 pathway is responsive to changes in purine nucleotides in a manner analogous to its sensing of amino acids. Depletion of cellular purines, but not pyrimidines, inhibits mTORC1, and restoration of intracellular adenine nucleotides via addition of exogenous purine nucleobases or nucleosides acutely reactivates mTORC1. Adenylate sensing by mTORC1 is dependent on the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) protein complex and its regulation of Rheb upstream of mTORC1, but independent of energy stress and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Even though mTORC1 signaling is not acutely sensitive to changes in intracellular guanylates, long-term depletion of guanylates decreases Rheb protein levels. Our findings suggest that nucleotide sensing, like amino acid sensing, enables mTORC1 to tightly coordinate nutrient availability with the synthesis of macromolecules, such as protein and nucleic acids, produced from those nutrients.

Here, we reveal that ACTL6A, encoding an SWI/SNF subunit linked to stem cell and progenitor cell function, is frequently co-amplified and highly expressed together with the p53 family member p63 in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). ACTL6A and p63 physically interact, cooperatively controlling a transcriptional program that promotes proliferation and suppresses differentiation, in part through activation of the Hippo-YAP pathway via regulators including WWC1. Ectopic ACTL6A/p63 expression promotes tumorigenesis, while ACTL6A expression and YAP activation are highly correlated in primary HNSCC and predict poor patient survival. Thus, ACTL6A and p63 collaborate as oncogenic drivers in HNSCC.

Abstract: Summary
To what extent the lineage decisions of activated CD4+ T cells are determined by the quality of T cell receptor (TCR) ligation is incompletely understood. Here, we show that individual T cells expressing identical TCRs take highly variable fate decisions despite binding the same ligand. We identify a mathematical model that correctly captures this probabilistic behavior and allows one to formalize changes in TCR signal quality—due to cognate versus altered peptide ligation—as changes of lineage-specific proliferation and differentiation rates. We show that recall responses also adhere to this probabilistic framework requiring recruitment of multiple memory clones to provide reliable differentiation patterns. By extending our framework to simulate hypothetical TCRs of distinct binding strength, we reconstruct primary and secondary response patterns emerging from a polyclonal TCR repertoire in silico. Collectively, these data suggest that individual T cells harboring distinct TCRs generate overlapping primary differentiation patterns that segregate only upon repetitive immunization.

Abstract: Summary
TRAIL is a potent inducer of apoptosis and has been studied almost exclusively in this context. However, TRAIL can also induce NFκB-dependent expression of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Surprisingly, whereas inhibition of caspase activity blocked TRAIL-induced apoptosis, but not cytokine production, knock down or deletion of caspase-8 suppressed both outcomes, suggesting that caspase-8 participates in TRAIL-induced inflammatory signaling in a scaffold role. Consistent with this, introduction of a catalytically inactive caspase-8 mutant into CASP-8 null cells restored TRAIL-induced cytokine production, but not cell death. Furthermore, affinity precipitation of the native TRAIL receptor complex revealed that pro-caspase-8 was required for recruitment of RIPK1, via FADD, to promote NFκB activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production downstream. Thus, caspase-8 can serve in two distinct roles in response to TRAIL receptor engagement, as a scaffold for assembly of a Caspase-8-FADD-RIPK1 “FADDosome” complex, leading to NFκB-dependent inflammation, or as a protease that promotes apoptosis.

Abstract: In the Arabidopsis genome, approximately 80 MAP3Ks (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases) have been identified. However, only a few of them have been characterized, and the functions of most MAP3Ks are largely unknown. In this paper, we report the function of MAP3K16 and several other MAP3Ks, MAP3K14/15/17/18, whose expression is salt-inducible. We prepared MAP3K16 overexpression (OX) lines and analyzed their phenotypes. The result showed that the transgenic plants were ABA-insensitive during seed germination and cotyledon greening stage but their root growth was ABA-hypersensitive. The OX lines were more susceptible to water-deficit condition at later growth stage in soil. A MAP3K16 knockout (KO) line, on the other hand, exhibited opposite phenotypes. In similar transgenic analyses, we found that MAP3K14/15/17/18 OX and KO lines displayed similar phenotypes to those of MA3K16, suggesting the functional redundancy among them. MAP3K16 possesses in vitro kinase activity, and we carried out two-hybrid analyses to identify MAP3K16 substrates. Our results indicate that MAP3K16 interacts with MKK3 and the negative regulator of ABA response, ABR1, in yeast. Furthermore, MAP3K16 recombinant protein could phosphorylate MKK3 and ABR1, suggesting that they might be MAP3K16 substrates. Collectively, our results demonstrate that MAP3K16 and MAP3K14/15/17/18 are involved in ABA response, playing negative or positive roles depending on developmental stage and that MAP3K16 may function via MKK3 and ABR1.

Abstract: Summary
Cold and other environmental factors induce “browning” of white fat depots—development of beige adipocytes with morphological and functional resemblance to brown fat. Similar to brown fat, beige adipocytes are assumed to express mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and are thermogenic due to the UCP1-mediated H+ leak across the inner mitochondrial membrane. However, this assumption has never been tested directly. Herein we patch clamped the inner mitochondrial membrane of beige and brown fat to provide a direct comparison of their thermogenic H+ leak (IH). All inguinal beige adipocytes had robust UCP1-dependent IH comparable to brown fat, but it was about three times less sensitive to purine nucleotide inhibition. Strikingly, only ∼15% of epididymal beige adipocytes had IH, while in the rest UCP1-dependent IH was undetectable. Despite the absence of UCP1 in the majority of epididymal beige adipocytes, these cells employ prominent creatine cycling as a UCP1-independent thermogenic mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
We present a method for automated spike sorting for recordings with high-density, large-scale multielectrode arrays. Exploiting the dense sampling of single neurons by multiple electrodes, an efficient, low-dimensional representation of detected spikes consisting of estimated spatial spike locations and dominant spike shape features is exploited for fast and reliable clustering into single units. Millions of events can be sorted in minutes, and the method is parallelized and scales better than quadratically with the number of detected spikes. Performance is demonstrated using recordings with a 4,096-channel array and validated using anatomical imaging, optogenetic stimulation, and model-based quality control. A comparison with semi-automated, shape-based spike sorting exposes significant limitations of conventional methods. Our approach demonstrates that it is feasible to reliably isolate the activity of up to thousands of neurons and that dense, multi-channel probes substantially aid reliable spike sorting.

Abstract: Summary
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous disease, but genetically defined models can provide an entry point to studying the molecular underpinnings of this disorder. We generated germline mutant mice with loss-of-function mutations in Chd8, a de novo mutation strongly associated with ASD, and demonstrate that these mice display hallmark ASD behaviors, macrocephaly, and craniofacial abnormalities similar to patient phenotypes. Chd8+/– mice display a broad, brain-region-specific dysregulation of major regulatory and cellular processes, most notably histone and chromatin modification, mRNA and protein processing, Wnt signaling, and cell-cycle regulation. We also find altered synaptic physiology in medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens. Perturbation of Chd8 in adult mice recapitulates improved acquired motor learning behavior found in Chd8+/– animals, suggesting a role for CHD8 in adult striatal circuits. These results support a mechanism linking chromatin modification to striatal dysfunction and the molecular pathology of ASD.

Abstract: Summary
Prepared movements are more efficient than those that are not prepared for. Although changes in cortical activity have been observed prior to a forthcoming action, the circuits involved in motor preparation remain unclear. Here, we use in vivo two-photon calcium imaging to uncover changes in the motor cortex during variable waiting periods prior to a forepaw reaching task in mice. Consistent with previous reports, we observed a subset of neurons with increased activity during the waiting period; however, these neurons did not account for the degree of preparation as defined by reaction time (RT). Instead, the suppression of activity of distinct neurons in the same cortical area better accounts for RT. This suppression of neural activity resulted in a distinct and reproducible pattern when mice were well prepared. Thus, the selective suppression of network activity in the motor cortex may be a key feature of prepared movements.

Abstract: Summary
Mutant KRAS and c-MYC are oncogenic drivers and rational therapeutic targets for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Although tumor growth and homeostasis are largely dependent on these oncogenes, a few residual cancer cells are able to survive the ablation of mutant KRAS and c-MYC. By performing a genome-wide gene expression analysis of in vivo-derived bulk tumor cells and residual cancer cells lacking the expression of mutant KRAS or c-MYC, we have identified an increase in autocrine IGF1/AKT signaling as a common survival mechanism in dormant cancer cells. The pharmacological inhibition of IGF-1R reduces residual disease burden and cancer recurrence, suggesting that this molecular pathway is crucial for the survival of cancer cells in the absence of the primary oncogenic drivers.

Abstract: Summary
Lipid droplets (LDs) provide an “on-demand” source of fatty acids (FAs) that can be mobilized in response to fluctuations in nutrient abundance. Surprisingly, the amount of LDs increases during prolonged periods of nutrient deprivation. Why cells store FAs in LDs during an energy crisis is unknown. Our data demonstrate that mTORC1-regulated autophagy is necessary and sufficient for starvation-induced LD biogenesis. The ER-resident diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) selectively channels autophagy-liberated FAs into new, clustered LDs that are in close proximity to mitochondria and are lipolytically degraded. However, LDs are not required for FA delivery to mitochondria but instead function to prevent acylcarnitine accumulation and lipotoxic dysregulation of mitochondria. Our data support a model in which LDs provide a lipid buffering system that sequesters FAs released during the autophagic degradation of membranous organelles, reducing lipotoxicity. These findings reveal an unrecognized aspect of the cellular adaptive response to starvation, mediated by LDs.

Abstract: Summary
Cells exposed to hypoxia experience replication stress but do not accumulate DNA damage, suggesting sustained DNA replication. Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is the only enzyme capable of de novo synthesis of deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs). However, oxygen is an essential cofactor for mammalian RNR (RRM1/RRM2 and RRM1/RRM2B), leading us to question the source of dNTPs in hypoxia. Here, we show that the RRM1/RRM2B enzyme is capable of retaining activity in hypoxia and therefore is favored over RRM1/RRM2 in order to preserve ongoing replication and avoid the accumulation of DNA damage. We found two distinct mechanisms by which RRM2B maintains hypoxic activity and identified responsible residues in RRM2B. The importance of RRM2B in the response to tumor hypoxia is further illustrated by correlation of its expression with a hypoxic signature in patient samples and its roles in tumor growth and radioresistance. Our data provide mechanistic insight into RNR biology, highlighting RRM2B as a hypoxic-specific, anti-cancer therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
Evidence suggests that altered gut microbiota composition may be involved in the development of obesity. Studies using mice made obese with refined high-fat diets have supported this; however, these have commonly used chow as a control diet, introducing confounding factors from differences in dietary composition that have a key role in shaping microbiota composition. We compared the effects of feeding a refined high-fat diet with those of feeding either a refined low-fat diet or a chow diet on gut microbiota composition and host physiology. Feeding both refined low- or high-fat diets resulted in large alterations in the gut microbiota composition, intestinal fermentation, and gut morphology, compared to a chow diet. However, body weight, body fat, and glucose intolerance only increased in mice fed the refined high-fat diet. The choice of control diet can dissociate broad changes in microbiota composition from obesity, raising questions about the previously proposed relationship between gut microbiota and obesity.

Abstract: Summary
State of the art techniques have been developed to isolate and analyze cells from various tissues, aiming to capture their in vivo state. However, the majority of cell isolation protocols involve lengthy mechanical and enzymatic dissociation steps followed by flow cytometry, exposing cells to stress and disrupting their physiological niche. Focusing on adult skeletal muscle stem cells, we have developed a protocol that circumvents the impact of isolation procedures and captures cells in their native quiescent state. We show that current isolation protocols induce major transcriptional changes accompanied by specific histone modifications while having negligible effects on DNA methylation. In addition to proposing a protocol to avoid isolation-induced artifacts, our study reveals previously undetected quiescence and early activation genes of potential biological interest.

Abstract: Ecto-5′-nucleotidase (CD73) generates adenosine, an osteoblast activator and key regulator of skeletal growth. It is unknown, however, if CD73 regulates osteogenic differentiation during fracture healing in adulthood, and in particular how CD73 activity regulates intramembranous bone repair in the elderly. Monocortical tibial defects were created in 46–52-week-old wild type (WT) and CD73 knock-out mice (CD73−/−) mice. Injury repair was analyzed at post-operative days 5, 7, 14 and 21 by micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), histomorphometry, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunostaining, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) histochemistry. Middle-aged CD73 knock-out mice exhibited delayed bone regeneration and significantly reduced bone matrix deposition detected by histomorphometry and micro-CT. Cell proliferation, ALP activity and osteoclast number were reduced in the CD73−/− mice, suggesting a combined defect in bone formation and resorption due the absence of CD73 activity in this model of intramembranous bone repair. Results from this study demonstrate that osteoblast activation through CD73 activity is essential during bone repair in aging mice, and it may present a drugable target for future biomimetic therapeutic approaches that aim at enhancing bone formation in the elderly patients.
