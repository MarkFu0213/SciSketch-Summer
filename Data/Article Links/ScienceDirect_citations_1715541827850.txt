Abstract: Summary
Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) technology enables stable and regulated gene repression. For establishing experimentally versatile RNAi tools and minimizing toxicities, synthetic shRNAs can be embedded into endogenous microRNA contexts. However, due to our incomplete understanding of microRNA biogenesis, such “shRNAmirs” often fail to trigger potent knockdown, especially when expressed from a single genomic copy. Following recent advances in design of synthetic shRNAmir stems, here we take a systematic approach to optimize the experimental miR-30 backbone. Among several favorable features, we identify a conserved element 3′ of the basal stem as critically required for optimal shRNAmir processing and implement it in an optimized backbone termed “miR-E”, which strongly increases mature shRNA levels and knockdown efficacy. Existing miR-30 reagents can be easily converted to miR-E, and its combination with up-to-date design rules establishes a validated and accessible platform for generating effective single-copy shRNA libraries that will facilitate the functional annotation of the genome.

Abstract: Ryanodine receptors (RyR) are Ca2+-sensitive ion channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane, and are important effectors of SR Ca2+ release and smooth muscle excitation–contraction coupling. While the relationship between RyR activation and contraction is well characterized in arteries, little is known about the role of RyR in excitation–contraction coupling in veins. We hypothesized that RyR are present and directly coupled to contraction in rat aorta (RA) and vena cava (RVC). RA and RVC expressed mRNA for all 3 RyR subtypes, and immunofluorescence showed RyR protein was present in RA and RVC smooth muscle cells. RA and RVC rings contracted when Ca2+ was re-introduced after stores depletion with thapsigargin (1μM), indicating both tissues contained intracellular Ca2+ stores. To assess RyR function, contraction was then measured in RA and RVC exposed to the RyR activator caffeine (20mM). In RA, caffeine caused contraction that was attenuated by the RyR antagonists ryanodine (10μM) and tetracaine (100μM). However, caffeine (20mM) did not contract RVC. We next measured contraction and intracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+i) simultaneously in RA and RVC exposed to caffeine. While caffeine increased Ca2+i and contracted RA, it had no significant effect on Ca2+i or contraction in RVC. These data suggest that ryanodine receptors, while present in both RA and RVC, are inactive and uncoupled from Ca2+ release and contraction in RVC.

Abstract: Summary
Lipodystrophies represent a group of heterogeneous disorders characterized by loss of fat tissue. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using mice carrying an ERCC1-XPF DNA repair defect systematically or in adipocytes, we show that DNA damage signaling triggers a chronic autoinflammatory response leading to fat depletion. Ercc1−/− and aP2-Ercc1F/− fat depots show extensive gene expression similarities to lipodystrophic Pparγldi/+ animals, focal areas of ruptured basement membrane, the reappearance of primary cilia, necrosis, fibrosis, and a marked decrease in adiposity. We find that persistent DNA damage in aP2-Ercc1F/− fat depots and in adipocytes ex vivo triggers the induction of proinflammatory factors by promoting transcriptionally active histone marks and the dissociation of nuclear receptor corepressor complexes from promoters; the response is cell autonomous and requires ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM). Thus, persistent DNA damage-driven autoinflammation plays a causative role in adipose tissue degeneration, with important ramifications for progressive lipodystrophies and natural aging.

Abstract: Summary
Cranial placodes are embryonic structures essential for sensory and endocrine organ development. Human placode development has remained largely inaccessible despite the serious medical conditions caused by the dysfunction of placode-derived tissues. Here, we demonstrate the efficient derivation of cranial placodes from human pluripotent stem cells. Timed removal of the BMP inhibitor Noggin, a component of the dual-SMAD inhibition strategy of neural induction, triggers placode induction at the expense of CNS fates. Concomitant inhibition of fibroblast growth factor signaling disrupts placode derivation and induces surface ectoderm. Further fate specification at the preplacode stage enables the selective generation of placode-derived trigeminal ganglia capable of in vivo engraftment, mature lens fibers, and anterior pituitary hormone-producing cells that upon transplantation produce human growth hormone and adrenocorticotropic hormone in vivo. Our results establish a powerful experimental platform to study human cranial placode development and set the stage for the development of human cell-based therapies in sensory and endocrine disease.

Abstract: Summary
Precise spatiotemporal regulation of signaling activators and inhibitors can help limit developmental crosstalk between neighboring tissues during morphogenesis, homeostasis, and regeneration. Here, we find that the secreted Wnt inhibitor Dkk1b is abundantly produced by dense regions of androgen-regulated epidermal tubercles (ETs) on the surfaces of adult male zebrafish pectoral fins. High-speed videos and amputation experiments reveal that pectoral fins and their ETs are used for male spawning. Formation and vigorous turnover of ETs involve Dkk1b induction and maintenance, whereas Dkk1b is typically restricted from the regeneration blastema after an amputation injury. When amputation occurs through a region containing ETs, a Dkk1b-enriched wound epidermis forms and blastema formation is disrupted, compromising regeneration. Thus, homeostatic signaling by key breeding ornaments can interfere with injury-activated tissue regeneration. Our findings help explain sexually dimorphic fin regeneration in zebrafish and have implications for how regenerative potential might decline as development progresses or during species evolution.

Abstract: Summary
Holliday junctions (HJs) are four-way DNA intermediates that form during homologous recombination, and their efficient resolution is essential for chromosome segregation. Here, we show that three structure-selective endonucleases, namely SLX1-SLX4, MUS81-EME1, and GEN1, define two pathways of HJ resolution in human cells. One pathway is mediated by GEN1, whereas SLX1-SLX4 and MUS81-EME1 provide a second and genetically distinct pathway (SLX-MUS). Cells depleted for SLX-MUS or GEN1 pathway proteins exhibit severe defects in chromosome segregation and reduced survival. In response to CDK-mediated phosphorylation, SLX1-SLX4 and MUS81-EME1 associate at the G2/M transition to form a stable SLX-MUS holoenzyme, which can be reconstituted in vitro. Biochemical studies show that SLX-MUS is a HJ resolvase that coordinates the active sites of two distinct endonucleases during HJ resolution. This cleavage reaction is more efficient and orchestrated than that mediated by SLX1-SLX4 alone, which exhibits a potent nickase activity that acts promiscuously upon DNA secondary structures.

Abstract: Summary
ATP-dependent NuRD repressor complexes involve combinatorial assembly of its subunits. However, the mechanism of gene transcription by MTA1/NuRD remains enigmatic. Here we report that MTA1 methylation by G9a methytransferase and demethylation by LSD1 determines the nucleosome remodeling and transcriptional outcome. Contrary to the current static repressor model of the NuRD complex, we discovered that MTA1 association with nucleosomes and corepressor/coactivator complexes is dynamic. While methylated MTA1 is required for the NuRD repressor complex, demethylated MTA1 recognizes the bivalent histone H3K4-AcK9 mark and recruits coactivator NURF-trithorax remodeling complex in a signaling-dependent manner. MTA1’s lysine 532 methylation represents a molecular switch as methylated and demethylated MTA1 nucleate NuRD or NURF complexes with opposite functions in a cyclical manner. In addition, MTA1 possesses an inherent histone amplifier activity with an instructive role in impacting the epigenetic landscape, providing a new perspective to the molecular governance of dual coregulator functions of a master coregulator.

Abstract: Summary
Kinetochores are the central force-generating machines that move chromosomes during cell division. It is generally assumed that kinetochores move in an autonomous manner. However, we reveal here that movements of neighboring sister-kinetochore pairs in metaphase are correlated in a distance-dependent manner. This correlation increases in the absence of kinetochore oscillations or stable end-on attachments. This suggests that periodic movements of bioriented chromosomes limit the correlated motion of nonsisters. Computer simulations show that these correlated movements can occur when elastic crosslinks are placed between the K-fibers of oscillating kinetochores. Strikingly, inhibition of the microtubule crosslinking motor kinesin-5 Eg5 leads to an increase in nonsister correlation and impairs periodic oscillations. These phenotypes are partially rescued by codepletion of the kinesin-12 Kif15, demonstrating a function for kinesin-5 and kinesin-12 motors in driving chromosome movements, possibly as part of a crosslinking structure that correlates the movements of nonsister kinetochores.

Abstract: Summary
Transport of RNAs to dendrites occurs in neuronal RNA granules, which allows local synthesis of specific proteins at active synapses on demand, thereby contributing to learning and memory. To gain insight into the machinery controlling dendritic mRNA localization and translation, we established a stringent protocol to biochemically purify RNA granules from rat brain. Here, we identified a specific set of interactors for two RNA-binding proteins that are known components of neuronal RNA granules, Barentsz and Staufen2. First, neuronal RNA granules are much more heterogeneous than previously anticipated, sharing only a third of the identified proteins. Second, dendritically localized mRNAs, e.g., Arc and CaMKIIα, associate selectively with distinct RNA granules. Third, our work identifies a series of factors with known roles in RNA localization, translational control, and RNA quality control that are likely to keep localized transcripts in a translationally repressed state, often in distinct types of RNPs.

Abstract: Summary
Elucidating the global function of a transcription factor implies the identification of its target genes and genomic binding sites. The role of chromatin in this context is unclear, but the dominant view is that factors bind preferentially to nucleosome-depleted regions identified as DNaseI-hypersensitive sites (DHS). Here we show by ChIP, MNase, and DNaseI assays followed by deep sequencing that the progesterone receptor (PR) requires nucleosomes for optimal binding and function. In breast cancer cells treated with progestins, we identified 25,000 PR binding sites (PRbs). The majority of these sites encompassed several copies of the hexanucleotide TGTYCY, which is highly abundant in the genome. We found that functional PRbs accumulate around progesterone-induced genes, mainly in enhancers. Most of these sites overlap with DHS but exhibit high nucleosome occupancy. Progestin stimulation results in remodeling of these nucleosomes with displacement of histones H1 and H2A/H2B dimers. Our results strongly suggest that nucleosomes are crucial for PR binding and hormonal gene regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Comprehensive transcriptional profiling of glucose-sensing neurons is challenging because of low expression levels of glucokinase (Gck) and other key proteins that transduce a glucose signal. To overcome this, we generated and validated transgenic mice with a neuronal/endocrine-specific Gck promoter driving cre expression and mated them to mice with cre-dependent expression of an EGFP-tagged ribosomal protein construct (EEF1A1−LSL.EGFPL10) that can be used to map and profile cells. We found significant Gck expression in hypothalamic and limbic regions in cells that are activated following administration of glucose or 2-deoxyglucose. Transcriptional profiling from Gck-cre/EEF1A1−LSL.EGFPL10 mice enriched known and previously unknown glucose-sensing populations including neurons expressing growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH). Electrophysiological recordings show that hypoglycemia activates GHRH neurons, suggesting a mechanistic link between hypoglycemia and growth hormone release. These studies provide a means for mapping glucose-sensitive neurons and for generating transcriptional profiles from other cell types expressing cre in a cell-specific manner.

Abstract: Summary
The bone marrow (BM) microenvironment is composed of multiple niche cells that, by producing paracrine factors, maintain and regenerate the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) pool (Morrison and Spradling, 2008). We have previously demonstrated that endothelial cells support the proper regeneration of the hematopoietic system following myeloablation (Butler et al., 2010, Hooper et al., 2009, Kobayashi et al., 2010). Here, we demonstrate that expression of the angiocrine factor Jagged-1, supplied by the BM vascular niche, regulates homeostatic and regenerative hematopoiesis through a Notch-dependent mechanism. Conditional deletion of Jagged-1 in endothelial cells (Jag1(ECKO) mice) results in a profound decrease in hematopoiesis and premature exhaustion of the adult HSC pool, whereas quantification and functional assays demonstrate that loss of Jagged-1 does not perturb vascular or mesenchymal compartments. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the instructive function of endothelial-specific Jagged-1 is required to support the self-renewal and regenerative capacity of HSCs in the adult BM vascular niche.

Aging Yeast Cells Undergo a Sharp Entry into Senescence Unrelated to the Loss of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential,

Abstract: Summary
In budding yeast, a mother cell can produce a finite number of daughter cells before it stops dividing and dies. Such entry into senescence is thought to result from a progressive decline in physiological function, including a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ). Here, we developed a microfluidic device to monitor the dynamics of cell division and ΔΨ in real time at single-cell resolution. We show that cells do not enter senescence gradually but rather undergo an abrupt transition to a slowly dividing state. Moreover, we demonstrate that the decline in ΔΨ, which is observed only in a fraction of cells, is not responsible for entry into senescence. Rather, the loss of ΔΨ is an age-independent and heritable process that leads to clonal senescence and is therefore incompatible with daughter cell rejuvenation. These results emphasize the importance of quantitative single-cell measurements to decipher the causes of cellular aging.

Abstract: Summary
Holliday junctions (HJs), the DNA intermediates of homologous recombination, need to be faithfully processed in order to preserve genome integrity. In human cells, the BLM helicase complex promotes nonnucleolytic dissolution of double HJs. In vitro, HJs may be nucleolytically processed by MUS81-EME1, GEN1, and SLX4-SLX1. Here, we exploit human SLX4-null cells to examine the requirements for HJ resolution in vivo. Lack of BLM and SLX4 or GEN1 and SLX4 is synthetically lethal in the absence of exogenous DNA damage, and lethality is a consequence of dysfunctional mitosis proceeding in the presence of unprocessed HJs. Thus, GEN1 activity cannot be substituted for the SLX4-associated nucleases, and one of the HJ resolvase activities, either of those associated with SLX4 or with GEN1, is required for cell viability, even in the presence of BLM. In vivo HJ resolution depends on both SLX4-associated MUS81-EME1 and SLX1, suggesting that they are acting in concert in the context of SLX4.

Abstract: Summary
Hepcidin, the iron-regulatory hormone and acute phase reactant, is proposed to contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis by promoting iron accumulation in plaque macrophages, leading to increased oxidative stress and inflammation in the plaque (the “iron hypothesis”). Hepcidin and iron may thus represent modifiable risk factors in atherosclerosis. We measured hepcidin expression in Apoe−/− mice with varying diets and ages. To assess the role of macrophage iron in atherosclerosis, we generated Apoe−/− mice with macrophage-specific iron accumulation by introducing the ferroportin ffe mutation. Macrophage iron loading was also enhanced by intravenous iron injection. Contrary to the iron hypothesis, we found that hepatic hepcidin expression was not increased at any stage of the atherosclerosis progression in Apoe−/− or Apoe/ffe mice and that the atherosclerotic plaque size was not increased in mice with elevated macrophage iron. Our results strongly argue against any significant role of macrophage iron in atherosclerosis progression in mice.

Abstract: Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a well-known growth factor that induces cancer cell migration and invasion. Previous studies have shown that SMAD ubiquitination regulatory factor 1 (SMURF1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, regulates cell motility by inducing RhoA degradation. Therefore, we examined the role of SMURF1 in EGF-induced cell migration and invasion using MDA-MB-231 cells, a human breast cancer cell line. EGF increased SMURF1 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. All ErbB family members were expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells and receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors specific for the EGF receptor (EGFR) or ErbB2 blocked the EGF-mediated induction of SMURF1 expression. Within the signaling pathways examined, ERK1/2 and protein kinase C activity were required for EGF-induced SMURF1 expression. The overexpression of constitutively active MEK1 increased the SMURF1 to levels similar to those induced by EGF. SMURF1 induction by EGF treatment or by the overexpression of MEK1 or SMURF1 resulted in enhanced cell migration and invasion, whereas SMURF1 knockdown suppressed EGF- or MEK1-induced cell migration and invasion. EGF treatment or SMURF1 overexpression decreased the endogenous RhoA protein levels. The overexpression of constitutively active RhoA prevented EGF- or SMURF1-induced cell migration and invasion. These results suggest that EGF- induced SMURF1 plays a role in breast cancer cell migration and invasion through the downregulation of RhoA.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are produced by a small cohort of hemogenic endothelial cells (ECs) during development through the formation of intra-aortic hematopoietic cell (HC) clusters. The Runx1 transcription factor plays a key role in the EC-to-HC and -HSC transition. We show that Runx1 expression in hemogenic ECs and the subsequent initiation of HC formation are tightly controlled by the subaortic mesenchyme, although the mesenchyme is not a source of HCs. Runx1 and Notch signaling are involved in this process, with Notch signaling decreasing with time in HCs. Inhibiting Notch signaling readily increases HC production in mouse and chicken embryos. In the mouse, however, this increase is transient. Collectively, we show complementary roles of hemogenic ECs and mesenchymal compartments in triggering aortic hematopoiesis. The subaortic mesenchyme induces Runx1 expression in hemogenic-primed ECs and collaborates with Notch dynamics to control aortic hematopoiesis.

Abstract: Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) mediates neuronal cell death in a variety of pathological conditions involving severe DNA damage. Poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymer is a product synthesized by PARP-1. Previous studies suggest that PAR polymer heralds mitochondrial apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) release and thereby, signals neuronal cell death. However, the details of the effects of PAR polymer on mitochondria remain to be elucidated. Here we report the effects of PAR polymer on mitochondria in cells in situ and isolated brain mitochondria in vitro. We found that PAR polymer causes depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential and opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore early after injury. Furthermore, PAR polymer specifically induces AIF release, but not cytochrome c from isolated brain mitochondria. These data suggest PAR polymer as an endogenous mitochondrial toxin and will further our understanding of the PARP-1-dependent neuronal cell death paradigm.

Abstract: Podura aquatica is a springtail of uncertain systematic position. Our study dealing with the ultrastructure of the spermatogenesis and oogenesis of this species is a contribution to a better knowledge of both the reproduction and the systematics of the taxon. In the male, the spermatogenesis proceeds in a similar way to that of other Collembola. Primary spermatocytes do not show synaptonemal complexes which, instead, are found in primary oocytes. Thus a genomic recombination seems to be present only in females, as it occurs in other springtails. Degeneration of secondary spermatocytes, as reported in some families of the Symphypleona, was not observed in P. aquatica. At the end of spermiogenesis, a rolled up sperm cell provided with an anterior long appendage adhering to the acrosome is produced. In the female, the oogenesis also proceeds in a conventional way with the production of eggs rich in yolk. A branched spermatheca is present at the end of the common oviduct, close to the genital opening. It contains many sperm in its lumen. Contrary to the globular appearance of sperm cells in the male genital ducts, in the spermatheca they are straight, elongated, and lack the long anterior appendage. P. aquatica shows a spermatogenesis, sperm structure, and oogenesis similar to those of other Collembola. In agreement with the results of recent phylogenetic studies, we confirm that P. aquatica is a member of Poduridae, and it does not belong to a group close to the Symphypleona.

Abstract: Cell therapy using adult stem cells has emerged as a potentially new approach for the treatment of various diseases. Therefore, it is an essential procedure to maintain the stemness of adult stem cells for clinical treatment. We previously reported that human dermal stem/progenitor cells (hDSPCs) can be enriched using collagen type IV. However, hDSPCs gradually lose their stem cell properties as in vitro passages continue. In the present study, we developed optimized in vitro culture condition to improve the stemness of these hDSPCs. To evaluate whether the stemness of hDSPCs is well sustained in various culture conditions, we measured the expression levels of SOX2, NANOG, and S100B, which are well-known representative dermal progenitor markers. We observed that hDSPCs grown in three-dimensional (3D) culture condition had higher expression levels of those markers compared with hDSPCs grown in two-dimensional (2D) culture condition. Under the 3D culture condition, we further demonstrated that a high glucose (4.5 g/L) concentration enhanced the expression levels of the dermal progenitor markers, whereas O2 concentration did not affect. We also found that skin-derived precursor (SKP) culture medium was the most effective, among various culture media, in increasing the dermal progenitor marker expression. We finally demonstrated that this optimized culture condition enhanced the expression level of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), the proliferation, and the multipotency of hDSPCs, an important characteristic of stem cells. Taken together, these results suggested that this novel in vitroculture condition improves the stemness of hDSPCs.

Abstract: Summary
SHOC2 is mutated in Noonan syndrome and plays a key role in the activation of the ERK-MAPK pathway, which is upregulated in the majority of human cancers. SHOC2 functions as a PP1-regulatory protein and as an effector of MRAS. Here we show that SHOC2 and MRAS form a complex with SCRIB, a polarity protein with tumor suppressor properties. SCRIB functions as a PP1-regulatory protein and antagonizes SHOC2-mediated RAF dephosphorylation through a mechanism involving competition for PP1 molecules within the same macromolecular complex. SHOC2 function is selectively required for the malignant properties of tumor cells with mutant RAS, and both MRAS and SHOC2 play a key role in polarized migration. We propose that MRAS, through its ability to recruit a complex with paradoxical components, coordinates ERK pathway spatiotemporal dynamics with polarity and that this complex plays a key role during tumorigenic growth.

Abstract: Summary
Apoptosis is a highly regulated form of cell death that controls normal homeostasis as well as the antitumor activity of many chemotherapeutic agents. Commitment to death via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway requires activation of the mitochondrial pore-forming proteins BAK or BAX. Activation can be effected by the activator BH3-only proteins BID or BIM, which have been considered to be functionally redundant in this role. Herein, we show that significant activation preferences exist between these proteins: BID preferentially activates BAK while BIM preferentially activates BAX. Furthermore, we find that cells lacking BAK are relatively resistant to agents that require BID activation for maximal induction of apoptosis, including topoisomerase inhibitors and TRAIL. Consequently, patients with tumors that harbor a loss of BAK1 exhibit an inferior response to topoisomerase inhibitor treatment in the clinic. Therefore, BID and BIM have nonoverlapping roles in the induction of apoptosis via BAK and BAX, affecting chemotherapy response.

Abstract: Disturbances in proteostasis are observed in many neurodegenerative diseases. This leads to activation of protein quality control to restore proteostasis, with a key role for the removal of aberrant proteins by proteolysis. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a protein quality control mechanism of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that is activated in several neurodegenerative diseases. Recently we showed that the major proteolytic pathway during UPR activation is via the autophagy/lysosomal system. Here we investigate UPR induction if the other major proteolytic pathway of the ER -ER associated degradation (ERAD)- is inhibited. Surprisingly, impairment of ERAD results in decreased UPR activation and protects against ER stress toxicity. Autophagy induction is not affected under these conditions, however, a striking relocalization of the lysosomes is observed. Our data suggest that a protective UPR-modulating mechanism is activated if ERAD is inhibited, which involves lysosomes. Our data provide insight in the cross-talk between proteolytic pathways involved in ER proteostasis. This has implications for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease where disturbed ER proteostasis and proteolytic impairment are early phenomena in the pathology.

Abstract: Summary
During animal cell cytokinesis, the spindle directs contractile ring assembly by activating RhoA in a narrow equatorial zone. Rapid GTPase activating protein (GAP)-mediated inactivation (RhoA flux) is proposed to limit RhoA zone dimensions. Testing the significance of RhoA flux has been hampered by the fact that the GAP targeting RhoA is not known. Here, we identify M phase GAP (MP-GAP) as the primary GAP targeting RhoA during mitosis and cytokinesis. MP-GAP inhibition caused excessive RhoA activation in M phase, leading to the uncontrolled formation of large cortical protrusions and late cytokinesis failure. RhoA zone width was broadened by attenuation of the centrosomal asters but was not affected by MP-GAP inhibition alone. Simultaneous aster attenuation and MP-GAP inhibition led to RhoA accumulation around the entire cell periphery. These results identify the major GAP restraining RhoA during cell division and delineate the relative contributions of RhoA flux and centrosomal asters in controlling RhoA zone dimensions.

Abstract: Summary
A hallmark of obesity is selective suppression of hepatic insulin signaling (“insulin resistance”), but critical gaps remain in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms. We now report a major role for hepatic CaMKII, a calcium-responsive kinase that is activated in obesity. Genetic targeting of hepatic CaMKII, its downstream mediator p38, or the p38 substrate and stabilizer MK2 enhances insulin-induced p-Akt in palmitate-treated hepatocytes and obese mouse liver, leading to metabolic improvement. The mechanism of improvement begins with induction of ATF6 and the ATF6 target p58IPK, a chaperone that suppresses the PERK—p-eIF2α—ATF4 branch of the UPR. The result is a decrease in the ATF4 target TRB3, an inhibitor of insulin-induced p-Akt, leading to enhanced activation of Akt and its downstream metabolic mediators. These findings increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms linking obesity to selective insulin resistance and suggest new therapeutic targets for type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.

Abstract: The activation of the developmental program in mammalian eggs relies on the initiation at the time of fertilization of repeated rises in the intracellular concentration of free calcium ([Ca2+]i), also known as [Ca2+]i oscillations. The ability to mount the full complement of oscillations is only achieved at the end of oocyte maturation, at the metaphase stage of meiosis II (MII). Over the last decades research has focused on addressing the mechanisms by which the sperm initiates the oscillations and identification of the channels that mediate intracellular Ca2+ release. This review will describe the up-to-date knowledge of other aspects of Ca2+ homeostasis in mouse oocytes, such as the mechanisms that transport Ca2+ out of the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the Ca2+ store of the oocyte/egg, into other organelles and also those that extrude Ca2+. Evidence pointing to channels in the plasma membrane that mediate Ca2+ entry from the extracellular milieu, which is required for the persistence of the oscillations, is also discussed, along with the modifications that these mechanisms undergo during maturation. Lastly, we highlight areas where additional research is needed to obtain a better understating of the molecules and mechanisms that regulate Ca2+ homeostasis in this unique Ca2+ signaling system.

Abstract: Summary
Protein conformation dictates a great deal of protein function. A class of naturally unstructured proteins, termed intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), demonstrates that flexibility in structure can be as important mechanistically as rigid structure. At the core of the circadian transcription/translation feedback loop in Neurospora crassa is the protein FREQUENCY (FRQ), shown here shown to share many characteristics of IDPs. FRQ in turn binds to FREQUENCY-Interacting RNA Helicase (FRH), whose clock function has been assumed to relate to its predicted helicase function. However, mutational analyses reveal that the helicase function of FRH is not essential for the clock, and a region of FRH distinct from the helicase region is essential for stabilizing FRQ against rapid degradation via a pathway distinct from its typical ubiquitin-mediated turnover. These data lead to the hypothesis that FRQ is an IDP and that FRH acts nonenzymatically, stabilizing FRQ to enable proper clock circuitry/function.

Abstract: Summary
RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcribes hundreds of kilobases of DNA, limiting the production of mRNAs and lncRNAs. We used global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq) to measure the rates of transcription by Pol II following gene activation. Elongation rates vary as much as 4-fold at different genomic loci and in response to two distinct cellular signaling pathways (i.e., 17β-estradiol [E2] and TNF-α). The rates are slowest near the promoter and increase during the first ∼15 kb transcribed. Gene body elongation rates correlate with Pol II density, resulting in systematically higher rates of transcript production at genes with higher Pol II density. Pol II dynamics following short inductions indicate that E2 stimulates gene expression by increasing Pol II initiation, whereas TNF-α reduces Pol II residence time at pause sites. Collectively, our results identify previously uncharacterized variation in the rate of transcription and highlight elongation as an important, variable, and regulated rate-limiting step during transcription.

Abstract: Summary
The deterioration of the inner blood-retinal barrier and consequent macular edema is a cardinal manifestation of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and the clinical feature most closely associated with loss of sight. We provide evidence from both human and animal studies for the critical role of the classical neuronal guidance cue, semaphorin 3A, in instigating pathological vascular permeability in diabetic retinas via its cognate receptor neuropilin-1. We reveal that semaphorin 3A is induced in early hyperglycemic phases of diabetes within the neuronal retina and precipitates initial breakdown of endothelial barrier function. We demonstrate, by a series of orthogonal approaches, that neutralization of semaphorin 3A efficiently prevents diabetes-induced retinal vascular leakage in a stage of the disease when vascular endothelial growth factor neutralization is inefficient. These observations were corroborated in TgCre-Esr1/Nrp1flox/flox conditional knockout mice. Our findings identify a therapeutic target for macular edema and provide further evidence for neurovascular crosstalk in the pathogenesis of DR.

Abstract: Summary
LSD1 is a critical chromatin modulator that controls cellular pluripotency and differentiation through the demethylation of H3K4me1/2. Overexpression of LSD1 has been observed in many types of tumors and is correlated with its oncogenic effects in tumorigenesis. However, the mechanism leading to LSD1 upregulation in tumors remains unclear. Using an unbiased siRNA screening against all the human deubiquitinases, we identified USP28 as a bona fide deubiquitinase of LSD1. USP28 interacted with and stabilized LSD1 via deubiquitination. USP28 overexpression correlated with LSD1 upregulation in multiple cancer cell lines and breast tumor samples. Knockdown of USP28 resulted in LSD1 destabilization, leading to the suppression of cancer stem cell (CSC)-like characteristics in vitro and inhibition of tumorigenicity in vivo, which can be rescued by ectopic LSD1 expression. Our study reveals a critical mechanism underlying the epigenetic regulation by USP28 and provides another treatment approach against breast cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Frequent discrepancies between preclinical and clinical results of anticancer agents demand a reliable translational platform that can precisely recapitulate the biology of human cancers. Another critical unmet need is the ability to predict therapeutic responses for individual patients. Toward this goal, we have established a library of orthotopic glioblastoma (GBM) xenograft models using surgical samples of GBM patients. These patient-specific GBM xenograft tumors recapitulate histopathological properties and maintain genomic characteristics of parental GBMs in situ. Furthermore, in vivo irradiation, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy of these xenograft tumors mimic the treatment response of parental GBMs. We also found that establishment of orthotopic xenograft models portends poor prognosis of GBM patients and identified the gene signatures and pathways signatures associated with the clinical aggressiveness of GBMs. Together, the patient-specific orthotopic GBM xenograft library represent the preclinically and clinically valuable “patient tumor’s phenocopy” that represents molecular and functional heterogeneity of GBMs.

Abstract: Summary
The specification of neuronal subtypes in the cerebral cortex proceeds in a temporal manner; however, the regulation of the transitions between the sequentially generated subtypes is poorly understood. Here, we report that the forkhead box transcription factor Foxg1 coordinates the production of neocortical projection neurons through the global repression of a default gene program. The delayed activation of Foxg1 was necessary and sufficient to induce deep-layer neurogenesis, followed by a sequential wave of upper-layer neurogenesis. A genome-wide analysis revealed that Foxg1 binds to mammalian-specific noncoding sequences to repress over 12 transcription factors expressed in early progenitors, including Ebf2/3, Dmrt3, Dmrta1, and Eya2. These findings reveal an unexpected prolonged competence of progenitors to initiate corticogenesis at a progressed stage during development and identify Foxg1 as a critical initiator of neocorticogenesis through spatiotemporal repression, a system that balances the production of nonradially and radially migrating glutamatergic subtypes during mammalian cortical expansion.

Abstract: Summary
The bis-benzylidine piperidone RA190 covalently binds to cysteine 88 of ubiquitin receptor RPN13 in the 19S regulatory particle and inhibits proteasome function, triggering rapid accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins. Multiple myeloma (MM) lines, even those resistant to bortezomib, were sensitive to RA190 via endoplasmic reticulum stress-related apoptosis. RA190 stabilized targets of human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 oncoprotein, and preferentially killed HPV-transformed cells. After oral or intraperitoneal dosing of mice, RA190 distributed to plasma and major organs except the brain and inhibited proteasome function in skin and muscle. RA190 administration profoundly reduced growth of MM and ovarian cancer xenografts, and oral RA190 treatment retarded HPV16+ syngeneic mouse tumor growth, without affecting spontaneous HPV-specific CD8+ T cell responses, suggesting its therapeutic potential.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription factors and DNA regulatory binding motifs are fundamental components of the gene regulatory network. Here, by using genome-wide binding profiling, we show extensive occupancy of transcription factors of myogenesis (MyoD and Myogenin) at extragenic enhancer regions coinciding with RNA synthesis (i.e., eRNA). In particular, multiple regions were transcribed to eRNA within the regulatory region of MYOD1, including previously characterized distal regulatory regions (DRR) and core enhancer (CE). While CERNA enhanced RNA polymerase II (Pol II) occupancy and transcription at MYOD1, DRRRNA acted to activate the downstream myogenic genes. The deployment of transcriptional machinery to appropriate loci is contingent on chromatin accessibility, a rate-limiting step preceding Pol II assembly. By nuclease sensitivity assay, we found that eRNAs regulate genomic access of the transcriptional complex to defined regulatory regions. In conclusion, our data suggest that eRNAs contribute to establishing a cell-type-specific transcriptional circuitry by directing chromatin-remodeling events.

Abstract: Summary
Proteasome inhibitor (PI) resistance mechanisms in multiple myeloma (MM) remain controversial. We report the existence of a progenitor organization in primary MM that recapitulates maturation stages between B cells and plasma cells and that contributes to clinical PI resistance. Xbp1s− tumor B cells and pre-plasmablasts survive therapeutic PI, preventing cure, while maturation arrest of MM before the plasmablast stage enables progressive disease on PI treatment. Mechanistically, suppression of Xbp1s in MM is shown to induce bortezomib resistance via de-commitment to plasma cell maturation and immunoglobulin production, diminishing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) front-loading and cytotoxic susceptibility to PI-induced inhibition of ER-associated degradation. These results reveal the tumor progenitor structure in MM and highlight its role in therapeutic failure.

Abstract: Summary
Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) is a potent antiproliferative factor in multiple types of cells. Deregulation of TGF-β signaling is associated with the development of many cancers, including leukemia, though the molecular mechanisms are largely unclear. Here, we show that Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (c-Cbl), a known proto-oncogene encoding an ubiquitin E3 ligase, promotes TGF-β signaling by neddylating and stabilizing the type II receptor (TβRII). Knockout of c-Cbl decreases the TβRII protein level and desensitizes hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells to TGF-β stimulation, while c-Cbl overexpression stabilizes TβRII and sensitizes leukemia cells to TGF-β. c-Cbl conjugates neural precursor cell-expressed, developmentally downregulated 8 (NEDD8), a ubiquitin-like protein, to TβRII at Lys556 and Lys567. Neddylation of TβRII promotes its endocytosis to EEA1-positive early endosomes while preventing its endocytosis to caveolin-positive compartments, therefore inhibiting TβRII ubiquitination and degradation. We have also identified a neddylation-activity-defective c-Cbl mutation from leukemia patients, implying a link between aberrant TβRII neddylation and leukemia development.

Abstract: Summary
Human TopBP1 is a key mediator protein involved in DNA replication checkpoint control. In this study, we report a specific interaction between TopBP1 and Bloom syndrome helicase (BLM) that is phosphorylation and cell-cycle dependent. Interestingly, TopBP1 depletion led to decreased BLM protein level and increased sister chromatid exchange (SCE). Moreover, our data indicated that BLM was ubiquitinated by E3 ligase MIB1 and degraded in G1 cells but was stabilized by TopBP1 in S phase cells. Depletion of MIB1 restored BLM protein level and rescued the elevated SCE phenotype in TopBP1-depleted cells. In addition, cells expressing an undegradable BLM mutant showed radiation sensitivity, probably by triggering end resection and inhibiting the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway in G1 phase. Altogether, these data suggest that, although BLM is downregulated in G1 phase in order to promote NHEJ-mediated DNA repair, it is stabilized by TopBP1 in S phase cells in order to suppress SCE and thereby prevent genomic instability.

Abstract: Summary
RBM5, a regulator of alternative splicing of apoptotic genes, and its highly homologous RBM6 and RBM10 are RNA-binding proteins frequently deleted or mutated in lung cancer. We report that RBM5/6 and RBM10 antagonistically regulate the proliferative capacity of cancer cells and display distinct positional effects in alternative splicing regulation. We identify the Notch pathway regulator NUMB as a key target of these factors in the control of cell proliferation. NUMB alternative splicing, which is frequently altered in lung cancer, can regulate colony and xenograft tumor formation, and its modulation recapitulates or antagonizes the effects of RBM5, 6, and 10 in cell colony formation. RBM10 mutations identified in lung cancer cells disrupt NUMB splicing regulation to promote cell growth. Our results reveal a key genetic circuit in the control of cancer cell proliferation.

Abstract: Summary
Postzygotic reproductive isolation in response to interploidy hybridizations is a well-known phenomenon in plants that forms a major path for sympatric speciation. A main determinant for the failure of interploidy hybridizations is the endosperm, a nutritious tissue supporting embryo growth, similar to the functional role of the placenta in mammals. Although it has been suggested that deregulated imprinted genes underpin dosage sensitivity of the endosperm, the molecular basis for this phenomenon remained unknown. In a genetic screen for suppressors of triploid seed abortion, we have identified the paternally expressed imprinted gene ADMETOS (ADM). Here, we present evidence that increased dosage of ADM causes triploid seed arrest. A large body of theoretical work predicted that deregulated imprinted genes establish the barrier to interploidy hybridization. Our study thus provides evidence strongly supporting this hypothesis and generates the molecular basis for our understanding of postzygotic hybridization barriers in plants.

Abstract: Summary
Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is a cell-surface protein highly expressed in embryonic tissues and in malignant carcinomas. We report that EpCAM acts as a potent inhibitor of novel protein kinase C (nPKC) in both embryos and cancer cells. We observed dramatic effects of loss of EpCAM on amphibian embryonic tissues, which include sequentially strong overstimulation of PKC activity and of the Erk pathway, leading to exacerbated myosin contractility, loss of cadherin-mediated adhesion, tissue dissociation, and, ultimately, cell death. We show that PKC inhibition is caused by a short segment of the EpCAM cytoplasmic tail. This motif resembles the pseudosubstrate inhibitory domains of PKCs and binds nPKCs with high affinity. A bioinformatics search reveals the existence of similar motifs in other plasma membrane proteins, most of which are cell-cell adhesion molecules. Thus, direct inhibition of PKC by EpCAM represents a general mode of regulation of signal transduction by cell-surface proteins.

Abstract: Summary
The transcription factors Abrupt (Ab) and Knot (Kn) act as selectors of distinct dendritic arbor morphologies in two classes of Drosophila sensory neurons, termed class I and class IV, respectively. We performed binding-site mapping and transcriptional profiling of these isolated neurons. Their profiles were similarly enriched in cell-type-specific enhancers of genes implicated in neural development. We identified a total of 429 target genes, of which 56 were common to Ab and Kn; these targets included genes necessary to shape dendritic arbors in either or both of the two sensory subtypes. Furthermore, a common target gene, encoding the cell adhesion molecule Ten-m, was expressed more strongly in class I than class IV, and this differential was critical to the class-selective directional control of dendritic branch sprouting or extension. Our analyses illustrate how differentiating neurons employ distinct and shared repertoires of gene expression to produce class-selective morphological traits.

Abstract: Summary
Ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) is a major mTOR downstream signaling molecule that regulates cell size and translation efficiency. Here, we report that short isoforms of S6K1 are overproduced in breast cancer cell lines and tumors. Overexpression of S6K1 short isoforms induces transformation of human breast epithelial cells. The long S6K1 variant (Iso-1) induced opposite effects. It inhibits Ras-induced transformation and tumor formation, while its knockdown or knockout induces transformation, suggesting that Iso-1 has a tumor-suppressor activity. Furthermore, we found that S6K1 short isoforms bind and activate mTORC1, elevating 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, cap-dependent translation, and Mcl-1 protein levels. Both a phosphorylation-defective 4E-BP1 mutant and the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin partially blocked the oncogenic effects of S6K1 short isoforms, suggesting that these are mediated by mTORC1 and 4E-BP1. Thus, alternative splicing of S6K1 acts as a molecular switch in breast cancer cells, elevating oncogenic isoforms that activate mTORC1.

Abstract: Summary
The ubiquitin-modification status of proteins in cells is highly dynamic and maintained by specific ligation machineries (E3 ligases) that tag proteins with ubiquitin or by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) that remove the ubiquitin tag. The development of tools that offset this balance is critical in characterizing signaling pathways that utilize such ubiquitination switches. Herein, we generated a DUB-resistant ubiquitin mutant that is recalcitrant to cleavage by various families of DUBs both in vitro and in mammalian cells. As a proof-of-principle experiment, ectopic expression of the uncleavable ubiquitin stabilized monoubiquitinated PCNA in the absence of DNA damage and also revealed a defect in the clearance of the DNA damage response at unprotected telomeres. Importantly, a proteomic survey using the uncleavable ubiquitin identified ubiquitinated substrates, validating the DUB-resistant ubiquitin expression system as a valuable tool for interrogating cell signaling pathways.

Abstract: Summary
EGFRvIII, a frequently occurring mutation in primary glioblastoma, results in a protein product that cannot bind ligand, but signals constitutively. Deducing how EGFRvIII causes transformation has been difficult because of autocrine and paracrine loops triggered by EGFRvIII alone or in heterodimers with wild-type EGFR. Here, we document coexpression of EGFR and EGFRvIII in primary human glioblastoma that drives transformation and tumorigenesis in a cell-intrinsic manner. We demonstrate enhancement of downstream STAT signaling triggered by EGFR-catalyzed phosphorylation of EGFRvIII, implicating EGFRvIII as a substrate for EGFR. Subsequent phosphorylation of STAT3 requires nuclear entry of EGFRvIII and formation of an EGFRvIII-STAT3 nuclear complex. Our findings clarify specific oncogenic signaling relationships between EGFR and EGFRvIII in glioblastoma.

Abstract: Vascular smooth muscle cells undergo phenotypic switches after damage which may contribute to proliferative disorders of the vessel wall. This process has been related to remodeling of Ca2+ channels. We have tested the ability of cultured human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (hCASMCs) to return from a proliferative to a quiescent behavior and the contribution of intracellular Ca2+ remodeling to the process. We found that cultured, early passage hCASMCs showed a high proliferation rate, sustained increases in cytosolic [Ca2+] in response to angiotensin II, residual voltage-operated Ca2+ entry, increased Stim1 and enhanced store-operated currents. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs inhibited store-operated Ca2+ entry and abolished cell proliferation in a mitochondria-dependent manner. After a few passages, hCASMCs turned to a quiescent phenotype characterized by lack of proliferation, oscillatory Ca2+ response to angiotensin II, increased Ca2+ store content, enhanced voltage-operated Ca2+ entry and Cav1.2 expression, and decreases in Stim1, store-operated current and store-operated Ca2+ entry. We conclude that proliferating hCASMCs return to quiescence and this switch is associated to a remodeling of Ca2+ channels and their control by subcellular organelles, thus providing a window of opportunity for targeting phenotype-specific Ca2+ channels involved in proliferation.

Abstract: Summary
RNAi is a conserved mechanism in which small RNAs induce silencing of complementary targets. We have previously identified priRNAs, a class of Dicer-independent small RNAs in fission yeast. The mechanism by which Dicer-independent small RNAs are generated is not well understood in any species. Here we reconstitute the final steps of priRNA and siRNA biogenesis in vitro. We identify the 3′-5′ exonuclease Triman and demonstrate that Argonaute, loaded with longer RNA precursors, recruits Triman to generate mature priRNAs and siRNAs. We show that priRNA and siRNA trimming is required for de novo assembly of heterochromatin at centromeric repeats and the mat locus and for maintenance of heterochromatin at developmental genes. Furthermore, in rrp6Δ cells RNAi targets diverse genes in a Triman-dependent way, indicating that the exosome protects the genome from spurious RNAi. Our results suggest that Argonaute association with RNA degradation products generates priRNAs and triggers RNAi in a process of transcriptome surveillance.

Abstract: Summary
The rate at which genomes diverge during speciation is unknown, as are the physical dynamics of the process. Here, we compare full genome sequences of 32 butterflies, representing five species from a hybridizing Heliconius butterfly community, to examine genome-wide patterns of introgression and infer how divergence evolves during the speciation process. Our analyses reveal that initial divergence is restricted to a small fraction of the genome, largely clustered around known wing-patterning genes. Over time, divergence evolves rapidly, due primarily to the origin of new divergent regions. Furthermore, divergent genomic regions display signatures of both selection and adaptive introgression, demonstrating the link between microevolutionary processes acting within species and the origin of species across macroevolutionary timescales. Our results provide a uniquely comprehensive portrait of the evolving species boundary due to the role that hybridization plays in reducing the background accumulation of divergence at neutral sites.

Abstract: Summary
Immortal spheroids were generated from fetal mouse intestine using the culture system initially developed to culture organoids from adult intestinal epithelium. Spheroid proportion progressively decreases from fetal to postnatal period, with a corresponding increase in production of organoids. Like organoids, spheroids show Wnt-dependent indefinite self-renewing properties but display a poorly differentiated phenotype reminiscent of incompletely caudalized progenitors. The spheroid transcriptome is strikingly different from that of adult intestinal stem cells, with minimal overlap of Wnt target gene expression. The receptor LGR4, but not LGR5, is essential for their growth. Trop2/Tacstd2 and Cnx43/Gja1, two markers highly enriched in spheroids, are expressed throughout the embryonic-day-14 intestinal epithelium. Comparison of in utero and neonatal lineage tracing using Cnx43-CreER and Lgr5-CreERT2 mice identified spheroid-generating cells as developmental progenitors involved in generation of the prenatal intestinal epithelium. Ex vivo, spheroid cells have the potential to differentiate into organoids, qualifying as a fetal type of intestinal stem cell.

Abstract: Summary
Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors regulate diverse cellular processes, affecting tumorigenesis, metabolism, stem cell maintenance, and lifespan. We show that FOXO3 transcription regulation mainly proceeds through the most active subset of enhancers. In addition to the general distinction between “open” and “closed” chromatin, we show that the level of activity marks (H3K27ac, RNAPII, enhancer RNAs) of these open chromatin regions prior to FOXO3 activation largely determines FOXO3 DNA binding. Consequently, FOXO3 amplifies the levels of these activity marks and their absolute rather than relative changes associate best with FOXO3 target gene regulation. The importance of preexisting chromatin state in directing FOXO3 gene regulation, as shown here, provides a mechanism whereby FOXO3 can regulate cell-specific homeostasis. Genetic variation is reported to affect these chromatin signatures in a quantitative manner, and, in agreement, we observe a correlation between cancer-associated genetic variations and the amplitude of FOXO3 enhancer binding.

Abstract: Summary
The expression of many genes is controlled by upstream ORFs (uORFs). Typically, the progression of the ribosome through a regulatory uORF, which depends on the physiological state of the cell, influences the expression of the downstream gene. In the classic mechanism of induction of macrolide resistance genes, antibiotics promote translation arrest within the uORF, and the static ribosome induces a conformational change in mRNA, resulting in the activation of translation of the resistance cistron. We show that ketolide antibiotics, which do not induce ribosome stalling at the uORF of the ermC resistance gene, trigger its expression via a unique mechanism. Ketolides promote frameshifting at the uORF, allowing the translating ribosome to invade the intergenic spacer. The dynamic unfolding of the mRNA structure leads to the activation of resistance. Conceptually similar mechanisms may control other cellular genes. The identified property of ketolides to reduce the fidelity of reading frame maintenance may have medical implications.

Abstract: Summary
X upregulation in mammals increases levels of expressed X-linked transcripts to compensate for autosomal biallelic expression. Here, we present molecular mechanisms that enhance X expression at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Active mouse X-linked promoters are enriched in the initiation form of RNA polymerase II (PolII-S5p) and in specific histone marks, including histone H4 acetylated at lysine 16 (H4K16ac) and histone variant H2AZ. The H4K16 acetyltransferase males absent on the first (MOF), known to mediate the Drosophila X upregulation, is also enriched on the mammalian X. Depletion of MOF or male-specific lethal 1 (MSL1) in mouse ES cells causes a specific decrease in PolII-S5p and in expression of a subset of X-linked genes. Analyses of RNA half-life data sets show increased stability of mammalian X-linked transcripts. Both ancestral X-linked genes, defined as those conserved on chicken autosomes, and newly acquired X-linked genes are upregulated by similar mechanisms but to a different extent, suggesting that subsets of genes are distinctly regulated depending on their evolutionary history.

Abstract: Summary
Polarization of mammalian neurons with a specified axon requires precise regulation of microtubule and actin dynamics in the developing neurites. Here we show that mammalian partition defective 3 (mPar3), a key component of the Par polarity complex that regulates the polarization of many cell types including neurons, directly regulates microtubule stability and organization. The N-terminal portion of mPar3 exhibits strong microtubule binding, bundling, and stabilization activity, which can be suppressed by its C-terminal portion via an intramolecular interaction. Interestingly, the intermolecular oligomerization of mPar3 is able to relieve the intramolecular interaction and thereby promote microtubule bundling and stabilization. Furthermore, disruption of this microtubule regulatory activity of mPar3 impairs its function in axon specification. Together, these results demonstrate a role for mPar3 in directly regulating microtubule organization that is crucial for neuronal polarization.

Abstract: The transcription factor Pax6, which belongs to the paired box-containing gene family, regulates developmental processes, especially in the eyes, central nervous tissues and craniofacial structures. However, the role of Pax6 in bone has never been studied exclusively. Here we report that Pax6 is expressed at both the mRNA and protein level in the calvaria and long bones of adult mice as well as osteo-cyte-like MLOY4 cells and suppresses the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Moreover, the expression levels of Pax6 were much higher in the calvaria than the long bones, and Pax6 was also expressed at E16 to E18 in both the calvaria and long bones. Knockdown of Pax6 in MLOY4 cells did not affect cell proliferation or survival; however, the expression of Sost, an osteocyte marker gene, was significantly decreased. In addition, the overexpression of Pax6 suppressed the canonical Wnt signaling pathway by enhancing the expression of Sost. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that Pax6 binds to the Sost promoter and that stimulation of Sost transcription by Pax6 was dependent on a specific Pax6-binding sequence within the promoter. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that Pax6 is expressed in bone and may play an important role in osteocyte differentiation by controlling canonical Wnt signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the mechanism underlying the regulation of the androgen receptor (AR), a central player in the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), holds promise for overcoming the challenge of treating CRPC. We demonstrate that the ubiquitin ligase Siah2 targets a select pool of NCOR1-bound, transcriptionally-inactive AR for ubiquitin-dependent degradation, thereby promoting expression of select AR target genes implicated in lipid metabolism, cell motility, and proliferation. Siah2 is required for prostate cancer cell growth under androgen-deprivation conditions in vitro and in vivo, and Siah2 inhibition promotes prostate cancer regression upon castration. Notably, Siah2 expression is markedly increased in human CRPCs. Collectively, we find that selective regulation of AR transcriptional activity by the ubiquitin ligase Siah2 is important for CRPC development.

Abstract: Summary
Inactivation of selected neurons in vivo can define their contribution to specific developmental outcomes, circuit functions, and behaviors. Here, we show that the optogenetic tool KillerRed selectively, rapidly, and permanently inactivates different classes of neurons in C. elegans in response to a single light stimulus, through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Ablation scales from individual neurons in single animals to multiple neurons in populations and can be applied to freely behaving animals. Using spatially restricted illumination, we demonstrate that localized KillerRed activation in either the cell body or the axon triggers neuronal degeneration and death of the targeted cell. Finally, targeting KillerRed to mitochondria results in organelle fragmentation without killing the cell, in contrast to the cell death observed when KillerRed is targeted to the plasma membrane. We expect this genetic tool to have wide-ranging applications in studies of circuit function and subcellular responses to ROS.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the importance of the discharge frequency in neuronal communication, little is known about the firing-rate patterns of cortical populations. Using large-scale recordings from multiple layers of the entorhinal-hippocampal loop, we found that the firing rates of principal neurons showed a lognormal-like distribution in all brain states. Mean and peak rates within place fields of hippocampal neurons were also strongly skewed. Importantly, firing rates of the same neurons showed reliable correlations in different brain states and testing situations, as well as across familiar and novel environments. The fraction of neurons that participated in population oscillations displayed a lognormal pattern. Such skewed firing rates of individual neurons may be due to a skewed distribution of synaptic weights, which is supported by our observation of a lognormal distribution of the efficacy of spike transfer from principal neurons to interneurons. The persistent skewed distribution of firing rates implies that a preconfigured, highly active minority dominates information transmission in cortical networks.

Abstract: Summary
The unfolded protein response (UPR) is composed by homeostatic signaling pathways that are activated by excessive protein misfolding in the endoplasmic reticulum. Ire1 signaling is an important mediator of the UPR, leading to the activation of the transcription factor Xbp1. Here, we show that Drosophila Ire1 mutant photoreceptors have defects in the delivery of rhodopsin-1 to the rhabdomere and in the secretion of Spacemaker/Eyes Shut into the interrhabdomeral space. However, these defects are not observed in Xbp1 mutant photoreceptors. Ire1 mutant retinas have higher mRNA levels for targets of regulated Ire1-dependent decay (RIDD), including for the fatty acid transport protein (fatp). Importantly, the downregulation of fatp by RNAi rescues the rhodopsin-1 delivery defects observed in Ire1 mutant photoreceptors. Our results show that the role of Ire1 during photoreceptor differentiation is independent of Xbp1 function and demonstrate the physiological relevance of the RIDD mechanism in this specific paradigm.

Abstract: Summary
Successful memory involves not only remembering information over time, but also keeping memories distinct and less confusable. The computational process for making representations for similar input patterns more distinct from each other has been referred to as “pattern separation.” In this work, we developed a set of behavioral conditions that allowed us to manipulate the load for pattern separation at different stages of memory. Thus, we provide experimental evidence that a brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-dependent pattern separation process occurs during the encoding/storage/consolidation, but not the retrieval stage of memory processing. We also found that a spontaneous increase in BDNF in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus is associated with exposure to landmarks delineating similar, but not dissimilar, spatial locations, suggesting that BDNF is expressed on an “as-needed” basis for pattern separation.

Abstract: Pyruvate kinase, muscle type 2 (PKM2), is a key factor in the aerobic glycolysis of cancer cells. In our experiments, liver cancer cell lines exhibited a range of sensitivity to PKM2 knockdown-mediated growth inhibition. We speculated that this differential sensitivity is attributable to the variable dependency on glycolysis for the growth of different cell lines. Transcriptome data revealed overexpression of a glucose transporter (GLUT3) and a lactate transporter (MCT4) genes in PKM2 knockdown-sensitive cells. PKM2 knockdown-resistant cells expressed high levels of the lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) and glycine decarboxylase (GLDC) genes. Concordant with the gene expression results, PKM2 knockdown-sensitive cells generated high levels of lactate. In addition, ATP production was significantly reduced in the PKM2 knockdown-sensitive cells treated with a glucose analog, indicative of dependency of their cellular energetics on lactate-producing glycolysis. The PKM2 knockdown-resistant cells were further subdivided into less glycolytic and more (glycolysis branch pathway-dependent) glycolytic groups. Our findings collectively support the utility of PKM2 as a therapeutic target for high lactate-producing glycolytic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

Abstract: Summary
FADD, caspase-8, and cFLIP regulate the outcome of cell death signaling. Mice that constitutively lack these molecules die at an early embryonic age, whereas tissue-specific constitutive deletion of FADD or caspase-8 results in inflammatory skin disease caused by increased necroptosis. The function of cFLIP in the skin in vivo is unknown. In contrast to tissue-specific caspase-8 knockout, we show that mice constitutively lacking cFLIP in the epidermis die around embryonic days 10 and 11. When cFLIP expression was abrogated in adult skin of cFLIPfl/fl-K14CreERtam mice, severe inflammation of the skin with concomitant caspase activation and apoptotic, but not necroptotic, cell death developed. Apoptosis was dependent of autocrine tumor necrosis factor production triggered by loss of cFLIP. In addition, epidermal cFLIP protein was lost in patients with severe drug reactions associated with epidermal apoptosis. Our data demonstrate the importance of cFLIP for the integrity of the epidermis and for silencing of spontaneous skin inflammation.

Abstract: ABCG2 is a member of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transmembrane proteins that plays an important role in stem cell biology and drug resistance of cancer cells. In this study, we investigated how expression of human ABCG2 gene is regulated in lung cancer A549 cells. Binding of Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors to the ABCG2 promoter in vitro and in vivo was elucidated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. The ABCG2 promoter activity was impaired when Sp1 sites were mutated but was enhanced by overexpression of Sp1 or Sp3 proteins. Knockdown of Sp1 or Sp3 expression by short interfering RNA significantly decreased the expression of ABCG2 mRNA and protein, resulting in attenuated formation of the side population in A549 cells. In addition, Sp1 inhibition in vivo by mithramycin A suppressed the percentage of the side population fraction and sphere forming activities of A549 cells. Moreover, inhibiting Sp1- or Sp3-dependent ABCG2 expression caused chemosensitization to the anticancer drug cisplatin. Collectively, our results demonstrate that Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors are the primary determinants for activating basal transcription of the ABCG2 gene and play an important role in maintaining the side population phenotype of lung cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
Glial cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is a potent neurotrophic factor that has reached clinical trials for Parkinson’s disease. GDNF binds to its coreceptor GFRα1 and signals through the transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase RET, or RET independently through NCAM or syndecan-3. Whereas the GDNF signaling cascades are well described, cellular turnover and trafficking of GDNF and its receptors remain poorly characterized. Here, we find that SorLA acts as sorting receptor for the GDNF/GFRα1 complex, directing it from the cell surface to endosomes. Through this mechanism, GDNF is targeted to lysosomes and degraded while GFRα1 recycles, creating an efficient GDNF clearance pathway. The SorLA/GFRα1 complex further targets RET for endocytosis but not for degradation, affecting GDNF-induced neurotrophic activities. SorLA-deficient mice display elevated GDNF levels, altered dopaminergic function, marked hyperactivity, and reduced anxiety, all of which are phenotypes related to abnormal GDNF activity. Taken together, these findings establish SorLA as a critical regulator of GDNF activity in the CNS.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity activates a complex systemic immune response that includes the recruitment of macrophages and other immune cells to key metabolic tissues. Current models postulate that obesity and excess lipids classically activate macrophages, polarizing them toward an M1 (inflammatory) state. Little is known about noninflammatory functions of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs). Here, we show that the expansion of adipose tissue (AT) across models of obesity induces a program of lysosome biogenesis in ATMs and is associated with lipid catabolism but not a classic inflammatory phenotype. This program is induced by factors produced by AT and is tightly coupled to lipid accumulation by ATMs. Inhibition of ATM lysosome function impairs lipid metabolism and increases lipid content in ATMs and reduces whole AT lipolysis. These data argue that ATMs contribute quantitatively to the development of obesity-induced inflammation but also serve an important role in lipid trafficking independent of their inflammatory phenotype.

ALKBH5 Is a Mammalian RNA Demethylase that Impacts RNA Metabolism and Mouse Fertility,

Abstract: Summary
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent internal modification of messenger RNA (mRNA) in higher eukaryotes. Here we report ALKBH5 as another mammalian demethylase that oxidatively reverses m6A in mRNA in vitro and in vivo. This demethylation activity of ALKBH5 significantly affects mRNA export and RNA metabolism as well as the assembly of mRNA processing factors in nuclear speckles. Alkbh5-deficient male mice have increased m6A in mRNA and are characterized by impaired fertility resulting from apoptosis that affects meiotic metaphase-stage spermatocytes. In accordance with this defect, we have identified in mouse testes 1,551 differentially expressed genes that cover broad functional categories and include spermatogenesis-related mRNAs involved in the p53 functional interaction network. The discovery of this RNA demethylase strongly suggests that the reversible m6A modification has fundamental and broad functions in mammalian cells.

Abstract: Summary
Sirtuins are NAD+-dependent protein deacetylases that connect metabolism and cellular homeostasis. Here we show that the nuclear Sirtuin SIRT7 targets PAF53, a subunit of RNA polymerase I (Pol I). Acetylation of PAF53 at lysine 373 by CBP and deacetylation by SIRT7 modulate the association of Pol I with DNA, hypoacetylation correlating with increased rDNA occupancy of Pol I and transcription activation. SIRT7 is released from nucleoli in response to different stress conditions, leading to hyperacetylation of PAF53 and decreased Pol I transcription. Nucleolar detention requires binding of SIRT7 to nascent pre-rRNA, linking the spatial distribution of SIRT7 and deacetylation of PAF53 to ongoing transcription. The results identify a nonhistone target of SIRT7 and uncover an RNA-mediated mechanism that adapts nucleolar transcription to stress signaling.

Abstract: Summary
The human immunoglobulin G (IgG) 2G12 recognizes high-mannose carbohydrates on the HIV type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein gp120. Its two antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) are intramolecularly domain exchanged, resulting in a rigid (Fab)2 unit including a third antigen-binding interface not found in antibodies with flexible Fab arms. We determined crystal structures of dimeric 2G12 IgG created by intermolecular domain exchange, which exhibits increased breadth and >50-fold increased neutralization potency compared with monomeric 2G12. The four Fab and two fragment crystalline (Fc) regions of dimeric 2G12 were localized at low resolution in two independent structures, revealing IgG dimers with two (Fab)2 arms analogous to the Fabs of conventional monomeric IgGs. Structures revealed three conformationally distinct dimers, demonstrating flexibility of the (Fab)2-Fc connections that was confirmed by electron microscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering, and binding studies. We conclude that intermolecular domain exchange, flexibility, and bivalent binding to allow avidity effects are responsible for the increased potency and breadth of dimeric 2G12.

Abstract: Curcumin, a major active compound of Curcuma longa, has been reported to have potent neuroprotective activities. However to date, the relevant mechanisms still remain unclear. In this study, we report that curcumin selectively inhibits L-type Ca2+ channel currents in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Whole-cell currents were recorded using 10mM barium as a charge carrier. Curcumin reversibly inhibited high-voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (HVGCC) currents (IBa) in a concentration-dependent manner but had no apparent effects on the cells treated with nifedipine, a specific L-type Ca2+ channel blocker. Curcumin did not markedly affect the activation of L-type Ca2+ channels while significantly shifted the inactivation curve in the hyperpolarizing direction. Pretreatment of cells with the classical and novel PKC antagonists GF109203X and calphostin C completely abolished curcumin-induced IBa inhibition, whereas the classical PKC antagonist Gö6976 or inhibition of PKA activity elicited no such effects. Moreover, the curcumin-induced IBa response was abolished by intracellular application of the PKC-θ inhibitory peptide PKC-θ-IP or by siRNA knockdown of PKC-θ in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. In these neurons, novel isoforms of PKC including delta (PKC-δ), epsilon (PKC-ɛ) and theta (PKC-θ), but not eta (PKC-η), were endogenously expressed. Taken together, these results suggest that curcumin selectively inhibits IBa via a novel PKC-θ-dependent pathway, which could contribute to its neuroprotective effects in rat hippocampal neurons.

Integration of Left-Right Pitx2 Transcription and Wnt Signaling Drives Asymmetric Gut Morphogenesis via Daam2,

Abstract: Summary
A critical aspect of gut morphogenesis is initiation of a leftward tilt, and failure to do so leads to gut malrotation and volvulus. The direction of tilt is specified by asymmetric cell behaviors within the dorsal mesentery (DM), which suspends the gut tube, and is downstream of Pitx2, the key transcription factor responsible for the transfer of left-right (L-R) information from early gastrulation to morphogenesis. Although Pitx2 is a master regulator of L-R organ development, its cellular targets that drive asymmetric morphogenesis are not known. Using laser microdissection and targeted gene misexpression in the chicken DM, we show that Pitx2-specific effectors mediate Wnt signaling to activate the formin Daam2, a key Wnt effector and itself a Pitx2 target, linking actin dynamics to cadherin-based junctions to ultimately generate asymmetric cell behaviors. Our work highlights how integration of two conserved cascades may be the ultimate force through which Pitx2 sculpts L-R organs.

Abstract: Summary
The replicative machinery encounters many impediments, some of which can be overcome by lesion bypass or replication restart pathways, leaving repair for a later time. However, interstrand crosslinks (ICLs), which preclude DNA unwinding, are considered absolute blocks to replication. Current models suggest that fork collisions, either from one or both sides of an ICL, initiate repair processes required for resumption of replication. To test these proposals, we developed a single-molecule technique for visualizing encounters of replication forks with ICLs as they occur in living cells. Surprisingly, the most frequent patterns were consistent with replication traverse of an ICL, without lesion repair. The traverse frequency was strongly reduced by inactivation of the translocase and DNA binding activities of the FANCM/MHF complex. The results indicate that translocase-based mechanisms enable DNA synthesis to continue past ICLs and that these lesions are not always absolute blocks to replication.

Abstract: Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and orexin are neuropeptides involved in the regulation of feeding in vertebrates. In this study we determined the NPY and orexin mRNA tissue expression and their immunoreactivity distribution in both preoptic area and hypothalamus, regions involved in the regulation of feeding behavior. Both peptides presented a wide expression in all tissues examined. The NPY-immunoreactive (ir) cells were localized in the ventral nucleus posterioris periventricularis (NPPv) and numerous ir-NPY fibers were found in the nucleus lateralis tuberis (NLT), the nucleus recess lateralis (NRL) and the neurohypophysis. Ir-orexin cells were observed in the NPPv, dorsal NLT, ventral NLT, lateral NLT (NLTl) and the lateral NRL. Ir-orexin fibers were widespread distributed along all the hypothalamus, especially in the NLTl. Additionally, we observed the presence of ir-orexin immunostaining in adenohypophyseal cells, especially in somatotroph cells and the presence of a few ir-orexin-A fibers in the neurohypophysis. In conclusion, both peptides have an ubiquitous mRNA tissue expression and are similarly distributed in the hypothalamus and preoptic area of Cichlasoma dimerus. The presence of ir-orexin in adenohypohyseal cells and the presence of ir-orexin and NPY fibers in the neurohypophysis suggest that both peptides may play an important neuroendocrine role in anterior pituitary.

Abstract: Summary
Human mitochondrial DNA is transcribed as long polycistronic transcripts that encompass each strand of the genome and are processed subsequently into mature mRNAs, tRNAs, and rRNAs, necessitating widespread posttranscriptional regulation. Here, we establish methods for massively parallel sequencing and analyses of RNase-accessible regions of human mitochondrial RNA and thereby identify specific regions within mitochondrial transcripts that are bound by proteins. This approach provides a range of insights into the contribution of RNA-binding proteins to the regulation of mitochondrial gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
Increasing evidence points to an important role for the ribosome in the regulation of biological processes and as a target for deregulation in disease. Here, we describe a SILAC (stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture)-based mass spectrometry approach to probing mammalian riboproteomes. Using a panel of cell lines, as well as genetic and pharmacological perturbations, we obtained a comparative characterization of the cellular riboproteome. This analysis identified a set of riboproteome components, consisting of a diverse array of proteins with a strong enrichment for RNA-binding proteins. Importantly, this global analysis uncovers a high incidence of genetic alterations to riboproteome components in cancer, with a distinct bias toward genetic amplification. We further validated association with polyribosomes for several riboproteome components and demonstrate that enrichment at the riboproteome can depend on cell type, genetics, or cellular stimulus. Our results have important implications for the understanding of how ribosomes function and provide a platform for uncovering regulators of translation.

Abstract: Summary
A handful of tumor-derived cell lines form the mainstay of cancer therapeutic development, yielding drugs with an impact typically measured as months to disease progression. To develop more effective breast cancer therapeutics and more readily understand their clinical impact, we constructed a functional metabolic portrait of 46 independently derived breast cell lines. Our analysis of glutamine uptake and dependence identified a subset of triple-negative samples that are glutamine auxotrophs. Ambient glutamine indirectly supports environmental cystine acquisition via the xCT antiporter, which is expressed on one-third of triple-negative tumors in vivo. xCT inhibition with the clinically approved anti-inflammatory sulfasalazine decreases tumor growth, revealing a therapeutic target in breast tumors of poorest prognosis and a lead compound for rapid, effective drug development.

Abstract: Summary
Loss or duplication of chromosome segments can lead to further genomic changes associated with cancer. However, it is not known whether only a select subset of genes is responsible for driving further changes. To determine whether perturbation of any given gene in a genome suffices to drive subsequent genetic changes, we analyzed the yeast knockout collection for secondary mutations of functional consequence. Unlike wild-type, most gene knockout strains were found to have one additional mutant gene affecting nutrient responses and/or heat-stress-induced cell death. Moreover, independent knockouts of the same gene often evolved mutations in the same secondary gene. Genome sequencing identified acquired mutations in several human tumor suppressor homologs. Thus, mutation of any single gene may cause a genomic imbalance, with consequences sufficient to drive adaptive genetic changes. This complicates genetic analyses but is a logical consequence of losing a functional unit originally acquired under pressure during evolution.

Abstract: Summary
Epigenetic regulation plays a critical role in glioblastoma (GBM) tumorigenesis. However, how microRNAs (miRNAs) and cytokines cooperate to regulate GBM tumor progression is still unclear. Here, we show that interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibits miR142-3p expression and promotes GBM propagation by inducing DNA methyltransferase 1-mediated hypermethylation of the miR142-3p promoter. Interestingly, miR142-3p also suppresses IL-6 secretion by targeting the 3′ UTR of IL-6. In addition, miR142-3p also targets the 3′ UTR and suppresses the expression of high-mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2), leading to inhibition of Sox2-related stemness. We further show that HMGA2 enhances Sox2 expression by directly binding to the Sox2 promoter. Clinically, GBM patients whose tumors present upregulated IL-6, HMGA2, and Sox2 protein expressions and hypermethylated miR142-3p promoter also demonstrate poor survival outcome. Orthotopic delivery of miR142-3p blocks IL-6/HMGA2/Sox2 expression and suppresses stem-like properties in GBM-xenotransplanted mice. Collectively, we discovered an IL-6/miR142-3p feedback-loop-dependent regulation of GBM malignancy that could be a potential therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
Telomeres are protected from nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) to avoid deleterious chromosome fusions, yet they associate with the Ku heterodimer that is principal in the classical NHEJ (c-NHEJ) pathway. T-loops have been proposed to inhibit Ku’s association with telomeric ends, thus inhibiting c-NHEJ; however, deficiencies in the t-loop model suggest additional mechanisms are in effect. We demonstrate that TRF2 interacts with Ku at telomeres and via residues in Ku70 helix 5 (α5), which are vital for NHEJ. We show that Ku’s interaction with a TRF2 mutant that induces telomeric fusions is significantly impaired. Additionally, we demonstrate that Ku70 α5 is required for Ku self-association in live cells, which can bridge DNA ends. Together, these findings lead us to propose a model in which telomeres are directly protected from c-NHEJ via TRF2 impeding Ku’s ability to synapse telomere ends.

Abstract: Malignant gliomas are highly invasive brain cancers that carry a dismal prognosis. Recent studies indicate that Cl− channels facilitate glioma cell invasion by promoting hydrodynamic cell shape and volume changes. Here we asked how Cl− channels are regulated in the context of migration. Using patch-clamp recordings we show Cl− currents are activated by physiological increases of [Ca2+]i to 65 and 180nM. Cl− currents appear to be mediated by ClC-3, a voltage-gated, CaMKII-regulated Cl− channel highly expressed by glioma cells. ClC-3 channels colocalized with TRPC1 on caveolar lipid rafts on glioma cell processes. Using perforated-patch electrophysiological recordings, we demonstrate that inducible knockdown of TRPC1 expression with shRNA significantly inhibited glioma Cl− currents in a Ca2+-dependent fashion, placing Cl− channels under the regulation of Ca2+ entry via TRPC1. In chemotaxis assays epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced invasion was inhibition by TRPC1 knockdown to the same extent as pharmacological block of Cl− channels. Thus endogenous glioma Cl− channels are regulated by TRPC1. Cl− channels could be an important downstream target of TRPC1 in many other cells types, coupling elevations in [Ca2+]i to the shape and volume changes associated with migrating cells.

Abstract: Summary
Resting mitochondrial matrix Ca2+ is maintained through a mitochondrial calcium uptake 1 (MICU1)-established threshold inhibition of mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) activity. It is not known how MICU1 interacts with MCU to establish this Ca2+ threshold for mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and MCU activity. Here, we show that MICU1 localizes to the mitochondrial matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane and MICU1/MCU binding is determined by a MICU1 N-terminal polybasic domain and two interacting coiled-coil domains of MCU. Further investigation reveals that MICU1 forms homo-oligomers, and this oligomerization is independent of the polybasic region. However, the polybasic region confers MICU1 oligomeric binding to MCU and controls mitochondrial Ca2+ current (IMCU). Moreover, MICU1 EF hands regulate MCU channel activity, but do not determine MCU binding. Loss of MICU1 promotes MCU activation leading to oxidative burden and a halt to cell migration. These studies establish a molecular mechanism for MICU1 control of MCU-mediated mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation, and dysregulation of this mechanism probably enhances vascular dysfunction.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin organization and gene activity are responsive to developmental and environmental cues. Although many genes are transcribed throughout development and across cell types, much of gene regulation is highly cell-type specific. To readily track chromatin features at the resolution of cell types within complex tissues, we developed and validated chromatin affinity purification from specific cell types by chromatin immunoprecipitation (CAST-ChIP), a broadly applicable biochemical procedure. RNA polymerase II (Pol II) CAST-ChIP identifies ∼1,500 neuronal and glia-specific genes in differentiated cells within the adult Drosophila brain. In contrast, the histone H2A.Z is distributed similarly across cell types and throughout development, marking cell-type-invariant Pol II-bound regions. Our study identifies H2A.Z as an active chromatin signature that is refractory to changes across cell fates. Thus, CAST-ChIP powerfully identifies cell-type-specific as well as cell-type-invariant chromatin states, enabling the systematic dissection of chromatin structure and gene regulation within complex tissues such as the brain.

Abstract: Background
Tooth is vital not only for a good smile, but also good health. Yet, we lose tooth regularly due to accidents or diseases. An ideal solution to this problem is to regenerate tooth with patients’ own cells. Here we describe the generation of tooth-like structures from integration-free human urine induced pluripotent stem cells (ifhU-iPSCs).
Results
We first differentiated ifhU-iPSCs to epithelial sheets, which were then recombined with E14.5 mouse dental mesenchymes. Tooth-like structures were recovered from these recombinants in 3 weeks with success rate up to 30% for 8 different iPSC lines, comparable to H1 hESC. We further detected that ifhU-iPSC derived epithelial sheets differentiated into enamel-secreting ameloblasts in the tooth-like structures, possessing physical properties such as elastic modulus and hardness found in the regular human tooth.
Conclusion
Our results demonstrate that ifhU-iPSCs can be used to regenerate patient specific dental tissues or even tooth for further drug screening or regenerative therapies.

Abstract: Summary
One of the challenges facing memory research is to combine network- and cellular-level descriptions of memory encoding. In this context, Drosophila offers the opportunity to decipher, down to single-cell resolution, memory-relevant circuits in connection with the mushroom bodies (MBs), prominent structures for olfactory learning and memory. Although the MB-afferent circuits involved in appetitive learning were recently described, the circuits underlying appetitive memory retrieval remain unknown. We identified two pairs of cholinergic neurons efferent from the MB α vertical lobes, named MB-V3, that are necessary for the retrieval of appetitive long-term memory (LTM). Furthermore, LTM retrieval was correlated to an enhanced response to the rewarded odor in these neurons. Strikingly, though, silencing the MB-V3 neurons did not affect short-term memory (STM) retrieval. This finding supports a scheme of parallel appetitive STM and LTM processing.

Abstract: Progenitor cell-derived hepatocytes are critical for hepatocyte replenishment. Therefore, we established a line of human hepatic progenitor (HNK1) cells and determined their biological characteristics for experimental and therapeutic applications. HNK1 cells, isolated from human noncirrhotic liver samples with septal fibrosis, showed high expression of the hepatic progenitor cell (HPC) markers EpCAM, CK7, CK19, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), CD90 (Thy1), and EFNA1. Expression of CD133 was very low. Ductular reactions at the periphery of cirrhotic nodules were immunohistochemically positive for these HPC markers, including EFNA1. Sodium butyrate, a differentiation inducer, induced hepatocyte-like morphological changes in HNK1 cells. It resulted in down-regulation of the hepatic progenitor cell markers EpCAM, CK7, CK19, AFP, and EFNA1 and up-regulation of mature hepatocyte markers, including albumin, CK8, and CK18. Furthermore, sodium butyrate treatment and a serial passage of HNK1 cells resulted in enhanced albumin secretion, ureagenesis, and CYP enzyme activity, all of which are indicators of differentiation in hepatocytes. However, HNK1 cells at passage 50 did not exhibit anchorage-independent growth capability and caused no tumors in immunodeficient mice, suggesting that they had no spontaneous malignant transformation ability. From this evidence, HNK1 cells were found to be EpCAM+/CD133−hepatic progenitor cells without spontaneous malignant transformation ability. We therefore conclude that HNK1 cells could be useful for experimental and therapeutic applications.

Abstract: Summary
Neuronal migration is essential for nervous system development in all organisms and is regulated in the nematode, C. elegans, by signaling pathways that are conserved in humans. Here, we demonstrate that the insulin/IGF-1-PI3K signaling pathway modulates the activity of the DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor to regulate the anterior migrations of the hermaphrodite-specific neurons (HSNs) during embryogenesis of C. elegans. When signaling is reduced, DAF-16 is activated and promotes migration; conversely, when signaling is enhanced, DAF-16 is inactivated, and migration is inhibited. We show that DAF-16 acts nonautonomously in the hypodermis to promote HSN migration. Furthermore, we identify PAK-1, a p21-activated kinase, as a downstream mediator of insulin/IGF-1-DAF-16 signaling in the nonautonomous control of HSN migration. Because a FOXO-Pak1 pathway was recently shown to regulate mammalian neuronal polarity, our findings indicate that the roles of FOXO and Pak1 in neuronal migration are most likely conserved from C. elegans to higher organisms.

Abstract: Summary
Increasing evidence suggests that linker histone H1 can influence distinct cellular processes by acting as a gene-specific regulator. However, the mechanistic basis underlying such H1 specificity and whether H1 acts in concert with other chromatin-altering activities remain unclear. Here, we show that one of the H1 subtypes, H1.2, stably interacts with Cul4A E3 ubiquitin ligase and PAF1 elongation complexes and that such interaction potentiates target gene transcription via induction of H4K31ubiquitylation, H3K4me3, and H3K79me2. H1.2, Cul4A, and PAF1 are functionally cooperative because their individual knockdown results in the loss of the corresponding histone marks and the deficiency of target gene transcription. H1.2 interacts with the serine 2-phosphorylated form of RNAPII, and we argue that it recruits the Cul4A and PAF1 complexes to target genes by bridging the interaction between the Cul4A and PAF1 complexes. These data define an expanded role for H1 in regulating gene transcription and illustrate its dependence on the elongation competence of RNAPII.

Abstract: Summary
Microglia are phagocytic cells that form the basis of the brain’s immune system. They derive from primitive macrophages that migrate into the brain during embryogenesis, but the genetic control of microglial development remains elusive. Starting with a genetic screen in zebrafish, we show that the noncanonical NOD-like receptor (NLR) nlrc3-like is essential for microglial formation. Although most NLRs trigger inflammatory signaling, nlrc3-like acts cell autonomously in microglia precursor cells to suppress unwarranted inflammation in the absence of overt immune challenge. In nlrc3-like mutants, primitive macrophages initiate a systemic inflammatory response with increased proinflammatory cytokines and actively aggregate instead of migrating into the brain to form microglia. NLRC3-like requires both its pyrin and NACHT domains, and it can bind the inflammasome component apoptosis-associated speck-like protein. Our studies suggest that NLRC3-like may regulate the inflammasome and other inflammatory pathways. Together, these results demonstrate that NLRC3-like prevents inappropriate macrophage activation, thereby allowing normal microglial development.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression in animals and plants. The recent rapid advancement in miRNA biology, including high-throughput sequencing of small RNA libraries, inspired the development of a bioinformatics software, miRAuto, which predicts putative miRNAs in model plant genomes computationally. Furthermore, miRAuto enables users to identify miRNAs in non-model plant species whose genomes have yet to be fully sequenced. miRAuto analyzes the expression of the 5′-end position of mapped small RNAs in reference sequences to prevent the possibility of mRNA fragments being included as candidate miRNAs. We validated the utility of miRAuto on a small RNA dataset, and the results were compared to other publicly available miRNA prediction programs. In conclusion, miRAuto is a fully automated user-friendly tool for predicting miRNAs from small RNA sequencing data in both model and non-model plant species. miRAuto is available at http://nature.snu.ac.kr/software/miRAuto.htm.

Abstract: Summary
The universally conserved signal recognition particle (SRP) system mediates the targeting of membrane proteins to the translocon in a multistep process controlled by GTP hydrolysis. Here we present the 2.6 Å crystal structure of the GTPase domains of the E. coli SRP protein (Ffh) and its receptor (FtsY) in complex with the tetraloop and the distal region of SRP-RNA, trapped in the activated state in presence of GDP:AlF4. The structure reveals the atomic details of FtsY recruitment and, together with biochemical experiments, pinpoints G83 as the key RNA residue that stimulates GTP hydrolysis. Insertion of G83 into the FtsY active site orients a single glutamate residue provided by Ffh (E277), triggering GTP hydrolysis and complex disassembly at the end of the targeting cycle. The complete conservation of the key residues of the SRP-RNA and the SRP protein implies that the suggested chemical mechanism of GTPase activation is applicable across all kingdoms.

Abstract: Since the completion of the bovine sequencing projects, a substantial number of genetic variations such as single nucleotide polymorphisms have become available across the cattle genome. Recently, cataloguing such genetic variations has been accelerated using massively parallel sequencing technology. However, most of the recent studies have been concentrated on European Bos taurus cattle breeds, resulting in a severe lack of knowledge for valuable native cattle genetic resources worldwide. Here, we present the first whole-genome sequencing results for an endangered Korean native cattle breed, Chikso, using the Illumina HiSeq 2,000 sequencing platform. The genome of a Chikso bull was sequenced to approximately 25.3-fold coverage with 98.8% of the bovine reference genome sequence (UMD 3.1) covered. In total, 5,874,026 single nucleotide polymorphisms and 551,363 insertion/deletions were identified across all 29 autosomes and the X-chromosome, of which 45% and 75% were previously unknown, respectively. Most of the variations (92.7% of single nucleotide polymorphisms and 92.9% of insertion/deletions) were located in intergenic and intron regions. A total of 16,273 single nucleotide polymorphisms causing missense mutations were detected in 7,111 genes throughout the genome, which could potentially contribute to variation in economically important traits in Chikso. This study provides a valuable resource for further investigations of the genetic mechanisms underlying traits of interest in cattle, and for the development of improved genomics-based breeding tools.

Abstract: Summary
Adrenal glands and gonads share a common primordium (AGP), but the molecular events driving differentiation are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that the Wilms tumor suppressor WT1 is a key factor defining AGP identity by inhibiting the steroidogenic differentiation process. Indeed, ectopic expression of WT1 precludes differentiation into adrenocortical steroidogenic cells by locking them into a progenitor state. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments identify Tcf21 and Gli1 as direct targets of WT1. Moreover, cell lineage tracing analyses identify a long-living progenitor population within the adrenal gland, characterized by the expression of WT1, GATA4, GLI1, and TCF21, that can generate steroidogenic cells in vivo. Strikingly, gonadectomy dramatically activates these WT1+ cells and leads to their differentiation into gonadal steroidogenic tissue. Thus, our data describe a mechanism of response to organ loss by recreating hormone-producing cells at a heterotopic site.

Abstract: Summary
The prospective white matter (PWM) in the nascent cerebellum contains a transient germinal compartment that produces all postnatally born GABAergic inhibitory interneurons and astrocytes. However, little is known about the molecular identity and developmental potential of resident progenitors or key regulatory niche signals. Here, we show that neural stem-cell-like primary progenitors (TncYFP-low CD133+) generate intermediate astrocyte (TncYFP-low CD15+) precursors and GABAergic transient amplifying (Ptf1a+) cells. Interestingly, these lineally related but functionally divergent progenitors commonly respond to Sonic hedgehog (Shh), and blockade of reception in TNCYFP-low cells attenuates proliferation in the PWM, reducing both intermediate progenitor classes. Furthermore, we show that Shh produced from distant Purkinje neurons maintains the PWM niche independently of its classical role in regulating granule cell precursor proliferation. Our results indicate that Purkinje neurons maintain a bidirectional signaling axis, driving the production of spatially and functionally opposed inhibitory and excitatory interneurons important for motor learning and cognition.

Abstract: Summary
The rapid, activity-dependent quantal presynaptic release of neurotransmitter is vital for brain function. The complex process of vesicle priming, fusion, and retrieval is very precisely controlled and requires the spatiotemporal coordination of multiple protein-protein interactions. Here, we show that posttranslational modification of the active zone protein Rab3-interacting molecule 1α (RIM1α) by the small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 (SUMO-1) functions as a molecular switch to direct these interactions and is essential for fast synaptic vesicle exocytosis. RIM1α SUMOylation at lysine residue K502 facilitates the clustering of CaV2.1 calcium channels and enhances the Ca2+ influx necessary for vesicular release, whereas non-SUMOylated RIM1α participates in the docking/priming of synaptic vesicles and maintenance of active zone structure. These results demonstrate that SUMOylation of RIM1α is a key determinant of rapid, synchronous neurotransmitter release, and the SUMO-mediated “switching” of RIM1α between binding proteins provides insight into the mechanisms underpinning synaptic function and dysfunction.

Abstract: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) accumulate in various cancers and promote tumor angiogenesis and metastasis, and thus may be ideal targets for the clinical diagnosis of tumor metastasis with high specificity. However, there are few specific markers to distinguish between TAMs and normal or inflammatory macrophages. Here, we show that TAMs localize in green fluorescent proteinlabeled tumors of metastatic lymph nodes (MLNs) from B16F1 melanoma cells but not in necrotic tumor regions, suggesting that TAMs may promote the growth of tumor cells and the progression of tumor metastasis. Furthermore, we isolated pure populations of TAMs from MLNs and characterized their gene expression signatures compared to peritoneal macrophages (PMs), and found that TAMs significantly overexpress immunosuppressive cytokinessuch as IL-4, IL-10, and TGF-β as well as proangiogenic factors such as VEGF, TIE2, and CD31. Notably, immunological analysis revealed that TIE2+/CD31+ macrophages constitute the predominant population of TAMs that infiltrate MLNs, distinct from tissue or inflammatory macrophages. Importantly, these TIE2+/CD31+ macrophages also heavily infiltrated MLNs from human breast cancer biopsies but not reactive hyperplastic LNs. Thus, TIE2+/ CD31+ macrophages may be a unique histopathological biomarker for detecting metastasis in clinical diagnosis, and a novel and promising target for TAM-specific cancer therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Human monogenic obesity syndromes, including Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), implicate neuronal primary cilia in regulation of energy homeostasis. Cilia in hypothalamic neurons have been hypothesized to sense and regulate systemic energy status, but the molecular mechanism of this signaling remains unknown. Here, we report a comprehensive localization screen of 42 G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) revealing seven ciliary GPCRs, including the neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptors NPY2R and NPY5R. We show that mice modeling BBS disease or obese tubby mice fail to localize NPY2R to cilia in the hypothalamus and that BBS mutant mice fail to activate c-fos or decrease food intake in response to the NPY2R ligand PYY3-36. We find that cells with ciliary NPY2R show augmented PYY3-36-dependent cAMP signaling. Our data demonstrate that ciliary targeting of NPY receptors is important for controlling energy balance in mammals, revealing a physiologically defined ligand-receptor pathway signaling within neuronal cilia.

The molecular mechanism underlying G1/S checkpoint bypass in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) remains unknown. DNA damage blocks S phase entry by inhibiting the CDK2 kinase through destruction of its activator, the Cdc25A phosphatase. We observed high Cdc25A levels in G1 that persist even after DNA damage in mouse ESCs. We also found higher expression of Dub3, a deubiquitylase that controls Cdc25A protein abundance. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Dub3 gene is a direct target of Esrrb, a key transcription factor of the self-renewal machinery. We show that Dub3 expression is strongly downregulated during neural conversion and precedes Cdc25A destabilization, while forced Dub3 expression in ESCs becomes lethal upon differentiation, concomitant to cell-cycle remodeling and lineage commitment. Finally, knockdown of either Dub3 or Cdc25A induced spontaneous differentiation of ESCs. Altogether, these findings couple the self-renewal machinery to cell-cycle control through a deubiquitylase in ESCs.

Abstract: Summary
Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is an ancient and conserved neuromodulator of energy balance. Despite its importance, the neural circuits and molecular mechanisms underlying 5-HT-mediated control of body fat remain poorly understood. Here, we decipher the serotonergic neural circuit for body fat loss in C. elegans and show that the effects of 5-HT require signaling from octopamine, the invertebrate analog of adrenaline, to sustain body fat loss. Our results provide a potential molecular explanation for the long-observed potent effects of combined serotonergic and adrenergic weight loss drugs. In metabolic tissues, we find that the conserved regulatory adipocyte triglyceride lipase ATGL-1 drives serotonergic fat loss. We show that the serotonergic chloride channel MOD-1 relays a long-range endocrine signal from C. elegans body cavity neurons to control distal ATGL-1 function, via the nuclear receptor NHR-76. Our findings establish a conserved neuroendocrine axis operated by neural serotonergic and adrenergic-like signaling to regulate body fat.

Abstract: Summary
Aberrant expression of embryonic epithelial-mesenchymal transition-inducing transcription factors (EMT-TFs) in epithelial cells triggers EMT, neoplastic transformation, stemness, and metastatic dissemination. We found that regulation and functions of EMT-TFs are different in malignant melanoma. SNAIL2 and ZEB2 transcription factors are expressed in normal melanocytes and behave as tumor-suppressor proteins by activating an MITF-dependent melanocyte differentiation program. In response to NRAS/BRAF activation, EMT-TF network undergoes a profound reorganization in favor of TWIST1 and ZEB1. This reversible switch cooperates with BRAF in promoting dedifferentiation and neoplastic transformation of melanocytes. We detected EMT-TF reprogramming in late-stage melanoma in association with enhanced phospho-ERK levels. This switch results in E-cadherin loss, enhanced invasion, and constitutes an independent factor of poor prognosis in melanoma patients.

Endogenous miRNA Sponge lincRNA-RoR Regulates Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 in Human Embryonic Stem Cell Self-Renewal,

Abstract: Summary
The embryonic stem cell (ESC) transcriptional and epigenetic networks are controlled by a multilayer regulatory circuitry, including core transcription factors (TFs), posttranscriptional modifier microRNAs (miRNAs), and some other regulators. However, the role of large intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) in this regulatory circuitry and their underlying mechanism remains undefined. Here, we demonstrate that a lincRNA, linc-RoR, may function as a key competing endogenous RNA to link the network of miRNAs and core TFs, e.g., Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog. We show that linc-RoR shares miRNA-response elements with these core TFs and that linc-RoR prevents these core TFs from miRNA-mediated suppression in self-renewing human ESC. We suggest that linc-RoR forms a feedback loop with core TFs and miRNAs to regulate ESC maintenance and differentiation. These results may provide insights into the functional interactions of the components of genetic networks during development and may lead to new therapies for many diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The control of memory retention is important for proper responses to constantly changing environments, but the regulatory mechanisms underlying forgetting have not been fully elucidated. Our genetic analyses in C. elegans revealed that mutants of the TIR-1/JNK-1 pathway exhibited prolonged retention of olfactory adaptation and salt chemotaxis learning. In olfactory adaptation, conditioning induces attenuation of odor-evoked Ca2+ responses in olfactory neurons, and this attenuation is prolonged in the TIR-1/JNK-1-pathway mutant animals. We also found that a pair of neurons in which the pathway functions is required for the acceleration of forgetting, but not for sensation or adaptation, in wild-type animals. In addition, the neurosecretion from these cells is important for the acceleration of forgetting. Therefore, we propose that these neurons accelerate forgetting through the TIR-1/JNK-1 pathway by sending signals that directly or indirectly stimulate forgetting.

Abstract: Summary
Most secretory preproteins exit bacterial cells through the protein translocase, comprising the SecYEG channel and the dimeric peripheral ATPase motor SecA. Energetic coupling to work remains elusive. We now demonstrate that translocation is driven by unusually dynamic quaternary changes in SecA. The dimer occupies several successive states with distinct protomer arrangements. SecA docks on SecYEG as a dimer and becomes functionally asymmetric. Docking occurs via only one protomer. The second protomer allosterically regulates downstream steps. Binding of one preprotein signal peptide to the SecYEG-docked SecA protomer elongates the SecA dimer and triggers the translocase holoenzyme to obtain a lower activation energy conformation. ATP hydrolysis monomerizes the triggered SecA dimer, causing mature chain trapping and processive translocation. This is a unique example of one protein exploiting quaternary dynamics to become a substrate receptor, a “loading clamp,” and a “processive motor.” This mechanism has widespread implications on protein translocases, chaperones, and motors.

Abstract: Summary
The organization of chromosomes into territories plays an important role in a wide range of cellular processes, including gene expression, transcription, and DNA repair. Current understanding has largely excluded the spatiotemporal dynamic fluctuations of the chromatin polymer. We combine in vivo chromatin motion analysis with mathematical modeling to elucidate the physical properties that underlie the formation and fluctuations of territories. Chromosome motion varies in predicted ways along the length of the chromosome, dependent on tethering at the centromere. Detachment of a tether upon inactivation of the centromere results in increased spatial mobility. A confined bead-spring chain tethered at both ends provides a mechanism to generate observed variations in local mobility as a function of distance from the tether. These predictions are realized in experimentally determined higher effective spring constants closer to the centromere. The dynamic fluctuations and territorial organization of chromosomes are, in part, dictated by tethering at the centromere.
