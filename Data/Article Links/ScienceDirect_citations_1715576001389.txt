Abstract: Summary
Previously, two men were cured of HIV-1 through CCR5Δ32 homozygous (CCR5Δ32/Δ32) allogeneic adult stem cell transplant. We report the first remission and possible HIV-1 cure in a mixed-race woman who received a CCR5Δ32/Δ32 haplo-cord transplant (cord blood cells combined with haploidentical stem cells from an adult) to treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Peripheral blood chimerism was 100% CCR5Δ32/Δ32 cord blood by week 14 post-transplant and persisted through 4.8 years of follow-up. Immune reconstitution was associated with (1) loss of detectable replication-competent HIV-1 reservoirs, (2) loss of HIV-1-specific immune responses, (3) in vitro resistance to X4 and R5 laboratory variants, including pre-transplant autologous latent reservoir isolates, and (4) 18 months of HIV-1 control with aviremia, off antiretroviral therapy, starting at 37 months post-transplant. CCR5Δ32/Δ32 haplo-cord transplant achieved remission and a possible HIV-1 cure for a person of diverse ancestry, living with HIV-1, who required a stem cell transplant for acute leukemia.

Abstract: Summary
In Drosophila, a dedicated olfactory channel senses a male pheromone, cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA), promoting female courtship while repelling males. Here, we show that separate cVA-processing streams extract qualitative and positional information. cVA sensory neurons respond to concentration differences in a 5-mm range around a male. Second-order projection neurons encode the angular position of a male by detecting inter-antennal differences in cVA concentration, which are amplified through contralateral inhibition. At the third circuit layer, we identify 47 cell types with diverse input-output connectivity. One population responds tonically to male flies, a second is tuned to olfactory looming, while a third integrates cVA and taste to coincidentally promote female mating. The separation of olfactory features resembles the mammalian what and where visual streams; together with multisensory integration, this enables behavioral responses appropriate to specific ethological contexts.

Abstract: Summary
Prime-boost regimens for COVID-19 vaccines elicit poor antibody responses against Omicron-based variants and employ frequent boosters to maintain antibody levels. We present a natural infection-mimicking technology that combines features of mRNA- and protein nanoparticle-based vaccines through encoding self-assembling enveloped virus-like particles (eVLPs). eVLP assembly is achieved by inserting an ESCRT- and ALIX-binding region (EABR) into the SARS-CoV-2 spike cytoplasmic tail, which recruits ESCRT proteins to induce eVLP budding from cells. Purified spike-EABR eVLPs presented densely arrayed spikes and elicited potent antibody responses in mice. Two immunizations with mRNA-LNP encoding spike-EABR elicited potent CD8+ T cell responses and superior neutralizing antibody responses against original and variant SARS-CoV-2 compared with conventional spike-encoding mRNA-LNP and purified spike-EABR eVLPs, improving neutralizing titers >10-fold against Omicron-based variants for 3 months post-boost. Thus, EABR technology enhances potency and breadth of vaccine-induced responses through antigen presentation on cell surfaces and eVLPs, enabling longer-lasting protection against SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses.

Abstract: Summary
Social interactions require awareness and understanding of the behavior of others. Mirror neurons, cells representing an action by self and others, have been proposed to be integral to the cognitive substrates that enable such awareness and understanding. Mirror neurons of the primate neocortex represent skilled motor tasks, but it is unclear if they are critical for the actions they embody, enable social behaviors, or exist in non-cortical regions. We demonstrate that the activity of individual VMHvlPR neurons in the mouse hypothalamus represents aggression performed by self and others. We used a genetically encoded mirror-TRAP strategy to functionally interrogate these aggression-mirroring neurons. We find that their activity is essential for fighting and that forced activation of these cells triggers aggressive displays by mice, even toward their mirror image. Together, we have discovered a mirroring center in an evolutionarily ancient region that provides a subcortical cognitive substrate essential for a social behavior.

Abstract: Summary
The spectrin-based membrane skeleton is a ubiquitous membrane-associated two-dimensional cytoskeleton underneath the lipid membrane of metazoan cells. Mutations of skeleton proteins impair the mechanical strength and functions of the membrane, leading to several different types of human diseases. Here, we report the cryo-EM structures of the native spectrin-actin junctional complex (from porcine erythrocytes), which is a specialized short F-actin acting as the central organizational unit of the membrane skeleton. While an α-/β-adducin hetero-tetramer binds to the barbed end of F-actin as a flexible cap, tropomodulin and SH3BGRL2 together create an absolute cap at the pointed end. The junctional complex is strengthened by ring-like structures of dematin in the middle actin layers and by patterned periodic interactions with tropomyosin over its entire length. This work serves as a structural framework for understanding the assembly and dynamics of membrane skeleton and offers insights into mechanisms of various ubiquitous F-actin-binding factors in other F-actin systems.

Abstract: Summary
The intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) constitute the primary barrier between host cells and numerous foreign antigens; it is unclear how IECs induce the protective immunity against pathogens while maintaining the immune tolerance to food. Here, we found IECs accumulate a less recognized 13-kD N-terminal fragment of GSDMD that is cleaved by caspase-3/7 in response to dietary antigens. Unlike the 30-kD GSDMD cleavage fragment that executes pyroptosis, the IEC-accumulated GSDMD cleavage fragment translocates to the nucleus and induces the transcription of CIITA and MHCII molecules, which in turn induces the Tr1 cells in upper small intestine. Mice treated with a caspase-3/7 inhibitor, mice with GSDMD mutation resistant to caspase-3/7 cleavage, mice with MHCII deficiency in IECs, and mice with Tr1 deficiency all displayed a disrupted food tolerance phenotype. Our study supports that differential cleavage of GSDMD can be understood as a regulatory hub controlling immunity versus tolerance in the small intestine.

Abstract: Summary
Cytosolic innate immune sensors are critical for host defense and form complexes, such as inflammasomes and PANoptosomes, that induce inflammatory cell death. The sensor NLRP12 is associated with infectious and inflammatory diseases, but its activating triggers and roles in cell death and inflammation remain unclear. Here, we discovered that NLRP12 drives inflammasome and PANoptosome activation, cell death, and inflammation in response to heme plus PAMPs or TNF. TLR2/4-mediated signaling through IRF1 induced Nlrp12 expression, which led to inflammasome formation to induce maturation of IL-1β and IL-18. The inflammasome also served as an integral component of a larger NLRP12-PANoptosome that drove inflammatory cell death through caspase-8/RIPK3. Deletion of Nlrp12 protected mice from acute kidney injury and lethality in a hemolytic model. Overall, we identified NLRP12 as an essential cytosolic sensor for heme plus PAMPs-mediated PANoptosis, inflammation, and pathology, suggesting that NLRP12 and molecules in this pathway are potential drug targets for hemolytic and inflammatory diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Resilience enables mental elasticity in individuals when rebounding from adversity. In this study, we identified a microcircuit and relevant molecular adaptations that play a role in natural resilience. We found that activation of parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in the primary auditory cortex (A1) by thalamic inputs from the ipsilateral medial geniculate body (MG) is essential for resilience in mice exposed to chronic social defeat stress. Early attacks during chronic social defeat stress induced short-term hyperpolarizations of MG neurons projecting to the A1 (MGA1 neurons) in resilient mice. In addition, this temporal neural plasticity of MGA1 neurons initiated synaptogenesis onto thalamic PV neurons via presynaptic BDNF–TrkB signaling in subsequent stress responses. Moreover, optogenetic mimicking of the short-term hyperpolarization of MGA1 neurons, rather than merely activating MGA1 neurons, elicited innate resilience mechanisms in response to stress and achieved sustained antidepressant-like effects in multiple animal models, representing a new strategy for targeted neuromodulation.

Abstract: Summary
The third and fourth weeks of gestation in primates are marked by several developmental milestones, including gastrulation and the formation of organ primordia. However, our understanding of this period is limited due to restricted access to in vivo embryos. To address this gap, we developed an embedded 3D culture system that allows for the extended ex utero culture of cynomolgus monkey embryos for up to 25 days post-fertilization. Morphological, histological, and single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses demonstrate that ex utero cultured monkey embryos largely recapitulated key events of in vivo development. With this platform, we were able to delineate lineage trajectories and genetic programs involved in neural induction, lateral plate mesoderm differentiation, yolk sac hematopoiesis, primitive gut, and primordial germ-cell-like cell development in monkeys. Our embedded 3D culture system provides a robust and reproducible platform for growing monkey embryos from blastocysts to early organogenesis and studying primate embryogenesis ex utero.

Abstract: Summary
Inter-patient variability and the similarity of healthy and leukemic stem cells (LSCs) have impeded the characterization of LSCs in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and their differentiation landscape. Here, we introduce CloneTracer, a novel method that adds clonal resolution to single-cell RNA-seq datasets. Applied to samples from 19 AML patients, CloneTracer revealed routes of leukemic differentiation. Although residual healthy and preleukemic cells dominated the dormant stem cell compartment, active LSCs resembled their healthy counterpart and retained erythroid capacity. By contrast, downstream myeloid progenitors constituted a highly aberrant, disease-defining compartment: their gene expression and differentiation state affected both the chemotherapy response and leukemia’s ability to differentiate into transcriptomically normal monocytes. Finally, we demonstrated the potential of CloneTracer to identify surface markers misregulated specifically in leukemic cells. Taken together, CloneTracer reveals a differentiation landscape that mimics its healthy counterpart and may determine biology and therapy response in AML.

Abstract: Summary
Remote tumors disrupt the bone marrow (BM) ecosystem (BME), eliciting the overproduction of BM-derived immunosuppressive cells. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Herein, we characterized breast and lung cancer-induced BME shifts pre- and post-tumor removal. Remote tumors progressively lead to osteoprogenitor (OP) expansion, hematopoietic stem cell dislocation, and CD41− granulocyte-monocyte progenitor (GMP) aggregation. The tumor-entrained BME is characterized by co-localization between CD41− GMPs and OPs. OP ablation abolishes this effect and diminishes abnormal myeloid overproduction. Mechanistically, HTRA1 carried by tumor-derived small extracellular vesicles upregulates MMP-13 in OPs, which in turn induces the alterations in the hematopoietic program. Importantly, these effects persist post-surgery and continue to impair anti-tumor immunity. Conditional knockout or inhibition of MMP-13 accelerates immune reinstatement and restores the efficacies of immunotherapies. Therefore, tumor-induced systemic effects are initiated by OP-GMP crosstalk that outlasts tumor burden, and additional treatment is required to reverse these effects for optimal therapeutic efficacy.

Abstract: Summary
Down syndrome (DS) is a neurological disorder with multiple immune-related symptoms; however, crosstalk between the CNS and peripheral immune system remains unexplored. Using parabiosis and plasma infusion, we found that blood-borne factors drive synaptic deficits in DS. Proteomic analysis revealed elevation of β2-microglobulin (B2M), a major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) component, in human DS plasma. Systemic administration of B2M in wild-type mice led to synaptic and memory defects similar to those observed in DS mice. Moreover, genetic ablation of B2m or systemic administration of an anti-B2M antibody counteracts synaptic impairments in DS mice. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that B2M antagonizes NMDA receptor (NMDAR) function through interactions with the GluN1-S2 loop; blocking B2M-NMDAR interactions using competitive peptides restores NMDAR-dependent synaptic function. Our findings identify B2M as an endogenous NMDAR antagonist and reveal a pathophysiological role for circulating B2M in NMDAR dysfunction in DS and related cognitive disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding how genetic variants impact molecular phenotypes is a key goal of functional genomics, currently hindered by reliance on a single haploid reference genome. Here, we present the EN-TEx resource of 1,635 open-access datasets from four donors (∼30 tissues × ∼15 assays). The datasets are mapped to matched, diploid genomes with long-read phasing and structural variants, instantiating a catalog of >1 million allele-specific loci. These loci exhibit coordinated activity along haplotypes and are less conserved than corresponding, non-allele-specific ones. Surprisingly, a deep-learning transformer model can predict the allele-specific activity based only on local nucleotide-sequence context, highlighting the importance of transcription-factor-binding motifs particularly sensitive to variants. Furthermore, combining EN-TEx with existing genome annotations reveals strong associations between allele-specific and GWAS loci. It also enables models for transferring known eQTLs to difficult-to-profile tissues (e.g., from skin to heart). Overall, EN-TEx provides rich data and generalizable models for more accurate personal functional genomics.

Abstract: Summary
Functional genomic strategies have become fundamental for annotating gene function and regulatory networks. Here, we combined functional genomics with proteomics by quantifying protein abundances in a genome-scale knockout library in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry. We find that global protein expression is driven by a complex interplay of (1) general biological properties, including translation rate, protein turnover, the formation of protein complexes, growth rate, and genome architecture, followed by (2) functional properties, such as the connectivity of a protein in genetic, metabolic, and physical interaction networks. Moreover, we show that functional proteomics complements current gene annotation strategies through the assessment of proteome profile similarity, protein covariation, and reverse proteome profiling. Thus, our study reveals principles that govern protein expression and provides a genome-spanning resource for functional annotation.

Abstract: Summary
Snakes are a remarkable squamate lineage with unique morphological adaptations, especially those related to the evolution of vertebrate skeletons, organs, and sensory systems. To clarify the genetic underpinnings of snake phenotypes, we assembled and analyzed 14 de novo genomes from 12 snake families. We also investigated the genetic basis of the morphological characteristics of snakes using functional experiments. We identified genes, regulatory elements, and structural variations that have potentially contributed to the evolution of limb loss, an elongated body plan, asymmetrical lungs, sensory systems, and digestive adaptations in snakes. We identified some of the genes and regulatory elements that might have shaped the evolution of vision, the skeletal system and diet in blind snakes, and thermoreception in infrared-sensitive snakes. Our study provides insights into the evolution and development of snakes and vertebrates.

Abstract: Summary
Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is an important signaling sphingolipid that regulates the immune system, angiogenesis, auditory function, and epithelial and endothelial barrier integrity. Spinster homolog 2 (Spns2) is an S1P transporter that exports S1P to initiate lipid signaling cascades. Modulating Spns2 activity can be beneficial in treatments of cancer, inflammation, and immune diseases. However, the transport mechanism of Spns2 and its inhibition remain unclear. Here, we present six cryo-EM structures of human Spns2 in lipid nanodiscs, including two functionally relevant intermediate conformations that link the inward- and outward-facing states, to reveal the structural basis of the S1P transport cycle. Functional analyses suggest that Spns2 exports S1P via facilitated diffusion, a mechanism distinct from other MFS lipid transporters. Finally, we show that the Spns2 inhibitor 16d attenuates the transport activity by locking Spns2 in the inward-facing state. Our work sheds light on Spns2-mediated S1P transport and aids the development of advanced Spns2 inhibitors.

Abstract: Summary
Patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) exhibit progressive memory loss, depression, and anxiety, accompanied by impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). Whether AHN can be enhanced in impaired AD brain to restore cognitive and affective function remains elusive. Here, we report that patterned optogenetic stimulation of the hypothalamic supramammillary nucleus (SuM) enhances AHN in two distinct AD mouse models, 5×FAD and 3×Tg-AD. Strikingly, the chemogenetic activation of SuM-enhanced adult-born neurons (ABNs) rescues memory and emotion deficits in these AD mice. By contrast, SuM stimulation alone or activation of ABNs without SuM modification fails to restore behavioral deficits. Furthermore, quantitative phosphoproteomics analyses reveal activation of the canonical pathways related to synaptic plasticity and microglia phagocytosis of plaques following acute chemogenetic activation of SuM-enhanced (vs. control) ABNs. Our study establishes the activity-dependent contribution of SuM-enhanced ABNs in modulating AD-related deficits and informs signaling mechanisms mediated by the activation of SuM-enhanced ABNs.

Abstract: Summary
The ClpC1:ClpP1P2 protease is a core component of the proteostasis system in mycobacteria. To improve the efficacy of antitubercular agents targeting the Clp protease, we characterized the mechanism of the antibiotics cyclomarin A and ecumicin. Quantitative proteomics revealed that the antibiotics cause massive proteome imbalances, including upregulation of two unannotated yet conserved stress response factors, ClpC2 and ClpC3. These proteins likely protect the Clp protease from excessive amounts of misfolded proteins or from cyclomarin A, which we show to mimic damaged proteins. To overcome the Clp security system, we developed a BacPROTAC that induces degradation of ClpC1 together with its ClpC2 caretaker. The dual Clp degrader, built from linked cyclomarin A heads, was highly efficient in killing pathogenic Mycobacterium tuberculosis, with >100-fold increased potency over the parent antibiotic. Together, our data reveal Clp scavenger proteins as important proteostasis safeguards and highlight the potential of BacPROTACs as future antibiotics.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we describe an approach to correct the genetic defect in fragile X syndrome (FXS) via recruitment of endogenous repair mechanisms. A leading cause of autism spectrum disorders, FXS results from epigenetic silencing of FMR1 due to a congenital trinucleotide (CGG) repeat expansion. By investigating conditions favorable to FMR1 reactivation, we find MEK and BRAF inhibitors that induce a strong repeat contraction and full FMR1 reactivation in cellular models. We trace the mechanism to DNA demethylation and site-specific R-loops, which are necessary and sufficient for repeat contraction. A positive feedback cycle comprising demethylation, de novo FMR1 transcription, and R-loop formation results in the recruitment of endogenous DNA repair mechanisms that then drive excision of the long CGG repeat. Repeat contraction is specific to FMR1 and restores the production of FMRP protein. Our study therefore identifies a potential method of treating FXS in the future.

Abstract: Summary
Little is known about the critical metabolic changes that neural cells have to undergo during development and how temporary shifts in this program can influence brain circuitries and behavior. Inspired by the discovery that mutations in SLC7A5, a transporter of metabolically essential large neutral amino acids (LNAAs), lead to autism, we employed metabolomic profiling to study the metabolic states of the cerebral cortex across different developmental stages. We found that the forebrain undergoes significant metabolic remodeling throughout development, with certain groups of metabolites showing stage-specific changes, but what are the consequences of perturbing this metabolic program? By manipulating Slc7a5 expression in neural cells, we found that the metabolism of LNAAs and lipids are interconnected in the cortex. Deletion of Slc7a5 in neurons affects the postnatal metabolic state, leading to a shift in lipid metabolism. Additionally, it causes stage- and cell-type-specific alterations in neuronal activity patterns, resulting in a long-term circuit dysfunction.

Abstract: Summary
It is unknown whether pangolins, the most trafficked mammals, play a role in the zoonotic transmission of bat coronaviruses. We report the circulation of a novel MERS-like coronavirus in Malayan pangolins, named Manis javanica HKU4-related coronavirus (MjHKU4r-CoV). Among 86 animals, four tested positive by pan-CoV PCR, and seven tested seropositive (11 and 12.8%). Four nearly identical (99.9%) genome sequences were obtained, and one virus was isolated (MjHKU4r-CoV-1). This virus utilizes human dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (hDPP4) as a receptor and host proteases for cell infection, which is enhanced by a furin cleavage site that is absent in all known bat HKU4r-CoVs. The MjHKU4r-CoV-1 spike shows higher binding affinity for hDPP4, and MjHKU4r-CoV-1 has a wider host range than bat HKU4-CoV. MjHKU4r-CoV-1 is infectious and pathogenic in human airways and intestinal organs and in hDPP4-transgenic mice. Our study highlights the importance of pangolins as reservoir hosts of coronaviruses poised for human disease emergence.

Abstract: Summary
Hybrid potato breeding will transform the crop from a clonally propagated tetraploid to a seed-reproducing diploid. Historical accumulation of deleterious mutations in potato genomes has hindered the development of elite inbred lines and hybrids. Utilizing a whole-genome phylogeny of 92 Solanaceae and its sister clade species, we employ an evolutionary strategy to identify deleterious mutations. The deep phylogeny reveals the genome-wide landscape of highly constrained sites, comprising ∼2.4% of the genome. Based on a diploid potato diversity panel, we infer 367,499 deleterious variants, of which 50% occur at non-coding and 15% at synonymous sites. Counterintuitively, diploid lines with relatively high homozygous deleterious burden can be better starting material for inbred-line development, despite showing less vigorous growth. Inclusion of inferred deleterious mutations increases genomic-prediction accuracy for yield by 24.7%. Our study generates insights into the genome-wide incidence and properties of deleterious mutations and their far-reaching consequences for breeding.

Abstract: Summary
Schwann cells (SCs) are the primary glia of the peripheral nervous system. SCs are involved in many debilitating disorders, including diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Here, we present a strategy for deriving SCs from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) that enables comprehensive studies of SC development, physiology, and disease. hPSC-derived SCs recapitulate the molecular features of primary SCs and are capable of in vitro and in vivo myelination. We established a model of DPN that revealed the selective vulnerability of SCs to high glucose. We performed a high-throughput screen and found that an antidepressant drug, bupropion, counteracts glucotoxicity in SCs. Treatment of hyperglycemic mice with bupropion prevents their sensory dysfunction, SC death, and myelin damage. Further, our retrospective analysis of health records revealed that bupropion treatment is associated with a lower incidence of neuropathy among diabetic patients. These results highlight the power of this approach for identifying therapeutic candidates for DPN.

Abstract: Summary
The use of probiotics by cancer patients is increasing, including among those undergoing immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment. Here, we elucidate a critical microbial-host crosstalk between probiotic-released aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonist indole-3-aldehyde (I3A) and CD8 T cells within the tumor microenvironment that potently enhances antitumor immunity and facilitates ICI in preclinical melanoma. Our study reveals that probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri (Lr) translocates to, colonizes, and persists within melanoma, where via its released dietary tryptophan catabolite I3A, it locally promotes interferon-γ-producing CD8 T cells, thereby bolstering ICI. Moreover, Lr-secreted I3A was both necessary and sufficient to drive antitumor immunity, and loss of AhR signaling within CD8 T cells abrogated Lr’s antitumor effects. Further, a tryptophan-enriched diet potentiated both Lr- and ICI-induced antitumor immunity, dependent on CD8 T cell AhR signaling. Finally, we provide evidence for a potential role of I3A in promoting ICI efficacy and survival in advanced melanoma patients.

Abstract: Summary
Bats are distinctive among mammals due to their ability to fly, use laryngeal echolocation, and tolerate viruses. However, there are currently no reliable cellular models for studying bat biology or their response to viral infections. Here, we created induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from two species of bats: the wild greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) and the greater mouse-eared bat (Myotis myotis). The iPSCs from both bat species showed similar characteristics and had a gene expression profile resembling that of cells attacked by viruses. They also had a high number of endogenous viral sequences, particularly retroviruses. These results suggest that bats have evolved mechanisms to tolerate a large load of viral sequences and may have a more intertwined relationship with viruses than previously thought. Further study of bat iPSCs and their differentiated progeny will provide insights into bat biology, virus host relationships, and the molecular basis of bats’ special traits.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial activity differs markedly between organs, but it is not known how and when this arises. Here we show that cell lineage-specific expression profiles involving essential mitochondrial genes emerge at an early stage in mouse development, including tissue-specific isoforms present before organ formation. However, the nuclear transcriptional signatures were not independent of organelle function. Genetically disrupting intra-mitochondrial protein synthesis with two different mtDNA mutations induced cell lineage-specific compensatory responses, including molecular pathways not previously implicated in organellar maintenance. We saw downregulation of genes whose expression is known to exacerbate the effects of exogenous mitochondrial toxins, indicating a transcriptional adaptation to mitochondrial dysfunction during embryonic development. The compensatory pathways were both tissue and mutation specific and under the control of transcription factors which promote organelle resilience. These are likely to contribute to the tissue specificity which characterizes human mitochondrial diseases and are potential targets for organ-directed treatments.

Abstract: Summary
Systematic evaluation of the impact of genetic variants is critical for the study and treatment of human physiology and disease. While specific mutations can be introduced by genome engineering, we still lack scalable approaches that are applicable to the important setting of primary cells, such as blood and immune cells. Here, we describe the development of massively parallel base-editing screens in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Such approaches enable functional screens for variant effects across any hematopoietic differentiation state. Moreover, they allow for rich phenotyping through single-cell RNA sequencing readouts and separately for characterization of editing outcomes through pooled single-cell genotyping. We efficiently design improved leukemia immunotherapy approaches, comprehensively identify non-coding variants modulating fetal hemoglobin expression, define mechanisms regulating hematopoietic differentiation, and probe the pathogenicity of uncharacterized disease-associated variants. These strategies will advance effective and high-throughput variant-to-function mapping in human hematopoiesis to identify the causes of diverse diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Memories initially formed in hippocampus gradually stabilize to cortex over weeks-to-months for long-term storage. The mechanistic details of this brain re-organization remain poorly understood. We recorded bulk neural activity in circuits that link hippocampus and cortex as mice performed a memory-guided virtual-reality task over weeks. We identified a prominent and sustained neural correlate of memory in anterior thalamus, whose inhibition substantially disrupted memory consolidation. More strikingly, gain amplification enhanced consolidation of otherwise unconsolidated memories. To gain mechanistic insights, we developed a technology for simultaneous cellular-resolution imaging of hippocampus, thalamus, and cortex throughout consolidation. We found that whereas hippocampus equally encodes multiple memories, the anteromedial thalamus preferentially encodes salient memories, and gradually increases correlations with cortex to facilitate tuning and synchronization of cortical ensembles. We thus identify a thalamo-cortical circuit that gates memory consolidation and propose a mechanism suitable for the selection and stabilization of hippocampal memories into longer-term cortical storage.

Abstract: Summary
Human stem cell-derived blastoids display similar morphology and cell lineages to normal blastocysts. However, the ability to investigate their developmental potential is limited. Here, we construct cynomolgus monkey blastoids resembling blastocysts in morphology and transcriptomics using naive ESCs. These blastoids develop to embryonic disk with the structures of yolk sac, chorionic cavity, amnion cavity, primitive streak, and connecting stalk along the rostral-caudal axis through prolonged in vitro culture (IVC). Primordial germ cells, gastrulating cells, visceral endoderm/yolk sac endoderm, three germ layers, and hemato-endothelial progenitors in IVC cynomolgus monkey blastoids were observed by single-cell transcriptomics or immunostaining. Moreover, transferring cynomolgus monkey blastoids to surrogates achieves pregnancies, as indicated by progesterone levels and presence of early gestation sacs. Our results reveal the capacity of in vitro gastrulation and in vivo early pregnancy of cynomolgus monkey blastoids, providing a useful system to dissect primate embryonic development without the same ethical concerns and access challenges in human embryo study.

Abstract: Summary
Negative-stranded RNA viruses can establish long-term persistent infection in the form of large intracellular inclusions in the human host and cause chronic diseases. Here, we uncover how cellular stress disrupts the metastable host-virus equilibrium in persistent infection and induces viral replication in a culture model of mumps virus. Using a combination of cell biology, whole-cell proteomics, and cryo-electron tomography, we show that persistent viral replication factories are dynamic condensates and identify the largely disordered viral phosphoprotein as a driver of their assembly. Upon stress, increased phosphorylation of the phosphoprotein at its interaction interface with the viral polymerase coincides with the formation of a stable replication complex. By obtaining atomic models for the authentic mumps virus nucleocapsid, we elucidate a concomitant conformational change that exposes the viral genome to its replication machinery. These events constitute a stress-mediated switch within viral condensates that provide an environment to support upregulation of viral replication.

Abstract: Summary
Lungs undergo mechanical strain during breathing, but how these biophysical forces affect cell fate and tissue homeostasis are unclear. We show that biophysical forces through normal respiratory motion actively maintain alveolar type 1 (AT1) cell identity and restrict these cells from reprogramming into AT2 cells in the adult lung. AT1 cell fate is maintained at homeostasis by Cdc42- and Ptk2-mediated actin remodeling and cytoskeletal strain, and inactivation of these pathways causes a rapid reprogramming into the AT2 cell fate. This plasticity induces chromatin reorganization and changes in nuclear lamina-chromatin interactions, which can discriminate AT1 and AT2 cell identity. Unloading the biophysical forces of breathing movements leads to AT1-AT2 cell reprogramming, revealing that normal respiration is essential to maintain alveolar epithelial cell fate. These data demonstrate the integral function of mechanotransduction in maintaining lung cell fate and identifies the AT1 cell as an important mechanosensor in the alveolar niche.

Abstract: Summary
Bats are special in their ability to live long and host many emerging viruses. Our previous studies showed that bats have altered inflammasomes, which are central players in aging and infection. However, the role of inflammasome signaling in combating inflammatory diseases remains poorly understood. Here, we report bat ASC2 as a potent negative regulator of inflammasomes. Bat ASC2 is highly expressed at both the mRNA and protein levels and is highly potent in inhibiting human and mouse inflammasomes. Transgenic expression of bat ASC2 in mice reduced the severity of peritonitis induced by gout crystals and ASC particles. Bat ASC2 also dampened inflammation induced by multiple viruses and reduced mortality of influenza A virus infection. Importantly, it also suppressed SARS-CoV-2-immune-complex-induced inflammasome activation. Four key residues were identified for the gain of function of bat ASC2. Our results demonstrate that bat ASC2 is an important negative regulator of inflammasomes with therapeutic potential in inflammatory diseases.

Abstract: Summary
β-arrestin plays a key role in G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling and desensitization. Despite recent structural advances, the mechanisms that govern receptor-β-arrestin interactions at the plasma membrane of living cells remain elusive. Here, we combine single-molecule microscopy with molecular dynamics simulations to dissect the complex sequence of events involved in β-arrestin interactions with both receptors and the lipid bilayer. Unexpectedly, our results reveal that β-arrestin spontaneously inserts into the lipid bilayer and transiently interacts with receptors via lateral diffusion on the plasma membrane. Moreover, they indicate that, following receptor interaction, the plasma membrane stabilizes β-arrestin in a longer-lived, membrane-bound state, allowing it to diffuse to clathrin-coated pits separately from the activating receptor. These results expand our current understanding of β-arrestin function at the plasma membrane, revealing a critical role for β-arrestin preassociation with the lipid bilayer in facilitating its interactions with receptors and subsequent activation.

Abstract: Summary
The enteric nervous system (ENS) is derived from both the vagal and sacral component of the neural crest (NC). Here, we present the derivation of sacral ENS precursors from human PSCs via timed exposure to FGF, WNT, and GDF11, which enables posterior patterning and transition from posterior trunk to sacral NC identity, respectively. Using a SOX2::H2B-tdTomato/T::H2B-GFP dual reporter hPSC line, we demonstrate that both trunk and sacral NC emerge from a double-positive neuro-mesodermal progenitor (NMP). Vagal and sacral NC precursors yield distinct neuronal subtypes and migratory behaviors in vitro and in vivo. Remarkably, xenografting of both vagal and sacral NC lineages is required to rescue a mouse model of total aganglionosis, suggesting opportunities in the treatment of severe forms of Hirschsprung’s disease.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal and aging are tightly regulated by paracrine factors from the bone marrow niche. However, whether HSC rejuvenation could be achieved by engineering a bone marrow niche ex vivo remains unknown. Here, we show that matrix stiffness fine-tunes HSC niche factor expression by bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). Increased stiffness activates Yap/Taz signaling to promote BMSC expansion upon 2D culture, which is largely reversed by 3D culture in soft gelatin methacrylate hydrogels. Notably, 3D co-culture with BMSCs promotes HSC maintenance and lymphopoiesis, reverses aging hallmarks of HSCs, and restores their long-term multilineage reconstitution capacity. In situ atomic force microscopy analysis reveals that mouse bone marrow stiffens with age, which correlates with a compromised HSC niche. Taken together, this study highlights the biomechanical regulation of the HSC niche by BMSCs, which could be harnessed to engineer a soft bone marrow niche for HSC rejuvenation.

Abstract: Summary
The hourglass model describes the convergence of species within the same phylum to a similar body plan during development; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon in mammals remain poorly described. Here, we compare rabbit and mouse time-resolved differentiation trajectories to revisit this model at single-cell resolution. We modeled gastrulation dynamics using hundreds of embryos sampled between gestation days 6.0 and 8.5 and compared the species using a framework for time-resolved single-cell differentiation-flows analysis. We find convergence toward similar cell-state compositions at E7.5, supported by the quantitatively conserved expression of 76 transcription factors, despite divergence in surrounding trophoblast and hypoblast signaling. However, we observed noticeable changes in specification timing of some lineages and divergence of primordial germ cell programs, which in the rabbit do not activate mesoderm genes. Comparative analysis of temporal differentiation models provides a basis for studying the evolution of gastrulation dynamics across mammals.

Abstract: Summary
The Commander complex is required for endosomal recycling of diverse transmembrane cargos and is mutated in Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome. It comprises two sub-assemblies: Retriever composed of VPS35L, VPS26C, and VPS29; and the CCC complex which contains twelve subunits: COMMD1-COMMD10 and the coiled-coil domain-containing (CCDC) proteins CCDC22 and CCDC93. Combining X-ray crystallography, electron cryomicroscopy, and in silico predictions, we have assembled a complete structural model of Commander. Retriever is distantly related to the endosomal Retromer complex but has unique features preventing the shared VPS29 subunit from interacting with Retromer-associated factors. The COMMD proteins form a distinctive hetero-decameric ring stabilized by extensive interactions with CCDC22 and CCDC93. These adopt a coiled-coil structure that connects the CCC and Retriever assemblies and recruits a 16th subunit, DENND10, to form the complete Commander complex. The structure allows mapping of disease-causing mutations and reveals the molecular features required for the function of this evolutionarily conserved trafficking machinery.

Abstract: Summary
RNA editing is a widespread epigenetic process that can alter the amino acid sequence of proteins, termed “recoding.” In cephalopods, most transcripts are recoded, and recoding is hypothesized to be an adaptive strategy to generate phenotypic plasticity. However, how animals use RNA recoding dynamically is largely unexplored. We investigated the function of cephalopod RNA recoding in the microtubule motor proteins kinesin and dynein. We found that squid rapidly employ RNA recoding in response to changes in ocean temperature, and kinesin variants generated in cold seawater displayed enhanced motile properties in single-molecule experiments conducted in the cold. We also identified tissue-specific recoded squid kinesin variants that displayed distinct motile properties. Finally, we showed that cephalopod recoding sites can guide the discovery of functional substitutions in non-cephalopod kinesin and dynein. Thus, RNA recoding is a dynamic mechanism that generates phenotypic plasticity in cephalopods and can inform the characterization of conserved non-cephalopod proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) offer a promising cell-based therapy for myocardial infarction. However, the presence of transitory ventricular arrhythmias, termed engraftment arrhythmias (EAs), hampers clinical applications. We hypothesized that EA results from pacemaker-like activity of hPSC-CMs associated with their developmental immaturity. We characterized ion channel expression patterns during maturation of transplanted hPSC-CMs and used pharmacology and genome editing to identify those responsible for automaticity in vitro. Multiple engineered cell lines were then transplanted in vivo into uninjured porcine hearts. Abolishing depolarization-associated genes HCN4, CACNA1H, and SLC8A1, along with overexpressing hyperpolarization-associated KCNJ2, creates hPSC-CMs that lack automaticity but contract when externally stimulated. When transplanted in vivo, these cells engrafted and coupled electromechanically with host cardiomyocytes without causing sustained EAs. This study supports the hypothesis that the immature electrophysiological prolife of hPSC-CMs mechanistically underlies EA. Thus, targeting automaticity should improve the safety profile of hPSC-CMs for cardiac remuscularization.

Abstract: Summary
Over the past few years, numerous anti-phage defense systems have been discovered in bacteria. Although the mechanism of defense for some of these systems is understood, a major unanswered question is how these systems sense phage infection. To systematically address this question, we isolated 177 phage mutants that escape 15 different defense systems. In many cases, these escaper phages were mutated in the gene sensed by the defense system, enabling us to map the phage determinants that confer sensitivity to bacterial immunity. Our data identify specificity determinants of diverse retron systems and reveal phage-encoded triggers for multiple abortive infection systems. We find general themes in phage sensing and demonstrate that mechanistically diverse systems have converged to sense either the core replication machinery of the phage, phage structural components, or host takeover mechanisms. Combining our data with previous findings, we formulate key principles on how bacterial immune systems sense phage invaders.

Abstract: Summary
Although Ca2+ has long been recognized as an obligatory intermediate in visual transduction, its role in plant phototransduction remains elusive. Here, we report a Ca2+ signaling that controls photoreceptor phyB nuclear translocation in etiolated seedlings during dark-to-light transition. Red light stimulates acute cytosolic Ca2+ increases via phyB, which are sensed by Ca2+-binding protein kinases, CPK6 and CPK12 (CPK6/12). Upon Ca2+ activation, CPK6/12 in turn directly interact with and phosphorylate photo-activated phyB at Ser80/Ser106 to initiate phyB nuclear import. Non-phosphorylatable mutation, phyBS80A/S106A, abolishes nuclear translocation and fails to complement phyB mutant, which is fully restored by combining phyBS80A/S106A with a nuclear localization signal. We further show that CPK6/12 function specifically in the early phyB-mediated cotyledon expansion, while Ser80/Ser106 phosphorylation generally governs phyB nuclear translocation. Our results uncover a biochemical regulatory loop centered in phyB phototransduction and provide a paradigm for linking ubiquitous Ca2+ increases to specific responses in sensory stimulus processing.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer immunotherapies, including adoptive T cell transfer, can be ineffective because tumors evolve to display antigen-loss-variant clones. Therapies that activate multiple branches of the immune system may eliminate escape variants. Here, we show that melanoma-specific CD4+ T cell therapy in combination with OX40 co-stimulation or CTLA-4 blockade can eradicate melanomas containing antigen escape variants. As expected, early on-target recognition of melanoma antigens by tumor-specific CD4+ T cells was required. Surprisingly, complete tumor eradication was dependent on neutrophils and partly dependent on inducible nitric oxide synthase. In support of these findings, extensive neutrophil activation was observed in mouse tumors and in biopsies of melanoma patients treated with immune checkpoint blockade. Transcriptomic and flow cytometry analyses revealed a distinct anti-tumorigenic neutrophil subset present in treated mice. Our findings uncover an interplay between T cells mediating the initial anti-tumor immune response and neutrophils mediating the destruction of tumor antigen loss variants.

Abstract: Summary
T cell responses play an important role in protection against beta-coronavirus infections, including SARS-CoV-2, where they associate with decreased COVID-19 disease severity and duration. To enhance T cell immunity across epitopes infrequently altered in SARS-CoV-2 variants, we designed BNT162b4, an mRNA vaccine component that is intended to be combined with BNT162b2, the spike-protein-encoding vaccine. BNT162b4 encodes variant-conserved, immunogenic segments of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid, membrane, and ORF1ab proteins, targeting diverse HLA alleles. BNT162b4 elicits polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to diverse epitopes in animal models, alone or when co-administered with BNT162b2 while preserving spike-specific immunity. Importantly, we demonstrate that BNT162b4 protects hamsters from severe disease and reduces viral titers following challenge with viral variants. These data suggest that a combination of BNT162b2 and BNT162b4 could reduce COVID-19 disease severity and duration caused by circulating or future variants. BNT162b4 is currently being clinically evaluated in combination with the BA.4/BA.5 Omicron-updated bivalent BNT162b2 (NCT05541861).

Abstract: Summary
Semliki Forest virus (SFV) is an alphavirus that uses the very-low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) as a receptor during infection of its vertebrate hosts and insect vectors. Herein, we used cryoelectron microscopy to study the structure of SFV in complex with VLDLR. We found that VLDLR binds multiple E1-DIII sites of SFV through its membrane-distal LDLR class A (LA) repeats. Among the LA repeats of the VLDLR, LA3 has the best binding affinity to SFV. The high-resolution structure shows that LA3 binds SFV E1-DIII through a small surface area of 378 Å2, with the main interactions at the interface involving salt bridges. Compared with the binding of single LA3s, consecutive LA repeats around LA3 promote synergistic binding to SFV, during which the LAs undergo a rotation, allowing simultaneous key interactions at multiple E1-DIII sites on the virion and enabling the binding of VLDLRs from divergent host species to SFV.

Abstract: Summary
Neural tube (NT) defects arise from abnormal neurulation and result in the most common birth defects worldwide. Yet, mechanisms of primate neurulation remain largely unknown due to prohibitions on human embryo research and limitations of available model systems. Here, we establish a three-dimensional (3D) prolonged in vitro culture (pIVC) system supporting cynomolgus monkey embryo development from 7 to 25 days post-fertilization. Through single-cell multi-omics analyses, we demonstrate that pIVC embryos form three germ layers, including primordial germ cells, and establish proper DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility through advanced gastrulation stages. In addition, pIVC embryo immunofluorescence confirms neural crest formation, NT closure, and neural progenitor regionalization. Finally, we demonstrate that the transcriptional profiles and morphogenetics of pIVC embryos resemble key features of similarly staged in vivo cynomolgus and human embryos. This work therefore describes a system to study non-human primate embryogenesis through advanced gastrulation and early neurulation.

Abstract: Summary
Cells respond to environmental cues by remodeling their inventories of multiprotein complexes. Cellular repertoires of SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F box protein) ubiquitin ligase complexes, which mediate much protein degradation, require CAND1 to distribute the limiting CUL1 subunit across the family of ∼70 different F box proteins. Yet, how a single factor coordinately assembles numerous distinct multiprotein complexes remains unknown. We obtained cryo-EM structures of CAND1-bound SCF complexes in multiple states and correlated mutational effects on structures, biochemistry, and cellular assays. The data suggest that CAND1 clasps idling catalytic domains of an inactive SCF, rolls around, and allosterically rocks and destabilizes the SCF. New SCF production proceeds in reverse, through SKP1-F box allosterically destabilizing CAND1. The CAND1-SCF conformational ensemble recycles CUL1 from inactive complexes, fueling mixing and matching of SCF parts for E3 activation in response to substrate availability. Our data reveal biogenesis of a predominant family of E3 ligases, and the molecular basis for systemwide multiprotein complex assembly.

Abstract: Summary
Receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) modulate the activity of many Family B GPCRs. We show that RAMP2 directly interacts with the glucagon receptor (GCGR), a Family B GPCR responsible for blood sugar homeostasis, and broadly inhibits receptor-induced downstream signaling. HDX-MS experiments demonstrate that RAMP2 enhances local flexibility in select locations in and near the receptor extracellular domain (ECD) and in the 6th transmembrane helix, whereas smFRET experiments show that this ECD disorder results in the inhibition of active and intermediate states of the intracellular surface. We determined the cryo-EM structure of the GCGR-Gs complex at 2.9 Å resolution in the presence of RAMP2. RAMP2 apparently does not interact with GCGR in an ordered manner; however, the receptor ECD is indeed largely disordered along with rearrangements of several intracellular hallmarks of activation. Our studies suggest that RAMP2 acts as a negative allosteric modulator of GCGR by enhancing conformational sampling of the ECD.

Abstract: Summary
The human brain undergoes rapid development at mid-gestation from a pool of neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) that give rise to the neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes of the mature brain. Functional study of these cell types has been hampered by a lack of precise purification methods. We describe a method for prospectively isolating ten distinct NSPC types from the developing human brain using cell-surface markers. CD24−THY1−/lo cells were enriched for radial glia, which robustly engrafted and differentiated into all three neural lineages in the mouse brain. THY1hi cells marked unipotent oligodendrocyte precursors committed to an oligodendroglial fate, and CD24+THY1−/lo cells marked committed excitatory and inhibitory neuronal lineages. Notably, we identify and functionally characterize a transcriptomically distinct THY1hiEGFRhiPDGFRA− bipotent glial progenitor cell (GPC), which is lineage-restricted to astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, but not to neurons. Our study provides a framework for the functional study of distinct cell types in human neurodevelopment.

Abstract: Summary
The emergence of the three germ layers and the lineage-specific precursor cells orchestrating organogenesis represent fundamental milestones during early embryonic development. We analyzed the transcriptional profiles of over 400,000 cells from 14 human samples collected from post-conceptional weeks (PCW) 3 to 12 to delineate the dynamic molecular and cellular landscape of early gastrulation and nervous system development. We described the diversification of cell types, the spatial patterning of neural tube cells, and the signaling pathways likely involved in transforming epiblast cells into neuroepithelial cells and then into radial glia. We resolved 24 clusters of radial glial cells along the neural tube and outlined differentiation trajectories for the main classes of neurons. Lastly, we identified conserved and distinctive features across species by comparing early embryonic single-cell transcriptomic profiles between humans and mice. This comprehensive atlas sheds light on the molecular mechanisms underlying gastrulation and early human brain development.

Abstract: Summary
Paired mapping of single-cell gene expression and electrophysiology is essential to understand gene-to-function relationships in electrogenic tissues. Here, we developed in situ electro-sequencing (electro-seq) that combines flexible bioelectronics with in situ RNA sequencing to stably map millisecond-timescale electrical activity and profile single-cell gene expression from the same cells across intact biological networks, including cardiac and neural patches. When applied to human-induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived cardiomyocyte patches, in situ electro-seq enabled multimodal in situ analysis of cardiomyocyte electrophysiology and gene expression at the cellular level, jointly defining cell states and developmental trajectories. Using machine-learning-based cross-modal analysis, in situ electro-seq identified gene-to-electrophysiology relationships throughout cardiomyocyte development and accurately reconstructed the evolution of gene expression profiles based on long-term stable electrical measurements. In situ electro-seq could be applicable to create spatiotemporal multimodal maps in electrogenic tissues, potentiating the discovery of cell types and gene programs responsible for electrophysiological function and dysfunction.

Abstract: Summary
Applications of prime editing are often limited due to insufficient efficiencies, and it can require substantial time and resources to determine the most efficient pegRNAs and prime editors (PEs) to generate a desired edit under various experimental conditions. Here, we evaluated prime editing efficiencies for a total of 338,996 pairs of pegRNAs including 3,979 epegRNAs and target sequences in an error-free manner. These datasets enabled a systematic determination of factors affecting prime editing efficiencies. Then, we developed computational models, named DeepPrime and DeepPrime-FT, that can predict prime editing efficiencies for eight prime editing systems in seven cell types for all possible types of editing of up to 3 base pairs. We also extensively profiled the prime editing efficiencies at mismatched targets and developed a computational model predicting editing efficiencies at such targets. These computational models, together with our improved knowledge about prime editing efficiency determinants, will greatly facilitate prime editing applications.

Abstract: Summary
Tissue repair responses in metazoans are highly coordinated by different cell types over space and time. However, comprehensive single-cell-based characterization covering this coordination is lacking. Here, we captured transcriptional states of single cells over space and time during skin wound closure, revealing choreographed gene-expression profiles. We identified shared space-time patterns of cellular and gene program enrichment, which we call multicellular “movements” spanning multiple cell types. We validated some of the discovered space-time movements using large-volume imaging of cleared wounds and demonstrated the value of this analysis to predict “sender” and “receiver” gene programs in macrophages and fibroblasts. Finally, we tested the hypothesis that tumors are like “wounds that never heal” and found conserved wound healing movements in mouse melanoma and colorectal tumor models, as well as human tumor samples, revealing fundamental multicellular units of tissue biology for integrative studies.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the origin of pancreatic β cells has profound implications for regenerative therapies in diabetes. For over a century, it was widely held that adult pancreatic duct cells act as endocrine progenitors, but lineage-tracing experiments challenged this dogma. Gribben et al. recently used two existing lineage-tracing models and single-cell RNA sequencing to conclude that adult pancreatic ducts contain endocrine progenitors that differentiate to insulin-expressing β cells at a physiologically important rate. We now offer an alternative interpretation of these experiments. Our data indicate that the two Cre lines that were used directly label adult islet somatostatin-producing ∂ cells, which precludes their use to assess whether β cells originate from duct cells. Furthermore, many labeled ∂ cells, which have an elongated neuron-like shape, were likely misclassified as β cells because insulin-somatostatin coimmunolocalizations were not used. We conclude that most evidence so far indicates that endocrine and exocrine lineage borders are rarely crossed in the adult pancreas.

Abstract: Summary
Suppressing sensory arousal is critical for sleep, with deeper sleep requiring stronger sensory suppression. The mechanisms that enable sleeping animals to largely ignore their surroundings are not well understood. We show that the responsiveness of sleeping flies and mice to mechanical vibrations is better suppressed when the diet is protein rich. In flies, we describe a signaling pathway through which information about ingested proteins is conveyed from the gut to the brain to help suppress arousability. Higher protein concentration in the gut leads to increased activity of enteroendocrine cells that release the peptide CCHa1. CCHa1 signals to a small group of dopamine neurons in the brain to modulate their activity; the dopaminergic activity regulates the behavioral responsiveness of animals to vibrations. The CCHa1 pathway and dietary proteins do not influence responsiveness to all sensory inputs, showing that during sleep, different information streams can be gated through independent mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
Holistic understanding of physio-pathological processes requires noninvasive 3D imaging in deep tissue across multiple spatial and temporal scales to link diverse transient subcellular behaviors with long-term physiogenesis. Despite broad applications of two-photon microscopy (TPM), there remains an inevitable tradeoff among spatiotemporal resolution, imaging volumes, and durations due to the point-scanning scheme, accumulated phototoxicity, and optical aberrations. Here, we harnessed the concept of synthetic aperture radar in TPM to achieve aberration-corrected 3D imaging of subcellular dynamics at a millisecond scale for over 100,000 large volumes in deep tissue, with three orders of magnitude reduction in photobleaching. With its advantages, we identified direct intercellular communications through migrasome generation following traumatic brain injury, visualized the formation process of germinal center in the mouse lymph node, and characterized heterogeneous cellular states in the mouse visual cortex, opening up a horizon for intravital imaging to understand the organizations and functions of biological systems at a holistic level.

Abstract: Summary
Stressed plants show altered phenotypes, including changes in color, smell, and shape. Yet, airborne sounds emitted by stressed plants have not been investigated before. Here we show that stressed plants emit airborne sounds that can be recorded from a distance and classified. We recorded ultrasonic sounds emitted by tomato and tobacco plants inside an acoustic chamber, and in a greenhouse, while monitoring the plant’s physiological parameters. We developed machine learning models that succeeded in identifying the condition of the plants, including dehydration level and injury, based solely on the emitted sounds. These informative sounds may also be detectable by other organisms. This work opens avenues for understanding plants and their interactions with the environment and may have significant impact on agriculture.

Abstract: Summary
Neutrophils accumulate in solid tumors, and their abundance correlates with poor prognosis. Neutrophils are not homogeneous, however, and could play different roles in cancer therapy. Here, we investigate the role of neutrophils in immunotherapy, leading to tumor control. We show that successful therapies acutely expanded tumor neutrophil numbers. This expansion could be attributed to a Sellhi state rather than to other neutrophils that accelerate tumor progression. Therapy-elicited neutrophils acquired an interferon gene signature, also seen in human patients, and appeared essential for successful therapy, as loss of the interferon-responsive transcription factor IRF1 in neutrophils led to failure of immunotherapy. The neutrophil response depended on key components of anti-tumor immunity, including BATF3-dependent DCs, IL-12, and IFNγ. In addition, we found that a therapy-elicited systemic neutrophil response positively correlated with disease outcome in lung cancer patients. Thus, we establish a crucial role of a neutrophil state in mediating effective cancer therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Somatic hypermutation (SHM), initiated by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), generates mutations in the antibody-coding sequence to allow affinity maturation. Why these mutations intrinsically focus on the three nonconsecutive complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) remains enigmatic. Here, we found that predisposition mutagenesis depends on the single-strand (ss) DNA substrate flexibility determined by the mesoscale sequence surrounding AID deaminase motifs. Mesoscale DNA sequences containing flexible pyrimidine-pyrimidine bases bind effectively to the positively charged surface patches of AID, resulting in preferential deamination activities. The CDR hypermutability is mimicable in in vitro deaminase assays and is evolutionarily conserved among species using SHM as a major diversification strategy. We demonstrated that mesoscale sequence alterations tune the in vivo mutability and promote mutations in an otherwise cold region in mice. Our results show a non-coding role of antibody-coding sequence in directing hypermutation, paving the way for the synthetic design of humanized animal models for optimal antibody discovery and explaining the AID mutagenesis pattern in lymphoma.

Abstract: Summary
We conduct high coverage (>30×) whole-genome sequencing of 180 individuals from 12 indigenous African populations. We identify millions of unreported variants, many predicted to be functionally important. We observe that the ancestors of southern African San and central African rainforest hunter-gatherers (RHG) diverged from other populations >200 kya and maintained a large effective population size. We observe evidence for ancient population structure in Africa and for multiple introgression events from “ghost” populations with highly diverged genetic lineages. Although currently geographically isolated, we observe evidence for gene flow between eastern and southern Khoesan-speaking hunter-gatherer populations lasting until ∼12 kya. We identify signatures of local adaptation for traits related to skin color, immune response, height, and metabolic processes. We identify a positively selected variant in the lightly pigmented San that influences pigmentation in vitro by regulating the enhancer activity and gene expression of PDPK1.

Abstract: Summary
The generation of distinct messenger RNA isoforms through alternative RNA processing modulates the expression and function of genes, often in a cell-type-specific manner. Here, we assess the regulatory relationships between transcription initiation, alternative splicing, and 3′ end site selection. Applying long-read sequencing to accurately represent even the longest transcripts from end to end, we quantify mRNA isoforms in Drosophila tissues, including the transcriptionally complex nervous system. We find that in Drosophila heads, as well as in human cerebral organoids, 3′ end site choice is globally influenced by the site of transcription initiation (TSS). “Dominant promoters,” characterized by specific epigenetic signatures including p300/CBP binding, impose a transcriptional constraint to define splice and polyadenylation variants. In vivo deletion or overexpression of dominant promoters as well as p300/CBP loss disrupted the 3′ end expression landscape. Our study demonstrates the crucial impact of TSS choice on the regulation of transcript diversity and tissue identity.

Abstract: Summary
A generalizable strategy with programmable site specificity for in situ profiling of histone modifications on unperturbed chromatin remains highly desirable but challenging. We herein developed a single-site-resolved multi-omics (SiTomics) strategy for systematic mapping of dynamic modifications and subsequent profiling of chromatinized proteome and genome defined by specific chromatin acylations in living cells. By leveraging the genetic code expansion strategy, our SiTomics toolkit revealed distinct crotonylation (e.g., H3K56cr) and β-hydroxybutyrylation (e.g., H3K56bhb) upon short chain fatty acids stimulation and established linkages for chromatin acylation mark-defined proteome, genome, and functions. This led to the identification of GLYR1 as a distinct interacting protein in modulating H3K56cr′s gene body localization as well as the discovery of an elevated super-enhancer repertoire underlying bhb-mediated chromatin modulations. SiTomics offers a platform technology for elucidating the “metabolites-modification-regulation” axis, which is widely applicable for multi-omics profiling and functional dissection of modifications beyond acylations and proteins beyond histones.

Abstract: Summary
A fundamental strategy of eukaryotic antiviral immunity involves the cGAS enzyme, which synthesizes 2′,3′-cGAMP and activates the effector STING. Diverse bacteria contain cGAS-like enzymes that produce cyclic oligonucleotides and induce anti-phage activity, known as CBASS. However, this activity has only been demonstrated through heterologous expression. Whether bacteria harboring CBASS antagonize and co-evolve with phages is unknown. Here, we identified an endogenous cGAS-like enzyme in Pseudomonas aeruginosa that generates 3′,3′-cGAMP during phage infection, signals to a phospholipase effector, and limits phage replication. In response, phages express an anti-CBASS protein (“Acb2”) that forms a hexamer with three 3′,3′-cGAMP molecules and reduces phospholipase activity. Acb2 also binds to molecules produced by other bacterial cGAS-like enzymes (3',3'-cUU/UA/UG/AA) and mammalian cGAS (2′,3′-cGAMP), suggesting broad inhibition of cGAS-based immunity. Upon Acb2 deletion, CBASS blocks lytic phage replication and lysogenic induction, but rare phages evade CBASS through major capsid gene mutations. Altogether, we demonstrate endogenous CBASS anti-phage function and strategies of CBASS inhibition and evasion.

Abstract: Summary
Senescent cell accumulation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of aging-associated diseases, including cancer. The mechanism that prevents the accumulation of senescent cells in aging human organs is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that a virus-immune axis controls the senescent fibroblast accumulation in the human skin. Senescent fibroblasts increased in old skin compared with young skin. However, they did not increase with advancing age in the elderly. Increased CXCL9 and cytotoxic CD4+ T cells (CD4 CTLs) recruitment were significantly associated with reduced senescent fibroblasts in the old skin. Senescent fibroblasts expressed human leukocyte antigen class II (HLA-II) and human cytomegalovirus glycoprotein B (HCMV-gB), becoming direct CD4 CTL targets. Skin-resident CD4 CTLs eliminated HCMV-gB+ senescent fibroblasts in an HLA-II-dependent manner, and HCMV-gB activated CD4 CTLs from the human skin. Collectively, our findings demonstrate HCMV reactivation in senescent cells, which CD4 CTLs can directly eliminate through the recognition of the HCMV-gB antigen.

Abstract: Summary
Systemic candidiasis is a common, high-mortality, nosocomial fungal infection. Unexpectedly, it has emerged as a complication of anti-complement C5-targeted monoclonal antibody treatment, indicating a critical niche for C5 in antifungal immunity. We identified transcription of complement system genes as the top biological pathway induced in candidemic patients and as predictive of candidemia. Mechanistically, C5a-C5aR1 promoted fungal clearance and host survival in a mouse model of systemic candidiasis by stimulating phagocyte effector function and ERK- and AKT-dependent survival in infected tissues. C5ar1 ablation rewired macrophage metabolism downstream of mTOR, promoting their apoptosis and enhancing mortality through kidney injury. Besides hepatocyte-derived C5, local C5 produced intrinsically by phagocytes provided a key substrate for antifungal protection. Lower serum C5a concentrations or a C5 polymorphism that decreases leukocyte C5 expression correlated independently with poor patient outcomes. Thus, local, phagocyte-derived C5 production licenses phagocyte antimicrobial function and confers innate protection during systemic fungal infection.

Abstract: Summary
Signals from the surrounding niche drive proliferation and suppress differentiation of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) at the bottom of intestinal crypts. Among sub-epithelial support cells, deep sub-cryptal CD81+ PDGFRAlo trophocytes capably sustain ISC functions ex vivo. Here, we show that mRNA and chromatin profiles of abundant CD81− PDGFRAlo mouse stromal cells resemble those of trophocytes and that both populations provide crucial canonical Wnt ligands. Mesenchymal expression of key ISC-supportive factors extends along a spatial and molecular continuum from trophocytes into peri-cryptal CD81− CD55hi cells, which mimic trophocyte activity in organoid co-cultures. Graded expression of essential niche factors is not cell-autonomous but dictated by the distance from bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-secreting PDGFRAhi myofibroblast aggregates. BMP signaling inhibits ISC-trophic genes in PDGFRAlo cells near high crypt tiers; that suppression is relieved in stromal cells near and below the crypt base, including trophocytes. Cell distances thus underlie a self-organized and polar ISC niche.

Abstract: Summary
Germline histone H3.3 amino acid substitutions, including H3.3G34R/V, cause severe neurodevelopmental syndromes. To understand how these mutations impact brain development, we generated H3.3G34R/V/W knock-in mice and identified strikingly distinct developmental defects for each mutation. H3.3G34R-mutants exhibited progressive microcephaly and neurodegeneration, with abnormal accumulation of disease-associated microglia and concurrent neuronal depletion. G34R severely decreased H3K36me2 on the mutant H3.3 tail, impairing recruitment of DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A and its redistribution on chromatin. These changes were concurrent with sustained expression of complement and other innate immune genes possibly through loss of non-CG (CH) methylation and silencing of neuronal gene promoters through aberrant CG methylation. Complement expression in G34R brains may lead to neuroinflammation possibly accounting for progressive neurodegeneration. Our study reveals that H3.3G34-substitutions have differential impact on the epigenome, which underlie the diverse phenotypes observed, and uncovers potential roles for H3K36me2 and DNMT3A-dependent CH-methylation in modulating synaptic pruning and neuroinflammation in post-natal brains.

Abstract: Summary
Cortical circuits are composed predominantly of pyramidal-to-pyramidal neuron connections, yet their assembly during embryonic development is not well understood. We show that mouse embryonic Rbp4-Cre cortical neurons, transcriptomically closest to layer 5 pyramidal neurons, display two phases of circuit assembly in vivo. At E14.5, they form a multi-layered circuit motif, composed of only embryonic near-projecting-type neurons. By E17.5, this transitions to a second motif involving all three embryonic types, analogous to the three adult layer 5 types. In vivo patch clamp recordings and two-photon calcium imaging of embryonic Rbp4-Cre neurons reveal active somas and neurites, tetrodotoxin-sensitive voltage-gated conductances, and functional glutamatergic synapses, from E14.5 onwards. Embryonic Rbp4-Cre neurons strongly express autism-associated genes and perturbing these genes interferes with the switch between the two motifs. Hence, pyramidal neurons form active, transient, multi-layered pyramidal-to-pyramidal circuits at the inception of neocortex, and studying these circuits could yield insights into the etiology of autism.

Abstract: Summary
Exercise has the ability to rejuvenate stem cells and improve tissue regeneration in aging animals. However, the cellular and molecular changes elicited by exercise have not been systematically studied across a broad range of cell types in stem cell compartments. We subjected young and old mice to aerobic exercise and generated a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of muscle, neural, and hematopoietic stem cells with their niche cells and progeny, complemented by whole transcriptome analysis of single myofibers. We found that exercise ameliorated the upregulation of a number of inflammatory pathways associated with old age and restored aspects of intercellular communication mediated by immune cells within these stem cell compartments. Exercise has a profound impact on the composition and transcriptomic landscape of circulating and tissue-resident immune cells. Our study provides a comprehensive view of the coordinated responses of multiple aged stem cells and niche cells to exercise at the transcriptomic level.

Abstract: Summary
Human genome variation contributes to diversity in neurodevelopmental outcomes and vulnerabilities; recognizing the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms will require scalable approaches. Here, we describe a “cell village” experimental platform we used to analyze genetic, molecular, and phenotypic heterogeneity across neural progenitor cells from 44 human donors cultured in a shared in vitro environment using algorithms (Dropulation and Census-seq) to assign cells and phenotypes to individual donors. Through rapid induction of human stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells, measurements of natural genetic variation, and CRISPR-Cas9 genetic perturbations, we identified a common variant that regulates antiviral IFITM3 expression and explains most inter-individual variation in susceptibility to the Zika virus. We also detected expression QTLs corresponding to GWAS loci for brain traits and discovered novel disease-relevant regulators of progenitor proliferation and differentiation such as CACHD1. This approach provides scalable ways to elucidate the effects of genes and genetic variation on cellular phenotypes.

Abstract: Summary
Fingerprints are complex and individually unique patterns in the skin. Established prenatally, the molecular and cellular mechanisms that guide fingerprint ridge formation and their intricate arrangements are unknown. Here we show that fingerprint ridges are epithelial structures that undergo a truncated hair follicle developmental program and fail to recruit a mesenchymal condensate. Their spatial pattern is established by a Turing reaction-diffusion system, based on signaling between EDAR, WNT, and antagonistic BMP pathways. These signals resolve epithelial growth into bands of focalized proliferation under a precociously differentiated suprabasal layer. Ridge formation occurs as a set of waves spreading from variable initiation sites defined by the local signaling environments and anatomical intricacies of the digit, with the propagation and meeting of these waves determining the type of pattern that forms. Relying on a dynamic patterning system triggered at spatially distinct sites generates the characteristic types and unending variation of human fingerprint patterns.

Abstract: Summary
Somatic mutations in nonmalignant tissues accumulate with age and injury, but whether these mutations are adaptive on the cellular or organismal levels is unclear. To interrogate genes in human metabolic disease, we performed lineage tracing in mice harboring somatic mosaicism subjected to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Proof-of-concept studies with mosaic loss of Mboat7, a membrane lipid acyltransferase, showed that increased steatosis accelerated clonal disappearance. Next, we induced pooled mosaicism in 63 known NASH genes, allowing us to trace mutant clones side by side. This in vivo tracing platform, which we coined MOSAICS, selected for mutations that ameliorate lipotoxicity, including mutant genes identified in human NASH. To prioritize new genes, additional screening of 472 candidates identified 23 somatic perturbations that promoted clonal expansion. In validation studies, liver-wide deletion of Tbx3, Bcl6, or Smyd2 resulted in protection against hepatic steatosis. Selection for clonal fitness in mouse and human livers identifies pathways that regulate metabolic disease.

Abstract: Summary
Pathogen infection and tissue injury are universal insults that disrupt homeostasis. Innate immunity senses microbial infections and induces cytokines/chemokines to activate resistance mechanisms. Here, we show that, in contrast to most pathogen-induced cytokines, interleukin-24 (IL-24) is predominately induced by barrier epithelial progenitors after tissue injury and is independent of microbiome or adaptive immunity. Moreover, Il24 ablation in mice impedes not only epidermal proliferation and re-epithelialization but also capillary and fibroblast regeneration within the dermal wound bed. Conversely, ectopic IL-24 induction in the homeostatic epidermis triggers global epithelial-mesenchymal tissue repair responses. Mechanistically, Il24 expression depends upon both epithelial IL24-receptor/STAT3 signaling and hypoxia-stabilized HIF1α, which converge following injury to trigger autocrine and paracrine signaling involving IL-24-mediated receptor signaling and metabolic regulation. Thus, parallel to innate immune sensing of pathogens to resolve infections, epithelial stem cells sense injury signals to orchestrate IL-24-mediated tissue repair.

Abstract: Summary
The emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis has created an urgent need for new anti-tubercular agents. Here, we report the discovery of a series of macrolides called sequanamycins with outstanding in vitro and in vivo activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Sequanamycins are bacterial ribosome inhibitors that interact with the ribosome in a similar manner to classic macrolides like erythromycin and clarithromycin, but with binding characteristics that allow them to overcome the inherent macrolide resistance of Mtb. Structures of the ribosome with bound inhibitors were used to optimize sequanamycin to produce the advanced lead compound SEQ-9. SEQ-9 was efficacious in mouse models of acute and chronic TB as a single agent, and it demonstrated bactericidal activity in a murine TB infection model in combination with other TB drugs. These results support further investigation of this series as TB clinical candidates, with the potential for use in new regimens against drug-susceptible and drug-resistant TB.

Abstract: Summary
A functional network of blood vessels is essential for organ growth and homeostasis, yet how the vasculature matures and maintains homeostasis remains elusive in live mice. By longitudinally tracking the same neonatal endothelial cells (ECs) over days to weeks, we found that capillary plexus expansion is driven by vessel regression to optimize network perfusion. Neonatal ECs rearrange positions to evenly distribute throughout the developing plexus and become positionally stable in adulthood. Upon local ablation, adult ECs survive through a plasmalemmal self-repair response, while neonatal ECs are predisposed to die. Furthermore, adult ECs reactivate migration to assist vessel repair. Global ablation reveals coordinated maintenance of the adult vascular architecture that allows for eventual network recovery. Lastly, neonatal remodeling and adult maintenance of the skin vascular plexus are orchestrated by temporally restricted, neonatal VEGFR2 signaling. Our work sheds light on fundamental mechanisms that underlie both vascular maturation and adult homeostasis in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
CD3δ SCID is a devastating inborn error of immunity caused by mutations in CD3D, encoding the invariant CD3δ chain of the CD3/TCR complex necessary for normal thymopoiesis. We demonstrate an adenine base editing (ABE) strategy to restore CD3δ in autologous hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Delivery of mRNA encoding a laboratory-evolved ABE and guide RNA into a CD3δ SCID patient’s HSPCs resulted in a 71.2% ± 7.85% (n = 3) correction of the pathogenic mutation. Edited HSPCs differentiated in artificial thymic organoids produced mature T cells exhibiting diverse TCR repertoires and TCR-dependent functions. Edited human HSPCs transplanted into immunodeficient mice showed 88% reversion of the CD3D defect in human CD34+ cells isolated from mouse bone marrow after 16 weeks, indicating correction of long-term repopulating HSCs. These findings demonstrate the preclinical efficacy of ABE in HSPCs for the treatment of CD3δ SCID, providing a foundation for the development of a one-time treatment for CD3δ SCID patients.

Abstract: Summary
Seemingly simple behaviors such as swatting a mosquito or glancing at a signpost involve the precise coordination of multiple body parts. Neural control of coordinated movements is widely thought to entail transforming a desired overall displacement into displacements for each body part. Here we reveal a different logic implemented in the mouse gaze system. Stimulating superior colliculus (SC) elicits head movements with stereotyped displacements but eye movements with stereotyped endpoints. This is achieved by individual SC neurons whose branched axons innervate modules in medulla and pons that drive head movements with stereotyped displacements and eye movements with stereotyped endpoints, respectively. Thus, single neurons specify a mixture of endpoints and displacements for different body parts, not overall displacement, with displacements for different body parts computed at distinct anatomical stages. Our study establishes an approach for unraveling motor hierarchies and identifies a logic for coordinating movements and the resulting pose.

Abstract: Summary
Germinal centers (GCs) that form within lymphoid follicles during antibody responses are sites of massive cell death. Tingible body macrophages (TBMs) are tasked with apoptotic cell clearance to prevent secondary necrosis and autoimmune activation by intracellular self antigens. We show by multiple redundant and complementary methods that TBMs derive from a lymph node-resident, CD169-lineage, CSF1R-blockade-resistant precursor that is prepositioned in the follicle. Non-migratory TBMs use cytoplasmic processes to chase and capture migrating dead cell fragments using a “lazy” search strategy. Follicular macrophages activated by the presence of nearby apoptotic cells can mature into TBMs in the absence of GCs. Single-cell transcriptomics identified a TBM cell cluster in immunized lymph nodes which upregulated genes involved in apoptotic cell clearance. Thus, apoptotic B cells in early GCs trigger activation and maturation of follicular macrophages into classical TBMs to clear apoptotic debris and prevent antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The cell lineages across developmental stages remain to be elucidated. Here, we developed single-cell split barcoding (SISBAR) that allows clonal tracking of single-cell transcriptomes across stages in an in vitro model of human ventral midbrain-hindbrain differentiation. We developed “potential-spective” and “origin-spective” analyses to investigate the cross-stage lineage relationships and mapped a multi-level clonal lineage landscape depicting the whole differentiation process. We uncovered many previously uncharacterized converging and diverging trajectories. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a transcriptome-defined cell type can arise from distinct lineages that leave molecular imprints on their progenies, and the multilineage fates of a progenitor cell-type represent the collective results of distinct rather than similar clonal fates of individual progenitors, each with distinct molecular signatures. Specifically, we uncovered a ventral midbrain progenitor cluster as the common clonal origin of midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons, midbrain glutamatergic neurons, and vascular and leptomeningeal cells and identified a surface marker that can improve graft outcomes.

Abstract: Summary
Comparative studies of great apes provide a window into our evolutionary past, but the extent and identity of cellular differences that emerged during hominin evolution remain largely unexplored. We established a comparative loss-of-function approach to evaluate whether human cells exhibit distinct genetic dependencies. By performing genome-wide CRISPR interference screens in human and chimpanzee pluripotent stem cells, we identified 75 genes with species-specific effects on cellular proliferation. These genes comprised coherent processes, including cell-cycle progression and lysosomal signaling, which we determined to be human-derived by comparison with orangutan cells. Human-specific robustness to CDK2 and CCNE1 depletion persisted in neural progenitor cells and cerebral organoids, supporting the G1-phase length hypothesis as a potential evolutionary mechanism in human brain expansion. Our findings demonstrate that evolutionary changes in human cells reshaped the landscape of essential genes and establish a platform for systematically uncovering latent cellular and molecular differences between species.

Abstract: Summary
Multiple anticancer drugs have been proposed to cause cell death, in part, by increasing the steady-state levels of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, for most of these drugs, exactly how the resultant ROS function and are sensed is poorly understood. It remains unclear which proteins the ROS modify and their roles in drug sensitivity/resistance. To answer these questions, we examined 11 anticancer drugs with an integrated proteogenomic approach identifying not only many unique targets but also shared ones—including ribosomal components, suggesting common mechanisms by which drugs regulate translation. We focus on CHK1 that we find is a nuclear H2O2 sensor that launches a cellular program to dampen ROS. CHK1 phosphorylates the mitochondrial DNA-binding protein SSBP1 to prevent its mitochondrial localization, which in turn decreases nuclear H2O2. Our results reveal a druggable nucleus-to-mitochondria ROS-sensing pathway—required to resolve nuclear H2O2 accumulation and mediate resistance to platinum-based agents in ovarian cancers.

Biofilm formation is generally recognized as a bacterial defense mechanism against environmental threats, including antibiotics, bacteriophages, and leukocytes of the human immune system. Here, we show that for the human pathogen Vibrio cholerae, biofilm formation is not only a protective trait but also an aggressive trait to collectively predate different immune cells. We find that V. cholerae forms biofilms on the eukaryotic cell surface using an extracellular matrix comprising primarily mannose-sensitive hemagglutinin pili, toxin-coregulated pili, and the secreted colonization factor TcpF, which differs from the matrix composition of biofilms on other surfaces. These biofilms encase immune cells and establish a high local concentration of a secreted hemolysin to kill the immune cells before the biofilms disperse in a c-di-GMP-dependent manner. Together, these results uncover how bacteria employ biofilm formation as a multicellular strategy to invert the typical relationship between human immune cells as the hunters and bacteria as the hunted.

Abstract: Summary
Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is Earth’s most abundant wild animal, and its enormous biomass is vital to the Southern Ocean ecosystem. Here, we report a 48.01-Gb chromosome-level Antarctic krill genome, whose large genome size appears to have resulted from inter-genic transposable element expansions. Our assembly reveals the molecular architecture of the Antarctic krill circadian clock and uncovers expanded gene families associated with molting and energy metabolism, providing insights into adaptations to the cold and highly seasonal Antarctic environment. Population-level genome re-sequencing from four geographical sites around the Antarctic continent reveals no clear population structure but highlights natural selection associated with environmental variables. An apparent drastic reduction in krill population size 10 mya and a subsequent rebound 100 thousand years ago coincides with climate change events. Our findings uncover the genomic basis of Antarctic krill adaptations to the Southern Ocean and provide valuable resources for future Antarctic research.

Abstract: Summary
The serotonin transporter (SERT) removes synaptic serotonin and is the target of anti-depressant drugs. SERT adopts three conformations: outward-open, occluded, and inward-open. All known inhibitors target the outward-open state except ibogaine, which has unusual anti-depressant and substance-withdrawal effects, and stabilizes the inward-open conformation. Unfortunately, ibogaine’s promiscuity and cardiotoxicity limit the understanding of inward-open state ligands. We docked over 200 million small molecules against the inward-open state of the SERT. Thirty-six top-ranking compounds were synthesized, and thirteen inhibited; further structure-based optimization led to the selection of two potent (low nanomolar) inhibitors. These stabilized an outward-closed state of the SERT with little activity against common off-targets. A cryo-EM structure of one of these bound to the SERT confirmed the predicted geometry. In mouse behavioral assays, both compounds had anxiolytic- and anti-depressant-like activity, with potencies up to 200-fold better than fluoxetine (Prozac), and one substantially reversed morphine withdrawal effects.

Abstract: Summary
Ribonuclease HII (RNaseHII) is the principal enzyme that removes misincorporated ribonucleoside monophosphates (rNMPs) from genomic DNA. Here, we present structural, biochemical, and genetic evidence demonstrating that ribonucleotide excision repair (RER) is directly coupled to transcription. Affinity pull-downs and mass-spectrometry-assisted mapping of in cellulo inter-protein cross-linking reveal the majority of RNaseHII molecules interacting with RNA polymerase (RNAP) in E. coli. Cryoelectron microscopy structures of RNaseHII bound to RNAP during elongation, with and without the target rNMP substrate, show specific protein-protein interactions that define the transcription-coupled RER (TC-RER) complex in engaged and unengaged states. The weakening of RNAP-RNaseHII interactions compromises RER in vivo. The structure-functional data support a model where RNaseHII scans DNA in one dimension in search for rNMPs while “riding” the RNAP. We further demonstrate that TC-RER accounts for a significant fraction of repair events, thereby establishing RNAP as a surveillance “vehicle” for detecting the most frequently occurring replication errors.

Abstract: Summary
Serotonin influences many aspects of animal behavior. But how serotonin acts on its diverse receptors across the brain to modulate global activity and behavior is unknown. Here, we examine how serotonin release in C. elegans alters brain-wide activity to induce foraging behaviors, like slow locomotion and increased feeding. Comprehensive genetic analyses identify three core serotonin receptors (MOD-1, SER-4, and LGC-50) that induce slow locomotion upon serotonin release and others (SER-1, SER-5, and SER-7) that interact with them to modulate this behavior. SER-4 induces behavioral responses to sudden increases in serotonin release, whereas MOD-1 induces responses to persistent release. Whole-brain imaging reveals widespread serotonin-associated brain dynamics, spanning many behavioral networks. We map all sites of serotonin receptor expression in the connectome, which, together with synaptic connectivity, helps predict which neurons show serotonin-associated activity. These results reveal how serotonin acts at defined sites across a connectome to modulate brain-wide activity and behavior.

Abstract: Summary
Entry of enveloped viruses into cells is mediated by viral fusogenic proteins that drive membrane rearrangements needed for fusion between viral and target membranes. Skeletal muscle development also requires membrane fusion events between progenitor cells to form multinucleated myofibers. Myomaker and Myomerger are muscle-specific cell fusogens but do not structurally or functionally resemble classical viral fusogens. We asked whether the muscle fusogens could functionally substitute for viral fusogens, despite their structural distinctiveness, and fuse viruses to cells. We report that engineering of Myomaker and Myomerger on the membrane of enveloped viruses leads to specific transduction of skeletal muscle. We also demonstrate that locally and systemically injected virions pseudotyped with the muscle fusogens can deliver μDystrophin to skeletal muscle of a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and alleviate pathology. Through harnessing the intrinsic properties of myogenic membranes, we establish a platform for delivery of therapeutic material to skeletal muscle.

Abstract: Summary
Retroelements are the widespread jumping elements considered as major drivers for genome evolution, which can also be repurposed as gene-editing tools. Here, we determine the cryo-EM structures of eukaryotic R2 retrotransposon with ribosomal DNA target and regulatory RNAs. Combined with biochemical and sequencing analysis, we reveal two essential DNA regions, Drr and Dcr, required for recognition and cleavage. The association of 3′ regulatory RNA with R2 protein accelerates the first-strand cleavage, blocks the second-strand cleavage, and initiates the reverse transcription starting from the 3′-tail. Removing 3′ regulatory RNA by reverse transcription allows the association of 5′ regulatory RNA and initiates the second-strand cleavage. Taken together, our work explains the DNA recognition and RNA supervised sequential retrotransposition mechanisms by R2 machinery, providing insights into the retrotransposon and application reprogramming.

Abstract: Summary
CDK2 is a core cell-cycle kinase that phosphorylates many substrates to drive progression through the cell cycle. CDK2 is hyperactivated in multiple cancers and is therefore an attractive therapeutic target. Here, we use several CDK2 inhibitors in clinical development to interrogate CDK2 substrate phosphorylation, cell-cycle progression, and drug adaptation in preclinical models. Whereas CDK1 is known to compensate for loss of CDK2 in Cdk2−/− mice, this is not true of acute inhibition of CDK2. Upon CDK2 inhibition, cells exhibit a rapid loss of substrate phosphorylation that rebounds within several hours. CDK4/6 activity backstops inhibition of CDK2 and sustains the proliferative program by maintaining Rb1 hyperphosphorylation, active E2F transcription, and cyclin A2 expression, enabling re-activation of CDK2 in the presence of drug. Our results augment our understanding of CDK plasticity and indicate that co-inhibition of CDK2 and CDK4/6 may be required to suppress adaptation to CDK2 inhibitors currently under clinical assessment.

Abstract: Summary
Gastruloids are 3D structures generated from pluripotent stem cells recapitulating fundamental principles of embryonic pattern formation. Using single-cell genomic analysis, we provide a resource mapping cell states and types during gastruloid development and compare them with the in vivo embryo. We developed a high-throughput handling and imaging pipeline to spatially monitor symmetry breaking during gastruloid development and report an early spatial variability in pluripotency determining a binary response to Wnt activation. Although cells in the gastruloid-core revert to pluripotency, peripheral cells become primitive streak-like. These two populations subsequently break radial symmetry and initiate axial elongation. By performing a compound screen, perturbing thousands of gastruloids, we derive a phenotypic landscape and infer networks of genetic interactions. Finally, using a dual Wnt modulation, we improve the formation of anterior structures in the existing gastruloid model. This work provides a resource to understand how gastruloids develop and generate complex patterns in vitro.

Abstract: Summary
Bacteria use a wide range of immune pathways to counter phage infection. A subset of these genes shares homology with components of eukaryotic immune systems, suggesting that eukaryotes horizontally acquired certain innate immune genes from bacteria. Here, we show that proteins containing a NACHT module, the central feature of the animal nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing gene family (NLRs), are found in bacteria and defend against phages. NACHT proteins are widespread in bacteria, provide immunity against both DNA and RNA phages, and display the characteristic C-terminal sensor, central NACHT, and N-terminal effector modules. Some bacterial NACHT proteins have domain architectures similar to the human NLRs that are critical components of inflammasomes. Human disease-associated NLR mutations that cause stimulus-independent activation of the inflammasome also activate bacterial NACHT proteins, supporting a shared signaling mechanism. This work establishes that NACHT module-containing proteins are ancient mediators of innate immunity across the tree of life.

Abstract: Summary
CD8+ T cell responses are critical for anti-tumor immunity. While extensively profiled in the tumor microenvironment, recent studies in mice identified responses in lymph nodes (LNs) as essential; however, the role of LNs in human cancer patients remains unknown. We examined CD8+ T cells in human head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, regional LNs, and blood using mass cytometry, single-cell genomics, and multiplexed ion beam imaging. We identified progenitor exhausted CD8+ T cells (Tpex) that were abundant in uninvolved LN and clonally related to terminally exhausted cells in the tumor. After anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy, Tpex in uninvolved LNs reduced in frequency but localized near dendritic cells and proliferating intermediate-exhausted CD8+ T cells (Tex-int), consistent with activation and differentiation. LN responses coincided with increased circulating Tex-int. In metastatic LNs, these response hallmarks were impaired, with immunosuppressive cellular niches. Our results identify important roles for LNs in anti-tumor immune responses in humans.

Abstract: Summary
In prokaryotes, translation can occur on mRNA that is being transcribed in a process called coupling. How the ribosome affects the RNA polymerase (RNAP) during coupling is not well understood. Here, we reconstituted the E. coli coupling system and demonstrated that the ribosome can prevent pausing and termination of RNAP and double the overall transcription rate at the expense of fidelity. Moreover, we monitored single RNAPs coupled to ribosomes and show that coupling increases the pause-free velocity of the polymerase and that a mechanical assisting force is sufficient to explain the majority of the effects of coupling. Also, by cryo-EM, we observed that RNAPs with a terminal mismatch adopt a backtracked conformation, while a coupled ribosome allosterically induces these polymerases toward a catalytically active anti-swiveled state. Finally, we demonstrate that prolonged RNAP pausing is detrimental to cell viability, which could be prevented by polymerase reactivation through a coupled ribosome.

Abstract: Summary
Mental health profoundly impacts inflammatory responses in the body. This is particularly apparent in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), in which psychological stress is associated with exacerbated disease flares. Here, we discover a critical role for the enteric nervous system (ENS) in mediating the aggravating effect of chronic stress on intestinal inflammation. We find that chronically elevated levels of glucocorticoids drive the generation of an inflammatory subset of enteric glia that promotes monocyte- and TNF-mediated inflammation via CSF1. Additionally, glucocorticoids cause transcriptional immaturity in enteric neurons, acetylcholine deficiency, and dysmotility via TGF-β2. We verify the connection between the psychological state, intestinal inflammation, and dysmotility in three cohorts of IBD patients. Together, these findings offer a mechanistic explanation for the impact of the brain on peripheral inflammation, define the ENS as a relay between psychological stress and gut inflammation, and suggest that stress management could serve as a valuable component of IBD care.

Abstract: Summary
Enabling and constraining immune activation is of fundamental importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Depleting BAK1 and SERK4, the co-receptors of multiple pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), abolishes pattern-triggered immunity but triggers intracellular NOD-like receptor (NLR)-mediated autoimmunity with an elusive mechanism. By deploying RNAi-based genetic screens in Arabidopsis, we identified BAK-TO-LIFE 2 (BTL2), an uncharacterized receptor kinase, sensing BAK1/SERK4 integrity. BTL2 induces autoimmunity through activating Ca2+ channel CNGC20 in a kinase-dependent manner when BAK1/SERK4 are perturbed. To compensate for BAK1 deficiency, BTL2 complexes with multiple phytocytokine receptors, leading to potent phytocytokine responses mediated by helper NLR ADR1 family immune receptors, suggesting phytocytokine signaling as a molecular link connecting PRR- and NLR-mediated immunity. Remarkably, BAK1 constrains BTL2 activation via specific phosphorylation to maintain cellular integrity. Thus, BTL2 serves as a surveillance rheostat sensing the perturbation of BAK1/SERK4 immune co-receptors in promoting NLR-mediated phytocytokine signaling to ensure plant immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Microglia are specialized brain-resident macrophages that play crucial roles in brain development, homeostasis, and disease. However, until now, the ability to model interactions between the human brain environment and microglia has been severely limited. To overcome these limitations, we developed an in vivo xenotransplantation approach that allows us to study functionally mature human microglia (hMGs) that operate within a physiologically relevant, vascularized immunocompetent human brain organoid (iHBO) model. Our data show that organoid-resident hMGs gain human-specific transcriptomic signatures that closely resemble their in vivo counterparts. In vivo two-photon imaging reveals that hMGs actively engage in surveilling the human brain environment, react to local injuries, and respond to systemic inflammatory cues. Finally, we demonstrate that the transplanted iHBOs developed here offer the unprecedented opportunity to study functional human microglia phenotypes in health and disease and provide experimental evidence for a brain-environment-induced immune response in a patient-specific model of autism with macrocephaly.

Abstract: Summary
Aneuploidy, the presence of chromosome gains or losses, is a hallmark of cancer. Here, we describe KaryoCreate (karyotype CRISPR-engineered aneuploidy technology), a system that enables the generation of chromosome-specific aneuploidies by co-expression of an sgRNA targeting chromosome-specific CENPA-binding ɑ-satellite repeats together with dCas9 fused to mutant KNL1. We design unique and highly specific sgRNAs for 19 of the 24 chromosomes. Expression of these constructs leads to missegregation and induction of gains or losses of the targeted chromosome in cellular progeny, with an average efficiency of 8% for gains and 12% for losses (up to 20%) validated across 10 chromosomes. Using KaryoCreate in colon epithelial cells, we show that chromosome 18q loss, frequent in gastrointestinal cancers, promotes resistance to TGF-β, likely due to synergistic hemizygous deletion of multiple genes. Altogether, we describe an innovative technology to create and study chromosome missegregation and aneuploidy in the context of cancer and beyond.

Abstract: Summary
Leaf-feeding insects trigger high-amplitude, defense-inducing electrical signals called slow wave potentials (SWPs). These signals are thought to be triggered by the long-distance transport of low molecular mass elicitors termed Ricca’s factors. We sought mediators of leaf-to-leaf electrical signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana and identified them as β-THIOGLUCOSIDE GLUCOHYDROLASE 1 and 2 (TGG1 and TGG2). SWP propagation from insect feeding sites was strongly attenuated in tgg1 tgg2 mutants and wound-response cytosolic Ca2+ increases were reduced in these plants. Recombinant TGG1 fed into the xylem elicited wild-type-like membrane depolarization and Ca2+ transients. Moreover, TGGs catalyze the deglucosidation of glucosinolates. Metabolite profiling revealed rapid wound-induced breakdown of aliphatic glucosinolates in primary veins. Using in vivo chemical trapping, we found evidence for roles of short-lived aglycone intermediates generated by glucosinolate hydrolysis in SWP membrane depolarization. Our findings reveal a mechanism whereby organ-to-organ protein transport plays a major role in electrical signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding clonal evolution and cancer development requires experimental approaches for characterizing the consequences of somatic mutations on gene regulation. However, no methods currently exist that efficiently link high-content chromatin accessibility with high-confidence genotyping in single cells. To address this, we developed Genotyping with the Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (GTAC), enabling accurate mutation detection at multiple amplified loci, coupled with robust chromatin accessibility readout. We applied GTAC to primary acute myeloid leukemia, obtaining high-quality chromatin accessibility profiles and clonal identities for multiple mutations in 88% of cells. We traced chromatin variation throughout clonal evolution, showing the restriction of different clones to distinct differentiation stages. Furthermore, we identified switches in transcription factor motif accessibility associated with a specific combination of driver mutations, which biased transformed progenitors toward a leukemia stem cell-like chromatin state. GTAC is a powerful tool to study clonal heterogeneity across a wide spectrum of pre-malignant and neoplastic conditions.

Abstract: Summary
The Alpha, Beta, and Gamma SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) co-circulated globally during 2020 and 2021, fueling waves of infections. They were displaced by Delta during a third wave worldwide in 2021, which, in turn, was displaced by Omicron in late 2021. In this study, we use phylogenetic and phylogeographic methods to reconstruct the dispersal patterns of VOCs worldwide. We find that source-sink dynamics varied substantially by VOC and identify countries that acted as global and regional hubs of dissemination. We demonstrate the declining role of presumed origin countries of VOCs in their global dispersal, estimating that India contributed <15% of Delta exports and South Africa <1%–2% of Omicron dispersal. We estimate that >80 countries had received introductions of Omicron within 100 days of its emergence, associated with accelerated passenger air travel and higher transmissibility. Our study highlights the rapid dispersal of highly transmissible variants, with implications for genomic surveillance along the hierarchical airline network.

IGFBP2 expressing midlobular hepatocytes preferentially contribute to liver homeostasis and regeneration,

Abstract: Summary
Although midlobular hepatocytes in zone 2 are a recently identified cellular source for liver homeostasis and regeneration, these cells have not been exclusively fate mapped. We generated an Igfbp2-CreER knockin strain that specifically labels midlobular hepatocytes. During homeostasis over 1 year, zone 2 hepatocytes increased in abundance from occupying 21%–41% of the lobular area. After either pericentral injury with carbon tetrachloride or periportal injury with 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC), IGFBP2+ cells replenished lost hepatocytes in zones 3 and 1, respectively. IGFBP2+ cells also preferentially contributed to regeneration after 70% partial hepatectomy, as well as liver growth during pregnancy. Because IGFBP2 labeling increased substantially with fasting, we used single nuclear transcriptomics to explore zonation as a function of nutrition, revealing that the zonal division of labor shifts dramatically with fasting. These studies demonstrate the contribution of IGFBP2-labeled zone 2 hepatocytes to liver homeostasis and regeneration.
