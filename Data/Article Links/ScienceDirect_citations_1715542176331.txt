Abstract: The period of gonads development was first studied from one to five years in the freshwater pearl mussel Hyriopisis schlegelii. It lasted for 36 months and was divided into three main stages: initiation of gonad formation, a stable growth phase, and a reproductive cell development phase. Each reproductive cycle consisted of five stages: proliferative stage (from late January to late February), growth stage (from late February to late March), maturation stage, spawning stage (from early April to late October) and recovery stage (from early November to late January). Interestingly, a hermaphroditic phenomenon was observed in this mussel for the first time, which appears during the development stage from 26 to 32 months. Male and female follicular tissues coexisted in hermaphrodite individuals with the male follicular tissue accounting for more than 90% of the whole gonad tissue. No hermaphroditic phenomenon was observed in matured gonad. We thus speculate that self-fertilization does not exist in H. schlegelii.

Abstract: Summary
Activating germline mutations in STAT3 were recently identified as a cause of neonatal diabetes mellitus associated with beta-cell autoimmunity. We have investigated the effect of an activating mutation, STAT3K392R, on pancreatic development using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from a patient with neonatal diabetes and pancreatic hypoplasia. Early pancreatic endoderm differentiated similarly from STAT3K392R and healthy-control cells, but in later stages, NEUROG3 expression was upregulated prematurely in STAT3K392R cells together with insulin (INS) and glucagon (GCG). RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) showed robust NEUROG3 downstream targets upregulation. STAT3 mutation correction with CRISPR/Cas9 reversed completely the disease phenotype. STAT3K392R-activating properties were not explained fully by altered DNA-binding affinity or increased phosphorylation. Instead, reporter assays demonstrated NEUROG3 promoter activation by STAT3 in pancreatic cells. Furthermore, proteomic and immunocytochemical analyses revealed increased nuclear translocation of STAT3K392R. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the STAT3K392R mutation causes premature endocrine differentiation through direct induction of NEUROG3 expression.

Abstract: Summary
Antibiotics elicit drastic changes in microbial gene expression, including the induction of stress response genes. While certain stress responses are known to “cross-protect” bacteria from other stressors, it is unclear whether cellular responses to antibiotics have a similar protective role. By measuring the genome-wide transcriptional response dynamics of Escherichia coli to four antibiotics, we found that trimethoprim induces a rapid acid stress response that protects bacteria from subsequent exposure to acid. Combining microfluidics with time-lapse imaging to monitor survival and acid stress response in single cells revealed that the noisy expression of the acid resistance operon gadBC correlates with single-cell survival. Cells with higher gadBC expression following trimethoprim maintain higher intracellular pH and survive the acid stress longer. The seemingly random single-cell survival under acid stress can therefore be predicted from gadBC expression and rationalized in terms of GadB/C molecular function. Overall, we provide a roadmap for identifying the molecular mechanisms of single-cell cross-protection between antibiotics and other stressors.

Abstract: Summary
Cells receive a multitude of signals from the environment, but how they process simultaneous signaling inputs is not well understood. Response to infection, for example, involves parallel activation of multiple Toll-like receptors (TLRs) that converge on the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway. Although we increasingly understand inflammatory responses for isolated signals, it is not clear how cells process multiple signals that co-occur in physiological settings. We therefore examined a bacterial infection scenario involving co-stimulation of TLR4 and TLR2. Independent stimulation of these receptors induced distinct NF-κB dynamic profiles, although surprisingly, under co-stimulation, single cells continued to show ligand-specific dynamic responses characteristic of TLR2 or TLR4 signaling rather than a mixed response, comprising a cellular decision that we term “non-integrative” processing. Iterating modeling and microfluidic experiments revealed that non-integrative processing occurred through interaction of switch-like NF-κB activation, receptor-specific processing timescales, cell-to-cell variability, and TLR cross-tolerance mediated by multilayer negative feedback.

Abstract: Summary
The fluorescence microscopy methods presently used to characterize protein motion in cells infer protein motion from indirect observables, rather than measuring protein motion directly. Operationalizing these methods requires expertise that can constitute a barrier to their broad utilization. Here, we have developed PIPE (photo-converted intensity profile expansion) to directly measure the motion of tagged proteins and quantify it using an effective diffusion coefficient. PIPE works by pulsing photo-convertible fluorescent proteins, generating a peaked fluorescence signal at the pulsed region, and analyzing the spatial expansion of the signal. We demonstrate PIPE’s success in measuring accurate diffusion coefficients in silico and in vitro and compare effective diffusion coefficients of native cellular proteins and free fluorophores in vivo. We apply PIPE to measure diffusion anomality in the cell and use it to distinguish free fluorophores from native cellular proteins. PIPE’s direct measurement and ease of use make it appealing for cell biologists.

Abstract: Summary
Mitotic spindle formation and chromosome segregation require timely separation of the two duplicated centrosomes, and this process is initiated in late G2 by centrosome disjunction. Here we report that GAS2L1, a microtubule- and actin-binding protein, associates with the proximal end of mature centrioles and participates in centriole dynamics and centrosome disjunction. GAS2L1 attaches microtubules and actin to centrosomes, and the loss of GAS2L1 inhibits centrosome disjunction in G2 and centrosome splitting induced by depletion of the centrosome linker rootletin. Conversely, GAS2L1 overexpression induces premature centrosome separation, and this activity requires GAS2L1 association with actin, microtubules, and the microtubule end-binding proteins. The centrosome-splitting effect of GAS2L1 is counterbalanced by rootletin, reflecting the opposing actions of GAS2L1 and the centrosome linker. Our work reveals a GAS2L1-mediated centriole-tethering mechanism of microtubules and actin, which provide the forces required for centrosome dynamics and separation.

Abstract: Summary
The Arabidopsis thaliana root epidermis is comprised of two cell types, hair and nonhair cells, which differentiate from the same precursor. Although the transcriptional programs regulating these events are well studied, post-transcriptional factors functioning in this cell fate decision are mostly unknown. Here, we globally identify RNA-protein interactions and RNA secondary structure in hair and nonhair cell nuclei. This analysis reveals distinct structural and protein binding patterns across both transcriptomes, allowing identification of differential RNA binding protein (RBP) recognition sites. Using these sequences, we identify two RBPs that regulate hair cell development. Specifically, we find that SERRATE functions in a microRNA-dependent manner to inhibit hair cell fate, while also terminating growth of root hairs mostly independent of microRNA biogenesis. In addition, we show that GLYCINE-RICH PROTEIN 8 promotes hair cell fate while alleviating phosphate starvation stress. In total, this global analysis reveals post-transcriptional regulators of plant root epidermal cell fate.

Abstract: Summary
We have previously found that UV irradiation promotes RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) hyperphosphorylation and subsequent changes in alternative splicing (AS). We show now that UV-induced DNA damage is not only necessary but sufficient to trigger the AS response and that photolyase-mediated removal of the most abundant class of pyrimidine dimers (PDs) abrogates the global response to UV. We demonstrate that, in keratinocytes, RNAPII is the target, but not a sensor, of the signaling cascade initiated by PDs. The UV effect is enhanced by inhibition of gap-filling DNA synthesis, the last step in the nucleotide excision repair pathway (NER), and reduced by the absence of XPE, the main NER sensor of PDs. The mechanism involves activation of the protein kinase ATR that mediates the UV-induced RNAPII hyperphosphorylation. Our results define the sequence UV-PDs-NER-ATR-RNAPII-AS as a pathway linking DNA damage repair to the control of both RNAPII phosphorylation and AS regulation.

Abstract: Summary
During epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cells lining the tissue periphery break up their cohesion to migrate within the tissue. This dramatic reorganization involves a poorly characterized reorientation of the apicobasal polarity of static epithelial cells into the front-rear polarity of migrating mesenchymal cells. To investigate the spatial coordination of intracellular reorganization with morphological changes, we monitored centrosome positioning during EMT in vivo, in developing mouse embryos and mammary gland, and in vitro, in cultured 3D cell aggregates and micropatterned cell doublets. In all conditions, centrosomes moved from their off-centered position next to intercellular junctions toward extracellular matrix adhesions on the opposite side of the nucleus, resulting in an effective internal polarity reversal. This move appeared to be supported by controlled microtubule network disassembly. Sequential release of cell confinement using dynamic micropatterns, and modulation of microtubule dynamics, confirmed that centrosome repositioning was responsible for further cell disengagement and scattering.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular blebbing, caused by local alterations in cell-surface tension, has been shown to increase the invasiveness of cancer cells. However, the regulatory mechanisms balancing cell-surface dynamics and bleb formation remain elusive. Here, we show that an acute reduction in cell volume activates clathrin-independent endocytosis. Hence, a decrease in surface tension is buffered by the internalization of the plasma membrane (PM) lipid bilayer. Membrane invagination and endocytosis are driven by the tension-mediated recruitment of the membrane sculpting and GTPase-activating protein GRAF1 (GTPase regulator associated with focal adhesion kinase-1) to the PM. Disruption of this regulation by depleting cells of GRAF1 or mutating key phosphatidylinositol-interacting amino acids in the protein results in increased cellular blebbing and promotes the 3D motility of cancer cells. Our data support a role for clathrin-independent endocytic machinery in balancing membrane tension, which clarifies the previously reported role of GRAF1 as a tumor suppressor.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial complex I is the largest integral membrane enzyme of the respiratory chain and consists of 44 different subunits encoded in the mitochondrial and nuclear genome. Its biosynthesis is a highly complicated and multifaceted process involving at least 14 additional assembly factors. How these subunits assemble into a functional complex I and where the assembly factors come into play is largely unknown. Here, we applied a dynamic complexome profiling approach to elucidate the assembly of human mitochondrial complex I and its further incorporation into respiratory chain supercomplexes. We delineate the stepwise incorporation of all but one subunit into a series of distinct assembly intermediates and their association with known and putative assembly factors, which had not been implicated in this process before. The resulting detailed and comprehensive model of complex I assembly is fully consistent with recent structural data and the remarkable modular architecture of this multiprotein complex.

Abstract: Summary
Triglyceride (TG) storage in adipose tissue provides the major reservoir for metabolic energy in mammals. During lipolysis, fatty acids (FAs) are hydrolyzed from adipocyte TG stores and transported to other tissues for fuel. For unclear reasons, a large portion of hydrolyzed FAs in adipocytes is re-esterified to TGs in a “futile,” ATP-consuming, energy dissipating cycle. Here we show that FA re-esterification during adipocyte lipolysis is mediated by DGAT1, an ER-localized DGAT enzyme. Surprisingly, this re-esterification cycle does not preserve TG mass but instead functions to protect the ER from lipotoxic stress and related consequences, such as adipose tissue inflammation. Our data reveal an important role for DGAT activity and TG synthesis generally in averting ER stress and lipotoxicity, with specifically DGAT1 performing this function during stimulated lipolysis in adipocytes.

Abstract: The aim of this research was to quantify the changes in the morphology and density of the anterior pituitary folliculostellate (FS) and luteinizing hormone (LH) cells. Material was tissue of the pituitary gland of the 14 male cadavers. Tissue slices were immunohistochemically stained with monoclonal anti-LH antibody and polyclonal anti-S100 antibody for the detection of LH and FS cells, respectively. Digital images of the stained slices were afterwards morphometrically analyzed by ImageJ. Results of the morphometric analysis showed significant increase of the FS cells volume density in cases older than 70 years. Volume density of the LH cells did not significantly change, whereas their area significantly increased with age. Nucleocytoplasmic ratio of the LH cells gradually decreased and became significant after the age of 70. Finally, volume density of the FS cell significantly correlated with LH cells area and nucleocytoplasmic ratio. From all above cited, we concluded that in men, density and size of the FS cells increase with age. Long-term hypertrophy of the LH cells results in their functional decline after the age of 70. Strong correlation between FS cells and LH cells morphometric parameters might point to age-related interaction between these two cell groups.

Abstract: Summary
Glutamine-synthetase (GS), the glutamine-synthesizing enzyme from glutamate, controls important events, including the release of inflammatory mediators, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation, and autophagy. However, its role in macrophages remains elusive. We report that pharmacologic inhibition of GS skews M2-polarized macrophages toward the M1-like phenotype, characterized by reduced intracellular glutamine and increased succinate with enhanced glucose flux through glycolysis, which could be partly related to HIF1α activation. As a result of these metabolic changes and HIF1α accumulation, GS-inhibited macrophages display an increased capacity to induce T cell recruitment, reduced T cell suppressive potential, and an impaired ability to foster endothelial cell branching or cancer cell motility. Genetic deletion of macrophagic GS in tumor-bearing mice promotes tumor vessel pruning, vascular normalization, accumulation of cytotoxic T cells, and metastasis inhibition. These data identify GS activity as mediator of the proangiogenic, immunosuppressive, and pro-metastatic function of M2-like macrophages and highlight the possibility of targeting this enzyme in the treatment of cancer metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Numerous long intervening noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) are generated from the mammalian genome by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription. Although multiple functions have been ascribed to lincRNAs, their synthesis and turnover remain poorly characterized. Here, we define systematic differences in transcription and RNA processing between protein-coding and lincRNA genes in human HeLa cells. This is based on a range of nascent transcriptomic approaches applied to different nuclear fractions, including mammalian native elongating transcript sequencing (mNET-seq). Notably, mNET-seq patterns specific for different Pol II CTD phosphorylation states reveal weak co-transcriptional splicing and poly(A) signal-independent Pol II termination of lincRNAs as compared to pre-mRNAs. In addition, lincRNAs are mostly restricted to chromatin, since they are rapidly degraded by the RNA exosome. We also show that a lincRNA-specific co-transcriptional RNA cleavage mechanism acts to induce premature termination. In effect, functional lincRNAs must escape from this targeted nuclear surveillance process.

Abstract: Summary
Receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) represents an essential signaling node in cell death and inflammation. Ablation of Ripk1 in liver parenchymal cells (LPC) did not cause a spontaneous phenotype, but led to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-dependent hepatocyte apoptosis and liver injury without affecting inducible nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation. Loss of Ripk1 induced the TNF-dependent proteasomal degradation of the E3-ligase, TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), in a kinase-independent manner, thereby activating caspase-8. Moreover, loss of both Ripk1 and Traf2 in LPC not only resulted in caspase-8 hyperactivation but also impaired NF-κB activation, promoting the spontaneous development of hepatocellular carcinoma. In line, low RIPK1 and TRAF2 expression in human HCCs was associated with an unfavorable prognosis, suggesting that RIPK1 collaborates with TRAF2 to inhibit murine and human hepatocarcinogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
50 years ago, Vincent Allfrey and colleagues discovered that lymphocyte activation triggers massive acetylation of chromatin. However, the molecular mechanisms driving epigenetic accessibility are still unknown. We here show that stimulated lymphocytes decondense chromatin by three differentially regulated steps. First, chromatin is repositioned away from the nuclear periphery in response to global acetylation. Second, histone nanodomain clusters decompact into mononucleosome fibers through a mechanism that requires Myc and continual energy input. Single-molecule imaging shows that this step lowers transcription factor residence time and non-specific collisions during sampling for DNA targets. Third, chromatin interactions shift from long range to predominantly short range, and CTCF-mediated loops and contact domains double in numbers. This architectural change facilitates cognate promoter-enhancer contacts and also requires Myc and continual ATP production. Our results thus define the nature and transcriptional impact of chromatin decondensation and reveal an unexpected role for Myc in the establishment of nuclear topology in mammalian cells.

We have employed TIER-seq (transiently inactivating an endoribonuclease followed by RNA-seq) to profile cleavage products of the essential endoribonuclease RNase E in Salmonella enterica. A dominating cleavage signature is the location of a uridine two nucleotides downstream in a single-stranded segment, which we rationalize structurally as a key recognition determinant that may favor RNase E catalysis. Our results suggest a prominent biogenesis pathway for bacterial regulatory small RNAs whereby RNase E acts together with the RNA chaperone Hfq to liberate stable 3′ fragments from various precursor RNAs. Recapitulating this process in vitro, Hfq guides RNase E cleavage of a representative small-RNA precursor for interaction with a mRNA target. In vivo, the processing is required for target regulation. Our findings reveal a general maturation mechanism for a major class of post-transcriptional regulators.

Abstract: Summary
In mammals, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) rapidly expand in the fetal liver (FL), but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we characterize zebrafish caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT) and identify an important cellular and molecular mechanism of HSPC expansion. Time-lapse imaging showed that HSPCs localize adjacent to vascular endothelial cells (ECs), and their migration and expansion display caudal vein-specific orientation in the CHT. RNA sequencing and functional analysis identified that an EC-expressed transcription factor, Krüppel-like factor 6a (Klf6a), is essential for the CHT niche. We further demonstrated that Klf6a directly regulates the expression of the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 25b to modulate HSPC lodgment and proliferation. Ex vivo culture results support the conserved role of Ccl21/Ccr7 signaling in promoting HSPC expansion in mammals. Together, we identify the Klf6a-Ccl25b/Ccr7 axis in controlling the complex HSPC-CHT niche interaction, which may be applicable to in vitro expansion or engraftment of HSPCs after transplantation.

Abstract: Summary
Chlorophyll biosynthesis enables autotrophic development of developing seedlings. Upon light exposure, the chlorophyll precursor protochlorophyllide produces reactive oxygen species (ROS). Developing seedlings acquire photosynthetic competence through the action of protochlorophyllide oxidoreductases (PORs) that convert protochlorophyllide to chlorophyllide, reducing ROS production that would otherwise induce cellular damage and chlorophyll bleaching. Here, we show that FCA mediates the thermostabilization of PORs to trigger the conversion of protochlorophyllide to chlorophyllide in developing seedlings. FCA also facilitates the thermal induction of POR genes through histone acetylation that promotes the accessibility of RNA polymerases to the gene promoters. The combined action of FCA maintains PORs at warm temperatures, shifting the chlorophyll-ROS balance toward autotrophic development. We propose that the FCA-mediated thermal adaptation of autotrophic development allows developing seedlings to cope with the heat-absorbing soil surface layer under natural conditions. The thermal adaptive mechanism would provide a potential basis for studying crop performance at warm temperatures.

Abstract: Summary
A lack of sufficient oligodendrocyte myelination contributes to remyelination failure in demyelinating disorders. miRNAs have been implicated in oligodendrogenesis; however, their functions in myelin regeneration remained elusive. Through developmentally regulated targeted mutagenesis, we demonstrate that miR-219 alleles are critical for CNS myelination and remyelination after injury. Further deletion of miR-338 exacerbates the miR-219 mutant hypomyelination phenotype. Conversely, miR-219 overexpression promotes precocious oligodendrocyte maturation and regeneration processes in transgenic mice. Integrated transcriptome profiling and biotin-affinity miRNA pull-down approaches reveal stage-specific miR-219 targets in oligodendrocytes and further uncover a novel network for miR-219 targeting of differentiation inhibitors including Lingo1 and Etv5. Inhibition of Lingo1 and Etv5 partially rescues differentiation defects of miR-219-deficient oligodendrocyte precursors. Furthermore, miR-219 mimics enhance myelin restoration following lysolecithin-induced demyelination as well as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, principal animal models of multiple sclerosis. Together, our findings identify context-specific miRNA-regulated checkpoints that control myelinogenesis and a therapeutic role for miR-219 in CNS myelin repair.

Abstract: Summary
Successful regeneration requires that progenitors of different lineages form the appropriate missing cell types. However, simply generating lineages is not enough. Cells produced by a particular lineage often have distinct functions depending on their position within the organism. How this occurs in regeneration is largely unexplored. In planarian regeneration, new cells arise from a proliferative cell population (neoblasts). We used the planarian epidermal lineage to study how the location of adult progenitor cells results in their acquisition of distinct functional identities. Single-cell RNA sequencing of epidermal progenitors revealed the emergence of distinct spatial identities as early in the lineage as the epidermal neoblasts, with further pre-patterning occurring in their post-mitotic migratory progeny. Establishment of dorsal-ventral epidermal identities and functions, in response to BMP signaling, required neoblasts. Our work identified positional signals that activate regionalized transcriptional programs in the stem cell population and subsequently promote cell-type diversity in the epidermis.

Abstract: Summary
Hearing loss is widespread and persistent because mature mammalian auditory hair cells (HCs) are nonregenerative. In mice, the ability to regenerate HCs from surrounding supporting cells (SCs) declines abruptly after postnatal maturation. We find that combining p27Kip1 deletion with ectopic ATOH1 expression surmounts this age-related decline, leading to conversion of SCs to HCs in mature mouse cochleae and after noise damage. p27Kip1 deletion, independent of canonical effects on Rb-family proteins, upregulated GATA3, a co-factor for ATOH1 that is lost from SCs with age. Co-activation of GATA3 or POU4F3 and ATOH1 promoted conversion of SCs to HCs in adult mice. Activation of POU4F3 alone also converted mature SCs to HCs in vivo. These data illuminate a genetic pathway that initiates auditory HC regeneration and suggest p27Kip1, GATA3, and POU4F3 as additional therapeutic targets for ATOH1-mediated HC regeneration.

Abstract: Acne is the most common skin disorder and can directly affect the patients’ self-esteem. Systemic treatment has been indicated for nodular, cystic or persistent acne rather than another type of treatment, such as a topic one. Isotretinoin is an analogue of vitamin A and by suppressing the sebaceous glands the disease can be controlled. This study was designed to mimic the treatment performed in young patients using the dosage of 1mg/kg, and a higher one of 10mg/kg, for 60days in young male Wistar rats. 24 Wistar rats were divided into four groups: control(water), D0(soybean oil, control group), D1(1mg/kg of Isotretinoin solution), D10(10mg/kg of Isotretinoin solution). Using the morphometry tool and histochemical techniques we evaluated the villus, intestinal crypts, and goblet cells to find signs of possible alterations of the duodenum, jejunum and ileum segments of the small intestine. We found no signs of changes in the jejunum mucosa after 60 days of treatment with 1mg/kg and 10mg/kg. The duodenum is also less affected, whereas significant modifications were found in the ileum. The goblet cell frequency was altered, indicating a proliferative potential for the substance. Although some patients have described intestinal symptoms, no important alterations were found with this protocol, reaffirming the security involved in the treatment with this substance.

Abstract: The L-type Ca2+ channel or dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) in vertebrate skeletal muscle is responsible for sensing sarcolemmal depolarizations and transducing this signal to the sarcoplasmic Ca2+ release channel RyR1 via conformational coupling to initiate muscle contraction. During this excitation-contraction (EC) coupling process there is a slow Ca2+ current through the mammalian DHPR which is fully missing in euteleost fishes. In contrast to ancestral evolutionary stages where skeletal muscle EC coupling is still depended on Ca2+-induced Ca2+-release (CICR), it is possible that the DHPR Ca2+ conductivity during mammalian (conformational) EC coupling was retained as an evolutionary remnant (vestigiality). Here, we wanted to test the hypothesis that due to the lack of evolutionary pressure in post-CICR species skeletal muscle DHPR Ca2+ conductivity gradually reduced as evolution progressed. Interestingly, we identified that the DHPR of the early ray-finned fish sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus) is phylogenetically positioned above the mammalian rabbit DHPR which retained robust Ca2+ conductivity, but below the euteleost zebrafish DHPR which completely lost Ca2+ conductivity. Remarkably, our results revealed that sterlet DHPR still retained the Ca2+ conductivity but currents are significantly reduced compared to rabbit. This decrease is due to lower DHPR membrane expression similar to zebrafish, as well as due to reduced channel open probability (Po). In both these fish species the lower DHPR expression density is partially compensated by higher efficacy of DHPR-RyR1 coupling. The complete loss of Po in zebrafish and other euteleost species was presumably based on the teleost specific 3rd round of genome duplication (Ts3R). Ts3R headed into the appearance of two skeletal muscle DHPR isoforms which finally, together with the radiation of the euteleost clade, fully lost the Po.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity is associated with physical inactivity, which exacerbates the health consequences of weight gain. However, the mechanisms that mediate this association are unknown. We hypothesized that deficits in dopamine signaling contribute to physical inactivity in obesity. To investigate this, we quantified multiple aspects of dopamine signaling in lean and obese mice. We found that D2-type receptor (D2R) binding in the striatum, but not D1-type receptor binding or dopamine levels, was reduced in obese mice. Genetically removing D2Rs from striatal medium spiny neurons was sufficient to reduce motor activity in lean mice, whereas restoring Gi signaling in these neurons increased activity in obese mice. Surprisingly, although mice with low D2Rs were less active, they were not more vulnerable to diet-induced weight gain than control mice. We conclude that deficits in striatal D2R signaling contribute to physical inactivity in obesity, but inactivity is more a consequence than a cause of obesity.

Abstract: The inositol trisphosphate (IP3) signaling pathway evokes local Ca2+ signals (Ca2+ puffs) that arise from the concerted openings of clustered IP3 receptor/channels in the ER membrane. Physiological activation is triggered by binding of agonists to G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) on the cell surface, leading to cleavage of phosphatidyl inositol bisphosphate and release of IP3 into the cytosol. Photorelease of IP3 from a caged precursor provides a convenient and widely employed means to study the final stage of IP3-mediated Ca2+ liberation, bypassing upstream signaling events to enable more precise control of the timing and relative concentration of cytosolic IP3. Here, we address whether Ca2+ puffs evoked by photoreleased IP3 fully replicate those arising from physiological agonist stimulation. We imaged puffs in individual SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells that were sequentially stimulated by picospritzing extracellular agonist (carbachol, CCH or bradykinin, BK) followed by photorelease of a poorly-metabolized IP3 analog, i-IP3. The centroid localizations of fluorescence signals during puffs evoked in the same cells by agonists and photorelease substantially overlapped (within ∼1μm), suggesting that IP3 from both sources accesses the same, or closely co-localized clusters of IP3Rs. Moreover, the time course and spatial spread of puffs evoked by agonists and photorelease matched closely. Because photolysis generates IP3 uniformly throughout the cytoplasm, our results imply that IP3 generated in SH-SY5Y cells by activation of receptors to CCH and BK also exerts broadly distributed actions, rather than specifically activating a subpopulation of IP3Rs that are scaffolded in close proximity to cell surface receptors to form a signaling nanodomain.

Abstract: Summary
Antibodies play a crucial role in host defense and are indispensable research tools, diagnostics, and therapeutics. Antibody generation involves binding of genomically encoded germline antibodies followed by somatic hypermutation and in vivo selection to obtain antibodies with high affinity and selectivity. Understanding this process is critical for developing monoclonal antibodies, designing effective vaccines, and understanding autoantibody formation. Prior studies have found that antibodies to haptens, peptides, and proteins evolve from polyspecific germline antibodies. The immunological evolution of antibodies to mammalian glycans has not been studied. Using glycan microarrays, protein microarrays, cell binding studies, and molecular modeling, we demonstrate that therapeutic antibodies to the tumor-associated ganglioside GD2 evolved from highly specific germline precursors. The results have important implications for developing vaccines and monoclonal antibodies that target carbohydrate antigens. In addition, they demonstrate an alternative pathway for antibody evolution within the immune system that is distinct from the polyspecific germline pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Predicting vaccine efficacy remains a challenge. We used a systems vaccinology approach to identify early innate immune correlates of antibody induction in humans receiving the Ebola vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV. Blood samples from days 0, 1, 3, 7, and 14 were analyzed for changes in cytokine levels, innate immune cell subsets, and gene expression. Integrative statistical analyses with cross-validation identified a signature of 5 early innate markers correlating with antibody titers on day 28 and beyond. Among those, IP-10 on day 3 and MFI of CXCR6 on NK cells on day 1 were independent correlates. Consistently, we found an early gene expression signature linked to IP-10. This comprehensive characterization of early innate immune responses to the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine in humans revealed immune signatures linked to IP-10. These results suggest correlates of vaccine-induced antibody induction and provide a rationale to explore strategies for augmenting the effectiveness of vaccines through manipulation of IP-10.

Abstract: Summary
Activation of the main DNA interstrand crosslink repair pathway in higher eukaryotes requires mono-ubiquitination of FANCI and FANCD2 by FANCL, the E3 ligase subunit of the Fanconi anemia core complex. FANCI and FANCD2 form a stable complex; however, the molecular basis of their ubiquitination is ill defined. FANCD2 mono-ubiquitination by FANCL is stimulated by the presence of the FANCB and FAAP100 core complex components, through an unknown mechanism. How FANCI mono-ubiquitination is achieved remains unclear. Here, we use structural electron microscopy, combined with crosslink-coupled mass spectrometry, to find that FANCB, FANCL, and FAAP100 form a dimer of trimers, containing two FANCL molecules that are ideally poised to target both FANCI and FANCD2 for mono-ubiquitination. The FANCC-FANCE-FANCF subunits bridge between FANCB-FANCL-FAAP100 and the FANCI-FANCD2 substrate. A transient interaction with FANCC-FANCE-FANCF alters the FANCI-FANCD2 configuration, stabilizing the dimerization interface. Our data provide a model to explain how equivalent mono-ubiquitination of FANCI and FANCD2 occurs.

Abstract: Summary
The central circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), encodes day length information by mechanisms that are not well understood. Here, we report that genetic ablation of miR-132/212 alters entrainment to different day lengths and non-24 hr day-night cycles, as well as photoperiodic regulation of Period2 expression in the SCN. SCN neurons from miR-132/212-deficient mice have significantly reduced dendritic spine density, along with altered methyl CpG-binding protein (MeCP2) rhythms. In Syrian hamsters, a model seasonal rodent, day length regulates spine density on SCN neurons in a melatonin-independent manner, as well as expression of miR-132, miR-212, and their direct target, MeCP2. Genetic disruption of Mecp2 fully restores the level of dendritic spines of miR-132/212-deficient SCN neurons. Our results reveal that, by regulating the dendritic structure of SCN neurons through a MeCP2-dependent mechanism, miR-132/212 affects the capacity of the SCN to encode seasonal time.

Abstract: Summary
Generation of midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons from human pluripotent stem cells provides a platform for inquiry into basic and translational studies of Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, heterogeneity in differentiation in vitro makes it difficult to identify mDA neurons in culture or in vivo following transplantation. Here, we report the generation of a human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line with a tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-RFP (red fluorescent protein) reporter. We validated that RFP faithfully mimicked TH expression during differentiation. Use of this TH-RFP reporter cell line enabled purification of mDA-like neurons from heterogeneous cultures with subsequent characterization of neuron transcriptional and epigenetic programs (global binding profiles of H3K27ac, H3K4me1, and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine [5hmC]) at four different stages of development. We anticipate that the tools and data described here will contribute to the development of mDA neurons for applications in disease modeling and/or drug screening and cell replacement therapies for PD.

Abstract: Summary
Cardiogenesis processes in human and animals have differential dynamics, suggesting the existence of species-specific regulators during heart development. However, it remains a challenge to discover the human-specific cardiac regulatory genes, given that most coding genes are conserved. Here, we report the identification of a human-specific long noncoding RNA, Heart Brake LncRNA 1 (HBL1), which regulates cardiomyocyte development from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Overexpression of HBL1 repressed, whereas knockdown and knockout of HBL1 increased, cardiomyocyte differentiation from hiPSCs. HBL1 physically interacted with MIR1 in an AGO2 complex. Disruption of MIR1 binding sites in HBL1 showed an effect similar to that of HBL1 knockout. SOX2 bound to HBL1 promoter and activated its transcription. Knockdown of SOX2 in hiPSCs led to decreased HBL1 expression and increased cardiomyocyte differentiation efficiency. Thus, HBL1 plays a modulatory role in fine-tuning human-specific cardiomyocyte development by forming a regulatory network with SOX2 and MIR1.

Abstract: Summary
The interplay between transcription factors and chromatin dictates gene regulatory network activity. Germ layer specification is tightly coupled with zygotic gene activation and, in most metazoans, is dependent upon maternal factors. We explore the dynamic genome-wide interactions of Foxh1, a maternal transcription factor that mediates Nodal/TGF-β signaling, with cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) during mesendodermal specification. Foxh1 marks CRMs during cleavage stages and recruits the co-repressor Tle/Groucho in the early blastula. We highlight a population of CRMs that are continuously occupied by Foxh1 and show that they are marked by H3K4me1, Ep300, and Fox/Sox/Smad motifs, suggesting interplay between these factors in gene regulation. We also propose a molecular “hand-off” between maternal Foxh1 and zygotic Foxa at these CRMs to maintain enhancer activation. Our findings suggest that Foxh1 functions at the top of a hierarchy of interactions by marking developmental genes for activation, beginning with the onset of zygotic gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
The CRISPR/Cas9 system has recently been shown to facilitate high levels of precise genome editing using adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors to serve as donor template DNA during homologous recombination (HR). However, the maximum AAV packaging capacity of ∼4.5 kb limits the donor size. Here, we overcome this constraint by showing that two co-transduced AAV vectors can serve as donors during consecutive HR events for the integration of large transgenes. Importantly, the method involves a single-step procedure applicable to primary cells with relevance to therapeutic genome editing. We use the methodology in primary human T cells and CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to site-specifically integrate an expression cassette that, as a single donor vector, would otherwise amount to a total of 6.5 kb. This approach now provides an efficient way to integrate large transgene cassettes into the genomes of primary human cells using HR-mediated genome editing with AAV vectors.

Abstract: Summary
Tyro3, Axl, and Mertk (TAM) receptors are candidate entry receptors for infection with the Zika virus (ZIKV), an emerging flavivirus of global public health concern. To investigate the requirement of TAM receptors for ZIKV infection, we used several routes of viral inoculation and compared viral replication in wild-type versus Axl−/−, Mertk−/−, Axl−/−Mertk−/−, and Axl−/−Tyro3−/− mice in various organs. Pregnant and non-pregnant mice treated with interferon-α-receptor (IFNAR)-blocking (MAR1-5A3) antibody and infected subcutaneously with ZIKV showed no reliance on TAMs for infection. In the absence of IFNAR-blocking antibody, adult female mice challenged intravaginally with ZIKV showed no difference in mucosal viral titers. Similarly, in young mice that were infected with ZIKV intracranially or intraperitoneally, ZIKV replication occurred in the absence of TAM receptors, and no differences in cell tropism were observed. These findings indicate that, in mice, TAM receptors are not required for ZIKV entry and infection.

Abstract: Summary
Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) signaling is transient and spatially confined in live cells. How this pattern of signaling regulates transmitter release and hormone secretion has not been addressed. We devised an optogenetic approach to control PI(4,5)P2 levels in time and space in insulin-secreting cells. Combining this approach with total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we examined individual vesicle-trafficking steps. Unlike long-term PI(4,5)P2 perturbations, rapid and cell-wide PI(4,5)P2 reduction in the plasma membrane (PM) strongly inhibits secretion and intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) responses, but not sytaxin1a clustering. Interestingly, local PI(4,5)P2 reduction selectively at vesicle docking sites causes remarkable vesicle undocking from the PM without affecting [Ca2+]i. These results highlight a key role of local PI(4,5)P2 in vesicle tethering and docking, coordinated with its role in priming and fusion. Thus, different spatiotemporal PI(4,5)P2 signaling regulates distinct steps of vesicle trafficking, and vesicle docking may be a key target of local PI(4,5)P2 signaling in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
It is unclear how standing genetic variation affects the prognosis of prostate cancer patients. To provide one controlled answer to this problem, we crossed a dominant, penetrant mouse model of prostate cancer to Diversity Outbred mice, a collection of animals that carries over 40 million SNPs. Integration of disease phenotype and SNP variation data in 493 F1 males identified a metastasis modifier locus on Chromosome 8 (LOD = 8.42); further analysis identified the genes Rwdd4, Cenpu, and Casp3 as functional effectors of this locus. Accordingly, analysis of over 5,300 prostate cancer patient samples revealed correlations between the presence of genetic variants at these loci, their expression levels, cancer aggressiveness, and patient survival. We also observed that ectopic overexpression of RWDD4 and CENPU increased the aggressiveness of two human prostate cancer cell lines. In aggregate, our approach demonstrates how well-characterized genetic variation in mice can be harnessed in conjunction with systems genetics approaches to identify and characterize germline modifiers of human disease processes.

Abstract: Summary
Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a carcinogen that generates DNA lesions. Here, we demonstrate an unexpected role for DGCR8, an RNA binding protein that canonically functions with Drosha to mediate microRNA processing, in the repair of UV-induced DNA lesions. Treatment with UV induced phosphorylation on serine 153 (S153) of DGCR8 in both human and murine cells. S153 phosphorylation was critical for cellular resistance to UV, the removal of UV-induced DNA lesions, and the recovery of RNA synthesis after UV exposure but not for microRNA expression. The RNA-binding and Drosha-binding activities of DGCR8 were not critical for UV resistance. DGCR8 depletion was epistatic to defects in XPA, CSA, and CSB for UV sensitivity. DGCR8 physically interacted with CSB and RNA polymerase II. JNKs were involved in the UV-induced S153 phosphorylation. These findings suggest that UV-induced S153 phosphorylation mediates transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair of UV-induced DNA lesions in a manner independent of microRNA processing.

Abstract: Summary
Proteasome-catalyzed peptide splicing (PCPS) generates peptides that are presented by MHC class I molecules, but because their identification is challenging, the immunological relevance of spliced peptides remains unclear. Here, we developed a reverse immunology-based multi-level approach to identify proteasome-generated spliced epitopes. Applying this strategy to a murine Listeria monocytogenes infection model, we identified two spliced epitopes within the secreted bacterial phospholipase PlcB that primed antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in L. monocytogenes-infected mice. While reacting to the spliced epitopes, these CD8+ T cells failed to recognize the non-spliced peptide parts in the context of their natural flanking sequences. Thus, we here show that PCPS expands the CD8+ T cell response against L. monocytogenes by exposing spliced epitopes on the cell surface. Moreover, our multi-level strategy opens up opportunities to systematically investigate proteins for spliced epitope candidates and thus strategies for immunotherapies or vaccine design.

Abstract: Summary
Regulated inter-mitochondrial fusion/fission is essential for maintaining optimal mitochondrial respiration and control of apoptosis and autophagy. In mammals, mitochondrial fusion is controlled by outer membrane GTPases MFN1 and MFN2 and by inner membrane (IM) GTPase OPA1. Disordered mitochondrial fusion/fission contributes to various pathologies, and MFN2 or OPA1 mutations underlie neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we show that the WBSCR16 protein is primarily associated with the outer face of the inner mitochondrial membrane and is important for mitochondrial fusion. We provide evidence of a WBSCR16/OPA1 physical interaction in the intact cell and of a WBSCR16 function as an OPA1-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). Homozygosity for a Wbscr16 mutation causes early embryonic lethality, whereas neurons of mice heterozygous for the mutation have mitochondria with reduced membrane potential and increased susceptibility to fragmentation upon exposure to stress, suggesting roles for WBSCR16 deficits in neuronal pathologies.

Abstract: Summary
The recent discovery of metabolic roles for fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) in glucose homeostasis has expanded the functions of this classically known mitogen. To dissect the molecular basis for this functional pleiotropy, we engineered an FGF1 partial agonist carrying triple mutations (FGF1ΔHBS) that diminished its ability to induce heparan sulfate (HS)-assisted FGF receptor (FGFR) dimerization and activation. FGF1ΔHBS exhibited a severely reduced proliferative potential, while preserving the full metabolic activity of wild-type FGF1 in vitro and in vivo. Hence, suboptimal FGFR activation by a weak FGF1-FGFR dimer is sufficient to evoke a metabolic response, whereas full FGFR activation by stable and sustained dimerization is required to elicit a mitogenic response. In addition to providing a physical basis for the diverse activities of FGF1, our findings will impact ongoing drug discoveries targeting FGF1 and related FGFs for the treatment of a variety of human diseases.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate the adipocyte size and fate in subcutaneous fat (scAT) of cows diverging for genetic merit at mid lactation stage, when anabolic activity increases and animals are in a state of positive energy balance. Twenty mid lactation cows (180±20days in milk) grouped according to the Estimated Breeding Values (EBV) for milk yield in plus (EBVp) and minus (EBVm) variants were selected. Average of adipocytes area, proliferation and apoptotic labelling index as well as DLK-1 expression, a marker of pre-adipocytes, were immunohistochemically evaluated in scAT biopsies. In EBVp cows, the BCS was lower (P<0.01) whereas milk yield, protein, fat yield (P<0.001) and plasma free fatty acid concentration (P<0.05) were higher. The scAT of EBVp cows showed a significantly (P<0.001) higher frequency between 500 and 3000μm2 classes in comparison to EBVm cows, that showed a significantly (P<0.01) higher apoptotic labeling index. The immunohistochemical reaction showed DLK-1 positivity in scAT of EBVp cows. Taking together, the data indicate a link between milk yield genetic merit of cows, scAT morphology and function, suggesting greater dynamics and metabolic flexibility in EBVp cows.

Abstract: Summary
Lysosomes rely on their resident transporter proteins to return products of catabolism to the cell for reuse and for cellular signaling, metal storage, and maintaining the lumenal environment. Despite their importance, little is known about the lifetime of these transporters or how they are regulated. Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model, we discovered a new pathway intrinsic to homotypic lysosome membrane fusion that is responsible for their degradation. Transporter proteins are selectively sorted by the docking machinery into an area between apposing lysosome membranes, which is internalized and degraded by lumenal hydrolases upon organelle fusion. These proteins have diverse lifetimes that are regulated in response to protein misfolding, changing substrate levels, or TOR activation. Analogous to endocytosis for controlling surface protein levels, the “intralumenal fragment pathway” is critical for lysosome membrane remodeling required for organelle function in the context of cellular protein quality control, ion homeostasis, and metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Bone mineral density (BMD) is a highly heritable predictor of osteoporotic fracture. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for BMD have identified dozens of associations; yet, the genes responsible for most associations remain elusive. Here, we used a bone co-expression network to predict causal genes at BMD GWAS loci based on the premise that genes underlying a disease are often functionally related and functionally related genes are often co-expressed. By mapping genes implicated by BMD GWAS onto a bone co-expression network, we predicted and inferred the function of causal genes for 30 of 64 GWAS loci. We experimentally confirmed that two of the genes predicted to be causal, SPTBN1 and MARK3, are potentially responsible for the effects of GWAS loci on chromosomes 2p16.2 and 14q32.32, respectively. This approach provides a roadmap for the dissection of additional BMD GWAS associations. Furthermore, it should be applicable to GWAS data for a wide range of diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Regions of genomic DNA called enhancers encode binding sites for transcription factor proteins. Binding of activators and repressors increase and reduce transcription, respectively, but it is not understood how combinations of activators and repressors generate precise patterns of transcription during development. Here, we explore this problem using a fully synthetic transcriptional platform in Drosophila consisting of engineered transcription factor gradients and artificial enhancers. We found that binding sites for a transcription factor that makes DNA accessible are required together with binding sites for transcriptional activators to produce a functional enhancer. Only in this context can changes in the number of activator binding sites mediate quantitative control of transcription. Using an engineered transcriptional repressor gradient, we demonstrate that overlapping repressor and activator binding sites provide more robust repression and sharper expression boundaries than non-overlapping sites. This may explain why this common motif is observed in many developmental enhancers.

Abstract: Summary
Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have great potential for treating age-related diseases, but the genome integrity of iPSCs is critically important. Here, we demonstrate that non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), rather than homologous recombination (HR), is less efficient in iPSCs from old mice than young mice. We further find that Sirt6 is downregulated in iPSCs from old mice. Sirt6 directly binds to Ku80 and facilitates the Ku80/DNA-PKcs interaction, thus promoting DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at residue S2056, leading to efficient NHEJ. Rescue experiments show that introducing a combination of Sirt6 and the Yamanaka factors during reprogramming significantly promotes DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by activating NHEJ in iPSCs derived from old mice. Thus, our study suggests a strategy to improve the quality of iPSCs derived from old donors by activating NHEJ and stabilizing the genome.

Abstract: Summary
Alternative splicing is a critical determinant of genome complexity and, by implication, is assumed to engender proteomic diversity. This notion has not been experimentally tested in a targeted, quantitative manner. Here, we have developed an integrative approach to ask whether perturbations in mRNA splicing patterns alter the composition of the proteome. We integrate RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) (to comprehensively report intron retention, differential transcript usage, and gene expression) with a data-independent acquisition (DIA) method, SWATH-MS (sequential window acquisition of all theoretical spectra-mass spectrometry), to capture an unbiased, quantitative snapshot of the impact of constitutive and alternative splicing events on the proteome. Whereas intron retention is accompanied by decreased protein abundance, alterations in differential transcript usage and gene expression alter protein abundance proportionate to transcript levels. Our findings illustrate how RNA splicing links isoform expression in the human transcriptome with proteomic diversity and provides a foundation for studying perturbations associated with human diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC) stimulates processing reactions of capped RNAs, including their splicing, 3′-end formation, degradation, and transport. CBC effects are particular for individual RNA families, but how such selectivity is achieved remains elusive. Here, we analyze three main CBC partners known to impact different RNA species. ARS2 stimulates 3′-end formation/transcription termination of several transcript types, ZC3H18 stimulates degradation of a diverse set of RNAs, and PHAX functions in pre-small nuclear RNA/small nucleolar RNA (pre-snRNA/snoRNA) transport. Surprisingly, these proteins all bind capped RNAs without strong preferences for given transcripts, and their steady-state binding correlates poorly with their function. Despite this, PHAX and ZC3H18 compete for CBC binding and we demonstrate that this competitive binding is functionally relevant. We further show that CBC-containing complexes are short lived in vivo, and we therefore suggest that RNA fate involves the transient formation of mutually exclusive CBC complexes, which may only be consequential at particular checkpoints during RNA biogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Chimeric transcription factors are a hallmark of human leukemia, but the molecular mechanisms by which they block differentiation and promote aberrant self-renewal remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the ETO2-GLIS2 fusion oncoprotein, which is found in aggressive acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, confers megakaryocytic identity via the GLIS2 moiety while both ETO2 and GLIS2 domains are required to drive increased self-renewal properties. ETO2-GLIS2 directly binds DNA to control transcription of associated genes by upregulation of expression and interaction with the ETS-related ERG protein at enhancer elements. Importantly, specific interference with ETO2-GLIS2 oligomerization reverses the transcriptional activation at enhancers and promotes megakaryocytic differentiation, providing a relevant interface to target in this poor-prognosis pediatric leukemia.

Abstract: Summary
Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and protein phosphatases comprise protein families that play crucial roles in cell signaling. We used two protein-protein interaction (PPI) approaches, the membrane yeast two-hybrid (MYTH) and the mammalian membrane two-hybrid (MaMTH), to map the PPIs between human RTKs and phosphatases. The resulting RTK-phosphatase interactome reveals a considerable number of previously unidentified interactions and suggests specific roles for different phosphatase families. Additionally, the differential PPIs of some protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) and their mutants suggest diverse mechanisms of these PTPs in the regulation of RTK signaling. We further found that PTPRH and PTPRB directly dephosphorylate EGFR and repress its downstream signaling. By contrast, PTPRA plays a dual role in EGFR signaling: besides facilitating EGFR dephosphorylation, it enhances downstream ERK signaling by activating SRC. This comprehensive RTK-phosphatase interactome study provides a broad and deep view of RTK signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy is essential for maintaining glucose homeostasis, but the mechanism by which energy deprivation activates autophagy is not fully understood. We show that Mec1/ATR, a member of the DNA damage response pathway, is essential for glucose starvation-induced autophagy. Mec1, Atg13, Atg1, and the energy-sensing kinase Snf1 are recruited to mitochondria shortly after glucose starvation. Mec1 is recruited through the adaptor protein Ggc1. Snf1 phosphorylates Mec1 on the mitochondrial surface, leading to recruitment of Atg1 to mitochondria. Furthermore, the Snf1-mediated Mec1 phosphorylation and mitochondrial recruitment of Atg1 are essential for maintaining mitochondrial respiration during glucose starvation, and active mitochondrial respiration is required for energy deprivation-activated autophagy. Thus, formation of a Snf1-Mec1-Atg1 module on mitochondria governs energy deprivation-induced autophagy by regulating mitochondrial respiration.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of multiple metabolic complications. Physical activity is known to increase mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle, counteracting age-related decline in muscle function and protecting against metabolic and cardiovascular complications. Here, we investigated the effect of 4 months of exercise training on skeletal muscle mitochondria electron transport chain complexes and supercomplexes in 26 healthy, sedentary older adults. Exercise differentially modulated respiratory complexes. Complex I was the most upregulated complex and not stoichiometrically associated to the other complexes. In contrast to the other complexes, complex I was almost exclusively found assembled in supercomplexes in muscle mitochondria. Overall, supercomplex content was increased after exercise. In particular, complexes I, III, and IV were redistributed to supercomplexes in the form of I+III2+IV. Taken together, our results provide the first evidence that exercise affects the stoichiometry of supercomplex formation in humans and thus reveal a novel adaptive mechanism for increased energy demand.

Abstract: Summary
Stem cell transplants offer significant hope for brain repair following ischemic damage. Pre-clinical work suggests that therapeutic mechanisms may be multi-faceted, incorporating bone-fide circuit reconstruction by transplanted neurons, but also protection/regeneration of host circuitry. Here, we engineered hydrogel scaffolds to form “bio-bridges” within the necrotic lesion cavity, providing physical and trophic support to transplanted human embryonic stem cell-derived cortical progenitors, as well as residual host neurons. Scaffolds were fabricated by the self-assembly of peptides for a laminin-derived epitope (IKVAV), thereby mimicking the brain’s major extracellular protein. Following focal ischemia in rats, scaffold-supported cell transplants induced progressive motor improvements over 9 months, compared to cell- or scaffold-only implants. These grafts were larger, exhibited greater neuronal differentiation, and showed enhanced electrophysiological properties reflective of mature, integrated neurons. Varying graft timing post-injury enabled us to attribute repair to both neuroprotection and circuit replacement. These findings highlight strategies to improve the efficiency of stem cell grafts for brain repair.

Abstract: Summary
Unimolecular dual incretins derived from hybridized glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) sequences have demonstrated synergistic reduction of adiposity in animal models and reductions of hyperglycemia in short-duration human trials. Here, we extend the characterization of NNC0090-2746 (also known as RG7697), a fatty-acylated dual agonist possessing in vitro balanced GIPR and GLP-1R agonism. In this 12-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase 2a trial, patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin received 1.8 mg of NNC0090-2746 or placebo subcutaneously once daily. Liraglutide 1.8 mg (Victoza), starting with 2-week dose escalation, was administered subcutaneously once daily as an open-label reference arm. Measurements were collected at regular intervals after randomization. NNC0090-2746 significantly improved glycemic control and reduced body weight compared with placebo. Total cholesterol, alone among a range of lipid parameters, and leptin were both significantly reduced compared with placebo. Treatment with NNC0090-2746 was generally safe and well tolerated.

Abstract: Summary
During pancreatic development, proliferating pancreatic progenitors activate the proendocrine transcription factor neurogenin 3 (NEUROG3), exit the cell cycle, and differentiate into islet cells. The mechanisms that direct robust NEUROG3 expression within a subset of progenitor cells control the size of the endocrine population. Here we demonstrate that NEUROG3 is phosphorylated within the nucleus on serine 183, which catalyzes its hyperphosphorylation and proteosomal degradation. During progression through the progenitor cell cycle, NEUROG3 phosphorylation is driven by the actions of cyclin-dependent kinases 2 and 4/6 at G1/S cell-cycle checkpoint. Using models of mouse and human pancreas development, we show that lengthening of the G1 phase of the pancreatic progenitor cell cycle is essential for proper induction of NEUROG3 and initiation of endocrine cell differentiation. In sum, these studies demonstrate that progenitor cell-cycle G1 lengthening, through its actions on stabilization of NEUROG3, is an essential variable in normal endocrine cell genesis.

Abstract: Summary
Class III PI3-kinase (PI3KC3) is essential for autophagy initiation, but whether PI3KC3 participates in other steps of autophagy remains unknown. The HOPS complex mediates the fusion of intracellular vesicles to lysosome, but how HOPS specifically tethers autophagosome to lysosome remains elusive. Here, we report Pacer (protein associated with UVRAG as autophagy enhancer) as a regulator of autophagy. Pacer localizes to autophagic structures and positively regulates autophagosome maturation. Mechanistically, Pacer antagonizes Rubicon to stimulate Vps34 kinase activity. Next, Pacer recruits PI3KC3 and HOPS complexes to the autophagosome for their site-specific activation by anchoring to the autophagosomal SNARE Stx17. Furthermore, Pacer is crucial for the degradation of hepatic lipid droplets, the suppression of Salmonella infection, and the clearance of protein aggregates. These results not only identify Pacer as a crucial multifunctional enhancer in autophagy but also uncover both the involvement of PI3KC3 and the mediators of HOPS’s specific tethering activity in autophagosome maturation.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear receptors recruit multiple coactivators sequentially to activate transcription. This “ordered” recruitment allows different coactivator activities to engage the nuclear receptor complex at different steps of transcription. Estrogen receptor (ER) recruits steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC-3) primary coactivator and secondary coactivators, p300/CBP and CARM1. CARM1 recruitment lags behind the binding of SRC-3 and p300 to ER. Combining cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure analysis and biochemical approaches, we demonstrate that there is a close crosstalk between early- and late-recruited coactivators. The sequential recruitment of CARM1 not only adds a protein arginine methyltransferase activity to the ER-coactivator complex, it also alters the structural organization of the pre-existing ERE/ERα/SRC-3/p300 complex. It induces a p300 conformational change and significantly increases p300 HAT activity on histone H3K18 residues, which, in turn, promotes CARM1 methylation activity on H3R17 residues to enhance transcriptional activity. This study reveals a structural role for a coactivator sequential recruitment and biochemical process in ER-mediated transcription.

Abstract: Summary
Increased pro-inflammatory signaling is a hallmark of metabolic dysfunction in obesity and diabetes. Although both inflammatory and energy substrate handling processes represent critical layers of metabolic control, their molecular integration sites remain largely unknown. Here, we identify the heterodimerization interface between the α and β subunits of transcription factor GA-binding protein (GAbp) as a negative target of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) signaling. TNF-α prevented GAbpα and β complex formation via reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to the non-energy-dependent transcriptional inactivation of AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) β1, which was identified as a direct hepatic GAbp target. Impairment of AMPKβ1, in turn, elevated downstream cellular cholesterol biosynthesis, and hepatocyte-specific ablation of GAbpα induced systemic hypercholesterolemia and early macro-vascular lesion formation in mice. As GAbpα and AMPKβ1 levels were also found to correlate in obese human patients, the ROS-GAbp-AMPK pathway may represent a key component of a hepato-vascular axis in diabetic long-term complications.

Abstract: Summary
R loop, a transcription intermediate containing RNA:DNA hybrids and displaced single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), has emerged as a major source of genomic instability. RNaseH1, which cleaves the RNA in RNA:DNA hybrids, plays an important role in R loop suppression. Here we show that replication protein A (RPA), an ssDNA-binding protein, interacts with RNaseH1 and colocalizes with both RNaseH1 and R loops in cells. In vitro, purified RPA directly enhances the association of RNaseH1 with RNA:DNA hybrids and stimulates the activity of RNaseH1 on R loops. An RPA binding-defective RNaseH1 mutant is not efficiently stimulated by RPA in vitro, fails to accumulate at R loops in cells, and loses the ability to suppress R loops and associated genomic instability. Thus, in addition to sensing DNA damage and replication stress, RPA is a sensor of R loops and a regulator of RNaseH1, extending the versatile role of RPA in suppression of genomic instability.

Abstract: Summary
In rodents and humans, the liver can efficiently restore its mass after hepatectomy. This is largely attributed to the proliferation and cell cycle re-entry of hepatocytes. On the other hand, bone marrow cells (BMCs) migrate into the liver after resection. Here, we find that a block of BMC recruitment into the liver severely impairs its regeneration after the surgery. Mobilized hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in the resected liver can fuse with hepatocytes, and the hybrids proliferate earlier than the hepatocytes. Genetic ablation of the hybrids severely impairs hepatocyte proliferation and liver mass regeneration. Mathematical modeling reveals a key role of bone marrow (BM)-derived hybrids to drive proliferation in the regeneration process, and predicts regeneration efficiency in experimentally non-testable conditions. In conclusion, BM-derived hybrids are essential to trigger efficient liver regeneration after hepatectomy.

Abstract: Low back pain is a major public health issue in the Western world, one main cause is believed to be intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration. To halt/diminish IVD degeneration, cell therapy using different biomaterials e.g. hydrogels as cell carriers has been suggested. In this study, two different hydrogels were examined (in vitro) as potential cell carriers for human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) intended for IVD transplantation. The aim was to investigate cell-survival and chondrogenic differentiation of hMSCs when cultured in hydrogels Puramatrix® or Hydromatrix® and potential effects of stimulation with growth hormone (GH). hMSCs/hydrogel cultures were investigated for cell-viability, attachment, gene expression of chondrogenic markers SOX9, COL2A1, ACAN and accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM). In both hydrogel types, hMSCs were viable for 28days, expressed integrin β1 which indicates adhesion of hMSCs. Differentiation was observed into chondrocyte-like cells, in a higher extent in hMSCs/Hydromatrix® cultures when compared to hMSCs/Puramatrix® hydrogel cultures. Gene expression analyses of chondrogenic markers verified results. hMSCs/hydrogel cultures stimulated with GH displayed no significant effects on chondrogenesis. In conclusion, both hydrogels, especially Hydromatrix® was demonstrated as a promising cell carrier in vitro for hMSCs, when directed into chondrogenesis. This knowledge could be useful in biological approaches for regeneration of degenerated human IVDs.

Abstract: It has been suggested that metastasis-associated proteins 1 and 2 (MTA1 and MTA2) are capable of suppressing estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) transactivation activity in breast cancer cells. ERα, which is present in the epididymis, is a crucial mediator of maintaining the luminal environment necessary for proper sperm maturation and function. The present study was undertaken to analyze the expression profile of both MTA1 and MTA2 in the epididymis of rats and to ascertain whether MTA1/2 colocalizes with ERα in the epididymis and primary cultured epididymal epithelial cells. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blotting and immunohistochemistry analyses were utilized to demonstrate that MTA1 and MTA2 are expressed in the epididymis. Furthermore, these analyses revealed that MTA1 and MTA2 are predominantly localized in the nuclei of almost all epididymal epithelial cells. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that MTA1/2 colocalizes with ERα in epididymal epithelial cells. In conclusion, MTA1 and MTA2 are expressed in the epididymis of rats; these proteins colocalize with ERα in epididymal epithelial cells, suggesting that MTA1 and MTA2 may be involved in the regulation of ERα transactivation activity in the epididymis of rats to facilitate a stable environment in the lumen.

Abstract: Summary
Pat1 RNA-binding proteins, enriched in processing bodies (P bodies), are key players in cytoplasmic 5′ to 3′ mRNA decay, activating decapping of mRNA in complex with the Lsm1-7 heptamer. Using co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence approaches coupled with RNAi, we provide evidence for a nuclear complex of Pat1b with the Lsm2-8 heptamer, which binds to the spliceosomal U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA). Furthermore, we establish the set of interactions connecting Pat1b/Lsm2-8/U6 snRNA/SART3 and additional U4/U6.U5 tri-small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (tri-snRNP) components in Cajal bodies, the site of snRNP biogenesis. RNA sequencing following Pat1b depletion revealed the preferential upregulation of mRNAs normally found in P bodies and enriched in 3′ UTR AU-rich elements. Changes in >180 alternative splicing events were also observed, characterized by skipping of regulated exons with weak donor sites. Our data demonstrate the dual role of a decapping enhancer in pre-mRNA processing as well as in mRNA decay via distinct nuclear and cytoplasmic Lsm complexes.

Abstract: Summary
Monitoring the membrane potential of individual neurons has uncovered how single-cell properties contribute to network processing across different brain states in neocortex. In contrast, the subthreshold modulation of hippocampal neurons by brain state has not been systematically characterized. To address this, we combined whole-cell recordings from dentate granule cells and CA1 pyramidal neurons with multisite extracellular recordings and behavioral measurements in awake mice. We show that the average membrane potential, amplitude of subthreshold fluctuations, and distance to spike threshold are all modulated by brain state. Furthermore, even within individual states, rapid variations in arousal are reflected in membrane potential fluctuations. These factors produce depolarizing ramps in the membrane potential of hippocampal neurons that precede ripples and mirror transitions to a network regime conducive for ripple generation. These results suggest that there are coordinated shifts in the subthreshold dynamics of individual neurons that underlie the transitions between distinct modes of hippocampal processing.

Abstract: Summary
Synthetic gene expression is highly sensitive to intragenic compositional context (promoter structure, spacing regions between promoter and coding sequences, and ribosome binding sites). However, much less is known about the effects of intergenic compositional context (spatial arrangement and orientation of entire genes on DNA) on expression levels in synthetic gene networks. We compare expression of induced genes arranged in convergent, divergent, or tandem orientations. Induction of convergent genes yielded up to 400% higher expression, greater ultrasensitivity, and dynamic range than divergent- or tandem-oriented genes. Orientation affects gene expression whether one or both genes are induced. We postulate that transcriptional interference in divergent and tandem genes, mediated by supercoiling, can explain differences in expression and validate this hypothesis through modeling and in vitro supercoiling relaxation experiments. Treatment with gyrase abrogated intergenic context effects, bringing expression levels within 30% of each other. We rebuilt the toggle switch with convergent genes, taking advantage of supercoiling effects to improve threshold detection and switch stability.

The Conserved Intron Binding Protein EMB-4 Plays Differential Roles in Germline Small RNA Pathways of C. elegans,

Abstract: Summary
Proper regulation of the germline transcriptome is essential for fertility. In C. elegans, germline homeostasis hinges on a complex repertoire of both silencing and activating small RNA pathways, along with RNA processing. However, our understanding of how fundamental RNA processing steps intersect with small RNA machineries in the germline remains limited. Here, we link the conserved intron binding protein, EMB-4/AQR/IBP160, to the CSR-1 and HRDE-1 nuclear 22G-RNA pathways in the C. elegans germline. Loss of emb-4 leads to distinct alterations in CSR-1- versus HRDE-1-associated small RNA and mRNA transcriptomes. Our transcriptome-wide analysis shows that EMB-4 is enriched along pre-mRNAs of nearly 8,000 transcripts. While EMB-4 complexes are enriched for both intronic and exonic sequences of HRDE-1 targets, CSR-1 pathway targets are enriched for intronic, but not exonic, sequences. These data suggest that EMB-4 could contribute to a molecular signature that distinguishes the targets of these two germline small RNA pathways.

Abstract: The Na+/H+ exchanger is responsible for maintaining the acidic tumor microenvironment through its promotion of the reabsorption of extracellular Na+ and the extrusion of intracellular H+. The resultant increase in the extracellular acidity contributes to the chemoresistance of malignant tumors. In this study, the chemosensitizing effects of cariporide, a potent Na+/H+-exchange inhibitor, were evaluated in human malignant mesothelioma H-2452 cells preadapted with lactic acid. A higher basal level of phosphorylated (p)-AKT protein was found in the acid-tolerable H-2452AcT cells compared with their parental acid-sensitive H-2452 cells. When introduced in H-2452AcT cells with a concentration that shows only a slight toxicity in H-2452 cells, cariporide exhibited growth-suppressive and apoptosis-promoting activities, as demonstrated by an increase in the cells with pyknotic and fragmented nuclei, annexin V-PE(+) staining, a sub-G0/G1 peak, and a G2/M phase-transition delay in the cell cycle. Preceding these changes, a cariporide-induced p-AKT down-regulation, a p53 up-regulation, an ROS accumulation, and the depolarization of the mitochondrial-membrane potential were observed. A pretreatment with the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 markedly augmented the DNA damage caused by the cariporide, as indicated by a much greater extent of comet tails and a tail moment with increased levels of the p-histone H2A.X, p-ATMSer1981, p-ATRSer428, p-CHK1Ser345, and p-CHK2Thr68, as well as a series of pro-apoptotic events. The data suggest that an inhibition of the PI3K/AKT signaling is necessary to enhance the cytotoxicity toward the acid-tolerable H-2452AcT cells, and it underlines the significance of proton-pump targeting as a potential therapeutic strategy to overcome the acidic-microenvironment-associated chemotherapeutic resistance.

Abstract: Summary
The histone deacetylase HDAC2, which negatively regulates synaptic gene expression and neuronal plasticity, is upregulated in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients and mouse models. Therapeutics targeting HDAC2 hold promise for ameliorating AD-related cognitive impairment; however, attempts to generate HDAC2-specific inhibitors have failed. Here, we take an integrative genomics approach to identify proteins that mediate HDAC2 recruitment to synaptic plasticity genes. Functional screening revealed that knockdown of the transcription factor Sp3 phenocopied HDAC2 knockdown and that Sp3 facilitated recruitment of HDAC2 to synaptic genes. Importantly, like HDAC2, Sp3 expression was elevated in AD patients and mouse models, where Sp3 knockdown ameliorated synaptic dysfunction. Furthermore, exogenous expression of an HDAC2 fragment containing the Sp3-binding domain restored synaptic plasticity and memory in a mouse model with severe neurodegeneration. Our findings indicate that targeting the HDAC2-Sp3 complex could enhance cognitive function without affecting HDAC2 function in other processes.

Abstract: Summary
Bacterial genes that change in expression upon environmental disturbance have commonly been seen as those that must also phenotypically matter. However, several studies suggest that differentially expressed genes are rarely phenotypically important. We demonstrate, for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, that these seemingly uncoordinated gene sets are involved in responses that can be linked through topological network analysis. However, the level of coordination is stress dependent. While a well-coordinated response is triggered in response to nutrient stress, antibiotics trigger an uncoordinated response in which transcriptionally and phenotypically important genes are neither linked spatially nor in their magnitude. Moreover, a gene expression meta-analysis reveals that genes with large fitness changes during stress have low transcriptional variation across hundreds of other conditions, and vice versa. Our work suggests that cellular responses can be understood through network models that incorporate regulatory and genetic relationships, which could aid drug target predictions and genetic network engineering.

Abstract: Summary
Enhancer activation is a critical step for gene activation. Here we report an epigenetic crosstalk at enhancers between the UTX (H3K27 demethylase)-MLL4 (H3K4 methyltransferase) complex and the histone acetyltransferase p300. We demonstrate that UTX, in a demethylase activity-independent manner, facilitates conversion of inactive enhancers in embryonic stem cells to an active (H3K4me1+/H3K27ac+) state by recruiting and coupling the enzymatic functions of MLL4 and p300. Loss of UTX leads to attenuated enhancer activity, characterized by reduced levels of H3K4me1 and H3K27ac as well as impaired transcription. The UTX-MLL4 complex enhances p300-dependent H3K27 acetylation through UTX-dependent stimulation of p300 recruitment, while MLL4-mediated H3K4 monomethylation, reciprocally, requires p300 function. Importantly, MLL4-generated H3K4me1 further enhances p300-dependent transcription. This work reveals a previously unrecognized cooperativity among enhancer-associated chromatin modulators, including a unique function for UTX, in establishing an “active enhancer landscape” and defines a detailed mechanism for the joint deposition of H3K4me1 and H3K27ac.

Abstract: Summary
PARK2 is a gene implicated in disease states with opposing responses in cell fate determination, yet its contribution in pro-survival signaling is largely unknown. Here we show that PARK2 is altered in over a third of all human cancers, and its depletion results in enhanced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt (PI3K/Akt) activation and increased vulnerability to PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors. PARK2 depletion contributes to AMPK-mediated activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), enhanced levels of reactive oxygen species, and a concomitant increase in oxidized nitric oxide levels, thereby promoting the inhibition of PTEN by S-nitrosylation and ubiquitination. Notably, AMPK activation alone is sufficient to induce PTEN S-nitrosylation in the absence of PARK2 depletion. Park2 loss and Pten loss also display striking cooperativity to promote tumorigenesis in vivo. Together, our findings reveal an important missing mechanism that might account for PTEN suppression in PARK2-deficient tumors, and they highlight the importance of PTEN S-nitrosylation in supporting cell survival and proliferation under conditions of energy deprivation.

Abstract: Summary
How AAA+ chaperones conformationally remodel specific target proteins in an ATP-dependent manner is not well understood. Here, we investigated the mechanism of the AAA+ protein Rubisco activase (Rca) in metabolic repair of the photosynthetic enzyme Rubisco, a complex of eight large (RbcL) and eight small (RbcS) subunits containing eight catalytic sites. Rubisco is prone to inhibition by tight-binding sugar phosphates, whose removal is catalyzed by Rca. We engineered a stable Rca hexamer ring and analyzed its functional interaction with Rubisco. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange and chemical crosslinking showed that Rca structurally destabilizes elements of the Rubisco active site with remarkable selectivity. Cryo-electron microscopy revealed that Rca docks onto Rubisco over one active site at a time, positioning the C-terminal strand of RbcL, which stabilizes the catalytic center, for access to the Rca hexamer pore. The pulling force of Rca is fine-tuned to avoid global destabilization and allow for precise enzyme repair.

Abstract: Summary
A diverse T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire is essential for controlling viral infections. However, information about TCR repertoires to defined viral antigens is limited. We performed a comprehensive analysis of CD8+ TCR repertoires for two dominant viral epitopes: pp65495–503 (NLV) of cytomegalovirus and M158–66 (GIL) of influenza A virus. The highly individualized repertoires (87–5,533 α or β clonotypes per subject) comprised thousands of unique TCRα and TCRβ sequences and dozens of distinct complementary determining region (CDR)3α and CDR3β motifs. However, diversity is effectively restricted by preferential V-J combinations, CDR3 lengths, and CDR3α/CDR3β pairings. Structures of two GIL-specific TCRs bound to GIL–HLA-A2 provided a potential explanation for the lower diversity of GIL-specific versus NLV-specific repertoires. These anti-viral TCRs occupied up to 3.4% of the CD8+ TCRβ repertoire, ensuring broad T cell responses to single epitopes. Our portrait of two anti-viral TCR repertoires may inform the development of predictors of immune protection.

Abstract: Summary
H4K20 monomethylation maintains genome integrity by regulating proper mitotic condensation, DNA damage response, and replication licensing. Here, we show that, in non-dividing hepatic cells, H4K20Me1 is specifically enriched in active gene bodies and dynamically regulated by the antagonistic action of Kmt5a methylase and Kdm7b demethylase. In liver-specific Kmt5a-deficient mice, reduced levels of H4K20Me1 correlated with reduced RNA Pol II release from promoter-proximal regions. Genes regulating glucose and fatty acid metabolism were most sensitive to impairment of RNA Pol II release. Downregulation of glycolytic genes resulted in an energy starvation condition partially compensated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation and increased mitochondrial activity. This metabolic reprogramming generated a highly sensitized state that, upon different metabolic stress conditions, quickly aggravated into a senescent phenotype due to ROS overproduction-mediated oxidative DNA damage. The results illustrate how defects in the general process of RNA Pol II transition into a productive elongation phase can trigger specific metabolic changes and genome instability.

Abstract: Summary
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have been reported in naive and primed states. However, the ability to generate mature cell types remains the imperative property for utility of hPSCs. Here, we reveal that the naive state enhances self-renewal while restricting lineage differentiation in vitro to neural default fate. Molecular analyses indicate expression of multiple lineage-associated transcripts in naive hPSCs that failed to predict biased functional differentiation capacity. Naive hPSCs can be converted to primed state over long-term serial passage that permits recovery of multi-germ layer differentiation. Suppression of OCT4 but not NANOG allows immediate recovery directly from naive state. To this end, we identified chemical inhibitors of OCT4 that restore naive hPSC differentiation. Our study reveals unique cell-fate restrictions in human pluripotent states and provides an approach to overcome these barriers that harness both efficient naive hPSC growth while maintaining in vitro differentiation essential for hPSC applications.

Abstract: Summary
The first epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) occurs in trophoblast stem (TS) cells during implantation. Inactivation of the serine/threonine kinase MAP3K4 in TS cells (TSKI4 cells) induces an intermediate state of EMT, where cells retain stemness, lose epithelial markers, and gain mesenchymal characteristics. Investigation of relationships among MAP3K4 activity, stemness, and EMT in TS cells may reveal key regulators of EMT. Here, we show that MAP3K4 activity controls EMT through the ubiquitination and degradation of HDAC6. Loss of MAP3K4 activity in TSKI4 cells results in elevated HDAC6 expression and the deacetylation of cytoplasmic and nuclear targets. In the nucleus, HDAC6 deacetylates the promoters of tight junction genes, promoting the dissolution of tight junctions. Importantly, HDAC6 knockdown in TSKI4 cells restores epithelial features, including cell-cell adhesion and barrier formation. These data define a role for HDAC6 in regulating gene expression during transitions between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear pore complex components (Nups) have been implicated in transcriptional regulation, yet what regulatory steps are controlled by metazoan Nups remains unclear. We identified the presence of multiple Nups at promoters, enhancers, and insulators in the Drosophila genome. In line with this binding, we uncovered a functional role for Nup98 in mediating enhancer-promoter looping at ecdysone-inducible genes. These genes were found to be stably associated with nuclear pores before and after activation. Although changing levels of Nup98 disrupted enhancer-promoter contacts, it did not affect ongoing transcription but instead compromised subsequent transcriptional activation or transcriptional memory. In support of the enhancer-looping role, we found Nup98 to gain and retain physical interactions with architectural proteins upon stimulation with ecdysone. Together, our data identify Nups as a class of architectural proteins for enhancers and supports a model in which animal genomes use the nuclear pore as an organizing scaffold for inducible poised genes.

Abstract: Summary
Maintaining posture requires tight regulation of the position and orientation of numerous spinal components. Yet, surprisingly little is known about this regulatory mechanism, whose failure may result in spinal deformity as in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Here, we use genetic mouse models to demonstrate the involvement of proprioception in regulating spine alignment. Null mutants for Runx3 transcription factor, which lack TrkC neurons connecting between proprioceptive mechanoreceptors and spinal cord, developed peripubertal scoliosis not preceded by vertebral dysplasia or muscle asymmetry. Deletion of Runx3 in the peripheral nervous system or specifically in peripheral sensory neurons, or of enhancer elements driving Runx3 expression in proprioceptive neurons, induced a similar phenotype. Egr3 knockout mice, lacking muscle spindles, but not Golgi tendon organs, displayed a less severe phenotype, suggesting that both receptor types may be required for this regulatory mechanism. These findings uncover a central role for the proprioceptive system in maintaining spinal alignment.

Abstract: Phytocystatins (PhyCYSs) are plant-specific proteinaceous inhibitors that are implicated in protein turnover and stress responses. Here, we characterized a PhyCYS from Arabidopsis thaliana, which was designated AtCYS5. RT-qPCR analysis showed that the expression of AtCYS5 in germinating seeds was induced by heat stress (HS) and exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. Analysis of the expression of the β-glucuronidase reporter gene under the control of the AtCYS5 promoter showed that AtCYS5 expression during seed germination was induced by HS and ABA. Constitutive overexpression of AtCYS5 driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter led to enhanced HS tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis, which was characterized by higher fresh weight and root length compared to wild-type (WT) and knockout (cys5) plants grown under HS conditions. The HS tolerance of At-CYS5-overexpressing transgenic plants was associated with increased insensitivity to exogenous ABA during both seed germination and post-germination compared to WT and cys5. Although no HS elements were identified in the 5′-flanking region of AtCYS5, canonical ABA-responsive elements (ABREs) were detected. AtCYS5 was upregulated in ABA-treated protoplasts transiently co-expressing this gene and genes encoding bZIP ABRE-binding factors (ABFs and AREB3). In the absence of ABA, ABF1 and ABF3 directly bound to the ABREs in the AtCYS5 promoter, which activated the transcription of this gene in the presence of ABA. These results suggest that an ABA-dependent pathway plays a positive role in the HS-responsive expression of AtCYS5 during seed germination and post-germination growth.

Abstract: Summary
Circadian clocks are self-sustainable endogenous oscillators, present in virtually every cell, driving daily cycles of metabolism and physiology. The molecular mechanism of the circadian clock is based on interconnected transcriptional and translational feedback loops. While many studies have addressed circadian rhythms of the transcriptome and, to a lesser extent, the proteome, none have investigated the phosphoproteome. We apply mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics to obtain the first global in vivo quantification of circadian phosphorylation in mammals. Of more than 20,000 phosphosites, 25% significantly oscillate in the mouse liver, including novel sites on core clock proteins. The extent and amplitude of phosphorylation cycles far exceeds those observed in RNA and protein abundance. Our data indicate a dominant regulatory role for phosphorylation-dependent circadian tuning of signaling pathways. This allows the organism to integrate different signals and rapidly and economically respond to daily changes in nutrient availability and physiological states.

Abstract: Background
Chronic wounds present a major challenge in modern medicine. Even under optimal conditions, the healing process may lead to scarring and fibrosis. The ability of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to differentiate into other cell types makes these cells an attractive therapeutic tool for cell transplantation. Both tissue-engineered construct and MSC therapy are among the current wound healing procedures and potential care. Chitosan has been widely applied in tissue engineering because of its biocompatibility and biodegradability.
Aim
The aim of the current work was to compare the efficiency of MSCs and chitosan dressing, alone or in combination treatment on wound healing.
Methods
This study was conducted on 15 rabbits, which were randomly divided in 3 groups based on the type of treatment with MSCs, chitosan dressing and combination of both. A full–thickness skin defect was excised from the right and left side of the back of each animals. Defects on right sides were filled with treatments and left side defects were left as control. Evaluation of the therapeutic effectiveness was performed through a variety of clinical and microscopical evaluations and measurements of the process of wound healing on days 7, 14, 21, and 28. Histological evaluation of wound healing was classified by different scoring systems.
Results
The data indicated that wounds treated with bone marrow derived MSC had enhanced cellularity and better epidermal regeneration. During the early stages of wound healing, the closure rate of bone marrow derived MSC-treated wounds were significantly higher than other treatments (P<0.05). Although the MSCs in the wound edges enhance the healing of the full–thickness wound, the healing process of chitosan treatment was slower than the control group.
Conclusion
This study revealed advanced granulation tissue formation and epithelialization in wounds treated with MSCs, and may suggests this treatment as an effective applicant in wound healing process. Chitosan scaffold dressings, whether alone or in combination with MSCs, have worsened the wound healing as compared to the control group.

Abstract: Summary
Histone replacement by transition proteins (TPs) and protamines (Prms) constitutes an essential step for the successful production of functional male gametes, yet nothing is known on the underlying functional interplay between histones, TPs, and Prms. Here, by studying spermatogenesis in the absence of a spermatid-specific histone variant, H2A.L.2, we discover a fundamental mechanism involved in the transformation of nucleosomes into nucleoprotamines. H2A.L.2 is synthesized at the same time as TPs and enables their loading onto the nucleosomes. TPs do not displace histones but rather drive the recruitment and processing of Prms, which are themselves responsible for histone eviction. Altogether, the incorporation of H2A.L.2 initiates and orchestrates a series of successive transitional states that ultimately shift to the fully compacted genome of the mature spermatozoa. Hence, the current view of histone-to-nucleoprotamine transition should be revisited and include an additional step with H2A.L.2 assembly prior to the action of TPs and Prms.

Abstract: Summary
Insulin resistance is a chronic inflammatory condition accompanying obesity or high fat diets that leads to type 2 diabetes. It is hypothesized that lipids and gut bacterial compounds in particular contribute to metabolic inflammation by activating the immune system; however, the receptors detecting these “instigators” of inflammation remain largely undefined. Here, we show that circulating activators of NOD1, a receptor for bacterial peptidoglycan, increase with high fat feeding in mice, suggesting that NOD1 could be a critical sensor leading to metabolic inflammation. Hematopoietic depletion of NOD1 did not prevent weight gain but protected chimeric mice against diet-induced glucose and insulin intolerance. Mechanistically, while macrophage infiltration of adipose tissue persisted, notably these cells were less pro-inflammatory, had lower CXCL1 production, and consequently, lower neutrophil chemoattraction into the tissue. These findings reveal macrophage NOD1 as a cell-specific target to combat diet-induced inflammation past the step of macrophage infiltration, leading to insulin resistance.

Abstract: Summary
The eukaryotic genome is organized within cells as chromatin. For proper information output, higher-order chromatin structures can be regulated dynamically. How such structures form and behave in various cellular processes remains unclear. Here, by combining super-resolution imaging (photoactivated localization microscopy [PALM]) and single-nucleosome tracking, we developed a nuclear imaging system to visualize the higher-order structures along with their dynamics in live mammalian cells. We demonstrated that nucleosomes form compact domains with a peak diameter of ∼160 nm and move coherently in live cells. The heterochromatin-rich regions showed more domains and less movement. With cell differentiation, the domains became more apparent, with reduced dynamics. Furthermore, various perturbation experiments indicated that they are organized by a combination of factors, including cohesin and nucleosome-nucleosome interactions. Notably, we observed the domains during mitosis, suggesting that they act as building blocks of chromosomes and may serve as information units throughout the cell cycle.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer evolves through the emergence and selection of molecular alterations. Cancer genome profiling has revealed that specific events are more or less likely to be co-selected, suggesting that the selection of one event depends on the others. However, the nature of these evolutionary dependencies and their impact remain unclear. Here, we designed SELECT, an algorithmic approach to systematically identify evolutionary dependencies from alteration patterns. By analyzing 6,456 genomes from multiple tumor types, we constructed a map of oncogenic dependencies associated with cellular pathways, transcriptional readouts, and therapeutic response. Finally, modeling of cancer evolution shows that alteration dependencies emerge only under conditional selection. These results provide a framework for the design of strategies to predict cancer progression and therapeutic response.

Abstract: Summary
The hypothalamus is one of the most complex brain structures involved in homeostatic regulation. Defining cell composition and identifying cell-type-specific transcriptional features of the hypothalamus is essential for understanding its functions and related disorders. Here, we report single-cell RNA sequencing results of adult mouse hypothalamus, which defines 11 non-neuronal and 34 neuronal cell clusters with distinct transcriptional signatures. Analyses of cell-type-specific transcriptomes reveal gene expression dynamics underlying oligodendrocyte differentiation and tanycyte subtypes. Additionally, data analysis provides a comprehensive view of neuropeptide expression across hypothalamic neuronal subtypes and uncover Crabp1+ and Pax6+ neuronal populations in specific hypothalamic sub-regions. Furthermore, we found food deprivation exhibited differential transcriptional effects among the different neuronal subtypes, suggesting functional specification of various neuronal subtypes. Thus, the work provides a comprehensive transcriptional perspective of adult hypothalamus, which serves as a valuable resource for dissecting cell-type-specific functions of this complex brain region.

Abstract: Summary
The understanding of interaction dynamics in signaling pathways can shed light on pathway architecture and provide insights into targets for intervention. Here, we explored the relevance of kinetic rate constants of a key upstream osmosensor in the yeast high-osmolarity glycerol-mitogen-activated protein kinase (HOG-MAPK) pathway to signaling output responses. We created mutant pairs of the Sln1-Ypd1 complex interface that caused major compensating changes in the association (kon) and dissociation (koff) rate constants (kinetic perturbations) but only moderate changes in the overall complex affinity (Kd). Yeast cells carrying a Sln1-Ypd1 mutant pair with moderate increases in kon and koff displayed a lower threshold of HOG pathway activation than wild-type cells. Mutants with higher kon and koff rates gave rise to higher basal signaling and gene expression but impaired osmoadaptation. Thus, the kon and koff rates of the components in the Sln1 osmosensor determine proper signaling dynamics and osmoadaptation.

Abstract: Summary
The 22 γ-Protocadherin (γ-Pcdh) cell adhesion molecules are critical for the elaboration of complex dendritic arbors in the cerebral cortex. Here, we provide evidence that the γ-Pcdhs negatively regulate synapse development by inhibiting the postsynaptic cell adhesion molecule, neuroligin-1 (Nlg1). Mice lacking all γ-Pcdhs in the forebrain exhibit significantly increased dendritic spine density in vivo, while spine density is significantly decreased in mice overexpressing one of the 22 γ-Pcdh isoforms. Co-expression of γ-Pcdhs inhibits the ability of Nlg1 to increase spine density and to induce presynaptic differentiation in hippocampal neurons in vitro. The γ-Pcdhs physically interact in cis with Nlg1 both in vitro and in vivo, and we present evidence that this disrupts Nlg1 binding to its presynaptic partner neurexin1β. Together with prior work, these data identify a mechanism through which γ-Pcdhs could coordinate dendrite arbor growth and complexity with spine maturation in the developing brain.

Abstract: Summary
The guanidyl moiety is a component of fundamental metabolites, including the amino acid arginine, the energy carrier creatine, and the nucleobase guanine. Curiously, reports regarding the importance of free guanidine in biology are sparse, and no biological receptors that specifically recognize this compound have been previously identified. We report that many members of the ykkC motif RNA, the longest unresolved riboswitch candidate, naturally sense and respond to guanidine. This RNA is found throughout much of the bacterial domain of life, where it commonly controls the expression of proteins annotated as urea carboxylases and multidrug efflux pumps. Our analyses reveal that these proteins likely function as guanidine carboxylases and guanidine transporters, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that bacteria are capable of endogenously producing guanidine. These and related findings demonstrate that free guanidine is a biologically relevant compound, and several gene families that can alleviate guanidine toxicity exist.

Abstract: Summary
Signaling networks downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases are among the most extensively studied biological networks, but new approaches are needed to elucidate causal relationships between network components and understand how such relationships are influenced by biological context and disease. Here, we investigate the context specificity of signaling networks within a causal conceptual framework using reverse-phase protein array time-course assays and network analysis approaches. We focus on a well-defined set of signaling proteins profiled under inhibition with five kinase inhibitors in 32 contexts: four breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, UACC812, BT20, and BT549) under eight stimulus conditions. The data, spanning multiple pathways and comprising ∼70,000 phosphoprotein and ∼260,000 protein measurements, provide a wealth of testable, context-specific hypotheses, several of which we experimentally validate. Furthermore, the data provide a unique resource for computational methods development, permitting empirical assessment of causal network learning in a complex, mammalian setting.

Abstract: Summary
Dietary interventions dramatically affect metabolic disease and lifespan in various aging models. Here, we profiled liver microRNA (miRNA), coding, and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) expression by high-throughput deep sequencing in mice across multiple energy intake and expenditure interventions. Strikingly, three dietary intervention network design patterns were uncovered: (1) lifespan-extending interventions largely repressed the expression of miRNAs, lncRNAs, and transposable elements; (2) protein-coding mRNAs with expression positively correlated with long lifespan are highly targeted by miRNAs; and (3) miRNA-targeting interactions mainly target chromatin-related functions. We experimentally validated miR-34a, miR-107, and miR-212-3p targeting of the chromatin remodeler Chd1 and further demonstrate that Chd1 knockdown mimics high-fat diet and aging-induced gene expression changes and activation of transposons. Our findings demonstrate lifespan-extending diets repress miRNA-chromatin remodeler interactions and safeguard against deregulated transcription induced by aging and lifespan shortening diets, events linked by microRNA, chromatin, and ncRNA crosstalk.

Abstract: Summary
AMPA receptors (AMPARs) mediate fast excitatory synaptic transmission and are crucial for synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. However, the molecular control of AMPAR stability and its neurophysiological significance remain unclear. Here, we report that AMPARs are subject to lysine acetylation at their C termini. Acetylation reduces AMPAR internalization and degradation, leading to increased cell-surface localization and prolonged receptor half-life. Through competition for the same lysine residues, acetylation intensity is inversely related to the levels of AMPAR ubiquitination. We find that sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) acts as an AMPAR deacetylase regulating AMPAR trafficking and proteostasis. SIRT2 knockout mice (Sirt2−/−) show marked upregulation in AMPAR acetylation and protein accumulation. Both Sirt2−/− mice and mice expressing acetylation mimetic GluA1 show aberrant synaptic plasticity, accompanied by impaired learning and memory. These findings establish SIRT2-regulated lysine acetylation as a form of AMPAR post-translational modification that regulates its turnover, as well as synaptic plasticity and cognitive function.

Abstract: Summary
Gene expression in different spatial domains is often controlled by separate cis-regulatory modules (CRMs), but regulatory states determining CRM activity are not only distinct in space, they also change continuously during developmental time. Here, we systematically analyzed the regulatory sequences controlling hox11/13b expression and identified a single CRM required throughout embryonic gut development. We show that within this CRM, distinct sets of binding sites recognizing Ets, Tcf, and homeodomain transcription factors control the dynamic spatial expression of hox11/13b in each developmental phase. Several binding sites execute multiple, sometimes contradictory, regulatory functions, depending on the temporal and spatial regulatory context. In addition, we identified a nearby second CRM operating in inter-modular AND logic with the first CRM to control hox11/13b expression in hindgut endoderm. Our results suggest a mechanism for continuous gene expression in response to changing developmental network functions that depends on sequential combinatorial regulation of individual CRMs.

Abstract: Summary
Inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT) is an ectopic lymphoid structure composed of highly organized T cell and B cell zones that forms in the lung in response to infectious or inflammatory stimuli. Here, we develop a model for fungal-mediated iBALT formation, using infection with Pneumocystis that induces development of pulmonary lymphoid follicles. Pneumocystis-dependent iBALT structure formation and organization required CXCL13 signaling. Cxcl13 expression was regulated by interleukin (IL)-17 family members, as Il17ra−/−, Il17rb−/−, and Il17rc−/− mice failed to develop iBALT. Interestingly, Il17rb−/− mice have intact Th17 responses, but failed to generate an anti-Pneumocystis Th2 response. Given a role for Th2 and Th17 immunity in iBALT formation, we demonstrated that primary pulmonary fibroblasts synergistically upregulated Cxcl13 transcription following dual stimulation with IL-13 and IL-17A in a STAT3/GATA3-dependent manner. Together, these findings uncover a role for Th2/Th17 cells in regulating Cxcl13 expression and provide an experimental model for fungal-driven iBALT formation.

Abstract: Summary
Eukaryotic chromosomal DNA is faithfully replicated in a complex series of cell-cycle-regulated events that are incompletely understood. Here we report the reconstitution of DNA replication free in solution with purified proteins from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The system recapitulates regulated bidirectional origin activation; synthesis of leading and lagging strands by the three replicative DNA polymerases Pol α, Pol δ, and Pol ε; and canonical maturation of Okazaki fragments into continuous daughter strands. We uncover a dual regulatory role for chromatin during DNA replication: promoting origin dependence and determining Okazaki fragment length by restricting Pol δ progression. This system thus provides a functional platform for the detailed mechanistic analysis of eukaryotic chromosome replication.

Adverse Effect of Superovulation Treatment on Maturation, Function and Ultrastructural Integrity of Murine Oocytes,

Abstract: Regular monitoring on experimental animal management found the fluctuation of ART outcome, which showed a necessity to explore whether superovulation treatment is responsible for such unexpected outcome. This study was subsequently conducted to examine whether superovulation treatment can preserve ultrastructural integrity and developmental competence of oocytes following oocyte activation and embryo culture. A randomized study using mouse model was designed and in vitro development (experiment 1), ultrastructural morphology (experiment 2) and functional integrity of the oocytes (experiment 3) retrieved after PMSG/hCG injection (superovulation group) or not (natural ovulation; control group) were evaluated. In experiment 1, more oocytes were retrieved following superovulation than following natural ovulation, but natural ovulation yielded higher (p < 0.0563) maturation rate than superovulation. The capacity of mature oocytes to form pronucleus and to develop into blastocysts in vitro was similar. In experiment 2, a notable (p < 0.0186) increase in mitochondrial deformity, characterized by the formation of vacuolated mitochondria, was detected in the superovulation group. Multivesicular body formation was also increased, whereas early endosome formation was significantly decreased. No obvious changes in other microorganelles, however, were detected, which included the formation and distribution of mitochondria, cortical granules, microvilli, and smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum. In experiment 3, significant decreases in mitochondrial activity, ATP production and dextran uptake were detected in the superovulation group. In conclusion, superovulation treatment may change both maturational status and functional and ultrastuctural integrity of oocytes. Superovulation effect on preimplantation development can be discussed.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR-Cas systems are prokaryotic immune systems against invading nucleic acids. Type I CRISPR-Cas systems employ highly diverse, multi-subunit surveillance Cascade complexes that facilitate duplex formation between crRNA and complementary target DNA for R-loop formation, retention, and DNA degradation by the subsequently recruited nuclease Cas3. Typically, the large subunit recognizes bona fide targets through the PAM (protospacer adjacent motif), and the small subunit guides the non-target DNA strand. Here, we present the Apo- and target-DNA-bound structures of the I-Fv (type I-F variant) Cascade lacking the small and large subunits. Large and small subunits are functionally replaced by the 5′ terminal crRNA cap Cas5fv and the backbone protein Cas7fv, respectively. Cas5fv facilitates PAM recognition from the DNA major groove site, in contrast to all other described type I systems. Comparison of the type I-Fv Cascade with an anti-CRISPR protein-bound I-F Cascade reveals that the type I-Fv structure differs substantially at known anti-CRISPR protein target sites and might therefore be resistant to viral Cascade interception.

Abstract: Summary
Target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) regulates cell growth in response to nutrients and growth factors. Although TORC1 signaling has been thoroughly studied at the cellular level, the regulation of TORC1 in multicellular tissues and organs has remained elusive. Here we found that TORC1 is selectively activated in the second mitotic wave (SMW), the terminal synchronous cell division, of the developing Drosophila eye. We demonstrated that Hedgehog (Hh) signaling regulates TORC1 through E2F1 and the cyclin D/Cdk4 complex in the SMW, and this regulation is independent from insulin and amino acid signaling pathways. TORC1 is necessary for the proper G1/S transition of the cells, and the activation of TORC1 rescues the cell-cycle defect of Hh signaling-deficient cells in the SMW. Based on this evolutionarily conserved regulation of TORC1 by Hh signaling, we propose that Hh-dependent developmental signaling pathways spatially regulate TORC1 activity in multicellular organisms.

Abstract: Summary
The development and function of epithelia depend on the establishment and maintenance of cell-cell adhesion and intercellular junctions, which operate as mechanosensor hubs for the transduction of biochemical signals regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and regeneration. Here, we show that αE-catenin, a key component of adherens junctions, functions as a positive regulator of pancreatic islet cell lineage differentiation by repressing the sonic hedgehog pathway (SHH). Thus, deletion of αE-catenin in multipotent pancreatic progenitors resulted in (1) loss of adherens junctions, (2) constitutive activation of SHH, (3) decrease in islet cell lineage differentiation, and (4) accumulation of immature Sox9+ progenitors. Pharmacological blockade of SHH signaling in pancreatic organ cultures and in vivo rescued this defect, allowing αE-catenin-null Sox9+ pancreatic progenitors to differentiate into endocrine cells. The results uncover crucial functions of αE-catenin in pancreatic islet development and harbor significant implications for the design of β cell replacement and regeneration therapies in diabetes.
