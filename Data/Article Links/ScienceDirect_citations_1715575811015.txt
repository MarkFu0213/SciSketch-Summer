Abstract: Summary
De novo beige adipocyte biogenesis involves the proliferation of progenitor cells in white adipose tissue (WAT); however, what regulates this process remains unclear. Here, we report that in mouse models but also in human tissues, WAT lipolysis-derived linoleic acid triggers beige progenitor cell proliferation following cold acclimation, β3-adrenoceptor activation, and burn injury. A subset of adipocyte progenitors, as marked by cell surface markers PDGFRα or Sca1 and CD81, harbored cristae-rich mitochondria and actively imported linoleic acid via a fatty acid transporter CD36. Linoleic acid not only was oxidized as fuel in the mitochondria but also was utilized for the synthesis of arachidonic acid-derived signaling entities such as prostaglandin D2. Oral supplementation of linoleic acid was sufficient to stimulate beige progenitor cell proliferation, even under thermoneutral conditions, in a CD36-dependent manner. Together, this study provides mechanistic insights into how diverse pathophysiological stimuli, such as cold and burn injury, promote de novo beige fat biogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic networks should respond to signals but prevent the transmission of spontaneous fluctuations. Limited data from mammalian cells suggest that noise transmission is uncommon, but systematic claims about noise transmission have been limited by the inability to directly measure it. Here, we build a mathematical framework modeling allelic correlation and noise transmission, showing that allelic correlation and noise transmission correspond across model parameters and network architectures. Limiting noise transmission comes with the trade-off of being unresponsive to signals, and within responsive regimes, there is a further trade-off between response time and basal noise transmission. Analysis of allele-specific single-cell RNA-sequencing data revealed that genes encoding upstream factors in signaling pathways and cell-type-specific factors have higher allelic correlation than downstream factors, suggesting they are more subject to regulation. Overall, our findings suggest that some noise transmission must result from signal responsiveness, but it can be minimized by trading off for a slower response. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
Chromosomal instability (CIN) is a hallmark of cancer and comprises structural CIN (S-CIN) and numerical or whole chromosomal CIN (W-CIN). Recent work indicated that replication stress (RS), known to contribute to S-CIN, also affects mitotic chromosome segregation, possibly explaining the common co-existence of S-CIN and W-CIN in human cancer. Here, we show that RS-induced increased origin firing is sufficient to trigger W-CIN in human cancer cells. We discovered that overexpression of origin firing genes, including GINS1 and CDC45, correlates with W-CIN in human cancer specimens and causes W-CIN in otherwise chromosomally stable human cells. Furthermore, modulation of the ATR-CDK1-RIF1 axis increases the number of firing origins and leads to W-CIN. Importantly, chromosome missegregation upon additional origin firing is mediated by increased mitotic microtubule growth rates, a mitotic defect prevalent in chromosomally unstable cancer cells. Thus, our study identifies increased replication origin firing as a cancer-relevant trigger for chromosomal instability.

Abstract: Summary
Although vaccination efforts have expanded, there are still gaps in our understanding surrounding the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Measuring IgG Fc glycosylation provides insight into an infected individual’s inflammatory state, among other functions. We set out to interrogate bulk IgG glycosylation changes from SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination, using plasma from mild or hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and from vaccinated individuals. Inflammatory glycans are elevated in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and increase over time, while mild patients have anti-inflammatory glycans that increase over time, including increased sialic acid correlating with RBD antibody levels. Vaccinated individuals with low RBD antibody levels and low neutralization have the same IgG glycan traits as hospitalized COVID-19 patients. In addition, a small vaccinated cohort reveals a decrease in inflammatory glycans associated with peak IgG concentrations and neutralization. This report characterizes the bulk IgG glycome associated with COVID-19 severity and vaccine responsiveness and can help guide future studies into SARS-CoV-2 protective immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Temperate phages dynamically switch between lysis and lysogeny in their full life cycle. Some Bacillus-infecting phages utilize a quorum-sensing-like intercellular communication system, the “arbitrium,” to mediate lysis-lysogeny decisions. However, whether additional factors participate in the arbitrium signaling pathway remains largely elusive. Here, we find that the arbitrium signal induces the expression of a functionally conserved operon downstream of the arbitrium module in SPbeta-like phages. SPbeta yopM and yopR (as well as phi3T phi3T_93 and phi3T_97) in the operon play roles in suppressing phage lytic propagation and promoting lysogeny, respectively. We further focus on phi3T_93 and demonstrate that it directly binds antitoxin MazE in the host MazF/MazE toxin-antitoxin (TA) module and facilitates the activation of MazF’s toxicity, which is required for phage suppression. These findings show events regulated by the arbitrium system and shed light on how the interplay between phages and the host TA module affects phage-host co-survival.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic rewiring is essential for Th17 cells’ functional identity to sense and interpret environmental cues. However, the environmental metabolic checkpoints with specific regulation of Th17 cells, manifesting potential therapeutic opportunities to autoimmune diseases, remain largely unknown. Here, by screening more than one hundred compounds derived from intestinal microbes or diet, we found that vitamin B5 (VB5) restrains Th17 cell differentiation as well as related autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and colitis. Mechanistically, VB5 is catabolized into coenzyme A (CoA) in a pantothenate kinase (PANK)-dependent manner, and in turn, CoA binds to pyruvate kinase isoform 2 (PKM2) to impede its phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, thus inhibiting glycolysis and STAT3 phosphorylation. In humans, reduced serum VB5 levels are found in both IBD and MS patients. Collectively, our study demonstrates a role of VB5 in Th17 cell metabolic reprograming, thus providing a potential therapeutic intervention for Th17 cell-associated autoimmune diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Inadequate potassium (K+) consumption correlates with increased mortality and poor cardiovascular outcomes. Potassium effects on blood pressure have been described previously; however, whether or not low K+ independently affects kidney disease progression remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that dietary K+ deficiency causes direct kidney injury. Effects depend on reduced blood K+ and are kidney specific. In response to reduced K+, the channel Kir4.2 mediates altered proximal tubule (PT) basolateral K+ flux, causing intracellular acidosis and activation of the enzyme glutaminase and the ammoniagenesis pathway. Deletion of either Kir4.2 or glutaminase protects from low-K+ injury. Reduced K+ also mediates injury and fibrosis in a model of aldosteronism. These results demonstrate that the PT epithelium, like the distal nephron, is K+ sensitive, with reduced blood K+ causing direct PT injury. Kir4.2 and glutaminase are essential mediators of this injury process, and we identify their potential for future targeting in the treatment of chronic kidney disease.

Abstract: Summary
Spatially distant areas of the cerebral cortex coordinate their activity into networks that are integral to cognitive processing. A common structural motif of cortical networks is co-activation of frontal and posterior cortical regions. The neural circuit mechanisms underlying such widespread inter-areal cortical coordination are unclear. Using a discovery based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) approach in mouse, we observe frontal and posterior cortical regions that demonstrate significant functional connectivity with the subcortical nucleus, the claustrum. Examining whether the claustrum synaptically supports such frontoposterior cortical network architecture, we observe cortico-claustro-cortical circuits reflecting the fMRI data: significant trans-claustral synaptic connectivity from frontal cortices to posteriorly lying sensory and sensory association cortices contralaterally. These data reveal discrete cortical pathways through the claustrum that are positioned to support cortical network motifs central to cognitive control functions and add to the canon of major extended cortico-subcortico-cortical systems in the mammalian brain.

Neuronal-epithelial cross-talk drives acinar specification via NRG1-ERBB3-mTORC2 signaling,

Abstract: Summary
Acinar cells are the principal secretory units of multiple exocrine organs. A single-cell, layered, lumenized acinus forms from a large cohort of epithelial progenitors that must initiate and coordinate three cellular programs of acinar specification, namely, lineage progression, secretion, and polarization. Despite this well-known outcome, the mechanism(s) that regulate these complex programs are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that neuronal-epithelial cross-talk drives acinar specification through neuregulin (NRG1)-ERBB3-mTORC2 signaling. Using single-cell and global RNA sequencing of developing murine salivary glands, we identified NRG1-ERBB3 to precisely overlap with acinar specification during gland development. Genetic deletion of Erbb3 prevented cell lineage progression and the establishment of lumenized, secretory acini. Conversely, NRG1 treatment of isolated epithelia was sufficient to recapitulate the development of secretory acini. Mechanistically, we found that NRG1-ERBB3 regulates each developmental program through an mTORC2 signaling pathway. Thus, we reveal that a neuronal-epithelial (NRG1/ERBB3/mTORC2) mechanism orchestrates the creation of functional acini.

Abstract: Summary
To explore genome organization and function in the HIV-infected brain, we applied single-nuclei transcriptomics, cell-type-specific chromosomal conformation mapping, and viral integration site sequencing (IS-seq) to frontal cortex from individuals with encephalitis (HIVE) and without (HIV+). Derepressive changes in 3D genomic compartment structures in HIVE microglia were linked to the transcriptional activation of interferon (IFN) signaling and cell migratory pathways, while transcriptional downregulation and repressive compartmentalization of neuronal health and signaling genes occurred in both HIVE and HIV+ microglia. IS-seq recovered 1,221 brain integration sites showing distinct genomic patterns compared with peripheral lymphocytes, with enrichment for sequences newly mobilized into a permissive chromatin environment after infection. Viral transcription occurred in a subset of highly activated microglia comprising 0.33% of all nuclei in HIVE brain. Our findings point to disrupted microglia-neuronal interactions in HIV and link retroviral integration to remodeling of the microglial 3D genome during infection.

Abstract: Summary
The thalamus is the principal information hub of the vertebrate brain, with essential roles in sensory and motor information processing, attention, and memory. The complex array of thalamic nuclei develops from a restricted pool of neural progenitors. We apply longitudinal single-cell RNA sequencing and regional abrogation of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) to map the developmental trajectories of thalamic progenitors, intermediate progenitors, and post-mitotic neurons as they coalesce into distinct thalamic nuclei. These data reveal that the complex architecture of the thalamus is established early during embryonic brain development through the coordinated action of four cell differentiation lineages derived from Shh-dependent and -independent progenitors. We systematically characterize the gene expression programs that define these thalamic lineages across time and demonstrate how their disruption upon Shh depletion causes pronounced locomotor impairment resembling infantile Parkinson’s disease. These results reveal key principles of thalamic development and provide mechanistic insights into neurodevelopmental disorders resulting from thalamic dysfunction.

Abstract: Summary
As opposed to de novo mutation, β-lactam resistance in S. pneumoniae is often conferred via homologous recombination during horizontal gene transfer. We hypothesize that β-lactam resistance in pathogenic streptococci is restricted to naturally competent species via intra-/interspecies recombination due to in vivo fitness trade-offs of de novo penicillin-binding protein (PBP) mutations. We show that de novo mutant populations have abrogated invasive disease capacity and are difficult to evolve in vivo. Conversely, serially transformed recombinant strains efficiently integrate resistant oral streptococcal DNA, gain penicillin resistance and tolerance, and retain virulence in mice. Large-scale changes in pbp2X, pbp2B, and non-PBP-related genes occur in recombinant isolates. Our results indicate that horizontal transfer of β-lactam resistance engenders initially favorable or minimal cost changes in vivo compared with de novo mutation(s), underscoring the importance of recombination in the emergence of β-lactam resistance and suggesting why some pathogenic streptococci lacking innate competence remain universally susceptible.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR-Cas are prokaryotic adaptive immune systems. Cas nucleases generally use CRISPR-derived RNA guides to specifically bind and cleave DNA or RNA targets. Here, we describe the experimental characterization of a bacterial CRISPR effector protein Cas12m representing subtype V-M. Despite being less than half the size of Cas12a, Cas12m catalyzes auto-processing of a crRNA guide, recognizes a 5′-TTN′ protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM), and stably binds a guide-complementary double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). Cas12m has a RuvC domain with a non-canonical catalytic site and accordingly is incapable of guide-dependent cleavage of target nucleic acids. Despite lacking target cleavage activity, the high binding affinity of Cas12m to dsDNA targets allows for interference as demonstrated by its ability to protect bacteria against invading plasmids through silencing invader transcription and/or replication. Based on these molecular features, we repurposed Cas12m by fusing it to a cytidine deaminase that resulted in base editing within a distinct window.

Abstract: Summary
The rearrangement hotspot (Rhs) repeat is an ancient giant protein fold found in all domains of life. Rhs proteins are polymorphic toxins that could either be deployed as an ABC complex or via a type VI secretion system (T6SS) in interbacterial competitions. To explore the mechanism of T6SS-delivered Rhs toxins, we used the gastroenteritis-associated Vibrio parahaemolyticus as a model organism and identified an Rhs toxin-immunity pair, RhsP-RhsPI. Our data show that RhsP-dependent prey targeting by V. parahaemolyticus requires T6SS2. RhsP can bind to VgrG2 independently without a chaperone and spontaneously self-cleaves into three fragments. The toxic C-terminal fragment (RhsPC) can bind to VgrG2 via a VgrG2-interacting region (VIR). Our electron microscopy (EM) analysis reveals that the VIR is encapsulated inside the Rhs β barrel structure and that autoproteolysis triggers a dramatic conformational change of the VIR. This alternative VIR conformation promotes RhsP dimerization, which significantly contributes to T6SS2-mediated prey targeting by V. parahaemolyticus.

Abstract: Summary
The recently discovered neurological disorder NEDAMSS is caused by heterozygous truncations in the transcriptional regulator IRF2BPL. Here, we reprogram patient skin fibroblasts to astrocytes and neurons to study mechanisms of this newly described disease. While full-length IRF2BPL primarily localizes to the nucleus, truncated patient variants sequester the wild-type protein to the cytoplasm and cause aggregation. Moreover, patient astrocytes fail to support neuronal survival in coculture and exhibit aberrant mitochondria and respiratory dysfunction. Treatment with the small molecule copper ATSM (CuATSM) rescues neuronal survival and restores mitochondrial function. Importantly, the in vitro findings are recapitulated in vivo, where co-expression of full-length and truncated IRF2BPL in Drosophila results in cytoplasmic accumulation of full-length IRF2BPL. Moreover, flies harboring heterozygous truncations of the IRF2BPL ortholog (Pits) display progressive motor defects that are ameliorated by CuATSM treatment. Our findings provide insights into mechanisms involved in NEDAMSS and reveal a promising treatment for this severe disorder.

Abstract: Summary
Studying the similarities and differences in genomic interactions between species provides fertile grounds for determining the evolutionary dynamics underpinning genome function and speciation. Here, we describe the principles of 3D genome folding in vertebrates and show how lineage-specific patterns of genome reshuffling can result in different chromatin configurations. We (1) identified different patterns of chromosome folding in across vertebrate species (centromere clustering versus chromosomal territories); (2) reconstructed ancestral marsupial and afrotherian genomes analyzing whole-genome sequences of species representative of the major therian phylogroups; (3) detected lineage-specific chromosome rearrangements; and (4) identified the dynamics of the structural properties of genome reshuffling through therian evolution. We present evidence of chromatin configurational changes that result from ancestral inversions and fusions/fissions. We catalog the close interplay between chromatin higher-order organization and therian genome evolution and introduce an interpretative hypothesis that explains how chromatin folding influences evolutionary patterns of genome reshuffling.

Abstract: Summary
Individuals homozygous for the “Z” mutation in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency are known to be at increased risk for liver disease. It has also become clear that some degree of risk is similarly conferred by the heterozygous state. A lack of model systems that recapitulate heterozygosity in human hepatocytes has limited the ability to study the impact of a single Z alpha-1 antitrypsin (ZAAT) allele on hepatocyte biology. Here, we describe the derivation of syngeneic induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) engineered to determine the effects of ZAAT heterozygosity in iPSC-hepatocytes (iHeps). We find that heterozygous MZ iHeps exhibit an intermediate disease phenotype and share with ZZ iHeps alterations in AAT protein processing and downstream perturbations including altered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial morphology, reduced mitochondrial respiration, and branch-specific activation of the unfolded protein response in cell subpopulations. Our model of MZ heterozygosity thus provides evidence that a single Z allele is sufficient to disrupt hepatocyte homeostatic function.

Abstract: Summary
The brain responds highly variably to identical sensory inputs, but there is no consensus on the nature of this variability. We explore this question using cortex-wide optical voltage imaging and whisker stimulation in awake mice. Clustering analysis reveals that the sensory-evoked activity propagates over the cortex via distinct pathways associated with distinct behavioral states. The pathway taken by each trial is independent of the level of primary sensory-evoked activation but is partially predictable by the spatiotemporal features of the preceding cortical spontaneous activity patterns. The sensory inputs reduce trial-to-trial variability in brain activity and alter temporal autocorrelation in spatial activity pattern evolutions, suggesting non-linear interactions between evoked activities and spontaneous activities. Further, evoked activities and spontaneous activities occupy different positions in the state space, suggesting that sensory inputs can intricately interact with the internal state to generate large-scale evoked activity patterns not frequented by spontaneous brain states.

Abstract: Summary
Environmental change may lead to new memories or modify old ones, but the underlying neural mechanisms are largely unclear. We recorded hippocampal place cells simultaneously from CA1 and CA3 in a virtual reality environment. Compared with CA1, place cells in CA3 are more tolerant of individual landmark changes but undergo orthogonal changes to code distinctively different environments. As visual noise (virtual fog) is introduced to a visually enriched environment, place cells in CA1 split into two subpopulations: in one, place cells maintain their field locations while changing their firing rates to reflect sensory changes; in the other, place cells exhibit global remapping in response to the contextual change. In contrast, place cells in CA3 exhibit mainly rate remapping under the same conditions. Our results suggest that CA1 may simultaneously represent heterogeneous maps of the same environment when subtle visual noise induces both sensory and contextual changes.

Abstract: Summary
Macrophages are critical immune cells in inflammatory diseases, and their differentiation and function are tightly regulated by histone modifications. H3K79 methylation is a histone modification associated with active gene expression, and DOT1L is the only histone methyltransferase for H3K79. Here we determine the role of DOT1L in macrophages by applying a selective DOT1L inhibitor in mouse and human macrophages and using myeloid-specific Dot1l-deficient mice. We found that DOT1L directly regulates macrophage function by controlling lipid biosynthesis gene programs including central lipid regulators like sterol regulatory element-binding proteins SREBP1 and SREBP2. DOT1L inhibition also leads to macrophage hyperactivation, which is associated with disrupted SREBP pathways. In vivo, myeloid Dot1l deficiency reduces atherosclerotic plaque stability and increases the activation of inflammatory plaque macrophages. Our data show that DOT1L is a crucial regulator of macrophage inflammatory responses and lipid regulatory pathways and suggest a high relevance of H3K79 methylation in inflammatory disease.

Abstract: Summary
N-glycans are processed mainly in the Golgi, and a well-organized Golgi structure is required for accurate glycosylation. However, during mitosis the Golgi undergoes severe fragmentation. The resulting trafficking block leads to an extended exposure of cargo molecules to Golgi enzymes. It is unclear how cells avoid glycosylation defects during mitosis. In this study, we report that Golgi α-1,2-mannosidase IA (MAN1A1), the first enzyme that cargo proteins encounter once arriving the Golgi, is phosphorylated at serine 12 by CDK1 in mitosis, which attenuates its activity, affects the production of glycan isomers, and reduces its interaction with the subsequent glycosyltransferase, MGAT1. Expression of wild-type MAN1A1, but not its phosphomimetic mutant, rescues the glycosylation defects in mannosidase I-deficient cells, whereas expression of its phosphorylation-deficient mutant in mitosis increases the formation of complex glycans. Our study reveals that glycosylation is regulated by cytosolic signaling during the cell cycle.

Abstract: Summary
Asymmetric localization of mRNAs is crucial for cell polarity and cell fate determination. By performing fractionation RNA-seq, we report here that a large number of maternal RNAs are associated with the ER in Xenopus oocytes but are released into the cytosol after oocyte maturation. We provide evidence that the majority of ER-associated RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) remain associated with the ER after oocyte maturation. However, all ER-associated RBPs analyzed exhibit reduced binding to some of their target RNAs after oocyte maturation. Our results further show that the ER is remodeled massively during oocyte maturation, leading to the formation of a widespread tubular ER network in the animal hemisphere that is required for the asymmetric localization of mRNAs in mature eggs. Thus, our findings demonstrate that dynamic regulation of RNA-ER association and remodeling of the ER are important for the asymmetric localization of RNAs during development.

Abstract: Summary
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is an essential redox cofactor in mammals and microbes. Here we use isotope tracing to investigate the precursors supporting NAD synthesis in the gut microbiome of mice. We find that dietary NAD precursors are absorbed in the proximal part of the gastrointestinal tract and not available to microbes in the distal gut. Instead, circulating host nicotinamide enters the gut lumen and supports microbial NAD synthesis. The microbiome converts host-derived nicotinamide into nicotinic acid, which is used for NAD synthesis in host tissues and maintains circulating nicotinic acid levels even in the absence of dietary consumption. Moreover, the main route from oral nicotinamide riboside, a widely used nutraceutical, to host NAD is via conversion into nicotinic acid by the gut microbiome. Thus, we establish the capacity for circulating host micronutrients to feed the gut microbiome, and in turn be transformed in a manner that enhances host metabolic flexibility.

Abstract: Summary
Spinal cord development is precisely orchestrated by spatiotemporal gene regulatory programs. However, the underlying epigenetic mechanisms remain largely elusive. Here, we profiled single-cell chromatin accessibility landscapes in mouse neural tubes spanning embryonic days 9.5–13.5. We identified neuronal-cell-cluster-specific cis-regulatory elements in neural progenitors and neurons. Furthermore, we applied a novel computational method, eNet, to build enhancer networks by integrating single-cell chromatin accessibility and gene expression data and identify the hub enhancers within enhancer networks. It was experimentally validated in vivo for Atoh1 that knockout of the hub enhancers, but not the non-hub enhancers, markedly decreased Atoh1 expression and reduced dp1/dI1 cells. Together, our work provides insights into the epigenetic regulation of spinal cord development and a proof-of-concept demonstration of enhancer networks as a general mechanism in transcriptional regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a role in response to cancer treatment and patient prognosis. CAFs show phenotypic and functional heterogeneity and differ widely in tumors of different tissue origin. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing of bladder cancer (BC) patient samples and report a CAF subpopulation characterized by overexpression of the urea transporter SLC14A1. This population is induced by interferon signaling and confers stemness to BC cells via the WNT5A paracrine pathway. Activation of cGAS-STING signaling in tumor cells drives interferon production, thereby revealing a link between cGAS-STING signaling and SLC14A1+ CAF differentiation. Furthermore, the inhibition of SLC14A1+ CAF formation via targeting of STAT1 or STING sensitizes tumor cells to chemotherapy. More important, BC patients with high proportions of intratumoral SLC14A1+ CAFs show cancer stage-independent poor outcome and a worse response rate to neoadjuvant chemotherapy or immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
As part of the Human Cell Atlas Initiative, our goal is to generate single-cell transcriptomics (single-cell RNA sequencing [scRNA-seq], 86,708 cells) and regulatory (single-cell assay on transposase accessible chromatin sequencing [scATAC-seq], 59,830 cells) profiles of the normal postmenopausal ovary and fallopian tube (FT). The FT contains 11 major cell types, and the ovary contains 6. The dominating cell type in the FT and ovary is the stromal cell, which expresses aging-associated genes. FT epithelial cells express multiple ovarian cancer risk-associated genes (CCDC170, RND3, TACC2, STK33, and ADGB) and show active communication between fimbrial epithelial cells and ovarian stromal cells. Integrated single-cell transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility data show that the regulatory landscape of the fimbriae is different from other anatomic regions. Cell types with similar gene expression in the FT display transcriptional profiles. These findings allow us to disentangle the cellular makeup of the postmenopausal FT and ovary, advancing our knowledge of gynecologic diseases in menopause.

Abstract: Summary
Histone methyltransferase SETD1A is critical for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell survival, but the molecular mechanism driving SETD1A gene regulation remains elusive. To delineate the role of SETD1A, we utilize a protein degrader technology to induce rapid SETD1A degradation in AML cell lines. SETD1A degradation results in immediate downregulation of transcripts associated with DNA repair and heme biosynthesis pathways. CRISPR-based functional analyses and metabolomics reveal an essential role of SETD1A to maintain mitochondrial respiration in AML cells. These SETD1A targets are enriched in head-to-head (H2H) genes. SETD1A degradation disrupts a non-enzymatic SETD1A domain-dependent cyclin K function, increases the Ser5P RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) at the transcriptional start site (TSS), and induces the promoter-proximal pausing of RNAPII in a strand-specific manner. This study reveals a non-enzymatic role for SETD1A in transcriptional pause release and provides insight into the mechanism of RNAPII pausing and its function in cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Cold affects many aspects of biology, medicine, agriculture, and industry. Here, we identify a conserved endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, distinct from the canonical unfolded protein response, that maintains lipid homeostasis during extreme cold. We establish that the ER stress sensor IRE-1 is critical for resistance to extreme cold and activated by cold temperature. Specifically, neuronal IRE-1 signals through JNK-1 and neuropeptide signaling to regulate lipid composition within the animal. This cold-response pathway can be bypassed by dietary supplementation with unsaturated fatty acids. Altogether, our findings define an ER-centric conserved organism-wide cold stress response, consisting of molecular neuronal sensors, effectors, and signaling moieties, which control adaptation to cold conditions in the organism. Better understanding of the molecular basis of this stress response is crucial for the optimal use of cold conditions on live organisms and manipulation of lipid saturation homeostasis, which is perturbed in human pathologies.

Abstract: Human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) have great potential in applications such as regenerative medicine, cardiac disease modeling, and in vitro drug evaluation. However, hPSC-CMs are immature, which limits their applications. During development, the maturation of CMs is accompanied by a decline in their proliferative capacity. This phenomenon suggests that regulating the cell cycle may facilitate the maturation of hPSC-CMs. Aurora kinases are essential kinases that regulate the cell cycle, the role of which is not well studied in hPSC-CM maturation. Here, we demonstrate that CYC116, an inhibitor of Aurora kinases, significantly promotes the maturation of CMs derived from both human embryonic stem cells (H1 and H9) and iPSCs (induced PSCs) (UC013), resulting in increased expression of genes related to cardiomyocyte function, better organization of the sarcomere, increased sarcomere length, increased number of mitochondria, and enhanced physiological function of the cells. In addition, a number of other Aurora kinase inhibitors have also been found to promote the maturation of hPSC-CMs. Our data suggest that blocking aurora kinase activity and regulating cell cycle progression may promote the maturation of hPSC-CMs.

Abstract: Summary
Frazzled (Fra) and deleted in colorectal cancer (Dcc) are homologous receptors that promote axon attraction in response to netrin. In Drosophila, Fra also acts independently of netrin by releasing an intracellular domain (ICD) that activates gene transcription. How neurons coordinate these pathways to make accurate guidance decisions is unclear. Here we show that the ADAM metalloprotease Tace cleaves Fra, and this instructs the switch between the two pathways. Genetic manipulations that either increase or decrease Tace levels disrupt midline crossing of commissural axons. These conflicting phenotypes reflect Tace’s function as a bi-directional regulator of axon guidance, a function conserved in its vertebrate homolog ADAM17: while Tace induces the formation of the Fra ICD to activate transcription, excessive Tace cleavage of Fra and Dcc suppresses the response to netrin. We propose that Tace and ADAM17 are key regulators of midline axon guidance by establishing the balance between netrin-dependent and netrin-independent signaling.

Abstract: Summary
During mycobacterial infections, pathogenic mycobacteria manipulate both host immune and stromal cells to establish and maintain a productive infection. In humans, non-human primates, and zebrafish models of infection, pathogenic mycobacteria produce and modify the specialized lipid trehalose 6,6′-dimycolate (TDM) in the bacterial cell envelope to drive host angiogenesis toward the site of forming granulomas, leading to enhanced bacterial growth. Here, we use the zebrafish-Mycobacterium marinum infection model to define the signaling basis of the host angiogenic response. Through intravital imaging and cell-restricted peptide-mediated inhibition, we identify macrophage-specific activation of NFAT signaling as essential to TDM-mediated angiogenesis in vivo. Exposure of cultured human cells to Mycobacterium tuberculosis results in robust induction of VEGFA, which is dependent on a signaling pathway downstream of host TDM detection and culminates in NFATC2 activation. As granuloma-associated angiogenesis is known to serve bacterial-beneficial roles, these findings identify potential host targets to improve tuberculosis disease outcomes.

Abstract: Summary
Specification of the germ layers by Nodal signaling has long been regarded as an archetype of how graded morphogens induce different cell fates. However, this deterministic model cannot explain why only a subset of cells at the early zebrafish embryo margin adopt the endodermal fate, whereas their immediate neighbours, experiencing a similar signaling environment, become mesoderm. Combining pharmacology, quantitative imaging and single cell transcriptomics, we demonstrate that sustained Nodal signaling establishes a bipotential progenitor state from which cells can switch to an endodermal fate or differentiate into mesoderm. Switching is a random event, the likelihood of which is modulated by Fgf signaling. This inherently imprecise mechanism nevertheless leads to robust endoderm formation because of buffering at later stages. Thus, in contrast to previous deterministic models of morphogen action, Nodal signaling establishes a temporal window when cells are competent to undergo a stochastic cell fate switch, rather than determining fate itself.

Abstract: Summary
The serine/threonine protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) dephosphorylates hundreds of substrates by associating with >200 regulatory proteins to form specific holoenzymes. The major PP1 targeting protein in the nucleolus is RRP1B (ribosomal RNA processing 1B). In addition to selectively recruiting PP1β/PP1γ to the nucleolus, RRP1B also has a key role in ribosome biogenesis, among other functions. How RRP1B binds PP1 and regulates nucleolar phosphorylation signaling is not yet known. Here, we show that RRP1B recruits PP1 via established (RVxF/SILK/ΦΦ) and non-canonical motifs. These atypical interaction sites, the PP1β/γ specificity, and N-terminal AF-binding pockets rely on hydrophobic interactions that contribute to binding and, via phosphorylation, regulate complex formation. This work advances our understanding of PP1 isoform selectivity, reveals key roles of N-terminal PP1 residues in regulator binding, and suggests that additional PP1 interaction sites have yet to be identified, all of which are necessary for a systems biology understanding of PP1 function.

Abstract: Summary
Accumulating evidence indicates that macrophages reshape their cholesterol metabolism in response to pathogens to support host defense. Intervention of host cholesterol homeostasis has emerged as a promising strategy for antiviral therapy. T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing molecule 4 (Tim-4) is indispensable in maintaining the homeostasis of macrophages. However, its role in antiviral innate immunity and cholesterol metabolism remains unknown. Here, we report that Tim-4 deficiency results in boosted interferon (IFN) signaling and decreased viral load. Mechanistically, Tim-4 disturbs the Insig1-SCAP interaction and promotes SCAP-SREBP2 complex translocation to the Golgi apparatus, eventually leading to the upregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis in macrophages, which limits the type I IFN response. Our findings demonstrate that Tim-4 suppresses type I IFN signaling by enhancing SREBP2 activation, delineating the role of Tim-4 in antiviral innate immunity and cholesterol metabolism, which sheds light on the mechanism by which Tim-4 orchestrates macrophage homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Adult hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) respond directly to inflammation and infection, causing both acute and persistent changes to quiescence, mobilization, and differentiation. Here we show that murine fetal HSPCs respond to prenatal inflammation in utero and that the fetal response shapes postnatal hematopoiesis and immune cell function. Heterogeneous fetal HSPCs show divergent responses to maternal immune activation (MIA), including changes in quiescence, expansion, and lineage-biased output. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of fetal HSPCs in response to MIA reveals specific upregulation of inflammatory gene profiles in discrete, transient hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) populations that propagate expansion of lymphoid-biased progenitors. Beyond fetal development, MIA causes the inappropriate expansion and persistence of fetal lymphoid-biased progenitors postnatally, concomitant with increased cellularity and hyperresponsiveness of fetal-derived innate-like lymphocytes. Our investigation demonstrates how inflammation in utero can direct the output and function of fetal-derived immune cells by reshaping fetal HSC establishment.

Insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) receptor signaling (IIS) supports context-dependent learning in vertebrates and invertebrates. Here, we identify cell-specific mechanisms of IIS that integrate sensory information with food context to drive synaptic plasticity and learning. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, pairing food deprivation with an odor such as butanone suppresses attraction to that odor. We find that aversive olfactory learning requires the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) protein IST-1 and atypical signaling through the insulin/IGF-1 receptor DAF-2. Cell-specific knockout and rescue demonstrate that DAF-2 acts in the AWCON sensory neuron, which detects butanone, and that learning preferentially depends upon the axonally localized DAF-2c isoform. Acute food deprivation increases DAF-2 levels in AWCON post-transcriptionally through an insulin- and insulin receptor substrate-1 (ist-1)-dependent process. Aversive learning alters the synaptic output of AWCON by suppressing odor-regulated glutamate release in wild-type animals, but not in ist-1 mutants, suggesting that axonal insulin signaling regulates synaptic transmission to support aversive memory.

Abstract: Summary
Influenza infection is substantially worsened by the onset of secondary pneumonia caused by bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The bidirectional interaction between the influenza-injured lung microenvironment and MRSA is poorly understood. By conditioning MRSA ex vivo in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid collected from mice at various time points of influenza infection, we found that the influenza-injured lung microenvironment dynamically induces MRSA to increase cytotoxin expression while decreasing metabolic pathways. LukAB, a SaeRS two-component system-dependent cytotoxin, is particularly important to the severity of post-influenza MRSA pneumonia. LukAB’s activity is likely shaped by the post-influenza lung microenvironment, as LukAB binds to (and is activated by) heparan sulfate (HS) oligosaccharide sequences shed from the epithelial glycocalyx after influenza. Our findings indicate that post-influenza MRSA pneumonia is shaped by bidirectional host-pathogen interactions: host injury triggers changes in bacterial expression of toxins, the activity of which may be shaped by host-derived HS fragments.

Abstract: Summary
The mouse digit tip regenerates following amputation. How the regenerate is patterned is unknown, but a long-standing hypothesis proposes developmental patterning mechanisms are re-used during regeneration. The digit tip bone exhibits dorsal-ventral (DV) polarity, so we focus on En1 and Lmx1b, two factors necessary for DV patterning during limb development. We investigate whether they are re-expressed during regeneration in a developmental-like pattern and whether they direct DV morphology of the regenerate. We find that both En1 and Lmx1b are expressed in the regenerating digit tip epithelium and mesenchyme, respectively, but without DV polarity. Conditional genetics and quantitative analysis of digit tip bone morphology determine that genetic deletion of En1 or Lmx1b in adult digit tip regeneration modestly reduces bone regeneration but does not affect DV patterning. Collectively, our data suggest that, while En1 and Lmx1b are re-expressed during mouse digit tip regeneration, they do not define the DV axis during regeneration.

Abstract: Liver cancer has a high prevalence, with majority of the cases presenting as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The prognosis of metastatic HCC has hardly improved over the past decade, highlighting the necessity for liver cancer research. Studies have reported the ability of the KiSS1 gene to inhibit the growth or metastasis of liver cancer, but contradictory research results are also emerging. We, therefore, sought to investigate the effects of KiSS1 on growth and migration in human HCC cells. HepG2 human HCC cells were infected with lentivirus particles containing KiSS1. The overexpression of KiSS1 resulted in an increased proliferation rate of HCC cells. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting revealed increased Akt activity, and downregulation of the G1/S phase cell cycle inhibitors. A significant increase in tumor spheroid formation with upregulation of β-catenin and CD133 was also observed. KiSS1 overexpression promoted the migratory, invasive ability, and metastatic capacity of the hepatocarcinoma cell line, and these effects were associated with changes in the expressions of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes such as E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and slug. KiSS1 overexpression also resulted in dramatically increased tumor growth in the xenograft mouse model, and upregulation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Ki-67 in the HCC tumors. Furthermore, KiSS1 increased the angiogenic capacity by upregulation of the vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and CD31. Based on these observations, we infer that KiSS1 not only induces HCC proliferation, but also increases the metastatic potential by increasing the migratory ability and angiogenic capacity.

Abstract: Summary
Small open reading frames (sORFs) can encode functional “microproteins” that perform crucial biological tasks. However, their size makes them less amenable to genomic analysis, and their origins and conservation are poorly understood. Given their short length, it is plausible that some of these functional microproteins have recently originated entirely de novo from noncoding sequences. Here we sought to identify such cases in the human lineage by reconstructing the evolutionary origins of human microproteins previously found to have measurable, statistically significant fitness effects. By tracing the formation of each ORF and its transcriptional activation, we show that novel microproteins with significant phenotypic effects have emerged de novo throughout animal evolution, including two after the human-chimpanzee split. Notably, traditional methods for assessing coding potential would miss most of these cases. This evidence demonstrates that the functional potential intrinsic to sORFs can be relatively rapidly and frequently realized through de novo gene emergence.

Abstract: Summary
Ewing sarcoma (EwS) is characterized by EWSR1-ETS fusion transcription factors converting polymorphic GGAA microsatellites (mSats) into potent neo-enhancers. Although the paucity of additional mutations makes EwS a genuine model to study principles of cooperation between dominant fusion oncogenes and neo-enhancers, this is impeded by the limited number of well-characterized models. Here we present the Ewing Sarcoma Cell Line Atlas (ESCLA), comprising whole-genome, DNA methylation, transcriptome, proteome, and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data of 18 cell lines with inducible EWSR1-ETS knockdown. The ESCLA shows hundreds of EWSR1-ETS-targets, the nature of EWSR1-ETS-preferred GGAA mSats, and putative indirect modes of EWSR1-ETS-mediated gene regulation, converging in the duality of a specific but plastic EwS signature. We identify heterogeneously regulated EWSR1-ETS-targets as potential prognostic EwS biomarkers. Our freely available ESCLA (http://r2platform.com/escla/) is a rich resource for EwS research and highlights the power of comprehensive datasets to unravel principles of heterogeneous gene regulation by chimeric transcription factors.

Abstract: Summary
Structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) complexes fold DNA by loop extrusion to support chromosome segregation and genome maintenance. Wadjet systems (JetABCD/MksBEFG/EptABCD) are derivative SMC complexes with roles in bacterial immunity against selfish DNA. Here, we show that JetABCD restricts circular plasmids with an upper size limit of about 100 kb, whereas a linear plasmid evades restriction. Purified JetABCD complexes cleave circular DNA molecules, regardless of the DNA helical topology; cleavage is DNA sequence nonspecific and depends on the SMC ATPase. A cryo-EM structure reveals a distinct JetABC dimer-of-dimers geometry, with the two SMC dimers facing in opposite direction—rather than the same as observed with MukBEF. We hypothesize that JetABCD is a DNA-shape-specific endonuclease and propose the “total extrusion model” for DNA cleavage exclusively when extrusion of an entire plasmid has been completed by a JetABCD complex. Total extrusion cannot be achieved on the larger chromosome, explaining how self-DNA may evade processing.

Abstract: Summary
Calreticulin (CALR) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-retained chaperone that assists glycoproteins in obtaining their structure. CALR mutations occur in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), and the ER retention of CALR mutants (CALR MUT) is reduced due to a lacking KDEL sequence. Here, we investigate the impact of CALR mutations on protein structure and protein levels in MPNs by subjecting primary patient samples and CALR-mutated cell lines to limited proteolysis-coupled mass spectrometry (LiP-MS). Especially glycoproteins are differentially expressed and undergo profound structural alterations in granulocytes and cell lines with homozygous, but not with heterozygous, CALR mutations. Furthermore, homozygous CALR mutations and loss of CALR equally perturb glycoprotein integrity, suggesting that loss-of-function attributes of mutated CALR chaperones (CALR MUT) lead to glycoprotein maturation defects. Finally, by investigating the misfolding of the CALR glycoprotein client myeloperoxidase (MPO), we provide molecular proof of protein misfolding in the presence of homozygous CALR mutations.

Abstract: Summary
POLQ is a key effector of DSB repair by microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) and is overexpressed in many cancers. POLQ inhibitors confer synthetic lethality in HR and Shieldin-deficient cancer cells, which has been proposed to reflect a critical dependence on the DSB repair pathway by MMEJ. Whether POLQ also operates independent of MMEJ remains unexplored. Here, we show that POLQ-deficient cells accumulate post-replicative ssDNA gaps upon BRCA1/2 loss or PARP inhibitor treatment. Biochemically, cooperation between POLQ helicase and polymerase activities promotes RPA displacement and ssDNA-gap fill-in, respectively. POLQ is also capable of microhomology-mediated gap skipping (MMGS), which generates deletions during gap repair that resemble the genomic scars prevalent in POLQ overexpressing cancers. Our findings implicate POLQ in mutagenic post-replicative gap sealing, which could drive genome evolution in cancer and whose loss places a critical dependency on HR for gap protection and repair and cellular viability.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian teeth develop from the inductive epithelial-mesenchymal interaction, an important mechanism shared by many organs. The cellular basis for such interaction remains elusive. Here, we generate a dual-fluorescence model to track and analyze dental cells from embryonic to postnatal stages, in which Pitx2+ epithelium and Msx1+ mesenchyme are sufficient for tooth reconstitution. Single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial mapping further revealed critical cellular dynamics during molar development, where tooth germs are organized by Msx1+Sdc1+ dental papilla and surrounding dental niche. Surprisingly, niche cells are more efficient in tooth reconstitution and can directly regenerate papilla cells through interaction with dental epithelium. Finally, from the dental niche, we identify a group of previously unappreciated migratory Msx1+ Sox9+ cells as the potential cell origin for dental papilla. Our results indicate that the dental niche cells directly contribute to tooth organogenesis and provide critical insights into the essential cell composition for tooth engineering.

Abstract: Summary
Identifying signals that govern the differentiation of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells (CD8+ TILs) toward exhaustion can improve current therapeutic approaches for cancer. Here, we show that type I interferons (IFN-Is) act as environmental cues, enhancing terminal CD8+ T cell exhaustion in tumors. We find enrichment of IFN-I-stimulated genes (ISGs) within exhausted CD8+ T cells (Tex cells) in patients across various cancer types, with heightened ISG levels correlating with poor response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. In preclinical models, CD8+ TILs devoid of IFN-I signaling develop less exhaustion features, provide better tumor control, and show greater response to ICB-mediated rejuvenation. Mechanistically, chronic IFN-I stimulation perturbs lipid metabolism and redox balance in Tex cells, leading to aberrant lipid accumulation and elevated oxidative stress. Collectively, these defects promote lipid peroxidation, which potentiates metabolic and functional exhaustion of Tex cells. Thus, cell-intrinsic IFN-I signaling regulates the extent of CD8+ TIL exhaustion and has important implications for immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Impaired phosphodiesterase (PDE) function and mitochondrial Ca2+ (i.e., [Ca2+]m) lead to multiple health syndromes by an unknown pathway. Here, we fluorescently monitor robust [Ca2+]m efflux mediated by the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger NCLX in hippocampal neurons sequentially evoked by caffeine and depolarization. Surprisingly, neuronal depolarization-induced Ca2+ transients alone fail to evoke strong [Ca2+]m efflux in wild-type (WT) neurons. However, pre-treatment with the selective PDE2 inhibitor Bay 60-7550 effectively rescues [Ca2+]m efflux similarly to caffeine. Moreover, PDE2 acts by diminishing mitochondrial cAMP, thus promoting NCLX phosphorylation at its PKA site. We find that the protection of neurons against excitotoxic insults, conferred by PDE2 inhibition in WT neurons, is NCLX dependent. Finally, the administration of Bay 60-7550 enhances new object recognition in WT, but not in NCLX knockout (KO), mice. Our results identify a link between PDE and [Ca2+]m signaling that may provide effective therapy for cognitive and ischemic syndromes.

Abstract: Summary
Ribosome synthesis begins in the nucleolus with 90S pre-ribosome construction, but little is known about how the many different snoRNAs that modify the pre-rRNA are timely guided to their target sites. Here, we report a role for Cms1 in such a process. Initially, we discovered CMS1 as a null suppressor of a nop14 mutant impaired in Rrp12-Enp1 factor recruitment to the 90S. Further investigations detected Cms1 at the 18S rRNA 3′ major domain of an early 90S that carried H/ACA snR83, which is known to guide pseudouridylation at two target sites within the same subdomain. Cms1 co-precipitates with many 90S factors, but Rrp12-Enp1 encircling the 3′ major domain in the mature 90S is decreased. We suggest that Cms1 associates with the 3′ major domain during early 90S biogenesis to restrict premature Rrp12-Enp1 binding but allows snR83 to timely perform its modification role before the next 90S assembly steps coupled with Cms1 release take place.

Abstract: Summary
Transposable elements (TEs) are the major sources of lineage-specific genomic innovation and comprise nearly half of the human genome, but most of their functions remain unclear. Here, we identify that a series of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), a TE subclass, regulate the transcriptome at the definitive endoderm stage with in vitro differentiation model from human embryonic stem cell. Notably, these ERVs perform as enhancers containing binding sites for critical transcription factors for endoderm lineage specification. Genome-wide methylation analysis shows most of these ERVs are derepressed by TET1-mediated DNA demethylation. LTR6B, a representative definitive endoderm activating ERV, contains binding sites for FOXA2 and GATA4 and governs the primate-specific expression of its neighboring developmental genes such as ERBB4 in definitive endoderm. Together, our study proposes evidence that recently evolved ERVs represent potent de novo developmental regulatory elements, which, in turn, fine-tune species-specific transcriptomes during endoderm and embryonic development.

Abstract: Summary
CD4 T cell help is critical to sustain effector CD8 T cell responses during chronic infection, notably via T follicular helper (Tfh)-derived interleukin-21 (IL-21). Conversely, CD4 depletion results in severe CD8 T cell dysfunction and lifelong viremia despite CD4 T cell reemergence following transient depletion. These observations suggest that repopulating CD4 subsets are functionally or numerically insufficient to orchestrate a robust CD8 response. We utilize spatial transcriptomics and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to investigate CD4 T cell heterogeneity under CD4-replete and -deplete conditions and explore cellular interactions during chronic infection. Although IL-21-producing Tfh cells repopulate following transient CD4 depletion, they are outnumbered by immunomodulatory CD4 T cells. Moreover, the splenic architecture appears perturbed, with decreases in white pulp regions, coinciding with germinal center losses. These disruptions in splenic architecture are associated with diminished Tfh and progenitor CD8 T cell colocalization, providing a potential mechanism for impaired progenitor-to-effector CD8 T cell differentiation during “un-helped” conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Decades of work propose that hippocampal activity supports internal representation of learned experiences and contexts, allowing individuals to form long-term memories and quickly adapt behavior to changing environments. However, recent studies insinuate hippocampal representations can drift over time, raising the question: how could the hippocampus hold stable memories when activity of its neuronal maps fluctuates? We hypothesized that task-dependent hippocampal maps set by learning rules and structured attention stabilize as a function of behavioral performance. To test this, we imaged hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons during learning and memory recall phases of a new task where mice use odor cues to navigate between two reward zones. Across learning, both orthogonal and overlapping task-dependent place maps form rapidly, discriminating trial context with strong correlation to behavioral performance. Once formed, task-selective place maps show increased long-term stability during memory recall phases. We conclude that memory demand and attention stabilize hippocampal activity to maintain contextually rich spatial representations.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer cells encounter a hostile tumor microenvironment (TME), and their adaptations to metabolic stresses determine metastatic competence. Here, we show that the metabolic enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase-4 (PFKFB4) is induced in hypoxic tumors acquiring metabolic plasticity and invasive phenotype. In mouse models of breast cancer, genetic ablation of PFKFB4 significantly delays distant organ metastasis, reducing local lymph node invasion by suppressing expression of invasive gene signature including integrin β3. Photoacoustic imaging followed by metabolomics analyses of hypoxic tumors show that PFKFB4 drives metabolic flexibility, enabling rapid detoxification of reactive oxygen species favoring survival under selective pressure. Mechanistically, hypoxic induction triggers nuclear translocation of PFKFB4 accentuating non-canonical transcriptional activation of HIF-1α, and breast cancer patients with increased nuclear PFKFB4 in their tumors are found to be significantly associated with poor prognosis. Our findings imply that PFKFB4 induction is crucial for tumor cell adaptation in the hypoxic TME that determines metastatic competence.

Abstract: Summary
Angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels from pre-existing vessels, occurs during development, injury repair, and tumorigenesis to deliver oxygen, immune cells, and nutrients to tissues. Defects in angiogenesis occur in cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases, and chronic, non-healing wounds, yet treatment options are limited. Here, we provide a map of the early angiogenic niche by analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing of mouse skin wound healing. Our data implicate Langerhans cells (LCs), phagocytic, skin-resident immune cells, in driving angiogenesis during skin repair. Using lineage-driven reportersw, three-dimensional (3D) microscopy, and mouse genetics, we show that LCs are situated at the endothelial cell leading edge in mouse skin wounds and are necessary for angiogenesis during repair. These data provide additional future avenues for the control of angiogenesis to treat disease and chronic wounds and extend the function of LCs beyond their canonical role in antigen presentation and T cell immunity.

Abstract: Summary
PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are small RNAs bound by PIWI-clade Argonaute proteins that function to silence transposable elements (TEs). Following mouse primordial germ cell (mPGC) specification around E6.25, fetal piRNAs emerge in male gonocytes from E13.5 onward. The in vitro differentiation of mPGC-like cells (mPGCLCs) has raised the possibility of studying the fetal piRNA pathway in greater depth. However, using single-cell RNA-seq and RT-qPCR along mPGCLC differentiation, we find that piRNA pathway factors are not fully expressed in Day 6 mPGCLCs. Moreover, we do not detect piRNAs across a panel of Day 6 mPGCLC lines using small RNA-seq. Our combined efforts highlight that in vitro differentiated Day 6 mPGCLCs do not yet resemble E13.5 or later mouse gonocytes where the piRNA pathway is active.

Abstract: Summary
Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is the only licensed vaccine against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB) disease. However, BCG has limited efficacy, necessitating the development of better vaccines. Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTMs) are opportunistic pathogens present ubiquitously in the environment. TB endemic countries experience higher exposure to NTMs, but previous studies have not elucidated the relationship between NTM exposure and BCG efficacy against TB. Therefore, we develop a mouse model (BCG + NTM) to simulate human BCG immunization regime and continuous NTM exposure. BCG + NTM mice exhibit superior and prolonged protection against pulmonary TB, with increased B cell influx and anti-Mtb antibodies in serum and airways, compared with BCG alone. Notably, spatial transcriptomics and immunohistochemistry reveal that BCG + NTM mice formed B cell aggregates with features of germinal center development, which correlate with reduced Mtb burden. Our studies suggest a direct relationship between NTM exposure and TB protection, with B cells playing a crucial role.

Abstract: Summary
Sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pumps Ca2+ into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Herein, we present cryo-electron microscopy (EM) structures of three intermediates of SERCA2b: Ca2+-bound phosphorylated (E1P·2Ca2+) and Ca2+-unbound dephosphorylated (E2·Pi) intermediates and another between the E2P and E2·Pi states. Our cryo-EM analysis demonstrates that the E1P·2Ca2+ state exists in low abundance and preferentially transitions to an E2P-like structure by releasing Ca2+ and that the Ca2+ release gate subsequently undergoes stepwise closure during the dephosphorylation processes. Importantly, each intermediate adopts multiple sub-state structures including those like the next one in the catalytic series, indicating conformational overlap at transition steps, as further substantiated by atomistic molecular dynamic simulations of SERCA2b in a lipid bilayer. The present findings provide insight into how enzymes accelerate catalytic cycles.

Abstract: Summary
In neutrophils, caspase-11 cleaves gasdermin D (GSDMD), causing pyroptosis to clear cytosol-invasive bacteria. In contrast, caspase-1 also cleaves GSDMD but seems to not cause pyroptosis. Here, we show that this pyroptosis-resistant caspase-1 activation is specifically programmed by the site of translocation of the detected microbial virulence factors. We find that pyrin and NLRC4 agonists do not trigger pyroptosis in neutrophils when they access the cytosol from endosomal compartment. In contrast, when the same ligands penetrate through the plasma membrane, they cause pyroptosis. Consistently, pyrin detects extracellular Yersinia pseudotuberculosis ΔyopM in neutrophils, driving caspase-1-GSDMD pyroptosis. This pyroptotic response drives PAD4-dependent H3 citrullination and results in extrusion of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Our data indicate that caspase-1, GSDMD, or PAD4 deficiency renders mice more susceptible to Y. pseudotuberculosis ΔyopM infection. Therefore, neutrophils induce pyroptosis in response to caspase-1-activating inflammasomes triggered by extracellular bacterial pathogens, but after they phagocytose pathogens, they are programmed to forego pyroptosis.

Abstract: Summary
Programmed cell death and caspase proteins play a pivotal role in host innate immune response combating pathogen infections. Blocking cell death is employed by many bacterial pathogens as a universal virulence strategy. CopC family type III effectors, including CopC from an environmental pathogen Chromobacterium violaceum, utilize calmodulin (CaM) as a co-factor to inactivate caspases by arginine ADPR deacylization. However, the molecular basis of the catalytic and substrate/co-factor binding mechanism is unknown. Here, we determine successive cryo-EM structures of CaM-CopC-caspase-3 ternary complex in pre-reaction, transition, and post-reaction states, which elucidate a multistep enzymatic mechanism of CopC-catalyzed ADPR deacylization. Moreover, we capture a snapshot of the detachment of modified caspase-3 from CopC. These structural insights are validated by mutagenesis analyses of CopC-mediated ADPR deacylization in vitro and animal infection in vivo. Our study offers a structural framework for understanding the molecular basis of arginine ADPR deacylization catalyzed by the CopC family.

Abstract: Summary
Decision making is a fundamental nervous system function that ranges widely in complexity and speed of execution. We previously established larval zebrafish as a model for sensorimotor decision making and identified the G-protein-coupled calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) to be critical for this process. Here, we report that CaSR functions in neurons to dynamically regulate the bias between two behavioral outcomes: escapes and reorientations. By employing a computational guided transgenic strategy, we identify a genetically defined neuronal cluster in the hindbrain as a key candidate site for CaSR function. Finally, we demonstrate that transgenic CaSR expression targeting this cluster consisting of a few hundred neurons shifts behavioral bias in wild-type animals and restores decision making deficits in CaSR mutants. Combined, our data provide a rare example of a G-protein-coupled receptor that biases vertebrate sensorimotor decision making via a defined neuronal cluster.

Abstract: Summary
Since the identification of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of COVID-19, multiple SARS-CoV-2-related viruses have been characterized, including pangolin-origin GD/1/2019 and GX/P2V/2017. Our previous study indicated that both viruses have the potential to infect humans. Here, we find that CB6 (commercial name etesevimab), a COVID-19 therapeutic monoclonal antibody (MAb) developed by our group, efficiently inhibits GD/1/2019 but not GX/P2V/2017. A total of 50 SARS-CoV-2 MAbs divided into seven groups based on their receptor-binding domain (RBD) epitopes, together with the COVID-19 convalescent sera, are systematically screened for their cross-binding and cross-neutralizing properties against GX/P2V/2017. We find that GX/P2V/2017 displays substantial immune difference from SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we solve two complex structures of the GX/P2V/2017 RBD with MAbs belonging to RBD-1 and RBD-5, providing a structural basis for their different antigenicity. These results highlight the necessity for broad anti-coronavirus countermeasures and shed light on potential therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Mycobacterium abscessus is an increasingly prevalent opportunistic pathogen causing both pulmonary and skin and soft tissue infections. It is of increasing concern for immunocompromised individuals, such as those with cystic fibrosis, due to its highly drug resistant nature and ability to evade the host immune system. Current treatments for M. abscessus pulmonary infections are largely ineffective and treatment outcomes are generally poor, thus we urgently require new treatments to combat these infections. Recently, it has been demonstrated that manuka honey is effective against M. abscessus and can improve the inhibitory effect of amikacin. Here, we explore the potential improvement of both azithromycin and tobramycin with the addition of manuka honey against M. abscessus complex. Improved growth inhibition was observed for azithromycin with manuka honey against all M. abscessus subspecies. Improved bactericidal activity was also observed. Importantly, the macrolide resistant M. abscessus subsp. bolletii showed improved inhibition and bactericidal activity was obtained in response to 0.117 g/mL manuka honey MGO40 with 16 µg/mL azithromycin. No improved activity was observed for tobramycin and manuka honey against any of the M. abscessus isolates tested. This demonstrates the potential for antibiotic enhancement by the addition of manuka honey, furthering the applications of therapeutic manuka honey.

Abstract: Summary
Phosphorylation of Neurospora crassa eukaryotic initiation factor 2 α (eIF2α), a conserved translation initiation factor, is clock controlled. To determine the impact of rhythmic eIF2α phosphorylation on translation, we performed temporal ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in wild-type (WT), clock mutant Δfrq, eIF2α kinase mutant Δcpc-3, and constitutively active cpc-3c cells. About 14% of mRNAs are rhythmically translated in WT cells, and translation rhythms for ∼30% of these mRNAs, which we named circadian translation-initiation-controlled genes (cTICs), are dependent on the clock and CPC-3. Most cTICs are expressed from arrhythmic mRNAs and contain a P-body (PB) localization motif in their 5′ leader sequence. Deletion of SNR-1, a component of cytoplasmic messenger ribonucleoprotein granules (cmRNPgs) that include PBs and stress granules (SGs), and the PB motif on one of the cTIC mRNAs, zip-1, significantly alters zip-1 rhythmic translation. These results reveal that the clock regulates rhythmic translation of specific mRNAs through rhythmic eIF2α activity and cmRNPg metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
The T-shaped radial spoke (RS) is a protein complex attached to the A microtubule of the outer doublet microtubules, and it extends toward the central pair (CP). It modulates the beat frequency, amplitude, and waveform of the flagella and cilia by serving as a mechanochemical signal transducer between the CP and dyneins. In humans, RS defects cause primary ciliary dyskinesia, but the structural components of triple RSs (RS1, RS2, and RS3) in mammals remain to be elucidated in detail. Here, we introduce a mouse model that lacked the entire RS1 in sperm flagella, due to the deletion of Iqub, while the tracheal cilia possessed intact triple RSs. Furthermore, the absence of IQUB only resulted in male infertility, owing to the sperm motility defect. Based on the mouse model, the RS1 compositions are identified in sperm flagella. In summary, this study elucidates the RS1 components and function in mammalian flagella.

Abstract: Summary
The identification of a COVID-19 host response signature in blood can increase the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and improve diagnostic tools. Applying a multi-objective optimization framework to both massive public and new multi-omics data, we identified a COVID-19 signature regulated at both transcriptional and epigenetic levels. We validated the signature’s robustness in multiple independent COVID-19 cohorts. Using public data from 8,630 subjects and 53 conditions, we demonstrated no cross-reactivity with other viral and bacterial infections, COVID-19 comorbidities, or confounders. In contrast, previously reported COVID-19 signatures were associated with significant cross-reactivity. The signature’s interpretation, based on cell-type deconvolution and single-cell data analysis, revealed prominent yet complementary roles for plasmablasts and memory T cells. Although the signal from plasmablasts mediated COVID-19 detection, the signal from memory T cells controlled against cross-reactivity with other viral infections. This framework identified a robust, interpretable COVID-19 signature and is broadly applicable in other disease contexts. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
In injured airways of the adult lung, epithelial progenitors are called upon to repair by nearby mesenchymal cells via signals transmitted through the niche. Currently, it is unclear whether repair is coordinated by the mesenchymal cells that maintain the niche or by the airway epithelial cells that occupy it. Here, we show that the spatiotemporal expression of Fgf10 by the niche is primarily orchestrated by the niche’s epithelial occupants—both those that reside prior to, and following, injury. During homeostasis, differentiated airway epithelial cells secrete Sonic hedgehog (Shh) to inhibit Fgf10 expression by Gli1+ peribronchial mesenchymal cells in the niche. After injury, remaining epithelial cells produce Wnt7b to induce Fgf10 expression in airway smooth muscle cells in the niche. We find that this reliance on a common activator of airway epithelial stem cells also allows for the recruitment of remote stem cell populations when local populations have been exhausted.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor behavior is intricately dependent on the oncogenic properties of cancer cells and their multi-cellular interactions. To understand these dependencies within the wider microenvironment, we studied over 270,000 single-cell transcriptomes and 100 microdissected whole exomes from 12 patients with kidney tumors, prior to validation using spatial transcriptomics. Tissues were sampled from multiple regions of the tumor core, the tumor-normal interface, normal surrounding tissues, and peripheral blood. We find that the tissue-type location of CD8+ T cell clonotypes largely defines their exhaustion state with intra-tumoral spatial heterogeneity that is not well explained by somatic heterogeneity. De novo mutation calling from single-cell RNA-sequencing data allows us to broadly infer the clonality of stromal cells and lineage-trace myeloid cell development. We report six conserved meta-programs that distinguish tumor cell function, and find an epithelial-mesenchymal transition meta-program highly enriched at the tumor-normal interface that co-localizes with IL1B-expressing macrophages, offering a potential therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
Neuroligins (NLs), a family of postsynaptic cell-adhesion molecules, have been associated with autism spectrum disorder. We have reported that dysfunction of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) leads to social deficits in an NL3 R451C knockin (KI) mouse model of autism. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, we find that N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) function and parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneuron number and expression are reduced in the mPFC of the KI mice. Selective knockdown of NMDAR subunit GluN1 in the mPFC PV+ interneuron decreases its intrinsic excitability. Restoring NMDAR function by its partial agonist D-cycloserine rescues the PV+ interneuron dysfunction and social deficits in the KI mice. Interestingly, early D-cycloserine administration at adolescence prevents adult KI mice from social deficits. Together, our results suggest that NMDAR hypofunction and the resultant PV+ interneuron dysfunction in the mPFC may constitute a central node in the pathogenesis of social deficits in the KI mice.

Abstract: Summary
Studies have shown the therapeutic effects of a ketogenic diet (KD) on epilepsy, but the effect of a KD on drug reinstatement is largely unclear. This study aims to investigate whether KD consumption possesses therapeutic potential for cocaine reinstatement and the molecular mechanism. We find that a KD significantly reduces cocaine-induced reinstatement in mice, which is accompanied by a markedly elevated level of β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB), the most abundant ketone body, in the hippocampus. The underlying mechanism is that β-OHB posttranslationally modifies CaMKII-α with β-hydroxybutyrylation, resulting in significant inhibition of T286 autophosphorylation and downregulation of CaMKII activity. Collectively, our results reveal that β-hydroxybutyrylation is a posttranslational modification of CaMKII-α that plays a critical role in mediating the effect of KD consumption in reducing cocaine reinstatement.

Abstract: Summary
Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA-1 (ADAR1) is a ubiquitously expressed RNA deaminase catalyzing adenosine-to-inosine editing to prevent hyperactivated cytosolic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) response mediated by MDA5. Here, we demonstrate that ADAR1 is essential for early B lymphopoiesis from late pro-B and large pre-B cell stages onward. ADAR1 exerts its requisite role via both MDA5-dependent and -independent pathways. Interestingly, the MDA5-dependent mechanisms regulate early pro-B to large pre-B cell transition by promoting early B cell survival. In contrast, the MDA5-independent mechanisms control large pre-B to small pre-B cell transition by regulating pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) expression. Moreover, we show that protein kinase R (PKR) and oligoadenylate synthetase/ribonuclease (OAS/RNase) L pathways are dispensable for ADAR1’s role in early B lymphopoiesis. Importantly, we demonstrate that p150 isoform of ADAR1 exclusively accounts for ADAR1’s function in early B lymphopoiesis, and its conventional dsRNA-binding, but not the Z-DNA/RNA-binding or the RNA-editing, activity is required for ADAR1’s function in B cell development. Thus, our findings suggest that ADAR1 regulates early B lymphopoiesis through various mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
In mammals, brown adipose tissue (BAT) is specialized to conduct non-shivering thermogenesis for survival under cold acclimation. Although emerging evidence suggests that lipid metabolites are essential for heat generation in cold-activated BAT, the underlying mechanisms of lipid uptake in BAT have not been thoroughly understood. Here, we show that very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) uptaken by VLDL receptor (VLDLR) plays important roles in thermogenic execution in BAT. Compared with wild-type mice, VLDLR knockout mice exhibit impaired thermogenic features. Mechanistically, VLDLR-mediated VLDL uptake provides energy sources for mitochondrial oxidation via lysosomal processing, subsequently enhancing thermogenic activity in brown adipocytes. Moreover, the VLDL-VLDLR axis potentiates peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)β/δ activity with thermogenic gene expression in BAT. Accordingly, VLDL-induced thermogenic capacity is attenuated in brown-adipocyte-specific PPARβ/δ knockout mice. Collectively, these data suggest that the VLDL-VLDLR axis in brown adipocytes is a key factor for thermogenic execution during cold exposure.

Abstract: Summary
Translating human genetic findings (genome-wide association studies [GWAS]) to pathobiology and therapeutic discovery remains a major challenge for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We present a network topology-based deep learning framework to identify disease-associated genes (NETTAG). We leverage non-coding GWAS loci effects on quantitative trait loci, enhancers and CpG islands, promoter regions, open chromatin, and promoter flanking regions under the protein-protein interactome. Via NETTAG, we identified 156 AD-risk genes enriched in druggable targets. Combining network-based prediction and retrospective case-control observations with 10 million individuals, we identified that usage of four drugs (ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, cholecalciferol, and ceftriaxone) is associated with reduced likelihood of AD incidence. Gemfibrozil (an approved lipid regulator) is significantly associated with 43% reduced risk of AD compared with simvastatin using an active-comparator design (95% confidence interval 0.51–0.63, p < 0.0001). In summary, NETTAG offers a deep learning methodology that utilizes GWAS and multi-genomic findings to identify pathobiology and drug repurposing in AD.

Abstract: Summary
Fats are essential in healthy diets, but how dietary fats affect immune cell function and overall health is not well understood. Mimicking human high-fat diets (HFDs), which are rich in different fatty acid (FA) components, we fed mice various HFDs from different fat sources, including fish oil and cocoa butter. Mice consuming the fish oil HFD exhibit a hair-loss phenotype. Further studies show that omega-3 (n-3) FAs in fish oil promote atypical infiltration of CD207− (langerin−) myeloid macrophages in skin dermis, which induce hair loss through elevated TNF-α signaling. Mechanistically, epidermal fatty acid binding protein (E-FABP) is demonstrated to play an essential role in inducing TNF-α-mediated hair loss by activating the n-3 FA/ROS/IL-36 signaling pathway in dermal resident macrophages. Absence of E-FABP abrogates fish oil HFD-induced murine hair loss. Altogether, these findings support a role for E-FABP as a lipid sensor mediating n-3 FA-regulated macrophage function and skin health.

Abstract: Summary
Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cell development in the thymus depends on T cell receptor recognition of CD1d ligand on CD4/CD8 double-positive thymocytes. We previously reported that B7-CD28 co-stimulation is required for thymic iNKT cell development, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this co-stimulatory requirement are not understood. Here we report that CD28 expression on CD1d-expressing antigen-presenting T cells is required for thymic iNKT cell development. Mechanistically, antigen-presenting T cells provide co-stimulation through an unconventional mechanism, acquiring B7 molecules via CD28-dependent trogocytosis from B7-expressing thymic epithelial cells, dendritic cells, and B cells and providing critical B7 co-stimulation to developing iNKT cells. Thus, the present study demonstrates a mechanism of B7 co-stimulation in thymic T cell development by antigen-presenting T cells.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer therapies trigger diverse cellular responses, ranging from apoptotic death to acquisition of persistent therapy-refractory states such as senescence. Tipping the balance toward apoptosis could improve treatment outcomes regardless of therapeutic agent or malignancy. We find that inhibition of the mitochondrial protein BCL-xL increases the propensity of cancer cells to die after treatment with a broad array of oncology drugs, including mitotic inhibitors and chemotherapy. Functional precision oncology and omics analyses suggest that BCL-xL inhibition redirects the outcome of p53 transcriptional response from senescence to apoptosis, which likely occurs via caspase-dependent down-modulation of p21 and downstream cytostatic proteins. Consequently, addition of a BCL-2/xL inhibitor strongly improves melanoma response to the senescence-inducing drug targeting mitotic kinase Aurora kinase A (AURKA) in mice and patient-derived organoids. This study shows a crosstalk between the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and cell cycle regulation that can be targeted to augment therapeutic efficacy in cancers with wild-type p53.

Abstract: Summary
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is characterized by molecular heterogeneity with diverse immune cell infiltration patterns, which has been linked to therapy sensitivity and resistance. However, full understanding of how immune cell phenotypes vary across different patient subgroups is lacking. Here, we dissect the NSCLC tumor microenvironment at high resolution by integrating 1,283,972 single cells from 556 samples and 318 patients across 29 datasets, including our dataset capturing cells with low mRNA content. We stratify patients into immune-deserted, B cell, T cell, and myeloid cell subtypes. Using bulk samples with genomic and clinical information, we identify cellular components associated with tumor histology and genotypes. We then focus on the analysis of tissue-resident neutrophils (TRNs) and uncover distinct subpopulations that acquire new functional properties in the tissue microenvironment, providing evidence for the plasticity of TRNs. Finally, we show that a TRN-derived gene signature is associated with anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) treatment failure.

Abstract: Summary
Long introns with short exons in vertebrate genes are thought to require spliceosome assembly across exons (exon definition), rather than introns, thereby requiring transcription of an exon to splice an upstream intron. Here, we developed CoLa-seq (co-transcriptional lariat sequencing) to investigate the timing and determinants of co-transcriptional splicing genome wide. Unexpectedly, 90% of all introns, including long introns, can splice before transcription of a downstream exon, indicating that exon definition is not obligatory for most human introns. Still, splicing timing varies dramatically across introns, and various genetic elements determine this variation. Strong U2AF2 binding to the polypyrimidine tract predicts early splicing, explaining exon definition-independent splicing. Together, our findings question the essentiality of exon definition and reveal features beyond intron and exon length that are determinative for splicing timing.

Abstract: Summary
The heme branch of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis contributes to the regulation of chlorophyll levels. However, the mechanism underlying the balance between chlorophyll and heme synthesis remains elusive. Here, we identify a dark green leaf mutant, dg, from an ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-induced mutant library of Chinese cabbage. The dg phenotype is caused by an amino acid substitution in the conserved chlorophyll a/b-binding motif (CAB) of ferrochelatase 2 (BrFC2). This mutation increases the formation of BrFC2 homodimer to promote heme production. Moreover, wild-type BrFC2 and dBrFC2 interact with protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) oxidoreductase B1 and B2 (BrPORB1 and BrPORB2), and dBrFC2 exhibits higher binding ability to substrate Pchlide, thereby promoting BrPORBs-catalyzed production of chlorophyllide (Chlide), which can be directly converted into chlorophyll. Our results show that dBrFC2 is a gain-of-function mutation contributing to balancing heme and chlorophyll synthesis via a regulatory mechanism in which dBrFC2 promotes BrPORB enzymatic reaction to enhance chlorophyll synthesis.

Abstract: Summary
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a master regulator of cellular energy homeostasis and a therapeutic target for metabolic diseases. Co/post-translational N-myristoylation of glycine-2 (Gly2) of the AMPK β subunit has been suggested to regulate the distribution of the kinase between the cytosol and membranes through a “myristoyl switch” mechanism. However, the relevance of AMPK myristoylation for metabolic signaling in cells and in vivo is unclear. Here, we generated knockin mice with a Gly2-to-alanine point mutation of AMPKβ1 (β1-G2A). We demonstrate that non-myristoylated AMPKβ1 has reduced stability but is associated with increased kinase activity and phosphorylation of the Thr172 activation site in the AMPK α subunit. Using proximity ligation assays, we show that loss of β1 myristoylation impedes colocalization of the phosphatase PPM1A/B with AMPK in cells. Mice carrying the β1-G2A mutation have improved metabolic health with reduced adiposity, hepatic lipid accumulation, and insulin resistance under conditions of high-fat diet-induced obesity.

Abstract: Summary
The establishment of a functional vasculature requires endothelial cells to enter quiescence during the completion of development, otherwise pathological overgrowth occurs. How such a transition is regulated remains unclear. Here, we uncover a role of Zeb1 in defining vascular quiescence entry. During quiescence acquisition, Zeb1 increases along with the progressive decline of endothelial progenitors’ activities, with Zeb1 loss resulting in endothelial overgrowth and vascular deformities. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) analyses reveal that Zeb1 represses Wif1, thereby activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Knockdown of Wif1 rescues the overgrowth induced by Zeb1 deletion. Importantly, local administration of surrogate Wnt molecules in the retina ameliorates the overgrowth defects of Zeb1 mutants. These findings show a mechanism by which Zeb1 induces quiescence of endothelial progenitors during the establishing of vascular homeostasis, providing molecular insight into the inherited neovascular pathologies associated with human ZEB1 mutations, suggesting pharmacological activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling as a potential therapeutical approach.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity comorbidities such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease are pressing public health concerns. Overconsumption of calories leads to weight gain; however, neural mechanisms underlying excessive food consumption are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that dopamine receptor D1 (Drd1) expressed in the agouti-related peptide/neuropeptide Y (AgRP/NPY) neurons of the arcuate hypothalamus is required for appropriate responses to a high-fat diet (HFD). Stimulation of Drd1 and AgRP/NPY co-expressing arcuate neurons is sufficient to induce voracious feeding. Delivery of a HFD after food deprivation acutely induces dopamine (DA) release in the ARC, whereas animals that lack Drd1 expression in ARCAgRP/NPY neurons (Drd1AgRP-KO) exhibit attenuated foraging and refeeding of HFD. These results define a role for the DA input to the ARC that encodes acute responses to food and position Drd1 signaling in the ARCAgRP/NPY neurons as an integrator of the hedonic and homeostatic neuronal feeding circuits.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) sustain lifelong hematopoiesis. Mutations of pre-mRNA splicing machinery, especially splicing factor 3b, subunit 1 (SF3B1), are early lesions found in malignancies arising from HSPC dysfunction. However, why splicing factor deficits contribute to HSPC defects remains incompletely understood. Using zebrafish, we show that HSPC formation in sf3b1 homozygous mutants is dependent on STAT3 activation. Clinically, mutations in SF3B1 are heterozygous; thus, we explored if targeting STAT3 could be a vulnerability in these cells. We show that SF3B1 heterozygosity confers heightened sensitivity to STAT3 inhibition in zebrafish, mouse, and human HSPCs. Cells carrying mutations in other splicing factors or treated with splicing modulators are also more sensitive to STAT3 inhibition. Mechanistically, we illustrate that STAT3 inhibition exacerbates aberrant splicing in SF3B1 mutant cells. Our findings reveal a conserved vulnerability of splicing factor mutant HSPCs that could allow for their selective targeting in hematologic malignancies.

Abstract: Summary
The precise regulation of synaptic connectivity and function is essential to maintain neuronal circuits. Here, we show that the Drosophila pseudo-kinase Madm/NRBP1 (Mlf-1-adapter-molecule/nuclear-receptor-binding protein 1) is required presynaptically to maintain synaptic stability and to coordinate synaptic growth and function. Presynaptic Madm mediates these functions by controlling cap-dependent translation via the target of rapamycin (TOR) effector 4E-BP/Thor (eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein/Thor). Strikingly, at degenerating neuromuscular synapses, postsynaptic Madm induces a compensatory, transsynaptic signal that utilizes the presynaptic homeostatic potentiation (PHP) machinery to offset synaptic release deficits and to delay synaptic degeneration. Madm is not required for canonical PHP but induces a neurodegeneration-specific form of PHP and acts via the regulation of the cap-dependent translation regulators 4E-BP/Thor and S6-kinase. Consistently, postsynaptic induction of canonical PHP or TOR activation can compensate for postsynaptic Madm to alleviate functional and structural synaptic defects. Our results provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration-induced PHP with potential neurotherapeutic applications.

Abstract: Summary
Neurotransmitters have been well documented to determine immune cell fates; however, whether and how γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) shapes the function of innate immune cells is still obscure. Here, we demonstrate that GABA orchestrates macrophage maturation and inflammation. GABA treatment during macrophage maturation inhibits interleukin (IL)-1β production from inflammatory macrophages. Mechanistically, GABA enhances succinate-flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-lysine specific demethylase1 (LSD1) signaling to regulate histone demethylation of Bcl2l11 and Dusp2, reducing formation of the NLRP3-ASC-Caspase-1 complex. The GABA-succinate axis reduces succinylation of mitochondrial proteins to promote oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). We also find that GABA alleviates lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced sepsis as well as high-fat-diet-induced obesity in mice. Our study shows that GABA regulates pro-inflammatory macrophage responses associated with metabolic reprogramming and protein succinylation, suggesting a strategy for treating macrophage-related inflammatory diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Using spatial cell-type-enriched transcriptomics, we compare plaque-induced gene (PIG) expression in microglia-touching plaques, neighboring plaques, and far from plaques in an aged Alzheimer’s mouse model with late plaque development. In 18-month-old APPNL-F/NL-F knockin mice, with and without the Alzheimer’s disease risk mutation Trem2R47H/R47H, we report that expression of 38/55 PIGs have plaque-induced microglial upregulation, with a subset only upregulating in microglia directly contacting plaques. For seven PIGs, including Trem2, this upregulation is prevented in APPNL-F/NL-FTrem2R47H/R47H mice. These TREM2-dependent genes are all involved in phagocytic and degradative processes that we show correspond to a decrease in phagocytic markers and an increase in the density of small plaques in Trem2-mutated mice. Furthermore, despite the R47H mutation preventing increased Trem2 gene expression, TREM2 protein levels and microglial density are still marginally increased on plaques. Hence, both microglial contact with plaques and functioning TREM2 are necessary for microglia to respond appropriately to amyloid pathology.

Abstract: Exogenous polyamines are able to induce life span and improve glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. However, the effects of exogenous polyamines on adipocyte differentiation and which polyamine transporters mediate them have not been elucidated yet. Here, we identified for the first time that exogenous polyamines can clearly stimulate adipocyte differentiation through polyamine transporters, solute carrier family 3 member A2 (SLC3A2) and SLC7A1. Exogenous polyamines markedly promote 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation by increasing the intracellular lipid accumulation and the expression of both adipogenic and lipogenic genes in a concentration-dependent manner. In particular, exogenous putrescine mainly regulates adipocyte differentiation in the early and intermediate stages. Moreover, we have assessed the expression of polyamine transporter genes in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and adipocytes. Interestingly, the putrescine-induced adipocyte differentiation was found to be significantly suppressed in response to a treatment with a polyamine transporter inhibitor (AMXT-1501). Furthermore, knockdown experiments using siRNA that specifically targeted SLC3A2 or SLC7A2, revealed that both SLC3A2 and SLC7A2 act as important transporters in the cellular importing of exogenous putrescine. Thus, the exogenous putrescine entering the adipocytes via cellular transporters is involved in adipogenesis through a modulation of both the mitotic clonal expansion and the expression of master transcription factors. Taken together, these results suggest that exogenous polyamines (such as putrescine) entering the adipocytes through polyamine transporters, can stimulate adipogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Identifying symptom-specific convergent mechanisms for neurodevelopmental disorders is a promising strategy in advancing therapies. Here, we show that bidirectional dysregulation of Rac1 activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) dictates shared social deficits in mice. Selective upregulation or downregulation of Rac1 activity in glutamatergic or fast-spiking GABAergic neurons results in excessive or inadequate control of excitability combined with a decrease in glutamate or an increase in GABA concentrations and an increase in the GABA/glutamate ratio, which is responsible for social deficits. Notably, the autism model of Shank3B knockout mice exhibits aberrantly enhanced Rac1 activity, reduced glutamate concentrations, and pyramidal neuron excitability in mPFC accompanied with social deficits, which were corrected by either excitatory-neuron-specific downregulation of Rac1 activity or upregulation of neuronal excitability. Thus, this work shows a convergence between genetic autism risk factors, dysregulation of Rac1 signaling, and excitation-inhibition imbalance, enabling mechanism-based stratification of patients with social deficits.

Abstract: Summary
A collective cell motility event that occurs during Drosophila eye development, ommatidial rotation (OR), serves as a paradigm for signaling-pathway-regulated directed movement of cell clusters. OR is instructed by the EGFR and Notch pathways and Frizzled/planar cell polarity (Fz/PCP) signaling, all of which are associated with photoreceptor R3 and R4 specification. Here, we show that Abl kinase negatively regulates OR through its activity in the R3/R4 pair. Abl is localized to apical junctional regions in R4, but not in R3, during OR, and this apical localization requires Notch signaling. We demonstrate that Abl and Notch interact genetically during OR, and Abl co-immunoprecipitates in complexes with Notch in eye discs. Perturbations of Abl interfere with adherens junctional organization of ommatidial preclusters, which mediate the OR process. Together, our data suggest that Abl kinase acts directly downstream of Notch in R4 to fine-tune OR via its effect on adherens junctions.

Abstract: Summary
Plant root architecture flexibly adapts to changing nitrate (NO3−) availability in the soil; however, the underlying molecular mechanism of this adaptive development remains under-studied. To explore the regulation of NO3−-mediated root growth, we screened for low-nitrate-resistant mutant (lonr) and identified mutants that were defective in the NAC transcription factor NAC075 (lonr1) as being less sensitive to low NO3− in terms of primary root growth. We show that NAC075 is a mobile transcription factor relocating from the root stele tissues to the endodermis based on NO3− availability. Under low-NO3− availability, the kinase CBL-interacting protein kinase 1 (CIPK1) is activated, and it phosphorylates NAC075, restricting its movement from the stele, which leads to the transcriptional regulation of downstream target WRKY53, consequently leading to adapted root architecture. Our work thus identifies an adaptive mechanism involving translocation of transcription factor based on nutrient availability and leading to cell-specific reprogramming of plant root growth.

Abstract: Summary
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) can be ameliorated by calorie restriction, which leads to the suppressed somatotroph axis. Paradoxically, the suppressed somatotroph axis is associated with patients with NAFLD and is correlated with the severity of fibrosis. How the somatotroph axis becomes dysregulated and whether the repressed somatotroph axis impacts liver damage during the progression of NAFLD are unclear. Here, we identify a regulatory branch of the hepatic integrated stress response (ISR), which represses the somatotroph axis in hepatocytes through ATF3, resulting in enhanced cell survival and reduced cell proliferation. In mouse models of NAFLD, the ISR represses the somatotroph axis, leading to reduced apoptosis and inflammation but decreased hepatocyte proliferation and exacerbated fibrosis in the liver. NAD+ repletion reduces the ISR, rescues the dysregulated somatotroph axis, and alleviates NAFLD. These results establish that the hepatic ISR suppresses the somatotroph axis to control cell fate decisions and liver damage in NAFLD.

Abstract: Summary
Maintaining an appropriate balance between excitation and inhibition is critical for neuronal information processing. Cortical neurons can cell-autonomously adjust the inhibition they receive to individual levels of excitatory input, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. We describe that Ste20-like kinase (SLK) mediates cell-autonomous regulation of excitation-inhibition balance in the thalamocortical feedforward circuit, but not in the feedback circuit. This effect is due to regulation of inhibition originating from parvalbumin-expressing interneurons, while inhibition via somatostatin-expressing interneurons is unaffected. Computational modeling shows that this mechanism promotes stable excitatory-inhibitory ratios across pyramidal cells and ensures robust and sparse coding. Patch-clamp RNA sequencing yields genes differentially regulated by SLK knockdown, as well as genes associated with excitation-inhibition balance participating in transsynaptic communication and cytoskeletal dynamics. These data identify a mechanism for cell-autonomous regulation of a specific inhibitory circuit that is critical to ensure that a majority of cortical pyramidal cells participate in information coding.

Abstract: Summary
The chaperone SecB has been implicated in de novo protein folding and translocation across the membrane, but it remains unclear which nascent polypeptides SecB binds, when during translation SecB acts, how SecB function is coordinated with other chaperones and targeting factors, and how polypeptide engagement contributes to protein biogenesis. Using selective ribosome profiling, we show that SecB binds many nascent cytoplasmic and translocated proteins generally late during translation and controlled by the chaperone trigger factor. Revealing an uncharted role in co-translational translocation, inner membrane proteins (IMPs) are the most prominent nascent SecB interactors. Unlike other substrates, IMPs are bound early during translation, following the membrane targeting by the signal recognition particle. SecB remains bound until translation is terminated, and contributes to membrane insertion. Our study establishes a role of SecB in the co-translational maturation of proteins from all cellular compartments and functionally implicates cytosolic chaperones in membrane protein biogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Acquired chromosomal instability, especially copy number variations (CNVs), has been considered an important determinant of cancer progression and clinical survival. However, the functional role of aberrant CNV-induced lncRNAs in tumorigenesis remains unexplored. Here, we identify a CNV-induced MSC-antisense-transcript 1 (MAT1) lncRNA that plays an oncogenic role in promoting tumorigenesis of uveal melanoma in orthotopic and metastatic xenografts. In addition, our data suggest that MAT1 interrupts the interaction between the MLL1 complex and the PCDH20 promoter by forming an RNA-DNA triplex structure, subsequently abolishing H3K4 trimethylation and inactivating transcription of tumor suppressor PCDH20 to accelerate tumorigenesis. Our data show an intriguing insulation pattern of H3K4 histone modification in tumorigenesis mediated by a lncRNA, thereby providing an alternative mechanism for noncoding blockers in gene regulation.

Abstract: Summary
The septin collar of budding yeast is an ordered array of septin filaments that serves a scaffolding function for the cytokinetic machinery at the bud neck and compartmentalizes the membrane between mother and daughter cell. How septin architecture is aided by septin-binding proteins is largely unknown. Syp1 is an endocytic protein that was implicated in the timely recruitment of septins to the newly forming collar through an unknown mechanism. Using advanced microscopy and in vitro reconstitution assays, we show that Syp1 is able to align laterally and tightly pack septin filaments, thereby forming flat bundles or sheets. This property is shared by the Syp1 mammalian counterpart FCHo2, thus emphasizing conserved protein functions. Interestingly, the septin-bundling activity of Syp1 resides mainly in its intrinsically disordered region. Our data uncover the mechanism through which Syp1 promotes septin collar assembly and offer another example of functional diversity of unstructured protein domains.

Abstract: Summary
The precise mechanism by which gut dysbiosis contributes to the pathogenesis of extraintestinal diseases and how commensal microbes mediate these processes remain unclear. Here, we show that cows with mastitis had marked gut dysbiosis, characterized by the enrichment of opportunistic pathogenic Escherichia_Shigella and the depletion of commensal Roseburia. Fecal microbiota transplantation from donor cows with mastitis (M-FMT) to recipient mice significantly caused mastitis and changed the gut and mammary microbiota in mice. Notably, M-FMT facilitated the translocation of pathobiont from the gut into the mammary gland, and the depletion of Enterobacteriaceae alleviated M-FMT-induced mastitis in mice. In contrast, commensal Roseburia intestinalis improved M-FMT-induced mastitis and microbial dysbiosis in the gut and mammary gland and limited bacterial translocation by producing butyrate, which was associated with inflammatory signaling inhibition and barrier repair. Our research suggests that commensal Roseburia alleviates gut-dysbiosis-induced mastitis, although further studies in dairy cows and humans are needed.

Abstract: Summary
Monocytes are highly plastic immune cells that modulate antitumor immunity. Therefore, identifying factors that regulate tumor monocyte functions is critical for developing effective immunotherapies. Here, we determine that endogenous cancer cell-derived type I interferons (IFNs) control monocyte functional polarization. Guided by single-cell transcriptomic profiling of human and mouse tumors, we devise a strategy to distinguish and separate immunostimulatory from immunosuppressive tumor monocytes by surface CD88 and Sca-1 expression. Leveraging this approach, we show that cGAS-STING-regulated cancer cell-derived IFNs polarize immunostimulatory monocytes associated with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy response in mice. We also demonstrate that immunosuppressive monocytes convert into immunostimulatory monocytes upon cancer cell-intrinsic cGAS-STING activation. Consistently, we find that human cancer cells can produce type I IFNs that polarize monocytes, and our immunostimulatory monocyte gene signature is enriched in patient tumors that respond to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Our work exposes a role for cancer cell-derived IFNs in licensing monocyte functions that influence immunotherapy outcomes.

Abstract: Summary
Mitotic chromosomes in different organisms adopt various dimensions. What defines these dimensions is scarcely understood. Here, we compare mitotic chromosomes in budding and fission yeasts harboring similarly sized genomes distributed among 16 or 3 chromosomes, respectively. Hi-C analyses and superresolution microscopy reveal that budding yeast chromosomes are characterized by shorter-ranging mitotic chromatin contacts and are thinner compared with the thicker fission yeast chromosomes that contain longer-ranging mitotic contacts. These distinctions persist even after budding yeast chromosomes are fused to form three fission-yeast-length entities, revealing a species-specific organizing principle. Species-specific widths correlate with the known binding site intervals of the chromosomal condensin complex. Unexpectedly, within each species, we find that longer chromosome arms are always thicker and harbor longer-ranging contacts, a trend that we also observe with human chromosomes. Arm length as a chromosome width determinant informs mitotic chromosome formation models.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanisms leading to adrenal cortex development and steroid synthesis in humans remain poorly understood due to the paucity of model systems. Herein, we recapitulate human fetal adrenal cortex specification processes through stepwise induction of human-induced pluripotent stem cells through posterior intermediate mesoderm-like and adrenocortical progenitor-like states to ultimately generate fetal zone adrenal-cortex-like cells (FZLCs), as evidenced by histomorphological, ultrastructural, and transcriptome features and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-independent Δ5 steroid biosynthesis. Furthermore, FZLC generation is promoted by SHH and inhibited by NOTCH, ACTIVIN, and WNT signaling, and steroid synthesis is amplified by ACTH/PKA signaling and blocked by inhibitors of Δ5 steroid synthesis enzymes. Finally, NR5A1 promotes FZLC survival and steroidogenesis. Together, these findings provide a framework for understanding and reconstituting human adrenocortical development in vitro, paving the way for cell-based therapies of adrenal insufficiency.

Abstract: Summary
T cell receptors (TCRs) recognize peptide fragments presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and are critical to T cell-mediated immunity. Recent data have indicated that genetic diversity within TCR-encoding gene regions is underexplored, limiting understanding of the impact of TCR loci polymorphisms on TCR function in disease, even though TCR repertoire signatures (1) are heritable and (2) associate with disease phenotypes. To address this, we developed a targeted long-read sequencing approach to generate highly accurate haplotype resolved assemblies of the TCR beta (TRB) and alpha/delta (TRA/D) loci, facilitating the genotyping of all variant types, including structural variants. We validate our approach using two mother-father-child trios and 5 unrelated donors representing multiple populations. This resulted in improved genotyping accuracy and the discovery of 84 undocumented V, D, J, and C alleles, demonstrating the utility of this framework for improving our understanding of TCR diversity and function in disease.

Abstract: Summary
Lung CD8+ memory T cells play central roles in protective immunity to respiratory viruses, such as influenza A virus (IAV). Here, we find that alveolar macrophages (AMs) function as antigen-presenting cells that support the expansion of lung CD8+ memory T cells. Intranasal antigen administration to mice subcutaneously immunized with antigen results in a rapid expansion of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in the lung, which is dependent on antigen cross-presentation by AMs. AMs highly express interleukin-18 (IL-18), which mediates subsequent formation of CD103+CD8+ resident memory T (TRM) cells in the lung. In a mouse model of IAV infection, AMs are required for expansion of virus-specific CD8+ T cells and CD103+CD8+ TRM cells and inhibiting virus replication in the lungs during secondary infection. These results suggest that AMs instruct a rapid expansion of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in lung, which protect the host from respiratory virus infection.
