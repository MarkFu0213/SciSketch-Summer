Abstract: Insulin triggers glucose uptake into skeletal muscle and adipose tissues by gaining the available number of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) on the cell surface. GLUT4-loaded vesicles are targeted to plasma membrane from the intracellular reservoir through multiple trafficking and fusion processes that are mainly regulated by Akt. However, it is still largely unknown how GLUT4 expression in the cell surface is promoted by insulin. In the present study, we identified tomosyn at Ser-783 as a possible Akt-substrate motif and examined whether the phosphorylation at Ser-783 is involved in the regulation of GLUT4 expression. Both Akt1 and Akt2 phosphorylated the wild-type tomosyn, but not the mutant tomosyn in which Ser-783 was replaced with Ala. Phosphorylation of tomosyn at Ser-783 was also observed in the intact cells by insulin stimulation, which was blocked by PI3K inhibitor, LY294002. In vitro pull-down assay showed that phosphorylation of tomosyn at Ser-783 by Akt inhibited the interaction with syntaxin 4. Insulin stimulation increased GLUT4 in the cell surface of CHO-K1 cells to promote glucose uptake, however exogenous expression of the mutant tomosyn attenuated the increase by insulin. These results suggest that Ser-783 of tomosyn is a target of Akt and is implicated in the interaction with syntaxin 4.

Abstract: A simple and non toxic method is reported for fabrication of metal sulfide foams such as Cu2S, Ag2S and CdS. The presented method is mainly based on the electrochemical fabrication of metal foam and galvanic replacement reaction. Cu2S and Ag2S foams are synthesized by immersing as-fabricated Cu and Ag foams in aqueous sulfide solution. Furthermore, another method is used for fabrication of Ag2S foam based on immersing of as-prepared Cu2S foam in AgNO3 solution. Electrodeposition of CdS on as-fabricated Cu foam electrode is performed potentiostatically using a two electrode setup in an aqueous solution of CdSO4, EDTA, and Na2S2O3. The synthesis process is rapid and convenient. The as-fabricated foams were characterized through XRD, BET, SEM and EDX analysis. The obtained data revile fabrication of Cu2S, Ag2S and CdS foams with porous and ramified walls and high surface area. The applicability of as-fabricated Cu2S in the photodegradation of methylene blue is reported, as a proof of concept. The proposed approaches demonstrate a practical route toward preparation of porous metal sulfide foams via electrodeposition and galvanic replacement.

Abstract: Liquid phase crystallization of silicon is a promising technology to grow crystalline silicon thin films on glass. It has already been demonstrated that open circuit voltages of up to 656mV and efficiencies of up to 11.8% can be achieved by this technique. Nevertheless further improvements are required to become competitive with wafer based silicon solar cells. A possibility to improve the quality is to enlarge the grain size and to control the crystallographic orientation of the resulting layers. While a preferential {100} surface orientation can be triggered utilizing suitable crystallization parameters, the in-plane orientation still remains random. Also the grain size stays within the same range. By introducing a local monocrystalline seed at the beginning of the crystallization process, we are able to control both the surface and the in-plane orientation of the silicon films. In addition the grain size is significantly increased in scanning direction and only limited by the substrate size of 5cm. This high morphological quality is accompanied by an improved electrical quality confirmed by photoluminescence imaging and Hall measurements. This is a big step towards the final goal to directly grow monocrystalline silicon thin films on glass substrates.

Paeoniflorin diminishes ConA-induced IL-8 production in primary human hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells in the involvement of ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation,

Abstract: Liver diseases are closely associated with elevated levels of interleukin-8 (IL-8), suggesting the ability to inhibit IL-8 production could enhance the treatment of liver diseases. Paeoniflorin is a major active constituent of dried Paeoniae Radix Alba root (Baishao in Chinese) which is widely used in China to treat liver diseases. We examined the effects and underlying mechanisms of paeoniflorin on IL-8 production in primary human hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (HHSECs). Concanavalin A (ConA) at 20μg/mL produced a 5.2-fold increase in IL-8 mRNA by 8h, and a 14.2-fold rise in IL-8 levels by 16h. Inhibition of MEK (ERK kinase) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) by PD98059 and U0126, or inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) by LY294002 blocked both ConA-induced IL-8 mRNA expression and IL-8 secretion. Paeoniflorin reduced ConA-induced IL-8 mRNA expression and IL-8 release by 57.9% and 52.8%, respectively, and also decreased ConA-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt, suggesting paeoniflorin inhibits IL-8 expression and release by inhibiting the ERK1/2 and Akt pathways. Combining paeoniflorin with U0126 or LY294002 at low doses showed supra-additive inhibition of not only phospho-ERK1/2 and phospho-Akt by 46.4% and 35.0%, but also IL-8 release by 42.4% and 36.1% and IL-8 mRNA expression by 43.5% and 31.8%, respectively. In conclusion, paeoniflorin most likely contributes to the therapy for liver disease by exerting anti-inflammatory effects on HHSECs through blocking IL-8 secretion via downregulation of ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation.

Abstract: Ribonuclease like 5 (Rnasel5) is a novel member of the zebrafish ribonuclease A family and its expression is increased during early embryogenesis. However, the in vivo biological function of Rnasel5 remains to be elucidated. Here, we report that knockdown of Rnasel5 by morhpolinos caused shrunken yolk extension as well as increased DNA damage at yolk syncytial layer and external tissue layers via the activation of p53 pathway. In addition, the morphological defects caused by Rnasel5 knockdown can be partially rescued by mRNA injection. Our findings provide the first functional characterization of Rnasel5 in zebrafish development and reveal its critical role in yolk extension by modulation of the p53 pathway.

Abstract: Development of inexpensive and flexible solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) is critically important for the cost-effective electrochromic device (ECD) fabrication. The SPEs are also an integral part of the flexible ECDs which are projected to boost up the ECD's usability in several unexplored areas. Here we report the synthesis of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) based aprotic salt (LiClO4) containing SPEs, which are more or less electrochemically benign in the normal ECD operational voltage window. Experiments verified that the developed SPEs have good luminous clarity (transmittance>92%), high ionic conductivity of the order of 10−4S/cm and excellent dimensional stability, all of which are required for the ideal ECD operations. Impedance spectroscopy showed an enhancement in the ionic conductivity and decrease in the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) resistance with increasing salt loading. Two different device configurations using these SPEs were fabricated and then subjected to detailed electrochemical studies. Comprehensive analysis established long term cyclic durability of the SPEs. Prototype ECDs fabricated using these SPEs rendered excellent optical modulation and coloration reversibility.

Abstract: Jumonji C (JmjC) domain-containing proteins are a diverse superfamily of proteins containing a characteristic, evolutionarily conserved β-barrel structure that normally contains binding sites for Fe(II) and α-ketoglutarate. In the best studied JmjC-domain proteins, the JmjC barrel has a histone demethylase catalytic activity. Histones are evolutionarily conserved proteins intimately involved in the packaging of DNA within the nucleus of eukaryotic organisms. The N-termini (“tails”) of the histone proteins are subject to a diverse array of posttranslational modifications including methylation. Unlike many of the other histone modifications which are transient, methylation was thought to be permanent, until the relatively recent identification of the first demethylases. Jumonji C domain-containing proteins were first identified with a role in the modulation of histone methylation marks. This family of proteins is broken up into seven distinct subgroups based on domain architecture and their ability to antagonize specific histone methylation marks. Their biological functions derive from their ability to regulate gene expression and include roles in cell differentiation, growth, proliferation, and stress responses. However, one subgroup remains, the largest, in which the JmjC domain has no known biochemical function. These proteins belong to the JmjC-domain-only subgroup and as their name suggests, the only bioinformatically recognizable domain they contain is the highly conserved JmjC domain.

Abstract: An electrochemically active biofilm-assisted visible light active Ag@m-TiO2 photocatalyst was fabricated. The resulting nanocomposite was characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, diffuse absorbance/reflectance spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The photocatalyst showed high photocatalytic activity and photoelectrochemical behavior due to the synergistic effect of the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) and the induced defects in TiO2 (m-TiO2) nanoparticles. Ag@m-TiO2 nanocomposite showed much higher light harvesting ability because of the reduced band gap of m-TiO2 as well as the SPR characteristics of the AgNPs. The visible light photocatalytic experiments showed that the Ag@m-TiO2 nanocomposite possessed excellent photocatalytic activity for the degradation of methyl orange and methylene blue dyes under visible light irradiation compared to the Ag@p-TiO2 nanocomposite as well as p-TiO2 and m-TiO2 nanoparticles. Photoelectrochemical measurements, such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and linear scan voltammetry in the dark and under visible light irradiation, further supported the visible light active behavior of the Ag@m-TiO2 nanocomposite.

Abstract: To determine the pharmacologic activity of (−)-lobeline between human (h)α4β2 and hα4β4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), functional and structural experiments were performed. The Ca2+ influx results established that (−)-lobeline neither actives nor enhances the function of the studied AChR subtypes, but competitively inhibits hα4β4 AChRs with potency ∼10-fold higher than that for hα4β2 AChRs. This difference is due to a higher binding affinity for the [3H]cytisine sites at hα4β4 compared to hα4β2 AChRs, which, in turn, can be explained by our molecular dynamics (MD) results: (1) higher stability of (−)-lobeline and its hydrogen bonds within the α4β4 pocket compared to the α4β2 pocket, (2) (−)-lobeline promotes Loop C to cap the binding site at the α4β4 pocket, but forces Loop C to get apart from the α4β2 pocket, precluding the gating process elicited by agonists, and (3) the orientation of (−)-lobeline within the α4β4, but not the α4β2, subpocket, promoted by the t− (or t+) rotameric state of α4-Tyr98, remains unchanged during the whole MD simulation. This study gives a detailed view of the molecular and dynamics events evoked by (−)-lobeline supporting the differential binding affinity and subsequent inhibitory potency between hα4β2 and hα4β4 AChRs, and supports the possibility that the latter subtype is also involved in its activity.

Abstract: Although Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cells have the highest efficiency of any thin-film solar cell, especially when sodium is incorporated, the fundamental device properties of ultrafast carrier transport and recombination in such cells remain not fully understood. Here, we explore the dynamics of charge carriers in CIGS absorber layers with varying concentrations of Na by femtosecond (fs) broadband pump-probe reflectance spectroscopy with 120fs time resolution. By analyzing the time-resolved transient spectra in a different time domain, we show that a small amount of Na integrated by NaF deposition on top of sputtered Cu(In,Ga) prior to selenization forms CIGS, which induces slower recombination of the excited carriers. Here, we provide direct evidence for the elongation of carrier lifetimes by incorporating Na into CIGS.

Abstract: Inkjet printing offers versatility and flexibility for the sequential deposition of functional layers for the production of large area organic photovoltaics (OPV). Four layers of an OPV cell are inkjet printed, comprising an ITO-free semi-transparent front electrode (a metal current collecting grid, inkjet printed PEDOT:PSS and ZnO nanoparticle layers), and the photo-active layer combined with PEDOT:PSS as hole transport layer. To render the process R2R compatible, large area printing is performed using a 3.5cm wide printhead and non-halogenated ink formulations only. Similar performance is achieved for the inkjet printed cells as for cells with only spin coated layers and ITO. For the P3HT/PCBM bulk-heterojunction, a mixture of non-halogenated solvents ensured good solubility, proper printing behavior and a blend morphology that yields similar performance to a layer spin-coated from chlorinated solvents. The potential of inkjet printing for large area OPV was demonstrated by the fabrication of a module with 92cm2 active area, which showed an efficiency of 0.98%. Losses due to front and back electrode resistances are modeled and used to explain the recorded I-V curve. Combining these functional layers with inkjet printed electrodes lays out the roadmap toward fully roll-to-roll compatible digital fabrication of OPV.

Abstract: Up-conversion (UC) is a promising approach to utilize sub-band-gap photons for solar cells (SCs). Due to the non-linear nature of UC, the optimal excitation power regimes between the solar cell semiconductor and the UC material correspond to a difference in solar concentration of more than an order of magnitude. This difference can be bridged with integrated optics by concentrating the photons transmitted through the solar cell to increase the power density and maximize the intensity of UC luminescence. To realize this, dielectric-filled compound parabolic concentrators (CPCs) were used as integrated optics on the rear side of a planar bifacial silicon solar cell together with a 25% Er3+ doped hexagonal sodium yttrium fluoride (β-NaYF4:Er) UC phosphor. An efficiency increase of 32% from 0.123% to 0.163% under sub-band-gap illumination is quantified by means of the first ever reported I–V characteristics for an up-conversion solar cell (UC-SC) based on c-Si. An enhancement in external quantum efficiency (EQE) is obtained from 1.33% for the non-concentrating reference UC-SC to 1.80% for a solar cell with integrated optics for an excitation at 1523nm with an irradiance of 0.024W/cm2, corresponding to a normalized EQE of 0.75W/cm2. This demonstrates that CPCs are suitable for UC-SC as they increase the concentration in the forwards direction, while maintaining high collection efficiency of the UC emission in the reverse direction. In addition, such an approach enables the optimization of the solar concentration on the UC phosphor independently from the concentration required for the solar cell.

Abstract: Accurate translation of the genetic code into functional polypeptides is key to cellular growth and proliferation. This essential process is carried out by the ribosome, a ribonucleoprotein complex of remarkable size and intricacy. Although the structure of the mature ribosome has provided insight into the mechanism of translation, our knowledge regarding the assembly, quality control, and intracellular targeting of this molecular machine is still emerging. Assembly of the eukaryotic ribosome begins in the nucleolus and requires more than 350 conserved assembly factors, which transiently associate with the preribosome at specific maturation stages. After accomplishing their tasks, early-acting assembly factors are released, preparing preribosomes for nuclear export. Export competent preribosomal subunits are transported through nuclear pore complexes into the cytoplasm, where they undergo final maturation steps, which are closely connected to quality control, before engaging in translation. In this chapter, we focus on the final events that commit correctly assembled ribosomal subunits for translation.

Abstract: Photo-driven catalytic (PDC) water splitting, using either photoelectrochemical cells (PEC-cells), PV-electrolyzers, or some hybrid system in-between, has attracted a lot of attention. In single-cell device architectures for solar hydrogen production, based on single band gap photoabsorbers, there is a fundamental efficiency problem originating from the energy distribution of the solar spectrum and the thermodynamic and kinetic requirements for splitting water. The minimum band gap for a single-junction device in order to withhold unbiased overall water splitting is considered to be at least 2.0eV. This is far from the 1.35eV which is the optimal band gap of a semiconductor for maximum power conversion of light in the solar spectrum. This discrepancy has been termed as the solar spectrum mismatch problem (the SSM-problem). The standard solution to this problem is to construct tandem devices, whereas an alternative is to interconnect several one band gap cells in series, side by side. Both approaches enable the use of low energy photons in the solar spectrum while still providing a sufficiently high photopotential for driving the full reaction, without seriously compromising with the area efficiency. In this paper, the tandem and serial architectures for handling the SSM-problem are analyzed and compared. The analysis is focused towards differences in the limits of optical absorption, the optimal number of optical absorbers, and their corresponding band gaps. Taking losses due to charge carrier separation and catalysis into account, the maximum STH-efficiency for a series interconnected solar splitting device was found to be 24.6%, compared to 32.0% for an optimum tandem device at 1Sun (air mass 1.5, 1000Wm−2). This can be compared with the maximum efficiency of 18.0% for an ideal single band gap photoabsorber in single junction device. The analysis shows that the maximum STH efficiency limits for series interconnected architectures for unassisted solar water splitting are not particularly far behind the more commonly studied tandem devices. They could then be an interesting alternative given the simplicity and versatility of series interconnected device architectures. The analysis also compares how tandem devices and series interconnected devices can differ in terms of charge carrier separation, charge carrier transport, catalysis, overall efficiency, device architecture, and expected cost.

Abstract: Single layer black selective coatings for solar thermal energy conversion were produced by low cost sol–gel dip-coating, spin-coating and coil-coating methods, the last made on the industrial line of the Alanod company (DE). For the deposition, pigment dispersion was prepared by milling a mixture of a black spinel (FeMnO4) pigment, whose surface was modified with trisilanol heptaisobutyl POSS dispersant, dried and re-milled with (3-glycidoxypropyl)trimethoxysilane (GLYMO) and Ti(i-OPr)4 acting as binders. The corresponding organic–inorganic hybrid consisted of silica clusters linked together with poly(ethyleneoxide) chains acting as a network former. The as-prepared nanocomposite dispersion served for the deposition of coil absorber coatings (~800m) on aluminium coil in an industrial plant in the Alanod factory. They gave solar absorptance of 0.905 and thermal emittance of 0.12 and excellent homogeneity. The stability of the coatings at 400°C was excellent but corrosion resistance was moderate (5 days in salt spray). The coil absorber coating was then used for making a High Power (HIPO) solar coating with solar absorptance of 0.92 and thermal emittance of 0.075, which was achieved by exposure of the as-prepared coil to 400°C. The isoconversion kinetics approach was used for assessing the thermal loading (time and temperature of heat treatment) required to provide a HIPO coating from the coil absorber. The improvement of selectivity was investigated by infrared spectroscopy and XPS measurements, revealing that HIPO coatings deposited on stainless steel (AISI 316) survived 1216h at 460°C and 400h at 500°C without any change of selectivity, while after exposure to 500°C for 1216h, thermal emittance increased to 5–7% but solar absorptance remained unchanged. Thermal emittance changes observed at thermal loading were explained with the help of infrared spectra analysis, revealing the formation of iron oxide on the surface of the HIPO coating. The deposited HIPO coating is an interesting option for temperature and corrosion stable coatings for applications in concentrated solar power (CSP) plants for solar processing heat generation.

Abstract: Polygonal ZnO nanorods are synthesized with a hydrothermal technique and coated with an ultrathin CdS layer. A NiO cocatalyst layer is then deposited on the surface of the CdS coated ZnO and makes up a three-component nanostructured composite photoelectrode (NiO/CdS@ZnO). This composite photoelectrode shows an improved photoelectrochemical performance under Air Mass 1.5 (AM 1.5) simulated sunlight. It generates a photocurrent density of 950µA/cm2 with a comparatively low potential −0.6V vs. Ag/AgCl in a 0.5M Na2S and Na2SO3 solution, which is 6.78 times as much as that of the as-grown ZnO nanorods. Furthermore, it is also an efficient photoanode to split pure water, producing a photocurrent density of 530µA/cm2 at 0.5V vs. Ag/AgCl in a 1M Na2SO4 solution. In the composite, ZnO nanorods absorb UV light with a wide band gap, 3.2eV, while CdS, with a narrow band gap (2.4eV), utilizes the remaining visible light, furthermore, an ordered transfer of the charge carriers occurs in the component phases. The photoluminescence (PL) experiment results prove that the direct loading of NiO on ZnO results in an inactive material. However, both the CdS/ZnO and NiO/CdS@ZnO composites are active and the charge carrier separations in them are effectively improved than in the as-grown ZnO.

Abstract: The electrospray (ES) process has emerged as a scalable and efficient fabrication method for organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs). However, the ES process could often involve numerous parameters, which impose a major challenge on uncovering the interplay among process, morphology of active layers, and device performance. This work attempts to reduce the parameter space and capture the essence of the ES process using the Damkhöler (Da) number of evaporation, which is the ratio of the droplet residence time over evaporation time. We first derived an explicit equation for Da that links nine different parameters affecting the process. Experimental results indicate that Da number shows strong effect on morphology and crystallinity of the active layer composed of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). Most remarkably, the power conversion efficiency exhibits monotonically dependence on Da values spanning more than one order of magnitude, e.g., from 0.13 to 1.52. This finding suggests that Da number analysis can reduce the large parameter space in electrospray deposition, thus provides a simple way to control and predict the morphology of active layer and the performance of the solar cells.

PPARδ modulates oxLDL-induced apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells through a TGF-β/FAK signaling axis,

Abstract: The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARδ) has been implicated in the modulation of vascular homeostasis. However, its roles in the apoptotic cell death of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that PPARδ modulates oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-induced apoptosis of VSMCs through the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling pathways. Activation of PPARδ by GW501516, which is a specific ligand, significantly inhibited oxLDL-induced cell death and generation of reactive oxygen species in VSMCs. These inhibitory effects were significantly reversed in the presence of small interfering (si)RNA against PPARδ, or by blockade of the TGF-β or FAK signaling pathways. Furthermore, PPARδ-mediated recovery of FAK phosphorylation suppressed by oxLDL was reversed by SB431542, a specific ALK5 receptor inhibitor, indicating that a TGF-β/FAK signaling axis is involved in the action of PPARδ. Among the protein kinases activated by oxLDL, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase was suppressed by ligand-activated PPARδ. In addition, oxLDL-induced expression and translocation of pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic factors were markedly affected in the presence of GW501516. Those effects were reversed by PPARδ siRNA, or inhibitors of TGF-β or FAK, which also suggests that PPARδ exerts its anti-apoptotic effect via a TGF-β/FAK signaling axis. Taken together, these findings indicate that PPARδ plays an important role in the pathophysiology of disease associated with apoptosis of VSMC, such as atherosclerosis and restanosis.

Abstract: Complement receptor 2 (CR2/CD21) plays an important role in the generation of normal B cell immune responses. As transcription appears to be the prime mechanism via which surface CR2/CD21 expression is controlled, understanding transcriptional regulation of this gene will have broader implications to B cell biology. Here we report opposing, cell-context specific control of CR2/CD21 promoter activity by tandem E-box elements, spaced 22bp apart and within 70bp of the transcription initiation site. We have identified E2A and USF transcription factors as binding to the distal and proximal E-box sites respectively in CR2-positive B-cells, at a site that is hypersensitive to restriction enzyme digestion compared to non-expressing K562 cells. However, additional unidentified proteins have also been found to bind these functionally important elements. By utilizing a proteomics approach we have identified a repressor protein, RP58, binding the distal E-box motif. Co-transfection experiments using RP58 overexpression constructs demonstrated a specific 10-fold repression of CR2/CD21 transcriptional activity mediated through the distal E-box repressor element. Taken together, our results indicate that repression of the CR2/CD21 promoter can occur through one of the E-box motifs via recruitment of RP58 and other factors to bring about a silenced chromatin context within CR2/CD21 non-expressing cells.

Abstract: Carrier transport through a tunnel barrier was modeled and implemented in the numerical device simulator AFORS-HET, which allows calculating the tunnel current between two semiconductor layers or between a metallic contact and a semiconductor layer. Rectangular barriers have been considered, for which an exact quantum solution for the transmission probability can be derived. The implementation in the simulation program was made by approximating the tunnel-interlayer as a “membrane” which modifies the current at the semiconductor/tunnel layer interface, without the need of inserting an additional insulator layer. It is demonstrated that this approximate description of the structure allows to simulate solar cells where tunneling across an insulator plays an important role. The model is then used to investigate new hole collector designs based on a tunnel oxide. It is shown, that the tunnel layer increases the selectivity of the contact for hole extraction, such that very high power conversion efficiencies can be reached.

Abstract: In this work we present a transparent conductive oxide (TCO)-free flexible perovskite planar heterojunction solar cell made with a semitransparent anode realized with a highly conductive poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) PEDOT:PSS (PH1000 by Clevios) modified with ethylene glycol layer, deposited via spray coating. We investigated several formulations of PEDOT:PSS modified by addition of solvents with high boiling point such as ethylene glycol (EG) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Optimized samples show a 65% transmittance at 550nm and a sheet resistance of 28Ω/□. On these optimized electrodes we fabricated a TCO-free flexible device, the best of which exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 4.9% under 100mW/cm2 illumination at AM1.5G. The efficiency of the perovskite planar-heterojunction solar cell, with the modified PEDOT:PSS anode was comparable to the one realized on a PET–ITO anode. Moreover, in the bending test, ITO-free flexible solar cell manifested superior mechanical robustness, showing the high flexibility of the perovskite layer.

Abstract: Silicon germanium (Si1−xGex) is a material with high mobility and relatively low bandgap making it an attractive candidate for the bottom subcell in a multi-junction solar cell. Optical constants of Si1−xGex films grown on silicon substrates with germanium (Ge) compositions of 77%, 82%, 85% and 88% from wavelength of 400nm to 1450nm at room temperature are reported. Spectroscopic ellipsometry is used to obtain the real part of refractive index for the whole wavelength range and the extinction coefficients for short wavelengths. Optical transmittance ratio of two structures being different only in the thicknesses of the Si1−xGex films is used to extract the extinction coefficients for long wavelengths. We demonstrate that the optical constants of Si1−xGex films grown on silicon substrates with the aid of graded buffer layers are similar to that of their corresponding bulk materials. However, the absorption coefficients of Si1−xGex with 88% Ge determined by us at around 1000nm is three times higher than previously interpolated results. The main reason for this discrepancy may be due to the inaccuracy of interpolation in the wavelength range where the material's bandgap changes very quickly. In addition, it should be noted that the Ge composition of the Si1−xGex films we are able to obtain are determined to be ±1% which is much more accurate than the previous experimentally determined results which have an accuracy of ±5%.

Abstract: Iron is an omnipresent and efficiency-limiting impurity in p-type silicon solar cells. A very useful technique to detect the interstitial iron concentration in boron doped silicon is based on carrier lifetime measurements at two metastable states of iron, namely interstitial and bound to boron. We present a further development of this technique which images the iron concentration not only on wafer level but also on finished solar cells and in this way enables the most direct access to the impact of interstitial iron on cell performance. With the help of this method we reveal that remaining iron in solar cells may be responsible for significantly unstable current–voltage characteristic under illumination. Recommendations for stable cell measurements even for cells containing a significant concentration of iron are given.

Abstract: Antireflection coatings have received a great importance due to their ability to enhance the efficiency of the solar cells and solar selective coatings by minimizing the reflections of the incident light from the front surface. In this study, a silica (SiO2) sol, prepared using sol–gel process, was deposited on cleaned glass substrates by dip coating method and subjected to heat treatment at 400°C. The thickness and porosity of the coating were optimized to achieve high transmittance. The thickness was optimized by varying the lifting speed of the substrate from the sol. The porosity was induced in the coating by using polymeric additives and through heat treatments. The optimized single layer SiO2 coating on cleaned glass substrate exhibited a maximum transmittance of 97.5% at λ=500nm wavelength. The hybrid sol was found to give reproducible coatings up to a period of 30 days when stored at 16°C. The present process provides a simple and cost effective method for the preparation of antireflection coatings, which have huge potential to enhance the efficiency of solar cells, receiver tubes and other solar devices.

Abstract: Nano-textured transparent electrodes are commonly used to receive higher light absorption in inverted polymer solar cells (IPSC). However, the performance of the device is often restricted by the highly rough morphology of the textured transparent electrode. In this work, a Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) interlayer was inserted as a surface modifier in IPSCs based on a fluorine-doped SnO2 electrode (FTO). The inserted layer facilitates electron extraction due to improved interface morphology of the AZO electron transport layer (ETL). This enhancement resulted in an approximately 63% increase in power conversion efficiency from 2.52% to 4.14% of IPSCs based on the FTO electrode compared to solar cells without PVP layer.

Abstract: Clotrimazole (CTZ) has been proposed as an antitumoral agent because of its properties that inhibit glycolytic enzymes and detach them from the cytoskeleton. However, the broad effects of the drug, e.g., acting on different enzymes and pathways, indicate that CTZ might also affect several signaling pathways. In this study, we show that CTZ interferes with the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 after a short incubation period (4h), thereby diminishing cell viability, promoting apoptosis, depolarizing mitochondria, inhibiting key glycolytic regulatory enzymes, decreasing the intracellular ATP content, and permeating plasma membranes. CTZ treatment also interferes with autophagy. Moreover, when the incubation is performed under hypoxic conditions, certain effects of CTZ are enhanced, such as phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate kinase (PI3K), which is inhibited upon CTZ treatment; this inhibition is potentiated under hypoxia. CTZ-induced PI3K inhibition is not caused by upstream effects of CTZ because the drug does not affect the interaction of the PI3K regulatory subunit and the insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1. Additionally, CTZ directly inhibits human purified PI3K in a dose-dependent and reversible manner. Pharmacologic and in silico results suggest that CTZ may bind to the PI3K catalytic site. Therefore, we conclude that PI3K is a novel, putative target for the antitumoral effects of CTZ, interfering with autophagy, apoptosis, cell division and viability.

Abstract: In this study, a method to opto-electronically probe the individual junctions and carrier transport across interfaces in fully printed and coated tandem polymer solar cells is described, enabling the identification of efficiency limiting printing/coating defects. The methods used are light beam induced current (LBIC) mapping, External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements, and monochromatic current–voltage (I–V) characterization. Using these methods, inherent limitations to the accuracy of EQE and LBIC measurements on non-ideal tandem solar cells are identified and described through the use of a small-signal electrical model. The model is able to predict the EQE spectrum of the non-ideal polymer tandem solar cell, using extracted values of shunt- and series resistance of the individual junction of the tandem cell. This finally enables LBIC mapping of the individual junctions of the tandem polymer solar cells, using a combination of light and voltage-biasing.

Abstract: To enhance OPV performance, a novel module-fabrication process was developed. Chlorobenzene and acetone were employed to wash away unnecessary residual high-resistance materials after full modules were fabricated. Monolithic interconnecting electrode lines between the anode and the cathode were formed using a dispenser after wash process. The wash process allowed for minimization of interconnection resistance and enhancement of power conversion efficiency. Module efficiency changes were also studied by varying the coating conditions of PEIE. The power conversion efficiency increased as a result of the wash-off process compared with modules fabricated via conventional processes. The power conversion efficiency enhancement was attributed to increases in open circuit voltage and fill factor. Applying this wash-off process to larger-area OPV modules is expected to be effective for further enhancing power conversion efficiency.

Abstract: Sub-grain boundaries related to dislocation clusters are seriously detrimental to the quality of mono-like cast silicon, which reduce the efficiency of the solar cells. Here, we have developed a novel technique to grow the mono-like cast silicon by forming special grain boundaries. The special grain boundaries are induced by controlling the placing method of seeds at the bottom of crucible. It is found that the sub-grain boundaries in the new ingots are completely suppressed, which are clarified by the measurements of photoluminescence and electroluminescence. Therefore, compared to the conventional mono-like ingot, the minority carrier lifetime of the new ingots is significantly increased, and the internal quantum efficiency of corresponding solar cells gets obviously improved. As a result, the power conversion efficiency of the solar cells is averagely 18.1%, which is much higher than that of conventional ones by a value of 0.6% absolutely. These results are of significance for the quality improvement of mono-like silicon and their application in photovoltaics.

Abstract: Cyclin-dependent kinases are either post-transcriptionally regulated by interacting with cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors or are transcriptionally regulated by transcription factors, but the latter mechanism has not been extensively investigated. Dysregulated transcription factors resulting from aberrantly expressed microRNAs play critical roles in tumor development and progression. Our previous work identified miR-365 as an oncogenic microRNA that promotes the development of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma via repression of cyclin-dependent kinase 6, while miR-365 also targets nuclear factor I/B. However, the underlying mechanism(s) of the interaction between nuclear factor I/B and cyclin-dependent kinase 6 are unclear. In this work, we demonstrate that miR-365-regulated nuclear factor I/B transcriptionally inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases 6 and 4 by binding to their promoter regions. In vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrate that the loss of nuclear factor I/B after miR-365 expression or treatment with small interfering RNAs results in the upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinases 6 and 4. This upregulation, in turn, enhances the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein and tumor progression. Characterizing this transcriptional repression of cyclin-dependent kinases 6 and 4 by nuclear factor I/B contributes to the understanding of the transcriptional regulation of cyclin-dependent kinases by transcription factors and also facilitates the development of new therapeutic regimens to improve the clinical treatment of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.

Abstract: An adverse in-utero environment is increasingly recognized to predispose to chronic disease in adulthood. Maternal smoking remains the most common modifiable adverse in-utero exposure leading to low birth weight, which is strongly associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in later life. In order to investigate underlying mechanisms for such susceptibility, female Balb/c mice were sham or cigarette smoke-exposed (SE) for 6 weeks before mating, throughout gestation and lactation. Offspring kidneys were examined for oxidative stress, expression of mitochondrial proteins, mitochondrial structure as well as renal functional parameters on postnatal day 1, day 20 (weaning) and week 13 (adult age). From birth throughout adulthood, SE offspring had increased renal levels of mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS), which left a footprint on DNA with increased 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosin (8-OHdG) in kidney tubular cells. Mitochondrial structural abnormalities were seen in SE kidneys at day 1 and week 13 along with a reduction in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) proteins and activity of mitochondrial antioxidant Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). Smoke exposure also resulted in increased mitochondrial DNA copy number (day 1–week 13) and lysosome density (day 1 and week 13). The appearance of mitochondrial defects preceded the onset of albuminuria at week 13. Thus, mitochondrial damage caused by maternal smoking may play an important role in development of CKD at adult life.

Abstract: Excitatory amino acid transporter 2, also known as glial glutamate transporter type 1 (GLT-1), plays an important role in maintaining suitable synaptic glutamate concentrations. Reentrant helical hairpin loop (HP) 2, as the extracellular gate, has been shown to participate in the binding of substrate and ions. Several residues in transmembrane domain (TM) 5 have been shown to be involved in the construction of the transport pathway. However, the spatial relationship between HP2 and TM5 during the recycling of glutamate has not yet been clarified. We introduced cysteine residue pairs in HP2 and TM5 of cysteine-less-GLT-1 by using site-directed mutagenesis in order to assess the proximity of HP2 and TM5. A significant decrease in substrate uptake was seen in the I283C/S443C and S287C/S443C mutants when the oxidative cross-linking agent copper(II) (1,10-phenanthroline)3 (CuPh) was used. The inhibitory effect of CuPh on the transport activity of the S287/S443C mutant was increased after the application of glutamate or potassium. In contrast, an apparent protection of the transport activity of the I283C/S443C mutant was observed after glutamate or potassium addition. The membrane-impermeable sulfhydryl reagent (2-trimethylammonium) methanethiosulfonate (MTSET) was used to detect the aqueous permeability of each single mutant. The aqueous permeability of the I283C mutant was identical to that of the S443C mutant. The sensitivity of I283C and S443C to MTSET was attenuated by glutamate and potassium. All these data indicate that there is a complex relative motion between TM5 and HP2 during the transport cycle.

The champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ternary PSCs arrives to 6.49% with a short circuit current density (JSC) of 11.56mA/cm2 and a fill factor (FF) of 66% when the DIB-SQ doping ratio in donors is 9wt%. The champion PCE values of binary PSCs with PIDTDTQx:PC71BM or DIB-SQ:PC71BM as the active layers are 5.47% or 1.78%, respectively. An apparent PCE improvement of 18.6% was obtained from the optimized ternary PSCs compared with binary PSCs with PIDTDTQx:PC71BM as the active layers. The underlying reason of PCE improvement was investigated from the absorption spectral complementary, photoluminescence emission quenching, intermolecular charge transfer, and the balance of charge carrier transport in ternary active layers.

Abstract: Although expression quantitative trait locus, eQTL, serves as an explicit indicator of gene–gene associations, challenges remain to disentangle the mechanisms by which genetic variations alter gene expression. Here we combined eQTL and molecular analyses to identify an association between two seemingly non-associated genes in brain expression data from BXD inbred mice, namely Ptpn21 and Nrg3. Using biotinylated receptor tracking and immunoprecipitation analyses, we determined that PTPN21 de-phosphorylates the upstream receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB4 leading to the up-regulation of its downstream signaling. Conversely, kinase-dead ErbB4 (K751R) or phosphatase-dead PTPN21 (C1108S) mutants impede PTPN21-dependent signaling. Furthermore, PTPN21 also induced Elk-1 activation in embryonic cortical neurons and a novel Elk-1 binding motif was identified in a region located 1919bp upstream of the NRG3 initiation codon. This enables PTPN21 to promote NRG3 expression through Elk-1, which provides a biochemical mechanism for the PTPN21–NRG3 association identified by eQTL. Biologically, PTPN21 positively influences cortical neuronal survival and, similar to Elk-1, it also enhances neuritic length. Our combined approaches show for the first time, a link between NRG3 and PTPN21 within a signaling cascade. This may explain why these two seemingly unrelated genes have previously been identified as risk genes for schizophrenia.

Abstract: Rab proteins, small GTPases, are key regulators of mammalian Golgi apparatus organization. Based on the effect of Rab activation state, Rab proteins fall into two functional classes. In Class1, inactivation induces Golgi ribbon fragmentation and/or redistribution of Golgi enzymes to the Endoplasmic Reticulum, while overexpression of wild type or activation has little, if any, effect on Golgi ribbon organization. In Class 2, the reverse is true. We give emphasis to Rab6, the most abundant Golgi-associated Rab protein. Rab6 depletion in HeLa cells causes an increase in Golgi cisternal number, longer, more continuous cisternae, and a pronounced accumulation of vesicles; the effect of Rab6 on Golgi ribbon organization is probably through regulation of vesicle transport. In effector studies, motor proteins and their regulators are found to be key Rab6 effectors. A related Rab, Rab41, affects Golgi ribbon organization in a contrasting manner. The balance between minus- and plus-end directed motor recruitment may well be the major Rab-dependent factor in Golgi ribbon organization.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to seek possible links between the regionality along the digestive tract and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, the effectiveness of the antioxidant defense system and the sensitivity to the types of demise in different gut regions of rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Significant changes were observed in the oxidative status and in the activity of the antioxidant defense system in the diabetic colon; the peroxynitrite production was doubled, the level of hemoxygenase-2 protein was increased 11-fold and the expression of anti-apoptotic bcl-2 was also increased. The segment-specific vulnerability of the gastrointestinal tract induced by hyperglycemia was also confirmed by electron microscopy, demonstrating the presence of severe necrosis in the colon of the diabetic rats. No remarkable histopathological alterations were seen in the duodenum of the diabetic animals and there were likewise no significant changes in the production of peroxynitrite in their duodenum, whereas the level of the free radical scavenger metallothionein-2 was increased ∼300-fold.
Conclusion
The spatially restricted vulnerability observed along the digestive tract could originate from a high level of oxidative stress via peroxynitrite production.

Abstract: Oxidative stress, caused by excess reactive oxygen species (ROS), has been hypothesized to cause or exacerbate skeletal muscle wasting in a number of diseases and chronic conditions. ROS, such as hydrogen peroxide, have the potential to affect signal transduction pathways such as the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3 K)/Akt pathway that regulates protein synthesis. Previous studies have found contradictory outcomes for the effect of ROS on the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, where oxidative stress can either enhance or inhibit Akt phosphorylation. The apparent contradictions could reflect differences in experimental cell types or types of ROS treatments. We replicate both effects in myotubes of cultured skeletal muscle C2C12 cells, and show that increased oxidative stress can either inhibit or enhance Akt phosphorylation. This differential response could be explained: thiol oxidation of Akt, but not the phosphatases PTEN or PP2A, caused a decline in Akt phosphorylation; whereas the thiol oxidation of Akt, PTEN and PP2A increased Akt phosphorylation. These observations indicate that a more complete understanding of the effects of oxidative stress on a signal transduction pathway comes not only from identifying the proteins susceptible to thiol oxidation, but also their relative sensitivity to ROS.

Abstract: Organic photovoltaic (OPV) active layers made by spin-coating a solution comprising poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) nanoparticles have been shown to adopt a non-uniform concentration profile across the thin film dimension. This inhomogeneous distribution can reduce the efficiency of the device. In the present work a new process, gas expanded polymer (GXP) annealing, is applied to P3HT/PCBM thin film blends, enabling the distribution of the PCBM nanoparticles to be manipulated by varying the GXP processing conditions. Films of 50nm thickness (nominally) created by spin casting a blend of P3HT mixed with PCBM were annealed by oscillatory GXP and GXP at constant pressure using high pressure CO2. An increase in P3HT crystallinity (detected by X-ray diffraction and UV–vis spectroscopy) along with a more uniform distribution of PCBM nanoparticles in the thickness dimension, as interpreted from neutron reflectivity measurements, were observed after oscillatory GXP annealing. In addition, static water contact angles suggest that the film/air interface is enriched in PCBM relative to the as-cast film. These results demonstrate that GXP annealing, which is commercially scalable, can be successfully used to create a uniform distribution of PCBM nanoparticles across the thickness dimension in a P3HT thin film.

Abstract: We present a new dandelion-like TiO2 spheres by a modified hydrothermal method for manufacture of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). This construct is composed of numerous nanowires for employment as the scattering layer of DSSCs. Such morphology is produced by nucleation-growth-assembly mechanism. The size of the dandelion-like spheres and their morphology can be tailored by controlling the processing parameters of the modified hydrothermal process. TiO2 nanoparticles with narrow size distribution are also synthesized by hydrothermal route for the active layer of DSSCs. The nanoparticles show pure anatase phase with average size of 40nm, whereas the dandelion-like TiO2 spheres are pure rutile structure with average diameter in the range 5–9μm. A systematic study is performed in order to improve the photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs with different arrangement modes. First, the monolayer DSSCs with various thicknesses are prepared using pure nanoparticles. The highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.4% is obtained for the monolayer cell with thickness of 31μm. Second, the double layer DSSCs containing an under-layer and an over-layer are reported. The double layer DSSC made of nanoparticles as the under-layer (with thickness around 31μm) and mixtures of nanoparticles and dandelion-like spheres as the over-layer (as light scattering layer with thickness around 8μm) shows the highest PCE of 8.3%. The improvement of cell efficiency is explained by triple function mechanism including significant increase in light scattering, dye sensitization and photo-generated charge carriers.

Abstract: For the contacting of boron-doped emitters with screen-printed metallization in n-type silicon solar cells, usually a small amount of aluminum is added to the silver pastes. To date, low specific contact resistances ρC in the range of a few mΩcm2 have only been achieved with these so-called silver–aluminum (Ag–Al) pastes. Within this work, ρC is experimentally determined for two Ag–Al pastes for three different boron-doped emitters on alkaline textured and passivated silicon surfaces. The investigated boron doping profiles feature almost identical rising curve progressions up to a depth of ≈60nm (which corresponds to the depletion zone), with a maximum dopant concentration Nmax≈8·1019cm−3. However, they have different junction depths between 570nm and 980nm. This work shows that the dopant concentrations with values well below Nmax following the depletion zone significantly affect the measured ρC: the deeper the junction, the lower ρC. This behavior is observed for both investigated Ag–Al pastes. For example, the mean ρC for paste Ag–Al1 decreases from ρC≈4mΩcm2, determined on a 570nm deep doping profile, to ρC≈2mΩcm2, determined on a 980nm deep one. By using an analytical model to calculate ρC with dependence on e.g. dopant concentration, metal crystallite coverage fraction, and crystallite penetration depth, the lower ρC for deeper profiles can be explained by crystallites with penetration depths of several 100nm. The calculations also reveal that the impact of the depletion zone is negligible with respect to ρC for crystallites deeper than ≈100nm.

Abstract: Ternary CuxSnySz thin films with different Cu/Sn atomic ratios and thicknesses have been electrochemically deposited on the (111) face of a silver single crystal. The surface morphology and chemical composition of these chalcogenides, which have attracted considerable worldwide interest as low cost high conversion efficiency photovoltaic devices, have been characterized by means of SEM, parallel angle resolved (PAR-XPS) and TOF-SIMS depth profiling in order to gain insight into the morphology and element distribution within the layer and their effect on the band gap. This study constitutes the first in-depth chemical study on CuxSnySz thin films, providing evidence of notable discrepancies between the expected and real composition, especially regarding the Cu/Sn ratio. The samples were found to be chemically homogeneous through the whole deposit even though strongly tin depleted regardless their thickness or deposition sequence. Finally, the literature band gap data were discussed on the basis of these findings.

Regulation of mice liver regeneration by early growth response-1 through the GGPPS/RAS/MAPK pathway,

Abstract: Background & Aims
Liver regeneration (LR) consists of a series of complicated processes in which several transcription factors play important roles. Among them, the early growth response 1 gene (EGR-1) is rapidly induced in response to liver resection. Previous studies have shown that EGR-1−/− mice exhibit delayed hepatocellular mitotic progression after partial hepatectomy (PH). The mechanism underlying the EGR-1 regulated LR is still unknown. Our aim is to elucidate the underlying mechanism.
Methods
Mice infected with adenoviral vectors expressing GFP, EGR-1 or dominant negative EGR-1 (dnEGR-1) were subjected to 2/3 PH. The serum starvation recovery cell model was chosen to mimic the regeneration process for the in vitro studies. Cell proliferation and signaling pathways downstream of geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPPS) were examined in the regenerating liver and serum starvation recovery cell model.
Results
Loss of function of EGR-1 significantly inhibited liver recovery and the expression of cyclin D1, cyclin E, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). The expression of GGPPS and the activity of the downstream RAS/MAPK pathway were inhibited in dnEGR-1-infected liver, which was consistent with the serum-induced cell model. In addition, loss of function of EGR-1 aggravated liver damage with increased serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels.
Conclusions
EGR-1-induced GGPPS plays a vital role in the LR after PH through the RAS/MAPK signaling.

Abstract: Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is a heterodimer transcription factor complex that monitors the cellular response to the oxygen levels in cells. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) has been shown to be stabilized by ionizing radiation (IR) and its stabilization promotes tumor progression and metastasis. Nijmegen breakage syndrome protein 1 (NBS1), a component of the MRE11–RAD50–NBS1 complex, plays an important role in the cellular response to DNA damage but its overexpression contributes to transformation and has been found to correlate with metastasis. However, whether NBS1 participates in IR-induced metastasis needs to be further determined. The aim of this study is to investigate whether radiation-induced HIF-1α stabilization is regulated by NBS1 and thereby promotes tumor cell migration/invasion. Here, we show that both NBS1 and HIF-1α expression are up-regulated after exposure to IR, and NBS1 increases HIF-1α expression at the protein level. In addition, IR treatment promotes the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and in vitro cell migration and invasion activity, which could be abolished by suppression of NBS1. Furthermore, NBS1 directly interacts with HIF-1α and reduces the ubiquitination of HIF-1α⋅ Co-expression of HIF-1α and NBS1 in primary tumors of patients with lung adenocarcinoma correlates with a worse prognosis. These results provide a new function of NBS1 in stabilizing HIF-1α under IR, which leads to enhanced cancer cell migration and invasion.

Abstract: Heat shock proteins, many of which function as molecular chaperones, play important roles in the lifecycle and pathogenesis of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. The P. falciparum heat shock protein 70 (PfHsp70) family of chaperones is potentially regulated by a large complement of J proteins that localize to various intracellular compartments including the infected erythrocyte cytosol. While PfHsp70-1 has been shown to be an abundant cytosolic chaperone, its regulation by J proteins is poorly understood. In this study, we characterized the J protein PFB0595w, a homologue of the well-studied yeast cytosolic J protein, Sis1. PFB0595w, similarly to PfHsp70-1, was localized to the parasite cytosol and its expression was upregulated by heat shock. Additionally, recombinant PFB0595w was shown to be dimeric and to stimulate the in vitro ATPase activity of PfHsp70-1. Overall, the expression, localization and biochemical data for PFB0595w suggest that it may function as a cochaperone of PfHsp70-1, and advances current knowledge on the chaperone machinery of the parasite.

Abstract: The anti-transplant rejection drug cyclosporin A (CsA) causes loss of collagen homeostasis in rapidly remodeling connective tissues, such as human gingiva. As a result of CsA treatment, collagen degradation by fibroblasts is inhibited, which leads to a net increase of tissue collagen and gingival overgrowth. Since fibrillar collagen is the primary ligand for the discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1), we hypothesized that CsA perturbs DDR1-associated functions that affect collagen homeostasis. For these experiments, human fibroblasts obtained from gingival explants or mouse 3T3 fibroblasts (wild type, over-expressing DDR1 or DDR1 knockdown) or mouse GD25 cells (expressing DDR1 but null for β1 integrin), were treated with vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide) or with CsA. The effect of CsA on cell binding to collagen was examined by flow cytometry; cell-mediated collagen remodeling was analyzed with contraction, compaction and migration assays. We found that CsA inhibited cell binding to collagen, internalization of collagen, contraction of collagen gels and cell migration over collagen in a DDR1-dependent manner. CsA also enhanced collagen compaction around cell extensions. Treatment with CsA strongly reduced surface levels of β1 integrins in wild type and DDR1 over-expressing 3T3 cells but did not affect β1 integrin activation or focal adhesion formation. We conclude that CsA inhibition of collagen remodeling is mediated through its effects on both DDR1 and cell surface levels of the β1 integrin.

Abstract: CIGS solar cells were exposed to liquid water purged with the atmospheric gases carbon dioxide (CO2), oxygen (O2), nitrogen (N2) and air in order to investigate their chemical degradation behavior. The samples were analyzed by electrical, compositional and optical measurements before, during and after exposure in order to follow the degradation behavior of these solar cells in time. The solar cells showed a rapid decrease in conversion efficiency when exposed to water purged with a combination of CO2 and N2 as well as to water purged with air, while their efficiency was slowly reduced in unpurged water and water purged with N2 or O2. Cross-section SEM showed that the exposure of samples to H2O with large concentrations of CO2 led to the dissolution of the ZnO:Al layer, likely starting from the grain boundaries. This resulted in an increased series resistance, which is likely related to an increase in resistivity of the ZnO:Al layer. It also led to a very rapid decrease of the short-circuit current of these samples. Therefore, the conversion efficiency was rapidly lost.

Abstract: We report a single heterojunction solar cell model based on crystalline p-silicon and n-zinc oxide. The ZnO can act as front n-layer as well as antireflection coating saving processing cost and complexity. Experiments are performed to find optimized growth window using MOCVD to achieve maximum transmission in ZnO as front layer of the solar cell. Gallium-rich ZnO:Ga films are also grown to improve optical properties of the front layer. Optical characterizations of pristine ZnO and gallium-rich ZnO:Ga are presented. The modified PC1D software is used to find the optimized parameters for the solar cell. Absorption spectrum of ~0.5µm thick ZnO film grown in our lab was used in the simulations to get realistic results. Simulations anticipated conversion efficiency of 19% and fill factor of 81%.

Abstract: Phase change materials (PCMs) are the effective substances for thermal energy storage. Unfortunately, various problems such as high supercooling degree, low crystal growth rate and poor thermal conductivity greatly hinder the large-scale utilization of PCMs. The present study focuses on improving the crystallization and decreasing supercooling degree by adding various proportions of NaCl/NaCl solutions into the n-octadecane-based PCMs for thermal energy storage. The experimental results show that 20wt% NaCl solutions have the greatest effect on the thermal performance of PCMs. The supercooling degree has been minimized up to 6°C with the addition of NaCl. It can not only promote crystallization under 1wt% addition rate, but also enhance latent heat storage performance. Such observations have been verified by the kinetics of crystallization. The researches on supercooling could advance the application of PCMs on solar energy.

Abstract: Due to their high efficiencies combined with simple and cost-effective device fabrication, perovskite solar cells are promising candidates as top cells in tandem devices. For this application, the perovskite solar cell must be highly transparent at near-infrared wavelengths such that sufficient light is transmitted to the narrow-bandgap bottom cell. We demonstrate perovskite solar cells featuring a sputtered amorphous indium zinc oxide (IZO) layer as broadband transparent rear electrode. This electrode absorbs less than 3% in the 400–1200nm wavelength range, while having a sheet resistance of 35Ω/sq. We show over 9% efficient semitransparent perovskite solar cells with IZO sputtered directly on the sensitive organic charge transport layer. The efficiency can be raised up to 10.3% by inserting a thin molybdenum oxide buffer layer, mitigating sputter damage to the underlying organic layer. These cells show more than 60% average transmittance in the 800–1200nm wavelength range, which makes them suitable top-cell candidates for tandem devices. Finally, we discuss the performance potential of this highly transparent rear electrode for four-terminal tandem devices.

Abstract: We report the application of thin film nanocrystalline (NC) FeS2 as the copper-free back contact for CdTe solar cells. The FeS2-NC layer is prepared from solution directly on the CdTe surface using drop-casting coupled with a hydrazine treatment at ambient temperature and pressure, and requires no thermal treatment. Copper-free solar cells based on the CdS/CdTe/FeS2-NC/Au architecture exhibit device efficiencies >90% that of a standard Cu/Au back contact devices. The FeS2-NC back contact solar cells show good thermal stability under initial tests. Devices prepared with untreated FeS2-NC back contacts display a strong “S-kink” behavior which we correlate with a high hole-transport barrier arising from inter-NC organic surfactant molecules.

Abstract: High efficiency commercial silicon solar cell technologies are often fabricated on n-type wafers to avoid light-induced degradation and other recombination centres that are observed in boron-doped Czochralski silicon. The advanced cell structures often feature the p–n junction on the rear of the device and require high bulk lifetimes in order to achieve high efficiencies. However n-type Czochralski silicon is still subject to a range of impurity related defects which can substantially reduce the lifetime of such material. In this work, large improvements in bulk lifetimes were demonstrated on standard commercial grade n-type Czochralski silicon from values in the range of 90–190μs to values of 3.4–4.9ms through the use of a short, low temperature hydrogen passivation process only using atomic hydrogen released from layers of silicon oxynitride grown by plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition. The large improvements suggest that wafers with inherent low lifetimes, often deemed unsuitable to achieve high efficiencies, could in fact be compatible with the use of advanced cell architectures, to realise cell efficiencies over 24%. Oxygen precipitates are one type of impurity related defect which can cause substantial lifetime and efficiency limitations in both n- and p-type Czochralski silicon solar cells. An advanced hydrogenation process incorporating minority carrier injection was observed to lead to the complete electrical deactivation of the recombination activity of the defects. Furthermore, the passivation was retained throughout the remainder of the fabrication sequence and hence, no recombination activity from oxygen precipitates was evident on finished devices.

Abstract: A high-temperature gas-templating strategy is proposed to synthesize Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) nanocrystals for all-aqueous solar inks. Our gas templating process route involves the in-situ generation and stabilization of nanosized gas bubbles into a molten KSCN-based reaction mixture at 400°C. Chemical insights of the templating gas process are provided such as the simultaneous formation of gas bubbles and CZTS nuclei highlighting the crucial role of the nucleation stage on the sponge and resulting nanocrystals properties. The high porosity displayed by the resulting CZTS nanocrystals facilitates their further post-fragmentation, yielding individualized nanocrystals. The advantages of our high temperature gas templating route are illustrated by the following: (i) the low defect concentration displayed by the highly crystalline nanocrystals, (ii) the synthesis of CZTS nanocrystals displaying S2− polar surfaces after ligand exchange. The good photoluminescence properties recorded on the pure CZTS nanocrystals reveal potential for exploration of new complex chalcogenide nanocrystals useful for various applications including photovoltaics and water splitting. Here we demonstrate that using these building blocks, a CZTS solar cell can be successfully fabricated from an environment-friendly all-aqueous ink.

Abstract: The use of thin-film copper indium gallium (di)selenide (CIGS) and cadmium-telluride (CdTe) in solar technologies has grown rapidly in recent years, leading to an increased demand for gallium, indium, and tellurium. In the coming years, recycling these elements from end-of-life photovoltaic (PV) modules may be an important part of their overall supply, but little is known about the economic feasibility and the potential quantities available. This article investigates the future role of PV recycling in supplying gallium, indium, and tellurium. The authors evaluate both the quantities available from recycling over the next century and the associated costs for recycling modules and reusing each element in PV manufacturing. The findings indicate that, in terms of technical potential, there may be significant quantities of each element available from recycling CIGS and CdTe modules. The estimated cost of recovering each element from end-of-life PV modules and reusing it in PV manufacturing is higher than current raw mineral costs; however, learning and economies of scale may reduce the reported early estimates of recycling costs. These findings help improve the understanding of recycling's role in enabling higher levels of CIGS and CdTe module production.

Abstract: Absorbing surfaces with spectrally selective coatings having both high solar absorptance (αS) and low thermal emittance (εT) are used in solar collectors. Selective absorbing surfaces can be made of specific materials or combinations of them with various methods. The common methods of fabrication are executed on the basis of the surface coating, whereas the solar absorptance depends on the black coated layer and the thermal emittance on the undercoating layer. In this study, absorbing surfaces from various materials were coated using electrodeposition, chemical conversion (such as the chromate conversion), anodizing and painting techniques in accordance to specified formulas and the existing operating conditions. Materials such as stainless steel 316, copper and aluminum have been deployed as substrates of the samples. The samples of the selective absorbing surface were considered as absorber–reflector tandems. According to the experimental results from the performed optical characterization of the fabricated samples, it can be deduced that most of them had high solar absorptance αS more than 0.80 (up to 0.940) and low thermal emittance εT (100°C) less than 0.12 (as low as 0.085). In addition, most samples had high photothermal conversion efficiency (η) and selectivity factor (αS/εT). Also, the morphology of surfaces and particular elements identification of the coatings were studied and evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) detector. Moreover, the cross-section image was used to determine the approximate thickness of the films formed in some of the prepared samples.

Abstract: We report here on the development of a rear-side point-contact scheme for liquid-phase-crystallized silicon on glass solar cells, which uses laser for all structuring and contact-post-treatment steps. Our contact scheme is based on the procedure developed by CSG Solar and contains two main innovations. First, we demonstrate here that it is possible to form contact holes in the back-reflector resist layer by laser ablation instead of printing droplets of an etch solution with inkjet. The use of laser for forming holes in the resist holds promise for enhancing the precision and reliability of this process. Second, we show that for both p and n-type absorbers, laser firing at the absorber-point-contacts can be used to increase the doping concentration beneath the metal contact and thereby achieve low-resistance contacts. Using the All-by-Laser Point-contact Scheme (ALPS) we were able to reach a solar cell conversion efficiency of 11.5% for a planar n-type laser-crystallized silicon absorber with an amorphous/crystalline heterojunction structure.

Abstract: Mitochondrial NADPH-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase, IDH2, and cytosolic IDH1, catalyze reductive carboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate. Both idh2 and idh1 monoallelic mutations are harbored in grade 2/3 gliomas, secondary glioblastomas and acute myeloid leukemia. Mutant IDH1/IDH2 enzymes were reported to form an oncometabolite r-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), further strengthening malignancy. We quantified CO2-dependent reductive carboxylation glutaminolysis (RCG) and CO2-independent 2HG production in HTB-126 and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells by measuring 13C incorporation from 1-13C-glutamine into citrate, malate, and 2HG. For HTB-126 cells, 13C-citrate, 13C-malate, and 13C-2-hydroxyglutarate were enriched by 2-, 5-, and 15-fold at 5mM glucose (2-, 2.5-, and 13-fold at 25mM glucose), respectively, after 6h. Such enrichment decreased by 6% with IDH1 silencing, but by 30–50% upon IDH2 silencing while cell respiration and ATP levels rose up to 150%. Unlike 2HG production RCG declined at decreasing CO2. At hypoxia (5% O2), IDH2-related and unrelated 13C-accumulation into citrate and malate increased 1.5–2.5-fold with unchanged IDH2 expression; whereas hypoxic 2HG formation did not. 13C–2HG originated by ∼50% from other than IDH2 or IDH1 reactions, substantiating remaining activity in IDH1&2-silenced cells. Relatively high basal 12C–2HG levels existed (5-fold higher vs. non-tumor HTB-125 cells) and 13C–2HG was formed despite the absence of any idh2 and idh1 mutations in HTB-126 cells. Since RCG is enhanced at hypoxia (frequent in solid tumors) and 2HG can be formed without idh1/2 mutations, we suggest 2HG as an analytic marker (in serum, urine, or biopsies) predicting malignancy of breast cancer in all patients.

Abstract: Endosomes undergo extensive spatiotemporal rearrangements as proteins and lipids flux through them in a series of fusion and fission events. These controlled changes enable the concentration of cargo for eventual degradation while ensuring the proper recycling of other components. A growing body of studies has now defined multiple recycling pathways from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) which differ in their molecular machineries. The recycling process requires specific sets of lipids, coats, adaptors, and accessory proteins that coordinate cargo selection with membrane deformation and its association with the cytoskeleton. Specific tethering factors and SNARE (SNAP (Soluble NSF Attachment Protein) Receptor) complexes are then required for the docking and fusion with the acceptor membrane. Herein, we summarize some of the current knowledge of the machineries that govern the retrograde transport from endosomes to the TGN.

Abstract: Highly efficient SnO2−x/g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts were synthesized using simple calcination of g-C3N4 and Sn6O4(OH)4. The synthesized composite exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance for rhodamine B (RhB) degradation under visible light irradiation. The optimal RhB degradation rate of the composite was 0.088min−1, which was 8.8 times higher than that of g-C3N4. The SnO2−x/g-C3N4 composite also showed high photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction and photodegradation of other organic compounds. Various techniques including Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method (BET), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) and an electrochemical method were applied to determine the origin of the enhanced photoactivity of SnO2−x/g-C3N4. Results indicated that the introduction of SnO2−x on g-C3N4 increased its surface area and enhanced light absorption performance. More importantly, a hetero-junction structure was formed between SnO2−x and g-C3N4, which efficiently promoted the separation of electron–hole pairs by a direct Z-scheme mechanism to enhance the photocatalytic activity. This study might represent an important step for the conversion of solar energy using cost-efficient materials.

Abstract: The potential of titanium (Ti) incorporation into cupric oxide (CuO) is demonstrated. The optical, electrical, microstructural, material quality, chemical composition, surface morphology, and photovoltaic properties of Ti doped CuO, CuO(Ti) have been systematically investigated. It is shown that Ti doped CuO reduces sheet resistance and improved the charge transport properties. Furthermore, by tuning the Ti concentration, the conductivity of CuO(Ti) can be improved, while retaining the optical properties and crystallinity of the samples. Heterojunction solar cells of p-type Ti doped CuO on n-type silicon (Si) substrate, p-CuO(Ti)/n-Si, prepared by using conventional sputter deposition at room temperature followed by rapid thermal annealing at 300°C to investigate the impact of Ti doped CuO on the performance of photovoltaic properties. The short circuit current and efficiency of p-CuO(Ti)/n-Si heterojunction have been significantly improved compared to the cells without Ti doped CuO.

Abstract: One of the most common strategies in high-efficiency crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells for the rear surface is the combination of a dielectric passivation with a point-like contact to the base. In such devices, the trade-off between surface passivation and ohmic losses determines the optimum distance between contacts or pitch. Given a certain pitch, the series resistance related to majority carrier flow through the base and the rear point-like contact (Rbase) is commonly calculated a-priori and not crosschecked in finished devices, since typical techniques to measure series resistance lead to an unique value that includes all ohmic losses. In this work, we present a novel method to measure Rbase using impedance spectroscopy (IS) analysis. The IS data at high frequencies allow to determine Rbase due to the presence of the capacitor formed by the metal/dielectric/semiconductor structure that covers most of the rear surface. The method is validated by device simulations where the dependence of Rbase on carrier injection, base resistivity and pitch are reproduced. Finally, Rbase is measured on finished devices. As a result, a more accurate value of the contacted area is deduced which is a valuable information for further device optimization.

Abstract: We report the study on the influences of shell thickness and core–shell structure on the optical properties of ZnO/CdS core/shell nanorods (NRs) for an elucidation of the mechanisms responsible for the extended photoresponse of ZnO/CdS core/shell NRs to solar radiation. Well aligned ZnO/CdS core/shell NRs were fabricated on indium tin oxide substrates using hydrothermally grown ZnO NRs as the cores and pulsed laser deposited CdS coatings as the shells. The sample structure was characterized by X-ray diffraction and Raman backscattering spectroscopy, revealing the wurtzite structure of both the ZnO cores and CdS shells, and the improvement in the structure after annealing. The optical properties were studied through optical transmittance, absorbance and photoluminescence measurements, showing the optical properties featured with type-II heterogeneous nanostructures constructed from ZnO and CdS. The results provide a support that the optical properties of the CdS covered ZnO NRs are attributed to the suppressed radiative recombination of photogenerated carriers due to the efficient spatial separation of electrons and holes in the nanosized ZnO–CdS heterostructures.

Abstract: Sprouty proteins control length and intensity of the intracellular signal transduction cascade activated by mitogens in the cellular environment. As part of a negative feedback loop, their expression is supposed to be elevated by the same factors. In this report, Sprouty4 expression in response to serum and the underlying regulatory mechanisms were investigated. We verified that Sprouty4 expression is activated by serum addition in all tested cells independent of their origin. Strict correlation between Sprouty4 protein levels and promoter activity indicates mainly transcriptional regulation of Sprouty4 serum-responsiveness. Induction of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is required for Sprouty4 promoter activation in the presence of serum. Nonetheless, signal transduction via this pathway is not sufficient to fully induce the Sprouty4 promoter. Instead, deletion and mutation analysis identified two annotated Specific protein 1 binding sites as the critical cis-elements responsible for conferring the serum induction of the promoter. Corroborating, repressed Specific protein 1 activity or levels result in constitutive lowered transcriptional activity of the Sprouty4 promoter. These data demonstrate that Specific protein 1 plays a crucial role in the regulation of Sprouty4 in response to serum.

Abstract: Background
Response to hydroxyurea therapy in homozygous or compound heterozygous beta thalassaemia (BT) has been reported as more favourable in the presence of XmnI polymorphism. The prevalence of XmnI polymorphism may vary with BT phenotypes and genotypes, and differs geographically in distribution. Prevalence of XmnI polymorphism is not known in northern Pakistan.
Objective
To determine the frequency of Gγ-globin promoter −158 (C>T) XmnI polymorphism (XmnI polymorphism) in patients with homozygous or compound heterozygous beta thalassaemia.
Materials
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for common beta thalassaemia mutations and Gγ-globin promoter −158 (C>T) XmnI polymorphism was performed on 107 blood samples of transfusion dependent beta thalassaemia (BT) patients in Pakistan. One hundred samples of unrelated BT traits and 94 samples of healthy subjects as controls were also analysed for BT mutations and XmnI polymorphism.
Results
Out of 301 DNA samples, XmnI polymorphism was detected in 71(24%); in normal controls, XmnI polymorphism was detected in 34/94 (36%) subjects; while in homozygous/compound heterozygous BT, it was detected in 14/107(13%) patients (Fisher’s exact test, p=.0002). In heterozygous BT group, XmnI polymorphism was detected in 23/100 subjects (Fisher’s exact test, p=.03 with normal controls, and p=.049 with homozygous/compound heterozygous BT). The most common BT genotype was Frame Shift (Fr) 8–9/Fr 8–9, and none of the patients with this genotype had XmnI polymorphism. The second most common genotype was IVSI-5/IVSI-5; 4/26 (15%). Cases with this genotype had XmnI polymorphism.
Conclusion
XmnI polymorphism in homozygous/compound heterozygous BT group is 13%. The most common genotype associated with XmnI polymorphism was IVSI-5/IVSI-5.

Abstract: We studied the performance over time of opaque and semi-transparent PTB7:PC71BM bulk hetero-junction solar cells. For unsealed inverted configuration cells we observe that when the isolation from the environment is improved, the degradation observed is dominated by one single exponential decay. We demonstrate that a dielectric multilayer stack of approximately 550nm provides an isolation that increases the lifetime of the cell close to ten times. In that event the fill factor appears to be the PV parameter dominating cell degradation resulting from a decrease in the shunt resistance. An Impedance analysis we performed indicates that a Warburg element, attributed to the presence of slowly moving charges such as heavy ions, must be included in the description of the experimental data. The contribution from such element increases as the cell degrades in good agreement with a degradation dominated by the corrosive effects from external agents reaching the active layer of the device.

Abstract: Mechanisms associated with the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remain unclear. We attempted to identify the pattern of altered gene expression at different time points in a high fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD mouse model. The early up-regulated genes are mainly involved in the innate immune responses, while the late up-regulated genes represent the inflammation processes. Although recent studies have shown that microRNAs play important roles in hepatic metabolic functions, the pivotal role of microRNAs in the progression of NAFLD is not fully understood. We investigated the functions of miR-451, which was identified as a target gene in the inflammatory process in NAFLD. miR-451 expression was significantly decreased in the palmitate (PA)-exposed HepG2 cells and in liver tissues of HFD-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) mice. Its decreased expressions were also observed in liver specimens of NASH patients. In vitro analysis of the effect of miR-451 on proinflammatory cytokine provided evidence for negative regulation of PA-induced interleukin (IL)-8 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) production. Furthermore, miR-451 over-expression inhibited translocation of the PA-induced NF-κB p65 subunit into the nucleus. Our result showed that Cab39 is a direct target of miRNA-451 in steatotic cells. Further study showed that AMPK activated through Cab39 inhibits NF-κB transactivation induced in steatotic HepG2 cells. miR-451 over-expression in steatotic cells significantly suppressed PA-induced inflammatory cytokine. These results provide new insights into the negative regulation of miR-451 in fatty acid-induced inflammation via the AMPK/AKT pathway and demonstrate potential therapeutic applications for miR-451 in preventing the progression from simple steatosis to severely advanced liver disease.

Abstract: A new type of SnO2:F film has been deposited by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) on textured glass substrates, and it is used for the fabrication of amorphous silicon (a-Si) thin film solar cells. These substrates are found to be highly effective in terms of their optical and electrical properties. They also facilitate the fabrication of efficient top cells for a future multi-junction solar cell. These substrates have a micron-order texture feature size, which is much larger than the a-Si absorber layer thickness. Still, they produce higher current in the 300–550nm wavelength range with a higher open circuit voltage than cells on multi-scale textured ZnO:B substrates. This work examines the applicability of this new SnO2:F coated glass substrate with different texture profiles on a-Si solar cells in the wavelength range of 300–550nm.

Abstract: Carbon dots (C-dots), a recently discovered class of fluorescent nano-sized particles with pure carbon core, have great bioanalytical potential. Neuroactive properties of fluorescent C-dots obtained from β-alanine by microwave heating were assessed based on the analysis of their effects on the key characteristics of GABA- and glutamatergic neurotransmission in isolated rat brain nerve terminals. It was found that C-dots (40–800μg/ml) in dose-dependent manner: (1) decreased exocytotic release of [3H]GABA and l-[14C]glutamate; (2) reduced acidification of synaptic vesicles; (3) attenuated the initial velocity of Na+-dependent transporter-mediated uptake of [3H]GABA and l-[14C]glutamate; (4) increased the ambient level of the neurotransmitters, nevertheless (5) did not change significantly the potential of the plasma membrane of nerve terminals. Almost complete suppression of exocytotic release of the neurotransmitters was caused by C-dots at a concentration of 800μg/ml. Fluorescent and neuromodulatory features combined in C-dots create base for their potential usage for labeling and visualization of key processes in nerve terminals, and also in theranostics. In addition, natural presence of carbon-containing nanoparticles in the human food chain and in the air may provoke the development of neurologic consequences.

Abstract: Novel alcohol/water-soluble small molecules were obtained using various p- and n-type backbones. The synthesized molecules were dissolved in organic solvents and highly polar solvents. The DPPA film exhibited strong shoulder peak at approximately 633nm compared with the solution, which was due to the ordered orientation of DPPA. According to XRD measurements, a prominent diffraction peak at 20.1° was observed in the in-plane diffraction pattern of DPPA, which indicates an out-of-plane peak (010) due to the molecular packing by π–π stacking. A photovoltaic device containing DPPA exhibited an open-circuit voltage of 0.75V, a current density of 15.1mA/cm2, a fill factor of 69.0% and a power conversion efficiency of 7.9%. The photovoltaic device containing the DPPA derivative exhibited an improved power conversion efficiency compared with those containing BPA and QA (6.6% and 7.6%, respectively) due to the ordered orientation and packing of DPPA.

Abstract: Hydrogen trititanate (H2Ti3O7) nanorods were synthesized by using a hydrothermal method. The transformation of the crystal structure from H2Ti3O7 to TiO2 occurred into either single crystalline TiO2 (B) [calcined at 400 or 450°C] or bicrystalline TiO2 (B) with anatase phases [calcined at 500 or 550°C] during a calcination process. Calcination temperature from 450 to 550°C induced both phase transformation and formation of large size nanocavities, and the changes in the nanorods morphology were confirmed using HRTEM/TEM images. Nanocomposites of Cu2O/TiO2 nanorods with different copper loading (CuxTNR) were prepared by using the wet impregnation method with TiO2 nanorods [calcined at 500°C] and copper nitrate as copper source. The structural, optical, surface elemental and morphological properties of the synthesized catalysts were extensively characterized. Solar photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) production experiment was carried out with aqueous-glycerol solution for 4h. The photocatalytic activity of TiO2 nanorods that are calcined at 500°C exhibited very high rate of H2 production, is ascribed to the improved separation of electron/hole pairs and catalytic activity at bicrystalline TiO2 surface. For the first-time, we have achieved the higher rate of H2 (50,339µmolh−1g−1cat) production under the set of the optimized conditions using Cu1.5TNR nanorods containing nanocavities as catalyst under solar irradiation. This enhancement in the activity can be attributed to the desirable absorption of UV–visible light in natural solar spectrum and minimization of the recombination of electron–hole pairs, multiple internal reflection of light within nanocavities, which improved the surface–interface reactions. The present study clearly demonstrated that Cu loaded on titania nanorods containing nanocavities were found to be more efficient and promising photocatalyst for H2 production under solar light irradiation.

Abstract: For the applications in solar thermal power, the preparation and optimization of an Al/NbMoN/NbMoON/SiO2 multilayer solar selective absorbing coating are carried out by combining experiments with optical simulation. A series of NbMoN and NbMoON single layers are deposited by magnetron reactive sputtering method with different N2/O2 gas flowing rates. And then their optical constants are obtained by fitting their reflection (R) and transmission (T) spectra in the wavelength range of 300–2500nm using SCOUT software. These optical constants are used to design the Al/NbMoN/NbMoON/SiO2 solar selective absorbing coating so as to get the ideal spectral selectivity, i.e. high α/ε ratio. According to the optical design of the coating structure, we prepared the all-layer coating, and the thickness of each layer was optimized until the best spectral selective properties are obtained. The experimental reflectance spectrum fits very well with the simulated result. The optimized solar absorbing coating deposited on stainless steel substrate exhibited high absorptance (α=0.948) and low emittance (ε=0.050) at 80°C. It offers a good method to quickly reach the ideal spectral selectivity through optical simulation. The thermal stability of the coating is evaluated, and it exhibits a good thermal stability in vacuum at 400°C.

Abstract: A comprehensive study was carried out to understand the formation of a crystalline tri-iodide perovskite absorber (TPA) on top of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). Scanning electron microscopy, two-dimensional X-ray diffraction and nanosecond time-resolved photoluminescence were used to explore the correlation between the surface morphology and the exciton lifetime in TPA fabricated with and without the in-situ toluene washing treatment. The toluene washing treatment decreases the crystallinity (exciton lifetime) of TPA and improves the TPA coverage on the non-crystalline PEDOT:PSS surface. The high average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.61% achieved can be explained as due to the efficient exciton dissociation at the interface between the TPA and the PEDOT:PSS. The experimental results show that the PCE can be further improved when the crystallinity of TPA and the TPA coverage on PEDOT:PSS are simultaneously optimized.

Abstract: Scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) compositional mapping has been used to probe the mesomorphology of nanoparticles (NPs) synthesized from two very different polymer:fullerene blends: poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT): phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and poly[4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo(1,2-b:4,5-b′)dithiophene-alt-5, 6-bis(octyloxy)-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)-5,5′-diyl] (PSBTBT): PCBM. The STXM data shows that both blends form core–shell NP structures with similar shell compositions, but with different polymer:fullerene ratios in the core regions. P3HT:PCBM and PSBTBT:PCBM NP organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices have been fabricated and exhibit similar device efficiencies, despite the PSBTBT being a much higher performing low band gap material. By comparing the measured NP shell and core compositions with the optimized bulk hetero-junction (BHJ) compositions, we show that the relatively higher performance of the P3HT:PCBM NP device arises from the fact that its shell composition is much closer to the optimal BHJ value than that of the PSBTBT:PCBM NP device.

Abstract: We report manufacture of fully printed and coated polymer solar cells on a small scale roll-to-roll coater representing the intermediate scale between laboratory and pilot scale. We highlight the enormous span in scale between the laboratory scale and the intended industrial scale by a factor of >100.000 and detail how this enormous scale must be covered by equipment that follow the scale. Especially the intermediate scale between equipment that can fit inside a fume cupboard and the typical pilot equipment with a footprint having the size of a large room presents a challenge that comprises some of the most critical steps in the scaling process. We describe the development of such a machine that comprise web guiding, tension control and surface treatment in a compact desk size that is easily moved around and also detail the development of a small cassette based flexographic unit for back electrode printing that is parsimonious in terms of ink usage and more gentle than laboratory scale flexo units where the foil transport is either driven by the flexo unit or the flexo unit is driven by the foil transport. We demonstrate fully operational flexible polymer solar cell manufacture using this new roll and roll-to-roll (R3) approach and compare with the existing methods.

Abstract: Muscle, skeletal, receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK) is a key organizer at the postsynaptic membrane and critical for proper development and maintenance of the neuromuscular junction. Mutations in MUSK result in congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS). We hypothesized that the CMS-causing missense mutation (P344R), found within the cysteine-rich domain of the protein, will affect its conformational tertiary structure. Consequently, the protein will misfold, get retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lose its biological function through degradation by the highly conserved ER associated degradation (ERAD) machinery. We report that P344R-MuSK mutant is trafficking-deficient when expressed at 37°C in HeLa, COS-7 and HEK293 cell lines. It colocalized with the ER marker calnexin in contrast to wild-type MuSK which localized to the plasma membrane. The N-glycosylation status of P344R-MuSK is that of an immature and not properly post-translationally modified protein. Inhibition of protein synthesis showed that the P344R mutant's half-life is shorter than wild-type MuSK protein. Proteasomal inhibition resulted in the stabilization of the mutant protein. The mutant protein is highly ubiquitinated compared to wild-type confirming targeting for proteasomal degradation. The mutant showed around 50% of its in vivo autophosphorylation activity. P344R-MuSK mutant's trafficking defect is correctable by culturing the expressing cells at 27°C. Moreover, chemical compounds namely 2.5% glycerol, 1% dimethyl sulfoxide, 10μM thapsigargin and 1μM curcumin improved the maturation and exit of the mutant protein from the ER. These findings open perspectives for potential therapeutic intervention for patients with CMS harboring the P344R-MuSK mutation.

Abstract: Chronic infection with the food-borne liver fluke, Opisthorchis viverrini, frequently induces cancer of the bile ducts, cholangiocarcinoma. Opisthorchiasis is endemic in Thailand, Lao PDR, Cambodia and Vietnam, where eating undercooked freshwater fish carrying the juvenile stage of this pathogen leads to human infection. Because inhibition of apoptosis facilitates carcinogenesis, this study investigated modulation by thioredoxin from O. viverrini of apoptosis of bile duct epithelial cells, cholangiocytes. Cells of a cholangiocyte line were incubated with the parasite enzyme after which they were exposed hydrogen peroxide. Oxidative stress-induced apoptosis was monitored using flow cytometry, growth in real time and imaging of living cells using laser confocal microscopy. Immunolocalization revealed liver fluke thioredoxin within cholangiocytes. Cells exposed to thioredoxin downregulated apoptotic genes in the mitogen activated protein kinases pathway and upregulated anti-apoptosis-related genes including apoptosis signaling kinase 1, caspase 9, caspase 8, caspase 3, survivin and others. Western blots of immunoprecipitates of cell lysates revealed binding of thioredoxin to apoptosis signaling kinase 1. Together the findings indicated that thioredoxin from O. viverrini inhibited oxidative stress-induced apoptosis of bile duct epithelial cells, which supports a role for this liver fluke oxidoreductase in opisthorchiasis-induced cholangiocarcinogenesis.

Abstract: Aneuploidy is widely acknowledged as a leading cause of miscarriage and birth defects in humans, and is generally known to be deleterious to the survival of individual cells. However, aneuploidy is also ubiquitous in cancer and is found to arise as an adaptive response in certain contexts. This dichotomy of aneuploidy has attracted the interest of researchers for over a century, but many studies have reached conflicting conclusions. The emergence of new technology has allowed scientists to revisit the aneuploidy problem and has fueled a number of recent studies aimed at understanding the effects of aneuploidy on cell physiology. Here, we review these studies, in light of previous observations and knowledge, specifically focusing on the effects of aneuploidy on cellular homeostasis, chromosome stability, and adaptation.

Abstract: The status of the development of triple-junction (amorphous silicon/microcrystalline/microcrystalline silicon) test cells fabricated with up-scalable PECVD processes is given. A first draft of novel rather flat scattering superstrates with an optimized high bandgap amorphous silicon top cell including a carbon-free buffer at the p/i interface is presented. The careful optimization of the interfaces (including sub-oxide doped layers and buffers) and of the bulk crystallinity of the middle and bottom microcrystalline sub-cells allowed to reach a stabilized efficiency of 13.5 % (after 1000h light-soaking, internal measurement). Sub-cells individual developments are discussed and their specific integration into the full triple-junction device with its optimization for AM1.5G illumination relying on a partly LED supported solar simulator characterization is presented.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the degradation behavior of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) and Al-doped ZnO (AZO) films in CIGS PV modules after the damp heat test. We observed losses of the FF and efficiency in the modules after 1000h of damp heat (DH) exposure and some of them were discolored from the outside edge and the center. To clarify the degradation behavior of the non-discolored and discolored modules, a failure analysis for each position of the EVA and AZO in the CIGS module films from the edge to the center was performed. The resistivity of the AZO films in the non-discolored modules increased due to the adsorption of oxygen. In discolored modules, the resistivity of the AZO films rapidly increased at the edge region, and the morphologies of the AZO films were also changed due to the chemical degradation of EVA. These degradation behaviors of the AZO films and EVA in discolored modules were attributed to the formation of hydroxyl and carboxylic species caused by water penetration. Moreover, we reported that the transmittance and the mechanical properties of EVA after 1000h DH exposure were deteriorated by water molecules.

Abstract: After our recent demonstration of a 3D-printed external light trap on a small solar cell, we now consider its potential for large solar panels. An external light trap consists of a parabolic concentrator and a spacer that redirects the photons that are reflected by the solar cell back towards the solar cell. These retro-reflections enable higher absorptance and improved power conversion efficiency. Scaling a single external light trap such that it covers a large solar panel has disadvantages in terms of height and cost of the external light trap. These disadvantages can be overcome by deploying an array of concentrators as the top part of the external light trap. We present an optimization study of concentrator arrays for external light trapping. We fabricated 3D-printed external light traps with a square, hexagonal and circular compound parabolic concentrator to test their suitability for concentrator arrays. The 3D-printed traps were placed on top of an organic solar cell which resulted in a significant enhancement of the external quantum efficiency. The required transmittance of these concentrator arrays is calculated as a function of the parameters of both the concentrator and the solar cell. We compare the theoretical and experimentally determined optical performance of the different concentrators. Finally, the prospects of external light trapping are analyzed and we give guidelines for improvements of the external light trap design.

Abstract: Wafer production with multi-wire sawing leads to a high consumption of wire and a relatively high offcut (kerf loss) of high purity silicon material. In this paper a new approach to reduce these costs in order to achieve a more cost efficient wafering is developed. Investigations of wire behavior during multi-wire sawing have been carried out at commercial multi wire-saws for large-scale production. Virgin and worn wire samples as well as silicon bricks were analyzed with regard to wear condition and diameter. These analyses revealed that material removal (abrasion) occurs mainly at one side of the wire. This suggests that no rotation of the wire around his longitudinal axis takes place during slicing. Because of these findings, a method was developed which is based on a wire with a non-circular cross-section. By this approach, a better exploitation of silicon material and wire can lead to a better cost-effectiveness of wafer and hence solar cells.

Abstract: In this work, Ga-doped ZnO (GZO) films were prepared using the sol–gel dip coating method and the effects of film thickness (230–480nm), heating temperature (400–600°C) and atmosphere (air/argon) on the system structural and opto-electronic performances were investigated. The results show that highly c-axis oriented crystals could be easily formed in GZO coatings, which origins from a preferred nucleation and gets fully developed during the structure evolution. The increase of film thickness prolongs the sol–gel preheating process and promotes nucleation, resulting in a more crystalline film. Higher temperature annealing (600°C) in air could degrade the Ga doping efficiency and decrease the carrier concentration, but the enlarged grain size helps enhance the carrier mobility and improve the film conductivity. Under the modified annealing process in argon, favorable carrier density (3.376×1019cm−3) and mobility (15.74cm2(Vs)−1) can be obtained at the same time, resulting a minimum film resistivity of 1.18×10−2Ωcm. The studied GZO coatings keep transparent in the visible and near infrared range, leading to high emissivity values (>0.738). We firstly prove that the carrier concentration could play a more dominant role than its mobility in determining the thermal emittance performance of thin films.

Abstract: The combination of a phase change material (PCM) with expanded graphite (EG) is a simple and effective way to obtain a form-stable composite PCM with relatively high latent heat and enhanced thermal conductivity. In this paper, aiming at developing a high-performance PCM for medium-temperature latent heat storage applications, RT100, a mixture of paraffinic hydrocarbons with a melting point of around 100°C, has been selected as the PCM to prepare a novel EG-based composite. It is shown that the RT100/EG composite containing 80wt% RT100 is a form-stable PCM. The form-stable RT100/EG composite PCM powders can be compressed into round blocks by dry pressing. All the RT100/EG composite PCM round blocks have much higher thermal conductivity than RT100, and their thermal conductivity linearly increases with the packing density. The thermal conductivity of composite PCM round blocks maintain even in the melting process. Further, the RT100/EG composite PCM shows excellent photo-thermal and direct thermal storage/release performance in simulative condition. Finally, the 200 heating–cooling cycles test along with the structure and thermal property characterizations indicates that the RT100/EG composite PCM has excellent structure stability and good thermal reliability. As a result, the RT100/EG composite PCM with excellent structure stability, good thermal reliability, good formability, enhanced thermal conductivity, excellent photo-thermal performance and good thermal storage/release capacity shows great potential for use in medium-temperature thermal energy storage applications.

Abstract: Rear side hexagonal sphere gratings are demonstrated as diffractive structures that enhance the light path length in the near infrared, where crystalline silicon solar cells suffer from weak absorption. Moreover, the rear side sphere grating can be added behind a solar cell with flat rear surface, giving an “electrically flat but optically rough” device with high efficiency potential. Here, a thin passivating tunnel-contact layer electrically separates the sphere grating from the cell's base. Solar cells with the rear side sphere grating have obtained a VOC of up to 710mV and a FF of up to 81.9%. External quantum efficiency measurements show a current density gain of 1.4mA/cm2 due to the sphere grating. This leads to an overall efficiency of up to 22.1% for the solar cells with planar front side and rear side sphere grating. Estimates for perovskite–silicon and III/V-silicon tandem devices show that the efficiency of tandems can be enhanced by up to 2.4% absolute with a sphere grating on the rear side. Thus, sphere gratings could improve Si-based tandem devices that are limited due to a low current in the Si bottom cell.

Abstract: There has been an increasing interest in plasmon-induced enhancement of solar cells and more recently in the direct generation of photocurrent using noble metal nanoparticles with their Localised Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR) in the visual part of the spectrum. In this paper we report broadband plasmon photocurrent generation using novel Au nanoparticle incorporated mesoporous TiO2 nanotube electrodes. Plasmonic induced photocurrent due to hot electrons is observed over a broad wavelength range (~500 to 1000nm). Incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements undertaken showed a maximum photocurrent enhancement of 200 fold around 700–730nm wavelength.

Abstract: Our previous studies revealed that manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) contributes to the migration and invasion of tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC). The purpose of the current study was to further clarify the mechanisms of SOD2 in the migration and invasion of TSCC. Side population (SP) cells were used as cancer stem-like cells and further assessed by sphere and colony formation assays, and the expression of stem cell markers (Bmi1, Nanog and ABCG2). We found that UM1 cells (TSCC cells with increased SOD2 expression, migration and invasion abilities) possessed a higher proportion of SP cells, sphere and colony formation, and expressed a higher level of stem cell markers compared to UM2 cells (reduced SOD2 expression, migration and invasion abilities). SOD2 expression as well as migration and invasion abilities were enhanced in SP cells compared to non-SP cells. Knockdown of SOD2 in UM1 cells or SP cells inhibited the migration and invasion abilities, reduced sphere and colony formation, and the expression of stem cell markers. Direct binding of the C-myc protein to the SOD2 promoter was demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase assays. Knockdown of C-myc in UM1 cells inhibited SOD2 expression as well as migration and invasion abilities. Our results indicate that cancer stem-like cells play an important role in the migration and invasion of TSCC. SOD2 is a direct target gene of C-myc and C-myc-SOD2-mediated migration and invasion of TSCC involve cancer stem-like cells.

Abstract: Enterovirus 71 (EV71) infections can cause hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), meningoencephalitis, neonatal sepsis, and even fatal encephalitis in children. Unfortunately, there is currently no effective treatment for EV71 infection due to the lack of understanding of viral replication and infection; and viral infections have emerged as an imperative global hazard. Thus, it is extremely important to understand the mechanism of EV71 replication in order to prevent and control the diseases associated with EV71 infections. Early growth response-1 (EGR1) is a multifunctional transcription factor that regulates diverse biological functions, including inflammation, apoptosis, differentiation, tumorigenesis, and even viral infection. Here, we provide new insight into the role of EV71 infection in regulating EGR1 production; and reveal a novel mechanism by which EGR1 facilitates EV71 replication. We demonstrate that EV71 activates EGR1 expression during infection by stimulating the protein kinase A/protein kinase Cɛ/phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt (PKA/PKCɛ/PI3K/Akt) cascade. We further reveal that EV71-activated EGR1, in turn, regulates the internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) of EV71 to enhance viral replication. In addition, EGR1 facilitates EV71 replication by binding directly to stem-loops I and IV of EV71 5′-untranslated region (5′UTR) with its first two zinc fingers. Moreover, EGR1 protein co-localizes with EV71 RNA in the cytoplasm of infected cells to facilitate viral replication. Our results reveal an important new role of EGR1 in viral infection, provide new insight into the novel mechanism underlying the regulation of EV71 replication, and suggest a potential application of EGR1 in the control of EV71 infection.

Abstract: Impairment of mitochondrial protein homeostasis disrupts mitochondrial function and causes human diseases and aging, but the molecular mechanisms of protein synthesis and quality control in mammalian mitochondria are not fully understood. Here we demonstrate in human cells that misincorporation of an arginine analog, canavanine, during mitochondrial protein synthesis, induced aberrant translation products and destabilized the mtDNA-encoded proteome, leading to loss of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes. Furthermore, in the presence of a high concentration of canavanine, mitoribosome stalling could be demonstrated. The stalling did not, however, occur at arginine codons, but downstream of those codons. In particular, two adjacent arginines induced the most prominent downstream stalling effect, with the distance between the arginine codons and the stalling peak corresponding roughly to the length of the ribosomal exit tunnel. These results suggest that misincorporated canavanine disrupted the proper folding of the hydrophobic nascent polypeptides within the exit tunnel or while being inserted into the inner mitochondrial membrane. The canavanine treatment provides a model system for studying the consequences of mitoribosome stalling and the responses to misfolded proteins exiting the mitochondrial ribosome.

Abstract: Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) is triggered by BCR/ABL and SRC family tyrosine kinases. They interact with each other and subsequently activate downstream growth-signaling pathways, including Raf/MEK/ERK, Akt/mTOR, and STAT5 pathways. Although imatinib is the standard treatment for Ph+ leukemia, response rate of Ph+ ALL to imatinib is low, relapse is frequent and quick. Studies have documented the potential anti-tumor activities of curcumin. However, whether curcumin can be used in the therapy for Ph+ ALL remains obscure. Here, we reported that curcumin induced apoptosis by inhibition of AKT/mTOR and ABL/STAT5 signaling, down-regulation of BCR/ABL expression, and induction of the BCL2/BAX imbalance. Curcumin exerted synergetic anti-leukemia effects with imatinib by inhibition of the imatinib-mediated overactivation of AKT/mTOR signaling and down-regulation of BCR/ABL gene expression. In primary samples from Ph+ ALL patients, curcumin inhibited cellular proliferation and down-regulated constitutive activation of growth-signaling pathways not only in newly diagnosed patients but also in imatinib-resistant patients. In Ph+ ALL mouse models, curcumin exhibited synergetic anti-leukemia effects with imatinib. These results demonstrated that curcumin might be a promising agent for Ph+ ALL patients.

Abstract: Thermochromic vanadium dioxide thin films were deposited via aerosol assisted chemical vapour deposition from a precursor solution of vanadyl acetylacetonate in ethanol at 525°C on to fluorine doped tin oxide coated glass substrates. A potential difference was applied between the top plate and substrate during the deposition to generate an electric field with a positive bias applied to the substrate. The films produced were analysed and characterised by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, contact angle and variable temperature UV/Visible spectroscopy. It was found that the presence of an electric field during deposition could lead to a marked change in the microstructure and functional properties of the deposited films; specifically improved wetting and thermochromic properties. An increase in field strength lead to a reduction in crystallite and agglomerate size and an increase in near infrared transmission compared to films grown without the presence of an electric field.

Abstract: Akt is a key mediator of cell proliferation, survival and metabolism. After translocation to the membrane and phosphorylation at T308 and S473, the activated Akt dissociates from the plasma membrane to cytoplasm, which is an important step to phosphorylate its downstream targets. In addition to its central role in regulating the kinase activity, phosphorylation of T308 in the kinase loop has been reported to be necessary for this dissociation process. However, it is not clear whether the membrane detachment requires further mechanisms. In the present report, we demonstrate that membrane dissociation of Akt requires phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) which directly phosphorylates not only T308 but also T34 in the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. Like T308, T34 was phosphorylated in a phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate- and phosphatidylserine-dependent manner. Phosphorylation of T34 also occurred in cells following growth factor stimulation, concurrently with T308 phosphorylation. Moreover, when T34 was mutated to aspartic acid (T34D) to mimic its phosphorylation, Akt-membrane association assessed by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy was significantly reduced. In cells, this mutation impaired the IGF-induced Akt membrane translocation and subsequent phosphorylation at T308 and S473. Taken together, our results demonstrate that T34 phosphorylation by PDK1 promotes the membrane dissociation of activated Akt for its downstream action through attenuating membrane binding affinity. This membrane dissociation mechanism offers a new insight for Akt activation process and provides a potential new target for controlling the Akt-dependent cellular processes.

Abstract: RBM5 (RNA-binding motif protein 5), a nuclear RNA binding protein, is known to trigger apoptosis and induce cell cycle arrest by regulating the activity of the tumor suppressor protein p53. However, its expression and function in spinal cord injury (SCI) are still unknown. To investigate whether RBM5 is involved in central nervous system injury and repair, we performed an acute SCI model in adult rats in this study. Our results showed RBM5 was unregulated significantly after SCI, which was accompanied with an increase in the levels of apoptotic proteins such as p53, Bax, and active caspase-3. Immunofluorescent labeling also showed that traumatic SCI induced RBM5 location changes and co-localization with active caspase-3 in neurons. To further probe the role of RBM5, a neuronal cell line PC12 was employed to establish an apoptotic model. Knockdown of RBM5 apparently decreased the level of p53 as well as active caspase-3, demonstrating its pro-apoptotic role in neurons by regulating expressions of p53 and caspase-3. Taken together, our findings indicate that RBM5 promotes neuronal apoptosis through modulating p53 signaling pathway following SCI.

Abstract: High-haze and wide-spectrum hydrogenated Mg and Ga co-doped ZnO (HMGZO) transparent conductive oxide films on ‘U-shaped’ micro-textured glass are developed using magnetron sputtering. The wet-chemically etched glass substrates with large crater-like features obtained via a frosting method exhibit strong light-scattering capability in a wide wavelength range (~350–1100nm). The morphological, structural, optical and electrical properties of HMGZO films on textured and flat glass are investigated in detail. The HMGZO thin films deposited on textured glasses show conformal growth and have a polycrystalline hexagonal wurtzite phase with a c-axis preferred orientation, which is similar to that of films deposited on flat glass. The electrical resistivity of HMGZO films decreases from 9.74×10−4 to 7.67×10−4Ωcm and the optical band gap Eg is in the range from 3.76 to 3.72eV as the deposition time is increased from 25 to 40min. The HMGZO films with textured glass substrate exhibit stronger light-scattering capability compared with films with flat glass substrate. Finally, an a-Si solar cell deposited on textured glass shows a higher conversion efficiency and short-circuit current density than that deposited on flat glass, as a result of effectively improved light scattering. ZnO-TCO films on low-cost chemically etched glass substrates are promising candidates as front electrodes for thin-film solar cells.

Abstract: Human enhancer of filamentation 1 (HEF1) is a member of the p130Cas family of docking proteins involved in integrin-mediated cytoskeleton reorganization associated with cell migration. Elevated expression of HEF1 promotes invasion and metastasis in multiple cancer cell types. To date, little is known on its role in CRC tumor progression. HEF1 is phosphorylated on several Ser/Thr residues but the effects of these post-translational modifications on the functions of HEF1 are poorly understood. In this manuscript, we investigated the role of HEF1 in migration of colorectal adeno-carcinoma cells. First, we showed that overexpression of HEF1 in colo-carcinoma cell line HCT116 increases cell migration. Moreover, in these cells, HEF1 increases Src-mediated phosphorylation of FAK on Tyr-861 and 925. We then showed that HEF1 mutation on Ser-369 enhances HEF1-induced migration and FAK phosphorylation as a result of protein stabilization. We also, for the first time characterized a functional mutation of HEF1 on Arg-367 which mimics the effect of Ser-369 to Ala mutation. Finally through mass spectrometry experiments, we identified BCAR3 as an essential interactor and mediator of HEF1-induced migration. We demonstrated that single amino acid mutations that prevent formation of the HEF1-BCAR3 complex impair HEF1-mediated migration. Therefore, amino-acid substitutions that impede Ser-369 phosphorylation stabilize HEF1 which increases the migration of CRC cells and this latter effect requires the interaction of HEF1 with the NSP family adaptor protein BCAR3. Collectively, these data reveal the importance of HEF1 expression level in cancer cell motility and then support the utilization of HEF1 as a biomarker of tumor progression.

Abstract: In general, the charge carrier lifetime in n-type silicon is less sensitive to common dissolved metals compared to p-type silicon. However, in experiments it was observed that metal impurities limit the lifetime in n-type multicrystalline (mc) silicon even if high purity feedstock was used. By evaluating Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) and Inducitvely Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) at blocks grown with high purity feedstock, we identified the main currently unavoidable metal impurities present in n-type mc silicon. In addition, we measured the charge carrier lifetime on surface-passivated wafers after different solar cell processes. The measurements were compared to simulations in order to identify the limitations by different impurities and to evaluate the influence of metal precipitates. We found that Cri is an important defect in good grains of as-grown wafers. Dissolved Co can have a severe impact on lifetime after process steps with fast cooling. The lower lifetime in the edge region of the blocks is attributed to FeSi2 precipitates, which explains the poor gettering response of the edge region in contrast to grains in the block center. From the results obtained for FeSi2-precipitates, we concluded that Cu3Si- and NiSi2-precipitates located at crystal defects may be responsible for significant recombination in the block center.

Abstract: Thermal-cracking system has been adopted to produce cracked selenium and the influence of cracked selenium flux on the structure and reaction pathway during the first-step selenization is investigated. High Cracked-Selenium (HC-Se) may facilitate the Cu–Se and In–Se reaction at lower temperatures. The “Polygon grains” observed in the HC-Se samples play a key role in further selenium diffusion into the film since they make the film more incompact. In addition, activation energy analysis indicates that Cu2−xSe and β-In2Se3 formed in the samples prepared in HC-Se atmosphere may result in different growth pathway of Cu(In1−xGax)Se2 (CIGS) thin film compared with that prepared in Low Cracked-Selenium (LC-Se) atmosphere during the first-step selenization, which restrains lamination in CIGS films effectively so that the distribution of Ga is more uniform throughout CIGS films and no small grains of CuGaSe2 (CGS) accumulate near the Mo back-contact. As a result, the shunt conductance in this CIGS thin film device prepared in HC-Se is reduced, and the fill factor, open-circuit voltage, as well as the cell efficiency are improved.

Abstract: The potential induced degradation (PID) of silicon solar modules was investigated in detail in the past years. Nevertheless, even new PV installations exhibit a significant power loss of the system due to PID damage. In this contribution, thermography imaging is shown to be a fast and reliable tool for the detection of PID affected modules to be used in a PV system under operation. Especially the usage of remote controlled multicopters, equipped with a thermographic camera system reduces time and effort to investigate a whole PV installation. PID affected modules yield characteristic temperature patterns in the thermographic images that are comparable to the intensity patterns observed by electroluminescence imaging. A prognosis procedure to directly give an estimate of the power loss of PID affected modules from thermographic images is presented. Hence, the power loss due to PID can be estimated without dismounting the concerned modules from the system. The procedure is successfully applied to a PV system containing modules with different levels of PID damage.

Abstract: The membrane protein TM4SF5, a member of the transmembrane 4L six family, forms a tetraspanin-enriched microdomain (TEM) on the cell surface, where many different membrane proteins and receptors form a massive protein–protein complex to regulate cellular functions including transdifferentiation, migration, and invasion. We recently reported that TM4SF5 causes epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), eventually contributing to aberrant multilayer cellular growth, drug resistance, enhanced migration, invasion, its circulation in the blood, tumor initiation for successful metastasis, and muscle development in zebrafish. In this review, I summarize the information on the role of TM4SF5 in EMT-related functions at TM4SF5-enriched microdomain (T5EM) on cell surface, where proteins such as TM4SF5, CD151, CD44, integrins, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) can form numerous protein complexes. TM4SF5-mediated EMT contributes to diverse cellular functions, leading to fibrotic phenotypes and initiating and maintaining tumors in primary and/or metastatic regions, in addition to its role in muscle development in zebrafish. Anti-TM4SF5 strategies for addressing the protein networks can lead to regulation of the fibrotic, tumorigenic, and tumor-maintaining functions of TM4SF5-positive hepatic cells. This review is for us to (re)consider the antifibrotic or antitumorigenic (i.e., anti-EMT-related diseases) strategies of dealing with protein networks that would be involved in cross-talks to regulate various cellular functions during TM4SF5-dependent progression from fibrotic to cancerous hepatic cells.

Abstract: Four different module layouts for indium tin oxide (ITO)-free flexible organic solar modules with device performance varying from 1.8% to 2.7% are reported in this work. Module 1, with a device efficiency of 2.5% on an active area of 88cm2, demonstrates the up scaling of small area cells to larger area modules. Module 2, with a device efficiency of 1.8% and 106.4V on an active area of 32.6cm2, demonstrates high voltage on a small area. Module 3, with a device efficiency of 2% on an active area of 60.8cm2 with a hexagonal layout, demonstrates the flexibility in module layout. Module 4 built as a reference module device on small active area of 6.1cm2 had a device efficiency of 2.7%. PEDOT:PSS together with a metal grid is the transparent hole contact replacing ITO. The reference modules were also built without the metal grid (only PEDOT:PSS has a hole contact) and measured under 2000 and 500lx resulting in the modules without grid outperforming the ones with grid. Therefore for indoor applications modules can be processed even without the top metal grid for current collection which not only reduces the material cost and the number of processing step but also eliminates the major concern of depositing metal electrodes on top of organic layers.

Abstract: Solar selective coatings based on double Al2O3:W cermet layers and AlSiN/AlSiON bilayer structures were prepared by magnetron sputtering. Both were deposited on stainless steel substrates using a metallic tungsten (W) layer as back reflector. The coating stacks were completed by an antireflection (AR) layer composed of Al2O3, SiO2, or AlSiOx. Spectrophotometer measurements, X-Ray diffraction, Scanning electron microscopy, Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy and Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry were used to characterize the optical properties, crystalline structure, morphology and composition of these coatings. The spectral optical constants of the single layers were calculated from the reflectance and transmittance measurements and used to design the optical stack. The coatings exhibit a solar absorptance of 93–95% and an emissivity of 7–10% (at 400°C). The coatings also exhibit excellent thermal stability, with small changes in the optical properties of the coating during heat-treatments at 400°C in air for 2500h and at 580°C in vacuum for 850h. The coating based on the AlSiN/AlSiON bilayer structure was obtained with an Al:Si ratio of 2.5:1. These coatings revealed similar performance as the one obtained with coatings based on Al2O3:W cermet layers.

Abstract: High efficiency, thin-film Epitaxial Lift-Off (ELO) III–V solar cells offer excellent characteristics for implementation in flexible solar panels for space applications. However, the current thin-film ELO solar cell design generally includes a copper handling and support foil. Copper diffusion has a potentially detrimental effect on the device performance and the challenging environment provided by space (high temperatures, electron and proton irradiation) might induce diffusion. It is shown that heat treatments induce copper diffusion. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) is the most affected solar cell parameter. The decrease in Voc can be explained by enhanced non-radiative recombination via Cu trap levels in the middle of the band gap. The decrease in Voc is found to be dependent on junction depth. In all Cu cells annealed at T≥300°C signs of Cu diffusion are present, which implies that a barrier layer inhibiting Cu diffusion is necessary. Electron radiation damage was found to have no influence on Cu diffusion.
