Abstract: Summary
The nature of pH in a pure water pool that is too small to have a continuous population of ions formed by water dissociation is not settled. Here, we use stochastic kinetics simulations of the water dissociation reaction in pools ranging from 103 to 1016 waters to characterize water ion lifetimes and populations. An availability coefficient is defined to quantify the intermittent presence of ion pairs during an arbitrary observation period and used in a proposed definition for the effective pH of nanoscopic pools. The effective pH converges to the bulk value of 7 for water pools in the range of 1010 waters. The lifetimes of water ion pairs are found to increase with increasing water pool size due to the balance between their formation and recombination kinetics, with a maximum near the size where bulk-like characteristics begin to dominate and ion pairs are continuously present.

Abstract: Summary
Clear visualization and understanding of luminescence properties of grain interiors and grain boundaries in polycrystalline thin-film photovoltaic materials are crucial to achieving high-performance solar cells. Luminescence-based measurements, for example, reveal sub-bandgap energetic disorder or impurity-related radiative transitions in these materials, and when performed in the absolute scale, they can show the extent of voltage-limiting non-radiative recombination. Here we use a hyperspectral imaging technique to investigate inter- and intra-grain photoluminescence variations in polycrystalline CdSe0.1Te0.9 films made by the colossal grain growth process. We observe that grain boundaries show higher luminescence than grain interiors for all energies below the bandgap energy. Multiple distinct sub-bandgap defect transitions are detected and determined to be related to donor-acceptor pair impurities. A comparison of the excitation-intensity-dependent photoluminescence at the grain boundaries with grain interiors suggests that carrier concentration is higher at grain boundaries. This finding is supported by photoemission electron microscopy imaging of the films, showing ≈70 meV upward energy shift in the band structure at the grain boundaries. Finally, we investigate a dramatic thermal quenching behavior related to the donor-acceptor pairs luminescence over a temperature range and use a rate-equation model to attribute it to the sudden redirection of the radiative recombination channels to non-radiative channels with increasing temperature.

Abstract: Although phenotypically different, brown adipose tissue (BAT) and inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) are able to produce heat through non-shivering thermogenesis due to the presence of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). The appearance of thermogenically active beige adipocytes in iWAT is known as browning. Both brown and beige cells originate from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and in culture conditions a browning response can be induced with hypothermia (i.e. 32 °C) during which nuclear leptin immunodetection was observed. The central role of leptin in regulating food intake and energy consumption is well recognised, but its importance in the browning process at the cellular level is unclear. Here, immunocytochemical analysis of MSC-derived adipocytes established nuclear localization of both leptin and leptin receptor suggesting an involvement of the leptin pathway in the browning response. In order to elucidate whether leptin modulates the expression of brown and beige adipocyte markers, BAT and iWAT samples from leptin-deficient (ob/ob) mice were analysed and exhibited reduced brown/beige marker expression compared to wild-type controls. When MSCs were isolated and differentiated into adipocytes, leptin deficiency was observed to induce a white phenotype, especially when incubated at 32 °C. These adaptations were accompanied with morphological signs of impaired adipogenic differentiation. Overall, our results indicate that leptin supports adipocyte browning and suggest a potential role for leptin in adipogenesis and browning.

Abstract: Summary
Electrocatalytic conversion of dinitrogen and carbon dioxide directly to urea by C–N coupling could be an eco-friendly alternative to the current synthetic route, which uses ammonia produced via the Haber-Bosch process. Recent experiments have shown that bimetallic catalysts with defective configurations can be synthesized. However, diverse possible element combinations and unclear mechanisms are challenges in their rational design. Here, in-depth calculations are performed to investigate the catalytic performance of a series of bimetals anchored on N-doped graphene. Through a two-step screening strategy and investigation of free energy, a Ti-Co@NC catalyst is found to exhibit an ultra-low onset potential of 0.23 V, catalyzing the reaction efficiently. Furthermore, molecular electrostatic potential maps and dual descriptor diagrams reveal that CO prefers to tilt-attack ∗N2 to promote C–N coupling effectively. The reaction process can be enhanced by controlling the transfer of electrons between two metallic sites. These results will increase the understanding of C–N coupling in urea electrosynthesis and inspire rational catalyst design.

Abstract: Summary
We report the use of MIL-120 as a water-stable and cost-effective metal-organic framework (MOF) for selectively capturing CO2 from wet flue gas. Synthesized using inexpensive and environmentally benign reagents in water, MIL-120 possesses one-dimensional pores decorated with hydroxyl-bridged Al(III) ions and benzene rings with an interstitial spacing of 4.78 Å. Carbon dioxide isotherms show steep uptake at low pressure, and the affinity of MIL-120 for CO2 is 44 kJ mol−1. CO2-loading 13C solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier transform infrared spectra tracking the sorption of CO2 into MIL-120 revealed that the interplay of pore size, functionality, and dimensionality is vital for CO2 restriction within the pores of MIL-120. Breakthrough experiments reveal that MIL-120 can capture CO2 from dry and wet flue gas with uptake capacities of 1.215 and 1.118 mmol g−1, respectively. Our work highlights the synthetic benefits of MIL-120 and elucidates its selective capture of CO2 from wet flue gas.

Abstract: Summary
Adsorption systems promise to address energy storage, water harvesting, and carbon capture, among other applications in energy and sustainability. Improving the kinetics of the sorbent layer is essential to enable substantial enhancement in the performance of such systems, but challenges remain owing to the highly tortuous and random distribution of adsorbents. Here, we present a boiling-assisted channel-templating (BACT) coating method to enhance the kinetics of sorbent layers. Driven by boiling-induced vapor flow, randomly distributed adsorbents become well aligned, approaching the theoretical minimum tortuosity of porous structures. Using water adsorption in zeolite-coated copper foam, we demonstrate 2× improvement in effective diffusivity. We develop design guidelines to control the porous structure. For AQSOA-Z02 coating, the BACT method was able to reduce tortuosity to 1.09. We show the impact of BACT on adsorptive systems where cyclability can be improved by ≈1.7× compared with state-of-the-art coatings. This work demonstrates a simple, low-cost, and scalable approach to enhance sorption kinetics.

Abstract: Summary
Phase change materials are promising for thermal energy storage; however, one major bottleneck for their practical implementation is their unclear supercooling behaviors. In this work, we introduce a framework to predict the degree of supercooling for a phase change material subject to arbitrary geometrical and thermal conditions by analyzing the phase change material’s intrinsic nucleation characteristics with a statistical model. The prediction capability of our framework is successfully validated with experiments using magnesium chloride hexahydrate as a phase change material. For a system with a uniform temperature distribution, our framework can predict the average degree of supercooling. For a general case such as phase change materials embedded in a heat sink, the framework can accurately predict the expected time, with less than 8% deviation, for nucleation under given conditions. This work provides important insights in understanding and predicting supercooling behavior, thereby providing guidelines for the optimal design of phase change material-based thermal energy storage applications.

Abstract: Summary
Toward building non-flammable lithium-ion batteries with high energy density, Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) has recently attracted considerable attention as a compelling solid-state lithium-ion electrolyte. Unlike other lithium-ion soft solid conductors such as those based on sulfides, LLZO can be manufactured with a bilayer dense-porous microstructure, which prevents the issues of dynamic volume change of the anode and the formation of voids at the lithium/solid-state electrolyte interface during cycling. Here, we report a facile, ultrafast sintering methodology for the fabrication of LLZO solid-state electrolytes in the form of self-standing bilayer dense-porous LLZO membranes. The thicknesses of the dense and porous layers are approximately 8 and 55 μm, respectively, which hypothetically allows them to achieve the high gravimetric and volumetric energy densities of lithium-garnet batteries of 218 Wh kg−1 and 769 Wh L−1, respectively. Electrochemical measurements confirm that the LLZO membranes possess a high critical current density up to 1.7 mA cm−2.

Abstract: Cold atmospheric plasmas and plasma-treated solutions (PTSs) have emerged as promising approaches in cancer treatment because of their tumor-selective actions. While oxidative stress is critical for their effects, the precise mechanisms, including chemical mediators, remain obscure. Previously, we reported that air plasma-activated medium (APAM) exhibited tumor-selective anticancer activity. The fragmentation of mitochondria and their asymmetrical assembly around the peripheral regions of the damaged nucleus, namely, monopolar perinuclear mitochondrial clustering (MPMC), proceed to the effect. Subsequently, we found that APAM had a substantial amount of O3 in addition to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), nitrile (NO2-), and nitrate (NO3-). In the present study, we investigated the possible role of O3 in the anticancer effect. For this purpose, we created a nitrogen oxide-free ozonated medium ODM. ODM exhibited potent cytotoxicity against various cancer but not nonmalignant cells. ODM also increased MPMC, hydroxyl radicals, lipid peroxides, and their shifts to perinuclear sites in cancer cells. Catalase and iron chelation prevented these events and cytotoxicity. ODM also decreases the intracellular labile irons while increasing those within mitochondria. ODM had substantial H2O2, but this oxidant failed to cause MPMC and cytotoxicity. These results show that ODM can mimic the effects of APAM, including MPMC and tumor-selective anticancer effects. The findings suggest that O3 is critical in mediating the anticancer effects of APAM by triggering oxidative cell death caused by H2O2 and iron.

Abstract: Summary
Building robust porous molecular architectures with van der Waals interactions holds promise for advancements in catalysis, chemosensing, and separation techniques. In a macroscopic context, grand buildings, toy houses, and jigsaw puzzles can be constructed with bricks, building blocks, and jigsaw pieces, where shape complementarity and structural interdigitation are vital components. Nevertheless, translating this construction approach to the molecular level proves to be a formidable challenge, especially when aiming to create robust and porous architectures. Here, we report a molecular porous crystal featuring a layered packing arrangement in which concaved building blocks are assembled through interdigitation. Despite the prevalence of structural interdigitation, one-dimensional channels spanning across layers emerge as a result of the considerable size and irregular shape of the constituent building blocks. It is further demonstrated that this new type of porous molecular crystals exhibits significant structural flexibility, as well as exceptional thermal and chemical stability.

Novel insights into the pharmacological modulation of human periodontal ligament stem cells by the amino-bisphosphonate Alendronate,

Abstract: Alendronate (ALN) is a second-generation bisphosphonate widely used for osteoporosis and cancer-induced bone lesions. Many studies have confirmed a strong relationship between osteonecrosis of the jaws (ONJ) development and oral bisphosphonates, especially ALN, although the molecular mechanisms underlying this pathology have not yet been elucidated. The reduction in bone turnover and vascularization usually observed in ONJ are the result of ALN action on different cell types harboured in oral microenvironment, such as osteoclasts, endothelial cells, and periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs). In this perspective, the present study aims to investigate the effects of different ALN concentrations (2 μM, 5 μM, 10 μM, 25 μM, 50 μM) on the phenotype and functional properties of human PDLSCs (hPDLSCs). hPDLSCs showed a decrease in cell viability (MTT assay) only when treated with ALN concentration of 10 μM or larger for 48 h and 72 h. Cell cycle analysis revealed a moderate increase in proportion of S-phase cells after exposure to low ALN concentration (2–5 μM), an effect that was reverted after exposure to 10–50 μM ALN. Conversely, cell death was evidenced via Annexin V/PI assay at very high concentration of ALN (50 μM) after 4 days of treatment. In addition, we explored whether the effects of ALN on hPDLSCs growth and survival can be mediated by its ability to modulate oxidative stress. To this, we quantified the intracellular ROS amount and lipid peroxidation by using DCF probe and Bodipy staining, respectively. Flow cytometry analysis showed that ALN induced a dose-dependent reduction of intracellular oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation upon treatment with low concentrations at both 48 h and 72 h. Increased levels of oxidative stress was reported at 50 μM ALN and was also confirmed via TEM analysis. Despite the stability of the cellular immunophenotype, hPDLSCs showed impaired mobility after ALN exposure. Chronic exposure (7–14 days) to ALN in the range of 2–10 μM significantly decreased the expression of the differentiation-related factors ALP, RUNX2, COLI, and OPN as well as the osteogenic ability of hPDLSCs compared with untreated cells. Conversely, higher doses were found to be neutral. Our findings indicated that the effects of ALN on hPDLSCs behavior are dose-dependent and suggest a role for oxidative stress in ALN-induced cell death that may lead to novel therapeutic approaches for ONJ.

Abstract: We report here an instructive case referred at 16 months-old for exploration of hemolysis without anemia (compensated anemia with reticulocytosis). The biology tests confirmed the hemolysis with increased total and indirect bilirubin. The usual hemolysis diagnosis tests were normal (DAT, G6PD, PK, Hb electrophoresis) except cytology and ektacytometry suggesting an association of multiple red blood cell (RBC) membrane disorders. This led us to propose a molecular screening analysis using targeted-Next Generation Sequencing (t-NGS) with a capture technique on 93 genes involved in RBC and erythropoiesis defects. We identified 4 missense heterozygous allelic variations, all of them were described without any significance (VUS) in the SLC4A1, RhAG, PIEZO1 and SPTB genes. The study of the familial cosegregation and research functional tests allowed to decipher the role of at least two by two genes in the phenotype and the hemolytic disease of this young patient. Specialized t-NGS panel (or virtual exome/genome sequencing) in a disease-referent laboratory and the motivated collaboration of clinicians, biologists and scientists should be the gold standard for improving the diagnosis of the patients affected with RBC diseases or rare inherited anemias.

Abstract: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common pediatric cancer, and the infiltration of leukemic cells is critical for disease progression and relapse. Nuclear deformability plays a critical role in cancer cell invasion through confined spaces; however, the direct impact of epigenetic changes on the nuclear deformability of leukemic cells remains unclear. Here, we characterized how 3D collagen matrix conditions induced H3K4 methylation in ALL cell lines and clinical samples. We used specific shRNA and chemical inhibitors to target WDR5 (a core subunit involved in H3K4 methylation) and determined that targeting WDR5 reduced the H3K4 methylation induced by the 3D environment and the invasiveness of ALL cells in vitro and in vivo. Intriguingly, targeting WDR5 did not reduce the adhesion or the chemotactic response of leukemia cells, suggesting a different mechanism by which H3K4 methylation might govern ALL cell invasiveness. Finally, we conducted biochemical, and biophysical experiments to determine that 3D environments promoted the alteration of the chromatin, the morphology, and the mechanical behavior of the nucleus in ALL cells. Collectively, our data suggest that 3D environments control an upregulation of H3K4 methylation in ALL cells, and targeting WDR5 might serve as a promising therapeutic target against ALL invasiveness in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Currently, one of the key challenges preventing the wide commercialization of polymer-based solid-state batteries is achieving high-rate capabilities. This work unravels chain structure and segmental dynamics in a polymer-based composite cathode consisting of LiFePO4 (LFP), carbon, and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) with lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide. Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) data reveal that PEO chains are adsorbed on the surface of LFP particles during slurry processing to make the composite electrode. The strong interaction between LFP and PEO chains leads to greatly reduced segmental dynamics of PEO, as discovered by quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS). The reduced segmental dynamics results in 70% decreased Li+ mobility of the polymer electrolyte in the composite cathode. The combined SANS and QENS study indicates that one of the key bottlenecks that limits the rate performance of PEO-based polymer batteries originates from molecular interactions within the cathode.

Abstract: Summary
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) derived from natural toxins and venoms offer a promising alternative source of antibiotics. Here, through structure-function-guided design, we convert two natural AMPs derived from the venom of the solitary eumenine wasp Eumenes micado into α-helical AMPs with reduced toxicity that kill Gram-negative bacteria in vitro and in a preclinical mouse model. To identify the sequence determinants conferring antimicrobial activity, an alanine scan screen and strategic single lysine substitutions are made to the amino acid sequence of these natural peptides. These efforts yield a total of 34 synthetic derivatives, including alanine substituted and lysine-substituted sequences with stabilized α-helical structures and increased net positive charge. The resulting lead synthetic peptides kill the Gram-negative pathogens Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO1 and PA14) by rapidly permeabilizing both their outer and cytoplasmic membranes, exhibit anti-infective efficacy in a mouse model by reducing bacterial loads by up to three orders of magnitude, and do not readily select for bacterial resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Remarkable efforts have been made for room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials; however, achieving desirable RTP materials in water remains a focus of researchers. Here, we report a high-performance RTP platform based on hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) by simple and efficient in situ encapsulation of phosphor into HOF materials. The obtained host-guest materials not only exhibit phosphorescent lifetime of up to 4.91 ms but also resist water and oxygen quenching agents to maintain phosphorescence in aqueous solution. In addition, an attractive triplet-to-singlet Förster resonance energy transfer (TS-FRET) platform can be easily fabricated by embedding Nile red (NilR) acceptor into HOFs@NPA (NPA: 4-bromo-1,8-naphthalic anhydride) donor materials. Furthermore, the proposed HOF-based RTP materials can be facilely processed into luminescent film. This HOF-based RTP strategy may act as a facile and versatile route toward outstanding RTP materials in aqueous solution.

Abstract: Summary
Continuous nanolattices are an emerging class of mechanical metamaterials that are highly attractive due to their superior strength-to-weight ratios, which originate from their spatial architectures and nanoscale-sized elements possessing near-theoretical strength. Rational design of frameworks remains challenging below 50 nm because of limited methods to arrange small elements into complex architectures. Here, we fabricate silica frameworks with ∼4- to 20-nm-thick elements using self-assembly and silica templating of DNA origami nanolattices and perform in situ micro-compression testing to examine the mechanical properties. We observe strong effects of lattice dimensions on yield strength (σy) and failure mode. Silica nanolattices are found to exhibit yield strengths higher than those of any known engineering materials with similar mass density. The robust coordination of the nanothin and strong silica elements leads to the combination of lightweight and high-strength framework materials offering an effective strategy for the fabrication of nanoarchitected materials with superior mechanical properties.

Abstract: Summary
Chloride solid electrolytes represented by Li3YCl6 excel simultaneously in ionic conductivity, deformability, and oxidative stability; their structure-property relationship would provide guiding principles for designing high-performance solid electrolytes. Here, we report that the prototype system Li3YCl6 does not exhibit the P3¯m1 symmetry as commonly believed. This structure occurs only when the material partially decomposes at an overly high annealing temperature of 550°C. With the decomposition being suppressed at 450°C, the material shows a Pnma symmetry instead. Based on this orthorhombic structure, the ion-transport mechanism is clarified through neutron diffraction and first-principles computation. Guided by the established structure-property relationship, the efficient ion transport previously achievable only in the low-crystallinity state is realized in highly crystalline materials. The all-solid-state cells formed by this high-crystallinity material and LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 deliver performance exceeding most reported Li3YCl6-based cells; under 3 C at 25°C, the capacity retention is above 80% for 780 cycles.

Abstract: Summary
The development of efficient and sustainable methods for hydrosilane and hydrogermane functionalization is of importance due to their abundant use as functional modifiers and high bond dissociation energy. Despite advances in photoredox catalysis, expensive photocatalysts and hydrogen atom transfer mediators are usually required for functionalization. In contrast, we herein report on a photoelectrochemical iron-catalyzed alkene silyl arylation that harnesses the power of light and electricity for challenging Si–H and Ge–H activation. Notably, the reaction features iron complexes used as earth-abundant photocatalysts and chloride as a green and inexpensive hydrogen atom transfer reagent. Detailed mechanistic studies elucidated the silane activation mode under photoelectrochemical iron catalysis.

Abstract: Summary
The placement of main-group functionalities within polymers represents a strategy to access a wide catalog of materials but is limited by poor understanding of the catalyst selection criteria and polymerization mechanism when moving down the periodic table. Here, we study a series of new heterobimetallic carbon dioxide and carbon disulfide/epoxide copolymerization catalysts that allow for a comparative mechanistic understanding of two ring-opening copolymerization processes. We reveal that the distinct roles each metal plays are preserved from carbon dioxide to carbon disulfide, maintaining activity and selectivity across copolymerizations. Experimental and computational studies show that carbon disulfide/epoxide copolymerization can be understood as a series of structurally related insertion events that are interlinked by a central oxygen/sulfur scrambling reaction at the propagating chain end. This facilitates the synthesis of new carbon dioxide-/carbon disulfide-/epoxide-derived terpolymers with improved degradability over the parent carbon dioxide/epoxide copolymers at low levels of sulfur incorporation.

Abstract: Summary
Bulk bismuth, which has a large tap density and low specific surface area, is considered a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries. However, bulk bismuth suffers from pulverization upon cycling and sluggish sodium-ion diffusion. Herein, we report micro-sized porous bulk bismuth particles caged by carbon (P-Bi/C) with micro- and nanoscale elements as anodes for sodium-ion batteries. Bicontinuous nanopores provide buffer spaces to accommodate volume expansion of bismuth during cycling, while interconnected bismuth nanoligaments maintain excellent electrochemical stability. Moreover, the reversible formation of NaBi and hexagonal Na3Bi phases with high sodium-ion diffusivity enables fast electron and ion transport. The P-Bi/C anode has a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 95.2%, a high rate capability of 153.2 mAh g−1 at 150C (1C = 400 mA g−1), and excellent cycling stability for over 20,000 cycles. This work aims to advance practical applications for bismuth in fast-charging sodium-ion batteries.

Abstract: Summary
Hybrid electrochemical and biological systems hold promise for producing valuable products from abundant feedstocks. An electrolyzer-bioreactor assembly using wastewater streams as catholytes could bring bioelectrochemical methanogenesis closer to practical implementation. Herein, we develop a zero-gap cell with a porous transport layer in the cathode specifically conceptualized for operating in line with a wastewater-fed methanogenic reactor. In-depth analysis of the electrode composition indicates an up to 4-fold variation of the current density depending on the binder and carbon black contents. This electrolyzer configuration and electrode selection, along with a robust pentlandite-type cathode catalyst, Fe3Ni3Co3S8, allow for an efficient supply of hydrogen into the catholyte that recirculates through the bioreactor, which is dominated by Methanobacterium and Methanobrevibacter archaea. This hybrid system produces methane over 220 days with a maximal weekly average rate of 669 LN m−2cathode d−1. The corresponding average current density sustained by the entire hybrid system is 30 mA cm−2 at a 2.2 V set potential.

Abstract: Summary
The development of strategies to maintain the long-term presence of reactive oxygen species in tumor sites remains an urgent issue to be addressed. Here, we design platelet exosome hybrid liposome nanovesicles (named platelet-derived exosome hybrid liposomes co-loaded with DPDPy and chloroperoxidase [DCHL]) co-loading aggregation-induced emission (AIE) photosensitizers and chloroperoxidases to facilitate uninterrupted singlet oxygen (1O2) generation for enhancing breast cancer immunotherapy. When DCHL enters tumor cells, it lyses under external laser irradiation, thus releasing AIE photosensitizers (DPDPy) and chloroperoxidase. Subsequently, chloroperoxidase utilizes hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and chloride to synthesize HClO, and, as a second step, HClO reacts with H2O2 to form 1O2. Therefore, uninterrupted 1O2 generation is achieved. The experimental results show that DCHL plus light can lead to systemic immune response, increase the proportion of central memory T cells and tumor-infiltrating T cells, and thereby delay tumor recurrence and rechallenge. Overall, the DCHL system provides a good idea for the design of tumor treatment system.

Abstract: Summary
Constructing quantum corrals on a surface is an effective strategy for precise regulation of surface electronic states. Nevertheless, this strategy has only been demonstrated to work when the corrals are adsorbed directly on coinage metals. Herein, we report large-distance electronic state confinement passing through a single-layer graphene (SLG) by an extended molecular adlayer. Although the adlayer is 6.7 Å away from Cu(111) with the graphene sheet in between, the corrals defined by the adlayer can still trap the free electron gas of the Cu surface effectively, lifting the dispersive band of Cu. The electron donated from Cu substrate to SLG is demonstrated to migrate above the SLG surface instead of accumulating at the Cu-SLG interface. The physisorbed molecular layer sharpens the dispersion of graphene electronic states. Our results open new possibilities for the design of hybrid electronic devices and graphene modification.

Abstract: Summary
The direct use of alcohols as coupling partners via homolytic C–OH bond cleavage remains a formidable challenge but holds great opportunities to achieve useful transformations. In this context, the use of free alcohols as precursors of carbon radicals in nickel-catalyzed asymmetric dicarbofunctionalization of tethered olefins is highly desirable. Reported herein is an asymmetric reductive aryl-benzylation of alkenes using free benzyl alcohols mediated by a nickel-titanium bimetallic system. The reaction affords the corresponding chiral benzene-fused cyclic compounds including oxindoles, dihydrobenzofurans, tetralins, indane, and isochroman bearing an all-carbon quaternary stereocenter with up to 99% enantiomeric excess. The practical utilities of the protocol are demonstrated in the late-stage modification of some scaffolds in pharmaceuticals and natural products. This study shows that the key to success is the merging of titanium-mediated direct homolysis of alcoholic C–O bonds with nickel-catalyzed asymmetric olefin difunctionalization.

Abstract: The differentiation of fibroblasts into pathological myofibroblasts during wound healing is characterized by increased cell surface expression of αv-integrins. Our previous studies found that the deubiquitinase (DUB) USP10 removes ubiquitin from αv-integrins, leading to cell surface integrin accumulation, subsequent TGFβ1 activation, and pathological myofibroblast differentiation. In this study, a yeast two-hybrid screen revealed a novel binding partner for USP10, the formin, DAAM1. We found that DAAM1 binds to and inhibits USP10’s DUB activity through the FH2 domain of DAAM1 independent of its actin functions. The USP10/DAAM1 interaction was also supported by proximity ligation assay (PLA) in primary human corneal fibroblasts. Treatment with TGFβ1 significantly increased USP10 and DAAM1 protein expression, PLA signal, and co-localization to actin stress fibers. DAAM1 siRNA knockdown significantly reduced co-precipitation of USP10 and DAAM1 on purified actin stress fibers, and β1- and β5-integrin ubiquitination. This resulted in increased αv-, β1-, and β5-integrin total protein levels, αv-integrin recycling, and extracellular fibronectin (FN) deposition. Together, our data demonstrate that DAAM1 inhibits USP10’s DUB activity on integrins subsequently regulating cell surface αv-integrin localization and FN accumulation.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as promising cell-based therapies in the treatment of degenerative and inflammatory conditions. However, despite accumulating evidence of the breadth of MSC functional potency, their broad clinical translation is hampered by inconsistencies in therapeutic efficacy, which is at least partly due to the phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of MSC populations as they progress towards senescence in vitro. MSC senescence, a natural response to aging and stress, gives rise to altered cellular responses and functional decline. This review describes the key regenerative properties of MSCs; summarises the main triggers, mechanisms, and consequences of MSC senescence; and discusses current cellular and extracellular strategies to delay the onset or progression of senescence, or to rejuvenate biological functions lost to senescence.

Abstract: Background
Reaching a precise diagnosis in rare inherited anemia is extremely difficult and challenging, especially in areas with limited use of genetic studies, which makes undiagnosed anemia a unique clinical entity in tertiary hematology centers. In this study, we aim at plotting a stepwise diagnostic approach in children with undiagnosed anemia while identifying indications for genetic testing.
Patients and methods
A one-year cross-sectional study involved 44 children and adolescents with undiagnosed anemia after undergoing an initial routine panel of investigations. They were classified based on mean corpuscular volume (MCV) into 3 groups: microcytic (n = 19), normocytic (n = 14) and macrocytic (n = 11). An algorithm that included four levels of investigations was devised for each category.
Results
After applying a systematic diagnostic approach, 33 patients (75 %) were diagnosed of whom 7 (15 %) had combined diagnoses, while 11 (25 %) patients remained undiagnosed. Based on the first, second, third and fourth levels of investigations, patients were diagnosed, respectively, as follows: of the 11 patients, 7 were microcytic, 3 normocytic and 1 macrocytic; of the 7 patients, 2 were microcytic, 2 normocytic, and 3 macrocytic; of 10 patients, 5 were microcytic, 4 normocytic and 1 macrocytic; finally, of the 16 patients, 8 were microcytic, 6 normocytic and 2 macrocytic. Numbers recorded appear higher than the actual number of the patients because some of them were diagnosed by more than one level of investigation. The diagnoses obtained in the microcytic group showed hemoglobinopathies, iron refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA), membrane defects, sideroblastic anemia, hypo-transferrinemia, a combined diagnosis of sickle cell trait and pyropoikilocytosis. The diagnoses also showed a combined diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis (HS) and alpha thalassemia minor, and a combined diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia and beta thalassemia minor, while 15 % remained undiagnosed. In the normocytic group, the diagnosis revealed autosomal recessive (AR) HS, vitamin B12 deficiency, pyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD), congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA) type I, Diamond Blackfan anemia and beta thalassemia major. In addition, it showed a combined diagnosis of AR HS and CDA type II, a combined diagnosis of AR HS and PKD, and a combined diagnosis of dehydrated stomatocytosis (DHS) and G6PD carrier, meanwhile 20 % remained undiagnosed. Finally, the macrocytic group was diagnosed by vitamin B12 deficiency, sideroblastic anemia, PKD, a combined diagnosis of PKD and G6PD deficiency carrier, while 45 % remained undiagnosed.
Conclusion
Conducting a stepwise approach with different levels of investigations may help reach the diagnosis of difficult anemia without having to resort to unnecessary investigations. Combined diagnosis is an important cause of undiagnosed anemia, especially in countries with high frequency of consanguinity. The remaining 25 % of the patients continued to be undiagnosed, requiring more sophisticated investigations.

Abstract: Research on the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the genome and its distribution within the nuclear space has made a big leap in the last two decades. Work in the animal field has led to significant advances in our general understanding on eukaryotic genome organization. This did not only bring along insights into how the 3D genome interacts with the epigenetic landscape and the transcriptional machinery but also how 3D genome architecture is relevant for fundamental developmental processes, such as cell differentiation. In parallel, the 3D organization of plant genomes have been extensively studied, which resulted in both congruent and novel findings, contributing to a more complete view on how eukaryotic genomes are organized in multiple dimensions. Plant genomes are remarkably diverse in size, composition, and ploidy. Furthermore, as intrinsically sessile organisms without the possibility to relocate to more favorable environments, plants have evolved an elaborate epigenetic repertoire to rapidly respond to environmental challenges. The diversity in genome organization and the complex epigenetic programs make plants ideal study subjects to acquire a better understanding on universal features and inherent constraints of genome organization. Furthermore, considering a wide range of species allows us to study the evolutionary crosstalk between the various levels of genome architecture. In this article, we aim at summarizing important findings on 3D genome architecture obtained in various plant species. These findings cover many aspects of 3D genome organization on a wide range of levels, from gene loops to topologically associated domains and to global 3D chromosome configurations. We present an overview on plant 3D genome organizational features that resemble those in animals and highlight facets that have only been observed in plants to date.

Abstract: Summary
Lanthipeptide biosynthetic genes are present in a wide range of bacteria, providing convenient tools for engineering bioactive lanthipeptides. Here, we report a class I lanthipeptide biosynthetic gene cluster (lanBTC) in a Bacillus strain, involved in the biosynthesis of a novel lanthipeptide that we termed balucin. Balucin was active against food-borne pathogens such as Bacillus cereus and Listeria monocytogenes. The unusual structural features of balucin showed the presence of aspartic acid residues C-terminally flanking the lanthionine rings. Such negatively charged amino acids directly flanking modifiable cysteines at the C-terminal side have not been reported for precursors that are modified by other LanBCs. Heterologous functional expression of balucin in a dedicated E. coli expression system was achieved, and the protease responsible for cleaving the balucin leader peptide was identified. With this system, the balucin biosynthetic enzymes were successfully employed to modify antimicrobial peptides that have negatively charged residues C-terminally flanking lanthionine-forming cysteines.

Introduction
Immune checkpoints are regulators of the immune system response that allow self-tolerance. Molecules such as Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 (PD-1) and its Ligand (PD-L1) participate in the immune checkpoint by signaling co-inhibition of lymphocyte responses. In cancers, PD-L1 expression is associated with the immune evasion mechanism, which favors tumor growth. The use of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 drugs is already well described in solid tumors, but still not fully understood in hematologic malignancies. Myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDSs) are heterogeneous bone marrow disorders with an increased risk of progression to Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). The MDS affects hematopoietic stem cells and its pathogenesis is linked to genetic and epigenetic defects, in addition to immune dysregulation. The influence of the PD-L1 on the MDS remains unknown.
Methods
In this study, we evaluated the mRNA expression of the PD-L1 in 53 patients with MDS, classified according to the WHO 2016 Classification.
Results
Patients with dyserythropoiesis presented significantly higher PD-L1 expression than patients without dyserythropoiesis (p = 0.050). Patients classified as having MDS with an excess of blasts 2 (MDS-EB2) presented a significant upregulation in the mRNA expression of the PD-L1 compared to the MDS with an excess of blasts 1 (MDS-EB1) (p = 0.050). Furthermore, we detected three patients with very high levels of PD-L1 expression, being statistically classified as outliers.
Conclusion
We suggested that the high expression of the PD-L1 is associated with a worse prognosis in the MDS and functional studies are necessary to evaluate the possible use of anti-PD-L1 therapies for high-risk MDS, such as the MDS-EBs.

Abstract: Summary
COVID-19 has led to over 6.8 million deaths worldwide and continues to affect millions of people, primarily in low-income countries and communities with low vaccination coverage. Low-cost and rapid response technologies that enable accurate, frequent testing of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants are crucial for outbreak prevention and infectious disease control. Here we produce and characterize cellulose fibers naturally generated by the bacterium Gluconacetobacter hansenii as an alternative biodegradable substrate for manufacturing an eco-friendly diagnostic test for COVID-19. Using this green technology, we describe a novel and label-free potentiometric diagnostic test that can detect SARS-CoV-2 within 10 min and costs US$3.50 per unit. The test has bacterial cellulose (BC) as its substrate and a carbon-based electrode modified with graphene oxide and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) as its receptor. Our device accurately and precisely detects emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and demonstrates exceptional sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for tested clinical nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NP/OP) samples.

Abstract: Summary
Research efforts in various multitudes have been demonstrated to stabilize methylammonium (MA)- and bromide (Br)-free formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPI) perovskite thin films. Despite these commendable efforts, pure FAPI perovskite thin film is prone to critical phase-transition issues due to its thermodynamically stable non-perovskite phase (2H). Here, in this work, we propose a rational additivization strategy to overcome this challenge. Our multifunctional ammonium salt containing a sulfur heteroatom shifts the thermodynamic stability from the 2H phase to an intermediate phase closer to the cubic phase. Along with the high crystallinity, micron-sized grains with preferred (00h) facet orientation stem the Pb…S interaction to offer exceptional stability against high relative humidity, direct water incursion, and shelf-life aging. Our findings through experimental and theoretical studies substantiate the role of Pb…S interaction in stabilizing the perovskite cubic phase and the stoichiometric distribution of elemental components.

Abstract: Plant synaptotagmins (SYTs) are resident proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). They are characterized by an N-terminal transmembrane region and C2 domains at the C-terminus, which tether the ER to the plasma membrane (PM). In addition to their tethering role, SYTs contain a lipid-harboring SMP domain, essential for shuttling lipids between the ER and the PM. There is now abundant literature on Arabidopsis SYT1, the best-characterized family member, which link it to biotic and abiotic responses as well as to ER morphology. Here, we review the current knowledge of SYT members, focusing on their role in stress, and discuss how these roles can be related to their tethering and lipid transport functions. Finally, we contextualize this information about SYTs with their homologs, the yeast tricalbins and the mammalian extended synaptotagmins.

Abstract: Summary
Porous molecular crystals (PMCs) are solution-processable materials with promising applications in thin films and devices. However, some PMCs are only virtually porous, as their pores collapse when desolvated. We demonstrate the productive use of virtual porosity when non-volatile I2 guest acts as the probe. We prepared a series of cyclotetrabenzil hydrazones with progressively larger cavities. Their measured surface areas of up to 131 m2 g−1 are negligible compared with the values predicted from crystal structures. Nevertheless, they effectively capture I2 from aqueous and organic media and at the organic-aqueous interface, with capture capacities scaling with virtual void volumes. The pyridine-functionalized system is a notable outlier, engaging up to 21 I2 molecules and showing capture capacity of 4.15 g g−1, unprecedented among non-polymeric materials. These findings could impact the management of radioactive I2 and help in ensuring the integrity of protective coatings of nuclear reactors and waste containment vessels.

Abstract: Nuclear Dbf2-related (NDR) kinases are a subgroup of evolutionarily conserved AGC protein kinases that regulate various aspects of cell growth and morphogenesis. There are 4 NDR protein kinases in mammals, LATS1, LATS2 and STTK8/NDR1, STK38L/NDR2 protein kinases. LATS1 and 2 are core components of the well-studied Hippo pathway, which play a critical role in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and cell migration via YAP/TAZ transcription factor. The Hippo pathways play an important role in nervous tissue development and homeostasis, especially with regard to the central nervous system (CNS) and the ocular system. The ocular system is a very complex system generated by the interaction in a very tightly coordinated manner of numerous and diverse developing tissues, such as, but not limited to choroidal and retinal blood vessels, the retinal pigmented epithelium and the retina, a highly polarized neuronal tissue. The retina development and maintenance require precise and coordinated regulation of cell proliferation, cell death, migration, morphogenesis, synaptic connectivity, and balanced homeostasis. This review highlights the emerging roles of NDR1 and NDR2 kinases in the regulation of retinal/neuronal function and homeostasis via a noncanonical branch of the Hippo pathway. We highlight a potential role of NDR1 and NDR2 kinases in regulating neuronal inflammation and as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of neuronal diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Living organisms use functional gradients (FGs) to interface hard and soft materials (e.g., bone and tendon), a strategy with engineering potential. Past attempts involving hard (or soft) phase ratio variation have led to mechanical property inaccuracies because of microscale-material macroscale-property nonlinearity. This study examines 3D-printed voxels from either hard or soft phase to decode this relationship. Combining micro/macroscale experiments and finite element simulations, a power law model emerges, linking voxel arrangement to composite properties. This model guides the creation of voxel-level FG structures, resulting in two biomimetic constructs mimicking specific bone-soft tissue interfaces with superior mechanical properties. Additionally, the model studies the FG influence on murine preosteoblast and human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cell (hBMSC) morphology and protein expression, driving rational design of soft-hard interfaces in biomedical applications.

Abstract: Summary
Metamaterials have been extensively studied due to their exciting properties, broad physics, and promising applications covering a vast range of science and engineering. However, most metamaterials only focus on a single physical field rather than multiphysics fields, which limits their interdisciplinary applications, and existing multiphysics metamaterials usually have the same functions. Here, we propose general arbitrary-shape transformation multiphysics metamaterials (TMM) based on a discretion-and-assembly strategy. As proof-of-concept, we designed several arbitrary-shape TMMs to achieve the robust manipulation of heat and electric current for different combinations of cloaking/concentrating functions. The recipe of the general TMM includes coupling the multiphysics anisotropic parameters, offering a general strategy to fabricate metamaterials, endowing the shape flexibility, and enabling the functionality robustness. Our study offers a general way to design TMMs with anisotropic material properties and paves a new way to design multiphysics metamaterials across multiple disciplines.

Abstract: Introduction
Acute leukemias (ALs) are aggressive diseases that lead to death without medical attention. We evaluated the association between delays in diagnosis and poor outcomes in AL by evaluating the symptom onset to treatment intervals in adults with newly diagnosed AL and their effect on an early death (ED).
Methods
We assessed adults diagnosed with AL between 2015 and 2020 and evaluated baseline characteristics, the patient interval (PI), diagnostic interval (DI), treatment interval (TI) and the total time interval (TTI) to determine ED-associated factors.
Main results
We assessed 102 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 57 with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and 29 with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Median interval days were PI 14, DI 10, TI 4 and TTI 31.5. The TI and TTI intervals were lower in APL than in ALL and AML; TI 1 vs. 4 and 3 (p = 0.001) and TTI 21 vs. 31 and 35 (p = 0.016). The 30-day and 60-day EDs were 13.8% and 20.7%, mainly infections. ECOG > 2 (OR = 15.0) and PI < 7 days (OR = 4.06) were associated with 30-day ED; AML (OR = 2.69), high-risk (OR = 3.34), albumin < 3.5 g/dl (OR = 5) and platelets < 20 × 103/uL (OR = 2.71) with a 60-day ED.
Conclusion
None of the interval-delays were associated with an ED. Intervals seemed to be longer in patients without an ED, except for the TI, probably because of “the waiting time paradox.” Aggressive manifestations of disease may lead to shorter diagnostic intervals, but increased mortality.

Abstract: Summary
Thermal regulators are two-terminal devices used for passive temperature control of electronics, batteries, or buildings. Existing thermal expansion regulators suffer from large thicknesses and substantial hysteresis. Here we report an all-magnetic thermal regulator in which the temperature of the control terminal (Tcontrol) leads to passive steady-state surface mating/demating that enables/blocks heat conduction. The mechanism relies on Tcontrol-dependent magnetic forces between gadolinium and neodymium iron boron magnets when Tcontrol is near gadolinium’s Curie temperature of 21oC. Our centimeter-scale prototype has a thermal switch ratio of 34−13+30 in vacuum and 2.1−0.2+0.2 in air, a vacuum OFF state thermal conductance of 3.5 mW/K, an average switching temperature of 20oC, a small thermal deadband of 5oC, and a relatively compact thickness <2 cm. We quantify the regulator performance over >2,000 cycles and construct the regulator using commercially available materials, showing that this thermomagnetic device can be used for effective thermal regulation near room temperature.

Abstract: Summary
Blending two non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) to form bulk heterojunctions (BHJs) in ternary organic photovoltaics (OPVs) has been shown to lead to an end-capping exchange reaction that results in the generation of several new dipolar species whose impact on OPV operational stability remains uncertain. Here, we investigate the reliability of a ternary OPV system intentionally blended with dipolar NFA molecules. We reveal that an intrinsic contribution to OPV degradation is the reorganization and reorientation of the dipolar molecules during operation, which leads to an increased dielectric constant (εr) of the BHJ. Consequently, the electric field across the BHJ with dipolar molecules decreases compared with that of a non-dipolar BHJ under the same applied voltage, leading to a larger reduction in charge collection efficiency over time. This result has implications on the stability of a range of organic electronic devices containing dipolar molecules.

Abstract: Summary
Integration of natural woods and functional nanomaterials is emerging as sustainable nanotechnology. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), crystalline nanomaterials with pre-designable functional groups and inherent compatibility with wood, hold great promise in wood nanotechnology but remain challenging in fabrication. Here we report the interfacial synthesis of ionic COF composited woods (iCOFWs), in which the wood skeleton stores aqueous phase with ionic amine monomer and undertakes subsequent reaction with aldehyde monomer in the organic phase. The reactive nucleation is confined in the wood substrate by the aqueous-organic interface and generates high-crystalline ionic COFs (iCOFs) throughout the wood via covalent interaction. As a proof of concept, the iCOFW based on TpPa-SO3H displays ultrahigh lithium conductivity, physicochemical stability, and antimicrobial properties, which demonstrates applicability in an ionotronic device. Besides, this strategy shows scalability for mass production and versatility for different wood species and iCOFs, offering a powerful and sustainable platform for developing COF-based wood nanomaterials.

Abstract: Summary
While many state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been realized on rigid glass substrates, demonstrating perovskite cells on other types of surfaces may give rise to new applications. Here, we successfully demonstrate efficient PSCs on steel. The role of an indium tin oxide interlayer as a barrier against iron diffusion from the steel substrate is elucidated. We further show that the performance of the perovskite device on steel can be improved by using an n-octylammonium bromide passivation layer, achieving a power conversion efficiency of 17.1%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest reported for perovskite cells on steel. This work demonstrates the robust design necessary for PSCs on steel and the versatility of PSCs. It may also inspire work on other types of surfaces beyond glass, paving the way for a wider range of applications.

Abstract: Summary
Design and fabrication of sustainable cellulose-based ionogels with good mechanical properties have attracted increasing research interest; however, most current developed ionogels show limited processibility and functionality. Here, we report the development of tough and multifunctional ionogels by mixing nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC) into ionic liquid (IL), where the partial solvation of NCCs enables the formation of ionogels with varied NCC loadings. Partially solvated NCCs (PS-NCCs) have high-crystallinity domains offering rigidity, surrounded by cellulose chains enabling flexibility and energy dissipation. The NCC ionogel can achieve a high Young’s modulus (∼44 MPa), toughness (∼34 kJ m−2), and stretchability (∼870% strain), while also exhibiting thermal-triggered self-healing, stiffness transition, shape memory, and conductivity-changing properties. The NCC ionogels show their potential to work as multifunctional platforms for advanced applications, including grippers, temperature sensors, and three-dimensional printing. In addition, the IL in the ionogel is recyclable, and the ionogel can be degraded in natural environmental conditions, further enhancing its sustainability.

Abstract: Summary
Extended lifetime of lithium-ion batteries decreases economic costs and environmental burdens in achieving sustainable development. Cycle life tests are conducted on 18650-type commercial batteries, exhibiting nonlinear and inconsistent degradation. The accelerated fade dispersion is proposed to be triggered by the evolution of an additional potential of the anode during cycling as measured vs. Li+/Li. A method to prolong the battery cycle lifetime is proposed, in which the lower cutoff voltage is raised to 3 V when the battery reaches a capacity degradation threshold. The results demonstrate a 38.1% increase in throughput at 70% of their beginning of life (BoL) capacity. The method is applied to two other types of lithium-ion batteries. A cycle lifetime extension of 16.7% and 33.7% is achieved at 70% of their BoL capacity, respectively. The proposed method enables lithium-ion batteries to provide long service time, cost savings, and environmental relief while facilitating suitable second-use applications.

Abstract: The study aimed to identify essential phenotype-modulating factors among the pre-existence of several important ones and clarify their measurable impact on the clinical severity of hemoglobin (Hb) E/β-thalassemia in a community-recruited population analysis. This prospective study was designed to compare modifiers between community- (less or no symptoms) and hospital-recruited individuals with Hb E/β-thalassemia. The formerly included couples previously assessed for prenatal thalassemia at-risk status at 42 community and 7 referral hospitals in Thailand through on-site investigations between June 2020 and December 2021. The control included Hb E/β-thalassemia patients undergoing transfusions. The Mahidol score classified disease severity. Beta-globin, α0-thalassemia (-SEA, -THAI), α+-thalassemia (-α3.7, -α4.2), Hb Constant Spring (αCS) alleles, rs766432 in BCL11A, rs9399137 in HBS1L-MYB, and rs7482144-XmnI were evaluated. Modifiers were compared between 102 community- and 104 hospital-recruited cases. Alleles of β+, -SEA, -α3.7, αCS, and a minor allele of rs9399137 were prevalent in the community and mild severity groups (p < 0.05). Multiple linear regression analysis associated modulating alleles with −4.299 (-SEA), −3.654 (β+), −3.065 (rs9399137, C/C), −2.888 (αCS), −2.623 (‐α3.7), −2.361 (rs7482144, A/A), −1.258 (rs9399137, C/T), and −1.174 (rs7482144, A/G) severity score reductions (p < 0.05). Certain modifiers must be considered in routine prenatal genetic counseling for Hb E/β-thalassemia.

Abstract: Different studies corroborate a role for ceramide synthases and their downstream products, ceramides, in modulation of apoptosis and autophagy in the context of cancer. These mechanisms of regulation, however, appear to be context dependent in terms of ceramides’ fatty acid chain length, subcellular localization, and the presence or absence of their downstream targets. Our current understanding of the role of ceramide synthases and ceramides in regulation of apoptosis and autophagy could be harnessed to pioneer the development of new treatments to activate or inhibit a single type of ceramide synthase, thereby regulating the apoptosis induction or cross talk of apoptosis and autophagy in cancer cells. Moreover, the apoptotic function of ceramide suggests that ceramide analogues can pave the way for the development of novel cancer treatments. Therefore, in the current review paper we discuss the impact of ceramide synthases and ceramides in regulation of apoptosis and autophagy in context of different types of cancers. We also briefly introduce the latest information on ceramide synthase inhibitors, their application in diseases including cancer therapy, and discuss approaches for drug discovery in the field of ceramide synthase inhibitors. We finally discussed strategies for developing strategies to use lipids and ceramides analysis in biological fluids for developing early biomarkers for cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Grayscale masks have been applied in high-end stereolithography (SLA) 3D printers to spatially define the degree of photopolymerization and fabricate objects with graded properties. However, this approach cannot be applied in many commonly used projection SLA printers that can only handle 1-bit slices. Based on dithering techniques and image-processing algorithms, we develop a digital halftoning approach to generate universally printable files consisting only of black and white pixels arranged to mimic the “true” grayscale levels. Using this approach, any SLA printer can be used to control the irradiation dose and the degree of photopolymerization in each printed layer. As a proof of concept, we print various objects with graded properties using different commercial printers. This universal fabrication strategy will open a new window for engineers and scientists to explore grayscale SLA prints.

Abstract: The reinstatement of cancer immunosurveillance during cancer therapy is the sole means of achieving long term success with durable disease control and sometimes even cure. Induction of immunogenic cell death (ICD) by pharmacological or physical interventions such as anthracycline-based chemotherapy or ionizing irradiation, respectively, is a potent strategy for triggering immunological memory in immunocompetent mice. Thus, mice that were cured from syngeneic transplanted cancers were able to reject the same tumor cells several weeks after the eradication of the initial tumor, contrasting with the fact that antigenically distinct cells readily formed tumors. Here, we show how to harness sequential injections of antigenically identical or distinct cancer cells in immunocompetent animals to evaluate the generation of immunological memory.

Abstract: Introduction
Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) in a tumor environment and the expression of forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) in tumor cells have been associated with a poor prognosis. There are few studies evaluating Treg cells and FOXP3 in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-cell ALL). This study aimed to evaluate the frequencies of Treg cells in bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) of patients with B-cell ALL and to determine their associations with the circulating cytokine profile and the expression of CXCR1 (IL-8 receptor) in Treg cells, as well as to compare FOXP3 expression in blasts of patients with B-cell ALL and normal lymphoid precursors.
Methods
Samples of BM and PB from patients with B-cell ALL and healthy controls were studied. Treg cells, cytokines, FOXP3 and CXCR1 were evaluated using flow cytometry and analyzed.
Results
A total of 20 patients with B-cell ALL and 10 healthy controls were included. In B-cell ALL patients, Treg cell frequencies increased significantly, with higher percentages in the PB. Absolute Treg cell counts were associated with absolute blast counts in the BM and PB and with an IL-8 concentration. The IL-8 and IL-6 levels were associated with the CXCR1 expression in PB Treg cells. In addition, a greater expression of FOXP3 was observed in leukemic blasts than in normal lymphoid precursors.
Conclusions
These results suggest that the presence of Treg cells and cytokines in the tumor environment may correspond to mechanisms to evade the immune response. For that reason, it would be important to monitor these parameters in B-cell ALL to establish their effect on the disease prognosis.

Abstract: The development of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) like features is emerging as a critical factor involved in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). However, the extracellular signals and the signalling pathways in AML that may regulate EMT remain largely unstudied. We found that the bone marrow (BM) mesenchymal/fibroblastic cell line HS5 induces an EMT-like migratory phenotype in AML cells. AML cells underwent a strong increase of vimentin (VIM) levels that was not mirrored to the same extent by changes of expression of the other EMT core proteins SNAI1 and SNAI2. We validated these particular pattern of co-expression of core-EMT markers in AML cells by performing an in silico analysis using datasets of human tumours. Our data showed that in AML the expression levels of VIM does not completely correlate with the co-expression of core EMT markers observed in epithelial tumours. We also found that vs epithelial tumours, AML cells display a distinct patterns of co-expression of VIM and the actin binding and adhesion regulatory proteins that regulate F-actin dynamics and integrin-mediated adhesions involved in the invasive migration in cells undergoing EMT. We conclude that the BM stroma induces an EMT related pattern of migration in AML cells in a process involving a distinctive regulation of EMT markers and of regulators of cell adhesion and actin dynamics that should be further investigated. Understanding the tumour specific signalling pathways associated with the EMT process may contribute to the development of new tailored therapies for AML as well as in different types of cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Heterojunctions can increase the efficiency of solar cell devices relative to homojunctions, but there is a large parameter space with significant tradeoffs that must be considered. Here, we present an experimental and computational study of III-V heterojunction solar cells and show how the emitter doping, emitter band gap, and heteroband offsets impact device efficiency. Efficiency is maximized by pushing the junction depletion region into the wider band gap material while minimizing the effects of heteroband offsets through optimized choice of emitter band gap, emitter electron affinity, and/or emitter doping density. We use these results to guide optimization of devices grown by halide vapor phase epitaxy, achieving 27% efficiency in a GaAs/GaInPAs heterojunction device. We also show that heterojunctions yield proportionally larger efficiency improvements in lower-quality materials. Although the modeling was developed and validated using III-V materials, the results are theoretically applicable to materials systems outside III-Vs.

Abstract: Introduction
Treatment-free remission (TFR) is successful in half of the patients with chronic myeloid leukemia who discontinue Imatinib (IM) after sustained molecular response.
Methods
In a prospective trial, we used pioglitazone for 3 months before stopping IM in 30 patients. Percentages of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets were assessed before and after treatment. The relation of these data with duration of IM treatment and TRF were examined.
Results
The median time of IM treatment was 117.6 months. After discontinuation, 11 patients had molecular recurrence after 5.2 months (2.4 – 30). The observation time for those remaining in TFR was 46 (26 – 56) months. The independent factors for the maintenance of TFR were the duration of IM treatment and the percentage of double-positive T cells at IM stop.
Conclusion
A longer treatment with imatinib was associated with a longer TFR after discontinuation. Pioglitazone could act as an immunomodulator, increasing DP T cells which may contribute to prevent relapse.

Abstract: Summary
Algae have emerged as a promising sustainable energy source; however, efficient methods for generating electricity from algae are still lacking. In this study, power generation using large-scale flat-tube solid oxide fuel cells fueled with biosyngas from microwave-enhanced pyrolysis of algae is demonstrated. The power density of a cell fueled with biosyngas from laminaria is 379.8 mW/cm2 under 0.8 V at 750°C, which is approximately 91.7% of the density of a cell fueled with pure hydrogen. Fueled with dry syngas (laminaria), the cell fails within 3 h because of carbon deposition. Adding 5 vol % H2O to syngas (laminaria) inhibits carbon deposition and enables 800 h of galvanostatic operation without degradation under 200 mA/cm2 at 750°C. A 100-cycle pulsed operation of the cell with syngas (laminaria, 5 vol % H2O) under different loads, simulating practical scenarios with variable energy demands, is obtained. Based on the simulation results, the temperature fluctuations within the cell under different current densities are analyzed. Overall, this work advances practical efforts to improve solid oxide fuel cells for biosyngas consumption.

Abstract: Summary
Establishing formation ability descriptors is vital for accelerating the discovery and design of novel high-entropy carbides (HECs). However, very few studies have been reported so far. Here, we propose a combination of formation ability descriptors of HECs through high-throughput synthesis and calculation combined with the machine learning approach. Specifically, 91 HEC samples have been synthesized by the self-developed high-throughput ultrafast high-temperature synthesis apparatus, and 22 formation ability descriptors have been calculated by the high-throughput calculations simultaneously. Based on these results, eight formation ability descriptors are selected as the optimal combination to predict the phase formation of HECs through the machine learning method and the genetic algorithm. The validation accuracy of our established formation ability descriptors reaches 93.4%, at least 25.3% higher than that of previously reported ones. This study may provide theoretical guidance for discovering and designing novel HECs.

Abstract: Summary
Aluminum is the most earth-abundant metal, trivalent, and inert in ambient air; it also has a density approximately five times that of lithium at room temperature, making it attractive for cost-effective, long-duration storage in batteries. Here, we investigate structural requirements and physicochemical and transport properties of ionic liquid (IL) electrolytes thought to enable high reversibility of Al battery anodes. We find that intentionally designed, low-cost IL analogs, including ammonium-based molten salts, offer comparable Al anode reversibility to state-of-the-art imidazolium-based IL melts. A critical ratio of solvated Al-ion species is required to balance the effects of Lewis acidity needed to continuously etch native Al2O3 and form a stable solid electrolyte interphase on Al. Our findings open new opportunities for developing simple, cost-effective, room-temperature Al batteries that enable long-duration electrical energy storage.

Abstract: Summary
Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a formidable class of targeted biologics. Whereas all 11 Food and Drug Administration-approved ADCs are based on random conjugation, accumulating evidence suggests a potential for improved therapeutic index with site-specific ADCs. Here, we present a two-step sequential conjugation approach that marries the site specificity of the bacterial transglutaminase (TG) reaction with the robustness of Diels-Alder (DA) chemistry to generate stable antibody conjugates with favorable physiochemical properties. Further, we identify diene-based linkers with different reaction kinetics for DA coupling, and we use these linker derivatives to conjugate antibodies to two distinct small molecules in tandem. In addition, we show strong potency of antibody conjugates, prepared via TG-DA chemistry, in both cell-based assays and a mouse model. Overall our conjugation approach is site specific, versatile, and can potentially be used to generate different classes of antibody conjugates for multiple therapeutic areas.

Abstract: Summary
Dynamic deep learning is considered to simulate the nonlinear memory process of the human brain during long-term potentiation and long-term depression. Here, we propose a photoelectrically modulated synaptic transistor based on MXenes that adjusts the nonlinearity and asymmetry by mixing controllable pulses. According to the advantage of residual deep learning, the rule of dynamic learning is thus elaborately developed to improve the accuracy of a highly homologous database (colorimetric enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [c-ELISA]) from 80.9% to 87.2% and realize the fast convergence. Besides, mixed stimulation also remarkably shortens the iterative update time to 11.6 s as a result of the photoelectric effect accelerating the relaxation of ion migration. Finally, we extend the dynamic learning strategy to long short-term memory (LSTM) and standard datasets (Cifar10 and Cifar100), which well proves the strong robustness of dynamic learning. This work paves the way toward potential synaptic bionic retina for computer-aided detection in immunology.

Abstract: Summary
Methods for incorporating alkynes into molecular skeletons have been the subject of continued research. Compared to the cross-couplings used to form C–C(sp3) and C–C(sp2) bonds, couplings that form C–C(sp) bonds, particularly those catalyzed by nickel, remain less explored. In this study, we present a single nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling of terminal alkynes with aryl iodides or bromides for constructing C(sp2)–C(sp) bonds. Our method provides high functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope, resulting in good yields. This nickel-catalyzed coupling reaction is a straightforward way to prepare optoelectronic materials and key building blocks for chemical biology. Notably, our method displays decent selectivity when multi-halide-substituted arenes are used as substrates. Finally, a plausible mechanism is postulated based on experimental studies and density functional theory calculations.

Abstract: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), the most common genetic cause of infantile death, is caused by a mutation in the survival of motor neuron 1 gene (SMN1), leading to the death of motor neurons and progressive muscle weakness. SMN1 normally produces an essential protein called SMN. Although humans possess a paralogous gene called SMN2, ∼90% of the SMN it produces is non-functional. This is due to a mutation in SMN2 that causes the skipping of a required exon during splicing of the pre-mRNA. The first treatment for SMA, nusinersen (brand name Spinraza), was approved by the FDA in 2016 and by the EMU in 2017. Nusinersen is an antisense oligonucleotide-based therapy that alters the splicing of SMN2 to make functional full-length SMN protein. Despite the recent advancements in antisense oligonucleotide therapy and SMA treatment development, nusinersen is faced with a multitude of challenges, such as intracellular and systemic delivery. In recent years, the use of peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PPMOs) in antisense therapy has gained interest. These are antisense oligonucleotides conjugated to cell-penetrating peptides such as Pips and DG9, and they have the potential to address the challenges associated with delivery. This review focuses on the historic milestones, development, current challenges, and future perspectives of antisense therapy for SMA.

Abstract: Inherited deletions of upstream regulatory elements of α-globin genes give rise to α-thalassemia, which is an autosomal recessive monogenic disease. However, conventional thalassemia target diagnosis often fails to identify these rare deletions. Here we reported a family with two previous pregnancies of Hb Bart's hydrops fetalis and was seeking for prenatal diagnosis during the third pregnancy. Both parents had low level of Hemoglobin A2 indicating α-thalassemia. Conventional Gap-PCR and PCR-reverse dot blot showed the father carried –SEA deletion but did not identify any variants in the mother. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification identified a deletion containing two HS-40 probes but could not determine the exact region. Finally, a long-read sequencing (LRS)-based approach directly identified that the exact deletion region was chr16: 48,642-132,584, which was located in the α-globin upstream regulatory elements and named (αα)JM after the Jiangmen city. Gap-PCR and Sanger sequencing confirmed the breakpoint. Both the mother and fetus from the third pregnancy carried heterozygous (αα)JM, and the fetus was normally delivered at gestational age of 39 weeks. This study demonstrated that LRS technology had great advantages over conventional target diagnosis methods for identifying rare thalassemia variants and assisted better carrier screening and prenatal diagnosis of thalassemia.

Abstract: Pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) are critical to recognizing endogenous and exogenous threats to mount a protective proinflammatory innate immune response. PRRs may be located on the outer cell membrane, cytosol, and nucleus. The cGAS/STING signaling pathway is a cytosolic PRR system. Notably, cGAS is also present in the nucleus. The cGAS-mediated recognition of cytosolic dsDNA and its cleavage into cGAMP activates STING. Furthermore, STING activation through its downstream signaling triggers different interferon-stimulating genes (ISGs), initiating the release of type 1 interferons (IFNs) and NF-κB-mediated release of proinflammatory cytokines and molecules. Activating cGAS/STING generates type 1 IFN, which may prevent cellular transformation and cancer development, growth, and metastasis. The current article delineates the impact of the cancer cell-specific cGAS/STING signaling pathway alteration in tumors and its impact on tumor growth and metastasis. This article further discusses different approaches to specifically target cGAS/STING signaling in cancer cells to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis in conjunction with existing anticancer therapies.

Abstract: Summary
III-V materials enable the highest reported power conversion efficiency of any photovoltaic technology. The incorporation of high-quality nanostructures can tailor absorption to the available solar spectrum, allowing a further performance increase. Here we report a comprehensive study of the growth conditions of strain-balanced InGaAs quantum wells (QWs) incorporated into multijunction III-V photovoltaics by metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE). The fundamental growth mechanism leading to detrimental step-edge bunching in these devices is presented. Methods for mitigating step bunching through the composition of strain-balancing layers, growth temperature, and substrate offcut are shown. The addition of a distributed Bragg reflector, optically matched to the QW absorption region, extends the optical path of QWs, further increasing current generation to over 40 μA/cm2/QW. Results show a clear direction to mitigate voltage loss, enhance carrier collection, and lead to an impressive performance of 27.5% AM0 and 30.3% AM1.5G, two-junction QW solar cells.

Abstract: Introduction
Polycythaemia vera patients can present with arterial or venous vascular occlusive events such as thrombosis or cardiovascular disease; disease-related symptoms may significantly impact on the quality of life. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of erythrocytapheresis compared to phlebotomy in the treatment of polycythaemia patients.
Methods
This study reports the findings of a retrospective analysis of 40 polycythaemia vera patients diagnosed according to published guidelines and treated either with erythrocytapheresis or phlebotomy over a four-year period. The goal of treatment was to reduce blood volume and red blood cell count to near normal levels as both of which may attenuate the symptoms and complications associated with polycythaemia. Patients were treated by applying a mathematical model.
Results
Using the model, 28 erythrocytapheresis procedures were performed. Blood laboratory values (red blood cell count, haemoglobin count and haematocrit level) were significantly reduced in patients treated with erythrocytapheresis. Moreover, among treated patients, erythrocytapheresis resulted in less work absenteeism and reduced costs due to lost production, with a lower overall procedure cost in comparison to phlebotomy.
Conclusion
This model can assist in selecting the proper treatment modality for individual patients. Especially for those with high blood volumes and high achievable haematocrit levels (delta), erythrocytapheresis offers a more efficient method in red blood cell depletion compared to phlebotomy thereby, potentially reducing the number of treatment procedures required for the induction of polycythaemia vera patients as well as the interval between procedures during the maintenance phase.

Abstract: Summary
Biomass is an attractive source of renewable energy with the potential to help replace conventional fossil fuels, and efforts are being directed toward its utilization. Polysaccharide-based raw materials can be treated chemically or enzymatically to be further utilized as glucose, added-value chemicals, or fuel. While these industrial processes are well established, direct biomass conversion to pollution-free electrical power still needs to be developed. Herein, we present a biotic-abiotic model system that facilitates direct conversion of cellulosic material into electrical power. The photodriven electrochemical configuration operates under bias-free conditions to reach above 1 mW/cm2 and 1 V open-circuit voltage while coupled to an enzyme-based biocathode. To enable high photooxidation efficiency, a BiVO4-based photoanode is tailored to suppress undesired competing reactions, namely water oxidation, without affecting glucose-oxidation capabilities. The developed photo(bio)electrochemical cell presents a platform that may be utilized for the conversion of other environmental threat materials to electrical energy.

Abstract: Summary
Heavy-duty freight transportation, a key part of global transportation networks, is an energy-intensive contributor to growing CO2 emissions. Here, an onboard post-combustion capture and storage system is proposed for heavy-duty freight vehicles. Two state-of-the-art metal-organic frameworks with high CO2 selectivity and high storage capacity, respectively, are chosen. With high stability and selectivity toward CO2, even in humid conditions, KAUST-7 is the capturing material. Al-soc-MOF-1 is the storage material, given its high gravimetric and volumetric CO2 uptake between 10 and 50 bar. The goal of the system is to reduce heavy-duty vehicle CO2 emissions by at least 50% and achieve above 95% CO2 purity at the storage point. KAUST-7’s thermodynamic and kinetic properties are measured and modeled, and process conditions are simulated and optimized in response to dynamic engine behavior. Captured and stored mass and volume are also minimized, resulting in methods to mitigate carbon emissions in the heavy-duty freight industry.

Abstract: Summary
Lithium-ion battery safety evaluation covers a broad spectrum of abuse conditions. One of the popular testing methodologies is nail penetration. However, the reproducibility of nail penetration tests is rather poor, which compromises the credibility of the results. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of this low reproducibility is critical to provide design guidance and develop new testing protocols to accurately and quantitatively characterize battery safety. Here, a detailed computational model is first established to help understand the changes of each component within a cell upon nail penetration. Combined with a series of parametric experiments, the model assists with determining the factors governing reproducibility. Based on the results, it reveals that nail geometry, penetration speed, and cell support are dominant factors in reproducibility. The results lead to a better understanding of the low reproducibility mechanism of nail penetration tests, providing fundamental guidance on testing protocols and standards for battery safety.

Abstract: Introduction: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a common hemoglobinopathy worldwide that causes painful crises and hospitalization of patients. These attacks decrease survival and cause chronic end-organ damage in these patients. Hypothesis: For this reason, finding new treatment approaches could be helpful. Method: In this study, Imatinib was applied as a mast cell inhibitor to reduce pain crises in these patients. Seven patients resistant to hydroxyurea and folic acid treatment and who had at least four painful crises per year with hospitalization were enrolled in this study with treatment with Imatinib (100 mg, twice daily). Subsequently, the number and duration of hospitalizations, analgesic requirement, the severity of chronic pain, and changes in the hematological parameters of these patients were evaluated before and after the treatment. Results: The data showed that the total number of hospitalizations and the entire duration of hospitalizations were reduced 16 times after treatment with Imatinib, without apparent changes in hematological parameters. Also, the demand for pethidine, tramadol, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was reduced in all patients. The average reduction in chronic pain was over 70%. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that treatment with Imatinib in patients with SCD or sickle cell anemia (SCA) may be a suitable therapeutic option for reducing painful crises.

Abstract: Introduction
Despite knowledge advances on extramedullary haematopoiesis (EMH) in thalassemic patients, the real picture remains an open issue.
Objectives
To assess EMH prevalence in patients with thalassemia major (TM) and intermedia (TI), to describe magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and to explore clinical risk factors.
Methods
In this cross-sectional study, images and clinical records of 184 consecutive patients with thalassemia who underwent T2* MRI between 2004 and 2011 were reviewed. Association of EMH with survival was investigated for patients with available follow-up charts.
Results
EMH was detected in 16/168 (9.5%) patients with TM (aged 19-49 years) and in 3/16 (18.8%) with TI (aged 36-41 years). Most (88%) had paravertebral thoracic and/or abdominal masses. Age was significantly associated with EMH risk (hazard ratio, [HR] 1.10/year; confidence interval [CI]: 1.03-1.18; p-value < 0.001), while lower pancreatic iron content by T2*MRI (HR: 0.94/ms; CI: 0.89-0.99; p-value = 0.049) was a protective factor. Estimated survival rate was superior for EMH-positive (n = 19) when compared to EMH-negative patients (n = 75) (p-value = 0.013).
Conclusions
The prevalence of EMH was 10.3% (19/184), presented mainly as tumoral masses of 3 to 10 cm. Age was a risk factor for EMH development, while lower pancreatic iron might be a protective factor in this cohort.

Abstract: Summary
Enhancing performance, stability, and aesthetics is crucial for the development of transparent photovoltaics (TPV). In TPV, aesthetics are equally or even more important than performance because social acceptance requires maintaining aesthetics to a high level. In this work, we report a colorless hybrid electrolyte consisting of a thioate/iodide mixture. When integrated into wavelength-selective near-infrared-dye-sensitized solar cells (NIR-DSSCs), this electrolyte improves the power conversion efficiency (PCE) to up to 2.9% with a scattering layer and 2.1% in a transparent cell under AM1.5G conditions. It also reaches as high as 96% PCE retention over 1,800 h and confers an outstanding aesthetic level, up to 80% average visible transmittance (AVT), a color rendering index (CRI) of 96, and color purity as low as 14%, thus equaling the aesthetics of a double-glazed glass window.

Abstract: Summary
Connected/autonomous electric vehicles (C/AEVs) have the potential to provide safe, efficient, and low-carbon-emission transportation solutions. Proper and efficient management of the C/AEV lithium-ion battery (LIB) system is key to guaranteeing that all benefits associated with C/AEVs are achieved. This requires that the design and control of LIBs be informed by the C/AEV system operation. This article first demonstrates that C/AEV operation is distinct from human-driven electric vehicle operation, thus necessitating the development of application-specific testing protocols to properly characterize and model their LIBs. Laboratory-prone synthetic duty cycles are generated from C/AEV driving data, enabling a design of experiments representing a wide range of C/AEV driving modes and LIB system sizes. We share data collected from 31 LIB cells undergoing the synthetic cycling experiments. This paper provides the academic community with an application-specific C/AEV LIB dataset for the design and calibration of data-driven battery models for real-time control and operation.

Abstract: Summary
Although reductive elimination of two carbanions at a transition metal center to forge one C–C bond is a fundamental process, the analogous process is missing at a rare-earth metal center. Here, we report a reductive-elimination-type reaction of a dienyl anion and a benzyl anion at a rare-earth center enabled by redox metal-ligand cooperativity where the dienyl group serves as both the coupling partner and electron reservoir. Based on this discovery, we were able to establish the efficient rare-earth-mediated 1,4-hydroalkylation of benzylic C–H bonds of 2-substituted azaarenes across polysubstituted 1,3-diene units. The broad substrate scope, including functional groups incompatible with transition metals, demonstrates the generality of the process and its promising synthetic applications. The reductive-elimination-type reaction at the rare-earth center discovered here represents a new elementary reaction in rare-earth organometallic chemistry and is expected to inspire the general development of rare-earth-promoted cross-nucleophilic coupling.

Abstract: Summary
Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection, which is almost exclusively sexually transmitted, causes genital herpes. Although this lifelong and incurable infection is extremely widespread, currently there is no readily available diagnostic device that accurately detects HSV-2 antigens to a satisfactory degree. Here, we report an ultrasensitive electrochemical device that detects HSV-2 antigens within 9 min and costs just $1 (USD) to manufacture. The electrochemical biosensor is biofunctionalized with the human cellular receptor nectin-1 and detects the glycoprotein gD2, which is present within the HSV-2 viral envelope. The performance of the device is tested in a guinea pig model that mimics human biofluids, yielding 88.9% sensitivity, 100.0% specificity, and 95.0% accuracy under these conditions, with a limit of detection of 0.019 fg mL−1 for gD2 protein and 0.057 PFU mL−1 for titered viral samples. Importantly, no cross-reactions with other viruses were detected, indicating the adequate robustness and selectivity of the sensor. Our low-cost technology could facilitate more frequent testing for HSV-2.

Abstract: Small GTPases are highly regulated proteins that control essential signaling pathways through the activity of their effector proteins. Among the RHOA subfamily, RHOB regulates peculiar functions that could be associated with the control of the endocytic trafficking of signaling proteins. Here, we used an optimized assay based on tripartite split-GFP complementation to localize GTPase-effector complexes with high-resolution. The detection of RHOB interaction with the Rhotekin Rho binding domain (RBD) that specifically recognizes the active GTP-bound GTPase, is performed in vitro by the concomitant addition of recombinant GFP1–9 and a GFP nanobody. Analysis of RHOB-RBD complexes localization profiles combined with immunostaining and live cell imaging indicated a serum-dependent reorganization of the endosomal and membrane pool of active RHOB. We further applied this technology to the detection of RHO-effector complexes that highlighted their subcellular localization with high resolution among the different cellular compartments.

Abstract: Summary
The threat to global health posed by unpredictable infections and increasing antimicrobial resistance necessitates the urgent development of drug combination therapies (DCBs) for infectious diseases. Substantial efforts have been devoted to perfecting predictions for DCBs, but data scarcity and poor model interpretability continue to present significant barriers to the development of novel DCBs. To address these issues, here we propose a framework for predicting DCBs by combining knowledge graph representation learning and the technique of community discovery for complex networks. Within this framework, we demonstrate that multi-modal information and multiple types of DCBs could significantly facilitate the predictive performance and improve hit rates in realistic virtual screening scenarios. The high hit rate of 85% for experimental validation strongly supports the proposal that our approach could effectively harness useful information hidden in highly complex biological networks and accelerate in silico discovery of pairwise DCBs for infectious diseases and beyond.

Abstract: People hospitalized with COVID-19 often exhibit altered hematological traits associated with disease prognosis (e.g., lower lymphocyte and platelet counts). We investigated whether inter-individual variability in baseline hematological traits influences risk of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection or progression to severe COVID-19. We report inconsistent associations between blood cell traits with incident SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 in UK Biobank and the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Synthetic Derivative (VUMC SD). Since genetically determined blood cell measures better represent cell abundance across the lifecourse, we also assessed the shared genetic architecture of baseline blood cell traits on COVID-19 related outcomes by Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. We found significant relationships between COVID-19 severity and mean sphered cell volume after adjusting for multiple testing. However, MR results differed significantly across different freezes of COVID-19 summary statistics and genetic correlation between these traits was modest (0.1), decreasing our confidence in these results. We observed overlapping genetic association signals between other hematological and COVID-19 traits at specific loci such as MAPT and TYK2. In conclusion, we did not find convincing evidence of relationships between the genetic architecture of blood cell traits and either SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 hospitalization, though we do see evidence of shared signals at specific loci.

Abstract: Summary
Renewable energy storage provides a severe challenge for transitioning to a renewable energy economy. Power-to-methane technology, including the microbial electromethanogenesis (MEM) platform, reduces CO2 with electricity to methane, an energy-dense fuel with vast storage capacity and existing infrastructure. To exploit the full potential of MEM technology, efficient conversion of intermittent, otherwise curtailed, renewable electricity is essential. Thus, microorganisms need to respond rapidly to fluctuations in electricity supply while converting electrical energy into chemical energy. Here, we demonstrate that methanogens in a continuous MEM system resume methanogenesis rapidly after current interruptions and convert intermittent electricity to methane with high Coulombic efficiency (CE). For over 4 months, MEM converted intermittent current to methane with 90% average CE. Further, MEM converted California curtailed solar electricity profiles with >96% CE. Therefore, MEM could play a decisive role in a future integrated energy grid by converting excess renewable power into the storable, high-density fuel methane.

Abstract: Summary
Spin-orbit-torque (SOT)-driven perpendicular magnetization switching has attracted great attention for designing energy-efficient, high-density, and thermal-stable storage devices. As field-free deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization is not allowed in conventional heavy metals or topological insulators where spin polarization is limited to the in-plane direction, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) emerge as current spin platforms due to their low-crystal symmetries. However, present studies using TMDs are restricted to mechanically exfoliated samples with micron sizes and to low-temperature operation, which impede their practical applications. Here, based on large-scale, chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown, few-layer WTe2 thin films, the field-free switching at room temperature of the CoFeB/MgO heterostructure with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy is experimentally realized owing to unconventional SOTs in WTe2. Furthermore, we employ micromagnetic simulations to explore magnetization dynamics in the out-of-plane polarized spin’s presence. This work paves the way for constructing all-electrical, low-power spintronic devices based on two-dimensional TMDs.

Abstract: Introduction and Objective
Flow Cytometry (FC) is one of the techniques, which allows the identification and characterization of platelets. The detection of absent or reduced expression of the glycoproteins is the main objective of this technique. Abnormalities of glycoproteins lead to hemorrhagic syndromes. Among the main diseases, the Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS) and Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT) stand out. We aimed to show a FC-based platelet assessment test for diagnostic use, which measures the expression of markers in normal patients, and evaluate these markers in patients with platelet disorders.
Methods
We examined a control group of 41 healthy adults to establish reference values and assess the variability of the relative expression of platelet markers and subsequently compared these findings to those of 30 patients with suspected platelet dysfunctions. We determined the mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of the expressed parameters by FC using CD41, CD42a, CD42b and CD61 and SSC/FSC platelet-gated cells.
Results
We determined our baseline panel of markers and compared them to suspected platelet dysfunctions. Patients with suspected BSS presented increased levels of the MFI for the GPIIIa (CD61) and GPIIb (CD41). They showed significantly reduced levels of the GPIb (CD42b) and GPIX (CD42a). Patients with suspected GT showed normal expression of the GPIX (CD42a), increased expression of the GPIb (CD42b) and reduced levels of the GPIIIa (CD61). In this case, with reduced levels of only one marker, the GPIIb (CD41), values showed normal expression.
Conclusions
We describe the FC assay to support the diagnosis of different platelet disorders. Our study made it possible to implement a technique that brought benefits to care.

Abstract: Introduction
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most important hemoglobinopathy worldwide. The treatment often requires phenotype-matched red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, but alloimmunization to non-ABO antigens may occur in a part of the SCD patients. The genotyping has been used for RBC antigen prediction, reducing the possibility of the alloimmunization.
Objective and Method
In this study we performed the genotyping for the Kell and RHCE blood groups in samples from 77 phenotyped Brazilian SCD patients, whose alloimmunization profiles were also assessed.
Results
Discrepancies between genotyping and phenotyping for the RHCE and Kell blood groups systems were observed in 22.07% (17/77) of the SCD patients. We found C/c and E/e discrepancies in 11.68% and 9.09% of patients, respectively; one SCD patient (1.3%) presented a discrepancy in the Kell group. Two SCD patients with discrepancies between genotype and phenotype were alloimmunized. In total, twenty-eight patients (36.4%) developed alloantibodies, of which 55.17% were directed against antigens in the Rh system, 8.62% were directed against antigens in the Kell system and 36.20%, against other groups. Finally, the frequency of discrepancies is significantly higher in non-alloimmunized patients (30.61%), compared to alloimmunized patients (7.14%) (p = 0.0217).
Conclusion
In part, the alloimmunization of the SCD patients may have been triggered by these discrepancies, indicating that the integration of serological and molecular tests in the immunohematology routine could help to increase the transfusion safety. However, the higher number of alloimmunized patients without discrepancies showed that reasons other than the discrepancies appear to have influenced more strongly the alloimmunization in the SCD patients in this study.

Abstract: Summary
By targeting the ligand-binding pocket (LBP) and stabilizing the corresponding state (agonistic or antagonistic) of a nuclear receptor (NR), functional ligands, namely agonists and antagonists, can regulate the expression of the downstream genes. In addition to the functional ligands, there exists another category of ligands that can target the LBP of an NR, but without downstream functions, which are called non-functional binders (NFBs). In practice, it is difficult to determine the molecular category of an LBP-bound ligand since these molecules bind to the same position in an NR. Therefore, in this study, we propose a series of structure-based machine-learning (ML) models to better characterize the molecular category of the LBP-bound ligands. Our result shows that the best-performing model achieves good performance in predicting these molecules with an accuracy >0.85 and is robust enough to be applied in real-world tasks, such as identification of a ligand’s category targeting out-of-training-set (or external) NRs.

Abstract: Introduction
The aberrant expression of the inhibitor of DNA binding (ID1) gene has been frequently associated with the leukemogenesis and prognostication acute myeloid leukemia (AML), although its clinical importance has never been investigated in patients treated outside well-controlled clinical trials.
Methods
Using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, we investigated the role of the ID1 expression in the clinical outcomes of non-selected patients with acute myeloid leukemia treated in a real-life setting.
Results
Overall, 128 patients were enrolled. Patients with high ID1 expression had a lower 3-year overall survival (OS) rate of 9%, with the 95% confidence interval (95%CI) at 3 to 20%, compared to patients with a low ID1 expression (22%, 95%CI: 11 - 34%) (p = 0.037), although these findings did not retain significance after adjustment (hazard ratio (HR): 1.5, 95%CI: 0.98 - 2.28; p = 0.057). The ID1 expression had no impact on post-induction outcomes (disease-free survival, p = 0.648; cumulative incidence of relapse, p = 0.584).
Conclusions
Although we are aware thar our data are confronted with many variables that cannot be fully controlled, including drug unavailability, risk-adapted treatment, comorbidities and the time from diagnosis to treatment initiation, we are firm believers that such an initiative can provide more realistic data on understudied populations, in particular those from low- and middle-income countries.

Abstract: Summary
The power sector accounts for ∼40% of global energy-related CO2 emissions. Its decarbonization by switching to low-carbon renewables is essential for a sustainable future. Existing electrical grids, however, have limited capacity to absorb the variability introduced by these new energy sources and rely largely on natural-gas-based power generation. For deep decarbonization, alternative solutions to increase grid flexibility are needed. Among these, energy storage is expected to have a key role. This paper proposes a unique energy storage and re-conversion system by coupling the hydrogen combustion in supercritical CO2 (HYCOS) cycle, a zero-emission combustion cycle, with long-term/seasonal energy storage based on green H2 production. This power cycle is expected to be highly scalable and compact and can deliver power at net electrical efficiency between 55% and 60% at distributed generation levels. Thus, it can be highly competitive with existing solutions such as fuel cells, reciprocating engines, and gas turbines.

Abstract: Summary
Flexible sensors with high sensitivity and multifunctional integrated stimuli in the environment have been used in various applications. Here, we report the construction of a type of high-performance flexible photonic pressure sensor inspired by the principle of chameleon color change. The sensor is constructed based on a lens-shaped three-dimensional photonic crystal in combination with an alginate-based hydrogel. Low-pressure stimuli can lead to a slight change in the photonic band gaps that, consequently, cause the shifting of the maximal frequency and variation of the amplitude of reflective light. Ascribed to the substantially enlarged reflected spectra and the structural color shift, the sensor, with a diameter of 310 nm, exhibits an ultrahigh sensitivity of 32.2723 kPa−1, a peak shift of 30 nm, and a fast response time of 0.21 s. Furthermore, the density, sound velocity, and acoustic impedance of this conformally photonic sensor are matched with water. Therefore, this sensor provides a promising strategy for next-generation flexible photonic acoustic sensing devices.

Abstract: Podosomes have been known for several decades as micron-sized, F-actin-rich structures that play a pivotal role in cell migration and invasion, as they are able to mediate both cell-matrix attachment as well as extracellular matrix degradation. Particularly in monocytic cells, podosomes have been shown to fulfill a variety of additional functions such as sensing of substrate rigidity and topography, or cell-cell fusion. Increasing evidence now points to the involvement of podosome-like structures also during phagocytosis by immune cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils. Here, we compare the different cell models and experimental set ups where “phagocytic podosomes” have been described. We also discuss the composition and architecture of these structures, their potential involvement in mechanosensing and particle disruption, as well as the pros and cons for addressing them as bona fide podosomes.

Abstract: Summary
The introduction of paper and origami into industry and daily life has been a hallmark of human civilization. However, origami’s performance is limited by the properties of the constituent materials, including long-term bending, electrical, and thermal conductivity. Here, we report a new method for directly adhering liquid metal onto non-wetting substrates on a large scale, allowing for the regulation of the mechanical and electrical properties of the enhanced paper by controlling the applied force during fabrication. The mechanism of adhesion between different liquid metals (eGaIn and BiInSn) and non-wetting substrates through force is explained. Furthermore, multifunctional origami structures based on the enhanced paper can switch between several deformation modes and include a shape memory antenna for receiving and transmitting electromagnetic signals. This work offers a generalized approach to developing multifunctional paper for applications in wearable testing platforms, flexible devices, and soft robotics.

Abstract: Summary
A key challenge in upgrading bio-oils to renewable fuels and chemicals resides in developing effective and versatile hydrogenation systems. Herein, a two-step solar thermochemical hydrogenation process that sources hydrogen directly from water and concentrated solar radiation for furfural upgrading is reported. High catalytic performance is achieved at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, with up to two-orders-of-magnitude-higher hydrogen utilization efficiency compared with state-of-the-art catalytic hydrogenation. A metal or reduced metal oxide provides the active sites for furfural adsorption and water dissociation. The in situ-generated reactive hydrogen atoms hydrogenate furfural and biomass-derived oxygenates, eliminating the barriers to hydrogen dissolution and the subsequent dissociation at the catalyst surface. Hydrogenation selectivity can be conveniently mediated by solvents with different polarity and metal/reduced metal oxide catalysts with varying oxophilicity. This work provides an efficient and versatile strategy for bio-oil upgrading and a promising pathway for renewable energy storage.

Abstract: The biological and clinical significance of aberrant clonal expansions in aged tissues is being intensely discussed. Evidence is accruing that these clones often result from the normal dynamics of cell turnover in our tissues. The aged tissue microenvironment is prone to favour the emergence of specific clones with higher fitness partly because of an overall decline in cell intrinsic regenerative potential of surrounding counterparts. Thus, expanding clones in aged tissues need not to be mechanistically associated with the development of cancer, albeit this is a possibility. We suggest that growth pattern is a critical phenotypic attribute that impacts on the fate of such clonal proliferations. The acquisition of a better proliferative fitness, coupled with a defect in tissue pattern formation, could represent a dangerous mix setting the stage for their evolution towards neoplasia.

Abstract: Ineffective erythropoiesis is the main cause of anemia in β-thalassemia. The crucial hallmark of ineffective erythropoiesis is the high proliferation of erythroblast. microRNA (miR/miRNA) involves several biological processes, including cell proliferation and erythropoiesis. miR-101 was widely studied and associated with proliferation in several types of cancer. However, the miR-101-3p has not been studied in β-thalassemia/HbE. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the expression of miR-101-3p during erythropoiesis in β-thalassemia/HbE. The results showed that miR-101-3p was upregulated in the erythroblast of β-thalassemia/HbE patients on day 7, indicating that miR-101-3p may be involved with high proliferation in β-thalassemia/HbE. Therefore, the mRNA targets of miR-101-3p including Rac1, SUB1, TET2, and TRIM44 were investigated to determine the mechanisms involved with high proliferation of β-thalassemia/HbE erythroblasts. Rac1 expression was significantly reduced at day 11 in severe β-thalassemia/HbE compared to normal controls and mild β-thalassemia/HbE. SUB1 gene expression was significantly lower in severe β-thalassemia/HbE compared to normal controls at day 9 of culture. For TET2 and TRIM44 expression, a significant difference was not observed among normal and β-thalassemia/HbE. However, the high expression of miR-101-3p at day 7 and these target genes was not correlated, suggesting that this miRNA may regulate ineffective erythropoiesis in β-thalassemia/HbE via other target genes.

Abstract: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by the destruction of pancreatic β-cells, leading to insulin deficiency. Insulin replacement therapy is the current standard of care for T1D, but it has significant limitations. However, stem cell-based replacement therapy has the potential to restore β-cell function and achieve glycaemic control eradicating the necessity for drugs or injecting insulin externally. While significant progress has been made in preclinical studies, the clinical translation of stem cell therapy for T1D is still in its early stages. In continuation, further research is essentially required to determine the safety and efficacy of stem cell therapies and to develop strategies to prevent immune rejection of stem cell-derived β-cells. The current review highlights the current state of cellular therapies for T1D including, different types of stem cell therapies, gene therapy, immunotherapy, artificial pancreas, and cell encapsulation being investigated, and their potential for clinical translation.

ING1 inhibits Twist1 expression to block EMT and is antagonized by the HDAC inhibitor vorinostat,

Abstract: ING1 is a chromatin targeting subunit of the Sin3a histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex that alters chromatin structure to subsequently regulate gene expression. We find that ING1 knockdown increases expression of Twist1, Zeb 1&2, Snai1, Bmi1 and TSHZ1 drivers of EMT, promoting EMT and cell motility. ING1 expression had the opposite effect, promoting epithelial cell morphology and inhibiting basal and TGF-β-induced motility in 3D organoid cultures. ING1 binds the Twist1 promoter and Twist1 was largely responsible for the ability of ING1 to reduce cell migration. Consistent with ING1 inhibiting Twist1 expression in vivo, an inverse relationship between ING1 and Twist1 levels was seen in breast cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The HDAC inhibitor vorinostat is approved for treatment of multiple myeloma and cutaneous T cell lymphoma and is in clinical trials for solid tumours as adjuvant therapy. One molecular target of vorinostat is INhibitor of Growth 2 (ING2), that together with ING1 serve as targeting subunits of the Sin3a HDAC complex. Treatment with sublethal (LD25-LD50) levels of vorinostat promoted breast cancer cell migration several-fold, which increased further upon ING1 knockout. These observations indicate that correct targeting of the Sin3a HDAC complex, and HDAC activity in general decreases luminal and basal breast cancer cell motility, suggesting that use of HDAC inhibitors as adjuvant therapies in breast cancers that are prone to metastasize may not be optimal and requires further investigation.

Abstract: Abstarct
Introduction
The treatment of elderly multiple myeloma (MM) patients with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is a controversial procedure. Most clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of ASCT have primarily included patients younger than 65 years.
Design and methods
This was a retrospective analysis of patients with MM who underwent ASCT between 2008 and 2018. Patients at or over 65 years were compared with patients under 65 years. We analyzed treatment-related mortality (TRM), response rate, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
Results
Two hundred and twenty-one patients were included: 50 patients at or over 65 years, (median age 68 years), including 7 patients over 70 years and 151 patients under 65 years, (median age 57 years). No differences were found in the neutrophil and platelet engraftment, median days of hospitalization and life support requirement during the hospitalization period for the ASCT. No statistically significant differences were found in the incidence of TRM between both groups at 100 days post-transplant (2% vs. 2.9%, p = 0.322). The ASCT improved complete response and stringent complete response rates (44% vs. 37%, p < 0.001). Survival was not modified by age: after a median follow-up of 53 months, the estimated PFS rates at three years were 63% and 60% (p = 0.88) and the OS rates at five years were 75% and 74% (p = 0.72), respectively.
Conclusions
Our data suggest that the ASCT is feasible in selected elderly patients with MM over 65 years of age, achieving response and survival rates similar to those of younger patients.

Abstract: Introduction
A reduced platelet count (PLT) is a frequent post-operative finding in orthopedic surgery patients. Despite its prevalence, the characteristics of post-surgical thrombocytopenia have not been well described.
Methods
A retrospective chart review was conducted on patients who underwent a knee or hip replacement from 2012 to 2015. Patients who received heparin were excluded.
Results
A total of 56 patients were analyzed on post-operative days 0 to 4. By day 1, 90.9% of the patients experienced a reduction in their platelet counts. The lowest mean platelet count (nadir) occurred on day 2 (201.3 × 109/L). The average decrease in the platelet count from the baseline was 24% (95%CI: 20.6 - 27.2). The change in the platelet count from the baseline ranged from a 49.6% drop to a 14.2% increase. A substantial portion of patients experienced thrombocytopenia, with 28% occurring on day 2. Platelet counts less than 100 × 109/L occurred only once. The percent decrease in the platelet count from the baseline to any other time point was significantly larger in patients aged > 65 years, compared to patients aged ≤ 65 years (p = 0.007). Specifically, the average drop in the platelet count at the nadir (day 2) relative to the baseline was 27.8% in patients aged > 65 years, compared to 19.5% in patients aged ≤ 65 years.
Conclusions
A reduction in the platelet count is a frequent post-operative finding in orthopedic surgery patients, even after removing confounding factors, such as heparin exposure, but clinical thrombocytopenia is uncommon. Alternative etiologies should be considered when the platelet count is less than 100 × 109/L. Vigilance should also be considered regarding elderly patients.

Abstract: Summary
Cryoprotectants are vital to ensuring that biological tissue can survive liquid nitrogen exposure during cryopreservation and subsequent warming. The fundamental interaction between cryoprotectants, cells, and shoot tips is an understudied area, and the exact mechanism for protection remains elusive. By coupling coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering microscopy with bright-field microscopy, we determine how quickly the widely used cryoprotectants dimethyl sulfoxide, ethylene glycol, and glycerol permeate living rice (Oryza sativa) callus cells and how this permeation correlates with cellular responses. Some cellular responses observed with bright-field microscopy, such as plasmolysis and deplasmolysis, occur in response to cryoprotectant permeation. The observational results from the combination of bright-field and coherent anti-Stokes Raman microscopy reported here show that cryoprotectant permeation occurs before the end of plasmolysis and well before the end of deplasmolysis. Further, cryoprotectants permeate cells where there is no apparent plasmolysis and deplasmolysis. Overall, cell response times are substantially longer than permeation times.

Abstract: Summary
High-energy-density nickel (Ni)-rich cathode materials are used in commercial lithium (Li)-ion batteries for electric vehicles, but they suffer from severe structural degradation upon cycling. Planar gliding and microcracking are seeds for fatal mechanical fracture, but their origin remains unclear. Herein, we show that “layer-by-layer delithiation” is activated at high voltages during the charge process when the “lattice collapse” (a characteristic high-voltage lattice evolution in Ni-rich cathodes) occurs. Layer-by-layer delithiation is evidenced by direct observation of the consecutive lattice collapse using in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The collapsing of the lattice initiates in the expanded planes and consecutively extends to the whole crystal. Localized strain will be induced at lattice-collapsing interface where planar gliding and intragranular microcracks are generated to release this strain. Our study reveals that layer-by-layer delithiation during lattice collapse is the fundamental origin of the mechanical instability in single-crystalline Ni-rich cathodes.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of paramagnetic systems is an advancing field that contributes to characterization of the structure and magnetism of molecules, molecular assemblies, biomolecules, and materials. In this account, we utilize the hyperfine field intrinsic to ruthenium(III) coordination compounds to uncover details of their supramolecular host-guest binding with cyclodextrins. We interpret perturbations of the 1H NMR shifts of the host to suggest the binding mode of the interaction. We demonstrate how the size of the cyclodextrin cavity and the structural modification of the guest affect whether the binding occurs through a head or tail portal of the cyclodextrin and attempt to explain the observed differences in terms of molecular shapes and the charge-distribution complementarity between the host and guest. Paramagnetic NMR spectroscopy of host-guest systems is shown to be a useful tool for supramolecular and structural chemists investigating modes of molecular encapsulation.

Abstract: Summary
Advancements in thermoelectric performance are confronting challenges because of the coupling of thermoelectric properties. Therefore, it is crucial to design feasible strategies to disrupt this intrinsic coupling while concurrently optimizing the transport of both charge carriers and phonons. This study illustrates the potential of morphological disorder for thermoelectric decoupling by a graphene film (GF) with controllable morphology. A successful decoupling triggered by rising temperature leading to an increase in both the Seebeck coefficient (S) and the electrical conductivity (σ) has been achieved in crystalline GF by creating a disordered micromorphology (a-GF). Fundamentally, morphological disorder supports a temperature-controllable density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level (Ef) by adjusting the weak localization (WL) and the electron-electron interaction (EEI). Simultaneously, a temperature-independent thermal conductivity (k) was obtained in a-GF, attributed to defect phonon scattering rather than electron-phonon interaction. This research provides evidence for the beneficial impact of disordered morphology on thermoelectric decoupling and proposes a promising direction for the optimization of polycrystalline thermoelectric materials.

Abstract: Summary
Metal-halide perovskites deposited by wet-chemical deposition have demonstrated great potential for various electronic applications, including solar cells. A remaining question is how light-induced excess charges become distributed over such polycrystalline material. Here, we examine the local conductive properties of MAPbI3 and CsFAPbI3 by using scanning microwave microscopy (sMIM) in the dark and light. sMIM is an atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based technique measuring variations of the in-phase and out-of-phase signals due to changes in the tip-sample interaction, yielding MIM-Re and MIM-Im images, respectively. Combining this information leads to a picture for CsFAPbI3 in which excess charges are distributed evenly over the grains, but due to local defect-rich areas, possibly related to different crystal facets, local perturbations in carrier concentration exist. For solar cells, this distribution in carrier concentration under illumination leads to variation in the local Fermi level splitting, which should be suppressed to reduce the voltage deficit.

Abstract: Dendritic spines form the postsynaptic compartment of most excitatory synapses in the vertebrate brain. Morphological changes of dendritic spines contribute to major forms of synaptic plasticity such as long-term potentiation (LTP) or depression (LTD). Synaptic plasticity underlies learning and memory, and defects in synaptic plasticity contribute to the pathogeneses of human brain disorders. Hence, deciphering the molecules that drive spine remodeling during synaptic plasticity is critical for understanding the neuronal basis of physiological and pathological brain function. Since actin filaments (F-actin) define dendritic spine morphology, actin-binding proteins (ABP) that accelerate dis-/assembly of F-actin moved into the focus as critical regulators of synaptic plasticity. We recently identified cyclase-associated protein 1 (CAP1) as a novel actin regulator in neurons that cooperates with cofilin1, an ABP relevant for synaptic plasticity. We therefore hypothesized a crucial role for CAP1 in structural synaptic plasticity. By exploiting mouse hippocampal neurons, we tested this hypothesis in the present study. We found that induction of both forms of synaptic plasticity oppositely altered concentration of exogenous, myc-tagged CAP1 in dendritic spines, with chemical LTP (cLTP) decreasing and chemical LTD (cLTD) increasing it. cLTP induced spine enlargement in CAP1-deficient neurons. However, it did not increase the density of large spines, different from control neurons. cLTD induced spine retraction and spine size reduction in control neurons, but not in CAP1-KO neurons. Together, we report that postsynaptic myc-CAP1 concentration oppositely changed during cLTP and cTLD and that CAP1 inactivation modestly affected structural plasticity.

Abstract: Introduction
Dengue is the most fatal virus disease spread by mosquito bites and Aedes aegypti is the main transmitting agent. It is an endemic disease in the tropical and subtropical regions, currently affecting more than 100 countries. Although most patients present mild forms of the disease, a considerable proportion of individuals has severe alterations in the blood count. The aim of this study was to evaluate the consumption pattern of blood components in epidemic and non-epidemic periods and to verify if there was an impact on dengue cases and the death rate.
Method
This is a retrospective cross-sectional study conducted through the collection and analysis of data from the Brazilian Ministry of Health from 2008 to 2019 on new cases and deaths from dengue, as well as the consumption of blood components in the period mentioned by hemovigilance bulletins of the Brazilian authority.
Results
Regarding the results, no significant difference was found between the absolute amount of blood components used in years with an epidemic peak. Regarding the relative values, an important variation was shown among the distributive consumption patterns of blood components in the outbreak years. In the univariate linear regression analysis, there was statistical significance between the increase in the number of dengue cases and deaths from dengue with the increase in the consumption of red blood cell concentrates (RBP), platelet concentrates (PP), fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and cryoprecipitate (Cryo) (p-value < 0.05). The increase in dengue cases was related to the increase in Cryo consumption with clinical significance (R² > 0.5), but dengue deaths were not correlated to the same. In multivariate analysis, all regression models had clinical and statistical significance.
Conclusion
The data obtained in the present study demonstrate that there is a relevant relationship between the increase in cases and deaths from dengue with the blood components usage, especially PP, FFP and cryoprecipitate.
