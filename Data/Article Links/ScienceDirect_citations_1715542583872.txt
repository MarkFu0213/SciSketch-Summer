Abstract: Traumatic optic neuropathy results in the loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), leading to unavoidable visual impairment. However, there is no effective therapy by far. Accumulated studies support the perception that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) secrete exosomes that serve as a protective paracrine factor. The study aimed to explore and evaluate the potential therapeutic effects of intravitreal transplantation of MSC-derived exosomes (MSC-exos) in an experimental model of optic nerve crush (ONC). Exosomes were isolated from rat MSCs and characterized by transmission electron microscope and western blotting. At the onset of ONC, a single intravitreal injection of exosomes or PBS was administered to the rats. At day 30, hematoxylin and eosin staining, immunohistochemistry, and βIII-tubulin staining were performed to evaluate the survival of RGCs. Moreover, TUNEL assay was used to examine the apoptosis of RGCs. Inflammation-relevant factors were identified via quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The expression levels of cell apoptosis-related molecules and key members of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway were determined via western blot analysis. We found that MSC-exos exhibited typical characteristic morphologies (cup-shaped) and sizes (peak size of 93 nm). Furthermore, they exhibited substantial expression of the exosome markers CD63 and TSG101, but lacked the expression of the cellular marker GM130. Treatment with intravitreal MSC-exos notably promoted the survival of RGCs in ONC rats. The level of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1, were reduced, whereas those of the anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 were increased. Moreover, the apoptosis induced by ONC was decreased by the administration of MSC-exos via upregulation of the Bcl-2/Bax ratio and downregulation of caspase-3 activity. Furthermore, MSC-exos significantly stimulated AKT phosphorylation, whereas LY294002 restored the apoptosis-preventing effects of MSC-exos. The results of our results demonstrated that intravitreal administration of MSC-exos ameliorates ONC-induced injury in a rat model. These findings might aid in the development of effective exosome-based therapeutic strategies for the treatment of optic nerve degeneration.

Abstract: Insulin, as a growth factor, can increase the risk of certain types of cancer. The present study showed that insulin promoted the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo through pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), which is a rate-limiting enzyme in the process of glycolysis. Moreover, the expression of PKM2 was up-regulated by insulin at the posttranslational level in a nuclear orphan receptor TR3-dependent manner. In addition, insulin could enhance the interaction between PKM2 and TR3 and protect PKM2 from degradation. Our results identified a specific mechanism of insulin affecting cancer metabolism and thus promoting cancer progression, and they contribute to a better understanding of the observation that insulin is linked to an increased cancer risk under hyperinsulinemic conditions.

Abstract: Our previous that HMMR upregulation independently predicts poor survival in patients with papillary muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). In this study, we explored its downstream regulations and the potential transcriptional factors activating its expression. MIBC derived T24 cells, and non-MIBC (NMIBC) derived RT4 cells were used for in vitro and in vivo studies. HMMR expression enhanced cell proliferation, the expression of mesenchymal markers, and cell invasion. It induced the nuclear entry of β-catenin, increased its active form in the nuclear part, and elevated the relative TOP/FOP activity. The promoter region of HMMR has a canonical FKH motif. FOXM1 bound to this site and activated HMMR transcription. HMMR knockdown significantly weakened FOXM1 overexpression induced bladder cancer growth, invasion, partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (pEMT), as well as the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In conclusion, the findings in this study expanded our understanding of the mechanisms underlying HMMR dysregulation and the functional role of the FOXM1-HMMR axis in bladder cancer.

Abstract: Protein kinases of both the parasite and the host are crucial in parasite invasion and survival and might act as drug targets against drug-resistant malaria. STK35L1 was among the top five hits in kinome-wide screening, suggesting its role in malaria's liver stage. However, the role of host STK35L1 in malaria remains elusive. In this study, we found that STK35L1 was highly upregulated during the infection of Plasmodium berghei (P. berghei) in HepG2 cells and mice liver, and knockdown of STK35L1 remarkably suppressed the sporozoites' infection in HepG2 cells. We showed that STAT3 is upregulated and phosphorylated during P. berghei sporozoites' infection, and STAT3 activation is required for both the upregulation of STK35L1 and STAT3. Furthermore, we found that ten cell cycle genes were upregulated in the sporozoite-infected hepatocytes. Knockdown of STK35L1 inhibited the basal expression of these genes except CDKN3 and GTSE1 in HepG2 cells. Thus, we identified STK35L1 as a host kinase that plays an obligatory role in malaria's liver stage and propose that it may serve as a potential drug target against drug-resistant malaria.

Abstract: Although the incidence rates of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) associated with human papilloma virus (HPV) infection have recently been on the rise, the underlying mechanism of its tumorigenesis remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated whether HNSCC cells with high expression of integrin alpha 6 (ITGα6), one of the HPV receptors, have a preference during HPV infection. In addition, we examined the gain or loss of function of the ITGα6 gene in HPV + ve HNSCC cells, as well as its prognostic value in patients with HNSCC. HPV pseudovirus was found to be more infective, with HNSCC cells featuring an overexpressed ITGα6 gene compared to the control cells. Overexpression and suppression of ITGα6 respectively increases and decreases stemness phenotypes of HPV + ve HNSCC cells. Furthermore, ITGα6 can regulate stemness by partially mediating AKT pathway in HPV + ve HNSCC cells. Finally, patients with HPV + ve HNSCC had a poor prognosis in cases of elevated ITGα6 expression; however, the expression levels of ITGα6 did not influence the survival rates of HPV-negative HNSCC patients. In conclusion, ITGα6 can serve as a potential therapeutic target for HPV + ve HNSCC cancer-like stem cells (CSCs).

Abstract: Summary
Advances in single-cell RNA sequencing have allowed for the identification of cellular subtypes on the basis of quantification of the number of transcripts in each cell. However, cells might also differ in the spatial distribution of molecules, including RNAs. Here, we present DypFISH, an approach to quantitatively investigate the subcellular localization of RNA and protein. We introduce a range of analytical techniques to interrogate single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) data in combination with protein immunolabeling. DypFISH is suited to study patterns of clustering of molecules, the association of mRNA-protein subcellular localization with microtubule organizing center orientation, and interdependence of mRNA-protein spatial distributions. We showcase how our analytical tools can achieve biological insights by utilizing cell micropatterning to constrain cellular architecture, which leads to reduction in subcellular mRNA distribution variation, allowing for the characterization of their localization patterns. Furthermore, we show that our method can be applied to physiological systems such as skeletal muscle fibers.

Abstract: Summary
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has affected more than 185 million people worldwide resulting in over 4 million deaths. To contain the pandemic, there is a continued need for safe vaccines that provide durable protection at low and scalable doses and can be deployed easily. Here, AAVCOVID-1, an adeno-associated viral (AAV), spike-gene-based vaccine candidate demonstrates potent immunogenicity in mouse and non-human primates following a single injection and confers complete protection from SARS-CoV-2 challenge in macaques. Peak neutralizing antibody titers are sustained at 1 year and complemented by functional memory T cell responses. The AAVCOVID vector has no relevant pre-existing immunity in humans and does not elicit cross-reactivity to common AAVs used in gene therapy. Vector genome persistence and expression wanes following injection. The single low-dose requirement, high-yield manufacturability, and 1-month stability for storage at room temperature may make this technology well suited to support effective immunization campaigns for emerging pathogens on a global scale.

Abstract: Summary
Fibrosing chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a debilitating complication of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). A driver of fibrosis is the kynurenine (Kyn) pathway, and Kyn metabolism patterns and cytokines may influence cGVHD severity and manifestation (fibrosing versus gastrointestinal [GI] cGVHD). Using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry approach on sera obtained from 425 patients with allografts, we identified high CXCL9, high indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) activity, and an activated Kyn pathway as common characteristics in all cGVHD subtypes. Specific Kyn metabolism patterns could be identified for non-severe cGVHD, severe GI cGVHD, and fibrosing cGVHD, respectively. Specifically, fibrosing cGVHD was associated with a distinct pathway shift toward anthranilic and kynurenic acid, correlating with reduced activity of the vitamin-B2-dependent kynurenine monooxygenase, low vitamin B6, and increased interleukin-18. The Kyn metabolite signature is a candidate biomarker for severe fibrosing cGVHD and provides a rationale for translational trials on prophylactic vitamin B2/B6 supplementation for cGVHD prevention.

Abstract: Summary
The compounding challenges of low signal, high background, and uncertain targets plague many metagenomic sequencing efforts. One solution has been DNA capture, wherein probes are designed to hybridize with target sequences, enriching them in relation to their background. However, balancing probe depth with breadth of capture is challenging for diverse targets. To find this balance, we have developed the HUBDesign pipeline, which makes use of sequence homology to design probes at multiple taxonomic levels. This creates an efficient probe set capable of simultaneously and specifically capturing known and related sequences. We validated HUBDesign by generating probe sets targeting the breadth of coronavirus diversity, as well as a suite of bacterial pathogens often underlying sepsis. In separate experiments demonstrating significant, simultaneous enrichment, we captured SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 in a human RNA background and seven bacterial strains in human blood. HUBDesign (https://github.com/zacherydickson/HUBDesign) has broad applicability wherever there are multiple organisms of interest.

Abstract: Aberrant expression of meiosis-specific genes in cancer has recently emerged as a driver of some cancer formation. Aurora kinase C (AURKC) is a member of the Aurora kinase family of proteins known to regulate chromosome segregation during cell divisions. AURKC is normally expressed in meiotic cells; however, elevated levels of AURKC mRNA and protein are frequently measured in cancer cells. To understand the function of AURKC in cancer cells, expression was induced in noncancerous, human retina pigmented epithelial cells. While AURKC expression did not alter cell proliferation over 72 h, it did increase cell migration and anchorage independent growth in soft agar suggesting an oncogenic role in mitotically dividing cells. To evaluate AURKC as a potential therapeutic target, a frameshift mutation in the gene was introduced in U2OS osteosarcoma cells using CRISPR-Cas9 technology resulting in a premature stop codon. Cancer cells lacking AURKC displayed no change in cell proliferation over 72 h but did migrate less and formed fewer colonies in soft agar. Whole transcriptome sequencing analysis uncovered over 400 differentially expressed genes in U2OS cells with and without AURKC. GO analysis revealed alterations in proteinaceous extracellular matrix genes including COL1A1. These data indicate that therapeutics targeting AURKC could decrease cancer cell metastasis and disease progression. Because AURKC is transcriptionally silenced in normal mitotic cells, its disruption could specifically target cancer cells limiting the toxic side effects associated with current therapeutics.

Abstract: Astrocytes are essential to brain homeostasis and their dysfunction can have devastating consequences on human quality of life. Such deleterious effects are generally due in part to changes that occur at the cellular level, which may be biochemical or biomechanical in nature. One biomechanical change that can occur is a change in tissue stiffness. Brain tumors are generally associated with increased brain tissue stiffness, but the impact increased tissue stiffness has on astrocyte biomechanical behavior is poorly understood. Therefore, in this study we cultured human astrocytes on flexible substrates with stiffness that mimicked the healthy human brain (1 kPa), meningioma (4 kPa), and glioma (11 kPa) and investigated astrocyte biomechanical behavior by measuring cell-substrate tractions, strain energies, cell-cell intercellular stresses, and cellular velocities. In general, tractions, intercellular stresses, and strain energy was observed to increase as a function of increased substrate stiffness, while cell velocities were observed to decrease with increased substrate stiffness. We believe this study will be of great importance to the fields of brain pathology and brain physiology.

Abstract: Summary
Functional profiling of a cancer patient’s tumor cells holds potential to tailor personalized cancer treatment. Here, we report the utility of fresh uncultured tumor-derived EpCAM+ epithelial cells (FUTCs) for ex vivo drug-response interrogation. Analysis of murine Kras mutant FUTCs demonstrates pharmacological and adaptive signaling profiles comparable to subtype-matched cultured cells. By applying FUTC profiling on non-small-cell lung cancer patient samples, we report robust drug-response data in 19 of 20 cases, with cells exhibiting targeted drug sensitivities corresponding to their oncogenic drivers. In one of these cases, an EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma patient refractory to osimertinib, FUTC profiling is used to guide compassionate treatment. FUTC profiling identifies selective sensitivity to disulfiram and the combination of carboplatin plus etoposide, and the patient receives substantial clinical benefit from treatment with these agents. We conclude that FUTC profiling provides a robust, rapid, and actionable assessment of personalized cancer treatment options.

Abstract: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most common malignancies in the world, with a high mortality rate. RAN is a member of the Ras GTPase family and is overexpressed in a range of cancers, however, the relationship between RAN and OSCC is rarely reported. In this study, we found that RAN is overexpressed in OSCC tissues. RAN inhibition retarded OSCC cell proliferation and led to apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Knockdown of RAN inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Strikingly, we found that RAN and oncogene Y-box binding protein-1 (YBX1) are positively associated with the immune infiltrates of CD4+ Th2 cells in multiple types of cancer, and can promote IL-4 expression. IL-4 treatment can partially rescue RAN knockdown-induced cell apoptosis in OSCC cells. Moreover, overexpression of RAN could rescue cell growth inhibition caused by knockdown of YBX1. Furthermore, patients with low expression of both RAN and YBX1 had better overall survival than others. Collectively, these findings indicate that RAN is a target of YBX1. RAN and YBX1 are required for cell proliferation and IL-4 expression. RAN and YBX1 are co-expressed and can serve as potential co-biomarkers for poor prognosis in OSCC.

Abstract: Summary
Although the BCG vaccine offers partial protection, tuberculosis remains a leading cause of infectious disease death, killing ∼1.5 million people annually. We developed mucosal vaccines expressing the autophagy-inducing peptide C5 and mycobacterial Ag85B-p25 epitope using replication-defective human adenovirus (HAdv85C5) and bovine adenovirus (BAdv85C5) vectors. BAdv85C5-infected dendritic cells (DCs) expressed a robust transcriptome of genes regulating antigen processing compared to HAdv85C5-infected DCs. BAdv85C5-infected DCs showed enhanced galectin-3/8 and autophagy-dependent in vitro Ag85B-p25 epitope presentation to CD4 T cells. BCG-vaccinated mice were intranasally boosted using HAdv85C5 or BAdv85C5 followed by infection using aerosolized Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). BAdv85C5 protected mice against tuberculosis both as a booster after BCG vaccine (>1.4-log10 reduction in Mtb lung burden) and as a single intranasal dose (>0.5-log10 reduction). Protection was associated with robust CD4 and CD8 effector (TEM), central memory (TCM), and CD103+/CD69+ lung-resident memory (TRM) T cell expansion, revealing BAdv85C5 as a promising mucosal vaccine for tuberculosis.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that the effects of estrogen deficiency are not restricted to osteoclasts and bone resorption, but that bone matrix composition is altered and osteoblasts exhibit an impaired response to mechanical stimulation. In this study, we test the hypothesis that estrogen depletion alters osteogenic differentiation and matrix production by mechanically stimulated osteoblasts in vitro. MC3T3-E1 cells were pre-treated with estrogen for 14 days, after which estrogen was withdrawn or inhibited with Fulvestrant up to 14 days. Fluid shear stress (FSS) was applied using an orbital shaker. Under estrogen depletion in static culture, osteogenic marker (ALP) and gene expression (Runx2) were decreased at 2 and after 7 days of estrogen depletion, respectively. In addition, up to 7 day the inhibition of the estrogen receptor significantly decreased fibronectin expression (FN1) under static conditions. Under estrogen depletion and daily mechanical stimulation, changes in expression of Runx2 occurred earlier (4 days) and by 14 days, changes in matrix production (Col1a1) were reported. We propose that changes in osteoblast differentiation and impaired matrix production during estrogen depletion may contribute to the altered quality of the bone and act as a contributing factor to increased bone fragility in postmenopausal osteoporosis.

Abstract: Summary
Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are tissue-resident lymphocytes differing from conventional T lymphocytes in having no antigen-specific receptors. ILCs include natural killer (NK) cells, helper-like ILC1s, ILC2s, and ILC3s, and lymphoid tissue-inducer (LTi) cells. Tumor ILCs are frequently found in various cancers, but their roles in cancer immunity and immunotherapy remain largely unclear. We report here the single-cell characterization of blood and gut helper-like ILC subsets in healthy conditions and in colorectal cancer (CRC). The healthy gut contains ILC1s, ILC3s, and ILC3/NKs, but no ILC2s. Additional tumor-specific ILC1-like and ILC2 subsets were identified in CRC patients. Signaling lymphocytic activation molecule family member 1 (SLAMF1) was found to be selectively expressed on tumor-specific ILCs, and higher levels of SLAMF1+ ILCs were observed in the blood of CRC patients. The SLAMF1-high group of CRC patients had a significantly higher survival rate than the SLAMF1-low group, suggesting that SLAMF1 is an anti-tumor biomarker in CRC.

Abstract: Skeletal muscle wasting drives negative clinical outcomes and is associated with a spectrum of pathologies including cancer. Cancer cachexia is a multi-factorial syndrome that encompasses skeletal muscle wasting and remains understudied, despite being a frequent and serious co-morbidity. Deviation from the homeostatic balance between breakdown and regeneration leads to muscle wasting disorders, such as cancer cachexia. Muscle stem cells (MuSCs) are the cellular compartment responsible for muscle regeneration, which makes MuSCs an intriguing target in the context of wasting muscle. Molecular studies investigating MuSCs and skeletal muscle wasting largely focus on transcriptional changes, but our group and others propose that metabolic changes are another layer of cellular regulation underlying MuSC dysfunction in cancer cachexia. In the present study, we combined gene expression and non-targeted metabolomic profiling of myoblasts exposed to wasting conditions (cancer cell conditioned media, CC-CM) to derive a more complete picture of the myoblast response to wasting factors. After mapping these features to annotated pathways, we found that more than half of the mapped pathways were amino acid-related, linking global amino acid metabolic disruption to conditioned media-induced myoblast defects. Notably, arginine metabolism was a highly enriched pathway in combined metabolomic and transcriptomic data. Arginine catabolism generates nitric oxide (NO), an important signaling molecule known to have negative effects on mature muscle. We hypothesize that tumor-derived disruptions in Nitric Oxide Synthase (NOS)2-regulated arginine catabolism impair differentiation of MuSCs. The work presented here further investigates the effect of NOS2 overactivity on myoblast proliferation and differentiation. We show that NOS2 inhibition is sufficient to rescue wasting phenotypes associated with inflammatory cytokines. Ultimately, this work provides new insights into MuSC biology and opens up potential therapeutic avenues for addressing disrupted MuSC dynamics in cancer cachexia.

Abstract: Rutin is a natural flavonoid glycoside found in several vegetables and fruits such as buckwheat and onion. Rutin has a range of pharmacological effects that include anti-oxidant, anti-inflammation, anti-bacterial, and anti-cancer activities. α-glucosyl-rutin (AGR) is a derivative of rutin with increased water solubility that is used in cosmetics and foods. However, the effects of AGR on cellular responses have not been clarified, especially in stem cells. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) show high proliferative activity and pluripotency; however, regulation of molecular machinery such as cell cycle, metabolism, and DNA repair differs between iPSCs and somatic cells. Here, we compared the effects of AGR on iPSCs and differentiated cells (fibroblasts and skin keratinocytes). AGR-treated iPSCs exhibited increased cell viability. RNA sequencing and reverse transcriptase PCR analysis revealed that AGR induced expression of immediate early genes (IEGs) and differentiation-related genes in iPSCs. Our results suggest that AGR may activate differentiation signals mediated by IEG responses in iPSCs, resulting in altered metabolic activity and increased cell viability.

Abstract: Background
Epigenetic dysregulation participates in the initiation and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Bromodomain-containing protein 9 (BRD9) can identify acetylated lysine residues, contributing to several cancers. The function and molecular mechanism of BRD9 in HCC remain poorly understood.
Methods
BRD9 levels in tissues and cells of HCC and normal liver were evaluated using bioinformatic analysis, real-time PCR, and western blot. BRD9's association with clinical outcomes was investigated via survival analyses. Biological behaviors and pathways related to BRD9 were predicted using gene set enrichment analysis. BRD9's role in proliferation was verified via cell counting kit 8, colony formation, and 5-Ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine assays. Its role in the cell cycle and apoptosis was assessed using flow cytometry. The role of BRD9 in vivo was investigated using xenograft tumor models. A rescue assay was performed to investigate the molecular mechanism of BRD9.
Results
BRD9 was markedly upregulated in HCC and higher BRD9 expression was associated with higher grade, advanced stage, greater tumor size, and poorer prognosis. BRD9 overexpression enhanced cell proliferation, cell cycle progress, but impeded cell apoptosis. BRD9 downregulation had the opposite effects. In vivo, BRD9 promoted xenograft tumor growth. Mechanistically, BRD9 activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling, obstruction of which abrogated BRD9-mediated tumorigenesis.
Conclusion
Increased BRD9 in HCC correlated with poor prognosis, which functioned via activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Thus, BRD9 might be a promising biomarker and therapeutic target for patients with HCC.

Abstract: Objective
The critical role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) has been implicated in prostate cancer (PCa). As one of them, LINC00992 (LNC992) has been revealed by bioinformatics prediction to be significantly overexpressed in PCa. However, the underlying mechanism of LNC992 in PCa has not been well investigated.
Methods
First, gene expression microarrays of prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) were downloaded from the GEO database, and differentially expressed genes were analyzed. Subsequently, we assessed the LNC992 expression in PCa patients. PCa cells with overexpression or low expression of LNC992 were generated, followed by the examination of proliferation, invasion and migration in vitro and in vivo. The differentially expressed genes were analyzed by microarrays after altering LNC992 expression in PCa cells, and the downstream regulatory mechanisms of LNC992 were analyzed by bioinformatics analysis and validated by RIP and RNA pull-down assays.
Results
LNC992 was highly expressed in the PRAD database and in cancer tissues from PCa patients, serving as a poor prognostic factor for PCa patients. Knockdown of LNC992 significantly inhibited PCa cell growth, metastasis, and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we found that knockdown of LNC992 significantly suppressed SOX4 expression in cells and that LNC992 could bind to EIF4A3 and promote the translation of SOX4. Inhibition of either EIF4A3 or SOX4 significantly suppressed the growth and metastasis of PCa cells.
Conclusions
LNC992 elevates SOX4 expression by binding to SOX4 mRNA and recruiting translation initiation factor EIF4A3, thereby promoting the growth and metastasis of PCa cells in vitro and in vivo.

Abstract: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a major health problem worldwide, especially in the Chinese population. However, the intrinsic molecular mechanisms of ESCC progression are largely unclear, thus there is an unmet need to identify essential genes governing this disease. Here, we discovered WISP3, an important member of the CCN family, is markedly downregulated in ESCC tissues compared to the normal esophageal epithelium. Downregulation of WISP3 in cancer tissue correlates with worse overall survival of ESCC patients. Using ESCC cell lines as models, we found that forced expression of WISP3 not only suppressed proliferation and migration of cancer cells in vitro, but also inhibited ESCC tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. On the contrary, WISP3 depletion strongly promoted the tumorigenicity of ESCC cells. Mechanistically, we found that WISP3 negates the activity of AKT via inhibiting the IGF-2-IGF1R signaling cascade, which mediates the tumor-suppressive function of WISP3 in esophageal cancers. Together, we identified a novel factor driving the development of ESCC, and revealed a potential therapeutic target for ESCC treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Activation of NOTCH signaling in human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) by treatment with an engineered Delta-like ligand (DELTA1ext-IgG [DXI]) has enabled ex vivo expansion of short-term HSPCs, but the effect on long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells (LTR-HSCs) remains uncertain. Here, we demonstrate that ex vivo culture of human adult HSPCs with DXI under low oxygen tension limits ER stress in LTR-HSCs and lineage-committed progenitors compared with normoxic cultures. A distinct HSC gene signature was upregulated in cells cultured with DXI in hypoxia and, after 21 days of culture, the frequency of LTR-HSCs increased 4.9-fold relative to uncultured cells and 4.2-fold compared with the normoxia + DXI group. NOTCH and hypoxia pathways intersected to maintain undifferentiated phenotypes in cultured HSPCs. Our work underscores the importance of mitigating ER stress perturbations to preserve functional LTR-HSCs in extended cultures and offers a clinically feasible platform for the expansion of human HSPCs.

Abstract: Summary
The HIV-1 virion structural polyprotein, Gag, is directed to particle assembly sites at the plasma membrane by its N-terminal matrix (MA) domain. MA also binds to host tRNAs. To understand the molecular basis of MA-tRNA interaction and its potential function, we present a co-crystal structure of HIV-1 MA-tRNALys3 complex. The structure reveals a specialized group of MA basic and aromatic residues preconfigured to recognize the distinctive structure of the tRNA elbow. Mutational, cross-linking, fluorescence, and NMR analyses show that the crystallographically defined interface drives MA-tRNA binding in solution and living cells. The structure indicates that MA is unlikely to bind tRNA and membrane simultaneously. Accordingly, single-amino-acid substitutions that abolish MA-tRNA binding caused striking redistribution of Gag to the plasma membrane and reduced HIV-1 replication. Thus, HIV-1 exploits host tRNAs to occlude a membrane localization signal and control the subcellular distribution of its major structural protein.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we evaluate the efficacy of cryopreserved human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived corneal endothelial cells (CECs) to form a functional monolayer of corneal endothelium (CE) in rabbits and monkeys. We injected cryopreserved hESC-derived CECs into the anterior chamber of rabbits and monkeys either immediately after mechanical scraping of the central CE or a few days later when corneal edema developed. All preclinical models developed deturgesced and clear corneas following the injection of cryopreserved hESC-derived CECs and remained comparable to the corneas of the untreated eye. Confocal scanning microscopy confirmed an intact structure of hexagonal/polygonal cells and immunohistochemical analysis illustrated a monolayer expressing barrier and pump function proteins in the regenerated CE. The necropsy examination confirmed no remarkable change in multiple tissues assessed for teratoma formation. In conclusion, our data demonstrate the efficacy of cryopreserved hESC-derived CECs to form a functional CE on the denuded Descemet's membrane.

Abstract: Summary
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released into blood from multiple organs and carry molecular cargo that facilitates inter-organ communication and an integrated response to physiological and pathological stimuli. Interrogation of the protein cargo of EVs is currently limited by the absence of optimal and reproducible approaches for purifying plasma EVs that are suitable for downstream proteomic analyses. We describe a size-exclusion chromatography (SEC)-based method to purify EVs from platelet-poor plasma (PPP) for proteomics profiling via high-resolution mass spectrometry (SEC-MS). The SEC-MS method identifies more proteins with higher precision than several conventional EV isolation approaches. We apply the SEC-MS method to identify the unique proteomic signatures of EVs released from platelets, adipocytes, muscle cells, and hepatocytes, with the goal of identifying tissue-specific EV markers. Furthermore, we apply the SEC-MS approach to evaluate the effects of a single bout of exercise on EV proteomic cargo in human plasma.

Abstract: Summary
The parasite Cryptosporidium invades and replicates in intestinal epithelial cells and is a leading cause of diarrheal disease and early childhood mortality. The molecular mechanisms that underlie infection and pathogenesis are largely unknown. Here, we delineate the events of host cell invasion and uncover a mechanism unique to Cryptosporidium. We developed a screen to identify parasite effectors, finding the injection of multiple parasite proteins into the host from the rhoptry organelle. These factors are targeted to diverse locations within the host cell and its interface with the parasite. One identified effector, rhoptry protein 1 (ROP1), accumulates in the terminal web of enterocytes through direct interaction with the host protein LIM domain only 7 (LMO7) an organizer of epithelial cell polarity and cell-cell adhesion. Genetic ablation of LMO7 or ROP1 in mice or parasites, respectively, impacts parasite burden in vivo in opposite ways. Taken together, these data provide molecular insight into how Cryptosporidium manipulates its intestinal host niche.

Abstract: Summary
Due to limitations on high-resolution strain tracking, selection dynamics during gut microbiota colonization and transmission between hosts remain mostly mysterious. Here, we introduced hundreds of barcoded Escherichia coli strains into germ-free mice and quantified strain-level dynamics and metagenomic changes. Mutations in genes involved in motility and metabolite utilization are reproducibly selected within days. Even with rapid selection, coprophagy enforced similar barcode distributions across co-housed mice. Whole-genome sequencing of hundreds of isolates revealed linked alleles that demonstrate between-host transmission. A population-genetics model predicts substantial fitness advantages for certain mutants and that migration accounted for ∼10% of the resident microbiota each day. Treatment with ciprofloxacin suggests interplay between selection and transmission. While initial colonization was mostly uniform, in two mice a bottleneck reduced diversity and selected for ciprofloxacin resistance in the absence of drug. These findings highlight the interplay between environmental transmission and rapid, deterministic selection during evolution of the intestinal microbiota.

Abstract: Summary
Lack of interleukin-6 (IL-6) leads to expansion of adipose tissue mass in rodents and humans. The exact underlying mechanisms have not been identified. In this placebo-controlled, non-randomized, participant-blinded crossover study, we use the IL-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab to investigate the role of endogenous IL-6 in regulating systemic energy metabolism at rest and during exercise and recovery in lean and obese men using tracer dilution methodology. Tocilizumab reduces fatty acid appearance in the circulation under all conditions in lean and obese individuals, whereas lipolysis (the rate of glycerol appearance into the circulation) is mostly unaffected. The fact that fatty acid oxidation is unaffected by IL-6 receptor blockade suggests increased re-esterification of fatty acids. Glucose kinetics are unaffected. We find that blocking endogenous IL-6 signaling with tocilizumab impairs fat mobilization, which may contribute to expansion of adipose tissue mass and, thus, affect the health of individuals undergoing anti-IL-6 therapy (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03967691).

Proline hydroxylase domain-containing enzymes regulate calcium levels in cardiomyocytes by TRPA1 ion channel,

Abstract: The proline hydroxylase domain-containing enzymes (PHDs) acts as cellular oxygen sensors, inducing a series of responses to hypoxia, especially during the regulation of metabolism and energy homeostasis. The increase of Ca2+ in cardiomyocytes, induced by the opening of PHD signaling pathway, is the key initiation signal necessary for the PHD-mediated regulation of the energy metabolism pathway, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains incompletely understood. This study used PHD inhibitors (PHIs) and PHD2-specific RNA interference (PHD2shRNA) to inhibit PHD signals in cardiomyocytes to explore whether transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) is involved in the regulation of calcium ion influx in the PHD activation pathway associated with to AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). The Fluo-3AM probe was used to measure changes in free intracellular calcium ion concentrations, and Western blot analysis was used to detect the levels of phosphorylated (P)-AMPK, TRPA1, and P–Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase Ⅱ (CaMKⅡ) levels. The PHI-mediated inhibition of PHD resulted in an increase in free Ca2+ fluorescence in cardiomyocytes, which activated AMPK, TRPA1, and CaMKⅡ. The TRPA1 inhibitor HC030031, the CaMKII inhibitor KN93, and a ryanodine inhibitor (Ryanodine) were all able to inhibit the PHI-induced increase in intracellular Ca2+ and AMPK activation. Both PHIs and PHD2shRNA were able to effectively activate CaMKII and TRPA1. However, an inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP3R) inhibitor and the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H89 did not significantly inhibit the PHI-induced increase in intracellular Ca2+ and AMPK activation. These results indicated that PHD might activate the CaMKⅡ pathway through the TRPA1 ion channel, inducing the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2), activating AMPK to initiate the protective effects of hypoxia in cardiomyocytes.

Abstract: Osteoarthritis (OA) patients undergo cartilage degradation and experience painful joint swelling. OA symptoms are caused by inflammatory molecules and the upregulation of catabolic genes leading to the breakdown of cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM). Here, we investigate the effects of gallic acid (GA) and mechanical stretching on the expression of anabolic and catabolic genes and restoring ECM production by osteoarthritic human articular chondrocytes (hAChs) cultured in monolayers. hAChs were seeded onto conventional plates or silicone chambers with or without 100 μM GA. A 5% cyclic tensile strain (CTS) was applied to the silicone chambers and the deposition of collagen and glycosaminoglycan, and gene expressions of collagen types II (COL2A1), XI (COL11A2), I (COL1A1), and X (COL10A1), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-13) as inflammation markers, were quantified. CTS and GA acted synergistically to promote the deposition of collagen and glycosaminoglycan in the ECM by 14- and 7-fold, respectively. Furthermore, the synergistic stimuli selectively upregulated the expression of cartilage-specific proteins, COL11A2 by 7-fold, and COL2A1 by 47-fold, and, in contrast, downregulated the expression of MMP-1 by 2.5-fold and MMP-13 by 125-fold. GA supplementation with CTS is a promising approach for restoring osteoarthritic hAChs ECM production ability making them suitable for complex tissue engineering applications.

Abstract: Activation of Tenon's capsule fibroblasts limits the success rate of glaucoma filtration surgery (GFS), the most efficacious therapy for patients with glaucoma. Angiotensin type 1 receptor (AGTR1) is involved in tissues remodeling and fibrogenesis. However, whether AGTR1 is involved in the progress of fibrogenesis after GFS is not fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of an AGTR1 in scar formation after GFS and the potential anti-fibrosis effect of AGTR1 blocker. AGTR1 expression level was increased in subconjunctival tissues in a rat model of GFS and transforming growth factor-beta 2 (TGF-β2)-induced human Tenon's capsule fibroblasts (HTFs). AGTR1 blocker treatment suppressed TGF-β2-induced HTF migration and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and fibronectin (FN) expression. AGTR1 blocker treatment also attenuated collagen deposition and α-SMA and FN expression in subconjunctival tissues of the rat model after GFS. Moreover, AGTR1 blocker decreased TGF-β2-induced P65 phosphorylation, P65 nuclear translocation, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) luciferase activity. Additionally, BAY 11–7082 (an NF-κB inhibitor) significantly suppressed HTF fibrosis. In conclusion, our results indicate that AGTR1 is involved in scar formation after GFS. The AGTR1 blocker attenuates subconjunctival fibrosis after GFS by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway. These findings indicate that targeting AGTR1 is a potential approach to attenuate fibrosis after GFS.

Abstract: Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF)-2 has been highlighted to play a significant role in maintaining the endothelial barrier integrity in lung injury induced by ischemia-reperfusion (I/R). However, the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. The aims of this study were to determine whether dexmedetomidine preconditioning (DexP) modulates pulmonary I/R-induced lung injury through the alteration in KGF-2 expression. In our I/R-modeled mice, DexP significantly inhibited pathological injury, inflammatory response, and inflammatory cell infiltration, while promoted endothelial barrier integrity and KGF-2 promoter activity in lung tissues. Bioinformatics prediction and ChIP-seq revealed that I/R significantly diminished the level of H3K4me3 modification in the KGF-2 promoter, which was significantly reversed by DexP. Moreover, DexP inhibited the expression of histone demethylase JMJD3, which in turn promoted the expression of KGF-2. In addition, overexpression of JMJD3 weakened the protective effect of DexP on lung injury in mice with I/R.

Abstract: Background
Up-regulated chemerin correlates with the risk and the severity of preeclampsia. In this study, we examined impacts and underlying mechanisms by which chemerin regulates pyroptosis and trophoblast inflammation.
Methods
An in vivo preeclampsia model was established in rats and trophoblasts challenged with hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) with or without exogenous chemerin were used as the in vitro model. Expressions of homeobox A9 (HOXA9), chemerin, chemerin receptor (the chemokine-like receptor 1 (CMKLR1)), activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), and markers related to NOD-like receptor pyrin-containing receptor 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome were examined by Western blot, and in response to AMPK inhibitor, targeting CMKLR1 or HOXA9. Cell viability and death were examined by CCK-8 and Hoechst staining, respectively. Productions of IL-1β and IL-18 in serum or culture medium were measured by ELISA. Transcriptional regulation of HOXA9 on chemerin was examined by combining expressional analysis, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and luciferase reporter assays.
Results
Up-regulations of HOXA9, chemerin, CMKLR1, TXNIP, and NLRP3 inflammasome were observed in both in vivo and in vitro models of preeclampsia, which were associated with increased death of trophoblasts and productions of IL-1β and IL-18. CMKLR1 and activated-AMPK essentially mediated chemerin effects in trophoblasts. HOXA9 directly activated the transcription of chemerin.
Conclusions
HOXA9 directly activates the transcription of chemerin, which, by activating the AMPK/TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome, promotes pyroptosis and inflammation of trophoblasts, and contributes to preeclampsia. Therefore, targeting chemerin signaling may benefit the prevention and/or treatment of preeclampsia.

Abstract: Summary
Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by the loss of maternal UBE3A, a ubiquitin protein ligase E3A. Here, we study neurons derived from patients with AS and neurotypical individuals, and reciprocally modulate UBE3A using antisense oligonucleotides. Unbiased proteomics reveal proteins that are regulated by UBE3A in a disease-specific manner, including PEG10, a retrotransposon-derived GAG protein. PEG10 protein increase, but not RNA, is dependent on UBE3A and proteasome function. PEG10 binds to both RNA and ataxia-associated proteins (ATXN2 and ATXN10), localizes to stress granules, and is secreted in extracellular vesicles, modulating vesicle content. Rescue of AS patient-derived neurons by UBE3A reinstatement or PEG10 reduction reveals similarity in transcriptome changes. Overexpression of PEG10 during mouse brain development alters neuronal migration, suggesting that it can affect brain development. These findings imply that PEG10 is a secreted human UBE3A target involved in AS pathophysiology.

Abstract: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are an abundant component of the tumor microenvironment and have distinct features from normal fibroblasts (NFs). However, the discriminative nature of heterogeneous CAFs under glucose starvation remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the changes in the mitochondrial calcium concentration and relevant intracellular machinery in CAFs under glucose-deficient conditions. Xenografted tumor masses were dissected into multiple pieces and subjected to the CAF isolation using magnetically activated cell sorting (MACS). NFs were separated from the normal lung and skin. Under glucose starvation, CAFs from the tumor mass exhibited heterogeneity in cell proliferation, ATP production and calcium concentration. Compared to NFs, mitochondrial calcium concentration was significantly higher in glucose-starved CAFs with upregulation of mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) that led to enhancement of ATP production and cell growth. Intriguingly, treatment of glucose-starved CAFs with oligomycin increased apoptosis by disrupted calcium homeostasis following overactivation of the mPTP. Moreover, oligomycin-induced apoptosis was mitigated by calcium chelation. This study demonstrated that the discriminative calcium influx to mitochondria through MCU coordinated cell growth and apoptosis in glucose-starved CAFs but not in NFs.

Abstract: Mitochondria are dynamic organelles with wide range of morphologies contributing to regulating different signaling pathways and several cellular functions. Leigh syndrome (LS) is a classic pediatric mitochondrial disorder characterized by complex and variable clinical pathologies, and primarily affects the nervous system during early development. It is important to understand the differences between mitochondrial morphologies in healthy and diseased states so that focused therapies can target the disease during its early stages. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of mitochondrial dynamics in five patient-derived human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) containing different mutations associated with LS. Our results suggest that subtle alterations in mitochondrial morphologies are specific to the mtDNA variant. Three out of the five LS-hiPSCs exhibited characteristics consistent with fused mitochondria. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study that quantifies mitochondrial dynamics in hiPSCs specific to mitochondrial disorders. In addition, we observed an overall decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential in all five LS-hiPSCs. A more thorough analysis of the correlations between mitochondrial dynamics, membrane potential dysfunction caused by mutations in the mtDNA in hiPSCs and differentiated derivatives will aid in identifying unique morphological signatures of various mitochondrial disorders during early stages of embryonic development.

Abstract: Background
Particulate matter≤ 2.5 μm (PM2.5) is a type of environmental agent associated with air pollution, which induces hepatic fibrosis. However, the function and mechanism of PM2.5 on hepatic stellate cell (HSC) proliferation and fibrosis remain largely unknown.
Methods
Human HSC line (LX-2) and murine HSCs were exposed to various doses of PM2.5. microRNA (miR)-411 expression was detected via quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Cell proliferation, fibrosis, mitochondrial dynamics dysfunction and mitophagy were determined via cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), qRT-PCR, Western blotting and immunofluorescence.
Results
PM2.5 facilitated HSC proliferation and fibrosis via increasing the levels of ACTA2, Collagen 1, TIMP1 and TGF-β1. PM2.5 reduced miR-411 expression, and contributed to mitochondrial dynamics dysfunction via increasing Drp1 and decreasing OPA1, TOM20 and PGC-1α levels. PM2.5 promoted mitophagy by upregulating the levels of Beclin-1, LC3II/I, PINK1 and Parkin. miR-411 overexpression or autophagy blockage using 3-methyladenine (3-MA) relieved PM2.5-mediated cell proliferation and fibrosis-associated factor expression in HSCs. Drp1 was targeted by miR-411. miR-411 mitigated PM2.5-induced mitophagy via targeting Drp1. Drp1 overexpression abolished the inhibitory role of miR-411 in cell proliferation and fibrosis-associated factor levels in HSCs.
Conclusion
PM2.5 induced HSC activation and fibrosis via promoting Drp1-mediated mitophagy by decreasing miR-411, thereby causing liver fibrosis.

Abstract: Summary
Kras-driven lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common lung cancer. A significant fraction of patients with Kras-driven LUAD respond to immunotherapy, but mechanistic studies of immune responses against LUAD have been limited because of a lack of immunotherapy-responsive models. We report the development of the immunogenic KP × NINJA (inversion inducible joined neoantigen) (KP-NINJA) LUAD model. This model allows temporal uncoupling of antigen and tumor induction, which allows one to wait until after infection-induced inflammation has subsided to induce neoantigen expression by tumors. Neoantigen expression is restricted to EPCAM+ cells in the lung and expression of neoantigen was more consistent between tumors than when neoantigens were encoded on lentiviruses. Moreover, tumors were infiltrated by tumor-specific CD8 T cells. Finally, LUAD cell lines derived from KP-NINJA mice were immunogenic and responded to immune checkpoint therapy (anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4), providing means for future studies into the immunobiology of therapeutic responses in LUAD.

Abstract: Summary
LPIN1 mutations are responsible for inherited recurrent rhabdomyolysis, a life-threatening condition with no efficient therapeutic intervention. Here, we conduct a bedside-to-bench-and-back investigation to study the pathophysiology of lipin1 deficiency. We find that lipin1-deficient myoblasts exhibit a reduction in phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate close to autophagosomes and late endosomes that prevents the recruitment of the GTPase Armus, locks Rab7 in the active state, inhibits vesicle clearance by fusion with lysosomes, and alters their positioning and function. Oxidized mitochondrial DNA accumulates in late endosomes, where it activates Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) and triggers inflammatory signaling and caspase-dependent myolysis. Hydroxychloroquine blocks TLR9 activation by mitochondrial DNA in vitro and may attenuate flares of rhabdomyolysis in 6 patients treated. We suggest a critical role for defective clearance of oxidized mitochondrial DNA that activates TLR9-restricted inflammation in lipin1-related rhabdomyolysis. Interventions blocking TLR9 activation or inflammation can improve patient care in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Hand1 and Hand2 are transcriptional factors, and knockout mice of these genes show left and right ventricular hypoplasia, respectively. However, their function and expression in human cardiogenesis are not well studied. To delineate their expressions and assess their functions in human cardiomyocytes (CMs) in vitro, we established two triple-reporter human induced pluripotent stem cell lines that express HAND1mCherry, HAND2EGFP and either MYH6-driven iRFP670 or tagBFP constitutively and investigated their expression dynamics during cardiac differentiation. On day 5 of the differentiation, HAND1 expression marked cardiac progenitor cells. We profiled the CM subpopulations on day 20 with RNA sequencing and found that mCherry+ CMs showed higher proliferative ability than mCherry− CMs and identified a gene network of LEF1, HAND1, and HAND2 to regulate proliferation in CMs. Finally, we identified CD105 as a surface marker of highly proliferative CMs.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity, characterized by expansion and metabolic dysregulation of white adipose tissue (WAT), has reached pandemic proportions and acts as a primer for a wide range of metabolic disorders. Remodeling of WAT lipidome in obesity and associated comorbidities can explain disease etiology and provide valuable diagnostic and prognostic markers. To support understanding of WAT lipidome remodeling at the molecular level, we provide in-depth lipidomics profiling of human subcutaneous and visceral WAT of lean and obese individuals. We generate a human WAT reference lipidome by performing tissue-tailored preanalytical and analytical workflows, which allow accurate identification and semi-absolute quantification of 1,636 and 737 lipid molecular species, respectively. Deep lipidomic profiling allows identification of main lipid (sub)classes undergoing depot-/phenotype-specific remodeling. Previously unanticipated diversity of WAT ceramides is now uncovered. AdipoAtlas reference lipidome serves as a data-rich resource for the development of WAT-specific high-throughput methods and as a scaffold for systems medicine data integration.

Abstract: Vaccinations are widely credited with reducing death rates from COVID-19, but the underlying host-viral mechanisms/interactions for morbidity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 infection remain poorly understood. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) describes the severe lung injury, which is pathologically associated with alveolar damage, inflammation, non-cardiogenic edema, and hyaline membrane formation. Because proteostatic pathways play central roles in cellular protection, immune modulation, protein degradation, and tissue repair, we examined the pathological features for the unfolded protein response (UPR) using the surrogate biomarker glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2. At autopsy, immunostaining of COVID-19 lungs showed highly elevated expression of GRP78 in both pneumocytes and macrophages compared with that of non-COVID control lungs. GRP78 expression was detected in both SARS-CoV-2-infected and un-infected pneumocytes as determined by multiplexed immunostaining for nucleocapsid protein. In macrophages, immunohistochemical staining for GRP78 from deceased COVID-19 patients was increased but overlapped with GRP78 expression taken from surgical resections of non-COVID-19 controls. In contrast, the robust in situ GRP78 immunostaining of pneumocytes from COVID-19 autopsies exhibited no overlap and was independent of age, race/ethnicity, and gender compared with that from non-COVID-19 controls. Our findings bring new insights for stress-response pathways involving the proteostatic network implicated for host resilience and suggest that targeting of GRP78 expression with existing therapeutics might afford an alternative therapeutic strategy to modulate host-viral interactions during SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Abstract: Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB (MPS IIIB) is a lysosomal disease caused by mutations in the NAGLU gene encoding α-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAGLU) which degrades heparan sulfate in lysosomes. Deficiency in NAGLU results in lysosomal accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and neurological symptoms. Currently, there is no effective treatment or cure for this disease. In this study, induced pluripotent stem cell lines were established from two MPS IIIB patient fibroblast lines and differentiated into neural stem cells and neurons. MPS IIIB neural stem cells exhibited NAGLU deficiency accompanied with GAG accumulation, as well as lysosomal enlargement and secondary lipid accumulation. Treatments with recombinant NAGLU, δ-tocopherol, and 2-hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin significantly reduced the disease phenotypes in these cells. These results indicate the MPS IIIB neural stem cells and neurons have the disease relevant phenotype and can be used as a cell-based disease model system for evaluation of drug efficacy and compound screening for drug development.

Abstract: Toxic advanced glycation end products (toxic AGEs) derived from glycolaldehyde (AGE3) have been implicated in the development of diabetic vascular complications such as retinopathy characterised by excessive angiogenesis. Different receptor types, such as receptor for AGEs (RAGE), Toll like receptor-4 and scavenger receptors, are expressed in endothelial cells and contribute to AGE-elicited alteration of cell function. In the present study, we examined the involvement of AGE-related receptors on AGE-induced angiogenesis in endothelial cells. The effects of pharmacological inhibitors or receptor neutralizing antibodies on AGE3-induced tube formation were investigated using the in vitro Matrigel tube formation assay in b.End5 cells (mouse endothelial cells). AGE3-induced signalling pathways and receptor expression changes were analysed by Western blot analysis and flow cytometry, respectively. Both FPS-ZM1, a RAGE inhibitor, and fucoidan, a ligand for scavenger receptors, suppressed AGE3-induced tube formation. Cocktails of neutralizing antibodies against the scavenger receptors CD36, CD163 and LOX-1 prevented AGE3-induced tube formation. AGE3 activated mTOR signalling, resulting in facilitation of tube formation. Activation of the AGE-RAGE pathway also led to the upregulation of scavenger receptors. Taken together, our findings suggest that the scavenger receptors CD36, CD163 and LOX-1 in conjunction with the RAGE receptor work together to mediate toxic AGE-induced facilitation of angiogenesis.

Abstract: Stresses, such as neurohumoral activation, induced pathological cardiac hypertrophy is the main risk factor for heart failure. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) plays a key role in maintaining protein homeostasis and cardiac function. However, research on the role and mechanism of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) in cardiac hypertrophy is limited. Here, we observe that the deubiquitinating enzyme ubiquitin-specific protease 12(USP12) is upregulated in Ang II-induced hypertrophic hearts and primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs). Inhibition of USP12 ameliorate Ang II-induced myocardial hypertrophy, while overexpression of USP12 have the opposite effect. USP12 deficiency also significantly attenuate the phenotype of Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy in vivo. Moreover, we demonstrate that USP12 aggravate Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy by enhancing METTL3, a methyltransferase which catalyze N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification on messenger RNA and acts as a harmful factor in pathological cardiac hypertrophy. Upregulation of METTL3 reverse the reduction of myocardial hypertrophy induced by USP12 silencing in NRCMs. In contrast, knockdown of METTL3 attenuate the aggravation of myocardial hypertrophy in USP12-overexpressing NRCMs. Furthermore, we discover that USP12 promote the expression of METTL3 via upregulating p300. Mechanistically, USP12 binds and stabilizes p300, thereby activating the transcription of its downstream gene METTL3. Finally, our data show that USP12 is partially dependent on the stabilization of p300 to activate METTL3 expression and promote myocardial hypertrophy. Taken together, our results demonstrate that USP12 acts as a pro-hypertrophic deubiquitinating enzyme via enhancing p300/METTL3 axis, indicating that targeting USP12 could be a potential treatment strategy for pathological cardiac hypertrophy.

Abstract: Summary
Pooled CRISPR screens have been widely applied to mammalian and other organisms to elucidate the interplay between genes and phenotypes of interest. The most popular method for delivering the CRISPR components into mammalian cells is lentivirus based. However, because lentivirus is not always an option, virus-free protocols are starting to emerge. Here, we demonstrate an improved virus-free, genome-wide CRISPR screening platform for Chinese hamster ovary cells with 75,488 gRNAs targeting 15,028 genes. Each gRNA expression cassette in the library is precisely integrated into a genomic landing pad, resulting in a very high percentage of single gRNA insertions and minimal clonal variation. Using this platform, we perform a negative selection screen on cell proliferation that identifies 1,980 genes that affect proliferation and a positive selection screen on the toxic endoplasmic reticulum stress inducer, tunicamycin, that identifies 77 gene knockouts that improve survivability.

Abstract: Summary
Functional recovery is still limited mainly due to several mechanisms, such as the activation of Nogo receptor-1 (NgR1) signaling, when human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural stem/progenitor cells (hiPSC-NS/PC) are transplanted for subacute spinal cord injury (SCI). We previously reported the neuroprotective and regenerative benefits of overexpression of lateral olfactory tract usher substance (LOTUS), an endogenous NgR1 antagonist, in the injured spinal cord using transgenic mice. Here, we evaluate the effects of lentiviral transduction of LOTUS gene into hiPSC-NS/PCs before transplantation in a mouse model of subacute SCI. The transduced LOTUS contributes to neurite extension, suppression of apoptosis, and secretion of neurotrophic factors in vitro. In vivo, the hiPSC-NS/PCs enhance the survival of grafted cells and enhance axonal extension of the transplanted cells, resulting in significant restoration of motor function following SCI. Therefore, the gene transduction of LOTUS in hiPSC-NS/PCs could be a promising adjunct for transplantation therapy for SCI.

Abstract: Summary
Early-life antibiotic exposure perturbs the intestinal microbiota and accelerates type 1 diabetes (T1D) development in the NOD mouse model. Here, we found that maternal cecal microbiota transfer (CMT) to NOD mice after early-life antibiotic perturbation largely rescued the induced T1D enhancement. Restoration of the intestinal microbiome was significant and persistent, remediating the antibiotic-depleted diversity, relative abundance of particular taxa, and metabolic pathways. CMT also protected against perturbed metabolites and normalized innate and adaptive immune effectors. CMT restored major patterns of ileal microRNA and histone regulation of gene expression. Further experiments suggest a gut-microbiota-regulated T1D protection mechanism centered on Reg3γ, in an innate intestinal immune network involving CD44, TLR2, and Reg3γ. This regulation affects downstream immunological tone, which may lead to protection against tissue-specific T1D injury.

Abstract: During embryo development, human primordial germ cells (hPGCs) express a naive gene expression program with similarities to pre-implantation naive epiblast (EPI) cells and naive human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Previous studies have shown that TFAP2C is required for establishing naive gene expression in these cell types, however the role of additional naive transcription factors in hPGC biology is not known. Here, we show that unlike TFAP2C, the naive transcription factors KLF4 and TFCP2L1 are not required for induction of hPGC-like cells (hPGCLCs) from hESCs, and they have no role in establishing and maintaining a naive-like gene expression program in hPGCLCs with extended time in culture. Taken together, our results suggest a model whereby the molecular mechanisms that drive naive gene expression in hPGCs/hPGCLCs are distinct from those in the naive EPI/hESCs.

Abstract: Summary
Characterizing likelihood of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is an important yet unmet challenge. In this study, a machine-learning framework is developed using imaging of biopsy pathology specimens to generate models of likelihood of NAC response. Developed using cross-validation (evaluable N = 66) and an independent validation cohort (evaluable N = 56), our models achieve promising results (65%–73% accuracy). Interestingly, one model—using features derived from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tissues in conjunction with clinico-demographic features—is able to stratify the cohort into likely responders in cross-validation and the validation cohort (response rate of 65% for predicted responder compared with the 41% baseline response rate in the validation cohort). The results suggest that computational approaches applied to routine pathology specimens of MIBC can capture differences between responders and non-responders to NAC and should therefore be considered in the future design of precision oncology for MIBC.

Abstract: Summary
Many genetic and environmental factors increase susceptibility to cognitive impairment (CI), and the gut microbiome is increasingly implicated. However, the identity of gut microbes associated with CI risk, their effects on CI, and their mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that a carbohydrate-restricted (ketogenic) diet potentiates CI induced by intermittent hypoxia in mice and alters the gut microbiota. Depleting the microbiome reduces CI, whereas transplantation of the risk-associated microbiome or monocolonization with Bilophila wadsworthia confers CI in mice fed a standard diet. B. wadsworthia and the risk-associated microbiome disrupt hippocampal synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, and gene expression. The CI is associated with microbiome-dependent increases in intestinal interferon-gamma (IFNg)-producing Th1 cells. Inhibiting Th1 cell development abrogates the adverse effects of both B. wadsworthia and environmental risk factors on CI. Together, these findings identify select gut bacteria that contribute to environmental risk for CI in mice by promoting inflammation and hippocampal dysfunction.

Abstract: Renal interstitial fibrosis (RIF) is the common irreversible pathway by which chronic kidney disease (CKD) progresses to the end stage. The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway is a common factor leading to inflammation-mediated RIF, but its downstream regulatory mechanism is still unclear. Bioinformatics analysis predicted that serum amyloid A protein 1 (SAA1) was one of the target genes for transcriptional activation of STAT3 signaling. As an acute phase reaction protein, SAA1 plays an important role in many inflammatory reactions, and research has suggested that SAA1 is significantly elevated in the serum of patients with CKD. In this research, multiple experiments were performed to investigate the role of SAA1 in the process of RIF. SAA1 was abnormally highly expressed in kidney tissue from individuals who underwent unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) and TGF-β-induced HK2 cells, and the abnormal expression was directly related to the transcriptional activation of STAT3. Additionally, SAA1 can directly target and bind valosin-containing protein (VCP)-interacting membrane selenoprotein (VIMP) to inhibit the function of the Derlin-1/VCP/VIMP complex, preventing the transportation and degradation of the misfolded protein, resulting in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress characterized by an increase in glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) levels and ultimately promoting the occurrence and development of RIF.

Abstract: Inflammation is an essential factor contributing to sepsis-induced endothelial cell (EC) activation. Interleukin-35 (IL-35) is an anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressive cytokine that exerts protective effects on many inflammatory diseases. In this study, we investigated the effects of IL-35 on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced EC activation and the potential underlying mechanism. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were incubated with LPS (1 μg/ml) for 24 h and then cocultured with different concentrations (0, 1, 10, or 100 ng/ml) of recombinant human IL-35 (rhIL-35) for 12 h. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that IL-35 inhibited LPS-induced HUVEC apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. RT-qPCR and Western blot analyses showed significantly higher mRNA and protein levels of the adhesion molecules intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and the inflammatory factors IL-6 and IL-8 in the LPS group than in the control group. These changes were alleviated by IL-35 treatment, suggesting that IL-35 protects ECs by downregulating inflammation. Furthermore, IL-35 induced signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT4 activation and promoted their interaction. Blocking STAT1 or STAT4 expression by fludarabine (STAT1 inhibitor) treatment or siRNA-STAT4-interfering fragment transfection inhibited the protective effect of IL-35 on ECs. Moreover, we observed a similar protective effect of IL-35 treatment on ECs in a mouse sepsis model induced by intraperitoneal LPS injection. This study indicated that IL-35 exerts anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects on LPS-induced EC activation by activating the STAT1 and STAT4 signaling pathways.

Abstract: The bladder undergoes profound structural alterations after bladder outlet obstruction (BOO), characterized by hypertrophy of the bladder wall and accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM). Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) has been found to promote fibrosis of the bladder induced by partial bladder outlet obstruction (pBOO). Activin receptor-like kinase 4 (ALK4) is a downstream receptor of the TGF-β superfamily. However, the role of the ALK4–Smad2/3 pathway in the pathogenesis of bladder fibrosis caused by pBOO remains unknown. This study focused on learning the role of ALK4 in the process of bladder fibrosis caused by pBOO. The pBOO mice models showed that ALK4 expression was found to upregulate in the wild-type bladder 6 weeks after pBOO compared to control group. Then, mice with heterozygous knockout of the ALK4 gene (ALK4+/−) were generated. Histological analysis and Western blot (WB) results showed significant suppression of collagen expression in the bladders of ALK4+/− mice after pBOO compared with WT mice. WB also showed that ALK4+/− mice demonstrated significant suppression of phosphorylated Smad2/3 (p-Smad2/3) expression in the bladder 6 weeks after pBOO but not of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase or protein 38 (p-ERK, p-JNK, p-P38) expression. This effect might have occurred through partial inactivation of the Smad2/3 signaling pathway. In vitro, ALK4 overexpression promoted collagen production in cultured BSMCs and activated the Smad2/3 signaling pathway. Taken together, our results demonstrated that ALK4 insufficiency alleviated bladder fibrosis in a mouse model of pBOO partly by suppressing Smad2/3 activity.

Abstract: Summary
Epigenetic modifications control the stability and translation of mRNA molecules. Here, we present a microscopy-based platform for quantifying modified RNA molecules and for relating the modification patterns to single-cell phenotypes. We directly capture mRNAs from cell lysates on oligo-dT-coated coverslips, then visually detect and sequence individual m6A-immunolabled transcripts without amplification. Integration of a nanoscale device enabled us to isolate single cells on the platform, and thereby relate single-cell m6A modification states to gene expression signatures and cell surface markers. Application of the platform to MUTZ3 leukemia cells revealed a marked reduction in cellular m6A levels as CD34+ leukemic progenitors differentiate to CD14+ myeloid cells. We then coupled single-molecule m6A detection with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to relate mRNA and m6A levels of individual genes to single-cell phenotypes. This single-cell multi-modal assay suite can empower investigations of RNA modifications in rare populations and single cells.

Abstract: Summary
Heterozygous mutations in HNF1B in humans result in a multisystem disorder, including pancreatic hypoplasia and diabetes mellitus. Here we used a well-controlled human induced pluripotent stem cell pancreatic differentiation model to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying HNF1B-associated diabetes. Our results show that lack of HNF1B blocks specification of pancreatic fate from the foregut progenitor (FP) stage, but HNF1B haploinsufficiency allows differentiation of multipotent pancreatic progenitor cells (MPCs) and insulin-secreting β-like cells. We show that HNF1B haploinsufficiency impairs cell proliferation in FPs and MPCs. This could be attributed to impaired induction of key pancreatic developmental genes, including SOX11, ROBO2, and additional TEAD1 target genes whose function is associated with MPC self-renewal. In this work we uncover an exhaustive list of potential HNF1B gene targets during human pancreas organogenesis whose downregulation might underlie HNF1B-associated diabetes onset in humans, thus providing an important resource to understand the pathogenesis of this disease.

Abstract: Summary
The pore-forming protein gasdermin D (GSDMD) executes lytic cell death called pyroptosis to eliminate the replicative niche of intracellular pathogens. Evolution favors pathogens that circumvent this host defense mechanism. Here, we show that the Shigella ubiquitin ligase IpaH7.8 functions as an inhibitor of GSDMD. Shigella is an enteroinvasive bacterium that causes hemorrhagic gastroenteritis in primates, but not rodents. IpaH7.8 contributes to species specificity by ubiquitinating human, but not mouse, GSDMD and targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Accordingly, infection of human epithelial cells with IpaH7.8-deficient Shigella flexneri results in increased GSDMD-dependent cell death compared with wild type. Consistent with pyroptosis contributing to murine disease resistance, eliminating GSDMD from NLRC4-deficient mice, which are already sensitized to oral infection with Shigella flexneri, leads to further enhanced bacterial replication and increased disease severity. This work highlights a species-specific pathogen arms race focused on maintenance of host cell viability.

Abstract: Aberrant activity of bone resorbing osteoclasts plays a key role in the development of osteoporosis and cancer bone metastasis. The identification of novel and specific targets will be helpful for the development of new therapeutic strategies for bone metastasis in lung cancer. Herein, we examined microRNAs in tumor cell-derived exosomes to investigate the communication between the bone environment and tumor cells. TCGA database analysis showed that the level of miR-17-5p increased in non-small cell lung cancer tissues compared with non-tumor tissues. To investigate the function of exosomes in inducing osteoclastogenesis, osteoclast precursors were incubated with exosomes isolated from non-small cell lung cancer cell line, as well as receptor activator of NF-KB ligand and M-CSF to induce osteoclastogenesis. We found that exosomal miR-17-5p is upregulated in a non-small cell lung cancer cell line with bone metastasis compared with the original cell line. Overexpression of miR-17-5p enhanced the osteoclastogenesis of RAW264.7 cells. PTEN was identified as a direct target of miR-17-5p and showed negative effects on osteoclastogenesis. Importantly, treatment of LY294002 (an inhibitor of the PI3K/Akt pathway) attenuated miR-17-5p-mediated osteoclastogenesis effects. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that miR-17-5p promotes osteoclastogenesis through the PI3K/Akt pathway via targeting PTEN in lung cancer.

Abstract: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its more advanced stages, Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and Cirrhosis, are the most common liver diseases in the worldwide, especially in developing countries. NAFLD is distinguished by the accumulation of triglycerides within hepatocytes. An increasing body of evidence suggests that hepatic MicroRNAs play an important role in NAFLD by controlling lipid metabolism, inflammation, and fibrosis. However, the precise causative functions of miRNA in NAFLD remain unknown. Here, we discovered that mice lacking MicroRNA-23b developed NAFLD-like phenotypes such as increased serum triglyceride and lipid droplet accumulation. In db/db mice fed a high fat diet, MicroRNA-23b overexpression reduced liver weight and alleviated liver inflammation, apoptosis, and fibrosis. MicroRNA-23b regulates the acyl-CoA metabolic process via Acyl-CoA thioesterase 4 (Acot4), which interacts with Acetyl CoA Carboxylase (ACC), according to the RNA-seq analysis.

Abstract: Background
Mutations at sites crucial for the interaction between RAD51 and BRC domains impair the ability of BRCA2 homologous recombination. We aimed to clarify whether BRCA2 BRC domain-associated mutation correlates with sensibility of platinum-based chemotherapy and survival in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC).
Methods
We identified BRCA2 BRC domain mutations by sequencing PCR-amplified amplicons of genomic DNA isolated from tumor tissues and peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL)in 113 patients with advanced EOC, and assessed platinum-free interval (PFI), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
Results
21.23% (24 of 113) cases with somatic missense mutation but not germline mutation were identified. Among 24 cases with mutation, 33.3% (8 of 24) cases with nonsense mutation (C-terminal truncation) significantly prolonged median PFI (37 vs 8 months,P = 0.000), PFS (43 vs 14 months, p = 0.000) and OS (56 vs 31 months, P = 0.002); 66.7% (16 of 24) cases with missense mutation also prolonged median PFI (15 vs 8 months, P = 0.044), PFS (21 vs 14 months, P = 0.049) and OS (38 vs 31 months, P = 0.037), compared to those without any mutation.
Conclusions
Somatic mutations in BRCA2 BRC domain confer a higher sensitivity to platinum-based therapy and are associated with a favourable survival in HGSOC.

Abstract: Tripartite motif containing 16 (TRIM16) is a member of the tripartite motif protein family and functions as a potential tumor suppressor in several cancers. However, the specific function and clinical significance of TRIM16 in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unclear. In this study, we observed that low TRIM16 expression was detected frequently in primary colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues and was closely associated with a better prognosis. Functional studies demonstrate that TRIM16 overexpression notably inhibits the metastasis abilities of CRC in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, our results demonstrated that TRIM16 directly bound and ubiquitinated Snail family transcriptional repressor 1 (Snail), an important transcriptional factor of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process suppressing the EMT in CRC. Additionally, our data revealed that the inhibition effect of TRIM16 on cancer metastasis was dependent on Snail degradation. Collectively, our study is the first to report that TRIM16 plays a crucial anti-tumor role in CRC tumorigenesis. We also provided novel evidence that TRIM16 might act as a prognostic and therapeutic target to assess and inhibit CRC progression.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the leading deadly cancer worldwide. Gene associated with retinoid-IFN-induced mortality-19 (GRIM-19), a novel tumor suppressor, has been reported to be expressed at low levels in human CRC. However, the role of GRIM-19 in CRC progression and the corresponding detailed mechanisms are unclear. The results of this study indicated that GRIM-19 expression is related to CRC progression. Overexpression of GRIM-19 was found to inhibit CRC cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrated that GRIM-19 suppresses CRC through posttranslational regulation of p53, in which SIRT7 is activated by GRIM-19 and triggers PCAF-mediated MDM2 ubiquitination, eventually stabilizing the p53 protein. We also observed that GRIM-19 enhances the effect of oxaliplatin against CRC. In conclusion, GRIM-19 plays an important role in CRC development and is a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for clinical treatment of CRC.

Abstract: Summary
Anti-integrins are therapeutically effective for inflammatory bowel disease, yet the relative contribution of α4β7 and αEβ7 to gut lymphocyte trafficking is not fully elucidated. Here, we evaluate the effect of α4β7 and αEβ7 blockade using a combination of murine models of gut trafficking and longitudinal gene expression analysis in etrolizumab-treated patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Dual blockade of α4β7 and αEβ7 reduces CD8+ T cell accumulation in the gut to a greater extent than blockade of either integrin alone. Anti-αEβ7 reduces epithelial:T cell interactions and promotes egress of activated T cells from the mucosa into lymphatics. Inflammatory gene expression is greater in human intestinal αEβ7+ T cells. Etrolizumab-treated patients with CD display a treatment-specific reduction in inflammatory and cytotoxic intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) genes. Concurrent blockade of α4β7 and αEβ7 promotes reduction of cytotoxic IELs and inflammatory T cells in the gut mucosa through a stepwise inhibition of intestinal tissue entry and retention.

Abstract: Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a severe retinal dysfunction in prematurely born babies. The relationship between non-coding RNAs and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) remain unclear. Microarray analysis of lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs was conducted in a mouse model of ROP. A competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network was constructed. The relationship among MALAT1, miR-124–3p, and Early growth response protein 1 (EGR1) was assessed in hypoxia-induced primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and ROP mouse model. In the study, we found 2252 lncRNAs, 1239 mRNAs, and 36 miRNAs were differentially regulated. ceRNA network consisting of 21 lncRNAs, 10 miRNAs, and 19 mRNAs was established. Of the most down-regulated miRNAs, miR-124–3p was selected for additional study. miR-124–3p ceased the migration and proliferation of primary HUVECs in hypoxic conditions, and directly suppressed EGR1. Additionally, MALAT1 directly sponged miR-124–3p. Knockdown of MALAT1 decreased EGR1 expression and inhibited the migration and proliferation of primary HUVECs in hypoxia. Furthermore, these changes were rescued by depletion of miR-124–3p. In vivo, intravitreal injection of miR-124–3p, shMALAT1 decreased EGR1 expression and markedly suppressed retinal neovascularization in OIR models. Intravitreal injection of shMALAT1 and miR-124–3p antagomir at the same time can promote retinal neovascularization, which reversed the suppression of retinal neovascularization functioned by shMALAT1. In conclusion, the expression profiles of lncRNAs and miRNAs and the ceRNA network in a mouse model of ROP may be indicative of the underlying mechanisms of retinal angiogenesis and neural activity. The MALAT1/miR-124–3p/EGR1 regulatory axis is partly responsible for retinal neovascularization, which may provide a novel theoretical basis for the pathogenesis of ROP.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is often caused by an adenine to guanine variant at m.3243 (m.3243A>G) of the MT-TL1 gene. To understand how this pathogenic variant affects the nervous system, we differentiated human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into excitatory neurons with normal (low heteroplasmy) and impaired (high heteroplasmy) mitochondrial function from MELAS patients with the m.3243A>G pathogenic variant. We combined micro-electrode array (MEA) measurements with RNA sequencing (MEA-seq) and found reduced expression of genes involved in mitochondrial respiration and presynaptic function, as well as non-cell autonomous processes in co-cultured astrocytes. Finally, we show that the clinical phase II drug sonlicromanol can improve neuronal network activity when treatment is initiated early in development. This was intricately linked with changes in the neuronal transcriptome. Overall, we provide insight in transcriptomic changes in iPSC-derived neurons with high m.3243A>G heteroplasmy, and show the pathology is partially reversible by sonlicromanol.

Abstract: Summary
Donor-to-donor variability in primary human organoid cultures has not been well characterized. As these cultures contain multiple cell types, there is greater concern that variability could lead to increased noise. In this work we investigated donor-to-donor variability in human gut adult stem cell (ASC) organoids. We examined intestinal developmental pathways during culture differentiation in ileum- and colon-derived cultures established from multiple donors, showing that differentiation patterns were consistent among cultures. This finding indicates that donor-to-donor variability in this system remains at a manageable level. Intestinal metabolic activity was evaluated by targeted analysis of central carbon metabolites and by analyzing hormone production patterns. Both experiments demonstrated similar metabolic functions among donors. Importantly, this activity reflected intestinal biology, indicating that these ASC organoid cultures are appropriate for studying metabolic processes. This work establishes a framework for generating high-confidence data using human primary cultures through thorough characterization of variability.

Abstract: Summary
Engineered synthetic biomolecular devices that integrate elaborate information processing and precisely regulate living cell behavior have potential in various applications. Although devices that directly regulate key biomolecules constituting inherent biological systems exist, no devices have been developed to control intracellular membrane architecture, contributing to the spatiotemporal functions of these biomolecules. This study developed a synthetic biomolecular device, termed inducible counter mitochondrial morphology (iCMM), to manipulate mitochondrial morphology, an emerging informative property for understanding physiopathological cellular behaviors, on a minute timescale by using a chemically inducible dimerization system. Using iCMM, we determined cellular changes by altering mitochondrial morphology in an unprecedented manner. This approach serves as a platform for developing more sophisticated synthetic biomolecular devices to regulate biological systems by extending manipulation targets from conventional biomolecules to mitochondria. Furthermore, iCMM might serve as a tool for uncovering the biological significance of mitochondrial morphology in various physiopathological cellular processes.

Abstract: Summary
Attachment of sugars to nitrogen and oxygen in peptides is ubiquitous in biology, but glycosylation of sulfur atoms has only been recently described. Here, we characterize two S-glycosyltransferases SunS and ThuS that selectively glycosylate one of five Cys residues in their substrate peptides; substitution of this Cys with Ser results in a strong decrease in glycosylation activity. Crystal structures of SunS and ThuS in complex with UDP-glucose or a derivative reveal an unusual architecture in which a glycosyltransferase type A (GTA) fold is decorated with additional domains to support homodimerization. Dimer formation creates an extended cavity for the substrate peptide, drawing functional analogy with O-glycosyltransferases involved in cell wall biosynthesis. This extended cavity contains a sharp bend that may explain the site selectivity of the glycosylation because the target Cys is in a Gly-rich stretch that can accommodate the bend. These studies establish a molecular framework for understanding the unusual S-glycosyltransferases.

Abstract: Summary
Tumors are dynamic ecosystems comprising localized niches (microdomains), possessing distinct compositions and spatial configurations of cancer and non-cancer cell populations. Microdomain-specific network signaling coevolves with a continuum of cell states and functional plasticity associated with disease progression and therapeutic responses. We present LEAPH, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm for identifying cell phenotypes, which applies recursive steps of probabilistic clustering and spatial regularization to derive functional phenotypes (FPs) along a continuum. Combining LEAPH with pointwise mutual information and network biology analyses enables the discovery of outcome-associated microdomains visualized as distinct spatial configurations of heterogeneous FPs. Utilization of an immunofluorescence-based (51 biomarkers) image dataset of colorectal carcinoma primary tumors (n = 213) revealed microdomain-specific network dysregulation supporting cancer stem cell maintenance and immunosuppression that associated selectively with the recurrence phenotype. LEAPH enables an explainable artificial intelligence platform providing insights into pathophysiological mechanisms and novel drug targets to inform personalized therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Ticks are obligate hematophagous arthropods. Blood feeding ensures that ticks obtain nutrients essential for their survival, development, and reproduction while providing routes for pathogen transmission. However, the effectors that determine tick feeding activities remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that reduced abundance of the symbiont Coxiella (CHI) in Haemaphysalis longicornis decreases blood intake. Providing tetracycline-treated ticks with the CHI-derived tryptophan precursor chorismate, tryptophan, or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin) restores the feeding defect. Mechanistically, CHI-derived chorismate increases tick 5-HT biosynthesis by stimulating the expression of aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD), which catalyzes the decarboxylation of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) to 5-HT. The increased level of 5-HT in the synganglion and midgut promotes tick feeding. Inhibition of CHI chorismate biosynthesis by treating the colonized tick with the herbicide glyphosate suppresses blood-feeding behavior. Taken together, our results demonstrate an important function of the endosymbiont Coxiella in the regulation of tick 5-HT biosynthesis and feeding.

Abstract: Summary
The pathogenicity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been attributed to its ability to enter through the membrane-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Therefore, it has been heavily speculated that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy may modulate SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, exposure of human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) and human endothelial cells (hECs) to SARS-CoV-2 identified significant differences in protein coding genes involved in immunity, viral response, and cardiomyocyte/endothelial structure. Specifically, transcriptome changes were identified in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interferon α/β, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (hPSC-CMs) as well as nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) (hECs) signaling pathways. However, pre-treatment of hPSC-CMs or hECs with two widely prescribed antihypertensive medications, losartan and lisinopril, did not affect the susceptibility of either cell type to SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings demonstrate the toxic effects of SARS-CoV-2 in hPSC-CMs/hECs and, taken together with newly emerging multicenter trials, suggest that antihypertensive drug treatment alone does not alter SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Abstract: The yield and quality of the skeletal muscle are important economic traits in livestock and poultry production. The musculoskeletal embryonic nuclear protein 1 (MUSTN1) gene has been shown to be associated with embryonic development, postnatal growth, bone and skeletal muscle regeneration; however, its function in the skeletal muscle development of chicken remains unclear. Therefore, in this study, we observed that the expression level of MUSTN1 increased in conjunction with the proliferation of chicken skeletal muscle satellite cells (SMSCs). Knockdown of MUSTN1 in SMSCs downregulated the expression of cell proliferation genes as Pax7, CDK-2 and differentiation-relate genes including MyoD, MyoG, MyHC and MyH1B, whereas it upregulates the expression of cell apoptosis gene (Caspase-3) (P < 0.05). However, the combined analysis of CCK-8 and EdU showed that the cell vitality and EdU-positive cells of the si-MUSTN1 transfected group were significantly lower than those of the negative siRNA group (P < 0.05). In addition, the knockdown of MUSTN1 significantly increased the cell population in the G0/G1 phase and significantly decreased the cell population in the G2/M phase (P < 0.05), whereas the overexpression of MUSTN1 showed opposite effect. Taken together, our findings indicates that MUSTN1 is an important molecular factor that is responsible for regulating muscle growth and development in chickens, particularly, proliferation and differentiation of SMSCs.

Abstract: The miR-10b-5p plays an important role in gastric cancer development but its exact effect on gastric cancer development in vivo has not been fully studied. We showed that miR-10b-5p inhibited the proliferation and migration of gastric cancer cells by down-regulating Tiam1 which was up-regulated in both gastric cancer cells and tissues. Gastric cancer xenograft experiment showed that lenti-miR-10b-5p treatment and agomir-10b-5p injection could significantly retard tumor growth and reduce tumor size and induced apoptosis. Therefore, our results elucidate the tumor suppressor role of miR-10b-5p in gastric cancer in which it acts as a negative regulator of Tiam1 and also provide a molecular mechanism for agomir-10b-5p to treat gastric cancer.

Abstract: Podocytes constitute the outer layer of the renal glomerular filtration barrier. Their energy requirements strongly depend on efficient oxidative respiration, which is tightly connected with mitochondrial dynamics. We hypothesized that hyperglycemia modulates energy metabolism in glomeruli and podocytes and contributes to the development of diabetic kidney disease. We found that oxygen consumption rates were severely reduced in glomeruli from diabetic rats and in human podocytes that were cultured in high glucose concentration (30 mM; HG). In these models, all of the mitochondrial respiratory parameters, including basal and maximal respiration, ATP production, and spare respiratory capacity, were significantly decreased. Podocytes that were treated with HG showed a fragmented mitochondrial network, together with a decrease in expression of the mitochondrial fusion markers MFN1, MFN2, and OPA1, and an increase in the activity of the fission marker DRP1. We showed that markers of mitochondrial biogenesis, such as PGC-1α and TFAM, decreased in HG-treated podocytes. Moreover, PINK1/parkin-dependent mitophagy was inhibited in these cells. These results provide evidence that hyperglycemia impairs mitochondrial dynamics and turnover, which may underlie the remarkable deterioration of mitochondrial respiration parameters in glomeruli and podocytes.

Abstract: Integrin receptors are transmembrane proteins that bind to the extracellular matrix (ECM). In most animal cell types integrins cluster together with adaptor proteins at focal adhesions that sense and respond to external mechanical signals. In the central nervous system (CNS), ECM proteins are sparsely distributed, the tissue is comparatively soft and neurons do not form focal adhesions. Thus, how neurons sense tissue stiffness is currently poorly understood. Here, we found that integrins and the integrin-associated proteins talin and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) are required for the outgrowth of neuronal processes. Vinculin, however, whilst not required for neurite outgrowth was a key regulator of integrin-mediated mechanosensing of neurons. During growth, growth cones of axons of CNS derived cells exerted dynamic stresses of around 10–12 Pa on their environment, and axons grew significantly longer on soft (0.4 kPa) compared to stiff (8 kPa) substrates. Depletion of vinculin blocked this ability of growth cones to distinguish between soft and stiff substrates. These data suggest that vinculin in neurons acts as a key mechanosensor, involved in the regulation of growth cone motility.

Abstract: Summary
Micro-electrode arrays (MEAs) are increasingly used to characterize neuronal network activity of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neurons. Despite their gain in popularity, MEA recordings from hiPSC-derived neuronal networks are not always used to their full potential in respect to experimental design, execution, and data analysis. Therefore, we benchmarked the robustness of MEA-derived neuronal activity patterns from ten healthy individual control lines, and uncover comparable network phenotypes. To achieve standardization, we provide recommendations on experimental design and analysis. With such standardization, MEAs can be used as a reliable platform to distinguish (disease-specific) network phenotypes. In conclusion, we show that MEAs are a powerful and robust tool to uncover functional neuronal network phenotypes from hiPSC-derived neuronal networks, and provide an important resource to advance the hiPSC field toward the use of MEAs for disease phenotyping and drug discovery.

Abstract: Human trophoblast stem cells (hTSC) can be isolated from first trimester placenta but not from term placenta. Here we demonstrate that villous cytotrophoblasts (vCTB) from term placenta can be reprogrammed into induced trophoblastic stem-like cells (iTSC) by introducing sets of transcription factors. The iTSCs express TSC markers such as GATA3, TEAD4 and ELF5, and are multipotent, validated by their differentiation into both extravillous trophoblasts (EVT) and syncytiotrophoblasts (STB) in vitro and in vivo. The iTSC can be passaged indefinitely in vitro without slowing of growth. The transcriptome profile of these cells closely resembles the profile of hTSC isolated from first trimester placentae but different from the term placental vCTB from which they originated. The ability to reprogram cells from term placenta into iTSC will allow study of early gestation events which impact placental function later in gestation, including preeclampsia and spontaneous preterm birth.

Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers and the leading cause of cancer death in women. MIER3 (Mesoderm induction early response 1, family member3) is considered as a potential oncogene for breast cancer. However, the role of MIER3 in breast cancer remain largely unknown. The expression of MIER3 was detected and the relationship between its expression and clinicopathological characteristics was also analyzed. The effect of MIER3 on proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells was detected in vitro and in vivo. Western blot, IF, and Co-IP were employed to detect the relationship between MIER3, HDAC1, HDAC2, and Snail. ChIP assay was performed to determine the binding of MIER3/HDAC1/HDAC2/Snail complex to the promoter of E-cadherin. In this study, we found that MIER3 was upregulated in breast cancer tissue and closely associated with poor prognosis of patients. MIER3 could promote the proliferation, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of breast cancer cells. Further studies showed that MIER3 interacted with HDAC1/HDAC2 and Snail to form a repressive complex which could bind to E-cadherin promoter and was related to its deacetylation. Our study concluded that MIER3 was involved in forming a co-repressor complex with HDAC1/HDAC2/Snail to promote EMT by silencing E-cadherin.

Abstract: At present, there are still many poorly understood aspects of the mechanisms underlying hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) invasion and metastasis. Invadopodia are important structures for cancer cell invasion and metastasis. We determined that high T-lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1 (Tiam1) expression is associated with HCC invasion and metastasis and poor patient prognosis after surgery. Gain- and loss-of-function studies confirmed that Tiam1 promotes invadopodia formation in HCC by activating Rac1. A series of biochemical experiments confirmed that this effect is regulated by the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. We also confirmed that PIP2 facilitates this effect. In summary, these findings reveal that Tiam1 plays an important role in invadopodia formation in HCC.

Abstract: Duchene muscular dystrophy leads to progressive muscle structural and functional decline due to chronic degenerative-regenerative cycles. Enhancing the regenerative capacity of dystrophic muscle provides potential therapeutic options. We previously demonstrated that the circadian clock repressor Rev-erbα inhibited myogenesis and Rev-erbα ablation enhanced muscle regeneration. Here we show that Rev-erbα deficiency in the dystrophin-deficient mdx mice promotes regenerative myogenic response to ameliorate muscle damage. Loss of Rev-erbα in mdx mice improved dystrophic pathology and muscle wasting. Rev-erbα-deficient dystrophic muscle exhibit augmented myogenic response, enhanced neo-myofiber formation and attenuated inflammatory response. In mdx myoblasts devoid of Rev-erbα, myogenic differentiation was augmented together with up-regulation of Wnt signaling and proliferative pathways, suggesting that loss of Rev-erbα inhibition of these processes contributed to the improvement in regenerative myogenesis. Collectively, our findings revealed that the loss of Rev-erbα function protects dystrophic muscle from injury by promoting myogenic repair, and inhibition of its activity may have therapeutic utilities for muscular dystrophy.

Abstract: Summary
Asymmetric inheritance of sister chromatids has long been predicted to be linked to discordant fates of daughter cells and even hypothesized to minimize accumulation of mutations in stem cells. Here, we use (2′S)-2′-deoxy-2′-fluoro-5-ethynyluridine (F-ara-EdU), bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), and light sheet microscopy to track embryonic DNA in whole zebrafish. Larval development results in rapid depletion of older DNA template strands from stem cell niches in the retina, brain, and intestine. Prolonged label retention occurs in quiescent progenitors that resume replication in later development. High-resolution microscopy reveals no evidence of asymmetric template strand segregation in >100 daughter cell pairs, making it improbable that asymmetric DNA segregation prevents mutational burden according to the immortal strand hypothesis in developing zebrafish.

Abstract: Summary
Heart injury has been reported in up to 20% of COVID-19 patients, yet the cause of myocardial histopathology remains unknown. Here, using an established in vivo hamster model, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in cardiomyocytes of infected animals. Furthermore, we found damaged cardiomyocytes in hamsters and COVID-19 autopsy samples. To explore the mechanism, we show that both human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-derived CMs) and adult cardiomyocytes (CMs) can be productively infected by SARS-CoV-2, leading to secretion of the monocyte chemoattractant cytokine CCL2 and subsequent monocyte recruitment. Increased CCL2 expression and monocyte infiltration was also observed in the hearts of infected hamsters. Although infected CMs suffer damage, we find that the presence of macrophages significantly reduces SARS-CoV-2-infected CMs. Overall, our study provides direct evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infects CMs in vivo and suggests a mechanism of immune cell infiltration and histopathology in heart tissues of COVID-19 patients.

Abstract: Summary
RNA interference (RNAi) is an across-kingdom gene regulatory and defense mechanism. However, little is known about how organisms sense initial cues to mobilize RNAi. Here, we show that wounding to Nicotiana benthamiana cells during virus intrusion activates RNAi-related gene expression through calcium signaling. A rapid wound-induced elevation in calcium fluxes triggers calmodulin-dependent activation of calmodulin-binding transcription activator-3 (CAMTA3), which activates RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-6 and Bifunctional nuclease-2 (BN2) transcription. BN2 stabilizes mRNAs encoding key components of RNAi machinery, notably AGONAUTE1/2 and DICER-LIKE1, by degrading their cognate microRNAs. Consequently, multiple RNAi genes are primed for combating virus invasion. Calmodulin-, CAMTA3-, or BN2-knockdown/knockout plants show increased susceptibility to geminivirus, cucumovirus, and potyvirus. Notably, Geminivirus V2 protein can disrupt the calmodulin-CAMTA3 interaction to counteract RNAi defense. These findings link Ca2+ signaling to RNAi and reveal versatility of host antiviral defense and viral counter-defense.

Abstract: The imbalance between osteogenesis and adipogenesis in the bone marrow is the main characteristic of osteoporosis (OP). Thus, exploring regulation of the differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) into osteoblasts and adipocytes is important to identify novel targets for the treatment of OP. In the present study, the master regulator of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 5 (HSPA5) was shown to significantly accumulate in osteoblasts and adipocytes, but not in osteoclasts in bone sections from aged and postmenopausal OP mice. In vitro study revealed that HSPA5 negatively modulated osteogenic differentiation and positively promoted adipogenic differentiation, and that targeting HSPA5 with its inhibitor HA15 enhanced osteogenic differentiation and inhibited adipogenic differentiation. Also, HA15 treatment induces ER stress and autophagy, and decreases apoptosis in cells. We constructed a postmenopausal OP model in mice with ovariectomy surgery, and treated the mice with HA15. The results showed that HA15 treatment induced appropriate ER stress, activated autophagy and decreased apoptosis in osteoblasts, thereby alleviating bone loss in vivo. Our results indicated that HSPA5 participated in OP pathogenesis by regulating the differentiation of BMSCs. HSPA5 may serve as a new target for the treatment of OP, and targeting HSPA5 with HA15 prevents the progression of OP and provides a candidate therapeutic molecule for postmenopausal OP.

Abstract: The autophagy/apoptosis interaction has always been a focus of study in pathogenicity models. Neuritin is a neurotrophic factor that is highly expressed primarily in the central nervous system. Our previous study revealed that it protects against apoptosis in cortical neurons subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)/reoxygenation (OGD/R), and later animal experiments revealed that it can increase the expression of the autophagy-related protein LC3. Whether this neuroprotective effect is closely related to autophagy is still unclear. In this study, we hypothesized that neuritin can promote autophagic flux to protect nerve cells after OGD/R. To verify this hypothesis, we induced OGD/R in primary cortical neurons and assessed cell viability by the CCK8 and LDH assays. Cell apoptosis was assessed by Annexin V-FITC/PI, staining, and the contents and mRNA abundances of the autophagy-related proteins LC3 and p62, the apoptotic protein Caspase3 were quantified by Western blotting and RT-PCR. Autophagic flux was assessed by immunofluorescence after RFP-GFP-LC3 virus transfection, and ultrastructural changes in autophagosomes were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results showed that cell viability was decreased, apoptosis was increased and autophagy was enhanced after OGD/R. Neuritin significantly increased cell viability, decreased apoptosis, further increased the expression of the autophagic flux-related protein LC3, further decreased p62 expression, and significantly increased the autophagosome number and autophagosome to lysosome ratio. Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) is a late autophagy inhibitor, aggravated cell damage and apoptosis and counteracted the enhancement of autophagy activation and protective effects of neuritin. In conclusion, neuritin may promote the completion of autophagic flux by ameliorating neuronal damage after OGD/R.

Abstract: Summary
Multi-drug-resistant bacteria present an urgent threat to modern medicine, creating a desperate need for antibiotics with new modes of action. As natural products remain an unsurpassed source for clinically viable antibiotic compounds, we investigate the mechanism of action of armeniaspirol. The armeniaspirols are a structurally unique class of Gram-positive antibiotic discovered from Streptomyces armeniacus for which resistance cannot be readily obtained. We show that armeniaspirol inhibits the ATP-dependent proteases ClpXP and ClpYQ in vitro and in the model Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis. This inhibition dysregulates the divisome and elongasome supported by an upregulation of key proteins FtsZ, DivIVA, and MreB inducing cell division arrest. The inhibition of ClpXP and ClpYQ to dysregulate cell division represents a unique antibiotic mechanism of action and armeniaspirol is the only known natural product inhibitor of the coveted anti-virulence target ClpP. Thus, armeniaspirol possesses a promising lead scaffold for antibiotic development with unique pharmacology.

Abstract: Objective
In order to provide regenerative therapy for millions of patients suffering from corneal blindness globally, we derived corneal endothelial cell substitute (CECSi) cells from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to treat corneal edema due to endothelial dysfunction (bullous keratopathy).
Methods and results
We developed an efficient xeno-free protocol to produce CECSi cells from both research grade (Ff-MH09s01 and Ff-I01s04) and clinical grade (QHJI01s04) iPSCs. CECSi cells formed a hexagonal confluent monolayer with Na, K-ATPase alpha 1 subunit expression (ATP1A1), tight junctions, N-cadherin adherence junction formation, and nuclear PITX2 expression, which are all characteristics of corneal endothelial cells. CECSi cells can be cryopreserved, and thawed CECSi cell suspensions also expressed N-cadherin and ATP1A1. Residual undifferentiated iPSCs in QHJI01s04-derived CECSi cells was below 0.01%. Frozen stocks of Ff-I01s04- and QHJI01s04-derived CECSi cells were transported, thawed and transplanted into a monkey corneal edema model. CECSi-transplanted eyes significantly reduced corneal edema compared to control group.
Conclusion
Our results show a promising approach to provide bullous keratopathy patients with an iPS-cell-based cell therapy to recover useful vision.

Abstract: Ischemia reperfusion-induced acute kidney injury (IR-induced AKI) is a life-threatening disease with many complications. Mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) ubiquitination is related to AKI. But the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. This study aimed to probe the mechanism of Mfn2 ubiquitination in IR-induced AKI development. In IR-induced AKI mouse models, orbital blood and urine were collected for assessing kidney function. The kidney injury, ultrastructure of mitochondria, and histopathology in mice were evaluated after injection of G5, an ubiquitination inhibitor. Oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) models were established in HK-2 cells, and the mitochondria were extracted. Cell viability, apoptosis, oxidative stress, inflammatory reaction, mitochondrial membrane potential, and ATP production were measured. Mfn2 ubiquitination in mouse and cell models was evaluated. si-SIRT3 and pcDNA3.1-SIRT3 were transfected into cell models. Consequently, kidney function in mice was impaired by IR-induced AKI. Mfn2 ubiquitination and degradation promoted IR-induced AKI. OGD/R induced renal tubular epithelial cell injury and disrupted mitochondrial dynamics and functions through promoting Mfn2 ubiquitination. SIRT3 knockdown led to Mfn2 ubiquitination by binding to UBC; while its overexpression alleviated tubular epithelial cell injury. Briefly, SIRT3 mediates Mfn2 ubiquitination to relieve IR-induced AKI. This investigation may offer new insights for the treatment of IR-induced AKI injury.

Abstract: HSPB5 (heat shock protein B5), also known as αB-crystallin, is one of the most widespread and populous of the ten human small heat shock proteins (sHsps). Over the past decades, extensive research has been conducted on HSPB5. However, few studies have statistically analyzed these publications. Herein, we conducted a bibliometric analysis to track the global research trend and current development status of HSPB5 research from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database between 1985 and 2020. Our results demonstrate that 1220 original articles cited 54,778 times in 391 scholarly journals were published. Visualization analyses reveal that the Journal of Biological Chemistry was the most influential journal with 85 articles. The USA dominated this field with 520 publications (42.62%), followed by Japan with 149 publications (12.21%), and Kato contributed the largest number of publications. Most related publications were published in journals focusing on biochemistry molecular biology, cell biology, neurosciences neurology, and ophthalmology. In addition, keyword co-occurrence analyses identify three predominant research topics: expression of HSPB5, chaperone studies for HSPB5, and pathological studies of HSPB5. This study provides valuable guidance for researchers and leads to collaborative opportunities between diverse research interests to be integrated for HSPB5 research.

Abstract: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) originates in the nasopharynx epithelium. Although concurrent chemoradiation therapy followed by chemotherapy is considered as an effective treatment, there is substantial drug resistance in locally advanced NPC patients. One major contributor to the chemoresistance includes aberrant expression of cell adhesion molecules, such as integrin α and β subunits, giving rise to cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of integrin α5 on the development of intrinsic cisplatin resistance in NPC and the associated underlying mechanisms using in vitro three-dimensional (3D) spheroid models, as well as induced cisplatin-resistant NPC (NPCcisR). We demonstrated that established 3D highly- (5-8F) and lowly- (6-10B) metastatic NPC spheroids overexpressed integrin α5 and aggravated their resistance to cisplatin. Besides, enhanced integrin α5 resulted in substantially reduced growth, corresponding to G0/G1 and G2/M cell cycle arrest. In addition, 5-8FcisR and 6-10BcisR cells in 3D forms synergistically strengthened endurance of their spheroids to cisplatin treatment as observed by increased resistance index (RI) and decreased apoptosis. Mechanistically, the aberrantly expressed integrin α5 decreased drug susceptibility in NPC spheroids by inactivating ERK and inhibition of caspase-3 inducing apoptosis. Furthermore, the effect of integrin α5 inducing intrinsic resistance was verified via treatment with ATN-161, a peptide inhibitor for integrin α5β1. The results showed dramatic reduction in integrin α5 expression, reversal of ERK phosphorylation and caspase-3 cleavage, together with elevated cisplatin sensitivity, indicating regulation of innate drug resistance via integrin α5. Taken together, our findings suggest that integrin α5 could act as a promising target to enhance the chemotherapeutic sensitivity in NPC.

Abstract: Summary
Bacterial ADP-ribosyltransferases (ADPRTs) have been described as toxins involved in pathogenesis through the modification of host proteins. Here, we report that ADPRTs are not pathogen restricted but widely prevalent in the human gut microbiome and often associated with phage elements. We validated their biochemical activity in a large clinical isolate collection and further examined Bxa, a highly abundant ADPRT in Bacteroides. Bxa is expressed, secreted, and enzymatically active in Bacteroides and can ADP-ribosylate non-muscle myosin II proteins. Addition of Bxa to epithelial cells remodeled the actin cytoskeleton and induced secretion of inosine. Bxa-encoding B. stercoris can use inosine as a carbon source and colonizes the gut to significantly greater numbers than a bxa-deleted strain in germ-free and altered Schaedler flora (ASF) mice. Colonization correlated with increased inosine concentrations in the feces and tissues. Altogether, our results show that ADPRTs are abundant in the microbiome and act as bacterial fitness factors.

Abstract: Apelin receptor (APJ), a member of family A of the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), is a potential pharmaceutical target for diseases of the nervous system. Our previous work revealed that human APJ can form a homodimer that has different functional characteristics than the monomer. To investigate the effects of APJ homodimers on neuroprotection in vascular dementia (VD), we established VD model in rats and treated the animals by injecting apelin-13 into the lateral ventricle. In addition, we established an oxygen–glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model in SH-SY5Y cells treated with apelin-13. After apelin-13 stimulation in the VD rat, the level of APJ and APJ homodimer were elevated. Furthermore, APJ homodimer decreased the level of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-9 via the Gαi3 and Gαq signaling pathway, thereby increasing the number of neurons and inhibiting apoptosis. Consequently, APJ homodimers may serve as a unique mechanism for neuroprotection against VD and provide new pharmaceutical targets for VD.

Abstract: Summary
Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies that activate Fc-mediated immune functions have been correlated with vaccine efficacy, but it is difficult to unravel the relative roles of multiple IgG and Fc receptor (FcR) features that have the capacity to influence IgG-FcR complex formation but vary on a personalized basis. Here, we develop an ordinary differential-equation model to determine how personalized variability in IgG subclass concentrations and binding affinities influence IgG-FcγRIIIa complex formation and validate it with samples from the HIV RV144 vaccine trial. The model identifies individuals who are sensitive, insensitive, or negatively affected by increases in HIV-specific IgG1, which is validated with the addition of HIV-specific IgG1 monoclonal antibodies to vaccine samples. IgG1 affinity to FcγRIIIa is also prioritized as the most influential parameter for dictating activation broadly across a population. Overall, this work presents a quantitative tool for evaluating personalized differences underlying FcR activation, which is relevant to ongoing efforts to improve vaccine efficacy.

Abstract: Summary
Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a rare disease associated with high morbidity and mortality. Existing evidence suggests that the central pathogenesis to aHUS might be endothelial cell damage. Nevertheless, the role of endothelial cell alterations in aHUS has not been well characterized and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Utilizing an induced pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cell (iPSC-EC) model, we showed that anti-complement factor H autoantibody-associated aHUS patient-specific iPSC-ECs exhibited an intrinsic defect in endothelial functions. Stimulation using aHUS serums exacerbated endothelial dysfunctions, leading to cell apoptosis in iPSC-ECs. Importantly, we identified p38 as a novel signaling pathway contributing to endothelial dysfunctions in aHUS. These results illustrate that iPSC-ECs can be a reliable model to recapitulate EC pathological features, thus providing a unique platform for gaining mechanistic insights into EC injury in aHUS. Our findings highlight that the p38 MAPK signaling pathway can be a therapeutic target for treatment of aHUS.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription of many genes in metazoans is subject to polymerase pausing, which is the transient stop of transcriptionally engaged polymerases. This is known to mainly occur in promoter-proximal regions but it is not well understood. In particular, a genome-wide measurement of pausing times at high resolution has been lacking. We present here the time-variant precision nuclear run-on and sequencing (TV-PRO-seq) assay, an extension of the standard PRO-seq that allows us to estimate genome-wide pausing times at single-base resolution. Its application to human cells demonstrates that, proximal to promoters, polymerases pause more frequently but for shorter times than in other genomic regions. Comparison with single-cell gene expression data reveals that the polymerase pausing times are longer in highly expressed genes, while transcriptionally noisier genes have higher pausing frequencies and slightly longer pausing times. Analyses of histone modifications suggest that the marker H3K36me3 is related to the polymerase pausing.

To fill the prevailing gap in methodology for whole spinal cord (SC) analysis, we have (1) designed scaffolds (SpineRacks) that facilitate efficient and ordered cryo-sectioning of the entire SC in a single block, (2) constructed a 3D reference atlas of adult mouse SC, and (3) developed software (SpinalJ) to register images of sections and for standardized analysis of cells and projections in atlas space. We have verified mapping accuracies for known neurons and demonstrated the usefulness of this platform to reveal unknown neuronal distributions. Together, these tools provide high-throughput analyses of whole mouse SC and enable direct comparison of 3D spatial information between animals and studies.

Abstract: As an important mechanical cue in the extracellular microenvironment, osmotic stress directly affects the proliferation, migration, and differentiation of cells. In this paper, we focused on the influence of hypertonic pressure on the colony morphology, stemness, and self-renew of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Our results showed that culture media with hypertonic pressure are more conducive to the maintenance of 3D colony morphology and pluripotency of mESCs after withdrawing the glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) inhibitor CHIR99021 and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD0325901 (hereinafter referred to as 2i) for 48 h. Furthermore, we revealed the microscopic mechanisms of the this finding: hypertonic pressure resulted in the depolymerization of F-actin cytoskeleton and limits Yes-associated protein (hereinafter referred to as YAP) transmission into the nucleus which play a vital role in the regulation of cell proliferation, and resulting in cell-cycle arrest at last.

Abstract: Atherosclerosis is the underlying contributing factor of cardiovascular disease, which is a process of inflammation and lipid-rich lesion. Macrophage-derived foam cell is a key hallmark of atherosclerosis and connected with various factors of lipid metabolism. Here, we showed that fatty acid binding protein 3 (FABP3) was upregulated in the aorta of ApoE−/- mice with high-fat-diet (HFD) feeding. Knockdown of FABP3 in HFD-fed ApoE−/- mice notably facilitated cholesterol efflux, inhibited macrophage foam cell formation, and thus prevented atherogenesis. Furthermore, FABP3 silencing decreased the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ). Mechanistic studies had disclosed the involvement of PPARγ signaling in balancing cholesterol uptake and efflux and diminishing foam cell formation. These findings firstly revealed an anti-atherogenic role of FABP3 silencing in preventing foamy macrophage formation partly through PPARγ, which might be a beneficial approach for therapying atherosclerosis.

Abstract: CDKN1A/P21 is a potent inhibitor of cell cycle progression and its overexpression is thought to be associated with inhibition of normal bone regenerative osteogenesis during spaceflight. To test whether CDKN1A/P21 regulates osteogenesis in response to mechanical loading we studied cyclic stretch versus static culture of Cdkn1a-/- (null) or wildtype primary mouse bone marrow osteoprogenitors during 21-day ex-vivo mineralization assays. Cyclically stretched Cdkn1a-/- cells are 3.95-fold more proliferative than wildtype, while static Cdkn1a-/- cells show a 2.50-fold increase. Furthermore, stage-specific single cell RNAseq analyses show expression of Cdkn1a is strongly suppressed by cyclic stretch in early and late osteoblasts, and minimally in the progenitor population. Lastly, both stretch and/or Cdkn1a deletion cause population shift from osteoprogenitors to osteoblasts, also indicating increased differentiation. Collectively, our results support the hypothesis that Cdkn1a constitutively plays a mechano-reversible anti-proliferative role during osteogenesis and suggests a new molecular target to counter regenerative deficits caused by disuse.

Abstract: Summary
Evidence linking the gut-brain axis to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is accumulating, but the characteristics of causally important microbes are poorly understood. We perform a fecal microbiome analysis in healthy subjects and those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. We find that Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (F. prausnitzii) correlates with cognitive scores and decreases in the MCI group compared with the healthy group. Two isolated strains from the healthy group, live Fp360 and pasteurized Fp14, improve cognitive impairment in an AD mouse model. Whole-genome comparison of isolated strains reveals specific orthologs that are found only in the effective strains and are more abundant in the healthy group compared with the MCI group. Metabolome and RNA sequencing analyses of mouse brains provides mechanistic insights into the relationship between the efficacy of pasteurized Fp14, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial function. We conclude that F. prausnitzii strains with these specific orthologs are candidates for gut microbiome-based intervention in Alzheimer's-type dementia.
