Abstract: Mx proteins are evolutionarily conserved dynamin-like large GTPases involved in viral resistance triggered by types I and III interferons. The human MxA is a cytoplasmic protein that confers resistance to a large number of viruses. The MxA protein is also known to self-assembly into high molecular weight homo-oligomers. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified 27 MxA binding partners, some of which are related to the SUMOylation machinery. The interaction of MxA with Small-Ubiquitin MOdifier 1 (SUMO1) and Ubiquitin conjugating enzyme 9 (Ubc9) was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization by confocal microscopy. We identified one SUMO conjugation site at lysine 48 and two putative SUMO interacting motifs (SIMa and SIMb). We showed that MxA interacts with the EIL loop of SUMO1 in a SIM-independent manner via its CID–GED domain. The yeast two-hybrid mapping also revealed that Ubc9 binds to the MxA GTPase domain. Mutation in the putative SIMa and SIMb, which are located in the GTPase binding domain, reduced MxA antiviral activity. In addition, we showed that MxA can be conjugated to SUMO2 or SUMO3 at lysine 48 and that the SUMOylation-deficient mutant of MxA (MxAK48R) retained its capacity to oligomerize and to inhibit Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) and Influenza A Virus replication, suggesting that MxA SUMOylation is not essential for its antiviral activity.

Abstract: Lipid metabolism depends on lipid droplets (LD), cytoplasmic structures surrounded by a protein-rich phospholipid monolayer. Although lipid synthesis is the hallmark of sebaceous gland cell differentiation, the LD-associated proteins of sebocytes have not been evaluated systematically. The LD fraction of SZ95 sebocytes was collected by density gradient centrifugation and associated proteins were analyzed by nanoliquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. 54 proteins were significantly enriched in LD fractions, and 6 of them have not been detected previously in LDs. LD fractions contained high levels of typical LD-associated proteins as PLIN2/PLIN3, and most proteins belonged to functional categories characteristic for LD-associated proteins, indicating a reliable dataset. After confirming expression of transcripts encoding the six previously unidentified proteins by qRT-PCR in SZ95 sebocytes and in another sebocyte line (SebE6E7), we focused on two of these proteins, ALDH1A3 and EPHX4. While EPHX4 was localized almost exclusively on the surface of LDs, ALDH1A3 showed a more widespread localization that included additional cytoplasmic structures. siRNA-mediated downregulation revealed that depletion of EPHX4 increases LD size and sebaceous lipogenesis. Further studies on the roles of these proteins in sebocyte physiology and sebaceous lipogenesis may indicate novel strategies for the therapy of sebaceous gland-associated diseases such as acne.

Abstract: SREBP-1 and mTOR have been proved to involve in renal lipid metabolism of diabetes mellitus. In the present study, we investigated the effect of co-regulation of SREBP-1 and mTOR on renal lipid metabolism using diabetic mice and cultured renal tubular cells. The results showed that compared with those in high glucose-stimulated HKC cells single transfected with shRNA-SREBP-1 vector, the level of SREBP-1 protein were significantly reduced by 64.1% followed by decreased FASN mRNA, ACC mRNA, ADRP protein and lipid droplets in HKC cells co-transfected with shRNA-SREBP-1 vector and kinase-dead mTOR vector. Furthermore, diabetic mice co-injected with shRNA-SREBP-1 vector and kinase-dead mTOR vector showed that renal SREBP-1 protein, FASN mRNA and ACC mRNA were respectively decreased by 34.6%, 45.9%, 22.0% in comparison with those in diabetic mice single injected with shRNA-SREBP-1 vector accompanied by reduced ADRP protein and triglyceride content. In the end our study suggests that co-regulation of SREBP-1 and mTOR in kidney of diabetic mice is more effective in lowering renal lipogenesis than only regulation of SREBP-1.

Abstract: Renal ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) is one of the main causes of the acute kidney injury (AKI) that usually occurs during clinical surgery. Autophagy plays an important role in recovery from acute ischemic kidney injury. MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) was reported to inhibit autophagy in several diseases. However, the molecular mechanism of miR-21 on autophagy during renal I/R is still unclear. For the in vitro study, NRK-52E cells were transfected with miR-21 mimics and subjected to I/R. Results showed that miR-21 mimics inhibited cell viability and induced cell apoptosis in NRK-52E cells. Expression of beclin-1 and LC3-II was induced, and p62 was decreased by I/R. miR-21 mimics inhibited this induction. RT-PCR and western blotting assay showed that miR-21 mimics inhibited the protein level of Rab11a, but not the mRNA level. A luciferase activity assay showed that miR-21 directly targeted Rab11a 3′-UTR. Rab11a overexpression attenuated the effect of miR-21 mimics and I/R on cell viability and cell apoptosis. The expression of beclin-1 and LC3-II was increased, and p62 was decreased by Rab11a overexpression. For the in vivo assay in a rat I/R model, the miR-21 level was increased during renal I/R injury. Pre-treatment with miR-21 inhibitor injection attenuated the renal injury, and enhanced expression of LC3-II and beclin-1. The results showed that miR-21 inhibited autophagy by targeting Rab11a in renal I/R, indicating that Rab11a might be a new medical target for the treatment of renal I/R.

Abstract: Stress-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of a variety of cardiovascular diseases. Our early studies showed that HSP70 effectively inhibited apoptosis, but the underlying mechanism remained unclear. Fas-associated factor 1 (FAF1) is a member of the Fas death-inducing signaling complex (Fas-DISC) that acts upstream of caspase-8. We investigated the interactions among FAF1, HSP70, and FAS in stressed cardiomyocytes to elucidate the protective mechanism of HSP70. FAS and caspase-3/8 activity was higher in cardiomyocytes undergoing stress-induced apoptosis in restraint-stressed rats compared with cardiomyocytes in non-stressed rats, which indicated that the Fas signaling pathway was activated after restraint stress. Geranylgeranylacetone (GGA) induced an increase in HSP70 expression, which reduced stress-induced apoptosis. Additionally, overexpression of HSP70 via transfection with the pEGFP-rHSP70 plasmid attenuated norepinephrine (NE)-induced apoptosis. FAF1 expression increased during stress-induced apoptosis, and overexpression of FAF1 exacerbated NE-induced apoptosis. We also found that HSP70 interacted with FAF1. Overexpression of HSP70 inhibited the binding of FAF1 to FAS in H9C2 cells, which indicated that HSP70 suppressed NE-induced apoptosis by competitively binding to FAF1. An N-terminal deletion mutant of HSP70 (HSP70-△N) was unable to interact with FAF1. After HSP70-△N was transfected into H9C2 cells, the cells were unable to attenuate the NE-induced increases in caspase-8 and apoptosis. These results indicate that the 1–120 sequence of HSP70 binds to FAF1, which alters the interactions between FAS and FAF1 and inhibits the activation of the Fas signaling pathway and apoptosis.

Abstract: The influence of high glucose solution on the chemical communication between cardiac cells was investigated in cell pairs isolated from the left ventricle of adult Wistar Kyoto rats. For this, Lucifer Yellow CH was dialyzed into one cell of the pair using the whole cell clamp technique, and the diffusion of dye in the dialyzed as well as in non-dialyzed cell, was followed by measuring the intensity of fluorescence in both cells as a function of time. The results indicated that: 1) high glucose solution (25mM) disrupted chemical communication between cardiac cells; 2) the effect of high glucose solution was reduced by Bis-1 (10−9M) which is a PKC inhibitor, and by enalapril (10−9M); 3) intracellular dialysis of Ang II (100nM) also caused dye uncoupling; 4) calculation of gap junction permeability (Pj) (cm/s) indicated a value of 3±0.07×10−5cm/s; n=32; (6 animals) for the controls and 0.4±0.86×10−6cm/s; n=35 (6 animals) (P<0.05) for cells incubated with high glucose solution for 24h; 5) measurements of Pj for cell pairs treated with hypertonic solution plus Bis-1 (10−9M) or enalapril maleate (10−9M) showed no significant change of Pj (P>0.05). Conclusions: high glucose (25mM) disrupts chemical communication between cardiac cells-an effect highly dependent on PKC activation. The possible role of enhanced intracellular Ang II levels induced by high glucose on the disruption of chemical communication was discussed as well as the possible implications of these findings for the diabetic heart.

Abstract: Summary
Microbiota-based prediction of chronic infections is promising yet not well established. Early childhood caries (ECC) is the most common infection in children. Here we simultaneously tracked microbiota development at plaque and saliva in 50 4-year-old preschoolers for 2 years; children either stayed healthy, transitioned into cariogenesis, or experienced caries exacerbation. Caries onset delayed microbiota development, which is otherwise correlated with aging in healthy children. Both plaque and saliva microbiota are more correlated with changes in ECC severity (dmfs) during onset than progression. By distinguishing between aging- and disease-associated taxa and exploiting the distinct microbiota dynamics between onset and progression, we developed a model, Microbial Indicators of Caries, to diagnose ECC from healthy samples with 70% accuracy and predict, with 81% accuracy, future ECC onsets for samples clinically perceived as healthy. Thus, caries onset in apparently healthy teeth can be predicted using microbiota, when appropriately de-trended for age.

Abstract: SIRT2 is a member of the mammalian sirtuin protein family, primarily found in the cytoplasm. It regulates numerous cellular processes including aging, DNA repair, cell cycle, and survival under stress conditions. However, the biological function and mechanism of the SIRT2 protein was not well understood in normal cells such as primary chondrocytes. In this study, we examined the effects of SIRT2 on differentiation and inflammation in rabbit articular chondrocytes by using a cell-permeative PEP-1-SIRT2 protein. Our results indicate that PEP-1-SIRT2-induced a loss of type II collagen and decreased sulfate proteoglycan levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner, as examined by Western blotting, alcian blue staining, and immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, PEP-1-SIRT2 caused an inflammatory response by inducing the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). In addition, after treatment with PEP-1-SIRT2, phosphorylation of both p38 and ERK was observed. Inhibition of ERK with PD98059 (PD) suppressed PEP-1-SIRT2-induced dedifferentiation and COX-2 expression. Reduction in PEP-1-SIRT2-induced inflammatory response was observed upon inhibition of p38 by SB203580 (SB). The same pattern was demonstrated in PEP-1-SIRT2-induced dedifferentiation and inflammatory response during culture with serial passages. During expansion to four passages, levels of type II collagen decreased, whereas levels of COX-2 and SIRT2 increased and activated ERK and p38. Furthermore, PEP-1-SIRT2 enhances dedifferentiation through the ERK pathway and inflammatory response through the ERK and p38 pathways in rabbit chondrocytes in vitro. These findings suggest that PEP-1-SIRT2 induces dedifferentiation via the ERK pathway and inflammation through the p38 and ERK pathways in rabbit articular chondrocytes.

Abstract: Summary
The host immune system functions constantly to maintain chronic commensal and pathogenic organisms in check. The consequences of these immune responses on host physiology are as yet unexplored, and may have long-term implications in health and disease. We show that chronic viral infection increases epithelial turnover in multiple tissues, and the antiviral cytokines type I interferons (IFNs) mediate this response. Using a murine model with persistently elevated type I IFNs in the absence of exogenous viral infection, the Irgm1−/− mouse, we demonstrate that type I IFNs act through nonepithelial cells, including macrophages, to promote increased epithelial turnover and wound repair. Downstream of type I IFN signaling, the highly related IFN-stimulated genes Apolipoprotein L9a and b activate epithelial proliferation through ERK activation. Our findings demonstrate that the host immune response to chronic viral infection has systemic effects on epithelial turnover through a myeloid-epithelial circuit.

Abstract: Summary
Systemic and local signals must be integrated by mammary stem and progenitor cells to regulate their cyclic growth and turnover in the adult gland. Here, we show RANK-positive luminal progenitors exhibiting WNT pathway activation are selectively expanded in the human breast during the progesterone-high menstrual phase. To investigate underlying mechanisms, we examined mouse models and found that loss of RANK prevents the proliferation of hormone receptor-negative luminal mammary progenitors and basal cells, an accompanying loss of WNT activation, and, hence, a suppression of lobuloalveologenesis. We also show that R-spondin1 is depleted in RANK-null progenitors, and that its exogenous administration rescues key aspects of RANK deficiency by reinstating a WNT response and mammary cell expansion. Our findings point to a novel role of RANK in dictating WNT responsiveness to mediate hormone-induced changes in the growth dynamics of adult mammary cells.

Angiotensin II-induced hypertensive renal inflammation is mediated through HMGB1-TLR4 signaling in rat tubulo-epithelial cells,

Abstract: Background and purpose
Angiotensin II is a vaso-constrictive peptide that regulates blood pressure homeostasis. Even though the inflammatory effects of AngII in renal pathophysiology have been studied, there still exists a paucity of data with regard to the mechanism of action of AngII-mediated kidney injury. The objective of this study was to elucidate the mechanistic role of HMGB1-TLR4 signaling in AngII-induced inflammation in the kidney.
Experimental approach
Rat tubular epithelial cells (NRK52E) were treated with AngII over a preset time-course. In another set of experiments, HMGB1 was neutralized and TLR4 was knocked down using small interfering RNA targeting TLR4. Cell extracts were subjected to RT-PCR, immunoblotting, flow cytometry, and ELISA.
Key results
AngII-induced inflammation in NRK52E cells increased gene and protein expression of TLR4, HMGB1 and key proinflammatory cytokines (TNFα and IL1β). Pretreatment with Losartan (an AT1 receptor blocker) attenuated the AngII-induced expression of TLR4 and inflammatory cytokines. TLR4 silencing was used to elucidate the specific role played by TLR4 in AngII-induced inflammation. TLR4siRNA treatment in these cells significantly decreased the AngII-induced inflammatory effect. Consistent observations were made when the Ang II treated cells were pretreated with anti-HMGB1. Downstream activation of NFκB and rate of generation of ROS was also decreased on gene silencing of TLR4 and exposure to anti-HMGB1.
Conclusions and implications
These results indicate a key role for HMGB1-TLR4 signaling in AngII-mediated inflammation in the renal epithelial cells. Our data also reveal that AngII-induced effects could be alleviated by HMGB1-TLR4 inhibition, suggesting this pathway as a potential therapeutic target for hypertensive renal dysfunctions.

Abstract: Among the many immunomodulatory and anti-tumor activities, IFN-γ up-regulates tumor cell death mediated by Fas receptor (FasR). Our and several other studies have demonstrated the involvement of trypsin-like proteases (TLPs) in the mode of action of IFN-γ. In the present study, we tried to unravel the role of serine proteases in IFN-γ induced Fas-mediated cell death. Our present results show that both tosyl-l-Lysine chloromethylketone (TLCK), a trypsin like protease inhibitor and tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethylketone (TPCK) – a chymotrypsin like protease (CLP) inhibitor, sensitize HeLa cells to Fas-mediated cell death. The combined effect of these protease inhibitors with anti-Fas was stronger than additive. In contrast, elastase inhibitor III (EI), which also contains the chloromethyl ketone moiety, was not active. Furthermore, co-addition of TLCK or TPCK with IFN-γ markedly enhanced Fas-induced cell death. IFN-γ led to up-regulation of FasR on its own, which was further enhanced by the co-addition of TLCK or TPCK. This was evident both by increased expression of Fas receptor on cell surface and by elevated Fas mRNA level. This study may provide the basis for the design of a novel combinatory therapeutic strategy that could enhance the eradication of tumors.

Abstract: Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) is involved in angiogenesis in both solid and hematological malignancies. In Multiple Myeloma (MM), serum Ang-2 correlates with disease progression and response to therapy. To address the patho-physiologic role of Ang-2 in MM associated angiogenesis, we used sera from patients with active MM, which contained significantly higher levels of the molecule, compared to those from patients with smoldering MM and Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance. MM Bone Marrow (BM) sera with high Ang-2 concentration specifically contributed to endothelial cell (EC) activation, while Ang-1 containing sera maintained EC stabilization. The functional dichotomy of Ang-1 and Ang-2 was confirmed by the triggering of distinctive signaling pathways down-stream the common Tie-2 receptor, i.e., the Akt or the ERK- phosphorylation pathway. Notably, Ang-2 but not VEGF serum levels correlated with BM micro-vessel density, further underscoring the key role of Ang-2 in angiogenesis. Western Blot, RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry identified MMEC as the major source of Ang-2, at variance with MM cells and CD14+ BM monocytes. These data suggest that Ang-2 produced in the BM milieu may contribute to MM angiogenesis and suggest that the molecule can be further exploited both as angiogenesis biomarker and as a potential therapeutic target.

Abstract: Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) play a key role in the dense desmoplastic stroma associated with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Studies on human PSCs have been minimal due to difficulty in maintaining primary PSC in culture. We have generated the first conditionally immortalized human non-tumor (NPSC) and tumor-derived (TPSC) pancreatic stellate cells via transformation with the temperature-sensitive SV40 large T antigen and human telomerase (hTERT). These cells proliferate at 33°C. After transfer to 37°C, the SV40LT is switched off and the cells regain their primary PSC phenotype and growth characteristics. NPSC contained cytoplasmic vitamin A-storing lipid droplets, while both NPSC and TPSC expressed the characteristic markers αSMA, vimentin, desmin and GFAP. Proteome array analysis revealed that of the 55 evaluated proteins, 27 (49%) were upregulated ≥3-fold in TPSC compared to NPSC, including uPA, pentraxin-3, endoglin and endothelin-1. Two insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) were inversely expressed. Although discordant IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3 levels, IGF-I was found to stimulate proliferation of both NPSC and TPSC. Both basal and IGF-I stimulated motility was significantly enhanced in TPSC compared to NPSC. In conclusion, these cells provide a unique resource that will facilitate further study of the active stroma compartment associated with pancreatic cancer.

Abstract: Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) have been identified in Jazf1, which is also involved in the oncogenesis of endometrial stromal tumors. To understand how Jazf1 variants confer a risk of tumorigenesis and T2D, we explored the functional roles of JAZF1 and searched for JAZF1 target genes in myogenic C2C12 cells. Consistent with an increase of Jazf1 transcripts during myoblast proliferation and their decrease during myogenic differentiation in regenerating skeletal muscle, JAZF1 overexpression promoted cell proliferation, whereas it retarded myogenic differentiation. Examination of myogenic genes revealed that JAZF1 overexpression transcriptionally repressed MEF2C and MRF4 and their downstream genes. AMP deaminase1 (AMPD1) was identified as a candidate for JAZF1 target by gene array analysis. However, promoter assays of Ampd1 demonstrated that mutation of the putative binding site for the TR4/JAZF1 complex did not alleviate the repressive effects of JAZF1 on promoter activity. Instead, JAZF1-mediated repression of Ampd1 occurred through the MEF2-binding site and E-box within the Ampd1 proximal regulatory elements. Consistently, MEF2C and MRF4 expression enhanced Ampd1 promoter activity. AMPD1 overexpression and JAZF1 downregulation impaired AMPK phosphorylation, while JAZF1 overexpression also reduced it. Collectively, these results suggest that aberrant JAZF1 expression contributes to the oncogenesis and T2D pathogenesis.

Abstract: Malignant skin melanoma is one of the most deadly human cancers. Extracellular matrix (ECM) influences the growth of malignant tumors by modulating tumor cells adhesion and migration. Hyaluronan is an essential component of the ECM, and its amount is altered in many tumors, suggesting an important role for hyaluronan in tumorigenesis. Nonetheless its role in melanomagenesis is not understood. In this study we produced a MV3 melanoma cell line with inducible expression of the hyaluronan synthase 3 (HAS3) and studied its effect on the behavior of the melanoma cells. HAS3 overexpression expanded the cell surface hyaluronan coat and decreased melanoma cell adhesion, migration and proliferation by cell cycle arrest at G1/G0. Melanoma cell migration was restored by removal of cell surface hyaluronan by Streptomyces hyaluronidase and by receptor blocking with hyaluronan oligosaccharides, while the effect on cell proliferation was receptor independent. Overexpression of HAS3 decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation suggesting that inhibition of MAP-kinase signaling was responsible for these suppressive effects on the malignant phenotype of MV3 melanoma cells.

Abstract: Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) provide revascularisation for cardiovascular disease and the expansion of these cells opens up the possibility of their use as a cell therapy. Herein we show that interleukin-3 (IL3) strongly expands a population of human non-adherent endothelial forming cells (EXnaEFCs) with low immunogenicity as well as pro-angiogenic capabilities in vivo, making their therapeutic utilisation a realistic option. Non-adherent CD133+ EFCs isolated from human umbilical cord blood and cultured under different conditions were maximally expanded by day 12 in the presence of IL3 at which time a 350-fold increase in cell number was obtained. Cell surface marker phenotyping confirmed expression of the hematopoietic progenitor cell markers CD133, CD117 and CD34, vascular cell markers VEGFR2 and CD31, dim expression of CD45 and absence of myeloid markers CD14 and CD11b. Functional experiments revealed that EXnaEFCs exhibited classical properties of endothelial cells (ECs), namely binding of Ulex europaeus lectin, up-take of acetylated-low density lipoprotein and contribution to EC tube formation in vitro. These EXnaEFCs demonstrated a pro-angiogenic phenotype within two independent in vivo rodent models. Firstly, a Matrigel plug assay showed increased vascularisation in mice. Secondly, a rat model of acute myocardial infarction demonstrated reduced heart damage as determined by lower levels of serum creatinine and a modest increase in heart functionality. Taken together, these studies show IL3 as a potent growth factor for human CD133+ cell expansion with clear pro-angiogenic properties (in vitro and in vivo) and thus may provide clinical utility for humans in the future.

Abstract: Summary
Critical cell surface immunoreceptors downregulated during HIV infection have previously been identified using non-systematic, candidate approaches. To gain a comprehensive, unbiased overview of how HIV infection remodels the T cell surface, we took a distinct, systems-level, quantitative proteomic approach. >100 plasma membrane proteins, many without characterized immune functions, were downregulated during HIV infection. Host factors targeted by the viral accessory proteins Vpu or Nef included the amino acid transporter SNAT1 and the serine carriers SERINC3/5. We focused on SNAT1, a β-TrCP-dependent Vpu substrate. SNAT1 antagonism was acquired by Vpu variants from the lineage of SIVcpz/HIV-1 viruses responsible for pandemic AIDS. We found marked SNAT1 induction in activated primary human CD4+ T cells, and used Consumption and Release (CoRe) metabolomics to identify alanine as an endogenous SNAT1 substrate required for T cell mitogenesis. Downregulation of SNAT1 therefore defines a unique paradigm of HIV interference with immunometabolism.

Abstract: Although 17β-estradial (E2) is known to stimulate bone formation, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Recent studies have implicated the Wnt/β-catenin pathway as a major signaling cascade in bone biology. The interactions between Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and estrogen signaling pathways have been reported in many tissues. In this study, E2 significantly increased the expression of β-catenin by inducing phosphorylations of GSK3β at serine 9. ERβ siRNAs were transfected into MC3T3-E1 cells and revealed that ERβ involved E2-induced osteoblasts proliferation and differentiation via Wnt/β-catenin signaling. The osteoblast differentiation genes (BGP, ALP and OPN) and proliferation related gene (cyclin D1) expression were significantly induced by E2-mediated ERβ. Furthermore immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that E2 induced the accumulation of β-catenin protein in the nucleus which leads to interaction with T-cell-specific transcription factor/lymphoid enhancer binding factor (TCF/LEF) transcription factors. Taken together, these findings suggest that E2 promotes osteoblastic proliferation and differentiation by inducing proliferation-related and differentiation-related gene expression via ERβ/GSK-3β-dependent Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Our findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms of action of E2 in osteoblastogenesis.

Abstract: This study describes the first detailed molecular characterization of the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) gene from Sorghum bicolor, MN1618 designated as SbHsp70-1. The full-length cDNA of SbHsp70-1 consists of 2524 bp with a 1950 bp open reading frame, which encodes a protein of 649 amino acids. SbHsp70-1 is a cytoplasmic protein with high homology to other plant Hsp70s, especially grain crops. Recombinant SbHsp70-1 was able to bind and hydrolyse ATP in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that SbHsp70-1 functions as an ATPase. Immunoblot assays showed that the expression of SbHsp70-1 is induced at temperatures of 37, 45, and 4°C but reduced at 42 °C. In addition, the SbHsp70-1 mRNA transcript is constitutively expressed in both leaves and stem but is significantly increased upon heat shock at 42 °C. Upon cold shock at 4 °C, SbHsp70-1 mRNA transcript level increased in the leaf, but no significant change was observed in the stem. In addition, expression of the pET28a-SbHsp70-1 construct in Escherichia coli cells under heat stress resulted in their survival even at higher temperature (65 °C). Our results suggest that SbHsp70-1 is a heat-inducible protein that confer thermal tolerance to bacterial cells and can be claimed as a promising target to study stress tolerance in crops.

Abstract: Background
Different types of pulmonary hypertension (PH) share the same process of pulmonary vascular remodeling, the molecular mechanism of which is not entirely clarified by far. The abnormal biological behaviors of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) play an important role in this process.
Objectives
We investigated the regulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (PAI-2) by the sGC activator, and explored the effect of PAI-2 on PASMCs proliferation, apoptosis and migration.
Methods
After the transfection with PAI-2 overexpression vector and specific siRNAs or treatment with BAY 41-2272 (an activator of sGC), the mRNA and protein levels of PAI-2 in cultured human PASMCs were detected, and the proliferation, apoptosis and migration of PASMCs were investigated.
Results
BAY 41-2272 up regulated the endogenous PAI-2 in PASMCs, on the mRNA and protein level. In PAI-2 overexpression group, the proliferation and migration of PASMCs were inhibited significantly, and the apoptosis of PASMCs was increased. In contrast, PAI-2 knockdown with siRNA increased PASMCs proliferation and migration, inhibited the apoptosis.
Conclusions
PAI-2 overexpression inhibits the proliferation and migration and promotes the apoptosis of human PASMCs. Therefore, sGC activator might alleviate or reverse vascular remodeling in PH through the up-regulation of PAI-2.

Abstract: Blood formation by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is regulated by a still incompletely defined network of general and HSC-specific regulators. In this study, we analyzed the role of G-protein coupled receptor 56 (Gpr56) as a candidate HSC regulator based on its differential expression in quiescent relative to proliferating HSCs and its common targeting by core HSC regulators. Detailed expression analysis revealed that Gpr56 is abundantly expressed by HSPCs during definitive hematopoiesis in the embryo and in the adult bone marrow, but its levels are reduced substantially as HSPCs differentiate. However, despite enriched expression in HSPCs, Gpr56-deficiency did not impair HSPC maintenance or function during steady-state or myeloablative stress-induced hematopoiesis. Gpr56-deficient HSCs also responded normally to physiological and pharmacological mobilization signals, despite the reported role of this GPCR as a regulator of cell adhesion and migration in neuronal cells. Moreover, Gpr56-deficient bone marrow engrafted with equivalent efficiency as wild-type HSCs in primary recipients; however, their reconstituting ability was reduced when subjected to serial transplantation. These data indicate that although GPR56 is abundantly and selectively expressed by primitive HSPCs, its high level expression is largely dispensable for steady-state and regenerative hematopoiesis.

Abstract: Summary
Mycobacterium tuberculosis remains a health concern due to its ability to enter a non-replicative dormant state linked to drug resistance. Understanding transitions into and out of dormancy will inform therapeutic strategies. We implemented a universally applicable, label-free approach to estimate absolute cellular protein concentrations on a proteome-wide scale based on SWATH mass spectrometry. We applied this approach to examine proteomic reorganization of M. tuberculosis during exponential growth, hypoxia-induced dormancy, and resuscitation. The resulting data set covering >2,000 proteins reveals how protein biomass is distributed among cellular functions during these states. The stress-induced DosR regulon contributes 20% to cellular protein content during dormancy, whereas ribosomal proteins remain largely unchanged at 5%–7%. Absolute protein concentrations furthermore allow protein alterations to be translated into changes in maximal enzymatic reaction velocities, enhancing understanding of metabolic adaptations. Thus, global absolute protein measurements provide a quantitative description of microbial states, which can support the development of therapeutic interventions.

Abstract: Background
Mammalian hearts undergo hypertrophy upon pressure overload to support increased workload. Sustained hypertrophy results in cardiac decompensation and subsequently heart failure. The mechanism that prevents the development of cardiac hypertrophy is still not fully understood. Here we elucidate the anti-hypertrophic role of the histone demethylase PHF8.
Methods and results
PHF8 protein and mRNA levels were down-regulated in human failing hearts, mouse hypertrophic hearts and neonatal rat ventricle myocytes that underwent hypertrophy. Then we generated a cardiac-specific PHF8 transgenic mice, and found that PHF8 overexpression reversed cardiac dysfunction, hypertrophy and fibrosis upon pressure overload. In vivo evidence showed that PHF8 blocked protein synthesis and hypertrophic fetal genes expression. Furthermore, we found that PHF8 inhibited Akt-mTOR pathway in hypertrophic hearts and neonatal rat ventricle myocytes, and rapamycin treatment rescues the effects of PHF8 loss.
Conclusion
These results indicate that PHF8 serves as an endogenous factor that the host uses to attenuate cardiac hypertrophy upon cardiac overload. Strategies based on its enhancement might be of benefit in the treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Abstract: During embryonic development, oral ectoderm differentiates into the adenohypophysis, dental epithelia, salivary glands, and nasal pit. Few reports exist concerning the induction of oral ectoderm from embryonic stem (ES) cells. Generally, any lot differences in fetal bovine serum (FBS) and serum replacer may affect the induction of ES cell-differentiation. Using a previously established culture strategy for differentiation, the proportion of cell aggregates containing Pitx1+ oral ectoderm varied widely between 9–36% when several different lots of FBS or serum replacer were used. We therefore tried to enhance the differentiation method. We found that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 4 and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) treatments improved oral ectoderm induction. Such treatment also improved the differentiation of oral ectoderm into the adenohypophysis. Furthermore, increased BMP4 treatment induced dental epithelium and mesenchyme. Such differentiation suggests that the Pitx1+ layer displays similar properties to oral ectoderm, as found in vivo. Differentiation of ES cells into oral ectoderm using different lots of FBS and serum replacer increased 78–90% after treatment with BMP4 and FGF. In summary, we have established a robust strategy for the induction of oral ectoderm differentiation from mouse ES cells.

Abstract: Summary
Receptor interacting protein kinase-3 (RIP3) is an essential kinase for necroptotic cell death signaling and has been implicated in antiviral cell death signaling upon DNA virus infection. Here, we performed high-throughput RNAi screening and identified RIP3 as a positive regulator of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB) replication in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). RIP3 regulates autophagy, a process utilized by CVB for viral replication factory assembly, and depletion of RIP3 inhibits autophagic flux and leads to the accumulation of autophagosomes and amphisomes. Additionally, later in infection, RIP3 is cleaved by the CVB-encoded cysteine protease 3Cpro, which serves to abrogate RIP3-mediated necrotic signaling and induce a nonnecrotic form of cell death. Taken together, our results show that temporal targeting of RIP3 allows CVB to benefit from its roles in regulating autophagy while inhibiting the induction of necroptotic cell death.

Abstract: The survival rate for patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) has not seen marked improvement in recent decades despite enhanced efforts in prevention and the introduction of novel therapies. We have reported that pharmacological exacerbation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) is an effective approach to killing OSCC cells. The UPR is executed via distinct signaling cascades whereby an initial attempt to restore folding homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum during stress is complemented by an apoptotic response if the defect cannot be resolved. To identify novel small molecules able to overwhelm the adaptive capacity of the UPR in OSCC cells, we engineered a complementary cell-based assay to screen a broad spectrum of chemical matter. Stably transfected CHO-K1 cells that individually report (luciferase) on the PERK/eIF2α/ATF4/CHOP (apoptotic) or the IRE1/XBP1 (adaptive) UPR pathways, were engineered [1]. The triterpenoids dihydrocelastrol and celastrol were identified as potent inducers of UPR signaling and cell death in a primary screen and confirmed in a panel of OSCC cells and other cancer cell lines. Biochemical and genetic assays using OSCC cells and modified murine embryonic fibroblasts demonstrated that intact PERK-eIF2–ATF4-CHOP signaling is required for pro-apoptotic UPR and OSCC death following celastrol treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by the absence of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). We have previously generated FXS-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients’ fibroblasts. In this study, we aimed at unraveling the molecular phenotype of the disease. Our data revealed aberrant regulation of neural differentiation and axon guidance genes in FXS-derived neurons, which are regulated by the RE-1 silencing transcription factor (REST). Moreover, we found REST to be elevated in FXS-derived neurons. As FMRP is involved in the microRNA (miRNA) pathway, we employed miRNA-array analyses and uncovered several miRNAs dysregulated in FXS-derived neurons. We found hsa-mir-382 to be downregulated in FXS-derived neurons, and introduction of mimic-mir-382 into these neurons was sufficient to repress REST and upregulate its axon guidance target genes. Our data link FMRP and REST through the miRNA pathway and show a new aspect in the development of FXS.

Abstract: Leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains 1 (LRIG1) is a pan-negative regulator of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway. The aim of this study was to investigate the underlying mechanism of LRIG1 in the regulation of vasculogenic mimicry (VM) formation in glioma cells. We constructed an enhanced green fluorescent protein plasmid (pEGFP) system, pEGFP-C1-LRIG1, for overexpression of LRIG1, and transfected it into human glioma cell line SHG-44. Under hypoxic conditions induced by CoCl2, we investigated the effects of LRIG1 overexpression on VM formation and VM-dependent malignant behaviors including migration, invasion, and proliferation. Additionally, we explored the effects of LRIG1 on the expression levels of major components of the EGFR/PI3K/AKT pathway as well as E-cadherin and vimentin. We found that LRIG1 overexpression is able to inhibit hypoxia-induced VM formation, migration, invasion, and proliferation. Furthermore, LRIG1 overexpression counteracts hypoxia-induced increase in the expression of phosphorylated EGFR (pEGFR), PI3K (pPI3K), and AKT (pAKT) and reverts hypoxia-induced alteration in E-cadherin and vimentin expression levels. In LRIG1 knockdown SHG-44 cells, however, hypoxia-induced VM formation and alteration in E-cadherin and vimentin expression levels were exacerbated. These results suggest that the inhibitory effects of LRIG1 are most likely mediated by suppression of the EGFR/PI3K/AKT pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Our findings provide compelling evidence implicating LRIG1 in glioma pathophysiology, suggesting that gene therapy using LRIG1 may serve as a treatment for this disease.

Abstract: The secreted Frizzled-Related Proteins (sFRPs) are generally considered antagonistic to Wnt signaling. However, several studies have described their synergy and/or activation of this pathway. Our own data indicated that in the intestinal epithelium, thyroid hormone induced-expression of sFRP2 stabilizes β-catenin, leading to induction of Wnt. The aim of this work was to investigate the role of sFRP2 in the intestinal epithelium homeostasis and its specific effect on canonical Wnt pathway. In wild type animals we observed a restricted pattern of sFRP2 protein expression at the level of the intestinal crypts. Interestingly, sFRP2−/− mice displayed increased apoptosis within the crypts together with a defect in cell migration. Because of altered proportion of lineage-specific committed progenitors, the sFRP2−/− animals also showed a decrease of absorptive differentiation counterbalanced by an increase of secretory differentiation. Regarding the action of sFRP2 on canonical Wnt pathway, the lack of sFRP2 expression in sFRP2−/−/TopGal animals in vivo reduced the Wnt activity. This positive action of sFRP2 on Wnt was further confirmed by in vitro studies. In conclusion, in accordance with its restricted expression profile, sFRP2 contributes to the physiology of the intestinal epithelial crypt progenitors by controlling apoptosis, cell fate decisions and the Wnt pathway.

Abstract: Skeletal and heart muscle-specific variant of the alpha subunit of nascent polypeptide associated complex (skNAC) is exclusively found in striated muscle cells. Its function, however, is largely unknown. Previous reports could demonstrate that skNAC binds to Smyd1 (SET and MYND domain containing protein 1). The facts that (a) SET domains have histone methyltransferase activity, and (b) MYND domains are known recruiters of histone deacetylases (HDACs), implicate the skNAC–Smyd1 complex in transcriptional control. To study potential target genes, we carried out cDNA microarray analysis on differentiating C2C12 myoblasts in which expression of the skNAC gene had been knocked down. We found and confirmed a series of targets, specifically genes encoding regulators of inflammation, cellular metabolism, and cell migration. Mechanistically, as shown by Western blot, ELISA, and ChIP analysis at selected promoter regions, transcriptional control by skNAC–Smyd1 appears to be exerted at least in part by affecting a series of histone modifications, specifically H3K4 di- and trimethylation and potentially also histone acetylation. Taken together, our data suggest that the skNAC–Smyd1 complex is involved in transcriptional regulation both via the control of histone methylation and histone (de)acetylation.

Abstract: Adult mammary stem cells have been identified in several species including the bovine. They are responsible for the development of the gland and for cyclic remodeling during estrous cycles and pregnancy. Epithelial cell subpopulations exist within the mammary gland. We and others showed previously that the Colony Forming Cell (CFC) assay can be used to detect lineage-restricted mammary progenitors. We carried out CFCs with bovine mammary cells and manually separated colonies with specific morphologies associated with either a luminal or a myoepithelial phenotype. Expression of specific markers was assessed by immunocytochemistry or by flow cytometry to confirm that the manual separation resulted in isolation of phenotipically different cells. When transplanted in recipient immunodeficient mice, we found that only myoepithelial-like colonies gave rise to outgrowths that resembled bovine mammary alveoli, thus proving that adult stem cells were maintained during culture and segregated with myoepithelial cells. After recovery of the cells from the transplanted mice and subsequent progenitor content analysis, we found a tendency to detect a higher progenitor frequency when myoepithelial-like colonies were transplanted. We here demonstrate that bovine adult mammary stem cells can be sustained in short-term culture and that they can be enriched by manually selecting for basal-like morphology.

Abstract: Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can survive long-term in a state of dormancy. Little is known about how histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) affect HSC kinetics. Here, we use trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, to enforce histone acetylation and show that this suppresses cell cycle entry by dormant HSCs. Previously, we found that haploinsufficiency of PSF1, a DNA replication factor, led to attenuation of the bone marrow (BM) HSC pool size and lack of acute proliferation after 5-FU ablation. Because PSF1 protein is present in CD34+ transiently amplifying HSCs but not in CD34− long-term reconstituting-HSCs which are resting in a dormant state, we analyzed the relationship between dormancy and PSF1 expression, and how a histone deacetylase inhibitor affects this. We found that CD34+ HSCs produce long functional PSF1 (PSF1a) but CD34− HSCs produce a shorter possibly non-functional PSF1 (PSF1b, c, dominantly PSF1c). Using PSF1a-overexpressing NIH-3T3 cells in which the endogenous PSF1 promoter is suppressed, we found that TSA treatment promotes production of the shorter form of PSF1 possibly by inducing recruitment of E2F family factors upstream of the PSF1 transcription start site. Our data document one mechanism by which histone deacetylase inhibitors affect the dormancy of HSCs by regulating the DNA replication factor PSF1.

Abstract: Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) were recently identified as having significant clinical potential in reversing β-cell functional inhibition caused by inflammation, a shared precursor of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. However, HDACi are highly complex and little is known of their direct effect on important cell secretion pathways for blood glucose regulation. The aims of the present study were to investigate the effect of HDACi on insulin secretion from β-cells, GLP-1 secretion from L-cells, and recombinant insulin secretion from engineered L-cells. The β-cell line βTC-tet, L-cell line GLUTag, or recombinant insulin-secreting L-cell lines were exposed to Trichostatin A for 24h. Effects on insulin or GLP-1 mRNA, intracellular protein content, processing efficiency, and secretion were measured by real-time PCR, ELISA, and radioimmunoassay. HDACi increased secretion per viable cell in a dose-dependent manner for all cell types. Effects on mRNA levels were variable, but enhanced intracellular polypeptide content and secretion were comparable among cell types. Enhanced recombinant insulin secretion was sustained for seven days in alginate microencapsulated L-cells. HDACi enhances β- and L-cell secretion fluxes in a way that could significantly improve blood glucose regulation in diabetes patients and holds potential as a novel method for enhancing insulin-secreting non-β or β-cell grafts.

Abstract: LC3, a mammalian homologue of yeast Atg8, is assumed to play an important part in bulk sequestration and degradation of cytoplasm (macroautophagy), and is widely used as an indicator of this process. To critically examine its role, we followed the autophagic flux of LC3 in rat hepatocytes during conditions of maximal macroautophagic activity (amino acid depletion), combined with analyses of macroautophagic cargo sequestration, measured as transfer of the cytosolic protein lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) to sedimentable organelles. To accurately determine LC3 turnover we developed a quantitative immunoblotting procedure that corrects for differential immunoreactivity of cytosolic and membrane-associated LC3 forms, and we included cycloheximide to block influx of newly synthesized LC3. As expected, LC3 was initially degraded by the autophagic-lysosomal pathway, but, surprisingly, autophagic LC3-flux ceased after ~2h. In contrast, macroautophagic cargo flux was well maintained, and density gradient analysis showed that sequestered LDH partly accumulated in LC3-free autophagic vacuoles. Hepatocytic macroautophagy could thus proceed independently of LC3. Silencing of either of the two mammalian Atg8 subfamilies in LNCaP prostate cancer cells exposed to macroautophagy-inducing conditions (starvation or the mTOR-inhibitor Torin1) confirmed that macroautophagic sequestration did not require the LC3 subfamily, but, intriguingly, we found the GABARAP subfamily to be essential.

Abstract: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is increasing its application in life sciences for electron density measurements of ultrathin sections. These are traditionally analyzed with transmission electron microscopy (TEM); by most labs, SEM analysis still is associated with surface imaging only. Here we report several advantages of SEM for thin sections over TEM, both for structural inspection, as well as analyzing immuno-targeted labels such as quantum dots (QDs) and gold, where we find that QD-labeling is ten times more efficient than gold-labeling. Furthermore, we find that omitting post-staining with uranyl and lead leads to QDs readily detectable over the ultrastructure, but under these conditions ultrastructural contrast was even almost invisible in TEM examination. Importantly, imaging in SEM with STEM detection leads to both outstanding QDs and ultrastructural contrast. STEM imaging is superior over back-scattered electron imaging of these non-contrasted samples, whereas secondary electron detection cannot be used at all. We conclude that examination of ultrathin sections by SEM, which may be immunolabeled with QDs, will allow rapid and straightforward analysis of large fields with more efficient labeling than can be achieved with immunogold. The large fields of view routinely achieved with SEM, but not with TEM, allows straightforward raw data sharing using virtual microscopy, also known as nanotomy when this concerns EM data in the life sciences.

Abstract: Thioredoxin peroxidase (Tpx), also named peroxiredoxin (Prx), is an important peroxidase that can protect organisms against stressful environments. AccTpx4, a 1-Cys thioredoxin peroxidase gene from the Chinese honey bee Apis cerana cerana, was cloned and characterized. The AccTpx4 gene encodes a protein that is predicted to contain the conserved PVCTTE motif from 1-Cys peroxiredoxin. Quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) and Western blotting revealed that AccTpx4 was induced by various oxidative stresses, such as cold, heat, insecticides, H2O2, and HgCl2. The in vivo peroxidase activity assay showed that recombinant AccTpx4 protein could efficiently degrade H2O2 in the presence of DL-dithiothreitol (DTT). In addition, disc fusion assays revealed that AccTpx4 could function to protect cells against oxidative stresses. These results indicate that AccTpx4 plays an important role in oxidative stress responses and may contribute to the conservation of honeybees.

Abstract: Summary
During its life cycle, Plasmodium falciparum undergoes rapid proliferation fueled by de novo synthesis and acquisition of host cell lipids. Consistent with this essential role, Plasmodium lipid synthesis enzymes are emerging as potential drug targets. To explore their broader potential for therapeutic interventions, we assayed the global lipid landscape during P. falciparum sexual and asexual blood stage (ABS) development. Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, we analyzed 304 lipids constituting 24 classes in ABS parasites, infected red blood cell (RBC)-derived microvesicles, gametocytes, and uninfected RBCs. Ten lipid classes were previously uncharacterized in P. falciparum, and 70%–75% of the lipid classes exhibited changes in abundance during ABS and gametocyte development. Utilizing compounds that target lipid metabolism, we affirmed the essentiality of major classes, including triacylglycerols. These studies highlight the interplay between host and parasite lipid metabolism and provide a comprehensive analysis of P. falciparum lipids with candidate pathways for drug discovery efforts.

Abstract: Summary
Adult skeletal muscle stem cells, or satellite cells (SCs), regenerate functional muscle following transplantation into injured or diseased tissue. To gain insight into human SC (huSC) biology, we analyzed transcriptome dynamics by RNA sequencing of prospectively isolated quiescent and activated huSCs. This analysis indicated that huSCs differentiate and lose proliferative potential when maintained in high-mitogen conditions ex vivo. Further analysis of gene expression revealed that p38 MAPK acts in a transcriptional network underlying huSC self-renewal. Activation of p38 signaling correlated with huSC differentiation, while inhibition of p38 reversibly prevented differentiation, enabling expansion of huSCs. When transplanted, expanded huSCs differentiated to generate chimeric muscle and engrafted as SCs in the sublaminar niche with a greater frequency than freshly isolated cells or cells cultured without p38 inhibition. These studies indicate characteristics of the huSC transcriptome that promote expansion ex vivo to allow enhanced functional engraftment of a defined population of self-renewing huSCs.

Abstract: Heat shock proteins (HSPs) have been repeatedly implicated in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The authors aimed to study applicability of heat shock protein 70 (HSPA1A) serum levels as a diagnostic factor and a severity indicator in patients with RA and to quantify cut-off point that predicts status of RA with highest specificity. A total of 76 patients with RA and 36 healthy adults were studied in this case-control analysis. Patients had a higher HSPA1A level than the control group (0.78±0.13 vs. 0.12±0.02 ng/mL, p = 0.006), irrespective of presence of absence of rheumatoid factor or anti-citrullinated cyclic peptide. Next, diagnostic accuracy of the HSPA1A in diagnosis of RA was evaluated (area under curve 0.71; p < 0.05). HSPA1A predicted status of having RA in levels above 0.42 ng/mL with more than 90 % specificity. In addition to diagnostic value, HSPA1A can distinguish between high disease activity (1.66±0.75 ng/mL) and low (0.49±0.1 ng/mL), moderate (0.52±0.12 ng/mL), or remission phase (0.48±0.11 ng/mL). Moreover, patients in remission still had a higher HSPA1A level compared to normal subject (0.48±0.11 vs. 0.12±0.02 ng/mL, p < 0.05). Our results showed that serum HSPA1A could be implemented as a specific tool to facilitate diagnosis and monitoring disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

Abstract: The disease burden from diabetic kidney disease is large and growing. Effective therapies are lacking, despite an urgent need. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) activates Nrf2 and cellular antioxidant defenses; therefore, it may be generally useful for treating conditions that feature chronic oxidative tissue damage. Herein, we determined how periodic exposure to oxygen at elevated pressure affected type 2 diabetes mellitus-related changes in the kidneys of db/db mice. Two groups of db/db mice, designated 2.4 ATA and 1.5 ATA, were treated four times per week with 100 % oxygen at either 1.5 or 2.4 ATA (atmospheres absolute) followed by tests to assess kidney damage and function. The sham group of db/db mice and the Hets group of db/+ mice were handled but did not receive HBOT. Several markers of kidney damage were reduced significantly in the HBOT groups including urinary biomarkers neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and cystatin C (CyC) along with significantly lower levels of caspase-3 activity in kidney tissue extracts. Other stress biomarkers also showed trends to improvement in the HBOT groups, including urinary albumin levels. Expressions of the stress response genes NRF2, HMOX1, MT1, and HSPA1A were reduced in the HBOT groups at the end of the experiment, consistent with reduced kidney damage in treated mice. Urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR), a measure of albuminuria, was significantly reduced in the db/db mice receiving HBOT. All of the db/db mouse groups had qualitatively similar changes in renal histopathology. Glycogenated nuclei, not previously reported in db/db mice, were observed in these three experimental groups but not in the control group of nondiabetic mice. Overall, our findings are consistent with therapeutic HBOT alleviating stress and damage in the diabetic kidney through cytoprotective responses. These findings support an emerging paradigm in which tissue oxygenation and cellular defenses effectively limit damage from chronic oxidative stress more effectively than chemical antioxidants.

LIM homeobox transcription factor Lhx2 inhibits skeletal muscle differentiation in part via transcriptional activation of Msx1 and Msx2,

Abstract: LIM homeobox transcription factor Lhx2 is known to be an important regulator of neuronal development, homeostasis of hair follicle stem cells, and self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells; however, its function in skeletal muscle development is poorly understood. In this study, we found that overexpression of Lhx2 completely inhibits the myotube-forming capacity of C2C12 cells and primary myoblasts. The muscle dedifferentiation factors Msx1 and Msx2 were strongly induced by the Lhx2 overexpression. Short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Lhx2 in the developing limb buds of mouse embryos resulted in a reduction in Msx1 and Msx2 mRNA levels, suggesting that they are downstream target genes of Lhx2. We found two Lhx2 consensus-binding sites in the −2097 to −1189 genomic region of Msx1 and two additional sites in the −536 to +73 genomic region of Msx2. These sequences were shown by luciferase reporter assay to be essential for Lhx2-mediated transcriptional activation. Moreover, electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that Lhx2 is present in chromatin DNA complexes bound to the enhancer regions of the Msx1 and Msx2 genes. These data demonstrate that Msx1 and Msx2 are direct transcriptional targets of Lhx2. In addition, overexpression of Lhx2 significantly enhanced the mRNA levels of bone morphogenetic protein 4 and transforming growth factor beta family genes. We propose that Lhx2 is involved in the early stage of skeletal muscle development by inducing multiple differentiation inhibitory factors.

Abstract: Multipotent, self-renewing stem cells are present throughout the developing nervous system remaining in discrete regions of the adult brain. In the subventricular zone (SVZ) signaling molecules, including the bone morphogenetic proteins and their secreted inhibitor, noggin appear to play a critical role in controlling neural stem cell (NSC) behavior. To examine the function of this signaling pathway in the intact nervous system, we developed a transgenic mouse model in which noggin expression can be induced specifically in NSC via a nestin-driven reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator (rtTA). In adult animals, the induction of noggin expression promotes the proliferation of neural progenitors in the SVZ, and shifts the differentiation of B cells (NSC) from mature astrocytes to transit amplifying C cells and oligodendrocyte precursor cells without depleting the NSC population. Noggin expression significantly increases neuronal and oligodendrocyte differentiation both in vivo and in vitro when NSCs are grown as neurospheres. These results demonstrate that noggin/BMP interactions tightly control cell fate in the SVZ.

Abstract: Perivascular adipocyte (PVAC) proliferation and differentiation were closely involved in cardiovascular disease. We aimed to investigate whether phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways enhance PVAC functions activated by insulin-like growth factor 1(IGF-1) and suppressed by mesenchyme homeobox 2 (MEOX2). In this study, PVACs from primary culture were cultured and induced to differentiate. Cell viability assays demonstrated that IGF-1 promoted PVAC proliferation and differentiation. However MEOX2 counteracted these IGF-1-mediated actions. Flow Cytometry revealed that IGF-1 increased S phase cells and decreased apoptosis; however, MEOX2 decreased S phase cells, increased G0–G1 phase cells, and promoted apoptosis. During PVAC proliferation and differentiation, IGF-1 activated PI3K/Akt1/2 and ERK1/2 signaling pathways, upregulated the expression of these signaling proteins and FAS, and increased PVAC lipid content. In contrast, MEOX2 constrained the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt1/2 protein, down-regulated these signaling molecules and FAS, and decreased PVAC lipid content. Instead, MEOX2 knockdown enhanced the ERK1/2 and Akt1/2 phosphorylation, augmented the expression of these signaling molecules and FAS, and increased PVAC lipid content. Our findings suggested that PI3K/Akt1/2 and ERK1/2 activation mediated by IGF-1 is essential for PVAC proliferation and differentiation, and MEOX2 is a promising therapeutic gene to intervene in the signaling pathways and inhibit PVAC functions.

Abstract: Several studies of stem cell-based gene therapy have indicated that long-lasting regeneration following vessel ischemia may be stimulated through VEGFA gene therapy and/or MSC transplantation for reduction of ischemic injury in limb ischemia and heart failure. The therapeutic potential of MSC transplantation can be further improved by genetically modifying MSCs with genes which enhance angiogenesis following ischemic injury. In the present study, we aimed to develop an approach in MSC-based therapy for repair and mitigation of ischemic injury and regeneration of damaged tissues in ischemic disease. HSP70 promoter-driven VEGFA expression was induced by resveratrol (RSV) in MSCs, and in combination with known RSV biological functions, the protective effects of our approach were investigated by using ex vivo aortic ring coculture system and a 3D scaffolds in vivo model. Results of this investigation demonstrated that HSP promoter-driven VEGFA expression in MSC increased approximately 2-fold over the background VEGFA levels upon HSP70 promoter induction by RSV. Exposure of HUVEC cells to medium containing MSC in which VEGFA had been induced by cis-RSV enhanced tube formation in the treated HUVEC cells. RSV-treated MSC cells differentiated into endothelial-like phenotypes, exhibiting markedly elevated expression of endothelial cell markers. These MSCs also induced aortic ring sprouting, characteristic of neovascular formation from pre-existing vessels, and additionally promoted neovascularization at the MSC transplantation site in a mouse model. These observations support a hypothesis that VEGFA expression induced by cis-RSV acting on the HSP70 promoter in transplanted MSC augments the angiogenic effects of stem cell gene therapy. The use of an inducible system also vastly reduces possible clinical risks associated with constitutive VEGFA expression.

Abstract: Circadian clock is an evolutionarily conserved timing mechanism governing diverse biological processes and the skeletal muscle possesses intrinsic functional clocks. Interestingly, although the essential clock transcription activator, Brain and muscle Arnt-like 1 (Bmal1), participates in maintenance of muscle mass, little is known regarding its role in muscle growth and repair. In this report, we investigate the in vivo function of Bmal1 in skeletal muscle regeneration using two muscle injury models. Bmal1 is highly up-regulated by cardiotoxin injury, and its genetic ablation significantly impairs regeneration with markedly suppressed new myofiber formation and attenuated myogenic induction. A similarly defective regenerative response is observed in Bmal1-null mice as compared to wild-type controls upon freeze injury. Lack of satellite cell expansion accounts for the regeneration defect, as Bmal1−/− mice display significantly lower satellite cell number with nearly abolished induction of the satellite cell marker, Pax7. Furthermore, satellite cell-derived primary myoblasts devoid of Bmal1 display reduced growth and proliferation ex vivo. Collectively, our results demonstrate, for the first time, that Bmal1 is an integral component of the pro-myogenic response that is required for muscle repair. This mechanism may underlie its role in preserving adult muscle mass and could be targeted therapeutically to prevent muscle-wasting diseases.

Abstract: Neuroblastoma, a malignancy of multipotent embryonic neural crest cells, is the most common extracranial solid cancer in childhood and most common cancer in infancy. Cellular phenotype has been shown to be an important determinant of the malignant potential in human neuroblastoma cells and tumors. Whereas neuroblastic (N-type) are moderately malignant and nonneuronal (S-type) cells are nonmalignant, I-type stem cells are highly tumorigenic, irrespective of N-myc amplification status. In the present study, we sought to determine which genes were overexpressed in the I-type cells which might characterize and maintain the stem cell state and/or malignancy of human neuroblastoma cancer stem cells. We used a microarray platform to compare the steady-state expression levels of mRNAs from 13 human neuroblastoma cell lines representing the three cellular phenotypes. Using qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses, we identified seven genes whose expression is consistently elevated exclusively in neuroblastoma cancer stem cells: CD133, KIT, NOTCH1, GPRC5C, PIGF2, TRKB, and LNGFR. Moreover, we show that the genes are phenotype specific, as differentiation of I-type BE(2)-C cells to either an N- or S-type morphology results in significantly reduced mRNA expression. Finally, we show that NOTCH1 plays an important role in maintaining the stem cell phenotype. The identification and characterization of these genes, elevated in highly malignant neuroblastoma stem cells, could provide the basis for developing novel therapies for treatment of this lethal childhood cancer.

Abstract: Cell migration is crucial in development, tissue repair and immunity and frequently aberrant in pathological processes including tumor metastasis. Focal adhesions (FAs) are integrin-based adhesion complexes that form the link between the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix and are thought to orchestrate cell migration. Understanding the regulation of FAs by (oncogenic) signaling pathways may identify strategies to target pathological cell migration. Here we describe the development of a robust FA tracker that enables the automatic, multi-parametric analysis of FA dynamics, morphology and composition from time-lapse image series generated by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. In control prostate carcinoma cells, this software recapitulates previous findings that relate morphological characteristics of FAs to their lifetime and their cellular location. We then investigated how FAs are altered when cell migration is induced by the metastasis-promoting hormone HGF and subsequently inhibited by activation of the small GTPase Rap1. We performed a detailed analysis of individual FA parameters, which identified FA size, sliding and intensity as primary targets of Rap1. HGF did not have strong effects on any of the FA parameters within the first hours of its addition. Subsequent Bayesian network inference (BNI), using all measured parameters as input, revealed little correlation between changes in cell migration and FA characteristics in this prostate carcinoma cell line. Instead BNI indicated a concerted coordination of cell size and FA parameters. Thus our results did not reveal a direct relation between the regulation of cell migration and the regulation of FA dynamics.

Abstract: Summary
Epigenetic regulation of key transcriptional programs is a critical mechanism that controls hematopoietic development, and, thus, aberrant expression patterns or mutations in epigenetic regulators occur frequently in hematologic malignancies. We demonstrate that the Polycomb protein L3MBTL1, which is monoallelically deleted in 20q- myeloid malignancies, represses the ability of stem cells to drive hematopoietic-specific transcriptional programs by regulating the expression of SMAD5 and impairing its recruitment to target regulatory regions. Indeed, knockdown of L3MBTL1 promotes the development of hematopoiesis and impairs neural cell fate in human pluripotent stem cells. We also found a role for L3MBTL1 in regulating SMAD5 target gene expression in mature hematopoietic cell populations, thereby affecting erythroid differentiation. Taken together, we have identified epigenetic priming of hematopoietic-specific transcriptional networks, which may assist in the development of therapeutic approaches for patients with anemia.

Abstract: Summary
The utility of stem cells and their progeny in adult transplantation models has been limited by poor survival and integration. We designed an injectable and bioresorbable hydrogel blend of hyaluronan and methylcellulose (HAMC) and tested it with two cell types in two animal models, thereby gaining an understanding of its general applicability for enhanced cell distribution, survival, integration, and functional repair relative to conventional cell delivery in saline. HAMC improves cell survival and integration of retinal stem cell (RSC)-derived rods in the retina. The pro-survival mechanism of HAMC is ascribed to the interaction of the CD44 receptor with HA. Transient disruption of the retinal outer limiting membrane, combined with HAMC delivery, results in significantly improved rod survival and visual function. HAMC also improves the distribution, viability, and functional repair of neural stem and progenitor cells (NSCs). The HAMC delivery system improves cell transplantation efficacy in two CNS models, suggesting broad applicability.

Abstract: Vascular calcification (VC) is prevalent in chronic kidney disease and elevated serum inorganic phosphate (Pi) is a recognized risk factor. The type III sodium-dependent phosphate transporter, PiT-1, is required for elevated Pi-induced osteochondrogenic differentiation and matrix mineralization in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). However, the molecular mechanism(s) by which PiT-1 promotes these processes is unclear. In the present study, we confirmed that the Pi concentration required to induce osteochondrogenic differentiation and matrix mineralization of mouse VSMCs was well above that required for maximal Pi uptake, suggesting a signaling function of PiT-1 that was independent of Pi transport. Elevated Pi-induced signaling via ERK1/2 phosphorylation was abrogated in PiT-1 deficient VSMCs, but could be rescued by wild-type (WT) and a Pi transport-deficient PiT-1 mutant. Furthermore, both WT and transport-deficient PiT-1 mutants promoted osteochondrogenic differentiation as measured by decreased SM22α and increased osteopontin mRNA expression. Finally, compared to vector alone, expression of transport-deficient PiT-1 mutants promoted VSMC matrix mineralization, but not to the extent observed with PiT-1 WT. These data suggest that both Pi uptake-dependent and -independent functions of PiT-1 are important for VSMC processes mediating vascular calcification.

Abstract: Summary
The NLRP3 inflammasome assembles in response to danger signals, triggering self-cleavage of procaspase-1 and production of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β. Although virus infection activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, the underlying events remain incompletely understood. We report that virus activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome involves the 2′,5′-oligoadenylate (2-5A) synthetase(OAS)/RNase L system, a component of the interferon-induced antiviral response that senses double-stranded RNA and activates endoribonuclease RNase L to cleave viral and cellular RNAs. The absence of RNase L reduces IL-1β production in influenza A virus-infected mice. RNA cleavage products generated by RNase L enhance IL-1β production but require the presence of 2′,3′-cyclic phosphorylated termini characteristic of RNase L activity. Additionally, these cleavage products stimulate NLRP3 complex formation with the DExD/H-box helicase, DHX33, and mitochondrial adaptor protein, MAVS, which are each required for effective NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Thus, RNA cleavage events catalyzed by RNase L are required for optimal inflammasome activation during viral infections.

Abstract: Summary
Mammals exhibit marked interindividual variations in their gut microbiota, but it remains unclear if this is primarily driven by host genetics or by extrinsic factors like dietary intake. To address this, we examined the effect of dietary perturbations on the gut microbiota of five inbred mouse strains, mice deficient for genes relevant to host-microbial interactions (MyD88−/−, NOD2−/−, ob/ob, and Rag1−/−), and >200 outbred mice. In each experiment, consumption of a high-fat, high-sugar diet reproducibly altered the gut microbiota despite differences in host genotype. The gut microbiota exhibited a linear dose response to dietary perturbations, taking an average of 3.5 days for each diet-responsive bacterial group to reach a new steady state. Repeated dietary shifts demonstrated that most changes to the gut microbiota are reversible, while also uncovering bacteria whose abundance depends on prior consumption. These results emphasize the dominant role that diet plays in shaping interindividual variations in host-associated microbial communities.

Abstract: Summary
Primordial germ cells (PGCs) are lineage-restricted unipotent cells that can dedifferentiate into pluripotent embryonic germ cells (EGCs). Here we performed whole-transcriptome analysis during the conversion of PGCs into EGCs, a process by which cells acquire pluripotency. To examine the molecular mechanism underlying this conversion, we focused on Blimp-1 and Akt, which are involved in PGC specification and dedifferentiation, respectively. Blimp-1 overexpression in embryonic stem cells suppressed the expression of downstream targets of the pluripotency network. Conversely, Blimp-1 deletion in PGCs accelerated their dedifferentiation into pluripotent EGCs, illustrating that Blimp-1 is a pluripotency gatekeeper protein in PGCs. AKT signaling showed a synergistic effect with basic fibroblast growth factor plus 2i+A83 treatment on EGC formation. AKT played a major role in suppressing genes regulated by MBD3. From these results, we defined the distinct functions of Blimp-1 and Akt and provided mechanistic insights into the acquisition of pluripotency in PGCs.

Abstract: Summary
Human intestinal organoids (HIOs) are a tissue culture model in which small intestine-like tissue is generated from pluripotent stem cells. By carrying out unsupervised hierarchical clustering of RNA-sequencing data, we demonstrate that HIOs most closely resemble human fetal intestine. We observed that genes involved in digestive tract development are enriched in both fetal intestine and HIOs compared to adult tissue, whereas genes related to digestive function and Paneth cell host defense are expressed at higher levels in adult intestine. Our study also revealed that the intestinal stem cell marker OLFM4 is expressed at very low levels in fetal intestine and in HIOs, but is robust in adult crypts. We validated our findings using in vivo transplantation to show that HIOs become more adult-like after transplantation. Our study emphasizes important maturation events that occur in the intestine during human development and demonstrates that HIOs can be used to model fetal-to-adult maturation.

Abstract: In this work, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used to individually study human p53, p63 (full length and truncated forms) and p73. Using this cell system, the effect of these proteins on cell proliferation and death, and the influence of MDM2 and MDMX on their activities were analyzed. When expressed in yeast, wild-type p53, TAp63, ΔNp63 and TAp73 induced growth inhibition associated with S-phase cell cycle arrest. This growth inhibition was accompanied by reactive oxygen species production and autophagic cell death. Furthermore, they stimulated rapamycin-induced autophagy. On the contrary, none of the tested p53 family members induced apoptosis either per se or after apoptotic stimuli. As previously reported for p53, also TAp63, ΔNp63 and TAp73 increased actin expression levels and its depolarization, suggesting that ACT1 is also a p63 and p73 putative yeast target gene. Additionally, MDM2 and MDMX inhibited the activity of all tested p53 family members in yeast, although the effect was weaker on TAp63. Moreover, Nutlin-3a and SJ-172550 were identified as potential inhibitors of the p73 interaction with MDM2 and MDMX, respectively. Altogether, the yeast-based assays herein developed can be envisaged as a simplified cell system to study the involvement of p53 family members in autophagy, the modulation of their activities by specific interactors (MDM2 and MDMX), and the potential of new small molecules to modulate these interactions.

Abstract: Interaction of the Alzheimer’s Aβ peptides with the plasma membrane of cells in culture results in chronic increases in cytosolic [Ca2+]. Such increases can cause a variety of secondary effects leading to impaired cell growth or cell degeneration. In this investigation, we made a comprehensive study of the changes in cytosolic [Ca2+] in single PC12 cells and human neurons stressed by continuous exposure to a medium containing Aβ42 for several days. The differential timing and magnitude of the Aβ42-induced increase in [Ca2+] reveal subpopulations of cells with differential sensitivity to Aβ42. These results suggest that the effect produced by Aβ on the level of cytosolic [Ca2+] depends on the type of cell being monitored. Moreover, the results obtained of using potent inhibitors of Aβ cation channels such as Zn2+ and the small peptide NA7 add further proof to the suggestion that the long-term increases in cytosolic [Ca2+] in cells stressed by continuous exposure to Aβ is the result of Aβ ion channel activity.

Abstract: Hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury is characterized by microfilament reorganization in cardiomyocytes. Previous studies have shown that myofibrillogenesis regulator-1 (MR-1) is expressed in the myocardium and promotes actin organization in cardiomyocytes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of MR-1 in attenuating hypoxia/reoxygenation injury in cardiomyocytes through promoting restoration of the microfilament. To address this aim, an H/R model of cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes was used to assess filamentous actin (F-actin) and α-actinin organization through immunofluorescence microscopy analysis. RT-PCR was used to detect mRNA levels of MR-1 and myosin regulatory light chain-2 (MLC-2). Western blot analysis was used to detect protein levels of MR-1 and filamentous actin/globular actin (F-/G-actin) as well as MLC-2 and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) phosphorylation and protein expression. We also explored the effects of overexpressing or knocking down MR-1 on H/R injury and the MLCK/MLC-2/F-actin pathway. We found that H/R induced cardiomyocyte injury and disruption of F-actin and α-actinin with a decrease in the F-/G-actin ratio compared with controls. Compared with the H/R group, MR-1 overexpression attenuated H/R-induced injury and disruption of F-actin and α-actinin in cardiomyocytes with an increase in the F-/G-actin ratio. MR-1 overexpression also up-regulated H/R-induced MLCK and MLC-2 phosphorylation. However, MR-1 knockdown aggravated H/R injury by further disrupting F-actin and α-actinin, as well as decreasing the F-/G-actin ratio. MR-1 knockdown also down-regulated MLCK and MLC-2 phosphorylation induced by H/R injury. These findings suggest that MR-1 attenuates H/R-induced cardiomyocyte injury by promoting microfilament reorganization through the activation of the MLCK/MLC-2 pathway.

Abstract: Recent data indicate that serum Hsp70 (HSPA1A) levels are increased in type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus. However, there is no report in the literature on circulating Hsp70 levels in gestational diabetes mellitus. In this pilot study, we measured serum Hsp70 levels in 11 pregnant women with pregestational diabetes, 38 women with gestational diabetes, and 40 healthy pregnant women with ELISA. Plasma glucose levels, serum insulin concentrations, HbA1c values, and the Homeostatic Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) index were also determined. According to our results, serum Hsp70 concentrations were significantly higher in women with pregestational and gestational diabetes mellitus than in healthy pregnant women. In addition, pregestational diabetic women had significantly higher Hsp70 levels than those with gestational diabetes. Furthermore, in the group of women with gestational diabetes mellitus, serum Hsp70 levels showed a significant positive correlation with HbA1c values. However, there was no other relationship between clinical features and metabolic parameters of the study subjects and their serum Hsp70 levels in either study group. In conclusion, we demonstrated for the first time in the literature that serum Hsp70 levels are increased and correlate with HbA1c values in women with gestational diabetes mellitus. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to determine whether circulating Hsp70 plays a causative role in the pathogenesis of gestational diabetes or elevated serum Hsp70 levels are only consequences of the disease.

Abstract: Heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) is one of the most important chaperone proteins that modulates smooth muscle contraction. Here we investigated the effects of HSP27 expression on cytoskeleton dynamics and contractile function of human bladder smooth muscle cells (BSMCs) in vitro. Cultured human BSMCs were transfected with lentiviral vectors expressing either HSP27 or HSP27-siRNAs. Normal BSMCs cells and cells transfected with the empty lentivirus were used as control. Cells were then cultured on Flexcell flexible membrane dishes and mechanical stretch (14.8% elongation) was applied. The stretch caused significant disruption of actin cytoskeletal structure and decrease in F/G-actin ratio in BSMCs with HSP27 over-expression, knock-down and control groups (P<0.05) as indicated by phalloidin-FITC staining. It was also shown that the structure of actin filaments in HSP27 over-expressed cells recovered and F/G-actin ratio significantly increased at 12h after stretching compared to unstretched cells (P<0.05), but not in HSP27 knock-down cells, suggesting that HSP27 promoted the recovery of cytoskeletal structure in BSMCs from stretch-induced injury. In addition, the contractile force of BSMCs was enhanced by over-expression of HSP27 and attenuated by knock-down of HSP27 (P<0.05), suggesting a pivotal role of HSP27 in regulating bladder smooth muscle contraction.

Abstract: Gene amplification is a common mechanism of oncogene activation in cancer. Several large-scale efforts aimed at identifying the comprehensive set of genomic regions that are recurrently amplified in cancer have been completed. In breast cancer, these studies have identified recurrently amplified regions containing known drivers such as HER2 and CCND1 as well as regions where the driver oncogene is unknown. In this study, we integrated RNAi-based functional genetic data with copy number and expression data to identify genes that are recurrently amplified, overexpressed and also necessary for the growth/survival of breast cancer cells. Further analysis using clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas specifically identified candidate genes that play a role in determining patient outcomes. Using this approach, we identified two genes, TCP1 and CCT2, as being recurrently altered in breast cancer, necessary for growth/survival of breast cancer cells in vitro, and determinants of overall survival in breast cancer patients. We also show that expression of TCP1 is regulated by driver oncogene activation of PI3K signaling in breast cancer. Interestingly, the TCP1 and CCT2 genes both encode for components of a multi-protein chaperone complex in the cell known as the TCP1 Containing Ring Complex (TRiC). Our results demonstrate a role for the TRiC subunits TCP1 and CCT2, and potentially the entire TRiC complex, in breast cancer and provide rationale for TRiC as a novel therapeutic target in breast cancer.

Abstract: Actions of transforming growth factor-β are largely context dependent. For instance, TGF-β is growth inhibitory to epithelial cells and many tumor cell-lines while it stimulates the growth of mesenchymal cells. TGF-β also activates fibroblast cells to a myofibroblastic phenotype. In order to understand how the responsiveness of fibroblasts to TGF-β would change in the context of transformation, we have compared the differential gene regulation by TGF-β in immortal fibroblasts (hFhTERT), transformed fibroblasts (hFhTERT-LTgRAS) and a human fibrosarcoma cell-line (HT1080). The analysis revealed regulation of 6735, 4163, and 3478 probe-sets by TGF-β in hFhTERT, hFhTERT-LTgRAS and HT1080 cells respectively. Intriguingly, 5291 probe-sets were found to be either regulated in hFhTERT or hFhTERT-LTgRAS cells while 2274 probe-sets were regulated either in hFhTERT or HT1080 cells suggesting that the response of immortal hFhTERT cells to TGF-β is vastly different compared to the response of both the transformed cells hFhTERT-LTgRAS and HT1080 to TGF-β. Strikingly, WNT pathway showed enrichment in the hFhTERT cells in Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. Functional studies showed induction of WNT4 by TGF-β in hFhTERT cells and TGF-β conferred action of these cells was mediated by WNT4. While TGF-β activated both canonical and non-canonical WNT pathways in hFhTERT cells, Erk1/2 and p38 Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase pathways were activated in hFhTERT-LTgRAS and HT1080 cells. This suggests that transformation of immortal hFhTERT cells by SV40 large T antigen and activated RAS caused a switch in their response to TGF-β which matched with the response of HT1080 cells to TGF-β. These data suggest context dependent activation of non-canonical signaling by TGF-β.

Abstract: Summary
The mycobacterial ESX-1 virulence locus accelerates macrophage recruitment to the forming tuberculous granuloma. Newly recruited macrophages phagocytose previously infected apoptotic macrophages to become new bacterial growth niches. Granuloma macrophages can then necrose, releasing mycobacteria into the extracellular milieu, which potentiates their growth even further. Using zebrafish with genetic or pharmacologically induced macrophage deficiencies, we find that global macrophage deficits increase susceptibility to mycobacterial infection by accelerating granuloma necrosis. This is because reduction in the macrophage supply below a critical threshold decreases granuloma macrophage replenishment to the point where apoptotic infected macrophages, failing to get engulfed, necrose. Reducing macrophage demand by removing bacterial ESX-1 offsets the susceptibility of macrophage deficits. Conversely, increasing macrophage supply in wild-type fish by overexpressing myeloid growth factors induces resistance by curtailing necrosis. These findings may explain the susceptibility of humans with mononuclear cytopenias to mycobacterial infections and highlight the therapeutic potential of myeloid growth factors in tuberculosis.

Abstract: Summary
Virulence factors expressed by enteric bacteria are pivotal for pathogen colonization and induction of intestinal disease, but the mechanisms by which host immunity regulates pathogen virulence are largely unknown. Here we show that specific antibody responses are required for downregulation of virulence gene expression in Citrobacter rodentium, an enteric pathogen that models human infections with attaching-and-effacing bacteria. In the absence of antibodies against the pathogen, phenotypically virulent C. rodentium, accumulated and infected the epithelium and subsequently invaded the lamina propia, causing host lethality. IgG induced after infection recognized virulence factors and bound virulent bacteria within the intestinal lumen, leading to their engulfment by neutrophils, while phenotypically avirulent pathogens remained in the intestinal lumen and were eventually outcompeted by the microbiota. Thus, the interplay of the innate and adaptive immune system selectively targets virulent C. rodentium in the intestinal lumen to promote pathogen eradication and host survival.

Abstract: The human CD99 protein is a 32-kDa type I transmembrane glycoprotein, while CD98 is a disulfide-linked 125-kDa heterodimeric type II transmembrane glycoprotein. It has been previously shown that CD99 and CD98 oppositely regulate β1 integrin signaling, though the mechanisms by which this regulation occurs are not known. Our results revealed that antibody-mediated crosslinking of CD98 induced FAK phosphorylation at Y397 and facilitated the formation of the protein kinase Cα (PKCα)–syntenin-focal adhesion kinase (FAK), focal adhesions (FAs), and IPP–Akt1–syntenin complex, which mediates β1 integrin signaling. In contrast, crosslinking of CD99 disrupted the formation of the PKCα–syntenin–FAK complex as well as FA via FAK dephosphorylation. The CD99-induced dephosphorylation of FAK was apparently mediated by the recruitment of Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-2 (SHP2) to the plasma membrane and subsequent activation of its phosphatase activity. Further consequences of the activation of SHP2 included the disruption of FAK–talin and talin–β1 integrin interactions and attenuation in the formation of the IPP–Akt1–syntenin complex at the plasma membrane, which resulted in reduced cell–ECM adhesion. This report uncovers the molecular mechanisms underlying the inverse regulation of β1 integrin signaling by CD99 and CD98 and may provide a novel therapeutic approach to treat inflammation and cancer.

Abstract: Interactions between acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts and neighboring stromal cells are important for disease development and chemosensitivity. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the cytokine-mediated crosstalk between mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and AML cells are largely unknown. Leukemic cells derived from 18 unselected AML patients were cultured with bone marrow MSCs derived from healthy donors; the populations then being separated by a semipermeable membrane. Coculture had only minor effects on MSC proliferation. The unique cytokine network in cocultures was determined by high constitutive MSC release of certain cytokines (especially IL-6 and vascular endothelial growth factor) and constitutive release of a wide range of soluble mediators by primary AML cells. However, the AML cell release varied considerably between patients, and these differences between patients were also reflected in the coculture levels even though supra-additive effects were seen for many mediators. These effects on the local cytokine network were dependent on a functional crosstalk between the two cell subsets. The crosstalk altered the global gene expression profile of the MSCs, especially expression of genes encoding proteins involved in downstream signaling from Toll like receptors, NFκB signaling and CCL/CXCL chemokine release. Thus, primary AML cells alter the functional phenotype of normal MSCs.

Abstract: Febrile temperatures can induce stress responses which protect cells from damage and can reduce inflammation during infections and sepsis. However, the mechanisms behind the protective functions of heat in response to the bacterial endotoxin LPS are unclear. We have recently shown that Annexin-1 (ANXA1)-deficient macrophages exhibited higher TNFα levels after LPS stimulation. Moreover, we have previously reported that ANXA1 can function as a stress protein. Therefore in this study, we determined if ANXA1 is involved in the protective effects of heat on cytokine levels in macrophages after heat and LPS. Exposure of macrophages to 42°C for 1 h prior to LPS results in an inhibition of TNFα production, which was not evident in ANXA1−/− macrophages. We show that this regulation involves primarily MYD88-independent pathways. ANXA1 regulates TNFα mRNA stability after heat and LPS, and this is dependent on endogenous ANXA1 expression and not exogenously secreted factors. Further mechanistic studies revealed the possible involvement of the heat shock protein HSP70 and JNK in the heat and inflammatory stress response regulated by ANXA1. This study shows that ANXA1, an immunomodulatory protein, is critical in the heat stress response induced after heat and endotoxin stimulation.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression at post-transcriptional level. miRNA dysregulation plays a causal role in cancer progression. In this study, miR-208-3p was highly expressed and directly repressed ARID2 expression. As a result, ARID2 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was decreased. In vitro, miR-208-3p down-regulation and ARID2 over-expression elicited similar inhibitory effects on HCC cell proliferation and invasion. In vivo test results revealed that miR-208-3p down-regulation inhibited HCC tumorigenesis in Hep3B cells. Moreover, ARID2 was possibly a downstream element of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFβ1)/miR-208-3p/ARID2 regulatory pathway. These findings suggested that miR-208-3p up-regulation is associated with HCC cell progression and may provide a new target for liver cancer treatment.

Abstract: The TGFβ signaling pathway is essential to epithelial homeostasis and is often inhibited during progression of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Recently, an important role for TGFβ signaling has been described in the crosstalk between epithelial and stromal cells regulating squamous tumor cell invasion in mouse models of head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Loss of TGFβ signaling, in either compartment, leads to HNSCC however, the mechanisms involved are not well understood. Using organotypic reconstruct cultures (OTC) to model the interaction between epithelial and stromal cells that occur in dysplastic lesions, we show that loss of TGFβ signaling promotes an invasive phenotype in both fibroblast and epithelial compartments. Employing immortalized esophageal keratinocytes established to reproduce common mutations of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, we show that treatment of OTC with inhibitors of TGFβ signaling (A83-01 or SB431542) enhances invasion of epithelial cells into a fibroblast-embedded Matrigel/collagen I matrix. Invasion induced by A83-01 is independent of proliferation but relies on protease activity and expression of ADAMTS-1 and can be altered by matrix density. This invasion was associated with increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL1 and EGFR ligands HB-EGF and TGFα. Altering EGF signaling prevented or induced epithelial cell invasion in this model. Loss of expression of the TGFβ target gene ROBO1 suggested that chemorepulsion may regulate keratinocyte invasion. Taken together, our data show increased invasion through inhibition of TGFβ signaling altered epithelial-fibroblasts interactions, repressing markers of activated fibroblasts, and altering integrin-fibronectin interactions. These results suggest that inhibition of TGFβ signaling modulates an array of pathways that combined promote multiple aspects of tumor invasion.

Abstract: Epithelial injury and tubulointerstitial fibrosis (TIF) within a hypoxic microenvironment are associated with progressive loss of renal function in chronic kidney disease [CKD]. Transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1) is an important mediator of renal fibrosis. Growing evidence suggests that Vitamin D [1,25-(OH)2D] and its analogues may have a renoprotective effect in CKD. Here we examined the protective effect of the vitamin D analogue paricalcitol [PC; 19-nor-1α,3β,25-trihydroxy-9,10-secoergosta-5(Z),7(E) 22(E)-triene] on the responses of human renal epithelial cells to TGF-β1. PC attenuated TGF-β1-induced Smad 2 phosphorylation and upregulation of the Notch ligand Jagged-1, α-smooth muscle actin and thrombospondin-1 and prevented the TGF-β1-mediated loss of E-Cadherin. To mimic the hypoxic milieu of CKD we cultured renal epithelial cells in hypoxia [1% O2] and observed similar attenuation by PC of TGF-β1-induced fibrotic responses. Furthermore, in cells cultured in normoxia [21% O2], PC induced an accumulation of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIF) 1α and HIF-2α in a time and concentration [1µM–2µM] dependent manner. Here, PC-induced HIF stabilisation was dependent on activation of the PI-3Kinase pathway. This is the first study to demonstrate regulation of the HIF pathway by PC which may have importance in the mechanism underlying renoprotection by PC.

Abstract: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is implicated in pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and death resulting in type 2 diabetes. Activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) is an essential component of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) and consists of two isoforms, ATF6α and ATF6β. Here we investigated the role of ATF6β. ATF6β mRNA was detected in pancreatic β-cell lines and rodent and human islets. We also detected ATF6β protein and production of the active form (ATF6βp60) in response to ER stress. Knock-down of ATF6β in INS-1 832/13 insulinoma cells did not affect mRNA induction of several major UPR genes in response to ER stress, suggesting ATF6β is not essential for the basic UPR. Expressing active ATF6βp60 or ATF6αp50 followed by microarray analysis showed that they regulate similar UPR genes, although some genes such as Wfs1 are ATF6β-specific. ATF6β, but not ATF6α, is able to bind the Wfs1 promoter and induce Wfs1 gene and protein expression. Knock-down of ATF6β increased the susceptibility of β-cells to ER stress-induced apoptosis, while overexpression of active ATF6βp60 reduced apoptosis. Thus, ATF6β is not essential for induction of most UPR genes, but is required to maintain cell survival in β-cells undergoing chronic ER stress, which in part relates to its ability to induce Wfs1, a pro-survival gene.

Abstract: In order to obtain fine details in 3 dimensions (3D) over time, it is critical for motile biological specimens to be appropriately immobilized. Of the many immobilization options available, the mechanical microcompressor offers many benefits. Our device, previously described, achieves gentle flattening of a cell, allowing us to image finely detailed structures of numerous organelles and physiological processes in living cells. We have imaged protozoa and other small metazoans using differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy, orientation-independent (OI) DIC, and real-time birefringence imaging using a video-enhanced polychromatic polscope. We also describe an enhancement of our previous design by engineering a new device where the coverslip mount is fashioned onto the top of the base; so the entire apparatus is accessible on top of the stage. The new location allows for easier manipulation of the mount when compressing or releasing a specimen on an inverted microscope. Using this improved design, we imaged immobilized bacteria, yeast, paramecia, and nematode worms and obtained an unprecedented view of cell and specimen details. A variety of microscopic techniques were used to obtain high resolution images of static and dynamic cellular and physiological events.

Abstract: Diverting a protein from its intracellular location is a unique property of intrabodies. To interfere with the intracellular traffic of heterochromatin protein 1β (HP1β) in living cells, we have generated a cytoplasmic targeted anti-HP1β intrabody, specifically directed against the C-terminal portion of the molecule. HP1β is a conserved component of mouse and human constitutive heterochromatin involved in diverse nuclear functions including gene silencing, DNA repair and nuclear membrane assembly. We found that the anti-HP1β intrabody sequesters HP1β into cytoplasmic aggregates, inhibiting its traffic to the nucleus. Lamin B receptor (LBR) and a subset of core histones (H3/H4) are also specifically co-sequestered in the cytoplasm of anti-HP1β intrabody-expressing cells. Methylated histone H3 at K9 (Me9H3), a marker of constitutive heterochromatin, is not affected by the anti-HP1β intrabody expression. Hyper-acetylating conditions completely dislodge H3 from HP1β:LBR containing aggregates. The expression of anti-HP1β scFv fragments induces apoptosis, associated with an alteration of nuclear morphology. Both these phenotypes are specifically rescued either by overexpression of recombinant full length HP1β or by HP1β mutant containing the chromoshadow domain, but not by recombinant LBR protein. The HP1β-chromodomain mutant, on the other hand, does not rescue the phenotypes, but does compete with LBR for binding to HP1β. These findings provide new insights into the mode of action of cytoplasmic-targeted intrabodies and the interaction between HP1β and its binding partners involved in peripheral heterochromatin organisation.

Abstract: The increased osteoclastic activity accounts for pathological bone loss in diseases including osteoporosis. MicroRNAs are widely accepted to be involved in the regulation of osteopenic diseases. Recently, the low expression of miR-218 was demonstrated in CD14+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis. However, its role and the underlying mechanism in osteoporosis are still undefined. Here, an obvious decrease in miR-218 expression was observed during osteoclastogenesis under receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) stimulation, in both osteoclast precursors of bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) and RAW 264.7. Further analysis confirmed that overexpression of miR-218 obviously attenuated the formation of multinuclear mature osteoclasts, concomitant with the decrease in Trap and Cathepsin K levels, both the master regulators of osteoclastogenesis. Moreover, miR-218 up-regulation dramatically inhibited osteoclast precursor migration, actin ring formation and bone resorption. Mechanism assay demonstrated that miR-218 overexpression attenuated the expression of p38MAPK, c-Fos and NFATc1 signaling molecules. Following preconditioning with P79350, an agonist of p38MAPK, the inhibitor effect of miR-218 on osteoclastogenesis and bone-resorbing activity was strikingly ameliorated. Together, this study revealed a crucial role of miR-218 as a negative regulator for osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption by suppressing the p38MAPK-c-Fos-NFATc1 pathway. Accordingly, this research will provide a promising therapeutic agent against osteopenic diseases including osteoporosis.

Abstract: Summary
Type I interferon (IFN-α/β or IFN-I) signals through two receptor subunits, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, to orchestrate sterile and infectious immunity. Cellular pathways that regulate IFNAR1 are often targeted by viruses to suppress the antiviral effects of IFN-I. Here we report that encephalitic flaviviruses, including tick-borne encephalitis virus and West Nile virus, antagonize IFN-I signaling by inhibiting IFNAR1 surface expression. Loss of IFNAR1 was associated with binding of the viral IFN-I antagonist, NS5, to prolidase (PEPD), a cellular dipeptidase implicated in primary immune deficiencies in humans. Prolidase was required for IFNAR1 maturation and accumulation, activation of IFNβ-stimulated gene induction, and IFN-I-dependent viral control. Human fibroblasts derived from patients with genetic prolidase deficiency exhibited decreased IFNAR1 surface expression and reduced IFNβ-stimulated signaling. Thus, by understanding flavivirus IFN-I antagonism, prolidase is revealed as a central regulator of IFN-I responses.

Abstract: Summary
Many tumors are hierarchically organized with a minority cell population that has stem-like properties and enhanced ability to initiate tumorigenesis and drive therapeutic relapse. These cancer stem cells (CSCs) are typically identified by complex combinations of cell-surface markers that differ among tumor types. Here, we developed a flexible lentiviral-based reporter system that allows direct visualization of CSCs based on functional properties. The reporter responds to the core stem cell transcription factors OCT4 and SOX2, with further selectivity and kinetic resolution coming from use of a proteasome-targeting degron. Cancer cells marked by this reporter have the expected properties of self-renewal, generation of heterogeneous offspring, high tumor- and metastasis-initiating activity, and resistance to chemotherapeutics. With this approach, the spatial distribution of CSCs can be assessed in settings that retain microenvironmental and structural cues, and CSC plasticity and response to therapeutics can be monitored in real time.

Abstract: Patients with systemic mastocytosis (SM) have a wide variety of problems, including skeletal abnormalities. The disease results from a mutation of the stem cell receptor (c-kit) in mast cells and we wondered if the function of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs; also known as MSCs or mesenchymal stem cells) might be affected by the invasion of bone marrow by mutant mast cells. As expected, BMSCs from SM patients do not have a mutation in c-kit, but they proliferate poorly. In addition, while osteogenic differentiation of the BMSCs seems to be deficient, their adipogenic potential appears to be increased. Since the hematopoietic supportive abilities of BMSCs are also important, we also studied the engraftment in NSG mice of human CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors, after being co-cultured with BMSCs of healthy volunteers vs. BMSCs derived from patients with SM. BMSCs derived from the bone marrow of patients with SM could not support hematopoiesis to the extent that healthy BMSCs do. Finally, we performed an expression analysis and found significant differences between healthy and SM derived BMSCs in the expression of genes with a variety of functions, including the WNT signaling, ossification, and bone remodeling. We suggest that some of the symptoms associated with SM might be driven by epigenetic changes in BMSCs caused by dysfunctional mast cells in the bone marrow of the patients.

Abstract: The transcriptional corepressor CtBP2 is essential for proper development of the nervous system. The factor exerts its repression by interacting in complexes with chromatin-modifying factors such as histone deacetylases (HDAC) 1/2 and the histone demethylase LSD1/KDM1. Notably, the histone acetyl transferase p300 acetylates CtBP2 and this is an important regulatory event of the activity and subcellular localization of the protein. We recently demonstrated an essential role for CtBPs as sensors of microenvironmental oxygen levels influencing the differentiation potential of neural stem cells (NSCs), but it is not known whether oxygen levels influence the acetylation levels of CtBP factors. Here we show by using proximity ligation assay (PLA) that CtBP2 acetylation levels increased significantly in undifferentiated, proliferating NSCs under hypoxic conditions. CtBP2 interacted with the class III HDAC Sirt1 but this interaction was unaltered in hypoxic conditions, and treatment with the Sirt1 inhibitor Ex527 did not result in any significant change in total CtBP2 acetylation levels. Instead, we revealed a significant decrease in PLA signal representing CtBP2 dimerization in NSCs under hypoxic conditions, negatively correlating with the acetylation levels. Our results suggest that microenvironmental oxygen levels influence the dimerization and acetylation levels, and thereby the activity, of CtBP2 in proliferating NSCs.

Abstract: Knowledge of the effects of glucotoxic and lipotoxic environments on proglucagon producing intestinal L cells and pancreatic alpha cells is limited compared with pancreatic beta cells. This study compares the in vitro responses of these cell types to hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia. Glucose (30mM) and palmitate (0.5mM) reduced GLUTag and MIN6 cell viability while alpha TC1 cells were sensitive only to lipotoxicity. Consistent with this, Cat mRNA expression was substantially higher in GLUTag and alpha TC1 cells compared to MIN6 cells. Glucose and palmitate reduced GLUTag cell secretory function while hypersecretion of glucagon was apparent from alpha TC1 cells. Glucose exposure increased transcription of Cat and Sod2 in MIN6 and GLUTag cells respectively while it decreased transcription of Cat and Gpx1 in alpha TC1 cells. Palmitate increased transcription of Cat and Sod2 in all three cell lines. Upregulation of antioxidant enzyme expression by palmitate was accompanied by an increase in Nfkb1 transcription, indicative of activation of defence pathways. Lipotoxicity activated ER stress response, evident from increased Hspa4 mRNA level in GLUTag and MIN6 cells. Glucose and palmitate-induced DNA damage and apoptosis, with substantially smaller effects in alpha TC1 cells. Thus alpha cells are resistant to gluco- and lipotoxicity, partly reflecting higher expression of genes involved in antioxidant defence. In contrast, intestinal L cells, like beta cells, are prone to gluco- and lipotoxicity, possibly contributing to abnormalities of GLP-1 secretion in type 2 diabetes.

Abstract: Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) is a pro-proliferative transcription factor that is expressed in dividing epithelial cells of the intestinal crypt. Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5) has been identified as a stem cell marker in both small intestinal and colonic epithelial cells. To determine whether KLF5 regulates proliferation of intestinal stem cells, we investigated the effects of Klf5 deletion specifically from the intestinal stem cells in adult mice. Mice with inducible intestinal stem cell-specific deletion of Klf5 (Lgr5-Klf5fl/fl) were injected with tamoxifen for 5 consecutive days to induce Lgr5-driven Cre expression. Intestinal and colonic tissues were examined by immunohistochemistry at various time points up to 112days following start of tamoxifen treatment. Klf5 is co-localized in the crypt-based columnar (CBC) cells that express Lgr5. By 11days following the start of tamoxifen treatment, Lgr5-positive crypts from which Klf5 was deleted exhibited a loss of proliferation that was accompanied by an increase in apoptosis. Beginning at 14days following the start of tamoxifen treatment, both Klf5 expression and proliferation were re-established in the transit-amplifying epithelial cells but not in the Lgr5-positive CBC cells. By 112days post-treatment, up to 90% of the Lgr5-positive cells from which Klf5 was deleted were lost from the intestinal crypts. These results indicate a critical role for KLF5 in the survival and maintenance of intestinal stem cells.

Abstract: The exact mechanisms underlying inhibitory effects of pioglitazone (Pio) on Angiotensin II (AngII)-induced atrial fibrosis are complex and remain largely unknown. In the present study, we examined the effect of Pio on AngII-induced mice atrial fibrosis in vivo and atrial fibroblasts proliferation in vitro. In vivo study showed that AngII infusion induced atrial fibrosis and increased expressions of Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-β (TRIF) and tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6) in mice models. However, those effects could be attenuated by Pio (P<0.01). As for in vitro experiment, Pio suppressed AngII-induced atrial fibroblasts proliferation via nuclear factor-κB/transforming growth factor-β1/TRIF/TRAF6 signaling pathway in primary cultured mice atrial fibroblasts (P<0.01). In conclusion, suppression of Pio on AngII-induced atrial fibrosis might be related to its inhibitory effects on above signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
The gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori interacts intimately with the gastric mucosa to avoid the microbicidal acid in the stomach lumen. The cues H. pylori senses to locate and colonize the gastric epithelium have not been well defined. We show that metabolites emanating from human gastric organoids rapidly attract H. pylori. This response is largely controlled by the bacterial chemoreceptor TlpB, and the main attractant emanating from epithelia is urea. Our previous structural analyses show that TlpB binds urea with high affinity. Here we demonstrate that this tight binding controls highly sensitive responses, allowing detection of urea concentrations as low as 50 nM. Attraction to urea requires that H. pylori urease simultaneously destroys the signal. We propose that H. pylori has evolved a sensitive urea chemodetection and destruction system that allows the bacterium to dynamically and locally modify the host environment to locate the epithelium.

Abstract: Summary
Analyses of gene expression in single mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) cultured in serum and LIF revealed the presence of two distinct cell subpopulations with individual gene expression signatures. Comparisons with published data revealed that cells in the first subpopulation are phenotypically similar to cells isolated from the inner cell mass (ICM). In contrast, cells in the second subpopulation appear to be more mature. Pluripotency Gene Regulatory Network (PGRN) reconstruction based on single-cell data and published data suggested antagonistic roles for Oct4 and Nanog in the maintenance of pluripotency states. Integrated analyses of published genomic binding (ChIP) data strongly supported this observation. Certain target genes alternatively regulated by OCT4 and NANOG, such as Sall4 and Zscan10, feed back into the top hierarchical regulator Oct4. Analyses of such incoherent feedforward loops with feedback (iFFL-FB) suggest a dynamic model for the maintenance of mESC pluripotency and self-renewal.

Abstract: Summary
To gain insight into the cellular and molecular cues that promote neurovascular co-patterning at the earliest stages of human embryogenesis, we developed a human embryonic stem cell model to mimic the developing epiblast. Contact of ectoderm-derived neural cells with mesoderm-derived vasculature is initiated via the neural crest (NC), not the neural tube (NT). Neurovascular co-patterning then ensues with specification of NC toward an autonomic fate requiring vascular endothelial cell (EC)-secreted nitric oxide (NO) and direct contact with vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) via T-cadherin-mediated homotypic interactions. Once a neurovascular template has been established, NT-derived central neurons then align themselves with the vasculature. Our findings reveal that, in early human development, the autonomic nervous system forms in response to distinct molecular cues from VSMCs and ECs, providing a model for how other developing lineages might coordinate their co-patterning.

Abstract: Summary
During cell entry, non-enveloped viruses undergo partial uncoating to expose membrane lytic proteins for gaining access to the cytoplasm. We report that adenovirus uses membrane piercing to induce and hijack cellular wound removal processes that facilitate further membrane disruption and infection. Incoming adenovirus stimulates calcium influx and lysosomal exocytosis, a membrane repair mechanism resulting in release of acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) and degradation of sphingomyelin to ceramide lipids in the plasma membrane. Lysosomal exocytosis is triggered by small plasma membrane lesions induced by the viral membrane lytic protein-VI, which is exposed upon mechanical cues from virus receptors, followed by virus endocytosis into leaky endosomes. Chemical inhibition or RNA interference of ASMase slows virus endocytosis, inhibits virus escape to the cytosol, and reduces infection. Ceramide enhances binding of protein-VI to lipid membranes and protein-VI-induced membrane rupture. Thus, adenovirus uses a positive feedback loop between virus uncoating and lipid signaling for efficient membrane penetration.

Abstract: Summary
Identification of human satellite cells that fulfill muscle stem cell criteria is an unmet need in regenerative medicine. This hurdle limits understanding how closely muscle stem cell properties are conserved among mice and humans and hampers translational efforts in muscle regeneration. Here, we report that PAX7 satellite cells exist at a consistent frequency of 2–4 cells/mm of fiber in muscles of the human trunk, limbs, and head. Xenotransplantation into mice of 50–70 fiber-associated, or 1,000–5,000 FACS-enriched CD56+/CD29+ human satellite cells led to stable engraftment and formation of human-derived myofibers. Human cells with characteristic PAX7, CD56, and CD29 expression patterns populated the satellite cell niche beneath the basal lamina on the periphery of regenerated fibers. After additional injury, transplanted satellite cells robustly regenerated to form hundreds of human-derived fibers. Together, these findings conclusively delineate a source of bona-fide endogenous human muscle stem cells that will aid development of clinical applications.

Abstract: This study determined if the anti-fibrotic drug, serelaxin (RLN), could augment human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-mediated reversal of airway remodeling and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) associated with chronic allergic airways disease (AAD/asthma). Female Balb/c mice subjected to the 9-week model of ovalbumin (OVA)-induced chronic AAD were either untreated or treated with MSCs alone, RLN alone or both combined from weeks 9–11. Changes in airway inflammation (AI), epithelial thickness, goblet cell metaplasia, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 expression, myofibroblast differentiation, subepithelial and total lung collagen deposition, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression, and AHR were then assessed. MSCs alone modestly reversed OVA-induced subepithelial and total collagen deposition, and increased MMP-9 levels above that induced by OVA alone (all p<0.05 vs OVA group). RLN alone more broadly reversed OVA-induced epithelial thickening, TGF-β1 expression, myofibroblast differentiation, airway fibrosis and AHR (all p<0.05 vs OVA group). Combination treatment further reversed OVA-induced AI and airway/lung fibrosis compared to either treatment alone (all p<0.05 vs either treatment alone), and further increased MMP-9 levels. RLN appeared to enhance the therapeutic effects of MSCs in a chronic disease setting; most likely a consequence of the ability of RLN to limit TGF-β1-induced matrix synthesis complemented by the MMP-promoting effects of MSCs.

Abstract: Summary
The advent of the human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) technology has transformed biomedical research, providing new tools for human disease modeling, drug development, and regenerative medicine. To fulfill its unique potential in the cardiovascular field, efficient methods should be developed for high-resolution, large-scale, long-term, and serial functional cellular phenotyping of hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). To achieve this goal, we combined the hiPSC technology with genetically encoded voltage (ArcLight) and calcium (GCaMP5G) fluorescent indicators. Expression of ArcLight and GCaMP5G in hiPSC-CMs permitted to reliably follow changes in transmembrane potential and intracellular calcium levels, respectively. This allowed monitoring short- and long-term changes in action-potential and calcium-handling properties and the development of arrhythmias in response to several pharmaceutical agents and in hiPSC-CMs derived from patients with different inherited arrhythmogenic syndromes. Combining genetically encoded fluorescent reporters with hiPSC-CMs may bring a unique value to the study of inherited disorders, developmental biology, and drug development and testing.

Abstract: Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is characterized by an arterial oxygenation defect induced by intrapulmonary vasodilation (IPVD) that increases morbidity and mortality. In our previous study, it was determined that both the proliferation and the myogenic differentiation of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) play a key role in the development of IPVD. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the relationship between IPVD and the myogenic differentiation of PMVECs remains unknown. Additionally, it has been shown that bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP2), via the control of protein expression, may regulate cell differentiation including cardiomyocyte differentiation, neuronal differentiation and odontoblastic differentiation. In this study, we observed that common bile duct ligation (CBDL)-rat serum induced the upregulation of the expression of several myogenic proteins (SM-α-actin, calponin, SM-MHC) and enhanced the expression levels of BMP2 mRNA and protein in PMVECs. We also observed that both the expression levels of Smad1/5 and the activation of phosphorylated Smad1/5 were significantly elevated in PMVECs following exposure to CBDL-rat serum, which was accompanied by the down-regulation of Smurf1. The blockage of the BMP2/Smad signaling pathway with Noggin inhibited the myogenic differentiation of PMVECs, a process that was associated with relatively low expression levels of both SM-α-actin and calponin in the setting of CBDL-rat serum exposure, although SM-MHC expression was not affected. These findings suggested that the BMP2/Smad signaling pathway is involved in the myogenic differentiation of the PMVECs. In conclusion, our data highlight the pivotal role of BMP2 in the CBDL-rat serum-induced myogenic differentiation of PMVECs via the activation of both Smad1 and Smad5 and the down-regulation of Smurf1, which may represent a potential therapy for HPS-induced pulmonary vascular remodeling.

Abstract: Changes in availability and utilisation of O2 and metabolic substrates are common in ischemia and cancer. We examined effects of substrate deprivation on HIF signalling in PC12 cells exposed to different atmospheric O2. Upon 2–4h moderate hypoxia, HIF-α protein levels were dictated by the availability of glutamine and glucose, essential for deep cell deoxygenation and glycolytic ATP flux. Nuclear accumulation of HIF-1α dramatically decreased upon inhibition of glutaminolysis or glutamine deprivation. Elevation of HIF-2α levels was transcription-independent and associated with the activation of Akt and Erk1/2. Upon 2h anoxia, HIF-2α levels strongly correlated with cellular ATP, produced exclusively via glycolysis. Without glucose, HIF signalling was suppressed, giving way to other regulators of cell adaptation to energy crisis, e.g. AMPK. Consequently, viability of cells deprived of O2 and glucose decreased upon inhibition of AMPK with dorsomorphin. The capacity of cells to accumulate HIF-2α decreased after 24h glucose deprivation. This effect, associated with increased AMPKα phosphorylation, was sensitive to dorsomorphin. In chronically hypoxic cells, glutamine played no major role in HIF-2α accumulation, which became mainly glucose-dependent. Overall, the availability of O2 and metabolic substrates intricately regulates HIF signalling by affecting cell oxygenation, ATP levels and pathways involved in production of HIF-α.

Abstract: The impact of the RNA-binding protein HuR for the post-transcriptional deregulation of tumor-relevant genes is well established. Despite of elevations in HuR expression levels, an increase in cytoplasmic HuR abundance in many cases correlates with a high grade of malignancy. Here, we demonstrated that administration of the actin-depolymerizing macrolide latrunculin A, or blebbistatin, an inhibitor of myosin II ATPase activity, caused a dose- and time-dependent reduction in the high cytoplasmic HuR content of HepG2 and Huh7 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Subcellular fractionation revealed that in addition, both inhibitors strongly attenuated cytoskeletal and membrane-bound HuR abundance and conversely increased the HuR amount in nuclear cell fractions. Concomitant with changes in intracellular HuR localization, both cytoskeletal inhibitors markedly decreased the half-lives of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), cyclin A and cyclin D1 encoding mRNAs resulting in a significant reduction in their expression levels in HepG2 cells. Importantly, a similar reduction in the expression of these HuR targets was achieved by a RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of either HuR or nonmuscle myoin IIA. Using polysomal fractionation, we further demonstrate that the decrease in cytoplasmic HuR by latrunculin A or blebbistatin is accompanied by a marked change in the allocation of HuR and its mRNA cargo from polysomes to ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles. Functionally, the basal migration and prostaglandin E2 synthesis are similarly impaired in inhibitor-treated and stable HuR-knockdown HepG2 cells. Our data demonstrate that interfering with the actomyosin-dependent HuR trafficking may comprise a valid therapeutic option for antagonizing pathologic posttranscriptional gene expression by HuR and furthermore emphasize the potential benefit of HuR inhibitory strategies for treatment of HCC.

Abstract: Wound healing is a complex process that involves the well-coordinated interactions of different cell types. Topical application of high doses of curcumin, a plant-derived polyphenol, enhances both normal and diabetic cutaneous wound healing in rodents. For optimal tissue repair interactions between epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts are essential. We previously demonstrated that curcumin increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and apoptosis in dermal fibroblasts, which could be prevented by pre-induction of the cytoprotective enzyme heme oxygenase (HO)-1. To better understand the effects of curcumin on wound repair, we now assessed the effects of high doses of curcumin on the survival of HaCaT keratinocytes and the role of the HO system. We exposed HaCaT keratinocytes to curcumin in the presence or absence of the HO-1 inducers heme (FePP) and cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP). We then assessed cell survival, ROS formation, and caspase activation. Curcumin induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in HaCaT keratinocytes via a ROS-dependent mechanism. Both FePP and CoPP induced HO-1 expression, but only FePP protected against curcumin-induced ROS formation and caspase-mediated apoptosis. In the presence of curcumin, FePP but not CoPP induced the expression of the iron scavenger ferritin. Together, our data show that the induction of ferritin, but not HO, protects HaCaT keratinocytes against cytotoxic doses of curcumin. The differential response of fibroblasts and keratinocytes to high curcumin doses may provide the basis for improving curcumin-based wound healing therapies.

Abstract: Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can be transfected by electroporation, liposomal reagents, and viral transduction methods. The cationic polymer polyethylenimine (PEI) has been shown to transfect a variety of differentiated mammalian cell types, including mouse ESCs, but existing methods require the use of additional equipment that is not readily accessible to most labs. Here we describe conditions that permit for the efficient transfection of mouse ESCs with low cytotoxicity and without the need for specialized equipment. Our goal was to devise a protocol for the PEI-mediated transfection of mouse ESCs that was comparable in ease to commercial transfection reagents. For these studies, we compared PEI transfection efficiency and cytotoxicity to a well-known liposomal transfection reagent, Lipofectamine2000™ (LF2K), using fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, cell viability assays, and Western blotting. We provide evidence that PEI transfection of mouse ESCs compares favorably to LF2K. Our optimized protocol for efficient transfection of mouse ESCs with PEI is detailed in this report.

Abstract: In contrast to urodele amphibians and teleost fish, mammals lack the regenerative responses to replace large body parts. Amphibian and fish regeneration uses dedifferentiation, i.e., reversal of differentiated state, as a means to produce progenitor cells to eventually replace damaged tissues. Therefore, induced activation of dedifferentiation responses in mammalian tissues holds an immense promise for regenerative medicine. Here we demonstrate that ectopic expression of Msx2 in cultured mouse myotubes recapitulates several aspects of amphibian muscle dedifferentiation. We found that MSX2, but not MSX1, leads to cellularization of myotubes and downregulates the expression of myotube markers, such as MHC, MRF4 and myogenin. RNA sequencing of myotubes ectopically expressing Msx2 showed downregulation of over 500 myotube-enriched transcripts and upregulation of over 300 myoblast-enriched transcripts. MSX2 selectively downregulated expression of Ptgs2 and Ptger4, two members of the prostaglandin pathway with important roles in myoblast fusion during muscle differentiation. Ectopic expression of Msx2, as well as Msx1, induced partial cell cycle re-entry of myotubes by upregulating CyclinD1 expression but failed to initiate S-phase. Finally, MSX2-induced dedifferentiation in mouse myotubes could be recapitulated by a pharmacological treatment with trichostatin A (TSA), bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) and fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1). Together, these observations indicate that MSX2 is a major driver of dedifferentiation in mammalian muscle cells.

Abstract: Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an inherited disorder that is characterized by progressive skeletal muscle weakness and wasting, with a failure of muscle maintenance/repair mediated by satellite cells (muscle stem cells). The function of skeletal muscle stem cells resident in dystrophic muscle may be perturbed by being in an increasing pathogenic environment, coupled with constant demands for repairing muscle. To investigate the contribution of satellite cell exhaustion to this process, we tested the functionality of satellite cells isolated from the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. We found that satellite cells derived from young mdx mice contributed efficiently to muscle regeneration within our in vivo mouse model. To then test the effects of long-term residence in a dystrophic environment, satellite cells were isolated from aged mdx muscle. Surprisingly, they were as functional as those derived from young or aged wild type donors. Removing satellite cells from a dystrophic milieu reveals that their regenerative capacity remains both intact and similar to satellite cells derived from healthy muscle, indicating that the host environment is critical for controlling satellite cell function.

Abstract: Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) acts as a facilitator of metastatic dissemination in the invasive margin of malignant tumors where active tumor–stromal crosstalks take place. Co-cultures of cancer cells with cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are often used as in vitro models of EMT. We established a tumor–fibroblast proximity co-culture using HT-29 tumor spheroids (TSs) with CCD-18co fibroblasts. When co-cultured with TSs, CCD-18co appeared activated, and proliferative activity as well as cell migration increased. Expression of fibronectin increased whereas laminin and type I collagen decreased in TSs co-cultured with fibroblasts compared to TSs alone, closely resembling the margin of in vivo xenograft tissue. Active TGFβ1 in culture media significantly increased in TS co-cultures but not in 2D co-cultures of cancer cells–fibroblasts, indicating that 3D context-associated factors from TSs may be crucial to crosstalks between cancer cells and fibroblasts. We also observed in TSs co-cultured with fibroblasts increased expression of α-SMA, EGFR and CTGF; reduced expression of membranous β-catenin and E-cadherin, together suggesting an EMT-like changes similar to a marginal region of xenograft tissue in vivo. Overall, our in vitro TS–fibroblast proximity co-culture mimics the EMT-state of the invasive margin of in vivo tumors in early metastasis.

Abstract: Background
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in cardiac developmental and pathological processes, and serum profile is useful for identifying novel miRNAs.
Methods and results
Serum samples were collected from unstable angina pectoris (UAP) and subclinical atherosclerotic (AS) patients. Solexa sequencing was used to predict novel miRNAs in 15 control individuals, 15 AS patients and 15 UAP patients. After bioinformatics analysis and filtering out in the newest version of miRbase (version 20.0), three novel miRNAs were validated in 80 control individuals, 80 AS patients and 80 UAP patients by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Two of the three novel microRNAs (N1 and N3) were expressed at the highest levels in the AS group. N1 had an area under curve (AUC) of 0.811 (95% confidence interval 0.743–0.880) for AS. N3 showed a moderate separation with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.748 (95% confidence interval 0.664–0.833) for AS. Combined the two novel microRNAs can significantly distinguish AS from control.
Conclusions
Three novel miRNAs were identified by Solexa sequencing and two of them may be new potential predictors for arthrosclerosis.

Abstract: Background
Human choriocarcinoma, a highly curable solid tumour, is exceptionally sensitive to methotrexate-based chemotherapy at the metastatic stage. The present study aimed to investigate the molecular basis for this resistance to methotrexate therapy occurs in some cases, and these patients subsequently die from progressive and advanced disease.
Methods
The autophagy and apoptotic activity regulated by PERK/ATF4 axis in methotrexate-resistant JEG-3 and parental cells were evaluated with western blotting and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). The regulatory relationships among the reactive oxygen species (ROS), JNK/p62 axis, PERK/ATF4-mediated apoptosis and autophagy were assessed with western blotting, RT-PCR, fluorescence-activated cell sorting as well as ChIP.
Results
The decreased apoptosis in methotrexate-resistant JEG-3 cells was observed with an up-regulation of protective autophagy, suggesting a switch from apoptosis to autophagy, which was regulated via the PERK/ATF4 pathway under condition of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Further experiments demonstrated that this cell death switch was regulated by ROS-mediated JNK/p62 pathway and subsequently lead to the resistance of choriocarcinoma cells to methotrexate treatment.
Conclusions
This study provides evidence to explain a survival mechanism of the switch from ER stress-induced apoptosis to autophagy via ROS-mediated JNK/p62 signals in methotrexate-resistant choriocarcinoma cells and may implicate the chemotherapy of methotrexate resistance in choriocarcinoma.

Abstract: The application of satellite cell-derived myoblasts in regenerative medicine has been restricted by the rapid loss of stemness during in vitro cell expansion using traditional culture systems. However, studies published in the past decade have highlighted the influence of substrate elasticity on stem cell fate and revealed that culture on a soft hydrogel substrate can promote self-renewal and prolong the regenerative potential of muscle stem cells. Whether hydrogel substrates have similar effects after long-term robust expansion remains to be determined. Herein we prepared an elastic chitosan/beta-glycerophosphate/collagen hydrogel mimicking the soft microenvironment of muscle tissues for use as the substrate for satellite cell culture and investigated its influence on long-term cell expansion. After 20 passages in culture, satellite cell-derived myoblasts cultured on our hydrogel substrate exhibited significant improvements in proliferation capability, cell viability, colony forming frequency, and potential for myogenic differentiation compared to those cultured on a routine rigid culture surface. Immunochemical staining and western blot analysis both confirmed that myoblasts cultured on the hydrogel substrate expressed higher levels of several differentiation-related markers, including Pax7, Pax3, and SSEA-1, and a lower level of MyoD compared to myoblasts cultured on rigid culture plates (all p<0.05). After transplantation into the tibialis anterior of nude mice, myoblasts that had been cultured on the hydrogel substrate demonstrated a significantly greater engraftment efficacy than those cultured on the traditional surface. Collectively, these results indicate that the elastic hydrogel substrate supported robust expansion of murine myoblasts and enhanced their engraftment in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
During red-blood-cell-stage infection of Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite undergoes repeated rounds of replication, egress, and invasion. Erythrocyte invasion involves specific interactions between host cell receptors and parasite ligands and coordinated expression of genes specific to this step of the life cycle. We show that a parasite-specific bromodomain protein, PfBDP1, binds to chromatin at transcriptional start sites of invasion-related genes and directly controls their expression. Conditional PfBDP1 knockdown causes a dramatic defect in parasite invasion and growth and results in transcriptional downregulation of multiple invasion-related genes at a time point critical for invasion. Conversely, PfBDP1 overexpression enhances expression of these same invasion-related genes. PfBDP1 binds to acetylated histone H3 and a second bromodomain protein, PfBDP2, suggesting a potential mechanism for gene recognition and control. Collectively, these findings show that PfBDP1 critically coordinates expression of invasion genes and indicate that targeting PfBDP1 could be an invaluable tool in malaria eradication.
