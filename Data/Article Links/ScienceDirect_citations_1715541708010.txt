Abstract: A new air-stable triarylamine-based amorphous polymer, TSP-T11, which consists of thiophene and triarylamine units, can be successfully utilized to fabricate bulk-heterojunction organic photovoltaics (OPVs) using PC60BM or PC70BM as acceptor materials. The highest level of performance of OPVs optimized at TSP-T11:PC70BM (weight ratios of 1:4) with thicknesses of 68nm exhibited an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.75V, a short circuit current (Jsc) of 8.03mAcm−2, and a power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.22% under simulated air mass 1.5 solar irradiation at 100mWcm−2. Although TSP-T11 has a lower hole mobility (1.5×10−4cm2V−1s−1) than P3HT, the use of amorphous film of TSP-T11 as a donor material for OPVs offers advantages over the use of polycrystalline film of P3HT in terms of its air-stability and pinhole-free homogeneous morphology.

Abstract: Although connexin has been recognized as a tumor suppressor in many types of cancer, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We have previously shown that transfection of connexin43 (Cx43) cDNA retarded the growth of a highly metastatic human pulmonary giant cell carcinoma cell line, PG, both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we further demonstrate that the metastasis and invasion, but not the migration, of PG cells are also inhibited following Cx43 transfection. The diminishment of metastasis and invasion is associated with down-regulation of genes including MMP-2, S100A, LAMA4, and HDAC10, as well as up-regulation of genes such as MTSS1 and FSTL1 as revealed by gene chip analysis. Interestingly, the suppression effects of Cx43 are related to secreted factor(s), which are blocked by FSTL1 antibody treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the FSTL1 promoter was shown to be associated with acetylated histones H3 and H4 upon Cx43 transfection. These data suggest that Cx43 inhibits the invasion and metastasis of PG cells by modulating the secretion of FSTL1, which is regulated by histone acetylation. Cx43 may act as a “histone deacetylase inhibitor” to modulate gene expression and subsequent cellular functions in PG cells.

Abstract: Mg–Ni thin films as a switchable mirror material are promising for application in energy-saving windows because they can change their state between reflective and transparent by hydrogenation and dehydrogenation. In our previous work, we found that electrochromic switchable mirror glass based on a Mg4Ni thin film is affected by environmental factors such as temperature and humidity. In this work, we investigated the effects of the environment on the optical switching properties of electrochromic switchable mirrors with Mg–Ni thin films of various compositions suitable for a broad range of applications and operating environments. When the mirror devices were kept in a simulated environment with a constant temperature 40°C and a constant relative humidity of 80%, controlled by a thermostat/humidistat bath, their optical switching properties degraded. The degradation was found to be related to the change in the Mg–Ni thin films into nonmetallic states of oxides and hydroxides. The device with a Mg6Ni thin film kept in the bath for 7 days showed no optical switching property. The mechanism of degradation in the bath was strongly affected by the composition of the Mg–Ni thin-film optical switching layer. The device constructed with an optical switching layer having high magnesium content degraded more rapidly in the test.

Abstract: The main objective of this study was to broaden the assortment of I−/I3− redox ionic liquids using polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) acting as nanobuilding blocks for the construction of functionalized 1,3-alkylimidazolium iodide solid (melting temperature 150–200°C) and room temperature (RT) ionic liquids. The structural characteristics of the synthesised final ionic liquids and the corresponding intermediates were determined using 1H, 29Si NMR and infrared spectroscopic measurements. Raman spectra were next reported, in order to demonstrate the presence of polyiodides formed after the addition of iodine and the formation of redox electrolytes. Ionic conductivity values obtained from the impedance (EIS) spectra were determined in the temperature interval from room temperature up to 100°C. Finally, a hybrid electrochromic cell was constructed from room temperature MePrIm+Ix− IO7 T8 POSS (x=1, 1.2, 3 and 5) ionic liquids encapsulated between a lithiated WO3 working and Pt counter-electrode, and colouring–bleaching changes assessed for cells cycled up to 1000 repetitive cycles.

Abstract: Organic photovoltaic devices using an electrode of indium tin oxide (ITO) coated with a buffer layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) exposed to controlled humidity during fabrication showed a 65–75% decrease in efficiency and displayed S-shaped J–V curves, changes, which are attributed to different levels of indium and tin migration into the PEDOT:PSS film. A distinct shift in the secondary electron cut-off in the UV Photoelectron spectra (UPS) of ITO/PEDOT:PSS samples exposed to controlled humidity indicate an increase of the dipole at the ITO/PEDOT:PSS interface, which could explain the appearance of S-shaped J–V curves. Additionally, the electron density at low binding energies is reduced for the humidity exposed PEDOT:PSS suggesting a second mechanism for decreased device performance.

Abstract: Heart failure is a consequence of progressive deterioration of cardiac performance. Little is known about the role of impaired oxidative phosphorylation in the progression of the disease, since previous studies of mitochondrial injuries are restricted to end-stage chronic heart failure. The present study aimed at evaluating the involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction in the development of human heart failure. We measured the control of oxidative phosphorylation with high-resolution respirometry in permeabilized myocardial fibres from donor hearts (controls), and patients with no or mild heart failure but presenting with heart disease, or chronic heart failure due to dilated or ischemic cardiomyopathy. The capacity of the phosphorylation system exerted a strong limitation on oxidative phosphorylation in the human heart, estimated at 121pmolO2s−1mg−1 in the healthy left ventricle. In heart disease, a specific defect of the phosphorylation system, Complex I-linked respiration, and mass-specific fatty acid oxidation were identified. These early defects were also significant in chronic heart failure, where the capacities of the oxidative phosphorylation and electron transfer systems per cardiac tissue mass were decreased with all tested substrate combinations, suggesting a decline of mitochondrial density. Oxidative phosphorylation and electron transfer system capacities were higher in ventricles compared to atria, but the impaired mitochondrial quality was identical in the four cardiac chambers of chronic heart failure patients. Coupling was preserved in heart disease and chronic heart failure, in contrast to the mitochondrial dysfunction observed after prolonged cold storage of cardiac tissue. Mitochondrial defects in the phosphorylation system, Complex I respiration and mass-specific fatty acid oxidation occurred early in the development of heart failure. Targeting these mitochondrial injuries with metabolic therapy may offer a promising approach to delay the progression of heart disease.

Abstract: Introduction of deep level defects during thermal diffusion of phosphorous (P) in silicon (Si) using spin-on-doping (SOD) from phosphosilicate glass (PSG) was studied using deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS). The structure was utilized as a solar cell and defect-induced-degradation of the cell efficiency was studied and modeled. The light current–voltage (LIV) measurements performed on as-fabricated solar cell yielded open circuit voltage, short-circuit current density, fill factor (FF) and efficiency to be 540mV, 24mA/cm2, 40% and 5%, respectively. Whilst the simulation of the similar solar cell using AFORS-HET software revealed significantly higher data than the experimental ones. However, by including three deep level defects H1–H3 (holes) having activation energies (eV) 0.23, 0.33 and 0.41 in the modeled solar cell, the simulated results were observed in remarkably good agreement with experimental data. Our DLTS measurements practically witnessed H1–H3 defect levels in p-layer of the cell.

Abstract: Sunlight irradiating the surface of the Earth represents a maximum input available for a solar catalytic process of 50WUVm−2. Reticulated macroporous foams, which exhibit an open three-dimensional network structures, were studied in order to make good use of UV rays to break down molecules. The aim was to assess the apparent quantum yield of the media used for the photocatalysis. The optical properties of the medium were ascertained using an experimental optical setup. The measurement of the degradation kinetics was carried out on 2-4 dichlorophenol. The main objective of the present study was to determine the most favorable structure for use of UV rays and to understand what structure should be developed to increase the efficiency of the medium.

Abstract: Epidemiological studies and animal models suggest an association between high levels of dietary fat intake and an increased risk of developing breast cancer. Epithelial–mesenchymal-transition (EMT) is a process, by which epithelial cells are transdifferentiated to a mesenchymal state, and it has been implicated in cancer progression, including invasion and metastasis. Linoleic acid (LA) induces proliferation and invasion in breast cancer cells. However, the role of LA on the EMT process in human mammary epithelial cells remains to be studied. In the present study, we demonstrate that LA induces a transient down-regulation of E-cadherin expression, accompanied with an increase of Snail1, Snail2, Twist1, Twist2 and Sip1 expressions. Furthermore, LA induces FAK and NFκB activation, MMP-2 and -9 secretions, migration and invasion. In summary, our findings demonstrate, for the first time, that LA promotes an EMT-like process in MCF10A human mammary epithelial cells.

Abstract: We demonstrate the flexibility of UV nanoimprint lithography for effective light trapping in p–i–n a-Si:H/μc-Si:H tandem solar cells. A textured polymeric layer covered with pyramidal transparent conductive oxide structures is shown as an ideal system to promote front light scattering and thus enhanced photocurrent. The double structure incorporated into micromorph tandem thin film silicon solar cells is systematically investigated in order to find a relationship between interface morphology, optical properties and photovoltaic characteristics. To prevent the formation of defects during cell growth, a controllable smoothing of the imprinted texture is developed. Modules grown on polymer structures smoothed via multi-replication show excellent performance reaching a photocurrent of 12.6mA/cm2 and an efficiency of 12.8%.

Abstract: Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) is an adaptor protein which involves in the activation of the transcription factor, nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB), in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor pathway. This signaling is modulated by proteins that interact with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2. In this study, we identified the zinc-finger protein AWP1 as a tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2-interacting protein through yeast two-hybrid screening. We found that AWP1 directly interacted with the C-terminal tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) domain of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2. Knockdown of AWP1 using small hairpin RNA significantly decreased nuclear factor kappaB activity but increased tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα)-induced apoptosis, presumably by decreasing the induction of nuclear factor kappaB-responsive anti-apoptotic molecules, including FICE-like inhibitory protein (FLIP), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL. In contrast, overexpression of wild-type AWP1 inhibited nuclear factor kappaB activation. Detailed domain mapping experiments showed that the AN1 domain of AWP1 mediated the functional interaction with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2, and the A20 domain was responsible for the negative regulation of nuclear factor kappaB activation. Importantly, ectopic AWP1 overexpression led to an A20 domain-dependent increase in K-48 ubiquitination of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2. These data indicate that AWP1 binds to tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 and that regulates tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced nuclear factor kappaB activation through two distinct domains.

Abstract: We report the tunnel current through a miniband in In0.4Ga0.6As quantum dot (QD) superlattice solar cells fabricated using molecular beam epitaxy. High-quality and well-aligned In0.4Ga0.6As QD superlattice structures with an interdot spacing of 3.5nm were grown without using a strain balancing technique. 10-stack In0.4Ga0.6As QD superlattice solar cells had a high open circuit voltage and good cell characteristics even when the interdot spacing was reduced to 3.5nm. Moreover, a short-circuit current density increases as the interdot spacing decreases. From the temperature dependence of the external quantum efficiency for QD solar cells with different interdot spacings, we observed the tunnel current through a miniband in QD superlattices with an interdot spacing of 3.5nm.

Abstract: We describe the synthesis of two novel poly(1,4-arylene-2,5-thienylene)s P1 and P2 containing benzo[c][2,1,3]thiadiazole monomeric units via Suzuki–Miyaura polymerization of a thiophene diboronic ester with aryl diiodides. The use of a catalyst complex consisting of Pd(OAc)2 in combination with the electron-rich biaryl phosphine S-Phos resulted in efficient polymerization reactions. The polymers synthesized, P1 and P2, were characterized by UV–vis spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. Theoretical calculations and electrochemical measurements on P1 suggested a favorable position of the molecular orbitals for employment in polymer solar cells in combination with PCBM. Devices containing P1:PCBM 1:2 in the active layer showed an efficiency of 1.2% by simple spin casting from chloroform.

Abstract: We systemically investigate the size-dependent behavior of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) tested under partial illumination. An illumination mask was hypothesized to limit uncertainty associated with device size and illumination conditions when measurements are conducted on laboratory scales. Introducing the illumination mask into the measurement improves the accuracy of JSC; however partial illumination will result in a decrease in VOC and an increase in FF. This last observation is explained by diodes contributing both light and dark currents in the measurement. In addition to loss due to the energy required to separate bound excitons, these results suggest that non-optimized photo–dark current ratio could be another reason why measured VOC is less than ideal VOC.

Abstract: Angiogenesis is thoroughly balanced and regulated in health; however, it is dysregulated in many diseases including cancer, age-related macular degeneration, cardiovascular diseases such as coronary and peripheral artery diseases and stroke, abnormal embryonic development, and abnormal wound healing. In addition to angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis is pivotal for maintaining the immune system, homeostasis of body fluids and lymphoid organs; dysregulated lymphangiogenesis may cause inflammatory diseases and lymph node mediated tumor metastasis. Anti-angiogenic or anti-lymphangiogenic small peptides may play an important role as therapeutic agents normalizing angiogenesis or lymphangiogenesis in disease conditions. Several novel endogenous peptides derived from proteins containing a conserved somatotropin domain have been previously identified with the help of our bioinformatics-based methodology. These somatotropin peptides were screened for inhibition of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis using in vitro proliferation, migration, adhesion and tube formation assays with blood and lymphatic endothelial cells. We found that the peptides have the potential for inhibiting both angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. Focusing the study on the inhibition of lymphangiogenesis, we found that a peptide derived from the somatotropin conserved domain of transmembrane protein 45A human was the most potent lymphangiogenesis inhibitor, blocking lymphatic endothelial cell migration, adhesion, and tube formation.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the mechanisms leading to the power conversion efficiency improvement in poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) based organic solar cells using calcium (Ca) in cathode structures. Ultraviolet and x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (UPS and XPS) indicate that chemical reactions occur at the P3HT/Ca interface. Upon Ca deposition, UPS results illustrate a 0.8eV-downward shift in energy levels of P3HT, but not in those of PCBM. In addition to forming an ohmic contact at the cathode the presence of Ca widens the energy difference between the HOMO of P3HT and the LUMO of PCBM at the cathode interfaces, which results in the increase of open circuit voltage and the enhancement of device efficiency.

Abstract: In order to obtain stable phase change composites with a high PEG load and enthalpy, a series of polyethylene glycol (PEG) based phase change composites with different mesoporous materials (active carbon and silica molecular sieves) were prepared by a simple approach. Various characterization techniques were carried out to investigate the properties of the composites. It was observed that both the porous characteristics and surface properties of the mesoporous stabilizers combined affected the crystallinity and phase change behavior of PEG. Among the various composites, PEG/AC PCMs with 80wt% of PEG had the largest latent heat, a relatively low melting point, the least supercooling and a higher heat storage efficiency. This study will provide insight into the fabrication of stabilized polymer based high performance phase change systems for heat storage application.

Abstract: Recombination of charge carriers due to electronically active material defects is one of the major factors limiting power conversion efficiency in solar cells. We have studied the defect behavior in CuInSxSe2−x solar cells fabricated through a solution process with a maximum heating temperature of 390°C. By introducing a cadmium ion soaking step into the fabrication process, we find that the recombination rate can be reduced. Through the use of capacitance–voltage (C–V) profiling, drive level capacitance profiling (DLCP) and admittance spectroscopy analysis, the cadmium ion soaking process was found to increase the charge carrier concentration in the bulk of the absorber, and shift the energy level of the N1 defect toward the valence band edge. The soaking process was found to most obviously affect the open circuit voltage with an average improvement of 33mV.

Abstract: Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) is a p-type semiconductor, candidate to replace Cu(In,Ga)Se2 as absorber layer in thin film solar cells. The best solar cells based on CZTS present efficiencies up to 6.8%. These results were improved when metallic Zn was replaced by ZnS, which may imply a different chemical path for the formation of CZTS. In this study it is compared with the diffusion of Zn on Cu2SnS3 by introducing metallic Zn or ZnS. For this CZTS films were grown by sulphurization of Cu2SnS3, some with a Zn layer and others with a ZnS layer. The influence of H2 during the annealing process is also studied and for this some sulphurizations were done in the presence of a partial atmosphere of H2.The SEM micrographs of the samples show a columnar growth structure of the films with different degrees of compactness. The compactness is improved in the samples where a ZnS layer was present in the precursor and the sulphurization was done in the presence of H2. EDS chemical profiling revealed regular zinc distribution for the samples with metallic Zn whilst the ones with ZnS exhibited a Zn-rich surface. X-ray diffraction (XRD) indicated the presence of CZTS and Cu2−xS phases in all samples. These results were confirmed by Raman scattering. It was concluded that the sulphurization of Cu2SnS3 films with the use of ZnS layers under H2 atmosphere produces better quality CZTS thin films, since it promotes Zn diffusion and avoids Zn losses by evaporation.

Abstract: A concentration gradient in a mixed absorber layer with increasing content of donor (acceptor) towards the hole (electron) collecting contact could improve the charge carrier collection in bulk heterojunction organic solar cells. We study p-i-metal type solar cells where the gradient in a 45nm thick ZnPc:C60 absorber layer is introduced by varying the deposition rate during co-evaporation. It is shown that the observed increase in the performance is mainly caused by a better energy level alignment and reduced recombination at the p-side. A significant influence on charge carrier transport is not observed. However, regions with a concentration of less than 20% of one component do not fully contribute to the photocurrent. Voltage dependent external quantum efficiency data are used to identify the photoactive regions.

Abstract: In this work, we report a detailed material study of ultrafast laser textured silicon surfaces to gain insight into the impact of ultrafast laser processing conditions on photovoltaic device properties. A comprehensive study of the ultrafast laser processed silicon is achieved by determination of crystal structure and elemental compositional changes using transmission electron microscopy, compositional mapping by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and depth profiling compositional determination using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. We have observed material non-homogeneity, impurity incorporation and strained silicon, all limited to the surface. A combination of chemical etching and thermal annealing was used to remove the laser induced changes and the material was restored to its starting quality. Further, silicon solar cell devices on such defect-etched surfaces are fabricated. These devices are characterized through dark i–v analysis and Fourier transform deep level transient spectroscopy for defect analysis.

Abstract: Prostate cancer (PCa) continues to be one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths among American men. The prostate relies upon the androgen receptor (AR) to mediate the effects of androgens on normal growth, a reliance that is maintained during malignant prostate growth. Caveolin-1 (Cav-1), the main structural component of caveolae, has been shown to promote the malignant growth and invasion of prostate tumors. In vitro work has shown that Cav-1 can act as an AR coactivator by enhancing its transciptional activity. However, it is unknown how Cav-1 affects androgen-dependent growth and signaling in vivo. To explore this role, a novel mouse model of Cav-1 overexpression was developed with a hormone-insensitive promoter. Cav-1 transgenic (Tg) mice subjected to castration and androgen stimulation display enlarged prostate weights and increased DNA synthesis. Through gene transcript and proteomic profiling, we demonstrate that Cav-1 overexpression favors androgen-regulated responses and enhances processes involved in transcription, cell cycle progression and protein synthesis. Interestingly, Cav-1 overexpression was associated with an increase in the phosphorylation of AR on serine 210, a post-translational modification linked to its activity under androgen-stimulated conditions. In addition, these mice exhibited an increase in the phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 protein on serine 235/236 (pS6), a marker of protein synthesis and a downstream component of the mTOR pathway. Thus, Cav-1 Tg mice could serve as a novel model for studying AR-regulated pathways involved in prostate growth and proliferation.

Fas/FasL-dependent and -independent activation of caspase-8 in doxorubicin-treated human breast cancer MCF-7 cells: ADAM10 down-regulation activates Fas/FasL signaling pathway,

Abstract: The contribution of Fas-mediated death pathway to doxorubicin-induced death of MCF-7 cells is not unambiguously elucidated. Thus, this study was conducted to explore doxorubicin-induced Fas/FasL signaling pathway activation in MCF-7 cells and doxorubicin-resistant MCF-7 (MCF-7/Dox) cells. Doxorubicin-induced caspase-8 activation was found to be mediated through Akt/ERK inactivation and FasL-independent Fas pathway in MCF-7 cells, while caspase-8 activation in MCF-7/Dox cells depended exclusively on FasL-stimulated Fas pathway. Suppression of caspase-8 activation restored the viability of doxorubicin-treated MCF-7 cells and MCF-7/Dox cells. Contrary to FasL surface expression exclusively detected in MCF-7/Dox cells, intracellular FasL expression was noted with MCF-7 cells. Promotion of FasL translocation to the cell surface by lysophosphatidic acid evoked a FasL-activated Fas death pathway in MCF-7 cells. Doxorubixin-evoked β-TrCP up-regulation promoted Sp1 degradation, which subsequently suppressed ADAM10 expression in MCF-7 and MCF-7/Dox cells. Doxorubicin-induced down-regulation of ADAM10 reduced FasL shedding, leading to Fas pathway activation in MCF-7/Dox cells. Knock-down of ADAM10 induced death in MCF-7/Dox cells, but marginally reduced the viability of MCF-7 cells. Taken together, our data indicate that Akt/ERK-mediated caspase-8 activation and Fas/FasL-mediated caspase-8 activation mostly elucidate doxorubicin-induced death in MCF-7 cells and MCF-7/Dox cells, respectively. These observations suggest a promising therapeutic modality for overcoming doxorubicin-resistant breast cancer by targeting ADAM10 sheddase activity.

Abstract: A series of dicyanovinyl-oligothiophenes are investigated concerning their thermal stability, absorption in thin film, and hole mobility. Due to very high extinction coefficients, these materials are interesting for application as donor in solar cells. The quinquethiophene DCV2-5T, which shows a hole mobility of 2.2×10–5cm2/Vs, is used as donor material in a flat heterojunction organic small molecule solar cells. Despite a very thin donor layer of only 6nm, these devices exhibit in a planar heterojunction with 15nm C60 an efficiency of up to 2.8% with a fill factor of up to 58%, a short circuit current density of 5.2mA/cm2, an open circuit voltage of 1.03V, and an external quantum efficiency of 30% in the green spectral range.

Abstract: We propose a novel type of highly efficient solar cells: intermediate-band-assisted hot-carrier solar cells (IB-HC-SCs). Carriers are generated by two-step photo-excitation via intermediate bands, and extracted through energy-selective contacts before they are completely thermalized. The two-step excitation dramatically reduces entropy generation associated with hot-carrier extraction. As a result, limiting conversion efficiency is significantly improved to be around 60% (0.1 sun)–70% (1000 sun), even though considering a finite thermalization time of hot carriers being 1ns. This improvement is contrasting to the fact that the limiting conversion efficiency of usual hot-carrier cells under 1 sun irradiation is higher only slightly than the Shockley–Queisser limit (34%), because of the remarkable entropy generation.

Abstract: The photovoltaic properties of bulk-heterojunction solar cells with an active layer made of an alternating fluorene copolymer, poly{[2,7-(9,9-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-fluorene)]-alt-[5,5-(4,7-di-2′-thienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)]}, and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methylester are investigated by varying the blend composition and the incident light power intensity. An efficient donor–acceptor intermixing is reached with donor to acceptor weight ratios of at least 1:3, while at lower acceptor content charge trapping effects are evidenced by the light intensity dependent study. Reverse bias analysis demonstrates that a major limiting factor for the performance of the investigated solar cells is represented by the poor ability of the generation of free charge carriers, attributed to the low hole mobility in the polymer phase.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
Allograft involvement can occur in some renal transplant recipients who develop post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD). We aimed to find indications and/or contraindications for nephrectomy in renal allograft PTLD based on an outcome analysis of previous reports.
DESIGN AND SETTING
A comprehensive search of Pubmed and Google scholar was performed to find reports of different treatment strategies addressing PTLD occurring within the allograft after renal transplantation.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients who underwent nephrectomy due to kidney allograft localization by PTLD were categorized as the case group, and renal recipients with kidney PTLD for whom nonsurgical treatment modalities were used served as controls.
RESULTS
Survival analysis demonstrated that patients with renal allograft involvement who underwent allograft nephrectomy had a significantly better outcome compared to patients for whom a non-surgical approach was used (P=.03). In patients with disseminated PTLD, nephrectomy was not useful (P>.1). Patients with simultaneous kidney and lung complications by PTLD benefitted from nephrectomy.
CONCLUSIONS
We found that patients with renal graft complication with disseminated PTLD do not benefit from nephrectomy, which can be considered the only contraindication. However, some particular PTLD co-localizations were not as likely to adversely affect the benefit of nephrectomy in these patients, and these can be considered indications for the procedure. Future multicenter studies are needed to confirm our results.

Abstract: The early stage growth mechanisms of sublimation-grown thin-film polycrystalline CdTe are evaluated by growth interrupts and ex-situ SEM/AFM analysis for growth under 100Torr of inert gas. Development of island size, density and coverage demonstrates that growth proceeds by island nucleation, island growth and density increase, followed by coalescence, channel formation and secondary nucleation. Addition of material to the islands occurs partly by the ‘step-flow’ mechanism. Grains in the completed films are considered to arise from individual nuclei. Nucleation and coalescence models are used to explain the correlation between increased substrate temperature and increased CdTe grain size in sublimation deposited CdTe films.

Abstract: Solid-state Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (ss-DSSCs) are promising candidates for future low cost photovoltaic energy generation and are based on polymer/metal oxide donor/acceptor heterojunctions. However, a crucial drawback of hybrid solar cells is the use of environmental unfriendly solvents, such as toluene, chloroform, chlorobenzene, etc. in the phase of preparation. In this work towards eco-friendly processing, we use water as a solvent in the preparation of the photo-active layer for hybrid solar cells. We demonstrate eco-friendly hybrid polymer/titania solar cells consisting of water soluble polythiophene as light-absorber, donor and Hole Transporting Layer (HTL), above a TiO2 layer that acts as an acceptor and electron conductor. The water soluble conjugated polymer materials are studied in terms of their opto-electrical and morphological properties, leading to a better understanding of the resulting photovoltaic performance. An alternative new processing method in device preparation is introduced; yielding prototype solar cells with an efficiency of 0.7%. This promising solar cell device performance can be considered as a proof-of-principle for future eco-friendly solar cells.

Nonsense mutations of the bHLH transcription factor TWIST2 found in Setleis Syndrome patients cause dysregulation of periostin,

Abstract: Setleis Syndrome (OMIM ID: 227260) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by abnormal facial development. Recently, we have reported that two nonsense mutations (c.486C>T [Q119X] and c.324C>T [Q65X]) of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor TWIST2 cause Setleis Syndrome. Here we show that periostin, a cell adhesion protein involved in connective tissue development and maintenance, is down-regulated in Setleis Syndrome patient fibroblast cells and that periostin positively responds to manipulations in TWIST2 levels, suggesting that TWIST2 is a transactivator of periostin. Functional analysis of the TWIST2 mutant form (Q119X) revealed that it maintains the ability to localize to the nucleus, forms homo and heterodimers with the ubiquitous bHLH protein E12, and binds to dsDNA. Reporter gene assays using deletion constructs of the human periostin promoter also reveal that TWIST2 can activate this gene more specifically than Twist1, while the Q119X mutant results in no significant transactivation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that both wild-type TWIST2 and the Q119X mutant bind the periostin promoter, however only wild-type TWIST2 is associated with higher levels of histone acetylation across the 5′-regulatory region of periostin. Taken together, these data suggest that the C-terminal domain of TWIST2, which is missing in the Q119X mutant form of TWIST2, is responsible for proper transactivation of the periostin gene. Improper regulation of periostin by the mutant form of TWIST2 could help explain some of the soft tissue abnormalities seen in these patients therefore providing a genotype–phenotype relationship for Setleis Syndrome.

Drosophila arf72A acts as an essential regulator of endoplasmic reticulum quality control and suppresses autosomal-dominant retinopathy,

Abstract: The eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum operates multiple quality control mechanisms to ensure that only properly folded proteins are exported to their final destinations via the secretory pathway and those that are not are destroyed via the degradation pathway. However, molecular mechanisms underlying such regulated exportation to these distinct routes are unknown. In this article, we report the role of Drosophila arf72A – the fly homologue of the mammalian Arl1 – in the quality checks of proteins and in the autosomal-dominant retinopathy. ARF72A localizes to the Golgi membranes of Drosophila photoreceptor cells, consistent with mammalian Arl1 localization in cell culture systems. A loss of arf72A function changes the membrane character of the endoplasmic reticulum and shifts the membrane balance between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex toward the Golgi complex, resulting in over-proliferated Golgi complexes and accelerated protein secretion. Interestingly, our study indicated that more ARF72A localized on the endoplasmic reticulum in the ninaED1 photoreceptor cell, a Drosophila model of autosomal-dominant retinitis pigmentosa, compared to that in the wild-type. In addition, arf72A loss was shown to rescue the ninaED1–related membrane accumulation and the rhodopsin maturation defect, and suppress ninaED1–triggered retinal degeneration, indicating that rhodopsin accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum bypasses the quality checks. While previous studies of ARF small GTPases have focused on their roles in vesicular budding and transport between the specific organelles, our findings establish an additional function of arf72A in the quality check machinery of the endoplasmic reticulum distinguishing the cargoes for secretion from those for degradation.

Abstract: Adult stem cells are important cell sources in regenerative medicine, but isolating them is technically challenging. This study employed a novel strategy to generate stem-like corneal epithelial cells and promote the functional properties of these cells by coculture with embryonic stem cells. The primary corneal epithelial cells were labelled with GFP and cocultured with embryonic stem cells in a transwell or by direct cell–cell contact. The embryonic stem cells were pre-transfected with HSV-tk-puro plasmids and became sensitive to ganciclovir. After 10 days of coculture, the corneal epithelial cells were isolated by treating the cultures with ganciclovir to kill the embryonic stem cells. The expression of stem cell-associated markers (ABCG2, p63) increased whereas the differentiation mark (Keratin 3) decreased in corneal epithelial cells isolated from the cocultures as evaluated by RT-PCR and flow cytometry. Their functional properties of corneal epithelial cells, including cell adhesion, migration and proliferation, were also enhanced. These cells could regenerate a functional stratified corneal epithelial equivalent but did not form tumors. Integrin β1, phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase and Akt were significantly upregulated in corneal epithelial cells. FAK Inhibitor 14 that suppressed the expression of phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase and Akt inhibited cell adhesion, migration and proliferation. LY294002 that suppressed phosphorylated Akt but not phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase inhibited cell proliferation but had no effect on cell adhesion or migration. These findings demonstrated that the functional properties of stem-like corneal epithelial cells were enhanced by cocultured embryonic stem cells via activation of the integrin β1-FAK-PI3K/Akt signalling pathway.

Abstract: We simulated device characteristics of a-Si:H single junction, μc-Si:H single junction and a-Si:H/μc-Si:H tandem solar cells with the numerical device simulator Advanced Semiconductor Analysis (ASA). For this purpose we measured and adjusted electrical and optical input parameters by comparing measured and simulated external quantum efficiency, current−voltage characteristic and reflectivity spectra. Consistent reproducibility of experimental data by numerical simulation was achieved for all types of cells investigated in this work. We also show good correspondence between the experimental and simulated characteristics for a-Si:H/μc-Si:H tandem solar cells with various absorber thicknesses on both Asahi U-type SnO2:F and sputtered/etched (Jülich) ZnO:Al substrates. Based on this good correlation between experiment and theory, we provide insight into device properties that are not directly measurable like the spatially resolved absorptance and the voltage-dependent carrier collection. These data reveal that the difference between tandem solar cells grown on Asahi U-type and Jülich ZnO substrates primarily arises from their optical properties. In addition, we find out that the doped layers do not contribute to the photocurrent except for the front p-layer. We also calculated the initial efficiencies of a-Si:H/μc-Si:H tandem solar cells with different combinations of a-Si:H and μc-Si:H absorber layer thicknesses. The maximum efficiency is found at 260nm/1500nm for tandem solar cells on Asahi U-type substrates and at 360nm/850nm for tandem solar cells on Jülich ZnO substrates.

Abstract: The authors have attentively investigated the roles of the thermal annealing in the thin blended film of a novel low band-gap polymer poly[(4,4-bis(2-ethyl)cyclopenta- [2,1-b:3,4-b’]dithiophene)-2,6-diyl-alt-(5-octylthieo[3,4-b]pyrrole-4,6-dione)-1,3-diyl] (PCPDTTPD) and [6,6]-phenyl C60 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). The surface morphology, optical absorption spectra and carrier mobility of the PCPDTTPD:PCBM film as a function of annealing temperature were investigated. Open-circuit voltage as high as 0.86V was obtained in the PCPDTTPD:PCBM active layer based organic photovoltaics. The post-deposition annealing effects on the performance of solar cells also have been discussed. The results illustrated that the maximum power conversion efficiency of 2.01% was achieved in the as-cast devices.

Abstract: A bottom-up technique using an aqueous solution method was adopted to fabricate a bio-mimicked antireflection (AR) coating for a CuInGaSe2 (CIGS) solar cell. On controlling the morphology of the solution-grown zinc oxide (ZnO) nanostructure the average reflectance of the CIGS solar cell employing the bio-mimicked AR coating decreased from 6.14% to 1.46%, and the efficiency of the solar cell increased from 10% to 11.5%. The mechanism by which the solar cell′s efficiency was enhanced is thought to be the effect of the gradual increase in the refractive index between air and the top electrode due to the insertion of the ZnO nanostructure.

Moreover, the size (height) of nanoripples on ZnO surface could be controlled in the range of several tens of nanometers. Among various ZnO films, surface structures with ∼70nm-high nanoripples resulted in the best photovoltaic performance of the organic solar cell consisting of a stack of indium tin oxide/ZnO/ regioregular poly (3-hexyl thiophene), phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester/Ag. The power conversion efficiency of inverted organic solar cells consisting of with 70nm-high ZnO nanoripples (∼3.2%) was higher than that of a relatively flat ZnO surface by a factor of ∼2. Existence of nanoripples on ZnO results in a higher contact area between ZnO and active layer, leading to an enhanced photovoltaic performance.

Abstract: Small molecule organic solar cell with an optimized hybrid planar-mixed molecular heterojunction (PM-HJ) structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/ poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS) doped with 4wt% sorbitol/ pentacene (2nm)/ copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) (10nm)/ CuPc: C60 mixed (20nm)/ fullerene (C60) (20nm)/ bathocuproine (BCP) (10nm)/Al was fabricated. PEDOT: PSS layer doped with 4wt% sorbitol and pentacene layer were used as interlayers between the ITO anode and CuPc layer to help the hole transport. And then the short-circuit current (Jsc) of solar cell was enhanced by inserting both the PEDOT: PSS (4wt% sorbitol) and the pentacene, resulting in a 400% enhancement in power conversion efficiency (PCE). The maximum PCE of 3.9% was obtained under 1sun standard AM1.5G solar illumination of 100mW/cm2.

Abstract: We report on two push–pull type polymer semiconductors involving phthalimide derivatives as electron withdrawing units. The solubility and energy level of phthalimide could be easily controlled by introducing various functional groups in its nitrogen site. Additionally, the VOC value of polymer semiconductor materials with phthalimide as an electron withdrawing unit could be efficiently enhanced because of the low HOMO energy level of phthalimide. Nevertheless, there are just a few of studies regarding the use of phthalimide in OPVs. In this study, we synthesized two photovoltaic polymer materials based on phthalimide with high VOC value, PFTPT and PCTPT. Between the two polymers, PCTPT/PC71BM-based photovoltaic cell afforded the best PCE value of 1.4% (VOC=0.94V, JSC=4.41mA/cm2, FF=0.33) under 100mW/cm2 irradiation. In addition, a promising strategy for the development of high performance photovoltaic polymers with phthalimide derivatives as electron withdrawing units was investigated.

Abstract: A new donor–acceptor alternating copolymer as the donor material of the active layer in polymer solar cells has been synthesized. The alternating structure consisted of dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene (DTT) donor unit and 5,6-bis(tetradecyloxy)benzo-2,1,3-thiadiazole (BT) acceptor unit. Both units were confirmed by 1H NMR and elemental analysis. Since the BT unit has long alkyoxyl side chains, the polymer was soluble in common organic solvents. Optoelectronic properties of the copolymer (PDTTBT) were investigated and observed by UV–vis, photoluminescence (PL) spectra, and cyclic voltammogram (CV). UV–vis spectrum exhibited a broad absorption band in the range of 300–750nm and a low bandgap of 1.83eV. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of PDTTBT could be determined from the data of CV and UV–vis spectrum. Based on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PDTTBT:PCBM/Al device structure, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) under the illumination of AM 1.5 (100mW/cm2) was 0.113%. It was found that PCE of 0.301% could be acquired under the annealing condition at 150°C for 30min. In addition, solar cells fabricated with the 1,8-octanedithiol (OT) additive in the mixture solvent or adding TiOx optical spacer show efficiencies significantly improved over 15%.

Abstract: Cracks in crystalline silicon solar cells influence the photovoltaic (PV) module power output in accelerated aging tests. A detailed insight into the formation of cracks offers the potential to optimize the PV module design in order to reduce the risk of power degradation in its lifetime. In this paper we present a statistical analysis on the crack formation in 27 crystalline silicon PV modules caused by a standard mechanical load test according to IEC 61215 10.16. The criticality of cracks depends strongly on the crack orientation, therefore we analyze both the spatial distribution of cracks and its dependence on the orientation of the cracks in the tested PV modules. We find that 50% of the damaged cells are cracked parallel to the busbars, which is a crack orientation with high potential impact on the power output of the PV module. A simplified numerical analysis is used to give an explanation for the statistical data and we propose a strategy for the reduction of the crack criticality.

Abstract: New symmetrical low band-gap small molecule materials, SQ-bis[HP-HT2-TPA] and SQ-bis[HP-HT2-BT] incorporating as novel derivative of squaraine-pyrrole framework and π-extended thiophene with triphenyamine (TPA) and benzothiophene (BT) end group, have been synthesized and characterized. The effects of TPA moiety were investigated. Compared to SQ-bis[HP-HT2-BT], SQ-bis[HP-HT2-TPA] exhibited three times improved transporting property of hole carrier and four times enhanced absorptivity by more efficient intermolecular π−π interaction for high-efficiency bulk heterojunction (BHJ) device, suggesting that TPA contributes to a better hole mobility. The bulk-heterojunction photovoltaic devices fabricated with SQ-bis[HP-HT2-TPA]/C71-PCBM BHJ film had an average power-conversion efficiency of 1.83%(±0.12) under 100mW/cm2, with a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 9.32mA/cm2, fill factor (FF) of 0.30, and open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.65V, which has ∼42% higher efficiency compared to SQ-bis[HP-HT2-BT]/C71-PCBM BHJ films.

Abstract: A facile method for the synthesis of Co3S4 core–shell hexagonal nanosheets (NSs) from Co(NO3)2 and thioacetamide under alkaline conditions in the presence of poly(vinylpyrrolidone) has been demonstrated. At the molar ratios of thioacetamide/Co2+ of 0.26, 0.52, and 2.6, we prepared hollow-, semi-hollow, and non-hollow Co3S4 core–shell hexagonal NSs. We have found that Ostwald ripening occurring at the core/shell interface accounts for the formation of the hollow Co3S4 core–shell NSs, each consisting of a core of 80±30nm in diameter and a shell of 25±5nm in thickness. Three CdZnSSe nanostructure-sensitized solar cells incorporating Co3S4 NSs provide an average power conversion efficiency of 3.7±0.1%, showing high electrocatalytic activity of the Co3S4 NSs toward polysulfide electrolyte.

Safrole oxide induces human umbilical vein endothelial cell transdifferentiation to 5-hydroxytryptaminergic neuron-like cells through tropomyosin receptor kinase A/cyclooxygenase 2/nuclear factor-kappa B/interleukin 8 signaling,

Abstract: The phenomenon of endothelial–neural transdifferentiation has been observed for a long time, but the mechanism is not clear. We previously found that safrole oxide induced human umbilical vein endothelial cell transdifferentiation into neuron-like cells. In this study, we first validated that these cells induced by safrole oxide were functional 5-hydroxytryptaminergic neuron-like cells. Then, we performed microarray analysis of safrole oxide-treated and -untreated human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Safrole oxide elevated the levels of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which was accompanied by nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) nuclear translocation during the transdifferentiation. Blockade of tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) by an inhibitor or short hairpin RNA inhibited the levels of COX-2/IL-8 and the nuclear translocation of NF-κB but did not suppress the increased ROS level. As a result, cells underwent apoptosis. Therefore, via TrkA, safrole oxide may induce endothelial cell transdifferentiation into functional neuron-like cells. During this process, the increased levels of COX-2/IL-8 and the subsequent elevation of ROS production induced NF-κB nuclear translocation and IL-8 secretion. With the activity of TrkA inhibited, the inactive NF-κB regulated the ROS level in a negative feedback manner. Finally, the transdifferentiation pathway was blocked and cells became apoptotic. The TrkA/COX-2/IL-8 signal pathway may have an important role in endothelial–neural transdifferentiation, and safrole oxide may trigger this process by activating TrkA.

Abstract: The mechanical flexibility of transparent poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) films printed onto a flexible PET substrate using a gravure printing method was investigated using a lab-made bending test system. Gravure-printed PEDOT:PSS electrodes with a sheet resistance of 359Ω/square and a transparency of 88.92% showed outstanding flexibility in several types of flexibility tests, including outer/inner bending, twisting and stretching. Notably, the PEDOT:PSS electrode had a constant resistance change (ΔR/R0) within an outer and inner bending radius of 10mm. In addition the stretched PEDOT:PSS electrode showed a fairly constant resistance change (ΔR/R0) up to 4%, which is more stable than the resistance change of conventional amorphous ITO electrode. The twisting test revealed that the resistance of the PEDOT:PSS electrode began to increase at an angle of 36° due to delamination of the film from the PET substrate. Despite the high sheet resistance of the PEDOT:PSS electrode the flexible organic solar cells fabricated on the PEDOT:PSS electrode showed a power conversion efficiency of ∼2% (FF: 44.9%, Vo: 0.495V and Jsc: 9.1mA/cm2), indicating the possibility of using gravure printed PEDOT:PSS as a flexible and transparent electrode for printing-based flexible organic solar cells.

Abstract: A study on the optimisation of front contacts of n-type multicrystalline silicon solar cells is presented. In this study the same cell processing was applied to two types of wafers: electronic grade (EG-Si) and metallurgic grade (MG-Si) silicon. The contact firing temperature was optimised, by measuring the contact resistivity of the front and back contacts for different firing temperatures. The front contacts were improved by deposing silver using an electrochemical process. The solar cells were characterised before and after the silver deposition. For all cells processed the line resistance was reduced by over 90% after the silver deposition. After the contact improvement, EG-Si cells showed an absolute efficiency improvement of 2.6%, but MG-Si cells suffered a reduction on the cell efficiency, an effect related to parasitic shunting existent in these cells.

Abstract: Heat storage experiment by natural convection in rectangular enclosures heated from bottom has been conducted with fluid slurry composed of microencapsulated phase change material (PCM). The microencapsulated PCM is prepared by in-situ polymerization method, where the core materials are composed of several kinds of n-paraffin waxes (mainly nonadecane) and the membrane is a type of melamine resin. Its slurry mixed with water is used in this study, and shows a peak value in the specific heat capacity with latent heat at the temperature of about T=31°C. The influences of the phase change material on heat storage and the heat transfer process, as well as effects of PCM mass concentration Cm on the microcapsule slurry, temperature of heat storage TH and a horizontal enclosure height H are also investigated. Transient heat transfer coefficient α, heat storage capacity Q and completion time of heat storage tc are discussed.

Abstract: Ternary blends were recently suggested as a sound approach to increase the short circuit current density of organic solar cells by sensitizing the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) with a further absorber, i.e., a low band gap polymer. Poly[2,6-(4,4-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b´]dithiophene)-alt-4,7(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PCPDTBT) is a suitable candidate as low band gap polymer for ternary blends with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-pheny-C61-butyric acid methyl ester ([60]PCBM) due to its ideal energy level and charge carrier properties. Phase diagrams are common in polymer science to visualize the mixing behavior of multicomponent systems as a function of temperature. In this study, we have used differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to extract phase diagrams for binary and ternary organic semiconductor blends, and built the corresponding solar cells to analyze correlations between the thermal and the electrical properties of such semiconductor blends.

Abstract: Efficient bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) (regioregular poly (3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT): (6, 6)-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)) solar cells were fabricated with molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) and copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) as buffer layers. The insertion of MoO3 layer was found to be critical to the device performance, effectively extracting holes to prevent the exciton quenching and reducing the interfacial resistance because of alignment of energy levels. The introduction of CuPc buffer layer was observed to be ameliorative for device performance, further enlarging the visible absorption spectra range of the devices. The effect of the MoO3 and CuPc layer thickness on device performance was studied. The optimized thickness was achieved when MoO3 layer was 12nm and CuPc layer was 6nm, resulting in optimized power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.76% under AM1.5G 100mW/cm2 illumination.

Abstract: Spray coating is a high throughput coating technique that is scalable and adaptable for organic photovoltaic manufacturing. To ensure uniform coating of the organic layers, the wettability, surface tension and boiling points of the solvents have to be optimized. Here, we used microscopic videos to understand the dynamics of the spray coating process. By optimizing the wettability and drying time of the PEDOT:PSS suspension on a hydrophobic surface, we attained a spray coated transparent anode without compromising on device performance. We further applied this vacuum-free process to a near infrared absorber to achieve a transparent organic solar cell with close to 60% transparency.

Abstract: Solar cells based on CdTe have reached a maximum efficiency of 16.5%, which has remained almost unchanged for a long time. Physical reasons for this fact have been given by different authors, but not much advance has been achieved in this regard for about 15 years. Therefore, new concepts have to be developed for a further increase of the efficiency of this kind of solar cells. One of the possibilities is to use a graded band-gap absorbing semiconductor causing an associated quasi-electric field. The effects of this quasi-electric field upon the minority carrier drift-diffusion length and the back surface recombination velocity may induce a larger carrier collection at the junction with the corresponding increase of the illumination current density. Therefore, based on these concepts, the author has recently proposed structures based on CdZnTe with a variable Zn content profile. In this work, an analytical model is developed for taking into account the quasi-electric field, the carrier back surface recombination velocity and the “graded” absorption in a solar cell using a variable band-gap semiconductor in the base. The conditions to be satisfied in order to have a real improvement of the illumination current density are discussed, in particular for a graded CdZnTe solar cell.

Abstract: In this paper, a numerical study is made of simple bi-periodic binary diffraction gratings for solar cell applications. The gratings consist of hexagonal arrays of elliptical towers and wells etched directly into the solar cell substrate. The gratings are applied to two distinct solar cell technologies: a quantum dot intermediate band solar cell (QD-IBSC) and a crystalline silicon solar cell (SSC). In each case, the expected photocurrent increase due to the presence of the grating is calculated assuming AM1.5D illumination. For each technology, the grating period, well/tower depth and well/tower radii are optimised to maximise the photocurrent. The optimum parameters are presented. Results are presented for QD-IBSCs with a range of quantum dot layers and for SSCs with a range of thicknesses. For the QD-IBSC, it is found that the optimised grating leads to an absorption enhancement above that calculated for an ideally Lambertian scatterer for cells with less than 70 quantum dot layers. In a QD-IBSC with 50 quantum dot layers equipped with the optimum grating, the weak intermediate band to conduction band transition absorbs roughly half the photons in the corresponding sub-range of the AM1.5D spectrum. For the SSC, it is found that the optimised grating leads to an absorption enhancement above that calculated for an ideally Lambertian scatterer for cells with thicknesses of 10μm or greater. A 20μm thick SSC equipped with the optimised grating leads to an absorption enhancement above that of a 200μm thick SSC equipped with a planar back reflector.

Abstract: Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) thin films were deposited by sputtering on glass substrates using stacked precursors. The stacked precursor thin films were prepared from Cu, SnS2 and ZnS targets at room temperature with different stacking orders of Cu/SnS2/ZnS/glass (A), ZnS/Cu/SnS2/glass (B) and SnS2/ZnS/Cu/glass (C). The stacked precursor thin films were sulfurized using a tubular rapid thermal annealing system in a mixed N2 (95%)+H2S (5%) atmosphere at 550°C for 10min. The effects of the stacking order in the precursor thin films on the structural, morphological, chemical, electrical and optical properties of the CZTS thin films were investigated. X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies showed that the annealed CZTS thin film using a stacking order A had a single kesterite crystal structure without secondary phases, whereas stacking orders B and C have a kesterite phase with secondary phases, such as Cu2−xS, SnS2 and SnS. The annealed CZTS thin film using stacking order A showed a very dense morphology without voids. On the other hand, the annealed CZTS thin films using stacking orders B and C contained the volcano shape voids (B) and Sn-based secondary phases (C) on the surface of the annealed thin films. The direct band gap energies of the CZTS thin films were approximately 1.45eV (A), 1.35eV (B) and 1.1eV (C).

Abstract: The mechanical integrity of a flexible ZnO-doped In2O3 (IZO)/Ag/IZO multilayer electrode deposited onto a flexible PET substrate using a continuous roll-to-roll (R2R) sputtering system was investigated by means of outer/inner bending, twisting and stretching tests. The R2R-sputtered flexible IZO (40nm)/Ag (12nm)/IZO (40nm) electrode with a sheet resistance of 5.37Ω/sq and an optical transmittance of 87.3% exhibited superior flexibility due to existence of a ductile Ag layer with high strain failure. It was noteworthy that the failure bending radius (5.5mm) of the inner bending test was lower than that (6.5mm) of the outer bending test due to complete separation of the cracks on the top IZO layer during the outer bending test. In addition, the twisting test showed that the resistance of the flexible IZO/Ag/IZO electrode began to increase at an angle of 26°. Furthermore the stretching test demonstrated that the strain failure of the IZO/Ag/IZO multilayer was 2.4%, which is higher than those of conventional flexible ITO electrodes. The mechanical integrity of the R2R-sputtered IZO/Ag/IZO multilayer indicated that hybridization of an oxide and Ag metal is a promising flexible electrode scheme for next generation flexible organic solar cells.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
Understanding the effect of cellular graft composition on allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT) outcomes is an area of great interest. The objective of the study was to analyze the correlation between transplant-related outcomes and administered CD34+, CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ cell doses in patients who had undergone peripheral blood, AHCT and received either in vivo T-cell depleted or T-cell replete allografts.
DESIGN AND SETTING
Comparison of consecutive patients who underwent peripheral blood AHCT in our institution between January 2003 and December 2009.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
The cohort of 149 patients was divided into two groups; non T-cell depleted (NTCD) (n=54) and T-cell depleted (TCD) (n=95). Study endpoints were overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), engraftment kinetics (neutrophil and platelet recovery), incidence of acute graft versus host disease (acute GVHD), chronic GVHD, non relapse mortality (NRM) and disease relapse.
RESULTS
Multivariate analysis showed that higher infused CD34+ cell dose improved OS (relative risk 0.58, 95% CI 0.34-0.98, P=.04), PFS (relative risk 0.59, 95% CI 0.35-1.00, P=.05) and NRM (relative risk 0.49, 95% CI 0.24-0.99, P=.048) in the TCD group. By multivariate analysis, there was no difference in engraftment, grades II-IV acute GVHD, extensive chronic GVHD and relapse in the two groups relative to the infused cell doses. There was a trend towards improved OS (relative risk 0.54, 95% CI 0.29-1.01, P=.05) with higher CD3+ cell dose in the TCD group.
CONCLUSION
Our findings suggest that higher CD34+ cell dose imparts survival benefit only to in vivo TCD peripheral blood AHCT recipients.

Abstract: The cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p27 plays an important role in controlling the eukaryotic cell cycle by regulating progression through G1 and entry into S phase. It is often elevated during differentiation and under conditions of cellular stress. In contrast, it is commonly downregulated in cancer cells and its levels are generally inversely correlated with favorable prognosis. The cellular levels of p27 are regulated, in part, by translational control mechanisms. The 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of the p27 mRNA harbors an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) which may facilitate synthesis of p27 in certain conditions. In this study, Far Upstream Element (FUSE) Binding Protein 1 (FBP1) was shown to directly bind to the human p27 5′-UTR and to promote IRES activity. An eight-nucleotide element downstream of a U-rich region within the 5′-UTR was important for FBP1 binding and p27 IRES activity. Overexpression of FBP1 enhanced endogenous p27 levels and stimulated translation initiation. In contrast, repression of FBP1 by siRNA transfection downregulated endogenous p27 protein levels. Using rabbit reticulocyte lysates, FBP1 stimulated p27 mRNA translation in vitro. The central domain of FBP1, containing four K homology motifs, was required for p27 5′-UTR RNA binding and the N terminal domain was important for translational activation. These findings indicate that FBP1 is a novel activator of p27 translation upon binding to the 5′-UTR.

Abstract: A complementary electrochromic device (ECD) based on a Prussian blue (PB) thin film and a heptyl viologen (HV(BF4)2) solution was assembled and studied. An equal-volume mixture of deionized water and isopropanol solution saturated with potassium ions was used as the electrolyte solution. The structure of a PB-HV(BF4)2-based ECD (PHECD) can be formulated as (ITO/PB/HV(BF4)2 in solution/ITO), and can be switched reversibly between blue and colorless states. The time required to darken the device depends on the applied potential and the charge capacity of the PB film. A blue film was formed evenly on the bare ITO surface by deposition of HV+ during darkening of the PHECD. Under application of 0V, it took a longer time to bleach the PHECD, due to re-oxidation and diffusion of the HV+ species back into the solution. A maximum transmittance window of 59% was obtained at 609nm with the operating potentials of 1.0V for darkening and 0V for bleaching. No pre-darkening or pre-bleaching of the electrodes was needed for assembly of the PHECD.

Abstract: We report the efficiency enhancement of polymer solar cells by incorporating a silver nanodisks' self-assembled layer, which was grown on the indium tin oxide (ITO) surface by the electrostatic interaction between the silver particles and modified ITO. Polymer solar cells with a structure of ITO (with silver nanodisks)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Clevious P VP AI 4083)/poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PC61BM)/LiF/Al exhibited an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.61±0.01V, short-circuit current density (JSC) of 9.24±0.09mA/cm2, a fill factor (FF) of 0.60±0.01, and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.46±0.07% under one sun of simulated air mass 1.5 global (AM1.5G) irradiation (100mW/cm2). The PCE was increased from 2.72±0.08% of the devices without silver nanodisks to 3.46±0.07%, mainly from the improved photocurrent density as a result of the excited localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) induced by the silver nanodisks.

Abstract: Fully organic solar cells (OSCs) based on polymers and fullerenes have attracted remarkable interest during the last decade and high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) beyond 8% have been realized. However, air stability of these cells remains poor. The conventional geometry of OSCs utilizes strongly oxidizing metal top contacts like Al or Ca. These metals are easily oxidized in air resulting in rapid decrease of PCE if cells are not perfectly encapsulated. Using a thin electron-selective hole-blocking bottom layer like TiO2 enables fabrication of solar cells in a so-called inverted geometry. In this geometry, noble metals like Ag or Au can be used as top contacts, which are less sensitive to ambient oxygen. Thus, air-stability of these inverted solar cells is significantly improved. In this study we investigate inverted polythiophene–methanofullerene solar cells. We find significant influence of the TiO2 layer thickness on light absorption and illumination stability of the solar cells, as well as the trap filling by photoinduced carriers. Even though TiO2 layers as thick as 500nm seem not to be detrimental for charge transport, light intensity losses limit the device performance. In turn, illumination stability is better for thicker TiO2 layers, which can serve as UV filters and protect the photoactive materials from degradation, when compared to thin TiO2 layers. Considering these different effects we state that a thickness of 100nm is the optimization of the TiO2 layer.

Abstract: Performance improvement of CdS nanorod arrays (NRA)/poly[2-methoxy-5-(2′-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene] (MEH-PPV) hybrid solar cells (HSCs) during the storage in ambient atmosphere has been demonstrated. An unusual photoluminescence (PL) enhancement was observed after MEH-PPV hybridizing with CdS NRA due to the abundance of S-vacancy-induced interface electron traps in CdS NRA, which was confirmed by temperature-dependent PL and charge transport analysis. By investigating on the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) and current–voltage characteristics, we demonstrated that the performance improvement of CdS NRA/MEH-PPV HSCs was contributed to the co-effects of interface electron trap–oxygen interaction and MEH-PPV–oxygen interaction, and the contribution ratio between these two interactions was varied over time in air.

Abstract: Despite the high solar cell efficiencies achieved with Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) absorbers, key parameters such as the carrier diffusion length and recombination lifetime are still under investigation. Here, we extract lifetime and diffusion length from temperature-dependent internal quantum efficiency (IQET) spectra of state of the art high efficiency CIGS solar cells. Two-parameter fits to the measured IQE curves using a model for double-graded gap solar cells show very good agreement in the studied temperature range T=146–293K, allowing the extraction of the electron recombination lifetime in the absorber and the collection probability in the front region of the cell. The obtained results agree with current literature values obtained by other characterization techniques. Furthermore, the temperature dependence of the recombination lifetime is explained by Shockley–Read–Hall recombination through a single bulk defect level with an activation energy of 200meV.

Abstract: The firing of screen-printed aluminum pastes is well established for the formation of a back surface field (BSF) and back contacts since many years in silicon solar cell fabrication. In this paper we investigate the electrical and microstructural properties of Al-alloyed contacts and their layer system, consisting of (i) the Al-doped p+-layer (2–14μm), the eutectic layer (1–15μm) and the layer of paste residuals (20–100μm). We show the influence of process parameters like the amount of printed paste, the alloying time and the peak temperature. Special emphasis is devoted to the properties of small alloyed screen-printed aluminum structures for the formation of local aluminum back contacts. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), electrochemical capacitance voltage (ECV) and conductivity measurements have been applied to characterize the samples. A simple model is qualitatively augmented to describe all effects occurring in a technical alloying process. For example, for increasing aluminum amounts, a saturation of the p+-layer thickness was found in the range of 10mg/cm2. For small screen-printed structures, the p+-layer is formed very homogenously and with a greater thickness compared to samples with a full-area Al metallization, which have been processed with similar alloying conditions. For the eutectic layer a high electrical conductivity of about 16×106S/m, only 2–3 times below that of pure aluminum has been determined. This is advantageous for the lateral conductivity especially for high paste amounts and small structures, which feature a relatively thick eutectic layer.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
In Algeria, the incidence of hematologic malignancies has been difficult to estimate for many years. Today, many hematological centers, including 14 university hospitals, have been developed in the entire north and have useful epidemiological data pertinent to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We studied the incidence of AML and its subtypes, age distribution, geographic distribution and trends in the rate of diagnosis over the last 5 years in Algeria. Secondary goals were to study trends of referral of AML cases from various regions to specific centers to assess the needs for health infrastructure and change of current practices.
DESIGN AND SETTING
Retrospective analysis of nationwide survey of all adult cases of AML (>16years) diagnosed between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2010.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
A survey form was distributed to all departments of hematology at the 15 participating centers.
RESULTS
The 1426 cases of AML diagnosed during the study period represented an annual incidence of 0.91/100 000 persons with a male to female (M/F) ratio of 1:16 and a median age of 45 years (range, 16-82years). Nationally, 20% of cases AML were diagnosed in the whole western region of the country, 47% in the central and 33% in the east. There was a trend of continuous increase in the rate with age and in the rate of diagnosis over the last 5 years. The most common subtype was M2, followed by M4 and M5.
CONCLUSION
An overall increase in the number of AML patients diagnosed nationwide over the last five years indicates a need for additional health care resources including curative and therapy-intense strategies, such as stem cell transplant facilities to optimize outcome. The relatively younger age of patients compared to the Western countries may be due to the demographic composition of our population.

Abstract: Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on the blends of poly(3-hexylthiophene) and fullerene derivative [6, 6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester have been fabricated with p-type chromium oxide film as hole-transporting layer. The distribution of temperature and heat flow in vacuum chamber was investigated by temperature probes and finite element method. It is found that the two factors have significant effect on the quality of the thermally evaporated Al cathode. The bigger momentum impinging Al particles facilitates the formation of C–Al or C–O–Al bonds at the interface between photoactive layer and Al electrode, which is propitious to the electron transfer, and the corresponding devices have higher electron mobility. The higher substrate temperature that induced by thermal radiation during Al evaporation can act as a function of thermal annealing treatment, which can eliminate some electron traps and lead to better ohmic contacts for electrons to transport at the interface. The combination of the bigger momentum impinging Al particles and the higher substrate temperature can induce the improvement of electron mobility and OSC performance.

Abstract: The selective emitter technology is the most effective method to improve the silicon solar cell performance. However, the strict alignment requirements between the Ag gridlines and the selective emitters should be addressed. In the present study, a novel front metal contact patterning scheme for crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells is developed. An intersected selective laser doping process is applied. The control experiment indicates that the best efficiency increases for ∼23.8% from ∼14.39% to ∼17.74% after receiving the laser doping process. Moreover, our laser doping process does not affect the open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current significantly and the emitter properties have not been degraded in terms of the emitter saturation current. The improved front metal contact results in the improved energy conversion efficiency. The developed process offers an elegant and reliable approach for the low-cost, high throughput industrial-scale production process.

Abstract: PH 500, a highly conducting poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), is a typical conducting polymer anode material used in organic electric devices. However, it has the disadvantages of low conductivity and poor surface roughness and requires a patterning method for the electrode through including the laser and plasma. In this paper, therefore, the conducting polymer ink for a transparent anode was formulated by adding dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and BYK-333 as the surfactant to enhance the conductivity and surface roughness. The conducting polymer anode was patterned through the application of a new patterning method that used polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) on a flexible substrate. In addition, a photoactive layer was formed by applying the new patterning method to the conventional brush painting method in which patterning had previously been impossible. The resulting material was compared with the device fabricated by the spin coating method. The fabricated flexible polymer solar cells (PSCs) exhibited short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) values of 4.2mA/cm2, 0.878V, 26.5% and 0.98%, respectively, which represented an efficiency improvement of 38% over those fabricated by the spin coating method. Meanwhile, the Jsc value was increased when the series resistance (Rs) decreased to 150Ωcm2.

Abstract: The mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways play significant roles in fundamental cellular processes, such as cell growth and differentiation. It has been shown that the specificity and efficacy of phosphorylation by MAP kinases rely upon distinct MAPK-docking domains (D-domains) found in a wide range of MAPK substrates including the ETS-transcription factor Elk-1. Importantly, the MAPK signaling cascade converges with the hypoxia-induced signaling pathway. The key regulator of hypoxia signaling is the heterodimeric transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). The α-subunit of HIF-1 (HIF-1α) is a substrate for the ERK2 MAP kinase. Unraveling the interplay of these main signaling systems is a prerequisite for understanding their role in tumor growth, a situation sustained by simultaneous mitogenic and hypoxic signals. In this work, we investigated the molecular cues that direct HIF-1α recognition and phosphorylation by ERK2. We showed that HIF-1α possesses a MAPK docking domain. Utilizing surface plasmon resonance (SPR) methodologies we demonstrated efficient binding between HIF-1α and ERK2, with a KD value in the low micromolar range. Although, the D-domain did not contribute to the above interaction significantly, it could act in trans by recruiting ERK2 and conferring responsiveness to poor ERK substrates. These results indicate that, via its conserved D-domain, HIF-1α could serve as a platform for ERK2 in the nucleus of the cell, thus potentially facilitating phosphorylation of other ERK2 substrates. The identification of an ERK2 recognition domain on HIF-1α opens new avenues for the analysis of HIF-1α-related ERK2 signaling and may allow designing of interfering compounds.

Abstract: We investigate a family of low band-gap polymers based on the common acceptor moiety 2,3-bis-(3-octyloxyphenyl)quinoxaline (Q) combined with thiophene (T) or the fused thiophene systems: benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b′]-dithiophene (BDT) or dithieno[3,2-b,2′,3′-d]-thiophene (DTT). The photochemical stability of the three polymers was examined and compared to P3HT. They were found to be substantially more robust than P3HT with a ranking of DTTQ>BDTQ>TQ1⪢P3HT, indicating that the fused ring systems of DTT and BDT impart a large degree of photochemical stability than thiophene. Furthermore devices with normal and inverted geometry were prepared and tested in air. The normal geometry devices showed the highest efficiencies compared to the inverted, in particular owing to a higher Voc, with TQ1 being the most efficient with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.5% (1000Wm−2, AM1.5G). For the inverted devices TQ1 and DTTQ showed the best PCEs of 0.9%.

Abstract: With the aid of optical modeling, the internal quantum efficiencies of organic Bulk Heterojunction (oBHJ) photovoltaic devices based on low band gap polymer of poly[(4,4′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole)-2,6-diyl-alt-(4,7-bis(2-thienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)-5,5′-diyl] (Si-PCPDTBT) blended with the acceptors of 1-(3-Methoxycarbonyl) propyl-1-phenyl [6,6] C61 (PCBM) and bis–adduct (bis–PCBM) are determined. The Si-PCPDTBT:bis–PCBM devices show considerably lower short circuit current density (Jsc) as compared to the Si-PCPDTBT:PCBM devices. The results show that 30% of this smaller Jsc is due to the lower optical absorption of bis–PCBM, while the major losses originate from the electrical losses. It is found that for the best Si-PCPDTBT:bis–PCBM devices with an active layer thickness in the range of 70–100nm, the inefficient charge generation within the bis–PCBM domains is the major contribution to the whole losses. Increasing the active layer thickness of Si-PCPDTBT:bis–PCBM device significantly enhances recombination losses in polymer/bis–fullerene matrix.

Abstract: The microstructures of molybdenum (Mo) thin films deposited at pressures from 3.3 to 10.3mTorr were characterized, and the relationships between these microstructures and the properties of the films (residual stress and electrical resistivity) were investigated. In the low deposition pressure regime (region I, below 7mTorr), the residual stress in the tensile direction increases with increasing pressure and the electrical resistivity increases gradually, but at high deposition pressures (region II, above 7mTorr) the residual stress is reduced and the resistivity increases more steeply. These variations of the properties of the Mo films in the low pressure regime are due to the variation in grain size; the carrier mobility decreases due to increased grain boundary (GB) scattering and the tensile stress increases due to increased atomic attraction across the GBs. In contrast, the porosity of the Mo films increases significantly in the high pressure regime, as demonstrated with variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE). Most of these pores are believed to be present along the grain boundaries of the Mo films, so their presence reduces the GB attraction and thus the tensile stress and enhances the carrier scattering. The high porosity of the Mo back contact was shown with secondary ion mass spectroscopy profiling to accelerate the Na diffusion from soda-lime glass into the Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) film.

Abstract: The predicted energy demand will reach 28TW by 2050 and 46TW by 2100. The deployment of solar cells as a source of electricity will have to expand to a scale of tens of peak terawatts in order to become a noticeable source of energy in the future. Of the current commercial and developmental solar cell technologies, the majority have natural resource limitations that prevent them from reaching a terawatt scale. These limitations include high energy input for crystalline-Si cells, limited material production for GaAs cells, and material scarcity for CdTe, CIGS, dye-sensitized, crystalline-Si, and thin-film Si cells. In this paper, we examine these limitations under the best scenarios for CdTe, CIGS, GaAs, dye-sensitized, and crystalline-Si solar cells. Without significant technological breakthroughs, these technologies combined would meet only a few percentage points (∼2%) of our energy demand in 2100.

Abstract: As part of our research on materials for concentrator photovoltaics (CPV), we are evaluating the optical properties and solar radiation durability of a number of polymeric materials with potential in CPV applications. For optical materials in imaging or non-imaging optical systems, detailed knowledge of the wavelength-dependent complex index of refraction is important for system design and performance, yet optical properties for many polymeric systems are not available in the literature. Here we report the index of refraction, optical absorbance, haze, and Urbach edge analysis results of various polymers of interest for CPV systems. These values were derived from ellipsometry and from using a VUV-VASE and transmission based absorbance spectroscopy on thick film samples. Fluoropolymers such as poly(tetrafluoroethylene-co-hexafluoropropylene) (Teflon® FEP), poly(tetrafluoroethylene-co-perfluoropropyl vinyl ether) (Teflon® PFA) and poly(ethylene-co-tetrafluoroethylene) (Teflon® ETFE Film) have desirable optical and physical properties for optical applications in CPV. Ethylene backbone polymers such as polyvinylbutyral (PVB) sheet (e.g., DuPontTM PV5200), and ethylene co-polymers such as poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) (EVA) (e.g., DuPontTM Elvax® PV1400), and poly(ethylene-co-methacrylic acid metal salt) ionomer sheet (e.g., DuPontTM PV5300) have applications as encapsulants in crystalline silicon (c-Si) and other flat plate PV applications. These materials are available with both a wide variety of polymer compositions and additive packages which affect their optical properties such as the UV absorption edge. Even materials such as DuPont’s Kapton® polyimide films, which are used behind the PV cell for their electrically insulating properties, have optical requirements, and we have also characterized these materials. The detailed optical properties of these materials will be useful in the design of the geometrical optics of a CPV system and optimization of the system’s optical throughput. This information will also provide insights into the system’s optical absorption. This is important, for example in the UV, where this absorption can impact the radiation durability of the materials.

Abstract: The influence of anode buffer layers of doped poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) on the performance of solar cells made from blends of poly(3-hexylthiophene) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-buytyric acid methyl ester has been investigated. Different concentration of ethylene glycol were added into the PEDOT:PSS solution to increase its conductivity. The surface roughness of the doped PEDOT:PSS film was changed, which was examined by atomic force microscopy. The best doped device with a power conversion efficiency of 4.39% as compared to 3.41% for the pristine device has been achieved. The enhanced PEDOT:PSS conductivity improved the short circuit current and fill factor of the doped device. The almost constant open circuit voltage indicated the well-established ohmic contact between the anode and active layer irrespective of the doping of the PEDOT:PSS. The changed surface roughness of the doped PEDOT:PSS film did not correlate with the morphology of the consequent active layer and the resultant device performance.

Abstract: In this work, we fabricate heterojunction silicon solar cells on p-type substrates whose rear surface configuration is based on dielectric passivation and laser fired contacts (LFC cells). This is an alternative to boron-doped amorphous silicon film, with which we also fabricate solar cells for direct comparison (HJ cells). As substrates, 3.5 and 0.8Ωcm p-type double-side polished FZ c-Si wafers are used. Regarding surface passivation for highly doped substrates, LFC configuration has some advantage due to the higher difficulty in creating an efficient amorphous back surface field. Additionally, those substrates are also more advantageous in terms of carrier injection when the rear surface is locally contacted. Thus LFC cells made on 0.8Ωcm substrates reach Voc values up to 680mV, in the same range as that of their HJ cell counterpart, with better FF demonstrating that LFC configuration is a feasible alternative for highly doped substrates. Focusing on the impact of the distance between rear contacts on cell performance, we found a trade-off between open circuit voltage Voc and fill factor FF. Finally electroluminescence characterization and the dependence of Voc on pitch, modeled by Fischer's equation, indicate that the depassivated area due to the laser processing of the contacts is bigger than the contacted area.

Abstract: For bioartificial liver application, cells should meet the following minimal requirements: ammonia elimination, drug metabolism and blood protein synthesis. Here we explore the suitability of HepaRG cells, a human cell line reported to differentiate into hepatocyte clusters and surrounding biliary epithelial-like cells at high density and after exposure to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The effect of carbamoyl-glutamate (CG), an activator of urea cycle enzyme carbamoylphosphate synthetase (CPS) was studied additionally. The effects of DMSO and/or CG were assessed in presence of 15NH4Cl on HepaRG cells in monolayer. We tested hepatocyte-specific functions at transcript and biochemical level, cell damage parameters and performed immunostainings. Ureagenesis, ammonia/galactose elimination and albumin, glutamine synthetase and CPS transcript levels were higher in −DMSO than +DMSO cultures, probably due to a higher cell content and/or cluster-neighbouring regions contributing to their functionality. DMSO treatment increased cytochrome P450 (CYP) transcript levels and CYP3A4 activity, but also cell damage and repressed hepatic functionality in cluster-neighbouring regions. The levels of ammonia elimination, apolipoprotein A-1 production, and transcription of CYP3A4, CYP2B6 and albumin reached those of primary hepatocytes in either the + or −DMSO cultures. Preconditioning with CG increased conversion of 15NH4Cl into 15N-urea 4-fold only in −DMSO cultures. Hence, HepaRG cells show high metabolic and synthetic functionality in the absence of DMSO, however, their drug metabolism is only high in the presence of DMSO. An unparalleled broad hepatic functionality, suitable for bioartificial liver application, can be accomplished by combining CG treated −DMSO cultures with +DMSO cultures.

Abstract: For cool roofs the combined effect of the three parameters that define heat gain and loss from a roof, namely solar albedo α, thermal emittance E, and sub-roof R-value, must be considered. An accurate contribution of night sky cooling, and hence humidity and total down-welling atmospheric radiation is needed. A systematic analysis of the contribution of a roof to average cooling load per day and to peak load reductions is presented for a temperate climate zone over 6 cooling months using an hour-by-hour analysis. Eighteen 3-parameter sets (α,E,R) demonstrate the over-riding importance of a high α, while sensitivity to R-value and E drops away as albedo rises. Up-front cost per unit reductions in peak demand or average energy use per day always rises strongly as R rises unless albedo is low. A moderate R∼1.63 is superior to high R unless a roof is dark, or winter heating demand is high. We indicate briefly why the roof typically does not present a dominant influence on average winter heating needs in most temperate zones, enhancing the benefits of cool roofs.

Abstract: Single-polished c-Si (100) wafers were textured in aqueous solutions with varying concentrations of tetra-methyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH). The resulting surface reflectance and morphology were examined as a function of etching time and temperature, TMAH concentration, and addition of isopropyl alcohol to the solution. The lowest reflectance, 9.8% at a 600-nm wavelength with 0.3% scattering over a 4″ wafer surface, was obtained after 40min of etching in a 2% TMAH solution at 80°C under 700rpm magnetic stirring. Upon adding isopropyl alcohol to the solution, the resulting pyramids were round-edged, and 12% sample reflectance was obtained. The results are interpreted in terms of micro-masking formation and temperature-dependent crystallographic selectivity. The compatibility of the treatment with photovoltaic applications was evaluated by studying the performance of heterojunction solar cells, which are particularly sensitive to surface quality. A degradation of the open circuit voltage was observed in devices fabricated on surfaces featuring crooked pyramid sides. Optimised process conditions led to smooth pyramid sides and no degradation of the open circuit voltage, which indicates no sign of increased surface recombination-centre concentration. The reduced reflectance resulted in a 16% increase of the short circuit current of the solar cell device.

Sirt1 deacetylates c-Myc and promotes c-Myc/Max association,

Abstract: The c-Myc oncoprotein plays critical roles in multiple biological processes by controlling cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and metabolism. Especially, c-Myc is frequently overexpressed in many human cancers and widely involved in tumorigenesis. However, how the post-translational modifications, especially acetylation of c-Myc, contribute to its activity in the leukemia cells remains largely unknown. Sirt1, a NAD-dependent class III histone deacetylase, has a paradoxical role in tumorigenesis by deacetylating several transcription factors, including p53, E2F1 and forkhead proteins. In this study, we show that Sirt1 interacts physically with the C-terminus of c-Myc and deacetylates c-Myc both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the deacetylation of c-Myc by Sirt1 promotes its association with Max, a partner essential for its activation, thereby facilitating c-Myc transactivation activity on hTERT promoter. Finally, inhibition of endogenous Sirt1 in K562 cells by either RNAi or its inhibitor NAM causes the overall decrease of c-Myc target genes expression, including hTERT, cyclinD2 and LDHA, which further suppress cell proliferation and arrest cell cycle at G1/S phase. Thus, our results demonstrate the positive effect of Sirt1 on c-Myc activity by efficiently enhancing c-Myc/Max association in human leukemia cell line K562, suggesting a potential role of Sirt1 in tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Polymeric photovoltaic (PV) solar cells have been fabricated using six solvents: chloroform (CHCl3), toluene (T), chlorobenzene (CB), orthodichlorobenzene (ODCB), 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (THN) and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB). The active layers were composed of poly(3-hexyl)thiophene (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). Special care has been taken to keep all experimental parameters constant (thickness of the active layers, donor/acceptor weight ratio, area of active surface and electrodes) in order to avoid artefacts and truly study the effect of solvents. Studies using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and optical absorption (UV–vis) showed the relationship between the photovoltaic performance and the evaporation rate of solvents. The use of solvents with high boiling point results in a higher degree of organization in the structure of P3HT. A direct comparison with devices processed with thermal treatment has also been performed. As often reported thermal annealing increases photo-conversion efficiency of devices created from common solvents, due to better separation of phase between the two materials of the blend. In the case of solvents with high boiling point such as THN and TCB, neither phase separation nor modification of P3HT crystallization induced by thermal annealing has been observed. However thermal treatment appears to enhance performance, ensuing the evaporation of remaining solvent in the active layers. An overview of the effect of solvent on the electrical properties of films containing pure P3HT and P3HT:PCBM blend reported in the literature has been completed for the discussion.

Abstract: A series of polystyrene graft palmitic acid (PA) copolymers as novel polymeric solid–solid phase change materials (PCMs) were synthesized. In solid–solid PCMs, polystyrene is the skeleton and PA is a functional side chain that stores and releases heat during its phase transition process. The heat storage of copolymers is due to phase transition between crystalline and amorphous states of the soft segment PA in copolymer and the hard segment polystyrene restricted the free movement of molecular chains of the soft segments even above the phase transition temperature. The copolymers always remain in the solid state during the phase transition processing and therefore they are described as form-stable PCM. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and polarization optical microscopy (POM) analyses were performed to investigate the chemical structures and crystalline morphology. Thermal energy storage properties, thermal reliability and thermal stability of the PCMs were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) methods. Thermal conductivities of the PCMs were also measured using thermal property analyzer. The analysis results indicated that the PA chains were successfully grafted onto the polystyrene backbone and the copolymers showed typical solid–solid phase transition properties. Moreover, thermal cycling test showed that the copolymers have good thermal reliability and chemical stability although they were subjected to 5000heating/cooling cycling. The synthesized polystyrene-graft-PA copolymers as novel solid–solid PCMs have considerable potential for such as underfloor heating, thermo-regulated fibers and heating and cooling of agricultural greenhouses. Especially, the polystyrene-graft-PA copolymer including 75% PA is the most attractive PCM due to its highest latent heat storage capacity in the synthesized copolymer PCMs.

Nuclear translocation of Sgt1 depends on its phosphorylation state,

Abstract: Recently we have shown that the Sgt1 (suppressor of G2 allele of Skp1) protein translocates to the nucleus due to heat shock and that the Ca2+-bound form of S100A6 is required for Sgt1 translocation (Prus and Filipek, 2010). In this work we studied the influence of Sgt1 phosphorylation on nuclear translocation. By means of two-dimensional (2D) electrophoresis we showed that in the protein extract of heat-shocked human epidermoid carcinoma (HEp-2) cells a higher level of a basic, most probably non-phosphorylated, form of Sgt1 can be detected. Also, we found a more efficient translocation of Sgt1 induced by heat shock when casein kinase II inhibitor was added to the cells. To confirm the role of Sgt1 phosphorylation/dephosphorylation in its nuclear translocation we transfected cells with non-phosphorylable Sgt1 mutants (S249A, S299A, S249/299A) or a phosphorylation mimic S299D mutant. We found that the levels of S299A and S249/299A mutants were higher than the level of wild type Sgt1 in the nuclear fraction after heat shock. Accordingly, we found that the 139–333 fragment of Sgt1 harboring the mutated residues, but not the 1–138 fragment, translocated to the nucleus upon heat shock. Moreover, we show that S100A6 is required for translocation of the non-phosphorylable Sgt1 mutants and that upon heat shock S100A6 translocates to the nucleus together with Sgt1. In addition, we found that non-phosphorylable Sgt1 mutant interacts with S100A6 more efficiently and at the same time exhibits lower affinity for Hsp90 (heat shock protein 90) than wild type Sgt1. Altogether, our results suggest that S100A6-Ca2+-mediated Sgt1 dephosphorylation promotes its nuclear translocation, most likely due to disruption of the Sgt1-Hsp90 complex.

Abstract: High reflectivity is essential when a metal is used as back contact and reflector in thin-film silicon solar cells. We show that thermal annealing at 150°C improves the reflectivity of silver films deposited by sputtering at room temperature on nanotextured substrates. The annealing provokes two interlinked effects: rearrangement of the silver layer with a modification of its morphology and an increase of up to 42% in the grain size of the polycrystalline film for the preferential orientation as measured by X-ray diffraction. The main consequence of these two mechanisms is a large increase in the reflectivity of silver when measured in air. This reflectivity increase is also noticeable in devices: amorphous silicon thin-film solar cells grown on annealed silver films yield higher internal and external quantum efficiencies compared to cells grown on as-deposited silver. The morphology modification smoothes down the substrate, which is revealed by a clear increase of the open-circuit voltage and fill factor of the cells grown on top. An amorphous silicon cell with a 200nm nominally thick i-layer fabricated on a flexible plastic substrate yielded an initial efficiency close to 10% with 15.9mA/cm2 of short-circuit current using highly reflective annealed textured silver. We also propose, for industrial purpose, the sputtering of thin silver layer (120nm) under moderate substrate temperature (∼150°C) to increase the layer reflectivity, which avoids lengthening of the back reflector fabrication.

In addition larger sized quantum dots show a similar improvement after integration in respective solar cells. Power conversion efficiency values exceeding 3% are observed. A first result on the shelf lifetime of such a device is highlighted.

Abstract: Human DNA mismatch repair (MMR) is involved in the removal of DNA base mismatches that arise either during DNA replication or are caused by DNA damage. In this study, we show that the activation of the MMR component hMLH1 in response to doxorubicin (DOX) treatment requires the presence of BRCA1 and that this phenomenon is mediated by an ATM/ATR dependent phosphorylation of the hMLH1 Ser-406 residue. BRCA1 is an oncosuppressor protein with a central role in the DNA damage response and it is a critical component of the ATM/ATR mediated checkpoint signaling. Starting from a previous finding in which we demonstrated that hMLH1 is able to bind to BRCA1, in this study we asked whether BRCA1 might be the bridge for ATM/ATR dependent phosphorylation of the hMLH1 molecular partner. We found that: (i) the negative modulation of BRCA1 expression is able to produce a remarkable reversal of hMLH1 stabilization, (ii) BRCA1 is required for post-translational modification produced by DOX treatment on hMLH1 which is, in turn, attributed to the ATM/ATR activity, (iii) the serine 406 phosphorylatable residue is critical for hMLH1 activation by ATM/ATR via BRCA1. Taken together, our data lend support to the hypothesis suggesting an important role of this oncosuppressor as a scaffold or bridging protein in DNA-damage response signaling via downstream phosphorylation of the ATM/ATR substrate hMLH1.

Abstract: A novel Thickness Sensitive Spectrally Selective (TSSS PU B: as=0.90, eT=0.20) paint coating on aluminium substrate was prepared from commercially available polyurethane binder (Binder B) (HELIOS TBLUS, SI) and black pigment (spinel (Mn–Fe)), in combination with trisilanol polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS), which served as pigment dispersant. Polyurethane resin binder B was selected because of its higher thermal stability (determined from thermogravimetric measurements (TG)) than polyurethane resin binder A, which has previously been used for making Thickness Insensitive Spectrally Selective (TISS PU A) coatings (as=0.90, eT=0.38) deposited on copper absorbers (Kunič, 2009 [36]). Thermal degradation of the TSSS PU B and TISS PU A coatings, both deposited on aluminium substrates, was studied by following, as close as possible, the methodology worked out within TASK 10 of the IEA's Solar and Heating Programme. Thermal load tests were performed in the temperature range from 170 to 200°C at various time intervals (1, 6, 10, 15, 21 days). Degradation of the coatings was assessed using a variety of degradation indicators: changes of solar absorptance and thermal emittance determined from the hemispherical IR and VIS/NIR spectra, intensity changes of selected vibrational modes attributed to the polymeric backbone and ester and urethane linkages and combined with peel-off tests used as adhesion and cohesion indicators. The results revealed that degradation of the polyurethane resin binder was attributable to the breaking of the urethane linkages, also shown from the AFM and XPS spectra measurements. For the TISS PU A coating, the life expectancy was estimated to be 22.77 years (activation energy (Ea)=163.2kJ/mol, Teff=113.4°C) while for the TSSS PU B coatings, it was at least 25.96 years (activation energy (Ea)=96kJ/mol, Teff=102°C).

Abstract: Connexins (Cx) are key regulators of cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Cx trafficking and endocytosis need interactions with a large number of signaling and scaffolding proteins. We demonstrate herein that Cx43-GFP gap junction plaque endocytosis was blocked in cells transfected by the dominant-negative form of dynamin2 (Dyn2K44A) and by dynasore, an inhibitor of dynamin GTPase activity, which reduced the association between dynamin2 and Cx43. Our data also reveal that recruitment of the GTPase at the plasma membrane and its activation by c-Src are key events for Cx43 internalization. In addition they show that dynamin2 participated in internalization and degradation of the gap junction plaque but also in recycling of Cx43 to the plasma membrane through respectively Rab5/Rab7 and Rab11 pathways. These results demonstrate for the first time that dynamin2 is a new Cx partner and report an innovating mechanistic model by which dynamin2 may control Cx43 gap junction plaque invagination, endocytosis, recycling and degradation. These processes are magnified in response to carcinogen exposure underlining their potential importance during carcinogenesis.

Abstract: Sodium acetate trihydrate (SAT), which has high energy storage density and high thermal conductivity, is an important phase change material (PCM) for thermal storage. But it suffers from serious supercooling and phase segregation during the solidification process, and therefore its application requires the use of effective nucleating and thickening agents. In this study, AlN nanoparticles were proposed as the nucleating agent and carboxyl methyl cellulose (CMC) was selected as the thickener for SAT. The phase change temperature and the latent heat of SAT with the addition of AlN nanoparticles and CMC were measured. The results show that AlN nanoparticles can prevent supercooling of SAT significantly. For SAT with 5wt% AlN nanoparticles and 4wt% CMC, no supercooling phenomenon occurs, and its phase change temperature and latent heat are 52.5°C and 227.54kJ/kg, respectively. AlN nanoparticles and CMC additives also can improve the dehydration temperature according to the results of TG–DTA. Size distribution of AlN nanoparticles was measured by means of light scattering method. The size range is 95–300nm, which is confirmed by environmental scanning electron microscope. The radial needle-like crystals growth process was also observed and recorded by an optical microscope.

Abstract: A new variant of the anodic bonding technique (ALTSAB: Activated Liquid Tin Solder Anodic Bonding) is described, which offers a number of advantages for direct glass to metal sealing over conventional methods. It employs a tin solder alloy containing an activating metal which is anodically bonded to alkali rich glass substrates in the liquid state. Two different test specimens were fabricated and characterized under vacuum at a pressure of 5×10−4mbar and a bonding temperature of 300°C and compared with standard Al/glass anodic bonds. The ability to fabricate dual interface bonds of good quality and high shear strength >16MPa by the ALTSAB method was demonstrated. With the sealant metal in the liquid state, this methodology promises superior surface adaptation and therefore joint performance when compared with the standard anodic bonding. More importantly, there is no need for premetallization or surface pretreatment of the glass substrates, and unlike in conventional anodic bonding, there is no need for mechanically loading the joining assembly. Wetting of the float glass substrates by the activated solder alloy SnAl0.6 after successful anodic bonding was confirmed by optical microscopy. The enrichment of the activating element Al at the bonding interface was confirmed by SEM and EDS element mapping. The methodology presented here shows great promise for various large-area sealing applications, particularly vacuum glazing, thin film and organic PV and OLED technology.

Abstract: We present results of numerical simulation of optimized porous silicon (PS) multilayers used as antireflection coatings. For the simulations we introduce a figure of merit, which has into account the transmittance of PS multilayers, the solar cell internal spectral response and the solar spectrum. Using a realistic range of porosities in the simulations (from 40% to 90%) we found an optimal three layers configuration, which transfers to the cell 95.7% of the whole usable power. This value represents the 99.8% of the maximum attainable using the complete porosity range (from 0% to 100%). We fabricate the optimal PS three layers, achieving power transference to the substrate of 95.2%. In addition, taking advantage of the PS fabrication characteristics, we transferred a PS multilayer with specific optical response onto a crystalline silicon solar cell. This allows obtaining a tunable spectral response of the solar cell demonstrating the feasibility of transfer the porous antireflection coating onto any optical device.

Abstract: Thermochromic VO2 thin films were deposited on various substrates, namely quartz, Si, and Al, using RF reactive magnetron sputtering deposition. IR thermometry measurements reveal that the emissivity properties of the system VO2/substrate strongly depend on the IR optical properties of the substrate. VO2 films deposited on a highly IR reflective substrate such as Al, present an emissivity dependence on temperature that is opposite to that of VO2 deposited on an IR transparent substrate, like quartz and Si. XPS and Raman measurements show that VO2 undergoes a crystalline structure transition from monoclinic to tetragonal when deposited on Al, quartz, and Si. They also confirm that the transition is accompanied by a change from an insulator or semiconductor state to a metallic state. The emissivity performance of VO2/Al as compared to that of VO2/quartz and VO2/Si is attributed to the higher IR reflective properties of Al in comparison to quartz and Si. The increase of emissivity with temperature makes the VO2/Al system of strong interest as a passive smart radiator device for thermal control of spacecraft.

Abstract: The use of highly reflective “cool” roofing materials can decrease demand for air conditioning, mitigate the urban heat island effect, and potentially slow global warming. However, initially high roof solar reflectance can be degraded by natural soiling and weathering processes. We evaluated solar reflectance losses after three years of natural exposure reported in two separate databases: the Rated Products Directory of the US Cool Roof Rating Council (CRRC) and information reported by manufacturers to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s ENERGY STAR® rating program. Many product ratings were culled because they were duplicative (within a database) or not measured. A second, site-resolved version of the CRRC dataset was created by transcribing from paper records the site-specific measurements of aged solar reflectance in Florida, Arizona and Ohio. Products with high initial solar reflectance tended to lose reflectance, while those with very low initial solar reflectance tended to become more reflective as they aged. Within the site-resolved CRRC database, absolute solar reflectance losses for samples of medium-to-high initial solar reflectance were 2–3 times greater in Florida (hot and humid) than in Arizona (hot and dry); losses in Ohio (temperate but polluted) were intermediate. Disaggregating results by product type—factory-applied coating, field-applied coating, metal, modified bitumen, shingle, single-ply membrane and tile—revealed that absolute solar reflectance losses were largest for field-applied coating, modified bitumen and single-ply membrane products, and smallest for factory-applied coating and metal products. The 2008 Title 24 provisional aged solar reflectance formula overpredicts the measured aged solar reflectance of 0–30% of each product type in the culled public CRRC database. The rate of overprediction was greatest for field-applied coating and single-ply membrane products and least for factory-applied coating, shingle, and metal products. New product-specific formulas of the form ρa′=0.20+β(ρi−0.20) can be used to estimate provisional aged solar reflectance ρa′ from initial solar reflectance ρi pending measurement of aged solar reflectance. The appropriate value of soiling resistance β varies by product type and is selected to attain some desired overprediction rate for the formula. The correlations for shingle products presented in this paper should not be used to predict aged solar reflectance or estimate provisional aged solar reflectance because the data set is too small and too limited in range of initial solar reflectance.

Abstract: Application of appropriate dc bias to the substrate has been identified as one of the efficient parameters, beyond the mostly used classical ones, in controlling the growth of nanocrystalline silicon (nC-Si:H) network by plasma CVD of SiH4. The present communication demonstrates that applying negative dc substrate bias at the moderate level the overall nanocrystallinity in the material be enhanced significantly. The nC-Si:H film of ∼70% crystalline volume fraction along with a high σD∼3.1×10–4Scm–1 and Eσ∼191meV has been obtained at a low substrate temperature of 200°C and with a growth rate of ∼8nm/min from only 1sccm of the feed gas SiH4, using −75V dc substrate bias and He as the diluent to the plasma. Besides the extent of crystallinity, the average grain size (ρ) has been demonstrated to be controllable within nano-dimensions, 1< ρ<10nm, by tuning negative dc substrate bias during plasma processing. The present report comprehensively elaborates the effect of applied negative dc substrate bias on the growth morphology of the nC-Si:H thin films from He-diluted SiH4 plasma, in view of controlling nanocrystallization at low substrate temperature by RF-PCVD, while controlled transmission of energy to the growing surface obtained from metastable and ionic helium (He* and He+) bombardment has been deemed instrumental.

Abstract: The effect of laser and chemical edge junction isolation on electrical performance of industrially manufactured laser doped selective emitter solar cells with light induced plated n-type contacts is investigated in this work. Directly after the formation of the aluminium back surface field, photoluminescence images indicates that laser edge junction isolation causes substantial damage around the perimeter of the cell, extending several millimeters from the laser edge isolation groove. On finished devices, regions of high series resistance are evident around the perimeter, caused by parasitic plating nucleating in the damaged laser grooved region which induce shunting and inhibits further plating taking place in the surrounding regions. The use of chemical edge junction isolation eliminates both of these issues and can result in efficiency gains of more than 2% absolute compared to that fabricated using laser edge isolation, suggesting a far superior method of edge junction isolation for the industrial manufacture of laser doped selective emitter solar cells with light induced plated contacts.

Abstract: A tandem solar cell is constructed by series connection of a semi-transparent dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) as a top cell and a Cu(In, Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cell as a bottom cell, where the isolated DSSC and CIGS cells show the conversion efficiency of 8.27% and 11.71%, respectively. The DSSC/CIGS tandem cell exhibits the improved conversion efficiency of 12.35% with photocurrent density of 14.1mA/cm2, open-circuit voltage of 1.435V and fill factor of 0.61. External quantum efficiency (EQE) of the tandem cell is investigated under DC and AC modes. EQE of the isolated DSSC and CIGS cell can be measured by either DC mode or AC mode, whereas EQE for the tandem cell is detected only under AC mode with bias light. Bias light intensity is found to play the crucial role in determining the precise EQE of the tandem cell. At the given chopping frequency as low as 10Hz, the measured EQE at bias light corresponding to 1sun intensity is consistent with the simulated EQE data.

Abstract: We report the solution processed graphene oxide (GO), NiOx and GO/NiOx bi-layer used as an anode interfacial layer in organic bulk-heterojunction solar cells. The bulk-heterojunction solar cells using GO, NiOx and GO/NiOx bi-layer exhibited the conversion efficiency of 2.33%, 3.10% and 3.48%, respectively. The cell efficiency is correlated with the matching of energy levels between ITO, hole transport layer and P3HT and thus a well-matched stack layer of ITO/GO/NiOx/P3HT:PCBM/LiF/Al shows the best cell efficiency of 3.48% with the JSC of 8.71mA/cm2, VOC of 0.602V and FF of 66.44%.

Abstract: A model for the performance of generic crystalline silicon photovoltaic (PV) modules is proposed. The model represents the output power of the module as a function of module temperature and in-plane irradiance, with a number of coefficients to be determined by fitting to measured performance data from indoor or outdoor measurements. The model has been validated using data from 3 different modules characterized through extensive measurements in outdoor conditions over several seasons. The model was then applied to indoor measurement data for 18 different PV modules to investigate the variability in modeled output from different module types. It was found that for a Central European climate the modeled output of the 18 modules varies with a standard deviation (SD) of 1.22%, but that the between-module variation is higher at low irradiance (SD of 3.8%). The variability between modules of different types is thus smaller than the uncertainty normally found in the total solar irradiation per year for a given site. We conclude that the model can therefore be used for generalized estimates of PV performance with only a relatively small impact on the overall uncertainty of such estimates resulting from different module types.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE
The epidemiological characteristics of retinoblastoma have been extensively studied in developed countries, however epidemiological data is scarce in the Middle East. We present a detailed epidemiological analysis of retinoblastoma in Jordan in an attempt to aid national and regional strategies for improved cancer surveillance and control.
DESIGN AND SETTING
Retrospective review of retinoblastoma cases presenting to the sole and exclusive ocular oncology referral center in Jordan.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Forty children (59 eyes) presenting with clinically and/or histologically confirmed retinoblastomas were treated at King Hussein Cancer Center (Amman, Jordan) between January 2006 and December 2010. This case series included 28 boys and 12 girls. Data relating to age at diagnosis, laterality, gender, treatment modality and survival were recorded.
RESULTS
The mean age-adjusted incidence of retinoblastoma in Jordan was 9.32 cases per million children per year for children aged 0-5 years. The male: female ratio was 2.3:1. Bilateral cases were encountered in 19 patients (47.5%) while 21 patients (52.5%) harbored unilateral retinoblastoma. At the time of follow-up, 38 patients (95%) were alive. Overall, 40 eyes (67.8%) were successfully preserved without the need for enucleation.
CONCLUSIONS
The national epidemiological data gathered in this study indicates that the incidence of retinoblastoma in Jordan is similar to that reported in various countries of the world. Jordanian boys, however, are at significantly higher risk for developing retinoblastoma than age-matched girls. Furthermore, Jordanian patients are more likely to harbor bilateral retinoblastoma.

Abstract: To catch up with the need for utilizing sunlight as an alternative energy source, photovoltaic technology has developed considerably fast in the last thirty-plus years. This article examines this technology's development from the perspective of patent growth analysis. Patent data are analyzed to find the photovoltaic technology growth trajectory. Mainly affected by environmental factors such as the price of crude oil, we observe two long-term waves of development trajectories. The current wave is found to be in the later growth stage of its life-cycle. After examining the correlation between technology development and crude oil price, a significant correlation is found between crude oil price's growth rate and photovoltaic patents' growth rate. As far as the market is concerned, it lags 10 years behind photovoltaic technology development. With the assistance of keyword co-occurrence analysis, one can classify photovoltaic patents into five groups, with each carrying a characteristic of competing photovoltaic technologies: Emerging PV, CdTe, CIS/CIGS, Group III–V, and Silicon technologies. This research observes the patent growth trajectories for each technology. Among these competing technologies, Emerging PV, Group III–V, and Silicon are still growing strong, while CdTe and CIS/CIGS are in the mature stage. This result hints at a paradigm shift for photovoltaic technology development. Sustainability is added to the technical regime in addition to efficiency, cost, and reliability. A policy other than the existing mechanism such as a feed-in tariff is suggested to stabilize photovoltaic technology development through the means of removing oil price fluctuations. Finally, several strategic issues are discussed from the technology development community's point of view.

A calcium-insensitive attenuated nitrosative stress response contributes significantly in the radioresistance of Sf9 insect cells,

Abstract: Lepidopteran insects/insect cells display 50–100 times higher radioresistance than humans, and are evolutionarily closest to mammals amongst all radioresistant organisms known. Compared to mammalian cells, Lepidopteran cells (TN-368, Sf9) display more efficient antioxidant system and DNA repair and suffer considerably less radiation-induced DNA/cytogenetic damage and apoptosis. Recent studies indicate that a considerably lower radiation-induced oxidative stress may significantly reduce macromolecular damage in Lepidopteran cells. Since nitrosative stress contributes in radiation-induced cellular damage, we investigated its nature in the γ-irradiated Sf9 cells (derived from Spodoptera frugiperda; order Lepidoptera; family Noctuidae) and compared with BMG-1 human cell line having significant NOS expression. Radiation induced considerably less ROS/RNS in Sf9 cells, which remained unchanged on treatment with NOS inhibitor l-NMMA. Surprisingly, growth of Sf9 cultures or irradiation could not induce NO or its metabolites, indicating negligible basal/radiation-induced NOS activity that remained unchanged even after supplementation with arginine. Cytosolic calcium release following high-dose (1000–2000Gy at 61.1cGys−1) γ-irradiation or H2O2 (250μM) treatment also failed to generate NO in Sf9 cells having high constitutive levels of calmodulin, whereas BMG-1 cells displayed considerable calcium-dependent NO generation even following 10Gy dose. These results strongly imply the lack of calcium-mediated NOS activity in Sf9 cells. Addition of exogenous NO from GSH-NO caused considerable increase in radiation-induced apoptosis, indicating significant contribution of constitutively attenuated nitrosative stress response into the radioresistance of Lepidopteran cells. Our study demonstrates for the first time that a calcium-insensitive, attenuated nitrosative stress response may contribute significantly in the unusual radioresistance displayed by Lepidopteran insect cells.

Abstract: We report the fabrication and characterization of large scale inverted organic solar array fabricated by all-spray process. The inverted polymer solar cell geometry consists of four layers, in the order of ITO–Cs2CO3–(P3HT:PCBM)–modified PEDPT:PSS, on a glass substrate. With semitransparent PEDPT:PSS as anode, the encapsulated solar array shows more than 30% transmission in the visible–near IR range. Optimization of device is done by thermal annealing, and the optimal annealing conditions are shown to be different in single-cell test device and the multiple-cell array. Solar illumination has been demonstrated to improve solar array efficiency up to 250%. Device efficiency of 1.80% was observed with the array under AM1.5 irradiance. Our preliminary data have shown that the performance enhancement under illumination only happens with sprayed devices, not devices made by spin coating. This means that solar cells made with our spray-on technique performs better under sunlight, which is beneficial for solar energy application.

Abstract: In order to investigate the effect of CdCl2 heat treatment on the physical properties of CdTe thin films grown by a sputtering method, the CdTe thin films were coated with CdCl2. The recrystallization, grain growth, randomization, and reaction kinetics were investigated by monitoring the phase transition of CdCl2-heat-treated CdTe specimens during temperature ramp annealing or isothermal soaking by using in-situ time-resolved high-temperature X-ray diffraction. The results of annealing show that the recrystallizations of CdTe (111) and other planes do not occur simultaneously, but sequentially in terms of temperature. The results of isothermal soaking imply that the Avrami diffusion-controlled reaction model fits well with the experimental data. This proves that the CdCl2 diffusion process is the dominant factor in the CdTe recrystallization mechanism.
