Abstract: Summary
The maintenance of protein solubility is a fundamental aspect of cellular homeostasis because protein aggregation is associated with a wide variety of human diseases. Numerous proteins unrelated in sequence and structure, however, can misfold and aggregate, and widespread aggregation can occur in living systems under stress or aging. A crucial question in this context is why only certain proteins appear to aggregate readily in vivo, whereas others do not. We identify here the proteins most vulnerable to aggregation as those whose cellular concentrations are high relative to their solubilities. We find that these supersaturated proteins represent a metastable subproteome involved in pathological aggregation during stress and aging and are overrepresented in biochemical processes associated with neurodegenerative disorders. Consequently, such cellular processes become dysfunctional when the ability to keep intrinsically supersaturated proteins soluble is compromised. Thus, the simultaneous analysis of abundance and solubility can rationalize the diverse cellular pathologies linked to neurodegenerative diseases and aging.

Abstract: Summary
Cells must accurately replicate and segregate their DNA once per cell cycle in order to successfully transmit genetic information. During S phase in the presence of agents that cause replication stress, ATR-dependent checkpoints regulate origin firing and the replication machinery as well as prevent untimely mitosis. Here, we investigate the role of ATR during unperturbed growth in vertebrate cells. In the absence of ATR, individual replication forks progress more slowly, and an increased number of replication origins are activated. These cells also enter mitosis early and divide more rapidly, culminating in chromosome bridges and laggards at anaphase, failed cytokinesis, and cell death. Interestingly, cell death can be rescued by prolonging mitosis with partial inhibition of the mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase 1. Our data indicate that one of the essential roles of ATR during normal growth is to minimize the level of unreplicated DNA before the onset of mitosis.

Transcription Factors Mediate the Enzymatic Disassembly of Promoter-Bound 7SK snRNP to Locally Recruit P-TEFb for Transcription Elongation,

Abstract: Summary
The transition from transcription initiation into elongation is controlled by transcription factors, which recruit positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) to promoters to phosphorylate RNA polymerase II. A fraction of P-TEFb is recruited as part of the inhibitory 7SK small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP), which inactivates the kinase and prevents elongation. However, it is unclear how P-TEFb is captured from the promoter-bound 7SK snRNP to activate elongation. Here, we describe a mechanism by which transcription factors mediate the enzymatic release of P-TEFb from the 7SK snRNP at promoters to trigger activation in a gene-specific manner. We demonstrate that Tat recruits PPM1G/PP2Cγ to locally disassemble P-TEFb from the 7SK snRNP at the HIV promoter via dephosphorylation of the kinase T loop. Similar to Tat, nuclear factor (NF)-κB recruits PPM1G in a stimulus-dependent manner to activate elongation at inflammatory-responsive genes. Recruitment of PPM1G to promoter-assembled 7SK snRNP provides a paradigm for rapid gene activation through transcriptional pause release.

Molecular and Genetic Crosstalks between mTOR and ERRα Are Key Determinants of Rapamycin-Induced Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver,

Abstract: Summary
mTOR and ERRα are key regulators of common metabolic processes, including lipid homeostasis. However, it is currently unknown whether these factors cooperate in the control of metabolism. ChIP-sequencing analyses of mouse liver reveal that mTOR occupies regulatory regions of genes on a genome-wide scale including enrichment at genes shared with ERRα that are involved in the TCA cycle and lipid biosynthesis. Genetic ablation of ERRα and rapamycin treatment, alone or in combination, alter the expression of these genes and induce the accumulation of TCA metabolites. As a consequence, both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of ERRα activity exacerbates hepatic hyperlipidemia observed in rapamycin-treated mice. We further show that mTOR regulates ERRα activity through ubiquitin-mediated degradation via transcriptional control of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Our work expands the role of mTOR action in metabolism and highlights the existence of a potent mTOR/ERRα regulatory axis with significant clinical impact.

Abstract: Summary
Cancers often relapse after adoptive therapy, even though specific T cells kill cells from the same cancer efficiently in vitro. We found that tumor eradication by T cells required high affinities of the targeted peptides for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I. Affinities of at least 10 nM were required for relapse-free regression. Only high-affinity peptide-MHC interactions led to efficient cross-presentation of antigen, thereby stimulating cognate T cells to secrete cytokines. These findings highlight the importance of targeting peptides with high affinity for MHC class I when designing T cell-based immunotherapy.

Abstract: We use here a new very low-Ca2+-affinity targeted aequorin to measure the [Ca2+] in the endoplasmic reticulum ([Ca2+]ER). The new aequorin chimera has the right Ca2+-affinity to make long-lasting measurements of [Ca2+]ER in the millimolar range. Moreover, previous Ca2+-depletion of the ER is no longer required. The steady-state [Ca2+]ER obtained is 1–2mM, higher than previously reported. In addition, we find evidence that there is significant heterogeneity in [Ca2+]ER among different regions of the ER. About half of the ER had a [Ca2+]ER of 1mM or below, and the rest had [Ca2+]ER values above 1mM and in some parts even above 2mM. About 5% of the ER was also found to have high [Ca2+]ER levels but to be thapsigargin-insensitive and inositol trisphosphate insensitive. The rate of refilling with Ca2+ of the ER was almost linearly dependent on the extracellular [Ca2+] between 0.1 and 3mM, and was only partially affected by mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Instead, it was significantly reduced by loading cells with chelators, and the fast chelator BAPTA was much more effective than the slow chelator EGTA. This suggests that local [Ca2+] microdomains connecting the store operated Ca2+ channels with the ER Ca2+ pumps may be important during refilling.

Abstract: Summary
Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a metabolic hormone with pleiotropic effects on regulating glucose and lipid homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. However, the mechanisms underlying the metabolic actions of FGF21 remain unknown. Here we show that the insulin-sensitizing adipokine adiponectin is a downstream effector of FGF21. Treatments with FGF21 enhanced both expression and secretion of adiponectin in adipocytes, thereby increasing serum levels of adiponectin in mice. Adiponectin knockout mice were refractory to several therapeutic benefits of FGF21, including alleviation of obesity-associated hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis. Furthermore, the effects of FGF21 on attenuation of obesity-induced impairment in insulin signaling in liver and skeletal muscle were abrogated in adiponectin knockout mice, whereas FGF21-mediated activation of ERK1/ERK2 in adipose tissues remained unaffected. Therefore, adiponectin couples FGF21 actions in local adipocytes to liver and skeletal muscle, thereby mediating the systemic effects of FGF21 on energy metabolism and insulin sensitivity.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor cell survival critically depends on heterotypic communication with benign cells in the microenvironment. Here, we describe a survival signaling pathway activated in stromal cells by contact to B cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The expression of protein kinase C (PKC)-βII and the subsequent activation of NF-κB in bone marrow stromal cells are prerequisites to support the survival of malignant B cells. PKC-β knockout mice are insusceptible to CLL transplantations, underscoring the in vivo significance of the PKC-βII-NF-κB signaling pathway in the tumor microenvironment. Upregulated stromal PKC-βII in biopsies from patients with CLL, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and mantle cell lymphoma suggests that this pathway may commonly be activated in a variety of hematological malignancies.

Abstract: Recent advances of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has demonstrated that full development potential is closely related with the expression state of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) of the Dlk1-Dio3 imprinted gene cluster. However, few of them, especially the long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), have been characterized in detail. AK044800 is a transcript from the Dlk1-Dio3 imprinted region with little known information. This study reports original data on the expression pattern of AK044800 during embryogenesis. Expression analysis showed that AK044800 was specifically expressed in the brain at midgestation, E9.5 and E11.5. And at E15.5, its expression was mainly concentrated in the forebrain. In the lategestation stage (E18.5), AK044800 expression was weaker in the brain and began to emerge in some other tissues during this period. Notably, the expression of AK044800 was biallelic in the brain, unlike other noncoding transcripts from this imprinted region. In addition, its expression was dependent on inbred mouse strains. This may be the first lncRNA that has been identified with a different expression between inbred mouse strains. This study may provide useful clues for further investigations of expression regulation and functions of lncRNAs of the Dlk1-Dio3 imprinted region.

Abstract: Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) are intracellular Ca2+ channels that elevate cytoplasmic Ca2+ in response to the second messenger IP3. Here, we describe the identification and in vivo functional characterization of the planarian IP3R, the first intracellular Ca2+ channel to be defined in flatworms. A single IP3R gene in Dugesia japonica encoded a 2666 amino acid protein (Dj.IP3R) that shared well conserved structural features with vertebrate IP3R counterparts. Expression of an NH2-terminal Dj.IP3R region (amino acid residues 223–585) recovered high affinity 3H-IP3 binding (0.9±0.1nM) which was abolished by a single point mutation of an arginine residue (R495L) important for IP3 coordination. In situ hybridization revealed that Dj.IP3R mRNA was most strongly expressed in the pharynx and optical nerve system as well as the reproductive system in sexualized planarians. Consistent with this observed tissue distribution, in vivo RNAi of Dj.IP3R resulted in a decreased egg-laying behavior suggesting Dj.IP3R plays an upstream role in planarian reproductive physiology.

Abstract: Summary
Lipid droplets (LDs) store metabolic energy and membrane lipid precursors. With excess metabolic energy, cells synthesize triacylglycerol (TG) and form LDs that grow dramatically. It is unclear how TG synthesis relates to LD formation and growth. Here, we identify two LD subpopulations: smaller LDs of relatively constant size, and LDs that grow larger. The latter population contains isoenzymes for each step of TG synthesis. Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 4 (GPAT4), which catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step, relocalizes from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to a subset of forming LDs, where it becomes stably associated. ER-to-LD targeting of GPAT4 and other LD-localized TG synthesis isozymes is required for LD growth. Key features of GPAT4 ER-to-LD targeting and function in LD growth are conserved between Drosophila and mammalian cells. Our results explain how TG synthesis is coupled with LD growth and identify two distinct LD subpopulations based on their capacity for localized TG synthesis.

Sustained Activation of mTORC1 in Skeletal Muscle Inhibits Constitutive and Starvation-Induced Autophagy and Causes a Severe, Late-Onset Myopathy,

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy is a catabolic process that ensures homeostatic cell clearance and is deregulated in a growing number of myopathological conditions. Although FoxO3 was shown to promote the expression of autophagy-related genes in skeletal muscle, the mechanisms triggering autophagy are unclear. We show that TSC1-deficient mice (TSCmKO), characterized by sustained activation of mTORC1, develop a late-onset myopathy related to impaired autophagy. In young TSCmKO mice, constitutive and starvation-induced autophagy is blocked at the induction steps via mTORC1-mediated inhibition of Ulk1, despite FoxO3 activation. Rapamycin is sufficient to restore autophagy in TSCmKO mice and improves the muscle phenotype of old mutant mice. Inversely, abrogation of mTORC1 signaling by depletion of raptor induces autophagy regardless of FoxO inhibition. Thus, mTORC1 is the dominant regulator of autophagy induction in skeletal muscle and ensures a tight coordination of metabolic pathways. These findings may open interesting avenues for therapeutic strategies directed toward autophagy-related muscle diseases.

Abstract: Glucocorticoids are steroid hormones which act through the glucocorticoid receptor. They regulate a wide variety of biological processes. Two glucocorticoids, the naturally occurring corticosterone and chemically produced dexamethasone, have been used to investigate the effect of glucocorticoids on Ca2+-signalling in cortical co-cultures of neurons and astrocytes. Dexamethasone and to a lesser degree corticosterone both induced a decrease in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in neurons and astrocytes. The effect of both compounds can be blocked by inhibition of the plasmamembrane ATPase, calmodulin and by application of a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, while inhibition of NMDA receptors or the endoplasmic reticulum calcium pump had no effect. Glucocorticoid treatment further protects against detrimental calcium signalling and cell death by modulating the delayed calcium deregulation in response to glutamate toxicity. At the concentrations used dexamethasone and corticosterone did not show cell toxicity of their own. Thus, these results indicate that dexamethasone and corticosterone might be used for protection of the cells from calcium overload.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription termination is an essential step in protein-coding gene expression that is mediated by pre-mRNA processing activities and DNA-encoded terminator elements. Although much is known about the role of pre-mRNA processing in termination, our understanding of the characteristics and generality of terminator elements is limited. Whereas promoter databases list up to 40,000 known and potential Pol II promoter sequences, fewer than ten Pol II terminator sequences have been described. Using our knowledge of the human β-globin terminator mechanism, we have developed a selection strategy for mapping mammalian Pol II terminator elements. We report the identification of 78 cotranscriptional cleavage (CoTC)-type terminator elements at endogenous gene loci. The results of this analysis pave the way for the full understanding of Pol II termination pathways and their roles in gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
A small toolkit of morphogens is used repeatedly to direct development, raising the question of how context dictates interpretation of the same cue. One example is the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) pathway that in human embryonic stem cells fulfills two opposite functions: pluripotency maintenance and mesendoderm (ME) specification. Using proteomics coupled to analysis of genome occupancy, we uncover a regulatory complex composed of transcriptional effectors of the Hippo pathway (TAZ/YAP/TEAD), the TGF-β pathway (SMAD2/3), and the pluripotency regulator OCT4 (TSO). TSO collaborates with NuRD repressor complexes to buffer pluripotency gene expression while suppressing ME genes. Importantly, the SMAD DNA binding partner FOXH1, a major specifier of ME, is found near TSO elements, and upon fate specification we show that TSO is disrupted with subsequent SMAD-FOXH1 induction of ME. These studies define switch-enhancer elements and provide a framework to understand how cellular context dictates interpretation of the same morphogen signal in development.

Abstract: Summary
Phyllotaxis and vein formation are among the most conspicuous patterning processes in plants. The expression and polarization of the auxin efflux carrier PIN1 is the earliest marker for both processes, with mathematical models indicating that PIN1 can respond to auxin gradients and/or auxin flux. Here, we use cell-layer-specific PIN1 knockouts and partial complementation of auxin transport mutants to examine the interaction between phyllotactic patterning, which occurs primarily in the L1 surface layer of the meristem, and midvein specification in the inner tissues. We show that PIN1 expression in the L1 is sufficient for correct organ positioning, as long as the L1-specific influx carriers are present. Thus, differentiation of inner tissues can proceed without PIN1 or any of the known polar transporters. On theoretical grounds, we suggest that canalization of auxin flux between an auxin source and an auxin sink may involve facilitated diffusion rather than polar transport.

Abstract: Persistent inflammation results in an increase in the magnitude and duration of high K+-evoked Ca2+ transients in putative nociceptive cutaneous dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether recruitment of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) contributes to these inflammation-induced changes. Acutely dissociated, retrogradely labeled cutaneous DRG neurons from naïve and complete Freund's adjuvant inflamed adult male Sprague–Dawley rats were studied with ratiometric microfluorimetry. Ryanodine only attenuated the duration but not magnitude of the high K+-evoked Ca2+ transient in neurons from inflamed rats. However, there was no significant impact of inflammation on the potency or efficacy of ryanodine-induced block of the caffeine-evoked Ca2+ transient, or the impact of sarco-endoplasmic reticulum ATPase (SERCA) inhibition on the high K+-evoked Ca2+ transient. Furthermore, while there was no change in the magnitude, an inflammation-induced increase in the duration of the caffeine-evoked Ca2+ transient was only observed with a prolonged caffeine application. In contrast to the high K+-evoked Ca2+ transient, there was no evidence of direct mitochondrial involvement or that of the Ca2+ extrusion mechanism, the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, on the caffeine-evoked Ca2+ transient, and block of SERCA only increased the duration of this transient. These results indicate the presence of Ca2+ regulatory domains in cutaneous nociceptive DRG neurons within which cytosolic Ca2+ increased via influx and release are highly segregated. Furthermore, our results suggest that changes in neither CICR machinery nor the coupling between Ca2+ influx and CICR are primarily responsible for the inflammation-induced changes in the evoked Ca2+ transient.

Abstract: Summary
PIK3CA, which encodes the p110α catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase α, is frequently mutated in human cancers. Most of these mutations occur at two hot-spots: E545K and H1047R located in the helical domain and the kinase domain, respectively. Here, we report that p110α E545K, but not p110α H1047R, gains the ability to associate with IRS1 independent of the p85 regulatory subunit, thereby rewiring this oncogenic signaling pathway. Disruption of the IRS1-p110α E545K interaction destabilizes the p110α protein, reduces AKT phosphorylation, and slows xenograft tumor growth of a cancer cell line expressing p110α E545K. Moreover, a hydrocarbon-stapled peptide that disrupts this interaction inhibits the growth of tumors expressing p110α E545K.

Abstract: Summary
The melanocortin receptor 4 (MC4R) is a well-established mediator of body weight homeostasis. However, the neurotransmitter(s) that mediate MC4R function remain largely unknown; as a result, little is known about the second-order neurons of the MC4R neural pathway. Single-minded 1 (Sim1)-expressing brain regions, which include the paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus (PVH), represent key brain sites that mediate melanocortin action. We conditionally restored MC4R expression in Sim1 neurons in the background of Mc4r-null mice. The restoration dramatically reduced obesity in Mc4r-null mice. The anti-obesity effect was completely reversed by selective disruption of glutamate release from those same Sim1 neurons. The reversal was caused by lower energy expenditure and hyperphagia. Corroboratively, selective disruption of glutamate release from adult PVH neurons led to rapid obesity development via reduced energy expenditure and hyperphagia. Thus, this study establishes glutamate as the primary neurotransmitter that mediates MC4Rs on Sim1 neurons in body weight regulation.

Abstract: Summary
pRb and p53 are two major tumor suppressors. Here, we found that p53 activates expression of Pirh2 and KPC1, two of the three ubiquitin ligases for p27. Loss of p53 in the absence of Skp2, the third ubiquitin ligase for p27, shrinks the cellular pool of p27 ubiquitin ligases to accumulate p27 protein. In the absence of pRb and p53, p27 was unable to inhibit DNA synthesis in spite of its abundance, but could inhibit division of cells that maintain DNA replication with rereplication. This mechanism blocked pRb/p53 doubly deficient pituitary and prostate tumorigenesis lastingly coexistent with bromodeoxyuridine-labeling neoplastic lesions, revealing an unconventional cancer cell vulnerability when pRb and p53 are inactivated.

Abstract: Summary
The placenta provides the interface for gas and nutrient exchange between the mother and the fetus. Despite its critical function in sustaining pregnancy, the stem/progenitor cell hierarchy and molecular mechanisms responsible for the development of the placental exchange interface are poorly understood. We identified an Epcamhi labyrinth trophoblast progenitor (LaTP) in mouse placenta that at a clonal level generates all labyrinth trophoblast subtypes, syncytiotrophoblasts I and II, and sinusoidal trophoblast giant cells. Moreover, we discovered that hepatocyte growth factor/c-Met signaling is required for sustaining proliferation of LaTP during midgestation. Loss of trophoblast c-Met also disrupted terminal differentiation and polarization of syncytiotrophoblasts, leading to intrauterine fetal growth restriction, fetal liver hypocellularity, and demise. Identification of this c-Met-dependent multipotent LaTP provides a landmark in the poorly defined placental stem/progenitor cell hierarchy and may help us understand pregnancy complications caused by a defective placental exchange.

Abstract: Summary
The DNA remodeling enzyme FANCM and its DNA-binding partner, FAAP24, constitute a complex involved in the activation of Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA damage response mechanism, but neither gene has distinct patient mutants. In this study, we created isogenic models for both FANCM and FAAP24 and investigated their integrated functions in DNA damage response. We found that FANCM and FAAP24 coordinately facilitate FA pathway activation and suppress sister chromatid exchange. Importantly, we show that FANCM and FAAP24 possess nonoverlapping functions such that FAAP24 promotes ATR-mediated checkpoint activation particularly in response to DNA crosslinking agents, whereas FANCM participates in recombination-independent interstrand crosslink repair by facilitating recruitment of lesion incision activities, which requires its translocase activity. Our data suggest that FANCM and FAAP24 play multiple, while not fully epistatic, roles in maintaining genomic integrity.

Abstract: Summary
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting nearly 1 in 88 children, is thought to result from aberrant brain connectivity. Remarkably, there have been no systematic attempts to characterize whole-brain connectivity in children with ASD. Here, we use neuroimaging to show that there are more instances of greater functional connectivity in the brains of children with ASD in comparison to those of typically developing children. Hyperconnectivity in ASD was observed at the whole-brain and subsystems levels, across long- and short-range connections, and was associated with higher levels of fluctuations in regional brain signals. Brain hyperconnectivity predicted symptom severity in ASD, such that children with greater functional connectivity exhibited more severe social deficits. We replicated these findings in two additional independent cohorts, demonstrating again that at earlier ages, the brain of children with ASD is largely functionally hyperconnected in ways that contribute to social dysfunction. Our findings provide unique insights into brain mechanisms underlying childhood autism.

Abstract: Summary
Eukaryotic cell division is controlled by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which require phosphorylation by a CDK-activating kinase (CAK) for full activity. Chemical genetics uncovered requirements for the metazoan CAK Cdk7 in determining cyclin specificity and activation order of Cdk2 and Cdk1 during S and G2 phases. It was unknown if Cdk7 also activates Cdk4 and Cdk6 to promote passage of the restriction (R) point, when continued cell-cycle progression becomes mitogen independent, or if CDK-activating phosphorylation regulates G1 progression. Here we show that Cdk7 is a Cdk4- and Cdk6-activating kinase in human cells, required to maintain activity, not just to establish the active state, as is the case for Cdk1 and Cdk2. Activating phosphorylation of Cdk7 rises concurrently with that of Cdk4 as cells exit quiescence and accelerates Cdk4 activation in vitro. Therefore, mitogen signaling drives a CDK-activation cascade during G1 progression, and CAK might be rate-limiting for R point passage.

Abstract: Summary
Endosomal trafficking and degradation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) play an essential role in the control of its signaling. Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns4,5P2) is an established regulator of endocytosis, whereas PtdIns3P modulates endosomal trafficking. However, we demonstrate here that type I gamma phosphatidylinositol phosphate 5-kinase i5 (PIPKIγi5), an enzyme that synthesizes PtdIns4,5P2, controls endosome-to-lysosome sorting of EGFR. In this pathway, PIPKIγi5 interacts with sorting nexin 5 (SNX5), a protein that binds PtdIns4,5P2 and other phosphoinositides. PIPKIγi5 and SNX5 localize to endosomes, and loss of either protein blocks EGFR sorting into intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) of the multivesicular body. Loss of ILV sorting greatly enhances and prolongs EGFR signaling. PIPKIγi5 and SNX5 prevent Hrs ubiquitination, and this facilitates the Hrs association with EGFR that is required for ILV sorting. These findings reveal that PIPKIγi5 and SNX5 form a signaling nexus that controls EGFR endosomal sorting, degradation, and signaling.

Abstract: Summary
SR proteins are well-characterized RNA binding proteins that promote exon inclusion by binding to exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs). However, it has been unclear whether regulatory rules deduced on model genes apply generally to activities of SR proteins in the cell. Here, we report global analyses of two prototypical SR proteins, SRSF1 (SF2/ASF) and SRSF2 (SC35), using splicing-sensitive arrays and CLIP-seq on mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). Unexpectedly, we find that these SR proteins promote both inclusion and skipping of exons in vivo, but their binding patterns do not explain such opposite responses. Further analyses reveal that loss of one SR protein is accompanied by coordinated loss or compensatory gain in the interaction of other SR proteins at the affected exons. Therefore, specific effects on regulated splicing by one SR protein actually depend on a complex set of relationships with multiple other SR proteins in mammalian genomes.

Abstract: Summary
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are typically generated as ∼22-nucleotide double-stranded RNAs via the processing of precursor hairpins by the ribonuclease III enzyme Dicer, after which they are loaded into Argonaute (Ago) proteins to form an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). However, the biogenesis of miR-451, an erythropoietic miRNA conserved in vertebrates, occurs independently of Dicer and instead requires cleavage of the 3′ arm of the pre-miR-451 precursor hairpin by Ago2. The 3′ end of the Ago2-cleaved pre-miR-451 intermediate is then trimmed to the mature length by an unknown nuclease. Here, using a classical chromatographic approach, we identified poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) as the enzyme responsible for the 3′–5′ exonucleolytic trimming of Ago2-cleaved pre-miR-451. Surprisingly, our data show that trimming of Ago2-cleaved precursor miRNAs is not essential for target silencing, indicating that RISC is functional with miRNAs longer than the mature length. Our findings define the maturation step in the miRNA biogenesis pathway that depends on Ago2-mediated cleavage.

Abstract: Summary
Thymic epithelial cells in the medulla (mTECs) play a critical role in enforcing central tolerance through expression and presentation of tissue-specific antigens (TSAs) and deletion of autoreactive thymocytes. TSA expression requires autoimmune regulator (Aire), a transcriptional activator present in a subset of mTECs characterized by high CD80 and major histocompatibility complex II expression and a lack of potential for differentiation or proliferation. Here, using an Aire-DTR transgenic line, we show that short-term ablation specifically targets Aire+ mTECs, which quickly undergo RANK-dependent recovery. Repeated ablation also affects Aire− mTECs, and using an inducible Aire-Cre fate-mapping system, we find that this results from the loss of a subset of mTECs that showed prior expression of Aire, maintains intermediate TSA expression, and preferentially migrates toward the center of the medulla. These results clearly identify a distinct stage of mTEC development and underscore the diversity of mTECs that play a key role in maintaining tolerance.

Abstract: Summary
Nongenetic cell-to-cell variability often plays an important role for the survival of a clonal population in the face of fluctuating environments. However, the underlying mechanisms regulating such nongenetic heterogeneity remain elusive in most organisms. We report here that a clonal yeast population exhibits morphological heterogeneity when the level of Hsp90, a molecular chaperone, is reduced. The morphological heterogeneity is driven by the dosage of Cdc28 and Cla4, a key regulator of septin formation. Low Hsp90 levels reduce Cla4 protein stability and cause a subpopulation of cells to switch to a filamentous form that has been previously suggested to be beneficial under certain hostile environments. Moreover, Hsp90-dependent morphological heterogeneity can be induced by environmental stress and is conserved across diverse yeast species. Our results suggest that Hsp90 provides an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that links environmental stress to the induction of morphological diversity.

Abstract: Summary
The inflammatory microenvironment promotes skin tumorigenesis. However, the mechanisms by which cells protect themselves from inflammatory signals are unknown. Downregulation of IKKα promotes skin tumor progression from papillomas to squamous cell carcinomas, which is frequently accompanied by genomic instability, including aneuploid chromosomes and extra centrosomes. In this study, we found that IKKα promoted oligomerization of nucleophosmin (NPM), a negative centrosome duplication regulator, which further enhanced NPM and centrosome association, inhibited centrosome amplification, and maintained genome integrity. Levels of NPM hexamers and IKKα were conversely associated with skin tumor progression. Importantly, proinflammatory cytokine-induced IKKα activation promoted the formation of NPM oligomers and reduced centrosome numbers in mouse and human cells, whereas kinase-dead IKKα blocked this connection. Therefore, our findings suggest a mechanism in which an IKKα-NPM axis may use inflammatory signals to suppress centrosome amplification, promote genomic integrity, and prevent tumor progression.

Abstract: Summary
The molecular mechanisms regulating leukemia-initiating cell (LIC) function are of important clinical significance. We use chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) as a model of LIC-dependent malignancy and identify the interaction between the ubiquitin ligase Fbw7 and its substrate c-Myc as a regulator of LIC homeostasis. Deletion of Fbw7 leads to c-Myc overexpression, p53-dependent LIC-specific apoptosis, and the eventual inhibition of tumor progression. A decrease of either c-Myc protein levels or attenuation of the p53 response rescues LIC activity and disease progression. Further experiments showed that Fbw7 expression is required for survival and maintenance of human CML LIC. These studies identify a ubiquitin ligase:substrate pair regulating LIC activity, suggesting that targeting of the Fbw7:c-Myc axis is an attractive therapy target in refractory CML.

Abstract: Silks are fibres produced by spiders, some insects and even a crustacean, and are formed from protein solution by a pulltrusion process that is not well understood. Here we describe three aspects of the functional anatomy of the spinning apparatus in a spider: (i) changes in the diameter of the duct of the silk gland along its length for individuals at different stages of development, (ii) the correlation between the morphology of the duct and size and (iii) changes in the thickness of the wall of the duct. We conclude that in the distal part of the duct both the lumen's geometry and change in diameter with distance remains remarkably constant as the duct increases in length from moult to moult as the spider grows. This suggests constancy in the region where the nascent silk filament is drawn down within the lumen of the duct, which is likely to be fundamental for forming strong and tough fibres.

Abstract: Summary
Excessive caloric intake leading to obesity is associated with insulin resistance and dysfunction of islet β cells. High-fat feeding decreases desnutrin (also called ATGL/PNPLA2) levels in islets. Here we show that desnutrin ablation via RIP-Cre (βKO) or RIP-CreER results in hyperglycemia with impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Due to decreased lipolysis, islets have higher TAG content but lower free FA levels. βKO islets exhibit impaired mitochondrial respiration and lower production of ATP required for GSIS, along with decreased expression of PPARδ target genes involved in mitochondrial oxidation. Furthermore, synthetic PPARδ, but not PPARα, agonist restores GSIS and expression of mitochondrial oxidative genes in βKO mice, revealing that desnutrin-catalyzed lipolysis generates PPARδ ligands. Finally, adenoviral expression of desnutrin in βKO islets restores all defects of βKO islet phenotype and function, including GSIS and mitochondrial defects, demonstrating the critical role of the desnutrin-PPARδ-mitochondrial oxidation axis in regulating islet β cell GSIS.

Abstract: Summary
In both flies and mammals, almost one-third of the newly emerging male germ cells are spontaneously eliminated before entering meiosis. Here, we show that in Drosophila, germ cell death (GCD) involves the initiator caspase Dronc independently of the apoptosome and the main executioner caspases. Electron microscopy of dying germ cells revealed mixed morphologies of apoptosis and necrosis. We further show that the lysosomes and their catabolic enzymes, but not macroautophagy, are involved in the execution of GCD. We then identified, in a screen, the Parkinson’s disease-associated mitochondrial protease, HtrA2/Omi, as an important mediator of GCD, acting mainly through its catalytic activity rather than by antagonizing inhibitor of apoptosis proteins. Concomitantly, other mitochondrial-associated factors were also implicated in GCD, including Pink1 (but not Parkin), the Bcl-2-related proteins, and endonuclease G, which establish the mitochondria as central mediators of GCD. These findings uncover an alternative developmental cell death pathway in metazoans.

Abstract: Summary
How the cell recognizes cytosolic DNA including DNA-based microbes to trigger host-defense-related gene activation remains to be fully resolved. Here, we demonstrate that STING (stimulator of interferon genes), an endoplasmic reticulum translocon-associated transmembrane protein, acts to detect cytoplasmic DNA species. STING homodimers were able to complex with self- (apoptotic, necrotic) or pathogen-related ssDNA and dsDNA and were indispensible for HSV-1-mediated transcriptional activation of a wide array of innate immune and proinflammatory genes in addition to type I IFN. Our data indicate that STING instigates cytoplasmic DNA-mediated cellular defense gene transcription and facilitates adoptive responses that are required for protection of the host. In contrast, chronic STING activation may manifest inflammatory responses and possibly autoimmune disease triggered by self-DNA.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor cells commonly have increased glucose uptake and lactate accumulation. Lactate is produced from pyruvate by lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A), which is frequently overexpressed in tumor cells and is important for cell growth. Elevated transcription by c-Myc or HIF1α may contribute to increased LDH-A in some cancer types. Here, we show that LDH-A is acetylated at lysine 5 (K5) and that this acetylation inhibits LDH-A activity. Furthermore, the K5-acetylated LDH-A is recognized by the HSC70 chaperone and delivered to lysosomes for degradation. Replacement of endogenous LDH-A with an acetylation mimetic mutant decreases cell proliferation and migration. Importantly, K5 acetylation of LDH-A is reduced in human pancreatic cancers. Our study reveals a mechanism of LDH-A upregulation in pancreatic cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Protein modification by O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is a critical cell signaling modality, but identifying signal-specific O-GlcNAcylation events remains a significant experimental challenge. Here, we describe a method for visualizing and analyzing organelle- and stimulus-specific O-GlcNAcylated proteins and use it to identify the mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel 2 (VDAC2) as an O-GlcNAc substrate. VDAC2−/− cells resist the mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis caused by global O-GlcNAc perturbation, demonstrating a functional connection between O-GlcNAc signaling and mitochondrial physiology through VDAC2. More broadly, our method will enable the discovery of signal-specific O-GlcNAcylation events in a wide array of experimental contexts.

Abstract: Summary
Significant endeavor has been applied to identify functional therapeutic targets in glioblastoma (GBM) to halt the growth of this aggressive cancer. We show that the receptor tyrosine kinase EphA3 is frequently overexpressed in GBM and, in particular, in the most aggressive mesenchymal subtype. Importantly, EphA3 is highly expressed on the tumor-initiating cell population in glioma and appears critically involved in maintaining tumor cells in a less differentiated state by modulating mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. EphA3 knockdown or depletion of EphA3-positive tumor cells reduced tumorigenic potential to a degree comparable to treatment with a therapeutic radiolabelled EphA3-specific monoclonal antibody. These results identify EphA3 as a functional, targetable receptor in GBM.

SNAREs (soluble NSF [N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor] attachment protein receptors) are required for membrane-to-membrane interaction, i.e. docking and fusion also in Paramecium. We have identified three v-/R- and three t/Q-SNAREs selectively in the CVC. Posttranscriptional silencing of Syb2, Syb6 or Syx2 slows down the pumping cycle; silencing of the latter two also causes vacuole swelling. Increase in extracellular Ca2+ after Syb2, Syb6 or Syx2 silencing causes further swelling of the contractile vacuole and deceleration of its pulsation. Silencing of Syx14 or Syx15 entails lethality in the Ca2+ stress test. Thus, the effects of silencing strictly depend on the type of the silenced SNARE and on the concentration of Ca2+ in the medium. This shows the importance of organelle-resident SNARE functions (which may encompass the vesicular delivery of other organelle-resident proteins) for Ca2+ tolerance. A similar principle may be applicable also to the CVC in widely different unicellular organisms. In addition, in Paramecium, silencing particularly of Syx6 causes aberrant positioning of the CVC during de novo biogenesis before cytokinesis.

Abstract: Summary
ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes are highly abundant and play pivotal roles regulating DNA-dependent processes. The mechanisms by which they are targeted to specific loci have not been well understood on a genome-wide scale. Here, we present evidence that a major targeting mechanism for the Isw2 chromatin remodeling enzyme to specific genomic loci is through sequence-specific transcription factor (TF)-dependent recruitment. Unexpectedly, Isw2 is recruited in a TF-dependent fashion to a large number of loci without TF binding sites. Using the 3C assay, we show that Isw2 can be targeted by Ume6- and TFIIB-dependent DNA looping. These results identify DNA looping as a mechanism for the recruitment of a chromatin remodeling enzyme and define a function for DNA looping. We also present evidence suggesting that Ume6-dependent DNA looping is involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression, revealing a mechanism by which the three-dimensional folding of chromatin affects DNA-dependent processes.

Abstract: Summary
Currently, it remains controversial how vascular endothelial progenitor cells (angioblasts) establish their arterial or venous fates. We show using zebrafish that the arterial progenitors of the major axial vessels originate earlier and closer to the midline than the venous progenitors. Both medial and lateral progenitor populations migrate to distinct arterial and venous positions and not into a common precursor vessel as previously suggested. Overexpression of VEGF or Hedgehog (Hh) homologs results in the partially randomized distribution of arterial and venous progenitors within the axial vessels. We further demonstrate that the function of the Etv2 transcription factor is required at earlier stages for arterial development than for venous. Our results argue that the medial angioblasts undergo arterial differentiation because they receive higher concentration of Vegf and Hh morphogens than the lateral angioblasts. We propose a revised model of arterial-venous differentiation that explains how angioblasts choose between an arterial and venous fate.

Abstract: Summary
Localized cell shape change initiates epithelial folding, while neighboring cell invagination determines the final depth of an epithelial fold. The mechanism that controls the extent of invagination remains unknown. During Drosophila gastrulation, a higher number of cells undergo invagination to form the deep posterior dorsal fold, whereas far fewer cells become incorporated into the initially very similar anterior dorsal fold. We find that a decrease in α-catenin activity causes the anterior fold to invaginate as extensively as the posterior fold. In contrast, constitutive activation of the small GTPase Rap1 restricts invagination of both dorsal folds in an α-catenin-dependent manner. Rap1 activity appears spatially modulated by Rapgap1, whose expression levels are high in the cells that flank the posterior fold but low in the anterior fold. We propose a model whereby distinct activity states of Rap1 modulate α-catenin-dependent coupling between junctions and actin to control the extent of epithelial invagination.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer cells reprogram their metabolism using different strategies to meet energy and anabolic demands to maintain growth and survival. Understanding the molecular and genetic determinants of these metabolic programs is critical to successfully exploit them for therapy. Here, we report that the oncogenic melanocyte lineage-specification transcription factor MITF drives PGC1α (PPARGC1A) overexpression in a subset of human melanomas and derived cell lines. Functionally, PGC1α positive melanoma cells exhibit increased mitochondrial energy metabolism and reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification capacities that enable survival under oxidative stress conditions. Conversely, PGC1α negative melanoma cells are more glycolytic and sensitive to ROS-inducing drugs. These results demonstrate that differences in PGC1α levels in melanoma tumors have a profound impact in their metabolism, biology, and drug sensitivity.

Abstract: Sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response syndrome, remains a potentially lethal condition. (S)-1-α-Naphthylmethyl-6,7-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (CKD712) is noted as a drug candidate for sepsis. Many studies have demonstrated its significant anti-inflammatory effects. Here we first examined whether CKD712 inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced arachidonic acid (AA) release in the RAW 264.7 mouse monocyte cell line, and subsequently, its inhibitory mechanisms. CKD712 reversed LPS-associated morphological changes in the RAW 264.7 cells, and inhibited LPS-induced release of AA in a concentrationdependent manner. The inhibition was apparently due to the diminished expression of a cytosolic form of phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) by CKD712, resulting from reduced NFĸB activation. Furthermore, CKD712 inhibited the activation of ERK1/2 and SAP/JNK, but not of p38 MAPK. CKD712 had no effect on the activity or phosphorylation of cPLA2 and on calcium influx. Our results collectively suggest that CKD712 inhibits LPS-induced AA release through the inhibition of a MAPKs/NF-ĸB pathway leading to reduced cPLA2 expression in RAW 264.7 cells.

Abstract: Summary
The mTORC1 kinase is a master growth regulator that senses numerous environmental cues, including amino acids. The Rag GTPases interact with mTORC1 and signal amino acid sufficiency by promoting the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, its site of activation. The Rags are unusual GTPases in that they function as obligate heterodimers, which consist of RagA or B bound to RagC or D. While the loading of RagA/B with GTP initiates amino acid signaling to mTORC1, the role of RagC/D is unknown. Here, we show that RagC/D is a key regulator of the interaction of mTORC1 with the Rag heterodimer and that, unexpectedly, RagC/D must be GDP bound for the interaction to occur. We identify FLCN and its binding partners, FNIP1/2, as Rag-interacting proteins with GAP activity for RagC/D, but not RagA/B. Thus, we reveal a role for RagC/D in mTORC1 activation and a molecular function for the FLCN tumor suppressor.

Abstract: Epigenetic modifications affect gene expression and thereby govern a wide range of biological processes such as differentiation, development and tumorigenesis. Recent initiatives to define genome-wide DNA methylation and histone modification profiles by microarray and sequencing methods have led to the construction of databases. These databases are repositories for international epigenetic consortiums or provide mining results from PubMed, but do not integrate the epigenetic information with gene expression changes. In order to overcome this limitation, we constructed EPITRANS, a novel database that visualizes the relationships between gene expression and epigenetic modifications. EPITRANS uses combined analysis of epigenetic modification and gene expression to search for cell function-related epigenetic and transcriptomic alterations (Freely available on the web at http://epitrans.org).

Abstract: Summary
Toxin-antitoxin (TA) modules, composed of a toxic protein and a counteracting antitoxin, play important roles in bacterial physiology. We examined the experimental insertion of 1.5 million genes from 388 microbial genomes into an Escherichia coli host using more than 8.5 million random clones. This revealed hundreds of genes (toxins) that could only be cloned when the neighboring gene (antitoxin) was present on the same clone. Clustering of these genes revealed TA families widespread in bacterial genomes, some of which deviate from the classical characteristics previously described for such modules. Introduction of these genes into E. coli validated that the toxin toxicity is mitigated by the antitoxin. Infection experiments with T7 phage showed that two of the new modules can provide resistance against phage. Moreover, our experiments revealed an “antidefense” protein in phage T7 that neutralizes phage resistance. Our results expose active fronts in the arms race between bacteria and phage.

Abstract: Summary
Adipose-resident T cells (ARTs) regulate metabolic and inflammatory responses in obesity, but ART activation signals are poorly understood. Here, we describe class II major histocompatibility complex (MHCII) as an important component of high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced obesity. Microarray analysis of primary adipocytes revealed that multiple genes involved in MHCII antigen processing and presentation increased in obese women. In mice, adipocyte MHCII increased within 2 weeks on HFD, paralleling increases in proinflammatory ART markers and decreases in anti-inflammatory ART markers, and preceding adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) accumulation and proinflammatory M1 polarization. Mouse 3T3-L1 and primary adipocytes activated T cells in an antigen-specific, contact-dependent manner, indicating that adipocyte MHCII is functional. HFD-fed MHCII−/− mice developed less adipose inflammation and insulin resistance than did wild-type mice, despite developing similar adiposity. These investigations uncover a mechanism whereby a HFD-induced adipocyte/ART dialog involving MHCII instigates adipose inflammation and, together with ATM MHCII, escalates its progression.

Abstract: Summary
The progression of cancer to metastatic disease is a major cause of death. We identified miR-708 being transcriptionally repressed by polycomb repressor complex 2-induced H3K27 trimethylation in metastatic breast cancer. miR-708 targets the endoplasmic reticulum protein neuronatin to decrease intracellular calcium level, resulting in reduction of activation of ERK and FAK, decreased cell migration, and impaired metastases. Ectopic expression of neuronatin refractory to suppression by miR-708 rescued cell migration and metastasis defects. In patients with breast cancer, miR-708 expression was decreased in lymph node and distal metastases, suggesting a metastasis-suppressive role. Our findings uncover a mechanistic role for miR-708 in metastasis and provide a rationale for developing miR-708 as a therapeutic agent against metastatic breast cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Hypoxic and VHL-deficient cells use glutamine to generate citrate and lipids through reductive carboxylation (RC) of α-ketoglutarate. To gain insights into the role of HIF and the molecular mechanisms underlying RC, we took advantage of a panel of disease-associated VHL mutants and showed that HIF expression is necessary and sufficient for the induction of RC in human renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells. HIF expression drastically reduced intracellular citrate levels. Feeding VHL-deficient RCC cells with acetate or citrate or knocking down PDK-1 and ACLY restored citrate levels and suppressed RC. These data suggest that HIF-induced low intracellular citrate levels promote the reductive flux by mass action to maintain lipogenesis. Using [1–13C]glutamine, we demonstrated in vivo RC activity in VHL-deficient tumors growing as xenografts in mice. Lastly, HIF rendered VHL-deficient cells sensitive to glutamine deprivation in vitro, and systemic administration of glutaminase inhibitors suppressed the growth of RCC cells as mice xenografts.

Abstract: Summary
Many animals utilize acoustic signals—or songs—to attract mates. During courtship, Drosophila melanogaster males vibrate a wing to produce trains of pulses and extended tone, called pulse and sine song, respectively. Courtship songs in the genus Drosophila are exceedingly diverse, and different song features appear to have evolved independently of each other. How the nervous system allows such diversity to evolve is not understood. Here, we identify a wing muscle in D. melanogaster (hg1) that is uniquely male-enlarged. The hg1 motoneuron and the sexually dimorphic development of the hg1 muscle are required specifically for the sine component of the male song. In contrast, the motoneuron innervating a sexually monomorphic wing muscle, ps1, is required specifically for a feature of pulse song. Thus, individual wing motor pathways can control separate aspects of courtship song and may provide a “modular” anatomical substrate for the evolution of diverse songs.

Abstract: Summary
The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a master regulator of metabolic homeostasis by sensing cellular energy status. AMPK is mainly activated via phosphorylation by LKB1 when cellular AMP/ADP levels are increased. However, how AMP/ADP brings about AMPK phosphorylation remains unclear. Here, we show that it is AMP, but not ADP, that drives AXIN to directly tether LKB1 to phosphorylate AMPK. The complex formation of AXIN-AMPK-LKB1 is greatly enhanced in glucose-starved or AICAR-treated cells and in cell-free systems supplemented with exogenous AMP. Depletion of AXIN abrogated starvation-induced AMPK-LKB1 colocalization. Importantly, adenovirus-based knockdown of AXIN in the mouse liver impaired AMPK activation and caused exacerbated fatty liver after starvation, underscoring an essential role of AXIN in AMPK activation. These findings demonstrate an initiating role of AMP and demonstrate that AXIN directly transmits AMP binding of AMPK to its activation by LKB1, uncovering the mechanistic route for AMP to elicit AMPK activation by LKB1.

Abstract: Summary
Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are believed to regulate gene transcription by catalyzing deacetylation reactions. HDAC3 depletion in mouse liver upregulates lipogenic genes and results in severe hepatosteatosis. Here we show that pharmacologic HDAC inhibition in primary hepatocytes causes histone hyperacetylation but does not upregulate expression of HDAC3 target genes. Meanwhile, deacetylase-dead HDAC3 mutants can rescue hepatosteatosis and repress lipogenic genes expression in HDAC3-depleted mouse liver, demonstrating that histone acetylation is insufficient to activate gene transcription. Mutations abolishing interactions with the nuclear receptor corepressor (NCOR or SMRT) render HDAC3 nonfunctional in vivo. Additionally, liver-specific knockout of NCOR, but not SMRT, causes metabolic and transcriptomal alterations resembling those of mice without hepatic HDAC3, demonstrating that interaction with NCOR is essential for deacetylase-independent function of HDAC3. These findings highlight nonenzymatic roles of a major HDAC in transcriptional regulation in vivo and warrant reconsideration of the mechanism of action of HDAC inhibitors.

Abstract: Summary
The DNA damage response (DDR) is activated by oncogenic stress, but the mechanisms by which this occurs, and the particular DDR functions that constitute barriers to tumorigenesis, remain unclear. We established a mouse model of sporadic oncogene-driven breast tumorigenesis in a series of mutant mouse strains with specific DDR deficiencies to reveal a role for the Mre11 complex in the response to oncogene activation. We demonstrate that an Mre11-mediated DDR restrains mammary hyperplasia by effecting an oncogene-induced G2 arrest. Impairment of Mre11 complex functions promotes the progression of mammary hyperplasias into invasive and metastatic breast cancers, which are often associated with secondary inactivation of the Ink4a-Arf (CDKN2a) locus. These findings provide insight into the mechanism of DDR engagement by activated oncogenes and highlight genetic interactions between the DDR and Ink4a-Arf pathways in suppression of oncogene-driven tumorigenesis and metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Although the mechanisms underlying the spatial pattern formation of sensory maps have been extensively investigated, those triggering sensory map formation during development are largely unknown. Here we show that the birth of pups instructively and selectively regulates the initiation of barrel formation in the somatosensory cortex by reducing serotonin concentration. We found that preterm birth accelerated barrel formation, whereas it did not affect either barreloid formation or barrel structural plasticity. We also found that serotonin was selectively reduced soon after birth and that the reduction of serotonin was triggered by birth. The reduction of serotonin was necessary and sufficient for the effect of birth on barrel formation. Interestingly, the regulatory mechanisms described here were also found to regulate eye-specific segregation in the visual system, suggesting that they are utilized in various brain regions. Our results shed light on roles of birth and serotonin in sensory map formation.

Abstract: Summary
Many fundamental aspects of DNA replication, such as the exact locations where DNA synthesis is initiated and terminated, how frequently origins are used, and how fork progression is influenced by transcription, are poorly understood. Via the deep sequencing of Okazaki fragments, we comprehensively document replication fork directionality throughout the S. cerevisiae genome, which permits the systematic analysis of initiation, origin efficiency, fork progression, and termination. We show that leading-strand initiation preferentially occurs within a nucleosome-free region at replication origins. Using a strain in which late origins can be induced to fire early, we show that replication termination is a largely passive phenomenon that does not rely on cis-acting sequences or replication fork pausing. The replication profile is predominantly determined by the kinetics of origin firing, allowing us to reconstruct chromosome-wide timing profiles from an asynchronous culture.

Abstract: S100A8 and S100A9 (S100A8/A9) are low-molecular weight members of the S100 family of calcium-binding proteins. Recent studies have reported S100A8/A9 promote tumorigenesis. We have previously reported that S100A8/A9 is mostly expressed in stromal cells and inflammatory cells between gastric tumor cells. However, the role of environmental S100A8/A9 in gastric cancer has not been defined. We observed in the present study the effect of S100A8/A9 on migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells. S100A8/ A9 treatment increased migration and invasionat lower concentrations that did not affect cell proliferation and cell viability. S100A8/A9 caused activation of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-κΒ (NF-KB). The phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was not affected by the NF-KB inhibitor Bay whereas activation of NF-KB was blocked by p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580, indicating that S100A8/A9-induced NF-KB activation is mediated by phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. S100A8/A9-induced cell migration and invasion was inhibited by SB203580 and Bay, suggesting that activation of p38 MAPK and NF-KB is involved in the S100A8/A9 induced cell migration and invasion. S100A8/A9 caused an increase in matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) and MMP12 expression, which were inhibited by SB203580 and Bay. S100A8/A9-induced cell migration and invasion was inhibited by MMP2 siRNA and MMP12 siRNA, indicating that MMP2 and MMP12 is related to the S100A8/A9 induced cell migration and invasion. Taken together, these results suggest that S100A8/A9 promotes cell migration and invasion through p38 MAPK-dependent NF-KB activation leading to an increase of MMP2 and MMP12 in gastric cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The CRISPR-Cas system is a prokaryotic host defense system against genetic elements. The Type III-B CRISPR-Cas system of the bacterium Thermus thermophilus, the TtCmr complex, is composed of six different protein subunits (Cmr1-6) and one crRNA with a stoichiometry of Cmr112131445361:crRNA1. The TtCmr complex copurifies with crRNA species of 40 and 46 nt, originating from a distinct subset of CRISPR loci and spacers. The TtCmr complex cleaves the target RNA at multiple sites with 6 nt intervals via a 5′ ruler mechanism. Electron microscopy revealed that the structure of TtCmr resembles a “sea worm” and is composed of a Cmr2-3 heterodimer “tail,” a helical backbone of Cmr4 subunits capped by Cmr5 subunits, and a curled “head” containing Cmr1 and Cmr6. Despite having a backbone of only four Cmr4 subunits and being both longer and narrower, the overall architecture of TtCmr resembles that of Type I Cascade complexes.

Abstract: Background
Sorting nexins are a large family of proteins that are associated with various components of the endosome system and they play many roles in processes such as endocytosis, intracellular protein trafficking and cell signaling. The subcellular distribution patterns of many of them remain controversial and their in vivo functions have not been characterized yet.
Results
We investigated the subcellular distribution and function of SNX16 in this study. SNX16 is detected on Rab5-positive endosomes localized adjacent to focal adhesions at cell cortex. Inhibition of SNX23, polymerization of microtubule filaments as well as the PI3-kinase all disrupt the cell cortex distribution of SNX16. Ectopic expression of SNX16 reduces the migration and the tumor formation activity of MCF-7 cells.
Conclusion
Our results indicate that, in addition to the PI3P, there is a SNX23- and microtubule-dependent cargo transport pathway required for the proper subcellular distribution of SNX16. SNX16 plays a negative regulatory role during cell migration and tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Summary
An outstanding question in protein sorting is why polarized epithelial cells express two isoforms of the μ1 subunit of the AP-1 clathrin adaptor complex: the ubiquitous μ1A and the epithelial-specific μ1B. Previous studies led to the notion that μ1A and μ1B mediate basolateral sorting predominantly from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and recycling endosomes, respectively. Using improved analytical tools, however, we find that μ1A and μ1B largely colocalize with each other. They also colocalize to similar extents with TGN and recycling endosome markers, as well as with basolateral cargoes transiting biosynthetic and endocytic-recycling routes. Instead, the two isoforms differ in their signal-recognition specificity. In particular, μ1B preferentially binds a subset of signals from cargoes that are sorted basolaterally in a μ1B-dependent manner. We conclude that expression of distinct μ1 isoforms in epithelial cells expands the repertoire of signals recognized by AP-1 for sorting of a broader range of cargoes to the basolateral surface.

Abstract: Summary
Tank-binding kinase I (TBK1) plays a key role in the innate immune system by integrating signals from pattern-recognition receptors. Here, we report the X-ray crystal structures of inhibitor-bound inactive and active TBK1 determined to 2.6 Å and 4.0 Å resolution, respectively. The structures reveal a compact dimer made up of trimodular subunits containing an N-terminal kinase domain (KD), a ubiquitin-like domain (ULD), and an α-helical scaffold dimerization domain (SDD). Activation rearranges the KD into an active conformation while maintaining the overall dimer conformation. Low-resolution SAXS studies reveal that the missing C-terminal domain (CTD) extends away from the main body of the kinase dimer. Mutants that interfere with TBK1 dimerization show significantly reduced trans-autophosphorylation but retain the ability to bind adaptor proteins through the CTD. Our results provide detailed insights into the architecture of TBK1 and the molecular mechanism of activation.

Abstract: Summary
In mammals, calcium influx is required for oocyte maturation and egg activation. The molecular identities of the calcium-permeant channels that underlie the initiation of embryonic development are not established. Here, we describe a transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel current activated by TRP agonists that is absent in TrpV3−/− eggs. TRPV3 current is differentially expressed during oocyte maturation, reaching a peak of maximum density and activity at metaphase of meiosis II (MII), the stage of fertilization. Selective activation of TRPV3 channels provokes egg activation by mediating massive calcium entry. Widely used to activate eggs, strontium application is known to yield normal offspring in combination with somatic cell nuclear transfer. We show that TRPV3 is required for strontium influx, because TrpV3−/− eggs failed to conduct Sr2+ or undergo strontium-induced activation. We propose that TRPV3 is a major mediator of calcium influx in mouse eggs and is a putative target for artificial egg activation.

Abstract: Summary
G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are typically present in a basal, inactive state but, when bound to an agonist, activate downstream signaling cascades. In studying arrestin regulation of opioid receptors in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons, we find that agonists of delta opioid receptors (δORs) activate cofilin through Rho-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase (ROCK), LIM domain kinase (LIMK), and β-arrestin 1 (β-arr1) to regulate actin polymerization. This controls receptor function, as assessed by agonist-induced inhibition of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels in DRGs. Agonists of opioid-receptor-like receptors (ORL1) similarly influence the function of this receptor through ROCK, LIMK, and β-arr1. Functional evidence of this cascade was demonstrated in vivo, where the behavioral effects of δOR or ORL1 agonists were enhanced in the absence of β-arr1 or prevented by inhibiting ROCK. This pathway allows δOR and ORL1 agonists to rapidly regulate receptor function.

Abstract: Summary
VEGFA signaling is critical for endothelial and hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) specification. However, blood defects resulting from perturbation of the VEGFA pathway are always accompanied by impaired vascular/arterial development. Because HSCs derive from arterial cells, it is unclear whether VEGFA directly contributes to HSC specification. This is an important question for our understanding of how HSCs are formed and for developing their production in vitro. Through knockdown of the regulator ETO2 in embryogenesis, we report a specific decrease in expression of medium/long Vegfa isoforms in somites. This leads to absence of Notch1 expression and failure of HSC specification in the dorsal aorta (DA), independently of vessel formation and arterial specification. Vegfa hypomorphs and isoform-specific (medium/long) morphants not only recapitulate this phenotype but also demonstrate that VEGFA short isoform is sufficient for DA development. Therefore, sequential, isoform-specific VEGFA signaling successively induces the endothelial, arterial, and HSC programs in the DA.

Abstract: Lipid rafts are related to cell surface receptor function. Integrin is a major surface receptor protein in cell adhesion and migration on the extracellular matrix (ECM). Here, we showed that lipid rafts played a critical role in human melanoma A375 cell spreading and migration on fibronectin; an important component of the ECM that interacts with β1 integrin. We found that the disruption of lipid rafts did not markedly inhibit the expression and activation of β1 integrin. By coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we investigated the influence of lipid rafts on the β1 integrin complex and identified nucleolin as a potential lipid-raft-dependent β1-integrin-interacting protein. Upon confirmation of the interaction between β1 integrin and nucleolin, further studies revealed that nucleolin colocalized with β1 integrin in lipid rafts and raft disruption interrupted their association. In addition, knockdown of nucleolin markedly attenuated A375 cell spreading and migration on fibronectin. Taken together, we demonstrated that nucleolin is a critical lipid-raft-dependent β1-integrin-interacting protein in A375 cell spreading and migration on fibronectin.

Abstract: We investigated the relationship between oct4 gene expression patterns and CpG sites methylation profiles during ES cell differentiation into neurons, and identified relevant binding factor. The oct4 gene expression level gradually declined as ES cell differentiation progressed, and the CpG sites in the oct4 proximal enhancer (PE) and promoter regions were methylated in concert with ES cell differentiation. An electro-mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that putative proteins bind to CpG sites in the oct4 PE/ promoter. We purified CpG binding proteins with DNA- binding purification method, and NonO was identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. EMSA with specific competitors revealed that NonO specifically binds to the conserved CCGGTGAC sequence in the oct4 promoter. Methylation at a specific cytosine residue (CC* GGTGAC) reduced the binding affinity of NonO for the recognition sequence. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that NonO binds to the unmethylated oct4 promoter. There were no changes in the NonO mRNA and protein levels between ES cells and differentiated cells. The transcriptional role of NonO in oct4 gene expression was evaluated by luciferase assays and knockdown experiments. The luciferase activity significantly increased threefold when the NonO expression vector was cotransfected with the NonO recognition sequence, indicating that NonO has a transcription activator effect on oct4 gene expression. In accordance with this effect, when NonO expression was inhibited by siRNA treatment, oct4 expression was also significantly reduced. In summary, we purified NonO, a novel protein that binds to the CpG island of oct4 promoter, and positively regulates oct4 gene expression in ES cells.

Abstract: Summary
The frog Xenopus can normally regenerate its limbs at early developmental stages but loses the ability during metamorphosis. This behavior provides a potential gain-of-function model for measures that can enhance limb regeneration. Here, we show that frog limbs can be caused to form multidigit regenerates after receiving transplants of larval limb progenitor cells. It is necessary to activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the cells and to add Sonic hedgehog, FGF10, and thymosin β4. These factors promote survival and growth of the grafted cells and also provide pattern information. The eventual regenerates are not composed solely of donor tissue; the host cells also make a substantial contribution despite their lack of regeneration competence. Cells from adult frog legs or from regenerating tadpole tails do not promote limb regeneration, demonstrating the necessity for limb progenitor cells. These findings have obvious implications for the development of a technology to promote limb regeneration in mammals.

Abstract: Summary
Early-onset prostate cancer (EO-PCA) represents the earliest clinical manifestation of prostate cancer. To compare the genomic alteration landscapes of EO-PCA with “classical” (elderly-onset) PCA, we performed deep sequencing-based genomics analyses in 11 tumors diagnosed at young age, and pursued comparative assessments with seven elderly-onset PCA genomes. Remarkable age-related differences in structural rearrangement (SR) formation became evident, suggesting distinct disease pathomechanisms. Whereas EO-PCAs harbored a prevalence of balanced SRs, with a specific abundance of androgen-regulated ETS gene fusions including TMPRSS2:ERG, elderly-onset PCAs displayed primarily non-androgen-associated SRs. Data from a validation cohort of > 10,000 patients showed age-dependent androgen receptor levels and a prevalence of SRs affecting androgen-regulated genes, further substantiating the activity of a characteristic “androgen-type” pathomechanism in EO-PCA.

Abstract: Summary
Sox2 is a transcription factor required for the maintenance of pluripotency. It also plays an essential role in different types of multipotent stem cells, raising the possibility that Sox2 governs the common stemness phenotype. Here we show that Sox2 is a critical downstream target of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling, which mediates self-renewal of trophoblast stem cells (TSCs). Sustained expression of Sox2 together with Esrrb or Tfap2c can replace FGF dependency. By comparing genome-wide binding sites of Sox2 in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and TSCs combined with inducible knockout systems, we found that, despite the common role in safeguarding the stem cell state, Sox2 regulates distinct sets of genes with unique functions in these two different yet developmentally related types of stem cells. Our findings provide insights into the functional versatility of transcription factors during embryogenesis, during which they can be recursively utilized in a variable manner within discrete network structures.

Abstract: Neural epidermal growth factor-like protein-like 2 (NELL2) is a secreted glycoprotein that is predominantly expressed in the nervous system, but little is known about the intracellular movement and secretion mechanism of this protein. By monitoring the localization and movements of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-labeled NELL2 in living cultured hippocampal neuroprogenitor HiB5 cells, we determined the subcellular localization of NELL2 and its intracellular movement and secretion mechanism. Cterminal EGFP-fused NELL2 showed a typical expression pattern of secreted proteins, especially with respect to its localization in the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and punctate structures. Vesicles containing NELL2 exhibited bidirectional movement in HiB5 cells. The majority of the vesicles (70.1%) moved in an anterograde direction with an average velocity of 0.454 µm/s, whereas some vesicles (28.7%) showed retrograde movement with an average velocity of 0.302 µm/s. The movement patterns of NELL2 vesicles were dependent upon the presence of microtubules in HiB5 cells. Anterograde movement of NELL2 did not lead to a detectable accumulation of NELL2 in the peripheral region of the cell, indicating that it was secreted into the culture medium. We also showed that the N-terminal 29 amino acids of NELL2 were important for secretion of this protein. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the N-terminal region of NELL2 determines both the pattern of its intracellular expression and transport of NELL2 vesicles by high-velocity movement. Therefore, NELL2 may affect the cellular activity of cells in a paracrine or autocrine manner.

Abstract: Summary
Splicing and translation are highly regulated steps of gene expression. Altered expression of proteins involved in these processes can be deleterious. Therefore, the cell has many safeguards against such misregulation. We report that the oncogenic splicing factor SRSF1, which is overexpressed in many cancers, stabilizes the tumor suppressor protein p53 by abrogating its MDM2-dependent proteasomal degradation. We show that SRSF1 is a necessary component of an MDM2/ribosomal protein complex, separate from the ribosome, that functions in a p53-dependent ribosomal-stress checkpoint pathway. Consistent with the stabilization of p53, increased SRSF1 expression in primary human fibroblasts decreases cellular proliferation and ultimately triggers oncogene-induced senescence (OIS). These findings underscore the deleterious outcome of SRSF1 overexpression and identify a cellular defense mechanism against its aberrant function. Furthermore, they implicate the RPL5-MDM2 complex in OIS and demonstrate a link between spliceosomal and ribosomal components, functioning independently of their canonical roles, to monitor cellular physiology and cell-cycle progression.

Abstract: Summary
We created a site-directed UAS-ORF library of 655 growth-regulating genes in Drosophila. This library represents a large collection of genes regulating cell cycle, cell size, and proliferation and will be a valuable resource for studying growth regulation in vivo. By using misexpression of genes, we prevent problems arising from genetic redundancy and can uncover novel gene functions. To validate the usefulness of this library, we screened for Wingless (Wg) pathway components. We used a combination of experimental and bioinformatic approaches to predict candidates and identified three serine/threonine kinases as regulators of Wg signaling. We show that one of these, Nek2, optimizes pathway response by direct phosphorylation of Dishevelled. In addition, we describe functional relations for roughly 5% of all Drosophila genes and identify a large number of genes that regulate cell size, proliferation, and final organ size upon misexpression.

Abstract: Summary
Transitions between pluripotent and differentiated states are marked by dramatic epigenetic changes. Cellular differentiation is tightly linked to X chromosome inactivation (XCI), whereas reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is associated with X chromosome reactivation (XCR). XCR reverses the silent state of the inactive X, occurring in mouse blastocysts and germ cells. In spite of its importance, little is known about underlying mechanisms. Here, we examine the role of the long noncoding Tsix RNA and the germline factor, PRDM14. In blastocysts, XCR is perturbed by mutation of either Tsix or Prdm14. In iPSCs, XCR is disrupted only by PRDM14 deficiency, which also affects iPSC derivation and maintenance. We show that Tsix and PRDM14 directly link XCR to pluripotency: first, PRDM14 represses Rnf12 by recruiting polycomb repressive complex 2; second, Tsix enables PRDM14 to bind Xist. Thus, our study provides functional and mechanistic links between cellular and X chromosome reprogramming.

Abstract: Acteoside, an active phenylethanoid glycoside, has been used traditionally as an anti-inflammatory agent. The molecular mechanism by which acteoside reduces inflammation was investigated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced Raw264.7 cells and in a mouse model of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis. In vitro, acteoside inhibits high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) release and iNOS/NO production and induces heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression in a concentration-dependent manner, while HO-1 siRNA antagonizes the inhibition of HMGB1 and NO. The effect of acteoside is inhibited by the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor SB203580 and Nfr2 siRNA, indicating that acteoside induces HO-1 via p38 MAPK and NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). In vivo, acteoside increases survival and decreases serum and lung HMGB1 levels in CLP-induced sepsis. Overall, these results that acteoside reduces HMGB1 release and may be beneficial for the treatment of sepsis.

Abstract: Summary
Stress-mediated programmed cell death (PCD) in bacteria has recently attracted attention, largely because it raises novel possibilities for controlling pathogens. How PCD in bacteria is regulated to avoid population extinction due to transient, moderate stress remains a central question. Here, we report that the YihE protein kinase is a key regulator that protects Escherichia coli from antimicrobial and environmental stressors by antagonizing the MazEF toxin-antitoxin module. YihE was linked to a reactive oxygen species (ROS) cascade, and a deficiency of yihE stimulated stress-induced PCD even after stress dissipated. YihE was partially regulated by the Cpx envelope stress-response system, which, along with MazF toxin and superoxide, has both protective and destructive roles that help bacteria make a live-or-die decision in response to stress. YihE probably acts early in the stress response to limit self-sustaining ROS production and PCD. Inhibition of YihE may provide a way of enhancing antimicrobial lethality and attenuating virulence.

Here, we show that Id1 expression induces a stem-like phenotype in breast cancer cells while retaining epithelial properties, contrary to the notion that cancer stem-like properties are inextricably linked to the mesenchymal state. During metastatic colonization, Id1 induces a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), specifically in cells whose mesenchymal state is dependent on the Id1 target protein Twist1, but not at the primary site, where this state is controlled by the zinc finger protein Snail1. Knockdown of Id expression in metastasizing cells prevents MET and dramatically reduces lung colonization. Furthermore, Id1 is induced by transforming growth factor (TGF)-β only in cells that have first undergone epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), demonstrating that EMT is a prerequisite for subsequent Id1-induced MET during lung colonization. Collectively, these studies underscore the importance of Id-mediated phenotypic switching during distinct stages of breast cancer metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Animals have body parts made of similar cell types located at different axial positions, such as limbs. The identity and distinct morphology of each structure is often specified by the activity of different “master regulator” transcription factors. Although similarities in gene expression have been observed between body parts made of similar cell types, how regulatory information in the genome is differentially utilized to create morphologically diverse structures in development is not known. Here, we use genome-wide open chromatin profiling to show that among the Drosophila appendages, the same DNA regulatory modules are accessible throughout the genome at a given stage of development, except at the loci encoding the master regulators themselves. In addition, open chromatin profiles change over developmental time, and these changes are coordinated between different appendages. We propose that master regulators create morphologically distinct structures by differentially influencing the function of the same set of DNA regulatory modules.

Abstract: CaSR and TGFβ are robust promoters of differentiation in the colonic epithelium. Loss of cellular responses to TGFβ or loss of CaSR expression is tightly linked to malignant progression. Human colonic epithelial CBS cells, originally developed from a differentiated human colon tumor, retain CaSR expression and function, TGFβ responsiveness and TGFβ receptor expression. Thus, these cells offer a unique opportunity in determining the functional linkage (if any) between CaSR and TGFβ. Knocking down CaSR expression abrogated TGFβ-mediated cellular responses and attenuated the expression of TGFβ receptors. Ca2+ or vitamin D treatment induced CaSR expression with a concurrent up-regulation of TGFβ receptor expression. Ca2+ or vitamin D, however, did not induce CaSR in CaSR knocked down cells and without CaSR; there was no up-regulation of TGFβ receptor. It is concluded that TGFβ receptor expression and TGFβ mediated responses requires CaSR expression and function.
Keywords: CaSR; TGFβ receptors; TGFβ response

Abstract: Summary
Inefficient T cell migration is a major limitation of cancer immunotherapy. Targeted activation of the tumor microenvironment may overcome this barrier. We demonstrate that neoadjuvant local low-dose gamma irradiation (LDI) causes normalization of aberrant vasculature and efficient recruitment of tumor-specific T cells in human pancreatic carcinomas and T-cell-mediated tumor rejection and prolonged survival in otherwise immune refractory spontaneous and xenotransplant mouse tumor models. LDI (local or pre-adoptive-transfer) programs the differentiation of iNOS+ M1 macrophages that orchestrate CTL recruitment into and killing within solid tumors through iNOS by inducing endothelial activation and the expression of TH1 chemokines and by suppressing the production of angiogenic, immunosuppressive, and tumor growth factors.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear accumulation of β-catenin, a widely recognized marker of poor cancer prognosis, drives cancer cell proliferation and senescence bypass and regulates incretins, critical regulators of fat and glucose metabolism. Diabetes, characterized by elevated blood glucose levels, is associated with increased cancer risk, partly because of increased insulin growth factor 1 signaling, but whether elevated glucose directly impacts cancer-associated signal-transduction pathways is unknown. Here, we show that high glucose is essential for nuclear localization of β-catenin in response to Wnt signaling. Glucose-dependent β-catenin nuclear retention requires lysine 354 and is mediated by alteration of the balance between p300 and sirtuins that trigger β-catenin acetylation. Consequently β-catenin accumulates in the nucleus and activates target promoters under combined glucose and Wnt stimulation, but not with either stimulus alone. Our results reveal a mechanism by which high glucose enhances signaling through the cancer-associated Wnt/β-catenin pathway and may explain the increased frequency of cancer associated with obesity and diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
A large body of evidence indicates that chronic inflammation is one of several key risk factors for cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis. However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for the contribution of inflammation and inflammatory mediators to cancer remain elusive. Here, we present genetic evidence that loss of CXCR2 dramatically suppresses chronic colonic inflammation and colitis-associated tumorigenesis through inhibiting infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) into colonic mucosa and tumors in a mouse model of colitis-associated cancer. CXCR2 ligands were elevated in inflamed colonic mucosa and tumors and induced MDSC chemotaxis. Adoptive transfer of wild-type MDSCs into Cxcr2−/− mice restored AOM/DSS-induced tumor progression. MDSCs accelerated tumor growth by inhibiting CD8+ T cell cytotoxic activity.

Abstract: Summary
While allosteric activation of AMPK is triggered only by AMP, binding of both ADP and AMP has been reported to promote phosphorylation and inhibit dephosphorylation at Thr172. Because cellular concentrations of ADP and ATP are higher than AMP, it has been proposed that ADP is the physiological signal that promotes phosphorylation and that allosteric activation is not significant in vivo. However, we report that: AMP is 10-fold more potent than ADP in inhibiting Thr172 dephosphorylation; only AMP enhances LKB1-induced Thr172 phosphorylation; and AMP can cause >10-fold allosteric activation even at concentrations 1–2 orders of magnitude lower than ATP. We also provide evidence that allosteric activation by AMP can cause increased phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase in intact cells under conditions in which there is no change in Thr172 phosphorylation. Thus, AMP is a true physiological regulator of AMPK, and allosteric regulation is an important component of the overall activation mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
The mitochondrial disulfide relay system of Mia40 and Erv1/ALR facilitates import of the small translocase of the inner membrane (Tim) proteins and cysteine-rich proteins. A chemical screen identified small molecules that inhibit Erv1 oxidase activity, thereby facilitating dissection of the disulfide relay system in yeast and vertebrate mitochondria. One molecule, mitochondrial protein import blockers from the Carla Koehler laboratory (MitoBloCK-6), attenuated the import of Erv1 substrates into yeast mitochondria and inhibited oxidation of Tim13 and Cmc1 in in vitro reconstitution assays. In addition, MitoBloCK-6 revealed an unexpected role for Erv1 in the carrier import pathway, namely transferring substrates from the translocase of the outer membrane complex onto the small Tim complexes. Cardiac development was impaired in MitoBloCK-6-exposed zebrafish embryos. Finally, MitoBloCK-6 induced apoptosis via cytochrome c release in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) but not in differentiated cells, suggesting an important role for ALR in hESC homeostasis.

Abstract: Primary cilium has emerged as mechanosensor to subtle flow variations in epithelial cells, but its role in shear stress detection remains controversial. To probe the function of this non-motile organelle in shear stress detection by cells, we compared calcium signalling responses induced by shear stress in ciliated and unciliated MDCK cells. Cytosolic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) was measured using Fura-PE3 video imaging fluorescence microscopy in response to shear stress due to laminar flow (385μls−1). Our results show that both unciliated and ciliated MDCK cells are shear stress sensitive via ATP release and autocrine feedback through purinergic receptors. However, purinergic calcium signals differed in response intensity and receptor subtypes. In unciliated cells, shear stress-induced elevation in [Ca2+]i was predominantly mediated through P2X receptors (P2XR). In contrast, calcium mobilization in ciliated MDCK cells resulted from P2YRs and store-operated Ca2+-permeable channels besides P2XRs. These findings lend support to the hypothesis that ATP release in response to shear stress is independent of the primary cilium and that transduction of mechanical strain into a specific biochemical responses stems on the mobilization of different sets of purinergic receptors.

Abstract: Summary
Homology-dependent repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) from nonsister templates has the potential to generate loss of heterozygosity or genome rearrangements. Here we show that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mph1 helicase prevents crossovers between ectopic sequences by removing substrates for Mus81-Mms4 or Rad1-Rad10 cleavage. A role for Yen1 is only apparent in the absence of Mus81. Cells lacking Mph1 and the three nucleases are highly defective in the repair of a single DSB, suggesting that the recombination intermediates that accumulate cannot be processed by the Sgs1-Top3-Rmi1 complex (STR). Consistent with this hypothesis, ectopic joint molecules (JMs) accumulate transiently in the mph1Δ mutant and persistently when Mus81 is eliminated. Furthermore, the ectopic JMs formed in the mus81Δ mutant contain a single Holliday junction (HJ) explaining why STR is unable to process them. We suggest that Mph1 and Mus81-Mms4 recognize an early strand exchange intermediate and direct repair to noncrossover or crossover outcomes, respectively.

Abstract: Summary
Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) convert adenosine to inosine, which is then recognized as guanosine. To study the role of ADAR proteins in RNA editing and gene regulation, we sequenced and compared the DNA and RNA of human B cells. Then, we followed up the findings experimentally with siRNA knockdown and RNA and protein immunoprecipitations. The results uncovered over 60,000 A-to-G editing sites and several thousand genes whose expression levels are influenced by ADARs. Of these ADAR targets, 90% were identified. Our results also reveal that ADAR regulates transcript stability and gene expression through interaction with HuR (ELAVL1). These findings extend the role of ADAR and show that it cooperates with other RNA-processing proteins to regulate the sequence and expression of transcripts in human cells.

Abstract: Effect of starvation and refeeding on the structure of pyloric caeca was studied in the juveniles of Caspian Sea salmon. Juveniles (average body weight 12±0.1g) were subjected to four levels of feeding: full-fed for 6 weeks (FFF), 3 weeks fed and 3 weeks following starvation (FS), 3 weeks starved and 3 weeks fed (SF), and full-starved (SSS) for 6 weeks. Light microscopic studies showed significant reduction (p<0.05) in the enterocytes height and number, villus length, epithelial area and pyloric caeca total area in starved groups as compared to control group. These reductions were more significant (p<0.05) in long term starved group (SSS) than short term starved group (FS). Additionally, refeeding increased pyloric caeca size and enterocyte's number in SF group whereas, the epithelial total area and villus length did not reach the same area and length as control group. Results indicated that in Caspian Sea salmon juveniles food deprivation and consuming of food source, adversely affected the tissue of pyloric caeca while refeeding can be effective on healing tissue damage.

Abstract: Summary
X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is a dynamically regulated developmental process with inactivation and reactivation accompanying the loss and gain of pluripotency, respectively. A functional relationship between pluripotency and lack of XCI has been suggested, whereby pluripotency transcription factors repress the master regulator of XCI, the noncoding transcript Xist, by binding to its first intron (intron 1). To test this model, we have generated intron 1 mutant embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and two independent mouse models. We found that Xist’s repression in ESCs, its transcriptional upregulation upon differentiation, and its silencing upon reprogramming to pluripotency are not dependent on intron 1. Although we observed subtle effects of intron 1 deletion on the randomness of XCI and in the absence of the antisense transcript Tsix in differentiating ESCs, these have little relevance in vivo because mutant mice do not deviate from Mendelian ratios of allele transmission. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that intron 1 is dispensable for the developmental dynamics of Xist expression.

Abstract: Summary
Cue1p is an integral component of yeast endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) ubiquitin ligase (E3) complexes. It tethers the ERAD ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), Ubc7p, to the ER and prevents its degradation, and also activates Ubc7p via unknown mechanisms. We have now determined the crystal structure of the Ubc7p-binding region (U7BR) of Cue1p with Ubc7p. The U7BR is a unique E2-binding domain that includes three α-helices that interact extensively with the “backside” of Ubc7p. Residues essential for E2 binding are also required for activation of Ubc7p and for ERAD. We establish that the U7BR stimulates both RING-independent and RING-dependent ubiquitin transfer from Ubc7p. Moreover, the U7BR enhances ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1)-mediated charging of Ubc7p with ubiquitin. This demonstrates that an essential component of E3 complexes can simultaneously bind to E2 and enhance its loading with ubiquitin. These findings provide mechanistic insights into how ubiquitination can be stimulated.

Abstract: Summary
We isolated a tumor B-cell-targeting antibody, BI-505, from a highly diversified human phage-antibody library, using a pioneering “function-first” approach involving screening for (1) specificity for a tumor B cell surface receptor, (2) induction of tumor programmed cell death, and (3) enhanced in vivo antitumor activity compared to currently used treatments. BI-505 bound to intercellular adhesion molecule-1, identifying a previously unrecognized role for this receptor as a therapeutic target in cancer. The BI-505 epitope was strongly expressed on the surface of multiple myeloma cells from both newly diagnosed and relapsed patients. BI-505 had potent macrophage-dependent antimyeloma activity and conferred enhanced survival compared to currently used treatments in advanced experimental models of multiple myeloma.

Abstract: Summary
MazF is an mRNA interferase, which, upon activation during stress conditions, cleaves mRNAs in a sequence-specific manner, resulting in cellular growth arrest. During normal growth conditions, the MazF toxin is inactivated through binding to its cognate antitoxin, MazE. How MazF specifically recognizes its mRNA target and carries out cleavage and how the formation of the MazE-MazF complex inactivates MazF remain unclear. We present crystal structures of MazF in complex with mRNA substrate and antitoxin MazE in Bacillus subtilis. The structure of MazF in complex with uncleavable UUdUACAUAA RNA substrate defines the molecular basis underlying the sequence-specific recognition of UACAU and the role of residues involved in the cleavage through site-specific mutational studies. The structure of the heterohexameric (MazF)2-(MazE)2-(MazF)2 complex in Bacillus subtilis, supplemented by mutational data, demonstrates that the positioning of the C-terminal helical segment of MazE within the RNA-binding channel of the MazF dimer prevents mRNA binding and cleavage by MazF.

Abstract: Summary
Natural immunoglobulin M (IgM) is reactive to autoantigens and is believed to be important for autoimmunity. Blood pentameric IgM loaded with antigens forms a large immune complex (IC) that contains various elements, including apoptosis inhibitor of macrophage (AIM). Here we demonstrate that this IgM-AIM association contributes to autoantibody production under obese conditions. In mice fed a high-fat diet, natural IgM increased through B cell TLR4 stimulation. AIM associated with IgM and protected AIM from renal excretion, increasing blood AIM levels along with the obesity-induced IgM augmentation. Meanwhile, the AIM association inhibited IgM binding to the Fcα/μ receptor on splenic follicular dendritic cells, thereby protecting the IgM IC from Fcα/μ receptor-mediated internalization. This supported IgM-dependent autoantigen presentation to B cells, stimulating IgG autoantibody production. Accordingly, in obese AIM-deficient (AIM−/−) mice, the increase of multiple IgG autoantibodies observed in obese wild-type mice was abrogated. Thus, the AIM-IgM association plays a critical role in the obesity-associated autoimmune process.

Abstract: Summary
In vivo UV crosslinking identified numerous preribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) binding sites for the large, highly conserved ribosome synthesis factor Rrp5. Intramolecular complementation has shown that the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Rrp5 is required for pre-rRNA cleavage at sites A0–A2 on the pathway of 18S rRNA synthesis, whereas the N-terminal domain (NTD) is required for A3 cleavage on the pathway of 5.8S/25S rRNA synthesis. The CTD was crosslinked to sequences flanking A2 and to the snoRNAs U3, U14, snR30, and snR10, which are required for cleavage at A0–A2. The NTD was crosslinked to sequences flanking A3 and to the RNA component of ribonuclease MRP, which cleaves site A3. Rrp5 could also be directly crosslinked to several large structural proteins and nucleoside triphosphatases. A key role in coordinating preribosomal assembly and processing was confirmed by chromatin spreads. Following depletion of Rrp5, cotranscriptional cleavage was lost and preribosome compaction greatly reduced.

Abstract: Summary
Transcriptional effectors of white adipocyte-selective gene expression have not been described. Here we show that TLE3 is a white-selective cofactor that acts reciprocally with the brown-selective cofactor Prdm16 to specify lipid storage and thermogenic gene programs. Occupancy of TLE3 and Prdm16 on certain promoters is mutually exclusive, due to the ability of TLE3 to disrupt the physical interaction between Prdm16 and PPARγ. When expressed at elevated levels in brown fat, TLE3 counters Prdm16, suppressing brown-selective genes and inducing white-selective genes, resulting in impaired fatty acid oxidation and thermogenesis. Conversely, mice lacking TLE3 in adipose tissue show enhanced thermogenesis in inguinal white adipose depots and are protected from age-dependent deterioration of brown adipose tissue function. Our results suggest that the establishment of distinct adipocyte phenotypes with different capacities for thermogenesis and lipid storage is accomplished in part through the cell-type-selective recruitment of TLE3 or Prdm16 to key adipocyte target genes.

Abstract: Summary
Elevated bile acid levels increase hepatocellular carcinoma by unknown mechanisms. Here, we show that mice with a severe defect in bile acid homeostasis due to the loss of the nuclear receptors FXR and SHP have enlarged livers, progenitor cell proliferation, and Yes-associated protein (YAP) activation and develop spontaneous liver tumorigenesis. This phenotype mirrors mice with loss of hippo kinases or overexpression of their downstream target, YAP. Bile acids act as upstream regulators of YAP via a pathway dependent on the induction of the scaffold protein IQGAP1. Patients with diverse biliary dysfunctions exhibit enhanced IQGAP1 and nuclear YAP expression.

Abstract: Summary
Presenilin 1 (PS1) is the catalytic core of γ-secretase, which cleaves type 1 transmembrane proteins, including the amyloid precursor protein (APP). PS1 also has γ-secretase-independent functions, and dominant PS1 missense mutations are the most common cause of familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD). Whether PS1 FAD mutations are gain- or loss-of-function remains controversial, primarily because most studies have relied on overexpression in mouse and/or nonneuronal systems. We used isogenic euploid human induced pluripotent stem cell lines to generate and study an allelic series of PS1 mutations, including heterozygous null mutations and homozygous and heterozygous FAD PS1 mutations. Rigorous analysis of this allelic series in differentiated, purified neurons allowed us to resolve this controversy and to conclude that FAD PS1 mutations, expressed at normal levels in the appropriate cell type, impair γ-secretase activity but do not disrupt γ-secretase-independent functions of PS1. Thus, FAD PS1 mutations do not act as simple loss of PS1 function but instead dominantly gain an activity toxic to some, but not all, PS1 functions.

Abstract: Summary
Notch1 is a rational therapeutic target in several human cancers, but as a transcriptional regulator, it poses a drug discovery challenge. To identify Notch1 modulators, we performed two cell-based, high-throughput screens for small-molecule inhibitors and cDNA enhancers of a NOTCH1 allele bearing a leukemia-associated mutation. Sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) channels emerged at the intersection of these complementary screens. SERCA inhibition preferentially impairs the maturation and activity of mutated Notch1 receptors and induces a G0/G1 arrest in NOTCH1-mutated human leukemia cells. A small-molecule SERCA inhibitor has on-target activity in two mouse models of human leukemia and interferes with Notch signaling in Drosophila. These studies “credential” SERCA as a therapeutic target in cancers associated with NOTCH1 mutations.

Abstract: Summary
Initiation of motile cell behavior in embryonic development occurs during late blastula stages when gastrulation begins. At this stage, the strong adhesion of blastomeres has to be modulated to enable dynamic behavior, similar to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions. We show that, in zebrafish maternal and zygotic (MZ)spg embryos mutant for the stem cell transcription factor Pou5f1/Oct4, which are severely delayed in the epiboly gastrulation movement, all blastomeres are defective in E-cadherin (E-cad) endosomal trafficking, and E-cad accumulates at the plasma membrane. We find that Pou5f1-dependent control of EGF expression regulates endosomal E-cad trafficking. EGF receptor may act via modulation of p120 activity. Loss of E-cad dynamics reduces cohesion of cells in reaggregation assays. Quantitative analysis of cell behavior indicates that dynamic E-cad endosomal trafficking is required for epiboly cell movements. We hypothesize that dynamic control of E-cad trafficking is essential to effectively generate new adhesion sites when cells move relative to each other.

Abstract: Summary
Mitofusins, conserved dynamin-related GTPases in the mitochondrial outer membrane, mediate the fusion of mitochondria. Here, we demonstrate that the activity of the mitofusin Fzo1 is regulated by sequential ubiquitylation at conserved lysine residues and by the deubiquitylases Ubp2 and Ubp12. Ubp2 and Ubp12 recognize distinct ubiquitin chains on Fzo1 that have opposing effects on mitochondrial fusion. Ubp2 removes ubiquitin chains that initiate proteolysis of Fzo1 and inhibit fusion. Ubp12 recognizes ubiquitin chains that stabilize Fzo1 and promote mitochondrial fusion. Self-assembly of dynamin-related GTPases is critical for their function. Ubp12 deubiquitylates Fzo1 only after oligomerization. Moreover, ubiquitylation at one monomer activates ubiquitin chain formation on another monomer. Thus, regulation of mitochondrial fusion involves ubiquitylation of mitofusin at distinct lysine residues, intermolecular crosstalk between mitofusin monomers, and two deubiquitylases that act as regulatory and quality control enzymes.

Abstract: Summary
Sound perception relies on the planar polarization of the mechanosensory hair cell apex, which develops a V-shaped stereocilia bundle pointing toward an eccentric kinocilium. It remains unknown how intrinsically asymmetric bundles arise and are concomitantly oriented in the tissue. We report here that mInsc, LGN, and Gαi proteins, which classically regulate mitotic spindle orientation, are polarized in a lateral microvilli-free region, or “bare zone,” at the apical hair cell surface. By creating and extending the bare zone, these proteins trigger a relocalization of the eccentric kinocilium midway toward the cell center. aPKC is restrained medially by mInsc/LGN/Gαi, resulting in compartmentalization of the apical surface that imparts the V-shaped distribution of stereocilia and brings the asymmetric bundle in register with the relocalized kinocilium. Gαi is additionally required for lateral orientation of cochlear hair cells, providing a possible mechanism to couple the emergence of asymmetric stereocilia bundles with planar cell polarity.
