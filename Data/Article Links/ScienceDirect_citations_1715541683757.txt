Abstract: Summary
Despite the histological similarity of ependymomas from throughout the neuroaxis, the disease likely comprises multiple independent entities, each with a distinct molecular pathogenesis. Transcriptional profiling of two large independent cohorts of ependymoma reveals the existence of two demographically, transcriptionally, genetically, and clinically distinct groups of posterior fossa (PF) ependymomas. Group A patients are younger, have laterally located tumors with a balanced genome, and are much more likely to exhibit recurrence, metastasis at recurrence, and death compared with Group B patients. Identification and optimization of immunohistochemical (IHC) markers for PF ependymoma subgroups allowed validation of our findings on a third independent cohort, using a human ependymoma tissue microarray, and provides a tool for prospective prognostication and stratification of PF ependymoma patients.

Abstract: Summary
Although mature myocytes rely on mitochondria as the primary source of energy, the role of mitochondria in the developing heart is not well known. Here, we find that closure of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) drives maturation of mitochondrial structure and function and myocyte differentiation. Cardiomyocytes at embryonic day (E) 9.5, when compared to E13.5, displayed fragmented mitochondria with few cristae, a less-polarized mitochondrial membrane potential, higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and an open mPTP. Pharmacologic and genetic closing of the mPTP yielded maturation of mitochondrial structure and function, lowered ROS, and increased myocyte differentiation (measured by counting Z bands). Furthermore, myocyte differentiation was inhibited and enhanced with oxidant and antioxidant treatment, respectively, suggesting that redox-signaling pathways lie downstream of mitochondria to regulate cardiac myocyte differentiation.

Abstract: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with human cancers such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Burkitt’s lymphoma, Hodgkin’s disease, and gastric carcinoma (GC). EBV is associated with about 10% of all GC cases globally. EBV-associated GC has distinct features from EBV-negative GC. However, it is still unclear if EBV infection has any effect on GC chemoresistance. Cell proliferation assay, cell cycle analysis, and active caspase Western blot revealed that the EBV-positive GC cell line (AGS-EBV) showed chemoresistance to docetaxel compared to the EBV-negative GC cell line (AGS). Docetaxel treatment increased expression of Bax similarly in AGS and AGS-EBV cell lines. However, Bcl-2 induction was markedly higher in AGS-EBV cells, after docetaxel treatment. Although docetaxel increased the expression of p53 to a similar extent in both cell lines, induction of p21 in AGS-EBV cells was lower than in AGS cells. Furthermore, expression of survivin was higher in AGS-EBV cells than in AGS cells following docetaxel treatment as well as at basal state. EBV-lytic gene expression was induced by docetaxel treatment in AGS-EBV cells. The results suggest that EBV infection and lytic induction confers chemoresistance to GC, possibly by regulating cellular and EBV latent and lytic gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
Hsp90 is an essential molecular chaperone required for the folding and activation of many hundreds of cellular “client” proteins. The ATP-dependent chaperone cycle involves significant conformational rearrangements of the Hsp90 dimer and interaction with a network of cochaperone proteins. Little is known about the mechanism of client protein binding or how cochaperone interactions modulate Hsp90 conformational states. We have determined the cryo-EM structure of the human Hsp90:Hop complex that receives client proteins from the Hsp70 chaperone. Hop stabilizes an alternate Hsp90 open state, where hydrophobic client-binding surfaces have converged and the N-terminal domains have rotated and match the closed, ATP conformation. Hsp90 is thus simultaneously poised for client loading by Hsp70 and subsequent N-terminal dimerization and ATP hydrolysis. Upon binding of a single Hsp70, the Hsp90:Hop conformation remains essentially unchanged. These results identify distinct functions for the Hop cochaperone, revealing an asymmetric mechanism for Hsp90 regulation and client loading.

Abstract: Summary
A hallmark of anamniote vertebrate development is a window of embryonic transcription-independent cell divisions before onset of zygotic genome activation (ZGA). Chromatin determinants of ZGA are unexplored; however, marking of developmental genes by modified histones in sperm suggests a predictive role of histone marks for ZGA. In zebrafish, pre-ZGA development for ten cell cycles provides an opportunity to examine whether genomic enrichment in modified histones is present before initiation of transcription. By profiling histone H3 trimethylation on all zebrafish promoters before and after ZGA, we demonstrate here an epigenetic prepatterning of developmental gene expression. This involves pre-ZGA marking of transcriptionally inactive genes involved in homeostatic and developmental regulation by permissive H3K4me3 with or without repressive H3K9me3 or H3K27me3. Our data suggest that histone modifications are instructive for the developmental gene expression program.

Abstract: Summary
Preparation of DNA templates for replication requires opening of the duplex to expose single-stranded (ss) DNA. The locally melted DNA is required for replicative DNA helicases to initiate unwinding. How local melting is generated in eukaryotic replicons is unknown, but initiator proteins from a handful of eukaryotic viruses can perform this function. Here we dissect the local melting process carried out by the papillomavirus E1 protein. We characterize the melting process kinetically and identify mutations in the E1 helicase and in the ori that arrest the local melting process. We show that a subset of these mutants have specific defects for melting of the center of the ori containing the binding sites for E1 and demonstrate that these mutants fail to untwist the ori DNA. This understanding of how E1 generates local melting suggests possible mechanisms for local melting in other replicons.

Abstract: Summary
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is important for organ development, metastasis, cancer stemness, and organ fibrosis. Molecular mechanisms to coordinately regulate hypoxia-induced EMT remain elusive. Here, we show that HIF-1α-induced histone deacetylase 3 (hdac3) is essential for hypoxia-induced EMT and metastatic phenotypes. Change of specific chromatin states is associated with hypoxia-induced EMT. Under hypoxia, HDAC3 interacts with hypoxia-induced WDR5, recruits the histone methyltransferase (HMT) complex to increase histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4)-specific HMT activity, and activates mesenchymal gene expression. HDAC3 also serves as an essential corepressor to repress epithelial gene expression. Knockdown of WDR5 abolishes mesenchymal gene activation but not epithelial gene repression during hypoxia. These results indicate that hypoxia induces different chromatin modifiers to coordinately regulate EMT through distinct mechanisms.

Abstract: Reversible conjugation of the small ubiquitin modifier (SUMO) peptide to proteins (SUMOylation) plays important roles in cellular processes in animals and yeasts. However, little is known about plant SUMO targets. To identify SUMO substrates in Arabidopsis and to probe for biological functions of SUMO proteins, we constructed 6xHis-3xFLAG fused AtSUMO1 (HFAtSUMO1) controlled by the CaMV35S promoter for transformation into Arabidopsis Col-0. After heat treatment, an increased sumoylation pattern was detected in the transgenic plants. SUMO1-modified proteins were selected after two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) image analysis and identified using matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). We identified 27 proteins involved in a variety of processes such as nucleic acid metabolism, signaling, metabolism, and including proteins of unknown functions. Binding and sumoylation patterns were confirmed independently. Surprisingly, MCM3 (At5G46280), a DNA replication licensing factor, only interacted with and became sumoylated by AtSUMO1, but not by SUMO1ΔGG or AtSUMO3. The results suggest specific interactions between sumoylation targets and particular sumoylation enzymes.

Abstract: Summary
NLRP12 is a member of the intracellular Nod-like receptor (NLR) family that has been suggested to downregulate the production of inflammatory cytokines, but its physiological role in regulating inflammation has not been characterized. We analyzed mice deficient in Nlrp12 to study its role in inflammatory diseases such as colitis and colorectal tumorigenesis. We show that Nlrp12-deficient mice are highly susceptible to colon inflammation and tumorigenesis, which is associated with increased production of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and tumorigenic factors. Enhanced colon inflammation and colorectal tumor development in Nlrp12-deficient mice are due to a failure to dampen NF-κB and ERK activation in macrophages. These results reveal a critical role for NLRP12 in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and providing protection against colorectal tumorigenesis.

White to Brown Fat Phenotypic Switch Induced by Genetic and Environmental Activation of a Hypothalamic-Adipocyte Axis,

Abstract: Summary
Living in an enriched environment with complex physical and social stimulation leads to improved cognitive and metabolic health. In white fat, enrichment induced the upregulation of the brown fat cell fate determining gene Prdm16, brown fat-specific markers, and genes involved in thermogenesis and β-adrenergic signaling. Moreover, pockets of cells with prototypical brown fat morphology and high UCP1 levels were observed in the white fat of enriched mice associated with resistance to diet-induced obesity. Hypothalamic overexpression of BDNF reproduced the enrichment-associated activation of the brown fat gene program and lean phenotype. Inhibition of BDNF signaling by genetic knockout or dominant-negative trkB reversed this phenotype. Our genetic and pharmacologic data suggest a mechanism whereby induction of hypothalamic BDNF expression in response to environmental stimuli leads to selective sympathoneural modulation of white fat to induce “browning” and increased energy dissipation.

Abstract: Summary
Mural cells (pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells) provide trophic and structural support to blood vessels. Vascular smooth muscle cells alternate between a synthetic/proliferative state and a differentiated/contractile state, but the dynamic states of pericytes are poorly understood. To explore the cues that regulate mural cell differentiation and homeostasis, we have generated conditional knockin mice with activating mutations at the PDGFRβ locus. We show that increased PDGFRβ signaling drives cell proliferation and downregulates differentiation genes in aortic vascular smooth muscle. Increased PDGFRβ signaling also induces a battery of immune response genes in pericytes and mesenchymal cells and inhibits differentiation of white adipocytes. Mural cells are emerging as multipotent progenitors of pathophysiological importance, and we identify PDGFRβ signaling as an important in vivo regulator of their progenitor potential.

Abstract: Summary
Regulatory conflicts occur when two signals that individually trigger opposite cellular responses are present simultaneously. Here, we investigate regulatory conflicts in the bacterial response to antibiotic combinations. We use an Escherichia coli promoter-GFP library to study the transcriptional response of many promoters to either additive or antagonistic drug pairs at fine two-dimensional (2D) resolution of drug concentration. Surprisingly, we find that this data set can be characterized as a linear sum of only two principal components. Component one, accounting for over 70% of the response, represents the response to growth inhibition by the drugs. Component two describes how regulatory conflicts are resolved. For the additive drug pair, conflicts are resolved by linearly interpolating the single drug responses, while for the antagonistic drug pair, the growth-limiting drug dominates the response. Importantly, for a given drug pair, the same conflict resolution strategy applies to almost all genes. These results provide a recipe for predicting gene expression responses to antibiotic combinations.

Abstract: Summary
Repo-Man targets protein phosphatase 1 γ (PP1γ) to chromatin at anaphase onset and regulates chromosome structure during mitotic exit. Here, we show that a Repo-Man:PP1 complex forms in anaphase following dephosphorylation of Repo-Man. Upon activation, the complex localizes to chromosomes and causes the dephosphorylation of histone H3 (Thr3, Ser10, and Ser28). In anaphase, Repo-Man has both catalytic and structural functions that are mediated by two separate domains. A C-terminal domain localizes Repo-Man to bulk chromatin in early anaphase. There, it targets PP1 for the dephosphorylation of histone H3 and possibly other chromosomal substrates. An N-terminal domain localizes Repo-Man to the chromosome periphery later in anaphase. There, it is responsible for the recruitment of nuclear components such as Importin β and Nup153 in a PP1-independent manner. These observations identify Repo-Man as a key factor that coordinates chromatin remodeling and early events of nuclear envelope reformation during mitotic exit.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic stress results in p53 activation, which can trigger cell-cycle arrest, ROS clearance, or apoptosis. However, what determines the p53-mediated cell fate decision upon metabolic stress is not very well understood. We show here that PGC-1α binds to p53 and modulates its transactivation function, resulting in preferential transactivation of proarrest and metabolic target genes. Thus glucose starvation results in p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest and ROS clearance, but abrogation of PGC-1α expression results in extensive apoptosis. Additionally, prolonged starvation results in PGC-1α degradation concomitant with induction of apoptosis. We have also identified RNF2, a Polycomb group (PcG) protein, as the cognate E3 ubiquitin ligase. Starvation of mice where PGC-1α expression is abrogated results in loss of p53-mediated ROS clearance, enhanced p53-dependent apoptosis, and consequent severe liver atrophy. These findings provide key insights into the role of PGC-1α in regulating p53-mediated cell fate decisions in response to metabolic stress.

Abstract: Methionine and choline-deficient diet (MCD)-induced fatty liver is one of the best-studied animal models of fatty liver disease. The present study was performed to clarify the relative contributions of individual lipid metabolic pathways to the pathogenesis of MCD-induced fatty liver. Hepatic lipogenesis mediated by the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP-1c) was increased at 1 week, but not at 6 weeks, of MCD feeding. On the other hand, 14C-palmitate oxidation did not change at 1 week, but significantly decreased at 6 weeks. This decrease was associated with increased expression of fatty acid translocase, a key enzyme involved in fatty acid uptake. Expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress markers was increased in mice given MCD for both 1 and 6 weeks. These findings suggest the presence of time-dependent differences in lipid metabolism in MCD-induced fatty liver disease: SREBP-1c-mediated lipogenesis is important in the early stages of fatty liver disease, whereas increased fatty acid uptake and decreased fatty acid oxidation become more important in the later stages.

Abstract: Sperm of Armadillidium peraccae have been examined with cytochemical and immunocytochemical methods for fluorescence and electron microscopic visualization of cytoskeleton components. Sperm incubation in an antibody anti-β-tubulin shows only the presence of two centrioles located in the cytoplasmic region above the nucleus; no other microtubules are present in the sperm head. Instead, fluorescence microscopy of sperm incubated in FITC-phalloidin allowed to detect the presence of a large amount of F-actin in the apical region of the sperm head. The incubation of ultrathin sections of sperm embedded in Lowicryl K4M with a phalloidin–gold complex allowed a more precise localization of F-actin in the amorphous part of the acrosome and in the cytoplasmic region between acrosome and nucleus; F-actin is also present in the thin cytoplasmic layer between plasma membrane and nuclear envelope at the apical portion of the nucleus. Although the sperm was always found completely devoid of motility, the discovery of the presence of an actin cytoskeleton leads us to hypothesize a possible acquisition of motility by the sperm at the time of its interaction with the female gamete. Such a hypothesis is supported by what is known for ostracods whose aflagellate sperm implement a type of amoeboid movement only at the time of their interaction with the female gamete.

Abstract: In the field of quantitative microscopy, textural information plays a significant role very often in tissue characterization and diagnosis, in addition to morphology and intensity. The aim of this work is to improve the classification accuracy based on textural features for the development of a computer assisted screening of oral sub-mucous fibrosis (OSF). In fact, a systematic approach is introduced in order to grade the histopathological tissue sections into normal, OSF without dysplasia and OSF with dysplasia, which would help the oral onco-pathologists to screen the subjects rapidly. In totality, 71 textural features are extracted from epithelial region of the tissue sections using various wavelet families, Gabor-wavelet, local binary pattern, fractal dimension and Brownian motion curve, followed by preprocessing and segmentation. Wavelet families contribute a common set of 9 features, out of which 8 are significant and other 61 out of 62 obtained from the rest of the extractors are also statistically significant (p<0.05) in discriminating the three stages. Based on mean distance criteria, the best wavelet family (i.e., biorthogonal3.1 (bior3.1)) is selected for classifier design. support vector machine (SVM) is trained by 146 samples based on 69 textural features and its classification accuracy is computed for each of the combinations of wavelet family and rest of the extractors. Finally, it has been investigated that bior3.1 wavelet coefficients leads to higher accuracy (88.38%) in combination with LBP and Gabor wavelet features through three-fold cross validation. Results are shown and discussed in detail. It is shown that combining more than one texture measure instead of using just one might improve the overall accuracy.

Abstract: Summary
Clinical and genomic evidence suggests that the metastatic potential of a primary tumor may be dictated by prometastatic events that have additional oncogenic capability. To test this “deterministic” hypothesis, we adopted a comparative oncogenomics-guided function-based strategy involving: (1) comparison of global transcriptomes of two genetically engineered mouse models with contrasting metastatic potential, (2) genomic and transcriptomic profiles of human melanoma, (3) functional genetic screen for enhancers of cell invasion, and (4) evidence of expression selection in human melanoma tissues. This integrated effort identified six genes that are potently proinvasive and oncogenic. Furthermore, we show that one such gene, ACP5, confers spontaneous metastasis in vivo, engages a key pathway governing metastasis, and is prognostic in human primary melanomas.

Abstract: Summary
In obesity, anorectic responses to leptin are diminished, giving rise to the concept of “leptin resistance.” Increased expression of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) has been associated with the attenuation of leptin signaling and development of cellular leptin resistance. Here we report that hypothalamic levels of the tyrosine phosphatase TCPTP are also elevated in obesity to attenuate the leptin response. We show that mice that lack TCPTP in neuronal cells have enhanced leptin sensitivity and are resistant to high-fat-diet-induced weight gain and the development of leptin resistance. Also, intracerebroventricular administration of a TCPTP inhibitor enhances leptin signaling and responses in mice. Moreover, the combined deletion of TCPTP and PTP1B in neuronal cells has additive effects in the prevention of diet-induced obesity. Our results identify TCPTP as a critical negative regulator of hypothalamic leptin signaling and causally link elevated TCPTP to the development of cellular leptin resistance in obesity.

Abstract: Summary
Iron-dependent degradation of iron-regulatory protein 2 (IRP2) is a key event for maintenance of an appropriate intracellular concentration of iron. Although FBXL5 (F box and leucine-rich repeat protein 5) is thought to mediate this degradation, the role of FBXL5 in the control of iron homeostasis in vivo has been poorly understood. We have now found that mice deficient in FBXL5 died in utero, associated with excessive iron accumulation. This embryonic mortality was prevented by additional ablation of IRP2, suggesting that impaired IRP2 degradation is primarily responsible for the death of Fbxl5−/− mice. We also found that liver-specific deletion of Fbxl5 resulted in deregulation of both hepatic and systemic iron homeostasis, leading to the development of steatohepatitis. The liver-specific mutant mice died with acute liver failure when fed a high-iron diet. Thus, our results uncover a major role for FBXL5 in ensuring an appropriate supply of iron to cells.

Abstract: Summary
Mesenchymal condensation is critical for organogenesis, yet little is known about how this process is controlled. Here we show that Fgf8 and Sema3f, produced by early dental epithelium, respectively, attract and repulse mesenchymal cells, which cause them to pack tightly together during mouse tooth development. Resulting mechanical compaction-induced changes in cell shape induce odontogenic transcription factors (Pax9, Msx1) and a chemical cue (BMP4), and mechanical compression of mesenchyme is sufficient to induce tooth-specific cell fate switching. The inductive effects of cell compaction are mediated by suppression of the mechanical signaling molecule RhoA, and its overexpression prevents odontogenic induction. Thus, the mesenchymal condensation that drives tooth formation is induced by antagonistic epithelial morphogens that manifest their pattern-generating actions mechanically via changes in mesenchymal cell shape and altered mechanotransduction.

Abstract: Summary
Yeast prions are self-perpetuating, QN-rich amyloids that control heritable traits and serve as a model for mammalian amyloidoses. De novo prion formation by overproduced prion protein is facilitated by other aggregated QN-rich protein(s) and is influenced by alterations of protein homeostasis. Here we explore the mechanism by which the Las17-binding protein Lsb2 (Pin3) promotes conversion of the translation termination factor Sup35 into its prion form, [PSI+]. We show that Lsb2 localizes with some Sup35 aggregates and that Lsb2 is a short-lived protein whose levels are controlled via the ubiquitin-proteasome system and are dramatically increased by stress. Loss of Lsb2 decreases stability of [PSI+] after brief heat shock. Mutations interfering with Lsb2 ubiquitination increase prion induction, while a mutation eliminating association of Lsb2 with the actin cytoskeleton blocks its aggregation and prion-inducing ability. These findings directly implicate the UPS and actin cytoskeleton in regulating prions via a stress-inducible QN-rich protein.

Abstract: Summary
Dysregulation of Wnt signaling has been implicated in tumorigenesis. The role of Transducin β-like proteins TBL1-TBLR1 in the promotion of Wnt/β-catenin-mediated oncogenesis has recently been emphasized; however, the molecular basis of activation of Wnt signaling by the corepressor TBL1-TBLR1 is incompletely understood. Here, we show that both TBL1 and TBLR1 are SUMOylated in a Wnt signaling-dependent manner, and that this modification is selectively reversed by SUMO-specific protease I (SENP1). SUMOylation dismissed TBL1-TBLR1 from the nuclear hormone receptor corepressor (NCoR) complex, increased recruitment of the TBL1-TBLR1-β-catenin complex to the promoter of Wnt target genes, and consequently led to activation of Wnt signaling. Conversely, SENP1 decreased formation of the TBL1-TBLR1-β-catenin complex, leading to inhibition of β-catenin-mediated transcription. Importantly, inhibition of SUMOylation significantly decreased the tumorigenicity of SW480 colon cancer cells. Thus, our data reveal a mechanism for activation of Wnt signaling via the SUMOylation-dependent disassembly of the corepressor complex.

Abstract: Summary
To prevent ATR activation, telomeres deploy the single-stranded DNA binding activity of TPP1/POT1a. POT1a blocks the binding of RPA to telomeres, suggesting that ATR is repressed through RPA exclusion. However, comparison of the DNA binding affinities and abundance of TPP1/POT1a and RPA indicates that TPP1/POT1a by itself is unlikely to exclude RPA. We therefore analyzed the central shelterin protein TIN2, which links TPP1/POT1a (and POT1b) to TRF1 and TRF2 on the double-stranded telomeric DNA. Upon TIN2 deletion, telomeres lost TPP1/POT1a, accumulated RPA, elicited an ATR signal, and showed all other phenotypes of POT1a/b deletion. TIN2 also affected the TRF2-dependent repression of ATM kinase signaling but not to TRF2-mediated inhibition of telomere fusions. Thus, while TIN2 has a minor contribution to the repression of ATM by TRF2, its major role is to stabilize TPP1/POT1a on the ss telomeric DNA, thereby allowing effective exclusion of RPA and repression of ATR signaling.

Abstract: A proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL), a new TNF family member, supports B-cell survival and tumor cell proliferation. APRIL is secreted as a soluble protein by macrophages, dendritic cells and activated T cells. However, factors involved in regulation of APRIL expression are as yet unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect of TGF-β1 on APRIL expression in P388D1, a mouse macrophage cell line. TGF-β1 induced APRIL mRNA expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner. One nanogram per milliliter of TGF-β1 was optimal and APRIL transcripts appeared as early as 3 h after stimulation. Based on our studies, which included overexpression of Smad3, DN-Smad3, and sh-Smad3, we found that Smad3 mediates APRIL transcription at least partially. Further, experiments using inhibitors revealed that p38MAPK and CREB are also involved in TGF-β1-induced APRIL expression. These results suggest that TGF-β1, through Smad3 and p38MAPK/ CREB signaling pathways, stimulates APRIL expression in macrophages.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy, the primary recycling pathway of cells, plays a critical role in mitochondrial quality control under normal growth conditions and in the response to cellular stress. The Hsp90-Cdc37 chaperone complex coordinately regulates the activity of select kinases to orchestrate many facets of the stress response. Although both maintain mitochondrial integrity, the relationship between Hsp90-Cdc37 and autophagy has not been well characterized. Ulk1, one of the mammalian homologs of yeast Atg1, is a serine-threonine kinase required for mitophagy. Here we show that the interaction between Ulk1 and Hsp90-Cdc37 stabilizes and activates Ulk1, which in turn is required for the phosphorylation and release of Atg13 from Ulk1, and for the recruitment of Atg13 to damaged mitochondria. Hsp90-Cdc37, Ulk1, and Atg13 phosphorylation are all required for efficient mitochondrial clearance. These findings establish a direct pathway that integrates Ulk1- and Atg13-directed mitophagy with the stress response coordinated by Hsp90 and Cdc37.

Abstract: Summary
The translation, localization, and degradation of cytoplasmic mRNAs are controlled by the formation and rearrangement of their mRNPs. The conserved Ded1/DDX3 DEAD-box protein functions in an unknown manner to affect both translation initiation and repression. We demonstrate that Ded1 first functions by directly interacting with eIF4G to assemble a Ded1-mRNA-eIF4F complex, which accumulates in stress granules. After ATP hydrolysis by Ded1, the mRNP exits stress granules and completes translation initiation. Thus, Ded1 functions both as a repressor of translation, by assembling an mRNP stalled in translation initiation, and as an ATP-dependent activator of translation, by resolving the stalled mRNP. These results identify Ded1 as a translation initiation factor that assembles and remodels an intermediate complex in translation initiation.

Abstract: Posttranslational modifications play key roles in many cellular processes including proliferation and differentiation by modulating the activities of target proteins. PIAS1, a member of PIAS family of protein, mediates the modification of protein by SUMO and thereby regulates the function of its interacting protein partners. Here we report that PIAS1 negatively regulates ubiquitination of Msx1 homeoprotein, a regulator of myogenic differentiation, in a SUMOindependent manner. We demonstrate that ubiquitination and SUMOylation of Msx1 are not mutually exclusive but require the same C-terminal PIAS1 interaction domain. In addition, deletion of C-terminal domain increases the steadystate protein level of Msx1, while mutations of SUMO acceptor sites have no significant effect on the stability of Msx1 proteins. Moreover, we find that forced expression of PIAS1 inhibits ubiquitination and thereby increases the stability of Msx1 protein regardless of its activity as a SUMO ligase. Furthermore, repressor activity of Msx1 in transcription is strengthened in the presence of PIAS1. Taken together, our studies uncover a new function of PIAS1, which is to control the stability of its interacting protein partner in a SUMO independent manner.

Abstract: Simvastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, has been known to reduce cholesterol biosynthesis. However, recent studies demonstrate that simvastatin shows diverse cholesterolindependent functions including cellular differentiation. In this study, we investigated the stimulatory effect of simvastatin on the osteogenic differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). The osteogenic effect of simvastatin was observed at relatively low doses (ranging from 1 nM to 200 nM). Incubation of ESCs in simvastatin-supplemented osteogenic medium significantly increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity at day 7. The matrix mineralization was also augmented and demonstrated pivotal levels after 14 days incubation of simvastatin. Osteogenic differentiation of ESCs by simvastatin was determined by upregulation of the mRNA expression of runt-related gene 2 (Runx2), osterix (OSX), and osteocalcin (OCN) as osteogenic transcription factors. Moreover, the increased protein expression of OCN, osteopontin (OPN), and collagen type I (Coll I) was assessed using Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry. However, the blockage of canonical Wnt signaling by DKK-1 downregulated simvastatin-induced ALP activity and the mRNA expression of each osteogenic transcription factor. Furthermore, the β-catenin specific siRNA transfection decreased the protein levels of OCN, OPN, and Coll I. Collectively, these findings suggest that simvastatin enhances the differentiation of ESCs toward osteogenic lineage through activation of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Using a mouse model of ependymoma—a chemoresistant brain tumor—we combined multicell high-throughput screening (HTS), kinome-wide binding assays, and in vivo efficacy studies, to identify potential treatments with predicted toxicity against neural stem cells (NSC). We identified kinases within the insulin signaling pathway and centrosome cycle as regulators of ependymoma cell proliferation, and their corresponding inhibitors as potential therapies. FDA approved drugs not currently used to treat ependymoma were also identified that posses selective toxicity against ependymoma cells relative to normal NSCs both in vitro and in vivo, e.g., 5-fluorouracil. Our comprehensive approach advances understanding of the biology and treatment of ependymoma including the discovery of several treatment leads for immediate clinical translation.

Abstract: Summary
Hyperactivation of the PI 3-kinase/AKT pathway is a driving force of many cancers. Here we identify the AKT-inactivating phosphatase PHLPP1 as a prostate tumor suppressor. We show that Phlpp1-loss causes neoplasia and, on partial Pten-loss, carcinoma in mouse prostate. This genetic setting initially triggers a growth suppressive response via p53 and the Phlpp2 ortholog, and reveals spontaneous Trp53 inactivation as a condition for full-blown disease. Surprisingly, the codeletion of PTEN and PHLPP1 in patient samples is highly restricted to metastatic disease and tightly correlated to deletion of TP53 and PHLPP2. These data establish a conceptual framework for progression of PTEN mutant prostate cancer to life-threatening disease.

Abstract: In atrial myocytes, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) has an essential role in regulating the force of contraction as a consequence of its involvement in excitation–contraction coupling (ECC). Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) is a Ca2+ mobilizing messenger that acts to release Ca2+ from an acidic store in mammalian cells. The photorelease of NAADP in atrial myocytes increased Ca2+ transient amplitude with no effect on accompanying action potentials or the L-type Ca2+ current. NAADP-AM, a cell permeant form of NAADP, increased Ca2+ spark amplitude and frequency. The effect on Ca2+ spark frequency could be prevented by bafilomycin A1, a vacuolar H+-ATPase inhibitor, or by disruption of lysosomes by GPN. Bafilomycin prevented staining of acidic stores with LysoTracker red by increasing lysosomal pH. NAADP-AM also produced an increase in the lysosomal pH, as detected by a reduction in LysoSensor green fluorescence. These effects of NAADP were associated with an increase in the amount of caffeine-releasable Ca2+ in the SR and may be regulated by β-adrenoceptor stimulation with isoprenaline. These observations are consistent with a role for NAADP in regulating ECC in atrial myocytes by releasing Ca2+ from an acidic store, which enhances SR Ca2+ release by increasing SR load.

Abstract: Summary
To identify FDA-approved agents targeting leukemic cells, we performed a chemical screen on two human leukemic cell lines and identified the antimicrobial tigecycline. A genome-wide screen in yeast identified mitochondrial translation inhibition as the mechanism of tigecycline-mediated lethality. Tigecycline selectively killed leukemia stem and progenitor cells compared to their normal counterparts and also showed antileukemic activity in mouse models of human leukemia. ShRNA-mediated knockdown of EF-Tu mitochondrial translation factor in leukemic cells reproduced the antileukemia activity of tigecycline. These effects were derivative of mitochondrial biogenesis that, together with an increased basal oxygen consumption, proved to be enhanced in AML versus normal hematopoietic cells and were also important for their difference in tigecycline sensitivity.

Abstract: Summary
It is often presumed that, in vivo, the initiation of RNA synthesis by DNA-dependent RNA polymerases occurs using NTPs alone. Here, using the model Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we demonstrate that depletion of the small-RNA-specific exonuclease, Oligoribonuclease, causes the accumulation of oligoribonucleotides 2 to ∼4 nt in length, “nanoRNAs,” which serve as primers for transcription initiation at a significant fraction of promoters. Widespread use of nanoRNAs to prime transcription initiation is coupled with global alterations in gene expression. Our results, obtained under conditions in which the concentration of nanoRNAs is artificially elevated, establish that small RNAs can be used to initiate transcription in vivo, challenging the idea that all cellular transcription occurs using only NTPs. Our findings further suggest that nanoRNAs could represent a distinct class of functional small RNAs that can affect gene expression through direct incorporation into a target RNA transcript rather than through a traditional antisense-based mechanism.

Abstract: Resveratrol is a plant phenolic phytoalexin that has been reported to have antitumor properties in several types of cancers. In particular, several studies have suggested that resveratrol exerts antiproliferative effects against A549 human non-small cell lung cancer cells; however, its mechanism of action remains incompletely understood. Deregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small, noncoding, regulatory RNA molecules involved in gene expression, is strongly correlated with lung cancer. In this study, we demonstrated that resveratrol treatment altered miRNA expression in A549 cells. Using microarray analysis, we identified 71 miRNAs exhibiting greater than 2-fold expression changes in resveratrol-treated cells relative to their expression levels in untreated cells. Furthermore, we identified target genes related to apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, cell proliferation, and differentiation using a miRNA target-prediction program. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that resveratrol induces considerable changes in the miRNA expression profiles of A549 cells, suggesting a novel approach for studying the anticancer mechanisms of resveratrol.

Abstract: Summary
Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a conserved RNA decay pathway that degrades aberrant mRNAs and directly regulates many normal mRNAs. This dual role for NMD raises the possibility that its magnitude is buffered to prevent the potentially catastrophic alterations in gene expression that would otherwise occur if NMD were perturbed by environmental or genetic insults. In support of this, here we report the existence of a negative feedback regulatory network that directly acts on seven NMD factors. Feedback regulation is conferred by different branches of the NMD pathway in a cell type-specific and developmentally regulated manner. We identify feedback-regulated NMD factors that are rate limiting for NMD and demonstrate that reversal of feedback regulation in response to NMD perturbation is crucial for maintaining NMD. Together, our results suggest the existence of an intricate feedback network that maintains both RNA surveillance and the homeostasis of normal gene expression in mammalian cells.

Abstract: Summary
Cordon-Bleu is, like Spire, a member of the growing family of WH2 repeat proteins, which emerge as versatile regulators of actin dynamics. They are expressed in morphogenetic and patterning processes and nucleate actin assembly in vitro. Here, we show that Cordon-Bleu works as a dynamizer of actin assembly by combining many properties of profilin with weak filament nucleating and powerful filament severing activities and sequestration of ADP-actin, which altogether generate oscillatory polymerization kinetics. A short lysine-rich sequence, N-terminally adjacent to the three WH2 domains, is required for nucleation and severing. In this context, nucleation requires only one WH2 domain, but filament severing requires two adjacent WH2 domains. A model integrating the multiple activities of Cordon-Bleu and quantitatively fitting the multiphasic polymerization curves is derived. Hence, with similar structural organization of WH2 repeats, Cordon-Bleu and Spire display different functions by selecting different sets of the multifunctional properties of WH2 domains.

Abstract: Summary
We demonstrate that RING finger protein MSL2 in the MOF-MSL complex is a histone ubiquitin E3 ligase. MSL2, together with MSL1, has robust histone ubiquitylation activity that mainly targets nucleosomal H2B on lysine 34 (H2B K34ub), a site within a conserved basic patch on H2B tail. H2B K34ub by MSL1/2 directly regulates H3 K4 and K79 methylation through trans-tail crosstalk both in vitro and in cells. The significance of MSL1/2-mediated histone H2B ubiquitylation is underscored by the facts that MSL1/2 activity is important for transcription activation at HOXA9 and MEIS1 loci and that this activity is evolutionarily conserved in the Drosophila dosage compensation complex. Altogether, these results indicate that the MOF-MSL complex possesses two distinct chromatin-modifying activities (i.e., H4 K16 acetylation and H2B K34 ubiquitylation) through MOF and MSL2 subunits. They also shed light on how an intricate network of chromatin-modifying enzymes functions coordinately in gene activation.

Abstract: Summary
Loss-of-function mutations affecting one or both copies of the Ten-Eleven-translocation (TET)2 gene have been described in various human myeloid malignancies. We report that inactivation of Tet2 in mouse perturbs both early and late steps of hematopoiesis including myeloid and lymphoid differentiation in a cell-autonomous manner, endows the cells with competitive advantage, and eventually leads to the development of malignancies. We subsequently observed TET2 mutations in human lymphoid disorders. TET2 mutations could be detected in immature progenitors endowed with myeloid colony-forming potential. Our results show that the mutations present in lymphoid tumor cells may occur at both early and later steps of lymphoid development and indicate that impairment of TET2 function or/and expression predisposes to the development of hematological malignancies.

Abstract: Compound ITH33/IQM9.21 (ITH/IQM) belongs to a new family of l-glutamic acid derivatives with antioxidant and neuroprotective properties on in vitro and in vivo models of stroke. Because neuronal damage after brain ischemia is tightly linked to excess Ca2+ entry and neuronal Ca2+ overload, we have investigated whether compound ITH/IQM antagonises the elevations of the cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]c) and the ensuing exocytotic responses triggered by depolarisation of bovine chromaffin cells. In fluo-4-loaded cell populations, ITH/IQM reduced the K+-evoked [Ca2+]c transients with an IC50 of 5.31μM. At 10μM, the compound decreased the amplitude and area of the Ca2+ transient elicited by challenging single fura-2-loaded cells with high K+, by 40% and 80%, respectively. This concentration also caused a blockade of K+-induced catecholamine release at the single-cell level (78%) and cell populations (55%). These effects are likely due to blockade of the whole-cell inward Ca2+ currents (IC50=6.52μM). At 10μM, ITH/IQM also inhibited the Ca2+-dependent outward K+ current, leaving untouched the voltage-dependent component of IK. The inward Na+ current was unaffected. Inhibition of depolarisation-elicited Ca2+ entry, [Ca2+]c elevation and exocytosis could contribute to the neuroprotective effects of ITH/IQM in vulnerable neurons undergoing depolarisation during brain ischemia.

Abstract: Summary
Angiogenesis is regulated by the balance of proangiogenic VEGF165 and antiangiogenic VEGF165b splice isoforms. Mutations in WT1, the Wilms' tumor suppressor gene, suppress VEGF165b and cause abnormal gonadogenesis, renal failure, and Wilms' tumors. In WT1 mutant cells, reduced VEGF165b was due to lack of WT1-mediated transcriptional repression of the splicing-factor kinase SRPK1. WT1 bound to the SRPK1 promoter, and repressed expression through a specific WT1 binding site. In WT1 mutant cells SRPK1-mediated hyperphosphorylation of the oncogenic RNA binding protein SRSF1 regulated splicing of VEGF and rendered WT1 mutant cells proangiogenic. Altered VEGF splicing was reversed by wild-type WT1, knockdown of SRSF1, or SRPK1 and inhibition of SRPK1, which prevented in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis and associated tumor growth.

Abstract: Primary lens epithelial cell (LEC) cultures derived from newborn (P0) and one-month-old (P30) mouse lenses were used to study GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) signaling expression and its effect on the intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) level. We have found that these cultures express specific cellular markers for lens epithelial and fiber cells, all components of the functional GABA signaling pathway and GABA, thus recapitulating the developmental program of the ocular lens. Activation of both GABA-A and GABA-B receptors (GABAAR and GABABR) with the specific agonists muscimol and baclofen, respectively induces [Ca2+]i transients that could be blocked by the specific antagonists bicuculline and CGP55845 and were dependent on extracellular Ca2+. Bicuculline did not change the GABA-evoked Ca2+ responses in Ca2-containing buffers, but suppressed them significantly in Ca2+-free buffers suggesting the two receptors couple to convergent Ca2+ mobilization mechanisms with different extracellular Ca2+ sensitivity. Prolonged activation of GABABR induced wave propagation of the Ca2+ signal and persistent oscillations. The number of cells reacting to GABA or GABA+bicuculline in P30 mouse LEC cultures expressing predominantly the synaptic type GABAAR did not differ significantly from the number of reacting cells in P0 mouse LEC cultures. The GABA-induced Ca2+ transients in P30 (but not P0) mouse LEC could be entirely suppressed by co-application of bicuculline and CGP55845. The GABA-mediated Ca2+ signaling may be involved in a variety of Ca2+-dependent cellular processes during lens growth and epithelial cell differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans modulate the activity of multiple growth factors on the cell surface and extracellular matrix. However, it remains unclear how the HS chains control the movement and reception of growth factors into targeted receiving cells during mammalian morphogenetic processes. Here, we found that HS-deficient Ext2 null mutant mouse embryos fail to respond to fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling. Marker expression analyses revealed that cell surface-tethered HS chains are crucial for local retention of FGF4 and FGF8 ligands in the extraembryonic ectoderm. Fine chimeric studies with single-cell resolution and expression studies with specific inhibitors for HS movement demonstrated that proteolytic cleavage of HS chains can spread FGF signaling to adjacent cells within a short distance. Together, the results show that spatiotemporal expression of cell surface-tethered HS chains regulate the local reception of FGF-signaling activity during mammalian embryogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Posttranscriptional gene regulation relies on hundreds of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) but the function of most RBPs is unknown. The human RBP HuR/ELAVL1 is a conserved mRNA stability regulator. We used PAR-CLIP, a recently developed method based on RNA-protein crosslinking, to identify transcriptome-wide ∼26,000 HuR binding sites. These sites were on average highly conserved, enriched for HuR binding motifs and mainly located in 3′ untranslated regions. Surprisingly, many sites were intronic, implicating HuR in mRNA processing. Upon HuR knockdown, mRNA levels and protein synthesis of thousands of target genes were downregulated, validating functionality. HuR and miRNA binding sites tended to reside nearby but generally did not overlap. Additionally, HuR knockdown triggered strong and specific upregulation of miR-7. In summary, we identified thousands of direct and functional HuR targets, found a human miRNA controlled by HuR, and propose a role for HuR in splicing.

Abstract: Summary
Histone methylation occurs on both lysine and arginine residues, and its dynamic regulation plays a critical role in chromatin biology. Here we identify the UHRF1 PHD finger (PHDUHRF1), an important regulator of DNA CpG methylation, as a histone H3 unmodified arginine 2 (H3R2) recognition modality. This conclusion is based on binding studies and cocrystal structures of PHDUHRF1 bound to histone H3 peptides, where the guanidinium group of unmodified R2 forms an extensive intermolecular hydrogen bond network, with methylation of H3R2, but not H3K4 or H3K9, disrupting complex formation. We have identified direct target genes of UHRF1 from microarray and ChIP studies. Importantly, we show that UHRF1's ability to repress its direct target gene expression is dependent on PHDUHRF1 binding to unmodified H3R2, thereby demonstrating the functional importance of this recognition event and supporting the potential for crosstalk between histone arginine methylation and UHRF1 function.

Abstract: Summary
Under conditions of obesity and insulin resistance, the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt/PKB is required for lipid accumulation in liver. Two forkhead transcription factors, FoxA2 and FoxO1, have been suggested to function downstream of and to be negatively regulated by Akt and are proposed as key determinants of hepatic triglyceride content. In this study, we utilize genetic loss of function experiments to show that constitutive activation of neither FoxA2 nor FoxO1 can account for the protection from steatosis afforded by deletion of Akt2 in liver. Rather, another downstream target positively regulated by Akt, the mTORC1 complex, is required in vivo for de novo lipogenesis and Srebp1c expression. Nonetheless, activation of mTORC1 and SREBP1c is not sufficient to drive postprandial lipogenesis in the absence of Akt2. These data show that insulin signaling through Akt2 promotes anabolic lipid metabolism independent of Foxa2 or FoxO1 and through pathways additional to the mTORC1-dependent activation of SREBP1c.

Abstract: Summary
Methylation of specific lysine residues in the C terminus of p53 is thought to govern p53-dependent transcription following genotoxic and oncogenic stress. In particular, Set7/9 (KMT7)-mediated monomethylation of human p53 at lysine 372 (p53K372me1) was suggested to be essential for p53 activation in human cell lines. This finding was confirmed in a Set7/9 knockout mouse model (Kurash et al., 2008). In an independent knockout mouse strain deficient in Set7/9, we have investigated its involvement in p53 regulation and find that cells from these mice are normal in their ability to induce p53-dependent transcription following genotoxic and oncogenic insults. Most importantly, we detect no impairment in canonical p53 functions in these mice, indicating that Set7/9-mediated methylation of p53 does not seem to represent a major regulatory event and does not appreciably control p53 activity in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
In developing amniote embryos, the first epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) occurs at gastrulation, when a subset of epiblast cells moves to the primitive streak and undergoes EMT to internalize and generate the mesoderm and the endoderm. We show that in the chick embryo this decision to internalize is mediated by reciprocal transcriptional repression of Snail2 and Sox3 factors. We also show that the relationship between Sox3 and Snail is conserved in the mouse embryo and in human cancer cells. In the embryo, Snail-expressing cells ingress at the primitive streak, whereas Sox3-positive cells, which are unable to ingress, ensure the formation of ectodermal derivatives. Thus, the subdivision of the early embryo into the two main territories, ectodermal and mesendodermal, is regulated by changes in cell behavior mediated by the antagonistic relationship between Sox3 and Snail transcription factors.

Abstract: The accurate distribution and segregation of replicated chromosomes through mitosis is crucial for cellular viability and development of organisms. Kinetochores are responsible for the proper congression and segregation of chromosomes. Here, we show that neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) localizes to and forms a complex with kinetochores in mitotic cells. Depletion of N-WASP by RNA interference causes chromosome misalignment, prolonged mitosis, and abnormal chromosomal segregation, which is associated with decreased proliferation of N-WASP-deficient cells. N-WASP-deficient cells display defects in the kinetochores recruitment of inner and outer kinetochore components, CENP-A, CENP-E, and Mad2. Live-cell imaging analysis of GFP-α-tubulin revealed that depletion of N-WASP impairs microtubule attachment to chromosomes in mitotic cells. All these results indicate that N-WASP plays a role in efficient assembly of kinetochores and attachment of microtubules to chromosomes, which is essential for accurate chromosome congression and segregation.

Abstract: Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) plays an important role in pathological angiogenesis associated with inflammatory response. Pim-3 kinase belonging to serine/threonine protein kinases is a potent suppressor of myc-induced apoptosis. We have recently demonstrated that Pim-3 plays an essential role in endothelial cell (EC) spreading and migration. In this study, we showed that TNF-α transiently increased Pim-3 mRNA expression, and this was mediated through Tumor necrosis factor-α receptor-1 (TNFR1) pathway in ECs. TNF-α could promote stabilization of Pim-3 mRNA in ECs. Small-interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated gene knockdown of Pim-3 significantly impaired TNF-α-induced formation of EC membrane protrusions in vitro.Furthermore, Pim-3 silencing inhibited EC sprouting in subcutaneous Matrigel in vivo. eNOS mRNA abundance was lower in Pim-3 siRNA transfected ECs compared with the control ECs. These observations suggest that Pim-3 plays a role in TNF-α-induced angiogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
CUL4B, encoding a scaffold protein for the assembly of Cullin4B-Ring ubiquitin ligase (CRL4B) complexes, is frequently mutated in X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) patients. Here, we show that CUL4B, but not its paralog, CUL4A, targets WDR5, a core subunit of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase complexes, for ubiquitylation and degradation in the nucleus. Knocking down CUL4B increases WDR5 and trimethylated H3K4 (H3K4me3) on the neuronal gene promoters and induces their expression. Furthermore, CUL4B depletion suppresses neurite outgrowth of PC12 neuroendocrine cells, which can be rescued by codepletion of WDR5. XLMR-linked mutations destabilize CUL4B and impair its ability to support neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells. Our results identify WDR5 as a critical substrate of CUL4B in regulating neuronal gene expression and suggest epigenetic change as a common pathogenic mechanism for CUL4B-associated XLMR.

Abstract: Summary
Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to explain how Rb and p53 tumor suppressor loss lead to chromosome instability (CIN). It was recently shown that Rb pathway inhibition causes overexpression of the mitotic checkpoint gene Mad2, but whether Mad2 overexpression is required to generate CIN in this context is unknown. Here, we show that CIN in cultured cells lacking Rb family proteins requires Mad2 upregulation and that this upregulation is also necessary for CIN and tumor progression in vivo. Mad2 is also repressed by p53 and its upregulation is required for CIN in a p53 mutant tumor model. These results demonstrate that Mad2 overexpression is a critical mediator of the CIN observed upon inactivation of two major tumor suppressor pathways.

Abstract: Acquired resistance to tamoxifen (TAM) is a serious therapeutic problem in breast cancer patients. We have shown that Pin1, a peptidyl prolyl isomerase, is consistently overexpressed in TAM-resistant MCF-7 cells (TAMR-MCF-7 cells) and plays a key role in the enhanced angiogenic potential of TAMR-MCF-7 cells. In the present study, we focused on signaling pathways for Pin1 up-regulation in TAMR-MCF-7 cells. Relative to MCF-7 cells, Pin1 gene transcription and E2 transcription factor1 (E2F1) expression were enhanced in TAMR-MCF-7 cells. E2F1 siRNA significantly reduced both the protein expression and the promoter transcriptional activity of Pin1. Activities of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 kinase were all higher in TAMR-MCF-7 cells than in control MCF-7 cells and the enhanced Pin1 and E2F1 expression in TAMR-MCF-7 cells was reversed by inhibition of PI3K or p38 kinase. Moreover, the higher production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in TAMR-MCF-7 cells was significantly diminished by suppression of PI3K or p38 kinase. These results suggest that Pin1 overexpression and subsequent VEGF production in TAMR-MCF-7 cells are mediated through PI3-kinase or p38 kinase-dependent E2F1 activation.

Abstract: Summary
Postnatal oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPC) self-renew, generate mature oligodendrocytes, and are a cellular origin of oligodendrogliomas. We show that the proteoglycan NG2 segregates asymmetrically during mitosis to generate OPC cells of distinct fate. NG2 is required for asymmetric segregation of EGFR to the NG2+ progeny, which consequently activates EGFR and undergoes EGF-dependent proliferation and self-renewal. In contrast, the NG2− progeny differentiates. In a mouse model, decreased NG2 asymmetry coincides with premalignant, abnormal self-renewal rather than differentiation and with tumor-initiating potential. Asymmetric division of human NG2+ cells is prevalent in non-neoplastic tissue but is decreased in oligodendrogliomas. Regulators of asymmetric cell division are misexpressed in low-grade oligodendrogliomas. Our results identify loss of asymmetric division associated with the neoplastic transformation of OPC.

Abstract: Summary
Heterochromatin, or silent chromatin, preferentially resides at the nuclear envelope. Telomeres and rDNA repeats are the two major perinuclear silent chromatin domains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The Cohibin protein complex maintains rDNA repeat stability in part through silent chromatin assembly and perinuclear rDNA anchoring. We report here a role for Cohibin at telomeres and show that functions of the complex at chromosome ends and rDNA maintain replicative life span. Cohibin binds LEM/SUN domain-containing nuclear envelope proteins and telomere-associated factors. Disruption of Cohibin or the envelope proteins abrogates telomere localization and silent chromatin assembly within subtelomeres. Loss of Cohibin limits Sir2 histone deacetylase localization to chromosome ends, disrupts subtelomeric DNA stability, and shortens life span even when rDNA repeats are stabilized. Restoring telomeric Sir2 concentration abolishes chromatin and life span defects linked to the loss of telomeric Cohibin. Our work uncovers roles for Cohibin complexes and reveals relationships between nuclear compartmentalization, chromosome stability, and aging.

We examined whether exogenous cell-permeable C6-ceramide enhances the phagocytic activity of Kupffer cells (KCs) and affects the level of cellular ceramides. Rat KCs were isolated by collagenase digestion and differential centrifugation, using Percoll system. Phagocytic activity was measured by FACS analysis after incubating KCs with fluorescence-conjugated latex beads, and the level of cellular ceramide was analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In this study we found that permeable C6-ceramide increases the cellular levels of endogenous ceramides via a sphingosine-recycling pathway leading to enhanced phagocytosis by KCs.

Abstract: NELL2, a protein containing epidermal growth factor-like repeat domains, is predominantly expressed in the nervous system. In the mammalian brain, NELL2 expression is mostly neuronal. Previously we found that NELL2 is involved in the onset of female puberty by regulating the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), and in normal male sexual behavior by controlling the development of the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area (POA). In this study we investigated the effect of NELL2 on the female rat estrous cycle. NELL2 expression in the POA was highest during the proestrous phase. NELL2 mRNA levels in the POA were increased by estrogen treatment in ovariectomized female rats. Blocking NELL2 synthesis in the female rat hypothalamus decreased the expression of kisspeptin 1, an important regulator of the GnRH neuronal apparatus, and resulted in disruption of the estrous cycle at the diestrous phase. These results indicate that NELL2 is involved in the maintenance of the normal female reproductive cycle in mammals.

Abstract: A hybrid hydrogel (PP) composed of Polomaxer-407 (PO) and octapeptide with amino acid sequence of KFEFKFEF (PE) was prepared to make a scaffold material incorporating PO's high and tunable mechanical strength and integrity with PE's superior bioactivity. Human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hASCs) were encapsulated into PE, PO and PP hydrogels respectively and injected subcutaneously at the dorsal neck area of nude mice. Adipose-like tissue regeneration was only observed in the mice injected with cell-encapsulated PP hydrogel. No adipose regeneration was found in the mice injected with PO or PE. Immunohistochemistry analysis with mouse anti-human nuclei monoclonal antibody demonstrated that the cells in the regenerated adipose-like tissue was originated from the injected hASCs. The growth of blood capillaries indicated that the regenerated adipose-like tissue was living tissue. In addition, human-originated cells were also found in nude mice skin. These cells were positive with mouse anti-human cells keratin antibody, suggesting that the injected hASCs migrated to the skin and differentiated into epithelial cells in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Leptin acts on leptin receptor (LepRb)-expressing neurons throughout the brain, but the roles for many populations of LepRb neurons in modulating energy balance and behavior remain unclear. We found that the majority of LepRb neurons in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) contain neurotensin (Nts). To investigate the physiologic role for leptin action via these LepRbNts neurons, we generated mice null for LepRb specifically in Nts neurons (Nts-LepRbKO mice). Nts-LepRbKO mice demonstrate early-onset obesity, modestly increased feeding, and decreased locomotor activity. Furthermore, consistent with the connection of LepRbNts neurons with local orexin (OX) neurons and the ventral tegmental area (VTA), Nts-LepRbKO mice exhibit altered regulation of OX neurons and the mesolimbic DA system. Thus, LHA LepRbNts neurons mediate physiologic leptin action on OX neurons and the mesolimbic DA system, and contribute importantly to the control of energy balance.

Abstract: Summary
Opposing activities of acetyltransferases and deacetylases help regulate energy balance. Mice heterozygous for the acetyltransferase CREB binding protein (CBP) are lean and insulin sensitized, but how CBP regulates energy homeostasis is unclear. In one model, the main CBP interaction with the glucagon-responsive factor CREB is not limiting for liver gluconeogenesis, whereas a second model posits that Ser436 in the CH1 (TAZ1) domain of CBP is required for insulin and the antidiabetic drug metformin to inhibit CREB-mediated liver gluconeogenesis. Here we show that conditional knockout of CBP in liver does not decrease fasting blood glucose or gluconeogenic gene expression, consistent with the first model. However, mice in which the CBP CH1 domain structure is disrupted by deleting residues 342–393 (ΔCH1) are lean and insulin sensitized, as are p300ΔCH1 mutants. CBPΔCH1/ΔCH1 mice remain metformin responsive. An intact CH1 domain is thus necessary for normal energy storage, but not for the blood glucose-lowering actions of insulin and metformin.

Abstract: Summary
Vertebrates express two enzymes for activation of ubiquitin—UBA1, which is responsible for activation of the vast majority of E2 conjugating enzymes, and UBA6, which uses the dedicated E2, USE1. However, targets and E3s for UBA6-USE1 are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that UBA6-USE1 functions with the UBR1–3 subfamily of N-recognin E3s to degrade the N-end rule substrates RGS4, RGS5, and Arg (R)-GFP. This pathway functions in the cytoplasm in parallel with the UBA1-UBE2A/B-UBR2 cascade, which promotes turnover of nuclear RGS4/5 proteins and an apparently phenotypically distinct pool of cytoplasmic RGS4/5. UBR2 promotes Lys48 (K48)-specific ubiquitin discharge from, and RGS4 ubiquitylation by, both USE1 and UBE2A in vitro. This work provides insight into the machinery employed by the UBA6-USE1 cascade to promote protein turnover and suggests that the UBA6 and UBA1 pathways can function in parallel with the same E3 to degrade the same targets in a spatially distinct manner.

Abstract: The Ca2+-independent phospholipase A (ÍPLA2) subfamily of enzymes is associated with arachidonic acid (AA) release and the subsequent increase in fatty acid turnover. This phenomenon occurs not only during apoptosis but also during inflammation and lymphocyte proliferation. In this study, we purified and characterized a novel type of iPLA from bovine brain. iPLA2 was purified 4,174-fold from the bovine brain by a sequential process involving DEAE-cellulose anion exchange, phenyl-5PW hydrophobic interaction, heparin-Sepharose affinity, Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration, Mono S cation exchange, Mono Q anion exchange, and Superose 12 gel filtration. A single peak of iPLA activity was eluted at an apparent molecular mass of 155 kDa during the final Superose 12 gel-filtration step. The purified enzyme had an isoelectric point of 5.3 on twodimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and was inhibited by arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF3), Triton X-100, iron, and Ca2+. However, it was not inhibited by bromoenol lactone (BEL), an inhibitor of iPLA2, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The spot with the iPLA2 activity did not match with any known protein sequence, as determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis. Altogether, these data suggest that the purified enzyme is a novel form of cytosolic iPLA2.

Abstract: Summary
SAG/RBX2/ROC2 protein is an essential RING component of SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase. The role of SAG during embryogenesis remains unknown. We report a critical role for SAG in controlling vascular and neural development by modulating RAS activity via promoting degradation of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Mice mutant for Sag died at embryonic day 11.5–12.5 with severe abnormalities in vascular and nervous system. Sag inactivation caused Nf1 accumulation and Ras inhibition, which blocks embryonic stem (ES) cells from undergoing endothelial differentiation and inhibits angiogenesis and proliferation in teratomas. Simultaneous Nf1 deletion fully rescues the differentiation defects in Sag−/− ES cells and partially rescues vascular and neural defects in Sag−/− embryos, suggesting that the effects of Sag deletion may not be solely explained by Nf1 misregulation. Collectively, our study identifies NF1 as a physiological substrate of SAG-CUL1-FBXW7 E3 ligase and establishes a ubiquitin-dependent regulatory mechanism for the NF1-RAS pathway during embryogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The phytohormone auxin is an important determinant of plant development. Directional auxin flow within tissues depends on polar localization of PIN auxin transporters. To explore regulation of PIN-mediated auxin transport, we screened for suppressors of PIN1 overexpression (supo) and identified an inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase mutant (supo1), with elevated inositol trisphosphate (InsP3) and cytosolic Ca2+ levels. Pharmacological and genetic increases in InsP3 or Ca2+ levels also suppressed the PIN1 gain-of-function phenotypes and caused defects in basal PIN localization, auxin transport and auxin-mediated development. In contrast, the reductions in InsP3 levels and Ca2+ signaling antagonized the effects of the supo1 mutation and disrupted preferentially apical PIN localization. InsP3 and Ca2+ are evolutionarily conserved second messengers involved in various cellular functions, particularly stress responses. Our findings implicate them as modifiers of cell polarity and polar auxin transport, and highlight a potential integration point through which Ca2+ signaling-related stimuli could influence auxin-mediated development.

Abstract: Summary
A critical component of the DNA damage response is the p53 tumor suppressor, and aberrant p53 function leads to uncontrolled cell proliferation and malignancy. Several molecules have been shown to regulate p53 stability; however, genome-wide systemic approaches for determining the affected, specific downstream target genes have not been extensively studied. Here, we first identified an orphan nuclear receptor, RORα, as a direct target gene of p53, which contains functional p53 response elements. The functional consequences of DNA damage-induced RORα are to stabilize p53 and activate p53 transcription in a HAUSP/Usp7-dependent manner. Interestingly, microarray analysis revealed that RORα-mediated p53 stabilization leads to the activation of a subset of p53 target genes that are specifically involved in apoptosis. We further confirmed that RORα enhances p53-dependent, in vivo apoptotic function in the Drosophila model system. Together, we determined that RORα is a p53 regulator that exerts its role in increased apoptosis via p53.

Abstract: Summary
Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) degrades both normal and aberrant transcripts harboring stop codons in particular contexts. Mutations that perturb NMD cause neurological disorders in humans, suggesting that NMD has roles in the brain. Here, we identify a brain-specific microRNA—miR-128—that represses NMD and thereby controls batteries of transcripts in neural cells. miR-128 represses NMD by targeting the RNA helicase UPF1 and the exon-junction complex core component MLN51. The ability of miR-128 to regulate NMD is a conserved response occurring in frogs, chickens, and mammals. miR-128 levels are dramatically increased in differentiating neuronal cells and during brain development, leading to repressed NMD and upregulation of mRNAs normally targeted for decay by NMD; overrepresented are those encoding proteins controlling neuron development and function. Together, these results suggest the existence of a conserved RNA circuit linking the microRNA and NMD pathways that induces cell type-specific transcripts during development.

Abstract: Overload of intracellular Ca2+ has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neuronal disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Various mechanisms produce abnormalities in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis systems. L-type Ca2+ channels have been known to be closely involved in the mechanisms underlying the neurodegenerative properties of amyloid-β(Aβ) peptides. However, most studies of L-type Ca2+ channels in Aβ-related mechanisms have been limited to CaV1.2, and surprisingly little is known about the involvement of CaV1.3 in Aβ-induced neuronal toxicity. In the present study, we examined the expression patterns of CaV1.3 after Aβ25-35 exposure for 24 h and compared them with the expression patterns of CaV1.2. The expression levels of CaV1.3 were not significantly changed by Aβ25-35 at both the mRNA levels and the total protein level in cultured hippocampal neurons. However, surface protein levels of CaV1.3 were significantly increased by Aβ25-35, but not by Aβ35-25. We next found that acute treatment with Aβ25-35 increased CaV1.3 channel activities in HEK293 cells using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. Furthermore, using GTP pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation assays in HEK293 cell lysates, we found that amyloid precursor protein interacts with β3 subunits of Ca 2+ channels instead of CaV1.2 or CaV1.3 α1 subunits. These results show that Aβ25-35 chronically or acutely upregulates CaV1.3 in the rat hippocampal and human kidney cells (HEK293). This suggests that CaV1.3 has a potential role along with CaV1.2 in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease.

Abstract: Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci causes wildfire disease in tobacco plants. The hrp pathogenicity island (hrp PAI) of P. syringae pv. tabaci encodes a type III secretion system (TTSS) and its regulatory system, which are required for pathogenesis in plants. Three important regulatory proteins-HrpR, HrpS, and HrpL-have been identified to activate hrp PAI gene expression. The bacterial Lon protease regulates the expression of various genes. To investigate the regulatory mechanism of the Lon protease in P. syringae pv. tabaci 11528, we cloned the Ion gene, and then a ΔIon mutant was generated by allelic exchange. Ion mutants showed increased UV sensitivity, which is a typical feature of such mutants. The ΔIon mutant produced higher levels of tabtoxin than the wild-type. The lacZ gene was fused with hrpA promoter and activity of β-galactosidase was measured in hrp-repressing and hrp-inducing media. The Lon protease functioned as a negative regulator of hrp PAI under hrp-repressing conditions. We found that strains with Ion disruption elicited the host defense system more rapidly and strongly than the wild-type strain, suggesting that the Lon protease is essential for systemic pathogenesis.

Abstract: In fetal mammalian heart, constitutive adenylyl cyclase/cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A (cAMP-PKA)-mediated phosphorylation, independent of β-adrenergic receptor stimulation, could under such circumstances play an important role in sustaining the L-type calcium channel current (ICa,L) and regulating other PKA dependent phosphorylation targets. In this study, we investigated the regulation of L-type Ca2+ channel (LTCC) in murine embryonic ventricles. The data indicated a higher phosphorylation state of LTCC at early developmental stage (EDS, E9.5–E11.5) than late developmental stage (LDS, E16.5–E18.5). An intrinsic adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity, PKA activity and basal cAMP concentration were obviously higher at EDS than LDS. The cAMP increase in the presence of isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX, nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor) was further augmented at LDS but not at EDS by chelation of intracellular Ca2+ with 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA)-acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM). Furthermore, ICa,L increased with time after patch rupture in LDS cardiomyocytes dialyzed with pipette solution containing BAPTA whereas not at EDS. Thus we conclude that the high basal level of LTCC phosphorylation is due to the high intrinsic PKA activity and the high intrinsic AC activity at EDS. The latter is possibly owing to the little or no effect of Ca2+ influx via LTCCs on AC activity, leading to the inability to inhibit AC.

Abstract: Summary
The AAA+ family in eukaryotes has many members in various cellular compartments with a role in protein unfolding and degradation. We show that the mitochondrial AAA-ATPase Bcs1 has an unusual function in protein translocation. Bcs1 mediates topogenesis of the Rieske protein, Rip1, a component of respiratory chains in bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. The oligomeric AAA-ATPase Bcs1 is involved in export of the folded Fe-S domain of Rip1 across the inner membrane and insertion of its transmembrane segment into an assembly intermediate of the cytochrome bc1 complex, thus revealing an unexpected mechanistical concept of protein translocation across membranes. Furthermore, we describe structural elements of Rip1 required for recognition and export by as well as ATP-dependent lateral release from the AAA-ATPase. In bacteria and chloroplasts Rip1 uses the Tat machinery for topogenesis; however, mitochondria have lost this machinery during evolution and a member of the AAA-ATPase family has taken over its function.

Abstract: In the present work we evaluated the effect of ethanol consumption in histopathological liver changes and several biochemical biomarkers employed in the detection of hepatic dysfunction. Male Wistar rats were treated with ethanol 20% (vol/vol) for 6 weeks. Histopathological investigation of livers from ethanol-treated animals revealed steatosis. Indices of hepatic function (transaminases) and mitochondrial respiration were not altered in ethanol-treated rats. Chronic ethanol consumption did not alter malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the liver. Ethanol consumption induced a significant increase on hepatic nitrite and nitrate levels. Treatment with ethanol increased both mRNA expression and immunostaining of iNOS, but not eNOS. Finally, ethanol consumption did not alter hepatic levels of metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9. We conclude that alterations on biochemical biomarkers (nitrite and nitrate levels) and histopathology occurred in ethanol-treated rats, supporting the practice of including both types of evaluation in toxicity studies to detect potential ethanol-related hepatic effects. In our model of ethanol consumption, histopathological liver changes were accompanied by elevation in nitrite and nitrate levels indicating increased nitric oxide (NO) generation. Since iNOS-derived NO contributes to hepatic injury, the increased levels of NO described in our study might contribute to a progressive hepatic damage. Therefore, increases in NO generation may be an early indicator of ethanol-induced liver damage.

Abstract: Previously, we reported that the expression of zinc-finger protein 143 (ZNF143) was induced by insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) via reactive oxygen species (ROS)- and phosphatidylinositide-3-kinase (PI3-kinase)-linked pathways in colon cancer cells. Here, we investigated whether GAIP-interacting protein, C-terminus (GIPC), a binding partner of IGF-1R, is involved in ZNF143 expression through IGF-1 and IGF-1R signaling in colon cancer cells. The knockdown of GIPC in colon cancer cells reduced ZNF143 expression in response to IGF-1. IGF-1 signaling through its receptor, leading to the phosphorylation and activation of the PI3-kinase-Akt pathway and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) was unaffected by the knockdown of GIPC, indicating the independence of the GIPC-linked pathway from PI3-kinase- and MAPK-linked signaling in IGF-1-induced ZNF143 expression. In accordance with previous results in breast cancer cells (Choi et al., 2010), the knockdown of GIPC reduced ROS production in response to IGF-1 in colon cancer cells. Furthermore, the knockdown of GIPC reduced the expression of Rad51, which is regulated by ZNF143, in response to IGF-1 in colon cancer cells. Taken together, these data suggest that GIPC is involved in IGF-1 signaling leading to ZNF143 expression through the regulation of ROS production, which may play a role for colon cancer tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Ultrastructural investigations on the amphigonic reproductive mechanisms in Aphidoidea (Homoptera, Sternorryncha) species, of which little is known in the literature, can provide useful information on their reproductive biology. Morphological and ultrastructural investigations were carried out on the reproductive tract and on spermatozoa from sexually mature males of five species belonging to three subfamilies of Aphidoidea. The organization of the reproductive tract and of spermatozoa appears simple and similar in the examined species. Each testis consists of three follicles containing many cysts arranged in a progressive order of maturation from the distal to the proximal tract; spermiogenesis only occurs in sexually mature males, ending with the organization of sperm bundles. Gametes are neatly arranged in each bundle and kept together by a cap showing a particular organization. The distal tract of each spermiduct is enlarged and full of gametes; close to the testis the two spermiducts merge together, except in Drepanosiphum platanoidis where the spermiducts run independently. The various tracts of each examined gland showed no peculiar differences either in the same species or among the species. Some interesting hypotheses are proposed in this work about the probable roles of the investigated structures in the reproductive mechanisms of these insects.

Abstract: Summary
The mitochondrial inner membrane consists of two domains, inner boundary membrane and cristae membrane that are connected by crista junctions. Mitofilin/Fcj1 was reported to be involved in formation of crista junctions, however, different views exist on its function and possible partner proteins. We report that mitofilin plays a dual role. Mitofilin is part of a large inner membrane complex, and we identify five partner proteins as constituents of the mitochondrial inner membrane organizing system (MINOS) that is required for keeping cristae membranes connected to the inner boundary membrane. Additionally, mitofilin is coupled to the outer membrane and promotes protein import via the mitochondrial intermembrane space assembly pathway. Our findings indicate that mitofilin is a central component of MINOS and functions as a multifunctional regulator of mitochondrial architecture and protein biogenesis.

Defective Regulation of Autophagy upon Leucine Deprivation Reveals a Targetable Liability of Human Melanoma Cells In Vitro and In Vivo,

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy is of increasing interest as a target for cancer therapy. We find that leucine deprivation causes the caspase-dependent apoptotic death of melanoma cells because it fails to appropriately activate autophagy. Hyperactivation of the RAS-MEK pathway, which is common in melanoma, prevents leucine deprivation from inhibiting mTORC1, the main repressor of autophagy under nutrient-rich conditions. In an in vivo tumor xenograft model, the combination of a leucine-free diet and an autophagy inhibitor synergistically suppresses the growth of human melanoma tumors and triggers widespread apoptosis of the cancer cells. Together, our study represents proof of principle that anticancer effects can be obtained with a combination of autophagy inhibition and strategies to deprive tumors of leucine.

Abstract: Summary
We show that imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib possess weak off-target activity against RAF and, therefore, drive paradoxical activation of BRAF and CRAF in a RAS-dependent manner. Critically, because RAS is activated by BCR-ABL, in drug-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells, RAS activity persists in the presence of these drugs, driving paradoxical activation of BRAF, CRAF, MEK, and ERK, and leading to an unexpected dependency on the pathway. Consequently, nilotinib synergizes with MEK inhibitors to kill drug-resistant CML cells and block tumor growth in mice. Thus, we show that imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib drive paradoxical RAF/MEK/ERK pathway activation and have uncovered a synthetic lethal interaction that can be used to kill drug-resistant CML cells in vitro and in vivo.

Abstract: There is controversy as to whether TRP channels participate in mediating store-operated current (ISOC) and store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). Our recent study has demonstrated that TRPC1 forms heteromeric channels with TRPV4 in vascular endothelial cells and that Ca2+ store depletion enhances the vesicle trafficking of heteromeric TRPV4-C1 channels, causing insertion of more channels into the plasma membrane in vascular endothelial cells. In the present study, we determined whether the enhanced TRPV4-C1 insertion to the plasma membrane could contribute to SOCE and ISOC. We found that thapsigargin-induced SOCE was much lower in aortic endothelial cells derived from trpv4−/− or trpc1−/− knockout mice when compared to that of wild-type mice. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), thapsigargin-induced SOCE was markedly reduced by knocking down the expression of TRPC1 and/or TRPV4 with respective siRNAs. Brefeldin A, a blocker of vesicular translocation, inhibited the SOCE. These results suggest that an enhanced vesicular trafficking of heteromeric TRPV4-C1 channels contributes to SOCE in vascular endothelial cells. Vascular tension studies suggest that such an enhanced trafficking of TRPV4-C1 channels may play a role in thapsigargin-induced vascular relaxation in rat small mesenteric arteries.

Abstract: Summary
Alternative intronic polyadenylation (IPA) can generate truncated protein isoforms with significantly altered functions. Here, we describe 31 dominant-negative, secreted variant isoforms of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that are produced by activation of intronic poly(A) sites. We show that blocking U1-snRNP can activate IPA, indicating a larger role for U1-snRNP in RNA surveillance. Moreover, we report the development of an antisense-based method to effectively and specifically activate expression of individual soluble decoy RTKs (sdRTKs) to alter signaling, with potential therapeutic implications. In particular, a quantitative switch from signal transducing full-length vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2/KDR) to a dominant-negative sKDR results in a strong antiangiogenic effect both on directly targeted cells and on naive cells exposed to conditioned media, suggesting a role for this approach in interfering with angiogenic paracrine and autocrine loops.

The Msx1 Homeoprotein Recruits Polycomb to the Nuclear Periphery during Development,

Abstract: Summary
Control of gene expression during development requires the concerted action of sequence-specific transcriptional regulators and epigenetic modifiers, which are spatially coordinated within the nucleus through mechanisms that are poorly understood. Here we show that transcriptional repression by the Msx1 homeoprotein in myoblast cells requires the recruitment of Polycomb to target genes located at the nuclear periphery. Target genes repressed by Msx1 display an Msx1-dependent enrichment of Polycomb-directed trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3). Association of Msx1 with the Polycomb complex is required for repression and regulation of myoblast differentiation. Furthermore, Msx1 promotes a dynamic spatial redistribution of the H3K27me3 repressive mark to the nuclear periphery in myoblast cells and the developing limb in vivo. Our findings illustrate a hitherto unappreciated spatial coordination of transcription factors with the Polycomb complex for appropriate regulation of gene expression programs during development.

Abstract: Summary
Posttranslational modification of PCNA by ubiquitin plays an important role in coordinating the processes of DNA damage tolerance during DNA replication. The monoubiquitination of PCNA was shown to facilitate the switch between the replicative DNA polymerase with the low-fidelity polymerase eta (η) to bypass UV-induced DNA lesions during replication. Here, we show that in response to oxidative stress, PCNA becomes transiently monoubiquitinated in an S phase- and USP1-independent manner. Moreover, Polη interacts with mUb-PCNA at sites of oxidative DNA damage via its PCNA-binding and ubiquitin-binding motifs. Strikingly, while functional base excision repair is not required for this modification of PCNA or Polη recruitment to chromatin, the presence of hMsh2-hMsh6 is indispensable. Our findings highlight an alternative pathway in response to oxidative DNA damage that may coordinate the removal of oxidatively induced clustered DNA lesions and could explain the high levels of oxidized DNA lesions in MSH2-deficient cells.

Abstract: Summary
LDL-receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6), alongside Frizzled receptors, transduces Wnt signaling across the plasma membrane. The LRP6 ectodomain comprises four tandem β-propeller–EGF-like domain (PE) pairs that harbor binding sites for Wnt morphogens and their antagonists including Dickkopf 1 (Dkk1). To understand how these multiple interactions are integrated, we combined crystallographic analysis of the third and fourth PE pairs with electron microscopy (EM) to determine the complete ectodomain structure. An extensive inter-pair interface, conserved for the first-to-second and third-to-fourth PE interactions, contributes to a compact platform-like architecture, which is disrupted by mutations implicated in developmental diseases. EM reconstruction of the LRP6 platform bound to chaperone Mesd exemplifies a binding mode spanning PE pairs. Cellular and binding assays identify overlapping Wnt3a- and Dkk1-binding surfaces on the third PE pair, consistent with steric competition, but also suggest a model in which the platform structure supports an interplay of ligands through multiple interaction sites.

Abstract: Summary
WTX is an X-linked tumor suppressor targeted by somatic mutations in Wilms tumor, a pediatric kidney cancer, and by germline inactivation in osteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis, a bone overgrowth syndrome. Here, we show that Wtx deletion in mice causes neonatal lethality, somatic overgrowth, and malformation of multiple mesenchyme-derived tissues, including bone, fat, kidney, heart, and spleen. Inactivation of Wtx at different developmental stages and in primary mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) reveals that bone mass increase and adipose tissue deficiency are due to altered lineage fate decisions coupled with delayed terminal differentiation. Specification defects in MPCs result from aberrant β-catenin activation, whereas alternative pathways contribute to the subsequently delayed differentiation of lineage-restricted cells. Thus, Wtx is a regulator of MPC commitment and differentiation with stage-specific functions in inhibiting canonical Wnt signaling. Furthermore, the constellation of anomalies in Wtx null mice suggests that this tumor suppressor broadly regulates MPCs in multiple tissues.

Abstract: Cortexillins are actin-bundling proteins that play a critical role in regulating cell morphology and actin cytoskeleton reorganization in Dictyostelium. Here, we investigated dynamic subcellular localization of cortexillin I in chemotaxing Dictyostelium cells. Most of the cortexillin I was enriched on the lateral sides of moving cells. Upon chemoattractant stimulation, cortexillin I was rapidly released from the cortex followed by a transient translocation to the cell cortex with a peak at ~5 s and a subsequent decrease to basal levels, indicating that localization of cor-texillin I at the cortex in chemotaxing cells is controlled by two more signaling components, one for the initial delocalization from the cortex and another for the translocation to the cortex ~5 s after chemoattractant stimulation. Loss of cortexillins leads to reduced cell polarity and an in-creased number of lateral pseudopodia during chemotaxis, suggesting that cortexillins play an inhibitory role in producing pseudopodia along the lateral sides of the cell. Cells lacking cortexillins displayed extended chemoattrac-tant-mediated Arp2/3 complex translocation kinetics to the cortex. Our present study provides a new insight into the function of cortexillins during reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and cell migration.

Abstract: Summary
Dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis are associated with reduced insulin sensitivity and diabetes, but the mechanism is unclear. Gain of function of the gene encoding deacetylase SirT1 improves insulin sensitivity and could be expected to protect against lipid abnormalities. Surprisingly, when transgenic mice overexpressing SirT1 (SirBACO) are placed on atherogenic diet, they maintain better glucose homeostasis, but develop worse lipid profiles and larger atherosclerotic lesions than controls. We show that transcription factor cAMP response element binding protein (Creb) is deacetylated in SirBACO mice. We identify Lys136 is a substrate for SirT1-dependent deacetylation that affects Creb activity by preventing its cAMP-dependent phosphorylation, leading to reduced expression of glucogenic genes and promoting hepatic lipid accumulation and secretion. Expression of constitutively acetylated Creb (K136Q) in SirBACO mice mimics Creb activation and abolishes the dyslipidemic and insulin-sensitizing effects of SirT1 gain of function. We propose that SirT1-dependent Creb deacetylation regulates the balance between glucose and lipid metabolism, integrating fasting signals.

Abstract: Summary
Alternative mRNA splicing provides transcript diversity and may contribute to human disease. We demonstrate that expression of several genes regulating RNA processing is decreased in both liver and skeletal muscle of obese humans. We evaluated a representative splicing factor, SFRS10, downregulated in both obese human liver and muscle and in high-fat-fed mice, and determined metabolic impact of reduced expression. SFRS10-specific siRNA induces lipogenesis and lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. Moreover, Sfrs10 heterozygous mice have increased hepatic lipogenic gene expression, VLDL secretion, and plasma triglycerides. We demonstrate that LPIN1, a key regulator of lipid metabolism, is a splicing target of SFRS10; reduced SFRS10 favors the lipogenic β isoform of LPIN1. Importantly, LPIN1β-specific siRNA abolished lipogenic effects of decreased SFRS10 expression. Together, our results indicate that reduced expression of SFRS10, as observed in tissues from obese humans, alters LPIN1 splicing, induces lipogenesis, and therefore contributes to metabolic phenotypes associated with obesity.

Abstract: Summary
Polycomb Repressive Complexes (PRC1 and PRC2)-mediated epigenetic regulation is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Members of Polycomb Group (PcG) proteins including EZH2, a PRC2 component, are upregulated in various cancer types, implicating their role in tumorigenesis. Here, we have identified several microRNAs (miRNAs) that are repressed by EZH2. These miRNAs, in turn, regulate the expression of PRC1 proteins BMI1 and RING2. We found that ectopic overexpression of EZH2-regulated miRNAs attenuated cancer cell growth and invasiveness, and abrogated cancer stem cell properties. Importantly, expression analysis revealed an inverse correlation between miRNA and PRC protein levels in cell culture and prostate cancer tissues. Taken together, our data have uncovered a coordinate regulation of PRC1 and PRC2 activities that is mediated by miRNAs.

Abstract: Summary
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident mannosidases generate asparagine-linked oligosaccharide signals that trigger ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) of unfolded glycoproteins. In this study, we provide in vitro evidence that a complex of the yeast protein disulfide isomerase Pdi1p and the mannosidase Htm1p processes Man8GlcNAc2 carbohydrates bound to unfolded proteins, yielding Man7GlcNAc2. This glycan serves as a signal for HRD ligase-mediated glycoprotein disposal. We identified a point mutation in PDI1 that prevents complex formation of the oxidoreductase with Htm1p, diminishes mannosidase activity, and delays degradation of unfolded glycoproteins in vivo. Our results show that Pdi1p is engaged in both recognition and glycan signal processing of ERAD substrates and suggest that protein folding and breakdown are not separated but interconnected processes. We propose a stochastic model for how a given glycoprotein is partitioned into folding or degradation pathways and how the flux through these pathways is adjusted to stress conditions.

Abstract: Summary
It is widely believed that the molecular and cellular features of a tumor reflect its cell of origin and can thus provide clues about treatment targets. The retinoblastoma cell of origin has been debated for over a century. Here, we report that human and mouse retinoblastomas have molecular, cellular, and neurochemical features of multiple cell classes, principally amacrine/horizontal interneurons, retinal progenitor cells, and photoreceptors. Importantly, single-cell gene expression array analysis showed that these multiple cell type-specific developmental programs are coexpressed in individual retinoblastoma cells, which creates a progenitor/neuronal hybrid cell. Furthermore, neurotransmitter receptors, transporters, and biosynthetic enzymes are expressed in human retinoblastoma, and targeted disruption of these pathways reduces retinoblastoma growth in vivo and in vitro.

Abstract: Summary
Formins are a conserved family of proteins with robust effects in promoting actin nucleation and elongation. However, the mechanisms restraining formin activities in cells to generate actin networks with particular dynamics and architectures are not well understood. In S. cerevisiae, formins assemble actin cables, which serve as tracks for myosin-dependent intracellular transport. Here, we show that the kinesin-like myosin passenger-protein Smy1 interacts with the FH2 domain of the formin Bnr1 to decrease rates of actin filament elongation, which is distinct from the formin displacement activity of Bud14. In vivo analysis of smy1Δ mutants demonstrates that this “damper” mechanism is critical for maintaining proper actin cable architecture, dynamics, and function. We directly observe Smy1-3GFP being transported by myosin V and transiently pausing at the neck in a manner dependent on Bnr1. These observations suggest that Smy1 is part of a negative feedback mechanism that detects cable length and prevents overgrowth.

Abstract: Summary
Alteration of the PTEN/PI3K pathway is associated with late-stage and castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, how PTEN loss is involved in CRPC development is not clear. Here, we show that castration-resistant growth is an intrinsic property of Pten null prostate cancer (CaP) cells, independent of cancer development stage. PTEN loss suppresses androgen-responsive gene expressions by modulating androgen receptor (AR) transcription factor activity. Conditional deletion of Ar in the epithelium promotes the proliferation of Pten null cancer cells, at least in part, by downregulating the androgen-responsive gene Fkbp5 and preventing PHLPP-mediated AKT inhibition. Our findings identify PI3K and AR pathway crosstalk as a mechanism of CRPC development, with potentially important implications for CaP etiology and therapy.

Abstract: Summary
The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) converts cells from static epithelial to migratory mesenchymal states (Hay, 1995). Here, we demonstrate that EMT in the Drosophila endoderm is dependent on the GATA-factor Serpent (Srp), and that Srp acts as a potent trigger for this transition when activated ectopically. We show that Srp affects endodermal-EMT through a downregulation of junctional dE-Cadherin (dE-Cad) protein, without a block in its transcription. Moreover, the relocalization of dE-Cad is achieved through the direct repression of crumbs (crb) by Srp. Finally, we show that hGATA-6, an ortholog of Srp, induces a similar transition in mammalian cells. Similar to Srp, hGATA-6 acts through the downregulation of junctional E-Cad, without blocking its transcription, and induces the repression of a Crumbs ortholog, crb2. Together, these results identify a set of GATA factors as a conserved alternative trigger to repress epithelial characteristics and confer migratory capabilities on epithelial cells in development and pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The heart is the most common site of congenital defects, and valvuloseptal defects are the most common of the cardiac anomalies seen in the newborn. The process of endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) in the cardiac cushions is a required step during early valve development, and Notch signaling is required for this process. Here we show that Notch activation induces the transcription of both subunits of the soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) heterodimer, GUCY1A3 and GUCY1B3, which form the nitric oxide receptor. In parallel, Notch also promotes nitric oxide (NO) production by inducing Activin A, thereby activating a PI3-kinase/Akt pathway to phosphorylate eNOS. We thus show that the activation of sGC by NO through a Notch-dependent autocrine loop is necessary to drive early EndMT in the developing atrioventricular canal (AVC).

Abstract: Interleukin 10 (IL-10) is a multifunctional cytokine that regulates diverse functions of immune cells. Natural killer (NK) cells express the IL-10 and IL-10 receptor, but little is known about the function of IL-10 on NK cell activation. In this study, we show the expression and role of IL-10 in human NK cells. Among the cytokines tested, IL-15 was the most potent inducer of IL-10, with a maximal peak expression at 5 h after treatment. Furthermore, IL-10 receptor was shown to be expressed in NK cells. IL-10 alone had a significant effect on NK cytotoxicity which additively increased NK cell cytotoxicity in the presence of IL-15. Neutralizing IL-10 with anti-IL-10 antibody suppressed the inductive effect of IL-10 on NK cell cytotoxicity; however, IL-10 had no effect on IFN-γ or TNF-α production or NK cell activatory receptor expression. STAT signals are implicated as a key mediator of IL-10/IL-15 cytotoxicity response. Thus, the effect of IL-10 on NK cells is particularly interesting with regard to the STAT3 signal that was enhanced by IL-10 or IL-15.

Abstract: Summary
Angiogenin is a stress-activated ribonuclease that cleaves tRNA within anticodon loops to produce tRNA-derived stress-induced fragments (tiRNAs). Transfection of natural or synthetic tiRNAs inhibits protein synthesis and triggers the phospho-eIF2α-independent assembly of stress granules (SGs), essential components of the stress response program. We show that selected tiRNAs inhibit protein synthesis by displacing eIF4G/eIF4A from uncapped > capped RNAs. tiRNAs also displace eIF4F, but not eIF4E:4EBP1, from isolated m7G cap. We identify a terminal oligoguanine motif that is required to displace the eIF4F complex, inhibit translation, and induce SG assembly. We show that the tiRNA-associated translational silencer YB-1 contributes to angiogenin-, tiRNA-, and oxidative stress-induced translational repression. Our data reveal some of the mechanisms by which stress-induced tRNA cleavage inhibits protein synthesis and activates a cytoprotective stress response program.

Recombination Hotspots and Single-Stranded DNA Binding Proteins Couple DNA Translocation to DNA Unwinding by the AddAB Helicase-Nuclease,

Abstract: Summary
AddAB is a helicase-nuclease that processes double-stranded DNA breaks for repair by homologous recombination. This process is modulated by Chi recombination hotspots: specific DNA sequences that attenuate the nuclease activity of the translocating AddAB complex to promote downstream recombination. Using a combination of kinetic and imaging techniques, we show that AddAB translocation is not coupled to DNA unwinding in the absence of single-stranded DNA binding proteins because nascent single-stranded DNA immediately re-anneals behind the moving enzyme. However, recognition of recombination hotspot sequences during translocation activates unwinding by coupling these activities, thereby ensuring the downstream formation of single-stranded DNA that is required for RecA-mediated recombinational repair. In addition to their implications for the mechanism of double-stranded DNA break repair, these observations may affect our implementation and interpretation of helicase assays and our understanding of helicase mechanisms in general.

Abstract: Summary
Stress responses in plants are tightly coordinated with developmental processes, but interaction of these pathways is poorly understood. We used genome-wide assays at high spatiotemporal resolution to understand the processes that link development and stress in the Arabidopsis root. Our meta-analysis finds little evidence for a universal stress response. However, common stress responses appear to exist with many showing cell type specificity. Common stress responses may be mediated by cell identity regulators because mutations in these genes resulted in altered responses to stress. Evidence for a direct role for cell identity regulators came from genome-wide binding profiling of the key regulator SCARECROW, which showed binding to regulatory regions of stress-responsive genes. Coexpression in response to stress was used to identify genes involved in specific developmental processes. These results reveal surprising linkages between stress and development at cellular resolution, and show the power of multiple genome-wide data sets to elucidate biological processes.

Effects of Transient Receptor Potential Channel Blockers on Pacemaker Activity in Interstitial Cells of Cajal from Mouse Small Intestine,

Abstract: The interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) are pacemakers in the gastrointestinal tract and transient receptor potential melastatin type 7 (TRPM7) is a candidate for pacemaker channels. The effect of the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) inhibitors NDGA, AA861, MK886 and zileuton on pacemaking activity of ICCs was examined using the whole cell patch clamp technique. NDGA and AA861 decreased the amplitude of pacemaker potentials in ICC clusters, but the resting membrane potentials displayed little change, respectively. Also, perfusing NDGA and AA861 into the bath reduced both inward current and outward current in TRPM7-like current in single ICC, respectively. But, they had no effects on Ca2+ activated Cl- currents. The 5-LOX inhibitors MK886 and zileuton were, however, ineffective in pacemaker potentials in ICC clusters and in TRPM7-like current in single ICC, respectively. A specific TRPC3 inhibitor, pyrazole compound (Pyr3), and a specific TRPM4 inhibitor, 9-phenanthrol, had no effects in pacemaker potentials in ICC clusters and in TRPM7-like current in single ICC. These results suggest that, among the tested 5-LOX inhibitors, NDGA and AA861 modulate the pacemaker activities of the ICCs, and that the TRPM7 channel can affect intestinal motility.

Abstract: Summary
Somatic loss-of-function mutations in the ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2) gene occur in a significant proportion of patients with myeloid malignancies. Although there are extensive genetic data implicating TET2 mutations in myeloid transformation, the consequences of Tet2 loss in hematopoietic development have not been delineated. We report here an animal model of conditional Tet2 loss in the hematopoietic compartment that leads to increased stem cell self-renewal in vivo as assessed by competitive transplant assays. Tet2 loss leads to a progressive enlargement of the hematopoietic stem cell compartment and eventual myeloproliferation in vivo, including splenomegaly, monocytosis, and extramedullary hematopoiesis. In addition, Tet2+/− mice also displayed increased stem cell self-renewal and extramedullary hematopoiesis, suggesting that Tet2 haploinsufficiency contributes to hematopoietic transformation in vivo.

Abstract: Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are a group of genetic childhood-onset progressive brain diseases characterized by a decline in mental and motor capacities, epilepsy, visual loss and premature death. Using patch clamp, fluorescence imaging and caged Ca2+ photolysis, we evaluated the mechanisms of neuronal Ca2+ clearance in Cln8mnd mice, a model of the human NCL caused by mutations in the CLN8 gene. In Cln8mnd hippocampal slices, Ca2+ clearance efficiency in interneurons and, to some extent, principal neurons declined with age. In cultured Cln8mnd hippocampal neurons, clearance of large Ca2+ loads was inefficient due to impaired mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. In contrast, neither Ca2+ uptake by sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase, nor Ca2+ extrusion through plasma membrane was affected by the Cln8 mutation. Excitotoxic glutamate challenge caused Ca2+ deregulation more readily in Cln8mnd than in wt neurons. We propose that neurodegeneration in human CLN8 disorders is primarily caused by reduced mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering capacity.

Abstract: Summary
Macroautophagy is a lysosomal degradative pathway that maintains cellular homeostasis by turning over cellular components. Here we demonstrate a role for autophagy in hypothalamic agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons in the regulation of food intake and energy balance. We show that starvation-induced hypothalamic autophagy mobilizes neuron-intrinsic lipids to generate endogenous free fatty acids, which in turn regulate AgRP levels. The functional consequences of inhibiting autophagy are the failure to upregulate AgRP in response to starvation, and constitutive increases in hypothalamic levels of pro-opiomelanocortin and its cleavage product α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone that typically contribute to a lean phenotype. We propose a conceptual framework for considering how autophagy-regulated lipid metabolism within hypothalamic neurons may modulate neuropeptide levels to have immediate effects on food intake, as well as long-term effects on energy homeostasis. Regulation of hypothalamic autophagy could become an effective intervention in conditions such as obesity and the metabolic syndrome.
