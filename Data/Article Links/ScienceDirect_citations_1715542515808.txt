Abstract: It is known that hyperlipidemia is a risk factor for sensorineural hearing loss. However, the biological mechanisms underlying hyperlipidemia and hearing impairment have not been completely elucidated in the cochlea. Based on our previous study of human subjects, elderly people taking drugs for hyperlipidemia showed better hearing than those not taking any medications. We hypothesized that drugs for hyperlipidemia, such as statins, may have the potential to prevent hearing impairment. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between hyperlipidemia and hearing impairment and the hearing preservation effect of atorvastatin using a hyperlipidemic mouse model with diet-induced obesity (DIO). Here, we demonstrate that DIO mice had a significant hearing impairment as well as increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hair cell death due to reduced levels of pAKT and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2). However, these changes were significantly prevented by atorvastatin. Oxidative stress-induced intrinsic apoptosis was decreased by the high expression of Nrf2 and antioxidant genes, which improved mitochondrial function and ROS via activation of the PI3K-pAKT pathway by atorvastatin. Therefore, atorvastatin has the potential to prevent hearing impairment via redox balance in the presence of hyperlipidemia.

Abstract: The cast-grown monocrystalline-like silicon (mono-like Si) technology has been reactivated recently for the manufacture of high-efficiency solar cells at low cost. In this paper, we have provided a progressive research, both experimentally and theoretically, to improve the efficiency of mono-like Si passivated emitter and rear cells (PERCs) through production lines. By employing rear surface passivation of AlOx/triple-SiNx:H layers, the average efficiency has increased to 21.87% with a champion efficiency of 22.32% from the standard mono-like Si PERCs of 21.72% efficiency with AlOx capped with double-SiNx:H layers. We have further optimized the rear electrode contact patterns and introduced the selective emitter (SE) technology, yielding an absolute efficiency improvement of 0.19% and 0.26%, respectively. Integrating all approaches of the triple-SiNx:H, rear contact pattern optimization and SE technology, we have demonstrated that the mono-like Si PERCs can reach the average efficiency of 22.2% with a maximum efficiency of 22.5%, similar to the current Czochralski monocrystalline Si counterparts.

Abstract: The Ser/Thr protein phosphatase Ppz1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the best characterized member of a family of enzymes only found in fungi. Ppz1 is regulated in vivo by two inhibitory subunits, Hal3 and Vhs3, which are moonlighting proteins also involved in the decarboxylation of the 4-phosphopantothenoylcysteine (PPC) intermediate required for coenzyme A biosynthesis. It has been reported that, when overexpressed, Ppz1 is the most toxic protein in yeast. However, the reasons for such toxicity have not been elucidated. Here we show that the detrimental effect of excessive Ppz1 expression is due to an increase in its phosphatase activity and not to a plausible down-titration of the PPC decarboxylase components. We have identified several genes encoding ribosomal proteins and ribosome assembly factors as mild high-copy suppressors of the toxic Ppz1 effect. Ppz1 binds to ribosomes engaged in translation and copurifies with diverse ribosomal proteins and translation factors. Ppz1 overexpression results in Gcn2-dependent increased phosphorylation of eIF2α at Ser-51. Consistently, deletion of GCN2 partially suppresses the growth defect of a Ppz1 overexpressing strain. We propose that the deleterious effects of Ppz1 overexpression are in part due to alteration in normal protein synthesis.

Abstract: The presence, biosynthesis and functional role of sterols in the green microalga Haematococcus pluvialis remain poorly understood. In this work we studied the effect of high-light (HL) stress on sterol synthesis in H. pluvialis UTEX 2505 cells. HL stress induced the synthesis of sterols in parallel with that of triacylglycerides (TAG), giving rise to the synthesis of cholesterol over that of phytosterols. Blockage of the carotenogenic 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (MEP) pathway is shown to be involved in HL-induced sterol synthesis. In addition, high irradiance exposure induced MEP- and fatty acid (FA)-biosynthetic transcripts. The pharmacological inhibition of these pathways suggests a possible feedback regulation of sterol and FA homeostasis. Finally, both lipid classes proved crucial to the adequate photosynthetic performance of H. pluvialis grown under HL intensity stress. Our findings reveal new insights into H. pluvialis lipid metabolism that contribute to the development of value-added bioproducts from microalgae.

Abstract: The heart contains an abundant fibroblast population that may play a role in homeostasis, by maintaining the extracellular matrix (ECM) network, by regulating electrical impulse conduction, and by supporting survival and function of cardiomyocytes and vascular cells. Despite an explosion in our understanding of the role of fibroblasts in cardiac injury, the homeostatic functions of resident fibroblasts in adult hearts remain understudied. TGF-β-mediated signaling through the receptor-activated Smads, Smad2 and Smad3 critically regulates fibroblast function. We hypothesized that baseline expression of Smad2/3 in fibroblasts may play an important role in cardiac homeostasis. Smad2 and Smad3 were constitutively expressed in normal mouse hearts and in cardiac fibroblasts. In cultured cardiac fibroblasts, Smad2 and Smad3 played distinct roles in regulation of baseline ECM gene synthesis. Smad3 knockdown attenuated collagen I, collagen IV and fibronectin mRNA synthesis and reduced expression of the matricellular protein thrombospondin-1. Smad2 knockdown on the other hand attenuated expression of collagen V mRNA and reduced synthesis of fibronectin, periostin and versican. In vivo, inducible fibroblast-specific Smad2 knockout mice and fibroblast-specific Smad3 knockout mice had normal heart rate, preserved cardiac geometry, ventricular systolic and diastolic function, and normal myocardial structure. Fibroblast-specific Smad3, but not Smad2 loss modestly but significantly reduced collagen content. Our findings suggest that fibroblast-specific Smad3, but not Smad2, may play a role in regulation of baseline collagen synthesis in adult hearts. However, at least short term, these changes do not have any impact on homeostatic cardiac function.

Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a therapy recalcitrant disease characterized by the aberrations in multiple genes that drive pathogenesis and drug chemoresistance. In this study, we synthesize a library of seven novel nitric oxide-releasing gemcitabine pro-drugs (NO-GEMs) in order to improve the effectiveness of GEM by exploiting the therapeutic effects of NO. Among these NO-GEM pro-drugs we select 5b as the most effective compound in GEM-resistant PDAC cells. After its encapsulation in liposomes for drug delivery the intracellular NO level increases and nitration associated to activity inhibition of the multidrug resistance associated protein 5 (MRP5; ABCC5) occurs. This results in GEM intracellular accumulation and enhanced apoptotic cell death in GEM-resistant PDAC cells, which express MRP5 at higher levels than GEM-sensitive cells. Our results support the development of a new anti-tumoral strategy to efficiently affect GEM-resistant PDAC cells based on the usage of NO-GEM pro-drugs.

Abstract: Pontin, a member of the AAA+ ATPase family, plays important roles in a variety of cellular processes, including transcription regulation, DNA damage response, telomerase activity, and cellular transformation. In the previous studies, Pontin deletion in mice was lethal to embryos. Here, we demonstrate that the depletion of Pontin induced cellular senescence in mouse and human fibroblasts as well as in mouse epidermal keratinocytes. Fibroblast cells with Pontin depletion exhibited a defect in cell proliferation without showing apoptosis. Instead, they exhibited senescence-associated phenotypes including increased senescence-associated-β-galactosidase activity, elevated levels of p16INK4, and senescence-associated secretory phenotypes. Furthermore, conditional deletion of the Pontin gene in epidermal keratinocytes led to abnormal epidermal stratification, which was accompanied by the induction of senescence in Pontin-lacking cells. We found that Pontin depletion induced a spontaneous DNA damage response, which may be a cause of senescence. Contrary to the behavior of normal cells, Pontin depletion in several cancer cells caused apoptotic cell death without exhibiting senescence phenotypes.

Abstract: Preclinical lung cancer models are essential for a basic understanding of lung cancer biology and its translation into efficient treatment options for affected patients. Lung cancer cell lines and xenografts derived directly from human lung tumors have proven highly valuable in fundamental oncology research and anticancer drug discovery. Both models inherently comprise advantages and caveats that have to be accounted for. Recently, we have enabled reliable in vitro culture techniques from lung cancer biopsies as Patients Lung Derived Tumoroids (PLDTs). This breakthrough provides the possibility of high-throughput drug screening covering the spectrum of lung cancer phenotypes seen clinically. We have adapted and optimized our in vitro three-dimensional model as a preclinical lung cancer model to recapitulate the tumor microenvironment (TME) using matrix reconstitution. Hence, we developed directly PLDTs to screen for chemotherapeutics and radiation treatment. This original model will enable precision medicine to become a reality, allowing a given patient sample to be screened for effective ex vivo therapeutics, aiming at tailoring of treatments specific to that individual. Hence, this tool can enhance clinical outcomes and avoid morbidity due to ineffective therapies.

Abstract: RNA editing has emerged as a novel mechanism in cancer progression. The double stranded RNA-specific adenosine deaminase (ADAR) modifies the expression of an important proportion of genes involved in cell cycle control, DNA damage response (DDR) and transcriptional processing, suggesting an important role of ADAR in transcriptome regulation. Despite the phenotypic implications of ADAR deregulation in several cancer models, the role of ADAR on DDR and proliferation in breast cancer has not been fully addressed. Here, we show that ADAR expression correlates significantly with clinical outcomes and DDR, cell cycle and proliferation mRNAs of previously reported edited transcripts in breast cancer patients. ADAR's knock-down in a breast cancer cell line produces stability changes of mRNAs involved in DDR and DNA replication. Breast cancer cells with reduced levels of ADAR show a decreased viability and an increase in apoptosis, displaying a significant decrease of their DDR activation, compared to control cells. These results suggest that ADAR plays an important role in breast cancer progression through the regulation of mRNA stability and expression of those genes involved in proliferation and DDR impacting the viability of breast cancer cells.

Abstract: The galectin LGALS1 is a glycan binding protein that regulates intracellular (e.g. signal transduction) and extracellular processes (e.g. immunity, leukocyte mobilization) that support cell survival. The protein is best known for its role in RAS signaling. LGALS1 is important in acute lymphoblastic leukemia but its role in acute myeloid leukemia is not well defined. We previously found suppression of LGALS1 in AML cell lines OCI-AML3 and THP-1 sensitized both cell lines to BCL2 inhibitor ABT-737. In this study, we used an in vivo murine OCI-AML3 xenograft model to test whether reduction expression of LGALS1 affects survival. Mice bearing the OCI-AML3 cells with LGALS1 shRNA survived significantly longer than mice with control OCI-AML3 cells. Gene expression profiling using RNASeq was performed using the control and LGALS1 shRNA of p53 WT OCI-AML3 and p53 mutant THP-1 cells. The data reveal distinct differences between the two cell lines in number of genes affected, in pathways associated with these genes, in expression of oncogenes, and in the transcription factors involved. The p53 pathway is prominent in OCI-AML3 cells. An examination of LGALS1 mRNA in an AML patient population reveals elevated LGALS1 mRNA is associated with shorter disease free survival and increased blasts in the BM. This data with the xenograft model data presented suggest LGALS1 may be important in the AML microenvironment. In summary, the data presented here suggest that a strategy targeting LGALS1 may benefit AML patients.

Abstract: Glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3β) is an enzyme with a variety of cellular functions in addition to the regulation of glycogen metabolism. In the central nervous system, different intracellular signaling pathways converge on GSK-3β through a cascade of phosphorylation events that ultimately control a broad range of neuronal functions in the development and adulthood. In mice, genetically removing or increasing GSK-3β cause distinct functional and structural neuronal phenotypes and consequently affect cognition. Precise control of GSK-3β activity is important for such processes as neuronal migration, development of neuronal morphology, synaptic plasticity, excitability, and gene expression. Altered GSK-3β activity contributes to aberrant plasticity within neuronal circuits leading to neurological, psychiatric disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. Therapeutically targeting GSK-3β can restore the aberrant plasticity of neuronal networks at least in animal models of these diseases. Although the complete repertoire of GSK-3β neuronal substrates has not been defined, emerging evidence shows that different ion channels and their accessory proteins controlling excitability, neurotransmitter release, and synaptic transmission are regulated by GSK-3β, thereby supporting mechanisms of synaptic plasticity in cognition. Dysregulation of ion channel function by defective GSK-3β activity sustains abnormal excitability in the development of epilepsy and other GSK-3β-linked human diseases.

Abstract: Prostate apoptosis response-4 (Par-4) is a tumor suppressor protein that selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells. Although the mechanism of Par-4-mediated induction of apoptosis has been well studied, the involvement of Par-4 in other mechanisms of cell death such as autophagy is unclear. We investigated the mechanism involved in Par-4-mediated autophagic cell death in human malignant glioma. We demonstrate for the first time that the tumor suppressor lipid, ceramide (Cer), causes Par-4 induction, leading to autophagic cell death in human malignant glioma. Furthermore, we identified the tumor suppressor protein p53 and BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) as downstream targets of Par-4 during Cer-mediated autophagic cell death. RNAi-mediated down-regulation of Par-4 blocks Cer-induced p53-BNIP3 activation and autophagic cell death, while upregulation of Par-4 augmented p53-BNIP3 activation and autophagic cell death. Remarkably, in many instances, Par-4 overexpression alone was sufficient to induce cell death which is associated with features of autophagy. Interestingly, similar results were seen when glioma cells were exposed to classical autophagy inducers such as serum starvation, arsenic trioxide, and curcumin. Collectively, the novel Par-4-p53-BNIP3 axis plays a crucial role in autophagy-mediated cell death in human malignant glioma.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most often diagnosed cancers globally. MicroRNAs are small RNA molecules that play essential roles in tumorigenesis and progression of CRC. Here we evaluated the effects of miR-141-3p on growth, cetuximab sensitivity, migration and invasion of CRC cells. We found that miR-141-3p negatively regulated the proliferation, migration and invasion in CRC cells. In addition, miR-141-3p enhanced the cetuximab sensitivity of CRC cells by EGFR suppression. Moreover, miR-141-3p improved cetuximab-induced apoptosis in CRC cells. Furthermore, miR-141-3p altered the expression of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, snail and Vimentin, indicating miR-141-3p might play a role on epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Luciferase reporter assay showed that EGFR was the direct binding site of miR-141-3p and the expression levels of p-EGFR, Raf-1, pAKT and p-ERK1/2 were regulated by miR-141-3p. After down-regulation of EGFR by siRNA in CRC cells, the effects of miR-141-3p on proliferation, migration and invasion were reversed. miR-141-3p played important roles in CRC growth and response to cetuximab treatment, and might function as a potential biomarker to predict cetuximab response.

Abstract: FPR2, a member of the family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), mediates neutrophil migration, a response that has been linked to β-arrestin recruitment. β-Arrestin regulates GPCR endocytosis and can also elicit non-canonical receptor signaling. To determine the poorly understood role of β-arrestin in FPR2 endocytosis and in NADPH-oxidase activation in neutrophils, Barbadin was used as a research tool in this study. Barbadin has been shown to bind the clathrin adaptor protein (AP2) and thereby prevent β-arrestin/AP2 interaction and β-arrestin-mediated GPCR endocytosis. In agreement with this, AP2/β-arrestin interaction induced by an FPR2-specific agonist was inhibited by Barbadin. Unexpectedly, however, Barbadin did not inhibit FPR2 endocytosis, indicating that a mechanism independent of β-arrestin/AP2 interaction may sustain FPR2 endocytosis. This was confirmed by the fact, that FPR2 also underwent agonist-promoted endocytosis in β-arrestin deficient cells, albeit at a diminished level as compared to wild type cells. Dissection of the Barbadin effects on FPR2-mediated neutrophil functions including NADPH-oxidase activation mediated release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and chemotaxis revealed that Barbadin had no effect on chemotactic migration whereas the release of ROS was potentiated/primed. The effect of Barbadin on ROS production was reversible, independent of β-arrestin recruitment, and similar to that induced by latrunculin A. Taken together, our data demonstrate that endocytic uptake of FPR2 occurs independently of β-arrestin, while Barbadin selectively augments FPR2-mediated ROS production independently of receptor endocytosis. Given that Barbadin binds to AP2 and prevents the AP2/β-arrestin interaction, our results indicate a role for AP2 in FPR2-mediated ROS release from neutrophils.

Abstract: Acquired multidrug resistance of cancer cells challenges the chemotherapeutic interventions. To understand the role of molecular chaperone, Hsp90 in drug adapted tumor cells, we have used in vitro drug adapted epidermoid tumor cells as a model system. We found that chemotherapeutic drug adaptation of tumor cells is mediated by induced activities of both Hsp90 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Although the high-affinity conformation of Hsp90 has correlated with the enhanced drug efflux activity, we did not observe a direct interaction between P-gp and Hsp90. The enrichment of P-gp and Hsp90 at the cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains is found obligatory for enhanced drug efflux activity. Since inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis is not interfering with the drug efflux activity, it is presumed that the net cholesterol redistribution mediated by Hsp90 regulates the enhanced drug efflux activity. Our in vitro cholesterol and Hsp90 interaction studies have furthered our presumption that Hsp90 facilitates cholesterol redistribution. The drug adapted cells though exhibited anti-proliferative and anti-tumor effects in response to 17AAG treatment, drug treatment has also enhanced the drug efflux activity. Our findings suggest that drug efflux activity and metastatic potential of tumor cells are independently regulated by Hsp90 by distinct mechanisms. We expose the limitations imposed by Hsp90 inhibitors against multidrug resistant tumor cells.

Abstract: The cytoskeleton is a complex network of interconnected biopolymers intimately involved in the generation and transmission of forces. Several mechanical properties of microtubules and actin filaments have been extensively explored in cells. In contrast, intermediate filaments (IFs) received comparatively less attention despite their central role in defining cell shape, motility and adhesion during physiological processes as well as in tumor progression. Here, we explored relevant biophysical properties of vimentin IFs in living cells combining confocal microscopy and a filament tracking routine that allows localizing filaments with ~20 nm precision. A Fourier-based analysis showed that IFs curvatures followed a thermal-like behavior characterized by an apparent persistence length (lp*) similar to that measured in aqueous solution. Additionally, we determined that certain perturbations of the cytoskeleton affect lp* and the lateral mobility of IFs as assessed in cells in which either the microtubule dynamic instability was reduced or actin filaments were partially depolymerized. Our results provide relevant clues on how vimentin IFs mechanically couple with microtubules and actin filaments in cells and support a role of this network in the response to mechanical stress.

Abstract: The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a ubiquitously expressed multifunctional G protein-coupled receptor. Several studies reported that the CaSR plays an anti-inflammatory and anti-tumorigenic role in the intestine, and that it is down-regulated during colorectal carcinogenesis. We hypothesized that positive allosteric CaSR modulators (type II calcimimetics) selectively targeting the intestinal cells could be used for the treatment of intestinal pathologies. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the effect of pharmacological stimulation of CaSR on gene expression in vitro and on tumor growth in vivo. We stably transduced two colon cancer cell lines (HT29 and Caco2) with lentiviral vectors containing either the CaSR fused to GFP or GFP only. Using RNA sequencing, RT-qPCR experiments and ELISA, we determined that CaSR over-expression itself had generally little effect on gene expression in these cells. However, treatment with 1 μM of the calcimimetic NPS R-568 increased the expression of pro-inflammatory factors such as IL-23α and IL-8 and reduced the transcription of various differentiation markers in the cells over-expressing the CaSR. In vivo, neither the presence of the CaSR nor p.o. treatment of the animals with the calcimimetic cinacalcet affected tumor growth, tumor cell proliferation or tumor vascularization of murine HT29 xenografts. In summary, CaSR stimulation in CaSR over-expressing cells enhanced the expression of inflammatory markers in vitro, but was not able to repress colorectal cancer tumorigenicity in vivo. These findings suggest potential pro-inflammatory effects of the CaSR and type II calcimimetics in the intestine.

Abstract: Epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) in development, tissue repair and carcinogenesis involves cellular plasticity with varying degrees of epithelial and mesenchymal properties. Several recent studies have focused on EMT phenotypic dynamism; however, information on cellular interaction in the context of EMT is inadequate. In our previous study, we investigated EMT phenotypic plasticity and anticipated it as a population driven interactive process. Present study has characterized cellular connectivity as a representative of interactivity during EMT in epithelial normal and cancer cell. It has also explored dynamism of connectivity and phenotype employing Markov model. Further, plasticity was substantiated with cell surface microvilli and molecular marker. The study unveiled interplay between phenotype and connectivity too. Findings have revealed that intercellular connectivity fueled EMT plasticity and its dynamism was more prominent in cancer population. However, normal cells are more vibrant in transition and phenotypic plasticity. We have proposed connectivity plasticity as a hallmark of EMT and needs to be studied in depth. Present study also paves the way in translating in vitro EMT findings in histopathological practices.

Abstract: Lipoxygenases (ALOX) are lipid peroxidizing enzymes that catalyze the biosynthesis of pro- and anti-inflammatory lipid mediators and have been implicated in (patho-)physiological processes. In humans, six functional ALOX isoforms exist and their arachidonic acid oxygenation products have been characterized. Products include leukotrienes and lipoxins which are involved in the regulation of inflammation and resolution. Oxygenation of n3-polyunsaturated fatty acids gives rise to specialized pro-resolving mediators, e.g. resolvins. However, the catalytic activity of different ALOX isoforms can lead to a multitude of potentially bioactive products. Here, we characterized the patterns of oxygenation products formed by human recombinant ALOX5, ALOX15, ALOX15B and ALOX12 from eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and its 18-hydroxy derivative 18-HEPE with particular emphasis on double and triple oxygenation products. ALOX15 and ALOX5 formed a complex mixture of various double oxygenation products from EPA, which include 5,15-diHEPE and various 8,15-diHEPE isomers. Their biosynthetic mechanisms were explored using heavy oxygen isotopes (H218O, 18O2 gas) and three catalytic activities contributed to product formation: i) fatty acid oxygenase activity, ii) leukotriene synthase activity, iii) lipohydroperoxidase activity. For ALOX15B and ALOX12 more specific product patterns were identified, which was also the case when these enzymes reacted in concert with ALOX5. Several double oxygenated compounds were formed from 18-HEPE by ALOX5, ALOX15B and ALOX12 including previously identified resolvins (RvE2, RvE3), while formation of triple oxygenation products, e.g. 5,17,18-triHEPE, required ALOX5. Taken together our data show that EPA can be converted by human ALOX isoforms to a large number of secondary oxygenation products, which might exhibit bioactivity.

Abstract: Aim
To estimate the blood level of Erythropoietin(EPO) in neonates with anemia of prematurity (APO) and in late hypo-regenerative anemia and to clarify role of EPO in correction of anemia and reducing the number of blood transfusions.
Methods
This study was carried out on 60 neonates divided into; group I (30 preterm neonates) with AOP received EPO (250 IU/kg/dose subcutaneously 3 times weekly for 4 weeks), compared to group II (30 neonates) with AOP treated only with blood transfusion. CBC parameters and transfusion requirements were followed during therapy. Serum level of EPO was measured by ELISA technique.
Results
By the end of the 4th week of therapy, there was significant increase in group I post r-Hu EPO compared to group II regarding reticulocyte counts (P < 0.001) leading to rise of the Hb (P < 0.001), Hct levels (P < 0.001) with subsequent reduction in the overall number of blood transfusions (P < 0.001).
Conclusion
EPO therapy in conjunction with iron, vitamin E and folic acid, stimulated erythropoiesis and significantly reduced the need for blood transfusion in AOP.

Abstract: The formation of extensions in cell migration requires tightly coordinated reorganization of all three cytoskeletal polymers but the mechanisms by which intermediate filament networks interact with actin to generate extensions are not well-defined. We examined interactions of the actin binding protein filamin A (FLNA) with vimentin in extension formation by fibroblasts. Knockdown (KD) of vimentin in fibroblasts reduced the lengths of cell extensions by 50% (p < 0.001). After cell binding to fibronectin, there was a time-dependent increase of phosphorylation of serine 39, 56 and 72 in vimentin, which was associated with vimentin filament assembly. Of the FLNA-interacting kinases that could phosphorylate vimentin, we focused on PAK1, which we found by reciprocal immunoprecipitation associated with FLNA. Enzyme inhibitor studies and siRNA KD demonstrated that PAK1 was required for vimentin phosphorylation and formation of cell extensions. In sedimentation assays, vimentin was exclusively detected in the insoluble pellet fraction of cells expressing FLNA while in FLNA KD cells there was increased vimentin in the supernatants of FLN KD cells. Compared with wild type, FLNA KD cells showed loss of phosphorylation of serine 56 and 72 in vimentin and reduced numbers and lengths of cell extensions by >4-fold. We suggest that the association of PAK1 with FLNA enables vimentin phosphorylation and filament assembly, which are important in the development and stabilization of cell extensions during cell migration.

Abstract: The Drosophila Slimb (Slmb) gene encodes a Skp1-Cul1-F-box (SCP) E3 ubiquitin ligase orthologous to the human β-TrCP/BTRC protein. Slmb and/or BTRC play regulatory roles in numerous biological processes by ubiquitinating several substrate proteins which are then targeted for proteasomal degradation. Here, we demonstrate an additional role for Slmb in maintaining cellular copper homeostasis. In the thorax, midgut and eye, Slmb knockdown causes copper deficiency phenotypes which can be rescued by increasing cellular copper levels via decreased efflux or increased uptake. Furthermore, Slmb knockdown results in decreased levels of the copper transporters Ctr1A and ATP7, indicating Slmb is required to regulate copper homeostasis. We also present evidence that the transcription factor Cap-n-Collar (Nrf2 in mammals), a known substrate of Slmb/BTRC, mediates Slmb's regulatory effect on Ctr1A in a post-transcriptional manner.

Abstract: Ca2+-activated potassium (KCa) channels of small and intermediate conductance influence proliferation, apoptosis, and cell metabolism. We analysed whether prolonged activation of KCa channels by zoxazolamine (ZOX) induces differentiation of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells towards cardiomyocytes. ZOX treatment of ES cells dose-dependent increased the number and diameter of cardiac foci, the frequency of contractions as well as mRNA expression of the cardiac transcription factor Nkx-2.5, the cardiac markers cardiac troponin I (cTnI), α-myosin heavy chain (α-MHC), ventricular myosin light chain-2 (MLC2v), and the pacemaker hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated 4 channel (HCN4). ZOX induced hyperpolarization of membrane potential due to activation of IKCa, raised intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and nitric oxide (NO) in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The Ca2+ response to ZOX was inhibited by chelation of Ca2+ with BAPTA-AM, release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores by thapsigargin and the phospholipase C (PLC) antagonist U73,122. Moreover, the ZOX-induced Ca2+ response was blunted by the purinergic receptor antagonist pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonic acid (PPADS) as well as the specific P2Y1 antagonist MRS 2,179, suggesting purinergic receptor-stimulated signal transduction. Consequently, ZOX initiated ATP release from differentiating ES cells, which was inhibited by the chloride channel inhibitor NPPB and the gap junction inhibitor carbenoxolone (CBX). The stimulation of cardiomyogenesis by ZOX was blunted by the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor l-NAME, as well as CBX and NPPB. In summary, our data suggest that ZOX enhances cardiomyogenesis of ES cells by ATP release presumably through gap junctional hemichannels, purinergic receptor activation and intracellular Ca2+ response, thus promoting NO generation.

Abstract: ATP-dependent intracellular proteolysis is essential for all living organisms. ClpP, the proteolytic subunit of the ATP-dependent Clp proteases, shares 56% protein identity between B. subtilis and man. The aim of this study was to verify, whether human ClpP (HClpP) is able to substitute the bacterial pendant, BClpP, irrespectively of the huge evolutionary distance. For this reason hclpP was expressed from the natural B. subtilis promoters at the original chromosomal site. Growth at 37 °C as well as sporulation in the presence of hclpP depict an intermediate phenotype between wild type and clpP mutant suggesting a partial functional substitution of BClpP by HClpP. Northern as well as Western blot analyses show a similar induction pattern of both, bclpP and hclpP during heat stress on the mRNA as well as on the protein levels. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments imply specific interaction of HClpP with bacterial ClpC, ClpX and ClpE during control as well as heat stress conditions. Radioactive pulse-chase labeling and immunoprecipitation revealed that a ClpXP substrate, the short-living regulatory protein MgsR, is degraded by HClpP, although with an extremely slower rate in comparison to BClpP. The occurrence of an exceptional thickened cell wall of a clpP mutant can be almost fully reversed by the complementation with HClpP. The utilization of the HClpP expressing strain as a test system for new biological or synthetic active substances targeting BClpP is discussed.

Abstract: Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), the most common thyroid malignancy, has a strong propensity for neck lymph node metastasis, which will increase the risk of local recurrence and decrease the survival in some high-risk groups. Hence, it is essential to set up a reliable biomarker to predict lymph node metastasis. BAG5 is a unique member of the BAG cochaperone family because it consists of more than one BAG domain, which acts as modulator of chaperone activity. In this study, we found that expression of BAG5 was significantly increased in PTC cells and tissues. Neither overexpression nor downregulation of BAG5 altered the proliferation of PTC cells. On the contrary, overexpression of BAG5 significantly promoted, while knockdown of BAG5 significantly decreased migration and invasion of PTC cells. Along with this, fibronectin 1 (FN1) was significantly increased and decreased in cells that overexpress or downregulate BAG5, respectively. Mechanistically, we found that BAG5 modulated FN1 expression at the translational level and promoted invasion via suppression of miR-144-3p, which targeted the 3′ untranslational region (UTR) of FN1 transcript. This study suggests that BAG5 is an important regulator of migration and invasion in PTC cells and may represent a novel therapeutic target for intervening in PTC progression.

Highly conserved amino acid residues in apolipoprotein A1 discordantly induce high density lipoprotein assembly in vitro and in vivo,

Abstract: Objective
Apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1) is essential to reverse cholesterol transport, a physiologically important process that protects against atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. APOA1 is a 28 kDa protein comprising multiple lipid-binding amphiphatic helices initialized by proline residues, which are conserved across multiple species. We tested the hypothesis that the evolutionarily conserved residues are essential to high density lipoprotein (HDL) function.
Approach
We used biophysical and physiological assays of the function of APOA1P➔A variants, i.e., rHDL formation via dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) microsolubilization, activation of lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase, cholesterol efflux from human monocyte-derived macrophages (THP-1) to each variant, and comparison of the size and composition of HDL from APOA1−/− mice receiving adeno-associated virus delivery of each human variant.
Results
Differences in microsolubilization were profound and showed that conserved prolines, especially those in the C-terminus of APOA1, are essential to efficient rHDL formation. In contrast, P➔A substitutions produced small changes (−25 to +25%) in rates of cholesterol efflux and no differences in the rates of LCAT activation. The HDL particles formed following ectopic expression of each variant in APOA1−/− mice were smaller and more heterogeneous than those from control animals.
Conclusion
Studies of DMPC microsolubilization show that proline residues are essential to the optimal interaction of APOA1 with membranes, the initial step in cholesterol efflux and HDL production. In contrast, P➔A substitutions modestly reduce the cholesterol efflux capacity of APOA1, have no effect on LCAT activation, but according to the profound reduction in the size of HDL formed in vivo, P➔A substitutions alter HDL biogenesis, thereby implicating other cellular and in vivo processes as determinants of HDL metabolism and function.

Abstract: Background
Osteoarthritis is caused by cartilage dysplasia and has fetal origin. Prenatal dexamethasone exposure (PDE) induced chondrodysplasia in fetal rats by inhibiting transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling. This study aimed to determine the effect of dexamethasone on fetal cartilage development and illustrate the underlying molecular mechanism.
Methods
Dexamethasone (0.2 mg/kg.d) was injected subcutaneously every morning in pregnant rats from gestational day (GD) 9 to GD21. Harvested fetal femurs and tibias at GD21 for immunofluorescence and gene expression analysis. Fetal chondrocytes were treated with dexamethasone (100, 250 and 500 nM), endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) inhibitor, and ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR1) antagonist for subsequent analyses.
Results
In vivo, prenatal dexamethasone exposure (PDE) decreased the total length of the fetal cartilage, the proportion of the proliferation area and the cell density and matrix content in fetal articular cartilage. Moreover, PDE increased RYR1 expression and intracellular calcium levels and elevated the expression of ERS-related genes, while downregulated the TGFβ signaling pathway and extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis in fetal chondrocytes. In vitro, we verified dexamethasone significantly decreased ECM synthesis through activating RYR 1 mediated-ERS.
Conclusions
PDE inhibited TGFβ signaling pathway and matrix synthesis through RYR1 / intracellular calcium mediated ERS, which ultimately led to fetal dysplasia. This study confirmed the molecular mechanism of ERS involved in the developmental toxicity of dexamethasone and suggested that RYR1 may be an early intervention target for fetal-derived adult osteoarthritis.

Abstract: Cardiotoxicity is a highly relevant, because often life-threatening, adverse effect of doxorubicin (Doxo)-based anticancer therapy. Here, we investigated the Doxo-response of cardiovascular stem/progenitor cells employing a mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC)-based in vitro differentiation model. Endothelial progenitor cells revealed a pronounced Doxo sensitivity as compared to mESC, differentiated endothelial-like (EC) and cardiomyocyte-like cells (CM) and CM progenitors, which rests on the activation of senescence. Doxo treatment of EC progenitors altered protein expression of individual endothelial markers, actin cytoskeleton morphology, mRNA expression of genes related to mitochondrial functions, autophagy, apoptosis, and DNA repair as well as mitochondrial DNA content, respiration and ATP production in the surviving differentiated EC progeny. By contrast, LDL uptake, ATP-stimulated Ca2+ release, and cytokine-stimulated ICAM-1 expression remained unaffected by the anthracycline treatment. Thus, exposure of EC progenitors to Doxo elicits isolated and persistent dysfunctions in the surviving EC progeny. In conclusion, we suggest that Doxo-induced injury of EC progenitors adds to anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity, making this cell-type a preferential target for pharmacoprotective and regenerative strategies.

Abstract: Red blood cells (RBC) are constantly exposed to varying mechanical forces while traversing the cardiovascular system. Upon exposure to mechanical stimuli (e.g., shear stress), calcium enters the cell and prompts potassium-efflux. Efflux of potassium is accompanied by a loss of intracellular fluid; thus, the volume of RBC decreases proportionately (i.e., ‘Gárdos effect’). The mechanical properties of the cell are subsequently impacted due to complex interactions between cytosolic viscosity (dependent on cell hydration), the surface-area-to-volume ratio, and other molecular processes. The dynamic effects of calcium on RBC mechanics are yet to be elucidated, although accumulating evidence suggests a vital role. The present study thus examined the effects of calcium on contemporary biomechanical properties of RBC in conjunction with high-precision geometrical analyses with exposure to shear. Mechanical stimulation of RBC was performed using a co-axial Couette shearing system to deform the cell membrane; intracellular signaling events were observed via fluorescent imaging. Calcium was introduced into RBC using ionophore A23187. Increased intracellular calcium significantly impaired RBC deformability; these impairments were mediated by a calcium-induced reduction of cell volume through the Gárdos channel. Extracellular calcium in the absence of the ionophore only had an effect under shear, not at stasis. Under low shear, the presence of extracellular calcium induced progressive lysis of a sub-population of RBC; all remaining RBC exhibited exceptional capacity to deform, implying preferential removal of potentially aged cells. Collectively, we provide evidence of the mechanism by which calcium acutely regulates RBC mechanical properties.

Abstract: Regulation of metabolism is emerging as a major output of circadian clock circuitry in mammals. Accordingly, mitochondrial oxidative metabolism undergoes both in vivo and in vitro daily oscillatory activities. In a previous study we showed that both glycolysis and mitochondrial oxygen consumption display a similar time-resolved rhythmic activity in synchronized HepG2 cell cultures, which translates in overall bioenergetic changes as here documented by measurement of the ATP level. Treatment of synchronized cells with specific metabolic inhibitors unveiled pyruvate as a major source of reducing equivalents to the respiratory chain with its oxidation driven by the rhythmic (de)phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase. Further investigation enabled to causally link the autonomous cadenced mitochondrial respiration to a synchronous increase of the mitochondrial Ca2+. The rhythmic change of the mitochondrial respiration was dampened by inhibitors of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter as well as of the ryanodine receptor Ca2+ channel or the ADPR cyclase, indicating that the mitochondrial Ca2+ influx originated from the ER store, likely at contact sites with the mitochondrial compartment. Notably, blockage of the mitochondrial Ca2+ influx resulted in deregulation of the expression of canonical clock genes such as BMALl1, CLOCK, NR1D1. All together our findings unveil a hitherto unexplored function of Ca2+-mediated signaling in time keeping the mitochondrial metabolism and in its feed-back modulation of the circadian clockwork.

Abstract: Alternative splicing enables G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) genes to greatly increase the number of structurally and functionally distinct receptor isoforms. However, the functional role and relevance of the individual GPCR splice variants in regulating physiological processes are still to be assessed. A naturally occurring alternative splice variant of Bombyx CAPA-PVK receptor, BomCAPA-PVK-R1-Δ341, has been shown to act as a dominant-negative protein to regulate cell surface expression and function of the canonical CAPA-PVK receptor. Herein, using functional assays, we identify the splice variant Δ341 as a specific receptor for neuropeptide CAPA-PK, and upon activation, Δ341 signals to ERK1/2 pathway. Further characterization demonstrates that Δ341 couples to Gαi/o, distinct from the Gαq-coupled canonical CAPA-PVK receptor, triggering ERK1/2 phosphorylation through Gβγ-PI3K-PKCζ signaling cascade. Moreover, our ELISA data show that the ligand-dependent internalization of the splice variant Δ341 is significantly impaired due to lack of GRKs-mediated phosphorylation sites. Our findings highlight the potential of this knowledge for molecular, pharmacological and physiological studies on GPCR splice variants in the future.

Abstract: The ability of hemoglobin (Hb) to transport respiratory gases is directly linked to its quaternary structure properties and reversible changes between T (tense) and R (relax) state. In this study we demonstrated that packed red blood cells (pRBCs) storage resulted in a gradual increase in the irreversible changes in the secondary and quaternary structures of Hb, with subsequent impairment of the T↔R transition. Such alteration was associated with the presence of irreversibly settled in the relaxed form, quaternary structure of Hb, which we termed R′. On the secondary structure level, disordered protein organization involved formation of β-sheets and a decrease in α-helices related to the aggregation process stabilized by strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Compensatory changes in RBCs metabolism launched to preserve reductive microenvironment were disclosed as an activation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) production and increased reduced to oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) ratio. For the first time we showed the relationship between secondary structure changes and the occurrence of newly discovered R′, which through an artificial increase in oxyhemoglobin level altered Hb ability to bind and release oxygen.

Abstract: Background
Our previous study suggested that palmitate (PA) induces human glomerular mesangial cells (HMCs) fibrosis. However, the mechanism is not fully understood. Recent studies suggested that transient receptor potential canonical channel 6 (TRPC6)/nuclear factor of activated T cell 2 (NFAT2) played an important role in renal fibrosis. Moreover, cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) regulated the synthesis of TPRC6 agonist diglyceride. In the present study, we investigated whether PA induced HMCs fibrosis via TRPC6/NFAT2 mediated by CD36.
Methods
A type 2 diabetic nephropathy (DN) model was established in Sprague Dawley rats, and HMCs were stimulated with PA. Lipid accumulation and free fatty acid (FFA) uptake were measured. The expression levels of TGF-β1, p-Smad2/3, FN, TRPC6, NFAT2 and CD36 were evaluated. The intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) was assessed.
Results
FFA were elevated in type 2 DN rats with kidney fibrosis in addition to NFAT2 and CD36 expression. In vitro, PA induced HMCs fibrosis, [Ca2+]i elevation and NFAT2 activation. SKF96365 or TRPC6-siRNA could attenuate PA-induced HMCs damage. By contrast, the TRPC6 activator showed the opposite effect. Moreover, NFAT2-siRNA also suppressed PA-induced HMCs fibrosis. CD36 knockdown inhibited the PA-induced [Ca2+]i elevation and NFAT2 expression. In addition, long-term treatment with PA decreased TRPC6 expression in HMCs.
Conclusion
The results of this study demonstrated that PA could induce the activation of the [Ca2+]i/NFAT2 signaling pathway through TRPC6, which led to HMCs fibrosis. Although activation of TRPC6 attributed to CD36-mediated lipid deposition, long-term stimulation of PA may lead to negative feedback on the expression of TPRC6.

Abstract: The endothelium contributes to the pathophysiology of adverse effects caused by conventional (genotoxic) anticancer therapeutics (cAT). The relevance of structurally different types of cAT-induced DNA lesions for eliciting selected endothelial stress responses is largely unknown. Here, we analyzed the cAT-induced formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), transcription blockage and DNA damage response (DDR) in time kinetic analyses employing a monolayer of primary human endothelial cells (HUVEC). We observed that the degree of cAT-induced transcription blockage, the number of DSB and activation of DDR-related factors diverge. For instance, ionizing radiation caused the formation of numerous DSB and triggerd a substantial activation of ATM/Chk2 signaling, which however were not accompanied by a significant transcription inhibition. By contrast, the DNA cross-linking cAT cisplatin triggered a rapid and substantial blockage of transcription, which yet was not reflected by an appreciable number of DSB or increased levels of pATM/pChk2. In general, cAT-stimulated ATM-dependent phosphorylation of Kap1 (Ser824) and p53 (Ser15) reflected best cAT-induced transcription blockage. In conclusion, cAT-induced formation of DSB and profound activation of prototypical DDR factors is independent of the inhibition of RNA polymerase II-regulated transcription in an endothelial monolayer. We suggest that DSB formed directly or indirectly following cAT-treatment do not act as comprehensive triggers of superior signaling pathways shutting-down transcription while, at the same time, causing an appreciable stimulation of the DDR. Rather, it appears that distinct cAT-induced DNA lesions elicit diverging signaling pathways, which separately control transcription vs. DDR activity in the endothelium.

Abstract: Neutrophils are first responders in infection and inflammation. They are able to roll, adhere and transmigrate through the endothelium to reach the site of infection, where they fight pathogens through secretion of granule contents, production of reactive oxygen species, extrusion of neutrophil extracellular traps, and phagocytosis. In this study we explored the role of the non-receptor focal adhesion kinase Pyk2 in neutrophil adhesion and activation. Using a specific Pyk2 pharmacological inhibitor, PF-4594755, as well as Pyk2-deficient murine neutrophils, we found that Pyk2 is activated upon integrin αMβ2-mediated neutrophil adhesion to fibrinogen. This process is triggered by Src family kinases-mediated phosphorylation and supported by Pyk2 autophosphorylation on Y402. In neutrophil adherent to fibrinogen, Pyk2 activates PI3K-dependent pathways promoting the phosphorylation of Akt and of its downstream effector GSK3. Pyk2 also dynamically regulates MAP kinases in fibrinogen-adherent neutrophils, as it stimulates p38MAPK but negatively regulates ERK1/2. Pharmacological inhibition of Pyk2 significantly prevented adhesion of human neutrophils to fibrinogen, and neutrophils from Pyk2-knockout mice showed a reduced ability to adhere compared to wildtype cells. Accordingly, neutrophil adhesion to fibrinogen was reduced upon inhibition of p38MAPK but potentiated by ERK1/2 inhibition. Neutrophil adherent to fibrinogen, but not to polylysine, were able to produce ROS upon lipopolysaccharide challenge and ROS production was completely suppressed upon inhibition of Pyk2. By contrast PMA-induced ROS production by neutrophil adherent to either fibrinogen or polylysine was independent from Pyk2. Altogether these results demonstrate that Pyk2 is an important effector in the coordinated puzzle regulating neutrophil adhesion and activation.

Abstract: Bone remodeling is critical to maintain the quality of bone tissues and to heal bone tissue injury. Osteoclasts and osteoblasts are special types of cells involved in this event. In particular, the resorption activity of mature osteoclasts is required for the formation of new bones. Human small leucine zipper protein (sLZIP) is known to induce the osteoblast differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. However, the roles of sLZIP in osteoclast differentiation and bone remodeling have not been explored. In this study, we investigated the roles of sLZIP in regulating osteoclast formation and in the bone remodeling process using sLZIP transgenic (TG) mice. Tibiae from sLZIP TG mice contained more osteoclasts than those from wild type (WT) mice. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) from sLZIP TG mice showed increased differentiation into osteoclasts compared with BMM from WT mice. sLZIP bound to the promotor and induced the expression of nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1) and its target osteoclastogenic genes. To understand the role of sLZIP in bone remodeling, a bone-defect model was generated. Results of micro-CT scanning and histologic analysis demonstrated that sLZIP TG mice have faster bone formation during healing compared with WT mice. Notably, the soft callus around the defect area was replaced faster by hard callus in sLZIP TG mice than in WT mice. These findings suggest that sLZIP promotes osteoclast differentiation and plays an important role in bone remodeling.

Abstract: Manganese (Mn) plays an important role in many physiological processes. Nevertheless, Mn accumulation in the brain can cause a parkinsonian-like syndrome known as manganism. Unfortunately, the therapeutic options for this disease are scarce and of limited efficacy. For this reason, a great effort is being made to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in Mn toxicity in neuronal and glial cells. Even though evidence indicates that Mn activates autophagy in microglia, the consequences of this activation in cell death remain unknown. In this study, we demonstrated a key role of reactive oxygen species in Mn-induced damage in microglial cells. These species generated by Mn2+ induce lysosomal alterations, LMP, cathepsins release and cell death. Besides, we described for the first time the kinetic of Mn2+-induced autophagy in BV-2 microglial cells and its relevance to cell fate. We found that Mn promotes a time-dependent increase in LC3-II and p62 expression levels, suggesting autophagy activation. Possibly, cells trigger autophagy to neutralize the risks associated with lysosomal rupture. In addition, pre-treatment with both Rapamycin and Melatonin enhanced autophagy and retarded Mn2+ cytotoxicity. In summary, our results demonstrated that, despite the damage inflicted on a subset of lysosomes, the autophagic pathway plays a protective role in Mn-induced microglial cell death. We propose that 2 h Mn2+ exposure will not induce disturbances in the autophagic flux. However, as time passes, the accumulated damage inside the cell could trigger a dysfunction of this mechanism. These findings may represent a valuable contribution to future research concerning manganism therapies.

Abstract: Tachykinin signaling system is present in both vertebrates and invertebrates, and functions as neuromodulator responsible for the regulation of various physiological processes. In human, the internalization of G protein-coupled receptors has been extensively characterized; however, the insect GPCR internalization has been rarely investigated. Here, we constructed two expression vectors of Bombyx tachykinin-related peptide receptor (BmTKRPR) fused with Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) at the C-terminal end for direct visualization of receptor expression, localization, and trafficking in cultured mammalian HEK293 and insect Sf21 cells. Our results demonstrated that agonist-activated BmTKRPR underwent rapid internalization in a dose-and time-dependent manner via a clathrin-dependent pathway in both HEK293 and Sf21 cells. Further investigation via RNAi or specific inhibitors, or co-immunoprecipitation demonstrated that agonist-induced BmTKRPR internalization was mediated by PKC, GRK5 and β-arrestin2/BmKurtz. In addition, we also observed that most of the internalized BmTKRP receptors were recycled to the cell surface via early endosomes upon peptide ligand removal. Our study provides the first in-depth information on mechanisms underlying insect TKRP receptor internalization and perhaps aids in the interpretation of the signaling in the regulation of physiological processes.

Abstract: Charcot-Marie Tooth type 2B (CMT2B) is a rare inherited peripheral neuropathy caused by five missense mutations in the RAB7A gene, which encodes a small GTPase of the RAB family. Currently, no cure is available for this disease. In this study, we approached the disease by comparing the lipid metabolism of CMT2B-derived fibroblasts to that of healthy controls. We found that CMT2B cells showed increased monounsaturated fatty acid level and increased expression of key enzymes of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acid synthesis. Moreover, in CMT2B cells a higher expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS), key enzymes of de novo fatty acid synthesis, with a concomitantly increased [1-14C]acetate incorporation into fatty acids, was observed. The expression of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2, a rate-limiting enzyme in triacylglycerol synthesis, as well as triacylglycerol levels were increased in CMT2B compared to control cells. In addition, as RAB7A controls lipid droplet breakdown and lipid droplet dynamics have been linked to diseases, we analyzed these organelles and showed that in CMT2B cells there is a strong accumulation of lipid droplets compared to control cells, thus reinforcing our data on abnormal lipid metabolism in CMT2B. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ACC and FAS expression levels changed upon RAB7 silencing or overexpression in HeLa cells, thus suggesting that metabolic modifications observed in CMT2B-derived fibroblasts can be, at least in part, related to RAB7 mutations.

Abstract: Connexins (Cx), the basic subunit of gap junctions, play important roles in cell homeostasis, and their abnormal expression and function are associated with human hereditary diseases and cancers. In tumorigenesis, connexins were observed to have both anti-tumorigenic and pro-tumorigenic roles in a context- and stage-dependent manner. Initially, Cx26 and Cx43 were thought to be the only connexins involved in normal breast homeostasis and breast cancer. Later on, association of Cx32 expression with lymph node metastasis of breast cancer and subsequent demonstration of its expression in normal breast tissue suggested that Cx32 contributes to breast tissue homeostasis. Here, we aimed to determine the effects of Cx32 on normal breast cells, MCF10A, and on breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231. Cx32 overexpression had profound effects on MCF10A cells, decreasing cell proliferation by increasing the doubling time of MCF10A. Furthermore, MCF10A cells acquired mesenchymal-like appearance upon Cx32 expression and had increased migration capacity and expression of both E-cadherin and vimentin. In contrast, Cx32 overexpression altered the EMT markers of MDA-MB-231 by increasing the expression of mesenchymal markers, such as slug and vimentin, and decreasing E-cadherin expression without affecting their proliferation and morphology. Our results indicate, for the first time in the literature, that Cx32 has tumor-promoting roles in MCF10A and MDA-MB-231 cells.

Abstract: Nitric oxide is an important neuromodulator in the CNS, and its production within neurons is modulated by NMDA receptors and requires a fine-tuned availability of L-arginine. We have previously shown that globally inhibiting protein synthesis mobilizes intracellular L-arginine “pools” in retinal neurons, which concomitantly enhances neuronal nitric oxide synthase-mediated nitric oxide production. Activation of NMDA receptors also induces local inhibition of protein synthesis and L-arginine intracellular accumulation through calcium influx and stimulation of eucariotic elongation factor type 2 kinase. We hypothesized that protein synthesis inhibition might also increase intracellular L-arginine availability to induce nitric oxide-dependent activation of downstream signaling pathways. Here we show that nitric oxide produced by inhibiting protein synthesis (using cycloheximide or anisomycin) is readily coupled to AKT activation in a soluble guanylyl cyclase and cGKII-dependent manner. Knockdown of cGKII prevents cycloheximide or anisomycin-induced AKT activation and its nuclear accumulation. Moreover, in retinas from cGKII knockout mice, cycloheximide was unable to enhance AKT phosphorylation. Indeed, cycloheximide also produces an increase of ERK phosphorylation which is abrogated by a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor. In summary, we show that inhibition of protein synthesis is a previously unanticipated driving force for nitric oxide generation and activation of downstream signaling pathways including AKT and ERK in cultured retinal cells. These results may be important for the regulation of synaptic signaling and neuronal development by NMDA receptors as well as for solving conflicting data observed when using protein synthesis inhibitors for studying neuronal survival during development as well in behavior and memory studies.

Abstract: Carbon-based hole-transporting material (HTM)-free CsPbBr3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) provide new opportunities for promoting the commercial application of PSCs because of the low cost, simple preparation process and excellent stability under various extreme conditions. One of the remaining problems for inorganic CsPbBr3 PSCs is the low power conversion efficiency (PCE) due to the large energy level difference and inefficient hole extraction at CsPbBr3/carbon interface. Herein, polyaniline/graphite (PANi/G) composites are incorporated into carbon electrode to tailor work function and to improve hole-selectivity of back electrode for enhanced energy level alignment and interfacial hole extraction, leading to a remarkably reduced energy loss and charge recombination. The HTM-free CsPbBr3 PSC based on carbon-PANi/G electrode achieves a PCE of 8.87%, which is increased by 43.8% in comparison with 6.17% for the control device. Moreover, the unencapsulated device shows excellent long-term moisture tolerance with the initial PCE maintaining 93.5% even exposure to air atmosphere with 80% RH at 25 °C over 50 days. The successful improvement of energy level alignment and charge extraction in device by directly incorporating PANi/G composites into carbon electrode offers a promising strategy in developing low-cost and efficient HTM-free PSCs.

Abstract: Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the most prominent tumor of non-melanoma skin cancers and the most aggressive tumor among keratinocyte carcinoma of the skin, showing a high potential for local invasion and metastasis. The cSCC incidences increased dramatically in recent years and the disease occurs more commonly than any other malignancy. The secretome of cancer cells is currently the focus of many studies in order to identify new marker proteins for different types of cancer and to investigate its influence on the tumor microenvironment. In our study we evaluated whether the secretome of cSCC cells has an impact on keratinocytes, the surrounding tissue cells of cSCC. Therefore, we analyzed and compared the secretome of human A431 cancer cells and of HaCaT keratinocytes by mass spectrometry. In a second experiment, keratinocytes were exposed to the secretome of A431 cells and vice versa and the transcriptome was analyzed by next-generation sequencing. HaCaT cells incubated with A431 conditioned medium revealed a significantly activated mammalian target of rapamycin pathway with a concomitant increase in proliferation and migration. In conclusion, our data demonstrate the impact of the secretome of cancer cells on the transcription machinery of the cells surrounding the tumor, leading to a tumorigenic cell fate.

Abstract: Talin2 plays an important role in transduction of mechanical signals between extracellular matrix and actin cytoskeleton. Recent studies showed that talin2 is localized to invadopodia and regulates their maturation, subsequently cancer cell invasion and metastasis. However, the molecular mechanism whereby talin2 mediates invadopodium maturation is unknown. Here we show that ablation of talin2 in MDA-MB-231 cells inhibited the secretion of matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), a proteinase involved in extracellular matrix degradation in invadopodium maturation and metastasis. Furthermore, re-expression of talin2WT in talin2-KO cells rescued MMP9 secretion, but talin2S339C, a mutant with reduced β-integrin binding, did not, indicating that the talin2-β-integrin interaction is involved in the MMP9 secretion. Moreover, ablation of talin2 caused an accumulation of enlarged MMP9 vesicles. These vesicles co-localized with enlarged early, late endosomes and autophagosomes, suggesting talin2 controls MMP9 trafficking process. Therefore, these data suggest that talin2 regulates extracellular matrix degradation and invadopodium maturation by mediating MMP9 secretion.

Abstract: Palmitoleic acid (POA, 16:1n-7) is a lipokine that has potential nutraceutical use to treat non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. We tested the effects of POA supplementation (daily oral gavage, 300 mg/Kg, 15 days) on murine liver inflammation induced by a high fat diet (HFD, 59% fat, 12 weeks). In HFD-fed mice, POA supplementation reduced serum insulin and improved insulin tolerance compared with oleic acid (OA, 300 mg/Kg). The livers of POA-treated mice exhibited less steatosis and inflammation than those of OA-treated mice with lower inflammatory cytokine levels and reduced toll-like receptor 4 protein content. The anti-inflammatory effects of POA in the liver were accompanied by a reduction in liver macrophages (LM, CD11c+; F4/80+; CD86+), an effect that could be triggered by peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-γ, a lipogenic transcription factor upregulated in livers of POA-treated mice. We also used HFD-fed mice with selective deletion of PPAR-γ in myeloid cells (PPAR-γ KOLyzCre+) to test whether the beneficial anti-inflammatory effects of POA are dependent on macrophages PPAR-γ. POA-mediated improvement of insulin tolerance was tightly dependent on myeloid PPAR-γ, while POA anti-inflammatory actions including the reduction in liver inflammatory cytokines were preserved in mice bearing myeloid cells deficient in PPAR-γ. This overlapped with increased CD206+ (M2a) cells and downregulation of CD86+ and CD11c+ liver macrophages. Moreover, POA supplementation increased hepatic AMPK activity and decreased expression of the fatty acid binding scavenger receptor, CD36. We conclude that POA controls liver inflammation triggered by fat accumulation through induction of M2a macrophages independently of myeloid cell PPAR-γ.

Abstract: Solar Cell with TiO2-Graphene Quantum core/shell heterostructure synthesized by surface functionalization route is used for the present study. The structural properties of Graphene Quantum Dots (GQDs) coated TiO2 are confirmed by XRD, Raman, SEM, TEM and mapping analysis. Energies of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) and Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) of the GQDs against vacuum are determined using cyclic voltammetry technique and ultraviolet photo electron spectroscopy. When compared to the bare devices, J-V characteristics of the GQDs incorporated solar cell show an enhancement in efficiency around 38% and Jsc of 48%. Moreover, TiO2-GQD (TG 10) device pre and post treated with Titanium Tetra Isopropoxide (TTIP) shows the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.1% which is ~65% enhancement when compared to untreated TG 10 based cell. This enhancement is due to higher light harvesting capacity, reduction in charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the interface, increase in life time of carriers and increase in charge transfer rates.

Abstract: Background
Microtubules, the key components of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton and mitotic spindle, are one of the most sought-after targets for cancer chemotherapy, especially due to their indispensible role in mitosis. Cervical cancer is a prevalent malignancy among women of developing countries including India. In spite of the remarkable therapeutic advancement, the non-specificity of chemotherapeutic drugs adversely affect the patients' survival and well-being, thus, necessitating the quest for novel indole-based anti-microtubule agent against cervical cancer, with high degree of potency and selectivity.
Methods
For in vitro studies, we used MTT assay, confocal microscopy, fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry and Western blot analysis. Study in cell free system was accomplished by spectrophotometry, fluorescence spectroscopy and TEM and computational analysis was done by AutodockTools 1.5.6.
Results
NMK-BH2 exhibited significant and selective anti-proliferative activity against cervical cancer HeLa cells (IC50 = 1.5 μM) over normal cells. It perturbed the cytoskeletal and spindle microtubules of HeLa cells leading to mitotic block and cell death by apoptosis and autophagy. Furthermore, NMK-BH2 targeted the tubulin-microtubule system through fast and strong binding to the αβ-tubulin heterodimers at colchicine-site.
Conclusion
This study identifies and characterises NMK-BH2 as a novel anti-microtubule agent and provides insights into its key anti-cancer mechanism through two different cell death pathways: apoptosis and autophagy, which are mutually independent.
General significance
It navigates the potential of the novel bis (indolyl)-hydrazide-hydrazone, NMK-BH2, to serve as lead for development of new generation microtubule-disrupting chemotherapeutic with improved efficacy and remarkable selectivity towards better cure of cervical cancer.

Abstract: Tumor susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101), an ESCRT-I protein, is implicated in multiple cellular processes and its functional depletion can lead to blocked lysosomal degradation, cell cycle arrest, demyelination and neurodegeneration. Here, we show that loss of TSG101 results in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and this causes ER membrane remodelling (EMR). This correlates with an expansion of ER, increased vacuolation, altered relative distribution of the rough and smooth ER and disruption of three-way junctions. Blocked lysosomal degradation due to TSG101 depletion leads to ER stress and Ca2+ leakage from ER stores, causing destabilization of actin cytoskeleton. Inhibiting Ca2+ release from the ER by blocking ryanodine receptors (RYRs) with Dantrolene partially rescues the ER stress phenotypes. Hence, in this study we have identified the involvement of TSG101 in modulating ER stress mediated remodelling by engaging the actin cytoskeleton. This is significant because functional depletion of TSG101 effectuates ER-stress, perturbs the structure, mobility and function of the ER, all aspects closely associated with neurodegenerative diseases.
Summary statement
We show that tumor susceptibility gene (TSG) 101 regulates endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and its membrane remodelling. Loss of TSG101 perturbs structure, mobility and function of the ER as a consequence of actin destabilization.

Abstract: Background
Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a pediatric cancer with rhabdomyoblastic phenotype and mitochondria act as pivotal regulators of its growth and progression. While miR-7-5p (miR-7) is reported to have a tumor-suppressive role, little is yet known about its antitumor activity in RMS.
Methods
The effects of miR-7 on RMS were analyzed both in vitro and in vivo. Cell death modalities induced by miR-7 were identified. Influence on mitochondria was evaluated through RNA sequencing data, morphological observation and mitochondrial functional assays, including outer membrane permeability, bioenergetics and redox balance. Dual-luciferase assay and phenotype validation after transient gene silencing were performed to identify miR-7 targets in RMS.
Results
MiR-7 executed anti-tumor effect in RMS beyond proliferation inhibition. Morphologic features and molecular characteristics with apoptosis and necroptosis were found in miR-7-transfected RMS cells. Chemical inhibitors of apoptosis and necroptosis were able to prevent miR-7-induced cell death. Further, we identified that mitochondrial impairment mainly contributed to these phenomena and mitochondrial proteins SLC25A37 and TIMM50 were crucial targets for miR-7 to induce cell death in RMS.
Conclusion
Our results extended the mechanism of miR-7 antitumor role in rhabdomyosarcoma cancer, and provided potential implications for its therapy.

Abstract: Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor for Cullin-ring E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL), is a major target protein of immunomodulatory drugs. An earlier study demonstrated that CRBN directly interacts with the catalytic α subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master regulator of energy homeostasis, down-regulating the enzymatic activity of AMPK. However, it is not clear how CRBN modulates AMPK activity. To investigate the mechanism of CRBN-dependent AMPK inhibition, we measured protein levels of each AMPK subunit in brains, livers, lungs, hearts, spleens, skeletal muscles, testes, kidneys, and embryonic fibroblasts from wild-type and Crbn−/− mice. Protein levels and stability of the regulatory AMPKγ subunit were increased in Crbn−/− mice. Increased stability of AMPKγ in Crbn−/− MEFs was dramatically reduced by exogenous expression of Crbn. In wild-type MEFs, the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 blocked degradation of AMPKγ. We also found that CRL4CRBN directly ubiquitinated AMPKγ. Taken together, these findings suggest that CRL4CRBN regulates AMPK through ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of AMPKγ.

Abstract: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming the main cause of liver disease in Western countries, especially in morbidly obese patients (MOPs). The proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) has been recently studied because of its possible involvement in the pathogenesis of NAFLD, but its role, at least in MOPs, is still controversial. The aim of this study was to clarify the correlation between the circulating levels of the PCSK9 protein (cPCSK9) and its hepatic expression with the severity of liver damage in a population of MOPs with NAFLD undergoing bariatric surgery. PCSK9 mRNA was positively correlated with FASN, PPARγ and PPARα mRNAs, while no significant differences were found in PCSK9 mRNA expression in relation to the severity of liver steatosis, lobular inflammation and hepatocellular ballooning. In addition, hepatic PCSK9 protein expression levels were not related to histological parameters of lobular inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning, decreased significantly only in relation to the severity of hepatic steatosis, and were inversely correlated with ALT and AST serum levels. cPCSK9 levels in the whole population were associated with the severity of hepatic steatosis and were positively correlated to total cholesterol levels. In multivariate analysis, cPCSK9 levels were associated with age, total cholesterol and HbA1c. In conclusion, in MOPs our findings support a role for PCSK9 in liver fat accumulation, but not in liver damage progression, and confirm its role in the increase of blood cholesterol, which ultimately may contribute to increased cardiovascular risk in this population.

Abstract: The first meeting of the African Blood and Marrow Transplantation (AfBMT) was held in Casablanca from April 19, 2018 to April 21, 2018, with the aim of fostering hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) activity in Africa. Out of the 54 African countries, HSCT is available only in six (Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Nigeria, South Africa, and Tunisia). During this meeting, African teams and international experts from the Worldwide Network for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (WBMT) gathered to share their experience and discussed ways to help fill the gap. Nurses and patients held their meeting in parallel. International support and collaboration can help by providing expertise adapted to local resources and regional population needs. Local engagement including government and private participants are necessary to initiate and develop local HSCT capability.

JAK2 regulates Nav1.6 channel function via FGF14Y158 phosphorylation,

Abstract: Background
Protein interactions between voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels and accessory proteins play an essential role in neuronal firing and plasticity. However, a surprisingly limited number of kinases have been identified as regulators of these molecular complexes. We hypothesized that numerous as-of-yet unidentified kinases indirectly regulate the Nav channel via modulation of the intracellular fibroblast growth factor 14 (FGF14), an accessory protein with numerous unexplored phosphomotifs and required for channel function in neurons.
Methods
Here we present results from an in-cell high-throughput screening (HTS) against the FGF14: Nav1.6 complex using >3000 diverse compounds targeting an extensive range of signaling pathways. Regulation by top kinase targets was then explored using in vitro phosphorylation, biophysics, mass-spectrometry and patch-clamp electrophysiology.
Results
Compounds targeting Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) were over-represented among HTS hits. Phosphomotif scans supported by mass spectrometry revealed FGF14Y158, a site previously shown to mediate both FGF14 homodimerization and interactions with Nav1.6, as a JAK2 phosphorylation site. Following inhibition of JAK2, FGF14 homodimerization increased in a manner directly inverse to FGF14:Nav1.6 complex formation, but not in the presence of the FGF14Y158A mutant. Patch-clamp electrophysiology revealed that through Y158, JAK2 controls FGF14-dependent modulation of Nav1.6 channels. In hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, the JAK2 inhibitor Fedratinib reduced firing by a mechanism that is dependent upon expression of FGF14.
Conclusions
These studies point toward a novel mechanism by which levels of JAK2 in neurons could directly influence firing and plasticity by controlling the FGF14 dimerization equilibrium, and thereby the availability of monomeric species for interaction with Nav1.6.

Abstract: Phosphatidic acid (PA) consists of various molecular species that have different fatty acyl chains at the sn-1 and sn-2 positions; and consequently, mammalian cells contain at least 50 structurally distinct PA molecular species. However, the different roles of each PA species are poorly understood. In the present study, we attempted to identify dipalmitoyl (16:0/16:0)-PA-binding proteins from mouse skeletal muscle using liposome precipitation and tandem mass spectrometry analysis. We identified L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) A, which catalyzes conversion of pyruvate to lactate and is a key checkpoint of anaerobic glycolysis critical for tumor growth, as a 16:0/16:0-PA-binding protein. LDHA did not substantially associate with other phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, phosphoinositides and cardiolipin at physiological pH (7.4), indicating that LDHA specifically bound to PA. Interestingly, 18:0/18:0-, 18:0/20:4- and 18:0/22:6-PA also interacted with LDHA, and their binding activities were stronger than 16:0/16:0-PA at pH 7.4. Moreover, circular dichroism spectrometry showed that 18:0/20:4- and 18:0/22:6-PA, but not 16:0/16:0- or 18:0/18:0-PA, significantly reduced the α-helical structure of LDHA. Furthermore, 18:0/20:4- and 18:0/22:6-PA attenuated LDH activity. Taken together, we demonstrated for the first time that LDHA is a PA-binding protein and is a unique PA-binding protein that is structurally and functionally controlled by associating with 18:0/20:4- and 18:0/22:6-PA.

Abstract: Evasion from apoptosis is one of the hallmarks of cancer. X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) is known to modulate apoptosis by inhibiting caspases and ubiquitinating target proteins. XIAP is mainly found at the cytoplasm, but recent data link nuclear XIAP to poor prognosis in breast cancer. Here, we generated a mutant form of XIAP with a nuclear localization signal (XIAPNLS-C-term) and investigated the oncogenic mechanisms associated with nuclear XIAP in breast cancer. Our results show that cells overexpressing XIAPΔRING (RING deletion) and XIAPNLS-C-term exhibited XIAP nuclear localization more abundantly than XIAPwild-type. Remarkably, overexpression of XIAPNLS-C-term, but not XIAPΔRING, conferred resistance to doxorubicin and increased cellular proliferative capacity. Interestingly, Survivin and c-IAP1 expression were not associated with XIAP oncogenic effects. However, NFκB expression and ubiquitination of K63, but not K48 chains, were increased following XIAPNLS-C-term overexpression, pointing to nuclear signaling transduction. Consistently, multivariate analysis revealed nuclear, but not cytoplasmic XIAP, as an independent prognostic factor in hormone receptor-negative breast cancer patients. Altogether, our findings suggest that nuclear XIAP confers poor outcome and RING-associated breast cancer growth and chemoresistance.

Abstract: Dermal fibroblasts seem critical for epidermal maturation and differentiation and recent work demonstrated that diseased fibroblasts may drive pathophysiological processes. Nevertheless, still very little is known about the actual crosstalk between epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts and the impact of dermal fibroblasts on epidermal maturation and differentiation. Aiming for a more fundamental understanding of the impact of the cellular crosstalk between keratinocytes and fibroblasts on the skin homeostasis, we generated full-thickness skin equivalents with and without fibroblasts and subsequently analysed them for the expression of skin differentiation markers, their barrier function, skin lipid content and epidermal cell signalling. Skin equivalents without fibroblasts consistently showed an impaired differentiation and dysregulated expression of skin barrier and tight junction proteins, increased skin permeability, and a decreased skin lipid/protein ratio. Most interestingly, impaired Ras/Raf/ERK/MEK signalling was evident in skin equivalents without fibroblasts. Our data clearly indicate that the epidermal-dermal crosstalk between keratinocytes and fibroblasts is critical for adequate skin differentiation and that fibroblasts orchestrate epidermal differentiation processes.

Abstract: Neutrophils exhibit rapid cell spreading and phagocytosis, both requiring a large apparent increase in the cell surface area. The wrinkled surface topography of these cells may provide the membrane reservoir for this. Here, the effects of manipulation of the neutrophil cell surface topography on phagocytosis and cell spreading were established. Chemical expansion of the plasma membrane or osmotic swelling had no effects. However, osmotic shrinking of neutrophils inhibited both cell spreading and phagocytosis. Triggering a Ca2+ signal in osmotically shrunk cells (by IP3 uncaging) evoked tubular blebs instead of full cell spreading. Phagocytosis was halted at the phagocytic cup stage by osmotic shrinking induced after the phagocytic Ca2+ signalling. Restoration of isotonicity was able to restore complete phagocytosis. These data thus provide evidence that the wrinkled neutrophil surface topography provides the membrane reservoir to increase the available cell surface area for phagocytosis and spreading by neutrophils.

Abstract: The biogenesis of membrane-bound electron transport chains requires membrane translocation pathways for folded proteins carrying complex cofactors, like the Rieske Fe/S proteins. Two independent systems were developed during evolution, namely the Twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway, which is present in bacteria and chloroplasts, and the Bcs1 pathway found in mitochondria of yeast and mammals. Mitochondria of plants carry a Tat-like pathway which was hypothesized to operate with only two subunits, a TatB-like protein and a TatC homolog (OrfX), but lacking TatA. Here we show that the nuclearly encoded TatA from pea has dual targeting properties, i.e., it can be imported into both, chloroplasts and mitochondria. Dual targeting of TatA was observed with in organello experiments employing chloroplasts and mitochondria isolated from pea as well as after transient expression of suitable reporter constructs in leaf tissue from pea and Nicotiana benthamiana. The extent of transport of these constructs into mitochondria of transiently transformed leaf cells was relatively low, causing a demand for highly sensitive methods to be detected, like the sasplitGFP approach. Yet, the dual import of TatA into mitochondria and chloroplasts observed here points to a common mechanism of Tat transport for folded proteins within both endosymbiotic organelles in plants.

Abstract: Emerging evidence shows that Rab11 recycling endosomes (REs Rab11) are essential for several neuronal processes, including the proper functioning of growth cones, synapse architecture regulation and neuronal migration. However, several aspects of REs Rab11 remain unclear, such as its sub-cellular distribution across neuronal development, contribution to dendritic tree organization and its consequences in memory formation. In this work we show a spatio-temporal correlation between the endogenous localization of REs Rab11 and developmental stage of neurons. Furthermore, Rab11-suppressed neurons showed an increase on dendritic branching (without altering total dendritic length) and misdistribution of dendritic proteins in cultured neurons. In addition, suppression of Rab11 in adult rat brains in vivo (by expressing shRab11 through lentiviral infection), showed a decrease on both the sensitivity to induce long-term potentiation and hippocampal-dependent memory acquisition. Taken together, our results suggest that REs Rab11 expression is required for a proper dendritic architecture and branching, controlling key aspects of synaptic plasticity and spatial memory formation.

Abstract: The bacterial twin-arginine (Tat) pathway serves in the exclusive secretion of folded proteins with bound cofactors. While Tat pathways in Gram-negative bacteria and chloroplast thylakoids consist of conserved TatA, TatB and TatC subunits, the Tat pathways of Bacillus species and many other Gram-positive bacteria stand out for their minimalist nature with the core translocase being composed of essential TatA and TatC subunits only. Here we addressed the question whether the minimal TatAyCy translocase of Bacillus subtilis recruits additional cellular components that modulate its activity. To this end, TatAyCy was purified by affinity- and size exclusion chromatography, and interacting co-purified proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. This uncovered the cell envelope stress responsive LiaH protein as an accessory subunit of the TatAyCy complex. Importantly, our functional studies show that Tat expression is tightly trailed by LiaH induction, and that LiaH itself determines the capacity and quality of TatAyCy-dependent protein translocation. In contrast, LiaH has no role in high-level protein secretion via the general secretion (Sec) pathway. Altogether, our observations show that protein translocation by the minimal Tat translocase TatAyCy is tightly intertwined with an adequate bacterial response to cell envelope stress. This is consistent with a critical need to maintain cellular homeostasis, especially when the membrane is widely opened to permit passage of large fully-folded proteins via Tat.

Esterification of side-chain oxysterols by lysosomal phospholipase A2,

Abstract: Side-chain oxysterols produced from cholesterol either enzymatically or non-enzymatically show various bioactivities. Lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) esterifies the C3-hydroxyl group of these sterols as well as cholesterol. Lysosomal phospholipase A2 (LPLA2) is related to LCAT but does not catalyze esterification of cholesterol. First, esterification of side-chain oxysterols by LPLA2 was investigated using recombinant mouse LPLA2 and dioleoyl-PC/sulfatide/oxysterol liposomes under acidic conditions. TLC and LC-MS/MS showed that the C3 and C27-hydroxyl groups of 27-hydroxycholesterol could be individually esterified by LPLA2 to form a monoester with the C27-hydroxyl preference. Cholesterol did not inhibit this reaction. Also, LPLA2 esterified other side-chain oxysterols. Their esterifications by mouse serum containing LCAT supported the idea that their esterifications by LPLA2 occur at the C3-hydroxyl group. N-acetylsphingosine (NAS) acting as an acyl acceptor in LPLA2 transacylation inhibited the side-chain oxysterol esterification by LPLA2. This suggests a competition between hydroxycholesterol and NAS on the acyl-LPLA2 intermediate formed during the reaction. Raising cationic amphiphilic drug concentration or ionic strength in the reaction mixture evoked a reduction of the side-chain oxysterol esterification by LPLA2. This indicates that the esterification could progress via an interfacial interaction of LPLA2 with the lipid membrane surface through an electrostatic interaction. The docking model of acyl-LPLA2 intermediate and side-chain oxysterol provided new insight to elucidate the transacylation mechanism of sterols by LPLA2. Finally, exogenous 25-hydroxycholesterol esterification within alveolar macrophages prepared from wild-type mice was significantly higher than that from LPLA2 deficient mice. This suggests that there is an esterification pathway of side-chain oxysterols via LPLA2.

Abstract: Ezetimibe inhibits Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) protein, which mediates intracellular cholesterol trafficking from the brush border membrane to the endoplasmic reticulum, where chylomicron assembly takes place in enterocytes or in the intestinal absorptive epithelial cells. Cholesterol is a minor lipid constituent of chylomicrons; however, whether or not a shortage of cholesterol attenuates chylomicron assembly is unknown. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of ezetimibe, a potent NPC1L1 inhibitor, on trans-epithelial lipid transport, and chylomicron assembly and secretion in enterocytes. Caco-2 cells, an absorptive epithelial model, grown onto culture inserts were given lipid micelles from the apical side, and chylomicron-like triacylglycerol-rich lipoprotein secreted basolaterally were analyzed after a 24-h incubation period in the presence of ezetimibe up to 50 μM. The secretion of lipoprotein and apolipoprotein B48 were reduced by adding ezetimibe (30% and 34%, respectively). Although ezetimibe allowed the cells to take up cholesterol normally, the esterification was abolished. Meanwhile, oleic acid esterification was unaffected. Moreover, ezetimibe activated sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 by approximately 1.5-fold. These results suggest that ezetimibe limited cellular cholesterol mobilization required for lipoprotein assembly. In such conditions, large lipid droplet formation in Caco-2 cells and the enterocytes of mice were induced, implying that unprocessed triacylglycerol was sheltered in these compartments. Although ezetimibe did not reduce the post-prandial lipid surge appreciably in triolein-infused mice, the results of the present study indicated that pharmacological actions of ezetimibe may participate in a novel regulatory mechanism for the efficient chylomicron assembly and secretion.

Abstract: Plants have evolved various acclimation responses to cope with phosphate depletion, including several changes in lipid metabolism. Thereby membrane phospholipids are dephosphorylated and can be used as an internal phosphate source, while galactolipids are incorporated into the membrane to maintain membrane functionality. Still little is known about the lipidomic and transcriptomic response of plants other than Arabidopsis thaliana upon phosphate starvation. Therefore, we employed lipidomics and transcriptomics to characterize the phosphate starvation response of lipid metabolism in tomato leaves and roots. Overall, phospholipid levels decreased and galactolipids increased during the acclimation response. In addition, an early increase of triacylglycerol was observed. Interestingly, there were major differences in the acclimation response of tomato leaves and roots: leaves mainly accumulated polyunsaturated triacylglycerol, while roots showed a massive increase in galactolipid content. In line with these results, we observed transcriptional induction of phospholipid degradation and galactolipid synthesis pathways in both analyzed tissues. In contrast, other aspects of the transcriptional response, in particular, the induction of phospholipid degradation, ER-localized fatty acid desaturation and triacylglycerol assembly differed between tomato leaves and roots. These results suggest a different modulation of degraded phospholipids toward triacylglycerols and galactolipids in phosphate-starved tomato leaves and roots. Possibly the availability and composition of acyl-CoA pools and ER-derived precursors trigger the synthesis of triacylglycerols or galactolipids. As the mechanism of triacylglycerol accumulation is poorly characterized outside of seed oil formation, these findings enhance our understanding of the phosphate starvation response and of how storage lipids accumulate under stress in vegetative tissue.

Abstract: Both IFN-γ or high glucose have been linked to systemic inflammatory imbalance with serious repercussions not only for endothelial function but also for the formation of the atherosclerotic plaque. Although the uncontrolled opening of connexin hemichannels underpins the progression of various diseases, whether they are implicated in endothelial cell dysfunction and damage evoked by IFN-γ plus high glucose remains to be fully elucidated. In this study, by using live cell imaging and biochemical approaches, we demonstrate that IFN-γ plus high glucose augment endothelial connexin43 hemichannel activity, resulting in the increase of ATP release, ATP-mediated Ca2+ dynamics and production of nitric oxide and superoxide anion, as well as impaired insulin-mediated uptake and intercellular diffusion of glucose and cell survival. Based on our results, we propose that connexin 43 hemichannel inhibition could serve as a new approach for tackling the activation of detrimental signaling resulting in endothelial cell dysfunction and death caused by inflammatory mediators during atherosclerosis secondary to diabetes mellitus.

Abstract: Cutaneous melanocytes and melanoma cells express several opsins, of which melanopsin (OPN4) detects temperature and UVA radiation. To evaluate the interaction between OPN4 and UVA radiation, normal and malignant Opn4WT and Opn4KO melanocytes were exposed to three daily low doses (total 13.2 kJ/m2) of UVA radiation. UVA radiation led to a reduction of proliferation in both Opn4WT cell lines; however, only in melanoma cells this effect was associated with increased cell death by apoptosis. Daily UVA stimuli induced persistent pigment darkening (PPD) in both Opn4WT cell lines. Upon Opn4 knockout, all UVA-induced effects were lost in three independent clones of Opn4KO melanocytes and melanoma cells. Per1 bioluminescence was reduced after 1st and 2nd UVA radiations in Opn4WT cells. In Opn4KO melanocytes and melanoma cells, an acute increase of Per1 expression was seen immediately after each stimulus. We also found that OPN4 expression is downregulated in human melanoma compared to normal skin, and it decreases with disease progression. Interestingly, metastatic melanomas with low expression of OPN4 present increased expression of BMAL1 and longer overall survival. Collectively, our findings reinforce the functionality of the photosensitive system of melanocytes that may subsidize advancements in the understanding of skin related diseases, including cancer.

Abstract: Accumulation of unfolded protein, or other stresses, activates the classical reactive unfolded protein response (UPR). In the recently characterized anticipatory UPR, receptor-bound estrogen, progesterone and other mitogenic hormones rapidly elicit phosphorylation of phospholipase C γ (PLCγ), activating the anticipatory UPR. How estrogen and progesterone activating their receptors couples to PLCγ phosphorylation and anticipatory UPR activation was unknown. We show that the oncogene c-Src is a rate-limiting regulator whose tyrosine kinase activity links estrogen and progesterone activating their receptors to anticipatory UPR activation. Supporting Src coupling estrogen and progesterone to anticipatory UPR activation, we identified extranuclear complexes of estrogen receptor α (ERα):Src:PLCγ and progesterone receptor:Src:PLCγ. Moreover, Src inhibition protected cancer cells against cell death. To probe Src's role, we used the preclinical ERα biomodulator, BHPI, which kills cancer cells by inducing lethal anticipatory UPR hyperactivation. Notably, Src inhibition blocked BHPI-mediated anticipatory UPR activation and the resulting rapid increase in intracellular calcium. After unbiased long-term selection for BHPI-resistant human breast cancer cells, 4/11 BHPI-resistant T47D clones, and nearly all MCF-7 clones, exhibited reduced levels of normally growth-stimulating Src. Notably, Src overexpression by virus transduction restored sensitivity to BHPI. Furthermore, in wild type cells, several-fold knockdown of Src, but not of ERα, strongly blocked BHPI-mediated UPR activation and subsequent HMGB1 release and necrotic cell death. Thus, Src plays a previously undescribed pivotal role in activation of the tumor-protective anticipatory UPR, thereby increasing the resilience of breast cancer cells. This is a new role for Src and the anticipatory UPR in breast cancer.

Abstract: Long non coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as crucial players of several central cellular processes across eukaryotes. Target of Rapamycin (TOR) is a central regulator of myriad of fundamental cellular processes including amino acid transport under diverse environmental conditions. Here we investigated the role of lncRNA in TOR regulated amino acid uptake in S. cerevisiae. Transcription of lncRNA regulates local gene expression in eukaryotes. In silico analysis of many genome wide studies in S. cerevisiae revealed that transcriptome includes conditional expression of numerous lncRNAs in proximity to amino acid transporters (AATs). Considering regulatory role of these lncRNAs, we selected highly conserved TOR regulated locus of a pair of AATs present in tandem BAP2 and TAT1. We observed that the expression of antisense lncRNA XUT_2F-154 (TBRT) and AATs BAP2 and TAT1 depends on activities of TOR signaling pathway. The expression of TBRT is induced, while that of BAP2 TAT1 is repressed upon TOR inhibition by Torin2. Notably, upon TOR inhibition loss of TBRT contributed to enhanced activities of Bap2 and Tat1 leading to improved growth. Interestingly, nucleosome scanning assay reveal that TOR signaling pathway governs chromatin remodeling at BAP2 biphasic promoter to control the antagonism of TBRT and BAP2 expression. Further TBRT also reprograms local chromatin landscapes to decrease the transcription of TAT1. The current work demonstrates a functional correlation between lncRNA production and TOR governed amino acid uptake in yeast. Thus this work brings forth a novel avenue for identification of potential regulators for therapeutic interventions against TOR mediated diseases.

Abstract: Altered expression and/or localization of cysteine cathepsins is believed to involve in thyroid diseases including cancer. Here, we examined the localization of cathepsins B and V in human thyroid tissue sections of different pathological conditions by immunolabeling and morphometry. Cathepsin B was mostly found within endo-lysosomes as expected. In contrast, cathepsin V was detected within nuclei, predominantly in cells of cold nodules, follicular and papillary thyroid carcinoma tissue, while it was less often detected in this unusual localization in hot nodules and goiter tissue. To understand the significance of nuclear cathepsin V in thyroid cells, this study aimed to establish a cellular model of stable nuclear cathepsin V expression. As representative of a specific form lacking the signal peptide and part of the propeptide, N-terminally truncated cathepsin V fused to eGFP recapitulated the nuclear localization of endogenous cathepsin V throughout the cell cycle in Nthy-ori 3-1 cells. Interestingly, the N-terminally truncated cathepsin V-eGFP was more abundant in the nuclei during S phase. These findings suggested a possible contribution of nuclear cathepsin V forms to cell cycle progression. Indeed, we found that N-terminally truncated cathepsin V-eGFP expressing cells were more proliferative than those expressing full-length cathepsin V-eGFP or wild type controls. We conclude that a specific molecular form of cathepsin V localizes to the nucleus of thyroid epithelial and carcinoma cells, where it might involve in deregulated pathways leading to hyperproliferation. These findings highlight the necessity to better understand cathepsin trafficking in health and disease. In particular, cell type specificity of mislocalization of cysteine cathepsins, which otherwise act in a functionally redundant manner, seems to be important to understand their non-canonical roles in cell cycle progression.

Abstract: A human cDNA encoding the LIM domain containing 194 amino acid cysteine and glycine rich protein 3 (CSRP3) was identified as a BAX suppressor in yeast and a pro-survival sequence that abrogated copper mediated regulated cell death (RCD). Yeast lacks a CSRP3 orthologue but it has four LIM sequences, namely RGA1, RGA2, LRG1 and PXL1. These are known regulators of stress responses yet their roles in RCD remain unknown. Given that LIMs interact with other LIMs, we ruled out the possibility that overexpressed yeast LIMs alone could prevent RCD and that CSRP3 functions by acting as a dominant regulator of yeast LIMs. Of interest was the discovery that even though yeast cells lacking the LIM encoding PXL1 had no overt growth defect, it was nevertheless supersensitive to the effects of sublethal levels of copper. Heterologous expression of human CSPR3 as well as the pro-survival 14-3-3 sequence corrected this copper supersensitivity. These results show that the pxl1∆-copper synthetic lethality is likely due to the induction of RCD. This differs from the prevailing model in which synthetic lethality occurs because of specific defects generated by the combined loss of two overlapping but non-essential functions.

Abstract: We recently reported that loss of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-2 (CAMKK2), a serine/threonine kinase activated by intracellular calcium, in mice leads to tissue-specific aberrant turnover of transferrin (TF), a receptor-mediated iron-transporter that supplies iron to tissues. Iron dyshomeostasis is associated with the pathogenesis of several diseases, making TF transport relevant to health. In this study, we used hemizygous CAMKK2 hypomorphic human endothelial cell (EA.hy926) clones to demonstrate that cells with reduced CAMKK2 exhibit increased TF uptake and transcytosis, and decreased intracellular trafficking to subcellular organelles compared to wild-type. The abnormal TF trafficking in CAMKK2 hypomorphic cells correlated with a reduction in intracellular iron content and defective glucose metabolism including glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration. CAMKK2 deficiency also caused reduction in GAPDH and VDAC1 protein level which correlated to defective bioenergetics function. These findings have identified a novel mechanistic link between abnormal calcium signaling, iron dyshomeostasis and metabolic dysfunction involving CAMKK2.

Abstract: A growing body of evidence suggests a role of proteolytic enzymes in the development of diabetic nephropathy. Cathepsin C (CatC) is a well-known regulator of inflammatory responses, but its involvement in podocyte and renal injury remains obscure. We used Zucker rats, a genetic model of metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance, to determine the presence, quantity, and activity of CatC in the urine. In addition to the animal study, we used two cellular models, immortalized human podocytes and primary rat podocytes, to determine mRNA and protein expression levels via RT-PCR, Western blot, and confocal microscopy, and to evaluate CatC activity. The role of CatC was analyzed in CatC-depleted podocytes using siRNA and glycolytic flux parameters were obtained from extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) measurements. In functional analyses, podocyte and glomerular permeability to albumin was determined. We found that podocytes express and secrete CatC, and a hyperglycemic environment increases CatC levels and activity. Both high glucose and non-specific activator of CatC phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) diminished nephrin, cofilin, and GLUT4 levels and induced cytoskeletal rearrangements, increasing albumin permeability in podocytes. These negative effects were completely reversed in CatC-depleted podocytes. Moreover, PMA, but not high glucose, increased glycolytic flux in podocytes. Finally, we demonstrated that CatC expression and activity are increased in the urine of diabetic Zucker rats. We propose a novel mechanism of podocyte injury in diabetes, providing deeper insight into the role of CatC in podocyte biology.

Abstract: Human Mpv17-like protein (M-LPH/Mpv17L) is thought to play a role in minimizing mitochondrial dysfunction caused by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage. We have recently demonstrated that, in addition to an increase of mtDNA damage, M-LPH-knockout (M-LPH-KO) in HepG2 cells causes a significant reduction of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) protein, an essential factor for mtDNA maintenance, along with an increase in its phosphorylation. These intracellular changes suggested an association of M-LPH with the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway, as selective degradation of TFAM by mitochondrial protease is driven by protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent phosphorylation. In the present study, we observed that M-LPH-KO in HepG2 cells caused an increase in the level of mitochondrial cAMP and a reduction of total cellular cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity. In vitro-synthesized M-LPH showed PDE activity, which was inhibited by IBMX, a non-selective inhibitor of PDE. Furthermore, M-LPH-KO promoted PKA-dependent phosphorylation of some mitochondrial proteins. Taken together, the present findings suggest that M-LPH, which has structural features atypical of PDE family members, might be a novel human PDE involved in cAMP/PKA signaling in the mitochondrial matrix.

Abstract: Cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) are necessary to maintain extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis in the heart. Normally, CFs are quiescent and secrete small amounts of ECM components, whereas, in pathological conditions, they differentiate into more active cells called cardiac myofibroblasts (CMF). CMF conversion is characteristic of cardiac fibrotic diseases, such as heart failure and diabetic cardiomyopathy. TGF-β1 is a key protein involved in CMF conversion. SMADs are nuclear factor proteins activated by TGF-β1 that need other proteins, such as forkhead box type O (FoxO) family members, to promote CMF conversion. FoxO1, a member of this family protein, is necessary for TGF-β1-induced CMF conversion, whereas the role of FoxO3a, another FoxO family member, is unknown. FoxO3a plays an important role in many fibrotic processes in the kidney and lung. However, the participation of FoxO3a in the conversion of CFs into CMF is not clear. In this paper, we demonstrate that TGF-β1 decreases the activation and expression of FoxO3a in CFs. FoxO3a regulation by TGF-β1 requires activated SMAD3, ERK1/2 and Akt. Furthermore, we show that FoxO1 is crucial in the FoxO3a regulation induced by TGF-β1, as shown by overexpressed FoxO1 enhancing and silenced FoxO1 suppressing the effects of TGF-β1 on FoxO3a. Finally, the regulation of TGF-β1-induced CMF conversion was enhanced by FoxO3a silencing and suppressed by inhibited FoxO3a degradation. Considering these collective findings, we suggest that FoxO3a acts as a negative regulator of the CMF conversion that is induced by TGF-β1.

Abstract: The gene encoding promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) generates several spliced isoforms. Ectopic expression of PML1 promotes the proliferation of ERα-positive MCF-7 breast cancer (BC) cells, while a loss of PML by knockdown or overexpression of PML4 does the opposite. PML is an essential constituent of highly dynamic particles called PML nuclear bodies (NBs). PML NBs are heterogenous multiprotein subnuclear structures that are part of cellular stress sensing machinery. The antioxidant sulforaphane (SFN) inhibits the proliferation of BC cells and causes a redistribution of the subcellular localization of PML, a disruption of disulfide-bond linkages in nuclear PML-containing complexes, and a reduction in the number and size of PML NBs. Mechanistically, SFN modifies several cysteine residues, including C204, located in the RBCC domain of PML. PML is sumoylated and contains a Sumo-interacting motif, and a significant fraction of Sumo1 and Sumo2/3 co-localizes with PML NBs. Ectopic expression of the mutant C204A selectively inhibits the biogenesis of endogenous PML NBs but not PML-less Sumo1-, Sumo2/3, or Daxx-containing nuclear speckles. Importantly, PML1 (C204A) functions as a dominant-negative mutant over endogenous PML protein and promotes anti-proliferation activity. Together, we conclude that SFN elicits its cytotoxic activity in part by inactivating PML1's pro-tumorigenic activity.

Abstract: We investigated the hypothesis that the endocannabinoidome (eCBome), an extension of the endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling system with important functions in the CNS, may play a role in the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Using LC-MS/MS and qPCR arrays we profiled the brain eCBome of juvenile (4 weeks) and adult (13 weeks) male and female germ-free (GF) mice, which are raised in sterile conditions and virtually devoid of microbiota, present neurophysiological deficits, and were found recently to exhibit a strongly altered gut eCBome in comparison to conventionally raised age/sex-matched controls. The causal effect of the gut microbiome on the eCBome was investigated through the re-introduction into adult male GF mice of a functional gut microbiota by fecal microbiota transfer (FMT). The concentrations of the eCB, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), and its 2-monoacylglycerol congeners, were significantly reduced in the brain, but not in the hypothalamus, of both juvenile and adult male and adult female GF mice. FMT rendered these decreases non-statistically significant. The eCB, anandamide (AEA), and its congener N-acylethanolamines (NAEs), were instead increased in the brain of adult female GF mice. Saturated fatty acid-containing NAEs were decreased in adult male GF mouse hypothalamus in a manner not reversed by FMT. Only few changes were observed in the expression of eCBome enzymes and receptors.

Abstract: TRPC6 channel is widely expressed in most human tissues and participates in a number of physiological processes. TRPC6 belongs to the DAG-activated subfamily of channels, but has also been postulated as a mediator in the store-operated calcium entry pathway. The recent characterization of TRPC6 crystal structure has granted a wonderful tool to finally dissect and understand TRPC6 physiological and biophysical properties. Growing evidences have demonstrated that the pattern of expression of TRPC6 proteins is upregulated in several pathophysiological conditions, including breast cancer. However, the real role of TRPC6 in breast cancer persists still unknown. Here we present the current state of the art concerning the function and significance of TRPC6 in this disease. Future investigations should be focus in the creation and identification of compounds that specifically target the channel to ameliorate TRPC6-related diseases.

Abstract: The movement of cell-bound membrane vesicles (CBMVs) on migrating cells is poorly understood. We hypothesized that the movement of CBMVs on migrating cells is different from that on non-migrating cells and can be interfered by external stimuli. To test it, single-vesicle tracking was performed to analyze motion type, speed, displacement, and direction of CBMVs on migrating cells treated with different reagents (Ang-1, TNF-α, LPS, VEGFα, endostatin, Cytochalasin D, and nocodazole) among which the former four promoted cell migration whereas the others inhibited cell migration. We found that cell migration changed CBMVs from non-directed to directed motion and that most CBMVs on untreated migrating cells moved along the migration axis. Interestingly, the migration-promoting reagents played positive roles in CBMV movement (improving directed motion, speed and/or maximal displacement, upregulating the amount of vesicles moving in migration direction) whereas the migration-inhibiting reagents played negative roles (impairing/abolishing directed motion, speed and/or maximal displacement, downregulating the vesicles moving forward or causing an even distribution of motion direction). The cytoskeleton (particularly microtubules) probably played vital roles in CBMV movement on migrating cells and mediated the effects of stimuli on vesicle movement. The data may provide important information for understanding the properties, behaviors, and functions of CBMVs.

Abstract: Actin dynamics regulate cell behaviour in response to physiological signals. Here we demonstrate a novel role for nuclear actin in inhibiting cell proliferation and migration. We demonstrate that physiological signals that elevate cAMP, which is anti-mitogenic in vascular smooth muscle cells, increases nuclear actin monomer levels. Expression of a nuclear-targeted polymerisation-defective actin mutant (NLS-ActinR62D) inhibited proliferation and migration. Preventing nuclear actin monomer accumulation by enhancing its nuclear export or polymerisation reversed the anti-mitogenic and anti-migratory effects of cAMP. Transcriptomic analysis identified repression of proliferation and migration associated genes regulated by serum response factor (SRF) and TEA Domain (TEAD) transcription factors. Accordingly, NLS-ActinR62D inhibited SRF and TEAD activity and target gene expression, and these effects were reversed by constitutively-active mutants of the TEAD and SRF co-factors YAP, TAZ and MKL1. In summary, intranuclear actin inhibits proliferation and migration by inhibiting YAP-TEAD and MKL-SRF activity. This mechanism explains the anti-mitogenic and anti-migratory properties of physiological signals that elevate cAMP.
Summary
McNeill et al show that increased levels of intranuclear actin monomer inhibit cell proliferation and migration by inhibiting MKL1-SRF and YAP/TAZ-TEAD-dependent gene expression. This mechanism mediates the anti-mitogenic and anti-migratory effects of physiological signals that elevate cyclic-AMP.

Abstract: Background and aims. The molecular mechanisms by which the liver develops steatotic disease still remain unclear. Previous studies using nutritional and genetic models of hepatic steatosis in mice showed that liver synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1) expression was associated with lipid droplet area. Hepatic Syt1 overexpression was used as a tool to explore its effect on hepatic and plasma lipids.
Methods and results
To find out a cause-effect, hepatic mouse Syt1 mRNA was cloned into a vector driving hepatocyte-specific expression and administered by hydrodynamic injection to male Apoe-deficient mice fed on a Western diet, the latter as a model of rapid spontaneous steatosis development. Hepatic microsomal, large vesicle, lysosomal and plasma membrane fractions were enriched in SYT1 protein following gene overexpression. In these conditions, very low density lipoprotein esterified cholesterol increased. Likewise, the transgene caused an alteration in lipid droplet surface and a positive correlation between Syt1 expression and hepatic total cholesterol content. A lipidomic approach evidenced a decrease in lysophosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylcholine and triglycerides in isolated plasma membrane fraction. Expressions of genes involved in biosynthesis of bile acids, fatty acid metabolism, lipoprotein dynamics and vesicular transport were modified by the increased SYT1 expression.
Conclusions
These results indicate that this protein is involved in hepatic management of lipids and in the regulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism.

Acute depletion of telomerase components DKC1 and NOP10 induces oxidative stress and disrupts ribosomal biogenesis via NPM1 and activation of the P53 pathway,

Abstract: Mutations in DKC1, NOP10, and TINF2 genes, coding for proteins in telomerase and shelterin complexes, are responsible for diverse diseases known as telomeropathies and ribosomopathies, including dyskeratosis congenita (DC, ORPHA 1775). These genes contribute to the DC phenotype through mechanisms that are not completely understood. We previously demonstrated in models of DC that oxidative stress is an early and independent event that occurs prior to telomere shortening. To clarify the mechanisms that induce oxidative stress, we silenced genes DKC1, NOP10, and TINF2 with siRNA technology. With RNA array hybridisation, we found several altered pathways for each siRNA model. Afterwards, we identified common related genes. The silenced cell line with the most deregulated genes and pathways was siNOP10, followed by siDKC1, and then by siTINF2 to a lesser extent. The siDKC1 and siNOP10 models shared altered expression of genes in the p53 pathway, while siNOP10 and siTINF2 had the adherens junction pathway in common. We also observed that depletion of DKC1 and NOP10 H/ACA ribonucleoprotein produced ribosomal biogenesis impairment which, in turn, promoted p53 pathway activation. Finally, we found that those enzymes responsible for GSH synthesis were down-regulated in models of siDKC1 and siNOP10. In contrast, the silenced cells for TINF2 showed no disruption of ribosomal biogenesis or oxidative stress and did not produce p53 pathway activation. These results indicate that depletion of DKC1 and NOP10 promotes oxidative stress and disrupts ribosomal biogenesis which, in turn, activates the p53 pathway.

Abstract: WD40-Repeat Protein 62 (WDR62) is required to maintain neural and glial cell populations during embryonic brain growth. Although elevated expression of WDR62 is frequently associated with several tumour types, potential effects of excess WDR62 on proliferative growth remain undefined. Here, we demonstrate that glia specific overexpression of WDR62 in Drosophila larval brains resulted in increased cell size, over-proliferation and increased brain volume, without overt disruption of tissue organization. We further demonstrate WDR62 promoted over-proliferation and brain overgrowth by activating AURKA and pAKT signalling to increase MYC function in glial cells. Together these data suggest WDR62 normally functions in the glial lineage to activate oncogenic signalling networks, promoting proliferation and brain overgrowth.

Abstract: The placenta is an essential organ for the fetus, but its regulatory mechanism for formation of functional trophoblast lineage remains elusive in humans. Although widely known in mice, TEAD4 and its downstream targets CDX2 and GATA3 have not been determined in human models. In this work, we used a human model of trophoblast transition from BAP (BMP4, A83-01 and PD173074)-treated human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and performed multiple gain- and loss-of-function tests of TEAD4, CDX2 or GATA3 to study their roles during this process. Although hESCs with TEAD4 deletion maintain pluripotency, their trophoblast transition potentials are attenuated. This impaired trophoblast transition could be rescued by separately overexpressing TEAD4, CDX2 or GATA3. Furthermore, trophoblast transition from hESCs is also attenuated by knockout of CDX2 but remains unaffected with deletion of GATA3. However, CDX2-overexpressed hESCs maintain pluripotency, whereas overexpression of GATA3 in hESCs leads to spontaneous differentiation including trophoblast lineage. In brief, our findings using a human model of trophoblast transition from BAP-treated hESCs reveal transcription roles of TEAD4, CDX2 and GATA in humans that are different from those in mice. We hope that this evidence can aid in understanding the distinct transcriptional network regulating trophoblast development in humans.

Abstract: Methuosis has been described as a distinctive form of cell death characterized by the displacement of large fluid-filled vacuoles derived from uncontrolled macropinocytosis. Its induction has been proposed as a new strategy against cancer cells. Small molecules, such as indole-based calchones, have been identified as methuosis inducers and, recently, the CK2 inhibitor CX-4945 has been shown to have a similar effect on different cell types. However, the contribution of protein kinase CK2 to methuosis signalling is still controversial. Here we show that methuosis is not related to CK2 activity since it is not affected by structurally unrelated CK2 inhibitors and genetic reduction/ablation of CK2 subunits. Interestingly, CX-5011, a CK2 inhibitor related to CX-4945, behaves as a CK2-independent methuosis inducer, four times more powerful than its parental compound and capable to promote the formation on enlarged cytosolic vacuoles at low micromolar concentrations. We show that pharmacological inhibition of the small GTPase Rac-1, its downregulation by siRNA treatment, or the over-expression of the dominant-negative mutated form of Rac-1 (Rac-1 T17N), impairs CX-5011 ability to induce methuosis. Furthermore, cell treatment with CX-5011 induces a durable activation of Rac-1 that persists for at least 24 h. Worthy of note, CX-5011 is able to promote macropinocytosis not only in mammalian cells, but also in an in-vivo zebrafish model. Based on these evidences, CX-5011 is, therefore, proposed as a potential promising compound for cancer therapies for its dual efficacy as an inhibitor of the pro-survival kinase CK2 and inducer of methuosis.

Abstract: Resistance to DNA-damaging agents is one of the main reasons for the low survival of cervical cancer patients. Previous reports have suggested that the Cdc25A oncoprotein significantly affects the level of susceptibility to DNA-damaging agents, but the molecular mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we used Western blot and flow cytometry analyses to demonstrate that the deubiquitinating enzyme HAUSP stabilizes Cdc25A protein level. Furthermore, in a co-immunoprecipitation assay, we found that HAUSP interacts with and deubiquitinates Cdc25A both exogenously and endogenously. HAUSP extends the half-life of the Cdc25A protein by circumventing turnover. HAUSP knockout in HeLa cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 system caused a significant delay in Cdc25A-mediated cell cycle progression, cell migration, and colony formation and attenuated tumor progression in a mouse xenograft model. Furthermore, HAUSP-mediated stabilization of the Cdc25A protein produced enhanced resistance to DNA-damaging agents. Overall, our study suggests that targeting Cdc25A and HAUSP could be a promising combinatorial approach to halt progression and minimize antineoplastic resistance in cervical cancer.

NMDA-induced nitric oxide generation and CREB activation in central nervous system is dependent on eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase,

Abstract: The NMDA receptor is crucial to several functions in CNS physiology and some of its effects are mediated by promoting nitric oxide production from L-arginine and activation of signaling pathways and the transcription factor CREB. Our previous work demonstrated in retinal cells that increasing intracellular free L-arginine levels directly correlates to nitric oxide (NO) generation and can be promoted by protein synthesis inhibition and increase of free L-arginine concentration. Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K), a calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase, is also known to be activated by NMDA receptors leading to protein synthesis inhibition. Here we explored how does eEF2K participate in NMDA-induced NO signaling. We found that when this enzyme is inhibited, NMDA loses its ability to promote NO synthesis. On the other hand, when NO synthesis is increased by protein synthesis inhibition with cycloheximide or addition of exogenous L-arginine, eEF2K has no participation, showcasing a specific link between this enzyme and NMDA-induced NO signaling. We have previously shown that inhibition of the canonical NO signaling pathway (guanylyl cyclase/cGMP/cGK) blocks CREB activation by glutamate in retinal cells. Interestingly, pharmacological inhibition of eEF2K fully prevents CREB activation by NMDA, once again demonstrating the importance of eEF2K in NMDA receptor signaling. In summary, we demonstrated here a new role for eEF2K, directly controlling NMDA-dependent nitrergic signaling and modulating L-arginine availability in neurons, which can potentially be a new target for the study of physiological and pathological processes involving NMDA receptors in the central nervous system.

Abstract: Guanylate cyclase activating protein 1 (GCAP1) is a neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) involved in the early biochemical steps underlying the phototransduction cascade. By switching from a Ca2+-bound form in the dark to a Mg2+-bound state following light activation of the cascade, GCAP1 triggers the activation of the retinal guanylate cyclase (GC), thus replenishing the levels of 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) necessary to re-open CNG channels. Here, we investigated the structural and functional effects of three missense mutations in GCAP1 associated with cone-rod dystrophy, which severely perturb the homeostasis of cGMP and Ca2+. Substitutions affect residues directly involved in Ca2+ coordination in either EF3 (D100G) or EF4 (E155A and E155G) Ca2+ binding motifs. We found that all GCAP1 variants form relatively stable dimers showing decreased apparent affinity for Ca2+ and blocking the enzyme in a constitutively active state at physiological levels of Ca2+. Interestingly, by corroborating spectroscopic experiments with molecular dynamics simulations we show that beside local structural effects, mutation of the bidentate glutamate in an EF-hand calcium binding motif can profoundly perturb the flexibility of the adjacent EF-hand as well, ultimately destabilizing the whole domain. Therefore, while Ca2+-binding to GCAP1 per se occurs sequentially, allosteric effects may connect EF hand motifs, which appear to be essential for the integrity of the structural switch mechanism in GCAP1, and perhaps in other NCS proteins.

Abstract: Ceramide kinase (CerK) phosphorylates ceramide to ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P). CerK is highly expressed in the brain, and its association with the neuronal function has been reported. Previous reports showed that the activity of CerK is regulated by post-translational modifications including phosphorylation, whereas the cellular fate of CerK protein and its role in neuronal functions have not been clearly elucidated. Therefore, we investigated these issues in PC12 cells. Treatment with nerve growth factor (NGF) for 6 h increased the formation of C1P but not CerK mRNA. Knockdown of CerK and overexpression of HA-tagged CerK down- and up-regulated the formation of C1P, respectively. In PC12-CerK-HA cells, serum withdrawal caused ubiquitination of CerK-HA protein and down-regulated both CerK-HA protein and C1P formation within 6 h, and these down-regulations were abolished by co-treatments with NGF or proteasome inhibitors such as MG132 and clasto-lactacystin. Microscopic analysis showed that treatment with the proteasome inhibitors increased CerK-HA in puncture structures, possibly endosomes and/or vesicles, in cells. Treatment with the lysosome inhibitors reduced serum withdrawal-induced down-regulation of CerK-HA protein but not C1P formation. When knockdown or overexpression of CerK was performed, Ca2+-induced release of [3H] noradrenaline was reduced or enhanced, respectively, but neurite extension was not modified. There was a positive correlation between noradrenaline release and formation of C1P and/or CerK-HA levels in NGF- and clasto-lactacystin-treated cells. These results suggest that levels of CerK were down-regulated by the ubiquitin/proteasome and lysosome pathways and the former pathway-sensitive pool of CerK was suggested to be linked with exocytosis in PC12 cells.

Abstract: Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) via transactivation dependent signalling pathways contributes to a plethora of physiological and pathophysiological responses. In the vasculature, hyperelongation of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains on proteoglycans leads to lipid retention in the intima resulting in the early pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Therefore, we investigated and defined the contribution of transactivation dependent signalling in LPA mediated GAG chain hyperelongation in human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). LPA acting via the LPA receptor 5 (LPAR5) transactivates the TGFBR1 to stimulate the mRNA expression of GAG initiation and elongation genes xylosyltransferase-1 (XYLT1) and chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase-1 (CHST3), respectively. We found that LPA stimulates ROS and Akt signalling in VSMCs, however they are not associated in LPAR5 transactivation of the TGFBR1. We observed that LPA via ROCK dependent pathways transactivates the TGFBR1 to stimulate genes associated with GAG chain elongation. We demonstrate that GPCR transactivation of the TGFBR1 occurs via a universal biochemical mechanism and the identified effectors represent potential therapeutic targets to inhibit pathophysiological effects of GPCR transactivation of the TGFBR1.

Abstract: Stress granules (SGs) are membraneless organelles formed in the cytoplasm by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of translationally-stalled mRNA and RNA-binding proteins during stress response. Understanding the mechanisms governing SG assembly requires imaging SG formation in real time. Although numerous SG proteins have been identified, the kinetics of their recruitment during SG assembly has not been well established. Here we used live cell imaging and super-resolution imaging to visualize SG assembly in human cells. We found that IGF2BP proteins formed microscopically visible clusters in living cells almost instantaneously after osmotic stress, followed by fusion of clusters and the recruitment of G3BP1 and TIA1. Rapid clustering of IGF2BP1 was reduced in cells pretreated with emetine that stabilizes polysomes on mRNA. The KH3/4 di-domain and an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of IGF2BP1 were found to mediate its clustering. Super-resolution imaging confirmed the formation of IGF2BP clusters associated with mRNA at 40 s after osmotic stress. In mature SGs, multiple clusters of poly(A) mRNA were found to associate with the periphery and the interior of a dense granule formed by IGF2BP1. Taken together, our findings revealed a novel, multi-stage LLPS process during osmotic stress, in which rapid clustering of IGF2BP proteins initiates SG assembly.

Abstract: Phosphorylation of sphingosine by sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) produces the bioactive sphingolipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a microvascular and immuno-modulator associated with vascular remodeling in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The low intracellular concentration of S1P is under tight spatial-temporal control. Molecular mechanisms that mediate S1P burden and S1P regulation of vascular remodeling are poorly understood. Similarities between two early response pro-inflammatory cytokine gene transcript activation profiles, S1P and Endothelial Monocyte Activating Polypeptide II (EMAP II), suggested a strategic link between their signaling pathways. We determined that EMAP II triggers a bimodal phosphorylation, transcriptional regulation and membrane translocation of SPHK1 through a common upstream process in both macrophages and pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). EMAP II initiates a dual function of ERK1/2: phosphorylation of SPHK1 and regulation of the transcription factor EGR1 that induces expression of SPHK1. Activated ERK1/2 induces a bimodal phosphorylation of SPHK1 which reciprocally increases S1P levels. This identified common upstream signaling mechanism between a protein and a bioactive lipid initiates cell specific downstream signaling representing a multifactorial mechanism that contributes to inflammation and PASMC proliferation which are cardinal histopathological phenotypes of PAH.

Abstract: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is considered as the key mechanism involved in cancer metastasis. Several studies showed that various cell membrane calcium channels play different roles in cancer metastasis. In the present study, the potential role of ATPase plasma membrane Ca2+ transporting 4 (PMCA4) in regulating EMT in gastric cancer (GC) was investigated. GC patients who underwent radical surgery were enrolled in this study. In vitro human GC cell lines MKN45 and NCI-N87 were used, and MKN45 cells were injected in nude mice to evaluate tumor development. Our results showed that low PMCA4 expression was associated with advanced TNM stage and poor prognosis in GC patients. Knockdown of PMCA4 suppressed E-cadherin, grainyhead like 2 (GRHL2) and ovo-like 1 (OVOL1) expression, up-regulated vimentin expression, increased migration and invasion ability, and promoted the resistance to cytotoxic drug. Furthermore, GC cells displayed an elongated fibroblastoid morphology when PMCA4 was knockdown. PMCA4 overexpression resulted in an up-regulated E-cadherin expression and decreased migration and invasion ability. In vivo metastasis assay showed that PMCA4 overexpression resulted in a decreased incidence of lung metastasis. PMCA4 inhibition increased ZEB1 expression and nuclear accumulation of nuclear factor of activated T-cell isoform c1 (NFATc1). EMT induced by PMCA4 inhibition could be prevented by the knockdown of NFATc1 or ZEB1. In addition, cyclosporine A prevented EMT induced by PMCA4 inhibition by suppressing the NFATc1-ZEB1 pathway. Our data identified a novel mechanism in the regulation of EMT in GC, and provided a novel target in the treatment of EMT subtype in GC.

Abstract: Multi-component photocatalysts have been considered as promising candidates to overcome fast charge recombination phenomena in solar water splitting process, which improve electron utilizations in reductive hydrogen generation. However, most reported multi-component systems have been rarely fabricated by aids with z-scheme type components. Thus, cuprous and cupric oxides are proposed as an excellent example for a z-scheme system with ZnO base materials. The ZnO particles are firstly synthesized by a precipitation method, and CuS components are added on the ZnO particle surfaces in various compositions. The ZnO/CuS materials are then thermally treated under controlled oxygen atmosphere to form cuprous and cupric oxides. To enhance photoactive electrons for reductive water splitting in conduction bands of the photocatalyst system, optimum content of cuprous oxides in the z-scheme components is a critical factor. At the optimum cuprous content (14.3%) in the copper oxides, the highest hydrogen production rate of 1092.5 μmolg-1h-1 is achieved at about 3% apparent quantum yield under the standard solar irradiation.

Abstract: Although anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors have good clinical efficacy, the inevitable development of drug resistance is the most common obstacle to their clinical application. There is an urgent need to develop more effective and selective ALK inhibitors to overcome the problem of drug resistance. Here, we screened a series of ALK inhibitors and found that ZX-29 displayed potent cytotoxic activity against ALK rearrangement non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) NCI-H2228 cells. Then, we investigated the antitumor effects of ZX-29. We demonstrated that ZX-29 time- and dose-dependently inhibited the viability of NCI-H2228 cells, induced cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase, and then they subsequently progressed into cell death. The type of cell death induced by ZX-29 was apoptosis through endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Interestingly, ZX-29 induced protective autophagy, and inhibiting autophagy could enhance the antitumor effect of ZX-29. Furthermore, ZX-29 suppressed tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model. More importantly, ZX-29 could overcome the drug resistance caused by the ALK G1202R mutation. In conclusion, we demonstrated that ZX-29 showed excellent anti-ALK rearrangement NSCLC activity in vitro and in vivo and overcame the drug resistance caused by an ALK mutation. Therefore, ZX-29 is a promising antitumor drug targeting ALK rearrangement or ALK G1202R mutation NSCLC.

Abstract: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a specific form of chronic, progressive and fibrosing interstitial pneumonia of unknown cause. The main feature of IPF is a heterogeneous appearance with areas of sub-pleural fibrosis. However, the mechanism of sub-pleural fibrosis was poorly understood. In this study, our in vivo study revealed that pleural mesothelial cells (PMCs) migrated into lung parenchyma and localized alongside lung fibroblasts in sub-pleural area in mouse pulmonary fibrosis. Our in vitro study displayed that cultured-PMCs-medium induced lung fibroblasts transforming into myofibroblast, cultured-fibroblasts-medium promoted mesothelial-mesenchymal transition of PMCs. Furthermore, these changes in lung fibroblasts and PMCs were prevented by blocking TGF-β1/Smad2/3 signaling with SB431542. TGF-β1 neutralized antibody attenuated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Similar to TGF-β1/Smad2/3 signaling, wnt/β-catenin signaling was also activated in the process of PMCs crosstalk with lung fibroblasts. Moreover, inhibition of CD147 attenuated cultured-PMCs-medium induced collagen-I synthesis in lung fibroblasts. Blocking CD147 signaling also prevented bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Our data indicated that crosstalk between PMC and lung fibroblast contributed to sub-pleural pulmonary fibrosis. TGF-β1, Wnt/β-catenin and CD147 signaling was involved in the underling mechanism.

Abstract: Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit 3 and structural gene Y-linked (Eif2s3y) gene, the gene encoding eIF2γ protein, is globally expressed in all tissues and plays important roles in regulating global and gene-specific mRNA translation initiation. It has been noticed that Eif2s3y plays crucial roles in spermatogenesis, however, the mechanism remains unclear. In the current study, transgenic Eif2s3y mice were generated to test our hypothesis that the Eif2s3y promotes the proliferation of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). Transgenic Eif2s3y mouse had enhanced SSCs proliferation rate when compared to WT mouse. Interesting, the testes from transgenic Eif2s3y mouse had increased Active-β-catenin protein expression and higher expression pattern of Wnt ligand Wnt6 when compared to testes from WT mouse. This study revealed novel roles of Eif2s3y in the activation Wnt6/β-catenin signal pathway in SSCs. Taken together, we identified Eif2s3y-Wnt6-β-catenin as a critical pathway in the regulation of spermatogenesis, which provides a platform for investigating the molecular mechanisms of male reproduction.

Abstract: Peroxisomes are highly dynamic subcellular compartments with important functions in lipid and ROS metabolism. Impaired peroxisomal function can lead to severe metabolic disorders with developmental defects and neurological abnormalities. Recently, a new group of disorders has been identified, characterised by defects in the membrane dynamics and division of peroxisomes rather than by loss of metabolic functions. However, the contribution of impaired peroxisome plasticity to the pathophysiology of those disorders is not well understood. Mitochondrial fission factor (MFF) is a key component of both the peroxisomal and mitochondrial division machinery. Patients with MFF deficiency present with developmental and neurological abnormalities. Peroxisomes (and mitochondria) in patient fibroblasts are highly elongated as a result of impaired organelle division. The majority of studies into MFF-deficiency have focused on mitochondrial dysfunction, but the contribution of peroxisomal alterations to the pathophysiology is largely unknown. Here, we show that MFF deficiency does not cause alterations to overall peroxisomal biochemical function. However, loss of MFF results in reduced import-competency of the peroxisomal compartment and leads to the accumulation of pre-peroxisomal membrane structures. We show that peroxisomes in MFF-deficient cells display alterations in peroxisomal redox state and intra-peroxisomal pH. Removal of elongated peroxisomes through induction of autophagic processes is not impaired. A mathematical model describing key processes involved in peroxisome dynamics sheds further light into the physical processes disturbed in MFF-deficient cells. The consequences of our findings for the pathophysiology of MFF-deficiency and related disorders with impaired peroxisome plasticity are discussed.

Abstract: Throughout development, neuronal progenitors undergo complex transformation into polarized nerve cells, warranting the directional flow of information in the neural grid. The majority of neuronal polarization studies have been carried out on rodent-derived precursor cells, programmed to develop into neurons. Unlike rodent neuronal cells, SH-SY5Y cells derived from human bone marrow present a sub-clone of neuroblastoma line, with their transformation into neuron-like cells showing a range of highly instructive neurobiological characteristics. We applied two-step retinoic acid (RA) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protocol to monitor the conversion of undifferentiated SH-SY5Y into neuron-like cells with distinctly polarized axon-dendritic morphology and formation of bona fide synaptic connections. We show that BDNF is a key driver and regulator of the expression of axonal marker tau and dendritic microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP2), with their sorting to distinct cellular compartments. Using selective kinase inhibitors downregulating BDNF-TrkB signaling, we demonstrate that constitutive activation of TrkB receptor is essential for the maintenance of established polarization morphology. Importantly, the proximity ligation assay applied in our preparation demonstrates that differentiating neuron-like cells develop elaborate synaptic connections enriched with hallmark pre- and postsynaptic proteins. Described herein findings highlight several fundamental processes related to neuronal polarization and synaptogenesis in human-derived cells, which are of major relevance to neurobiology and translational neuroscience.

Abstract: Amlexanox, an anti-inflammatory agent, is widely used for treating aphthous ulcers. Recently, amlexanox has received considerable attention because of its efficacy in mitigating metabolic inflammation via directly suppressing IKKε/TBK1. However, because the knockdown of IKKε/TBK1 has no anti-inflammatory effect on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-primed RAW264.7 cells, the mechanism of amlexanox against classical inflammation is independent of IKKε/TBK1. In this study, we aim to examine the effects of amlexanox on LPS-treated macrophages and in a mouse model of endotoxemia. We found that amlexanox significantly inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, both in vitro and in vivo, while increased interleukin-10 level in LPS-activated macrophages. Mechanistically, amlexanox down-regulated nuclear factor κB and extracellular signal-regulated kinase/activator protein-1 signaling by elevating intracellular 3′,5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) level and subsequently activating protein kinase A. Molecular docking along with fluorescence polarization and enzyme inhibition assays revealed that amlexanox bound directly to phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4B to inhibit its activity. The anti-inflammatory effects of amlexanox could be abolished by the application of cAMP antagonist or PDE4B siRNA. In addition to PDE4B, the activities of PDE1C, 3A, and 3B were directly inhibited by amlexanox. Our results provide mechanistic insight into the clinical utility of amlexanox for the treatment of inflammatory disorders and might contribute to extending the clinical indications of amlexanox.

Metabotropic signaling cascade involved in α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-mediated PKCβII activation,

Abstract: Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) belong to the ionophore receptor family, which regulates plasma membrane conductance to Na+, K+, and Ca2+ ions. Some studies, however, have shown that nAChRs also employ second messengers for intracellular signaling. We previously showed that α4β2 nAChR mediates the translocation of protein kinase CβII (PKCβII) from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane, which is a typical activation marker for PKCβII. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying PKCβII activation through α4β2 nAChR. α4β2 nAChR is the most abundant nAChR subtype and is implicated in various brain functions and diseases. Putative α4β2 nAChR signaling components were identified by knockdown or chemical inhibition of candidate proteins, and the signaling cascade was deduced by protein interactions in predicted cellular components. α4β2 nAChR-mediated PKCβII translocation was found to occur in an ionophore activity-independent manner. Nicotinic stimulation of α4β2 nAChR activated Src in a β-arrestin1 and 14–3-3η-dependent manner. Activated Src phosphorylated the tyrosine residue(s) on Syk molecules, which in turn interacted with phospholipase C γ1 to trigger the translocation of PKCβII to the cell membrane by elevating cellular diacylglycerol levels. The activated PKCβII in turn exerted a positive feedback effect on Src activation, suggesting that α4β2 nAChR signaling is amplified by a positive feedback loop. These findings provide novel information for unveiling the previously unclear metabotropic second messenger-based signal transduction pathway of nAChRs.

Abstract: Lipid droplets (LDs) play regulatory role in various cells but their significance in endothelial pathophysiology is still not well understood. Here, we studied LDs in in situ endothelial cells (ECs) in isolated blood vessels stimulated with pro-inflammatory or pro-apoptotic stimuli using Raman and fluorescence imaging. Endothelial inflammation induced by murine TNF-α (mTNF-α) was featured by overexpression of ICAM-1, vWF, increased production of PGI2, and was associated with the formation of low number of LDs. However in the presence of atglistatin, the inhibitor of triacyclglycerols hydrolysis, the number of LDs significantly increased. In contrast, in endothelium stimulated by human TNF-α (hTNF-α) or FasL, apart from endothelial inflammation, displayed also apoptosis as evidenced by high annexin expression and significant LDs formation. Raman imaging confirmed that LDs were localized in endothelium and revealed significant heterogeneity in biochemical composition of endothelial LDs that dependent on endothelial stimuli. Repertoire of LDs included LDs rich in highly unsaturated lipids, assigned to the inflammation, as well as LDs featured by more saturated lipids linked to apoptosis, where Raman signals indicating content of cholesterol and phospholipids were higher for endothelial apoptosis in comparison to endothelial inflammation. The heterogeneity in chemical composition of LDs suggested more complex pathophysiological role of endothelial LDs then previously appreciated.
