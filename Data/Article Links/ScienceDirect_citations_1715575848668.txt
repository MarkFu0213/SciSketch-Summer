Abstract: Summary
Selective autophagy receptors and adapters contain short linear motifs called LIR motifs (LC3-interacting region), which are required for the interaction with the Atg8-family proteins. LIR motifs bind to the hydrophobic pockets of the LIR motif docking site (LDS) of the respective Atg8-family proteins. The physiological significance of LDS docking sites has not been clarified in vivo. Here, we show that Atg8a-LDS mutant Drosophila flies accumulate autophagy substrates and have reduced lifespan. Using quantitative proteomics to identify the proteins that accumulate in Atg8a-LDS mutants, we identify the cis-Golgi protein GMAP (Golgi microtubule-associated protein) as a LIR motif-containing protein that interacts with Atg8a. GMAP LIR mutant flies exhibit accumulation of Golgi markers and elongated Golgi morphology. Our data suggest that GMAP mediates the turnover of Golgi by selective autophagy to regulate its morphology and size via its LIR motif-mediated interaction with Atg8a.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer-associated mutations in genes encoding histones dramatically reshape chromatin and support tumorigenesis. Lysine to methionine substitution of residue 27 on histone H3 (K27M) is a driver mutation in high-grade pediatric gliomas, known to abrogate polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) activity. We applied single-molecule systems to image individual nucleosomes and delineate the combinatorial epigenetic patterns associated with H3-K27M expression. We found that chromatin marks on H3-K27M-mutant nucleosomes are dictated both by their incorporation preferences and by intrinsic properties of the mutation. Mutant nucleosomes not only preferentially bind PRC2 but also directly interact with MLL1, leading to genome-wide redistribution of H3K4me3. H3-K27M-mediated deregulation of repressive and active chromatin marks leads to unbalanced “bivalent” chromatin, which may support a poorly differentiated cellular state. This study provides evidence for a direct effect of H3-K27M oncohistone on the MLL1-H3K4me3 pathway and highlights the capability of single-molecule tools to reveal mechanisms of chromatin deregulation in cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Resident microbes in skin and gut predominantly impact local immune cell function during homeostasis. However, colitis-associated neutrophilic skin disorders suggest possible breakdown of this compartmentalization with disease. Using a model wherein neonatal skin colonization by Staphylococcus epidermidis facilitates generation of commensal-specific tolerance and CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), we ask whether this response is perturbed by gut inflammation. Chemically induced colitis is accompanied by intestinal expansion of S. epidermidis and reduces gut-draining lymph node (dLN) commensal-specific Tregs. It also results in reduced commensal-specific Tregs in skin and skin-dLNs and increased skin neutrophils. Increased CD4+ circulation between gut and skin dLN suggests that the altered cutaneous response is initiated in the colon, and resistance to colitis-induced effects in Cd4creIl1r1fl/fl mice implicate interleukin (IL)-1 in mediating the altered commensal-specific response. These findings provide mechanistic insight into observed connections between inflammatory skin and intestinal diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Tissue-resident macrophages adapt to local signals within tissues to acquire specific functions. Neoplasia transforms the tissue, raising the question as to how the environmental perturbations contribute to tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) identity and functions. Combining single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with spatial localization of distinct TAM subsets by imaging, we discover that TAM transcriptomic programs follow two main differentiation paths according to their localization in the stroma or in the neoplastic epithelium of the mammary duct. Furthermore, this diversity is exclusively detected in a spontaneous tumor model and tracks the different tissue territories as well as the type of tumor lesion. These TAM subsets harbor distinct capacity to activate CD8+ T cells and phagocyte tumor cells, supporting that specific tumor regions, rather than defined activation states, are the major drivers of TAM plasticity and heterogeneity. The distinctions created here provide a framework to design cancer treatment targeting specific TAM niches.

Abstract: Summary
The mammalian KU70 is a pleiotropic protein functioning in DNA repair and cytoplasmic suppression of apoptosis. We report a regulatory mechanism by which KU70’s cytoplasmic function is enabled due to a methylation at K570 of KU70 by SET-domain-containing protein 4 (SETD4). While SETD4 silencing reduces the level of methylated KU70, over-expression of SETD4 enhances methylation of KU70. Mutations of Y272 and Y284 of SETD4 abrogate methylation of KU70. Although SETD4 is predominantly a nuclear protein, the methylated KU70 is enriched in the cytoplasm. SETD4 knockdown enhances staurosporine (STS)-induced apoptosis and cell killing. Over-expression of the wild-type (WT) SETD4, but not the SETD4-Y272/Y284F mutant, suppresses STS-induced apoptosis. The KU70-K570R (mouse Ku70-K568R) mutation dampens the anti-apoptosis activity of KU70. Our study identifies KU70 as a non-histone substrate of SETD4, discovers a post-translational modification of KU70, and uncovers a role for SETD4 and KU70-K570 methylation in the suppression of apoptosis.

Abstract: Summary
Serotonin (or 5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is an important neurotransmitter that activates 12 different G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) through selective coupling of Gs, Gi, or Gq proteins. The structural basis for G protein subtype selectivity by these GPCRs remains elusive. Here, we report the structures of the serotonin receptors 5-HT4, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 with Gs, and 5-HT4 with Gi1. The structures reveal that transmembrane helices TM5 and TM6 alternate lengths as a macro-switch to determine receptor’s selectivity for Gs and Gi, respectively. We find that the macro-switch by the TM5-TM6 length is shared by class A GPCR-G protein structures. Furthermore, we discover specific residues within TM5 and TM6 that function as micro-switches to form specific interactions with Gs or Gi. Together, these results present a common mechanism of Gs versus Gi protein coupling selectivity or promiscuity by class A GPCRs and extend the basis of ligand recognition at serotonin receptors.

Abstract: Summary
Non-alcoholic steatotic liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. NAFLD has a major effect on the intrinsic proliferative properties of hepatocytes. Here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the activation of DNA damage response during NAFLD. Proliferating mouse NAFLD hepatocytes harbor replication stress (RS) with an alteration of the replication fork’s speed and activation of ATR pathway, which is sufficient to cause DNA breaks. Nucleotide pool imbalance occurring during NAFLD is the key driver of RS. Remarkably, DNA lesions drive cGAS/STING pathway activation, a major component of cells’ intrinsic immune response. The translational significance of this study was reiterated by showing that lipid overload in proliferating HepaRG was sufficient to induce RS and nucleotide pool imbalance. Moreover, livers from NAFLD patients displayed nucleotide pathway deregulation and cGAS/STING gene alteration. Altogether, our findings shed light on the mechanisms by which damaged NAFLD hepatocytes might promote disease progression.

Abstract: Summary
The human respiratory epithelium is derived from a progenitor cell in the distal buds of the developing lung. These “bud tip progenitors” are regulated by reciprocal signaling with surrounding mesenchyme; however, mesenchymal heterogeneity and function in the developing human lung are poorly understood. We interrogated single-cell RNA sequencing data from multiple human lung specimens and identified a mesenchymal cell population present during development that is highly enriched for expression of the WNT agonist RSPO2, and we found that the adjacent bud tip progenitors are enriched for the RSPO2 receptor LGR5. Functional experiments using organoid models, explant cultures, and FACS-isolated RSPO2+ mesenchyme show that RSPO2 is a critical niche cue that potentiates WNT signaling in bud tip progenitors to support their maintenance and multipotency.

Abstract: Introduction
The objective of the study was to observe whether connexin 43 (Cx43) could regulate epithelial mesenchymal transformation (EMT) of renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) by influencing Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, and whether ASV could inhibit the development of renal interstitial fibrosis by regulating Cx43.
Methods
Lentivirus infection was transfected into RTECs with the final concentration of 50 ×PFU/ cell to regulate the expression of Cx43. And RTECs were intervened by different doses of Astragaloside IV (ASV). After synchronous culture of RTECs in each group，the expression levels of EMT-related indicators and Cx43 were detected by fluorescence microscope and Western-Blotting (WB), even the protein expressions and phosphorylation levels of AKT and mTOR in different groups were detected by WB.
Results
When the expression of Cx43 in RTECs was regulated by lentivirus infection, the degree of EMT induced by TGF‑β1 and the phosphorylation level of Akt and mTOR were changed accordingly, indicating that Akt/mTOR pathway might be a downstream molecular mechanism by which Cx43 could regulate EMT. After intervention with different doses of ASV, the expression level of Cx43 increased with obvious concentration dependence, and the expression levels of p-Akt and p- mTOR were significantly altered, suggesting that ASV could effectively increase the protein expressions of TGF‑β1-induced Cx43 in RTECs and inhibit the phosphorylation levels of Akt and mTOR.
Conclusion
Cx43 were the main material basis of RTECs’ injury, and ASV could inhibit TGF-β1- induced RTECs’ transdifferentiation. In-depth study of the mechanism might provide a broad application prospect for the treatment of renal interstitial fibrosis.

Abstract: Summary
Temperate bacterial viruses are commonly thought to favor vertical (lysogenic) transmission over horizontal (lytic) transmission when the virion-to-host-cell ratio is high and available host cells become scarce. In P22-infected Salmonella Typhimurium populations, however, we find that host subpopulations become lytically consumed despite high phage-to-host ratios that would normally favor lysogeny. These subpopulations originate from the proliferation of P22-free siblings that spawn off from P22-carrier cells from which they cytoplasmically inherit P22-borne superinfection exclusion factors (SEFs). In fact, we demonstrate that the gradual dilution of these SEFs in the growing subpopulation of P22-free siblings restricts the number of incoming phages, thereby imposing the perception of a low phage-to-host ratio that favors lytic development. Although their role has so far been neglected, our data indicate that phage-borne SEFs can spur complex infection dynamics and a history-dependent switch from vertical to horizontal transmission in the face of host-cell scarcity.

Abstract: Summary
Intestinal epithelial tight junction disruption is a primary contributing factor in alcohol-associated endotoxemia, systemic inflammation, and multiple organ damage. Ethanol and acetaldehyde disrupt tight junctions by elevating intracellular Ca2+. Here we identify TRPV6, a Ca2+-permeable channel, as responsible for alcohol-induced elevation of intracellular Ca2+, intestinal barrier dysfunction, and systemic inflammation. Ethanol and acetaldehyde elicit TRPV6 ionic currents in Caco-2 cells. Studies in Caco-2 cell monolayers and mouse intestinal organoids show that TRPV6 deficiency or inhibition attenuates ethanol- and acetaldehyde-induced Ca2+ influx, tight junction disruption, and barrier dysfunction. Moreover, Trpv6−/− mice are resistant to alcohol-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction. Photoaffinity labeling of 3-azibutanol identifies a histidine as a potential alcohol-binding site in TRPV6. The substitution of this histidine, and a nearby arginine, reduces ethanol-activated currents. Our findings reveal that TRPV6 is required for alcohol-induced gut barrier dysfunction and inflammation. Molecules that decrease TRPV6 function have the potential to attenuate alcohol-associated tissue injury.

Abstract: Aim
The study aimed to investigate asprosin (ASP) and meteorin-like (METRNL) protein immunoreactivity in invasive ductal breast cancer.
Materials and methods
Overall, 60 cases of invasive ductal breast cancer (20 cases each of Grade 1, 2 and 3) were evaluated in addition to 20 normal breast tissues obtained from the Pathology Department Archive. ASP and METRNL expressions were assessed using immunohistochemical staining and visualised under a light microscope.
Results
There was a significant difference in ASP and METRNL immunoreactivity among all the groups included in the study (p < 0.001). Cancer tissues with Grade 1, 2 and 3 showed a significant increase in ASP and METRNL immunoreactivity compared with the control group; however, no significant difference was noted among the cancer tissues with Grade 1, 2 and 3.
Conclusions
ASP and METRNL immunoreactivity increased at the cellular level in invasive ductal breast cancer, but there was no difference in immunoreactivity among the breast cancer grades.

Abstract: Summary
Angiogenesis, the active formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones, is a complex and demanding biological process that plays an important role in physiological as well as pathological settings. Recent evidence supports cell metabolism as a critical regulator of angiogenesis. However, whether and how cell metabolism regulates endothelial growth factor receptor levels and nucleotide synthesis remains elusive. We here shown in both human cell lines and mouse models that during developmental and pathological angiogenesis, endothelial cells (ECs) use glutaminolysis-derived glutamate to produce aspartate (Asp) via aspartate aminotransferase (AST/GOT). Asp leads to mTORC1 activation which, in turn, regulates endothelial translation machinery for VEGFR2 and FGFR1 synthesis. Asp-dependent mTORC1 pathway activation also regulates de novo pyrimidine synthesis in angiogenic ECs. These findings identify glutaminolysis-derived Asp as a regulator of mTORC1-dependent endothelial translation and pyrimidine synthesis. Our studies may help overcome anti-VEGF therapy resistance by targeting endothelial growth factor receptor translation.

Abstract: Summary
Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a leading cause of inherited intellectual disability and autism. Whereas dysregulated RNA translation in Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice, a model of FXS, is well studied, little is known about aberrant transcription. Using single-molecule mRNA detection, we show that mRNA encoding the AMPAR subunit GluA2 (but not GluA1) is elevated in dendrites and at transcription sites of hippocampal neurons of Fmr1 KO mice, indicating elevated GluA2 transcription. We identify CPEB3, a protein implicated in memory consolidation, as an upstream effector critical to GluA2 mRNA expression in FXS. Increased GluA2 mRNA is translated into an increase in GluA2 subunits, a switch in synaptic AMPAR phenotype from GluA2-lacking, Ca2+-permeable to GluA2-containing, Ca2+-impermeable, reduced inhibitory synaptic transmission, and loss of NMDAR-independent LTP at glutamatergic synapses onto CA1 inhibitory interneurons. These factors could contribute to an excitatory/inhibitory imbalance—a common theme in FXS and other autism spectrum disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Antigen presentation by the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) on the cell surface is critical for the transduction of the immune signal toward cytotoxic T lymphocytes. DNA damage upregulates HLA class I presentation; however, the mechanism is unclear. Here, we show that DNA-damage-induced HLA (di-HLA) presentation requires an immunoproteasome, PSMB8/9/10, and antigen-transporter, TAP1/2, demonstrating that antigen production is essential. Furthermore, we show that di-HLA presentation requires ATR, AKT, mTORC1, and p70-S6K signaling. Notably, the depletion of CBP20, a factor initiating the pioneer round of translation (PRT) that precedes nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), abolishes di-HLA presentation, suggesting that di-antigen production requires PRT. RNA-seq analysis demonstrates that DNA damage reduces NMD transcripts in an ATR-dependent manner, consistent with the requirement for ATR in the initiation of PRT/NMD. Finally, bioinformatics analysis identifies that PRT-derived 9-mer peptides bind to HLA and are potentially immunogenic. Therefore, DNA damage signaling produces immunogenic antigens by utilizing the machinery of PRT/NMD.

Abstract: Summary
γδ T cells are generally considered innate-like lymphocytes, however, an “adaptive-like” γδ compartment has now emerged. To understand transcriptional regulation of adaptive γδ T cell immunobiology, we combined single-cell transcriptomics, T cell receptor (TCR)-clonotype assignment, ATAC-seq, and immunophenotyping. We show that adult Vδ1+ T cells segregate into TCF7+LEF1+Granzyme Bneg (Tnaive) or T-bet+Eomes+BLIMP-1+Granzyme B+ (Teffector) transcriptional subtypes, with clonotypically expanded TCRs detected exclusively in Teffector cells. Transcriptional reprogramming mirrors changes within CD8+ αβ T cells following antigen-specific maturation and involves chromatin remodeling, enhancing cytokine production and cytotoxicity. Consistent with this, in vitro TCR engagement induces comparable BLIMP-1, Eomes, and T-bet expression in naive Vδ1+ and CD8+ T cells. Finally, both human cytomegalovirus and Plasmodium falciparum infection in vivo drive adaptive Vδ1 T cell differentiation from Tnaive to Teffector transcriptional status, alongside clonotypic expansion. Contrastingly, semi-invariant Vγ9+Vδ2+ T cells exhibit a distinct “innate-effector” transcriptional program established by early childhood. In summary, adaptive-like γδ subsets undergo a pathogen-driven differentiation process analogous to conventional CD8+ T cells.

Activated microglia release extracellular vesicles (EVs) as modulators of brain homeostasis and innate immunity. However, the molecules critical for regulating EV production from microglia are poorly understood. Here we establish a murine microglial cell model to monitor EV secretion by measuring the fluorescence signal of tdTomato, which is linked to tetraspanin CD63. Stimulation of tdTomato+ cells with ATP induces rapid secretion of EVs and a reduction in cellular tdTomato intensity, reflecting EV secretion. We generate a GFP+ tdTomato+ cell library expressing TurboGFP and barcoded short hairpin RNAs for genome-wide screening using next-generation sequencing. We identify Mcfd2, Sepp1, and Sdc1 as critical regulators of ATP-induced EV secretion from murine microglia. Small interfering RNA (siRNA-based) silencing of each of these genes suppresses lipopolysaccharide- and ATP-induced inflammasome activation, as determined by interleukin-1β release from primary cultured murine microglia. These molecules are critical for microglial EV secretion and are potential therapeutic targets for neuroinflammatory disorders.

Abstract: Summary
The interactions between the striatal cholinergic and GABAergic systems are crucial in shaping reward-related behavior and reinforcement learning; however, the synaptic pathways mediating them are largely unknown. Here, we use Chrna2-Cre mice to characterize striatal interneurons (INs) expressing the nicotinic α2 receptor subunit. Using triple patch-clamp recordings combined with optogenetic stimulations, we characterize the electrophysiological, morphological, and synaptic properties of striatal Chrna2-INs. Striatal Chrna2-INs have diverse electrophysiological properties, distinct from their counterparts in other brain regions, including the hippocampus and neocortex. Unlike in other regions, most striatal Chrna2-INs are fast-spiking INs expressing parvalbumin. Striatal Chrna2-INs are intricately integrated in the striatal microcircuit, forming inhibitory synaptic connections with striatal projection neurons and INs, including other Chrna2-INs. They receive excitatory inputs from primary motor cortex mediated by both AMPA and NMDA receptors. A subpopulation of Chrna2-INs responds to nicotinic input, suggesting reciprocal interactions between this GABAergic interneuron population and striatal cholinergic synapses.

Abstract: Summary
The proteasome holoenzyme regulates the cellular proteome via degrading most proteins. In its 19-subunit regulatory particle (RP), a heterohexameric ATPase enables protein degradation by injecting protein substrates into the core peptidase. RP assembly utilizes “checkpoints,” where multiple dedicated chaperones bind to specific ATPase subunits and control the addition of other subunits. Here, we find that the RP assembly checkpoint relies on two common features of the chaperones. Individual chaperones can distinguish an RP, in which their cognate ATPase persists in the ATP-bound state. Chaperones then together modulate ATPase activity to facilitate RP subunit rearrangements for switching to an active, substrate-processing state in the resulting proteasome holoenzyme. Thus, chaperones may sense ATP binding and hydrolysis as a readout for the quality of the RP complex to generate a functional proteasome holoenzyme. Our findings provide a basis to potentially exploit the assembly checkpoints in situations with known deregulation of proteasomal ATPase chaperones.

Abstract: Summary
Stem cell renewal and differentiation are regulated by interactions with the niche. Although multiple cell populations have been identified in distinct anatomical compartments, little is known about niche-specific molecular factors. Using skin as a model system and combining single-cell RNA-seq data analysis, immunofluorescence, and transgenic mouse models, we show that the transmembrane protein embigin is specifically expressed in the sebaceous gland and that the number of embigin-expressing cells is negatively regulated by Wnt. The loss of embigin promotes exit from the progenitor compartment and progression toward differentiation, and also compromises lipid metabolism. Embigin modulates sebaceous niche architecture by affecting extracellular matrix organization and basolateral targeting of monocarboxylate transport. We discover through ligand screening that embigin is a direct fibronectin receptor, binding to the N-terminal fibronectin domain without impairing integrin function. Our results solve the long-standing question of how embigin regulates cell adhesion and demonstrate a mechanism that couples adhesion and metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Recruitment of stem cells is crucial for tissue repair. Although stem cell niches can provide important signals, little is known about mechanisms that coordinate the engagement of disseminated stem cells across an injured tissue. In Drosophila, adult brain lesions trigger local recruitment of scattered dormant neural stem cells suggesting a mechanism for creating a transient stem cell activation zone. Here, we find that injury triggers a coordinated response in neuro-glial clusters that promotes the spread of a neuron-derived stem cell factor via glial secretion of the lipocalin-like transporter Swim. Strikingly, swim is induced in a Hif1-α-dependent manner in response to brain hypoxia. Mammalian Swim (Lcn7) is also upregulated in glia of the mouse hippocampus upon brain injury. Our results identify a central role of neuro-glial clusters in promoting neural stem cell activation at a distance, suggesting a conserved function of the HIF1-α/Swim/Wnt module in connecting injury-sensing and regenerative outcomes.

Abstract: DJ-1 is one of the causative genes of early-onset familial Parkinson’s disease (PD). As a result, DJ-1 influences the pathogenesis of sporadic PD. DJ-1 has various physiological functions that converge to control the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Based on genetic analyses that sought to investigate novel antioxidant DJ-1 downstream genes, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinase (PDK) was demonstrated to increase survival rates and decrease dopaminergic (DA) neuron loss in DJ-1 mutant flies under oxidative stress. PDK phosphorylates and inhibits the PDH complex (PDC), subsequently downregulating glucose metabolism in the mitochondria, which is a major source of intracellular ROS. A loss-of-function mutation in PDK was not found to have a significant effect on fly development and reproduction, but severely ameliorated oxidative stress resistance. Thus, PDK plays a critical role in the protection against oxidative stress. Loss of PDH phosphatase (PDP), which dephosphorylates and activates PDH, was also shown to protect DJ-1 mutants from oxidative stress, ultimately supporting our findings. Further genetic analyses suggested that DJ-1 controls PDK expression through hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), a transcriptional regulator of the adaptive response to hypoxia and oxidative stress. Furthermore, CPI-613, an inhibitor of PDH, protected DJ-1 null flies from oxidative stress, suggesting that the genetic and pharmacological inhibition of PDH may be a novel treatment strategy for PD associated with DJ-1 dysfunction.

Abstract: Background
In process of infiltrating growth in solid tumor, the tumor cells undergo a periodic hypoxia/reoxygenation (circulating hypoxia) microenvironment, which might be one of principle reasons to promote formation of tumor heterogeneity and treatment failure. Therefore, it is very important to study how the microenvironment of circulating hypoxia induces the heterogeneous subclones in tumors.
Material and Methods
The maximum cross-section of luminal A tumor (LAT) was selected for the expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) and estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-alpha), and the correlation between it and tumor diameter was observed. The distribution of intratumoral micro-vessels were analyzed by 3D reconstruction and CD34 staining. A circulating hypoxia model of MCF-7 was established to detect the HIF-1alpha and ER-alpha.
Results
There was a negative correlation between the expressions of ER-alpha and HIF-1alpha (c=−2.40; p = 0.044) in the LAT. As shown by 3D ultrasound image, there were less functional micro-vessels in the center than the periphery of tumor(P < 0.05). ER-alpha expression gradually decreased with the time course of cycling hypoxia, which is inversely related to the expression of HIF-1alpha.
Conclusion
LAT is composed of heterogeneous subclone cells which can be distinguished by ER-alpha and HIF-1alpha, which was closely related with cycling hypoxia microenvironment.

Abstract: Background
When the abnormality occurs in proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis of trophoblasts, the invasion ability of placental trophoblast is weakened, which is prone to trigger the occurrence of various pregnancy diseases such as repeated spontaneous abortion (RSA). Clinically, Astragalus and Codonopsis pilosula polysaccharides (APS and CPPS) are used for the treatment of unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion (URSA). Therefore, we aimed to probe into the roles of APS and CPPS in biological behaviors of placental trophoblasts.
Methods
The trophoblasts were treated with APS and CPPS, and transfected with miR-92a-1–5p mimic and CCR7 plasmid to explore the roles of APS and CPPS. Cell viability and apoptosis were determined by CCK-8 and flow cytometry, respectively. The levels of miRNA/mRNA and protein were measured by qRT-PCR and western blot, respectively. The interaction between miR-92a-1–5p and CCR7 was analyzed by TargetScan and dual-luciferase reporter assay. Invasion and migration rates were assessed by Transwell and wound healing assays, respectively.
Results
APS combined with CPPS enhanced viability, Bcl-2 expression, and migration and invasion capabilities, while suppressing apoptosis, and expressions of Bax, Bim and miR-92a-1–5p in trophoblasts. Nevertheless, miR-92a-1–5p mimic produced the inverse modulations in trophoblasts, and partially reversed the effects of APS and CPPS. Furthermore, overexpression of CCR7, the target of miR-92a-1–5p, partially offset the effect of miR-92a-1–5p mimic in trophoblasts.
Conclusion
Astragalus combined with Codonopsis pilosula polysaccharides modulates the biological behaviors of trophoblasts via miR-92a-1–5p/CCR7 axis. The regulatory axis we studied will be helpful for the treatment of URSA in the future.

Abstract: Common marmosets are non-human primate models used in biomedical research and genome editing technology. This study aimed to establish cell lines from common marmosets and evaluate their characteristics. We obtained normal fibroblasts derived from muscle tissues of two common marmosets and immortalized them with the introduction of a mutat form of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4R24C), Cyclin D1, and telomere reverse transcriptase (TERT) using the piggyBac transposon. Compared to parental cells, the immortalized cell lines (named K4DT cells) showed telomerase activity and an accelerated cell proliferation rate. To our knowledge, this is the first study describing the successful establishment of immortalized common marmoset-derived fibroblasts using piggyBac transposition of CDK4R24C, Cyclin D1, and TERT. Our generated cell lines might be a beneficial tool for future studies on disease modeling and targeted gene therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Aerobic exercise is associated with decreased cancer incidence and cancer-associated mortality. However, little is known about the effects of exercise on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), a disease for which current therapeutic options are limited. Herein, we show that aerobic exercise reduces PDA tumor growth, by modulating systemic and intra-tumoral immunity. Mechanistically, exercise promotes immune mobilization and accumulation of tumor-infiltrating IL15Rα+ CD8 T cells, which are responsible for the tumor-protective effects. In clinical samples, an exercise-dependent increase of intra-tumoral CD8 T cells is also observed. Underscoring the translational potential of the interleukin (IL)-15/IL-15Rα axis, IL-15 super-agonist (NIZ985) treatment attenuates tumor growth, prolongs survival, and enhances sensitivity to chemotherapy. Finally, exercise or NIZ985 both sensitize pancreatic tumors to αPD-1, with improved anti-tumor and survival benefits. Collectively, our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of an exercise-oncology axis and identify IL-15 activation as a promising treatment strategy for this deadly disease.

Abstract: Summary
Most eukaryotic messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are processed at their 3′ end by the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPF/CPSF). CPF mediates the endonucleolytic cleavage of the pre-mRNA and addition of a polyadenosine (poly(A)) tail, which together define the 3′ end of the mature transcript. The activation of CPF is highly regulated to maintain the fidelity of RNA processing. Here, using cryo-EM of yeast CPF, we show that the Mpe1 subunit directly contacts the polyadenylation signal sequence in nascent pre-mRNA. The region of Mpe1 that contacts RNA also promotes the activation of CPF endonuclease activity and controls polyadenylation. The Cft2 subunit of CPF antagonizes the RNA-stabilized configuration of Mpe1. In vivo, the depletion or mutation of Mpe1 leads to widespread defects in transcription termination by RNA polymerase II, resulting in transcription interference on neighboring genes. Together, our data suggest that Mpe1 plays a major role in accurate 3′ end processing, activating CPF, and ensuring timely transcription termination.

Abstract: Summary
Antibodies are important for vaccine efficacy. Targeting antigens to antigen-presenting cells (APCs) increases antibody levels. Here, we explore the role of antigen valency in MHC class II (MHCII)-targeted vaccines delivered as DNA. We design heterodimeric proteins that carry either two identical (bivalent vaccines), or two different antigens (monovalent vaccines). Bivalent vaccines with two identical influenza hemagglutinins (HA) elicit higher amounts of anti-HA antibodies in mice than monovalent versions with two different HAs. Bivalent vaccines increase the levels of germinal center (GC) B cells and long-lived plasma cells. Only HA-bivalent vaccines completely protect mice against challenge with homologous influenza virus. Similar results are obtained with other antigens by targeting CD11c and Xcr1 on dendritic cells (DCs) or when administering the vaccine as protein with adjuvant. Bivalency probably increases B cell responses by cross-linking BCRs in readily observable DC-B cell synapses. These results are important for generating potent APC-targeted vaccines.

Abstract: Summary
Ewing sarcoma (EwS) is a highly aggressive tumor of bone and soft tissues that mostly affects children and adolescents. The pathognomonic oncofusion EWSR1::FLI1 transcription factor drives EwS by orchestrating an oncogenic transcription program through de novo enhancers. By integrative analysis of thousands of transcriptomes representing pan-cancer cell lines, primary cancers, metastasis, and normal tissues, we identify a 32-gene signature (ESS32 [Ewing Sarcoma Specific 32]) that stratifies EwS from pan-cancer. Among the ESS32, LOXHD1, encoding a stereociliary protein, is the most highly expressed gene through an alternative transcription start site. Deletion or silencing of EWSR1::FLI1 bound upstream de novo enhancer results in loss of the LOXHD1 short isoform, altering EWSR1::FLI1 and HIF1α pathway genes and resulting in decreased proliferation/invasion of EwS cells. These observations implicate LOXHD1 as a biomarker and a determinant of EwS metastasis and suggest new avenues for developing LOXHD1-targeted drugs or cellular therapies for this deadly disease.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription factors (TFs) consist of a DNA-binding domain and an activation domain (AD) that are frequently considered to be independent and exchangeable modules. However, recent studies report that the physicochemical properties of the AD can control TF assembly at chromatin by driving phase separation into transcriptional condensates. Here, we dissected transcription activation by comparing different synthetic TFs at a reporter gene array with real-time single-cell fluorescence microscopy. In these experiments, binding site occupancy, residence time, and coactivator recruitment in relation to multivalent TF interactions were compared. While phase separation propensity and activation strength of the AD were linked, the actual formation of liquid-like TF droplets had a neutral or inhibitory effect on transcription activation. We conclude that multivalent AD-mediated interactions enhance the transcription activation capacity of a TF by increasing its residence time in the chromatin-bound state and facilitating the recruitment of coactivators independent of phase separation.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria change their morphology in response to developmental and environmental cues. During sexual reproduction, bryophytes produce spermatozoids with two mitochondria in the cell body. Although intensive morphological analyses have been conducted, how this fixed number of mitochondria is realized remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate how mitochondria are reorganized during spermiogenesis in Marchantia polymorpha. We find that the mitochondrial number is reduced to one through fission followed by autophagic degradation during early spermiogenesis, and then the posterior mitochondrion arises by fission of the anterior mitochondrion. Autophagy is also responsible for the removal of other organelles, including peroxisomes, but these other organelles are removed at distinct developmental stages from mitochondrial degradation. We also find that spermiogenesis involves nonautophagic organelle degradation. Our findings highlight the dynamic reorganization of mitochondria, which is regulated distinctly from that of other organelles, and multiple degradation mechanisms operate in organelle remodeling during spermiogenesis in M. polymorpha.

Abstract: Infection of the stomach by Helicobacter pylori is a major risk factor for the development of gastric cancer. Colonization of the gastric epithelium leads to the activation of multiple disease-related signaling pathways. Serine protease HtrA represents an important secreted virulence factor that mediates cleavage of cellular junctions. However, its potential role in nuclear responses is unknown. Here, we performed a genome-wide RNA-seq analysis of polarized gastric epithelial cells infected by wild-type (wt) and ΔhtrA mutant bacteria. Fluorescence microscopy showed that H. pylori wt, but not ΔhtrA bacteria, preferably localized at cellular junctions. Our results pinpointed early (2 h) and late (6 h) transcriptional responses, with most differentially expressed genes at 6 h post infection. The transcriptomes revealed HtrA-dependent targeting of genes associated with inflammation and apoptosis (e.g. IL8, ZFP36, TNF). Accordingly, infection with the ΔhtrA mutant induced increased apoptosis rates in host cells, which was associated with reduced H. pylori CagA expression. In contrast, transcription of various carcinogenesis-associated genes (e.g. DKK1, DOCK8) was affected by H. pylori independent of HtrA. These findings suggest that H. pylori disturbs previously unknown molecular pathways in an HtrA-dependent and HtrA-independent manner, and provide valuable new insights of this significant pathogen in humans and thus potential targets for better controlling the risk of malignant transformation.

Abstract: Summary
Ligand binding to the EGF receptor (EGFR) triggers multiple signal-transduction processes and promotes endocytosis of the receptor. The mechanisms of EGFR endocytosis and its cross-talk with signaling are poorly understood. Here, we combine peroxidase-catalyzed proximity labeling, isobaric peptide tagging, and quantitative mass spectrometry to define the dynamics of the proximity proteome of ligand-activated EGFR. Using this approach, we identify a network of signaling proteins, which remain associated with the receptor during its internalization and trafficking through the endosomal system. We show that Trk-fused gene (TFG), a protein known to function at the endoplasmic reticulum exit sites, is enriched in the proximity proteome of EGFR in early/sorting endosomes and localized in these endosomes and demonstrate that TFG regulates endosomal sorting of EGFR. This study provides a comprehensive resource of time-dependent nanoscale environment of EGFR, thus opening avenues to discovering new regulatory mechanisms of signaling and intracellular trafficking of receptor tyrosine kinases.

Abstract: Summary
As part of the ongoing bacterial-phage arms race, CRISPR-Cas systems in bacteria clear invading phages whereas anti-CRISPR proteins (Acrs) in phages inhibit CRISPR defenses. Known Acrs have proven extremely diverse, complicating their identification. Here, we report a deep learning algorithm for Acr identification that revealed an Acr against type VI-B CRISPR-Cas systems. The algorithm predicted numerous putative Acrs spanning almost all CRISPR-Cas types and subtypes, including over 7,000 putative type IV and VI Acrs not predicted by other algorithms. By performing a cell-free screen for Acr hits against type VI-B systems, we identified a potent inhibitor of Cas13b nucleases we named AcrVIB1. AcrVIB1 blocks Cas13b-mediated defense against a targeted plasmid and lytic phage, and its inhibitory function principally occurs upstream of ribonucleoprotein complex formation. Overall, our work helps expand the known Acr universe, aiding our understanding of the bacteria-phage arms race and the use of Acrs to control CRISPR technologies.

Abstract: Summary
How immune dysregulation affects recovery from COVID-19 infection in patients with cancer remains unclear. We analyzed cellular and humoral immune responses in 103 patients with prior COVID-19 infection, more than 20% of whom had delayed viral clearance. Delayed clearance was associated with loss of antibodies to nucleocapsid and spike proteins with a compensatory increase in functional T cell responses. High-dimensional analysis of peripheral blood samples demonstrated increased CD8+ effector T cell differentiation and a broad but poorly converged COVID-specific T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire in patients with prolonged disease. Conversely, patients with a CD4+ dominant immunophenotype had a lower incidence of prolonged disease and exhibited a deep and highly select COVID-associated TCR repertoire, consistent with effective viral clearance and development of T cell memory. These results highlight the importance of B cells and CD4+ T cells in promoting durable SARS-CoV-2 clearance and the significance of coordinated cellular and humoral immunity for long-term disease control.

Abstract: Summary
Used widely for genome editing, CRISPR-Cas enzymes provide RNA-guided immunity to microbes by targeting foreign nucleic acids for cleavage. We show here that the native activity of CRISPR-Cas12c protects bacteria from phage infection by binding to DNA targets without cleaving them, revealing that antiviral interference can be accomplished without chemical attack on the invader or general metabolic disruption in the host. Biochemical experiments demonstrate that Cas12c is a site-specific ribonuclease capable of generating mature CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) from precursor transcripts. Furthermore, we find that crRNA maturation is essential for Cas12c-mediated DNA targeting. These crRNAs direct double-stranded DNA binding by Cas12c using a mechanism that precludes DNA cutting. Nevertheless, Cas12c represses transcription and can defend bacteria against lytic bacteriophage infection when targeting an essential phage gene. Together, these results show that Cas12c employs targeted DNA binding to provide antiviral immunity in bacteria, providing a native DNase-free pathway for transient antiviral immunity.

Abstract: Summary
The molecular mechanism underlying the functional interaction between H1R and TRPV1 remains unclear. We show here that H1R directly binds to the carboxy-terminal region of TRPV1 at residues 715–725 and 736–749. Cell-penetrating peptides containing these sequences suppress histamine-induced scratching behavior in a cheek injection model. The H1R-TRPV1 binding is kept at a minimum at rest in mouse trigeminal neurons due to TRPV1 SUMOylation and it is enhanced upon histamine treatment through a transient TRPV1 deSUMOylation. The knockin of the SUMOylation-deficient TRPV1K823R mutant in mice leads to constitutive enhancement of H1R-TRPV1 binding, which exacerbates scratching behaviors induced by histamine. Conversely, SENP1 conditional knockout in sensory neurons enhances TRPV1 SUMOylation and suppresses the histamine-induced scratching response. In addition to interfering with binding, TRPV1 SUMOylation promotes H1R degradation through ubiquitination. Our work unveils the molecular mechanism of histaminergic itch by which H1R directly binds to deSUMOylated TRPV1 to facilitate the transduction of the pruritogen signal to the scratching response.

Abstract: Summary
Dysfunctional sociability is a core symptom in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) that may arise from neural-network dysconnectivity between multiple brain regions. However, pathogenic neural-network mechanisms underlying social dysfunction are largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that circuit-selective mutation (ctMUT) of ASD-risk Shank3 gene within a unidirectional projection from the prefrontal cortex to the basolateral amygdala alters spine morphology and excitatory-inhibitory balance of the circuit. Shank3 ctMUT mice show reduced sociability as well as elevated neural activity and its amplitude variability, which is consistent with the neuroimaging results from human ASD patients. Moreover, the circuit hyper-activity disrupts the temporal correlation of socially tuned neurons to the events of social interactions. Finally, optogenetic circuit activation in wild-type mice partially recapitulates the reduced sociability of Shank3 ctMUT mice, while circuit inhibition in Shank3 ctMUT mice partially rescues social behavior. Collectively, these results highlight a circuit-level pathogenic mechanism of Shank3 mutation that drives social dysfunction.

Abstract: Summary
The voltage-gated ion channel activity depends on both activation (transition from the resting state to the open state) and inactivation. Inactivation is a self-restraint mechanism to limit ion conduction and is as crucial to membrane excitability as activation. Inactivation can occur when the channel is open or closed. Although open-state inactivation is well understood, the molecular basis of closed-state inactivation has remained elusive. We report cryo-EM structures of human KV4.2 channel complexes in inactivated, open, and closed states. Closed-state inactivation of KV4 involves an unprecedented symmetry breakdown for pore closure by only two of the four S4–S5 linkers, distinct from known mechanisms of open-state inactivation. We further capture KV4 in a putative resting state, revealing how voltage sensor movements control the pore. Moreover, our structures provide insights regarding channel modulation by KChIP2 and DPP6 auxiliary subunits. Our findings elucidate mechanisms of closed-state inactivation and voltage-dependent activation of the KV4 channel.

Abstract: Summary
How are actions linked with subsequent outcomes to guide choices? The nucleus accumbens, which is implicated in this process, receives glutamatergic inputs from the prelimbic cortex and midline regions of the thalamus. However, little is known about whether and how representations differ across these input pathways. By comparing these inputs during a reinforcement learning task in mice, we discovered that prelimbic cortical inputs preferentially represent actions and choices, whereas midline thalamic inputs preferentially represent cues. Choice-selective activity in the prelimbic cortical inputs is organized in sequences that persist beyond the outcome. Through computational modeling, we demonstrate that these sequences can support the neural implementation of reinforcement-learning algorithms, in both a circuit model based on synaptic plasticity and one based on neural dynamics. Finally, we test and confirm a prediction of our circuit models by direct manipulation of nucleus accumbens input neurons.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic perturbances in translational regulation result in defects in cerebellar motor learning; however, little is known about the role of translational mechanisms in the regulation of cerebellar plasticity. We show that genetic removal of 4E-BP, a translational suppressor and target of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1, results in a striking change in cerebellar synaptic plasticity. We find that cerebellar long-term depression (LTD) at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses is converted to long-term potentiation in 4E-BP knockout mice. Biochemical and pharmacological experiments suggest that increased phosphatase activity largely accounts for the defects in LTD. Our results point to a model in which translational regulation through the action of 4E-BP plays a critical role in establishing the appropriate kinase/phosphatase balance required for normal synaptic plasticity in the cerebellum.

Abstract: Summary
The changes that drive differentiation facilitate the emergence of abnormal cells that need to be removed before they contribute to further development or the germline. Consequently, in mice in the lead-up to gastrulation, ∼35% of embryonic cells are eliminated. This elimination is caused by hypersensitivity to apoptosis, but how it is regulated is poorly understood. Here, we show that upon exit of naive pluripotency, mouse embryonic stem cells lower their mitochondrial apoptotic threshold, and this increases their sensitivity to cell death. We demonstrate that this enhanced apoptotic response is induced by a decrease in mitochondrial fission due to a reduction in the activity of dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1). Furthermore, we show that in naive pluripotent cells, DRP1 prevents apoptosis by promoting mitophagy. In contrast, during differentiation, reduced mitophagy levels facilitate apoptosis. Together, these results indicate that during early mammalian development, DRP1 regulation of mitophagy determines the apoptotic response.

Abstract: Summary
Bicarbonate (HCO3−) ions maintain pH homeostasis in eukaryotic cells and serve as a carbonyl donor to support cellular metabolism. However, whether the abundance of HCO3− is regulated or harnessed to promote cell growth is unknown. The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) adjusts cellular metabolism to support biomass production and cell growth. We find that mTORC1 stimulates the intracellular transport of HCO3− to promote nucleotide synthesis through the selective translational regulation of the sodium bicarbonate cotransporter SLC4A7. Downstream of mTORC1, SLC4A7 mRNA translation required the S6K-dependent phosphorylation of the translation factor eIF4B. In mTORC1-driven cells, loss of SLC4A7 resulted in reduced cell and tumor growth and decreased flux through de novo purine and pyrimidine synthesis in human cells and tumors without altering the intracellular pH. Thus, mTORC1 signaling, through the control of SLC4A7 expression, harnesses environmental bicarbonate to promote anabolic metabolism, cell biomass, and growth.

Abstract: Summary
Morphogenesis, wound healing, and some cancer metastases depend upon the migration of cell collectives that need to be guided to their destination as well as coordinated with other cell movements. During zebrafish gastrulation, the extension of the embryonic axis is led by the mesendodermal polster that migrates toward the animal pole, followed by the axial mesoderm that undergoes convergence and extension. Here, we investigate how polster cells are guided toward the animal pole. Using a combination of precise laser ablations, advanced transplants, and functional as well as in silico approaches, we establish that each polster cell is oriented by its immediate follower cells. Each cell perceives the migration of followers, through E-cadherin/α-catenin mechanotransduction, and aligns with them. Therefore, directional information propagates from cell to cell over the whole tissue. Such guidance of migrating cells by followers ensures long-range coordination of movements and developmental robustness.

Abstract: Summary
Developing synapses mature through the recruitment of specific proteins that stabilize presynaptic and postsynaptic structure and function. Wnt ligands signaling via Frizzled (Fz) receptors play many crucial roles in neuronal and synaptic development, but whether and how Wnt and Fz influence synaptic maturation is incompletely understood. Here, we show that Fz2 receptor cleavage via the γ-secretase complex is required for postsynaptic development and maturation. In the absence of γ-secretase, Drosophila neuromuscular synapses fail to recruit postsynaptic scaffolding and cytoskeletal proteins, leading to behavioral deficits. Introducing presenilin mutations linked to familial early-onset Alzheimer’s disease into flies leads to synaptic maturation phenotypes that are identical to those seen in null alleles. This conserved role for γ-secretase in synaptic maturation and postsynaptic development highlights the importance of Fz2 cleavage and suggests that receptor processing by proteins linked to neurodegeneration may be a shared mechanism with aspects of synaptic development.

Abstract: Semaphorin 3A (Sema3a) is a chemotropic protein that acts as a neuronal guidance cue and plays a major role in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons projection during embryo development. The present study evaluated the impact of stiffness in the repulsive response of DRG neurons to Sema3a when cultured over substrates of variable stiffness. Stiffness modified DRG neurons morphology and regulated their response to Sema3a, reducing the collapse of growth cones when they were cultured on softer substrates. Sema3a receptors expression was also regulated by stiffness, neuropilin-1 was overexpressed and plexin A4 mRNA was downregulated in stiffer substrates. Cytoskeleton distribution was also modified by stiffness. In softer substrates, βIII-tubulin and actin co-localized up to the leading edge of the growth cones, and as the substrate became stiffer, βIII-tubulin was confined to the transition and peripheral domains of the growth cone. Moreover, a decrease in the α-actinin adaptor protein was also observed in softer substrates. Our results show that substrate stiffness plays an important role in regulating the collapse response to Sema3a and that the modulation of cytoskeleton distribution and Sema3a receptors expression are related to the differential collapse responses of the growth cones.

Abstract: A cardio-renal syndrome (CRS) is a medical condition in which kidney problems are accompanied by heart problems and diagnosed when acute kidney injury contributes to the development of acute cardiac injury. Regenerative medicine is becoming increasingly interested in adipose stem cells. We evaluated the effect of both adipose-derived stem cell extracellular vesicles (ADSCs-EVs) and adipose stem cells (ADSCs) on an experimental model of CRSIII. In this study, isolation, and further identification of ADSCs and ADSCs-EVs by transmission electron microscopy and flow cytometric analysis. Cardio-renal syndrome in rats was induced by renal artery ligation RAL followed by a single dose injection of both ADSCs and ADSCs-EVs in separate groups. The effects of ADSCs-EVs and ADSCs against induced CRSIII were evaluated by both renal and cardiac oxidant/antioxidant biomarkers, renal function, and mRNA gene expression quantitation for atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), p300, and myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2C and MEF2A), as well as myocardin (MYOCD), as molecules associated with cardiac hypertrophy. Additionally, histological and immunohistochemical studies of cardiac and renal tissues were done. ADSCs-EVs were effectively isolated and characterized. ADSCs-EVs and ADSCs reversed induced CRSIII, evidenced by considerably decreased serum urea and creatinine levels. Returned oxidant/antioxidant stability, and decreased caspase 3-mediated apoptotic programmed cell death in cardiac and renal tissues. Additionally, they led to successful down-regulation of hypertrophic cardiac genes levels and reversed histopathological cardiac and renal injures. ADSCs-derived extracellular vesicles and ADSCs injection restored damaged cardiac and renal tissue and improved its function greatly following induced CRSIII. They could therefore be useful as a means of protecting the heart from the deleterious effects of acute renal injury and reprogramed injured cardiac cells by activating regenerative processes.
Simple summary
Cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) type III is a subcategory of CRS whereby acute kidney injury (AKI) could contribute to the development of acute cardiac dysfunction. This study provided innovatory data regarding the role of adipose-derived stem cell extracellular vesicles ADSCs-EVs and adipose stem cells (ADSCs) in acute renal and cardiac dysfunction and renal biopsy specimens in the form of interstitial inflammation/tubular degeneration. The main cause of renal and cardiac dysfunction is identified to be the activation and accumulation of inflammatory cells and oxidants in the interstitium, surrounded by increased amounts of extracellular matrix, and ADSCs-EVs have been proposed as a contributor factor. The study has evidenced that both ADSCs-EVs and adipose stem cells display beneficial effects on renal and cardiac tissues survival in terms of the frequent occurrence of cardio-renal syndrome, ADSC-EVs treatment repaired damaged renal and cardiac tissues and recovered their function. ADSC-EVs reversed the effects of cardio-renal syndrome and reprogramed injured cells by activating regenerative processes. The clinical significance of the results presented in future studies needs to be investigated further.

Abstract: Craniofacial bone defects cause significant problems to patients with harmful consequences. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can self-renew and exhibit multilineage differentiation, which could be applied to bone regeneration. However, craniofacial bone tissue MSCs have unique properties, differing in their characteristics to MSCs derived from long bones. CDC20 promotes osteogenic differentiation in long bones; however, its role in craniofacial bone tissues remains unknown. In this study, we found that Cdc20 conditional knockout in mice triggered distinctive cranial and mandibular bone loss. Moreover, the osteogenic differentiation potential of cranial suture-derived MSCs and mandibular bone marrow-derived MSCs was impaired in Cdc20 conditional knockout mice. The conditional knockout of Cdc20 impaired osteogenesis in craniofacial bones. Our findings provide new insights into craniofacial bone regeneration and the treatments of craniofacial bone-related diseases.

Abstract: Gain-of-function mutations on STIM1 and ORAI1 genes are responsible for an increased store-operated calcium entry, and underlie the characteristic symptoms of three overlapping ultra-rare genetic disorders (i.e tubular aggregate myopathy, Stormorken syndrome, York platelet syndrome) that can be grouped as tubular aggregate myopathies. These mutations lead to a wide spectrum of defects, which usually include muscle weakness and cramps. Negative modulators of store-operated Ca2+-entry targeting wild-type STIM1 and ORAI1 have entered clinical trials for a different array of disorders, including pancreatitis, COVID-19, cancer, and autoimmune disorders and, while efficacy data is awaited, safety data indicates tolerability of this STIM1/ORAI1 mutations are amenable to pharmacological intervention. If this were so, given that there are no approved treatments or clinical trials ongoing for these rare disorders, it could be envisaged that these agents could also rehabilitate tubular aggregate myopathy patients. In the present contribution we characterized the Ca2+-entry patterns induced by eleven STIM1 and three ORAI1 mutations in heterologous systems or in patient-derived cells, i.e. fibroblasts and myotubes, and evaluated the effect of CIC-37 and CIC-39, two novel store-operated calcium entry modulators. Our data show that all STIM1 and ORAI1 gain-of-function mutations tested, with the possible exception of the R304Q STIM1 mutation, are amenable to inhibition, albeit with slightly different sensitivities, paving the way to the development of SOCE modulators in tubular aggregate myopathies.

Abstract: Summary
The emerging notion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) as a low-primed cloud without sharply demarcated gene expression programs raises the question on how cellular-fate options emerge and at which stem-like stage lineage priming is initiated. Here, we investigate single-cell chromatin accessibility of Lineage−, cKit+, and Sca1+ (LSK) HSPCs spanning the early differentiation landscape. Application of a signal-processing algorithm to detect transition points corresponding to massive alterations in accessibility of 571 transcription factor motifs reveals a population of LSK FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3)intCD9high cells that concurrently display stem-like and lineage-affiliated chromatin signatures, pointing to a simultaneous gain of both lympho-myeloid and megakaryocyte-erythroid programs. Molecularly and functionally, these cells position between stem cells and committed progenitors and display multi-lineage capacity in vitro and in vivo but lack self-renewal activity. This integrative molecular analysis resolves the heterogeneity of cells along hematopoietic differentiation and permits investigation of chromatin-mediated transition between multipotency and lineage restriction.

Abstract: Summary
Microglia are strongly implicated in the development and progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), yet their impact on pathology and lifespan remains unclear. Here we utilize a CSF1R hypomorphic mouse to generate a model of AD that genetically lacks microglia. The resulting microglial-deficient mice exhibit a profound shift from parenchymal amyloid plaques to cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), which is accompanied by numerous transcriptional changes, greatly increased brain calcification and hemorrhages, and premature lethality. Remarkably, a single injection of wild-type microglia into adult mice repopulates the microglial niche and prevents each of these pathological changes. Taken together, these results indicate the protective functions of microglia in reducing CAA, blood-brain barrier dysfunction, and brain calcification. To further understand the clinical implications of these findings, human AD tissue and iPSC-microglia were examined, providing evidence that microglia phagocytose calcium crystals, and this process is impaired by loss of the AD risk gene, TREM2.

Abstract: Summary
T cells depend on the phosphatase CD45 to initiate T cell receptor signaling. Although the critical role of CD45 in T cells is established, the mechanisms controlling function and localization in the membrane are not well understood. Moreover, the regulation of specific CD45 isoforms in T cell signaling remains unresolved. By using unbiased mass spectrometry, we identify the tetraspanin CD53 as a partner of CD45 and show that CD53 controls CD45 function and T cell activation. CD53-negative T cells (Cd53−/−) exhibit substantial proliferation defects, and Cd53−/− mice show impaired tumor rejection and reduced IFNγ-producing T cells compared with wild-type mice. Investigation into the mechanism reveals that CD53 is required for CD45RO expression and mobility. In addition, CD53 is shown to stabilize CD45 on the membrane and is required for optimal phosphatase activity and subsequent Lck activation. Together, our findings reveal CD53 as a regulator of CD45 activity required for T cell immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Elevated liver de novo lipogenesis contributes to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and can be inhibited by targeting acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). However, hypertriglyceridemia limits the use of pharmacological ACC inhibitors as a monotherapy. ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) generates acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate from citrate, but whether inhibition is effective for treating NASH is unknown. Here, we characterize a new mouse model that replicates many of the pathological and molecular drivers of NASH and find that genetically inhibiting ACLY in hepatocytes reduces liver malonyl-CoA, oxaloacetate, steatosis, and ballooning as well as blood glucose, triglycerides, and cholesterol. Pharmacological inhibition of ACLY mirrors genetic inhibition but has additional positive effects on hepatic stellate cells, liver inflammation, and fibrosis. Mendelian randomization of human variants that mimic reductions in ACLY also associate with lower circulating triglycerides and biomarkers of NASH. These data indicate that inhibiting liver ACLY may be an effective approach for treatment of NASH and dyslipidemia.

Abstract: Summary
Lysosomes are the main organelles in macrophages for killing invading bacteria. However, the precise mechanism underlying lysosomal biogenesis upon bacterial infection remains enigmatic. We demonstrate here that LPS stimulation increases IRG1-dependent itaconate production, which promotes lysosomal biogenesis by activating the transcription factor, TFEB. Mechanistically, itaconate directly alkylates human TFEB at cysteine 212 (Cys270 in mice) to induce its nuclear localization by antagonizing mTOR-mediated phosphorylation and cytosolic retention. Functionally, abrogation of itaconate synthesis by IRG1/Irg1 knockout or expression of an alkylation-deficient TFEB mutant impairs the antibacterial ability of macrophages in vitro. Furthermore, knockin mice harboring an alkylation-deficient TFEB mutant display elevated susceptibility to Salmonella typhimurium infection, whereas in vivo treatment of OI, a cell-permeable itaconate derivative, limits inflammation. Our study identifies itaconate as an endogenous metabolite that functions as a lysosomal inducer in macrophages in response to bacterial infection, implying the potential therapeutic utility of itaconate in treating human bacterial infection.

Abstract: High-throughput RNA sequencing of human Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome cells (SGBS) was performed during the time-course of adipogenic differentiation at day 4 (D04), 6 (D06), 8 (D08), and 10 (D10) to characterize transcriptomic changes and to identify key patterns involved in adipogenesis and browning. In the comparisons, 932 and 384 overlapping transcripts were consistently up- and down-regulated, respectively. Combining the results of protein-protein interaction network analysis MCODE and CytoHubba, 55 up-regulated hub genes from four clusters and 9 down-regulated genes were identified. The up-regulated hub genes were mainly enriched in brown adipocyte differentiation, extracellular matrix organization, and valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation. The enrichment of downregulated hub genes was related to NRF2 signalling and glutathione metabolism, indicating that oxidative stress also plays a role. Analysis of overlapping down-regulated genes, targets of transcription factors, revealed enrichment in the IL-18 signalling pathway, which is involved in browning process and extracellular matrix organization via actomyosin mechanics and integrin-extracellular matrix interactions. Finally, the comparison transcriptomic analysis with the gene signature reported by BATLAS and PROFAT web-based tools showed an increased percentage of the brown phenotype, confirming that differentiated SGBS cells at D06, D08, and D10 gradually acquire BAT-like function.

Abstract: Summary
Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles that originate from the intraluminal vesicles of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). We previously reported that polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells secrete two types of exosomes, apical and basolateral exosomes, from different MVBs. However, how these MVBs are selectively targeted to the apical or basolateral membrane remained unknown. Here, we analyze members of the Rab family small GTPases and show that different sets of Rabs mediate asymmetrical exosome release. Rab27, the best-known regulator of MVB transport for exosome release, is specifically but partially involved in apical exosome release, and Rab37, a close homolog of Rab27, is an additional apical exosome regulator. By contrast, Rab39 functions as a specific regulator of basolateral exosome release. Mechanistically, Rab39 interacts with its effector UACA, and UACA then recruits Lyspersin, a component of BLOC-1-related complex (BORC). Our findings suggest that the Rab39-UACA-BORC complex specifically mediates basolateral exosome release.

Abstract: Summary
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent internal modification in eukaryotic mRNAs and affects RNA processing and metabolism. When YTHDF2, an m6A-recognizing protein, binds to m6A, it facilitates the destabilization of m6A-containing RNAs (m6A RNAs). Here, we demonstrate that upstream frameshift 1 (UPF1), a key factor for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, interacts with YTHDF2, thereby triggering rapid degradation of m6A RNAs. The UPF1-mediated m6A RNA degradation depends on a specific interaction between UPF1 and N-terminal residues 101–168 of YTHDF2, UPF1 ATPase/helicase activities, and UPF1 interaction with proline-rich nuclear receptor coactivator 2 (PNRC2), a decapping-promoting factor preferentially involved in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Furthermore, transcriptome-wide analyses show that YTHDF2-bound mRNAs that are not substrates for HRSP12-RNase P/MRP-mediated endoribonucleolytic cleavage are destabilized with a higher dependency on UPF1. Collectively, our data indicate dynamic and multilayered regulation of the stability of m6A RNAs and highlight the multifaceted role of UPF1 in mRNA decay.

Abstract: Summary
Cells in natural environments, such as tissue or soil, sense and respond to extracellular ligands with intricately structured and non-monotonic spatial distributions, sculpted by processes such as fluid flow and substrate adhesion. In this work, we show that spatial sensing and navigation can be optimized by adapting the spatial organization of signaling pathways to the spatial structure of the environment. We develop an information-theoretic framework for computing the optimal spatial organization of a sensing system for a given signaling environment. We find that receptor localization previously observed in cells maximizes information acquisition in simulated natural contexts, including tissue and soil. Specifically, information acquisition is maximized when receptors form localized patches at regions of maximal ligand concentration. Receptor localization extends naturally to produce a dynamic protocol for continuously redistributing signaling receptors, which when implemented using simple feedback, boosts cell navigation efficiency by 30-fold.

Abstract: Summary
There is a need for better classification and understanding of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Here, we applied advanced functional genomics to interrogate 9,000 human tumors and multiple single-cell sequencing sets using benchmarked T cell states, comprehensive T cell differentiation trajectories, human and mouse vaccine responses, and other human TILs. Compared with other T cell states, enrichment of T memory/resident memory programs was observed across solid tumors. Trajectory analysis of single-cell melanoma CD8+ TILs also identified a high fraction of memory/resident memory-scoring TILs in anti-PD-1 responders, which expanded post therapy. In contrast, TILs scoring highly for early T cell activation, but not exhaustion, associated with non-response. Late/persistent, but not early activation signatures, prognosticate melanoma survival, and co-express with dendritic cell and IFN-γ response programs. These data identify an activation-like state associated to poor response and suggest successful memory conversion, above resuscitation of exhaustion, is an under-appreciated aspect of successful anti-tumoral immunity.

Abstract: Depending on the mineralization pattern of dentine, teeth can be divided into three histological types (orthodont, osteodont, and pseudoosteodont type). However, the development and structural characteristics of pseudoosteodentine has not been systematically investigated yet. Here, the teeth of Trichiurus lepturus were selected for revealing a maturation process during pseudoosteodentine formation and describing ultrastructural details of pseudoosteodentine architecture. Micro-computed tomography, scanning electron microscopy, hematoxylin-eosin, Masson staining and immunohistochemistry using a dentine sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) antibody were used to analyze the microstructure and the development of the dentine. Compared with Muraenesox cinereus orthodentine, the ultrastructure of pseudoosteodentine, dentine development, the localization and migration of odontoblasts during odontogenesis in T. lepturus were observed in detail. In pseudoosteodentine, orthodentine and osteodentine all contain similar tubule-like structures and tubule openings. Labeled by DSPP immunohistochemistry for secretory odontoblasts, the organic matrix of pseudoosteodentine forms in two stages: secreting matrix by orthodentine odontoblasts with inverted nuclear polarity and the formation of osteodentine by stellate odontoblasts throughout the dental papilla. Our findings increase the understanding of the odontogenesis and structure of pseudoosteodentine and might provide a new model for the study of biomineralization and tooth development.

Abstract: Leucine dehydrogenase (LDH, EC 1.4.1.9) catalyzes the reversible deamination of branched-chain L-amino acids to their corresponding keto acids using NAD+ as a cofactor. LDH generally adopts an octameric structure with D4 symmetry, generating a molecular mass of approximately 400 kDa. Here, the crystal structure of the LDH from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa-LDH) was determined at 2.5 Å resolution. Interestingly, the crystal structure shows that the enzyme exists as a dimer with C2 symmetry in a crystal lattice. The dimeric structure was also observed in solution using multiangle light scattering coupled with size-exclusion chromatography. The enzyme assay revealed that the specific activity was maximal at 60°C and pH 8.5. The kinetic parameters for three different amino acid and the cofactor (NAD+) were determined. The crystal structure represents that the subunit has more compact structure than homologs’ structure. In addition, the crystal structure along with sequence alignments indicates a set of non-conserved arginine residues which are important in stability. Subsequent mutation analysis for those residues revealed that the enzyme activity reduced to one third of the wild type. These results provide structural and biochemical insights for its future studies on its application for industrial purposes.

Abstract: Summary
Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is a chronic disease with potentially severe complications, and β-cell deficiency underlies this disease. Despite active research, no therapy to date has been able to induce β-cell regeneration in humans. Here, we discover the β-cell regenerative effects of glucagon receptor antibody (anti-GcgR). Treatment with anti-GcgR in mouse models of β-cell deficiency leads to reversal of hyperglycemia, increase in plasma insulin levels, and restoration of β-cell mass. We demonstrate that both β-cell proliferation and α- to β-cell transdifferentiation contribute to anti-GcgR-induced β-cell regeneration. Interestingly, anti-GcgR-induced α-cell hyperplasia can be uncoupled from β-cell regeneration after antibody clearance from the body. Importantly, we are able to show that anti-GcgR-induced β-cell regeneration is also observed in non-human primates. Furthermore, anti-GcgR and anti-CD3 combination therapy reverses diabetes and increases β-cell mass in a mouse model of autoimmune diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
Generation of new kidneys can be useful in various research fields, including organ transplantation. However, generating renal stroma, an important component tissue for structural support, endocrine function, and kidney development, remains difficult. Organ generation using an animal developmental niche can provide an appropriate in vivo environment for renal stroma differentiation. Here, we generate rat renal stroma with endocrine capacity by removing mouse stromal progenitor cells (SPCs) from the host developmental niche and transplanting rat SPCs. Furthermore, we develop a method to replace both nephron progenitor cells (NPCs) and SPCs, called the interspecies dual replacement of the progenitor (i-DROP) system, and successfully generate functional chimeric kidneys containing rat nephrons and stroma. This method can generate renal tissue from progenitors and reduce xenotransplant rejection. Moreover, it is a safe method, as donor cells do not stray into nontarget organs, thus accelerating research on stem cells, chimeras, and xenotransplantation.

Abstract: Summary
Sex differences are pervasive in human health and disease. One major key to sex-biased differences lies in the sex chromosomes. Although the functions of the X chromosome proteins are well appreciated, how they compare with their Y chromosome homologs remains elusive. Herein, using ensemble and single-molecule techniques, we report that the sex chromosome-encoded RNA helicases DDX3X and DDX3Y are distinct in their propensities for liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), dissolution, and translation repression. We demonstrate that the N-terminal intrinsically disordered region of DDX3Y more strongly promotes LLPS than the corresponding region of DDX3X and that the weaker ATPase activity of DDX3Y, compared with DDX3X, contributes to the slower disassembly dynamics of DDX3Y-positive condensates. Interestingly, DDX3Y-dependent LLPS represses mRNA translation and enhances aggregation of FUS more strongly than DDX3X-dependent LLPS. Our study provides a platform for future comparisons of sex chromosome-encoded protein homologs, providing insights into sex differences in RNA metabolism and human disease.

Abstract: Summary
EPH receptors (EPHRs) constitute the largest family among receptor tyrosine kinases in humans. They are mainly involved in short-range cell-cell communication events that regulate cell adhesion, migration, and boundary formation. However, the molecular mechanisms by which EPHRs control these processes are less understood. To address this, we unravel EPHR-associated complexes under native conditions using mass-spectrometry-based BioID proximity labeling. We obtain a composite proximity network from EPHA4, -B2, -B3, and -B4 that comprises 395 proteins, most of which were not previously linked to EPHRs. We examine the contribution of several BioID-identified candidates via loss-of-function in an EPHR-dependent cell-segregation assay. We find that the signaling scaffold PAR-3 is required for cell sorting and that EPHRs directly phosphorylate PAR-3. We also delineate a signaling complex involving the C-terminal SRC kinase (CSK), whose recruitment to PAR-3 is dependent on EPHR signals. Our work describes signaling networks by which EPHRs regulate cellular phenotypes.

Abstract: Summary
Stress-induced cleavage of transfer RNAs (tRNAs) into tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) occurs across organisms from yeast to humans; yet, its mechanistic underpinnings and pathological consequences remain poorly defined. Small RNA profiling revealed increased abundance of a cysteine tRNA fragment (5′-tRFCys) during breast cancer metastatic progression. 5′-tRFCys was required for efficient breast cancer metastatic lung colonization and cancer cell survival. We identified Nucleolin as the direct binding partner of 5′-tRFCys. 5′-tRFCys promoted the oligomerization of Nucleolin and its bound metabolic transcripts Mthfd1l and Pafah1b1 into a higher-order transcript stabilizing ribonucleoprotein complex, which protected these transcripts from exonucleolytic degradation. Consistent with this, Mthfd1l and Pafah1b1 mediated pro-metastatic and metabolic effects downstream of 5′-tRFCys—impacting folate, one-carbon, and phosphatidylcholine metabolism. Our findings reveal that a tRF can promote oligomerization of an RNA-binding protein into a transcript stabilizing ribonucleoprotein complex, thereby driving specific metabolic pathways underlying cancer progression.

Abstract: Summary
The ovarian-tumor-domain-containing deubiquitinases (OTUDs) block ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation and are involved in diverse signaling pathways. We discovered a rare OTUD3 c.863G>A mutation in a family with an early age of onset of diabetes. This mutation reduces the stability and catalytic activity of OTUD3. We next constructed an experiment with Otud3−/− mice and found that they developed worse obesity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance than wild-type mice when challenged with a high-fat diet (HFD). We further found that glucose and fatty acids stimulate CREB-binding-protein-dependent OTUD3 acetylation, promoting its nuclear translocation, where OTUD3 regulates various genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation by stabilizing peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARδ). Moreover, targeting PPARδ using a specific agonist can partially rescue the phenotype of HFD-fed Otud3−/− mice. We propose that OTUD3 is an important regulator of energy metabolism and that the OTUD3 c.863G>A is associated with obesity and a higher risk of diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas and other published data of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) reveals somatic alterations of the Hippo-YAP pathway in approximately 50% of HNSCC. Better strategies to target the YAP1 transcriptional complex are sought. Here, we show that FAT1, an upstream inhibitor of YAP1, is mutated either by missense or by truncating mutation in 29% of HNSCC. Comprehensive proteomic and drug-screening studies across pan-cancer models confirm that FAT1-mutant HNSCC exhibits selective and higher sensitivity to BRD4 inhibition by JQ1. Epigenomic analysis reveals an active chromatin state in FAT1-mutant HNSCC cells that is driven by the YAP/TAZ transcriptional complex through recruitment of BRD4 to deposit active histone marks, thereby maintaining an oncogenic transcriptional state. This study reveals a detailed cooperative mechanism between YAP1 and BRD4 in HNSCC and suggests a specific therapeutic opportunity for the treatment of this subset of head and neck cancer patients.

Abstract: Summary
β2 integrins are leukocyte-specific adhesion molecules that are essential for leukocyte recruitment. The lack of tools for reporting β2 integrin activation in mice hindered the study of β2 integrin-related immune responses in vivo. Here, we generated a humanized β2 integrin knockin mouse strain by targeting the human β2 integrin coding sequence into the mouse Itgb2 locus to enable imaging of β2 integrin activation using the KIM127 (extension) and mAb24 (high-affinity) reporter antibodies. Using a CXCL1-induced acute inflammation model, we show the local dynamics of β2 integrin activation in arresting neutrophils in vivo in venules of the mouse cremaster muscle. Activated integrins are highly concentrated in a small area at the rear of arresting neutrophils in vivo. In a high-dose lipopolysaccharide model, we find that β2 integrins are activated in association with elevated neutrophil adhesion in lung and liver. Thus, these mice enable studies of β2 integrin activation in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
B1 B cells reactive to phosphatidyl choline (PtC) exhibit restricted immunoglobulin heavy chain (HC) and light chain (LC) combinations, exemplified by VH12/Vκ4/5H. Two checkpoints are thought to focus PtC+ B cell maturation in VH12-transgenic mice (VH12 mice): V-J rearrangements encoding a “permissive” LC capable of VH12 HC pairing are selected first, followed by positive selection based on PtC binding, often requiring LC receptor editing to salvage PtC− B cells and acquire PtC reactivity. However, evidence obtained from breeding VH12 mice to editing-defective dnRAG1 mice and analyzing LC sequences from PtC+ and PtC− B cell subsets instead suggests that receptor editing functions after initial positive selection to remove PtC+ B cells in VH12 mice. This offers a mechanism to constrain natural, polyreactive B cells to limit their frequency. Sequencing also reveals occasional in-frame hybrid LC genes, reminiscent of type 2 gene replacement, that, testing suggests, arise via a recombination-activating gene (RAG)-independent mechanism.

Abstract: COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus-2) continues to pose an international public health threat and thus far, has resulted in greater than 6.4 million deaths worldwide. Vaccines are critical tools to limit COVID-19 spread, but antiviral drug development is an ongoing global priority due to fast-spreading COVID-19 variants that may elude vaccine efficacies. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 is an essential enzyme of viral replication and transcription machinery complex. Therefore, the RdRp is an attractive target for the development of effective anti-COVID-19 therapeutics. In this study, we developed a cell-based assay to determine the enzymatic activity of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp through a luciferase reporter system. The SARS-CoV-2 RdRp reporter assay was validated using known inhibitors of RdRp polymerase, remdesivir along with other anti-virals including ribavirin, penciclovir, rhoifolin, 5′CT, and dasabuvir. Dasabuvir (an FDA-approved drug) exhibited promising RdRp inhibitory activity among these inhibitors. Anti-viral activity of dasabuvir was also tested on the replication of SARS-CoV-2 through infection of Vero E6 cells. Dasabuvir inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV-2, USA-WA1/2020 as well as B.1.617.2 (delta variant) in Vero E6 cells in a dose-dependent manner with EC50 values 9.47 μM and 10.48 μM, for USA-WA1/2020 and B.1.617.2 variants, respectively. Our results suggest that dasabuvir can be further evaluated as a therapeutic drug for COVID-19. Importantly, this system provides a robust, target-specific, and high-throughput screening compatible (z- and z’-factors of >0.5) platforms that will be a valuable tool for screening SARS-CoV-2 RdRp inhibitors.

Abstract: Summary
PARP1 rapidly detects DNA strand break damage and allosterically signals break detection to the PARP1 catalytic domain to activate poly(ADP-ribose) production from NAD+. PARP1 activation is characterized by dynamic changes in the structure of a regulatory helical domain (HD); yet, there are limited insights into the specific contributions that the HD makes to PARP1 allostery. Here, we have determined crystal structures of PARP1 in isolated active states that display specific HD conformations. These captured snapshots and biochemical analysis illustrate HD contributions to PARP1 multi-domain and high-affinity interaction with DNA damage, provide novel insights into the mechanics of PARP1 allostery, and indicate how HD active conformations correspond to alterations in the catalytic region that reveal the active site to NAD+. Our work deepens the understanding of PARP1 catalytic activation, the dynamics of the binding site of PARP inhibitor compounds, and the mechanisms regulating PARP1 retention on DNA damage.

Abstract: Summary
Ligand-receptor interactions guide axon navigation and dendrite arborization. Mechanical forces also influence guidance choices. However, the nature of such mechanical stimulations, the mechanosensor identity, and how they interact with guidance receptors are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that mechanosensitive DEG/ENaC channels are required for dendritic arbor morphogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans. Inhibition of DEG/ENaC channels causes reduced dendritic outgrowth and branching in vivo, a phenotype that is alleviated by overexpression of the mechanosensitive channels PEZO-1/Piezo or YVC1/TrpY1. DEG/ENaCs trigger local Ca2+ transients in growing dendritic filopodia via activation of L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Anchoring of filopodia by dendrite ligand-receptor complexes is required for the mechanical activation of DEG/ENaC channels. Therefore, mechanosensitive channels serve as a checkpoint for appropriate chemoaffinity by activating Ca2+ transients required for neurite growth.

Abstract: Summary
Cerebral organoids have emerged as robust models for neurodevelopmental and pathological processes, as well as a powerful discovery platform for less-characterized neurobiological programs. Toward this prospect, we leverage mass-spectrometry-based proteomics to molecularly profile precursor and neuronal compartments of both human-derived organoids and mid-gestation fetal brain tissue to define overlapping programs. Our analysis includes recovery of precursor-enriched transcriptional regulatory proteins not found to be differentially expressed in previous transcriptomic datasets. To highlight the discovery potential of this resource, we show that RUVBL2 is preferentially expressed in the SOX2-positive compartment of organoids and that chemical inactivation leads to precursor cell displacement and apoptosis. To explore clinicopathological correlates of this cytoarchitectural disruption, we interrogate clinical datasets and identify rare de novo genetic variants involving RUVBL2 in patients with neurodevelopmental impairments. Together, our findings demonstrate how cell-type-specific profiling of organoids can help nominate previously unappreciated genes in neurodevelopment and disease.

Abstract: Suppressor of mothers against decapentaplegic homolog (SMAD) 4 is a pluripotent signaling mediator that regulates myriad cellular functions, including cell growth, cell division, angiogenesis, apoptosis, cell invasion, and metastasis, through transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)-dependent and -independent pathways. SMAD4 is a critical modulator in signal transduction and functions primarily as a transcription factor or cofactor. Apart from being a DNA-binding factor, the additional SMAD4 mechanisms in tumor suppression remain elusive. We previously identified methyl malonyl aciduria cobalamin deficiency B type (MMAB) as a critical SMAD4 binding protein using a proto array analysis. This study confirmed the interaction between SMAD4 and MMAB using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay, proximity ligation assay (PLA), and conventional immunoprecipitation. We found that transient SMAD4 overexpression down-regulates MMAB expression via a proteasome-dependent pathway. SMAD4-MMAB interaction was independent of TGF-β signaling. Finally, we determined the effect of MMAB downregulation on cancer cells. siRNA-mediated knockdown of MMAB affected cancer cell metabolism in HeLa cells by decreasing ATP production and glucose consumption as well as inducing apoptosis. These findings suggest that SMAD4 controls cancer cell metabolism by regulating MMAB.

Abstract: Multiple diseases, such as cancer and neural degeneration diseases, are related with the latent infection of DNA viruses. However, it is still difficult to clean up the latent DNA viruses and new anti-viral strategies are critical for disease treatment. Here, we screen a pool of small chemical molecules and identify UNC0379, an inhibitor for histone H4K20 methyltransferase SETD8, as an effective inhibitor for multiple DNA viruses. UNC0379 not only enhances the expression of anti-viral genes in THP-1 cells, but also repress DNA virus replication in multiple cell lines with defects in cGAS pathway. We prove that SETD8 promotes DNA virus replication in a manner dependent on its enzyme activity. Our results further indicated that SETD8 is required for PCNA stability, one factor critical for viral DNA replication. Viral infection stimulates the interaction between SETD8 and PCNA and thus enhances PCNA stability and viral DNA replication. Taken together, our study reveals a new mechanism for regulating viral DNA replication and provides a potential strategy for treatment of diseases related with DNA viruses.

Abstract: Summary
HIV-1 envelope (Env) proteins designed to induce neutralizing antibody responses allow study of the role of affinities (equilibrium dissociation constant [KD]) and kinetic rates (association/dissociation rates) on B cell antigen recognition. It is unclear whether affinity discrimination during B cell activation is based solely on Env protein binding KD and whether B cells discriminate among proteins of similar affinities that bind with different kinetic rates. Here, we use a panel of Env proteins and Ramos B cell lines expressing immunoglobulin M (IgM) B cell receptors (BCRs) with specificity for CD4-binding-site broadly neutralizing antibodies to study the role of antigen binding kinetic rates on both early (proximal/distal signaling) and late events (BCR/antigen internalization) in B cell activation. Our results support a kinetic model for B cell activation in which Env protein affinity discrimination is based not on overall KD but on sensing of association rate and a threshold antigen-BCR half-life.

Abstract: Summary
Adaptive behavior critically depends on the detection of behaviorally relevant stimuli. The anterior insular cortex (aIC) has long been proposed as a key player in the representation and integration of sensory stimuli, and implicated in a wide variety of cognitive and emotional functions. However, to date, little is known about the contribution of aIC interneurons to sensory processing. By using a combination of whole-brain connectivity tracing, imaging of neural calcium dynamics, and optogenetic modulation in freely moving mice across different experimental paradigms, such as fear conditioning and social preference, we describe here a role for aIC vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-expressing (VIP+) interneurons in mediating adaptive behaviors. Our findings enlighten the contribution of aIC VIP+ interneurons to sensory processing, showing that they are anatomically connected to a wide range of sensory-related brain areas and critically respond to behaviorally relevant stimuli independent of task and modality.

Abstract: Summary
The neocortex expands explosively during embryonic development. The earliest populations of neural stem cells (NSCs) form a thin pseudostratified epithelium whose contour determines that of the adult neocortex. Neocortical complexity is accompanied by disproportional expansion of the NSC layer in its tangential dimension to increase tissue surface area. How such disproportional expansion is controlled remains unknown. We demonstrate that a phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (PITP)/non-canonical Wnt planar cell polarity (ncPCP) signaling axis promotes tangential expansion of developing neocortex. PITP signaling supports trafficking of specific ncPCP receptors from the NSC Golgi system to potentiate actomyosin activity important for cell-cycle-dependent interkinetic nuclear migration (IKNM). In turn, IKNM promotes lateral dispersion of newborn NSCs and tangential growth of the cerebral wall. These findings clarify functional roles for IKNM in NSC biology and identify tissue dysmorphogenesis resulting from impaired IKNM as a factor in autism risk, developmental brain disabilities, and neural tube birth defects.

Abstract: Summary
Tissue damage leads to loss of cellular and mitochondrial membrane integrity and release of damage-associated molecular patterns, including those of mitochondrial origin (mitoDAMPs). Here, we describe the lymphocyte response to mitoDAMPs. Using primary cells from mice and human donors, we demonstrate that natural killer (NK) cells and T cells adopt regulatory phenotypes and functions in response to mitoDAMPs. NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production, T cell proliferation, and in vivo anti-viral T cell activation are all interrupted in the presence of mitoDAMPs or mitoDAMP-rich irradiated cells in in vitro and in vivo assays. Mass spectrometry analysis of mitoDAMPs demonstrates that arginase and products of its enzymatic activity are prevalent in mitoDAMP preparations. Functional validation by arginase inhibition and/or arginine add-back shows that arginine depletion is responsible for the alteration in immunologic polarity. We conclude that lymphocyte responses to mitoDAMPs reflect a highly conserved mechanism that regulates inflammation in response to tissue injury.

Abstract: Summary
Endothelial and erythropoietic lineages arise from a common developmental progenitor. Etv2 is a master transcriptional regulator required for the development of both lineages. However, the mechanisms through which Etv2 initiates the gene-regulatory networks (GRNs) for endothelial and erythropoietic specification and how the two GRNs diverge downstream of Etv2 remain incompletely understood. Here, by analyzing a hypomorphic Etv2 mutant, we demonstrate different threshold requirements for initiation of the downstream GRNs for endothelial and erythropoietic development. We show that Etv2 functions directly in a coherent feedforward transcriptional network for vascular endothelial development, and a low level of Etv2 expression is sufficient to induce and sustain the endothelial GRN. In contrast, Etv2 induces the erythropoietic GRN indirectly via activation of Tal1, which requires a significantly higher threshold of Etv2 to initiate and sustain erythropoietic development. These results provide important mechanistic insight into the divergence of the endothelial and erythropoietic lineages.

Abstract: Summary
The suppressive function of regulatory T (Treg) cells is tightly controlled by nutrient-fueled mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activation, yet its dynamics and negative regulation remain unclear. Here we show that Treg-specific depletion of vacuolar protein sorting 33B (Vps33B) in mice results in defective Treg cell suppressive function and acquisition of effector phenotype, which in turn leads to disturbed T cell homeostasis and boosted antitumor immunity. Mechanistically, Vps33B binds with lysosomal nutrient-sensing complex (LYNUS) and promotes late endosome and lysosome fusion and clearance of the LYNUS-containing late endosome/lysosome, and therefore suppresses mTORC1 activation. Vps33B deficiency in Treg cells results in disordered endosome lysosome fusion, which leads to accumulation of LYNUS that causes elevated mTORC1 activation and hyper-glycolytic metabolism. Taken together, our study reveals that Vps33B maintains Treg cell suppressive function through sustaining endolysosomal homeostasis and therefore restricting amino acid-licensed mTORC1 activation and metabolism.

Abstract: Copper (Cu) ions have been found to exert antibacterial and angiogenic effects. However, some studies have indicated that it inhibits osteogenesis at high concentrations. On the other hand, L-arginine (Arg) is a semi-essential amino acid required for various biological processes, including osteogenic and angiogenic activities. As a result, we hypothesized that combining Arg with Cu ions would reduce its inhibitory effects on osteogenesis while increasing its angiogenic and antibacterial capabilities. To assess osteogenic and angiogenic activities, we employed rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), respectively. The gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and the gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli) were used to investigate bacterial behaviors. According to ALP activity and calcium deposition outcomes, copper ions inhibited osteogenic development of MSCs at 100 µM; however, Arg supplementation somewhat mitigated the inhibitory effects. Furthermore, Copper and Arg synergistically stimulated migration and tube formation of HUVECs. According to our findings, copper ions and Arg in the range of 1–100 µM had no antibacterial effect on any examined bacteria. However, at a dose of 20 mM, copper demonstrated antibacterial activity, which was boosted by Arg. Overall, these findings suggest that a combination of copper and Arg may be more beneficial for bone regeneration than either copper or Arg alone.

Abstract: Summary
Hypusine is a post-translational modification on eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A). The last step of hypusine biosynthesis, deoxyhypusine hydroxylation, is an oxygen-dependent reaction. Here we show that deletion of the deoxyhypusine hydroxylase Lia1 compromises yeast respiration through translation downregulation of selected proteins in the respiration pathway. The translation suppression, because of the lack of deoxyhypusine hydroxylation, mainly affects translation of the N termini of the proteins, independent of the presence of proline residues but likely dependent on the interaction between the N-terminal nascent peptide and the ribosomal peptide exit tunnel. Proteomics and biochemical studies reveal that Lia1 deletion decreases N-terminal translation of proteins involved in mitochondrial respiration, oxidative stress response, and protein folding. Our work uncovers functions of the hypusine modification by considering the substrate requirement of the post-translational modification, highlights the unique challenges of translating the N termini of proteins, and reveals an oxygen-sensing mechanism in eukaryotic cells.

Abstract: Summary
Adult muscle stem cells, also known as satellite cells (SCs), play pivotal roles in muscle regeneration, and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) functions in SCs remain largely unknown. Here, we identify a lncRNA, Lockd, which is induced in activated SCs upon acute muscle injury. We demonstrate that Lockd promotes SC proliferation; deletion of Lockd leads to cell-cycle arrest, and in vivo repression of Lockd in mouse muscles hinders regeneration process. Mechanistically, we show that Lockd directly interacts with RNA helicase DHX36 and the 5′end of Lockd possesses the strongest binding with DHX36. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Lockd stabilizes the interaction between DHX36 and EIF3B proteins; synergistically, this complex unwinds the RNA G-quadruplex (rG4) structure formed at Anp32e mRNA 5′ UTR and promotes the translation of ANP32E protein, which is required for myoblast proliferation. Altogether, our findings identify a regulatory Lockd/DHX36/Anp32e axis that promotes myoblast proliferation and acute-injury-induced muscle regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered the first widespread vaccination campaign against a coronavirus. Many vaccinated subjects are previously naive to SARS-CoV-2; however, almost all have previously encountered other coronaviruses (CoVs), and the role of this immunity in shaping the vaccine response remains uncharacterized. Here, we use longitudinal samples and highly multiplexed serology to identify mRNA-1273 vaccine-induced antibody responses against a range of CoV Spike epitopes, in both phylogenetically conserved and non-conserved regions. Whereas reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 epitopes shows a delayed but progressive increase following vaccination, we observe distinct kinetics for the endemic CoV homologs at conserved sites in Spike S2: these become detectable sooner and decay at later time points. Using homolog-specific antibody depletion and alanine-substitution experiments, we show that these distinct trajectories reflect an evolving cross-reactive response that can distinguish rare, polymorphic residues within these epitopes. Our results reveal mechanisms for the formation of antibodies with broad reactivity against CoVs.

Abstract: Summary
Drosophila Toll-1 and all mammalian Toll-like receptors regulate innate immunity. However, the functions of the remaining eight Toll-related proteins in Drosophila are not fully understood. Here, we show that Drosophila Toll-9 is necessary and sufficient for a special form of compensatory proliferation after apoptotic cell loss (undead apoptosis-induced proliferation [AiP]). Mechanistically, for AiP, Toll-9 interacts with Toll-1 to activate the intracellular Toll-1 pathway for nuclear translocation of the NF-κB-like transcription factor Dorsal, which induces expression of the pro-apoptotic genes reaper and hid. This activity contributes to the feedback amplification loop that operates in undead cells. Given that Toll-9 also functions in loser cells during cell competition, we define a general role of Toll-9 in cellular stress situations leading to the expression of pro-apoptotic genes that trigger apoptosis and apoptosis-induced processes such as AiP. This work identifies conceptual similarities between cell competition and AiP.

Abstract: Summary
Retinoic acid-inducible-I (RIG-I), melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), and cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) genes encode essential cytosolic receptors mediating antiviral immunity against viruses. Here, we show that OTUD3 has opposing role in response to RNA and DNA virus infection by removing distinct types of RIG-I/MDA5 and cGAS polyubiquitination. OTUD3 binds to RIG-I and MDA5 and removes K63-linked ubiquitination. This serves to reduce the binding of RIG-I and MDA5 to viral RNA and the downstream adaptor MAVS, leading to the suppression of the RNA virus-triggered innate antiviral responses. Meanwhile, OTUD3 associates with cGAS and targets at Lys279 to deubiquitinate K48-linked ubiquitination, resulting in the enhancement of cGAS protein stability and DNA-binding ability. As a result, Otud3-deficient mice and zebrafish are more resistant to RNA virus infection but are more susceptible to DNA virus infection. These findings demonstrate that OTUD3 limits RNA virus-triggered innate immunity but promotes DNA virus-triggered innate immunity.

Abstract: Summary
To better understand the functions of non-coding enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), we annotated the estrogen-regulated eRNA transcriptome in estrogen receptor α (ERα)-positive breast cancer cells using PRO-cap and RNA sequencing. We then cloned a subset of the eRNAs identified, fused them to single guide RNAs, and targeted them to their ERα enhancers of origin using CRISPR/dCas9. Some of the eRNAs tested modulated the expression of cognate, but not heterologous, target genes after estrogen treatment by increasing ERα recruitment and stimulating p300-catalyzed H3K27 acetylation at the enhancer. We identified a ∼40 nucleotide functional eRNA regulatory motif (FERM) present in many eRNAs that was necessary and sufficient to modulate gene expression, but not the specificity of activation, after estrogen treatment. The FERM interacted with BCAS2, an RNA-binding protein amplified in breast cancers. The ectopic expression of a targeted eRNA controlling the expression of an oncogene resulted in increased cell proliferation, demonstrating the regulatory potential of eRNAs in breast cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Overcoming resistance to chemotherapies remains a major unmet need for cancers, such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Therefore, mechanistic studies to provide insight for drug development are urgently needed to overcome TNBC therapy resistance. Recently, an important role of fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) in chemoresistance has been shown. But how FAO might mitigate tumor cell apoptosis by chemotherapy is unclear. Here, we show that elevated FAO activates STAT3 by acetylation via elevated acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA). Acetylated STAT3 upregulates expression of long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 4 (ACSL4), resulting in increased phospholipid synthesis. Elevating phospholipids in mitochondrial membranes leads to heightened mitochondrial integrity, which in turn overcomes chemotherapy-induced tumor cell apoptosis. Conversely, in both cultured tumor cells and xenograft tumors, enhanced cancer cell apoptosis by inhibiting ASCL4 or specifically targeting acetylated-STAT3 is associated with a reduction in phospholipids within mitochondrial membranes. This study demonstrates a critical mechanism underlying tumor cell chemoresistance.

Abstract: Summary
The habenula plays a key role in various motivated and pathological behaviors and is composed of molecularly distinct neuron subtypes. Despite progress in identifying mature habenula neuron subtypes, how these subtypes develop and organize into functional brain circuits remains largely unknown. Here, we performed single-cell transcriptional profiling of mouse habenular neurons at critical developmental stages, instructed by detailed three-dimensional anatomical data. Our data reveal cellular and molecular trajectories during embryonic and postnatal development, leading to different habenular subtypes. Further, based on this analysis, our work establishes the distinctive functional properties and projection target of a subtype of Cartpt+ habenula neurons. Finally, we show how comparison of single-cell transcriptional profiles and GWAS data links specific developing habenular subtypes to psychiatric disease. Together, our study begins to dissect the mechanisms underlying habenula neuron subtype-specific development and creates a framework for further interrogation of habenular development in normal and disease states.

Abstract: Summary
Mesenchymal progenitors of the lateral plate mesoderm give rise to various cell fates within limbs, including a heterogeneous group of muscle-resident mesenchymal cells. Often described as fibro-adipogenic progenitors, these cells are key players in muscle development, disease, and regeneration. To further define this cell population(s), we perform lineage/reporter analysis, flow cytometry, single-cell RNA sequencing, immunofluorescent staining, and differentiation assays on normal and injured murine muscles. Here we identify six distinct Pdgfra+ non-myogenic muscle-resident mesenchymal cell populations that fit within a bipartite differentiation trajectory from a common progenitor. One branch of the trajectory gives rise to two populations of immune-responsive mesenchymal cells with strong adipogenic potential and the capability to respond to acute and chronic muscle injury, whereas the alternative branch contains two cell populations with limited adipogenic capacity and inherent mineralizing capabilities; one of the populations displays a unique neuromuscular junction association and an ability to respond to nerve injury.

Abstract: Summary
The proper function of the genome relies on spatial organization of DNA, RNA, and proteins, but how transcription contributes to the organization is unclear. Here, we show that condensates induced by transcription inhibition (CITIs) drastically alter genome spatial organization. CITIs are formed by SFPQ, NONO, FUS, and TAF15 in nucleoli upon inhibition of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Mechanistically, RNAPII inhibition perturbs ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing, releases rRNA-processing factors from nucleoli, and enables SFPQ to bind rRNA. While accumulating in CITIs, SFPQ/TAF15 remain associated with active genes and tether active chromatin to nucleoli. In the presence of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), the altered chromatin compartmentalization induced by RNAPII inhibition increases gene fusions in CITIs and stimulates the formation of fusion oncogenes. Thus, proper RNAPII transcription and rRNA processing prevent the altered compartmentalization of active chromatin in CITIs, suppressing the generation of gene fusions from DSBs.

Abstract: Despite progress in diagnosis and treatment of esophageal cancer (EC), it is still considered as a serious malignancy with very poor prognosis. Urolithins are colonic microbiota metabolites with a wide range of pharmacological properties including chemopreventive, anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities. In this study, we hypothesized that urolithins might possess the potential to improve the efficacy of chemical drugs, ionizing radiation (IR) and/or hyperthermia on EC cells. After synthesis of urolithin A (UA), methylurolithin A (mUA) and urolithin B (UB), KYSE30 esophageal cancer cells were treated with urolithins + paclitaxel (PTX), + cisplatin (DDP), + different doses of IR or + heat-shock. Viability of cells was then determined by alamarBlue assay. To further elucidate the effects of UA, we used flow cytometry for investigation of induced apoptosis, and qRT-PCR for evaluating changes in the expression of HSP27, CCND1 and BCL2. Assessment of cell viability demonstrated that mUA increased the toxicity of PTX and DDP (up to 22.4 % and 20 %, respectively) and improved the effects of 6 Gy IR (26.5 %). Our main results achieved after UA treatment were improved toxicity of PTX and 6 Gy IR, beside enhanced effects of hyperthermia (37.3 %), which was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis and downregulation of HSP27, CCND1 and BCL2 expression. Taken together, our findings suggest that UA and mUA could be used as promising agents in combination with therapeutic modalities to improve the clinical outcomes of EC treatment.

Abstract: Summary
We investigated whether ancestry-specific genetic factors affect tuberculosis (TB) progression risk in a cohort of admixed Peruvians. We genotyped 2,105 patients with TB and 1,320 household contacts (HHCs) who were infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) but did not develop TB and inferred each individual’s proportion of native Peruvian genetic ancestry. Our HHC study design and our data on potential confounders allowed us to demonstrate increased risk independent of socioeconomic factors. A 10% increase in individual-level native Peruvian genetic ancestry proportion corresponded to a 25% increased TB progression risk. This corresponds to a 3-fold increased risk for individuals in the highest decile of native Peruvian genetic ancestry versus the lowest decile, making native Peruvian genetic ancestry comparable in effect to clinical factors such as diabetes. Our results suggest that genetic ancestry is a major contributor to TB progression risk and highlight the value of including diverse populations in host genetic studies.

Abstract: Summary
Upon binding double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is activated and initiates the cGAS-stimulator of IFN genes (STING)-type I interferon pathway. DEAD-box helicase 41 (DDX41) is a DEAD-box helicase, and mutations in DDX41 cause myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we show that DDX41-knockout (KO) cells have reduced type I interferon production after DNA virus infection. Unexpectedly, activations of cGAS and STING are affected in DDX41 KO cells, suggesting that DDX41 functions upstream of cGAS. The recombinant DDX41 protein exhibits ATP-dependent DNA-unwinding activity and ATP-independent strand-annealing activity. The MDS/AML-derived mutant R525H has reduced unwinding activity but retains normal strand-annealing activity and stimulates greater cGAS dinucleotide-synthesis activity than wild-type DDX41. Overexpression of R525H in either DDX41-deficient or -proficient cells results in higher type I interferon production. Our results have led to the hypothesis that DDX41 utilizes its unwinding and annealing activities to regulate the homeostasis of dsDNA and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), which, in turn, regulates cGAS-STING activation.

Abstract: Visualizing RNA dynamics is important for understanding RNA function. Catalytically dead (d) CRISPR-Cas13 systems have been established to image and track RNAs in living cells, but efficient dCas13 for RNA imaging is still limited. Here, we analyzed metagenomic and bacterial genomic databases to comprehensively screen Cas13 homologies for their RNA labeling capabilities in living mammalian cells. Among eight previously unreported dCas13 proteins that can be used for RNA labeling, dHgm4Cas13b and dMisCas13b displayed comparable, if not higher, efficiencies to the best-known ones when targeting endogenous MUC4 and NEAT1_2 by single guide (g) RNAs. Further examination of the labeling robustness of different dCas13 systems using the GCN4 repeats revealed that a minimum of 12 GCN4 repeats was required for dHgm4Cas13b and dMisCas13b imaging at the single RNA molecule level, while >24 GCN4 repeats were required for reported dLwaCas13a, dRfxCas13d and dPguCas13b. Importantly, by silencing pre-crRNA processing activity of dMisCas13b (ddMisCas13b) and further incorporating RNA aptamers including PP7, MS2, Pepper or BoxB to individual gRNAs, a CRISPRpalette system was developed to successfully achieve multi-color RNA visualization in living cells.

Abstract: Aim
In digestive system, colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignant tumor. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase-B/mammalian target of the rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) signaling pathway plays a central role in CRC, and the aberrant activation of this pathway is associated with tumorigenesis. We aimed to explore the role of Rho GTPase activating protein 9 (ARHGAP9) in the progression of CRC as well as its regulatory effects on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.
Methods
The expression of ARHGAP9 in CRC tumor tissues and cell lines were detected using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay was applied to test the cell proliferation. Cell migration and invasion were both assessed through transwell assay. Xenograft mouse models were constructed to explore the effects of ARHGAP9 on CRC in vivo. The expressions of PI3K/AKT/mTOR-activating factors and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related factors were all determined using western blot. LY294002 was employed to block PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in CRC cells.
Results
The expression of ARHGAP9 was down-regulated in CRC tumor tissues and cell lines when compared to normal tissues and cells. The over-expression of ARHGAP9 inhibited cell proliferation, invasion, migration and EMT in CRC cell lines while the knockdown of ARHGAP9 promoted them. In addition, ARHGAP9 up-regulation inhibited the activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in CRC cell lines while ARHGAP9 down-regulation led to an opposite effect. The over-expression of ARHGAP9 suppressed CRC tumor growth in vivo. When the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway was blocked in CRC cells, the effects of ARHGAP9 knockdown on cell proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT were all overturned.
Conclusion
ARHGAP9 inhibited the malignant phenotypes of CRC cells via interdicting PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) confronts a challenge to accommodate long, smooth ER tubules into the structural complexity of the axonal compartment. Here, we describe a morphological feature for the axonal ER network in developing neurons we termed the ER ladder. Axonal ER ladders are composed of rungs that wrap tightly around the microtubule bundle and dynamic rails, which slide across microtubules. We found that the ER-shaping protein Reticulon 2 determines the architecture and dynamics of the axonal ER ladder by modulating its interaction with microtubules. Moreover, we show that ER ladder depletion impairs the trafficking of associated vesicular axonal cargoes. Finally, we demonstrate that stromal interaction molecule 1 (Stim1) localizes to ER rungs and translocates to ER-plasma membrane contact sites upon depletion of luminal Ca2+. Our findings uncover fundamental insights into the structural and functional organization of the axonal ER network in developing mammalian neurons.
