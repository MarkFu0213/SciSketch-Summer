Abstract: The “stem cell” has become arguably one of the most important biological tools in the arsenal of translational research directed at regeneration and repair. It remains to be seen whether every tissue has its own stem cell niche, although relatively recently a large amount of research has focused on isolating and characterizing tissue-specific stem cell populations, as well as those that are able to be directed to transdifferentiate into a variety of different lineages. Traditionally, stem cells are isolated from the viable tissue of embryonic, fetal, or adult living hosts; from “fresh” donated tissues that have been surgically or otherwise removed (biopsies), or obtained directly from tissues within minutes to several hours post mortem (PM). These human progenitor/stem cell sources remain potentially highly controversial, since they are accompanied by various still-unresolved ethical, social, moral and legal challenges. Due to the limited number of “live” donors, the small amount of material obtained from biopsies and difficulties during purification processes, harvesting from cadaveric material presents itself as an alternative strategy that could provide a hitherto untapped source of stem cells. However, PM stem cells are not without their own unique set of limitations including difficulty of obtaining samples, limited supply of material, variations in delay between death and sample collection, possible lack of medication history and suboptimal retrospective assignment of diagnostic and demographic data. This article is part of a Directed Issue entitled: Regenerative Medicine: The challenge of translation.

Abstract: The mouse and human brain express a large number of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). Some of these are known to participate in neural progenitor cell fate determination, cell differentiation, neuronal and synaptic plasticity and transposable elements derived ncRNAs contribute to somatic variation. Dysregulation of specific long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) has been shown in neuro-developmental and neuro-degenerative diseases thus highlighting the importance of lncRNAs in brain function. Even though it is known that lncRNAs are expressed in cells at low levels in a tissue-specific manner, bioinformatics analyses of brain-specific ncRNAs has not been performed. We analyzed previously published custom microarray ncRNA expression data generated from twelve human tissues to identify tissue-specific ncRNAs. We find that among the 12 tissues studied, brain has the largest number of ncRNAs. Our analyses show that genes in the vicinity of brain-specific ncRNAs are significantly up regulated in the brain. Investigations of repeat representation show that brain-specific ncRNAs are significantly more likely to originate in repeat regions especially DNA/TcMar-Tigger compared with non-tissue-specific ncRNAs. We find SINE/Alus depleted from brain-specific dataset when compared with non-tissue-specific ncRNAs. Our data provide a bioinformatics comparison between brain-specific and non tissue-specific ncRNAs. This article is part of a Directed Issue entitled: The Non-coding RNA Revolution.

Abstract: Impairment in the microRNA (miRNA) network causes a number of neurodegenerative diseases. Endoribonuclease Dicer is a key RNase to produce mature miRNAs. It has been shown that Dicer is important for the maintenance of excitatory neuron survival during early postnatal period. However, the role of Dicer in adult mature excitatory neuron survival is not clear. In this study, we generated a mouse model in which Dicer is conditionally inactivated in forebrain excitatory neurons from a mature stage, and this line is termed Dicer conditional knockout (cKO). Significant age-dependent neurodegeneration was observed in the cortex of Dicer cKO mice, indicating an important role of Dicer in the maintenance of mature excitatory neuron survival in the adult cortex. Impairment in adult neurogenesis was found in 6-month but not in young Dicer cKO mice. However, astrocytosis was detected in young Dicer cKO mice displaying no apparent neuron loss. Overall, neurogenesis impairment and neuroinflammation may play pivotal roles in the progression of neurodegeneration.

Abstract: The reliable and homogenous addition of Na to the Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cell absorber represents one major challenge for the industrial implementation of the CIGS technology faces. In this study, an alternative Na source from a Na-doped Mo (MoNa) layer is compared to the conventionally used soda-lime glass (SLG) substrate. In particular, the Na out-diffusion mechanism from different MoNa back contacts into the CIGS layer is investigated for different multilayer designs and magnetron sputtering conditions. From the obtained experimental results a Na diffusion model for the MoNa back contact system is developed, which proposes that Na is mainly collected in the MoNa grain boundary region and then diffuses from these grain boundaries towards the CIGS layer. It is demonstrated that with increasing porosity of the MoNa layer the Na diffusion into the CIGS layer is enhanced. In addition, the low activation energy for Na diffusion found for the MoNa back contact proposes that this Na doping technology is suitable for both low and high substrate temperature CIGS processes. For CIGS solar cells with MoNa back contacts, best cell efficiency of 15% was achieved without anti-reflection coating, which exceeded the performance of the reference sample on SLG with standard Mo back contact.

Abstract: Organic/inorganic hybrid solar cells are an interesting type of polymer based solar cells, which combine beneficial properties of inorganic semiconductors with them of polymer based materials, in particular, the easy processability on flexible plastic substrates. Herein, we present a method to prepare polymer/copper indium sulfide hybrid solar cells on flexible PET substrates via the metal xanthate route for the in situ preparation of ligand-free inorganic nanocrystals directly in the conjugated polymer matrix. The issue that the temperatures needed for the formation of the inorganic nanoparticles were too high to apply this preparation route on flexible substrates, was solved in this study by adding n-hexylamine to the precursor solution which facilitates the formation of higher crystalline nanoparticles at lower temperatures. n-Hexylamine thereby reacts with the xanthate forming the corresponding O-2,2-dimethylpentan-3-yl-N-hexylthiocarbamate. Following this modified route, flexible hybrid solar cells with power conversion efficiencies of 1.6% could be realized using temperatures not higher than 140°C in the whole fabrication process. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the metal xanthate route is also well suited for the fabrication of larger area solar cells and present hybrid solar cell modules on glass as well as on flexible PET substrates. In addition, the lifetime of the prepared solar cells was investigated. The devices prepared at low temperature exhibited significantly improved stability compared to devices fabricated at 195°C.

Abstract: Kesterite thin film solar cell has been fabricated by chemical spray pyrolysis (CSP) of an aqueous solution followed by high temperature selenization. The pyrolysis formation of Cu2ZnSnS4 was conducted in atmospheric condition with substrate temperature of 280°C. X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy study confirmed the formation of the single phase Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 kesterite structure after selenization without traceable secondary phases. FESEM image shows a uniform absorber layer without carbon layer formed between CZTSSe and Mo. Power conversion efficiency of 5.1% was obtained with different amounts of selenium incorporation. Power dependent and temperature dependent photoluminescence (PL) study revealed donor-to-acceptor pairs (DAP) transition at low temperature. Severe PL quenching at temperatures above 41K is attributed to the opening of non-radiative recombination channels from the defects associated with non-stoichiometric elemental ratio. Therefore, further enhancement of power conversion efficiency can be achieved by better control of stoichiometry.

Abstract: Spectral transmittance and reflectance in the 300–2500nm solar-optical wavelength range were calculated for nanoparticles of titanium dioxide and vanadium dioxide with radii between 5 and 100nm embedded in transparent dielectric media. Both of the materials are of large importance in green nanotechnologies: thus TiO2 is a photocatalyst that can be applied as a porous film or a nanoparticle composite on indoor or outdoor surfaces for environmental remediation, and VO2 is a thermochromic material with applications to energy-efficient fenestration. The optical properties, including scattering, of the nanoparticle composites were computed from the Maxwell-Garnett effective-medium theory as well as from a four-flux radiative transfer model. Predictions from these theories approach one another in the limit of small particles and in the absence of optical interference. Effects of light scattering can be modeled only by the four-flux theory, though. We found that nanoparticle radii should be less than ~20nm in order to avoid pronounced light scattering.

Abstract: In this study, we report on organic photovoltaics based on inverted structure with the photoactive layer sandwiched between lithium zinc oxide electron transport layer and PEDOT:PSS doped with V2O5 hole transport layer. The efficiency of the PEDOT:PSS device increases from 4.04 to 4.20% as we doped with V2O5. This inverted organic photovoltaic can retain efficiency with only 1.9% degradation after 3 weeks storage in ambient conditions. The degradation rate for PEDOT:PSS device is significantly higher (11.6%) compared to PEDOT:PSS doped with V2O5. The good stability in our device can be attributed to the air stable PEDOT:PSS doped with V2O5 HTL as the interfacial layers. It is found that the degradation rate decreases with increasing V2O5 concentration in PEDOT:PSS.

Abstract: The passivation of p+ Si surfaces is challenging due to the fact that most passivation films have an intrinsically high positive fixed charge. In this work we show experimentally that low-temperature plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposited SiOx/SiNy stacks with a low positive fixed charge density (+1011cm−2) and very low interface defect density (~3×1010eV−1cm−2) as measured by contactless corona-voltage measurements can effectively passivate p+ surfaces resulting in emitter saturation current density (J0e) values of 25 and 45fA/cm2 on planar and textured 75Ω/sq p+ silicon after industrial firing with a set-temperature of ~800°C, respectively. Based on contactless corona-voltage measurements and advanced device simulations, we explain the mechanism of surface passivation by PECVD SiOx/SiNy dielectric stack to be completely dominated by chemical passivation rather than field-effect passivation. Furthermore, from advanced device simulations we illustrate the role of fixed charge in surface passivation and in the extraction of fundamental surface recombination velocity parameter for p+ silicon surfaces. The fundamental surface recombination velocity parameter for electrons is determined to be about 400cm/s at these c-Si/SiOx interfaces. With excellent optical and passivation properties, SiOx/SiNy dielectric stacks are suitable for high-efficiency and cost-effective industrial n-type silicon wafer solar cells.

Abstract: Conversion of solar energy into thermal energy helps reducing consumption of non-renewable energies. Cermets (ceramic–metal composites) are versatile materials suitable, amongst other applications, for solar selective absorbers. Although the presence of metallic Ni particles in the dielectric matrix is a prerequisite for efficient solar selective absorption in NiCrOx cermets, no clear evidence of such particles is reported so far. By combining comprehensive chemical and structural analyses, we reveal the presumed nanostructure which is at the origin of the remarkable optical properties of this cermet material. Using sputtered NiCrOx layers in a solar absorber multilayer stack on aluminium substrate allows us to achieve solar absorptance as high as α=96.1% while keeping thermal emissivity as low as ε=2.2%, both values being comparable to best values recorded so far. With the nanostructure of sputtered NiCrOx cermets eventually revealed, further optimization of solar absorbers can be anticipated and technological exploitation of cermet materials in other applications can be foreseen.

Abstract: The effects of the sulphurization annealing time on the morphological, chemical, structural and electrical properties of CZTS thin films were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy, Hall effect and electrical conductivity measurements in samples annealed during different time intervals. The increase of the annealing time was found to improve the chemical composition of the samples and to, slightly, increase the crystallite size. Small amounts of Na were measured in the samples. However, the concentration of Na does not increase significantly with the annealing time and should not modify the characteristics of the CZTS thin films. It was also found that at high temperature the electrical conductivity is dominated by thermal emission of carriers over the inter-grain potential barriers. As the temperature decreases different hopping conduction mechanisms start to dominate. At first with nearest-neighbour hopping and successively changing to variable range hopping conduction with a crossover from Mott and Efros–Shklovskii behavior. The electrical conductivity, the concentration of free holes, acceptors and donors, traps' density at the grain boundaries and the grain potential barriers height were found to increase with the annealing time. However, a significant drop in the compensation ratio from 0.8 to 0.5 was also detected.

Abstract: A liquid-phase deposition method enables the synthesis of a unique anatase TiO2 structure, which consists of poriferous microtablets with a hairy nanowire skin and a body constructed by a brick-like assembly of nanocuboids, directly onto an ITO substrate. The poriferous TiO2 microtablets (PTM) have square-shaped, rounded vertices, edges that are 10µm in length and a thickness of approximately 5μm. They can be grown at a high density onto an ITO surface from a growth solution that contains ammonium hexafluoro titanate and boric acid. The nanowires that decorate the PTM surface have a diameter of 10nm and a length of approximately 200nm. Its bulk structure is constructed from a brick-like assembly of nanocuboids with a width, length and thickness of approximately 10, 20 and 5nm, respectively. The driving factor for the formation of this structure is oriented attachment under kinetic control. The preliminary results of the application of this structure in dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) devices indicate a power conversion efficiency as high as 3.0%. Because the active surface area in the PTM is large enough for dye adsorption (for a typical dye loading as high as approximately 936nmol/cm2) and surface reactions, a high-efficiency DSSC device may be achievable using this new structure if the optimum conditions are obtained.

The materials used and the structure of the complex are especially designed for photovoltaic application. The encapsulation system was further characterized after an accelerated ageing at 80°C/85% RH for 2000h. The chemical modifications were studied by infrared and Raman microscopies.

Abstract: While acute effects of toxic radiation doses on intestine are well established, we are yet to acquire a complete spectrum of sub-lethal radiation-induced chronic intestinal perturbations at the molecular level. We investigated persistent effects of a radiation dose (2Gy) commonly used as a daily fraction in radiotherapy on oxidants and anti-oxidants, and autophagy pathways, which are interlinked processes affecting intestinal homeostasis. Six to eight weeks old C57BL/6J mice (n=10) were exposed to 2Gy γ-ray. Mice were euthanized two or twelve months after radiation, intestine surgically removed, and flushed using sterile PBS. Parts of the intestine from jejunal–ilial region were fixed, frozen, or used for intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) isolation. While oxidant levels and mitochondrial status were assessed in isolated IEC, autophagy and oxidative stress related signaling pathways were probed in frozen and fixed samples using PCR-based expression arrays and immunoprobing. Radiation exposure caused significant alterations in the expression level of 26 autophagy and 17 oxidative stress related genes. Immunoblot results showed decreased Beclin1 and LC3-II and increased p62, PI3K/Akt, and mTOR. Flow cytometry data showed increased oxidant production and compromised mitochondrial integrity in irradiated samples. Immunoprobing of intestinal sections showed increased 8-oxo-dG and nuclear PCNA, and decreased autophagosome marker LC3-II in IEC after irradiation. We show that sub-lethal radiation could persistently downregulate anti-oxidants and autophagy signaling, and upregulate oxidant production and proliferative signaling. Radiation-induced promotion of oxidative stress and downregulation of autophagy could work in tandem to alter intestinal functions and have implications for post-radiation chronic gastrointestinal diseases.

Abstract: Current thermochromic windows modulate solar transmission primarily within the visible range, resulting in reduced space-conditioning energy use but also reduced daylight, thereby increasing lighting energy use compared to conventional static, near-infrared selective, low-emittance windows. To better understand the energy savings potential of improved thermochromic devices, a hypothetical near-infrared switching thermochromic glazing was defined based on guidelines provided by the material science community. EnergyPlus simulations were conducted on a prototypical large office building and a detailed analysis was performed showing the progression from switching characteristics to net window heat flow and perimeter zone loads and then to perimeter zone heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) and lighting energy use for a mixed hot/cold climate and a hot, humid climate in the US. When a relatively high daylight transmission is maintained when switched (Tsol=0.10–0.50 and Tvis=0.30–0.60) and if coupled with a low-e inboard glazing layer (e=0.04), the hypothetical thermochromic window with a low critical switching temperature range (14–20°C) achieved reductions in total site annual energy use of 14.0–21.1kWh/m2-floor-yr or 12–14%11Percentage values refer to the site annual energy use for the perimeter zone of a specific orientation; the highest relative savings were usually reached for south or west orientation. for moderate- to large-area windows (WWR≥0.30) in Chicago and 9.8–18.6kWh/m2-floor-yr or 10–17%22See above. for WWR≥0.45 in Houston compared to an unshaded spectrally-selective, low-e window (window E1) in south-, east-, and west-facing perimeter zones. If this hypothetical thermochromic window can be offered at costs that are competitive to conventional low-e windows and meet esthetic requirements defined by the building industry and end users, then the technology is likely to be a viable energy-efficiency option for internal load dominated commercial buildings.

Abstract: In this study, caprylic acid (octanoic acid) suitable for thermal energy storage applications was microencapsulated with different wall materials, including urea-formaldehyde resin, melamine-formaldehyde resin, urea+melamine-formaldehyde resin. Microcapsules were prepared using coacervation method. Hardening process of microencapsulated phase change material (PCM) was done with formaldehyde. The morphology and particle sizes of microencapsulated PCM were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, (SEM). The latent heat storage capacities of caprylic acid and microencapsulated caprylic acid were determined with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The chemical characterization of microcapsules was determined by Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. It is concluded that urea-formaldehyde resin was the best capsule wall material for caprylic acid. Based on all results, it can be considered that the microcapsules were synthesized successfully and that, the phase change enthalpies of melting and freezing were about 93.9J/g and 106.1J/g, respectively, the particle diameter was 200nm–1.5μm.

Abstract: Solar cells with rear localized contacts formed with and without the use of deep boron laser doping are compared as an approach to achieve a more repeatable process for high efficiency solar cells. In particular the paper investigates the impact of the belt firing conditions and screen printable Al paste on the quality of localized contact formation. By adjusting the firing profile, cells incorporating deep boron laser doping on the rear surface are shown to better avoid Kirkendall void formation at contact regions, while the cells without need to balance the percentage of Kirkendall void formation against the localized back surface field (LBSF) thickness. The boron laser doping can be integrated into the laser ablation process used to open the rear dielectric, which minimizes the impact on the process steps. Standard Al paste used for commercial screen printed solar cells is shown to be applicable on the boron laser doped solar cells with a peak firing temperature of 700°C. On the contrary, a special designed Al paste for LBSF applications has to be used on the cells without boron doping. An average cell efficiency of 19.8% is achieved on boron laser doped solar cells using both types of Al pastes.

Abstract: Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are a recent technology that has gained much attention as a potential low cost power source. Despite this promise, there is a lack of published studies that address the likely cost of commercial-scale OPV modules. In this work, an engineering study estimate has been performed to determine the projected cost of mass-manufactured OPV modules. The materials, production capital and operating costs have been calculated and sensitivity analyses performed to determine the parameters of greatest economic influence. Significantly, the model includes a calculation of the costs required to establish bulk manufacturing of the current high cost speciality materials components, encompassing synthesis and associated chemical plant design. The economic modelling reveals that the calculated mass-manufactured OPV module costs are considerably lower than current literature estimates, with OPV modules costed at $7.85 per square metre with an uncertainty of±30%. Total module cost was found to be most sensitive to the plastic substrate prices, while the production rate did not have a significant impact on module cost for rates above~50m2/min. The results highlight the future cost potential of OPV technology and can be used to assist with scale-up planning.

Abstract: Ion implantation is a technology suitable for the formation of high quality junctions in silicon solar cell processing. As screen-printing is the state of the art metallization technique for industrial solar cells, the compatibility of ion implanted boron emitters with this metallization technique will be investigated. The fact that selective emitter structures can be in situ formed allows a high freedom in the design of the final emitter structure to meet the different demands of the metallized and passivated part of the emitter. In this work we investigate high dose implantations for the metallized area and low dose implantations for the passivated area that subsequently receive a short furnace anneal at 950 or 1050°C. Applying a high dose in the range of 3e15cm−2 high surface concentrations of around 6e19cm−3 can be reached, allowing for a good contact of the screen-printed metallization. The passivated part of the emitter can be realized by implanting a lower dose (<1e15cm−2). The sheet resistance is in the range of 110–160Ω/sq resulting in very low emitter saturation current densities between 10 and 40fA/cm2. Those experimental results demonstrate that ion implantation of selective boron emitters is compatible with industrial screen-printing technology and enables high cell efficiencies.

Abstract: The morphological, elemental distribution and electrical performance effects of increasing the Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) growth substrate temperature are studied. While the increased substrate growth temperature with no other modifications led to increased CIGS grain size, it also resulted in depth profile flattening of the [Ga]/([Ga]+[In]) ratio. Tuning the Ga profile in the high temperature process led to a more desirable [Ga]/([Ga]+[In]) depth profile and allowed a comparison between high and standard temperature. Devices prepared at higher temperature showed an improved grain size and the electrical performance is very similar to that of the reference sample prepared at a standard temperature.

Abstract: This paper deals with the extraction of the parameters of the single-diode solar cell model from experimental I–V characteristics of Si and Multi-junction solar cells. The extraction is carried out by three different optimization methods in an attempt to judge which method surpasses the others in terms of data-to-model fitting. The first and the second methods are a variation of the Newton-Raphson method and the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm, respectively. Both methods are based on the gradient descent approach. The third method is a global-search method based on a Genetic-Algorithm. The extraction of the parameters was done in two stages. On the first stage, empirical I–V characteristics of solar cells that contained measurement errors were used, whereas on the second stage the parameters were re-extracted using a smooth synthetic I–V data. In the absence of true measured parameter values of the cells, it was left to rate the performance of the three optimization methods by the extraction error alone. Although no definitive conclusions could be drawn from the results of the noisy data, results of the smooth data are far more pronounced in terms of the extraction error, and tend to favor the Newton-Raphson method.

Abstract: Macrophages play a pivotal role in the hosts response to biomaterials being considered as an essential cell type during both optimal tissue-implant integration and pathologic process of implant failure. Hence, understanding of their cellular activity on biomaterials is important for improving evaluation and design of biomaterials for biomedical applications. In the present study, we have comparatively investigated the interactions of titania nanotubes (78nm diameter) and commercial pure Ti with RAW 264.7 macrophages in both standard and pro-inflammatory (stimulation with lipopolysaccharide, LPS) culture conditions. In vitro tests showed that TiO2 nanotubes exhibited significantly decreased inflammatory activity of macrophages with respect to cytokine and chemokine gene expression/protein secretion, induction of foreign body giant cells (FBGCs) and nitric oxide (NO) release thereby mitigating the inflammatory response induced by LPS as compared to flat Ti surface. Therefore, our results suggest a novel role of TiO2 nanotubes in modulating macrophage response in biomaterial-associated bacterial infections. Overall, the current study provides new insight into how TiO2 nanotubes can be involved in macrophage activation and supports the great promise of such surface modifications for biomedical applications.

Androgen receptor and its splice variant, AR-V7, differentially regulate FOXA1 sensitive genes in LNCaP prostate cancer cells,

Abstract: Prostate cancer (PCa) is an androgen-dependent disease, and tumors that are resistant to androgen ablation therapy often remain androgen receptor (AR) dependent. Among the contributors to castration-resistant PCa are AR splice variants that lack the ligand-binding domain (LBD). Instead, they have small amounts of unique sequence derived from cryptic exons or from out of frame translation. The AR-V7 (or AR3) variant is constitutively active and is expressed under conditions consistent with CRPC. AR-V7 is reported to regulate a transcriptional program that is similar but not identical to that of AR. However, it is unknown whether these differences are due to the unique sequence in AR-V7, or simply to loss of the LBD. To examine transcriptional regulation by AR-V7, we have used lentiviruses encoding AR-V7 (amino acids 1-627 of AR with the 16 amino acids unique to the variant) to prepare a derivative of the androgen-dependent LNCaP cells with inducible expression of AR-V7. An additional cell line was generated with regulated expression of AR-NTD (amino acids 1-660 of AR); this mutant lacks the LBD but does not have the AR-V7 specific sequence. We find that AR and AR-V7 have distinct activities on target genes that are co-regulated by FOXA1. Transcripts regulated by AR-V7 were similarly regulated by AR-NTD, indicating that loss of the LBD is sufficient for the observed differences. Differential regulation of target genes correlates with preferential recruitment of AR or AR-V7 to specific cis-regulatory DNA sequences providing an explanation for some of the observed differences in target gene regulation.

Interleukin-32α modulates promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger gene activity by inhibiting protein kinase Cɛ-dependent sumoylation,

Abstract: Interleukin-32 (IL-32) is a proinflammatory cytokine. However, there is growing evidence that IL-32 also plays a mediatory role intracellularly. In this study, we present evidence that IL-32α modifies and inhibits promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF), a sequence-specific transcriptional regulator that regulates the expression of a subset of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISGs). We screened IL-32α-interacting proteins in a human spleen cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid assay, and investigated the functional relevance of the interaction between IL-32α and PLZF. We demonstrated that IL-32α interacts with protein kinase C (PKC)δ and PKCɛ in a phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) dependent way, and that PKCɛ regulates the interaction of IL-32α with PLZF. We verified the involvement of PKCɛ in the interaction between these proteins by using various PKC inhibitors. PLZF is known to be modified by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-1, but it is unclear whether SUMO-2 conjugation of PLZF occurs. We showed that IL-32α inhibited SUMO-2-conjugation of PLZF. Further, we demonstrated that sumoylated PLZF decreased when IL-32α was co-expressed. PKCɛ affected the sumoylation of PLZF only in the presence of IL-32α because PKC inhibitor treatment did not reduce PLZF sumoylation in the absence of IL-32α. We finally investigated whether IL-32α-mediated inhibition of PLZF sumoylation affected the transcriptional activity of PLZF, and demonstrated that the inhibition of sumoylation of PLZF by IL-32α down-regulated ISGs induced by PLZF. Together, our data suggest that IL-32α associates with PLZF and PKCɛ, and then inhibits PLZF sumoylation, resulting in suppression of the transcriptional activity of PLZF.

Abstract: In this work a highly scattering rear Si surface texture (RST) is realized by plasma etching of polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) thin-film solar cells on glass. The resulting RST shows reflection haze values of more than 95% at the Si–air interface. The average feature size of the texture is around 200nm. We use a model based on the scalar scattering theory to calculate the scattering properties of the textured surface. We also use a commercial thin-film solar cell simulator to evaluate the light trapping and current enhancement induced by the texture. Combining this submicron RST with a micrometer-scale glass texture can produce a multi-scale rear Si surface texture. Assuming a 1900nm thick poly-Si solar cell on glass with a high-quality back surface reflector (silicon dioxide/silver stack), the calculated photon density absorbed in the poly-Si solar cell with the multi-scale rear Si surface texture corresponds to a 1-sun short-circuit current density (jsc) of 31.1mA/cm2, which is 1mA/cm2 more than the calculated jsc of a poly-Si solar cell with the same thickness on textured glass but without RST. The calculated current densities do not fu lly take current loss due to parasitic absorption into consideration, hence are slightly overestimated.

Abstract: Intracellular calprotectin (S100A8/A9) functions in the control of the cell cycle checkpoint at G2/M. Dysregulation of S100A8/A9 appears to cause loss of the checkpoint, which frequently characterizes head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). In the present study, we analyzed carcinoma cells for other S100A8/A9-directed changes in malignant phenotype. Using a S100A8/A9-negative human carcinoma cell line (KB), transfection to express S100A8 and S100A9 caused selective down-regulation of MMP-2 and inhibited in vitro invasion and migration. Conversely, silencing of endogenous S100A8 and S100A9 expression in TR146 cells, a well-differentiated HNSCC cell line, increased MMP-2 activity and in vitro invasion and migration. When MMP-2 expression was silenced, cells appeared to assume a less malignant phenotype. To more closely model the architecture of cell growth in vivo, cells were grown in a 3D collagen substrate, which was compared to 2D. Growth on 3D substrates caused greater MMP-2 expression. Whereas hypermethylation of CpG islands occurs frequently in HNSCC, S100A8/A9-dependent regulation of MMP-2 could not be explained by modification of the upstream promoters of MMP2 or TIMP2. Collectively, these results suggest that intracellular S100A8/A9 contributes to the cancer cell phenotype by modulating MMP-2 expression and activity to regulate cell migration and mobility.

Abstract: Tungsten oxide thin films are known for their excellent electrochromic efficiency, nevertheless, most of deposition methods reported in the literature are not suitable to produce high quality films and at low cost. In this paper, tungsten oxide thin films have been deposited on FTO–glass substrates by a surfactant-assisted ultrasonic spray pyrolysis. This deposition method, associated to the presence of surfactant, has led to improved electrochromic performance of tungsten oxide films, without excessive production cost. Tungsten oxide films made by the surfactant-assisted ultrasonic spray pyrolysis show a high specific surface area, which results in one of the highest coloration contrast (83%) ever reported for tungsten oxide thin films. WO3 thin films also show excellent reversibility (94%), as well as good coloration efficiency (28cm2/C).

Abstract: A highly transparent and physically robust step-Al-doped MoO3 layer was successfully utilized as the interconnection layer (ICL) to fabricate high-efficiency inverted tandem polymer solar cells (PSCs). The inverted tandem cell constructed by the same PCDTBT:PC70BM active layer showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.88% with equivalent external quantum efficiency of nearly 80%, implying a high charge-collection efficiency in tandem structure. Incorporation of two sub-cells with complementary absorption spectra leads to further increase of PCE over 7.31%, which is the best results for tandem PSCs with PEDOT:PSS-free interconnection layer.

Abstract: Interface control is an important issue in polymer based solar cells because the influence of interface property on bulk heterojunction transport can govern the device performance. We systematically select a series of thioaromatic molecules to tune the surface characters of the metal-oxide array in inverted ZnO-nanorod/poly(3-hexythiophene):(6,6)-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM)/Ag devices. In addition to physically improving the compatibility between ZnO-nanorod and polymer blend contact junction, those conjugated thioaromatic molecules slightly modulate the nanostructured donor and acceptor percolated networks as revealed by the measured carrier mobility values whereas the modulations of photon absorption efficiency and the exciton dissociation rate are negligible. The balanced charge transport architecture can be obtained by using longer and linearly arranged aromatic rings. Additionally, both series resistance and shunt resistance are also improved. As high as ~80% enhancement in power conversion efficiency of the device has been achieved. The result decouples the contribution of the exciton dissociation rate from the bulk heterojunction charge transport process to device performance in inverted polymer solar cells and can be generalized to hybrid polymer-nanocrystal systems as well.

Abstract: During the photoirreversible degradation of a polymer solar cell (PSC), it is generally assumed that the photooxidation of the organic materials (P3HT, PCBM) affects the device performance. Photooxidation of the organic materials results in a decrease in absorbance as a result of photodecomposition. However, the effect of initial photooxidation on device performance remains to be investigated. In this study, we try to establish the correlation between the initial photooxidation of the organic material and the photovoltaic performance of the PSC. Towards this aim, we investigated the device characteristics by employing a slightly degraded organic material, which had been prepared by photooxidation of the material in the solution state. UV–vis and FT-IR spectra suggest a decrease in the π-conjugation length along with the formation of ketone and sulfoxide derivatives. MALDI-TOF mass spectra indicated the partial molecular scission of P3HT even at the start of photooxidation. A deterioration in performance was observed during the device characterization, as was an increase in the resistance of the organic films. These results indicate that the fragments and oxides generated by the partial molecular scission of P3HT increase the resistance of organic films, resulting in a drop in device performance.

Abstract: In this study, Eu2+-doped barium silicate (Ba2SiO4:Eu2+) nanophosphors dispersed in a surfactant solution were spin-coated on commercially available silicon solar cells to form colloidal crystals on the surface. The crystals then act as luminescence down-shifting centers to generate low-energy photons for incident ultraviolet light. The fluorescence from the Ba2SiO4:Eu2+ nanophosphors was further enhanced by coating a metal-enhanced layer composed of Ag nanoparticles and a SiO2 spacer. The solar cells showed an enhancement of 0.86mA/cm2 in short-circuit current density and approximately 0.64% increase in power conversion efficiency when coated with nanophosphors, SiO2 spacers, and Ag nanoparticles. The properties of cells integrated with the metal-enhanced layer were characterized to identify the roles of nanophosphors and Ag nanoparticles in improved light harvesting. These experiments demonstrated that the colloids of Ba2SiO4:Eu2+ acted as luminescence down-shifting centers in the ultraviolet region and the metallic nanoparticles also helped to enhance fluorescence in the visible region to increase light absorption within the measured spectral regime.

Abstract: In situ grown p-nc-Si:H/a-SiCx:H quantum dot superlattice has been prepared by RF-PECVD at a low temperature of 150°C using layer by layer technique. This preparation method for fabricating superlattice allows controlling the properties of Si quantum dots in potential wells and the characteristics of potential barrier without subsequent annealing treatment, which is fully compatible with thin film Si technologies. High resolution transmission electron microscopy investigations confirm the superlattice structure of silicon quantum dots (~2nm diameter) separated by a-SiCx:H matrix (2–3nm thickness) with several periods. Strong room-temperature photoluminescence and the blue-shift of the PL peak position with increasing barrier height are indicative of quantum confinement effects. Applying p-nc-Si:H/a-SiCx:H superlattice as window layers, high open circuit voltage (>0.99V) was achieved for n–i–p type a-Si:H single junction solar cells.

Abstract: The degradation of non-encapsulated, small-molecule organic solar cells based on ZnPc (zinc phthalocyanine)/C60 with an aluminum top electrode is investigated under different climate conditions and correlated with the water barrier performance of the aluminum electrode layer. The degradation of the solar cells turns out to be dominated by water and can be well predicted by the corrosion of calcium – a sensor for water – under the same conditions. By several independent techniques, an amount of 20±7mg(H2O)m−2 is determined to reduce the solar cell efficiency to 50% of the initial value, independent of humidity and temperature between 20 and 65°C. This experimental value for degradation sensitivity of an organic solar cell allows to translate the encapsulation requirements of the solar cell into a well-defined, objective quantity and allows to predict device lifetimes for different permeation barriers. Furthermore, electroluminescence imaging shows that the degradation is caused solely from a loss of active area caused by water ingress through defects in the aluminum top electrode. For this type of barrier, most of the permeation (>72%) through the aluminum is thus caused by defects with a radius r>0.3µm visible with an optical microscope. Hence, the water ingress through the aluminum top electrode and in turn the lifetime of the organic PV cell can be well predicted by a simple optical inspection.

Abstract: We developed poly(3,4-ethylene dioxylene thiophene):poly(styrene sulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS)-free organic solar cells (OSCs) using buffer and anode-integrated Ta-doped In2O3 (ITaO) films. By co-sputtering of Ta2O5 and In2O3 targets, we obtained buffer and anode-integrated ITaO electrodes with a sheet resistance of 17.11Ω/square, a transmittance of 93.45%, and a work function of 4.9eV, all of which are comparable to conventional ITO anodes. Since ITaO electrodes have similar electrical and optical transmittance to those of ITO films, the conventional bulk heterojunction OSC with ITaO anode showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.348% similar to the OSCs (3.541%) with an ITO anode. In addition, OSCs fabricated on an ITaO electrode successfully operated without an acidic PEDOT:PSS buffer layer and showed a PCE of 2.634%, which was much higher than the comparable OSC with an ITO anode. Therefore, co-sputtered ITaO films simultaneously acting as a buffer and an anode layer can be considered promising transparent electrodes for cost-efficient and reliable OSCs because they can eliminate the use of an acidic PEDOT:PSS buffer layer.

Leishmania donovani, an intramacrophage pathogen, targets host SREBP2, a critical transcription factor, to regulate macrophage plasma membrane cholesterol and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation, favoring parasite invasion and persistence. Leishmania infection triggered membrane-raft reorientation-dependent Lyn-PI3K/Akt pathway activation which in turn deactivated GSK3β to stabilize nuclear SREBP2. Moreover, cells perceiving less available intracellular cholesterol due to its sequestration at the plasma membrane resulted in the deregulation of the ER-residing SCAP-SREBP2-Insig circuit thereby assisting increased nuclear translocation of SREBP2. Both increased nuclear transport and stabilization of SREBP2 caused HMGCR-catalyzed cholesterol biosynthesis-mediated plasma membrane cholesterol enrichment leading to decreased membrane-fluidity and plausibly assisting delay in phagosomal acidification. Parasite survival ensuing entry was further ensured by SREBP2-dependent trasnscriptional up-regulation of UCP2, which suppressed mitochondrial ROS generation, one of the primary microbicidal molecules in macrophages recognized for its efficacy against Leishmania. Functional knock-down of SREBP2 both in vitro and in vivo was associated with reduction in macrophage plasma membrane cholesterol, increased ROS production and lower parasite survival. To our knowledge, this study, for the first time, reveals that Leishmania exploits macrophage cholesterol-dependent SREBP2 circuit to facilitate its entry and survival within the host.

Abstract: This paper introduces the application of a coextrusion printing as a contact and mask-free fine line metallization technology for direct printing of narrow grid lines with a strongly enhanced aspect ratio. Coextrusion printed grid lines enhance short circuit current and lower series resistance through a higher number of filigree fingers. The silver and sacrificial paste that merge inside the nozzle are simultaneously extruded onto the wafer and form a silver paste structure smaller than every design feature inside the nozzle. After contact firing the grid lines become as narrow as 35µm with an aspect ratio up to 0.7. A further shrinkage potential down to 23.7µm width with an aspect ratio up to 0.62 has been demonstrated. Coextrusion printed grid lines outperform screen printed grid lines in a whole slew of geometrical and optical properties. As for example grid line width and height variation is as low as ±0.5µm and the optical effective finger width is far smaller than the screen printed effective finger width. Due to these low effective finger widths the absolute effective shading of 96 coextrusion printed grid lines is less than half of the 80 screen printed grid lines. The calculated short circuit current gain, due to the lower effective shading was experimentally confirmed accordingly. Furthermore a benchmark test in a production like environment was performed. Hereby an absolute cell efficiency gain of +0.25% over screen printed metallization was confirmed and a cell efficiency gain of over +0.35% to +0.4% abs. can be assumed to be achieved by using a direct contacting coextrusion silver paste, which is comparable to state of the art screen printing pastes.

Abstract: We perform carrier lifetime investigations on oxygen-rich boron-doped Czochralski-grown silicon (Cz-Si) wafers. As a characteristic feature of oxygen-rich boron-doped silicon materials, their lifetime is generally limited by boron–oxygen-related defects, intensifying their recombination-active properties under illumination or, more generally speaking, minority-carrier injection. In this study, we examine the following characteristic lifetime values of boron-doped Cz-Si: τ0 after annealing in darkness (i.e. complete boron–oxygen defect deactivation), τd after illumination at room-temperature (i.e. in the completely degraded state) and τ0p after illumination at elevated temperature (i.e. after ‘permanent recovery’). We show that the permanent recovery process can be strongly influenced by a rapid thermal annealing (RTA) step performed in a conventional belt-firing furnace in advance of the permanent recovery process. We show that all measured lifetimes, i.e. τ0, τd as well as τ0p, are strongly influenced by the RTA process. We observe a strong increase of the lifetime after permanent recovery, depending critically on the RTA process parameters. On 1-Ωcm Cz-Si material after permanent recovery we measure lifetimes of τ0p(Δn=1.5×1015cm−3)=210µs without applying the RTA process and up to τ0p(Δn=1.5×1015cm−3)=2020µs using optimized RTA conditions. Apart from the very high lifetimes achieved, the applied RTA process step also strongly influences the kinetics of the permanent recovery process. The recovery process is accelerated by almost two orders of magnitude, compared to a non-treated sample, which proves the industrial relevance of the process. We discuss the results within a recently proposed defect model which ascribes the observed dependence of the kinetics of the recovery process to the presence of boron nano-precipitates and their interaction with free interstitial boron atoms.

Abstract: We report the effect of nanocone arrays (NCAs) as an antireflection coating (ARC) of encapsulation coverglasses on the device performance of encapsulated III–V InGaP/GaAs/Ge triple-junction (TJ) solar cells. The NCAs were fabricated on the single-side surface of glasses using the gold nanopatterns (i.e., nanoclusters) prepared by the glancing angle deposition technique without additional thermal treatment and the subsequent dry etching. Their wetting behavior and optical properties, together with a theoretical prediction using the rigorous coupled-wave analysis method, were investigated. The NCAs ARC coverglass exhibited a much lower water contact angle (θCA) of <5° (i.e., superhydrophilic surface) and higher solar weighted transmittance (SWT) of ~95.9% over a wide wavelength region of 300–1800nm at normal incidence compared to the bare coverglass (i.e., θCA~63° and SWT ~92.8%). The use of the NCAs ARC coverglass in encapsulated III–V InGaP/GaAs/Ge TJ solar cells led to the higher short circuit current density (Jsc) of 14.22mA/cm2 and thus improved the conversion efficiency (η) to 32.07% (cf., Jsc=13.84mA/cm2 and η=30.6% for the cell with the bare coverglass). For incident angle-dependent solar cell characteristics, it also showed a superior solar power conversion property in wide incident light angles of 20–80°.

Abstract: Four new organic dyes, 1–4, containing triphenylamine (TPA) donors connected through different acetylene linkages to fluorene bridges and cyanoacrylic acid acceptors were designed and synthetized for photoconversion in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Their absorption spectra, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties were investigated. Shortening the bridge between the TPA moiety and the anchoring group leads to a dramatic increase in the overall photoconversion efficiency (1>3>4>2).

Abstract: Cell volume regulation is a fundamental activity to maintain cell survival, and aquaporins and chloride channels play important roles in this process. However, the interactions between these channels are far from clear. In this study, the interactions between AQP-3 and ClC-3 were investigated in CNE-1 and CNE-2Z nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells, which are well and poorly differentiated, respectively. The correlation coefficient of AQP-3 and ClC-3 protein phylogenetic trees was 0.319. In CNE-1 cells, there are overlapping distributions of AQP-3 and ClC-3, mainly in the plasma membrane. This was confirmed by the co-immunoprecipitation of AQP-3 and ClC-3, showing that they could be interlinked and form complexes. AQP-3 over-expression had no significant effects on swelling-induced Cl− currents (ICl,swell); however, ICl,swell could be inhibited by aquaporin blockers, anti-AQP-3 antibodies and AQP-3-siRNAs. In addition, the AQP-3 expression was decreased by down-regulation of ClC-3 expression, indicating that ClC-3 can modulate the expression of AQP-3 proteins. The effects of aquaporin blockers, anti-AQP-3 antibodies and AQP-3 over-expression on ICl,swell in CNE-2Z cells were consistent with those in CNE-1 cells. In conclusion, AQP-3 and ClC-3 are functionally-related integral membrane channel proteins, and their interactions are involved in cell volume regulation in CNE-1 and CNE-2Z cells. The opening of ClC-3 transports Cl− across the cell membrane and then drives the efflux of water through AQP-3 channels and ion channels; AQP-3 may interact with ClC-3 in order to regulate the effluxes of chloride and water.

Abstract: Caffeine causes a diverse range of pharmacological effects that are time- and concentration-dependent and reversible. The detailed mechanisms of caffeine in tumor suppression via tumor suppressor protein p53 remain unclear. The isoforms of p53 are physiological proteins that are expressed in normal cells and generated via alternative promoters, splicing sites and/or translational initiation sites. In this study, we investigated how caffeine modulated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via the expression of various alternatively spliced p53 isoforms. Caffeine reduced p53α expression and induced the expression of p53β, which contains an alternatively spliced p53 C-terminus. In HeLa cells, the expression levels of many serine/arginine-rich splicing factors, including serine/arginine-rich splicing factors 2 and 3, were altered by caffeine. Serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 3 was a promising candidate for the serine/arginine-rich splicing factors responsible for the alternative splicing of p53 in response to caffeine treatment. In addition to p53-dependent functions, multiple target genes of serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 3 suggest that caffeine can regulate epithelial-mesenchymal-transition and hypoxic conditions to inhibit the survival of tumor cells. In summary, our data provide a new pathway of caffeine-modulated tumor suppression via the alternative splicing of the target genes of serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 3.

Abstract: We report on a study on the correlation between the photoluminescence and the photoelectrochemical properties of ZnO–TiO2 heterogeneous nanostructure composed of anatase TiO2 nanotubes and wurtzite ZnO coatings. Vertically aligned ZnO coated TiO2 nanotube (ZnO/TiO2 NT) arrays have been fabricated by atomic layer deposition of ZnO coatings on electrochemical anodization formed TiO2 nanotubes. The obtained ZnO/TiO2 NT arrays show higher photoresponse to shorter wavelength light than to longer wavelength light. A reduction in photoluminescence and an enhancement in photoelectrochemical activity are observed for annealed ZnO/TiO2 NT arrays. ZnO/TiO2 NTs with thinner ZnO coatings rather than thicker ZnO coatings have better photoelectrochemical properties. Compared with bare TiO2 NT arrays, an increase in photocurrent of about 50 percent is obtained for the arrays of 450°C annealed of ZnO/TiO2 NTs with 10-cycle deposition of ZnO coatings under visible illumination with cutoff of 420nm.

Abstract: The presented work addresses the issue of lifetime prediction and intercomparison for organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices tested under different environmental conditions according to ISOS guidelines proposed recently at the International Summit on Organic Photovoltaic Stability. The studies employed P3HT:PCBM based devices produced with different architectures and methods ranging from spin coating to roll-to-roll manufacturing. The purpose of the chosen diversity was to establish the possible spread in the ageing rates generated by different architectures. A logarithmic lifetime diagram associated with the common time units was used for presenting the ageing data, which regardless of the spread in the lifetimes allowed categorizing the level of the stability of P3HT:PCBM based devices tested under different ageing conditions. Moreover, the approach also allowed for estimating the acceleration factors between the moderate and harsh ISOS test conditions employed in the study, as well as identifying the level of improvement of the device stability after encapsulation. The effects of different device architectures and encapsulation techniques on ageing rates of the samples were also studied. This report presents the early steps towards establishing a prediction tool for identifying the lifetime of OPV devices under operational conditions based on the tests under harsh (accelerated) conditions.

Abstract: The lack of an efficiency increase with increasing Ga content in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells has attracted much scientific interest. It has been claimed that the physical properties of grain boundaries are responsible for this curious effect. Here, we present an in-depth analysis of electronic potential barriers at grain boundaries (GBs) in a series of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGSe) thin films using Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) measurements, extending our previous study [Baier et al., Sol. Energy Mater. Sol. Cells 103 (2012) 86–92]. Here, (i) we show, by comparison with data of the crystal lattice orientations, that localization of GBs purely from KPFM topography data allows reliable localization of GBs. (ii) We consider the averaging effect of KPFM due to long-range electrostatic forces for the analysis of the electronic GB properties to determine the real potential barrier height for each individual GB; we determine potential variations ranging from −400 to +400mV. (iii) We consider the different physical origin of positive and negative potential barriers and present a quantitative analysis of the results to determine charge carrier concentration and defect densities at GBs. From our data and analysis we do not observe any systematic variation of these quantities with the Ga content.

Abstract: Polycrystalline CdTe solar cell performance under high-intensity light irradiance was studied. The short-circuit current density and the open-circuit voltage were increased linearly and the fill factor and the efficiency of CdTe solar cells were decreased with increased light irradiance intensity. Analytical analysis was carried out to analyze the factors which induced the decreased fill factor. It was found that under 1-Sun light irradiation, the series resistance of both the CdTe and the front electrode (F-doped SnO2, FTO, sheet resistance of 14Ω/sq) films contributed comparably to the series resistance. Under high-intensity irradiance of 25.9Sun, the resistance of the CdTe layer was decreased to one hundredth value of that under 1-Sun irradiance, while the resistance of FTO remained unchanged. The experimental results clearly demonstrated that the electrical resistance of the FTO electrode was the limiting factor for the CdTe cell efficiency working under concentrated light irradiance.

Abstract: In this work passivated rear contacts are used to replace point contact passivation schemes for high-efficiency n-type crystalline silicon solar cells. Our structure is based on an ultra-thin tunnel oxide (SiO2) and a phosphorus-doped silicon layer, which significantly reduce the surface recombination at the metal–semiconductor interface. The passivation and transport mechanisms of this passivated contact will be addressed within this paper. Particular consideration will be given to the tunnel oxide's impact on interface passivation and on the I–V characteristics of n-type Si solar cells featuring a boron-diffused emitter. It will be shown that the tunnel oxide is a vital part of this passivated contact and that it is required to achieve excellent interface passivation for both open-circuit and maximum power point (MPP) conditions (implied open-circuit voltage iVoc>710mV and implied fill factor iFF>84%). It will also become clear that the transport barrier arising from the tunnel oxide does not constrict the majority carrier flow. Thus, a low series resistance is obtained, which in conjunction with the high iFF enables FFs well above 82%. Investigations on cell levels lead to an independently confirmed conversion efficiency of 23.0% for n-type cells with a boron-diffused emitter and the herein developed passivated rear contact, in which the efficiency is not limited by the electrical properties of our passivated contacts.

Abstract: We developed organic solar cells based on multiple-device stacked structures featuring complementary absorption behavior. The first, semitransparent (ST) subcell featured an inverted structure; its anode comprised a MoO3/Ag bilayer. This structure provided a transmittance of greater than 35% in the visible region. The second subcell, featuring a low-band-gap small molecule in its photoactive layer, was stacked onto the ST device; the two subcells could be connected either in series or in parallel. Because the two subcells exhibited complementary absorption behavior, their stacked structure connected in parallel displayed a power conversion efficiency of 4.37%, greater than those of the isolated subcells.

Abstract: In this study, Bio-based PCMs were prepared by the stirring of carbon nanomaterials, such as exfoliated graphite nanoplatelets (xGnP) and carbon nanotubes (CNT), in liquid Bio PCM, for high thermal conductivity. Carbon nanomaterials were added to Bio PCM at different mass fractions (1.0, 3.0 and 5.0wt%). The microstructures were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and showed good dispersion of Bio-based PCM composites. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) results showed good compatibility between Bio-based PCM and prepared carbon nanomaterials. The thermal conductivities of composites were significantly increased, as the carbon nanomaterials loading contents increased. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis results indicated that Bio-based PCM/xGnP composites maintained their large latent heat values and suitable phase change temperatures, due to large surface area, and good dispersion of carbon nanomaterials. TGA analysis revealed that Bio PCM composites had good thermal durability in the working temperature ranges. Therefore, Bio PCM composites can be considered as suitable candidates for latent heat thermal energy storage, with high thermal performance.

Abstract: We report on flexible photovoltaic cell fabricated on polymeric substrate optimized for indoor energy harvesting. We have fabricated small area modules (up to 30cm2) obtained by monolithic integration of a-Si:H p-i-n solar cells deposited by PECVD at low temperature with excellent mechanical strength, high ability of folding and very good stability. The photovoltaic thin film module is optimized for indoor light generated by indoor lamps and has efficiency as high as 9.1% on aperture area even at less than 100lx of light intensity (under F12 fluorescent lamp spectrum). The optimized system can be used to energize thin film batteries and can be assembled in a flexible system associated with a wireless sensor network or other electronic devices.

Abstract: In the last years steel foil has become an attractive candidate for use as a flexible substrate material for Cu(Inx,Ga1−x)Se2 thin-film solar cells (CIGS). It is stable at the high temperatures present during CIGS processing and is also commercially available. However, one disadvantage is the diffusion of substrate elements into the CIGS layer, which are detrimental for the performance of solar cells. We found a direct correlation between the iron (Fe) content in the CIGS layer and corresponding solar cell parameters. A deep defect related to Fe impurities could be detected by admittance spectroscopy measurements. The solar cell parameters could be well fitted by simulation with recombination at an acceptor like deep defect in the bulk of the CIGS layer. The simulated density of deep defect states correlates nicely with the Fe concentration in the CIGS layer. From this we conclude that Fe replaces an In (or Ga) site in the CIGS lattice and creates an FeIn2+ (or FeGa2+) deep acceptor state in the bulk of CIGS layers, which is detrimental already at a low concentration in the sub ppm range. The simulations enabled us to estimate the maximum Fe concentration in CIGS layers which is tolerable without disturbing the performance of high-efficiency CIGS solar cells.

Abstract: K-homology splicing regulator protein (KHSRP), a multifunctional RNA-binding protein, was originally thought to primarily control mRNA decay. KHSRP was shown to be involved in p38MAPK, NF-κB and the JAK2-STAT-1a pathways. Besides, KHSRP regulated neuronal localization of beta-actin and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) mRNAs, respectively. However, the expression and roles of KHSRP in peripheral system lesions and repair are still unknown. In our study, we found that KHSRP levels were relatively higher in the crushed sciatic nerves, significantly reached a highest level at day 5. Spatially, we observed that KHSRP had a major colocalization with Schwann cells (SCs) and neurons. KHSRP was connected with promyelinating SCs marker. KHSRP promoted the decay of beta-catenin (β-catenin) mRNA which was inactivated by PI3K-AKT signaling. We doubted that KHSRP might participate in Schwann cells differentiation by regulation of β-catenin mRNA decay. In vitro, in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-induced Schwann cells differentiation system, we detected the increased KHSRP in cytoplasm and decreased β-catenin at protein and mRNA level. In differentiation model of rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC12) induced by nerve growth factor (NGF) and primary dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cell culture, KHSRP also acted on neuronal differentiation. Specially, KHSRP-specific siRNA-transfected cells did not show morphological change, which was similar to β-catenin overexpressed SCs. During SC/neuron co-cultures, KHSRP was transported to cytoplasm and involved in SCs myelination. In conclusion, we speculated that KHSRP was involved in SCs and neuronal differentiation by inducing β-catenin mRNA decay.

Abstract: The rear side of a silicon solar cell is often designed to minimize surface recombination, series resistance, and cost, but not necessarily parasitic absorption. We present a comprehensive study of parasitic absorption in the metal layer of solar cells with dielectric/metal rear reflectors. The sub-bandgap reflectance of a solar cell or test structure is proposed as an experimentally accessible probe of parasitic absorption, and it is correlated with short-circuit current density. The influence of surface texture, dielectric refractive index and thickness, and metal refractive index on sub-bandgap reflectance—and thus current—is then both calculated and measured. From the results, we formulate design rules that promote optimum infrared response in a wide variety of silicon solar cells.

Abstract: Herein we present a methodology for improving the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells made by photoactive layers of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) of non-optimized microstructure. In our study we achieve a 47% improvement in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the device by utilizing a thiophene-based quinoid (QBT) moiety as the third component in the P3HT:PCBM:QBT photoactive layers. Based on a set of independent characterization experiments we address the QBT composition dependent photophysical, electrical, thermal, structural and morphology-related properties of the ternary photovoltaic P3HT:PCBM:QBT system for elucidating the origin of the PCE improvement. In small amounts (0.3–0.6wt%), QBT serves as a nucleation agent, it enlarges the size of the P3HT crystallites by 15% and it increases the fraction of well-ordered P3HT chains in the P3HT:PCBM:QBT layer. The improved microstructure of the photoactive layer in combination with the QBT-assisted photo-induced hole transfer step from PCBM to P3HT, lead to an increase of the charge photogeneration yield in the P3HT:PCBM:QBT triple bulk heterojunction. The relatively small optical gap of QBT facilitates a resonant energy transfer step from the photoexcited PCBM to the QBT followed by a charge transfer process between QBT and the P3HT matrix. Based on these findings we propose general guidelines for the design of next generation functional additives to be used in organic photovoltaics.

Abstract: Ascertaining the operating cell temperature of a high concentrator photovoltaic (HCPV) module is critical because its electrical parameters are influenced by this factor. However, measuring the cell temperature of an HCPV module is a complex task due to the unique features of such a module. This paper calculates the cell temperature in an HCPV module by using different methods to address this important issue. We conducted a comparative study of four methods used to estimate the cell temperature of an HCPV module, including the IEC 60904-5 method, a method based on thermal resistance proposed by the Instituto de Sistemas Fotovoltaicos de Concentración, the Lineal method and an artificial neural network-based method introduced in this paper. The complete procedures, parameters and coefficients required to estimate the cell temperature with each method are provided. The results show that methods based on direct measurements of the HCPV module perform better than methods based on atmospheric parameters. However, all of the studied methods can be used to estimate cell temperatures with an acceptable margin of error.

Abstract: A new class of hole transport layer (HTL), which is composed of poly(styrene sulfonic acid) grafted with polyaniline (PSSA−g−PANI) and graphene oxide (GO), was prepared by adding GO into PSSA−g−PANI aqueous solution. The PSSA−g−PANI/GO composites exhibit high optical transparency and high electrical conductivity. When the composite with 2.5wt% GO loading was used as HTL material for the device based on poly(3-hexylthiophene)/PC61BM blend, the device exhibits an enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.23%, which is 23% higher than the PCE of device with the conventional HTL material, PEDOT:PSS (3.44%). This enhancement of PCE arises mainly from an increase of the short-circuit current density due to higher optical transparency and higher electrical conductivity of PSSA−g−PANI/GO composite. When the PSSA−g−PANI/GO composite is applied as HTL to a low bandgap polymer-based solar cell, PTB7:PC71BM blend, the PCE is also enhanced as compared to the device with PEDOT:PSS, providing us with the possibility to use PSSA−g−PANI/GO as a hole transport layer for various polymer-based solar cells to enhance the photovoltaic performance.

Abstract: Heat shock protein 40 (Hsp40) acts as a co-chaperone with Hsp70 to promote protein folding, protein transport and degradation. The human Hsp40 family contains more than 40 members, some of which can exist as phosphoproteins in the cell. However, little is known about the protein kinases responsible for their phosphorylation and the functional relevance of this post-translational modification remains elusive. Here we show that Hsp40/DnaJB1 is an in vitro and in vivo substrate for the mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 5 (MK5). MK5 and Hsp40/DnaJB1 form complexes in cells and this interaction is accomplished by the C-terminal regions of both proteins. MK5 can phosphorylate Hsp40/DnaJB1 at several residues in vitro. Studies with specific phosphoantibodies indicate that MK5 phosphorylates Hsp40/DnaJB1 in vivo at Ser-149 or/and Ser-151 and Ser-171 in the C-terminal domain of Hsp40/DnaJB1. MK5 modestly stimulates the ATP hydrolyse activity of Hsp40/Hsp70 complex and enhances the repression of heat shock factor 1 driven transcription by Hsp40/DnaJB1.

Abstract: Members of the casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) family (Cbl, Cbl-b and Cbl-c) of ubiquitin ligases serve as negative regulators of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). An essential role of Cbl-family protein-dependent ubiquitination for efficient ligand-induced lysosomal targeting and degradation is now well-accepted. However, a more proximal role of Cbl and Cbl-b as adapters for CIN85-endophilin recruitment to mediate ligand-induced initial internalization of RTKs is supported by some studies but refuted by others. Overexpression and/or incomplete depletion of Cbl proteins in these studies is likely to have contributed to this dichotomy. To address the role of endogenous Cbl and Cbl-b in the internalization step of RTK endocytic traffic, we established Cbl/Cbl-b double-knockout (DKO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and demonstrated that these cells lack the expression of both Cbl-family members as well as endophilin A, while they express CIN85. We show that ligand-induced ubiquitination of EGFR, as a prototype RTK, was abolished in DKO MEFs, and EGFR degradation was delayed. These traits were reversed by ectopic human Cbl expression. EGFR endocytosis, assessed using the internalization of 125I-labeled or fluorescent EGF, or of EGFR itself, was largely retained in Cbl/Cbl-b DKO compared to wild type MEFs. EGFR internalization was also largely intact in Cbl/Cbl-b depleted MCF-10A human mammary epithelial cell line. Inducible shRNA-mediated knockdown of CIN85 in wild type or Cbl/Cbl-b DKO MEFs had no impact on EGFR internalization. Our findings, establish that, at physiological expression levels, Cbl, Cbl-b and CIN85 are largely dispensable for EGFR internalization. Our results support the model that Cbl–CIN85–endophilin complex is not required for efficient internalization of EGFR, a prototype RTK.

Abstract: The minimization of area losses for the integrated series connection of thin-film silicon solar modules is investigated for the front-contact separation process (P1). Sputtered ZnO:Al and commercially available SnO2:F front-contact TCO material on glass substrates were used for laser ablation processing. Problems and limits of width reduction were identified for processing wavelengths of 355nm, 532nm, and 1064nm. Minimal scribe widths of 10μm were achieved with sufficiently high process stability. Material modifications near the scribe edge and their impact on the cell performance were characterized. Electrical properties of the TCO material after P1 processing were investigated with conductive Atomic Force Microscopy. Surface morphology analysis with Scanning Electron Microscopy showed redeposition of ablated material in vicinity of the scribe. The influence on the solar cell current generation was evaluated qualitatively with Laser Beam Induced Current measurements. Both material systems were characterized with and without subsequent wet-chemical cleaning/etching treatment after laser processing. With treatment, solar cell deterioration near the scribe edge was greatly reduced implying that material modifications originate from debris surface redeposition rather than heat-affected zone formation.

Abstract: Sandwich configurations consisting of hole-only and electron-only devices are employed to study the transport properties of polymer/fullerene blended material. Upon thermal annealing at 150°C and subsequent device characterisations a direct correlation between solar cell device power conversion efficiency and charge carrier mobilities is identified. The highest power conversion efficiency reported herein resulted from the electron to hole mobility ratio of 4.78. This ratio further reduces to 0.357 at 175°C as a result of the deterioration of electron mobility at the same time as enhancement in hole carrier mobility with no further improvement in PCE. Effects of thermal annealing on trap density reveal that the trap assisted recombination is more dominant as compared to the bimolecular recombination. Furthermore such a mechanism enhances as a result of increasing trap density at higher annealing temperatures. The effect of light intensity on the open circuit voltage VOC further verifies that the dominant recombination process is through trap assisted recombination.

Abstract: Physiological electric field (EF) is a potent guidance cue for many physiological development and pathological conditions. The EF induced cellular responses such as migration and proliferation, are considered to be regulated by multiple signaling pathways in a coordinated way. Unlike the signaling transduction regulating the cellular responses toward chemical gradients, the signaling network involved in electric stimulation shows a unique manner, combining the regulation of ion channels, membrane receptors and associated intracellular signaling pathways. This review shall discuss the cellular responses in EF, and summarize the primary signaling network activated during the EF-induced cellular response.

Abstract: Nanofluids are found to have good stability and useful optical and thermal properties as direct sunlight absorbers in solar collectors. The inherent hydrophobic nature of carbon nanotubes was overcome using a new dispersion procedure (treating carbon nanotubes with base media) to prepare nanofluids. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first application of aqueous suspension based on alkaline functionalized carbon nanotubes as an absorber fluid in a sunlight harvesting device. Dispersion stability and optical properties of the nanofluid were estimated. Spectral absorbance analysis confirms the relative stability of prepared nanofluids versus sediment time. The extinction coefficient of aqueous suspensions of functionalized carbon nanotubes shows remarkable improvement compared to the base fluid even at low particle loadings. We also demonstrate thermal conductivity improvements of up to 32% by adding only 150ppm functionalized carbon nanotubes to water as the absorbing medium. Their promising optical and thermal properties, together with the appropriate stability of nanofluids, make them very interesting for increasing the overall efficiency of low-temperature direct absorption solar collectors.

Abstract: The deposition of Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) thin films with a two-stage co-evaporation process was investigated with in situ laser light scattering (LLS) and ex situ characterization methods. As a result of the process conditions as well as intrinsic reactions, the film growth is divided into distinct growth phases with characteristic phase formation processes in each phase. In a first phase, under supply of Cu, Zn, Sn and Se, only Cu2−xSe and ZnSe are deposited on the substrate. A film with several hundred nanometer thickness is necessary to initiate the CZTSe formation. Then, in a second phase, CZTSe grows by incorporation of Cu and Sn in ZnSe while Cu2−xSe remains as secondary phase. In the second process stage with terminated Cu evaporation, the remaining Cu2−xSe is consumed and the film stoichiometry turns from Cu-rich to Cu-poor. A substantial influence on the growth process is found for the Mo substrate, CZTSe growth is hindered by a detrimental interaction between Mo and CZTSe. During the whole process, the Cu2−xSe phase plays an important role in the grain growth process and supports the formation of large CZTSe grains.

Abstract: We prepared two-phase hydrogenated silicon carbide (SiC:H) intrinsic materials from silane–methane gas mixtures at a low temperature of 150°C using radio-frequency plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (RF-PECVD). We then employed Raman, HRTEM and FT-IR measurements to investigate the structural evolution of the resulting two-phase heterostructure films, and confirmed the medium range order of SiC:H materials based on the intensity of the transverse acoustic mode and microstructure factor. High concentration of medium order materials associated with nanocrystalline Si was obtained in the amorphous silicon carbide/nanocrystalline silicon hybrid layers. Under optimized deposition conditions, the intrinsic film has an optical band gap of up to ~2.0eV and photosensitivity of up to ~4×106; these qualities make it an excellent intrinsic material to use when fabricating wide band gap top cells for multi-junction thin film silicon solar cells. Using both wide band gap window layers and intrinsic layers, a high open-circuit voltage of 1.04V and short-circuit current density of 9.66mA/cm2 were achieved for a single junction n–i–p solar cell on stainless steel.

Abstract: We describe the method for creating nominally cool gray coatings by mixing titanium dioxide rutile and black pigments that include chromite iron nickel black, manganese ferrite black spinel, perylene black and dioxazine purple. Although the solar reflectance of the gray coatings prepared by adding chromite iron nickel black and manganese ferrite black spinel pastes separately into a white coating are higher than that of the standard gray coating of colors of similarly lightness with the mixtures of carbon black and titanium dioxide rutile, they are actually not qualified cool gray coatings. The light gray coatings colored with a mixture of perylene black and titanium dioxide rutile are eligible cool gray coatings with a green shade. The gray coatings produced by mixing titanium dioxide rutile and dioxazine purple and chrome titanium yellow are also real cool coatings with a violet shade.

Abstract: Hookworm activation-associated secreted proteins can be structurally classified into at least three different groups. The hallmark feature of Group 1 activation-associated secreted proteins is a prominent equatorial groove, which is inferred to form a ligand binding site. Furthermore, a conserved tandem histidine motif is located in the centre of the groove and believed to provide or support a yet to be determined catalytic activity. Here, we report three-dimensional crystal structures of Na-ASP-2, an L3-secreted activation-associated secreted protein from the human hookworm Necator americanus, which demonstrate transition metal binding ability of the conserved tandem histidine motif. We further identified moderate phosphohydrolase activity of recombinant Na-ASP-2, which relates to the tandem histidine motif. By panning a random 12-mer peptide phage library, we identified a peptide with high similarity to the human calcium-activated potassium channel SK3, and confirm binding of the synthetic peptide to recombinant Na-ASP-2 by differential scanning fluorimetry. Potential binding modes of the peptide to Na-ASP-2 were studied by molecular dynamics simulations which clearly identify a preferred topology of the Na-ASP-2:SK3 peptide complex.

Abstract: Patterning of neural crest (NC) for the formation of specific structures along the anterio-posterior (A-P) body axis is governed by a combinatorial action of Hox genes, which are expressed in the neuroepithelium at the time of NC induction. Hoxb5 was expressed in NC at both induction and migratory stages, and our previous data suggested that Hoxb5 played a role in the NC development. However, the underlying mechanisms by which Hoxb5 regulates the early NC development are largely unknown. Current study showed that both the human and mouse Foxd3 promoters were bound and trans-activated by Hoxb5 in NC-derived neuroblastoma cells. The binding of Hoxb5 to Foxd3 promoter in vivo was further confirmed in the brain and neural tube of mouse embryos. Moreover, Wnt1-Cre mediated perturbation of Hoxb5 signaling at the dorsal neural tube in mouse embryos resulted in Foxd3 down-regulation. In ovo, Foxd3 alleviated the apoptosis of neural cells induced by perturbed Hoxb5 signaling, and Hoxb5 induced ectopic Foxd3 expression in the chick neural tube. This study demonstrated that Hoxb5 (an A-P patterning gene) regulated the NC development by directly inducing Foxd3 (a NC specifier and survival gene).

Abstract: We report the influence of magnetron sputtered zirconium-doped indium tin oxide (ITO:Zr) films with high mobility and work function on the heterojunction with intrinsic thin layer (HIT) solar cell. The addition of oxygen (O2) to argon (Ar) flow ratio during the deposition process improves the Hall mobility of the ITO:Zr films while the carrier concentration decreased. The small amount of oxygen resulted in an enhancement of work function while excess amount of O2 was not suitable for the electrical and surface properties of ITO:Zr films. The increase of O2/Ar flow ratio from 0% to 0.4% improved the work function from 5.03 to 5.13eV while the conductivity of ITO:Zr films remained about the same. The ITO:Zr films were employed as a front anti-reflection layer in a HIT solar cell and the best photo-voltage parameters were found to be Voc=710mV, Jsc=33.66mA/cm2, FF=72.4%, and η=17.31% for the O2/Ar flow ratio of 0.4%. The increase of ITO:Zr work function leads to an increase in open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) of the device. Therefore, the ITO:Zr films with high work function can be used to modify the front barrier height in the HIT solar cell.

Abstract: It is known that excessive adipogenesis contributes to osteoporosis, suggesting that trans-differentiation of adipogenic committed preadipocytes into osteoblasts may be a potential therapeutical approach for osteoporosis. We explored whether bone morphogenic protein 9 (BMP9) could induce 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to trans-differentiate into osteoblasts. BMP9 effectively increased expression of osteogenic markers and promoted mineralization in preadipocytes. However, BMP9 also led to adipogenic differentiation of preadipocytes, as evidenced by increased lipid accumulation and up-regulation of adipogenic transcription factors. In order to regulate the switch between osetogenesis and adipogenesis, we evaluated the effect of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) on BMP9-induced differentiation of preadipocytes. We found that ATRA enhanced BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation and blocked BMP9-induced adipogenic differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, ATRA was shown to elevate BMP9 expression and activate BMP/Smad signaling. Additionally, BMP9 and ATRA exerted a synergistic effect on activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Knockdown of β-catenin abolished the stimulatory effect of ATRA on BMP9-induced alkaline phosphatase activity and reversed the inhibitory effect of ATRA on BMP9-induced adipogenesis in preadipocytes. Furthermore, ATRA and BMP9 synergistically repressed glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) activity and promoted Akt phosphorylation, and inhibited expression of phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) that antagonizes phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) function, suggesting that Wnt/β-catenin signaling was activated at least partly through PI3K/Akt/GSK3β pathway. Collectively, ATRA mediated BMP9-induced osteogenic or adipogenic differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes by BMP/Smad and Wnt/β-catenin signaling. The combination of BMP9 and ATRA may be explored as an effective therapeutic strategy for osteoporosis.

Abstract: Mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolism have recently emerged as important actors of stemness and differentiation. On the one hand, the differentiation of stem cells is associated with an induction of mitochondrial biogenesis and a shift from glycolysis toward oxidative phosphorylations (OXPHOS). In addition, interfering with mitochondrial biogenesis or function impacts stem cell differentiation. On the other hand, some inverse changes in mitochondrial abundance and function are observed during the reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Yet although great promises in cell therapy might generate better knowledge of the mechanisms regulating the stemness and differentiation of somatic stem cells (SSCs)—which are preferred over embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and iPSCs because of ethical and safety considerations—little interest was given to the study of their mitochondria. This study provides a detailed characterization of the mitochondrial biogenesis occurring during the hepatogenic differentiation of bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs). During the hepatogenic differentiation of BM-MSCs, an increased abundance of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is observed, as well as an increased expression of several mitochondrial proteins and biogenesis regulators, concomitant with increased OXPHOS activity, capacity, and efficiency. In addition, opposite changes in mitochondrial morphology and in the abundance of several OXPHOS subunits were found during the spontaneous dedifferentiation of primary hepatocytes. These data support reverse mitochondrial changes in a different context from genetically-engineered reprogramming. They argue in favor of a mitochondrial involvement in hepatic differentiation and dedifferentiation.

Abstract: Copper is necessary for all organisms since it acts as a cofactor in different enzymes, although toxic at high concentrations. ATP7B is one of two copper-transporting ATPases in humans, its vital role being manifested in Wilson disease due to a mutation in the gene that encodes this pump. Our objective has been to determine whether pathways involving protein kinase C (PKC) modulate ATP7B activity. Different isoforms of PKC (α, ɛ, ζ) were found in Golgi-enriched membrane fractions obtained from porcine liver. Cu(I)–ATPase activity was assessed in the presence of different activators and inhibitors of PKC signaling pathways. PMA (10−8M), a PKC activator, increased Cu(I)–ATPase activity by 60%, whereas calphostin C and U73122 (PKC and PLC inhibitors, respectively) decreased the activity by 40%. Addition of phosphatase λ decreased activity by 60%, irrespective of pre-incubation with PMA. No changes were detected with 2μM Ca2+, whereas PMA plus EGTA increased activity. This enhanced activity elicited by PMA decreased with a specific inhibitor of PKCɛ to levels comparable with those found after phosphatase λ treatment, showing that the ɛ isoform is essential for activation of the enzyme. This regulatory phosphorylation enhanced Vmax without modifying affinities for ATP and copper. It can be concluded that signaling pathways leading to DAG formation and PKCɛ activation stimulate the active transport of copper by ATP7B, thus evidencing a central role for this specific kinase-mediated mechanism in hepatic copper handling.

Abstract: We report that thermal annealing of P3HT:PCBM bulk heterojunctons (BHJs) on top of a commonly used sol–gel ZnO electron transport layer can lead to the formation of PCBM clusters, which significantly decreased short circuit current density (up to 45%), open circuit voltage (up to 35%), and fill factor (up to 15%). To understand the cause of this phenomenon, we deposited ZnO films using different sol–gel recipes and systematically studied the correlation between sol–gel ZnO processing and the morphology of the P3HT:PCBM BHJ. We showed that higher amounts of monoethanolamine (MEA), a stabilizer in the ZnO sol–gel precursor, lead to higher densities of PCBM clusters in the BHJ. In addition, we correlated the cluster area fraction with bimolecular recombination at 100mW/cm2, as quantified by white-light biased external quantum efficiency measurements. Finally, we show that rinsing off residual organics from the ZnO surface after pyrolysis eliminated PCBM cluster formation, avoiding poor organic photovoltaic device performance.

Abstract: Liquid phase crystallization (LPC) using e-beam or CW-laser line sources of amorphous or nanocrystalline silicon films has emerged as new method to form high quality absorbers on cheap substrates. A disadvantage of electron beam crystallization was the necessity to use amorphous SiCx layers in contact with the silicon to maintain a stable crystallization process, resulting in high surface recombination. In this work we investigate capping layers to enable e-beam induced LPC on alternative interlayer materials especially SiO2 and characterize the morphological and electrical properties of these layer stacks. Photoluminescence measurements of LPC absorbers on SiO2 layers exhibit significantly increased radiative recombination compared to SiCx. Fabricated hetero-junction cells achieved a new emitter area efficiency record for electron beam induced LPC solar cells of 9% using the FrontERA contact system and H passivation.

Abstract: This paper reports on the stability of encapsulated ITO-free bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ-OSC) with the layer sequence of Cr/Al/Cr/photoactive layer (PAL)/poly (3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly (styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/metal-grid under different aging conditions. The PAL consisted of poly (3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as donor and (6,6)-phenyl-C60 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as acceptor. Completely flexible devices (encapsulated between two flexible barrier films) were able to maintain >95% of their initial device performance after 1000h of aging under damp heat condition (85°C/85% relative humidity) according to standard IEC 61646. Suns–VOC measurements reveal that there is a slight increase in both the transport resistance of the photoactive layer as well as the series resistance of the PEDOT:PSS electrode. Devices encapsulated between two glass plates were able to retain more than 90% of their initial device performance after ca. 1800h of aging under damp heat condition. Similar devices encapsulated between two glass plates and between a glass plate and flexible barrier film showed almost no degradation after ca. 10,000h under thermal stress of 85°C (dark and ambient air). Further, remarkable stability of more than 12,000h with less than 10% reduction in the device performance was achieved under continuous illumination of 1000W/m2 (similar to AM1.5G spectrum but with lower UV content).

Abstract: Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurement has been performed on Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) absorbers. In this contribution, CIGS films on both rigid soda-lime glass and flexible stainless steel (SUS) substrates are fabricated by the so-called “multi-layer precursor method” consisting of Ga–Se/In–Se/Cu–Se stacks. The TRPL lifetime, demonstrating a positive relationship with PL intensity, exhibits a close correlation with all photovoltaic parameters. According to TRPL and sensitive capacitance measurements, the average band-gap energy (Eg) should be in a range of 1.25–1.30eV, giving rise to sufficiently long TRPL lifetimes. Ultimately, CIGS absorber is fabricated with double graded Eg profile with a proper average Eg of 1.27eV and back-surface field of 0.22V/μm, defined as a ratio of the change in Eg divided by the change in a depth range from 1 to 2μm from CIGS surface. This graded Eg profile results in the improvement of the efficiency of the CIGS solar cell on a flexible SUS substrate up to 16.22% without an anti-reflective layer.

Abstract: Magnesium–yttrium alloy switchable mirrors capped with a Pd layer with a thickness of 7.5nm have been shown to have a high switching durability of over 10,000 cycles between reflective and transparent states. However, the durability decreased considerably when the Pd thickness was decreased to improve the transmittance in the transparent state. Switchable mirrors with a thin Ta intermediate layer inserted between Mg–Y alloy layer and thinner Pd layers were then prepared by a direct-current magnetron sputtering method, and the optical switching durability was studied. Such a mirror capped by a Pd layer with a thickness of 3nm had a high switching durability of over 10,000 cycles, although a mirror without the Ta intermediate layer capped by a Pd layer with the same thickness never changed from the reflective to the transparent state. Owing to the decrease of the Pd thickness from 7.5 to 3nm, the visible transmittance in the transparent state increased, respectively, from 32% to 44% with high switching durability. The results of X-ray photoemission spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy showed that the inserted Ta layer fully inhibits alloying between the Pd and Mg–Y layers, and that the Pd existed at the surface region and scarcely diffused into the Ta and Mg–Y layers even after switching of 10,000 cycles. Because alloying is one of the main reasons for the reduction in durability with decreasing Pd thickness, the prevention of alloying is expected to cause high switching durability.

Abstract: Large defect clusters can represent a serious reduction of the material quality of multicrystalline silicon and the efficiency of the resulting solar cells. It is useful to find the origin of these defect-rich regions in order to understand their formations. For this work, multicrystalline silicon wafers from different positions of a compensated p-type silicon brick were processed to solar cells with a homogeneous emitter and screen-printed metallization. The solar cells from the main part of the brick showed efficiencies between 15.6% and 16.1%. The characterization for this work focuses on the positions of the three largest defect clusters by means of detailed optical, crystal orientation and electrical loss measurements. This allows the localization of the defect clusters' origins during crystallization. The locations where the observed defect clusters started to grow, show similar crystal configurations. This implies that the large clusters formed preferentially at grain boundaries between specific grain orientations. A smaller cluster disappeared at a grain boundary. The characterization showed the same crystal configuration as for the three large growing clusters.

Photocorrosive effects of InxGa1−xN samples in aqueous solutions are revealed and strategies for a more efficient use of these electrodes are discussed. Formation of Ga2O3 phase and N2 under photoanodic conditions can explain the photo-corrosive effect. It is shown that the product of charge carrier density and mobility, n×μ, scales with the photo-current density in GaN.

Abstract: Diamond-Blackfan anemia is an inherited genetic disease caused by mutations in ribosomal protein genes. The disease is characterized by bone marrow failure, congenital anomalies, and a severe erythroid defect. The activation of the TP53 pathway has been suggested to be critical for the pathophysiology of Diamond-Blackfan anemia. While this pathway plays a role in the morphological defects that associate with ribosomal protein loss-of-function in animal models, its role in the erythroid defects has not been clearly established. To understand the specificity of erythroid defects in Diamond-Blackfan anemia, we knocked down five RP genes (two Diamond-Blackfan anemia-associated and three non-Diamond-Blackfan anemia-associated) in zebrafish and analyzed the effects on the developmental and erythroid phenotypes in the presence and absence of Tp53. The co-inhibition of Tp53 activity rescued the morphological deformities but did not alleviate the erythroid aplasia indicating that ribosomal protein deficiency causes erythroid failure in a Tp53-independent manner. Interestingly, treatment with l-Leucine or l-Arginine, amino acids that augment mRNA translation via mTOR pathway, rescued the morphological defects and resulted in a substantial recovery of erythroid cells. Our results suggest that altered translation because of impaired ribosome function could be responsible for the morphological and erythroid defects in ribosomal protein-deficient zebrafish.

Abstract: We propose a cost-effective, mask-free fabrication process for high-density organic photovoltaic (OPV) modules based on oblique vacuum-deposition of small molecules over nozzle-jet printed microstructures. The contact angle of these microstructures is varied through surface modification, enabling them to function selectively either for separation or for passivation. An area utilization ratio as high as 95.6% with respect to a designated illumination area is demonstrated with the proposed method in series-connected OPV modules based on active layers of C70 doped with di-[4-(N,N-ditolyl-amino)-phenyl] cyclohexane (TAPC) molecules.

Abstract: We investigated the evolution of the spectrally resolved absorption coefficients of SiC and SiOx materials as well as of their multilayer systems during thermal annealing and hydrogen passivation, with focus on the nature of optically active defects induced during annealing. We propose that both dangling bonds (paramagnetic defects) and strained bonds (non-paramagnetic defects) formed during annealing contribute to the sub-band gap absorption and that the associated defects can be partially removed by hydrogen reincorporation. The difference in the evolution of the absorption spectra for different sample types upon annealing and passivation are linked to the fundamental difference in their atomic structures. The much lower optical band gap and the significantly higher sub-band gap absorption of SiC single layers in the annealed state as compared to SiOx single layers can be traced back to the lower flexibility of the relatively dense 4-fold coordinated atomic structure of the SiC material.

Abstract: We have fabricated pn-junction devices based on layers of copper–zinc–tin–sulfide, Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) and copper-diffused silver indium disulfide (AgInS2@Cu) ternary nanocrystals. The pn-junctions under an illumination condition have acted as solar cells due to the depletion region which was responsible for separation of charge carriers due to a drift of minority carriers across the junction by the electric field at the junction. From the capacitance–voltage characteristics of the pn-junctions, we have evaluated the width of the depletion region that extended to the two layers separately. This has enabled us to fabricate a device with a predetermined thickness of the p- and the n-type layers so that the device becomes fully-depleted. By forming such a device, we could eliminate the sections of the p- and the n-layers that would otherwise have increased the internal resistance of the solar cells without contributing to short-circuit current.

Abstract: One approach to use solar radiation more effectively in solar cells is to stack, in series, multiple photoactive layers with complementary absorption spectra. Such devices are often termed tandem or multi-junction solar cells. The larger number of different materials and processing steps involved in their making when compared with the single junction solar cell has to be justified and compensated by a higher efficiency. A central question to ask is how much energy you need to invest in a system in order for it to produce energy and return the investment at least once and preferably a number of times. As an initial investigation into the potential viability of the tandem or multi-junction approach we have engaged in a detailed analysis based on the manufacturing energy for each step within the tandem module supply chain for full ambient processing of thin flexible polymer tandem solar cells prepared entirely by roll processing methods. We present a comprehensive overview of relevant research results on how the energy consumption affects the energy balance when using single and multi-junction solar cells. Based on the above question we calculate the minimum efficiency that the tandem or multi-junction should present to determine the minimum energy payback time; that is whether (or when) the increase in materials use and complexity of the tandem architecture is compensated by better performance. After analysing the performance and the consideration of a series of technical improvement opportunities, we project that the tandem solar cell has to be ~20% higher performing than the corresponding single junction solar cell to be warranted. We also highlight that there is a range in the reciprocal EBPT–efficiency relationship where the tandem solar cell is an advantage. Specific to polymer and organic solar cells are however that they embody very little energy and this implies that the single junction may be an advantage, especially in cases where land mass is not critical.

Abstract: All solution processed depleted bulk heterojunction (DBH) solar cell devices based on near infrared (NIR) PbS/CdS core–shell quantum dots (QDs) and films of rutile TiO2 nanorod arrays have been investigated. The device fabrication was achieved through the layer-by-layer spin coating of PbS/CdS QDs, in ambient atmosphere, onto hydrothermally grown TiO2 nanorod arrays film leading to the general device architecture consisting of fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO)/TiO2/QDs/interfacial layer/Au. The performance of these devices fabricated under different processing conditions was tested and compared with that of similar devices where the PbS/CdS QDs were replaced by a spin-coated layer of colloidal PbS QDs (processed under inert atmosphere). It was found that the maximum power conversion efficiency of the former devices is about 40% higher when MoO3 was used as an interfacial layer (2.02%±0.15 vs 1.40%±0.11). The stability and ease of processing in air together with the higher performance of the PbS/CdS core–shell QDs, as compared to the PbS QDs, strongly suggest their high potential in solar cell applications. This work represents the first demonstration of the use of NIR PbS/CdS core–shell QDs in solar cells.

Abstract: We investigate the photostability of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cell active layers comprised of the archetype donor, boron-subphthalocyanine chloride (SubPc), and fullerene acceptors, aged under either AM1.5G illumination or in the dark, and in either air or inert atmosphere. Under long-term exposure to light, we observe significant photobleaching and crystallization of SubPc. Mixing SubPc with C60 as is commonly done in high efficiency small molecule OPVs, the crystallite formation is inhibited and the bleaching is suppressed due to a significantly reduced exciton lifetime in the blends. Furthermore, the spectral dependence of the degradation suggests that photo-dimerization of C60 is an important factor leading to burn-in loss in efficiency previously reported in SubPc/C60 OPVs. The existence of dimerization is supported by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy data taken both before and after exposure to light. Increasing the fraction of SubPc in a SubPc:C60 blend leads to a decrease in the rate of film degradation, providing further evidence for C60 dimerization. Due to its reduced tendency for photo-dimerization, C70 is more stable than C60 when used in small molecule OPVs.

Abstract: Indium was efficiently recovered from color filter (CF) glass in LCD panel wastes using sub-critical water, which is only harmless water, at various temperatures and reaction time. By treatment in just 5min reaction time using sub-critical water, this work achieved an outstanding 83% indium oxide recovery from CF glass and 7% from TFT glass at 360°C. Clean and quality glass was also simultaneously recovered from CF glass. Higher exfoliation of organic multi-layers attached together with indium oxide and tin oxide was obtained over CF glass than that over TFT glass. Furthermore, indium did not dissolve in the liquid-phase but existed as indium oxide attached with the organic multilayers that were removed from CF glass. Since indium oxide was readily separated from CF glass, it was easily recovered from the liquid-phase by filtration. The amount of indium recovered was dependent on the sub-critical water reaction temperature. Sub-CW treatment at 5min reaction time resulted in the highest indium recovery from CF glass. Thus, it was proven that sub-critical water treatment was a promising method for indium recovery from CF glass in LCD wastes.

Abstract: Switchable mirrors are promising materials for energy-saving windows. They are switched between their reflective and transparent states by hydrogenation and dehydrogenation. We have developed gasochromic and electrochromic (EC) switchable mirrors which contain a ternary Mg–Zr–Ni alloy instead of a binary Mg-based alloy, such as Mg–Ni, Mg–Ti, or Mg–Ca. The additional elements in the Mg alloys improve the optical switching properties, and hydrogen-permeable Zr–Ni alloy membranes do not become embrittled by hydrogen and have a high hydrogen permeation rate. Both types of switchable mirror with the Mg–Zr–Ni thin film exhibited optical switching properties, which depended strongly on the composition of the thin film. In both the gasochromic and EC mirrors the switching speed increased as the zirconium and nickel content of the film was increased, although the maximum transmittance decreased. The environmental durability of the EC mirror was investigated using a thermostat/humidistat bath. The durability increased with the zirconium and nickel content of the alloy thin film, and films with a high magnesium content degraded more rapidly.

Abstract: We summarize an extensive study on the impact of absorber layer defect density on the performance of amorphous (a-Si:H) and microcrystalline (μc-Si:H) silicon solar cells. To study the effects of the absorber layer defect density we subjected set of a-Si:H and μc-Si:H cells to a 2MeV electron bombardment. Subsequently the cells were stepwise annealed to vary the defect density. The cells have varying thicknesses and are illuminated from either the p- or n-side. For reference we subjected i-layers to the same treatment as the cells. The procedure enabled the reversible increase of the i-layer defect density (NS) with two orders of magnitude according to electron spin resonance measurements (ESR) performed on reference samples. The large variation of NS induces substantial changes in the current–voltage characteristics (J–V) and the external quantum efficiency spectra (EQE). These changes in device characteristics provide a solid reference for analysis and device simulations. It was found that performance of a-Si:H cells degraded weakly upon NS increase up to 1017cm−3 and dropped steeply as defect density was increased further. In contrast, performance of µc-Si:H cells showed continuous reduction as NS raised. By comparing p- and n-side illuminated cells we found that, for NS above 1017cm−3, the p-side illuminated a-Si:H cells outperformed the n-side illuminated ones, however, the difference was barely visible at NS below 1017cm−3. On the contrary, the device performance of n-side illuminated µc-Si:H cells was much more affected by the increase in defect density, as compared to the p-side illuminated cells. EQE results evidenced a significant asymmetry in collection of electrons and holes in µc-Si:H devices, where carrier collection was limited by holes as defect density was increased. Based on the experimental data we speculate that the improvement of absorber material in terms of as-deposited defect density is not of primary importance for the performance of a-Si:H cells, whereas in μc-Si:H based solar cells, the reduction of the absorber layer defect density below the state-of-the-art levels, seems to improve the cell performance.

Abstract: The GTPase-dependent polymerization/depolymerization dynamics of FtsZ regulate bacterial cell division in vivo. Deinococcus radiodurans is better known for its extraordinary radioresistance and therefore, the characterization of FtsZ of this bacterium (FtsZDr) would be required to understand the mechanisms underlying regulation of cell division in response to DNA damage. Recombinant FtsZDr bound to GTP and showed GTPase activity. It produced bundles of protofilaments in the presence of either GTP or Mg2+ ions. But the formation of the higher size ordered structures required both GTP and Mg2+ in vitro. It showed polymerization/depolymerization dynamics as a function of GTP and Mg2+. Interestingly, ATP interacted with FtsZDr and stimulated its GTPase activity by ∼2-fold possibly by increasing both substrate affinity and rate of reaction. FtsZDr-GFP expressing in D. radiodurans produced typical Z ring perpendicular to the plane of first cell division. These results suggested that FtsZDr is a GTPase in vitro and produces typical Z ring at the mid cell position in D. radiodurans.

Abstract: A method for preparing a novel bixbyite non-selective coating for solar thermal conversion is described. The coating is formed by a thermal reaction between a titania sol–gel precursor with a copper manganese spinel to form a new material, Cu0.44Ti0.44Mn0.84Fe0.28O3, with a bixbyite structure. The effect of temperature and ratio between the two components on the formation of the bixbyite layer (deposited on Inconel by spray-coating) was studied. The absorptance of the films (AM 1.5; 335–2500nm) with a thickness of 10±2µm after annealing at 2h at 650°C and 750°C was 97.4% and 94.7%, respectively. This synthesis represents a novel approach in which the final solar thermal coating is formed as a continuous and uniform layer which combines both the absorber and the ceramic binder. The developed material shows promising results for future applications as absorber in solar thermal energy conversion.

Abstract: Glioblastomas are lethal tumors characterized by malignant proliferation and recurrence promoted partly by glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). GSCs are known to be regulated by hypoxia, but the mechanisms involved in this regulation are not fully understood. We now demonstrate that hypoxia-inducible factor HIF2α and prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) are preferentially expressed in hypoxic GSCs in comparison with non-stem tumor cells and normal neural stem cells and that PAP is regulated by HIF2α. Targeting PAP in hypoxic GSCs inhibits self-renewal and proliferation in vitro and attenuates tumor initiation potential of GSCs in vivo. Using specific adenosine receptor antagonists, we further find that the pro-proliferative role of PAP is stemmed from stimulated A2B adenosine receptors. Moreover, selective blockage of A2B receptor or knockdown of PAP or A2B on hypoxic GSCs results in significant reduction of phosphorylation of Akt and Erk-1/2. Our results demonstrate that PAP may play a pro-proliferative role in hypoxic GSCs with a HIF2α-induction pattern, which may be ascribed to stimulated A2B receptors and activated Akt and Erk-1/2 pathways. Therefore, we propose that these identified molecular regulators of GSCs in the hypoxic niche might represent promising targets for antiglioblastoma therapies.

Abstract: In this paper we present detailed balance simulations which determine the material parameters required to produce hot carrier solar cell (HCSC) annual energy yields comparable with that of multi-junction (MJ) systems. We demonstrate that HCSCs are less spectrally sensitive than equivalent MJ devices providing significant motivation for pursuing their development. Spectral variation in a given location over the course of the day and throughout the year means that the HCSC provides more consistent power production. The HCSC can also be developed for a standard reference spectrum and still perform optimally in a variety of locations with different atmospheric conditions, unlike the location sensitive performance of MJ devices. We show that an ideal hot carrier solar cell with bandgap 0.69eV under 2000× concentration would require a thermalization coefficient <0.1WK−1cm−2 to produce more power over the course of the year than an InGaP/GaAs/Ge triple junction device located at Solar Village in Saudi Arabia. The lowest experimentally demonstrated thermalization coefficient is 9.5WK−1cm−2 indicating that further materials development is required to achieve this target.

Abstract: Porous thin films of Ir oxide were prepared by reactive dc magnetron sputtering onto unheated substrates. The crystallite size was ~5nm, and a small amount of unoxidized Ir was present. The electrochromic performance was studied by optical transmittance measurements and cyclic voltammetry applied to films in aqueous and non-aqueous electrolytes, specifically being 1M propionic acid, 1M potassium hydroxide (KOH), and 1M lithium perchlorate in propylene carbonate (Li–PC). Cyclic voltammetry measurements indicated that the films had a fractal surface structure. Good electrochromism, with mid-luminous transmittance modulation between ~55 and ~90% in ~100-nm-thick films, was documented in all of the electrolytes.

Abstract: Polymer solar cells (PSCs) with different anode buffer layers were fabricated to investigate dipole-assisted hole extraction on the performance improvement of PSCs. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs was increased from 4.77% to 6.18% with 29.6% improvement due to the increased short circuit current density (Jsc) from 12.00 to 15.65mA/cm2 induced by the oriented LiF dipole-assisted hole extraction. More hole could be swept-out from the active layers by oriented LiF dipole/PEDOT:PSS combined anode buffer layers. The dipole-assisted hole extraction could be further demonstrated from the J–V curves of hole-only devices with different anode buffer layers.

Abstract: We have systematically investigated the gallium grading in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cells grown on glass at low substrate temperature by a number of techniques including X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy X-ray dispersive spectrometry, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The results reveal that the performance of the CIGS solar cells deposited at low substrate temperature strongly depends on the gallium grading and the micro-structures of the thin films. By modifying the conventional three-stage co-evaporation process from elemental sources, in particular in the first and third stage for CIGS growth to reduce Ga grading, it has been shown that fabrication of CIGS solar cells at low substrate temperature with efficiency comparable to that at high temperature is achievable. To optimize the device efficiency, the gallium grading in the (InGa)2Se3 precursor grown in the first stage and the Ga content in the third stage are required to be carefully designed to match the employed substrate temperature.

Abstract: A new cathodically coloring electrochromic material based on metallo-supramolecular polyelectrolyte containing Cu(I) metal ion (MEPE-Cu(I)) has been synthesized and studied. The electrochromic mechanism for MEPE series involves the redox reaction of Cu(I)/Cu(II) pair and metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT). Both would drive MEPEs to change color upon the passage of a small reaction charge. The transmittance change (ΔT) of a MEPE-Cu(I) thin film at 580nm reaches ca. 20.0% when switching the potential between 0.0 and +1.5V (vs. Ag/Ag+). A fast response time of less than 1s and a coloration efficiency value of 260cm2/C at 580nm are recorded. To fabricate MEPEs-based electrochromic device (ECD), polyaniline-carbon nanotube (PANI-CNT) was chosen to act as the ionic storage layer for MEPE-Cu(I). A liquid electrolyte containing 0.1M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP) in acetonitrile (ACN) with 1.0mM HClO4 has been used in the ECD. By switching the potential between 0.0 and −1.5V (PANI-CNT vs. MEPE-Cu(I)), the ECD behaves as a MEPE-Cu(I) thin film device with a similar ΔT value of about 20% at 580nm, but with a faster response time of less than 0.5s, presumably due to the presence of PANI-CNT. It remains 99% of the initial ΔT after 1500 cycles with good long-term stability.

Abstract: An in situ vapor deposition process has been used to create a photochromic, tungsten-oxide, polymer matrix nanocomposite. Under specific processing conditions, the composite consists of discrete tungsten-oxide nanoparticles distributed uniformly throughout the bulk of an optically transparent fluoropolymer matrix. Ultraviolet exposure of the nanocomposite produces characteristic photochromic changes that result in a 40% change in optical transmission. Optical absorption measurements yield a value of 3.08eV for the bandgap of the tungsten-oxide particles. Incorporating oxygen as a supplementary deposition agent in the synthesis process increased the transparency of the films in the visible region, increased the change in transmission due to the photochromic effect, and led to the percolation of larger nanoparticles near the film surface. Growth of particles in this region allowed the nanocomposite to be bleached readily in an oxygen atmosphere while retaining photochromic activity.

Abstract: We report our observation of simultaneous enhancement in large-area coatability and photovoltaic performance for blade-coated inverted P3HT:PCBM organic solar cells with DCB:hexane co-solvent. The addition of hexane improves greatly the wettability of P3HT:PCBM blend layer on Cs2CO3 treated ITO and leads to excessively higher P3HT surface concentration due to the incongruent evaporation of hexane and DCB. A post-processing light soaking was found to further improve the photovoltaic performance for blade-coated devices prepared with co-solvent by adjusting the P3HT surface concentration ratio for more favorable carrier transport, as evidenced by the disappearance of current suppression at forward bias and significant increase in Voc after light soaking. Since large-area manufacturing is the key to full commercialization of organic solar cells, the use of co-solvent, combined with light soaking, may be crucial for the development of inverted organic solar cells.

Abstract: The particle size distributions of three commercially available titanium dioxide pigments were measured, and their effects on the optical properties of the pigments were investigated. The Altiris 550 and 800 pigments possess larger median particle size and wider size distributions than those of the conventional titanium dioxide rutile. The visible (VIS) reflectance, the solar reflectance and the lightness of the films and coatings singly pigmented with any of these three pigments decrease as the pigment particle size increases. The VIS transmittance and near-infrared (NIR) reflectance both increase as the pigment particle size increases. The main reflection band of the coatings shifts farther into the NIR region with increasing pigment particle size. The partially VIS-transmitting Altiris pigments enable the NIR and the solar reflectance of cool non-white coatings to be improved, thereby yielding metameric matches to the desired colors.

Abstract: A facile, solution-processed method to fabricate MoO3 (s-MoO3) thin film as hole-injection layer (HIL) for poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and (6,6)-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) based organic bulk hetero-junction photovoltaics is presented. The structural, electronic property and surface microstructure of the s-MoO3 thin film are investigated in detail by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscope. The results indicate that the s-MoO3 thin film possesses appropriate morphological, optical and electronic properties to be suitable for organic photovoltaic applications. The photovoltaic devices have been investigated and optimized in detail by tuning layer thickness, processing temperature and time, annealing conditions of interfacial layers. Using s-MoO3 thin film as hole-injection layer, the device gives open circuit voltage of 0.64V, circuit current density of 9.15mAcm−2, fill factor of 0.67 and power conversion efficiency of 3.92%, which is higher than the controlled device using PEDOT:PSS layer. In addition, the s-MoO3 based devices exhibit good stability.
