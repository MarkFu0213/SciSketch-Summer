Abstract: Aminoglycoside antibiotics are widely employed clinically due to their powerful bactericidal activities, less bacterial resistance compared to beta lactam group and low cost. However, their use has been limited in recent years due to their potential induction of nephrotoxicity. Here we investigate the possibility of reversing nephrotoxicity caused by gentamicin in rat models by using ethanolic crude extract of the medicinal plant Jatropha Mollissima. Nephrotoxic male Wistar rats was obtained by gentamicin antibiotic, which then treated with two doses of J. mollissima crude extract for 3 weeks with monitoring their parameter in weekly base. Our results indicate that J. mollissima crude extract at both doses has strong protection ability against gentamicin nephrotoxicity, most of tested parameters backed to normal values after few days from the administration of the crude extract, which could be due to the antagonized the biochemical action of gentamicin on the proximal tubules of the kidney. The results of histopathologic analysis showed observable improvement in J. mollissima treated groups compared with untreated groups. Our findings suggests the J. mollissima has exceptional nephron protection potentials able to reverse the nephrotoxicity caused by gentamicin antibiotic.

Abstract: Summary
Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder characterized by lipid accumulation in endolysosomes. An early pathologic hallmark is axonal dystrophy occurring at presymptomatic stages in NPC mice. However, the mechanisms underlying this pathologic change remain obscure. Here, we demonstrate that endocytic-autophagic organelles accumulate in NPC dystrophic axons. Using super-resolution and live-neuron imaging, we reveal that elevated cholesterol on NPC lysosome membranes sequesters kinesin-1 and Arl8 independent of SKIP and Arl8-GTPase activity, resulting in impaired lysosome transport into axons, contributing to axonal autophagosome accumulation. Pharmacologic reduction of lysosomal membrane cholesterol with 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPCD) or elevated Arl8b expression rescues lysosome transport, thereby reducing axonal autophagic stress and neuron death in NPC. These findings demonstrate a pathological mechanism by which altered membrane lipid composition impairs lysosome delivery into axons and provide biological insights into the translational application of HPCD in restoring axonal homeostasis at early stages of NPC disease.

Abstract: Summary
Even though SYK and ZAP70 kinases share high sequence homology and serve analogous functions, their expression in B and T cells is strictly segregated throughout evolution. Here, we identified aberrant ZAP70 expression as a common feature in a broad range of B cell malignancies. We validated SYK as the kinase that sets the thresholds for negative selection of autoreactive and premalignant clones. When aberrantly expressed in B cells, ZAP70 competes with SYK at the BCR signalosome and redirects SYK from negative selection to tonic PI3K signaling, thereby promoting B cell survival. In genetic mouse models for B-ALL and B-CLL, conditional expression of Zap70 accelerated disease onset, while genetic deletion impaired malignant transformation. Inducible activation of Zap70 during B cell development compromised negative selection of autoreactive B cells, resulting in pervasive autoantibody production. Strict segregation of the two kinases is critical for normal B cell selection and represents a central safeguard against the development of autoimmune disease and B cell malignancies.

Abstract: Summary
Circulating polymers of α1-antitrypsin (α1AT) are neutrophil chemo-attractants and contribute to inflammation, yet cellular factors affecting their secretion remain obscure. We report on a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen for genes affecting trafficking of polymerogenic α1ATH334D. A CRISPR enrichment approach based on recovery of single guide RNA (sgRNA) sequences from phenotypically selected fixed cells reveals that cells with high-polymer content are enriched in sgRNAs targeting genes involved in “cargo loading into COPII-coated vesicles,” where “COPII” is coat protein II, including the cargo receptors lectin mannose binding1 (LMAN1) and surfeit protein locus 4 (SURF4). LMAN1- and SURF4-disrupted cells display a secretion defect extending beyond α1AT monomers to polymers. Polymer secretion is especially dependent on SURF4 and correlates with a SURF4-α1ATH334D physical interaction and with their co-localization at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These findings indicate that ER cargo receptors co-ordinate progression of α1AT out of the ER and modulate the accumulation of polymeric α1AT not only by controlling the concentration of precursor monomers but also by promoting secretion of polymers.

Abstract: Summary
T lymphocyte differentiation in the steady state is characterized by high cellular turnover whereby thymocytes do not self-renew. However, if deprived of competent progenitors, the thymus can temporarily maintain thymopoiesis autonomously. This bears a heavy cost, because prolongation of thymus autonomy causes leukemia. Here, we show that, at an early stage, thymus autonomy relies on double-negative 3 early (DN3e) thymocytes that acquire stem-cell-like properties. Following competent progenitor deprivation, DN3e thymocytes become long lived, are required for thymus autonomy, differentiate in vivo, and include DNA-label-retaining cells. At the single-cell level, the transcriptional programs of thymopoiesis in autonomy and the steady state are similar. However, a new cell population emerges in autonomy that expresses an aberrant Notch target gene signature and bypasses the β-selection checkpoint. In summary, DN3e thymocytes have the potential to self-renew and differentiate in vivo if cell competition is impaired, but this generates atypical cells, probably the precursors of leukemia.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the epigenomic evolution and specificity of disease subtypes from complex patient data remains a major biomedical problem. We here present DeCET (decomposition and classification of epigenomic tensors), an integrative computational approach for simultaneously analyzing hierarchical heterogeneous data, to identify robust epigenomic differences among tissue types, differentiation states, and disease subtypes. Applying DeCET to our own data from 21 uterine benign tumor (leiomyoma) patients identifies distinct epigenomic features discriminating normal myometrium and leiomyoma subtypes. Leiomyomas possess preponderant alterations in distal enhancers and long-range histone modifications confined to chromatin contact domains that constrain the evolution of pathological epigenomes. Moreover, we demonstrate the power and advantage of DeCET on multiple publicly available epigenomic datasets representing different cancers and cellular states. Epigenomic features extracted by DeCET can thus help improve our understanding of disease states, cellular development, and differentiation, thereby facilitating future therapeutic, diagnostic, and prognostic strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Microglia, brain-resident macrophages, require instruction from the CNS microenvironment to maintain their identity and morphology and regulate inflammatory responses, although what mediates this is unclear. Here, we show that neurons and astrocytes cooperate to promote microglial ramification, induce expression of microglial signature genes ordinarily lost in vitro and in age and disease in vivo, and repress infection- and injury-associated gene sets. The influence of neurons and astrocytes separately on microglia is weak, indicative of synergies between these cell types, which exert their effects via a mechanism involving transforming growth factor β2 (TGF-β2) signaling. Neurons and astrocytes also combine to provide immunomodulatory cues, repressing primed microglial responses to weak inflammatory stimuli (without affecting maximal responses) and consequently limiting the feedback effects of inflammation on the neurons and astrocytes themselves. These findings explain why microglia isolated ex vivo undergo de-differentiation and inflammatory deregulation and point to how disease- and age-associated changes may be counteracted.

Abstract: Summary
Organismal stressors such as cold exposure require a systemic response to maintain body temperature. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a key thermogenic tissue in mammals that protects against hypothermia in response to cold exposure. Defining the complex interplay of multiple organ systems in this response is fundamental to our understanding of adipose tissue thermogenesis. In this study, we identify a role for hepatic insulin signaling via AKT in the adaptive response to cold stress and show that liver AKT is an essential cell-nonautonomous regulator of adipocyte lipolysis and BAT function. Mechanistically, inhibition of forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) by AKT controls BAT thermogenesis by enhancing catecholamine-induced lipolysis in the white adipose tissue (WAT) and increasing circulating fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21). Our data identify a role for hepatic insulin signaling via the AKT-FOXO1 axis in regulating WAT lipolysis, promoting BAT thermogenic capacity, and ensuring a proper thermogenic response to acute cold exposure.

Abstract: Summary
Toll-like receptors are essential for animal development and survival, with conserved roles in innate immunity, tissue patterning, and cell behavior. The mechanisms by which Toll receptors signal to the nucleus are well characterized, but how Toll receptors generate rapid, localized signals at the cell membrane to produce acute changes in cell polarity and behavior is not known. We show that Drosophila Toll receptors direct epithelial convergent extension by inducing planar-polarized patterns of Src and PI3-kinase (PI3K) activity. Toll receptors target Src activity to specific sites at the membrane, and Src recruits PI3K to the Toll-2 complex through tyrosine phosphorylation of the Toll-2 cytoplasmic domain. Reducing Src or PI3K activity disrupts planar-polarized myosin assembly, cell intercalation, and convergent extension, whereas constitutive Src activity promotes ectopic PI3K and myosin cortical localization. These results demonstrate that Toll receptors direct cell polarity and behavior by locally mobilizing Src and PI3K activity.

Abstract: Summary
Somatodendritic dopamine (DA) release from midbrain DA neurons activates D2 autoreceptors on these cells to regulate their activity. However, the source of autoregulatory DA remains controversial. Here, we test the hypothesis that D2 autoreceptors on a given DA neuron in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) are activated primarily by DA released from that same cell, rather than from its neighbors. Voltage-clamp recording allows monitoring of evoked D2-receptor-mediated inhibitory currents (D2ICs) in SNc DA neurons as an index of DA release. Single-cell application of antibodies to Na+ channels via the recording pipette decreases spontaneous activity of recorded neurons and attenuates evoked D2ICs; antibodies to SNAP-25, a soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) protein, also decrease D2IC amplitude. Evoked D2ICs are nearly abolished by the light chain of botulinum neurotoxin A, which cleaves SNAP-25, whereas synaptically activated GABAB-receptor-mediated currents are unaffected. Thus, somatodendritic DA release in the SNc autoinhibits the neuron that releases it.

Abstract: Summary
Tonic inhibition mediated by extrasynaptic γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAARs) critically regulates neuronal excitability and brain function. However, the mechanisms regulating tonic inhibition remain poorly understood. Here, we report that Shisa7 is critical for tonic inhibition regulation in hippocampal neurons. In juvenile Shisa7 knockout (KO) mice, α5-GABAAR-mediated tonic currents are significantly reduced. Mechanistically, Shisa7 is crucial for α5-GABAAR exocytosis. Additionally, Shisa7 regulation of tonic inhibition requires protein kinase A (PKA) that phosphorylates Shisa7 serine 405 (S405). Importantly, tonic inhibition undergoes activity-dependent regulation, and Shisa7 is required for homeostatic potentiation of tonic inhibition. Interestingly, in young adult Shisa7 KOs, basal tonic inhibition in hippocampal neurons is unaltered, largely due to the diminished α5-GABAAR component of tonic inhibition. However, at this stage, tonic inhibition oscillates during the daily sleep/wake cycle, a process requiring Shisa7. Together, these data demonstrate that intricate signaling mechanisms regulate tonic inhibition at different developmental stages and reveal a molecular link between sleep and tonic inhibition.

Abstract: Summary
Small RNA pathways defend the germlines of animals against selfish genetic elements, yet pathway activities need to be contained to prevent silencing of self genes. Here, we reveal a proteolytic mechanism that controls endogenous small interfering (22G) RNA activity in the Caenorhabditis elegans germline to protect genome integrity and maintain fertility. We find that DPF-3, a P-granule-localized N-terminal dipeptidase orthologous to mammalian dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP) 8/9, processes the unusually proline-rich N termini of WAGO-1 and WAGO-3 Argonaute (Ago) proteins. Without DPF-3 activity, these WAGO proteins lose their proper complement of 22G RNAs. Desilencing of repeat-containing and transposon-derived transcripts, DNA damage, and acute sterility ensue. These phenotypes are recapitulated when WAGO-1 and WAGO-3 are rendered resistant to DPF-3-mediated processing, identifying them as critical substrates of DPF-3. We conclude that N-terminal processing of Ago proteins regulates their activity and promotes silencing of selfish genetic elements by ensuring Ago association with appropriate small RNAs.

Abstract: Summary
Synapse loss and altered synaptic strength are thought to underlie cognitive impairment in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) by disrupting neural activity essential for memory. While synaptic dysfunction in AD has been well characterized in anesthetized animals and in vitro, it remains unknown how synaptic transmission is altered during behavior. By measuring synaptic efficacy as mice navigate in a virtual reality task, we find deficits in interneuron connection strength onto pyramidal cells in hippocampal CA1 in the 5XFAD mouse model of AD. These inhibitory synaptic deficits are most pronounced during sharp-wave ripples, network oscillations important for memory that require inhibition. Indeed, 5XFAD mice exhibit fewer and shorter sharp-wave ripples with impaired place cell reactivation. By showing inhibitory synaptic dysfunction in 5XFAD mice during spatial navigation behavior and suggesting a synaptic mechanism underlying deficits in network activity essential for memory, this work bridges the gap between synaptic and neural activity deficits in AD.

Abstract: Summary
X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is a dosage compensation mechanism in female mammals whereby transcription from one X chromosome is repressed. Analysis of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from female donors identified that low levels of XIST RNA correlated strongly with erosion of XCI. Proteomic analysis, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and polysome profiling showed that XCI erosion resulted in amplified RNA and protein expression from X-linked genes, providing a proteomic characterization of skewed dosage compensation. Increased protein expression was also detected from autosomal genes without an mRNA increase, thus altering the protein-RNA correlation between the X chromosome and autosomes. XCI-eroded lines display an ∼13% increase in total cell protein content, with increased ribosomal proteins, ribosome biogenesis and translation factors, and polysome levels. We conclude that XCI erosion in iPSCs causes a remodeling of the proteome, affecting the expression of a much wider range of proteins and disease-linked loci than previously realized.

Abstract: Summary
Plant-nectar-derived sugar is the major energy source for mosquitoes, but its influence on vector competence for malaria parasites remains unclear. Here, we show that Plasmodium berghei infection of Anopheles stephensi results in global metabolome changes, with the most significant impact on glucose metabolism. Feeding on glucose or trehalose (the main hemolymph sugars) renders the mosquito more susceptible to Plasmodium infection by alkalizing the mosquito midgut. The glucose/trehalose diets promote proliferation of a commensal bacterium, Asaia bogorensis, that remodels glucose metabolism in a way that increases midgut pH, thereby promoting Plasmodium gametogenesis. We also demonstrate that the sugar composition from different natural plant nectars influences A. bogorensis growth, resulting in a greater permissiveness to Plasmodium. Altogether, our results demonstrate that dietary glucose is an important determinant of mosquito vector competency for Plasmodium, further highlighting a key role for mosquito-microbiota interactions in regulating the development of the malaria parasite.

Abstract: Summary
Pathological lipid accumulation is often associated with enhanced uptake of free fatty acids via specific transporters in cardiomyocytes. Here, we identify SIRT6 as a critical transcriptional regulator of fatty acid transporters in cardiomyocytes. We find that SIRT6 deficiency enhances the expression of fatty acid transporters, leading to enhanced fatty acid uptake and lipid accumulation. Interestingly, the haploinsufficiency of SIRT6 is sufficient to induce the expression of fatty acid transporters and cause lipid accumulation in murine hearts. Mechanistically, SIRT6 depletion enhances the occupancy of the transcription factor PPARγ on the promoters of critical fatty acid transporters without modulating the acetylation of histone 3 at Lys 9 and Lys 56. Notably, the binding of SIRT6 to the DNA-binding domain of PPARγ is critical for regulating the expression of fatty acid transporters in cardiomyocytes. Our data suggest exploiting SIRT6 as a potential therapeutic target for protecting the heart from metabolic diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Neuropathological and experimental evidence suggests that the cell-to-cell transfer of α-synuclein has an important role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is not fully understood. We undertook a small interfering RNA (siRNA), genome-wide screen to identify genes regulating the cell-to-cell transfer of α-synuclein. A genetically encoded reporter, GFP-2A-αSynuclein-RFP, suitable for separating donor and recipient cells, was transiently transfected into HEK cells stably overexpressing α-synuclein. We find that 38 genes regulate the transfer of α-synuclein-RFP, one of which is ITGA8, a candidate gene identified through a recent PD genome-wide association study (GWAS). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and weighted protein-protein network interaction analysis (WPPNIA) show that those hits cluster in networks that include known PD genes more frequently than expected by random chance. The findings expand our understanding of the mechanism of α-synuclein spread.

Abstract: Dermal fibroblasts are a promising candidate for cellular-based therapies for thermal wound healing because of their capacity of producing extracellular matrix (ECM), promoting wound contraction and the synthesis of type I collagen, and secreting growth factors. miRNAs (MicroRNAs) might mediate the role of TGF-β1(Transforming Growth Factor-beta 1), one of the major profibrotic cytokines, in improving thermal injury repair. In the present study, we observed the abnormal downregulation of TGF-β1 following thermal injury in the burnt dermis (in vivo) and heat-stimulated human dermal fibroblasts (in vitro). TGF-β1 overexpression reversed heat stimulation-induced repression on fibroblast viability, migration, and ECM synthesis. As demonstrated by online tool prediction and experimental analysis, miR-506-3p downregulated TGF-β1 levels via directly targeting TGFB1. In heat-stimulated human dermal fibroblasts, miR-506-3p expression showed to be significantly upregulated. miR-506-3p inhibition also reversed heat stimulation-induced repression on fibroblast viability, migration, and ECM synthesis; more importantly, TGF-β1 silencing aggravated the thermal injury in vitro and significantly reversed the effects of miR-506-3p inhibition on heat-stimulated dermal fibroblasts. In conclusion, miR-506-3p and its downstream target TGF-β1 form a regulatory axis, modulating the cell viability, migration, and ECM synthesis in human dermal fibroblasts following burn injury.

Abstract: Summary
Incompletely synthesized nascent chains obstructing large ribosomal subunits are targeted for degradation by ribosome-associated quality control (RQC). In bacterial RQC, RqcH marks the nascent chains with C-terminal alanine (Ala) tails that are directly recognized by proteasome-like proteases, whereas in eukaryotes, RqcH orthologs (Rqc2/NEMF [nuclear export mediator factor]) assist the Ltn1/Listerin E3 ligase in nascent chain ubiquitylation. Here, we study RQC-mediated proteolytic targeting of ribosome stalling products in mammalian cells. We show that mammalian NEMF has an additional, Listerin-independent proteolytic role, which, as in bacteria, is mediated by tRNA-Ala binding and Ala tailing. However, in mammalian cells Ala tails signal proteolysis indirectly, through a pathway that recognizes C-terminal degrons; we identify the CRL2KLHDC10 E3 ligase complex and the novel C-end rule E3, Pirh2/Rchy1, as bona fide RQC pathway components that directly bind to Ala-tailed ribosome stalling products and target them for degradation. As Listerin mutation causes neurodegeneration in mice, functionally redundant E3s may likewise be implicated in molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Accumulation of topological stress in the form of DNA supercoiling is inherent to the advance of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and needs to be resolved by DNA topoisomerases to sustain productive transcriptional elongation. Topoisomerases are therefore considered positive facilitators of transcription. Here, we show that, in contrast to this general assumption, human topoisomerase IIα (TOP2A) activity at promoters represses transcription of immediate early genes such as c-FOS, maintaining them under basal repressed conditions. Thus, TOP2A inhibition creates a particular topological context that results in rapid release from promoter-proximal pausing and transcriptional upregulation, which mimics the typical bursting behavior of these genes in response to physiological stimulus. We therefore describe the control of promoter-proximal pausing by TOP2A as a layer for the regulation of gene expression, which can act as a molecular switch to rapidly activate transcription, possibly by regulating the accumulation of DNA supercoiling at promoter regions.

Abstract: Summary
Repair pathway “choice” at stalled mammalian replication forks is an important determinant of genome stability; however, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. FANCM encodes a multi-domain scaffolding and motor protein that interacts with several distinct repair protein complexes at stalled forks. Here, we use defined mutations engineered within endogenous Fancm in mouse embryonic stem cells to study how Fancm regulates stalled fork repair. We find that distinct FANCM repair functions are enacted by molecularly separable scaffolding domains. These findings define FANCM as a key mediator of repair pathway choice at stalled replication forks and reveal its molecular mechanism. Notably, mutations that inactivate FANCM ATPase function disable all its repair functions and “trap” FANCM at stalled forks. We find that Brca1 hypomorphic mutants are synthetic lethal with Fancm null or Fancm ATPase-defective mutants. The ATPase function of FANCM may therefore represent a promising “druggable” target for therapy of BRCA1-linked cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Fascin protein is the main actin-bundling protein in filopodia and invadopodia, which are critical for tumor cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. Small-molecule fascin inhibitors block tumor invasion and metastasis and increase the overall survival of tumor-bearing mice. Here, we report a finding that fascin blockade additionally reinvigorates anti-tumor immune response in syngeneic mouse models of various cancers. Fascin protein levels are increased in conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) in the tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, fascin inhibitor NP-G2-044 increases the number of intratumoral-activated cDCs and enhances the antigen uptake by cDCs. Furthermore, together with PD-1 blocking antibody, NP-G2-044 markedly increases the number of activated CD8+ T cells in the otherwise anti-PD-1 refractory tumors. Reduction of fascin levels in cDCs, but not fascin gene knockout in tumor cells, mimics the anti-tumor immune effect of NP-G2-044. These data demonstrate that fascin inhibitor NP-G2-044 simultaneously limits tumor metastasis and reinvigorates anti-tumor immune responses.

Abstract: Summary
Organismal homeostasis of the essential ion K+ requires sensing of its availability, efficient uptake, and defined distribution. Understanding plant K+ nutrition is essential to advance sustainable agriculture, but the mechanisms underlying K+ sensing and the orchestration of downstream responses have remained largely elusive. Here, we report where plants sense K+ deprivation and how this translates into spatially defined ROS signals to govern specific downstream responses. We define the organ-scale K+ pattern of roots and identify a postmeristematic K+-sensing niche (KSN) where rapid K+ decline and Ca2+ signals coincide. Moreover, we outline a bifurcating low-K+-signaling axis of CIF peptide-activated SGN3-LKS4/SGN1 receptor complexes that convey low-K+-triggered phosphorylation of the NADPH oxidases RBOHC, RBOHD, and RBOHF. The resulting ROS signals simultaneously convey HAK5 K+ uptake-transporter induction and accelerated Casparian strip maturation. Collectively, these mechanisms synchronize developmental differentiation and transcriptome reprogramming for maintaining K+ homeostasis and optimizing nutrient foraging by roots.

Abstract: Summary
During aging, the regenerative capacity of skeletal muscle decreases due to intrinsic changes in muscle stem cells (MuSCs) and alterations in their niche. Here, we use quantitative mass spectrometry to characterize intrinsic changes in the MuSC proteome and remodeling of the MuSC niche during aging. We generate a network connecting age-affected ligands located in the niche and cell surface receptors on MuSCs. Thereby, we reveal signaling by integrins, Lrp1, Egfr, and Cd44 as the major cell communication axes perturbed through aging. We investigate the effect of Smoc2, a secreted protein that accumulates with aging, primarily originating from fibro-adipogenic progenitors. Increased levels of Smoc2 contribute to the aberrant Integrin beta-1 (Itgb1)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling observed during aging, thereby causing impaired MuSC functionality and muscle regeneration. By connecting changes in the proteome of MuSCs to alterations of their niche, our work will enable a better understanding of how MuSCs are affected during aging.

Abstract: Summary
Prior studies of the renal cell carcinoma (RCC) germline landscape investigated predominantly patients of European ancestry. We examine the frequency of germline pathogenic and likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants in 1,829 patients with RCC from various ancestries. Overall, P/LP variants are found in 17% of patients, among whom 10.3% harbor one or more clinically actionable variants with potential preventive or therapeutic utility. Patients of African ancestry with RCC harbor significantly more P/LP variants in FH compared to patients of non-African ancestry with RCC and African controls from the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). Patients of non-African ancestry have significantly more P/LP variants in CHEK2 compared to patients of African ancestry with RCC and non-Finnish Europeans controls. Non-Africans with RCC have more actionable variants compared to Africans with RCC. This work helps understand the underlying biological differences in RCC between Africans and non-Africans and paves the way to more comprehensive genomic characterization of underrepresented populations.

Abstract: Summary
Antihyperglycemic therapy is an important priority for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Excessive hepatic glucose production (HGP) is a major cause of fasting hyperglycemia. Therefore, a better understanding of its regulation would be important to develop effective antihyperglycemic therapies. Using a gluconeogenesis-targeted kinome screening approach combined with transcriptome analyses, we uncovered Nemo-like kinase (NLK) as a potent suppressor of HGP. Mechanistically, NLK phosphorylates and promotes nuclear export of CRTC2 and FOXO1, two key regulators of hepatic gluconeogenesis, resulting in the proteasome-dependent degradation of the former and the inhibition of the self-transcriptional activity and expression of the latter. Importantly, the expression of NLK is downregulated in the liver of individuals with diabetes and in diabetic rodent models and restoring NLK expression in the mouse model ameliorates hyperglycemia. Therefore, our findings uncover NLK as a critical player in the gluconeogenic regulatory network and as a potential therapeutic target for T2D.

Abstract: To elucidate S100 protein-mediated signaling pathways, we attempted to identify novel binding partners for S100A2 by screening protein arrays carrying 19,676 recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused human proteins with biotinylated S100A2. Among newly discovered putative S100A2 interactants, including TMLHE, TRH, RPL36, MRPS34, CDR2L, OIP5, and MED29, we identified and characterized the tubulin polymerization-promoting protein (TPPP) as a novel S100A2-binding protein. We confirmed the interaction of TPPP with Ca2+/S100A2 by multiple independent methods, including the protein array method, S100A2 overlay, and pulldown assay in vitro and in transfected COS-7 cells. Based on the results from the S100A2 overlay assay using various GST-TPPP mutants, the S100A2-binding region was identified in the C-terminal (residues 111–160) of the central core domain of a monomeric form of TPPP that is involved in TPPP dimerization. Chemical cross-linking experiments indicated that S100A2 suppresses dimer formation of His-tagged TPPP in a dose-dependent and a Ca2+-dependent manner. In addition to S100A2, TPPP dimerization is disrupted by other multiple S100 proteins, including S100A6 and S100B, in a Ca2+-dependent manner but not by S100A4. This is consistent with the fact that S100A6 and S100B, but not S100A4, are capable of interacting with GST-TPPP in the presence of Ca2+. Considering these results together, TPPP was identified as a novel target for S100A2, and it is a potential binding target for other multiple S100 proteins, including S100A6 and S100B. Direct binding of the S100 proteins with TPPP may cause disassembly of TPPP dimer formation in response to the increasing concentration of intracellular Ca2+, thus resulting in the regulation of the physiological function of TPPP, such as microtubule organization.

Abstract: Summary
Cortical activity related to erroneous behavior in discrimination or decision-making tasks is rarely analyzed, yet it can help clarify which computations are essential during a specific task. Here, we use a hidden Markov model (HMM) to perform a trial-by-trial analysis of the ensemble activity of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFdl) neurons of rhesus monkeys performing a distance discrimination task. By segmenting the neural activity into sequences of metastable states, HMM allows us to uncover modulations of the neural dynamics related to internal computations. We find that metastable dynamics slow down during error trials, while state transitions at a pivotal point during the trial take longer in difficult correct trials. Both these phenomena occur during the decision interval, with errors occurring in both easy and difficult trials. Our results provide further support for the emerging role of metastable cortical dynamics in mediating complex cognitive functions and behavior.

Abstract: Summary
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) to produce viral proteins for replication and immune evasion. We apply long-read RNA and cDNA sequencing to in vitro human and primate infection models to study transcriptional dynamics. Transcription-regulating sequence (TRS)-dependent sgRNA upregulates earlier in infection than TRS-independent sgRNA. An abundant class of TRS-independent sgRNA consisting of a portion of open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) containing nsp1 joins to ORF10, and the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) upregulates at 48 h post-infection in human cell lines. We identify double-junction sgRNA containing both TRS-dependent and -independent junctions. We find multiple sites at which the SARS-CoV-2 genome is consistently more modified than sgRNA and that sgRNA modifications are stable across transcript clusters, host cells, and time since infection. Our work highlights the dynamic nature of the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome during its replication cycle.

Abstract: Summary
Clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs) are highly immune infiltrated, but the effect of immune heterogeneity on clinical outcome in ccRCC has not been fully characterized. Here we perform paired single-cell RNA (scRNA) and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing of 167,283 cells from multiple tumor regions, lymph node, normal kidney, and peripheral blood of two immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)-naïve and four ICB-treated patients to map the ccRCC immune landscape. We detect extensive heterogeneity within and between patients, with enrichment of CD8A+ tissue-resident T cells in a patient responsive to ICB and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in a resistant patient. A TCR trajectory framework suggests distinct T cell differentiation pathways between patients responding and resistant to ICB. Finally, scRNA-derived signatures of tissue-resident T cells and TAMs are associated with response to ICB and targeted therapies across multiple independent cohorts. Our study establishes a multimodal interrogation of the cellular programs underlying therapeutic efficacy in ccRCC.

Abstract: Summary
Body axis elongation is a hallmark of the vertebrate embryo, involving the architectural remodeling of the tail bud. Although it is clear how neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) contribute to embryo elongation, the dynamic events that lead to de novo lumen formation and that culminate in the formation of a 3-dimensional, neural tube from NMPs, are poorly understood. Here, we used in vivo imaging of the chicken embryo to show that cell intercalation downstream of TGF-β/SMAD3 signaling is required for secondary neural tube formation. Our analysis describes the events in embryo elongation including lineage restriction, the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of NMPs, and the initiation of lumen formation. We show that the resolution of a single, centrally positioned lumen, which occurs through the intercalation of central cells, requires SMAD3/Yes-associated protein (YAP) activity. We anticipate that these findings will be relevant to understand caudal, skin-covered neural tube defects, among the most frequent birth defects detected in humans.

Abstract: Summary
Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are widespread in bacteria, but their activation mechanisms and bona fide targets remain largely unknown. Here, we characterize a type III TA system, toxIN, that protects E. coli against multiple bacteriophages, including T4. Using RNA sequencing, we find that the endoribonuclease ToxN is activated following T4 infection and blocks phage development primarily by cleaving viral mRNAs and inhibiting their translation. ToxN activation arises from T4-induced shutoff of host transcription, specifically of toxIN, leading to loss of the intrinsically unstable toxI antitoxin. Transcriptional shutoff is necessary and sufficient for ToxN activation. Notably, toxIN does not strongly protect against another phage, T7, which incompletely blocks host transcription. Thus, our results reveal a critical trade-off in blocking host transcription: it helps phage commandeer host resources but can activate potent defense systems. More generally, our results now reveal the native targets of an RNase toxin and activation mechanism of a phage-defensive TA system.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian DNA base excision repair (BER) is accelerated by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) and the scaffold protein XRCC1. PARPs are sensors that detect single-strand break intermediates, but the critical role of XRCC1 during BER is unknown. Here, we show that protein complexes containing DNA polymerase β and DNA ligase III that are assembled by XRCC1 prevent excessive engagement and activity of PARP1 during BER. As a result, PARP1 becomes “trapped” on BER intermediates in XRCC1-deficient cells in a manner similar to that induced by PARP inhibitors, including in patient fibroblasts from XRCC1-mutated disease. This excessive PARP1 engagement and trapping renders BER intermediates inaccessible to enzymes such as DNA polymerase β and impedes their repair. Consequently, PARP1 deletion rescues BER and resistance to base damage in XRCC1−/− cells. These data reveal excessive PARP1 engagement during BER as a threat to genome integrity and identify XRCC1 as an “anti-trapper” that prevents toxic PARP1 activity.

Abstract: Summary
Fgf21 (fibroblast growth factor 21) is a regulatory hepatokine that, in pharmacologic form, powerfully promotes weight loss and glucose homeostasis. Although “Fgf21 resistance” is inferred from higher plasma Fgf21 levels in insulin-resistant mice and humans, diminished Fgf21 function is understood primarily via Fgf21 knockout mice. By contrast, we show that modestly reduced Fgf21—owing to cell-autonomous suppression by hepatic FoxO1—contributes to dysregulated metabolism in LDKO mice (Irs1L/L⋅Irs2L/L⋅CreAlb), a model of severe hepatic insulin resistance caused by deletion of hepatic Irs1 (insulin receptor substrate 1) and Irs2. Knockout of hepatic Foxo1 in LDKO mice or direct restoration of Fgf21 by adenoviral infection restored glucose utilization by BAT (brown adipose tissue) and skeletal muscle, normalized thermogenic gene expression in LDKO BAT, and corrected acute cold intolerance of LDKO mice. These studies highlight the Fgf21-dependent plasticity and importance of BAT function to metabolic health during hepatic insulin resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Emerging evidence suggests a key contribution to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathogenesis by Th17 cells. The pathogenic characteristics and mechanisms of hepatic Th17 cells, however, remain unknown. Here, we uncover and characterize a distinct population of inflammatory hepatic CXCR3+Th17 (ihTh17) cells sufficient to exacerbate NAFLD pathogenesis. Hepatic ihTh17 cell accrual was dependent on the liver microenvironment and CXCR3 axis activation. Mechanistically, the pathogenic potential of ihTh17 cells correlated with increased chromatin accessibility, glycolytic output, and concomitant production of IL-17A, IFNγ, and TNFα. Modulation of glycolysis using 2-DG or cell-specific PKM2 deletion was sufficient to reverse ihTh17-centric inflammatory vigor and NAFLD severity. Importantly, ihTh17 cell characteristics, CXCR3 axis activation, and hepatic expression of glycolytic genes were conserved in human NAFLD. Together, our data show that the steatotic liver microenvironment regulates Th17 cell accrual, metabolism, and competence toward an ihTh17 fate. Modulation of these pathways holds potential for development of novel therapeutic strategies for NAFLD.

Abstract: Summary
The BRCA1-BARD1 complex directs the DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway choice to error-free homologous recombination (HR) during the S-G2 stages. Targeting BRCA1-BARD1 to DSB-proximal sites requires BARD1-mediated nucleosome interaction and histone mark recognition. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of BARD1 bound to a ubiquitinated nucleosome core particle (NCPUb) at 3.1 Å resolution and illustrate how BARD1 simultaneously recognizes the DNA damage-induced mark H2AK15ub and DNA replication-associated mark H4K20me0 on the nucleosome. In vitro and in vivo analyses reveal that the BARD1-NCPUb complex is stabilized by BARD1-nucleosome interaction, BARD1-ubiquitin interaction, and BARD1 ARD domain-BARD1 BRCT domain interaction, and abrogating these interactions is detrimental to HR activity. We further identify multiple disease-causing BARD1 mutations that disrupt BARD1-NCPUb interactions and hence impair HR. Together, this study elucidates the mechanism of BRCA1-BARD1 complex recruitment and retention by DSB-flanking nucleosomes and sheds important light on cancer therapeutic avenues.

Abstract: Summary
Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the primary pathway for receptor and cargo internalization in eukaryotic cells. It is characterized by a polyhedral clathrin lattice that coats budding membranes. The mechanism and control of lattice assembly, curvature, and vesicle formation at the plasma membrane has been a matter of long-standing debate. Here, we use platinum replica and cryoelectron microscopy and tomography to present a structural framework of the pathway. We determine the shape and size parameters common to clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We show that clathrin sites maintain a constant surface area during curvature across multiple cell lines. Flat clathrin is present in all cells and spontaneously curves into coated pits without additional energy sources or recruited factors. Finally, we attribute curvature generation to loosely connected and pentagon-containing flat lattices that can rapidly curve when a flattening force is released. Together, these data present a universal mechanistic model of clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

Abstract: Summary
Cardiac pacemaker cells (CPCs) rhythmically initiate the electrical impulses that drive heart contraction. CPCs display the highest rate of spontaneous depolarization in the heart despite being subjected to inhibitory electrochemical conditions that should theoretically suppress their activity. While several models have been proposed to explain this apparent paradox, the actual molecular mechanisms that allow CPCs to overcome electrogenic barriers to their function remain poorly understood. Here, we have traced CPC development at single-cell resolution and uncovered a series of cytoarchitectural patterning events that are critical for proper pacemaking. Specifically, our data reveal that CPCs dynamically modulate adherens junction (AJ) engagement to control characteristics including surface area, volume, and gap junctional coupling. This allows CPCs to adopt a structural configuration that supports their overall excitability. Thus, our data have identified a direct role for local cellular mechanics in patterning critical morphological features that are necessary for CPC electrical activity.

Abstract: Summary
Physical exercise has profound effects on quality of life and susceptibility to chronic disease; however, the regulation of skeletal muscle function at the molecular level after exercise remains unclear. We tested the hypothesis that the benefits of exercise on muscle function are linked partly to microtraumatic events that result in accumulation of circulating heme. Effective metabolism of heme is controlled by Heme Oxygenase-1 (HO-1, Hmox1), and we find that mouse skeletal muscle-specific HO-1 deletion (Tam-Cre-HSA-Hmox1fl/fl) shifts the proportion of muscle fibers from type IIA to type IIB concomitant with a disruption in mitochondrial content and function. In addition to a significant impairment in running performance and response to exercise training, Tam-Cre-HSA-Hmox1fl/fl mice show remarkable muscle atrophy compared to Hmox1fl/fl controls. Collectively, these data define a role for heme and HO-1 as central regulators in the physiologic response of skeletal muscle to exercise.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian inner ear and fish lateral line sensory hair cells (HCs) detect fluid motion to transduce environmental signals. Actively maintained ionic homeostasis of the mammalian inner ear endolymph is essential for HC function. In contrast, fish lateral line HCs are exposed to the fluctuating ionic composition of the aqueous environment. Using lineage labeling, in vivo time-lapse imaging and scRNA-seq, we discovered highly motile skin-derived cells that invade mature mechanosensory organs of the zebrafish lateral line and differentiate into Neuromast-associated (Nm) ionocytes. This invasion is adaptive as it is triggered by environmental fluctuations. Our discovery of Nm ionocytes challenges the notion of an entirely placodally derived lateral line and identifies Nm ionocytes as likely regulators of HC function possibly by modulating the ionic microenvironment. Nm ionocytes provide an experimentally accessible in vivo system to study cell invasion and migration, as well as the physiological adaptation of vertebrate organs to changing environmental conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Complex I (CI) is the largest enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, and its defects are the main cause of mitochondrial disease. To understand the mechanisms regulating the extremely intricate biogenesis of this fundamental bioenergetic machine, we analyze the structural and functional consequences of the ablation of NDUFS3, a non-catalytic core subunit. We show that, in diverse mammalian cell types, a small amount of functional CI can still be detected in the complete absence of NDUFS3. In addition, we determine the dynamics of CI disassembly when the amount of NDUFS3 is gradually decreased. The process of degradation of the complex occurs in a hierarchical and modular fashion in which the ND4 module remains stable and bound to TMEM126A. We, thus, uncover the function of TMEM126A, the product of a disease gene causing recessive optic atrophy as a factor necessary for the correct assembly and function of CI.

Abstract: Summary
Artificial glycan holes on recombinant Env-based vaccines occur when a potential N-linked glycosylation site (PNGS) is under-occupied, but not on their viral counterparts. Native-like SOSIP trimers, including clinical candidates, contain such holes in the glycan shield that induce strain-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) or non-NAbs. To eliminate glycan holes and mimic the glycosylation of native BG505 Env, we replace all 12 NxS sequons on BG505 SOSIP with NxT. All PNGS, except N133 and N160, are nearly fully occupied. Occupancy of the N133 site is increased by changing N133 to NxS, whereas occupancy of the N160 site is restored by reverting the nearby N156 sequon to NxS. Hence, PNGS in close proximity, such as in the N133-N137 and N156-N160 pairs, affect each other’s occupancy. We further apply this approach to improve the occupancy of several Env strains. Increasing glycan occupancy should reduce off-target immune responses to vaccine antigens.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity is characterized by the excessive accumulation of the white adipose tissue (WAT), but healthy expansion of WAT via adipocyte hyperplasia can offset the negative metabolic effects of obesity. Thus, identification of novel adipogenesis regulators that promote hyperplasia may lead to effective therapies for obesity-induced metabolic disorders. Using transcriptomic approaches, we identified transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif-containing 1 (TMBIM1) as an inhibitor of adipogenesis. Gain or loss of function of TMBIM1 in preadipocytes inhibited or promoted adipogenesis, respectively. In vivo, in response to caloric excess, adipocyte precursor (AP)-specific Tmbim1 knockout (KO) mice displayed WAT hyperplasia and improved systemic metabolic health, while overexpression of Tmbim1 in transgenic mice showed the opposite effects. Moreover, mature adipocyte-specific Tmbim1 KO did not affect WAT cellularity or nutrient homeostasis. Mechanistically, TMBIM1 binds to and promotes the autoubiquitination and degradation of NEDD4, which is an E3 ligase that stabilizes PPARγ. Our data show that TMBIM1 is a potent repressor of adipogenesis and a potential therapeutic target for obesity-related metabolic disease.

Abstract: Summary
Exitron splicing (EIS) creates a cryptic intron (called an exitron) within a protein-coding exon to increase proteome diversity. EIS is poorly characterized, but emerging evidence suggests a role for EIS in cancer. Through a systematic investigation of EIS across 33 cancers from 9,599 tumor transcriptomes, we discovered that EIS affected 63% of human coding genes and that 95% of those events were tumor specific. Notably, we observed a mutually exclusive pattern between EIS and somatic mutations in their affected genes. Functionally, we discovered that EIS altered known and novel cancer driver genes for causing gain- or loss-of-function, which promotes tumor progression. Importantly, we identified EIS-derived neoepitopes that bind to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I or II. Analysis of clinical data from a clear cell renal cell carcinoma cohort revealed an association between EIS-derived neoantigen load and checkpoint inhibitor response. Our findings establish the importance of considering EIS alterations when nominating cancer driver events and neoantigens.

Abstract: There are several therapeutic options for spinal cord injury (SCI), among these strategies stem cell therapy is a potential treatment. The stem cells based therapies have been investigating in acute phase of clinical trials for promoting spinal repair in humans through replacement of functional neuronal and glial cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate the differentiation of Human Dental Pulp Stem Cells (hDPSCs) into functional motor neuron like cells (MNLCs) and promote neuroregeneration by stimulating local neurogenesis in the adult spinal cord slice culture. The immunocytochemistry analysis demonstrated that hDPSCs were positive for mesenchymal stem cell markers (CD73, CD90 and CD105) and negative for the hematopoietic markers (CD34 and CD45). hDPSCs were induced to neurospheres (via implementing B27, EGF, and bFGF) and then neural stem cells (NSC). The NSC differentiated into MNLCs in two steps: first by Shh and RA and ; then with GDNF and BDNF administration. The NS and the NSC were assessed for Oct4, nestin, Nanog, Sox2 expression while the MNLCs were evaluated by ISLET1, Olig2, and HB9 genes. Our results showed that hDPSC can be differentiated into motor neuron phenotype with expression of the motor neuron genes. The functionality of MNLCs was demonstrated by FM1-43, intracellular calcium ion shift and co- culture with C2C12. We co-cultivated hDPSCs with adult rat spinal slices in vitro. Immunostaining and hoechst assay showed that hDPSCs were able to migrate, proliferate and integrate in both the anterolateral zone and the edges of the spinal slices.

Abstract: The circadian molecular Clock is an internal time-keeping system, which regulates various physiological processes. The circadian Clock may be involved in all biological processes. The circadian Clock is closely related to prolactin’s activities. However, until now, the effect of circadian Clock dysregulation on PRL’s bioactivities remains unclear. Clock protein is an essential component in circadian Clock and necessary for Clock function. Therefore, Clock gene knockout mice (CLOCK −/− mice) was used to explore the effect of circadian Clock dysfunction on PRL’s activities. The in vitro and in vivo experimental results showed that PRLR-mediated signaling was significantly down-regulated. PRL-induced JAK2-STAT5 signaling in Clock-/- mice was significantly decreased compared to control mice in vivo. In vitro, PRL/PRLR-mediated signaling in mammary epithelial cell that Clock was knocked down by siRNA was significantly down-regulated compared to control cells. Mechanistically, the expression levels of negative regulatory molecule (the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) was upregulated in vitro and in vivo, which may be one of the factors that causes the PRL-signaling downregulation. Taken together, the current work indicates that the circadian Clock affects the PRL’s activities. This finding lays the foundation for studying the relationship between the circadian Clock and PRL’s biological activities.

Abstract: The effect of brain extracellular matrix (ECM) on synaptic plasticity remains controversial. Here, we show that targeted enzymatic attenuation with chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) of ECM triggers the appearance of new glutamatergic synapses on hippocampal pyramidal neurons, thereby increasing the amplitude of field EPSPs while decreasing both the mean miniature EPSC amplitude and AMPA/NMDA ratio. Although the increased proportion of ‘unpotentiated’ synapses caused by ECM attenuation should promote long-term potentiation (LTP), surprisingly, LTP was suppressed. The upregulation of small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (SK) channels decreased the excitability of pyramidal neurons, thereby suppressing LTP. A blockade of SK channels restored cell excitability and enhanced LTP; this enhancement was abolished by a blockade of Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), which is involved in the maturation of dendritic spines. Thus, targeting ECM elicits the appearance of new synapses, which can have potential applications in regenerative medicine. However, this process is compensated for by a reduction in postsynaptic neuron excitability, preventing network overexcitation at the expense of synaptic plasticity.

Abstract: Summary
Adenosine N6-methylation (m6A) is one of the most pervasive mRNA modifications, and yet the physiological significance of m6A removal (demethylation) remains elusive. Here, we report that the m6A demethylase FTO functions as a conserved regulator of motile ciliogenesis. Mechanistically, FTO demethylates and thereby stabilizes the mRNA that encodes the master ciliary transcription factor FOXJ1. Depletion of Fto in Xenopus laevis embryos caused widespread motile cilia defects, and Foxj1 was identified as one of the major phenocritical targets. In primary human airway epithelium, FTO depletion also led to FOXJ1 mRNA destabilization and a severe loss of ciliated cells with an increase of neighboring goblet cells. Consistently, Fto knockout mice showed strong asthma-like phenotypes upon allergen challenge, a result owing to defective ciliated cells in the airway epithelium. Altogether, our study reveals a conserved role of the FTO-FOXJ1 axis in embryonic and homeostatic motile ciliogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Cells sense and respond to extracellular mechanical cues through cell-matrix adhesions. Interestingly, the maturation of focal adhesions (FAs) is reciprocally force dependent. How biomechanical cues dictate the status of cell motility and how FAs spatial temporally coordinate force sensing and self-organization remain enigmatic. Here, we identify that LIMD1, a member of the LIM domain scaffolding proteins, undergoes force-sensitive condensation at the FAs. We also unveil that the multivalent interactions of LIMD1 intrinsically disordered region (IDR) and the LIM domains concertedly drive this phase transition under the regulation of phosphorylation. Intriguingly, formation of condensed LIMD1 protein compartments is sufficient to specifically enrich and localize late FA proteins. We further discover that LIMD1 regulates cell spreading, maintains FA dynamics and cellular contractility, and is critical for durotaxis—the ability of cells to crawl along gradients of substrate stiffness. Our results suggest a model that recruitment of LIMD1 to the FAs, via mechanical force triggered inter-molecular interaction, serves as a phase separation hub to assemble and organize matured FAs, thus allowing for efficient mechano-transduction and cell migration.

Abstract: Summary
Long undecoded transcript isoforms (LUTIs) represent a class of non-canonical mRNAs that downregulate gene expression through the combined act of transcriptional and translational repression. While single gene studies revealed important aspects of LUTI-based repression, how these features affect gene regulation on a global scale is unknown. Using transcript leader and direct RNA sequencing, here, we identify 74 LUTI candidates that are specifically induced in meiotic prophase. Translational repression of these candidates appears to be ubiquitous and is dependent on upstream open reading frames. However, LUTI-based transcriptional repression is variable. In only 50% of the cases, LUTI transcription causes downregulation of the protein-coding transcript isoform. Higher LUTI expression, enrichment of histone 3 lysine 36 trimethylation, and changes in nucleosome position are the strongest predictors of LUTI-based transcriptional repression. We conclude that LUTIs downregulate gene expression in a manner that integrates translational repression, chromatin state changes, and the magnitude of LUTI expression.

We model the basal ganglia inhibitory patterns as silencing some thalamic neurons while leaving others disinhibited and free to interact with cortex during specific motifs. We show that a small number of disinhibited thalamic neurons can control cortical dynamics to generate specific motor output in a noise-robust way. Additionally, a single “preparatory” thalamocortical network can produce fast cortical dynamics that support rapid transitions between any pair of learned motifs. If the thalamic units associated with each sequence component are segregated, many motor outputs can be learned without interference and then combined in arbitrary orders for the flexible production of long and complex motor sequences.

Abstract: The present study describes the ultrastructural organization of the spermatozoa of the brachylaimid digenean Ityogonimus ocreatus (Ityogoniminae) by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Live digeneans were collected from the digestive tract of an Iberian mole Talpa occidentalis (Eulipotyphla, Talpidae) captured accidentally during a vole pest control campaign in Priesca (Asturias, Spain). The TEM study reveals that the I. ocreatus sperm are filiform, tapered at both extremities, and have two 9+'1' trepaxonematan axonemes, external ornamentation of the plasma membrane associated with cortical microtubules, spine-like bodies, two bundles of parallel cortical microtubules and one mitochondrion overlapping the anterior part of the nucleus. The external ornamentation of the plasma membrane is located in the posterior part of the anterior region. The maximum number of parallel cortical microtubules (45) is located in the anterior part of the sperm cells. Our results are compared with the available data on the family Brachylaimidae, especially on the other Ityogoniminae studied to date (Scaphiostomum palaearcticum).

Abstract: Summary
Deep learning has emerged as the technique of choice for identifying hidden patterns in cell imaging data but is often criticized as “black box.” Here, we employ a generative neural network in combination with supervised machine learning to classify patient-derived melanoma xenografts as “efficient” or “inefficient” metastatic, validate predictions regarding melanoma cell lines with unknown metastatic efficiency in mouse xenografts, and use the network to generate in silico cell images that amplify the critical predictive cell properties. These exaggerated images unveiled pseudopodial extensions and increased light scattering as hallmark properties of metastatic cells. We validated this interpretation using live cells spontaneously transitioning between states indicative of low and high metastatic efficiency. This study illustrates how the application of artificial intelligence can support the identification of cellular properties that are predictive of complex phenotypes and integrated cell functions but are too subtle to be identified in the raw imagery by a human expert. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
Heat shock instantly reprograms transcription. Whether gene and enhancer transcription fully recover from stress and whether stress establishes a memory by provoking transcription regulation that persists through mitosis remained unknown. Here, we measured nascent transcription and chromatin accessibility in unconditioned cells and in the daughters of stress-exposed cells. Tracking transcription genome-wide at nucleotide-resolution revealed that cells precisely restored RNA polymerase II (Pol II) distribution at gene bodies and enhancers upon recovery from stress. However, a single heat exposure in embryonic fibroblasts primed a faster gene induction in their daughter cells by increasing promoter-proximal Pol II pausing and by accelerating the pause release. In K562 erythroleukemia cells, repeated stress refined basal and heat-induced transcription over mitotic division and decelerated termination-coupled pre-mRNA processing. The slower termination retained transcripts on the chromatin and reduced recycling of Pol II. These results demonstrate that heat-induced transcriptional memory acts through promoter-proximal pause release and pre-mRNA processing at transcription termination.

Abstract: Summary
Although embryonic brain development and neurodegeneration have received considerable attention, the events that govern postnatal brain maturation are less understood. Here, we identify the miR-29 family to be strikingly induced during the late stages of brain maturation. Brain maturation is associated with a transient, postnatal period of de novo non-CG (CH) DNA methylation mediated by DNMT3A. We examine whether an important function of miR-29 during brain maturation is to restrict the period of CH methylation via its targeting of Dnmt3a. Deletion of miR-29 in the brain, or knockin mutations preventing miR-29 to specifically target Dnmt3a, result in increased DNMT3A expression, higher CH methylation, and repression of genes associated with neuronal activity and neuropsychiatric disorders. These mouse models also develop neurological deficits and premature lethality. Our results identify an essential role for miR-29 in restricting CH methylation in the brain and illustrate the importance of CH methylation regulation for normal brain maturation.

Abstract: Summary
How are E3 ubiquitin ligases configured to match substrate quaternary structures? Here, by studying the yeast GID complex (mutation of which causes deficiency in glucose-induced degradation of gluconeogenic enzymes), we discover supramolecular chelate assembly as an E3 ligase strategy for targeting an oligomeric substrate. Cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures show that, to bind the tetrameric substrate fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (Fbp1), two minimally functional GID E3s assemble into the 20-protein Chelator-GIDSR4, which resembles an organometallic supramolecular chelate. The Chelator-GIDSR4 assembly avidly binds multiple Fbp1 degrons so that multiple Fbp1 protomers are simultaneously ubiquitylated at lysines near the allosteric and substrate binding sites. Importantly, key structural and biochemical features, including capacity for supramolecular assembly, are preserved in the human ortholog, the CTLH E3. Based on our integrative structural, biochemical, and cell biological data, we propose that higher-order E3 ligase assembly generally enables multipronged targeting, capable of simultaneously incapacitating multiple protomers and functionalities of oligomeric substrates.

Abstract: Summary
Limb regeneration, while observed lifelong in salamanders, is restricted in post-metamorphic Xenopus laevis frogs. Whether this loss is due to systemic factors or an intrinsic incapability of cells to form competent stem cells has been unclear. Here, we use genetic fate mapping to establish that connective tissue (CT) cells form the post-metamorphic frog blastema, as in the case of axolotls. Using heterochronic transplantation into the limb bud and single-cell transcriptomic profiling, we show that axolotl CT cells dedifferentiate and integrate to form lineages, including cartilage. In contrast, frog blastema CT cells do not fully re-express the limb bud progenitor program, even when transplanted into the limb bud. Correspondingly, transplanted cells contribute to extraskeletal CT, but not to the developing cartilage. Furthermore, using single-cell RNA-seq analysis we find that embryonic and adult frog cartilage differentiation programs are molecularly distinct. This work defines intrinsic restrictions in CT dedifferentiation as a limitation in adult regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
The mammalian cochlea cannot regenerate functional hair cells (HCs) spontaneously. Atoh1 overexpression as well as other strategies are unable to generate functional HCs. Here, we simultaneously upregulated the expression of Gfi1, Pou4f3, and Atoh1 in postnatal cochlear supporting cells (SCs) in vivo, which efficiently converted SCs into HCs. The newly regenerated HCs expressed HC markers Myo7a, Calbindin, Parvalbumin, and Ctbp2 and were innervated by neurites. Importantly, many new HCs expressed the mature and terminal marker Prestin or vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (vGlut3), depending on the subtypes of the source SCs. Finally, our patch-clamp analysis showed that the new HCs in the medial region acquired a large K+ current, fired spikes transiently, and exhibited signature refinement of ribbon synapse functions, in close resemblance to native wild-type inner HCs. We demonstrated that co-upregulating Gfi1, Pou4f3, and Atoh1 enhances the efficiency of HC generation and promotes the functional maturation of new HCs.

Abstract: Summary
A deficient interferon (IFN) response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been implicated as a determinant of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To identify the molecular effectors that govern IFN control of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we conducted a large-scale gain-of-function analysis that evaluated the impact of human IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) on viral replication. A limited subset of ISGs were found to control viral infection, including endosomal factors inhibiting viral entry, RNA binding proteins suppressing viral RNA synthesis, and a highly enriched cluster of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi-resident ISGs inhibiting viral assembly/egress. These included broad-acting antiviral ISGs and eight ISGs that specifically inhibited SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 replication. Among the broad-acting ISGs was BST2/tetherin, which impeded viral release and is antagonized by SARS-CoV-2 Orf7a protein. Overall, these data illuminate a set of ISGs that underlie innate immune control of SARS-CoV-2/SARS-CoV-1 infection, which will facilitate the understanding of host determinants that impact disease severity and offer potential therapeutic strategies for COVID-19.

Abstract: In polycystic kidney disease (PKD) multiple bilateral renal cysts gradually enlarge causing a decline in renal function. Transepithelial chloride secretion through cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and TMEM16A (anoctamin 1) drive cyst enlargement. We demonstrated recently that a loss of PKD1 increases expression and function of TMEM16A in murine kidneys and in mouse M1 collecting duct cells. The data demonstrated that TMEM16A contributes essentially to cyst growth by upregulating intracellular Ca2+ signaling. Enhanced expression of TMEM16A and Ca2+ signaling increased both cell proliferation and fluid secretion, which suggested inhibition of TMEM16A as a novel therapy in ADPKD. About 15 % of all ADPKD cases are caused by mutations in PKD2. To analyze the effects of loss of function of PKD2 on Ca2+ signaling, we knocked-down Pkd2 in mouse primary renal epithelial cells in the present study, using viral transfection of shRNA. Unlike in Pkd1-/- cells, knockdown of PKD2 lowered basal Ca2+ and augmented store-operated Ca2+ entry, which was both independent of TMEM16A. However, disease causing purinergic Ca2+ store release was enhanced, similar to that observed in Pkd1-/- renal epithelial cells. The present data suggest pharmacological inhibition of TMEM16A as a treatment in ADPKD caused by mutations in both PKD1 and PKD2.

Abstract: Summary
In schizophrenia (SCZ), neurons in the brain tend to undergo gross morphological changes, but the related molecular mechanism remains largely elusive. Using Kif3b+/− mice as a model with SCZ-like behaviors, we found that a high-betaine diet can significantly alleviate schizophrenic traits related to neuronal morphogenesis and behaviors. According to a deficiency in the transport of collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) by the KIF3 motor, we identified a significant reduction in lamellipodial dynamics in developing Kif3b+/− neurons as a cause of neurite hyperbranching. Betaine administration significantly decreases CRMP2 carbonylation, which enhances the F-actin bundling needed for proper lamellipodial dynamics and microtubule exclusion and may thus functionally compensate for KIF3 deficiency. Because the KIF3 expression levels tend to be downregulated in the human prefrontal cortex of the postmortem brains of SCZ patients, this mechanism may partly participate in human SCZ pathogenesis, which we hypothesize could be alleviated by betaine administration.

Abstract: Summary
Paracellular permeability is regulated to allow solute transport or cell migration across epithelial or endothelial barriers. However, how cell-cell junction dynamics controls paracellular permeability is poorly understood. Here, we describe patency, a developmentally regulated process in Drosophila oogenesis, during which cell vertices in the follicular epithelium open transiently to allow paracellular transport of yolk proteins for uptake by the oocyte. We show that the sequential removal of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, NCAM/Fasciclin 2, and Sidekick from vertices precedes their basal-to-apical opening, while the subsequent assembly of tricellular occluding junctions marks the termination of patency and seals the paracellular barrier. E-cadherin-based adhesion is required to limit paracellular channel size, whereas stabilized adherens junctions, prolonged NCAM/Fasciclin 2 expression, blocked endocytosis, or increased actomyosin contractility prevent patency. Our findings reveal a key role of cell vertices as gateways controlling paracellular transport and demonstrate that dynamic regulation of adhesion and actomyosin contractility at vertices governs epithelial barrier properties.

Abstract: Summary
New World hantaviruses (NWHs) are endemic in North and South America and cause hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS), with a case fatality rate of up to 40%. Knowledge of the natural humoral immune response to NWH infection is limited. Here, we describe human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) isolated from individuals previously infected with Sin Nombre virus (SNV) or Andes virus (ANDV). Most SNV-reactive antibodies show broad recognition and cross-neutralization of both New and Old World hantaviruses, while many ANDV-reactive antibodies show activity for ANDV only. mAbs ANDV-44 and SNV-53 compete for binding to a distinct site on the ANDV surface glycoprotein and show potently neutralizing activity to New and Old World hantaviruses. Four mAbs show therapeutic efficacy at clinically relevant doses in hamsters. These studies reveal a convergent and potently neutralizing human antibody response to NWHs and suggest therapeutic potential for human mAbs against HCPS.

Abstract: To define novel networks of Parkinson’s disease (PD) pathogenesis, the substantia nigra pars compacta of A53T mice, where a death-promoting protein, FAS-associated factor 1 was ectopically expressed for 2 weeks in the 2-, 4-, 6-, and 8-month-old mice, and was subjected to transcriptomic analysis. Compendia of expression profiles and a hierarchical clustering heat map of differentially expressed genes associated with PD were bioinformatically generated. Transcripts level of a particular gene was fluctuated by 20, 60, and 0.75 fold in the 4-, 6-, and 8-month-old mice compared to the 2 months old. Because the gene contained Kelch domain, it was named as Kapd (Kelch-containing protein associated with PD). Biological functions of Kapd were systematically investigated in the zebrafish embryos. First, transcripts of a zebrafish homologue of Kapd, kapd were found in the floor plate of the neural tube at 10 h post fertilization (hpf), and restricted to the tegmentum, hypothalamus, and cerebellum at 24 hpf. Second, knockdown of kapd caused developmental defects of DA progenitors in the midbrain neural keel and midbrain–hindbrain boundary at 10 hpf. Third, overexpression of kapd increased transcripts level of the dopaminergic immature neuron marker, shha in the prethalamus at 16.5 hpf. Finally, developmental consequences of kapd knockdown reduced transcripts level of the markers for the immature and mature DA neurons, nkx2.2, olig2, otx2b, and th in the ventral diencephalon of the midbrain at 18 hpf. It is thus most probable that Kapd play a key role in the specification of the DA neuronal precursors in zebrafish embryos.

Abstract: Summary
The interplay between hypothalamic neurons and microglia as they integrate stressors to regulate homeostasis is of growing interest. We asked if microglia in the embryonic hypothalamus were likewise stress responsive and, if so, whether their precocious activation perturbs nearby neural stem cell (NSC) programs. We performed single-cell transcriptomics to define embryonic hypothalamic microglia heterogeneity and identified four microglial subsets, including a subpopulation adjacent to NSCs that was responsive to gestational cold stress. Stress exposure elevated CCL3 and CCL4 secretion, but only in male brains, and ex vivo CCL4 treatment of hypothalamic NSCs altered proliferation and differentiation. Concomitantly, gestational stress decreased PVN oxytocin neurons only in male embryos, which was reversed by microglia depletion. Adult offspring exposed to gestational stress displayed altered social behaviors, which was likewise microglia dependent, but only in males. Collectively, immature hypothalamic microglia play an unappreciated role in translating maternal stressors to sexually dimorphic perturbation of neurodevelopmental programs.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is a positive-sense RNA virus causing acute inflammation of the liver. Here, using a genome-scale CRISPR screen, we provide a comprehensive picture of the cellular factors that are exploited by HAV. We identify genes involved in sialic acid/ganglioside biosynthesis and members of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor complex, corroborating their putative roles for HAV. Additionally, we uncover all components of the cellular machinery for UFMylation, a ubiquitin-like protein modification. We show that HAV translation specifically depends on UFM1 conjugation of the ribosomal protein RPL26. Furthermore, we find that components related to the yeast Trf4/5-Air1/2-Mtr4 polyadenylation (TRAMP) complex are required for viral translation independent of controlling viral poly(A) tails or RNA stability. Finally, we demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of the TRAMP-like complex decreases HAV replication in hepatocyte cells and human liver organoids, thus providing a strategy for host-directed therapy of HAV infection.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play an important role in tumor immunity and comprise of subsets that have distinct phenotype, function, and ontology. Transcriptomic analyses of human medulloblastoma, the most common malignant pediatric brain cancer, showed that medulloblastomas (MBs) with activated sonic hedgehog signaling (SHH-MB) have significantly more TAMs than other MB subtypes. Therefore, we examined MB-associated TAMs by single-cell RNA sequencing of autochthonous murine SHH-MB at steady state and under two distinct treatment modalities: molecular-targeted inhibitor and radiation. Our analyses reveal significant TAM heterogeneity, identify markers of ontologically distinct TAM subsets, and show the impact of brain microenvironment on the differentiation of tumor-infiltrating monocytes. TAM composition undergoes dramatic changes with treatment and differs significantly between molecular-targeted and radiation therapy. We identify an immunosuppressive monocyte-derived TAM subset that emerges with radiation therapy and demonstrate its role in regulating T cell and neutrophil infiltration in MB.

Cooperative reactivation of hippocampal and prefrontal neurons is considered crucial for mnemonic processes. To directly record synaptic substances supporting the interregional interactions, we develop concurrent spike recordings of hippocampal neuronal ensembles and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of medial prefrontal neurons in awake rats. We find that medial prefrontal neurons depolarize when hippocampal neurons synchronize. The depolarization in medial prefrontal neurons is larger when hippocampal place cells that encoded overlapping place fields and place cells that encoded a novel environment are synchronously reactivated. Our results suggest a functional circuit-synapse association that enables prefrontal neurons to read out specific memory traces from the hippocampus.

Abstract: Summary
Loss of integrin-mediated attachment to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins can trigger a variety of cellular changes that affect cell viability. Foremost among these is the activation of anoikis, caspase-mediated cell death induced by ECM detachment. In addition, loss of ECM attachment causes profound alterations in cellular metabolism, which can lead to anoikis-independent cell death. Here, we describe a surprising role for serum and glucocorticoid kinase-1 (SGK1) in the promotion of energy production when cells are detached. Our data demonstrate that SGK1 activation is necessary and sufficient for ATP generation during ECM detachment and anchorage-independent growth. More specifically, SGK1 promotes a substantial elevation in glucose uptake because of elevated GLUT1 transcription. In addition, carbon flux into the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is necessary to accommodate elevated glucose uptake and PPP-mediated glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) is necessary for ATP production. Thus, our data show SGK1 as master regulator of glucose metabolism and cell survival during ECM-detached conditions.

Abstract: Summary
The ring-shaped cohesin complex topologically binds to DNA to establish sister chromatid cohesion. This topological binding creates a structural obstacle to genome-wide chromosomal events, such as replication. Here, we examine how conformational changes in cohesin circumvent being an obstacle in human cells. We show that ATP hydrolysis-driven head disengagement, leading to the structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) ring opening, is essential for the progression of DNA replication. Closure of the SMC ring stalls replication in a checkpoint-independent manner. The SMC ring opening also facilitates sister chromatid resolution and chromosome segregation in mitosis. Single-molecule analyses reveal that forced closure of the SMC ring suppresses the translocation of cohesin on DNA as well as the formation of stable DNA loops. Our results suggest that the ATP hydrolysis-driven SMC ring opening makes topologically bound cohesin dynamic on DNA to achieve replication-dependent cohesion in the S phase and to resolve cohesion in mitosis. Thus, the SMC ring opening could be a fundamental mechanism to modulate both cohesion and higher-order genome structure.

Abstract: During pregnancy, Toxoplasma gondii can triggers serious manifestations and potentially affect the fetal development. In this scenario, differences in susceptibility of trophoblast cells to T. gondii infection might be evaluated in order to establish new therapeutic approaches capable of interfering in the control of fetal infection by T. gondii. This study aimed to evaluate the susceptibility of cytotrophoblast, syncytiotrophoblast and extravillous trophoblast cells to T. gondii infection. Our data demonstrate that HTR-8/SVneo cells (extravillous trophoblast cells) present higher susceptibility to T. gondii infection when compared to syncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast cells, whereas syncytiotrophoblast was the cell type more resistant to the parasite infection. Also, cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast cells produced significantly more IL-6 than HTR-8/SVneo cells. On the other hand, HTR-8/SVneo cells showed higher ERK1/2 phosphorylation than cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast cells. ERK1/2 inhibition reduced T. gondii infection and increased IL-6 production in HTR-8/SVneo cells. Thus, it is plausible to conclude that the greater susceptibility of HTR-8/SVneo cells to infection by T. gondii is related to a higher ERK1/2 phosphorylation and lower levels of IL-6 in these cells compared to other cells, suggesting that these mediators may be important to favor the parasite infection in this type of trophoblastic population.

Abstract: Interleukin-8 (IL-8, CXCL8), a pro-inﬂammatory chemokine secreted by a variety of cell types, plays a critical role in the development of various immune diseases. Interactions between IL-8 and its receptor CXC receptor 1/2 (CXCR1/2) are known to promote chemotaxis and phagocytosis in many immune responses. In this study, we report the molecular characteristics and pharmacological activity of CXCR1 (MsCXCR1) in largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) and evaluated the functional involvement of MsCXCR1 in individuals infected with the pathogen Nocardia seriolae. MsCXCR1 was cloned into the pEGFP-N1 plasmid and the subcellular localization of MsCXCR1 on the cell membrane was verified in MsCXCR1-EGFP-expressing HEK293 cells. Following observation of receptor internalization and intracellular signaling detection, we further determined the functional interaction of secreted interleukin-8 (LcIL-8, the ligand for CXCR1 in large yellow croaker) and MsCXCR1 was further determined, and the ERK phosphorylation signal activation mediated by MsCXCR1 was demonstrated. Quantitative real-time PCR assays were conducted to analyze the transcriptional distribution of MsCXCR1 in various tissues of healthy and diseased largemouth bass. These results illustrate the significant elevation of MsCXCR1 expression in the head kidney, spleen and liver of M. salmoides, suggesting that MsCXCR1 was involved in the immune response in N. seriolae-infected largemouth bass and potentially affects the digestive function of this species.

Abstract: Ca2+ functions as an important intracellular signal for a wide range of cellular processes. These processes are selectively activated by controlled spatiotemporal dynamics of the free cytosolic Ca2+. Intracellular Ca2+ dynamics are regulated by numerous cellular parameters. Here, we established a new way to determine neuronal Ca2+ handling properties by combining the ‘added buffer’ approach [1] with perforated patch-clamp recordings [2]. Since the added buffer approach typically employs the standard whole-cell configuration for concentration-controlled Ca2+ indicator loading, it only allows for the reliable estimation of the immobile fraction of intracellular Ca2+ buffers. Furthermore, crucial components of intracellular signaling pathways are being washed out during prolonged whole-cell recordings, leading to cellular deterioration. By combining the added buffer approach with perforated patch-clamp recordings, these issues are circumvented, allowing the precise quantification of the cellular Ca2+ handling properties, including immobile as well as mobile Ca2+ buffers.

Abstract: Summary
The assembly of nascent proteins into multi-subunit complexes is a tightly regulated process that must occur at high fidelity to maintain cellular homeostasis. The ER membrane protein complex (EMC) is an essential insertase that requires seven membrane-spanning and two soluble cytosolic subunits to function. Here, we show that the kinase with no lysine 1 (WNK1), known for its role in hypertension and neuropathy, functions as an assembly factor for the human EMC. WNK1 uses a conserved amphipathic helix to stabilize the soluble subunit, EMC2, by binding to the EMC2–8 interface. Shielding this hydrophobic surface prevents promiscuous interactions of unassembled EMC2 and directly competes for binding of E3 ubiquitin ligases, permitting assembly. Depletion of WNK1 thus destabilizes both the EMC and its membrane protein clients. This work describes an unexpected role for WNK1 in protein biogenesis and defines the general requirements of an assembly factor that will apply across the proteome.

Abstract: Summary
The activation of cap-dependent translation in eukaryotes requires multisite, hierarchical phosphorylation of 4E-BP by the 1 MDa kinase mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). To resolve the mechanism of this hierarchical phosphorylation at the atomic level, we monitored by NMR spectroscopy the interaction of intrinsically disordered 4E binding protein isoform 1 (4E-BP1) with the mTORC1 subunit regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (Raptor). The N-terminal RAIP motif and the C-terminal TOR signaling (TOS) motif of 4E-BP1 bind separate sites in Raptor, resulting in avidity-based tethering of 4E-BP1. This tethering orients the flexible central region of 4E-BP1 toward the mTORC1 kinase site for phosphorylation. The structural constraints imposed by the two tethering interactions, combined with phosphorylation-induced conformational switching of 4E-BP1, explain the hierarchy of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation by mTORC1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mTORC1 recognizes both free and eIF4E-bound 4E-BP1, allowing rapid phosphorylation of the entire 4E-BP1 pool and efficient activation of translation. Finally, our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the differential rapamycin sensitivity of the 4E-BP1 phosphorylation sites.

Abstract: Summary
CD8 T cells play an essential role in defense against viral and bacterial infections and in tumor immunity. Deciphering T cell loss of functionality is complicated by the conspicuous heterogeneity of CD8 T cell states described across experimental and clinical settings. By carrying out a unified analysis of over 300 assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) experiments from 12 studies of CD8 T cells in cancer and infection, we defined a shared differentiation trajectory toward dysfunction and its underlying transcriptional drivers and revealed a universal early bifurcation of functional and dysfunctional T cell states across models. Experimental dissection of acute and chronic viral infection using single-cell ATAC (scATAC)-seq and allele-specific single-cell RNA (scRNA)-seq identified state-specific drivers and captured the emergence of similar TCF1+ progenitor-like populations at an early branch point, at which functional and dysfunctional T cells diverge. Our atlas of CD8 T cell states will facilitate mechanistic studies of T cell immunity and translational efforts.

Abstract: Summary
How global patterns emerge from individual cell behaviors is poorly understood. In the Xenopus embryonic epidermis, multiciliated cells (MCCs) are born in a random pattern within an inner mesenchymal layer and subsequently intercalate at regular intervals into an outer epithelial layer. Using video microscopy and mathematical modeling, we found that regular pattern emergence involves mutual repulsion among motile immature MCCs and affinity toward outer-layer intercellular junctions. Consistently, Arp2/3-mediated actin remodeling is required for MCC patterning. Mechanistically, we show that the Kit tyrosine kinase receptor, expressed in MCCs, and its ligand Scf, expressed in outer-layer cells, are both required for regular MCC distribution. Membrane-associated Scf behaves as a potent adhesive cue for MCCs, while its soluble form promotes their mutual repulsion. Finally, Kit expression is sufficient to confer order to a disordered heterologous cell population. This work reveals how a single signaling system can implement self-organized large-scale patterning.

Abstract: Summary
How cells adopt a different morphology to cope with stress is not well understood. Here, we show that budding yeast Ecm25 associates with polarized endocytic sites and interacts with the polarity regulator Cdc42 and several late-stage endocytic proteins via distinct regions, including an actin filament-binding motif. Deletion of ECM25 does not affect Cdc42 activity or cause any strong defects in fluid-phase and clathrin-mediated endocytosis but completely abolishes hydroxyurea-induced cell elongation. This phenotype is accompanied by depolarization of the spatiotemporally coupled exo-endocytosis in the bud cortex while maintaining the overall mother-bud polarity. These data suggest that Ecm25 provides an essential link between the polarization signal and the endocytic machinery to enable adaptive morphogenesis under stress conditions.

Abstract: Summary
In contrast to mammals, birds recover naturally from acquired hearing loss, which makes them an ideal model for inner ear regeneration research. Here, we present a validated single-cell RNA sequencing resource of the avian cochlea. We describe specific markers for three distinct types of sensory hair cells, including a previously unknown subgroup, which we call superior tall hair cells. We identify markers for the supporting cells associated with tall hair cells, which represent the facultative stem cells of the avian inner ear. Likewise, we present markers for supporting cells that are located below the short cochlear hair cells. We further infer spatial expression gradients of hair cell genes along the tonotopic axis of the cochlea. This resource advances neurobiology, comparative biology, and regenerative medicine by providing a basis for comparative studies with non-regenerating mammalian cochleae and for longitudinal studies of the regenerating avian cochlea.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles subjected to fission and fusion events. During mitosis, mitochondrial fission ensures equal distribution of mitochondria to daughter cells. If and how this process can actively drive mitotic progression remains largely unknown. Here, we discover a pathway linking mitochondrial fission to mitotic progression in mammalian cells. The mitochondrial fission factor (MFF), the main mitochondrial receptor for the Dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), is directly phosphorylated by Protein Kinase D (PKD) specifically during mitosis. PKD-dependent MFF phosphorylation is required and sufficient for mitochondrial fission in mitotic but not in interphasic cells. Phosphorylation of MFF is crucial for chromosome segregation and promotes cell survival by inhibiting adaptation of the mitotic checkpoint. Thus, PKD/MFF-dependent mitochondrial fission is critical for the maintenance of genome integrity during cell division.

Abstract: Summary
The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that controls cell cycle transitions. Its regulation by the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) is coordinated with the attachment of sister chromatids to the mitotic spindle. APC/C SUMOylation on APC4 ensures timely anaphase onset and chromosome segregation. To understand the structural and functional consequences of APC/C SUMOylation, we reconstituted SUMOylated APC/C for electron cryo-microscopy and biochemical analyses. SUMOylation of the APC/C causes a substantial rearrangement of the WHB domain of APC/C’s cullin subunit (APC2WHB). Although APC/CCdc20 SUMOylation results in a modest impact on normal APC/CCdc20 activity, repositioning APC2WHB reduces the affinity of APC/CCdc20 for the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), the effector of the SAC. This attenuates MCC-mediated suppression of APC/CCdc20 activity, allowing for more efficient ubiquitination of APC/CCdc20 substrates in the presence of the MCC. Thus, SUMOylation stimulates the reactivation of APC/CCdc20 when the SAC is silenced, contributing to timely anaphase onset.

Abstract: Summary
Type VI secretion system (T6SS) is widely distributed in Gram-negative bacteria and functions as a versatile protein export machinery that translocates effectors into eukaryotic or prokaryotic target cells. Growing evidence indicates that T6SS can deliver several effectors to promote bacterial survival in harmful environments through metal ion acquisition. Here, we report that the Pseudomonas aeruginosa H2-T6SS mediates molybdate (MoO42−) acquisition by secretion of a molybdate-binding protein, ModA. The expression of H2-T6SS genes is activated by the master regulator Anr and anaerobiosis. We also identified a ModA-binding protein, IcmP, an insulin-cleaving metalloproteinase outer membrane protein. The T6SS-ModA-IcmP system provides P. aeruginosa with a growth advantage in bacterial competition under anaerobic conditions and plays an important role in bacterial virulence. Overall, this study clarifies the role of T6SS in secretion of an anion-binding protein, emphasizing the fundamental importance of this bacterium using T6SS-mediated molybdate uptake to adapt to complex environmental conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is an aggressive and incurable childhood brain tumor for which new treatments are needed. CBL0137 is an anti-cancer compound developed from quinacrine that targets facilitates chromatin transcription (FACT), a chromatin remodeling complex involved in transcription, replication, and DNA repair. We show that CBL0137 displays profound cytotoxic activity against a panel of patient-derived DIPG cultures by restoring tumor suppressor TP53 and Rb activity. Moreover, in an orthotopic model of DIPG, treatment with CBL0137 significantly extends animal survival. The FACT subunit SPT16 is found to directly interact with H3.3K27M, and treatment with CBL0137 restores both histone H3 acetylation and trimethylation. Combined treatment of CBL0137 with the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat leads to inhibition of the Rb/E2F1 pathway and induction of apoptosis. The combination of CBL0137 and panobinostat significantly prolongs the survival of mice bearing DIPG orthografts, suggesting a potential treatment strategy for DIPG.

Abstract: Summary
Synaptic scaffold proteins (e.g., liprin-α, ELKS, RIM, and RIM-BP) orchestrate ion channels, receptors, and enzymes at presynaptic terminals to form active zones for neurotransmitter release. The underlying mechanism of the active zone assembly remains elusive. Here, we report that liprin-α proteins have the potential to oligomerize through the N-terminal coiled-coil region. Our structural and biochemical characterizations reveal that a gain-of-function mutation promotes the self-assembly of the coiled coils in liprin-α2 by disrupting intramolecular interactions and promoting intermolecular interactions. By enabling multivalent interactions with ELKS proteins, the oligomerized coiled-coil region of liprin-α2 enhances the phase separation of the ELKS N-terminal segment. We further show that liprin-α2, by regulating the interplay between two phase separations of ELKS and RIM/RIM-BP, controls the protein distributions. These results imply that the complicated protein-protein interactions allow liprin-α to function with the active zone scaffolds and compartmentalize protein assemblies to achieve comprehensive functions in the active zone.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular inflammasome activation causes caspase-1 cleavage of the pore-forming protein gasdermin D (GSDMD) with subsequent pyroptotic cell death and cytokine release. Here, we clarify the ambiguous role of the related family member gasdermin E (GSDME) in this process. Inflammasome stimulation in GSDMD-deficient cells led to apoptotic caspase cleavage of GSDME. Endogenous GSDME activation permitted sublytic, continuous interleukin-1β (IL-1β) release and membrane leakage, even in GSDMD-sufficient cells, whereas ectopic expression led to pyroptosis with GSDME oligomerization and complete liberation of IL-1β akin to GSDMD pyroptosis. We find that NLRP3 and NLRP1 inflammasomes ultimately rely concurrently on both gasdermins for IL-1β processing and release separately from their ability to induce cell lysis. Our study thus identifies GSDME as a conduit for IL-1β release independent of its ability to cause cell death.

Abstract: Summary
Age-related macular degeneration and other macular diseases result in the loss of light-sensing cone photoreceptors, causing irreversible sight impairment. Photoreceptor replacement may restore vision by transplanting healthy cells, which must form new synaptic connections with the recipient retina. Despite recent advances, convincing evidence of functional connectivity arising from transplanted human cone photoreceptors in advanced retinal degeneration is lacking. Here, we show restoration of visual function after transplantation of purified human pluripotent stem cell-derived cones into a mouse model of advanced degeneration. Transplanted human cones elaborate nascent outer segments and make putative synapses with recipient murine bipolar cells (BCs), which themselves undergo significant remodeling. Electrophysiological and behavioral assessments demonstrate restoration of surprisingly complex light-evoked retinal ganglion cell responses and improved light-evoked behaviors in treated animals. Stringent controls exclude alternative explanations, including material transfer and neuroprotection. These data provide crucial validation for photoreceptor replacement therapy and for the potential to rescue cone-mediated vision.

Abstract: Summary
Dendritic spines constitute the major compartments of excitatory post-synapses. They undergo activity-dependent enlargement, which is thought to increase the synaptic efficacy underlying learning and memory. The activity-dependent spine enlargement requires activation of signaling pathways leading to promotion of actin polymerization within the spines. However, the molecular machinery that suffices for that structural plasticity remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that shootin1a links polymerizing actin filaments in spines with the cell-adhesion molecules N-cadherin and L1-CAM, thereby mechanically coupling the filaments to the extracellular environment. Synaptic activation enhances shootin1a-mediated actin-adhesion coupling in spines. Promotion of actin polymerization is insufficient for the plasticity; the enhanced actin-adhesion coupling is required for polymerizing actin filaments to push against the membrane for spine enlargement. By integrating cell signaling, cell adhesion, and force generation into the current model of actin-based machinery, we propose molecular machinery that is sufficient to trigger the activity-dependent spine structural plasticity.

Abstract: Summary
An effective HIV-1 vaccine will likely need to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). Broad and potent VRC01-class bNAbs have been isolated from multiple infected individuals, suggesting that they could be reproducibly elicited by vaccination. Several HIV-1 envelope-derived germline-targeting immunogens have been designed to engage naive VRC01-class precursor B cells. However, they also present off-target epitopes that could hinder development of VRC01-class bNAbs. We characterize a panel of anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibodies (ai-mAbs) raised against inferred-germline (iGL) VRC01-class antibodies. By leveraging binding, structural, and B cell sorting data, we engineered a bispecific molecule derived from two ai-mAbs; one specific for VRC01-class heavy chains and one specific for VRC01-class light chains. The bispecific molecule preferentially activates iGL-VRC01 B cells in vitro and induces specific antibody responses in a murine adoptive transfer model with a diverse polyclonal B cell repertoire. This molecule represents an alternative non-envelope-derived germline-targeting immunogen that can selectively activate VRC01-class precursors in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Low-protein diets promote metabolic health in rodents and humans, and the benefits of low-protein diets are recapitulated by specifically reducing dietary levels of the three branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Here, we demonstrate that each BCAA has distinct metabolic effects. A low isoleucine diet reprograms liver and adipose metabolism, increasing hepatic insulin sensitivity and ketogenesis and increasing energy expenditure, activating the FGF21-UCP1 axis. Reducing valine induces similar but more modest metabolic effects, whereas these effects are absent with low leucine. Reducing isoleucine or valine rapidly restores metabolic health to diet-induced obese mice. Finally, we demonstrate that variation in dietary isoleucine levels helps explain body mass index differences in humans. Our results reveal isoleucine as a key regulator of metabolic health and the adverse metabolic response to dietary BCAAs and suggest reducing dietary isoleucine as a new approach to treating and preventing obesity and diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
Complete kinetic models are pervasive in chemistry but lacking in biological systems. We encoded the complete kinetics of infection for coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), a compact and fast-acting RNA virus. The model consists of separable, detailed modules describing viral binding-delivery, translation-replication, and encapsidation. Specific module activities are dampened by the type I interferon response to viral double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs), which is itself disrupted by viral proteinases. The experimentally validated kinetics uncovered that cleavability of the dsRNA transducer mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) becomes a stronger determinant of viral outcomes when cells receive supplemental interferon after infection. Cleavability is naturally altered in humans by a common MAVS polymorphism, which removes a proteinase-targeted site but paradoxically elevates CVB3 infectivity. These observations are reconciled with a simple nonlinear model of MAVS regulation. Modeling complete kinetics is an attainable goal for small, rapidly infecting viruses and perhaps viral pathogens more broadly. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the Supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
In addition to driving specific gene expression profiles, transcriptional regulators are becoming increasingly recognized for their capacity to modulate chromatin structure. GATA6 is essential for the formation of definitive endoderm; however, the molecular basis defining the importance of GATA6 to endoderm commitment is poorly understood. The members of the GATA family of transcription factors have the capacity to bind and alter the accessibility of chromatin. Using pluripotent stem cells as a model of human development, we reveal that GATA6 is integral to the establishment of the endoderm enhancer network via the induction of chromatin accessibility and histone modifications. We additionally identify the chromatin-modifying complexes that interact with GATA6, defining the putative mechanisms by which GATA6 modulates chromatin architecture. The identified GATA6-dependent processes further our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that underpin cell-fate decisions during formative development.

Abstract: Summary
STAG2, a cohesin family gene, is among the most recurrently mutated genes in cancer. STAG2 loss of function (LOF) is associated with aggressive behavior in Ewing sarcoma, a childhood cancer driven by aberrant transcription induced by the EWSR1-FLI1 fusion oncogene. Here, using isogenic Ewing cells, we show that, while STAG2 LOF profoundly changes the transcriptome, it does not significantly impact EWSR1-FLI1, CTCF/cohesin, or acetylated H3K27 DNA binding patterns. In contrast, it strongly alters the anchored dynamic loop extrusion process at boundary CTCF sites and dramatically decreases promoter-enhancer interactions, particularly affecting the expression of genes regulated by EWSR1-FLI1 at GGAA microsatellite neo-enhancers. Down-modulation of cis-mediated EWSR1-FLI1 activity, observed in STAG2-LOF conditions, is associated with enhanced migration and invasion properties of Ewing cells previously observed in EWSR1-FLI1low cells. Our study illuminates a process whereby STAG2-LOF fine-tunes the activity of an oncogenic transcription factor through altered CTCF-anchored loop extrusion and cis-mediated enhancer mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
Synaptic vesicle (SV) docking is a dynamic multi-stage process that is required for efficient neurotransmitter release in response to nerve impulses. Although the steady-state SV docking likely involves the cooperation of Synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1) and soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs), where and how the docking process initiates remains unknown. Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) can interact with Syt1 and SNAREs to contribute to vesicle exocytosis. In the present study, using the CRISPRi-mediated multiplex gene knockdown and 3D electron tomography approaches, we show that in mouse hippocampal synapses, SV docking initiates at ∼12 nm to the active zone (AZ) by Syt1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PI(4,5)P2 is the membrane partner of Syt1 to initiate SV docking, and disrupting their interaction could abolish the docking initiation. In contrast, the SNARE complex contributes only to the tight SV docking within 0–2 nm. Therefore, Syt1 interacts with PI(4,5)P2 to loosely dock SVs within 2–12 nm to the AZ in hippocampal neurons.

Abstract: Summary
Most extracellular matrices (ECMs) are known to be dissipative, exhibiting viscoelastic and often plastic behaviors. However, the influence of dissipation, in particular mechanical plasticity in 3D confining microenvironments, on cell motility is not clear. In this study, we develop a chemo-mechanical model for dynamics of invadopodia, the protrusive structures that cancer cells use to facilitate invasion, by considering myosin recruitment, actin polymerization, matrix deformation, and mechano-sensitive signaling pathways. We demonstrate that matrix dissipation facilitates invadopodia growth by softening ECMs over repeated cycles, during which plastic deformation accumulates via cyclic ratcheting. Our model reveals that distinct protrusion patterns, oscillatory or monotonic, emerge from the interplay of timescales for polymerization-associated extension and myosin recruitment dynamics. Our model predicts the changes in invadopodia dynamics upon inhibition of myosin, adhesions, and the Rho-Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) pathway. Altogether, our work highlights the role of matrix plasticity in invadopodia dynamics and can help design dissipative biomaterials to modulate cancer cell motility.

Abstract: Summary
The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway regulates key processes in synapse function, which are disrupted in early stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) by toxic-soluble amyloid-beta oligomers (Aβo). Here, we show that VEGF accumulates in and around Aβ plaques in postmortem brains of patients with AD and in APP/PS1 mice, an AD mouse model. We uncover specific binding domains involved in direct interaction between Aβo and VEGF and reveal that this interaction jeopardizes VEGFR2 activation in neurons. Notably, we demonstrate that VEGF gain of function rescues basal synaptic transmission, long-term potentiation (LTP), and dendritic spine alterations, and blocks long-term depression (LTD) facilitation triggered by Aβo. We further decipher underlying mechanisms and find that VEGF inhibits the caspase-3-calcineurin pathway responsible for postsynaptic glutamate receptor loss due to Aβo. These findings provide evidence for alterations of the VEGF pathway in AD models and suggest that restoring VEGF action on neurons may rescue synaptic dysfunction in AD.

Abstract: Summary
Tubulointerstitial abnormalities are predictive of the progression of diabetic kidney disease (DKD), and their targeting may be an effective means for prevention. Proximal tubular (PT) expression of kidney injury molecule (KIM)-1, as well as blood and urinary levels, are increased early in human diabetes and can predict the rate of disease progression. Here, we report that KIM-1 mediates PT uptake of palmitic acid (PA)-bound albumin, leading to enhanced tubule injury with DNA damage, PT cell-cycle arrest, interstitial inflammation and fibrosis, and secondary glomerulosclerosis. Such injury can be ameliorated by genetic ablation of the KIM-1 mucin domain in a high-fat-fed streptozotocin mouse model of DKD. We also identified TW-37 as a small molecule inhibitor of KIM-1-mediated PA-albumin uptake and showed in vivo in a kidney injury model in mice that it ameliorates renal inflammation and fibrosis. Together, our findings support KIM-1 as a new therapeutic target for DKD.

Abstract: Summary
The development of the cerebral cortex requires balanced expansion and differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs), which rely on precise regulation of gene expression. Because NPCs often exhibit transcriptional priming of cell-fate-determination genes, the ultimate output of these genes for fate decisions must be carefully controlled in a timely fashion at the post-transcriptional level, but how that is achieved is poorly understood. Here, we report that de novo missense variants in an RNA-binding protein CELF2 cause human cortical malformations and perturb NPC fate decisions in mice by disrupting CELF2 nucleocytoplasmic transport. In self-renewing NPCs, CELF2 resides in the cytoplasm, where it represses mRNAs encoding cell fate regulators and neurodevelopmental disorder-related factors. The translocation of CELF2 into the nucleus releases mRNA for translation and thereby triggers NPC differentiation. Our results reveal that CELF2 translocation between subcellular compartments orchestrates mRNA at the translational level to instruct cell fates in cortical development.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer cells function as primary architects of the tumor microenvironment. However, the molecular features of cancer cells that govern stromal cell phenotypes remain unclear. Here, we show that cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) heterogeneity is driven by lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cells at either end of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) spectrum. LUAD cells that have high expression of the EMT-activating transcription factor ZEB1 reprogram CAFs through a ZEB1-dependent secretory program and direct CAFs to the tips of invasive projections through a ZEB1-driven CAF repulsion process. The EMT, in turn, sensitizes LUAD cells to pro-metastatic signals from CAFs. Thus, CAFs respond to contextual cues from LUAD cells to promote metastasis.

Abstract: Orofacial clefts are the most common congenital craniofacial birth defects. They occur from a failure in cell proliferation and fusion of neural crest cells of the lip buds and/or palatal shelves. In this study, we investigate the genetic basis and molecular mechanisms in primary cells derived from a cleft and lip palate patient presenting van der Woude syndrome (VWS). Since mutations in the integrin genes are widely correlated with VWS, Interferon Regulatory Factor 6 (IRF6) screening was conducted in a cohort of 200 participants presenting with orofacial anomalies. Primary fibroblastic cells derived from the upper right gingiva and palatal regions were isolated and two cellular populations from two participants were obtained: a control with no cleft phenotype and a patient with a cleft phenotype typical of van der Woude syndrome (VWS). IRF6 targeted sequencing revealed mutations in two distinct families. Our results showed no alteration in the viability of the CLP/VWS patient cells, suggesting the phenotype associate with the disease is not secondary to a defect in cell proliferation. We did however detect a significant decrease in the migratory ability of the CLP with Van der Woude syndrome (CLP/VWS) patient cells, which could account for the phenotype. When compared to normal cells, patient cells showed a lack of polarization, which would account for their lack of mobility. Patient cells showed protrusions all around the cells and a lack of defined leading edge. This was reflected with actin staining, WAVE2 and Arp2 around the cell, and correlated with an increase in Rac1 activation. Consistently with the increase in Rac1 activation, patient cells showed a loss in the maturation of focal adhesions needed for contractility, which also accounts for the lack in cell migration. Our findings give increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms of VWS and expands the knowledge of van der Woude syndrome (VWS) occurrence by providing a strong molecular evidence that CLP with Van der Woude syndrome (CLP/VWS) phenotype is caused by a defect in normal physiological processes of cells.

Abstract: Background
Detergents are the most commonly used compounds in toothpastes due to their foaming and cleaning peoperties. This study aimed to investigate the effects of children’s toothpastes with different detergent content on the viability, the osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation potentials of human mesenchymal stem cells.
Methods
The necessary tissues for human periodontal ligament mesenchymal stem cells (hPDLMSCs) and human gingival mesenchymal stem cells (hGMSCs) isolation were obtained during extraction of 10 impacted third molar teeth. The viability of the cells stimulated with different concentratiaons of Colgate, Sensodyne, Splat, Nenedent, Perlodent toothpaste solutions and complete Dulbocco’s modified eagle medium (control group) were evaluated by using the flow cytometer. In addition, the osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation potential of human gingival and periodontal ligament mesenchymal stem cells exposed to toothpaste solutions were examined morphologically. Datas were analyzed with IBM SPSS V23. One way ANOVA test was used to determine the differences between the groups for multiple comparisons, while the Tukey post-hoc test was used for pair wise comparisons in determining which groups differed.
Results
A higher percentage of cell viability was detected in Control group at 20 %, 50 % and 80 % (p = 0.000) on hGMSCs. After the Control group, the highest cell viability ratios were observed in the detergent-free Splat group (p = 0.000) followed by the Sensodyne experimental group containing CABP (p = 0.000). While the cell viability rates in Nenedent group was found significantly higher than the Perlodent group at other concentrations except for 20 % concentration (p = 0.000). Colgate group had the lowest percentage of cell viability among the experimental groups at all concentrations on hPDMSCs (p = 0.000). The highest live cell ratios was detected in Control group (p = 0.000), followed by Splat and Sensodyne groups (p = 0.000). The cell viability ratios at 50 % concentration were higher in Perlodent group than Nenedent group (p = 0.000). The highest osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation potential of mesenchymal stem cells stimulated with different toothpaste was determined in Control and Splat group.
Conclusions
As a result of the findings, it was observed that toothpaste containing SLS had a more negative effect on the viability of the cells and the differentiation potentials than the other groups.
