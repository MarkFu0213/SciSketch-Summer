Abstract: Summary
Visualizing the location and dynamics of RNAs in live cells is key to understanding their function. Here, we identify two endonuclease-deficient, single-component programmable RNA-guided and RNA-targeting Cas13 RNases (dCas13s) that allow robust real-time imaging and tracking of RNAs in live cells, even when using single 20- to 27-nt-long guide RNAs. Compared to the aptamer-based MS2-MCP strategy, an optimized dCas13 system is user friendly, does not require genetic manipulation, and achieves comparable RNA-labeling efficiency. We demonstrate that the dCas13 system is capable of labeling NEAT1, SatIII, MUC4, and GCN4 RNAs and allows the study of paraspeckle-associated NEAT1 dynamics. Applying orthogonal dCas13 proteins or combining dCas13 and MS2-MCP allows dual-color imaging of RNAs in single cells. Further combination of dCas13 and dCas9 systems allows simultaneous visualization of genomic DNA and RNA transcripts in living cells.

Abstract: Summary
RNA-DNA hybrids are tightly regulated to ensure genome integrity. The RNase H enzymes RNase H1 and H2 contribute to chromosomal stability through the removal of RNA-DNA hybrids. Loss of RNase H2 function is implicated in human diseases of the nervous system and cancer. To better understand RNA-DNA hybrid dynamics, we focused on elucidating the regulation of the RNase H enzymes themselves. Using yeast as a model system, we demonstrate that RNase H1 and H2 are controlled in different manners. RNase H2 has strict cell cycle requirements, in that it has an essential function in G2/M for both R-loop processing and ribonucleotide excision repair. RNase H1, however, can function independently of the cell cycle to remove R-loops and appears to become activated in response to high R-loop loads. These results provide us with a more complete understanding of how and when RNA-DNA hybrids are acted upon by the RNase H enzymes.

Abstract: Summary
RNA localization is one mechanism neurons use to spatially and temporally regulate gene expression at synapses. Here, we test the hypothesis that cells exhibiting distinct forms of synaptic plasticity will have differences in dendritically localized RNAs. Indeed, we discover that each major subregion of the adult mouse hippocampus expresses a unique complement of dendritic RNAs. Specifically, we describe more than 1,000 differentially expressed dendritic RNAs, suggesting that RNA localization and local translation are regulated in a cell type-specific manner. Furthermore, by focusing Gene Ontology analyses on the plasticity-resistant CA2, we identify an enrichment of mitochondria-associated pathways in CA2 cell bodies and dendrites, and we provide functional evidence that these pathways differentially influence plasticity and mitochondrial respiration in CA2. These data indicate that differences in dendritic transcriptomes may regulate cell type-specific properties important for learning and memory and may influence region-specific differences in disease pathology.

Abstract: Summary
Compensation among paralogous transcription factors (TFs) confers genetic robustness of cellular processes, but how TFs dynamically respond to paralog depletion on a genome-wide scale in vivo remains incompletely understood. Using single and double conditional knockout of myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) family TFs in granule neurons of the mouse cerebellum, we find that MEF2A and MEF2D play functionally redundant roles in cerebellar-dependent motor learning. Although both TFs are highly expressed in granule neurons, transcriptomic analyses show MEF2D is the predominant genomic regulator of gene expression in vivo. Strikingly, genome-wide occupancy analyses reveal upon depletion of MEF2D, MEF2A occupancy robustly increases at a subset of sites normally bound to MEF2D. Importantly, sites experiencing compensatory MEF2A occupancy are concentrated within open chromatin and undergo functional compensation for genomic activation and gene expression. Finally, motor activity induces a switch from non-compensatory to compensatory MEF2-dependent gene regulation. These studies uncover genome-wide functional interdependency between paralogous TFs in the brain.

Abstract: Summary
Small cytoplasmic mRNP granules are implicated in mRNA transport, translational control, and decay. Using super-resolution microscopy and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, we analyzed the molecular composition and dynamics of single cytoplasmic YBX1_IMP1 mRNP granules in live cells. Granules appeared elongated and branched, with patches of IMP1 and YBX1 distributed along mRNA, reflecting the attachment of the two RNA-binding proteins in cis. Particles form at the nuclear pore and do not associate with translating ribosomes, so the mRNP is a repository for mRNAs awaiting translation. In agreement with the average number of mRNA-binding sites derived from crosslinked immunoprecipitation (CLIP) analyses, individual mRNPs contain 5–15 molecules of YBX1 and IMP1 and a single poly(A) tail identified by PABPC1. Taken together, we conclude that small cytoplasmic mRNP granules are mRNA singletons, thus depicting the cellular transcriptome. Consequently, expression of functionally related mRNAs in RNA regulons is unlikely to result from coordinated assembly.

Abstract: Summary
Local cues in the adult neurogenic niches dynamically regulate homeostasis in neural stem cells, whereas their identity and associated molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we show that corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), the major mediator of mammalian stress response and a key neuromodulator in the adult brain, is necessary for hippocampal neural stem cell (hiNSC) activity under physiological conditions. In particular, we demonstrate functionality of the CRH/CRH receptor (CRHR) system in mouse hiNSCs and conserved expression in humans. Most important, we show that genetic deficiency of CRH impairs hippocampal neurogenesis, affects spatial memory, and compromises hiNSCs’ responsiveness to environmental stimuli. These deficits have been partially restored by virus-mediated CRH expression. Additionally, we provide evidence that local disruption of the CRH/CRHR system reduces neurogenesis, while exposure of adult hiNSCs to CRH promotes neurogenic activity via BMP4 suppression. Our findings suggest a critical role of CRH in adult neurogenesis, independently of its stress-related systemic function.

Hypoxia Mediates Runt-Related Transcription Factor 2 Expression via Induction of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor in Periodontal Ligament Stem Cells,

Abstract: Periodontitis is characterized by the loss of periodontal tissues, especially alveolar bone. Common therapies cannot satisfactorily recover lost alveolar bone. Periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) possess the capacity of self-renewal and multilineage differentiation and are likely to recover lost alveolar bone. In addition, periodontitis is accompanied by hypoxia, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is a master transcription factor in the response to hypoxia. Thus, we aimed to ascertain how hypoxia affects runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), a key osteogenic marker, in the osteogenesis of PDLSCs. In this study, we found that hypoxia enhanced the protein expression of HIF-1α, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and RUNX2 ex vivo and in situ. VEGF is a target gene of HIF-1α, and the increased expression of VEGF and RUNX2 proteins was enhanced by cobalt chloride (CoCl2, 100 μmol/L), an agonist of HIF-1α, and suppressed by 3-(5′-hydroxymethyl-2′-furyl)-1-benzyl indazole (YC-1, 10 μmol/L), an antagonist of HIF-1α. In addition, VEGF could regulate the expression of RUNX2, as RUNX2 expression was enhanced by human VEGF (hVEGF165) and suppressed by VEGF siRNA. In addition, knocking down VEGF could decrease the expression of osteogenesis-related genes, i.e., RUNX2, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and type I collagen (COL1), and hypoxia could enhance the expression of ALP, COL1, and osteocalcin (OCN) in the early stage of osteogenesis of PDLSCs. Taken together, our results showed that hypoxia could mediate the expression of RUNX2 in PDLSCs via HIF-1α-induced VEGF and play a positive role in the early stage of osteogenesis of PDLSCs.

Abstract: Summary
CD4+ T cells play critical roles in directing immunity, both as T helper and as regulatory T (Treg) cells. Here, we demonstrate that hepatocytes can modulate T cell populations through engulfment of live CD4+ lymphocytes. We term this phenomenon enclysis to reflect the specific enclosure of CD4+ T cells in hepatocytes. Enclysis is selective for CD4+ but not CD8+ cells, independent of antigen-specific activation, and occurs in human hepatocytes in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo. Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) facilitates T cell early adhesion and internalization, whereas hepatocytes form membrane lamellipodia or blebs to mediate engulfment. T cell internalization is unaffected by wortmannin and Rho kinase inhibition. Hepatocytes engulf Treg cells more efficiently than non-Treg cells, but Treg cell-containing vesicles preferentially acidify overnight. Thus, enclysis is a biological process with potential effects on immunomodulation and opens a new field for research to fully understand CD4+ T cell dynamics in liver inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Dietary sugars, fructose and glucose, promote hepatic de novo lipogenesis and modify the effects of a high-fat diet (HFD) on the development of insulin resistance. Here, we show that fructose and glucose supplementation of an HFD exert divergent effects on hepatic mitochondrial function and fatty acid oxidation. This is mediated via three different nodes of regulation, including differential effects on malonyl-CoA levels, effects on mitochondrial size/protein abundance, and acetylation of mitochondrial proteins. HFD- and HFD plus fructose-fed mice have decreased CTP1a activity, the rate-limiting enzyme of fatty acid oxidation, whereas knockdown of fructose metabolism increases CPT1a and its acylcarnitine products. Furthermore, fructose-supplemented HFD leads to increased acetylation of ACADL and CPT1a, which is associated with decreased fat metabolism. In summary, dietary fructose, but not glucose, supplementation of HFD impairs mitochondrial size, function, and protein acetylation, resulting in decreased fatty acid oxidation and development of metabolic dysregulation.

Abstract: Summary
The highest frequencies of KRAS mutations occur in colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The ability to target downstream pathways mediating KRAS oncogenicity is limited by an incomplete understanding of the contextual cues modulating the signaling output of activated K-RAS. We performed mass spectrometry on mouse tissues expressing wild-type or mutant Kras to determine how tissue context and genetic background modulate oncogenic signaling. Mutant Kras dramatically altered the proteomes and phosphoproteomes of preneoplastic and neoplastic colons and pancreases in a context-specific manner. We developed an approach to statistically humanize the mouse networks with data from human cancer and identified genes within the humanized CRC and PDAC networks synthetically lethal with mutant KRAS. Our studies demonstrate the context-dependent plasticity of oncogenic signaling, identify non-canonical mediators of KRAS oncogenicity within the KRAS-regulated signaling network, and demonstrate how statistical integration of mouse and human datasets can reveal cross-species therapeutic insights.

Abstract: Summary
Thousands of noncoding somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) of unknown function are reported in tumors. Partitioning the genome according to cistromes reveals the enrichment of somatic SNVs in prostate tumors as opposed to adjacent normal tissue cistromes of master transcription regulators, including AR, FOXA1, and HOXB13. This parallels enrichment of prostate cancer genetic predispositions over these transcription regulators' tumor cistromes, exemplified at the 8q24 locus harboring both risk variants and somatic SNVs in cis-regulatory elements upregulating MYC expression. However, Massively Parallel Reporter Assays reveal that few SNVs can alter the transactivation potential of individual cis-regulatory elements. Instead, similar to inherited risk variants, SNVs accumulate in cistromes of master transcription regulators required for prostate cancer development.

Abstract: Summary
ATRX alterations occur at high frequency in neuroblastoma of adolescents and young adults. Particularly intriguing are the large N-terminal deletions of ATRX (Alpha Thalassemia/Mental Retardation, X-linked) that generate in-frame fusion (IFF) proteins devoid of key chromatin interaction domains, while retaining the SWI/SNF-like helicase region. We demonstrate that ATRX IFF proteins are redistributed from H3K9me3-enriched chromatin to promoters of active genes and identify REST as an ATRX IFF target whose activation promotes silencing of neuronal differentiation genes. We further show that ATRX IFF cells display sensitivity to EZH2 inhibitors, due to derepression of neurogenesis genes, including a subset of REST targets. Taken together, we demonstrate that ATRX structural alterations are not loss-of-function and put forward EZH2 inhibitors as a potential therapy for ATRX IFF neuroblastoma.

Abstract: Summary
Oriented cell division patterns tissues by modulating cell position and fate. While cell geometry, junctions, cortical tension, and polarity are known to control division orientation, relatively little is known about how these are coordinated to ensure robust patterning. Here, we systematically characterize cell division, volume, and shape changes during mouse pre-implantation development by in toto live imaging. The analysis leads us to a model in which the apical domain competes with cell shape to determine division orientation. Two key predictions of the model are verified experimentally: when outside cells of the 16-cell embryo are released from cell shape asymmetry, the axis of division is guided by the apical domain. Conversely, orientation cues from the apical domain can be overcome by applied shape asymmetry in the 8-cell embryo. We propose that such interplay between cell shape and polarity in controlling division orientation ensures robust patterning of the blastocyst and possibly other tissues.

Abstract: Summary
Regulation of chromatin structure is essential for controlling access of DNA to factors that require association with specific DNA sequences. Here we describe the development and validation of engineered chromatin remodeling proteins (E-ChRPs) for inducing programmable changes in nucleosome positioning by design. We demonstrate that E-ChRPs function both in vitro and in vivo to specifically reposition target nucleosomes and entire nucleosomal arrays. We show that induced, systematic positioning of nucleosomes over yeast Ume6 binding sites leads to Ume6 exclusion, hyperacetylation, and transcriptional induction at target genes. We also show that programmed global loss of nucleosome-free regions at Reb1 targets is generally inhibitory with mildly repressive transcriptional effects. E-ChRPs are compatible with multiple targeting modalities, including the SpyCatcher and dCas9 moieties, resulting in high versatility and enabling diverse future applications. Thus, engineered chromatin remodeling proteins represent a simple and robust means to probe and disrupt DNA-dependent processes in different chromatin contexts.

Abstract: Summary
Defective coronary network function and insufficient blood supply are both cause and consequence of myocardial infarction. Efficient revascularization after infarction is essential to support tissue repair and function. Zebrafish hearts exhibit a remarkable ability to regenerate, and coronary revascularization initiates within hours of injury, but how this process is regulated remains unknown. Here, we show that revascularization requires a coordinated multi-tissue response culminating with the formation of a complex vascular network available as a scaffold for cardiomyocyte repopulation. During a process we term “coronary-endocardial anchoring,” new coronaries respond by sprouting (1) superficially within the regenerating epicardium and (2) intra-ventricularly toward the activated endocardium. Mechanistically, superficial revascularization is guided by epicardial Cxcl12-Cxcr4 signaling and intra-ventricular sprouting by endocardial Vegfa signaling. Our findings indicate that the injury-activated epicardium and endocardium support cardiomyocyte replenishment initially through the guidance of coronary sprouting. Simulating this process in the injured mammalian heart should help its healing.

Abstract: Summary
Chronic kidney disease affects 10% of the population with notable differences in ethnic and sex-related susceptibility to kidney injury and disease. Kidney dysfunction leads to significant morbidity and mortality and chronic disease in other organ systems. A mouse-organ-centered understanding underlies rapid progress in human disease modeling and cellular approaches to repair damaged systems. To enhance an understanding of the mammalian kidney, we combined anatomy-guided single-cell RNA sequencing of the adult male and female mouse kidney with in situ expression studies and cell lineage tracing. These studies reveal cell diversity and marked sex differences, distinct organization and cell composition of nephrons dependent on the time of nephron specification, and lineage convergence, in which contiguous functionally related cell types are specified from nephron and collecting system progenitor populations. A searchable database, Kidney Cell Explorer (https://cello.shinyapps.io/kidneycellexplorer/), enables gene-cell relationships to be viewed in the anatomical framework of the kidney.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanisms establishing higher-order chromosome structures and their roles in gene regulation are elusive. We analyzed chromosome architecture during nematode X chromosome dosage compensation, which represses transcription via a dosage-compensation condensin complex (DCC) that binds hermaphrodite Xs and establishes megabase-sized topologically associating domains (TADs). We show that DCC binding at high-occupancy sites (rex sites) defines eight TAD boundaries. Single rex deletions disrupted boundaries, and single insertions created new boundaries, demonstrating that a rex site is necessary and sufficient to define DCC-dependent boundary locations. Deleting eight rex sites (8rexΔ) recapitulated TAD structure of DCC mutants, permitting analysis when chromosome-wide domain architecture was disrupted but most DCC binding remained. 8rexΔ animals exhibited no changes in X expression and lacked dosage-compensation mutant phenotypes. Hence, TAD boundaries are neither the cause nor the consequence of DCC-mediated gene repression. Abrogating TAD structure did, however, reduce thermotolerance, accelerate aging, and shorten lifespan, implicating chromosome architecture in stress responses and aging.

Abstract: Summary
In recent years, the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) cytokines have been identified as opposing regulators of the inflammatory program. However, the two cytokines are simultaneously present in the inflammatory milieu, and it is not clear how cells integrate these signals. In order to understand the regulatory networks associated with the GM/M-CSF signaling axis, we analyzed DNA methylation in human monocytes. Our results indicate that GM-CSF induces activation of the inflammatory program and extensive DNA methylation changes, while M-CSF-polarized cells are in a less differentiated state. This inflammatory program is mediated via JAK2 associated with the GM-CSF receptor and the downstream extracellular signal-regulated (ERK) signaling. However, PI3K signaling is associated with a negative regulatory loop of the inflammatory program and M-CSF autocrine signaling in GM-CSF-polarized monocytes. Our findings describe the regulatory networks associated with the GM/M-CSF signaling axis and how they contribute to the establishment of the inflammatory program associated with monocyte activation.

Abstract: Summary
During aging, visceral adiposity is often associated with alterations in adipose tissue (AT) leukocytes, inflammation, and metabolic dysfunction. However, the contribution of AT B cells in immunometabolism during aging is unexplored. Here, we show that aging is associated with an expansion of a unique population of resident non-senescent aged adipose B cells (AABs) found in fat-associated lymphoid clusters (FALCs). AABs are transcriptionally distinct from splenic age-associated B cells (ABCs) and show greater expansion in female mice. Functionally, whole-body B cell depletion restores proper lipolysis and core body temperature maintenance during cold stress. Mechanistically, the age-induced FALC formation, AAB, and splenic ABC expansion is dependent on the Nlrp3 inflammasome. Furthermore, AABs express IL-1R, and inhibition of IL-1 signaling reduces their proliferation and increases lipolysis in aging. These data reveal that inhibiting Nlrp3-dependent B cell accumulation can be targeted to reverse metabolic impairment in aging AT.

Abstract: Summary
Interleukin (IL)-17 signaling to the intestinal epithelium regulates the intestinal microbiome. Given the reported links between intestinal dysbiosis, bacterial translocation, and liver disease, we hypothesize that intestinal IL-17R signaling plays a critical role in mitigating hepatic inflammation. To test this, we study intestinal epithelium-specific IL-17RA-deficient mice in an immune-driven hepatitis model. At the naive state, these mice exhibit microbiome dysbiosis and increased translocation of bacterial products (CpG DNA), which drives liver IL-18 production. Upon disease induction, absence of enteric IL-17RA signaling exacerbates hepatitis and hepatocyte cell death. IL-18 is necessary for disease exacerbation and is associated with increased activated hepatic lymphocytes based on Ifng and Fasl expression. Thus, intestinal IL-17R regulates translocation of TLR9 ligands and constrains susceptibility to hepatitis. These data connect enteric Th17 signaling and the microbiome in hepatitis, with broader implications on the effects of impaired intestinal immunity and subsequent release of microbial products observed in other extra-intestinal pathologies.

Abstract: Summary
To evade immunity, many viruses express interferon antagonists that target STAT transcription factors as a major component of pathogenesis. Because of a lack of direct structural data, these interfaces are poorly understood. We report the structural analysis of full-length STAT1 binding to an interferon antagonist of a human pathogenic virus. The interface revealed by transferred cross-saturation NMR is complex, involving multiple regions in both the viral and cellular proteins. Molecular mapping analysis, combined with biophysical characterization and in vitro/in vivo functional assays, indicates that the interface is significant in disease caused by a pathogenic field-strain lyssavirus, with critical roles for contacts between the STAT1 coiled-coil/DNA-binding domains and specific regions within the viral protein. These data elucidate the potentially complex nature of IFN antagonist/STAT interactions, and the spatial relationship of protein interfaces that mediate immune evasion and replication, providing insight into how viruses can regulate these essential functions via single multifunctional proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Natural killer (NK) cell repertoires are made up of phenotypically distinct subsets with different functional properties. The molecular programs involved in maintaining NK cell repertoire diversity under homeostatic conditions remain elusive. Here, we show that subset-specific NK cell proliferation kinetics correlate with mTOR activation, and global repertoire diversity is maintained through a high degree of intra-lineage subset plasticity during interleukin (IL)-15-driven homeostatic proliferation in vitro. Slowly cycling sorted KIR+CD56dim NK cells with an induced CD57 phenotype display increased functional potential associated with increased transcription of genes involved in adhesion and immune synapse formation. Rapidly cycling cells upregulate NKG2A, display a general loss of functionality, and a transcriptional signature associated with increased apoptosis/cellular stress, actin-remodeling, and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation. These results shed light on the role of intra-lineage plasticity during NK cell homeostasis and suggest that the functional fate of the cell is tightly linked to the acquired phenotype and transcriptional reprogramming.

Abstract: Summary
Since 2013, H7N9 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) have caused more than 1,600 human infections, posing a threat to public health. An emerging concern is whether H7N9 AIVs will cause pandemics among humans. Molecular analysis of hemagglutinin (HA), which is a critical determinant of interspecies transmission, shows that the current H7N9 AIVs are still dual-receptor tropic, indicating limited human-to-human transmission potency. Mutagenesis and structural studies reveal that a G186V substitution is sufficient for H7N9 AIVs to acquire human receptor-binding capacity, and a Q226L substitution would favor binding to both avian and human receptors only when paired with A138/V186/P221 hydrophobic residues. These data suggest a different evolutionary route of H7N9 viruses compared to other AIV-subtype HAs.

Abstract: Summary
Phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1) plays a pivotal role in cancer metabolism and tumor progression via its metabolic activity and interaction with other proteins like α-smooth muscle actin (ACTA2). Allosteric regulation is considered to be an innovative strategy to discover a highly selective and potent inhibitor targeting PGAM1. Here, we identified a novel PGAM1 allosteric inhibitor, HKB99, via structure-based optimization. HKB99 acted to allosterically block conformational change of PGAM1 during catalytic process and PGAM1-ACTA2 interaction. HKB99 suppressed tumor growth and metastasis and overcame erlotinib resistance in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Mechanistically, HKB99 enhanced the oxidative stress and altered multiple signaling pathways including the activation of JNK/c-Jun and suppression of AKT and ERK. Collectively, the study highlights the potential of PGAM1 as a therapeutic target in NSCLC and reveals a distinct mechanism by which HKB99 inhibits both metabolic activity and nonmetabolic function of PGAM1 by allosteric regulation.

Abstract: Summary
The World Health Organization estimates that more than half of the world’s population is at risk for vector-borne diseases, including arboviruses. Because many arboviruses are mosquito borne, investigation of the insect immune response will help identify targets to reduce the spread of arboviruses. Here, we use a genetic screening approach to identify an insulin-like receptor as a component of the immune response to arboviral infection. We determine that vertebrate insulin reduces West Nile virus (WNV) replication in Drosophila melanogaster as well as WNV, Zika, and dengue virus titers in mosquito cells. Mechanistically, we show that insulin signaling activates the JAK/STAT, but not RNAi, pathway via ERK to control infection in Drosophila cells and Culex mosquitoes through an integrated immune response. Finally, we validate that insulin priming of adult female Culex mosquitoes through a blood meal reduces WNV infection, demonstrating an essential role for insulin signaling in insect antiviral responses to human pathogens.

Abstract: This study aimed to clarify the potentiality of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) transplantation with albendazole (ABZ) on the modulation of immune responses against hydatid cyst antigens and the regeneration of injured livers in experimentally infected rats. Three different antigens of hydatid cyst fluid (HCF), hydatid cyst protoscolex (HCP) and hydatid cyst germinal layer (HCG) were isolated and their antigenic potencies were determined. The ultrasound, immunological and pathological criteria were investigated. Counting of 80% confluence BM-MSC was 4.68 × 104 cells/cm2 with 92.24% viability. Final population doublings score was 65.31 that indicated proliferation and self-renewability. Phenotyping of BM-MSC showed expression of CD73 and CD29 without exhibition of CD34 and CD14. Ultrasound examination showed multiple hydatid cysts in liver with low blood flow and spleenomegaly 8 weeks’ post infection. No significant differences were noted in cystic diameter in uni-cyst liver at 2nd and 4th weeks following ABZ treatment while it was significantly decreased (P < 0.05) following transplantation of BM-MSC + ABZ treatment comparing to experimentally infected untreated group. Igs and IgG responses to the three antigens were significantly elevated while elevation in IgM response was only to HCG (P < 0.05). ABZ treatment accompanied with significant decrease in Igs and IgG titers against HCF and HCG only at 4th week post treatment (P < 0.05). However, Igs titer against HCF, HCP and HCG was significantly decreased at the 4th week following transplantation of BM-MSC + ABZ. Interestingly, the combination of BM-MSC + ABZ treatment resulted in reduction of Igs response to HCP to normal level as that of healthy control. Experimental infection resulted in elevation of TNF-α and IL-6 (P < 0.05) while, IL-4 and IL-10 decreased (P < 0.01). After transplantation of BM-MSC + ABZ treatment, serum TNF-α and IL-6 concentrations were reduced (P < 0.05) at both the 2nd and 4th weeks. However, IL-4 and IL-10 concentrations were significantly elevated (P < 0.05) only at 4th week following transplantation of BM-MSC + ABZ treatment. In conclusion, BM-MSC transplantation following ABZ administration can regenerate injured liver tissue without complete disappearance of hydatid cyst. In addition, it can modulate host protective humeral and cell mediated immune responses against hydatid cyst antigens. Therefore, the current study encourages to move to the step of performing clinical trials in humans.

Abstract: Summary
Opioids are powerful addictive agents that alter dopaminergic influence on reward signaling in medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the nucleus accumbens. Repeated opioid exposure triggers adaptive changes, shifting reward valuation to the allostatic state underlying tolerance. However, the cellular substrates and molecular logic underlying such allostatic changes are not well understood. Here, we report that the plasticity of dopamine-induced cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling in MSNs serves as a cellular substrate for drug-induced allostatic adjustments. By recording cAMP responses to optically evoked dopamine in brain slices from mice subjected to various opioid exposure paradigms, we define profound neuronal-type-specific adaptations. We find that opioid exposure pivots the initial hyper-responsiveness of D1-MSNs toward D2-MSN dominance as dependence escalates. Presynaptic dopamine transporters and postsynaptic phosphodiesterases critically enable cell-specific adjustments of cAMP that control the balance between opponent D1-MSN and D2-MSN channels. We propose a quantitative model of opioid-induced allostatic adjustments in cAMP signal strength that balances circuit activity.

Abstract: Summary
Life on Earth emerged in a hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-rich environment eons ago and with it protein persulfidation mediated by H2S evolved as a signaling mechanism. Protein persulfidation (S-sulfhydration) is a post-translational modification of reactive cysteine residues, which modulate protein structure and/or function. Persulfides are difficult to label and study due to their reactivity and similarity with cysteine. Here, we report a facile strategy for chemoselective persulfide bioconjugation using dimedone-based probes, to achieve highly selective, rapid, and robust persulfide labeling in biological samples with broad utility. Using this method, we show persulfidation is an evolutionarily conserved modification and waves of persulfidation are employed by cells to resolve sulfenylation and prevent irreversible cysteine overoxidation preserving protein function. We report an age-associated decline in persulfidation that is conserved across evolutionary boundaries. Accordingly, dietary or pharmacological interventions to increase persulfidation associate with increased longevity and improved capacity to cope with stress stimuli.

Abstract: Summary
In the eukaryotic replisome, DNA unwinding by the Cdc45-MCM-Go-Ichi-Ni-San (GINS) (CMG) helicase requires a hexameric ring-shaped ATPase named minichromosome maintenance (MCM), which spools single-stranded DNA through its central channel. Not all six ATPase sites are required for unwinding; however, the helicase mechanism is unknown. We imaged ATP-hydrolysis-driven translocation of the CMG using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and found that the six MCM subunits engage DNA using four neighboring protomers at a time, with ATP binding promoting DNA engagement. Morphing between different helicase states leads us to suggest a non-symmetric hand-over-hand rotary mechanism, explaining the asymmetric requirements of ATPase function around the MCM ring of the CMG. By imaging of a higher-order replisome assembly, we find that the Mrc1-Csm3-Tof1 fork-stabilization complex strengthens the interaction between parental duplex DNA and the CMG at the fork, which might support the coupling between DNA translocation and fork unwinding.

Abstract: Summary
Many positive-strand RNA viruses remodel the endomembrane to form specialized replication organelles. However, knowledge regarding whether negative-strand RNA viruses take advantage of intracellular membranes for replication is limited. Here we show that a negative-strand RNA virus, human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3), remodels the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane to form inclusion bodies (IBs), whereby the phosphoprotein (P) of HPIV3 recruits phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase beta (PI4KB) to IBs to generate PI4P, creating a PI4P-enriched microenvironment to promote HPIV3 replication. In addition, we find that human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) also takes advantage of the ER to form IBs and that these IBs are also enriched with PI4P. The nucleoprotein of HRSV recruits PI4KB to IBs. These results suggest that paramyxoviruses also exploit the host endomembrane to form IBs and that PI4KB is recruited by viral proteins to enrich IBs with PI4P to facilitate viral replication.

Abstract: Summary
There is a growing consensus that Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves failure of the homeostatic machinery, which underlies the firing stability of neural circuits. What are the culprits leading to neuron firing instability? The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is central to AD pathogenesis, and we recently showed that its intracellular domain (AICD) could modify synaptic signal integration. We now hypothesize that AICD modifies neuron firing activity, thus contributing to the disruption of memory processes. Using cellular, electrophysiological, and behavioral techniques, we show that pathological AICD levels weaken CA1 neuron firing activity through a gene-transcription-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, increased AICD production in hippocampal neurons modifies oscillatory activity, specifically in the γ-frequency range, and disrupts spatial memory task. Collectively, our data suggest that AICD pathological levels, observed in AD mouse models and in human patients, might contribute to progressive neuron homeostatic failure, driving the shift from normal aging to AD.

Abstract: Summary
The death receptor CD95 is expressed in every cancer cell, thus providing a promising tool to target cancer. Activation of CD95 can, however, lead to apoptosis or proliferation. Yet the molecular determinants of CD95’s mode of action remain unclear. Here, we identify an optimal distance between CD95Ligand molecules that enables specific clustering of receptor-ligand pairs, leading to efficient CD95 activation. Surprisingly, efficient CD95 activation leads to apoptosis in cancer cells in vitro and increased tumor growth in vivo. We show that allowing a 3D aggregation of cancer cells in vitro switches the apoptotic response to proliferation. Indeed, we demonstrate that the absence or presence of cell-cell contacts dictates the cell response to CD95. Cell contacts increase global levels of phosphorylated tyrosines, including CD95’s tyrosine. A tyrosine-to-alanine CD95 mutant blocks proliferation in cells in contact. Our study sheds light into the regulatory mechanism of CD95 activation that can be further explored for anti-cancer therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Chemokine-guided cell migration is pivotal for many immunological and developmental processes. How chemokine receptor signaling persists to guarantee sustained directional migration despite receptor desensitization and internalization remains poorly understood. Here, we uncover a function for an intracellular pool of the chemokine receptor CCR7 present in human dendritic cells and cellular model systems. We find that CCR7 signaling, initiated at the plasma membrane, is translocated by joint trafficking of β-arrestin and Src kinase to endomembrane-residing CCR7. There, Src tyrosine phosphorylates CCR7, required for the recruitment of Vav1 to form an endomembrane-residing multi-protein signaling complex comprising CCR7, the RhoGEF Vav1, and its effector, Rac1. Interfering with vesicular trafficking affects CCR7-driven cell migration, whereas CCR7:Vav1 interaction at endomembranes is essential for local Rac1 recruitment to CCR7. Photoactivation of Rac1 at endomembranes leads to lamellipodia formation at the cell’s leading edge, supporting the role of sustained endomembrane signaling in guiding cell migration.

Abstract: Summary
mTORC2 controls glucose and lipid metabolism, but the mechanisms are unclear. Here, we show that conditionally deleting the essential mTORC2 subunit Rictor in murine brown adipocytes inhibits de novo lipid synthesis, promotes lipid catabolism and thermogenesis, and protects against diet-induced obesity and hepatic steatosis. AKT kinases are the canonical mTORC2 substrates; however, deleting Rictor in brown adipocytes appears to drive lipid catabolism by promoting FoxO1 deacetylation independently of AKT, and in a pathway distinct from its positive role in anabolic lipid synthesis. This facilitates FoxO1 nuclear retention, enhances lipid uptake and lipolysis, and potentiates UCP1 expression. We provide evidence that SIRT6 is the FoxO1 deacetylase suppressed by mTORC2 and show an endogenous interaction between SIRT6 and mTORC2 in both mouse and human cells. Our findings suggest a new paradigm of mTORC2 function filling an important gap in our understanding of this more mysterious mTOR complex.

Abstract: Summary
Certain Gram-negative bacteria use the type VI secretion system (T6SS) to kill and lyse competing bacteria. Here, we show that the T6SS-dependent lysis of prey cells by the naturally competent Acinetobacter baylyi results in the extensive filamentation of a subpopulation of A. baylyi cells. Filamentation is dependent on the release of DNA from the prey and its uptake by the competence system. The analysis of A. baylyi transcriptome and the response of transcriptional reporters suggest that the uptake of DNA results in the upregulation of the SOS response, which often leads to cell-division arrest. Long-term competition between competent and non-competent strains shows that the strain lacking the DNA uptake machinery outcompetes the parental strain only in the presence of the T6SS-dependent lysis of prey cells. Our data suggest that the cost of the induced SOS response may drive the selection of tight regulation or the loss of DNA uptake in bacteria capable of lysing their competitors.

Abstract: Summary
In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), spliceosomal proteins with critical roles in RNA processing aberrantly aggregate and mislocalize to Tau neurofibrillary tangles. We test the hypothesis that Tau-spliceosome interactions disrupt pre-mRNA splicing in AD. In human postmortem brain with AD pathology, Tau coimmunoprecipitates with spliceosomal components. In Drosophila, pan-neuronal Tau expression triggers reductions in multiple core and U1-specific spliceosomal proteins, and genetic disruption of these factors, including SmB, U1-70K, and U1A, enhances Tau-mediated neurodegeneration. We further show that loss of function in SmB, encoding a core spliceosomal protein, causes decreased survival, progressive locomotor impairment, and neuronal loss, independent of Tau toxicity. Lastly, RNA sequencing reveals a similar profile of mRNA splicing errors in SmB mutant and Tau transgenic flies, including intron retention and non-annotated cryptic splice junctions. In human brains, we confirm cryptic splicing errors in association with neurofibrillary tangle burden. Our results implicate spliceosome disruption and the resulting transcriptome perturbation in Tau-mediated neurodegeneration in AD.

Abstract: Summary
Conventional methods for single-cell genome sequencing are limited with respect to uniformity and throughput. Here, we describe sci-L3, a single-cell sequencing method that combines combinatorial indexing (sci-) and linear (L) amplification. The sci-L3 method adopts a 3-level (3) indexing scheme that minimizes amplification biases while enabling exponential gains in throughput. We demonstrate the generalizability of sci-L3 with proof-of-concept demonstrations of single-cell whole-genome sequencing (sci-L3-WGS), targeted sequencing (sci-L3-target-seq), and a co-assay of the genome and transcriptome (sci-L3-RNA/DNA). We apply sci-L3-WGS to profile the genomes of >10,000 sperm and sperm precursors from F1 hybrid mice, mapping 86,786 crossovers and characterizing rare chromosome mis-segregation events in meiosis, including instances of whole-genome equational chromosome segregation. We anticipate that sci-L3 assays can be applied to fully characterize recombination landscapes, to couple CRISPR perturbations and measurements of genome stability, and to other goals requiring high-throughput, high-coverage single-cell sequencing.

Abstract: Summary
The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a potent metabolic regulator and a major drug target. While GR is known to play integral roles in circadian biology, its rhythmic genomic actions have never been characterized. Here we mapped GR’s chromatin occupancy in mouse livers throughout the day and night cycle. We show how GR partitions metabolic processes by time-dependent target gene regulation and controls circulating glucose and triglycerides differentially during feeding and fasting. Highlighting the dominant role GR plays in synchronizing circadian amplitudes, we find that the majority of oscillating genes are bound by and depend on GR. This rhythmic pattern is altered by high-fat diet in a ligand-independent manner. We find that the remodeling of oscillatory gene expression and postprandial GR binding results from a concomitant increase of STAT5 co-occupancy in obese mice. Altogether, our findings highlight GR’s fundamental role in the rhythmic orchestration of hepatic metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
H3K27M mutations resulting in epigenetic dysfunction are frequently observed in diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPGs), an incurable pediatric cancer. We conduct a CRISPR screen revealing that knockout of KDM1A encoding lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) sensitizes DIPG cells to histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. Consistently, Corin, a bifunctional inhibitor of HDACs and LSD1, potently inhibits DIPG growth in vitro and in xenografts. Mechanistically, Corin increases H3K27me3 levels suppressed by H3K27M histones, and simultaneously increases HDAC-targeted H3K27ac and LSD1-targeted H3K4me1 at differentiation-associated genes. Corin treatment induces cell death, cell-cycle arrest, and a cellular differentiation phenotype and drives transcriptional changes correlating with increased survival time in DIPG patients. These data suggest a strategy for treating DIPG by simultaneously inhibiting LSD1 and HDACs.

Abstract: Summary
We characterized the landscape and drug sensitivity of ERBB2 (HER2) mutations in cancers. In 11 datasets (n = 211,726), ERBB2 mutational hotspots varied across 25 tumor types. Common HER2 mutants yielded differential sensitivities to eleven EGFR/HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in vitro, and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that mutants with a reduced drug-binding pocket volume were associated with decreased affinity for larger TKIs. Overall, poziotinib was the most potent HER2 mutant-selective TKI tested. Phase II clinical testing in ERBB2 exon 20-mutant non-small cell lung cancer resulted in a confirmed objective response rate of 42% in the first 12 evaluable patients. In pre-clinical models, poziotinib upregulated HER2 cell-surface expression and potentiated the activity of T-DM1, resulting in complete tumor regression with combination treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the key role that antibodies play in protection, the cellular processes mediating the acquisition of humoral immunity against malaria are not fully understood. Using an infection model of severe malaria, we find that germinal center (GC) B cells upregulate the transcription factor T-bet during infection. Molecular and cellular analyses reveal that T-bet in B cells is required not only for IgG2c switching but also favors commitment of B cells to the dark zone of the GC. T-bet was found to regulate the expression of Rgs13 and CXCR3, both of which contribute to the impaired GC polarization observed in the absence of T-bet, resulting in reduced IghV gene mutations and lower antibody avidity. These results demonstrate that T-bet modulates GC dynamics, thereby promoting the differentiation of B cells with increased affinity for antigen.

Abstract: Summary
Most animals exhibit mirror-symmetric body plans, yet the molecular constituents from which they are formed are often chiral. In planarian flatworms, centrioles are arranged in a bilaterally symmetric pattern across the ventral epidermis. Here, we found that this pattern is generated by a network of centrioles with prominent chiral asymmetric properties. We identify centriole components required for establishing asymmetric connections between centrioles and balancing their effects to align centrioles along polarity fields. SMED-ODF2, SMED-VFL1, and SMED-VFL3 affect the assembly of centriole appendages that tether cytoskeletal connectors to position the centrioles. We further show that the medio-lateral polarization of centrioles relies on mechanisms that are partly distinct on the left and right sides of the planarian body. Our findings shed light on how bilaterally symmetrical patterns can emerge from chiral cellular organizations.

Abstract: Summary
Epithelial tissues typically form lumina. In mammalian blastocysts, in which the first embryonic lumen forms, many studies have investigated how the cell lineages are specified through genetics and signaling, whereas potential roles of the fluid lumen have yet to be investigated. We discover that in mouse pre-implantation embryos at the onset of lumen formation, cytoplasmic vesicles are secreted into intercellular space. The segregation of epiblast and primitive endoderm directly follows lumen coalescence. Notably, pharmacological and biophysical perturbation of lumen expansion impairs the specification and spatial segregation of primitive endoderm cells within the blastocyst. Luminal deposition of FGF4 expedites fate specification and partially rescues the reduced specification in blastocysts with smaller cavities. Combined, our results suggest that blastocyst lumen expansion plays a critical role in guiding cell fate specification and positioning, possibly mediated by luminally deposited FGF4. Lumen expansion may provide a general mechanism for tissue pattern formation.

Abstract: Summary
Type I interferons (IFNs) play important roles in antitumor immunity. We generated IFN-α-producing cells by genetically engineered induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived proliferating myeloid cells (iPSC-pMCs). Local administration of IFN-α-producing iPSC-pMCs (IFN-α-iPSC-pMCs) alters the tumor microenvironment and propagates the molecular signature associated with type I IFN. The gene-modified cell actively influences host XCR1+ dendritic cells to enhance CD8+ T cell priming, resulting in CXCR3-dependent and STING-IRF3 pathway-independent systemic tumor control. Administration of IFN-α-iPSC-pMCs in combination with immune checkpoint blockade overcomes resistance to single-treatment modalities and generates long-lasting antitumor immunity. These preclinical data suggest that IFN-α-iPSC-pMCs might constitute effective immune-stimulating agents for cancer that are refractory to checkpoint blockade.

Abstract: During membrane depolarization the voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) activates gene expression in excitable cells by means of a signal-transduction pathway termed excitation transcription (ET) coupling. The L-type calcium channel Cav1.2 can drive nuclear activity by either the ERK-CREB pathway, the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) cascade, or via the Ca2+-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin. The ERK-CREB pathway mediates nuclear activity via a direct interaction of the intracellular β subunit of VGCC with the Ras/GRF1 complex. Here we show that ET coupling in HEK293 cells transfected with wt Cav1.2 or the Timothy mutant Cav1.2G406R is mediated by substituting Ca2+ with the impermeable lanthanum (La3+). In the absence of extracellular Ca2+ or La3+, ET coupling was not triggered. This implies that cation occupancy of the selectivity filter, as opposed to calcium influx, plays an essential role in depolarization triggered signaling to the nucleus. ET coupling triggered by membrane depolarization in Cav1.2 transfected HEK293 cells and neuroendocrine PC12 cells was also supported by substituting Ba2+ for Ca2+ as the charge carrier. Since Ba2+ ions do not bind to calmodulin this implies activation of ET coupling via a Ca2+/calmodulin-independent pathway. Together, these results suggest a model whereby nuclear signaling through the ERK-CREB pathway is driven by voltage-dependent conformational change that requires channel pore occupancy and is Ca2+ influx-independent. This model is also consistent with the previous observation that ET coupling can be driven by the Ca2+-impermeable Cav1.2L745P mutant. Thus, the conversion of synaptic stimuli to transcriptional activation is mediated by the metabotropic function (Ca2+-inflow independent) of Cav1.2, similar to the ion-influx independent depolarization-triggered transmitter release and transcription activation mediated by the NMDA receptors.

Abstract: Summary
Precisely controlling the excitatory and inhibitory balance is crucial for the stability and information-processing ability of neuronal networks. However, the molecular mechanisms maintaining this balance during ongoing sensory experiences are largely unclear. We show that Nogo-A signaling reciprocally regulates excitatory and inhibitory transmission. Loss of function for Nogo-A signaling through S1PR2 rapidly increases GABAAR diffusion, thereby decreasing their number at synaptic sites and the amplitude of GABAergic mIPSCs at CA3 hippocampal neurons. This increase in GABAAR diffusion rate is correlated with an increase in Ca2+ influx and requires the calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation of the γ2 subunit at serine 327. These results suggest that Nogo-A signaling rapidly strengthens inhibitory GABAergic transmission by restricting the diffusion dynamics of GABAARs. Together with the observation that Nogo-A signaling regulates excitatory transmission in an opposite manner, these results suggest a crucial role for Nogo-A signaling in modulating the excitation and inhibition balance to restrict synaptic plasticity.

Abstract: Summary
The movement of ribosomes on mRNA is often interrupted by secondary structures that present mechanical barriers and play a central role in translation regulation. We investigate how ribosomes couple their internal conformational changes with the activity of translocation factor EF-G to unwind mRNA secondary structures using high-resolution optical tweezers with single-molecule fluorescence capability. We find that hairpin opening occurs during EF-G-catalyzed translocation and is driven by the forward rotation of the small subunit head. Modulating the magnitude of the hairpin barrier by force shows that ribosomes respond to strong barriers by shifting their operation to an alternative 7-fold-slower kinetic pathway prior to translocation. Shifting into a slow gear results from an allosteric switch in the ribosome that may allow it to exploit thermal fluctuations to overcome mechanical barriers. Finally, we observe that ribosomes occasionally open the hairpin in two successive sub-codon steps, revealing a previously unobserved translocation intermediate.

Abstract: Summary
Full-length transcription in the majority of human genes depends on U1 snRNP (U1) to co-transcriptionally suppress transcription-terminating premature 3′ end cleavage and polyadenylation (PCPA) from cryptic polyadenylation signals (PASs) in introns. However, the mechanism of this U1 activity, termed telescripting, is unknown. Here, we captured a complex, comprising U1 and CPA factors (U1-CPAFs), that binds intronic PASs and suppresses PCPA. U1-CPAFs are distinct from U1-spliceosomal complexes; they include CPA’s three main subunits, CFIm, CPSF, and CstF; lack essential splicing factors; and associate with transcription elongation and mRNA export complexes. Telescripting requires U1:pre-mRNA base-pairing, which can be disrupted by U1 antisense oligonucleotide (U1 AMO), triggering PCPA. U1 AMO remodels U1-CPAFs, revealing changes, including recruitment of CPA-stimulating factors, that explain U1-CPAFs’ switch from repressive to activated states. Our findings outline this U1 telescripting mechanism and demonstrate U1’s unique role as central regulator of pre-mRNA processing and transcription.

Abstract: Summary
Reprogramming somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is accompanied by dramatic changes in epigenetic programs, including silencing of endogenous and exogenous retroviruses. Here, we utilized replication-defective and persistent Sendai virus (SeVdp)-based vectors to monitor retroviral silencing during reprogramming. We observed that retroviral silencing occurred at an early reprogramming stage without a requirement for KLF4 or the YY1-binding site in the retroviral genome. Insertional chromatin immunoprecipitation (iChIP) enabled us to isolate factors assembled on the silenced provirus, including components of inhibitor of histone acetyltransferase (INHAT), which includes the SET/TAF-I oncoprotein. Knockdown of SET/TAF-I in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) diminished retroviral silencing during reprogramming, and overexpression of template activating factor-I α (TAF-Iα), a SET/TAF-I isoform predominant in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), reinforced retroviral silencing by an SeVdp-based vector that is otherwise defective in retroviral silencing. Our results indicate an important role for TAF-Iα in retroviral silencing during reprogramming.

The proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-17 (IL-17) is implicated in pain regulation. However, the synaptic mechanisms by which IL-17 regulates pain transmission are unknown. Here, we report that glia-produced IL-17 suppresses inhibitory synaptic transmission in the spinal cord pain circuit and drives chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain. We find that IL-17 not only enhances excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) but also suppresses inhibitory postsynaptic synaptic currents (IPSCs) and GABA-induced currents in lamina IIo somatostatin-expressing neurons in mouse spinal cord slices. IL-17 mainly expresses in spinal cord astrocytes, and its receptor IL-17R is detected in somatostatin-expressing neurons. Selective knockdown of IL-17R in spinal somatostatin-expressing interneurons reduces paclitaxel-induced hypersensitivity. Overexpression of IL-17 in spinal astrocytes is sufficient to induce mechanical allodynia in naive animals. In dorsal root ganglia, IL-17R expression in nociceptive sensory neurons is sufficient and required for inducing neuronal hyperexcitability after paclitaxel. Together, our data show that IL-17/IL-17R mediate neuron-glial interactions and neuronal hyperexcitability in chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.

Abstract: Summary
Branched-chain alcohols are attractive advanced biofuels; however, their cellular toxicity is an obstacle to engineering microbes to produce them at high titers. We performed genome-wide screens on the Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene deletion library to identify cell systems involved in isobutanol-specific tolerance. Deletion of pentose phosphate pathway genes GND1 or ZWF1 causes hypersensitivity to isobutanol but not to ethanol. By contrast, deletion of GLN3 increases yeast tolerance specifically to branched-chain alcohols. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that isobutanol induces a nitrogen starvation response via GLN3 and GCN4, upregulating amino acid biosynthesis and nitrogen scavenging while downregulating glycolysis, cell wall biogenesis, and membrane lipid biosynthesis. Disruption of this response by deleting GLN3 is enough to enhance tolerance and boost isobutanol production 4.9-fold in engineered strains. This study illustrates how adaptive mechanisms to tolerate stress can lead to toxicity in microbial fermentations for chemical production and how genetic interventions can boost production by evading such mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
Homologous chromosomes colocalize to regulate gene expression in processes including genomic imprinting, X-inactivation, and transvection. In Drosophila, homologous chromosomes pair throughout development, promoting transvection. The “button” model of pairing proposes that specific regions along chromosomes pair with high affinity. Here, we identify buttons interspersed across the fly genome that pair with their homologous sequences, even when relocated to multiple positions in the genome. A majority of transgenes that span a full topologically associating domain (TAD) function as buttons, but not all buttons contain TADs. Additionally, buttons are enriched for insulator protein clusters. Fragments of buttons do not pair, suggesting that combinations of elements within a button are required for pairing. Pairing is necessary but not sufficient for transvection. Additionally, pairing and transvection are stronger in some cell types than in others, suggesting that pairing strength regulates transvection efficiency between cell types. Thus, buttons pair homologous chromosomes to facilitate cell-type-specific interchromosomal gene regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1) is a secreted Wnt antagonist with a well-established role in head induction during development. Numerous studies have emerged implicating Dkk1 in various malignancies and neurodegenerative diseases through an unknown mechanism. Using zebrafish gastrulation as a model for collective cell migration, we unveil such a mechanism, identifying a role for Dkk1 in control of cell connectivity and polarity in vivo, independent of its known function. We find that Dkk1 localizes to adhesion complexes at the plasma membrane and regions of concentrated actomyosin, suggesting a direct involvement in regulation of local cell adhesion. Our results show that Dkk1 represses cell polarization and integrity of cell-cell adhesion, independently of its impact on β-catenin protein degradation. Concurrently, Dkk1 prevents nuclear localization of β-catenin by restricting its distribution to a discrete submembrane pool. We propose that redistribution of cytosolic β-catenin by Dkk1 concomitantly drives repression of cell adhesion and inhibits β-catenin-dependent transcriptional output.

Abstract: Summary
Intrathymic T cell development converts multipotent precursors to committed pro-T cells, silencing progenitor genes while inducing T cell genes, but the underlying steps have remained obscure. Single-cell profiling was used to define the order of regulatory changes, employing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) for full-transcriptome analysis, plus sequential multiplexed single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (seqFISH) to quantitate functionally important transcripts in intrathymic precursors. Single-cell cloning verified high T cell precursor frequency among the immunophenotypically defined “early T cell precursor” (ETP) population; a discrete committed granulocyte precursor subset was also distinguished. We established regulatory phenotypes of sequential ETP subsets, confirmed initial co-expression of progenitor with T cell specification genes, defined stage-specific relationships between cell cycle and differentiation, and generated a pseudotime model from ETP to T lineage commitment, supported by RNA velocity and transcription factor perturbations. This model was validated by developmental kinetics of ETP subsets at population and clonal levels. The results imply that multilineage priming is integral to T cell specification.

Abstract: Summary
Technological improvements enable single-cell epigenetic analyses of organ development. We reasoned that high-resolution single-cell chromatin accessibility mapping would provide needed insight into the epigenetic reprogramming and transcriptional regulators involved in normal mammary gland development. Here, we provide a single-cell resource of chromatin accessibility for murine mammary development from the peak of fetal mammary stem cell (fMaSC) functional activity in late embryogenesis to the differentiation of adult basal and luminal cells. We find that the chromatin landscape within individual cells predicts both gene accessibility and transcription factor activity. The ability of single-cell chromatin profiling to separate E18 fetal mammary cells into clusters exhibiting basal-like and luminal-like chromatin features is noteworthy. Such distinctions were not evident in analyses of droplet-based single-cell transcriptomic data. We present a web application as a scientific resource for facilitating future analyses of the gene regulatory networks involved in mammary development.

Abstract: Summary
Protein silencing represents an essential tool in biomedical research. Targeted protein degradation (TPD) strategies exemplified by PROTACs are rapidly emerging as modalities in drug discovery. However, the scope of current TPD techniques is limited because many intracellular materials are not substrates of proteasomal clearance. Here, we described a novel targeted-clearance strategy (autophagy-targeting chimera [AUTAC]) that contains a degradation tag (guanine derivatives) and a warhead to provide target specificity. As expected from the substrate scope of autophagy, AUTAC degraded fragmented mitochondria as well as proteins. Mitochondria-targeted AUTAC accelerated both the removal of dysfunctional fragmented mitochondria and the biogenesis of functionally normal mitochondria in patient-derived fibroblast cells. Cytoprotective effects against acute mitochondrial injuries were also seen. Canonical autophagy is viewed as a nonselective bulk decomposition system, and none of the available autophagy-inducing agents exhibit useful cargo selectivity. With its target specificity, AUTAC provides a new modality for research on autophagy-based drugs.

Abstract: Summary
PINK1 and Parkin are established mediators of mitophagy, the selective removal of damaged mitochondria by autophagy. PINK1 and Parkin have been proposed to act as tumor suppressors, as loss-of-function mutations are correlated with enhanced tumorigenesis. However, it is unclear how PINK1 and Parkin act in coordination during mitophagy to influence the cell cycle. Here we show that PINK1 and Parkin genetically interact with proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, and loss of PINK1 and Parkin accelerates cell growth. PINK1- and Parkin-mediated activation of TBK1 at the mitochondria during mitophagy leads to a block in mitosis due to the sequestration of TBK1 from its physiological role at centrosomes during mitosis. Our study supports a diverse role for the far-reaching, regulatory effects of mitochondrial quality control in cellular homeostasis and demonstrates that the PINK1/Parkin pathway genetically interacts with the cell cycle, providing a framework for understanding the molecular basis linking PINK1 and Parkin to mitosis.

Abstract: Summary
A reliable set of functional brain networks is found in healthy people and thought to underlie our cognition, emotion, and behavior. Here, we investigated these networks by quantifying intrinsic functional connectivity in six individuals who had undergone surgical removal of one hemisphere. Hemispherectomy subjects and healthy controls were scanned with identical parameters on the same scanner and compared to a large normative sample (n = 1,482). Surprisingly, hemispherectomy subjects and controls all showed strong and equivalent intrahemispheric connectivity between brain regions typically assigned to the same functional network. Connectivity between parts of different networks, however, was markedly increased for almost all hemispherectomy participants and across all networks. These results support the hypothesis of a shared set of functional networks that underlie cognition and suggest that between-network interactions may characterize functional reorganization in hemispherectomy.

Abstract: Progressive photoreceptor death is the main cause of retinal degeneration diseases. Determining the underlying mechanism of this process is essential for therapy improvement. Autophagy has long been considered to be involved in neuronal degeneration diseases, and the regulation of autophagy is thought to have potential implications for neurodegenerative disease therapies. However, whether autophagy is protective or destructive varies among diseases and is controversial. In the present study, we established an N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU)-induced photoreceptor cell damage model in vitro that faithfully replicated photoreceptor cell death in retinal degeneration diseases. Cell viability was tested by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxy-methoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assays. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were assessed through 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) fluorescence. Autophagy was confirmed by observing autophagosomes using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). A lysosome tracker was used to identify acidic lysosomes in cells. We also measured the expression of some proteins related to autophagy, apoptosis and lysosomal degradation by western blot and immunofluorescence assays. We found that MNU could decrease photoreceptor cell viability in a time- and dose-dependent manner, and this change was accompanied by concomitant increases in ROS and the expression of the apoptosis-inducing protein cleaved caspase-3. Moreover, autophagy was activated by MNU treatment during this process. Inhibition of autophagy with 3-methyladenine accelerated cell damage. Lysosome dysfunction was confirmed by autophagosome enlargement and increased cathepsin expression, which was accompanied by mTOR dephosphorylation. In conclusion, autophagy was activated through inhibition of the PI3K/mTOR pathway in the context of MNU-induced photoreceptor cell death. Prolonged mTOR dephosphorylation and autophagy activation resulted in autophagic vacuole accumulation, as indicated by inefficient degradation in lysosomes, and further led to apoptosis.

Abstract: Summary
The guts of neonatal mammals and stomachless fish have a limited capacity for luminal protein digestion, which allows oral acquisition of antibodies and antigens. However, how dietary protein is absorbed during critical developmental stages when the gut is still immature is unknown. Here, we show that specialized intestinal cells, which we call lysosome-rich enterocytes (LREs), internalize dietary protein via receptor-mediated and fluid-phase endocytosis for intracellular digestion and trans-cellular transport. In LREs, we identify a conserved endocytic machinery, composed of the scavenger receptor complex Cubilin/Amnionless and Dab2, that is required for protein uptake by LREs and for growth and survival of larval zebrafish. Moreover, impairing LRE function in suckling mice, via conditional deletion of Dab2, leads to stunted growth and severe protein malnutrition reminiscent of kwashiorkor, a devastating human malnutrition syndrome. These findings identify digestive functions and conserved molecular mechanisms in LREs that are crucial for vertebrate growth and survival.

Abstract: Summary
Physical contact between organelles is vital to the function of eukaryotic cells. Lipid droplets (LDs) are dynamic organelles specialized in lipid storage that interact physically with mitochondria in several cell types. The mechanisms coupling these organelles are, however, poorly understood, and the cell-biological function of their interaction remains largely unknown. Here, we discover in adipocytes that the outer mitochondrial membrane protein MIGA2 links mitochondria to LDs. We identify an amphipathic LD-targeting motif and reveal that MIGA2 binds to the membrane proteins VAP-A or VAP-B in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We find that in adipocytes MIGA2 is involved in promoting triglyceride (TAG) synthesis from non-lipid precursors. Our data indicate that MIGA2 links reactions of de novo lipogenesis in mitochondria to TAG production in the ER, thereby facilitating efficient lipid storage in LDs. Based on its presence in many tissues, MIGA2 is likely critical for lipid and energy homeostasis in a wide spectrum of cell types.

Abstract: Summary
Cysteine acts both as a building unit for protein translation and as the limiting substrate for glutathione synthesis to support the cellular antioxidant system. In addition to transporter-mediated uptake, cellular cysteine can also be synthesized from methionine through the transsulfuration pathway. Here, we investigate the regulation of transsulfuration and its role in sustaining cell proliferation upon extracellular cysteine limitation, a condition reported to occur in human tumors as they grow in size. We observed constitutive expression of transsulfuration enzymes in a subset of cancer cell lines, while in other cells, these enzymes are induced following cysteine deprivation. We show that both constitutive and inducible transsulfuration activities contribute to the cellular cysteine pool and redox homeostasis. The rate of transsulfuration is determined by the cellular capacity to conduct methylation reactions that convert S-adenosylmethionine to S-adenosylhomocysteine. Finally, our results demonstrate that transsulfuration-mediated cysteine synthesis is critical in promoting tumor growth in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Myxovirus resistance 2 (MX2/MXB) is an interferon (IFN)-induced HIV-1 restriction factor that inhibits viral nuclear DNA accumulation. The amino-terminal domain of MX2 binds the viral capsid and is essential for inhibition. Using in vitro assembled Capsid-Nucleocapsid (CANC) complexes as a surrogate for the HIV-1 capsid lattice, we reveal that the GTPase (G) domain of MX2 contains a second, independent capsid-binding site. The importance of this interaction was addressed in competition assays using the naturally occurring non-antiviral short isoform of MX2 that lacks the amino-terminal 25 amino acids. Specifically, these experiments show that the G domain enhances MX2 function, and the foreshortened isoform acts as a functional suppressor of the full-length protein in a G-domain-dependent manner. The interaction of MX2 with its HIV-1 capsid substrate is therefore multi-faceted: there are dual points of contact that, together with protein oligomerization, contribute to the complexity of MX2 regulation.

Splice-variant-specific effects of primary aldosteronism point mutations on human CaV3.2 calcium channels,

Abstract: CaV3.2 calcium channels play important roles in both neural excitability and aldosterone secretion. Recent clinical studies found four germline mutations (S196 L, M1549I, V1951E and P2083 L) in CaV3.2 channels. All four mutations caused primary aldosteronism (PA), while only the M1549I mutation resulted in obvious neural malfunctions besides PA. In human, there are two major CaV3.2 channel gene (CACNA1H) splice variants, either with or without exon 26. In this study, we tested the expression of the two CACNA1H splice variants in zona glomerulosa (ZG) cells of human adrenal cortex and the possibility that CaV3.2 (-26) and CaV3.2 (+26) channels have different functional responses to the four PA mutations. We found that human ZG cells only express long form CaV3.2(+26) channels. The M1549I mutation slowed the inactivation of CaV3.2(+26) more than 5 fold, and CaV3.2(-26) more than 2 fold. The S196 L, V1951E and P2083 L mutations accelerated channel recovery from inactivation for CaV3.2(+26), but not CaV3.2(-26) channels. All four mutations resulted in gain of function of CaV3.2(+26) channels, leading to overproduction of aldosterone. In conclusion, the four PA mutations caused more profound changes on CaV3.2 (+26) currents than on CaV3.2 (-26) currents, and except the M1549I mutation, the S196 L, V1951E and P2083 L have little effect on the electrophysiological properties of CaV3.2(-26) currents, which may partially explain the limitation of the phenotype associated with the V1951E, S196 L and P2083 L germline mutations to PA.

Abstract: Summary
Cerebellar dysfunction relates to various psychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum and depressive disorders. However, the physiological aspect is less advanced. Here, we investigate the immune-triggered hyperexcitability in the cerebellum on a wider scope. Activated microglia via exposure to bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide or heat-killed Gram-negative bacteria induce a potentiation of the intrinsic excitability in Purkinje neurons, which is suppressed by microglia-activity inhibitor and microglia depletion. An inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), released from microglia via toll-like receptor 4, triggers this plasticity. Our two-photon FRET ATP imaging shows an increase in ATP concentration following endotoxin exposure. Both TNF-α and ATP secretion facilitate synaptic transmission. Region-specific inflammation in the cerebellum in vivo shows depression- and autistic-like behaviors. Furthermore, both TNF-α inhibition and microglia depletion revert such behavioral abnormality. Resting-state functional MRI reveals overconnectivity between the inflamed cerebellum and the prefrontal neocortical regions. Thus, immune activity in the cerebellum induces neuronal hyperexcitability and disruption of psychomotor behaviors in animals.

Abstract: Summary
The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) acts as a ubiquitous cortisol-dependent transcription factor (TF). To identify co-factors, we used protein-fragment complementation assays and found that GR recognizes FLI1 and additional ETS family proteins, TFs relaying proliferation and/or migration signals. Following steroid-dependent translocation of FLI1 and GR to the nucleus, the FLI1-specific domain (FLS) binds with GR and strongly enhances GR’s transcriptional activity. This interaction has functional consequences in Ewing sarcoma (ES), childhood and adolescence bone malignancies driven by fusions between EWSR1 and FLI1. In vitro, GR knockdown inhibited the migration and proliferation of ES cells, and in animal models, antagonizing GR (or lowering cortisol) retarded both tumor growth and metastasis from bone to lung. Taken together, our findings offer mechanistic rationale for repurposing GR-targeting drugs for the treatment of patients with ES.

Abstract: Summary
Epigenomic mechanisms regulate distinct aspects of the inflammatory response in immune cells. Despite the central role for microglia in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, little is known about their epigenomic regulation of the inflammatory response. Here, we show that Ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2) methylcytosine dioxygenase expression is increased in microglia upon stimulation with various inflammogens through a NF-κB-dependent pathway. We found that TET2 regulates early gene transcriptional changes, leading to early metabolic alterations, as well as a later inflammatory response independently of its enzymatic activity. We further show that TET2 regulates the proinflammatory response in microglia of mice intraperitoneally injected with LPS. We observed that microglia associated with amyloid β plaques expressed TET2 in brain tissue from individuals with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and in 5xFAD mice. Collectively, our findings show that TET2 plays an important role in the microglial inflammatory response and suggest TET2 as a potential target to combat neurodegenerative brain disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Over 80% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) patients are diagnosed with non-resectable late-stage disease that lacks effective neoadjuvant therapies. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has shown promise as an emerging neoadjuvant approach for treating PDA, and here, we report that its combination with local interleukin-12 (IL-12) microsphere (MS) immunotherapy results in marked tumor reduction and cures in multiple preclinical mouse models of PDA. Our findings demonstrate an increase of intratumoral interferon gamma (IFNγ) production following SBRT/IL-12 MS administration that initiates suppressor cell reprogramming and a subsequent increase in CD8 T cell activation. Furthermore, SBRT/IL-12 MS therapy results in the generation of systemic tumor immunity that is capable of eliminating established liver metastases, providing a rationale for follow-up studies in advanced metastatic disease.

Abstract: Summary
Hypoxia plays a major role in the physiology of hematopoietic and immune niches. Important clues from works in mouse have paved the way to investigate the role of low O2 levels in hematopoiesis. However, whether hypoxia impacts the initial steps of human lymphopoiesis remains unexplored. Here, we show that hypoxia regulates cellular and metabolic profiles of umbilical cord blood (UCB)-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells. Hypoxia more specifically enhances in vitro lymphoid differentiation potentials of lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitors (LMPPs) and pro-T/natural killer (NK) cells and in vivo B cell potential of LMPPs. In accordance, hypoxia exacerbates the lymphoid gene expression profile through hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α (for LMPPs) and HIF-2α (for pro-T/NK). Moreover, loss of HIF-1/2α expression seriously impedes NK and B cell production from LMPPs and pro-T/NK. Our study describes how hypoxia contributes to the lymphoid development of human progenitors and reveals the implication of the HIF pathway in LMPPs and pro-T/NK-cell lymphoid identities.

Abstract: Summary
The regulation of hepatic gene expression has been extensively studied at the transcriptional level; however, the control of metabolism through posttranscriptional gene regulation by RNA-binding proteins in physiological and disease states is less understood. Here, we report a major role for the hormone-sensitive RNA-binding protein (RBP) APOBEC1 complementation factor (A1CF) in the generation of hepatocyte-specific and alternatively spliced transcripts. Among these transcripts are isoforms for the dominant and high-affinity fructose-metabolizing ketohexokinase C and glycerol kinase, two key metabolic enzymes that are linked to hepatic gluconeogenesis and found to be markedly reduced upon hepatic ablation of A1cf. Consequently, mice lacking A1CF exhibit improved glucose tolerance and are protected from fructose-induced hyperglycemia, hepatic steatosis, and development of obesity. Our results identify a previously unreported function of A1CF as a regulator of alternative splicing of a subset of genes influencing hepatic glucose production through fructose and glycerol metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Optimizing direct electrical stimulation for the treatment of neurological disease remains difficult due to an incomplete understanding of its physical propagation through brain tissue. Here, we use network control theory to predict how stimulation spreads through white matter to influence spatially distributed dynamics. We test the theory’s predictions using a unique dataset comprising diffusion weighted imaging and electrocorticography in epilepsy patients undergoing grid stimulation. We find statistically significant shared variance between the predicted activity state transitions and the observed activity state transitions. We then use an optimal control framework to posit testable hypotheses regarding which brain states and structural properties will efficiently improve memory encoding when stimulated. Our work quantifies the role that white matter architecture plays in guiding the dynamics of direct electrical stimulation and offers empirical support for the utility of network control theory in explaining the brain’s response to stimulation.

Abstract: Summary
Actin-binding proteins are essential for linear and branched actin filament dynamics that control shape change, cell migration, and cell junction remodeling in vascular endothelium (endothelial cells [ECs]). The epithelial protein lost in neoplasm (EPLIN) is an actin-binding protein, expressed as EPLIN-α and EPLIN-β by alternative promoters; however, the isoform-specific functions are not yet understood. Aortic compared to cava vein ECs and shear stress-exposed cultured ECs express increased EPLIN-β levels that stabilize stress fibers. In contrast, EPLIN-α expression is increased in growing and migrating ECs, is targeted to membrane protrusions, and terminates their growth via interaction with the Arp2/3 complex. The data indicate that EPLIN-α controls protrusion dynamics while EPLIN-β has an actin filament stabilizing role, which is consistent with FRAP analyses demonstrating a lower EPLIN-β turnover rate compared to EPLIN-α. Together, EPLIN isoforms differentially control actin dynamics in ECs, essential in shear stress responses, cell migration, and barrier function.

Abstract: Summary
BRAF fusions are detected in numerous neoplasms, but their clinical management remains unresolved. We identified six melanoma lines harboring BRAF fusions representative of the clinical cases reported in the literature. Their unexpected heterogeneous responses to RAF and MEK inhibitors could be categorized upon specific features of the fusion kinases. Higher expression level correlated with resistance, and fusion partners containing a dimerization domain promoted paradoxical activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and hyperproliferation in response to first- and second-generation RAF inhibitors. By contrast, next-generation αC-IN/DFG-OUT RAF inhibitors blunted paradoxical activation across all lines and had their therapeutic efficacy further increased in vitro and in vivo by combination with MEK inhibitors, opening perspectives in the clinical management of tumors harboring BRAF fusions.

Abstract: Summary
In the arms race against bacteria, bacteriophages have evolved diverse anti-CRISPR proteins (Acrs) that block CRISPR-Cas immunity. Acrs play key roles in the molecular coevolution of bacteria with their predators, use a variety of mechanisms of action, and provide tools to regulate Cas-based genome manipulation. Here, we present structural and functional analyses of AcrIIA6, an Acr from virulent phages, exploring its unique anti-CRISPR action. Our cryo-EM structures and functional data of AcrIIA6 binding to Streptococcus thermophilus Cas9 (St1Cas9) show that AcrIIA6 acts as an allosteric inhibitor and induces St1Cas9 dimerization. AcrIIA6 reduces St1Cas9 binding affinity for DNA and prevents DNA binding within cells. The PAM and AcrIIA6 recognition sites are structurally close and allosterically linked. Mechanistically, AcrIIA6 affects the St1Cas9 conformational dynamics associated with PAM binding. Finally, we identify a natural St1Cas9 variant resistant to AcrIIA6 illustrating Acr-driven mutational escape and molecular diversification of Cas9 proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Although correlations between RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription stress, R-loops, and genome instability have been established, the mechanisms underlying these connections remain poorly understood. Here, we used a mutant version of the transcription elongation factor TFIIS (TFIISmut), aiming to specifically induce increased levels of RNAPII pausing, arrest, and/or backtracking in human cells. Indeed, TFIISmut expression results in slower elongation rates, relative depletion of polymerases from the end of genes, and increased levels of stopped RNAPII; it affects mRNA splicing and termination as well. Remarkably, TFIISmut expression also dramatically increases R-loops, which may form at the anterior end of backtracked RNAPII and trigger genome instability, including DNA strand breaks. These results shed light on the relationship between transcription stress and R-loops and suggest that different classes of R-loops may exist, potentially with distinct consequences for genome stability.

Abstract: Summary
The CARMA1/CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex bridges T and B cell antigen receptor (TCR/BCR) ligation to MALT1 protease activation and canonical nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling. Using unbiased mass spectrometry, we discover multiple serine phosphorylation sites in the MALT1 C terminus after T cell activation. Phospho-specific antibodies reveal that CBM-associated MALT1 is transiently hyper-phosphorylated upon TCR/CD28 co-stimulation. We identify a dual role for CK1α as a kinase that is essential for CBM signalosome assembly as well as MALT1 phosphorylation. Although MALT1 phosphorylation is largely dispensable for protease activity, it fosters canonical NF-κB signaling in Jurkat and murine CD4 T cells. Moreover, constitutive MALT1 phosphorylation promotes survival of activated B cell-type diffuse large B cell lymphoma (ABC-DLBCL) cells addicted to chronic BCR signaling. Thus, MALT1 phosphorylation triggers optimal NF-κB activation in lymphocytes and survival of lymphoma cells.

Abstract: Summary
Among mammary tumor-infiltrating immune cells, the highest expression of podoplanin (PDPN) is found in a subset of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). We hereby demonstrate that PDPN is involved in the attachment of this TAM subset to lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). Mechanistically, the binding of PDPN to LEC-derived galectin 8 (GAL8) in a glycosylation-dependent manner promotes the activation of pro-migratory integrin β1. When proximal to lymphatics, PDPN-expressing macrophages (PoEMs) stimulate local matrix remodeling and promote vessel growth and lymphoinvasion. Anti-integrin β1 blockade, macrophage-specific Pdpn knockout, or GAL8 inhibition impairs TAM adhesion to LECs, restraining lymphangiogenesis and reducing lymphatic cancer spread. In breast cancer patients, association of PoEMs with tumor lymphatic vessels correlates with incidences of lymph node and distant organ metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Hair cell stereocilia tip-links function to sense mechanical forces generated by sound waves and maintain the structure of stereocilia by rooting the tail of cadherins to highly dense structures known as tip-link densities. Although the molecular components are largely known, the mechanisms underlying the tip-link density formation are unknown. Here, we show that Myosin VIIB (MYO7B), USH1C, and ANKS4B, which form a specific complex stabilizing tip-links in intestine microvilli, could form dense condensates via liquid-liquid phase separation in vitro and in cells. The MYO7A, USH1C, and USH1G complex also undergoes phase separation in cells. Formation of the MYO7A/USH1C/USH1G and MYO7B/USH1C/ANKS4B condensates requires strong and multivalent interactions between proteins in both tripartite complexes. Point mutations of MYO7A found in Usher syndrome patients weaken or even disrupt the multivalent interactions of the MYO7A/USH1C/USH1G complex and impair its phase separation. Thus, the stereocilia tip-link densities may form via phase separation of the MYO7A/USH1C/USH1G complex.

Abstract: Summary
The mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes are organized into supercomplexes (SCs) of defined stoichiometry, which have been proposed to regulate electron flux via substrate channeling. We demonstrate that CoQ trapping in the isolated SC I+III2 limits complex (C)I turnover, arguing against channeling. The SC structure, resolved at up to 3.8 Å in four distinct states, suggests that CoQ oxidation may be rate limiting because of unequal access of CoQ to the active sites of CIII2. CI shows a transition between “closed” and “open” conformations, accompanied by the striking rotation of a key transmembrane helix. Furthermore, the state of CI affects the conformational flexibility within CIII2, demonstrating crosstalk between the enzymes. CoQ was identified at only three of the four binding sites in CIII2, suggesting that interaction with CI disrupts CIII2 symmetry in a functionally relevant manner. Together, these observations indicate a more nuanced functional role for the SCs.

Abstract: Summary
The apical Par complex, which contains atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), Bazooka (Par-3), and Par-6, is required for establishing polarity during asymmetric division of neuroblasts in Drosophila, and its activity depends on L(2)gl. We show that loss of Ankle2, a protein associated with microcephaly in humans and known to interact with Zika protein NS4A, reduces brain volume in flies and impacts the function of the Par complex. Reducing Ankle2 levels disrupts endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nuclear envelope morphology, releasing the kinase Ballchen-VRK1 into the cytosol. These defects are associated with reduced phosphorylation of aPKC, disruption of Par-complex localization, and spindle alignment defects. Importantly, removal of one copy of ballchen or l(2)gl suppresses Ankle2 mutant phenotypes and restores viability and brain size. Human mutational studies implicate the above-mentioned genes in microcephaly and motor neuron disease. We suggest that NS4A, ANKLE2, VRK1, and LLGL1 define a pathway impinging on asymmetric determinants of neural stem cell division.

Abstract: Summary
The somatotopic motor-neuron projections onto their cognate target muscles are essential for coordinated movement, but how that occurs for facial motor circuits, which have critical roles in respiratory and interactive behaviors, is poorly understood. We report extensive molecular heterogeneity in developing facial motor neurons in the mouse and identify markers of subnuclei and the motor pools innervating specific facial muscles. Facial subnuclei differentiate during migration to the ventral hindbrain, where neurons with progressively later birth dates—and evolutionarily more recent functions—settle in more-lateral positions. One subpopulation marker, ETV1, determines both positional and target muscle identity for neurons of the dorsolateral (DL) subnucleus. In Etv1 mutants, many markers of DL differentiation are lost, and individual motor pools project indifferently to their own and neighboring muscle targets. The resulting aberrant activation patterns are reminiscent of the facial synkinesis observed in humans after facial nerve injury.

Abstract: Summary
The function of the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) in the organization of the genome has become an important area of investigation, but the mechanisms by which CTCF dynamically contributes to genome organization are not clear. We previously discovered that CTCF binds to large numbers of endogenous RNAs, promoting its self-association. In this regard, we now report two independent features that disrupt CTCF association with chromatin: inhibition of transcription and disruption of CTCF-RNA interactions through mutations of 2 of its 11 zinc fingers that are not required for CTCF binding to its cognate DNA site: zinc finger 1 (ZF1) or zinc finger 10 (ZF10). These mutations alter gene expression profiles as CTCF mutants lose their ability to form chromatin loops and thus the ability to insulate chromatin domains and to mediate CTCF long-range genomic interactions. Our results point to the importance of CTCF-mediated RNA interactions as a structural component of genome organization.

Abstract: Summary
Long-term sensitization of the gill withdrawal reflex in Aplysia requires heterosynaptic, modulatory input that is mediated in part by the growth of new synaptic connections between sensory neurons and their follower cells (intrinsic mediating circuit). Whether modulatory interneurons (the extrinsic modulatory circuit) also display learning-related structural synaptic plasticity remains unknown. To test this idea, we added a bona fide serotonergic modulatory neuron, the metacerebral cell (MCC), to sensory-motor neuron co-cultures and examined the modulating presynaptic varicosities of MCCs before and after repeated pulses of serotonin (5-HT) that induced long-term facilitation (LTF). We observed robust growth of new serotonergic varicosities that were positive for serotonin and capable of synaptic recycling. Our findings demonstrate that, in addition to structural changes in the intrinsic mediating circuit, there are also significant learning-related structural changes in the extrinsic modulating circuit, and these changes might provide a cellular mechanism for savings and for spread of memory.

Abstract: Summary
Progenitor heterogeneity and identities underlying tumor initiation and relapse in medulloblastomas remain elusive. Utilizing single-cell transcriptomic analysis, we demonstrated a developmental hierarchy of progenitor pools in Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) medulloblastomas, and identified OLIG2-expressing glial progenitors as transit-amplifying cells at the tumorigenic onset. Although OLIG2+ progenitors become quiescent stem-like cells in full-blown tumors, they are highly enriched in therapy-resistant and recurrent medulloblastomas. Depletion of mitotic Olig2+ progenitors or Olig2 ablation impeded tumor initiation. Genomic profiling revealed that OLIG2 modulates chromatin landscapes and activates oncogenic networks including HIPPO-YAP/TAZ and AURORA-A/MYCN pathways. Co-targeting these oncogenic pathways induced tumor growth arrest. Together, our results indicate that glial lineage-associated OLIG2+ progenitors are tumor-initiating cells during medulloblastoma tumorigenesis and relapse, suggesting OLIG2-driven oncogenic networks as potential therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Summary
Hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) and subsequent generations of matrix progeny make lineage choices by responding to spatiotemporal signals; however, the cues driving that specification are not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that the dynamics of microRNA (miR)-29 expression are inversely proportional to HFSC lineage progression. Furthermore, we show that sustained miR-29a/b1 overexpression in anagen or telogen in mice causes a short-hair phenotype and eventual hair loss by inhibiting the proliferation of HFSCs and matrix cells and likely preventing their differentiation. Conversely, in a loss-of-function in vivo model, miR-29a/b1 deficiency accelerates HFSC lineage progression in telogen. Mechanistically, miR-29a/b1 blocks HFSC lineage specification by spatiotemporally targeting Ctnnb1, Lrp6, Bmpr1a, and Ccna2. We further show that skin-specific Lrp6 or Bmpr1a ablation partially accounts for the short-hair phenotype. Overall, these synergistic targets reveal miR-29a/b1 as a high-fidelity antagonist of HFSC lineage progression and a potential therapeutic target for hair loss.

Abstract: Summary
Although global H3K27me3 reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer, no effective therapeutic strategy for H3K27me3-high malignancies harboring EZH2WT/WT has yet been established. We explore epigenome and transcriptome in EZH2WT/WT and EZH2WT/Mu aggressive lymphomas and show that mutual interference and compensatory function of co-expressed EZH1 and EZH2 rearrange their own genome-wide distribution, thereby establishing restricted chromatin and gene expression signatures. Direct comparison of leading compounds introduces potency and a mechanism of action of the EZH1/2 dual inhibitor (valemetostat). The synthetic lethality is observed in all lymphoma models and primary adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) cells. Opposing actions of EZH1/2-polycomb and SWI/SNF complexes are required for facultative heterochromatin formation. Inactivation of chromatin-associated genes (ARID1A, SMARCA4/BRG1, SMARCB1/SNF5, KDM6A/UTX, BAP1, KMT2D/MLL2) and oncovirus infection (HTLV-1, EBV) trigger EZH1/2 perturbation and H3K27me3 deposition. Our study provides the mechanism-based rationale for chemical dual targeting of EZH1/2 in cancer epigenome.

Abstract: Summary
IFITs are interferon-induced proteins that can bind 5′-triphosphate or ribose-unmethylated capped ends of mRNA to inhibit translation. Although some viruses avoid IFITs by synthesizing RNAs with eukaryotic-like caps, no viral proteins were known to antagonize IFITs. We show that the N- and C-terminal portions of C9, a protein required for vaccinia virus to resist the human type I interferon-induced state, bind IFITs and ubiquitin regulatory complexes, respectively. Together, the two C9 domains target IFITs for proteasomal degradation, thereby providing interferon resistance similar to that also achieved by knockout of IFITs. Furthermore, ectopic expression of C9 rescues the interferon sensitivity of a vaccinia virus mutant with an inactivated cap 1-specific ribose-methyltransferase that is otherwise unable to express early proteins. In contrast, the C9-deletion mutant expresses early proteins but is blocked by IFITs at the subsequent genome uncoating/replication step. Thus, poxviruses use mRNA cap methylation and proteosomal degradation to defeat multiple antiviral activities of IFITs.

Abstract: Summary
An efficient, generalizable method for genome-wide mapping of single-cell histone modifications or chromatin-binding proteins is lacking. Here, we develop CoBATCH, combinatorial barcoding and targeted chromatin release, for single-cell profiling of genomic distribution of chromatin-binding proteins in cell culture and tissue. Protein A in fusion to Tn5 transposase is enriched through specific antibodies to genomic regions, and Tn5 generates indexed chromatin fragments ready for library preparation and sequencing. Importantly, this strategy enables not only low-input epigenomic profiling in intact tissues but also measures scalable up to tens of thousands of single cells per experiment under both native and cross-linked conditions. CoBATCH produces ∼12,000 reads/cell with extremely low background. Mapping of endothelial cell lineages from ten embryonic mouse organs through CoBATCH allows for efficient deciphering of epigenetic heterogeneity of cell populations and cis-regulatory mechanisms. Thus, obviating specialized devices, CoBATCH is broadly applicable and easily deployable for single-cell profiling of protein-DNA interactions.

Abstract: Summary
Nucleus position in cells can act as a developmental cue. Mammalian oocytes position their nucleus centrally using an F-actin-mediated pressure gradient. The biological significance of nucleus centering in mammalian oocytes being unknown, we sought to assess the F-actin pressure gradient effect on the nucleus. We addressed this using a dedicated computational 3D imaging approach, biophysical analyses, and a nucleus repositioning assay in mouse oocytes mutant for cytoplasmic F-actin. We found that the cytoplasmic activity, in charge of nucleus centering, shaped the nucleus while promoting nuclear envelope fluctuations and chromatin motion. Off-centered nuclei in F-actin mutant oocytes were misshaped with immobile chromatin and modulated gene expression. Restoration of F-actin in mutant oocytes rescued nucleus architecture fully and gene expression partially. Thus, the F-actin-mediated pressure gradient also modulates nucleus dynamics in oocytes. Moreover, this study supports a mechano-transduction model whereby cytoplasmic microfilaments could modulate oocyte transcriptome, essential for subsequent embryo development.

Abstract: Summary
Gene transcription in eukaryotes is regulated through dynamic interactions of a variety of different proteins with DNA in the context of chromatin. Here, we used mass spectrometry for absolute quantification of the nuclear proteome and methyl marks on selected lysine residues in histone H3 during two stages of Drosophila embryogenesis. These analyses provide comprehensive information about the absolute copy number of several thousand proteins and reveal unexpected relationships between the abundance of histone-modifying and -binding proteins and the chromatin landscape that they generate and interact with. For some histone modifications, the levels in Drosophila embryos are substantially different from those previously reported in tissue culture cells. Genome-wide profiling of H3K27 methylation during developmental progression and in animals with reduced PRC2 levels illustrates how mass spectrometry can be used for quantitatively describing and comparing chromatin states. Together, these data provide a foundation toward a quantitative understanding of gene regulation in Drosophila.

Abstract: Summary
Size trade-offs of visual versus olfactory organs is a pervasive feature of animal evolution. This could result from genetic or functional constraints. We demonstrate that head sensory organ size trade-offs in Drosophila are genetically encoded and arise through differential subdivision of the head primordium into visual versus non-visual fields. We discover that changes in the temporal regulation of the highly conserved eyeless/Pax6 gene expression during development is a conserved mechanism for sensory trade-offs within and between Drosophila species. We identify a natural single nucleotide polymorphism in the cis-regulatory region of eyeless in a binding site of its repressor Cut that is sufficient to alter its temporal regulation and eye size. Because eyeless/Pax6 is a conserved regulator of head sensory placode subdivision, we propose that its temporal regulation is key to define the relative size of head sensory organs.

Abstract: Summary
Coordinated movement requires the integration of many sensory inputs including proprioception, the sense of relative body position and force associated with movement. Proprioceptive information is relayed to the cerebellum via spinocerebellar neurons, located in the spinal cord within a number of major neuronal columns or as various scattered populations. Despite the importance of proprioception to fluid movement, a molecular understanding of spinocerebellar relay interneurons is only beginning to be explored, with limited knowledge of molecular heterogeneity within and between columns. Using fluorescent reporter mice, neuronal tracing, and in situ hybridization, we identify widespread expression of Hox cluster genes within spinocerebellar neurons. We reveal a “Hox code” based on axial level and individual spinocerebellar column, which, at cervico-thoracic levels, is essential for subtype regionalization. Specifically, we show that Hoxc9 function is required in most, but not all, cells of the thoracic spinocerebellar column, Clarke’s column, revealing heterogeneity reliant on Hox signatures.

Abstract: Summary
The size of dendrite arbors shapes their function and differs vastly between neuron types. The signals that control dendritic arbor size remain obscure. Here, we find that in the retina, starburst amacrine cells (SACs) and rod bipolar cells (RBCs) express the homophilic cell-surface protein AMIGO2. In Amigo2 knockout (KO) mice, SAC and RBC dendrites expand while arbors of other retinal neurons remain stable. SAC dendrites are divided into a central input region and a peripheral output region that provides asymmetric inhibition to direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs). Input and output compartments scale precisely with increased arbor size in Amigo2 KO mice, and SAC dendrites maintain asymmetric connectivity with DSGCs. Increased coverage of SAC dendrites is accompanied by increased direction selectivity of DSGCs without changes to other ganglion cells. Our results identify AMIGO2 as a cell-type-specific dendritic scaling factor and link dendrite size and coverage to visual feature detection.

Abstract: Summary
The physiological role of leptin is thought to be a driving force to reduce food intake and increase energy expenditure. However, leptin therapies in the clinic have failed to effectively treat obesity, predominantly due to a phenomenon referred to as leptin resistance. The mechanisms linking obesity and the associated leptin resistance remain largely unclear. With various mouse models and a leptin neutralizing antibody, we demonstrated that hyperleptinemia is a driving force for metabolic disorders. A partial reduction of plasma leptin levels in the context of obesity restores hypothalamic leptin sensitivity and effectively reduces weight gain and enhances insulin sensitivity. These results highlight that a partial reduction in plasma leptin levels leads to improved leptin sensitivity, while pointing to a new avenue for therapeutic interventions in the treatment of obesity and its associated comorbidities.

Abstract: Summary
Munc13 proteins play several roles in regulating short-term synaptic plasticity. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unclear. Here we report that C. elegans UNC-13L, a Munc13-1 ortholog, has three domains that inhibit synaptic vesicle (SV) exocytosis. These include the X (sequence between C2A and C1), C1, and C2B domains. Deleting all three inhibitory domains produces a hyperactive UNC-13 (sUNC-13) that exhibits dramatically increased neurotransmitter release, Ca2+ sensitivity of release, and release probability. The vesicular pool in unc-13 mutants rescued by sUNC-13 exhibits a faster synaptic recovery and replenishment rate, demonstrating an important role of sUNC-13 in regulating synaptic plasticity. Analysis of double mutants suggests that sUNC-13 enhances tonic release by increasing the open probability of UNC-64/syntaxin-1A, whereas its effects on evoked release appear to be mediated by additional functions, presumably by further regulating the activity of the assembled soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor activating protein receptor (SNARE) complex.

Abstract: Summary
Oligoribonucleases are conserved enzymes that degrade short RNA molecules of up to 5 nt in length and are assumed to constitute the final stage of RNA turnover. Here we demonstrate that REXO2 is a specialized dinucleotide-degrading enzyme that shows no preference between RNA and DNA dinucleotide substrates. A heart- and skeletal-muscle-specific knockout mouse displays elevated dinucleotide levels and alterations in gene expression patterns indicative of aberrant dinucleotide-primed transcription initiation. We find that dinucleotides act as potent stimulators of mitochondrial transcription initiation in vitro. Our data demonstrate that increased levels of dinucleotides can be used to initiate transcription, leading to an increase in transcription levels from both mitochondrial promoters and other, nonspecific sequence elements in mitochondrial DNA. Efficient RNA turnover by REXO2 is thus required to maintain promoter specificity and proper regulation of transcription in mammalian mitochondria.

Abstract: Autophagy is an important process for protein recycling. Oligomerization of p62/SQSTM1 is an essential step in this process and is achieved in two steps. Phox and Bem1p (PB1) domains can oligomerize through both basic and acidic surfaces in each molecule. The ZZ-type zinc finger (ZZ) domain binds to target proteins and promotes higher-oligomerization of p62. This mechanism is an important step in routing target proteins to the autophagosome. Here, we determined the crystal structure of the PB1 homo-dimer and modeled the p62 PB1 oligomers. These oligomer models were represented by a cylindrical helix and were compared with the previously determined electron microscopic map of a PB1 oligomer. To accurately compare, we mathematically calculated the lead length and radius of the helical oligomers. Our PB1 oligomer model fits the electron microscopy map and is both bendable and stretchable as a flexible helical filament.

Abstract: Summary
Human neutrophilic granulocytes form the largest pool of innate immune cells for host defense against bacterial and fungal pathogens. The dynamic changes that accompany the metamorphosis from a proliferating myeloid progenitor cell in the bone marrow into a mature non-dividing polymorphonuclear blood cell have remained poorly defined. Using mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics combined with transcriptomic data, we report on the dynamic changes of five developmental stages in the bone marrow and blood. Integration of transcriptomes and proteome unveils highly dynamic and differential interactions between RNA and protein kinetics during human neutrophil development, which can be linked to functional maturation of typical end-stage blood neutrophil killing activities.

Abstract: Summary
DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are deleterious and tumorigenic but could also be essential for DNA-based processes. Yet the landscape of physiological DSBs and their role and repair are still elusive. Here, we mapped DSBs at high resolution in cancer and non-tumorigenic cells and found a transcription-coupled repair mechanism at oncogenic super-enhancers. At these super-enhancers the transcription factor TEAD4, together with various transcription factors and co-factors, co-localizes with the repair factor RAD51 of the homologous recombination pathway. Depletion of TEAD4 or RAD51 increases DSBs at RAD51/TEAD4 common binding sites within super-enhancers and decreases expression of related genes, which are mostly oncogenes. Co-localization of RAD51 with transcription factors at super-enhancers occurs in various cell types, suggesting a broad phenomenon. Together, our findings uncover a coupling between transcription and repair mechanisms at oncogenic super-enhancers, to control the hyper-transcription of multiple cancer drivers.

Abstract: Summary
Hypoxia, which occurs during tumor growth, triggers complex adaptive responses in which peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1α) plays a critical role in mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism. However, how PGC-1α is regulated in response to oxygen availability remains unclear. We demonstrated that lysine demethylase 3A (KDM3A) binds to PGC-1α and demethylates monomethylated lysine (K) 224 of PGC-1α under normoxic conditions. Hypoxic stimulation inhibits KDM3A, which has a high KM of oxygen for its activity, and enhances PGC-1α K224 monomethylation. This modification decreases PGC-1α’s activity required for NRF1- and NRF2-dependent transcriptional regulation of TFAM, TFB1M, and TFB2M, resulting in reduced mitochondrial biogenesis. Expression of PGC-1α K224R mutant significantly increases mitochondrial biogenesis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and tumor cell apoptosis under hypoxia and inhibits brain tumor growth in mice. This study revealed that PGC-1α monomethylation, which is dependent on oxygen availability-regulated KDM3A, plays a critical role in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis.
