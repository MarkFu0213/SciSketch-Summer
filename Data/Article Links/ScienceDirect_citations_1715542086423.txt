Abstract: Summary
Pharmacological screening in physiologically relevant brain cells is crucial for identifying neuroactive compounds that better translate into in vivo biology and efficacious therapeutics. Pharmacological enhancement of apolipoprotein E (apoE), a cholesterol-transporting apolipoprotein, has been proposed as a promising therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's disease. Several nuclear receptor agonists were initially shown to increase brain apoE levels together with ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1), but their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To gain an insight on brain apoE regulation, we performed an unbiased high-throughput screening of known drugs and bioactive compounds in cultured human primary astrocytes, the major apoE-producing cell type in the brain. We have identified several small molecules that increase apoE secretion via previously unknown mechanisms, including those not co-inducing ABCA1. These newly identified compounds are active preferentially in human astrocytes but not in an astrocytoma cell line, furnishing new tools for investigating biological pathways underlying brain apoE production.

Abstract: Summary
Breast cancers possess fundamentally altered metabolism that fuels their pathogenicity. While many metabolic drivers of breast cancers have been identified, the metabolic pathways that mediate breast cancer malignancy and poor prognosis are less well understood. Here, we used a reactivity-based chemoproteomic platform to profile metabolic enzymes that are enriched in breast cancer cell types linked to poor prognosis, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells and breast cancer cells that have undergone an epithelial-mesenchymal transition-like state of heightened malignancy. We identified glutathione S-transferase Pi 1 (GSTP1) as a novel TNBC target that controls cancer pathogenicity by regulating glycolytic and lipid metabolism, energetics, and oncogenic signaling pathways through a protein interaction that activates glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity. We show that genetic or pharmacological inactivation of GSTP1 impairs cell survival and tumorigenesis in TNBC cells. We put forth GSTP1 inhibitors as a novel therapeutic strategy for combatting TNBCs through impairing key cancer metabolism and signaling pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Proper functioning of organelles such as the ER or the Golgi apparatus requires luminal accumulation of Ca2+ at high concentrations. Here we describe a ratiometric low-affinity Ca2+ sensor of the GFP-aequorin protein (GAP) family optimized for measurements in high-Ca2+ concentration environments. Transgenic animals expressing the ER-targeted sensor allowed monitoring of Ca2+ signals inside the organelle. The use of the sensor was demonstrated under three experimental paradigms: (1) ER Ca2+ oscillations in cultured astrocytes, (2) ex vivo functional mapping of cholinergic receptors triggering ER Ca2+ release in acute hippocampal slices from transgenic mice, and (3) in vivo sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ dynamics in the muscle of transgenic flies. Our results provide proof of the suitability of the new biosensors to monitor Ca2+ dynamics inside intracellular organelles under physiological conditions and open an avenue to explore complex Ca2+ signaling in animal models of health and disease.

Abstract: Testis development and ultrastructural features of spermatogenesis in Acrossocheilus fasciatus (Cypriniformes, Barbinae), a commercial stream fish, were studied using light and electron microscopy. The reproduction cycle in A. fasciatus testes is classified into six successive stages from Stage I to Stage VI. Based on an analysis of previous results, May to July can be confirmed as the best breeding season for A. fasciatus males. During this time, the A. fasciatus testes are in Stage V and the sperm in males is most abundant. In the first reproductive cycle, sexually mature male testes return to Stage III in October, subsequently overwintering at this stage. In the lobular-type testes of A. fasciatus, cystic type spermatogenesis occurs with restricted spermatogonia. All spermatogenic cells at different stages are distributed along the seminiferous lobules, which contain spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids and spermatozoa. At the end of spermatogenesis, spermatogenic cysts open to release spermatozoa into the lobule lumen. Ultrastructural observation of A. fasciatus spermiogenesis reveals that electron-dense substances appear at the different stages of germ cells, from primary spermatogonia to secondary spermatocytes. We have termed these dense substances as “nuage” when free in the cytoplasm or adjacent to the nuclear envelope, while those close to the mitochondria are called inter-mitochondrial cement. The spermatozoa in A. fasciatus can be classified as type I due to the presence of nuclear rotation. Although the nuclear chromatin in the head of sperm was highly condensed, no acrosome was formed. The cytoplasmic canal, a common ultrastructural feature of Teleostei spermatozoa, was also present in the midpiece. In addition, numerous fused mitochondria were observed. The distal centriole and proximal centriole constituting the centriolar complex were oriented incompletely perpendicular to each other. The flagellum showed a typical 9+2 arrangement pattern. Conversely, our study on A. fasciatus yielded no information concerning the lateral fins although an enlarged saclike area was present at the end of some flagella.

Abstract: Arterial medial calcification (AMC) is prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and contributes to elevated risk of cardiovascular events and mortality. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) to osteogenic transdifferentiation (VOT) in a high-phosphate environment is involved in the pathogenesis of AMC in CKD. WNT/β-catenin signaling is indicated to play a crucial role in osteogenesis via promoting Runx2 expression in osteoprogenitor cells, however, its role in Runx2 regulation and VOT remains incompletely clarified. In this study, Runx2 was induced and β-catenin was activated by high-phosphate in VSMCs. Two forms of active β-catenin, dephosphorylated on Ser37/Thr41 and phosphorylated on Ser675 sites, were upregulated by high-phosphate. Activation of β-catenin, through ectopic expression of stabilized β-catenin, inhibition of GSK-3β, or WNT-3A protein, induced Runx2 expression, whereas blockade of WNT/β-catenin signaling with Porcupine (PORCN) inhibitor or Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) protein inhibited Runx2 induction by high-phosphate. WNT-3A promoted osteocalcin expression and calcium deposition in VSMCs, whereas DKK1 ameliorated calcification of VSMCs induced by high-phosphate. Two functional T cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor binding sites were identified in the promoter region of Runx2 gene in VSMCs, which interacted with TCF upon β-catenin activation. Site-directed mutation of each of them attenuated Runx2 response to β-catenin, and deletion or destruction of both of them completely abolished this responsiveness. In the aortic tunica media of rats with chronic renal failure, followed by AMC, Runx2 and β-catenin was induced, and the Runx2 mRNA level was positively associated with the abundance of phosphorylated β-catenin (Ser675). Collectively, our study suggested that high-phosphate may activate WNT/β-catenin signaling through different pathways, and the activated WNT/β-catenin signaling, through direct downstream target Runx2, could play an important role in promoting VOT and AMC.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria are critical to neurogenesis, but the mechanisms of mitochondria in neurogenesis have not been well explored. We fully characterized mitochondrial alterations and function in relation to the development of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Following directed differentiation of hiPSCs to DA neurons, mitochondria in these neurons exhibit pronounced changes during differentiation, including mature neurophysiology characterization and functional synaptic network formation. Inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chains via application of complex IV inhibitor KCN (potassium cyanide) or complex I inhibitor rotenone restricted neurogenesis of DA neurons. These results demonstrated the direct importance of mitochondrial development and bioenergetics in DA neuronal differentiation. Our study also provides a neurophysiologic model of mitochondrial involvement in neurogenesis, which will enhance our understanding of the role of mitochondrial dysfunctions in neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The molecular mechanisms regulating neural progenitor (NP) proliferation are fundamental in establishing the cytoarchitecture of the mammalian neocortex. The rate of cell-cycle progression and a fine-tuned balance between cell-cycle re-entry and exit determine the numbers of both NPs and neurons as well as postmitotic neuronal laminar distribution in the cortical wall. Here, we demonstrate that the microRNA (miRNA) miR-210 is required for normal mouse NP cell-cycle progression. Overexpression of miR-210 promotes premature cell-cycle exit and terminal differentiation in NPs, resulting in an increase in early-born postmitotic neurons. Conversely, miR-210 knockdown promotes an increase in the radial glial cell population and delayed differentiation, resulting in an increase in late-born postmitotic neurons. Moreover, the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK7 is regulated by miR-210 and is necessary for normal NP cell-cycle progression. Our findings demonstrate that miRNAs are essential for normal NP proliferation and cell-cycle progress during neocortical development.

Abstract: Summary
Germline mutations in BRAF cause cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome (CFCS), whereby 40% of patients develop hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). As the role of the RAS/MAPK pathway in HCM pathogenesis is unclear, we generated a human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) model for CFCS from three patients with activating BRAF mutations. By cell sorting for SIRPα and CD90, we generated a method to examine hiPSC-derived cell type-specific phenotypes and cellular interactions underpinning HCM. BRAF-mutant SIRPα+/CD90− cardiomyocytes displayed cellular hypertrophy, pro-hypertrophic gene expression, and intrinsic calcium-handling defects. BRAF-mutant SIRPα−/CD90+ cells, which were fibroblast-like, exhibited a pro-fibrotic phenotype and partially modulated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy through transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) paracrine signaling. Inhibition of TGFβ or RAS/MAPK signaling rescued the hypertrophic phenotype. Thus, cell autonomous and non-autonomous defects underlie HCM due to BRAF mutations. TGFβ inhibition may be a useful therapeutic option for patients with HCM due to RASopathies or other etiologies.

Abstract: The spatial compartmentalisation of biochemical signalling pathways is essential for cell function. Nesprins are a multi-isomeric family of proteins that have emerged as signalling scaffolds, herein, we investigate the localisation and function of novel nesprin-2 N-terminal variants. We show that these nesprin-2 variants display cell specific distribution and reside in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that nesprin-2 N-terminal variants colocalised with β-catenin at cell-cell junctions in U2OS cells. Calcium switch assays demonstrated that nesprin-2 and β-catenin are lost from cell-cell junctions in low calcium conditions whereas emerin localisation at the NE remained unaltered, furthermore, an N-terminal fragment of nesprin-2 was sufficient for cell-cell junction localisation and interacted with β-catenin. Disruption of these N-terminal nesprin-2 variants, using siRNA depletion resulted in loss of β-catenin from cell-cell junctions, nuclear accumulation of active β-catenin and augmented β-catenin transcriptional activity. Importantly, we show that U2OS cells lack nesprin-2 giant, suggesting that the N-terminal nesprin-2 variants regulate β-catenin signalling independently of the NE. Together, these data identify N-terminal nesprin-2 variants as novel regulators of β-catenin signalling that tether β-catenin to cell-cell contacts to inhibit β-catenin transcriptional activity.

Abstract: Summary
Many solid cancers have an expanded CD44+/hi/CD24−/low cancer stem cell (CSC) population, which are relatively chemoresistant and drive recurrence and metastasis. Achieving a more durable response requires the development of therapies that specifically target CSCs. Recent evidence indicated that inhibiting the SUMO pathway repressed tumor growth and invasiveness, although the mechanism has yet to be clarified. Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of the SUMO pathway repressed MMP14 and CD44 with a concomitant reduction in cell invasiveness and functional loss of CSCs in basal breast cancer. Similar effects were demonstrated with a panel of E1 and E3 SUMO inhibitors. Identical results were obtained in a colorectal cancer cell line and primary colon cancer cells. In both breast and colon cancer, SUMO-unconjugated TFAP2A mediated the effects of SUMO inhibition. These data support the development of SUMO inhibitors as an approach to specifically target the CSC population in breast and colorectal cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication is strictly limited to the liver. Virions attach to hepatocytes through interactions of the viral PreS envelope protein domain with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). However, HSPG is ubiquitously present on many cell types, suggesting that HBV employs mechanisms to avoid attachment at extrahepatic sites. We demonstrate that HBV particles are released from cells in an inactive form with PreS hidden in the interior. These HSPG-non-binding (N-type) particles develop receptor binding competence by translocating PreS across the envelope onto their surface. Conversion into HSPG-binding (B-type) particles occurs spontaneously and renders HBV infectious. Low-dose inoculation of mice with human liver xenografts demonstrates superiority of N-type particles in establishing infections, while mature B-type virions, generated via N-type conversion, are profoundly impaired, correlating with non-selective accumulation in extrahepatic tissues. This dynamic topology switch represents a maturation process utilized by HBV to most likely avoid non-productive docking outside the liver.

Abstract: Summary
Pro-neural transcription factors and small molecules can induce the reprogramming of fibroblasts into functional neurons; however, the immediate-early molecular events that catalyze this conversion have not been well defined. We previously demonstrated that neurogenin 2 (NEUROG2), forskolin (F), and dorsomorphin (D) can reprogram fibroblasts into functional neurons with high efficiency. Here, we used this model to define the genetic and epigenetic events that initiate an acquisition of neuronal identity. We demonstrate that NEUROG2 is a pioneer factor, FD enhances chromatin accessibility and H3K27 acetylation, and synergistic transcription activated by these factors is essential to successful reprogramming. CREB1 promotes neuron survival and acts with NEUROG2 to upregulate SOX4, which co-activates NEUROD1 and NEUROD4. In addition, SOX4 targets SWI/SNF subunits and SOX4 knockdown results in extensive loss of open chromatin and abolishes reprogramming. Applying these insights, adult human glioblastoma cell and skin fibroblast reprogramming can be improved using SOX4 or chromatin-modifying chemicals.

Abstract: Summary
In contrast to stilbene biosynthesis by type III polyketide synthase in plants, in bacteria stilbene is produced by the collaboration of two enzymes in Photorhabdus luminescens: the unusual β-ketosynthase StlD catalyzes the condensation of the β-ketoacyl starter with an α,β-unsaturated-acyl substrate (two C-C bond-forming reactions) to produce isopropylstyrylcyclohexanedione, which is subsequently converted to stilbene by the aromatase StlC. Here we report the in vitro characterizations of StlD and StlC, and the X-ray crystal structures of StlD. Interestingly, structure-based mutagenesis demonstrated that His302, within the conserved Cys-His-Asn triad, is not essential for the enzyme reaction, while Glu154 functions as a base-catalyst to activate the β-ketoacyl intermediate bound to the catalytic Cys126. The structures also revealed the presence of a putative nucleophilic water molecule activated by hydrogen bond networks with Glu154 and Ser340, suggesting that StlD employs novel catalytic machinery for the condensation of two acyl substrates to produce the cyclohexanedione scaffold.

Abstract: Summary
Many tumors are dependent on de novo fatty acid synthesis to maintain cell growth. Fatty acid synthase (FASN) catalyzes the final synthetic step of this pathway, and its upregulation is correlated with tumor aggressiveness. The consequences and adaptive responses of acute or chronic inhibition of essential enzymes such as FASN are not fully understood. Herein we identify Fasnall, a thiophenopyrimidine selectively targeting FASN through its co-factor binding sites. Global lipidomics studies with Fasnall showed profound changes in cellular lipid profiles, sharply increasing ceramides, diacylglycerols, and unsaturated fatty acids as well as increasing exogenous palmitate uptake that is deviated more into neutral lipid formation rather than phospholipids. We also showed that the increase in ceramide levels contributes to some extent in the mediation of apoptosis. Consistent with this mechanism of action, Fasnall showed potent anti-tumor activity in the MMTV-Neu model of HER2+ breast cancer, particularly when combined with carboplatin.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria undergo frequent morphological changes through fission and fusion. Mutations in core members of the mitochondrial fission/fusion machinery are responsible for severe neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mitochondrial fission/fusion mechanisms are poorly understood. We found that the loss of a mitochondrial protein encoding gene, mitoguardin (miga), leads to mitochondrial defects and neurodegeneration in fly eyes. Mammals express two orthologs of miga: Miga1 and Miga2. Both MIGA1 and MIGA2 form homotypic and heterotypic complexes on the outer membrane of the mitochondria. Loss of MIGA results in fragmented mitochondria, whereas overexpression of MIGA leads to clustering and fusion of mitochondria in both fly and mammalian cells. MIGA proteins function downstream of mitofusin and interact with MitoPLD to stabilize MitoPLD and facilitate MitoPLD dimer formation. Therefore, we propose that MIGA proteins promote mitochondrial fusion by regulating mitochondrial phospholipid metabolism via MitoPLD.

Abstract: Upon diapause termination and exposure to favorable environmental conditions, cysts of the crustacean Artemia franciscana reinitiate development, a process dependent on the resumption of metabolic activity and the maintenance of protein homeostasis. The objective of the work described herein was to characterize molecular chaperones during post-diapause growth of A. franciscana. An Hsp40 complementary DNA (cDNA) termed ArHsp40 was cloned and shown to encode a protein with an amino-terminal J-domain containing a conserved histidine, proline, and aspartic acid (HPD) motif. Following the J-domain was a Gly/Phe (G/F) rich domain, a zinc-binding domain which contained a modified CXXCXGXG motif, and the carboxyl-terminal substrate binding region, all characteristics of type I Hsp40. Multiple alignment and protein modeling showed that ArHsp40 is comparable to Hsp40s from other eukaryotes and likely to be functionally similar. qRT-PCR revealed that during post-diapause development, ArHsp40 messenger RNA (mRNA) varied slightly until the E2/E3 stage and decreased significantly upon hatching. The immunoprobing of Western blots demonstrated that ArHsp40 was also relatively constant until E2/E3 and then declined dramatically. The drop in ArHsp40 when metabolism and protein synthesis were increasing was unexpected and demonstrated developmental regulation. The reduction in ArHsp40 at such an active life history stage indicates, as one possibility, that A. franciscana possesses additional Hsp40s, one or more of which replaces ArHsp40 as development progresses. Increased synthesis upon heat shock established that in addition to being developmentally regulated, ArHsp40 is stress inducible and, because it is found in mature cysts, ArHsp40 has the potential to contribute to stress tolerance during diapause.

Abstract: Summary
Naive and primed pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) and germ cells express the Oct4 gene. The Oct4 gene contains two cis-regulatory elements, the distal enhancer (DE) and proximal enhancer (PE), which differentially control Oct4 expression in a cell-type-specific and stage-specific manner. Here, we generated double transgenic mice carrying both Oct4-ΔPE-GFP and Oct4-ΔDE-tdTomato (RFP), enabling us to simultaneously monitor the activity of DE and PE. Oct4 expression is stage-specifically regulated by DE and PE during embryonic and germ cell development. Using this dual reporter system, we successfully cultured pure populations of naive (GFP+RFP−) and primed (GFP−RFP+) PSCs. We found that GFP+RFP− cells were metastable (not naive) in serum-containing medium; stable naive pluripotent cells were observed in medium containing two inhibitors (Meki and GSKi) but lacked serum. Finally, we suggest that the activity of Oct4 DE and PE is regulated by the repressive histone marks and DNA methylation in a cell-type-specific manner.

Abstract: The endoplasmic reticulum is the key organelle which controls protein folding, lipid biogenesis, and calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis. Cd exposure in Saccharomyces cerevisiae activated the unfolded protein response and was confirmed by the increased Kar2p expression. Cd exposure in wild-type (WT) cells increased PC levels and the PC biosynthetic genes. Deletion of the two phospholipid methyltransferases CHO2 and OPI3 modulated PC, TAG levels and the lipid droplets with cadmium exposure. Interestingly, we noticed an increase in the calcium levels upon Cd exposure in the mutant cells. This study concluded that Cd interrupted calcium homeostasis-induced lipid dysregulation leading to ER stress.

Abstract: Summary
Pre-clinical studies indicate that neural stem cells (NSCs) can limit or reverse CNS damage through direct cell replacement, promotion of regeneration, or delivery of therapeutic agents. Immortalized NSC lines are in growing demand due to the inherent limitations of adult patient-derived NSCs, including availability, expandability, potential for genetic modifications, and costs. Here, we describe the generation and characterization of a new human fetal NSC line, immortalized by transduction with L-MYC (LM-NSC008) that in vitro displays both self-renewal and multipotent differentiation into neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes. These LM-NSC008 cells were non-tumorigenic in vivo, and migrated to orthotopic glioma xenografts in immunodeficient mice. When administered intranasally, LM-NSC008 distributed specifically to sites of traumatic brain injury (TBI). These data support the therapeutic development of immortalized LM-NSC008 cells for allogeneic use in TBI and other CNS diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Embryonic stem cells (ESC) have the potential to generate all the cell lineages that form the body. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying ESC differentiation and especially the role of alternative splicing in this process remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the alternative splicing regulator MBNL1 promotes generation of the atypical calcineurin Aβ variant CnAβ1 in mouse ESCs (mESC). CnAβ1 has a unique C-terminal domain that drives its localization mainly to the Golgi apparatus by interacting with Cog8. CnAβ1 regulates the intracellular localization and activation of the mTORC2 complex. CnAβ1 knockdown results in delocalization of mTORC2 from the membrane to the cytoplasm, inactivation of the AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling pathway, and defective mesoderm specification. In summary, here we unveil the structural basis for the mechanism of action of CnAβ1 and its role in the differentiation of mESCs to the mesodermal lineage.

Abstract: Summary
In humans, the cytosolic sulfotransferases (SULTs) catalyze regiospecific transfer of the sulfuryl moiety (–SO3) from 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate to thousands of metabolites, including numerous signaling small molecules, and thus regulates their activities and half-lives. Imbalances in the in vivo set points of these reactions leads to disease. Here, with the goal of controlling sulfonation in vivo, molecular ligand-recognition principles in the SULT and nuclear receptor families are integrated in creating a strategy that can prevent sulfonation of a compound without significantly altering its receptor affinity, or inhibiting SULTS. The strategy is validated by using it to control the sulfonation and estrogen receptor (ER) activating activity of raloxifene (a US Food and Drug Administration-approved selective estrogen receptor modulator) and its derivatives. Preventing sulfonation is shown to enhance ER-activation efficacy 104-fold in studies using Ishikawa cells. The strategy offers the opportunity to control sulfuryl transfer on a compound-by-compound basis, to enhance the efficacy of sulfonated drugs, and to explore the biology of sulfuryl transfer with unprecedented precision.

Abstract: Summary
Induction of type I interferon (IFN) in response to microbial pathogens depends on a conserved cGAS-STING signaling pathway. The presence of DNA in the cytoplasm activates cGAS, while STING is activated by cyclic dinucleotides (cdNs) produced by cGAS or from bacterial origins. Here, we show that Group B Streptococcus (GBS) induces IFN-β production almost exclusively through cGAS-STING-dependent recognition of bacterial DNA. However, we find that GBS expresses an ectonucleotidase, CdnP, which hydrolyzes extracellular bacterial cyclic-di-AMP. Inactivation of CdnP leads to c-di-AMP accumulation outside the bacteria and increased IFN-β production. Higher IFN-β levels in vivo increase GBS killing by the host. The IFN-β overproduction observed in the absence of CdnP is due to the cumulative effect of DNA sensing by cGAS and STING-dependent sensing of c-di-AMP. These findings describe the importance of a bacterial c-di-AMP ectonucleotidase and suggest a direct bacterial mechanism that dampens activation of the cGAS-STING axis.

Abstract: Summary
G-quadruplexes are specialized secondary structures in nucleic acids that possess significant conformational polymorphisms. The precise G-quadruplex conformations in vivo and their relevance to biological functions remain controversial and unclear, especially for telomeric G-quadruplexes. Here, we report a novel single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody, D1, with high binding selectivity for parallel G-quadruplexes in vitro and in vivo. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation using D1 and deep-sequencing revealed the consensus sequence for parallel G-quadruplex formation, which is characterized by G-rich sequence with a short loop size (<3 nt). By using D1, telomeric parallel G-quadruplex was identified and its formation was regulated by small molecular ligands targeting and telomere replication. Together, parallel G-quadruplex specific antibody D1 was found to be a valuable tool for determination of G-quadruplex and its conformation, which will prompt further studies on the structure of G-quadruplex and its biological implication in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Semaphorin axonal guidance factors are multifunctional proteins that play important roles in immune response, cancer cell proliferation, and organogenesis, making semaphorins and their signaling receptor plexins important drug targets for various diseases. However, the large and flat binding surface of the semaphorin-plexin interaction interface is difficult to target by traditional small-molecule drugs. Here, we report the discovery of a high-affinity plexin B1 (PlxnB1)-binding macrocyclic peptide, PB1m6 (KD = 3.5 nM). PB1m6 specifically inhibited the binding of physiological ligand semaphorin 4D (Sema4D) in vitro and completely suppressed Sema4D-induced cell collapse. Structural studies revealed that PB1m6 binds at a groove between the fifth and sixth blades of the sema domain in PlxnB1 distant from the Sema4D-binding site, indicating the non-competitive and allosteric nature of the inhibitory activity. The discovery of this novel allosteric site can potentially be used to target plexin family proteins for the development of drugs that modulate semaphorin and plexin signaling.

Abstract: The mechanisms underlying oxidative stress (OS) resistance are not completely clear. Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) is a good organism model to study OS because it displays stress responses similar to those in mammals. Among these mechanisms, the insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) pathway is thought to affect GABAergic neurotransmission. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of heat shock stress (HS) on GABAergic activity in C. elegans. For this purpose, we tested the effect of exposure to picrotoxin (PTX), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), hydrogen peroxide, and HS on the occurrence of a shrinking response (SR) after nose touch stimulus in N2 (WT) worms. Moreover, the effect of HS on the expression of UNC-49 (GABAA receptor ortholog) in the EG1653 strain and the effect of GABA and PTX exposure on HSP-16.2 expression in the TJ375 strain were analyzed. PTX 1 mM- or H2O2 0.7 mM-exposed worms displayed a SR in about 80 % of trials. GABA exposure did not cause a SR. HS prompted the occurrence of a SR as did PTX 1mM or H2O2 0.7mM exposure. In addition, HS increased UNC-49 expression, and PTX augmented HSP-16.2 expression. Thus, the results of the present study suggest that oxidative stress, through either H2O2 exposure or application of heat shock, inactivates the GABAergic system, which subsequently would affect the oxidative stress response, perhaps by enhancing the activity of transcription factors DAF-16 and HSF-1, both regulated by the IIS pathway and related to hsp-16.2 expression.

Abstract: Although accumulating evidence indicates that heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) could be secreted into plasma and its levels have been found to have an ambiguous association with atherosclerosis, our knowledge for the exact role of circulating HSP70 in the development of atherosclerosis is still limited. In the present study, we report an adhesion-promoting effect of exogenous HSP70 and evaluate the potential involvement of elevated circulating HSP70 in the development of atherosclerosis. Time-dependent elevation of plasma HSP70 was found in diet-induced atherosclerotic rats, whose effect was investigated through further in vitro experiments. In rat aortic endothelial cell (RAEC) cultures, exogenous HSP70 incubation neither produced cell injuries by itself nor had protective effects on cell injuries caused by Ox-LDL or homocysteine. However, exogenous HSP70 administration could lead to a higher adhesion rate between rat peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) and RAECs. This adhesion-promoting effect appeared only when PBMCs, rather than RAECs, were pretreated with HSP70 incubation. PBMCs in an HSP70 environment released more IL-6 to supernatant, which subsequently up-regulated the expression of ICAM-1 in RAECs. These results indicate that the diet-induced elevation of circulating HSP70 could trigger cell adhesion with the help of IL-6 as a mediator, which provides a novel possible mechanism for understanding the role of circulating HSP70 in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Summary
Interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) restrict the entry of diverse enveloped viruses through incompletely understood mechanisms. While IFITMs are reported to inhibit HIV-1, their in vivo relevance is unclear. We show that IFITM sensitivity of HIV-1 strains is determined by the co-receptor usage of the viral envelope glycoproteins as well as IFITM subcellular localization within the target cell. Importantly, we find that transmitted founder HIV-1, which establishes de novo infections, is uniquely resistant to the antiviral activity of IFITMs. However, viral sensitivity to IFITMs, particularly IFITM2 and IFITM3, increases over the first 6 months of infection, primarily as a result of neutralizing antibody escape mutations. Additionally, the ability to evade IFITM restriction contributes to the different interferon sensitivities of transmitted founder and chronic viruses. Together, these data indicate that IFITMs constitute an important barrier to HIV-1 transmission and that escape from adaptive immune responses exposes the virus to antiviral restriction.

Abstract: Intramuscular adipose tissue and fibrous tissue are observed in some skeletal muscle pathologies such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy and sarcopenia, and affect muscle strength and myogenesis. They originate from common fibrogenic/adipogenic cells in the skeletal muscle. Thus, elucidating the regulatory mechanisms underlying fibrogenic/adipogenic cell differentiation is an important step toward the mediation of these disorders. Previously, we established a highly adipogenic progenitor clone, 2G11, from rat skeletal muscle and showed that basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is pro-adipogenic in these cells. Here, we demonstrated that 2G11 cells give rise to fibroblasts upon transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 stimulation, indicating that they possess mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPC)-like characteristics. The previously reported MPC marker PDGFRα is expressed in other cell populations. Accordingly, we produced monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to 2G11 cell surface antigens and identified chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4) as a potential MPC marker. Based on an RNA interference analysis, we found that CSPG4 is involved in both the pro-adipogenic effect of bFGF and in TGF-β-induced alpha smooth muscle actin expression and stress fiber formation. By establishing an additional marker for MPC detection and characterizing its role in fibrogenic/adipogenic differentiation, these results will facilitate the development of effective treatments for skeletal muscle pathologies.

Abstract: Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are molecular chaperones subdivided into several families based on their molecular weight. Due to their cytoprotective roles, these proteins may help protect cancer cells against chemotherapy-induced cell death. Investigation into the biologic activity of HSPs in a variety of cancers including primary bone tumors, such as osteosarcoma (OSA), is of great interest. Both human and canine OSA tumor samples have aberrant production of HSP70. This study assessed the response of canine OSA cells to inhibition of HSP70 and GRP78 by the ATP-mimetic VER-155008 and whether this treatment strategy could sensitize cells to doxorubicin chemotherapy. Single-agent VER-155008 treatment decreased cellular viability and clonogenic survival and increased apoptosis in canine OSA cell lines. However, combination schedules with doxorubicin after pretreatment with VER-155008 did not improve inhibition of cellular viability, apoptosis, or clonogenic survival. Treatment with VER-155008 prior to chemotherapy resulted in an upregulation of target proteins HSP70 and GRP78 in addition to the co-chaperone proteins Herp, C/EBP homologous transcription protein (CHOP), and BAG-1. The increased GRP78 was more cytoplasmic in location compared to untreated cells. Single-agent treatment also revealed a dose-dependent reduction in activated and total Akt. Based on these results, targeting GRP78 and HSP70 may have biologic activity in canine osteosarcoma. Further studies are required to determine if and how this strategy may impact the response of osteosarcoma cells to chemotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
The cellular factor serine incorporator 5 (SERINC5) impairs HIV-1 infectivity but is antagonized by the viral Nef protein. We analyzed the anti-SERINC5 activity of Nef proteins across primate lentiviruses and examined whether SERINC5 represents a barrier to cross-species transmissions and/or within-species viral spread. HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV Nefs counteract human, ape, monkey, and murine SERINC5 orthologs with similar potency. However, HIV-1 Nefs are more active against SERINC5 than HIV-2 Nefs, and chimpanzee SIV (SIVcpz) Nefs are more potent than those of their monkey precursors. Additionally, Nefs of HIV and most SIVs rely on the dileucine motif in the C-terminal loop for anti-SERINC5 activity, while the Nef from colobus SIV (SIVcol) evolved different inhibitory mechanisms. We also found a significant correlation between anti-SERINC5 potency and the SIV prevalence in the respective ape and monkey species. Thus, Nef-mediated SERINC5 antagonism may determine the ability of primate lentiviruses to spread within natural hosts.

Abstract: The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA) by stimulating several mediators that contribute to cartilage degradation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects and mechanism of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) inhibitors HMGB1 A-box on the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and the production of inflammatory mediators in human osteoarthritis chondrocytes after activation by IL-1β. We found that the overexpression of HMGB1 A-box significantly decreased the IL-1β-stimulated the production of MMP-1, MMP-3 and MMP-9, and also reduced the elevated levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) associated with the inhibition of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and nitric oxide (NO) production in IL-1β-stimulated chondrocytes. In addition, overexpression of the HMGB1 A-box significantly inhibited the up-regulation of ADAMTS-4, ADAMTS-5 and HMGB1 caused by IL-1β in chondrocytes. Moreover, the overexpression of HMGB1 A-box markedly suppressed the IL-1β-mediated activation of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TRL4)/NF-κB pathway. Our observations indicated that the HMGB1 A-box can play a protective role by suppressing the IL-1β-induced expression of MMPs and that the production of inflammatory mediators in chondrocytes was associated with suppression of the HMGB1/TLR4/NF-κB pathway. In conclusion, HMGB1 A-box relieves the development of OA that may be associated with regulating the HMGB1/TLR4/NF-κB pathway.

Abstract: KRAS mutant lung cancers have long been considered as untreatable with drugs. Transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) appears to play an anti-apoptotic role in response to multiple stresses and has been reported to be a responsive kinase that regulates cell survival in KRAS-dependent cells. In this study, in order to find a useful approach to treat KRAS mutant lung cancer, we focused on the combined effects of 5Z-7-oxozeaenol, a TAK1 inhibitor, with hyperthermia (HT) in KRAS mutant lung cancer cell line A549. Annexin V-FITC/PI assay, cell cycle analysis, and colony formation assay revealed a significant enhancement in apoptosis induced by HT treatment, when the cells were pre-incubated with 5Z-7-oxozeaenol in a dose-dependent manner. The enhanced apoptosis by 5Z-7-oxozeaenol was accompanied by a significant increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). In addition, western blot showed that 5Z-7-oxozeaenol enhanced HT-induced expressions of cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-8, and HSP70 and decreased HT-induced expressions of Bcl-2, p-p38, p-JNK, and LC3. Moreover, 5Z-7-oxozeaenol pre-treatment resulted in a marked elevation of intracellular calcium level which might be associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related pathway. Taken together, our data provides further insights of the mechanism of action of 5Z-7-oxozeaenol and HT treatment, and their potential application as a novel approache to treat patients with KRAS mutant lung cancer.

Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms by which mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) interact with the physical properties (e.g. topography, charge, ζ-potential, and contact angle) of polymeric surfaces is essential to design new biomaterials capable of regulating stem cell behavior. The present study investigated the ability of two polymers (pHM1 and pHM3) with different positive surface charge densities to modulate the differentiation of MSCs into osteoblast-like phenotype via cell-cell ephrinB2/EphB4 signaling. Although pHM1 promoted the phosphorylation of EphB4, leading to cell differentiation, pHM3, characterized by a high positive surface charge density, had no significant effect on EphB4 activation or MSCs differentiation. When the MSCs were cultured on pHM1 in the presence of a forward signaling blocking peptide, the osteoblast differentiation was compromised. Our results demonstrated that the ephrinB2/EphB4 interaction was required for MSCs differentiation into an osteoblast-like phenotype and that the presence of a high positive surface charge density altered this interaction.

Abstract: Summary
Successful treatment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection typically requires a complex regimen administered over at least 6 months. Interestingly, many of the antibiotics used to treat M. tuberculosis are prodrugs that require intracellular activation. Here, we describe three small molecules, active against both replicating and non-replicating M. tuberculosis, that require activation by Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs). Two molecules require BVMO EthA (Rv3854c) for activation and the third molecule requires the BVMO MymA (Rv3083). While EthA is known to activate the antitubercular drug ethionamide, this is the first description of MymA as an activating enzyme of a prodrug. Furthermore, we found that MymA also plays a role in activating ethionamide, with loss of MymA function resulting in ethionamide-resistant M. tuberculosis. These findings suggest overlap in function and specificity of the BVMOs in M. tuberculosis.

Abstract: Summary
Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are modular enzymatic assembly lines where substrates and intermediates undergo rounds of transformation catalyzed by adenylation (A), condensation (C), and thioesterase (TE) domains. Central to the NRPS biosynthesis are peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domains, small, catalytically inactive domains that shuttle substrates and intermediates between the catalytic modules and govern product release from TE domains. There is strong interest in recombination of NRPS systems to generate new chemical entities. However, the intrinsic complexity of these systems has been a major challenge. Here, we employ domain substitution and random mutagenesis to recapitulate NRPS evolution, focusing on PCP domains. Using NRPS model systems that produce two different pigmented molecules, pyoverdine and indigoidine, we found that only evolutionarily specialized recombinant PCP domains could interact effectively with the native TE domain for product release. Overall, we highlight that substituted PCP domains require very minor changes to result in functional NRPSs, and infer that positive selection pressure may improve recombinant NRPS outcomes.

Abstract: Summary
Neural stem/progenitor cells (NS/PCs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are considered to be a promising cell source for cell-based interventions that target CNS disorders. We previously reported that transplanting certain hiPSC-NS/PCs in the spinal cord results in tumor-like overgrowth of hiPSC-NS/PCs and subsequent deterioration of motor function. Remnant immature cells should be removed or induced into more mature cell types to avoid adverse effects of hiPSC-NS/PC transplantation. Because Notch signaling plays a role in maintaining NS/PCs, we evaluated the effects of γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI) and found that pretreating hiPSC-NS/PCs with GSI promoted neuronal differentiation and maturation in vitro, and GSI pretreatment also reduced the overgrowth of transplanted hiPSC-NS/PCs and inhibited the deterioration of motor function in vivo. These results indicate that pretreatment with hiPSC-NS/PCs decreases the proliferative capacity of transplanted hiPSC-NS/PCs, triggers neuronal commitment, and improves the safety of hiPSC-based approaches in regenerative medicine.

Abstract: Summary
Quorum sensing (QS) is a bacterial communication mechanism in which secreted signaling molecules impact population function and gene expression. QS-like phenomena have been reported in eukaryotes with largely unknown contributing molecules, functions, and mechanisms. We identify Qsp1, a secreted peptide, as a central signaling molecule that regulates virulence in the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans. QSP1 is a direct target of three transcription factors required for virulence, and qsp1Δ mutants exhibit attenuated infection, slowed tissue accumulation, and greater control by primary macrophages. Qsp1 mediates autoregulatory signaling that modulates secreted protease activity and promotes cell wall function at high cell densities. Peptide production requires release from a secreted precursor, proQsp1, by a cell-associated protease, Pqp1. Qsp1 sensing requires an oligopeptide transporter, Opt1, and remarkably, cytoplasmic expression of mature Qsp1 complements multiple phenotypes of qsp1Δ. Thus, C. neoformans produces an autoregulatory peptide that matures extracellularly but functions intracellularly to regulate virulence.

Abstract: Summary
E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell junctions play a prominent role in maintaining the epithelial architecture. The disruption or deregulation of these adhesions in cancer can lead to the collapse of tumor epithelia that precedes invasion and subsequent metastasis. Here we generated an E-cadherin-GFP mouse that enables intravital photobleaching and quantification of E-cadherin mobility in live tissue without affecting normal biology. We demonstrate the broad applications of this mouse by examining E-cadherin regulation in multiple tissues, including mammary, brain, liver, and kidney tissue, while specifically monitoring E-cadherin mobility during disease progression in the pancreas. We assess E-cadherin stability in native pancreatic tissue upon genetic manipulation involving Kras and p53 or in response to anti-invasive drug treatment and gain insights into the dynamic remodeling of E-cadherin during in situ cancer progression. FRAP in the E-cadherin-GFP mouse, therefore, promises to be a valuable tool to fundamentally expand our understanding of E-cadherin-mediated events in native microenvironments.

Abstract: Summary
Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are promising therapeutic candidates given their potent immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory secretome. However, controlling the MSC secretome post-transplantation is considered a major challenge that hinders their clinical efficacy. To address this, we used a microparticle-based engineering approach to non-genetically modulate pro-inflammatory pathways in human MSCs (hMSCs) under simulated inflammatory conditions. Here we show that microparticles loaded with TPCA-1, a small-molecule NF-κB inhibitor, when delivered to hMSCs can attenuate secretion of pro-inflammatory factors for at least 6 days in vitro. Conditioned medium (CM) derived from TPCA-1-loaded hMSCs also showed reduced ability to attract human monocytes and prevented differentiation of human cardiac fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, compared with CM from untreated or TPCA-1-preconditioned hMSCs. Thus, we provide a broadly applicable bioengineering solution to facilitate intracellular sustained release of agents that modulate signaling. We propose that this approach could be harnessed to improve control over MSC secretome post-transplantation, especially to prevent adverse remodeling post-myocardial infarction.

Abstract: Summary
VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) signaling inhibitors are widely used in different cancer types; however, patient selection remains a challenge. Analyses of samples from a phase III clinical trial in metastatic colorectal cancer testing chemotherapy versus chemotherapy with the small molecule VEGF receptors inhibitor cediranib identified circulating leptin levels, BMI, and a tumor metabolic and angiogenic gene expression signature associated with improved clinical outcome in patients treated with cediranib. Patients with a glycolytic and hypoxic/angiogenic profile were associated with increased benefit from cediranib, whereas patients with a high lipogenic, oxidative phosphorylation and serine biosynthesis signature did not gain benefit. These findings translated to pre-clinical tumor xenograft models where the same metabolic gene expression profiles were associated with in vivo sensitivity to cediranib as monotherapy. These findings suggest a link between patient physiology, tumor biology, and response to antiangiogenics, which may guide patient selection for VEGF therapy in the future.

Abstract: Summary
Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) represent an innovative source for the standardized in vitro generation of macrophages (Mφ). We here describe a robust and efficient protocol to obtain mature and functional Mφ from healthy as well as disease-specific murine iPSCs. With regard to morphology, surface phenotype, and function, our iPSC-derived Mφ (iPSC-Mφ) closely resemble their counterparts generated in vitro from bone marrow cells. Moreover, when we investigated the feasibility of our differentiation system to serve as a model for rare congenital diseases associated with Mφ malfunction, we were able to faithfully recapitulate the pathognomonic defects in GM-CSF signaling and Mφ function present in hereditary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (herPAP). Thus, our studies may help to overcome the limitations placed on research into certain rare disease entities by the lack of an adequate supply of disease-specific primary cells, and may aid the development of novel therapeutic approaches for herPAP patients.

Abstract: Summary
The transcriptional regulator CITED2 is essential for heart development. Here, we investigated the role of CITED2 in the specification of cardiac cell fate from mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC). The overexpression of CITED2 in undifferentiated ESC was sufficient to promote cardiac cell emergence upon differentiation. Conversely, the depletion of Cited2 at the onset of differentiation resulted in a decline of ESC ability to generate cardiac cells. Moreover, loss of Cited2 expression impairs the expression of early mesoderm markers and cardiogenic transcription factors (Isl1, Gata4, Tbx5). The cardiogenic defects in Cited2-depleted cells were rescued by treatment with recombinant CITED2 protein. We showed that Cited2 expression is enriched in cardiac progenitors either derived from ESC or mouse embryonic hearts. Finally, we demonstrated that CITED2 and ISL1 proteins interact physically and cooperate to promote ESC differentiation toward cardiomyocytes. Collectively, our results show that Cited2 plays a pivotal role in cardiac commitment of ESC.

miR-106b-5p and miR-17-5p suppress osteogenic differentiation by targeting Smad5 and inhibit bone formation,

Abstract: Osteogenesis is a complex process which relies on the coordination of signals and transcription factors. BMP-2/Smad5 signal transduction pathway plays an important role in the process. Recent evidence indicates that microRNAs (miRNAs) act as important post-transcriptional regulators in a large number of biological processes including osteoblast differentiation. In this study, we investigated the effect of miR-106b-5p and miR-17-5p on osteogenic differentiation. We observed an obvious decreasement in miR-106b-5p and miR-17-5p levels during osteogenic differentiation. By using gain- and loss-of function experiments, we noticed that miR-106b-5p and miR-17-5p could suppress the osteogenic differentiation of C2C12 and MC3T3-E1 cells. In addition, we performed bioinformatic analysis, western blot and luciferase reporter assay to confirm that miR-106b-5p and miR-17-5p could regulate Smad5 expression negatively. When we inhibited Smad5 expression by siRNA, the effects of miR-106b-5p and miR-17-5p inhibition on osteogenesis of C2C12 cells could be significantly reversed by Smad5 RNA interference. Furthermore, silencing of miR-106b-5p and miR-17-5p in sham and ovariectomized (OVX) mice increased bone formation and bone mass, resulting in an improvement of trabecular microarchitecture. Taken together, these data showed that miR-106b-5p and miR-17-5p are novel Smad5 regulators, and they have a crucially physiological function in bone formation and osteoblast differentiation.

Abstract: The production of major human heat shock protein Hsp70 (HSPA1A) in a eukaryotic expression system is needed for testing and possible medical applications. In this study, transgenic mice were produced containing wild-type human Hsp70 allele in the vector providing expression in the milk. The results indicated that human Hsp70 was readily expressed in the transgenic animals but did not apparently preserve its intact structure and, hence, it was not possible to purify the protein using conventional isolation techniques. It was suggested that the protein underwent glycosylation in the process of expression, and this quite common modification for proteins expressed in the milk complicated its isolation. To check this possibility, we mutated all presumptive sites of glycosylation and tested the properties of the resulting modified Hsp70 expressed in E. coli. The investigation demonstrated that the modified protein exhibited all beneficial properties of the wild-type Hsp70 and was even superior to the latter for a few parameters. Based on these results, a transgenic mouse strain was obtained which expressed the modified Hsp70 in milk and which was easy to isolate using ATP columns. Therefore, the developed construct can be explored in various bioreactors for reliable manufacture of high quality, uniform, and reproducible human Hsp70 for possible medical applications including neurodegenerative diseases and cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Many pathogens evade cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) by downregulating HLA molecules on infected cells, but the loss of HLA can trigger NK cell-mediated lysis. HIV-1 is thought to subvert CTLs while preserving NK cell inhibition by Nef-mediated downregulation of HLA-A and -B but not HLA-C molecules. We find that HLA-C is downregulated by most primary HIV-1 clones, including transmitted founder viruses, in contrast to the laboratory-adapted NL4-3 virus. HLA-C reduction is mediated by viral Vpu and reduces the ability of HLA-C restricted CTLs to suppress viral replication in CD4+ cells in vitro. HLA-A/B are unaffected by Vpu, and primary HIV-1 clones vary in their ability to downregulate HLA-C, possibly in response to whether CTLs or NK cells dominate immune pressure through HLA-C. HIV-2 also suppresses HLA-C expression through distinct mechanisms, underscoring the immune pressure HLA-C exerts on HIV. This viral immune evasion casts new light on the roles of CTLs and NK cells in immune responses against HIV.

Abstract: Summary
The transition of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) from pluripotency to lineage commitment is not fully understood, and a role for phenotypic transcription factors in the initial stages of hESC differentiation remains to be explored. From a screen of candidate factors, we found that RUNX1 is selectively and transiently upregulated early in hESC differentiation to mesendodermal lineages. Transcriptome profiling and functional analyses upon RUNX1 depletion established a role for RUNX1 in promoting cell motility. In parallel, we discovered a loss of repression for several epithelial genes, indicating that loss of RUNX1 impaired an epithelial to mesenchymal transition during differentiation. Cell biological and biochemical approaches revealed that RUNX1 depletion specifically compromised TGFB2 signaling. Both the decrease in motility and deregulated epithelial marker expression upon RUNX1 depletion were rescued by reintroduction of TGFB2, but not TGFB1. These findings identify roles for RUNX1-TGFB2 signaling in early events of mesendodermal lineage commitment.

Abstract: The association between alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and the inflammatory response remains controversial. The aim of this study was to explore this association between ALD and inflammation. We enrolled 214 male participants, who were divided into three age-matched groups: ALD (n = 135), chronic alcohol ingestion without ALD (non-ALD; n = 42), and control (n = 37). The BMI was significantly higher in the ALD group than in the non-ALD and control groups (all P = 0.000). Further, the constituent ratio of the liver inflammatory level was significantly higher in the ALD group than in the non-ALD and control groups (P = 0.002 and P = 0.000, respectively). In addition, the median serum ALT, AST, and GGT levels were significantly higher in the ALD group than in the control group (P = 0.023, P = 0.008, and P = 0.000, respectively); these levels were also significantly higher in the ALD group than in the non-ALD group (P = 0.013, P = 0.010, and P = 0.000, respectively). The median serum CRP level was significantly higher in the ALD group than in the non-ALD and control groups (P = 0.006 and P = 0.000, respectively). Further, the median serum TNF-α level was significantly lower in the ALD group than in the non-ALD and control groups (P = 0.004 and P = 0.000, respectively). The median serum sOX40L and HSP70 levels were significantly lower in the ALD group than in the control group (P = 0.008 and P = 0.018, respectively). In addition, the ALT, AST, and GGT levels were positively correlated with the CRP level (r = 0.211, P = 0.002; r = 0.220, P = 0.001 and r = 0.295, P = 0.000, respectively), and the GGT level was negatively correlated with the TNF-α (r = −0.225, P = 0.001), sOX40L (r = −0.165, P = 0.016), and HSP70 levels (r = −0.178, P = 0.009). Further, the Cr level was negatively correlated with the IL-10 level (r = −0.166, P = 0.015). Logistic regression analysis verified that the BMI (OR  =  1.637, 95%CI: 1.374–1.951, P  =  0.000) and GGT level were significantly higher (OR  =  1.039, 95%CI: 1.020–1.059, P  =  0.000) and that the TNF-α (OR  =  0.998, 95%CI: 0.996–1.000, P  =  0.030) and HSP70 levels were significantly lower (OR  =  1.017, 95%CI: 1.003–1.031, P  =  0.029) in the ALD group than in the non-ALD group. Further, the moderate-to-severe ALD patients had a significantly higher serum CRP level (Or =   1.349, 95%CI: 1.066–1.702, P  =  0.013) and significantly lower HSP60 (OR  =  0.965, 95%CI: 0.938–0.993, P  =  0.014) and HSP70 levels (OR  =  0.978, 95%CI: 0.962–0.995, P  =  0.010) than the mild ALD patients. These results suggest that ALD patients may present with obesity, liver damage, and an imbalanced inflammatory immune response, mainly manifesting as decreased levels of immune inflammatory cytokines. In addition, they suggest that certain liver and kidney function parameters and ALD severity are either positively or negatively correlated with certain inflammatory cytokines. Hence, ALD patients may be at increased risks of obesity- and inflammation-related diseases. Accordingly, to control the inflammatory response, preventative measures for patients with this disease should include weight control and protection of liver and kidney function.

Abstract: Aquatic animals suffer from various environmental stresses because the aquatic environment is a very complex system. To monitor the health status of fish, Hsp90 a potential early warning marker was determined in Schizothorax prenanti after infection with a bacterium. In this study, we cloned Hsp90 from S. prenanti for the first time. The full-length cDNA sequence of SpHsp90 was 2663 bp, contains an open reading frame of 2181 bp, and has a gene encoding 726 amino acids, an estimated molecular mass of 83.38 kDa, and a theoretical isoelectric point of 4.91. The SpHsp90 amino acid sequence has five conserved HSP90 family signatures and shares 87.0–95.5 % identity with other vertebrates. Phylogenetic analysis and structure comparison indicated that SpHsp90 should be a β isoform of the HSP90 family. SpHsp90 was ubiquitously expressed in all examined tissues, and the highest level of expression was in the kidney. After Streptococcus agalactiae infection, the level of SpHsp90 expression had significant changes (P < 0.05) in the hepatopancreas, spleen, kidney, and blood. The expression increased to the highest level at 6 h in the blood and at 24 h in the hepatopancreas, spleen, and kidney. The results suggested that the SpHsp90 gene could be induced by S. agalactiae in S. prenanti and that SpHsp90 may be involved in resistance to bacterial infection and provide an early warning information. The kidney is the most suitable for detecting SpHsp90 after bacterial infection.

Abstract: Summary
Genome-wide profiling of histone modifications can provide systematic insight into the regulatory elements and programs engaged in a given cell type. However, conventional chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) does not capture quantitative information on histone modification levels, requires large amounts of starting material, and involves tedious processing of each individual sample. Here, we address these limitations with a technology that leverages DNA barcoding to profile chromatin quantitatively and in multiplexed format. We concurrently map relative levels of multiple histone modifications across multiple samples, each comprising as few as a thousand cells. We demonstrate the technology by monitoring dynamic changes following inhibition of p300, EZH2, or KDM5, by linking altered epigenetic landscapes to chromatin regulator mutations, and by mapping active and repressive marks in purified human hematopoietic stem cells. Hence, this technology enables quantitative studies of chromatin state dynamics across rare cell types, genotypes, environmental conditions, and drug treatments.

Abstract: Summary
Electron microscopy (EM) remains the primary method for imaging cellular and tissue ultrastructure, although simultaneous localization of multiple specific molecules continues to be a challenge for EM. We present a method for obtaining multicolor EM views of multiple subcellular components. The method uses sequential, localized deposition of different lanthanides by photosensitizers, small-molecule probes, or peroxidases. Detailed view of biological structures is created by overlaying conventional electron micrographs with pseudocolor lanthanide elemental maps derived from distinctive electron energy-loss spectra of each lanthanide deposit via energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy. This results in multicolor EM images analogous to multicolor fluorescence but with the benefit of the full spatial resolution of EM. We illustrate the power of this methodology by visualizing hippocampal astrocytes to show that processes from two astrocytes can share a single synapse. We also show that polyarginine-based cell-penetrating peptides enter the cell via endocytosis, and that newly synthesized PKMζ in cultured neurons preferentially localize to the postsynaptic membrane.

Abstract: Summary
Antibiotic resistance is a rapidly evolving health concern that requires a sustained effort to understand mechanisms of resistance and to develop new agents that overcome those mechanisms. The dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibitor, trimethoprim (TMP), remains one of the most important orally administered antibiotics. However, resistance through chromosomal mutations and mobile, plasmid-encoded insensitive DHFRs threatens the continued use of this agent. We are pursuing the development of new propargyl-linked antifolate (PLA) DHFR inhibitors designed to evade these mechanisms. While analyzing contemporary TMP-resistant clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant and sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, we discovered two mobile resistance elements, dfrG and dfrK. This is the first identification of these resistance mechanisms in the United States. These resistant organisms were isolated from a variety of infection sites, show clonal diversity, and each contain distinct resistance genotypes for common antibiotics. Several PLAs showed significant activity against these resistant strains by direct inhibition of the TMP resistance elements.

Abstract: Neuroinflammation is closely associated with the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson’s disease (PD). Recent evidence indicates that astrocytes also play pro-inflammatory roles in the central nervous system (CNS) by activation with toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands. Therefore, targeting anti-inflammation may provide a promising therapeutic strategy for PD. Curcumin, a polyphenolic compound isolated from Curcuma longa root, has been commonly used for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the details of how curcumin exerts neuroprotection remain uncertain. Here, we investigated the protective effect of curcumin on 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion-(MPP+-) stimulated primary astrocytes. Our results showed that MPP+ stimulation resulted in significant production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL-6), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in primary mesencephalic astrocytes. Curcumin pretreatment decreased the levels of these pro-inflammatory cytokines while increased IL-10 expression in MPP+-stimulated astrocytes. In addition, curcumin increased the levels of antioxidant glutathione (GSH) and reduced ROS production. Our results further showed that curcumin decreased the levels of TLR4 and its downstream effectors including NF-κB, IRF3, MyD88, and TIRF that are induced by MPP+ as well as inhibited the immunoreactivity of TLR4 and morphological activation in MPP+-stimulated astrocytes. Together, data suggest that curcumin might exert a beneficial effect on neuroinflammation in the pathophysiology of PD.

Abstract: Summary
In fragile X syndrome (FXS), CGG repeat expansion greater than 200 triplets is believed to trigger FMR1 gene silencing and disease etiology. However, FXS siblings have been identified with more than 200 CGGs, termed unmethylated full mutation (UFM) carriers, without gene silencing and disease symptoms. Here, we show that hypomethylation of the FMR1 promoter is maintained in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from two UFM individuals. However, a subset of iPSC clones with large CGG expansions carries silenced FMR1. Furthermore, we demonstrate de novo silencing upon expansion of the CGG repeat size. FMR1 does not undergo silencing during neuronal differentiation of UFM iPSCs, and expression of large unmethylated CGG repeats has phenotypic consequences resulting in neurodegenerative features. Our data suggest that UFM individuals do not lack the cell-intrinsic ability to silence FMR1 and that inter-individual variability in the CGG repeat size required for silencing exists in the FXS population.

Abstract: Earlier studies from our laboratory have identified Anacardic acid (AA) as a potent inhibitor of gelatinases (MMP-2 and 9), which are over-expressed in a wide variety of cancers (Omanakuttan et al., 2012). Disruption of the finely tuned matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activator/inhibitor balance plays a decisive role in determining the fate of the cell. The present study demonstrates for the first time, that in addition to regulating the expression as well as activity of gelatinases, AA also inhibits the expression of its endogenous activators like MMP-14 and Extracellular Matrix MetalloProteinase Inducer (EMMPRIN) and induces the expression of its endogenous inhibitor, REversion-inducing Cysteine-rich protein with Kazal motifs (RECK). In addition to modulating gelatinases, AA also inhibits the expression of various components of the Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) pathway like EGF, Protein Kinase B (Akt) and Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). Furthermore, AA also activates the expression of Sprouty 2 (Spry2), a negative regulator of EGF pathway, and silencing Spry2 results in up-regulation of expression of gelatinases as well as MMP-14. The present study thus elucidates a novel mechanism of action of AA and provides a strong basis for utilizing this molecule as a template for cancer therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular senescence permanently arrests cell proliferation, often accompanied by a multi-faceted senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Loss of mitochondrial function can drive age-related declines in the function of many post-mitotic tissues, but little is known about how mitochondrial dysfunction affects mitotic tissues. We show here that several manipulations that compromise mitochondrial function in proliferating human cells induce a senescence growth arrest with a modified SASP that lacks the IL-1-dependent inflammatory arm. Cells that underwent mitochondrial dysfunction-associated senescence (MiDAS) had lower NAD+/NADH ratios, which caused both the growth arrest and prevented the IL-1-associated SASP through AMPK-mediated p53 activation. Progeroid mice that rapidly accrue mtDNA mutations accumulated senescent cells with a MiDAS SASP in vivo, which suppressed adipogenesis and stimulated keratinocyte differentiation in cell culture. Our data identify a distinct senescence response and provide a mechanism by which mitochondrial dysfunction can drive aging phenotypes.

Abstract: Summary
The RNA modification N6-methyladenosine (m6A) post-transcriptionally regulates RNA function. The cellular machinery that controls m6A includes methyltransferases and demethylases that add or remove this modification, as well as m6A-binding YTHDF proteins that promote the translation or degradation of m6A-modified mRNA. We demonstrate that m6A modulates infection by hepatitis C virus (HCV). Depletion of m6A methyltransferases or an m6A demethylase, respectively, increases or decreases infectious HCV particle production. During HCV infection, YTHDF proteins relocalize to lipid droplets, sites of viral assembly, and their depletion increases infectious viral particles. We further mapped m6A sites across the HCV genome and determined that inactivating m6A in one viral genomic region increases viral titer without affecting RNA replication. Additional mapping of m6A on the RNA genomes of other Flaviviridae, including dengue, Zika, yellow fever, and West Nile virus, identifies conserved regions modified by m6A. Altogether, this work identifies m6A as a conserved regulatory mark across Flaviviridae genomes.

Abstract: Hypoxia is a hallmark of solid tumor growth microenvironment and appropriates the major contributor for the failure and poor prognosis of clinical tumor treatment, including prostate cancer (PCa). Ectopic expression of netrin-1 is reportedly associated with the progression of several carcinomas. Here, we aimed to investigate the role of netrin-1 in hypoxic metastasis potential of prostate carcinoma. Here, hypoxia induced the up-regulation of netrin-1 mRNA and protein expression in prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and DU145. Importantly, knockdown of netrin-1 dramatically suppressed cell invasion, migration and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of PC3 and DU145 cells under hypoxia. Furthermore, hypoxia treatment increased the activity of Yes-associated protein (YAP) by increasing YAP expression in the nucleus and inhibiting p-YAP levels. However, YAP activation was notably restrained following netrin-1 down-regulation. Interestingly, interrupting YAP expression attenuated hypoxia-triggered cell invasion, migration and EMT of DU145 cells. More importantly, restoring YAP expression strikingly antagonized the inhibitory effects of netrin-1 decrease on the metastatic potential of prostate cancer cells. Together, these results indicate that netrin-1 may function as a positive regulator of hypoxia-triggered malignant behavior in PCa by activating the YAP signaling. Accordingly, netrin-1 could be a promising therapeutic agent against prostate carcinoma.

Abstract: Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by reversible airway obstruction with persistent airway inflammation and airway remodelling, which is associated with increased airway smooth muscle (ASM) mass. Roxithromycin (RXM) has been widely used in asthma treatment; however, its mechanism of action is poorly understood. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been implicated in inflammatory and airway blood vessel remodelling in patients with asthma, and shown to promote ASM cell proliferation. Here, we investigated the effect of RXM on VEGF-induced ASM cell proliferation and attempted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of action. We tested the effect of RXM on proliferation and cell cycle progression, as well as on the expression of phospho-VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2), phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), phospho-Akt, and caveolin-1 in VEGF-stimulated ASM cells. RXM inhibited VEGF-induced ASM cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest. Additionally, VEGF-induced ASM cell proliferation was suppressed by inhibiting the activity of ERK1/2, but not that of Akt. Furthermore, RXM treatment inhibits VEGF-induced activation of VEGFR2 and ERK and downregulation of caveolin-1 in a dose-dependent manner. RXM also inhibited TGF-β-induced VEGF secretion by ASM cells and BEAS-2B cells. Collectively, our findings suggest that RXM inhibits VEGF-induced ASM cell proliferation by suppression of VEGFR2 and ERK1/2 activation and caveolin-1 down-regulation, which may be involved in airway remodelling. Further elucidation of the mechanisms underlying these observations should enable the development of treatments for smooth muscle hyperplasia-associated diseases of the airway such as asthma.

Abstract: Summary
The therapeutic effects of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation following spinal cord injury (SCI) to date have been limited. Therefore, we aimed to enhance the immunomodulatory properties of MSCs via continuous secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-13 (IL-13). By using MSCs as carriers of IL-13 (MSC/IL-13), we investigated their therapeutic potential, compared with non-engineered MSCs, in a mouse model of SCI. We show that transplanted MSC/IL-13 significantly improve functional recovery following SCI, and also decrease lesion size and demyelinated area by more than 40%. Further histological analyses in CX3CR1EGFP/+ CCR2RFP/+ transgenic mice indicated that MSC/IL-13 significantly decrease the number of resident microglia and increase the number of alternatively activated macrophages. In addition, the number of macrophage-axon contacts in MSC/IL-13-treated mice was decreased by 50%, suggesting a reduction in axonal dieback. Our data provide evidence that transplantation of MSC/IL-13 leads to improved functional and histopathological recovery in a mouse model of SCI.

Abstract: Summary
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) offer a renewable source of cells that can be expanded indefinitely and differentiated into virtually any type of cell in the human body, including neurons. This opens up unprecedented possibilities to study neuronal cell and developmental biology and cellular pathology of the nervous system, provides a platform for the screening of chemical libraries that affect these processes, and offers a potential source of transplantable cells for regenerative approaches to neurological disease. However, defining protocols that permit a large number and high yield of neurons has proved difficult. We present differentiation protocols for the generation of distinct subtypes of neurons in a highly reproducible manner, with minimal experiment-to-experiment variation. These neurons form synapses with neighboring cells, exhibit spontaneous electrical activity, and respond appropriately to depolarization. hPSC-derived neurons exhibit a high degree of maturation and survive in culture for up to 4–5 months, even without astrocyte feeder layers.

Abstract: Background and objective
In recent years, immunotherapy for the treatment of tumors have been established. Dendritic cells (DCs) are extremely efficient and professional antigen presenting cells (APCs), which are an important target for immune therapeutic interventions in cancer. In present study, we investigated whether RBP-J signaling regulated by miR-133a was involved in the DCs mediated tumor suppressor in osteosarcoma.
Methods
DCs were isolated from 30 osteosarcoma patients and 30 healthy subjects. Mouse macrophage-like cell line RAW264.7 were cultured and osteosarcoma mouse model with injection of murine osteosarcoma cell line S180 were established.
Results
In osteosarcoma patients, miR-133a expression level of DCs was increased, and RBP-J expression in mRNA and protein levels were decreased. MiR-133a inhibitor promoted maturation and activation of DCs in osteosarcoma patients. In osteosarcoma mouse model, miR-133a mimic suppressed the maturation and activation of spleen DCs, while miR-133a inhibitor promoted them. Overexpression of miR-133a decreased therapeutic effect of DCs on osteosarcoma mice. In RAW264.7 cells, miR-133a was observed to target RBP-J and regulate its expression. MiR-133a mimic inhibited the maturation of DCs in cells exposed to LPS, the effect of which was reversed by overexpression of RBP-J.
Conclusion
RBP-J mediated by miR-133a probably contributed to the regulation of DCs maturation and activation in osteosarcoma, which functioned as a therapeutic target for the immunotherapy in cancers.

Abstract: Cerebrovascular aging has a high relationship with stroke and neurodegenerative disease. In the present study, we evaluated the influence of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) on angiotensin (Ang II)-mediated cerebrovascular aging in human brain vascular smooth muscle cells (hBVSMCs). Ang II induced remarkable aging-phenotypes in hBVSMCs, including enhanced SA-β-gal staining and NBS1 protein expression. First, we used immunoblotting assay to confirm protein expression of FGF21 receptor (FGFR1) and the co-receptor β-Klotho in cultured hBVSMCs. Second, we found that FGF21 treatment partly prevented the aging-related changes induced by Ang II. FGF21 inhibited Ang II-enhanced ROS production/superoxide anion levels, rescued the Ang II-reduced Complex IV and citrate synthase activities, and suppressed the Ang II-induced meprin protein expression. Third, we showed that FGF21 not only inhibited the Ang II-induced p53 activation, but also blocked the action of Ang II on Siah-1-TRF signaling pathway which is upstream factors for p53 activation. At last, either chemical inhibition of AMPK signaling pathway by a specific antagonist Compound C or knockdown of AMPKα1/2 isoform using siRNA, successfully abolished the anti-aging action of FGF21 in hBVSMCs. These results indicate that FGF21 protects against Ang II-induced cerebrovascular aging via improving mitochondrial biogenesis and inhibiting p53 activation in an AMPK-dependent manner, and highlight the therapeutic value of FGF21 in cerebrovascular aging-related diseases such as stroke and neurodegenerative disease.

Abstract: Direct reprogramming is a promising approach for the replacement of β cells in diabetes. Reprogramming of cells originating from the endodermal lineage, such as acinar cells in the pancreas, liver cells and gallbladder cells has been of particular interest because of their developmental proximity to β cells. Our previous work showed that mouse gallbladder epithelium can be partially reprogrammed in vitro to generate islet-like cells (rGBC1). Here, the reprogramming protocol was substantially improved, yielding cells (rGBC2) closer to functional β cells than the 1st generation method with higher conversion efficiency and insulin expression. In addition to insulin synthesis and processing, rGBC2 presented many hallmark features of β cells, including insulin secretion in response to high glucose stimulation. Gene expression analysis indicated that rGBC2 clustered closer with β cells and had a metabolic gene expression profile resembling neonatal β cells. When transplanted into immune-deficient animals, rGBC2 were stable for at least 5months and further matured in vivo. Taken together, this approach provides further understanding of endodermal lineage conversion and potential for development of cell replacement therapy for type 1 diabetes patients.

Abstract: Ginkgolide and bilobalide are major trilactone constituent of Ginkgo biloba leaves and have been shown to exert powerful neuroprotective properties. The aims of this study were to observe the inhibitory effects of ginkgolide and bilobalide on the activation of microglial cells induced by oxygen–glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) and the specific mechanisms by which these effects are mediated. For detecting whether ginkgolide and bilobalide increased cell viability in a dose-dependent manner, BV2 cells were subjected to oxygen–glucose deprivation for 4 h followed by 3 h reoxygenation with various concentrations of drugs (6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 μg/ml). The extent of apoptosis effect of OGD/R with or without ginkgolide and bilobalide treatment were also measured by Annexin V-FITC/PI staining. Similarly, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 were detected using a specific Bio-Plex Pro™ Reagent Kit. The effects of ginkgolide and bilobalide on protein levels of TLR2/4, MyD88, p-TAK1, p-IKKβ, p-IkBα, NF-κB p65, Bcl-2, Bax, Bak, RIP3, cleaved-Caspase-3, cleaved PARP-1 and cellular localization of NF-κB p65 were evaluated by Western blot and double-labeled immunofluorescence staining, respectively. OGD/R significantly decreased the cell viability and increased the release of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α in BV2 microglia cells; these effects were suppressed by ginkgolide and bilobalide. Meanwhile, ginkgolide and bilobalide also attenuated the OGD/R-induced increases in TLR2, TLR4, MyD88, Bak, RIP3 levels and reversed cleaved caspase-3/caspase-3, Bax/Bcl-2 and cleaved PARP-1/PARP-1 ratio. Furthermore, ginkgolide and bilobalide also downregulated p-TAK1, p-IkBα, and p-IKKβ and inhibited the OGD/R-induced transfer of NF-κB p65 from cytoplasm to nucleus in BV2 microglia cells. The results showed that ginkgolide and bilobalide can inhibit OGD/R-induced production of inflammatory factors in BV2 microglia cells by regulating the TLRs/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathways and attenuating inflammatory response. The possible mechanism of anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects of ginkgolides results from the synergistic reaction among each monomer constituents.

Abstract: MicroRNA-29a (miR-29a) has been extensively studied in tumor biology and fibrotic diseases, but little is known about its functional roles in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) differentiation from embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Using well-established VSMC differentiation models, we have observed that miR-29a induces VSMC differentiation from mouse ESCs by negatively regulating YY1, a transcription factor that inhibits muscle cell differentiation and muscle-specific gene expression. Moreover, gene expression levels of three VSMC specific transcriptional factors were up-regulated by miR-29a over-expression, but down-regulated by miR-29a inhibition or YY1 over-expression. Taken together, our data demonstrate that miR-29a and its target gene, YY1, play a regulatory role in VSMC differentiation from ESCs in vitro and in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Cachexia is a wasting syndrome associated with elevated basal energy expenditure and loss of adipose and muscle tissues. It accompanies many chronic diseases including renal failure and cancer and is an important risk factor for mortality. Our recent work demonstrated that tumor-derived PTHrP drives adipose tissue browning and cachexia. Here, we show that PTH is involved in stimulating a thermogenic gene program in 5/6 nephrectomized mice that suffer from cachexia. Fat-specific knockout of PTHR blocked adipose browning and wasting. Surprisingly, loss of PTHR in fat tissue also preserved muscle mass and improved muscle strength. Similarly, PTHR knockout mice were resistant to cachexia driven by tumors. Our results demonstrate that PTHrP and PTH mediate wasting through a common mechanism involving PTHR, and there exists an unexpected crosstalk mechanism between wasting of fat tissue and skeletal muscle. Targeting the PTH/PTHrP pathway may have therapeutic uses in humans with cachexia.

Abstract: Increased intracellular heat shock protein-72 (Hsp72) and heat shock protein-90α (Hsp90α) have been implicated as important components of acquired thermotolerance, providing cytoprotection during stress. This experiment determined the physiological responses characterising increases in Hsp72 and Hsp90α mRNA on the first and tenth day of 90-min heat acclimation (in 40.2 °C, 41.0 % relative humidity (RH)) or equivalent normothermic training (in 20 °C, 29 % RH). Pearson’s product-moment correlation and stepwise multiple regression were performed to determine relationships between physiological [e.g. (Trec, sweat rate (SR) and heart rate (HR)] and training variables (exercise duration, exercise intensity, work done), and the leukocyte Hsp72 and Hsp90α mRNA responses via reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-QPCR) (n = 15). Significant (p < 0.05) correlations existed between increased Hsp72 and Hsp90α mRNA (r = 0.879). Increased core temperature was the most important criteria for gene transcription with ΔTrec (r = 0.714), SR (r = 0.709), Trecfinal45 (r = 0.682), area under the curve where Trec ≥ 38.5°C (AUC38.5 °C; r = 0.678), peak Trec (r = 0.661), duration Trec ≥ 38.5°C (r = 0.650) and ΔHR (r = 0.511) each demonstrating a significant (p < 0.05) correlation with the increase in Hsp72 mRNA. The Trec AUC38.5°C (r = 0.729), ΔTrec (r = 0.691), peak Trec (r = 0.680), Trecfinal45 (r = 0.678), SR (r = 0.660), duration Trec ≥ 38.5°C (r = 0.629), the rate of change in Trec (r = 0.600) and ΔHR (r = 0.531) were the strongest correlate with the increase in Hsp90α mRNA. Multiple regression improved the model for Hsp90α mRNA only, when Trec AUC38.5°C and SR were combined. Training variables showed insignificant (p > 0.05) weak (r < 0.300) relationships with Hsp72 and Hsp90α mRNA. Hsp72 and Hsp90α mRNA correlates were comparable on the first and tenth day. When transcription of the related Hsp72 and Hsp90α mRNA is important, protocols should rapidly induce large, prolonged changes in core temperature.

Abstract: Summary
The identification of immunogenic glycotopes that render glycoconjugate vaccines protective is key to improving vaccine efficacy. Synthetic oligosaccharides are an attractive alternative to the heterogeneous preparations of purified polysaccharides that most marketed glycoconjugate vaccines are based on. To investigate the potency of semi-synthetic glycoconjugates, we chose the least-efficient serotype in the current pneumococcal conjugate vaccine Prevnar 13, Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 3 (ST3). Glycan arrays containing synthetic ST3 repeating unit oligosaccharides were used to screen a human reference serum for antibodies and to define the recognition site of two ST3-specific protective monoclonal antibodies. The glycan array screens identified a tetrasaccharide that was selected for in-depth immunological evaluation. The tetrasaccharide-CRM197 carrier protein conjugate elicited protective immunity as evidenced by opsonophagocytosis assays and protection against pneumonia caused by ST3 in mice. Formulation of the defined protective lead candidate glycotope has to be further evaluated to elicit optimal long-term immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) is a highly conserved pathway that selectively degrades specific subsets of RNA transcripts. Here, we provide evidence that NMD regulates early human developmental cell fate. We found that NMD factors tend to be expressed at higher levels in human pluripotent cells than in differentiated cells, raising the possibility that NMD must be downregulated to permit differentiation. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) demonstrated that, indeed, NMD downregulation is essential for efficient generation of definitive endoderm. RNA-seq analysis identified NMD target transcripts induced when NMD is suppressed in hESCs, including many encoding signaling components. This led us to test the role of TGF-β and BMP signaling, which we found NMD acts through to influence definitive endoderm versus mesoderm fate. Our results suggest that selective RNA decay is critical for specifying the developmental fate of specific human embryonic cell lineages.

Abstract: Pressure overload induces cardiac remodeling involving both the contractile machinery and intercalated disks (IDs). Filamin C (FlnC) and Xin actin-binding repeat-containing proteins (XIRPs) are multi-adapters localizing in IDs of higher vertebrates. Knockout of the gene encoding Xin (Xirp1) in mice leads to a mild cardiac phenotype with ID mislocalization. In order to amplify this phenotype, we performed transverse aortic constriction (TAC) on control and Xirp1-deficient mice. TAC induced similar left ventricular hypertrophy in both genotypes, suggesting that the lack of Xin does not lead to higher susceptibility to cardiac overload. However, in both genotypes, FlnC appeared in “streaming” localizations across multiple sarcomeres proximal to the IDs, suggesting a remodeling response. Furthermore, FlnC-positive areas of remodeling, reminiscent of sarcomeric lesions previously described for skeletal muscles (but so far unreported in the heart), were also observed. These adaptations reflect a similarly strong effect of the pressure induced by TAC in both genotypes. However, 2 weeks post-operation TAC-treated knockout hearts had reduced levels of connexin43 and slightly increased incidents of ventricular tachycardia compared to their wild-type (WT) counterparts. Our findings highlight the FlnC-positive sarcomeric lesions and ID-proximal streaming as general remodeling responses in cardiac overload-induced hypertrophy.

Abstract: Growing evidence indicates that in diabetes, high glucose concentrations affect podocyte metabolism and function. The crucial pathological feature of type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome is insulin resistance, often developed as a result of dysregulation of nutrient-responsible systems and disturbance of cellular homeostasis under diabetic conditions. Here, we report the involvement of the reciprocal interplay between deacetylase SIRT1 and protein kinase AMPK in podocyte high glucose–induced abolition of insulin-dependent glucose uptake, manifesting insulin resistance. Experiments were performed on primary rat podocytes cultured in standard or high glucose conditions. Immunodetection methods were used to determine SIRT1 protein level and AMPK phosphorylation degree. Insulin-stimulated changes in glucose uptake were used to determine podocyte responsiveness to insulin. SIRT1 activity was modulated by resveratrol, EX-527, or small interfering RNA targeting SIRT1. We have demonstrated that the absence of the stimulating effect of insulin on glucose uptake into primary rat podocytes after long-time exposition to high glucose concentrations, is a result of decreased SIRT1 protein levels and activity, associated with decreased AMPK phosphorylation degree, presumably underlying the induction of insulin resistance. Our findings suggest that the interplay between SIRT1 and AMPK is involved in the regulation of insulin action in podocytes.

Abstract: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes acute and chronic hepatitis, and is one of the major causes of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Accumulating evidence suggests that inflammation is the key factor for liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. MicroRNAs play important roles in many biological processes. Here, we aim to explore the function of microRNAs in the HBX-induced inflammation. First, microarray experiment showed that HBV+ liver samples expressed higher level of miR-203a compared to HBV- liver samples. To verify these alterations, HBx-coding plasmid was transfected into HepG2 cells to overexpress HBx protein. The real-time PCR results suggested that over-expression of HBx could induce up-regulation of miR-203a. To define how up-regulation of miR-203a can induce liver cells inflammation, we over-expressed miR-203a in HepG2 cells. Annexin V staining and BrdU staining suggested that overexpression of miR-203a significantly increased the cell apoptosis and proliferation, meanwhile, over-expression of miR-203a could lead to a decrease in G0/G1 phase cells and an increase in G2/M phase cells. Some cytokines production including IL-6 and IL-8 were significantly increased, but TGFβ and IFNγ were decreased in miR-203a over-expressed HepG2 cells. Luciferase reporter assay experiments, protein mass-spectrum assay and real-time PCR all together demonstrated that Rap1a was the target gene of miR-203a. Further experiments showed that these alterations were modulated through PI3K/ERK/p38/NFκB pathways. These data suggested that HBV-infection could up-regulate the expression of miR-203a, thus down regulated the expression of Rap1a and affected the PI3K/ERK/p38/NFκB pathways, finally induced the hepatitis inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Constant surveillance of live poultry markets (LPMs) is currently the best way to predict and identify emerging avian influenza viruses (AIVs) that pose a potential threat to public health. Through surveillance of LPMs from 16 provinces and municipalities in China during 2014–2016, we identified 3,174 AIV-positive samples and isolated and sequenced 1,135 AIVs covering 31 subtypes. Our analysis shows that H5N6 has replaced H5N1 as one of the dominant AIV subtypes in southern China, especially in ducks. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that H5N6 arose from reassortments of H5 and H6N6 viruses, with the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase combinations being strongly lineage specific. H5N6 viruses constitute at least 34 distinct genotypes derived from various evolutionary pathways. Notably, genotype G1.2 virus, with internal genes from the chicken H9N2/H7N9 gene pool, was responsible for at least five human H5N6 infections. Our findings highlight H5N6 AIVs as potential threats to public health and agriculture.

Abstract: Recent studies have indicated a metabolic temperature sensitivity in both the arcto-boreal krill species Thysanoessa inermis and Thysanoessa raschii that may determine these species’ abundance and population persistence at lower latitudes (up to 40° N). T. inermis currently dominates the krill community in the Barents Sea and in the high Arctic Kongsfjord. We aimed to increase the knowledge on the upper thermal limit found in the latter species by estimating the CT50 value (19.7 °C) (critical temperature at which 50 % of animals are reactive) and by linking metabolic rate measurements with molecular approaches. Optical oxygen sensors were used to measure respiration rates in steps of 2°C (from 0 to 16 °C). To follow the temperature-mediated mechanisms of passive response, i.e., as a proxy for molecular stress, molecular chaperone heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) sequences were extracted from a transcriptome assembly, and the gene expression kinetics were monitored during an acute temperature exposure to 6 or 10°C with subsequent recovery at 4 °C. Our results showed upregulation of hsp70 genes, especially the structurally constitutive and mitochondrial isoforms. These findings confirmed the temperature sensitivity of T. inermis and showed that the thermal stress took place before reaching the upper temperature limit estimated by respirometry at 12 °C. This study provides a baseline for further investigations into the thermal tolerances of arcto-boreal Thysanoessa spp. and comparisons with other krill species under different climatic regimes, especially Antarctica.

Abstract: Summary
In an era where natural product biosynthetic gene clusters can be rapidly identified from sequenced genomes, it is unusual for the biosynthesis of an entire natural product class to remain unknown. Yet, the genetic determinates for pyrroloquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis have remained obscure despite their abundance and deceptive structural simplicity. In this work, we have identified the biosynthetic gene cluster for ammosamides A-C, pyrroloquinoline alkaloids from Streptomyces sp. CNR-698. Through direct cloning, heterologous expression and gene deletions we have validated the ammosamide biosynthetic gene cluster and demonstrated that these seemingly simple molecules are derived from a surprisingly complex set of biosynthetic genes that are also found in the biosynthesis of lymphostin, a structurally related pyrroloquinoline alkaloid from Salinispora and Streptomyces. Our results implicate a conserved set of genes driving pyrroloquinoline biosynthesis that consist of genes frequently associated with ribosomal peptide natural product biosynthesis, and whose exact biochemical role remains enigmatic.

Abstract: Summary
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a target of signal-derived H2O2, and oxidation of active-site cysteine 797 to sulfenic acid enhances kinase activity. Although a major class of covalent drugs targets C797, nothing is known about its catalytic importance or how S-sulfenylation leads to activation. Here, we report the first detailed functional analysis of C797. In contrast to prior assumptions, mutation of C797 diminishes catalytic efficiency in vitro and cells. The experimentally determined pKa and reactivity of C797 toward H2O2 correspondingly distinguish this residue from the bulk of the cysteinome. Molecular dynamics simulation of reduced versus oxidized EGFR, reinforced by experimental testing, indicates that sulfenylation of C797 allows new electrostatic interactions to be formed with the catalytic loop. Finally, we show that chronic oxidative stress yields an EGFR subpopulation that is refractory to the FDA-approved drug afatinib. Collectively, our data highlight the significance of redox biology to understanding kinase regulation and drug pharmacology.

Abstract: A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 33 (ADAM33) has been identified as a susceptibility gene for asthma, but details of the causality are not fully understood. We hypothesize that soluble ADAM33 (sADAM33) overexpression can alter the mechanical behaviors of airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) via regulation of the cell's contractile phenotype, and thus contributes to airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in asthma. To test this hypothesis, we either overexpressed or knocked down the sADAM33 in rat ASMCs by transfecting the cells with sADAM33 coding sequence or a small interfering RNA (siRNA) that specifically targets the ADAM33 disintegrin domain, and subsequently assessed the cells for stiffness, contractility and traction force, together with the expression level of contractile and proliferative phenotype markers. We also investigated whether these changes were dependent on Rho/ROCK pathway by culturing the ASMCs either in the absence or presence of ROCK inhibitor (H1152). The results showed that the ASMCs with sADAM33 overexpression were stiffer and more contractile, generated greater traction force, exhibited increased expression levels of contractile phenotype markers and markedly enhanced Rho activation. Furthermore these changes were largely attenuated when the cells were cultured in the presence of H-1152. However, the knock-down of ADAM33 seemed insufficient to influence majority of the mechanical behaviors of the ASMCs. Taken together, we demonstrated that sADAM33 overexpression altered the mechanical behaviors of ASMCs in vitro, which was most likely by promoting a hypercontractile phenotype transition of ASMCs through Rho/ROCK pathway. This revelation may establish the previously missing link between ADAM33 expression and AHR, and also provide useful insight for targeting sADAM33 in asthma prevention and therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate β cell mass and proliferation is important for the treatment of diabetes. Here, we identified domperidone (DPD), a dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) antagonist that enhances β cell mass. Over time, islet β cell loss occurs in dissociation cultures, and this was inhibited by DPD. DPD increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis of β cells through increasing intracellular cAMP. DPD prevented β cell dedifferentiation, which together highly contributed to the increased β cell mass. DRD2 knockdown phenocopied the effects of domperidone and increased the number of β cells. Drd2 overexpression sensitized the dopamine responsiveness of β cells and increased apoptosis. Further analysis revealed that the adenosine agonist 5′-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine, a previously identified promoter of β cell proliferation, acted with DPD to increase the number of β cells. In humans, dopamine also modulates β cell mass through DRD2 and exerts an inhibitory effect on adenosine signaling.

Abstract: Pericytes (PCs) are a subset of perivascular cells that can give rise to mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) when culture-expanded, and are postulated to give rise to MSC-like cells during tissue repair in vivo. PCs have been suggested to behave as stem cells (SCs) in situ in animal models, although evidence for this role in humans is lacking. Here, we analyzed the transcriptomes of highly purified, non-cultured adipose tissue (AT)-derived PCs (ATPCs) to detect gene expression changes that occur as they acquire MSC characteristics in vitro, and evaluated the hypothesis that human ATPCs exhibit a gene expression profile compatible with an AT SC phenotype. The results showed ATPCs are non-proliferative and express genes characteristic not only of PCs, but also of AT stem/progenitor cells. Additional analyses defined a gene expression signature for ATPCs, and revealed putative novel ATPC markers. Almost all AT stem/progenitor cell genes differentially expressed by ATPCs were not expressed by ATMSCs or culture-expanded ATPCs. Genes expressed by ATMSCs but not by ATPCs were also identified. These findings strengthen the hypothesis that PCs are SCs in vascularized tissues, highlight gene expression changes they undergo as they assume an MSC phenotype, and provide new insights into PC biology.

Abstract: Summary
Primordial germ cells (PGCs) are specified from epiblast cells in mice. Genes associated with naive pluripotency are repressed in the transition from inner cell mass to epiblast cells, followed by upregulation after PGC specification. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the reactivation of pluripotency genes are poorly characterized. Here, we exploited the in vitro differentiation of epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs) from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to elucidate the molecular and epigenetic functions of PR domain-containing 14 (PRDM14). We found that Prdm14 overexpression in EpiLCs induced their conversion to ESC-like cells even in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor in adherent culture. This was impaired by the loss of Kruppel-like factor 2 and ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins. Furthermore, PRDM14 recruited OCT3/4 to the enhancer regions of naive pluripotency genes via TET-base excision repair-mediated demethylation. Our results provide evidence that PRDM14 establishes a transcriptional network for naive pluripotency via active DNA demethylation.

Abstract: Butylbenzyl phthalate (BBP), a suspected endocrine disruptor, adversely affects male reproductive function. In this study, morphological alterations of prepubertal rat testes caused by single administration of BBP, were examined by light microscopy. Three-week-old male rats were given a single dose of 500mg/kg BBP by oral gavage and sacrificed at 3, 12, and 24h after administration. Histopathological examination revealed progressive detachment and sloughing of spermatogenic cells into the lumen, and a significant increase in the number of TUNEL-positive (apoptotic) spermatogenic cells in the treated groups, compared to the control. Semithin sections confirmed the apoptotic cells by their prominent basophilia, condensed chromatin, and shrunken cytoplasm, hallmarks of apoptotic cell death. Immunohistochemistry identified disruption of Sertoli cell vimentin and actin filaments in the treated groups. To elucidate the recovery effects of BBP, rats were treated in the same way and were sacrificed at D1–12h after administration. The apoptotic index returned to normal at D9. While, the testes revealed lower weight gain until D12. These results show for the first time that BBP induces collapse of vimentin filaments in Sertoli cells which may lead to disruption of Sertoli-spermatogenic cell physical interaction and induces spermatogenic cell apoptosis.

Abstract: Summary
The Drosophila testis has been fundamental to understanding how stem cells interact with their endogenous microenvironment, or niche, to control organ growth in vivo. Here, we report the identification of two independent alleles for the highly conserved tumor suppressor gene, Retinoblastoma-family protein (Rbf), in a screen for testis phenotypes in X chromosome third-instar lethal alleles. Rbf mutant alleles exhibit overproliferation of spermatogonial cells, which is phenocopied by the molecularly characterized Rbf11 null allele. We demonstrate that Rbf promotes cell-cycle exit and differentiation of the somatic and germline stem cells of the testes. Intriguingly, depletion of Rbf specifically in the germline does not disrupt stem cell differentiation, rather Rbf loss of function in the somatic lineage drives overproliferation and differentiation defects in both lineages. Together our observations suggest that Rbf in the somatic lineage controls germline stem cell renewal and differentiation non-autonomously via essential roles in the microenvironment of the germline lineage.

Abstract: Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1(TREM-1) is a newly identified member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is extensively involved in the regulation of innate immunity. To determine the role of TREM-1 in innate antiviral immunity, we investigated TREM-1 expression and its downstream signaling effect in the murine bone marrow-derived macrophages or RAW264.7 macrophage-like mouse cell line by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) stimulation. The level of TREM-1 expression was low at the baseline and could up-regulate markedly in dose- and time-dependent manners upon stimulation by dsRNA/poly IC. Inhibitor studies disclosed mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 and PI3K pathways were involved in dsRNA-induced up-regulation of TREM-1. Compared with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the peak response of poly IC-induced TREM-1 expression is delayed, and cells pretreated with scrambled RNA presented higher expression of TREM-1 upon LPS challenge. After ligation with the agonist antibody, TREM-1 can potentiate type I interferon (IFN) production and antiviral inflammation induced by dsRNA, which is ralated to the enhanced phosphorylation of MAPKs and expression of RLRs and TLRs by TREM-1 ligation. This study is the first to show the regulatory role of TREM-1 in RLRs and TLRs expression, and these findings might enrich the understanding of the up-regulation mechanism and the function of TREM-1.

Abstract: Summary
Programmed cell death (PCD) and immunity in plants are tightly controlled to promote antimicrobial defense while preventing autoimmunity. However, the mechanisms contributing to this immune homeostasis are poorly understood. Here, we isolated a rice mutant ebr1 (enhanced blight and blast resistance 1) that shows enhanced broad-spectrum bacterial and fungal disease resistance, but displays spontaneous PCD, autoimmunity, and stunted growth. EBR1 encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase that interacts with OsBAG4, which belongs to the BAG (Bcl-2-associated athanogene) family that functions in cell death, growth arrest, and immune responses in mammals. EBR1 directly targets OsBAG4 for ubiquitination-mediated degradation. Elevated levels of OsBAG4 in rice are necessary and sufficient to trigger PCD and enhanced disease resistance to pathogenic infection, most likely by activating pathogen-associated molecular patterns-triggered immunity (PTI). Together, our study suggests that an E3-BAG module orchestrates innate immune homeostasis and coordinates the trade-off between defense and growth in plants.

Abstract: Summary
The rising problem of antimicrobial resistance in Staphylococcus aureus necessitates the discovery of novel therapeutic targets for small-molecule intervention. A major obstacle of drug discovery is identifying the target of molecules selected from high-throughput phenotypic assays. Here, we show that the toxicity of a small molecule termed ’882 is dependent on the constitutive activity of the S. aureus virulence regulator SaeRS, uncovering a link between virulence factor production and energy generation. A series of genetic, physiological, and biochemical analyses reveal that ’882 inhibits iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster assembly most likely through inhibition of the Suf complex, which synthesizes Fe-S clusters. In support of this, ’882 supplementation results in decreased activity of the Fe-S cluster-dependent enzyme aconitase. Further information regarding the effects of ’882 has deepened our understanding of virulence regulation and demonstrates the potential for small-molecule modulation of Fe-S cluster assembly in S. aureus and other pathogens.

Abstract: Summary
Antibody production is a metabolically demanding process that is regulated by gut microbiota, but the microbial products supporting B cell responses remain incompletely identified. We report that short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), produced by gut microbiota as fermentation products of dietary fiber, support host antibody responses. In B cells, SCFAs increase acetyl-CoA and regulate metabolic sensors to increase oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis, and fatty acid synthesis, which produce energy and building blocks supporting antibody production. In parallel, SCFAs control gene expression to express molecules necessary for plasma B cell differentiation. Mice with low SCFA production due to reduced dietary fiber consumption or microbial insufficiency are defective in homeostatic and pathogen-specific antibody responses, resulting in greater pathogen susceptibility. However, SCFA or dietary fiber intake restores this immune deficiency. This B cell-helping function of SCFAs is detected from the intestines to systemic tissues and conserved among mouse and human B cells, highlighting its importance.

Abstract: Summary
Influenza A virus (IAV) is a lytic virus in primary cultures of many cell types and in vivo. We report that the kinase RIPK3 is essential for IAV-induced lysis of mammalian fibroblasts and lung epithelial cells. Replicating IAV drives assembly of a RIPK3-containing complex that includes the kinase RIPK1, the pseudokinase MLKL, and the adaptor protein FADD, and forms independently of signaling by RNA-sensing innate immune receptors (RLRs, TLRs, PKR), or the cytokines type I interferons and TNF-α. Downstream of RIPK3, IAV activates parallel pathways of MLKL-driven necroptosis and FADD-mediated apoptosis, with the former reliant on RIPK3 kinase activity and neither on RIPK1 activity. Mice deficient in RIPK3 or doubly deficient in MLKL and FADD, but not MLKL alone, are more susceptible to IAV than their wild-type counterparts, revealing an important role for RIPK3-mediated apoptosis in antiviral immunity. Collectively, these results outline RIPK3-activated cytolytic mechanisms essential for controlling respiratory IAV infection.

Abstract: Summary
Besides digesting nutrients, the gut protects the host against invasion by pathogens. Enterocytes may be subjected to damage by both microbial and host defensive responses, causing their death. Here, we report a rapid epithelial response that alleviates infection stress and protects the enterocytes from the action of microbial virulence factors. Intestinal epithelia exposed to hemolysin, a pore-forming toxin secreted by Serratia marcescens, undergo an evolutionarily conserved process of thinning followed by the recovery of their initial thickness within a few hours. In response to hemolysin attack, Drosophila melanogaster enterocytes extrude most of their apical cytoplasm, including damaged organelles such as mitochondria, yet do not lyse. We identify two secreted peptides, the expression of which requires CyclinJ, that mediate the recovery phase in which enterocytes regain their original shape and volume. Epithelial thinning and recovery constitute a fast and efficient response to intestinal infections, with pore-forming toxins acting as alarm signals.

Abstract: Summary
Anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins block cell death by trapping the critical α-helical BH3 domains of pro-apoptotic members in a surface groove. Cancer cells hijack this survival mechanism by overexpressing a spectrum of anti-apoptotic members, mounting formidable apoptotic blockades that resist chemotherapeutic treatment. Drugging the BH3-binding pockets of anti-apoptotic proteins has become a highest-priority goal, fueled by the clinical success of ABT-199, a selective BCL-2 inhibitor, in reactivating apoptosis in BCL-2-dependent cancers. BFL-1 is a BCL-2 homolog implicated in melanoma, lymphoma, and other cancers, and remains undrugged. A natural juxtaposition of two unique cysteines at the binding interface of the NOXA BH3 helix and BFL-1 pocket informed the development of stapled BH3 peptides bearing acrylamide warheads to irreversibly inhibit BFL-1 by covalent targeting. Given the frequent proximity of native cysteines to regulatory binding surfaces, covalent stapled peptide inhibitors provide a new therapeutic strategy for targeting pathologic protein interactions.

Abstract: Summary
Tetherin encodes an interferon-inducible antiviral protein that traps a broad spectrum of enveloped viruses at infected cell surfaces. Despite the absence of any clearly related gene or activity, we describe possible scenarios by which tetherin arose that exemplify how protein modularity, evolvability, and robustness can create and preserve new functions. We find that tetherin genes in various organisms exhibit no sequence similarity and share only a common architecture and location in modern genomes. Moreover, tetherin is part of a cluster of three potential sister genes encoding proteins of similar architecture, some variants of which exhibit antiviral activity while others can be endowed with antiviral activity by a simple modification. Only in slowly evolving species (e.g., coelacanths) does tetherin exhibit sequence similarity to one potential sister gene. Neofunctionalization, drift, and genetic conflict appear to have driven a near complete loss of sequence similarity among modern tetherin genes and their sister genes.

Abstract: Summary
Gene activation in metazoans is accompanied by the presence of histone variants H2AZ and H3.3 within promoters and enhancers. It is not known, however, what protein deposits H3.3 into chromatin or whether variant chromatin plays a direct role in gene activation. Here we show that chromatin containing acetylated H2AZ and H3.3 stimulates transcription in vitro. Analysis of the Pol II pre-initiation complex on immobilized chromatin templates revealed that the E1A binding protein p400 (EP400) was bound preferentially to and required for transcription stimulation by acetylated double-variant chromatin. EP400 also stimulated H2AZ/H3.3 deposition into promoters and enhancers and influenced transcription in vivo at a step downstream of the Mediator complex. EP400 efficiently exchanged recombinant histones H2A and H3.1 with H2AZ and H3.3, respectively, in a chromatin- and ATP-stimulated manner in vitro. Our data reveal that EP400 deposits H3.3 into chromatin alongside H2AZ and contributes to gene regulation after PIC assembly.

Abstract: Naringenin is one of the most popular flavonoids derived from citrus. It has been reported to be an effective anti-inflammatory compound. Citrus fruit may be used raw, cooked, stewed, or boiled. The present study was conducted to investigate the effect of thermal processes on naringenin in its immunomodulatory and cellular antioxidant activities. The effects of flavonoids on B and T cell proliferation were assessed on splenocytes stimulated or not with mitogens. However, their effects on cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and natural killer (NK) activities were assessed in splenocytes co-incubated with target cells. The amount of nitric oxide production and the lysosomal enzyme activity were evaluated in vitro on mouse peritoneal macrophages. Cellular antioxidant activity in splenocytes and macrophages was determined by measuring the fluorescence of the dichlorofluorescin (DCF). Our findings revealed that naringenin induces B cell proliferation and enhances NK activity. The highest concentration of native naringenin exhibits a significant proliferation of T cells, induces CTL activity, and inhibits cellular oxidation in macrophages. Conversely, it was observed that when heat-processed, naringenin improves the cellular antioxidant activity in splenocytes, increases the cytotoxic activity of NK cells, and suppresses the cytotoxicity of T cells. However, heat treatment maintains the anti-inflammatory potency of naringenin.

Abstract: Electrospun microfiber meshes have been shown to support the proliferation and differentiation of many types of stem cells, but the phenotypic fate of c-kit+ human cardiac stem cells (hCSCs) have not been explored. To this end, we utilized thin (~5µm) elastomeric meshes consisting of aligned 1.7µm diameter poly (ester-urethane urea) microfibers as substrates to examine their effect on hCSC viability, morphology, proliferation, and differentiation relative to cells cultured on tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS). The results showed that cells on microfiber meshes displayed an elongated morphology aligned in the direction of fiber orientation, lower proliferation rates, but increased expressions of genes and proteins majorly associated with cardiomyocyte phenotype. The early (NK2 homeobox 5, Nkx2.5) and late (cardiac troponin I, cTnI) cardiomyocyte genes were significantly increased on meshes (Nkx=2.5 56.2±13.0, cTnl=2.9±0.56,) over TCPS (Nkx2.5=4.2±0.9, cTnl=1.6±0.5, n=9, p<0.05 for both groups) after differentiation. In contrast, expressions of smooth muscle markers, Gata6 and myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC), were decreased on meshes. Immunocytochemical analysis with cardiac antibody exhibited the similar pattern of above cardiac differentiation. We conclude that aligned microfiber meshes are suitable for guiding cardiac differentiation of hCSCs and may facilitate stem cell-based therapies for treatment of cardiac diseases.

Abstract: Summary
We studied the function of the G-protein-coupled receptor PAR1 in mediating the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) to endothelial cells (ECs) that are capable of inducing neovascularization. We observed that either deletion or activation of PAR1 suppressed mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) differentiation to ECs and neovascularization in mice. This was mediated by induction of TGFβRII/TGFβRI interaction, forming an active complex, which in turn induced SMAD2 phosphorylation. Inhibition of TGF-β signaling in PAR1-deficient mESCs restored the EC differentiation potential of mESCs. Thus, PAR1 in its inactive unligated state functions as a scaffold for TGFβRII to downregulate TGF-β signaling, and thereby promote ESC transition to functional ECs. The PAR1 scaffold function in ESCs is an essential mechanism for dampening TGF-β signaling and regulating ESC differentiation.

Abstract: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important mechanism in cancer progression and malignancy including colorectal cancer (CRC). Importantly, inflammatory mediators are critical constituents of the local tumor environment and an intimate link between CRC progression and inflammation is now validated. We and others have reported key role of the deregulated claudin-1 expression in colon carcinogenesis including colitis-associated colon cancer (CAC). However, the causal association between claudin-1 expression and inflammation-induced colon cancer progression remains unclear. Here we demonstrate, TNF-α, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, regulates claudin-1 to modulate epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and migration in colon adenocarcinoma cells. Importantly, colon cancer cells cultured in the presence of TNF-α (10ng/ml), demonstrated a sharp decrease in E-cadherin expression and an increase in vimentin expression (versus control cells). Interestingly, TNF-α treatment also upregulated (and delocalized) claudin-1 expression in a time-dependent manner accompanied by increase in proliferation and wound healing. Furthermore, similar to our previous observation that claudin-1 overexpression in CRC cells induces ERK1/2 and Src- activation, signaling associated with colon cancer cell survival and transformation, TNF-α-treatment induced upregulation of phospho-ERK1/2 and -Src expression. The shRNA-mediated inhibition of claudin-1 expression largely abrogated the TNF-α-induced changes in EMT, proliferation, migration, p-Erk and p-Src expression. Taken together, our data demonstrate TNF-α mediated regulation of claudin-1 and tumorigenic abilities of colon cancer cells and highlights a key role of deregulated claudin-1 expression in inflammation-induced colorectal cancer growth and progression, through the regulation of the ERK and Src-signaling.

Abstract: Autophagy is an essential homeostatic process by which cytoplasmic components, including macromolecules and organelles, are degraded by lysosome. Increasing evidence suggests that phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK) and target of rapamycin (TOR) play key roles in the regulation of autophagy. However, the regulation of autophagy in quiescent cells remains unclear, despite the fact that autophagy is known to be critical for normal development, regeneration, and degenerative diseases. Here, crustacean Artemia parthenogenetica was used as a model system because they produced and released encysted embryos that enter a state of obligate dormancy in cell quiescence to withstand various environmental threats. We observed that autophagy was increased before diapause stage but dropped to extremely low level in diapause cysts in Artemia. Western blot analyses indicated that the regulation of autophagy was AMPK/TOR independent during diapause embryo formation. Importantly, the level of p8 (Ar-p8), a stress-inducible transcription cofactor, was elevated at the stage just before diapause and was absent in encysted embryos, indicating that Ar-p8 may regulate autophagy. The results of Ar-p8 knockdown revealed that Ar-p8 regulated autophagy during diapause formation in Artemia. Moreover, we observed that activating transcription factors 4 and 6 (ATF4 and ATF6) responded to Ar-p8-regulated autophagy, indicating that autophagy targeted endoplasmic reticulum (ER) during diapause formation in Artemia. Additionally, AMPK/TOR-independent autophagy was validated in human gastric cancer MKN45 cells overexpressing Ar-p8. The findings presented here may provide insights into the role of p8 in regulating autophagy in quiescent cells.

Abstract: Fusion of cortical granules with the oocyte plasma membrane is the most significant event to prevent polyspermy. This particular exocytosis, also known as cortical reaction, is regulated by calcium and its molecular mechanism is still not known. Rab3A, a member of the small GTP-binding protein superfamily, has been implicated in calcium-dependent exocytosis and is not yet clear whether Rab3A participates in cortical granules exocytosis. Here, we examine the involvement of Rab3A in the physiology of cortical granules, particularly, in their distribution during oocyte maturation and activation, and their participation in membrane fusion during cortical granule exocytosis. Immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis showed that Rab3A and cortical granules have a similar migration pattern during oocyte maturation, and that Rab3A is no longer detected after cortical granule exocytosis. These results suggested that Rab3A might be a marker of cortical granules. Overexpression of EGFP-Rab3A colocalized with cortical granules with a Pearson correlation coefficient of +0.967, indicating that Rab3A and cortical granules have almost a perfect colocalization in the egg cortical region. Using a functional assay, we demonstrated that microinjection of recombinant, prenylated and active GST-Rab3A triggered cortical granule exocytosis, indicating that Rab3A has an active role in this secretory pathway. To confirm this active role, we inhibited the function of endogenous Rab3A by microinjecting a polyclonal antibody raised against Rab3A prior to parthenogenetic activation. Our results showed that Rab3A antibody microinjection abolished cortical granule exocytosis in parthenogenetically activated oocytes. Altogether, our findings confirm that Rab3A might function as a marker of cortical granules and participates in cortical granule exocytosis in mouse eggs.

Abstract: The nuclear receptor related-1 (Nurr1) protein plays an important role in both the development of neural precursor cells (NPCs) and cognitive functions. Despite its relevance, the effects of Nurr1 on adult hippocampal neurogenesis have not been thoroughly investigated. Here we used RT-PCR, western blot, and immunocytochemistry to show that adult hippocampal NPCs abundantly express Nurr1. We then examined the effect of Nurr1 activation on adult hippocampal NPCs using amodiaquine (AQ), an anti-malarial drug that was recently discovered to be a Nurr1 agonist. Cell proliferation assay showed that AQ significantly increased cell proliferation. AQ-treated NPCs showed increased levels of phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2 whereas AQ-treated Nurr1 siRNA-transfected NPCs showed no changes in those levels. Further immunocytochemical and immunohistochemical analyses confirmed the stimulating effect of Nurr1 agonist on the proliferation and differentiation of adult hippocampal NPCs both in vivo and in vitro. In addition to its effects on proliferation and differentiation of NPCs, AQ-treated mice showed a significant enhancement of both short- and long-term memory in the Y-maze and the novel object recognition test. These data suggest that activation of Nurr1 may enhance cognitive functions by increasing adult hippocampal neurogenesis and also indicate that Nurr1 may be used as a therapeutic target for the treatment of memory disorders and cognitive impairment observed in neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: Mouse bone marrow stromal stem/progenitor cells (BMSCs, also known as bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells) and Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cells (HSPCs) with differential proliferative potentials were investigated for identifying epigenetic signals that can modulate their growth. In the present study, immunodepletion of granulo-monocytic (CD11b) and erythroid (Ter119) population yielded CD11b−/Ter119− cells, capable of differentiating into chondrogenic, osteogenic and adipogenic cells. Enrichment of the CD11b+ population by positive selection of multipotent stem/progenitor marker (CD133) yielded CD11b+/CD133+ cells, efficiently differentiated into hematopoietic lineages. Molecular characterization revealed the expression of BMSC and HSPC markers in CD11b−/Ter119− and CD11b+/CD133+ sorted populations, respectively. Cell expansion studies depicted a higher growth rate and percentage of proliferating cells in G2/M phase of cell cycle in BMSCs (13.9±2.9%) as compared with HSPCs (5.8±0.8%). Analysis of the HDACs gene expression revealed a differential expression pattern in BMSCs and HSPCs that modulates the cell cycle genes. Trichostatin A (TSA)-mediated HDAC inhibition led to an increased level of AcH3 and AcH4 along with cyclins B1 and D2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed alleviation of HDAC2 and HDAC3 binding by TSA on cyclins B1 and D2 promoter, thereby enhancing cell proliferation. This study identifies epigenetic modulation on the proliferative potential of BMSCs and HSPCs for stem cell transplantation therapies.

Abstract: Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) undergoes numerous post-translational modifications, which impart new function and influence intracellular location. For example, atypical PKC ι/λ phosphorylates GAPDH that locates to vesicular tubular clusters and is required for retrograde membrane trafficking in the early secretory pathway. GAPDH is also required in the endocytic pathway; substitution of Pro234 to Ser (Pro234Ser) rendered CHO cells defective in endocytosis. To determine if GAPDH (Pro234Ser) could inhibit endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi trafficking, we introduced the recombinant mutant enzyme into several biochemical and morphological transport assays. The mutant protein efficiently blocked vesicular stomatitis virus-G protein transport. Because GAPDH binds to microtubules (MTs), we evaluated MT binding and MT intracellular distribution in the presence of the mutant. Although these properties were not changed relative to wild-type, GAPDH (Pro234Ser) altered Golgi complex morphology. We determined that the GAPDH point mutation disrupted association between the enzyme and the serine/threonine kinase Akt. Interestingly Rab1, which functions in anterograde-directed trafficking, stimulates GAPDH-Akt association with membranes in a quantitative binding assay. In contrast, Rab2 does not stimulate GAPDH-Akt membrane binding but instead recruits GAPDH-aPKC. We propose a mechanism whereby the association of GAPDH with Akt or with aPKC serves as a switch to discriminate between anterograde directed cargo and recycling cargo retrieved back to the ER, respectively.
