Abstract: The ChlR1 DNA helicase is mutated in Warsaw breakage syndrome characterized by developmental anomalies, chromosomal breakage, and sister chromatid cohesion defects. However, the mechanism by which ChlR1 preserves genomic integrity is largely unknown. Here, we describe the roles of ChlR1 in DNA replication recovery. We show that ChlR1 depletion renders human cells highly sensitive to cisplatin; an interstrand-crosslinking agent that causes stalled replication forks. ChlR1 depletion also causes accumulation of DNA damage in response to cisplatin, leading to a significant delay in resolution of DNA damage. We also report that ChlR1-depleted cells display defects in the repair of double-strand breaks induced by the I-PpoI endonuclease and bleomycin. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ChlR1-depeleted cells show significant delays in replication recovery after cisplatin treatment. Taken together, our results indicate that ChlR1 plays an important role in efficient DNA repair during DNA replication, which may facilitate efficient establishment of sister chromatid cohesion.

Abstract: Demineralized bone powder (DBP) has been used by clinicians for years to treat bone defects. Although DBP treatment often leads to successful bone healing, a number of studies using DBP have demonstrated poor bone formation. It is known that soluble factors released from DBP modulate bone formation. We hypothesized that DBP releases or interacts with soluble factors that modulate osteogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Our in vitro study demonstrated that the expression of mRNA transcripts of bone-related markers decreased in osteogenic culture of human MSCs (hMSCs) with DBP compared to that without DBP. Using a high-throughput protein array, we identified insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1, thrombospondin, and angiostatin that were found abundant in the medium cultured with DBP. Separately, we detected a significant reduction of soluble calcium and phosphate in the DBP-present medium compared to that in the DBP-absent medium, and showed that hMSC osteogenesis was regulated by the amounts of soluble calcium and phosphate in the medium. Moreover, DBP was shown to sequester soluble calcium and phosphate in the medium, thereby depleting them from interacting with hMSCs during osteogenesis. This study provides a possible explanation to an important question associated with the use of DBP in clinical treatments.

Abstract: Derivation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells is mainly an epigenetic reprogramming process. It is still quite controversial how genomic imprinting is reprogrammed in iPS cells. Thus, we derived multiple iPS clones from genetically identical mouse somatic cells. We found that parentally inherited imprint was variably lost among these iPS clones. Concurrent with the loss of DNA methylation imprint at the corresponding Snrpn and Peg3 imprinted regions, parental origin-specific expression of the Snrpn and Zim1 imprinted genes was also lost in these iPS clones. This loss of parental genomic imprinting in iPS cells was likely caused by the reprogramming process during iPS cell derivation because extended culture of iPS cells did not lead to significant increase in the loss of genomic imprinting. Intriguingly, one to several paternal chromosomes appeared to have acquired de novo methylation at the Snrpn and Zac1 imprinted regions in a high percentage of iPS clones. These results might have some implications for future therapeutic applications of iPS cells. Since DNA methylation imprint can be completely erased in some iPS clones at multiple imprinted regions, iPS cell reprogramming may also be employed to dissect the underlying mechanisms of erasure, reacquisition and maintenance of genomic imprinting in mammals.

Abstract: Summary
Efforts to prevent human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection would benefit from understanding the factors that govern virus neutralization by antibodies. We present a mechanistic model for HIV-1 neutralization that includes both virus and antibody parameters. Variations in epitope integrity on the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer and Env reactivity to bound antibody influence neutralization susceptibility. In addition, we define an antibody-specific parameter, the perturbation factor (PF), that describes the degree of conformational change in the Env trimer required for a given antibody to bind. Minimally perturbing (low-PF) antibodies can efficiently neutralize viruses with a broad range of Env reactivities due to fast on-rates and high affinity for Env. Highly perturbing (high-PF) antibodies inhibit only viruses with reactive (perturbation-sensitive) Envs, often through irreversible mechanisms. Accounting for these quantifiable viral and antibody-associated parameters helps to predict the observed profiles of HIV-1 neutralization by antibodies with a wide range of potencies.

Abstract: Multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been isolated from several tumors and are implicated to play critical roles to increase malignant cell growth, invasion and metastasis. Here, we show that the MSC-like cells were isolated from human colon cancer tissues. These isolated hCC-MSCs (human colon cancer-derived mesenchymal stem cells) shared similar characteristic features with bone marrow-derived MSCs, which include cell morphology, surface antigens and specific gene expression. Additionally, the hCC-MSCs could differentiate into osteocytes or adipocytes under appropriate culture conditions. The conditioned medium collected from the cultured hCC-MSCs was shown to enhance the migration and invasive activity of HCT-116 colon cancer cells in vitro. Besides, transplantation of HCT-116 cells along with hCC-MSCs in nude mice increased the tumor growth and metastasis. Further study revealed that IL-6 present in the hCC-MSC-conditioned medium sufficiently induced the levels of Notch-1 and CD44 in HCT-116 and HT-29 cells, which contribute to enhance tumorigenic activity of HCT-116 and HT-29 cells. By using immunohistochemical staining, the intense co-expression of IL-6, Notch-1 and CD44 was predominantly detected in human colon cancer tissues. Taken together, our findings suggest the importance of the IL-6/Notch-1/CD44 signaling axis in the interaction between hCC-MSCs and colon cancer cells.

Abstract: The Drosophila sponge (spg)/CG31048 gene belongs to the dedicator of cytokinesis (DOCK) family genes that are conserved in a wide variety of species. DOCK family members are known as DOCK1–DOCK11 in mammals. Although DOCK1 and DOCK2 involve neurite elongation and immunocyte differentiation, respectively, the functions of other DOCK family members are not fully understood. Spg is a Drosophila homolog of mammalian DOCK3 and DOCK4. Specific knockdown of spg by the GMR-GAL4 driver in eye imaginal discs induced abnormal eye morphology in adults. To mark the photoreceptor cells in eye imaginal discs, we used a set of enhancer trap strains that express lacZ in various sets of photoreceptor cells. Immunostaining with anti-Spg antibodies and anti-lacZ antibodies revealed that Spg is localized mainly in R7 photoreceptor cells. Knockdown of spg by the GMR-GAL4 driver reduced signals of R7 photoreceptor cells, suggesting involvement of Spg in R7 cell differentiation. Furthermore, immunostaining with anti-dpERK antibodies showed the level of activated ERK signal was reduced extensively by knockdown of spg in eye discs, and both the defects in eye morphology and dpERK signals were rescued by over-expression of the Drosophila raf gene, a component of the ERK signaling pathway. Furthermore, the Duolink in situ Proximity Ligation Assay method detected interaction signals between Spg and Rap1 in and around the plasma membrane of the eye disc cells. Together, these results indicate Spg positively regulates the ERK pathway that is required for R7 photoreceptor cell differentiation and the regulation is mediated by interaction with Rap1 during development of the compound eye.

Abstract: Summary
Host inflammation alters the availability of nutrients such as iron to limit microbial growth. However, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium thrives in the inflamed gut by scavenging for iron with siderophores. By administering Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917, which assimilates iron by similar mechanisms, we show that this nonpathogenic bacterium can outcompete and reduce S. Typhimurium colonization in mouse models of acute colitis and chronic persistent infection. This probiotic activity depends on E. coli Nissle iron acquisition, given that mutants deficient in iron uptake colonize the intestine but do not reduce S. Typhimurium colonization. Additionally, the ability of E. coli Nissle to overcome iron restriction by the host protein lipocalin 2, which counteracts some siderophores, is essential, given that S. Typhimurium is unaffected by E. coli Nissle in lipocalin 2-deficient mice. Thus, iron availability impacts S. Typhimurium growth, and E. coli Nissle reduces S. Typhimurium intestinal colonization by competing for this limiting nutrient.

Vaccinia Virus F11 Promotes Viral Spread by Acting as a PDZ-Containing Scaffolding Protein to Bind Myosin-9A and Inhibit RhoA Signaling,

Abstract: Summary
The vaccinia F11 protein promotes viral spread by modulating the cortical actin cytoskeleton by inhibiting RhoA signaling via an unknown mechanism. PDZ domains are widely conserved protein interaction modules whose occurrence in viral proteins is unprecedented. We found that F11 contains a central PDZ-like domain that is required to downregulate RhoA signaling and enhance viral spread. The PDZ-like domain interacts with the PDZ binding motif of the Rho GTPase-activating protein (GAP) Myosin-9A. In the absence of Myosin-9A, RhoA signaling is not inhibited, resulting in fewer actin tails and reduced virus release concomitant with less viral spread. The loss of Myosin-9A GAP activity or its ability to bind F11 also reduces actin tail formation. Furthermore, the ability of Myosin-9A to promote viral spread depends on F11 binding RhoA. Thus, F11 acts as a functional PDZ-containing scaffolding protein to inhibit RhoA signaling by binding Myosin-9A.

Abstract: Summary
Translational regulation plays an essential role in Drosophila ovarian germline stem cell (GSC) biology. GSC self-renewal requires two translational repressors, Nanos (Nos) and Pumilio (Pum), which repress the expression of differentiation factors in the stem cells. The molecular mechanisms underlying this translational repression remain unknown. Here, we show that the CCR4 deadenylase is required for GSC self-renewal and that Nos and Pum act through its recruitment onto specific mRNAs. We identify mei-P26 mRNA as a direct and major target of Nos/Pum/CCR4 translational repression in the GSCs. mei-P26 encodes a protein of the Trim-NHL tumor suppressor family that has conserved functions in stem cell lineages. We show that fine-tuning Mei-P26 expression by CCR4 plays a key role in GSC self-renewal. These results identify the molecular mechanism of Nos/Pum function in GSC self-renewal and reveal the role of CCR4-NOT-mediated deadenylation in regulating the balance between GSC self-renewal and differentiation.

Abstract: Notch signalling has been implicated during haematopoietic development in vivo and in the differentiation of haematopoietic cells from pluripotent cells in vitro. However interpretation of data from many of these studies has been complicated by the heterogeneous nature of cell populations under study and by the fact that the Notch pathway is active during embryogenesis prior to the development of the haematopoietic system. To define the role of Notch signalling in more precise cell populations during the early stages of haematopoietic development within the aorta–gonad–mesonephros (AGM) microenvironment we co-cultured differentiating ESCs on a stromal cell line derived from this region of the embryo. Our co-culture system had no effect on the production of FLK1+ mesoderm progenitor cells but promoted their subsequent haematopoietic differentiation. We assessed the role of Notch signalling on haematopoietic differentiation of isolated FLK1+ cells. Notch activity is dynamic and drops to basal levels as FLK1+ cells commit to a haematopoietic fate. Further reduction of Notch activity by the inducible expression of dominant negative MAML had no functional consequences. In contrast, induction of Notch activity using an inducible NotchIC expression system had an inhibitory effect on haematopoietic differentiation. We used a Cre-mediated recombination strategy whereby NotchIC-expressing cells were marked with the hCD2 receptor and observed a reduction in the number of multi-lineage and myeloid colonies derived from NotchIC+ compared to NotchIC− FLK1+ cells isolated from the same culture. We believe that our culture system represents a good model for haematopoietic development within the AGM microenvironment and our data suggest that haematopoietic commitment of FLK1+ cells in this setting occurs when Notch activity is below a specific threshold.

Abstract: Summary
The obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis (Ctr) has been associated with cervical and ovarian cancer development. However, establishment of causality and the underlying mechanisms remain outstanding. Our analysis of Ctr-induced alterations to global host histone modifications revealed distinct patterns of histone marks during acute and persistent infections. In particular, pH2AX (Ser139) and H3K9me3, hallmarks of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF), respectively, showed sustained upregulation during Ctr infection. Ctr-induced reactive oxygen species were found to contribute to persistent DSBs, which in turn elicited SAHF formation in an ERK-dependent manner. Furthermore, Ctr interfered with DNA damage responses (DDR) by inhibiting recruitment of the DDR proteins pATM and 53BP1 to damaged sites. Despite impaired DDR, Ctr-infected cells continued to proliferate, supported by enhanced oncogenic signals involving ERK, CyclinE, and SAHF. Thus, by perturbing host chromatin, DSB repair, and cell-cycle regulation, Ctr generates an environment favorable for malignant transformation.

Abstract: The objective of this study was to establish a porcine spermatogonial germ cell (pSGC) line and develop an in vitro culture system. Isolated total testicular cells (TTCs) from 5-day-old porcine testes were primary cultured at 31, 34, and 37°C. Although the time of colony appearance was delayed at 31°C, strong alkaline phosphatase staining, expressions of pluripotency marker genes such as OCT4, NANOG, and THY1, and the gene expressions of the undifferentiated germ cell markers PLZF and protein gene product 9.5 (PGP9.5) were identified compared to 34 and 37°C. Cell cycle analysis for both pSGC and feeder cells at the three temperatures revealed that more pSGCs were in the G2/M phase at 31°C than 37°C at the subculture stage. In vitro, pSGCs could stably maintain undifferentiated germ cell and stem cell characteristics for over 60days during culture at 31°C. Xenotransplantation of pSGCs to immune deficient mice demonstrated a successful colonization and localization on the seminiferous tubule basement membrane in the recipient testes. In conclusion, pSGCs from neonatal porcine were successfully established and cultured for long periods under a low temperature culture environment in vitro.

Abstract: Mechanisms involved in establishing the organization and numbers of fibres in a muscle are not completely understood. During Drosophila indirect flight muscle (IFM) formation, muscle growth is achieved by both incorporating hundreds of nuclei, and hypertrophy. As a result, IFMs provide a good model with which to understand the mechanisms that govern overall muscle organization and growth. We present a detailed analysis of the organization of dorsal longitudinal muscles (DLMs), a subset of the IFMs. We show that each DLM is similar to a vertebrate fascicle and consists of multiple muscle fibres. However, increased fascicle size does not necessarily change the number of constituent fibres, but does increase the number of myofibrils packed within the fibres. We also find that altering the number of myoblasts available for fusion changes DLM fascicle size and fibres are loosely packed with myofibrils. Additionally, we show that knock down of genes required for mitochondrial fusion causes a severe reduction in the size of DLM fascicles and fibres. Our results establish the organization levels of DLMs and highlight the importance of the appropriate number of nuclei and mitochondrial fusion in determining the overall organization, growth and size of DLMs.

Abstract: Polymorphisms have been identified in several HSP70 genes, which may affect HSP70 repair efficiency. We investigated the association of the polymorphisms in HSPA1A, HSPA1B, and HSPA1L genes in the HSPs repair pathway with the risk of cataract in a Chinese population. The study included 415 cataract patients and 386 controls. Genotyping was done by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. HSPA1B 1267 A/A genotype seems to have a protective role against cataract (p = 0.014, odds ratio (OR) = 0.664, 95 % confidence intervals (CI) = 0.480–0.919), and the G allele (p = 0.057, OR = 1.216, 95 % CI = 0.999–1.479) does not seem to have a deleterious role in the development of cataract. Haplotypes with frequencies of GAT were significantly different than those of controls (p = 0.005). In HSPA1A G190C and HSPA1L T2437C polymorphisms, there were no significant differences in frequencies of the variant homozygous in patients compared to controls. We conclude that the A/A genotype of HSPA1B A1267G polymorphism seem to have a protective role against age-related cataract.

Abstract: Osteosarcoma is the most common primary solid malignant bone tumor. Despite substantial improvements in surgery and chemotherapy, metastasis remains a major cause of fatal outcomes, and the molecular mechanisms of metastasis are still poorly understood. Hypoxia, which is common in malignant tumors including osteosarcoma, increases expressions of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9, and can induce invasiveness. As we previously showed a novel transcutaneous CO2 application to decrease HIF-1α expression and induce apoptosis in malignant fibrous histiocytoma, we hypothesize that transcutaneous CO2 application could suppress metastatic potential of osteosarcoma by improving hypoxic conditions. Here, we examined the effects of transcutaneous CO2 application on apoptosis, and development of pulmonary metastasis using a highly metastatic osteosarcoma cell line, LM8. Transcutaneous CO2 application significantly decreased tumor growth and pulmonary metastasis in LM8 cells. Apoptotic activity increased, and intratumoral hypoxia was improved with decreased expressions of HIF-1α, MMP-2 and MMP-9, significantly, in the CO2-treated tumors. In conclusion, we found that transcutaneous CO2 application can induce tumor cell apoptosis and might suppress pulmonary metastasis by improvement of hypoxic conditions with decreased expressions of HIF-1α and MMPs in highly metastatic osteosarcoma cell. These findings strongly indicate that this novel transcutaneous CO2 therapy could be a therapeutic breakthrough for osteosarcoma patients.

Abstract: Ca2+ is a critical factor in the regulation of signal transduction and Ca2+ homeostasis is altered in different human diseases. The level of Ca2+ in cells is highly regulated through a diverse class of regulators. Among them is the transient receptor potential vanilloid 6 (TRPV6), which is a Ca2+ selective channel that absorbs Ca2+ in the small intestine. TRPV6 is overexpressed in some cancers and exhibits oncogenic potential, but its exact mechanism is still poorly understood. The Numb protein is a cell fate determinant that functions in endocytosis and as a tumor suppressor via the stabilization of p53. Numb protein consisted of four isoforms. Here, we showed a novel function of Numb1, which negatively regulates TRPV6 activity. The expression of Numb1 decreased cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations in TRPV6-transfected HEK293 cells. When all the isoforms of Numb were depleted using siRNA in a TRPV6 stable cell line, the levels of cytosolic Ca2+ increased. We observed an interaction between Numb1 and TRPV6 using co-immunoprecipitation. We confirmed this interaction using Fluorescence Resolution Energy Transfer (FRET). We identified the TRPV6 and Numb1 binding site using TRPV6 C-terminal truncation mutants and Numb1 deletion mutants. The binding site in TRPV6 was an aspartic acid at amino acid residue 716, and that binding site in Numb1 was arginine at amino acid residue 434. A Numb1 mutant, lacking TRPV6 binding activity, failed to inhibit TRPV6 activity. Every isoform of Numb knockdown, using an siRNA-based approach in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, not only showed enhanced TRPV6 expression but also both the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and cell proliferation were increased. The down-regulated expression of TRPV6 using siRNA increased Numb protein expression; however, the cytosolic influx of Ca2+ and proliferation of the cell were decreased. To examine downstream signaling during Ca2+ influx, we performed Western blotting analysis on TRPV6 upregulated cancer cells (MCF-7, PC-3). Taken together, these results demonstrated that Numb1 interacts with TRPV6 through charged residues and inhibits its activity via the regulation of protein expression. Moreover, we provided evidence for a Ca2+-regulated cancer cell signaling pathway and that the Ca2+ channel is a target of cancer cells.

Abstract: Little is known about the pathophysiology of acute exacerbation (AE) of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Heat shock protein 47 (HSP47), a collagen-specific molecular chaperone, is essential for biosynthesis and secretion of collagen molecules. Previous studies in experimental animal fibrosis models have shown that downregulation of HSP47 expression reduces collagen production and diminishes fibrosis progression. In this study, serum HSP47 levels were evaluated to elucidate pathogenic differences involving HSP47 between AE-IPF and stable (S)-IPF. Subjects comprised 20 AE-IPF and 33 S-IPF patients. Serum levels of HSP47, Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6), surfactant protein (SP)-A, SP-D, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were measured. Immunohistochemical analysis of lung HSP47 expression was determined in biopsy and autopsy tissues diagnosed as diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). Serum levels of HSP47 were significantly higher in AE-IPF than in S-IPF patients, whereas serum levels of KL-6, SP-A, and SP-D did not differ significantly. Receiver operating characteristic curves revealed that HSP47 was superior for discriminating AE-IPF and S-IPF. The cutoff for HSP47 resulting in the highest diagnostic accuracy was 559.4 pg/mL; sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy were 100.0 %, 93.9 %, and 96.2 %, respectively. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that pulmonary HSP47 expression was greater in DAD than UIP tissues. Serum HSP47 was significantly higher in AE-IPF than in S-IPF patients, suggesting that underlying fibrogenic mechanisms involving HSP47 differ in the two conditions.

Abstract: Heat stress results in misfolding and aggregation of cellular proteins. Heat shock proteins (Hsp) enable the cells to maintain proper folding of proteins, both in unstressed as well as stressed conditions. Hsp70 genes encode for a group of highly conserved chaperone proteins across the living systems encompassing bacteria, plants, and animals. In the cellular chaperone network, Hsp70 family proteins interconnect other chaperones and play a dominant role in various cell processes. To assess the functionality of rice Hsp70 genes, rice genome database was analyzed. Rice genome contains 32 Hsp70 genes. Rice Hsp70 superfamily genes are represented by 24 Hsp70 family and 8 Hsp110 family members. Promoter and transcript expression analysis divulges that Hsp70 superfamily genes plays important role in heat stress. Ssc1 (mitochondrial Hsp70 protein in yeast) deleted yeast show compromised growth at 37 °C. Three mitochondrial rice Hsp70 sequences (i.e., mtHsp70-1, mtHsp70-2, and mtHsp70-3) complemented the Ssc1 mutation of yeast to differential extents. The information presented in this study provides detailed understanding of the Hsp70 protein family of rice, the crop species that is the major food for the world population.

Abstract: Non-physiological components of peritoneal dialysis fluids (PDF) lead to the injury of peritoneal mesothelial cells resulting in the failure of peritoneal dialysis (PD) potentially via inadequate induction of the protective heat shock response (HSR). Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) is a negative regulator of cell survival partly by suppression of the HSR and is influenced by stress stimuli also present in conventional PDF. The effects of PDF on GSK-3β activation and the impact of GSK-3β inhibition with lithium (LiCl) were investigated on cell survival with special regard to HSR, in particular to heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF-1) activation and Hsp72 production in an in vitro model of PD using MeT-5A and primary mesothelial cells. Incubation of cells with the PDF Dianeal® (glucose-based, low pH, high glucose degradation products (GDP)) and Extraneal® (icodextrin-based, low pH, low GDP) caused activation of GSK-3β compared to the other tested PDF, i.e. Balance®, Physioneal® (normal pH, glucose-based, low GDP) and Nutrineal® (moderately acidic, amino acid-based). Inhibition of GSK-3β with LiCl in Dianeal® and Extraneal®-treated cells dose-dependently decreased cell damage and death rate and was paralleled by higher HSF-1 activation and Hsp72 expression. GSK-3β is activated by low pH GDP containing PDF with and without glucose as osmotic agent, indicating that GSK-3β is involved in mesothelial cell signalling in response to experimental PD. Inhibition of GSK-3β with LiCl ameliorated cell injury and improved HSR upon PDF exposure. Thus, GSK-3β inhibitors likely have therapeutic potential as cytoprotective additive for decreasing PDF toxicity.

Abstract: Endothelial cells (ECs) are an essential component of the hematopoietic microenvironment, which maintains and regulates hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Although ECs can support the regeneration of otherwise lethally-irradiated HSCs, the mechanisms are not well understood. To further understand this phenomenon, we studied HSC regeneration from irradiated bone marrow using co-culture with human aortic ECs (HAECs). Co-culture with HAECs induced a 24-fold expansion of long-term HSCs (CD150+, lineagelo, Sca-1+, c-Kit+; CD150+LSK cells) in vitro. These cells gave rise to functional hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) with colony-forming activity, multilineage reconstitution and serial transplantation potential. Furthermore, HAECs significantly reduced DNA damage in irradiated LSK cells within 24h. Remarkably, we were able to delay the exposure of irradiated bone marrow to the regenerative, HAEC-derived signals for up to 48h and still rescue functional HSCs. G-CSF is the gold standard for promoting hematopoietic regeneration in vivo. However, when compared to HAECs, in vitro G-CSF treatment promoted lineage differentiation and regenerated 5-fold fewer CD150+LSK cells. Together, our results show that HAECs are powerful, direct mitigators of HSC injury and DNA damage. Identification of the HAEC-derived factors that rescue HSCs may lead to improved therapies for hematopoietic regeneration after radiation injury.

Abstract: Summary
Eradication of persistent intracellular bacterial pathogens with antibiotic therapy is often slow or incomplete. However, strategies to augment antibiotics are hampered by our poor understanding of the nutritional environment that sustains chronic infection. Here we show that the intracellular pathogen Brucella abortus survives and replicates preferentially in alternatively activated macrophages (AAMs), which are more abundant during chronic infection. A metabolic shift induced by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), which increases intracellular glucose availability, is identified as a causal mechanism promoting enhanced bacterial survival in AAMs. Glucose uptake was crucial for increased replication of B. abortus in AAMs, and for chronic infection, as inactivation of the bacterial glucose transporter gluP reduced both intracellular survival in AAMs and persistence in mice. Thus, a shift in intracellular nutrient availability induced by PPARγ promotes chronic persistence of B. abortus within AAMs, and targeting this pathway may aid in eradicating chronic infection.

Abstract: Summary
Shifts in commensal microbiota composition are emerging as a hallmark of gastrointestinal inflammation. In particular, outgrowth of γ-proteobacteria has been linked to the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease and the pathologic consequences of infections. Here we show that following acute Toxoplasma gondii gastrointestinal infection of mice, control of commensal outgrowth is a highly coordinated process involving both the host response and microbial signals. Notably, neutrophil emigration to the intestinal lumen results in the generation of organized intraluminal structures that encapsulate commensals and limit their contact with the epithelium. Formation of these luminal casts depends on the high-affinity N-formyl peptide receptor, Fpr1. Consequently, after infection, mice deficient in Fpr1 display increased microbial translocation, poor commensal containment, and increased mortality. Altogether, our study describes a mechanism by which the host rapidly contains commensal pathobiont outgrowth during infection. Further, these results reveal Fpr1 as a major mediator of host commensal interaction during dysbiosis.

Abstract: Summary
During infection, humoral immunity produces a polyclonal response with various immunoglobulins recognizing different epitopes within the microbe or toxin. Despite this diverse response, the biological activity of an antibody (Ab) is usually assessed by the action of a monoclonal population. We demonstrate that a combination of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that are individually disease enhancing or neutralizing to Bacillus anthracis protective antigen (PA), a component of anthrax toxin, results in significantly augmented protection against the toxin. This boosted protection is Fc gamma receptor (FcγR) dependent and involves the formation of stoichiometrically defined mAb-PA complexes that requires immunoglobulin bivalence and simultaneous interaction between PA and the two mAbs. The formation of these mAb-PA complexes inhibits PA oligomerization, resulting in protection. These data suggest that functional assessments of single Abs may inaccurately predict how the same Abs will operate in polyclonal preparations and imply that potentially therapeutic mAbs may be overlooked in single Ab screens.

Synergistic Regulation of Hyphal Elongation by Hypoxia, CO2, and Nutrient Conditions Controls the Virulence of Candida albicans,

Abstract: Summary
Candida albicans reversibly switches between yeast and hyphal morphologies, with hyphae being associated with virulence. Hyphal initiation and maintenance depend on host environment sensing. Hyphal maintenance in vitro requires chromatin remodeling of hypha-specific gene promoters, although disrupting chromatin-remodeling does not disrupt C. albicans hyphal elongation and virulence during invasive infection. We find that the combination of hypoxia and high CO2, but neither condition alone, maintains hyphal elongation, even in mutants lacking the nutrient-responsive chromatin-remodeling pathway. Ume6, the transcriptional activator of hypha-specific genes, is stabilized via regulation by Ofd1, a prolyl hydroxylase family member inhibited by hypoxia, and by an uncharacterized pathway that senses high CO2. Virulence and hyphal elongation in vivo are attenuated only when the parallelly acting Ume6 stabilization and chromatin-remodeling pathways are both blocked. The evolution of redundant signaling pathways allowing C. albicans to adapt to varied host environments may explain this commensal’s success as a pathogen.

Abstract: Summary
A pathogen’s ability to engage host receptors is a critical determinant of its host range and interspecies transmissibility, key issues for understanding emerging diseases. However, the identification of host receptors, which are also attractive drug targets, remains a major challenge. Our structural bioinformatics studies reveal that both bacterial and viral pathogens have evolved to structurally mimic native host ligands (ligand mimicry), thus enabling engagement of their cognate host receptors. In contrast to the structural homology, amino acid sequence similarity between pathogen molecules and the mimicked host ligands was low. We illustrate the utility of this concept to identify pathogen receptors by delineating receptor tyrosine kinase Axl as a candidate receptor for the polyomavirus SV40. The SV40-Axl interaction was validated, and its participation in the infection process was verified. Our results suggest that ligand mimicry is widespread, and we present a quick tool to screen for pathogen-host receptor interactions.

Abstract: Summary
The Plasmodium liver stage is an attractive target for the development of antimalarial drugs and vaccines, as it provides an opportunity to interrupt the life cycle of the parasite at a critical early stage. However, targeting the liver stage has been difficult. Undoubtedly, a major barrier has been the lack of robust, reliable, and reproducible in vitro liver-stage cultures. Here, we establish the liver stages for both Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax in a microscale human liver platform composed of cryopreserved, micropatterned human primary hepatocytes surrounded by supportive stromal cells. Using this system, we have successfully recapitulated the full liver stage of P. falciparum, including the release of infected merozoites and infection of overlaid erythrocytes, as well as the establishment of small forms in late liver stages of P. vivax. Finally, we validate the potential of this platform as a tool for medium-throughput antimalarial drug screening and vaccine development.

Abstract: It has been suggested that nitric oxide (NO) derived from chronically inflamed tissues is a cause of carcinogenesis. We herein demonstrated that administration of an inducible NO synthase inhibitor, aminoguanidine, significantly suppressed the tumorigenic conversion of human colonic adenoma (FPCK-1-1) cells into adenocarcinoma (FPCK/Inflam) cells accelerated by foreign body-induced chronic inflammation in nude mice. To determine whether NO directly promotes carcinogenesis, we exposed FPCK-1-1 cells continuously to chemically generated NO (FPCK/NO), and periodically examined their tumorigenicity. FPCK/NO cells formed tumors, whereas vehicle-treated cells (FPCK/NaOH) did not. We selected a tumorigenic population from FPCK/NO cells kept it in three-dimensional (3D) culture where in vivo-like multicellular spheroidal growth was expected. FPCK/Inflam cells developed large spheroids whereas FPCK/NO cells formed tiny but growing compact aggregates in 3D culture. Meanwhile, FPCK-1-1 and FPCK/NaOH cells underwent anoikis (apoptotic cell death consequential on insufficient cell-to-substrate interactions) through activation of caspase 3. The survived cells in the 3D culture (FPCK/NO/3D), which were derived from FPCK/NO cells, showed a similar tumor incidence to that of FPCK/Inflam cells. These results showed that NO was one of the causative factors for the acceleration of colon carcinogenesis, especially in the conversion from adenoma to adenocarcinoma in the chronic inflammatory environment.

Abstract: The human homolog of the yeast cse1 gene (CSE1L) is over-expressed in ovarian cancer. CSE1L forms complex with Ran and importin-α and has roles in nucleocytoplasmic traffic and gene expression. CSE1L accumulated in the nucleus of ovarian cancer cell lines, while it was localized also in the cytoplasm of other cancer cell lines. Nuclear localization depended on AKT, which was constitutively active in ovarian cancer cells, as the CSE1L protein translocated to the cytoplasm when AKT was inactivated. Moreover, the expression of a constitutively active AKT forced the translocation of CSE1L from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in other cancer cells. Nuclear accrual of CSE1L was associated to the nuclear accumulation of the phosphorylated Ran Binding protein 3 (RanBP3), which depended on AKT as well. Also in samples of human ovarian cancer, AKT activation was associated to nuclear accumulation of CSE1L and phosphorylation of RanBP3. Expression profiling of ovarian cancer cells after CSE1L silencing showed that CSE1L was required for the expression of genes promoting invasion and metastasis. In agreement, CSE1L silencing impaired motility and invasiveness of ovarian cancer cells. Altogether these data show that in ovarian cancer cells activated AKT by affecting RanBP3 phosphorylation determines the nuclear accumulation of CSE1L and likely the nuclear concentration of transcription factors conveying pro-oncogenic signals.

Abstract: Epithelial cells and fibroblasts both express heat shock transcription factors, HSF1 and HSF4, yet they respond to heat shock differentially. For example, while HSP70 is induced in both cell types, the small heat shock protein, αB-crystallin gene (CRYAB) that contains a canonical heat shock promoter, is only induced in fibroblasts. A canonical heat shock promoter contains three or more inverted repeats of the pentanucleotide 5′-nGAAn-3′ that make the heat shock element. It is known that, in vitro, promoter architecture (the order and spacing of these repeats) impacts the interaction of various heat shock transcription factors (HSFs) with the heat shock promoter, but in vivo relevance of these binding preferences so far as the expression is concerned is poorly understood. In this report, we first establish cell-type-dependent differential expression of CRYAB in four established cell lines and then working with adult human retinal pigment epithelial cells and NIH3T3 fibroblasts and employing chromatin immunoprecipitation, attempt to relate expression to promoter occupancy by HSF1 and HSF4. We show that HSF4 occupies only CRYAB and not HSP70 promoter in epithelial cells, while HSF1 occupies only HSP70 promoter in both cell types, and cryab promoter, only in heat shocked fibroblasts; HSF4, on the other hand, is never seen on these two promoters in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. This comparative analysis with CRYAB and HSP70 demonstrates that differential heat shock response is controlled by cell-type-dependent access of HSFs (HSF1 and HSF4) to specific promoters, independent of the promoter architecture.

Abstract: Summary
Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) occupy a spectrum of reversible molecular states ranging from a naive ground-state in 2i, to metastable embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in serum, to lineage-primed epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs). To investigate the role of DNA methylation (5mC) across distinct pluripotent states, we mapped genome-wide 5mC and 5-hydroxymethycytosine (5hmC) in multiple PSCs. Ground-state ESCs exhibit an altered distribution of 5mC and 5hmC at regulatory elements and dramatically lower absolute levels relative to ESCs in serum. By contrast, EpiSCs exhibit increased promoter 5mC coupled with reduced 5hmC, which contributes to their developmental restriction. Switch to 2i triggers rapid onset of both the ground-state gene expression program and global DNA demethylation. Mechanistically, repression of de novo methylases by PRDM14 drives DNA demethylation at slow kinetics, whereas TET1/TET2-mediated 5hmC conversion enhances both the rate and extent of hypomethylation. These processes thus act synergistically during transition to ground-state pluripotency to promote a robust hypomethylated state.

Abstract: Heat stress results in apoptosis in testicular germ cells. A small heat shock protein (hsp), hsp32, is induced by heat stress in the testis, but little is known about its definitive function in physiological processes. To clarify the underlying role of hsp32, hsp32 expression and related signals in the heat shock pathway were analysed in mouse testes and Sertoli cells after heat stress in vivo and in vitro; meanwhile, expression of hsp32 was silenced only in the Sertoli cells using three different small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to further verify the functional role of hsp32 in Sertoli cells, and hsp32-derived carbon monoxide (CO) contents in cultured media were analysed to clarify whether hsp32-derived CO involve in the apoptosis regulation mechanisms. The results from the in vivo experiment showed that the high expression levels of hsp32 (P < 0.05) were observed whether chronic, moderate or acute, transient heat exposure. The in vitro experiment showed that acute, transient heat exposure resulted in increases in Sertoli cells apoptosis (P < 0.01), the expression of hsp32 and caspase-3 activity; hsp32-siRNA knockdown of hsp32 expression resulted in upregulated apoptosis (P < 0.01) and caspase-3 activity (P < 0.01) in the Sertoli cells and hyperthermia increases CO (P < 0.01) release by Sertoli cells. The results suggested that upregulating hsp32 in Sertoli cells inhibits caspase-3 activity and alleviates heat-induced impairments in mouse testis; hsp32-derived CO may involve in the regulation mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
RNA interference (RNAi) is an established antiviral defense mechanism in plants and invertebrates. Whether RNAi serves a similar function in mammalian cells remains unresolved. We find that in some cell types, mammalian RNAi activity is reduced shortly after viral infection via poly-ADP-ribosylation of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), a core component of RNAi. Well-established antiviral signaling pathways, including RIG-I/MAVS and RNaseL, contribute to inhibition of RISC. In the absence of virus infection, microRNAs repress interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) associated with cell death and proliferation, thus maintaining homeostasis. Upon detection of intracellular pathogen-associated molecular patterns, RISC activity decreases, contributing to increased expression of ISGs. Our results suggest that, unlike in lower eukaryotes, mammalian RISC is not antiviral in some contexts, but rather RISC has been co-opted to negatively regulate toxic host antiviral effectors via microRNAs.

Abstract: The human myelogenous cell line, K562 has been extensively used as a model for the study of megakaryocytic (MK) differentiation, which could be achieved by exposure to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). In this study, real-time PCR analysis revealed that the expression of catalase (cat) was significantly repressed during MK differentiation of K562 cells induced by PMA. In addition, PMA increased the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentration, suggesting that ROS was a key factor for PMA-induced differentiation. PMA-differentiated K562 cells were exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to clarify the function of ROS during MK differentiation. Interestingly, the percentage of high-ploidy (DNA content >4N) cells with H2O2 was 34.8±2.3% at day 9, and was 70% larger than that without H2O2 (21.5±0.8%). Further, H2O2 addition during the first 3 days of PMA-induced MK differentiation had the greatest effect on polyploidization. In an effort to elucidate the mechanisms of enhanced polyploidization by H2O2, the BrdU assay clearly indicated that H2O2 suppressed the division of 4N cells into 2N cells, followed by the increased polyploidization of K562 cells. These findings suggest that the enhancement in polyploidization mediated by H2O2 is due to synergistic inhibition of cytokinesis with PMA. Although H2O2 did not increase ploidy during the MK differentiation of primary cells, we clearly observed that cat expression was repressed in both immature and mature primary MK cells, and that treatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine effectively blocked and/or delayed the polyploidization of immature MK cells. Together, these findings suggest that MK cells are more sensitive to ROS levels during earlier stages of maturation.

Abstract: Summary
SAMHD1 is a cellular enzyme that depletes intracellular deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) and inhibits the ability of retroviruses, notably HIV-1, to infect myeloid cells. Although SAMHD1 is expressed in both cycling and noncycling cells, the antiviral activity of SAMHD1 is limited to noncycling cells. We determined that SAMHD1 is phosphorylated on residue T592 in cycling cells but that this phosphorylation is lost when cells are in a noncycling state. Reverse genetic experiments revealed that SAMHD1 phosphorylated on residue T592 is unable to block retroviral infection, but this modification does not affect the ability of SAMHD1 to decrease cellular dNTP levels. SAMHD1 contains a target motif for cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (cdk1) (592TPQK595), and cdk1 activity is required for SAMHD1 phosphorylation. Collectively, these findings indicate that phosphorylation modulates the ability of SAMHD1 to block retroviral infection without affecting its ability to decrease cellular dNTP levels.

Abstract: Objective
Acetaminophen intoxication is a leading cause of acute liver failure. Liver transplantation for acute liver failure is limited by the availability of donor organs. In this study, we aimed at identifying if the transplantation of adipose tissue-mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) may exert therapeutic effects on acetaminophen-induced liver injury.
Methods
ASCs were isolated from human subcutaneous tissue and were transfected with a green fluorescent protein (GFP). Sprague–Dawley rats were administrated 300mg/kg of acetaminophen intraperitoneally and were transplanted with ASCs or vehicle. After 24h from acetaminophen administration, rats were sacrificed. Hepatic levels of isoprostanes, 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-OHG), nitrites/nitrates and reduced glutathione (GSH) were determined as markers of oxidative stress; JNK phosphorylation and hepatic levels of inflammatory cytokines and regeneration factors were also assessed.
Results
Transplantation of ASCs decreased AST, ALT and prothrombin time to the levels observed in control rats. Transplanted animals had normal plasma ammonia and did not display clinical encephalopathy. Liver sections of intoxicated rats treated with vehicle showed lobular necrosis and diffuse vacuolar degeneration; in rats transplanted with ASCs liver injury was almost absent. Transplantation of ASCs decreased liver isoprostanes, 8-OHG and nitrite–nitrates to the levels of control rats, while preserving GSH. Consistently, hepatic levels of TNF-α, MCP-1, IL-1β, ICAM-1 and phospho-JNK were markedly increased in rats treated with vehicle and were restored to the levels of controls in animals transplanted with ASCs. Furthermore, ASC transplantation increased liver expression of cyclin D1 and PCNA, two established hepatocyte regeneration factors, whereas ASCs were not able to metabolize acetaminophen in vitro.
Conclusion
In this study, we demonstrated that ASC transplantation is effective in treating acetaminophen liver injury by enhancing hepatocyte regeneration and inhibiting liver stress and inflammatory signaling.

Abstract: In allogenic and xenogenic transplantation, adequate immunosuppression plays a major role in graft survival, especially over the long term. The effect of immunosuppressive drugs on neural stem/progenitor cell fate has not been sufficiently explored. The focus of this study is to systematically investigate the effects of the following four different immunotherapeutic strategies on human neural progenitor cell survival/death, proliferation, metabolic activity, differentiation and migration in vitro: (1) cyclosporine A (CsA), a calcineurin inhibitor; (2) everolimus (RAD001), an mTOR-inhibitor; (3) mycophenolic acid (MPA, mycophenolate), an inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase and (4) prednisolone, a steroid. At the minimum effective concentration (MEC), we found a prominent decrease in hNPCs' proliferative capacity (BrdU incorporation), especially for CsA and MPA, and an alteration of the NAD(P)H-dependent metabolic activity. Cell death rate, neurogenesis, gliogenesis and cell migration remained mostly unaffected under these conditions for all four immunosuppressants, except for apoptotic cell death, which was significantly increased by MPA treatment.

Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells undergo the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) during chemotherapy, which reduces the efficacy of doxorubicin-based chemotherapy. We investigated N1-guanyl-1,7-diaminoheptane (GC7) which inhibits eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A2 (eIF5A2) activation; eIF5A2 is associated with chemoresistance. GC7 enhanced doxorubicin cytotoxicity in epithelial HCC cells (Huh7, Hep3B and HepG2) but had little effect in mesenchymal HCC cells (SNU387, SNU449). GC7 suppressed the doxorubicin-induced EMT in epithelial HCC cells; knockdown of eIF5A2 inhibited the doxorubicin-induced EMT and enhanced doxorubicin cytotoxicity. GC7 combination therapy may enhance the therapeutic efficacy of doxorubicin in HCC by inhibiting eIF5A2 activation and preventing the EMT.

Abstract: To uncover the molecular composition and dynamics of the functional scaffold for the nucleus, three fractions of biochemically-stable nuclear protein complexes were extracted and used as immunogens to produce a variety of monoclonal antibodies. Many helix-based cytoskeletal proteins were identified as antigens, suggesting their dynamic contribution to nuclear architecture and function. Interestingly, sets of antibodies distinguished distinct subcellular localization of a single isoform of certain cytoskeletal proteins; distinct molecular forms of keratin and actinin were found in the nucleus. Their nuclear shuttling properties were verified by the apparent nuclear accumulations under inhibition of CRM1-dependent nuclear export. Nuclear keratins do not take an obvious filamentous structure, as was revealed by non-filamentous cytoplasmic keratin-specific monoclonal antibody. These results suggest the distinct roles of the helix-based cytoskeletal proteins in the nucleus.

Abstract: Summary
Analysis of genes required for host infection will provide clues to the drivers of evolutionary fitness of pathogens like Vibrio cholerae, a mounting threat to global heath. We used transposon insertion site sequencing (Tn-seq) to comprehensively assess the contribution of nearly all V. cholerae genes toward growth in the infant rabbit intestine. Four hundred genes were identified as critical to V. cholerae in vivo fitness. These included most known colonization factors and several new genes affecting the bacterium’s metabolic properties, resistance to bile, and ability to synthesize cyclic AMP-GMP. Notably, a mutant carrying an insertion in tsiV3, encoding immunity to a bacteriocidal type VI secretion system (T6SS) effector VgrG3, exhibited a colonization defect. The reduced in vivo fitness of tsiV3 mutants depends on their cocolonization with bacterial cells carrying an intact T6SS locus and VgrG3 gene, suggesting that the V. cholerae T6SS is functional and mediates antagonistic interbacterial interactions during infection.

Norepinephrine inhibits the migratory activity of pancreatic cancer cells,

Abstract: We have shown previously that norepinephrine induces migratory activity of tumour cells from breast, colon and prostate tissue via activation of beta-2 adrenergic receptors. Consequently, this effect can be inhibited pharmacologically by clinically established beta-blockers. Tumour cell migration is a prerequisite for metastasis formation, and accordingly we and others have shown that breast cancer patients, which take beta-blockers due to hypertension, have reduced metastasis formation and increased survival probability as compared to patients without hypertension or using other anti-hypertensive medication. Unlike the aforementioned tumour cells, pancreatic cancer cells show a reduced migratory activity upon norepinephrine treatment. By means of our three-dimensional, collagen-based cell migration assay, we have investigated the signal transduction pathways involved in this phenomenon. We have found that this conflicting effect of norepinephrine on pancreatic cancer cells is due to an imbalanced activation of the two pathways that usually mediate a pro-migratory effect of norepinephrine in other tumour cell types. Firstly, the inhibitory effect results from activation of a pathway which causes a strong increase of the secondary cell signalling molecule, cAMP. In addition, activation of phospholipase C gamma and the downstream protein kinase C alpha were shown to be already activated in pancreatic cancer cells and cannot be further activated by norepinephrine. We hypothesize that this constitutive activation of the phospholipase C gamma pathway is due to a cross-talk with receptor tyrosine kinase signalling, and this might also deliver an explanation for the unusual high spontaneous migratory activity of pancreatic cancer cells.

Abstract: Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (bfCNs) which provide innervation to the hippocampus and cortex, are required for memory and learning, and are primarily affected in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), resulting in related cognitive decline. Therefore generation of a source of bfCNs from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) is crucial for in vitro disease modeling and development of novel AD therapies. In addition, for the advancement of regenerative approaches there is a requirement for an accurate developmental model to study the neurogenesis and survival of this population. Here we demonstrate the efficient production of bfCNs, using a novel embryoid body (EB) based non-adherent differentiation (NAdD) protocol. We establish a specific basal forebrain neural stem cell (NSC) phenotype via expression of the basal forebrain transcription factors NKX2.1 and LHX8, as well as the general forebrain marker FOXG1. We present evidence that this lineage is achieved via recapitulation of embryonic events, with induction of intrinsic hedgehog signaling, through the use of a 3D non-adherent differentiation system. This is the first example of hPSC-derived basal forebrain-like NSCs, which are scalable via self-renewal in prolonged culture. Furthermore upon terminal differentiation these basal forebrain-like NSCs generate high numbers of cholinergic neurons expressing the specific markers ChAT, VACht and ISL1. These hPSC-derived bfCNs possess characteristics that are crucial in a model to study AD related cholinergic neuronal loss in the basal forebrain. Examples are expression of the therapeutic target p75NTR, the release of acetylcholine, and demonstration of a mature, and functional electrophysiological profile. In conclusion, this work provides a renewable source of human functional bfCNs applicable for studying AD specifically in the cholinergic system, and also provides a model of the key embryonic events in human bfCN development.

Abstract: All-trans retinoic acid (RA) signals via binding to retinoic acid receptors (RARs α, β, and γ). RA directly influences expression of Pdx1, a transcription factor essential for pancreatic development and beta-cell (β-cell) maturation. In this study we follow the differentiation of cultured wild-type (WT) vs. RARβ knockout (KO) embryonic stem (ES) cells into pancreatic islet cells. We found that RARβ KO ES cells show greatly reduced expression of some important endocrine markers of differentiated islet cells, such as glucagon, islet amyloid polypeptide (Iapp), and insulin 1 (Ins1) relative to WT. We conclude that RARβ activity is essential for proper differentiation of ES cells to pancreatic endocrine cells.

Abstract: Summary
The heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) family of heat shock proteins is an abundantly expressed and highly conserved family of ATP-dependent molecular chaperones. Hsp90 facilitates remodeling and activation of hundreds of proteins. In this study, we developed a screen to identify Hsp90-defective mutants in E. coli. The mutations obtained define a region incorporating residues from the middle and C-terminal domains of E. coli Hsp90. The mutant proteins are defective in chaperone activity and client binding in vitro. We constructed homologous mutations in S. cerevisiae Hsp82 and identified several that caused defects in chaperone activity in vivo and in vitro. However, the Hsp82 mutant proteins were less severely defective in client binding to a model substrate than the corresponding E. coli mutant proteins. Our results identify a region in Hsp90 important for client binding in E. coli Hsp90 and suggest an evolutionary divergence in the mechanism of client interaction by bacterial and yeast Hsp90.

Abstract: Summary
Histone posttranslational modifications control eukaryotic gene expression and regulate many biological processes including immunity. Pathogens alter host epigenetic control to aid pathogenesis. We find that the intracellular bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila uses a Dot/Icm type IV secreted effector, RomA, to uniquely modify the host chromatin landscape. RomA, a SET domain-containing methyltransferase, trimethylates K14 of histone H3, a histone mark not previously described in mammals. RomA localizes to the infected cell nucleus where it promotes a burst of H3K14 methylation and consequently decreases H3K14 acetylation, an activating histone mark, to repress host gene expression. ChIP-seq analysis identified 4,870 H3K14 methylated promoter regions, including innate immune genes. Significantly reduced replication of a RomA-deleted strain in host cells was trans-complemented by wild-type, but not by catalytically inactive, RomA. Thus, a secreted L. pneumophila effector targets the host cell nucleus and modifies histones to repress gene expression and promote efficient intracellular replication.

Abstract: Summary
We have established and efficient system to specify NG2/PDGF-Rα/OLIG2+ oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) at low, physiological (3%) oxygen levels. This was achieved via both forebrain and spinal cord origins, with up to 98% of cells expressing NG2. Developmental insights reveal a critical role for fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) in OLIG2 induction via ventral forebrain pathways. The OPCs mature in vitro to express O4 (46%) and subsequently become galactocerebroside (GALC), O1, and myelin basic protein-positive (MBP+) multibranching oligodendrocytes. These were cultured alongside hESC-derived neurons. The electrophysiological properties of human OPCs are similar to those of rat OPCs, with large voltage-gated sodium currents and the ability to fire action potentials. Exposure to a selective retinoid X receptor agonist increased the proportion of O4+ oligodendrocytes that express MBP from 5% to 30%. Thus, we have established a developmentally engineered system to investigate the biological properties of human OPCs and test the effects of putative remyelinating agents prior to clinical application.

Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer and often forms metastases, which are the most important prognostic factors. For further elucidation of the mechanism underlying the progression and metastasis of HCC, a culture system mimicking the in vivo tumor microenvironment is needed. In this study, we investigated the metastatic ability of HCC cells cultured within alginate gel (ALG) beads. In the culture system, HCC cells formed spheroids by proliferation and maintained in nuclear abnormalities. The gene and protein expression of metastasis-related molecules was increased in ALG beads, compared with the traditional adhesion culture. Furthermore, several gene expression levels in ALG bead culture system were even closer to liver cancer tissues. More importantly, in vitro invasion assay showed that the invasion cells derived from ALG beads was 7.8-fold higher than adhesion cells. Our results indicated that the in vitro three-dimensional (3D) model based on ALG beads increased metastatic ability compared with adhesion culture, even partly mimicked the in vivo tumor tissues. Moreover, due to the controllable preparation conditions, steady characteristics and production at large-scale, the 3D ALG bead model would become an important tool used in the high-throughput screening of anti-metastasis drugs and the metastatic mechanism research.

Abstract: Summary
Arenaviruses and hantaviruses cause severe human disease. Little is known regarding host proteins required for their propagation. We identified human proteins that interact with the glycoproteins (GPs) of a prototypic arenavirus and hantavirus and show that the lectin endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment 53 kDa protein (ERGIC-53), a cargo receptor required for glycoprotein trafficking within the early exocytic pathway, associates with arenavirus, hantavirus, coronavirus, orthomyxovirus, and filovirus GPs. ERGIC-53 binds to arenavirus GPs through a lectin-independent mechanism, traffics to arenavirus budding sites, and is incorporated into virions. ERGIC-53 is required for arenavirus, coronavirus, and filovirus propagation; in its absence, GP-containing virus particles form but are noninfectious, due in part to their inability to attach to host cells. Thus, we have identified a class of pathogen-derived ERGIC-53 ligands, a lectin-independent basis for their association with ERGIC-53, and a role for ERGIC-53 in the propagation of several highly pathogenic RNA virus families.

Abstract: To assess the consequences of inactivation of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) during aging, we analyzed the effect of HSF1 K80Q, a mutant unable to bind DNA, and of dnHSF1, a mutant lacking the activation domain, on the transcriptome of cells 6 and 24 h after heat shock. The primary response to heat shock (6 h recovery), of which 30 % was HSF1-dependent, had decayed 24 h after heat shock in control cells but was extended in HSF1 K80Q and dnHSF1 cells. Comparison with literature data showed that even the HSF1 dependent primary stress response is largely cell specific. HSF1 K80Q, but not HSF1 siRNA-treated, cells showed a delayed stress response: an increase in transcript levels of HSF1 target genes 24 h after heat stress. Knockdown of NRF2, but not of ATF4, c-Fos or FosB, inhibited this delayed stress response. EEF1D_L siRNA inhibited both the delayed and the extended primary stress responses, but had off target effects. In control cells an antioxidant response (ARE binding, HMOX1 mRNA levels) was detected 6 h after heat shock; in HSF1 K80Q cells this response was delayed to 24 h and the ARE complex had a different mobility. Inactivation of HSF1 thus affects the timing and nature of the antioxidant response and NRF2 can activate at least some HSF1 target genes in the absence of HSF1 activity.

Abstract: Hsp27 belongs to the small heat shock protein family, which are ATP-independent chaperones. The most important function of Hsp27 is based on its ability to bind non-native proteins and inhibit the aggregation of incorrectly folded proteins maintaining them in a refolding-competent state. Additionally, it has anti-apoptotic and antioxidant activities. To study the effect of Hsp27 on memory and synaptic functions, amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation, and neurodegeneration, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing human Hsp27 protein and crossed with APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse strain, a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using different behavioral tests, we found that spatial learning was impaired in AD model mice and was rescued by Hsp27 overexpression. Electrophysiological recordings have revealed that excitability of neurons was significantly increased, and long-term potentiation (LTP) was impaired in AD model mice, whereas they were normalized in Hsp27 overexpressing AD model mice. Using anti-amyloid antibody, we counted significantly less amyloid plaques in the brain of APPswe/PS1dE9/Hsp27 animals compared to AD model mice. These results suggest that overexpression of Hsp27 protein might ameliorate certain symptoms of AD.

Abstract: Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can proliferate indefinitely in vitro and differentiate into cells of all three germ layers. These unique properties make them exceptionally valuable for drug discovery and regenerative medicine. However, the practical application of ESCs is limited because it is difficult to derive and culture ESCs. It has been demonstrated that CHIR99021 (CHIR) promotes self-renewal and enhances the derivation efficiency of mouse (m)ESCs. However, the downstream targets of CHIR are not fully understood. In this study, we identified CHIR-regulated genes in mESCs using microarray analysis. Our microarray data demonstrated that CHIR not only influenced the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by stabilizing β-catenin, but also modulated several other pluripotency-related signaling pathways such as TGF-β, Notch and MAPK signaling pathways. More detailed analysis demonstrated that CHIR inhibited Nodal signaling, while activating bone morphogenetic protein signaling in mESCs. In addition, we found that pluripotency-maintaining transcription factors were up-regulated by CHIR, while several developmental-related genes were down-regulated. Furthermore, we found that CHIR altered the expression of epigenetic regulatory genes and long intergenic non-coding RNAs. Quantitative real-time PCR results were consistent with microarray data, suggesting that CHIR alters the expression pattern of protein-encoding genes (especially transcription factors), epigenetic regulatory genes and non-coding RNAs to establish a relatively stable pluripotency-maintaining network.

Abstract: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a disease of the heart muscle characterized by cardiac chamber enlargement and reduced systolic function of the left ventricle. Mutations in the LMNA gene represent the most frequent known genetic cause of DCM associated with disease of the conduction systems. The LMNA gene generates two major transcripts encoding the nuclear lamina major components lamin A and lamin C by alternative splicing. Both haploinsuffiency and dominant negative effects have been proposed as disease mechanism for premature termination codon (PTC) mutations in LMNA. These mechanisms however are still not clearly established. In this study, we used a representative LMNA nonsense mutation, p.Arg321Ter, to shed light on the molecular disease mechanisms. Cultured fibroblasts from three DCM patients carrying this mutation were analyzed. Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR and sequencing of these PCR products indicated that transcripts from the mutant allele were degraded by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) mechanism. The fact that no truncated mutant protein was detectable in western blot (WB) analysis strengthens the notion that the mutant transcript is efficiently degraded. Furthermore, WB analysis showed that the expression of lamin C protein was reduced by the expected approximately 50%. Clearly decreased lamin A and lamin C levels were also observed by immunofluorescence microscopy analysis. However, results from both WB and nano-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry demonstrated that the levels of lamin A protein were more reduced suggesting an effect on expression of lamin A from the wild type allele. PCR analysis of the ratio of lamin A to lamin C transcripts showed unchanged relative amounts of lamin A transcript suggesting that the effect on the wild type allele was operative at the protein level. Immunofluorescence microscopy analysis showed no abnormal nuclear morphology of patient fibroblast cells. Based on these data, we propose that heterozygosity for the nonsense mutation causes NMD degradation of the mutant transcripts blocking expression of the truncated mutant protein and an additional trans effect on lamin A protein levels expressed from the wild type allele. We discuss the possibility that skewing of the lamin A to lamin C ratio may contribute to ensuing processes that destabilize cardiomyocytes and trigger cardiomyopathy

Abstract: Heat shock proteins (HSP) are highly conserved across eukaryotic and prokaryotic species. These proteins play a role in response to cellular stressors, protecting cells from damage and facilitating recovery. In tumor cells, HSPs can have cytoprotective effects and interfere with apoptotic cascades. This study was performed to assess the prognostic and predictive values of the gene expression of HSP family members in canine osteosarcoma (OS) and their potential for targeted therapy. Gene expressions for HSP were assessed using quantitative PCR (qPCR) on 58 snap-frozen primary canine OS tumors and related to clinic-pathological parameters. A significant increased expression of HSP60 was found in relation to shorter overall survival and an osteoblastic phenotype. Therefore, the function of HSP60 was investigated in more detail. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed heterogeneous staining for HSP60 in tumors. The highest immunoreactivity was found in tumors of short surviving dogs. Next HSP expression was shown in a variety of canine and human OS cell lines by qPCR and Western blot. In two highly metastatic cell lines HSP60 expression was silenced using siRNA resulting in decreased cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in both cell lines. It is concluded that overexpression of HSP60 is associated with a poor prognosis of OS and should be evaluated as a new target for therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Development of the hematopoietic system proceeds in a multistep manner. Primitive erythrocytes are the first hematopoietic cells to be observed that were produced transiently in developing embryos. Multilineage lymphohematopoiesis occurs after the primitive erythropoiesis. However, the lineage relationship of cells that comprise embryonic hematopoietic system is not well characterized. To clarify this process, careful analyses of the embryonic cells that differentiate into these cell lineages are necessary. We identified the common precursors of primitive erythrocytes and multipotent hematopoietic cells in mouse embryonic stem cell cultures and mouse embryos. A subset defined as CD45−CD41+AA4.1− cells showed bipotential capability to produce primitive erythrocytes and lymphomyeloid cells at the single-cell level. The cell population was present in vivo before hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) appeared. Our results show that primitive erythrocytes and lymphomyeloid cells are not completely separate cell lineages, and these precursors comprise the embryonic hematopoietic system before HSC emergence.

Abstract: Summary
The EGF-stimulated ERK/MAPK pathway is a key conduit for cellular proliferation signals and a therapeutic target in many cancers. Here, we characterize two central quantitative aspects of this pathway: the mechanism by which signal strength is encoded and the response curve relating signal output to proliferation. Under steady-state conditions, we find that ERK is activated in discrete, asynchronous pulses with frequency and duration determined by extracellular concentrations of EGF spanning the physiological range. In genetically identical sister cells, cell-to-cell variability in pulse dynamics influences the decision to enter S phase. While targeted inhibition of EGFR reduces the frequency of ERK activity pulses, inhibition of MEK reduces their amplitude. Continuous response curves measured in multiple cell lines reveal that proliferation is effectively silenced only when ERK pathway output falls below a threshold of ∼10%, indicating that high-dose targeting of the pathway is necessary to achieve therapeutic efficacy.

Abstract: Background
Notch ligands enhance ex vivo expansion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). But to use Notch ligands in HSC therapies of human diseases, efforts are required to improve ex vivo expansion efficiency and in vivo transplant engraftment.
Design and methods
We designed and produced an endothelium-targeted soluble Notch ligand, the DSL domain of Delta-like 1 fused with a RGD motif (D1R), and examined the effects of this protein on HSCs ex vivo and in vivo.
Results
D1R efficiently promoted ex vivo expansion of both mouse bone marrow (BM) and human umbilical cord blood HSCs. HSCs expanded with D1R up-regulated many of the stemness-related genes, and showed high BM engraftment efficacy with long-term repopulation capacity after transplantation. Moreover, in vivo administration of D1R increased the number of BM HSCs in mice, and facilitated BM recovery of mice after irradiation. Injection of D1R significantly improved HSC engraftment and myeloid recovery after BM transplantation in irradiated mice. D1R enhanced HSC engraftment not only in BM, but also in the liver and spleen after BM transplantation in mice. D1R induced the formation of compact cell clusters containing the transplanted HSCs in close contact with endothelial cells, reminiscent of HSC niches, in the liver and spleen.
Conclusions
D1R might be applied in improving both HSC expansion ex vivo and HSC engraftment in vivo in transplantation.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and type 1 interferon (T1-IFN) signaling are innate immune mechanisms activated upon viral infection. However, the role of NF-κB and its interplay with T1-IFN in antiviral immunity is poorly understood. We show that NF-κB is essential for resistance to ectromelia virus (ECTV), a mouse orthopoxvirus related to the virus causing human smallpox. Additionally, an ECTV mutant lacking an NF-κB inhibitor activates NF-κB more effectively in vivo, resulting in increased proinflammatory molecule transcription in uninfected cells and organs and decreased viral replication. Unexpectedly, NF-κB activation compensates for genetic defects in the T1-IFN pathway, such as a deficiency in the IRF7 transcription factor, resulting in virus control. Thus, overlap between the T1-IFN and NF-κB pathways allows the host to overcome genetic or pathogen-induced deficiencies in T1-IFN and survive an otherwise lethal poxvirus infection. These findings may also explain why some pathogens target both pathways to cause disease.

Abstract: In addition to potent anticancer effects of selenite, a modest therapeutic effect of sodium selenate has been demonstrated in prostate cancer patients. Selenate acts by activating protein phosphatase 2A, which inhibits various signal transduction cascades, including the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway. The human colorectal carcinoma cell line DLD-1 harbors a constitutive active mutation in PIK3CA encoding the PI3K p110α catalytic subunit. Thus, we examined the anticancer effect of sodium selenate in DLD-1 cells. As expected, selenate significantly decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis at a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.88mM, whereas selenite was much more potent at an IC50 of 0.0061mM. Surprisingly, at lower concentrations (0.04–0.16mM), selenate induced changes in cell morphology and motility that are characteristic of the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). Moreover, selenate-induced EMT was associated with AKT activation, increased expression of the EMT-inducing transcription factor TWIST1 and the mesenchymal cell-specific intermediate filament vimentin, and decreased expression of the epithelial cell-specific adhesion molecule E-cadherin. The critical role of AKT activation in selenate-induced EMT was identified using the AKT inhibitor Akti-1/2, which suppressed EMT-associated cell motility and invasion. These results suggest that although sodium selenate is a potential anticancer drug, deleterious effects of EMT induction should be taken into careful consideration.

Abstract: The activation of Akt has been proved to involve in the lipogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. However, it's still not clear whether mTOR, another main gene in PI3K/Akt pathway, is also involved in the renal lipogenesis of diabetes. In the present study, it was revealed that the phosphorylation of mTOR was up-regulated in the renal tubular cells of diabetic rats, followed by the over-expression of SREBP-1, ADRP and lipogenesis. Again, high glucose increased the expression of phospho-mTOR accompanied with SREBP-1 and ADRP up-regulation and lipid accumulation in HKC cells. Rapamycin, known as mTOR inhibitor, was used to inhibit the activation of mTOR, which prevented effectively high glucose-induced SREBP-1 up-regulation and lipogenesis in HKC cells. Furthermore, high glucose-stimulated HKC cells transfected with wild-type mTOR vector showed the enhanced SREBP-1 and lipid droplets, however, TE mTOR vector (kinase dead)-transfected HKC cells presented resistance to high glucose and decreased SREBP-1 expression and lipogenesis. These above data suggested that phospho-mTOR mediated lipid accumulation in renal tubular cells of diabetes and might be the potential targets for treating lipogenesis of diabetic nephropathy.

Abstract: Summary
Osteomyelitis is a common manifestation of invasive Staphylococcus aureus infection. Pathogen-induced bone destruction limits antimicrobial penetration to the infectious focus and compromises treatment of osteomyelitis. To investigate mechanisms of S. aureus-induced bone destruction, we developed a murine model of osteomyelitis. Microcomputed tomography of infected femurs revealed that S. aureus triggers profound alterations in bone turnover. The bacterial regulatory locus sae was found to be critical for osteomyelitis pathogenesis, as Sae-regulated factors promote pathologic bone remodeling and intraosseous bacterial survival. Exoproteome analyses revealed the Sae-regulated protease aureolysin as a major determinant of the S. aureus secretome and identified the phenol-soluble modulins as aureolysin-degraded, osteolytic peptides that trigger osteoblast cell death and bone destruction. These studies establish a murine model for pathogen-induced bone remodeling, define Sae as critical for osteomyelitis pathogenesis, and identify protease-dependent exoproteome remodeling as a major determinant of the staphylococcal virulence repertoire.

Abstract: Summary
Cholesterol is a critical component of cellular membranes, regulating assembly and function of membrane-based protein/lipid complexes. Many RNA viruses, including enteroviruses, remodel host membranes to generate organelles with unique lipid blueprints on which they assemble replication complexes and synthesize viral RNA. Here we find that clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is harnessed by enteroviruses to traffic cholesterol from the plasma membrane (PM) and extracellular medium to replication organelles, where cholesterol then regulates viral polyprotein processing and facilitates genome synthesis. When CME is disrupted, cellular cholesterol pools are instead stored in lipid droplets, cholesterol cannot be trafficked to replication organelles, and replication is inhibited. In contrast, replication is stimulated in cholesterol-elevated cells like those lacking caveolins or those from Niemann-Pick disease patients. Our findings indicate cholesterol as a critical determinant for enteroviral replication and outline roles for the endocytic machinery in both the enteroviral life cycle and host cell cholesterol homeostasis.

Abstract: We have shown previously that mitochondrial ROS production is essential to turn growth factor (GF) removal into cell death. Activated RAF, AKT, Bcl-2 and antioxidants protected equally well against ROS accumulation and subsequent death. Here we investigated whether protection by survival signaling and antioxidants utilizes shared or distinct targets. Using serum deprivation from NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and IL-3 withdrawal from promyeloid 32D cells, we showed that pro-survival signaling by activated RAF but not AKT prevented the decline in Mcl-1 following GF abrogation. GF starvation increased levels of Bim in both model systems, which was prevented by RAF in 32D cells but not in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. RAF and AKT suppressed activation and mitochondrial translocation of BAX. Also, antioxidant treatment efficiently prevented BAX activation and death of 32D cells but showed little effect on its mitochondrial translocation. No significant impact of antioxidant treatment on Bim or Mcl-1 expression was observed. ROS produced during GF abrogation also did not alter the activity of intracellular signaling pathways, which have been implicated previously in cell killing by pro-oxidants. Together these data suggest Bcl-2 family proteins as convergence point for RAF and ROS in life and death decisions.

Abstract: Protein folding and disaggregation are crucial processes for survival of cells under unfavorable conditions. A network of molecular chaperones supports these processes. Collaborative action of Hsp70 and Hsp100 proteins is an important component of this network. J-proteins/DnaJ members as co-chaperones assist Hsp70. As against 22 DnaJ sequences noted in yeast, rice genome contains 104 J-genes. Rice J-genes were systematically classified into type A (12 sequences), type B (9 sequences), and type C (83 sequences) classes and a scheme of nomenclature of these proteins is proposed. Transcript expression profiles revealed that J-proteins are possibly involved in basal cellular activities, developmental programs, and in stress. Ydj1 is the most abundant J-protein in yeast. Ydj1 deleted yeast cells are nonviable at 37 °C. Two rice ortholog proteins of yeast Ydj1 protein namely OsDjA4 and OsDjA5 successfully rescued the growth defect in mutant yeast. As Hsp70 and J-proteins work in conjunction, it emerges that rice J-proteins can partner with yeast Hsp70 proteins in functioning. It is thus shown that J-protein machine is highly conserved.

Abstract: In the present study, we examined the effect of the over-expression of LMNA, or its mutant form progerin (PG), on the mesoderm differentiation potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from human umbilical cord (UC) stroma using a recently described differentiation model employing spheroid formation. Accumulation of lamin A (LMNA) was previously associated with the osteoarthritis (OA) chondrocyte phenotype. Mutations of this protein are linked to laminopathies and specifically to Hutchinson–Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS), an accelerated aging disease. Some authors have proposed that a deregulation of LMNA affects the differentiation potential of stem cells. The chondrogenic potential is defective in PG-MSCs, although both PG and LMNA transduced MSCs, have an increase in hypertrophy markers during chondrogenic differentiation. Furthermore, both PG and LMNA-MSCs showed a decrease in manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSODM), an increase of mitochondrial MnSODM-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) and alterations in their migration capacity. Finally, defects in chondrogenesis are partially reversed by periodic incubation with ROS-scavenger agent that mimics MnSODM effect. Our results indicate that over-expression of LMNA or PG by lentiviral gene delivery leads to defects in chondrogenic differentiation potential partially due to an imbalance in oxidative stress.

Abstract: Orosomucoid 1 (ORM1), also named Alpha 1 acid glycoprotein A (AGP-A), is an abundant plasma protein characterized by anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating properties. The present study was designed to identify a possible correlation between ORM1 and Vitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), a hormone exerting a widespread effect on cell proliferation, differentiation and regulation of the immune system. In particular, the data described here indicated that ORM1 is a 1,25(OH)2D3 primary response gene, characterized by the presence of a VDRE element inside the 1kb sequence of its proximal promoter region. This finding was demonstrated with gene expression studies, Chromatin Immunoprecipitation and luciferase transactivation experiments and confirmed by VDR full length and dominant negative over-expression. In addition, several experiments carried out in human normal monocytes demonstrated that the 1,25(OH)2D3 – VDR – ORM1 pathway plays a functional role inside the macrophage de-activation process and that ORM1 may be considered as a signaling molecule involved in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis and remodeling.

Abstract: Our work aimed at evaluating the role of adipose stem cells (ASC) on chondrocytes from osteoarthritic (OA) patients and identifying the mediators involved. We used primary chondrocytes, ASCs from different sources and bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) from OA donors. ASCs or MSCs were co-cultured with chondrocytes in a minimal medium and using cell culture inserts. Under these conditions, ASCs did not affect the proliferation of chondrocytes but significantly decreased camptothecin-induced apoptosis. Both MSCs and ASCs from different sources allowed chondrocytes in the cocultures maintaining a stable expression of markers specific for a mature phenotype, while expression of hypertrophic and fibrotic markers was decreased. A number of factors known to regulate the chondrocyte phenotype (IL-1β, IL-1RA, TNF-α) and matrix remodeling (TIMP-1 and -2, MMP-1 and -9, TSP-1) were not affected. However, a significant decrease of TGF-β1 secretion by chondrocytes and induction of HGF secretion by ASCs was observed. Addition of a neutralizing anti-HGF antibody reversed the anti-fibrotic effect of ASCs whereas hypertrophic markers were not modulated. In summary, ASCs are an interesting source of stem cells for efficiently reducing hypertrophy and dedifferentiation of chondrocytes, at least partly via the secretion of HGF. This supports the interest of using these cells in therapies for osteo-articular diseases.

Abstract: Cell migration and invasion are essential processes in a variety of physiological events in the body, but also in several patho-physiological events. In this paper, the behavior of murine and human embryonic stem cells is examined in in vitro migration and invasion models. mESC and hESC were applied as spheroids, also known as patches, and as single cells, to mimic possible cell therapy application strategies. Two known in vitro migration assays, the ECM (extracellular matrix) assay and the Boyden chamber migration assay were selected. These assays revealed that mESC are statistically significantly more infiltrative than hESC. Application as spheroid results in a slightly higher infiltrative capacity compared single cells. The PHF (precultured chick heart fragment) assay was selected as an invasion assay. In the PHF assay a more 3D examination of the infiltrative nature of the ESC can be observed. The mESC showed infiltrative behavior, as spheroids and as single cells. The hESC were infiltrative as single cells but not as spheroids. The results of these assays are mostly complementary and prove the applicability of these assays, which were originally applied in tumor biology, in migratory behavior studies regarding stem cells and their progeny in basic and other conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are multilineage progenitors with immunomodulatory properties, including expansion of immunomodulatory leukocytes such as regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs) and tolerogenic dendritic cells. We report that human MSCs can expand CD14−CD11b+CD33+ human myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). MSC-expanded MDSCs suppress allogeneic lymphocyte proliferation, express arginase-1 and inducible nitric oxide synthase, and increase the number of Tregs. This expansion occurs through the secretion of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), with effects replicated by adding HGF singly and abrogated by HGF knockdown in MSCs. In wild-type mice, the liver, which secretes high levels of HGF, contains high numbers of Gr-1+CD11b+ MDSCs, and injection of HGF into mice significantly increases the number of MDSCs. Expansion of MDSCs by MSC-secreted HGF involves c-Met (its receptor) and downstream phosphorylation of STAT3, a key factor in MDSC expansion. Our data further support the strong immunomodulatory nature of MSCs and demonstrate the role of HGF, a mitogenic molecule, in the expansion of MDSCs.

Abstract: Adipocyte stem cells (hASCs) can proliferate and self-renew and, due to their multipotent nature, they can differentiate into several tissue-specific lineages, making them ideal candidates for use in cell therapy. Most attempts to determine the mRNA profile of self-renewing or differentiating stem cells have made use of total RNA for gene expression analysis. Several lines of evidence suggest that self-renewal and differentiation are also dependent on the control of protein synthesis by posttranscriptional mechanisms. We used adipogenic differentiation as a model, to investigate the extent to which posttranscriptional regulation controlled gene expression in hASCs. We focused on the initial steps of differentiation and isolated both the total mRNA fraction and the subpopulation of mRNAs associated with translating ribosomes. We observed that adipogenesis is committed in the first days of induction and three days appears as the minimum time of induction necessary for efficient differentiation. RNA-seq analysis showed that a significant percentage of regulated mRNAs were posttranscriptionally controlled. Part of this regulation involves massive changes in transcript untranslated regions (UTR) length, with differential extension/reduction of the 3′UTR after induction. A slight correlation can be observed between the expression levels of differentially expressed genes and the 3′UTR length. When we considered association to polysomes, this correlation values increased. Changes in the half lives were related to the extension of the 3′UTR, with longer UTRs mainly stabilizing the transcripts. Thus, changes in the length of these extensions may be associated with changes in the ability to associate with polysomes or in half-life.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a reliable resource for tissue regeneration, but the molecular mechanism underlying directed differentiation remains unclear; this has restricted potential MSC applications. The histone demethylase, lysine (K)-specific demethylase 2A (KDM2A), is evolutionarily conserved and ubiquitously expressed members of the JmjC-domain-containing histone demethylase family. A previous study determined that KDM2A can regulate the cell proliferation and osteo/dentinogenic differentiation of MSCs. It is not known whether KDM2A is involved in the other cell lineages differentiation of MSCs. Here, we show that depletion of KDM2A by short hairpin RNAs can enhance adipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation potentials in human stem cells from apical papilla (SCAPs). We found that the stemness-related genes, SOX2, and the embryonic stem cell master transcription factor, NANOG were significantly increased after silence of KDM2A in SCAPs. Moreover, we found that knock-down of the KDM2A co-factor, BCOR also up-regulated the mRNA levels of SOX2 and NANOG. Furthermore, Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that silence of KDM2A increased the histone H3 Lysine 4 (H3K4) trimethylation in the SOX2 and NANOG locus and regulates its expression. In conclusion, our results suggested that depletion of KDM2A enhanced the adipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation potentials of SCAPs by up-regulated SOX2 and NANOG, BCOR also involved in this regulation as co-factor, and provided useful information to understand the molecular mechanism underlying directed differentiation in MSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS), a component of the translation apparatus, is released from the cytoplasmic multi-tRNA synthetase complex (MSC) to activate the transcription factor MITF in stimulated mast cells through undefined mechanisms. Here we show that Ser207 phosphorylation provokes a new conformer of LysRS that inactivates its translational function but activates its transcriptional function. The crystal structure of an MSC subcomplex established that LysRS is held in the MSC by binding to the N terminus of the scaffold protein p38/AIMP2. Phosphorylation-created steric clashes at the LysRS domain interface disrupt its binding grooves for p38/AIMP2, releasing LysRS and provoking its nuclear translocation. This alteration also exposes the C-terminal domain of LysRS to bind to MITF and triggers LysRS-directed production of the second messenger Ap4A that activates MITF. Thus our results establish that a single conformational change triggered by phosphorylation leads to multiple effects driving an exclusive switch of LysRS function from translation to transcription.

Abstract: Breast cancer progression is associated with loss of estrogen receptor (ER-α), often due to epigenetic silencing. IGFBP genes have consistently been identified among the most common to be aberrantly methylated in tumours. To understand the impact of losing IGFBP-3 tumour expression via DNA methylation, we treated four breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, T47D, Hs578T and MDA-MB-231) with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine (AZA) to determine IGFBP-3's role in the effects of AZA on total cell number and survival relative to changes in the ER. AZA induced cell growth inhibition, death and a reduction in the formation of colonies, despite increasing ER-α expression in ER-negative cells but reducing ER-α in ER-positive cells. Regardless of the differential effects on the ER-α, AZA consistently increased the abundance of IGFBP-3 and negating this increase in IGFBP-3 with siRNA reduced the AZA-induced growth inhibition and induction of cell death and virtually negated the AZA-induced inhibition of colony formation. With ER-α positive cells AZA increased the abundance of the tumour suppressor gene, p53 and induced demethylation of the IGFBP-3 promoter, whereas with ER negative cells, AZA epigenetically increased the transcription factor AP2-α, which when silenced prevented the increase in IGFBP-3. IGFBP-3 plays an important role in the anti-tumorigenic effects of AZA on breast cancer cells.

Abstract: Despite many advantages of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that make them suitable for cell therapy purposes, their therapeutic application has been limited due to their susceptibility to several stresses (e.g., nutrient-poor environment, oxidative stress, and hypoxic and masses of cytotoxic factors) to which they are exposed during their preparation and following transplantation. Hence, reinforcing MSCs against these stresses is a challenge for both basic and clinician scientists. Recently, much attention has been directed toward equipping MSCs with cytoprotective factors to strengthen them against unfavorable microenvironments. Here, we engineered MSCs with lipocalin 2 (Lcn2), a cytoprotective factor that is naturally induced following exposure of cells to stresses imposed by the microenvironment. Lcn2 overexpression not only did not interfere with the multidifferentiation capacity of the MSCs but also granted many protective properties to them. Lcn2 potentiated MSCs to withstand oxidative, hypoxia, and serum deprivation (SD) conditions via antagonizing their induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis. Adhesion rate of MSCs to coated culture plates was also enhanced by Lcn2 overexpression. In addition, Lcn2 induced antioxidants and upregulated some growth factors in MSCs. Our findings suggested a new strategy for prevention of graft cell death in MSC-based cell therapy.

Abstract: Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) facilitate the angiogenic response of endothelial cells (ECs) within three-dimensional (3D) matrices in vivo and in engineered tissues in vitro in part through paracrine mediators and by acting as stabilizing pericytes. However, the molecular interactions between BMSCs and nascent tubules during the process of angiogenesis are not fully understood. In this study, we have used a tractable 3D co-culture model to explore the functional role of the α6β1 integrin adhesion receptor on BMSCs in sprouting angiogenesis. We report that knockdown of the α6 integrin subunit in BMSCs significantly reduces capillary sprouting, and causes their failure to associate with the nascent vessels. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the BMSCs with attenuated α6 integrin proliferate at a significantly lower rate relative to either control cells expressing non-targeting shRNA or wild type BMSCs; however, despite adding more cells to compensate for this deficit in proliferation, deficient sprouting persists. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that the α6 integrin subunit in BMSCs is important for their ability to stimulate vessel morphogenesis. This conclusion may have important implications in the optimization of cell-based strategies to promote angiogenesis.

Abstract: Fibronectin is a major extracellular matrix glycoprotein with several alternatively spliced variants, including extra domain A (EDA), which was demonstrated to promote tumorigenesis via stimulating angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. Given that CD133+/CD44+ cancer cells are critical in tumorigenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC), we hypothesize that fibronectin EDA may promote tumorigenesis by sustaining the properties of CD133+/CD44+ colon cancer cells. We found that tumor tissue and serum EDA levels are substantially higher in advanced versus early stage human CRC. Additionally we showed that tumor tissue EDA levels are positively correlated with differentiation status and chemoresistance, and correlated with a poor prognosis of CRC patients. We also showed that in colon cancer cells SW480, CD133+/CD44+ versus CD133−/CD44− cells express significantly elevated EDA receptor integrin α9β1. Silencing EDA in SW480 cells reduces spheroid formation and cells positive for CD133 or CD44, which is associated with reduced expressions of embryonic stem cell markers and increased expressions of differentiation markers. Blocking integrin α9β1 function strongly reversed the effect of EDA overexpression. We also provided evidence suggesting that EDA sustains Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity via activating integrin/FAK/ERK pathway. In xenograft models, EDA-silenced SW480 cells exhibit reduced tumorigenic and metastatic capacity. In conclusion, EDA is essential for the maintenance of the properties of CD133+/CD44+ colon cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
Bacterial transcriptional networks consist of hundreds of transcription factors and thousands of promoters. However, the true complexity of transcription in a bacterial pathogen and the effect of the environments encountered during infection remain to be established. We present a simplified approach for global promoter identification in bacteria using RNA-seq-based transcriptomic analyses of 22 distinct infection-relevant environmental conditions. Individual RNA samples were combined to identify most of the 3,838 Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium promoters in just two RNA-seq runs. Individual in vitro conditions stimulated characteristic transcriptional signatures, and the suite of 22 conditions induced transcription of 86% of all S. Typhimurium genes. We highlight the environmental conditions that induce the Salmonella pathogenicity islands and present a small RNA expression landscape of 280 sRNAs. This publicly available compendium of environmentally controlled expression of every transcriptional feature of S. Typhimurium constitutes a useful resource for the bacterial research community.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear bodies (NBs), characterized by the presence of the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein, are important components of the nuclear architecture, contributing to genetic and epigenetic control of gene expression. In investigating the mechanisms mediating HIV-1 latency, we determined that silenced but transcriptionally competent HIV-1 proviruses reside in close proximity to PML NBs and that this association inhibits HIV-1 gene expression. PML binds to the latent HIV-1 promoter, which coincides with transcriptionally inactive facultative heterochromatic marks, notably H3K9me2, at the viral genome. PML degradation and NB disruption result in strong activation of viral transcription as well as release of G9a, the major methyltransferase responsible for H3K9me2, and loss of facultative heterochromatin marks from the proviral DNA. Additionally, HIV-1 transcriptional activation requires proviral displacement from PML NBs by active nuclear actin polymerization. Thus, nuclear topology and active gene movement mediate HIV-1 transcriptional regulation and have implications for controlling HIV-1 latency and eradication.

Abstract: In a recent study, we have shown that in mammary tumors from mice lacking the Cav-1 gene, there are alterations in specific heat shock proteins as well as in tumor development. With this in mind, we have now investigated other proteins in the same mammary mouse tumor model (Her-2/neu expressing mammary tumors from Cav-1 wild type and Cav-1 null mice), to further comprehend the complex tumor-stroma mechanisms involved in regulating stress responses during tumor development. In this tumor model the cancer cells always lacked of Cav-1, so the KO influenced the Cav-1 in the stroma. By immunohistochemistry, we have found a striking co-expression of β-catenin and Her-2/neu in the tumor cells. The absence of Cav-1 in the tumor stroma had no effect on expression or localization of β-catenin and Her-2/neu. Both proteins appeared co-localized at the cell surface during tumor development and progression. Since Her-2/neu activation induces MTA1, we next evaluated MTA1 in the mouse tumors. Although this protein was found in numerous nuclei, the absence of Cav-1 did not alter its expression level. In contrast, significantly more PTEN protein was noted in the tumors lacking Cav-1 in the stroma, with the protein localized mainly in the nuclei. P-Akt levels were relatively low in tumors from both Cav-1 WT and Cav-1 KO mice. There was also an increase in nuclear NHERF1 expression levels in the tumors arising from Cav-1 KO mice. The data obtained in the MMTV-neu model are consistent with a role for Cav-1 in adjacent breast cancer stromal cells in modulating the expression and localization of important proteins implicated in tumor cell behavior.

Insulin suppresses distal-less homeobox 5 expression through the up-regulation of microRNA-124 in 3T3-L1 cells,

Abstract: Distal-less homeobox 5 (Dlx5) is a pro-osteogenic but anti-adipogenic transcription factor that regulates lineage commitment in mesenchymal stem cells. Although the expression of Dlx5 is known to be decreased by adipogenic stimuli, the mechanism of Dlx5 down-regulation has not yet been clarified. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small regulatory RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate many biological functions, including cell differentiation. In this study, we examined whether miRNAs are involved in down-regulation of Dlx5 following adipogenic stimuli. We screened candidate miRNAs that have a direct target site in the Dlx5 3′UTR using computational prediction programs, selected seven miRNA candidates with the highest binding score and observed their expression levels in 3T3-L1 murine pre-adipocytes. Among the miRNAs examined, only miR-124 was significantly up-regulated by 24-h incubation in adipogenic medium. Among the four components of adipogenic stimuli (1-methy-3-isobutyl xanthine, insulin, indomethacin and dexamethasone), insulin exhibited the highest stimulatory effect on miR-124 expression. Insulin significantly increased the expression of miR-124 precursors including pri-miR-124-1, pri-miR124-2 and pri-miR-124-3. LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, prevented the regulatory effect of insulin on the expression levels of miR-124 and Dlx5. Over-expression of a miR-124 mimic decreased the expression of Dlx5 while increasing adipogenic differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells. Blocking miR-124 with anti-miR-124, a hairpin inhibitor of miR-124, increased the expression level of Dlx5 and suppressed adipogenic differentiation. When reporter assays were performed with a reporter construct containing the Dlx5 3′UTR sequence downstream of a luciferase gene, miR-124 mimic suppressed, but anti-miR-124 enhanced, luciferase activity in an miR-124 binding site-dependent manner. These results suggest that insulin-induced miR-124 plays a pivotal role in post-transcriptional regulation of Dlx5 during adipogenic differentiation and that miR-124 exerts pro-adipogenic effects by targeting Dlx5, at least in part.

Abstract: Despite improved treatment options, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains the most aggressive brain tumour with the shortest post-diagnostic survival. Arsenite (As2O3) is already being used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL), yet its effects on GBM have not been evaluated in detail. In U87MG cell monolayers, we have previously shown that arsenite cytotoxicity significantly increases upon transient inhibition of lysosomal protease Cathepsin L (CatL). As multicellular spheroids more closely represent in vivo tumours, we aimed to evaluate the impact of permanent CatL silencing on arsenite treatment in U87MG spheroids. CatL was stably silenced using shRNA expression plasmid packed lentiviruses. By using metabolic- and cell viability assays, we demonstrated that long-term CatL silencing significantly increased arsenite cytotoxicity in U87MG spheroids. Silenced CatL also increased arsenite-mediated apoptosis in spheroids via elevated p53 expression, Bax/Bcl2 ratio and caspase 3/7 activity, though with lower efficacy than in monolayers. Arsenite cytotoxicity was enhanced by lower CatL activity, since similar cytotoxicity increase was also observed using the novel CatL inhibitor AT094. The results have significant translational impact, since stable CatL silencing would enable the application of lower systemic doses of arsenite to achieve the desired cytotoxic effects on GBMs in vivo.

Abstract: The outcomes of clinical trials using bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) are variable; the degree of the expansion of BMSCs during clinical manufacturing may contribute to this variability since cell expansion is limited by senescence. Human BMSCs from aspirates of healthy subjects were subcultured serially until cell growth stopped. Phenotype and functional measurements of BMSCs from two subjects including senescence-associated beta-galactosidase staining and colony formation efficiency changed from an early to a senescence pattern at passage 6 or 7. Transcriptome analysis of 10 early and 15 late passage BMSC samples from 5 subjects revealed 2122 differentially expressed genes, which were associated with immune response, development, and cell proliferation pathways. Analysis of 57 serial BMSC samples from 7 donors revealed that the change from an early to senescent profile was variable among subjects and occurred prior to changes in phenotypes. BMSC age expressed as a percentage of maximum population doublings (PDs) was a good indicator for an early or senescence transcription signature but this measure of BMSC life span can only be calculated after expanding BMSCs to senescence. In order to find a more useful surrogate measure of BMSC age, we used a computational biology approach to identify a set of genes whose expression at each passage would predict elapsed age of BMSCs. A total of 155 genes were highly correlated with BMSC age. A least angle regression algorithm identified a set of 24 BMSC age-predictive genes. In conclusion, the onset of senescence-associated molecular changes was variable and preceded changes in other indicators of BMSC quality and senescence. The 24 BMSC age predictive genes will be useful in assessing the quality of clinical BMSC products.

Abstract: Summary
The establishment of self-renewing hepatoblast-like cells (HBCs) from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) would realize a stable supply of hepatocyte-like cells for medical applications. However, the functional characterization of human PSC-derived HBCs was not enough. To purify and expand human PSC-derived HBCs, human PSC-derived HBCs were cultured on dishes coated with various types of human recombinant laminins (LN). Human PSC-derived HBCs attached to human laminin-111 (LN111)-coated dish via integrin alpha 6 and beta 1 and were purified and expanded by culturing on the LN111-coated dish, but not by culturing on dishes coated with other laminin isoforms. By culturing on the LN111-coated dish, human PSC-derived HBCs were maintained for more than 3 months and had the ability to differentiate into both hepatocyte-like cells and cholangiocyte-like cells. These expandable human PSC-derived HBCs would be manageable tools for drug screening, experimental platforms to elucidate mechanisms of hepatoblasts, and cell sources for hepatic regenerative therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Dengue is the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral disease in humans, and the lack of early prognostics, vaccines, and therapeutics contributes to immense disease burden. To identify patterns that could be used for sequence-based monitoring of the antibody response to dengue, we examined antibody heavy-chain gene rearrangements in longitudinal peripheral blood samples from 60 dengue patients. Comparing signatures between acute dengue, postrecovery, and healthy samples, we found increased expansion of B cell clones in acute dengue patients, with higher overall clonality in secondary infection. Additionally, we observed consistent antibody sequence features in acute dengue in the highly variable major antigen-binding determinant, complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3), with specific CDR3 sequences highly enriched in acute samples compared to postrecovery, healthy, or non-dengue samples. Dengue thus provides a striking example of a human viral infection where convergent immune signatures can be identified in multiple individuals. Such signatures could facilitate surveillance of immunological memory in communities.

Abstract: Summary
Recent advances enabling the cloning of human immunoglobulin G genes have proven effective for discovering monoclonal antibodies with therapeutic potential. However, these antibody-discovery methods are often arduous and identify only a few candidates from numerous antibody-secreting plasma cells or plasmablasts. We describe an in vivo enrichment technique that identifies broadly neutralizing human antibodies with high frequency. For this technique, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from vaccinated donors are activated and enriched in an antigen-specific manner for the production of numerous antigen-specific plasmablasts. Using this technology, we identified four broadly neutralizing influenza A antibodies by screening only 840 human antibodies. Two of these antibodies neutralize every influenza A human isolate tested and perform better than the current anti-influenza A therapeutic, oseltamivir, in treating severe influenza infection in mice and ferrets. Furthermore, these antibodies elicit robust in vivo synergism when combined with oseltamivir, thus highlighting treatment strategies that could benefit influenza-infected patients.

Abstract: Summary
Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), which conventionally are isolated based on their adherence to plastic, are heterogeneous and have poor growth and differentiation, limiting our ability to investigate their intrinsic characteristics. We report an improved prospective clonal isolation technique and reveal that the combination of three cell-surface markers (LNGFR, THY-1, and VCAM-1) allows for the selection of highly enriched clonogenic cells (one out of three isolated cells). Clonal characterization of LNGFR+THY-1+ cells demonstrated cellular heterogeneity among the clones. Rapidly expanding clones (RECs) exhibited robust multilineage differentiation and self-renewal potency, whereas the other clones tended to acquire cellular senescence via P16INK4a and exhibited frequent genomic errors. Furthermore, RECs exhibited unique expression of VCAM-1 and higher cellular motility compared with the other clones. The combination marker LNGFR+THY-1+VCAM-1hi+ (LTV) can be used selectively to isolate the most potent and genetically stable MSCs.

Abstract: Hsp70 is involved in immune responses against infectious pathogens, thermal, and osmotic stress. To understand the immune defense mechanisms of the mud crab Scylla paramamosain, genomic DNA, transcript level and antimicrobial activities of Hsp70 were analyzed. Genomic DNA sequence analysis revealed one intron in this gene. Furthermore, six SNPs were detected by direct sequencing from 30 samples in this study. Hsp70 mRNA was expressed in almost all tissues examined. By using the quantitative real-time PCR, the expression level of Hsp70 in hemocytes showed a clear time-dependent expression pattern during the 96 h after stimulated by Vibrio alginolyticus. Then, recombinant Hsp70 was obtained by using the bacterial expression system, but no obvious antimicrobial activity has been found for the protein in the antimicrobial tests. After osmotic stress, the expression of Hsp70 in hemocytes showed this gene was induced by the high salinity (30 ‰) for at least 96 h. Hsp70 mRNA expression in hemocytes was analyzed after thermal stress at 6 h, the highest and the lowest expression level of Hsp70 was observed at 36 and 15 °C, respectively. These results indicated that Hsp70 was inducible by bacterial, osmotic, and thermal stress, and therefore plays an important role, different from antibacterial peptide, in innate immune responses of S. paramamosain.

Abstract: Connexins (Cx), gap junction (GJ) proteins, are regarded as tumor suppressors, and Cx43 expression is often down regulated in breast tumors. We assessed the effect of Cx43 over-expression in 2D and 3D cultures of two breast adenocarcinoma cell lines: MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. While Cx43 over-expression decreased proliferation of 2D and 3D cultures of MCF-7 by 56% and 80% respectively, MDA-MB-231 growth was not altered in 2D cultures, but exhibited 35% reduction in 3D cultures. C-terminus truncated Cx43 did not alter proliferation. Untransfected MCF-7 cells formed spherical aggregates in 3D cultures, and MDA-MB-231 cells formed stellar aggregates. However, MCF-7 cells over-expressing Cx43 formed smaller sized clusters and Cx43 expressing MDA-MB-231 cells lost their stellar morphology. Extravasation ability of both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells was reduced by 60% and 30% respectively. On the other hand, silencing Cx43 in MCF10A cells, nonneoplastic human mammary cell line, increased proliferation in both 2D and 3D cultures, and disrupted acinar morphology. Although Cx43 over-expression did not affect total levels of β-catenin, α-catenin and ZO-2, it decreased nuclear levels of β-catenin in 2D and 3D cultures of MCF-7 cells, and in 3D cultures of MDA-MB-231 cells. Cx43 associated at the membrane with α-catenin, β-catenin and ZO-2 in 2D and 3D cultures of MCF-7 cells, and only in 3D conditions in MDA-MB-231 cells. This study suggests that Cx43 exerts tumor suppressive effects in a context-dependent manner where GJ assembly with α-catenin, β-catenin and ZO-2 may be implicated in reducing growth rate, invasiveness, and, malignant phenotype of 2D and 3D cultures of MCF-7 cells, and 3D cultures of MDA-MB-231 cells, by sequestering β-catenin away from nucleus.

Abstract: Introduction
Endothelial barrier function is pivotal for the outcome of organ transplantation. Since hypothermic preservation (gold standard) is associated with cold-induced endothelial damage, endothelial barrier function may benefit from organ preservation at warmer temperatures. We therefore assessed endothelial barrier integrity and viability as function of preservation temperature and perfusion solution, and hypothesized that endothelial cell preservation at subnormothermic conditions using metabolism-supporting solutions constitute optimal preservation conditions. Methods: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were preserved at 4–37°C for up to 20h using Ringer's lactate, histidine–tryptophan–ketoglutarate solution, University of Wisconsin (UW) solution, Polysol, or endothelial cell growth medium (ECGM). Following preservation, the monolayer integrity, metabolic capacity, and ATP content were determined as positive parameters of endothelial cell viability. As negative parameters, apoptosis, necrosis, and cell activation were assayed. A viability index was devised on the basis of these parameters. Results: HUVEC viability and barrier integrity was compromised at 4°C regardless of the preservation solution. At temperatures above 20°C, the cells' metabolic demands outweighed the preservation solutions' supporting capacity. Only UW maintained HUVEC viability up to 20°C. Despite high intracellular ATP content, none of the solutions were capable of sufficiently preserving HUVEC above 20°C except for ECGM. Conclusion: Optimal HUVEC preservation is achieved with UW up to 20°C. Only ECGM maintains HUVEC viability at temperatures above 20°C.

Abstract: Summary
Neisseria meningitidis is a life-threatening human bacterial pathogen responsible for pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis. Meningococcal strains with reduced susceptibility to penicillin G (PenI) carry a mutated penicillin-binding protein (PBP2) resulting in a modified peptidoglycan structure. Despite their antibiotic resistance, PenI strains have failed to expand clonally. We analyzed the biological consequences of PBP2 alteration among clinical meningococcal strains and found that peptidoglycan modifications of the PenI strain resulted in diminished in vitro Nod1-dependent proinflammatory activity. In an influenza virus-meningococcal sequential mouse model mimicking human disease, wild-type meningococci induced a Nod1-dependent inflammatory response, colonizing the lungs and surviving in the blood. In contrast, isogenic PenI strains were attenuated for such response and were out-competed by meningococci sensitive to penicillin G. Our results suggest that antibiotic resistance imposes a cost to the success of the pathogen and may potentially explain the lack of clonal expansion of PenI strains.

Abstract: As a new potential inflammatory mediator, visfatin plays an important role in inflammation and atherosclerosis. The formation of macrophage-derived foam cells occurs at the early stage of atherosclerosis and underlies the visible fatty streak. Recent studies have indicated that visfatin may be associated with the development of foam cells, but its exact effect and molecular mechanism remain unknown. This study aims to study the effect of visfatin on foamy cell formation and its underlying molecular mechanism. Visfatin levels were determined in apolipoprotein E (ApoE) knockout (KO) mice on a western diet for 16 weeks. Effects of visfatin in cholesterol accumulation were studied both in vivo and in vitro. The levels of scavenger receptors located in macrophage surface were measured in RAW264.7 cells after treatment with visfatin. Visfatin levels were much higher in ApoE KO mice than that in the control mice. Meanwhile, oxidized low-density lipoprotein induces both visfatin release from RAW264.7 cells and its cellular levels within 24 h. Visfatin promotes lipid accumulation mainly through excessive cholesterol uptake not only in RAW264.7 cells but also in peritoneal macrophages isolated from ApoE KO mice. Furthermore, visfatin induces the activation of scavenger receptors (SR)-A and cluster of differentiation (CD)36, but not that of SR-BI, ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC)A1, or ABCG1 in RAW264.7 cells. Both transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation may work in concert to mediate the expression of SR-A and CD36 in visfatin-treated cells. Visfatin induces cholesterol accumulation in macrophages and accelerates the process of atherosclerosis mainly through modulating the expression of SR-A and CD36.

Abstract: We identified increased expression and redistribution of the intracellular protein 60-kDa human heat shock protein (hHSP60) (HSPD1) to the cell surface in human endothelial cells subjected to classical atherosclerosis risk factors and subsequent immunologic cross-reactivity against this highly conserved molecule, as key events occurring early in the process of atherosclerosis. The present study aimed at investigating the role of infectious pathogens as stress factors for vascular endothelial cells and, as such, contributors to early atherosclerotic lesion formation. Using primary donor-matched arterial and venous human endothelial cells, we show that infection with Chlamydia pneumoniae leads to marked upregulation and surface expression of hHSP60 and adhesion molecules. Moreover, we provide evidence for an increased susceptibility of arterial endothelial cells for redistribution of hHSP60 to the cellular membrane in response to C. pneumoniae infection as compared to autologous venous endothelial cells. We also show that oxidative stress has a central role to play in endothelial cell activation in response to chlamydial infection. These data provide evidence for a role of C. pneumoniae as a potent primary endothelial stressor for arterial endothelial cells leading to enrichment of hHSP60 on the cellular membrane and, as such, a potential initiator of atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Store operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) replenishes intracellular Ca2+ stores and activates a number of intracellular signalling pathways. Whilst several molecular components forming store operated Ca2+ channels (SOCC) have been identified, their modulation in neurons remains poorly understood. Here, we extend on our previous findings and show that neuronal SOCE is modulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. Cyclopiazonic acid induced SOCE was characterised in hippocampal cultures derived from forebrain specific protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B knockout (PTP1B KO) mice and wild type (WT) litter mates using Fura-2 Ca2+ imaging. PTP1B KO cultures expressed elevated SOCE relative to WT cultures without changes in cytoplasmic Ca2+ homeostasis or depolarisation-induced Ca2+ influx. WT and PTP1B KO cultures displayed similar pharmacological sensitivities towards the SOCE inhibitors gadolinium and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, as well as the tyrosine kinase inhibitor Ag126 indicating an augmentation of native SOCCs by PTP1B. Following store depletion WT culture homogenates showed heightened phospho-tyrosine levels, an increase in Src tyrosine kinase activation and two minor PTP1B species. These data suggest tyrosine phosphorylation gating SOCE, and implicate PTP1B as a key regulatory enzyme. The involvement of PTP1B in SOCE and its relation to SOCC components and mechanism of regulation are discussed.

Abstract: Many cell types secrete plasma membrane-bound microvesicles, suggested to play an important role in tissue morphogenesis, wound healing, and cancer spreading. However, the mechanisms of their formation have remained largely unknown. It was found that the tips of long microvilli induced in cells by overexpression of hyaluronan synthase 3 (HAS3) were detach into the culture medium as microvesicles. Moreover, several cell types with naturally active hyaluronan synthesis released high numbers of plasma membrane-derived vesicles, and inhibition of hyaluronan synthesis reduced their formation. The vesicles contained HAS, and were covered with a thick hyaluronan coat, a part of which was retained even after purification with high-speed centrifugation. HAS3 overexpressing MDCK cells cultured in a 3-D matrix as epithelial cysts released large amounts of HAS- and hyaluronan-positive vesicles from their basal surfaces into the extracellular matrix. As far as we know, hyaluronan synthesis is one of the first molecular mechanisms shown to stimulate the production of microvesicles. The microvesicles have a potential to deliver the hyaluronan synthase machinery and membrane and cytoplasmic materials to other cells, influencing tissue regeneration, inflammation and tumor progression.

Abstract: Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are members of a multifunctional antioxidant enzyme superfamily that play pivotal roles in both detoxification and protection against oxidative damage caused by reactive oxygen species. In this study, a complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding a sigma class GST was identified in the Chinese honey bee, Apis cerana cerana (AccGSTS1). AccGSTS1 was constitutively expressed in all tissues of adult worker bees, including the brain, fat body, epidermis, muscle, and midgut, with particularly robust transcription in the fat body. Relative messenger RNA expression levels of AccGSTS1 at different developmental stages varied, with the highest levels of expression observed in adults. The potential function of AccGSTS1 in cellular defenses against abiotic stresses (cold, heat, UV, H2O2, HgCl2, and insecticides) was investigated. AccGSTS1 was significantly upregulated in response to all of the treatment conditions examined, although the induction levels were varied. Recombinant AccGSTS1 protein showed characteristic glutathione-conjugating catalytic activity toward 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene. Functional assays revealed that AccGSTS1 could remove H2O2, thereby protecting DNA from oxidative damage. Escherichia coli overexpressing AccGSTS1 showed long-term resistance under conditions of oxidative stress. Together, these results suggest that AccGSTS1 is a crucial antioxidant enzyme involved in cellular antioxidant defenses and honey bee survival.

Abstract: Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the self-renewal and differentiation of dental epithelial stem cells (DESCs) that support the unlimited growth potential of mouse incisors is critical for developing novel tooth regenerative therapies and unraveling the pathogenesis of odontogenic tumors. However, analysis of DESC properties and regulation has been limited by the lack of an in vitro assay system and well-documented DESC markers. Here, we describe an in vitro sphere culture system to isolate the DESCs from postnatal mouse incisor cervical loops (CLs) where the DESCs are thought to reside. The dissociated cells from CLs were able to expand and form spheres for multiple generations in the culture system. Lineage tracing indicated that DESC within the spheres were epithelial in origin as evident by lineage tracing. Upon stimulation, the sphere cells differentiated into cytokeratin 14- and amelogenin-expressing and mineral material-producing cells. Compared to the CL tissue, sphere cells expressed high levels of expression of Sca-1, CD49f (also designated as integrin α6), and CD44. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analyses of mouse incisor CL cells further showed that the CD49fBright population was enriched in sphere-forming cells. In addition, the CD49fBright population includes both slow-cycling and Lgr5+ DESCs. The in vitro sphere culture system and identification of CD49fBright as a DESC marker provide a novel platform for enriching DESCs, interrogating how maintenance, cell fate determination, and differentiation of DESCs are regulated, and developing tooth regenerative therapies.

Abstract: O-linked-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc), a post translational modification, has emerged as an important cue in controlling key cell mechanisms. Here, we investigate O-GlcNAc's role in the maintenance and differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC). We reveal that protein expression of O-GlcNAc transferase and hydrolase both decreases during hPSC differentiation. Upregulating O-GlcNAc with O-GlcNAc hydrolase inhibitors has no significant effect on either the maintenance of pluripotency in hPSC culture, or the loss of pluripotency in differentiating hPSC. However, in spontaneously differentiating hPSC, excess O-GlcNAc alters the expression of specific lineage markers: decrease of ectoderm markers (PAX6 by 53–88%, MSX1 by 26–49%) and increase of adipose-related mesoderm markers (PPARγ by 28–100%, C/EBPα by 46–135%). All other lineage markers tested (cardiac, visceral-endoderm, trophectoderm) remain minimally affected by upregulated O-GlcNAc. Interestingly, we also show that excess O-GlcNAc triggers a feedback mechanism that increases O-GlcNAc hydrolase expression by 29–91%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that excess O-GlcNAc does not affect hPSC pluripotency in undifferentiated maintenance cultures; instead, it restricts the hPSC differentiation towards specific cell lineages. These data will be useful for developing targeted differentiation protocols and aid in understanding the effects of O-GlcNAc on hPSC differentiation.

Abstract: Neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs) proliferate and differentiate under tight regulation by various factors in the stem cell niche. Recent studies have shown that the precursor of nerve growth factor (NGF), proNGF, abounds in the central nervous system (CNS) and that its expression level in the brain is substantially elevated with aging as well as in several types of CNS disorders. In this study, we found for the first time that proNGF inhibited the proliferation of NSCs isolated from postnatal mouse hippocampus and caused cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase without affecting apoptosis. In addition, proNGF reduced the differentiation of NSCs to oligodendrocytes. The effects of proNGF were blocked by the fusion protein of p75 neurotrophin receptor extracellular domain and human IgG Fc fragment (p75NTR/Fc), and by p75NTR knockout, suggesting that proNGF/p75NTR interaction was involved in the effects of proNGF on NSC proliferation and differentiation. proNGF decreased the phosphorylation level of extracellular signal responsive kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2) in a p75NTR-dependent manner under both self-renewal and differentiation conditions. The inhibition of ERK 1/2 phosphorylation by U0126 significantly reduced the proliferation and oligodendrogenesis of NSCs, indicating that ERK 1/2 inhibition by proNGF partially explains its effects on NSC proliferation and oligodendrogenesis. These results suggest that the proNGF/p75NTR signal plays a key role in the regulation of NSCs' behavior.

Abstract: Purpose
Pterygium is a fibrovascular growth on the ocular surface with corneal tissue destruction, matrix degradation and varying extents of chronic inflammation. To facilitate investigation of pterygium etiology, we immortalized pterygium fibroblast cells and profiled their global transcript levels compared to primary cultured cells.
Methods
Fibroblast cells were cultured from surgically excised pterygium tissue using the explant method and propagated to passage number 2–4. We hypothesized that intervention with 3 critical molecular intermediates may be necessary to propage these cells. Primary fibroblast cells were immortalized sequentially by a retroviral construct containing the human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene and another retroviral expression vector expressing p53/p16 shRNAs. Primary and immortalized fibroblast cells were evaluated for differences in global gene transcript levels using an Agilent Genechip microarray.
Results
Light microscopic morphology of immortalized cells was similar to primary pterygium fibroblast at passage 2–4. Telomerase reverse transcriptase was expressed, and p53 and p16 levels were reduced in immortalized pterygium fibroblast cells. There were 3308 significantly dysregulated genes showing at least 2 fold changes in transcript levels between immortalized and primary cultured cells (2005 genes were up-regulated and 1303 genes were down-regulated). Overall, 13.58% (95% CI: 13.08–14.10) of transcripts in immortalized cells were differentially expressed by at least 2 folds compared to primary cells.
Conclusion
Pterygium primary fibroblast cells were successfully immortalized to at least passage 11. Although a variety of genes are differentially expressed between immortalized and primary cells, only genes related to cell cycle are significantly changed, suggesting that the immortalized cells may be used as an in vitro model for pterygium pathology.

Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in fibrosis: Collagen type I expression is highly upregulated after EMT, but does not contribute to collagen deposition,

Abstract: The hallmark of fibrosis is an accumulation of fibrillar collagens, especially of collagen type I. There is considerable debate whether in vivo type II epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is involved in organ fibrosis. Lineage tracing experiments by various groups show opposing data concerning the relative contribution of epithelial cells to the pool of myofibroblasts. We hypothesized that EMT-derived cells might directly contribute to collagen deposition. To study this, EMT was induced in human epithelial lung and renal cell lines in vitro by means of TGF-β1 stimulation, and we compared the collagen type I (COL1A1) expression levels of transdifferentiated cells with that of myofibroblasts obtained by TGF-β1 stimulation of human dermal and lung fibroblasts. COL1A1 expression levels of transdifferentiated epithelial cells appeared to be at least one to two orders of magnitude lower than that of myofibroblasts. This was confirmed at immunohistochemical level: in contrast to myofibroblasts, collagen type I deposition by EMT-derived cells was not or hardly detectable. We postulate that, even when type II EMT occurs in vivo, the direct contribution of EMT-derived cells to collagen accumulation is rather limited.
