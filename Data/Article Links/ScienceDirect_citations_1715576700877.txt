Abstract: Summary
Driving efficient and pure skeletal muscle cell differentiation from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) has been challenging. Here, we report an optimized protocol that generates skeletal muscle progenitor cells with high efficiency and purity in a short period of time. Human induced PSCs (hiPSCs) and murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs) were specified into the mesodermal myogenic fate using distinct and species-specific protocols. We used a specific maturation medium to promote the terminal differentiation of both human and mouse myoblast populations, and generated myotubes associated with a large pool of cell-cycle arrested PAX7+ cells. We also show that myotube maturation is modulated by dish-coating properties, cell density, and percentage of myogenic progenitor cells. Given the high efficiency in the generation of myogenic progenitors and differentiated myofibers, this protocol provides an attractive strategy for tissue engineering, modeling of muscle dystrophies, and evaluation of new therapeutic approaches in vitro.

Abstract: Summary
Interspecies chimeras offer great potential for regenerative medicine and the creation of human disease models. Whether human pluripotent stem cell–derived neurons in an interspecies chimera can differentiate into functional neurons and integrate into host neural circuity is not known. Here, we show, using Engrailed 1 (En1) as a development niche, that human naive-like embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can incorporate into embryonic and adult mouse brains. Human-derived neurons including tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)+ neurons integrate into the mouse brain at low efficiency. These TH+ neurons have electrophysiologic properties consistent with their human origin. In addition, these human-derived neurons in the mouse brain accumulate pathologic phosphorylated α-synuclein in response to α-synuclein preformed fibrils. Optimization of human/mouse chimeras could be used to study human neuronal differentiation and human brain disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Chemoproteomics has made significant progress in investigating small-molecule-protein interactions. However, the proteome-wide profiling of cysteine ligandability remains challenging to adapt for high-throughput applications, primarily due to a lack of platforms capable of achieving the desired depth using low input in 96- or 384-well plates. Here, we introduce a revamped, plate-based platform which enables routine interrogation of either ∼18,000 or ∼24,000 reactive cysteines based on starting amounts of 10 or 20 μg, respectively. This represents a 5–10X reduction in input and 2–3X improved coverage. We applied the platform to screen 192 electrophiles in the native HEK293T proteome, mapping the ligandability of 38,450 reactive cysteines from 8,274 human proteins. We further applied the platform to characterize new cellular targets of established drugs, uncovering that ARS-1620, a KRASG12C inhibitor, binds to and inhibits an off-target adenosine kinase ADK. The platform represents a major step forward to high-throughput proteome-wide evaluation of reactive cysteines.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) is crucial for cellular function, but DNA damage severely impedes this process. Thus far, transcription-blocking DNA lesions (TBLs) and their repair have been difficult to quantify in living cells. To overcome this, we generated, using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene editing, mScarletI-tagged Cockayne syndrome group B protein (CSB) and UV-stimulated scaffold protein A (UVSSA) knockin cells. These cells allowed us to study the binding dynamics of CSB and UVSSA to lesion-stalled RNA Pol II using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). We show that especially CSB mobility is a sensitive transcription stress marker at physiologically relevant DNA damage levels. Transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER)-mediated repair can be assessed by studying CSB immobilization over time. Additionally, flow cytometry reveals the regulation of CSB protein levels by CRL4CSA-mediated ubiquitylation and deubiquitylation by USP7. This approach allows the sensitive detection of TBLs and their repair and the study of TC-NER complex assembly and stability in living cells.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the encouraging efficacy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy in microsatellite-instability-high/deficient mismatch repair (MSI-H/dMMR) advanced gastrointestinal cancer, many patients exhibit primary or acquired resistance. Using multi-omics approaches, we interrogate gut microbiome, blood metabolome, and cytokines/chemokines of patients with MSI-H/dMMR gastrointestinal cancer (N = 77) at baseline and during the treatment. We identify a number of microbes (e.g., Porphyromonadaceae) and metabolites (e.g., arginine) highly associated with primary resistance to immunotherapy. An independent validation cohort (N = 39) and mouse model are used to further confirm our findings. A predictive machine learning model for primary resistance is also built and achieves an accuracy of 0.79 on the external validation set. Furthermore, several microbes are pinpointed that gradually changed during the process of acquired resistance. In summary, our study demonstrates the essential role of gut microbiome in drug resistance, and this can be utilized as a preventative diagnosis tool and therapeutic target in the future.

Abstract: Background
Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures and is often unresponsive to current treatment options. Ferroptosis, a recently defined iron-dependent regulated cell death, has been suggested as a potential therapeutic target for epilepsy due to its association with oxidative stress. Additionally, circRNA SLC8A1 (circSLC8A1) has been implicated in various neurological disorders and oxidative stress-related diseases but its involvement in epilepsy progression, particularly in relation to ferroptosis and oxidative stress, remains unclear.
Methods
qRT-PCR, Western blot, IHC and ELISA assays were employed to validate the relative expression of targeted genes and proteins. The levels of ROS, iron, LOP and GSH were detected by commercial kits. RNA pull-down and RIP assays were employed to detect the interactions among circSLC8A1, FUS and ATF3. A rat epilepsy model was established for further in vivo confirmation.
Results and conclusion
In this study, we investigated the potential involvement of circSLC8A1 in epilepsy progression and its connection to ferroptosis and oxidative stress. Our findings demonstrate that circSLC8A1 triggers neuronal ferroptosis by stabilizing ATF3 mRNA expression through recruitment with FUS. The induced neuronal ferroptosis contributes to epilepsy progression. These results enhance our understanding of epilepsy pathogenesis and may provide insights for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) reprograms FAs metabolism of macrophages during infection and affects inflammatory reaction eventually, however, the mechanism remains poorly understood. Here we show that Mycobacterium bovis (BCG) induces DUSP5 expression through TLR2-MAPKs signaling pathway and promotes fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Silencing DUSP5 by adeno-associated virus vector (AAV) ameliorates lung injury and DUSP5 knockdown reduces the expression of IL-1β, IL-6 and inactivated NF-κB signaling in BCG-infected macrophages. Of note, DUSP5 specific siRNA increases the content of free fatty acids (FFAs) and triglyceride (TG), but represses the expression of FAO associated enzymes such as CPT1A and PPARα, suggesting DUSP5 mediated FAO during BCG infection. Moreover, Inhibiting FAO by pharmacological manner suppresses IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α expression and relieves lung damage. Taken together, our data indicates DUSP5 mediates FAO reprogramming and promotes inflammatory response to BCG infection.

Abstract: Triple-negative breast cancer is more common among younger than older women and is associated with the poorest survival outcomes of all breast cancer types. Fluvastatin inhibits tumour progression and induces the autophagy of breast cancer cells; however, the role of autophagy in fluvastatin-induced inhibition of breast cancer metastasis is unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to determine this mechanism. The effect of fluvastatin on human hormone receptor-negative breast cancer cells was evaluated in vitro via migration and wound healing assays, western blotting, and morphological measurements, as well as in vivo using a mouse xenograft model. Chloroquine, a prophylactic medication used to prevent malaria in humans was used as an autophagy inhibitor. We found that fluvastatin administration effectively prevented the migration/invasion of triple-negative breast cancer cells, an effect that was largely dependent on the induction of autophagy. Administration of the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine prevented the fluvastatin-induced suppression of lung metastasis in the nude mouse model. Furthermore, fluvastatin increased Ras homolog family member B (RhoB) expression, and the autophagy and anti-metastatic activity induced by fluvastatin were predominantly dependent on the regulation of RhoB through the protein kinase B–mammalian target of rapamycin (Akt–mTOR) signaling pathway. These results suggest that fluvastatin inhibits the metastasis of triple-negative breast cancer cells by modulating autophagy via the up regulation of RhoB through the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway. Fluvastatin may be a promising therapeutic option for patients with triple-negative breast cancer.

Abstract: Lung cancer is the leading cause of mortality worldwide of which non-small cell lung carcinoma constitutes majority of the cases. High mortality is attributed to early metastasis, late diagnosis, ineffective treatment and tumor relapse. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy form the mainstay of its treatment. However, their associated side effects involving kidneys, nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, and liver further adds to dismal outcome. These disadvantages of conventional treatment can be circumvented by use of engineered nanoparticles for improved effectiveness with minimal side effects. In this study we have synthesized silver gold nanocomposite (Ag–Au NC) using polyethylene glycol and l-ascorbic acid as surfactant and reducing agent respectively. Synthesized nanocomposite was characterized by ultraviolet–visible absorption, dynamic light scattering, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Compositional analysis was carried out by energy dispersive X-ray analysis and average pore diameter was estimated using Barrett-Joyner-Halenda method. In-silico molecular docking analysis of the synthesized NC against active regions of epidermal growth factor receptor revealed good binding energy. Subsequently, we investigated the effect of NC on growth and stem cell attributes of A549 lung cancer cells. Results showed that NC was effective in inhibiting A549 cell proliferation, induced DNA damage, G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis. Further, tumor cell migration and spheroid formation were also negatively affected. NC also enhanced reactive oxygen species generation and mitochondrial depolarization. In addition, the effect of NC on putative cancer stem cells in A549 cells was evaluated. We found that Ag–Au NC at IC50 targeted CD44, CD24, CD166, CD133 and CD326 positive cancer stem cells and induced apoptosis. CD166 positive cells were relatively resistance to apoptosis. Together our results demonstrate the anticancer efficacy of Ag–Au NC mediated by a mechanism involving cell cycle arrest and mitochondrial derangement.

Abstract: Summary
The enhanced use of protective materials and chemicals during the COVID-19 pandemic has probably increased river pollution, but the effects of country-specific measures on multiple pollutants in rivers worldwide are not well documented. Here, we use an updated, spatially explicit water quality model to estimate the effects of the increased use of hand soap (triclosan), personal protective equipment and packaging materials (plastics), painkillers (diclofenac), and reduced transportation (microplastics from car tires) on river pollution in 10,226 sub-basins worldwide. Model results indicate that, globally, COVID-19 measures increased river pollution with macroplastics by 56%, triclosan by 33%, and diclofenac by 50%. Notably, only microplastics from car tires decreased. We identified priority sub-basins and pollutants across the globe for which water pollution control strategies should consider the impacts of COVID-19 measures. For these sub-basins, our results can inform the development of strategies for ameliorating the impacts of measures taken during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Abstract: Endometrial carcinoma (EC) is a rising concern among gynecological malignancies. Iroquois Homeobox 2 (IRX2), a member of the Iroquois homeobox gene family, demonstrates variable effects in different cancer types, emphasizing the need for extensive exploration of its involvement in EC progression. Utilizing TCGA and GEO databases, as well as performing immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis on clinical samples, we assessed the expression levels of IRX2 and its promoter methylation in EC. To understand the functional roles of IRX2, we conducted various assays including in vitro CCK-8 assays, colony formation assays, cell invasion assays, and cell apoptosis assays. Moreover, we utilized in vivo subcutaneous xenograft mouse models. Additionally, we performed KEGG pathway and gene set enrichment analyses to gain insights into the underlying mechanisms. To validate the regulatory relationship between IRX2 and RUVBL1, we employed chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays. Our results indicate significantly reduced levels of IRX2 expression in EC, correlating with higher histological grades, advanced clinical stages, and diminished overall survival. We observed that DNA methylation of the IRX2 promoter suppresses its expression in EC, with cg26333652 and cg11793269 playing critical roles as methylated sites. In contrast, ectopic overexpression of IRX2 substantially inhibits cell proliferation and invasion, and promotes cell apoptosis. Additionally, we discovered that IRX2 exerts negative regulation on the expression of RUVBL1, which is upregulated in EC and associated with a poorer prognosis. In conclusion, our findings indicate that decreased expression of IRX2 facilitates EC cell growth through the regulation of RUVBL1 expression, thereby contributing to the development of EC. Hence, targeting the IRX2-RUVBL1 axis holds promise as a potential therapeutic strategy for EC treatment.

Abstract: Summary
We present a method, named Mx-TOP, for profiling of three epigenetic regulatory layers—chromatin accessibility, general DNA modification, and DNA hydroxymethylation—from a single library. The approach is based on chemo-enzymatic covalent tagging of unmodified CG sites and hydroxymethylated cytosine (5hmC) along with GC sites in chromatin, which are then mapped using tag-selective base-resolution TOP-seq sequencing. Our in-depth validation of the approach revealed its sensitivity and informativity in evaluating chromatin accessibility and DNA modification interactions that drive transcriptional regulation. We employed the technology in a study of chromatin and DNA demethylation dynamics during in vitro neuronal differentiation. The study highlighted the involvement of gene body 5hmC in modulating an extensive decoupling between promoter accessibility and transcription. The importance of 5hmC in chromatin remodeling was further demonstrated by the observed resistance of the developmentally acquired open loci to the global 5hmC erasure in neuronal progenitors.

Abstract: Summary
New technologies and large-cohort studies have enabled novel variant discovery and association at unprecedented scale, yet functional characterization of these variants remains paramount to deciphering disease mechanisms. Approaches that facilitate parallelized genome editing of cells of interest or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have become critical tools toward this goal. Here, we developed an approach that incorporates libraries of CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNAs (gRNAs) together with inducible Cas9 into a piggyBac (PB) transposon system to engineer dozens to hundreds of genomic variants in parallel against isogenic cellular backgrounds. This method empowers loss-of-function (LoF) studies through the introduction of insertions or deletions (indels) and copy-number variants (CNVs), though generating specific nucleotide changes is possible with prime editing. The ability to rapidly establish high-quality mutational models at scale will facilitate the development of isogenic cellular collections and catalyze comparative functional genomic studies investigating the roles of hundreds of genes and mutations in development and disease.

Abstract: Summary
Conventional antimicrobial discovery relies on targeting essential enzymes in pathogenic organisms, contributing to a paucity of new antibiotics to address resistant strains. Here, by targeting a non-essential enzyme, Borrelia burgdorferi HtpG, to deliver lethal payloads, we expand what can be considered druggable within any pathogen. We synthesized HS-291, an HtpG inhibitor tethered to the photoactive toxin verteporfin. Reactive oxygen species, generated by light, enables HS-291 to sterilize Borrelia cultures by causing oxidation of HtpG, and a discrete subset of proteins in proximity to the chaperone. This caused irreversible nucleoid collapse and membrane blebbing. Tethering verteporfin to the HtpG inhibitor was essential, since free verteporfin was not retained by Borrelia in contrast to HS-291. For this reason, we liken HS-291 to a berserker, wreaking havoc upon the pathogen’s biology once selectively absorbed and activated. This strategy expands the druggable pathogenic genome and offsets antibiotic resistance by targeting non-essential proteins.

Abstract: Summary
While antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are used in the clinic, therapeutic development is hindered by the inability to assay ASO delivery and activity in vivo. Accordingly, we developed a dual-fluorescence, knockin mouse model that constitutively expresses mKate2 and an engineered EGFP that is alternatively spliced in the presence of ASO to induce expression. We first examined free ASO activity in the brain following intracerebroventricular injection revealing EGFP splice-switching is both ASO concentration and time dependent in major central nervous system cell types. We then assayed the impact of lipid nanoparticle delivery on ASO activity after intravenous administration. Robust EGFP fluorescence was observed in the liver and EGFP+ cells were successfully isolated using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Together, these results show the utility of this animal model in quantifying both cell-type- and organ-specific ASO delivery, which can be used to advance ASO therapeutics for many disease indications.

Abstract: The present research aims to evaluate the efficacy of Silibinin-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles (Sil@MSNs) immobilized into polylactic-co-glycolic acid/Collagen (PLGA/Col) nanofibers on the in vitro proliferation of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) and cellular senescence. Here, the fabricated electrospun PLGA/Col composite scaffolds were coated with Sil@MSNs and their physicochemical properties were examined by FTIR, FE-SEM, and TGA. The growth, viability and proliferation of ASCs were investigated using various biological assays including PicoGreen, MTT, and RT-PCR after 21 days. The proliferation and adhesion of ASCs were supported by the biological and mechanical characteristics of the Sil@MSNs PLGA/Col composite scaffolds, according to FE- SEM. PicoGreen and cytotoxicity analysis showed an increase in the rate of proliferation and metabolic activity of hADSCs after 14 and 21 days, confirming the initial and controlled release of Sil from nanofibers. Gene expression analysis further confirmed the increased expression of stemness markers as well as hTERT and telomerase in ASCs seeded on Sil@MSNs PLGA/Col nanofibers compared to the control group. Ultimately, the findings of the present study introduced Sil@MSNs PLGA/Col composite scaffolds as an efficient platform for long-term proliferation of ASCs in tissue engineering.

Abstract: Summary
Bacteriophages are key components of gut microbiomes, yet the phage colonization process in the infant gut remains uncertain. Here, we establish a large phage sequence database and use strain-resolved analyses to investigate DNA phage succession in infants throughout the first 3 years of life. Analysis of 819 fecal metagenomes collected from 28 full-term and 24 preterm infants and their mothers revealed that early-life phageome richness increases over time and reaches adult-like complexity by age 3. Approximately 9% of early phage colonizers, which are mostly maternally transmitted and infect Bacteroides, persist for 3 years and are more prevalent in full-term than in preterm infants. Although rare, phages with stop codon reassignment are more likely to persist than non-recoded phages and generally display an increase in in-frame reassigned stop codons over 3 years. Overall, maternal seeding, stop codon reassignment, host CRISPR-Cas locus prevalence, and diverse phage populations contribute to stable viral colonization.

Abstract: Summary
Concerns have been raised against using carbon pricing for fighting climate change, as these might disproportionally affect lower-income households and thus increase inequality. However, the distributional implications of climate policies will depend on policy design and their capacity to reduce climate change impacts. To quantify the interaction between climate policy and climate benefits on economic inequality, we develop a numerical climate-economic framework featuring both within- and between-country income heterogeneity. We implement a well-below 2°C target and examine a variety of redistributive schemes. We find that climate change impacts increase economic inequalities within and across countries. Climate policy reduces this increase by half, and an appropriate transfer scheme targeted at low-income households can eliminate it altogether. An equal per-capita redistribution scheme leads to most of the population being economically better off already today. The analysis shows the importance of including climate-economic benefits in the evaluation of climate policies.

Abstract: Previous studies have revealed that B cell activation is regulated by various microRNAs(miRNAs). However, the role of microRNA-130b regulating B cell activation and apoptosis is still unclear. In the present study, we first found that the expression of miR-130b was the lowest in Pro/Pre-B cells and the highest in immature B cells. Besides, the expression of miR-130b decreased after activation in B cells. Through the immuno-phenotypic analysis of miR-130b transgenic and knockout mice, we found that miR-130b mainly promoted the proliferation of B cells and inhibited B cell apoptosis. Furthermore, we identified that Cyld, a tumor suppressor gene was the target gene of miR-130b in B cells. Besides, the Cyld-mediated NF-κB signaling was increased in miR-130b overexpressed B cells, which further explains the enhanced proliferation of B cells. In conclusion, we propose that miR-130b promotes B cell proliferation via Cyld-mediated NF-κB signaling, which provides a new theoretical basis for the molecular regulation of B cell activation.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the mechanism of non-uniform deposition of lithium and dendrite growth is necessary for battery degradation and safety performance improvement. Here, we design a symmetric cell sealed in a glass capillary to observe in situ the morphological changes during the lithium deposition process. Based on the in situ observation results and ex situ battery postmortem scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results, it is found that uneven lithium deposition inevitably occurs under long-term electrodeposition. In addition, lithium deposition under high current density is loose and porous, which is accompanied by the growth of needle-like lithium dendrites. This study reveals that the surface morphology of the anode and the electric field form a feedback mechanism: uneven morphology forms an uneven electric field, leading to a “tip effect” on the electrode surface, causing further uneven lithium deposition and lithium dendrite growth.

Abstract: Summary
Although it is in its early stages, canine induced pluripotent stem cells (ciPSCs) hold great potential for innovative translational research in regenerative medicine, developmental biology, drug screening, and disease modeling. However, almost all ciPSCs were generated from fibroblasts, and available canine cell sources for reprogramming are still limited. Furthermore, no report is available to generate ciPSCs under feeder-free conditions because of their low reprogramming efficiency. Here, we reanalyzed canine pluripotency-associated genes and designed canine LIN28A, NANOG, OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, and C-MYC encoding Sendai virus vector, called 159cf. and 162cf. We demonstrated that not only canine fibroblasts but also canine urine-derived cells, which can be isolated using a noninvasive and straightforward method, were successfully reprogrammed with or without feeder cells. ciPSCs existed in undifferentiated states, differentiating into the three germ layers in vitro and in vivo. We successfully generated ciPSCs under feeder-free conditions, which can promote studies in veterinary and consequently human regenerative medicines.

Abstract: Summary
Solar panels (modules) based on metal halide perovskites are following a fast track to commercialization. Unlike more established solar cell materials, there are not yet decades-long field observations to increase consumer confidence. The “physics and chemistry of failure” approach is used in other industries and estimates product degradation based on laboratory accelerated tests integrated with an understanding of degradation mechanisms. This work uses that approach to quantify the relationship between accelerated tests and projected product behavior for metal halide perovskite modules. Degradation involving photooxidation of methylammonium lead iodide is used to illustrate the method. Acceleration factors in common accelerated tests are found to be low. Conclusions emphasize that the accelerated tests on photovoltaics should not be interpreted as equivalent across module types or as a green light for commercialization unless supported by the appropriate field data or physics and chemistry of failure analysis.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription factors have proven difficult to target with small molecules because they lack pockets necessary for potent binding. Disruption of protein expression can suppress targets and enable therapeutic intervention. To this end, we developed a drug discovery workflow that incorporates cell-line-selective screening and high-throughput expression profiling followed by regulatory network analysis to identify compounds that suppress regulatory drivers of disease. Applying this approach to neuroblastoma (NBL), we screened bioactive molecules in cell lines representing its MYC-dependent (MYCNA) and mesenchymal (MES) subtypes to identify selective compounds, followed by PLATESeq profiling of treated cells. This revealed compounds that disrupt a sub-network of MYCNA-specific regulatory proteins, resulting in MYCN degradation in vivo. The top hit was isopomiferin, a prenylated isoflavonoid that inhibited casein kinase 2 (CK2) in cells. Isopomiferin and its structural analogs inhibited MYC and MYCN in NBL and lung cancer cells, highlighting the general MYC-inhibiting potential of this unique scaffold.

Abstract: Long-term stem cell survival in the cirrhotic liver niche to maintain therapeutic efficacy has not been achieved. In a well-defined diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced liver fibrosis/cirrhosis animal model, we previously showed that liver-resident stem/progenitor cells (MLpvNG2+ cells) or immune cells have improved survival in the fibrotic liver environment but died via apoptosis in the cirrhotic liver environment, and increased levels of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) mediated this cell death. We tested the hypothesis that inhibiting HGF signaling during the cirrhotic phase could keep the cells alive. We used adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors designed to silence the c-Met (HGF-only receptor) gene or a neutralizing antibody (anti-cMet-Ab) to block the c-Met protein in the DEN-induced liver cirrhosis mouse model transplanted with MLpvNG2+ cells between weeks 6 and 7 after DEN administration, which is the junction of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis at the site where most intrahepatic stem cells move toward apoptosis. After 4 weeks of treatment, the transplanted MLpvNG2+ cells survived better in c-Met-deficient mice than in wild-type mice, and cell activity was similar to that of the mice that received MLpvNG2+ cells at 5 weeks after DEN administration (liver fibrosis phase when most of these cells proliferated). Mechanistically, a lack of c-Met signaling remodeled the cirrhotic environment, which favored transplanted MLpvNG2+ cell expansion to differentiation into mature hepatocytes and initiate endogenous regeneration by promoting mature host hepatocyte generation and mediating functional improvements. Therapeutically, c-Met-mediated regeneration can be mimicked by anti-cMet-Ab to interfere functions, which is a potential drug for cell-based treatment of liver fibrosis/cirrhosis.

Abstract: Summary
Every year, 11% of infants are born preterm with significant health consequences, with the vaginal microbiome a risk factor for preterm birth. We crowdsource models to predict (1) preterm birth (PTB; <37 weeks) or (2) early preterm birth (ePTB; <32 weeks) from 9 vaginal microbiome studies representing 3,578 samples from 1,268 pregnant individuals, aggregated from public raw data via phylogenetic harmonization. The predictive models are validated on two independent unpublished datasets representing 331 samples from 148 pregnant individuals. The top-performing models (among 148 and 121 submissions from 318 teams) achieve area under the receiver operator characteristic (AUROC) curve scores of 0.69 and 0.87 predicting PTB and ePTB, respectively. Alpha diversity, VALENCIA community state types, and composition are important features in the top-performing models, most of which are tree-based methods. This work is a model for translation of microbiome data into clinically relevant predictive models and to better understand preterm birth.

Abstract: Summary
Accurately characterizing cell types within complex cell structures provides invaluable information for comprehending the cellular status during biological processes. In this study, we have developed an miRNA-switch cocktail platform capable of reporting and tracking the activities of multiple miRNAs (microRNAs) at the single-cell level, while minimizing disruption to the cell culture. Drawing on the principles of traditional miRNA-sensing mRNA switches, our platform incorporates subcellular tags and employs intelligent engineering to segment three subcellular regions using two fluorescent proteins. These designs enable the quantification of multiple miRNAs within the same cell. Through our experiments, we have demonstrated the platform’s ability to track marker miRNA levels during cell differentiation and provide spatial information of heterogeneity on outlier cells exhibiting extreme miRNA levels. Importantly, this platform offers real-time and in situ miRNA reporting, allowing for multidimensional evaluation of cell profile and paving the way for a comprehensive understanding of cellular events during biological processes.

Mechanoresponsive ETS1 causes endothelial dysfunction and arterialization in varicose veins via NOTCH4/DLL4 signaling,

Abstract: Varicose veins are the most common venous disorder in humans and are characterized by hemodynamic instability due to valvular insufficiency and orthostatic lifestyle factors. It is unclear how changes in biomechanical signals cause aberrant remodeling of the vein wall. Our previous studies suggest that Notch signaling is implicated in varicose vein arterialization. In the arterial system, mechanoresponsive ETS1 is a transcriptional activator of the endothelial Notch, but its involvement in sensing disrupted venous flow and varicose vein formation has not been investigated. Here, we use human varicose veins and cultured human venous endothelial cells to show that disturbed venous shear stress activates ETS1-NOTCH4/DLL4 signaling. Notch components were highly expressed in the neointima, whereas ETS1 was upregulated in all histological layers of varicose veins. In vitro microfluidic flow-based studies demonstrate that even minute changes in venous flow patterns enhance ETS1-NOTCH4/DLL4 signaling. Uniform venous shear stress, albeit an inherently low-flow system, does not induce ETS1 and Notch proteins. ETS1 activation under altered flow was mediated primarily by MEK1/2 and, to a lesser extent, by MEK5 but was independent of p38MAP kinase. Endothelial cell-specific ETS1 knockdown prevented disturbed flow-induced NOTCH4/DLL4 expression. TK216, an inhibitor of ETS-family, inhibited the acquisition of arterial molecular identity and loss of endothelial integrity in cells exposed to the ensuing altered shear stress. We conclude that ETS1 senses blood flow disturbances and may promote venous remodeling by inducing endothelial dysfunction. Targeting ETS1 rather than downstream Notch proteins could be an effective and safe strategy to develop varicose vein therapies.

Abstract: Summary
A novel class of benzoxaboroles was reported to induce cancer cell death but the mechanism was unknown. Using a forward genetics platform, we discovered mutations in cleavage and polyadenylation specific factor 3 (CPSF3) that reduce benzoxaborole binding and confer resistance. CPSF3 is the endonuclease responsible for pre-mRNA 3′-end processing, which is also important for RNA polymerase II transcription termination. Benzoxaboroles inhibit this endonuclease activity of CPSF3 in vitro and also curb transcriptional termination in cells, which results in the downregulation of numerous constitutively expressed genes. Furthermore, we used X-ray crystallography to demonstrate that benzoxaboroles bind to the active site of CPSF3 in a manner distinct from the other known inhibitors of CPSF3. The benzoxaborole compound impeded the growth of cancer cell lines derived from different lineages. Our results suggest benzoxaboroles may represent a promising lead as CPSF3 inhibitors for clinical development.

Abstract: Mammalian cells have three types of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-sensing molecules: ATF6, IRE1, and PERK. Among these, ATF6 is unique in that it is processed in an ER-stress-specific manner and functions as a transcription factor for the activation of anti-ER stress genes (such as BiP). ATF6 is known to have two homologues, ATF6α and ATF6β, and a greater understanding of their functions has been achieved through analyses using cultured cells. Physiological functions are also gradually being investigated in mice lacking ATF6α or ATF6β. However, little is known about the effects on mouse organisms of the deletion of both the ATF6α and ATF6β genes, since such double-knockout (DKO) mice suffer embryonic lethality at an early developmental stage. In this study, we generated and analyzed ATF6 DKO mice in which embryonic lethality was evaded by using Cre/loxP technology. Pancreatic β cell-specific ATF6 DKO mice were born normally and lived without dysregulation of blood-glucose levels but had a reduced tolerance to glucose. Islets isolated from ATF6 DKO mice also showed low production and secretion of insulin and mild enhancement of IRE1 and PERK activity. We further examined the developmental abnormalities of systemic ATF6 DKO mice. The phenotypes of ATF6α−/−; ATF6β−/− mice were similar to those previously reported, but ATF6α+/−; ATF6β−/− and ATF6α−/−; ATF6β+/− mice showed embryonic lethality at middle developmental stages, unlike those reported. Analysis of embryonic fibroblasts derived from these mice revealed that ATF6α and ATF6β have a gene-dose-dependent functional redundancy and display distinct differences in their ability to induce BiP expression.

Abstract: Summary
Autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA), mostly caused by heterozygous OPA1 mutations and characterized by retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss and optic nerve degeneration, is one of the most common types of inherited optic neuropathies. Previous work using a two-dimensional (2D) differentiation model of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has investigated ADOA pathogenesis but failed to agree on the effect of OPA1 mutations on RGC differentiation. Here, we use 3D retinal organoids capable of mimicking in vivo retinal development to resolve the issue. We generated isogenic iPSCs carrying the hotspot OPA1 c.2708_2711delTTAG mutation and found that the mutant variant caused defective initial and terminal differentiation and abnormal electrophysiological properties of organoid-derived RGCs. Moreover, this variant inhibits progenitor proliferation and results in mitochondrial dysfunction. These data demonstrate that retinal organoids coupled with gene editing serve as a powerful tool to definitively identify disease-related phenotypes and provide valuable resources to further investigate ADOA pathogenesis and screen for ADOA therapeutics.

Abstract: Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), a tumor that consists of poorly differentiated skeletal muscle cells, is the most common soft-tissue sarcoma in children. Despite considerable progress within the last decades, therapeutic options are still limited, warranting the need for novel approaches. Recent data suggest deregulation of the Smyd1 protein, a sumoylation target as well as H3K4me2/3 methyltransferase and transcriptional regulator in myogenesis, and its binding partner skNAC, in RMS cells. Here, we show that despite the fact that most RMS cells express at least low levels of Smyd1 and skNAC, failure to upregulate expression of these genes in reaction to differentiation-promoting signals can always be observed. While overexpression of the Smyd1 gene enhances many aspects of RMS cell differentiation and inhibits proliferation rate and metastatic potential of these cells, functional integrity of the putative Smyd1 sumoylation motif and its SET domain, the latter being crucial for HMT activity, appear to be prerequisites for most of these effects. Based on these findings, we explored the potential for novel RMS therapeutic strategies, employing small-molecule compounds to enhance Smyd1 activity. In particular, we tested manipulation of (a) Smyd1 sumoylation, (b) stability of H3K4me2/3 marks, and (c) calpain activity, with calpains being important targets of Smyd1 in myogenesis. We found that specifically the last strategy might represent a promising approach, given that suitable small-molecule compounds will be available for clinical use in the future.

Abstract: Summary
Immunogenic biologics trigger an anti-drug antibody (ADA) response in patients that reduces efficacy and increases adverse reactions. Our laboratory has shown that targeting protein antigen to the liver microenvironment can reduce antigen-specific T cell responses; herein, we present a strategy to increase delivery of otherwise immunogenic biologics to the liver via conjugation to a synthetic mannose polymer, p(Man). This delivery leads to reduced antigen-specific T follicular helper cell and B cell responses resulting in diminished ADA production, which is maintained throughout subsequent administrations of the native biologic. We find that p(Man)-antigen treatment impairs the ADA response against recombinant uricase, a highly immunogenic biologic, without a dependence on hapten immunodominance or control by T regulatory cells. We identify increased T cell receptor signaling and increased apoptosis and exhaustion in T cells as effects of p(Man)-antigen treatment via transcriptomic analyses. This modular platform may enhance tolerance to biologics, enabling long-term solutions for an ever-increasing healthcare problem.

Abstract: Summary
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies are medical breakthroughs in cancer treatment. However, treatment failure is often caused by CAR T cell dysfunction. Additional approaches are needed to overcome inhibitory signals that limit anti-tumor potency. Here, we developed bifunctional fusion “degrader” proteins that bridge one or more target proteins and an E3 ligase complex to enforce target ubiquitination and degradation. Conditional degradation strategies were developed using inducible degrader transgene expression or small molecule-dependent E3 recruitment. We further engineered degraders to block SMAD-dependent TGFβ signaling using a domain from the SARA protein to target both SMAD2 and SMAD3. SMAD degrader CAR T cells were less susceptible to suppression by TGFβ and demonstrated enhanced anti-tumor potency in vivo. These results demonstrate a clinically suitable synthetic biology platform to reprogram E3 ligase target specificity for conditional, multi-specific endogenous protein degradation, with promising applications including enhancing the potency of CAR T cell therapy.

Abstract: Summary
A major problem with mRNA therapeutics is that mRNA is usually degraded within a few hours after entering the cytosol. New approaches for in vitro synthesis of circular mRNA have allowed increased levels and duration of protein synthesis from mRNA therapeutics due to the long half-life of circular mRNA. However, it remains difficult to genetically encode circular mRNAs in mammalian cells. Here, we describe the adaptation of the Tornado (Twister-optimized RNA for durable overexpression) system to achieve in-cell synthesis of circular mRNAs. We screen different promoters and internal ribosomal entry sites (IRESs) and identify combinations that result in high levels of circular mRNA and protein expression. We show that these circular mRNAs can be packaged into virus-like particles (VLPs), thus enabling prolonged protein expression. Overall, these data describe a platform for synthesis of circular mRNAs and how these circular mRNAs can improve VLP therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
Recent studies demonstrate that modified thalidomide chemically alters the binding surface of its binding E3 ligase, CRBN, leading to the degradation of new substrate proteins. In this study, we conduct a proteome-wide analysis of thalidomide-like compounds and pinpoint three derivatives (C5, C6, and C7) that specifically target and degrade the BCL-2 protein. Using AlphaFold-driven molecular modeling combined with experimental data, we suggest that GLY128, ALA131, and THR132 are crucial in forming a CRBN-C5-BCL-2 ternary complex. This interaction is notably distinct from that of venetoclax, a known clinical BCL-2 inhibitor that interacts with the BH3 domain. Significantly, these thalidomide derivatives have the ability to degrade BCL-2 mutations that are resistant to venetoclax, thereby enhancing survival rates in a Notch-depleted Drosophila intestinal tumor model. Our findings highlight the critical role of targeted modifications to the E3 ligase surface in altering its binding affinity and achieving a new substrate protein profile.

Abstract: Stem cell-derived β cells (SC-β cells) differentiated from stem cell-derived pancreatic progenitor (PP) cells are promising tools for enabling normal glucose control of islet transplants and have therapeutic potential for type 1 diabetes treatment. Pancreatic specification is essential for SC-β cell induction in vitro and low-quality PP cells may convert into derivatives of non-pancreatic lineages both in vivo and in vitro, impeding PP-derived β cell safety and differentiation efficiency. Circular RNA (circRNA) commonly determines the fate of stem cells by acting as competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA). Currently, the relationships between endogenous circRNA and pancreatic specification remain elusive. Herein, we used whole transcriptome sequencing analysis and functional experiments to reveal that deficiency of hsa_circ_0032449 resulted in posterior foregut-derived PP cells with a weakened the progenitor state with decreased expression of PDX1, NKX6.1 and CCND1. As differentiation processed into maturation, silencing of hsa_circ_0032449 suppressed PP cell development into functionally mature and glucose-responsive SC-β cells. These SC-β cells exhibited lower serum C-peptide levels compared with those of control groups in nude mice and had difficulties in reversing hyperglycemia in STZ-induced diabetic nude mice. Mechanistically, loss of hsa_circ_0032449 participated in PI3K-AKT signaling transduction by acting as a ceRNA to sponge miR-195-5p and by influencing the expression of the downstream target CCND1 at transcription and translation levels. Overall, our findings identified hsa_circ_0032449 as an essential PP cell-fate specification regulator, indicating a promising potential in clinical applications and basic research.

Abstract: Summary
LILRB4 is an immunosuppressive receptor, and its targeting drugs are undergoing multiple preclinical and clinical trials. Currently, the absence of a functional LILRB4 ligand in solid tumors not only limits the strategy of early antibody screening but also leads to the lack of companion diagnostic (CDx) criteria, which is critical to the objective response rate in early-stage clinical trials. Here, we show that galectin-8 (Gal-8) is a high-affinity functional ligand of LILRB4, and its ligation induces M-MDSC by activating STAT3 and inhibiting NF-κB. Significantly, Gal-8, but not APOE, can induce MDSC, and both ligands bind LILRB4 noncompetitively. Gal-8 expression promotes in vivo tumor growth in mice, and the knockout of LILRB4 attenuates tumor growth in this context. Antibodies capable of functionally blocking Gal-8 are able to suppress tumor growth in vivo. These results identify Gal-8 as an MDSC-driving ligand of LILRB4, and they redefine a class of antibodies for solid tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Cross-kingdom small RNA trafficking between hosts and microbes modulates gene expression in the interacting partners during infection. However, whether other RNAs are also transferred is unclear. Here, we discover that host plant Arabidopsis thaliana delivers mRNAs via extracellular vesicles (EVs) into the fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. A fluorescent RNA aptamer reporter Broccoli system reveals host mRNAs in EVs and recipient fungal cells. Using translating ribosome affinity purification profiling and polysome analysis, we observe that delivered host mRNAs are translated in fungal cells. Ectopic expression of two transferred host mRNAs in B. cinerea shows that their proteins are detrimental to infection. Arabidopsis knockout mutants of the genes corresponding to these transferred mRNAs are more susceptible. Thus, plants have a strategy to reduce infection by transporting mRNAs into fungal cells. mRNAs transferred from plants to pathogenic fungi are translated to compromise infection, providing knowledge that helps combat crop diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Kinase inhibitors are effective cancer therapies, but resistance often limits clinical efficacy. Despite the cataloging of numerous resistance mutations, our understanding of kinase inhibitor resistance is still incomplete. Here, we comprehensively profiled the resistance of ∼3,500 Src tyrosine kinase mutants to four different ATP-competitive inhibitors. We found that ATP-competitive inhibitor resistance mutations are distributed throughout Src’s catalytic domain. In addition to inhibitor contact residues, residues that participate in regulating Src’s phosphotransferase activity were prone to the development of resistance. Unexpectedly, we found that a resistance-prone cluster of residues located on the top face of the N-terminal lobe of Src’s catalytic domain contributes to autoinhibition by reducing catalytic domain dynamics, and mutations in this cluster led to resistance by lowering inhibitor affinity and promoting kinase hyperactivation. Together, our studies demonstrate how drug resistance profiling can be used to define potential resistance pathways and uncover new mechanisms of kinase regulation.

Abstract: Summary
The cell wall of mycobacteria plays a key role in interactions with the environment. Its ability to act as a selective filter is crucial to bacterial survival. Proteins in the cell wall enable this function by mediating the import and export of diverse metabolites, from ions to lipids to proteins. Identifying cell wall proteins is an important step in assigning function, especially as many mycobacterial proteins lack functionally characterized homologues. Current methods for protein localization have inherent limitations that reduce accuracy. Here we showed that although chemical labeling of live cells did not exclusively label surface proteins, protein tagging by the engineered peroxidase APEX2 within live Mycobacterium tuberculosis accurately identified the cytosolic and cell wall proteomes. Our data indicate that substrates of the virulence-associated Type VII ESX secretion system are exposed to the periplasm, providing insight into the currently unknown mechanism by which these proteins cross the mycobacterial cell envelope.

Abstract: Summary
The reuse of retired electric vehicle batteries in grid energy storage offers environmental and economic benefits. This study concentrates on health monitoring algorithms for retired batteries deployed in grid storage. Over 15 months of testing, we collect, analyze, and publicize a dataset of second-life batteries, implementing a cycling protocol simulating grid energy storage load profiles within a 3–4 V voltage window. Four machine-learning-based health estimation models, relying on online-accessible features and initial capacity, are compared, with the selected model achieving a mean absolute percentage error below 2.3% on test data. Additionally, an adaptive online health estimation algorithm is proposed by integrating a clustering-based method, thus limiting estimation errors during online deployment. These results showcase the feasibility of repurposing retired batteries for second-life applications. Based on obtained data and power demand, these second-life batteries exhibit potential for over a decade of grid energy storage use.

Abstract: Summary
In the context of achieving net zero climate targets, heating poses a significant decarbonization challenge, with buildings contributing substantially to global energy consumption and carbon emissions. While enhancing energy efficiency in building fabric can reduce emissions, complete elimination is not feasible while relying on fossil-fuel-based heating systems. Hydrogen has been suggested for decarbonizing buildings in recent years as a potential solution for replacing fossil-fuel heating. This paper carries out a meta-review of 54 independent studies to assess the scientific evidence for using hydrogen for heating buildings. The analysis concludes that the scientific evidence does not support a major role for hydrogen in cost-optimal decarbonization pathways being associated with higher energy system and consumer costs. Electrification and district heating are deemed preferable due to higher efficiency and lower costs in the majority of analyzed studies.

Abstract: Summary
Lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitor (LMPP)-like and granulocyte-monocyte progenitor (GMP)-like leukemia stem cells (LSCs) co-exist in the blood of most patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Complete elimination of both types of LSCs is required to cure AML. Using an MLL-AF9-induced murine AML model, we studied the role of hematopoietic cytokines in the survival of LMPP- and GMP-like LSCs. We found that SCF or FLT3L promotes the survival of LMPP-like LSCs by stimulating Stat5-mediated Mcl1 expression, whereas interleukin-3 (IL-3) or IL-6 induces the survival of GMP-like LSCs by stimulating Stat3/nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-mediated Bcl2 expression. Functional study demonstrated that, compared to AML cells cultured in IL-3 and IL-6 medium, AML cells in SCF- or Flt3L-only culture are highly clonogenic in in vitro culture and are highly leukemogenic in vivo. Our study suggests that co-inhibition of both STAT5-MCL1 and STAT3/NF-κB-BCL2 signaling might represent an improved treatment strategy against AML, specifically AML cases with a monocytic phenotype and/or FLT3 mutations.

Abstract: The tardigrade Ramazzottius varieornatus has remarkable resilience to a range of environmental stresses. In this study, we have characterised two members of the small heat shock protein (sHSP) family in R. varieornatus, HSP20–3 and HSP20–6. These are the most highly upregulated sHSPs in response to a 24 h heat shock at 35 0C of adult tardigrades with HSP20–3 being one of the most highly upregulated gene in the whole transcriptome. Both R. varieornatus sHSPs and the human sHSP, CRYAB (HSPB5), were produced recombinantly for comparative structure-function studies. HSP20–3 exhibited a superior chaperone activity than human CRYAB in a heat-induced protein aggregation assay. Both tardigrade sHSPs also formed larger oligomers than CRYAB as assessed by size exclusion chromatography and transmission electron microscopy of negatively stained samples. Whilst both HSP20–3 and HSP20–6 formed particles that were variable in size and larger than the particles formed by CRYAB, only HSP20–3 formed filament-like structures. The particles and filament-like structures formed by HSP20–3 appear inter-related as the filament-like structures often had particles located at their ends. Sequence analyses identified two unique features; an insertion in the middle region of the N-terminal domain (NTD) and preceding the critical-sequence identified in CRYAB, as well as a repeated QNTN-motif located in the C-terminal domain of HSP20–3. The NTD insertion is expected to affect protein-protein interactions and subunit oligomerisation. Removal of the repeated QNTN-motif abolished HSP20–3 chaperone activity and also affected the assembly of the filament-like structures. We discuss the potential contribution of HSP20–3 to protein condensate formation.

Abstract: Metastasis is the primary cause of cancer-related deaths and remains poorly understood. Deubiquitinase OTU domain containing 4 (OTUD4) has been reported to regulate antiviral immune responses and resistance to radio- or chemo-therapies in certain cancers. However, the role of OTUD4 in cancer metastasis remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the depletion of OTUD4 in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells markedly suppress cell clonogenic ability, migration, invasion and cancer stem cell population in vitro as well as metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, the tumor promoting function of OTUD4 is mainly mediated by deuiquitinating and stabilizing Snail1, one key transcriptional factor in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The inhibitory effect of targeting OTUD4 could be largely reversed by the reconstitution of Snail1 in OTUD4-deficient cells. Overall, our study establishes the OTUD4‐Snail1 axis as an important regulatory mechanism of breast cancer metastasis and provides a rationale for potential therapeutic interventions in the treatment of TNBC.

Abstract: Summary
There is a need to discover and develop non-toxic antibiotics that are effective against metabolically dormant bacteria, which underlie chronic infections and promote antibiotic resistance. Traditional antibiotic discovery has historically favored compounds effective against actively metabolizing cells, a property that is not predictive of efficacy in metabolically inactive contexts. Here, we combine a stationary-phase screening method with deep learning-powered virtual screens and toxicity filtering to discover compounds with lethality against metabolically dormant bacteria and favorable toxicity profiles. The most potent and structurally distinct compound without any obvious mechanistic liability was semapimod, an anti-inflammatory drug effective against stationary-phase E. coli and A. baumannii. Integrating microbiological assays, biochemical measurements, and single-cell microscopy, we show that semapimod selectively disrupts and permeabilizes the bacterial outer membrane by binding lipopolysaccharide. This work illustrates the value of harnessing non-traditional screening methods and deep learning models to identify non-toxic antibacterial compounds that are effective in infection-relevant contexts.

Abstract: Summary
As a key regulator of the innate immune system, the NLRP3 inflammasome responds to a variety of environmental insults through activation of caspase-1 and release of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18. Aberrant NLRP3 inflammasome function is implicated in numerous inflammatory diseases, spurring drug discovery efforts at NLRP3 as a therapeutic target. A diverse array of small molecules is undergoing preclinical/clinical evaluation with a reported mode of action involving direct modulation of the NLRP3 pathway. However, for a subset of these ligands the functional link between live-cell target engagement and pathway inhibition has yet to be fully established. Herein we present a cohort of mechanistic assays to both query direct NLRP3 engagement in cells, and functionally interrogate different nodes of NLRP3 pathway activity. This system enabled the stratification of potency for five confirmed NLRP3 inhibitors, and identification of two reported NLRP3 inhibitors that failed to demonstrate direct pathway antagonism.

Abstract: Summary
Mycobacterial bioenergetics is a validated target space for antitubercular drug development. Here, we identify BB2-50F, a 6-substituted 5-(N,N-hexamethylene)amiloride derivative as a potent, multi-targeting bioenergetic inhibitor of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We show that BB2-50F rapidly sterilizes both replicating and non-replicating cultures of M. tuberculosis and synergizes with several tuberculosis drugs. Target identification experiments, supported by docking studies, showed that BB2-50F targets the membrane-embedded c-ring of the F1Fo-ATP synthase and the catalytic subunit (substrate-binding site) of succinate dehydrogenase. Biochemical assays and metabolomic profiling showed that BB2-50F inhibits succinate oxidation, decreases the activity of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and results in succinate secretion from M. tuberculosis. Moreover, we show that the lethality of BB2-50F under aerobic conditions involves the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Overall, this study identifies BB2-50F as an effective inhibitor of M. tuberculosis and highlights that targeting multiple components of the mycobacterial respiratory chain can produce fast-acting antimicrobials.

Abstract: Summary
Acetaminophen overuse is a common cause of acute liver failure (ALF). During ALF, toxins are metabolized by enzymes such as CYP2E1 and transformed into reactive species, leading to oxidative damage and liver failure. Here, we found that oral magnesium (Mg) alleviated acetaminophen-induced ALF through metabolic changes in gut microbiota that inhibit CYP2E1. The gut microbiota from Mg-supplemented humans prevented acetaminophen-induced ALF in mice. Mg exposure modulated Bifidobacterium metabolism and enriched indole-3-carboxylic acid (I3C) levels. Formate C-acetyltransferase (pflB) was identified as a key Bifidobacterium enzyme involved in I3C generation. Accordingly, a Bifidobacterium pflB knockout showed diminished I3C generation and reduced the beneficial effects of Mg. Conversely, treatment with I3C or an engineered bacteria overexpressing Bifidobacterium pflB protected against ALF. Mechanistically, I3C bound and inactivated CYP2E1, thus suppressing formation of harmful reactive intermediates and diminishing hepatocyte oxidative damage. These findings highlight how interactions between Mg and gut microbiota may help combat ALF.

Abstract: Summary
Achieving a net-zero emissions economy by 2050 requires immediate and accelerated growth of solar photovoltaics within the next decade. However, the projected silver consumption needed for this growth is unsustainable. Here, we use poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), a conducting conjugated polymer, as an intrinsically conductive adhesive (ICA) to replace silver-based electrically conductive adhesives (ECAs) as the adhesive interconnect for shingled solar modules. Solar cells shingled with PEDOT:PSS-based ICAs have similar photovoltaic performance metrics to those shingled with commercially available silver-based ECAs, as well as similar stability when subjected to thermal cycling. While today’s dominant busbar-based modules require ∼15.8 mg/W silver, we calculate that shingling modules with ICAs can reduce silver consumption to ∼6.3 mg/W, accelerating our position on the silver learning curve by approximately two decades. These findings suggest that the design of π-conjugated materials for ICAs could offer a realistic strategy for sustainable deployment of lower-cost, high-power solar modules.

Abstract: Summary
Cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF) is an unconventional neurotropic factor that modulates unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway signaling and alleviates endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress providing cytoprotective effects in different models of neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we developed a brain-penetrating peptidomimetic compound based on human CDNF. This compound called HER-096 shows similar potency and mechanism of action as CDNF, and promotes dopamine neuron survival, reduces α-synuclein aggregation and modulates UPR signaling in in vitro models. HER-096 is metabolically stable and able to penetrate to cerebrospinal (CSF) and brain interstitial fluids (ISF) after subcutaneous administration, with an extended CSF and brain ISF half-life compared to plasma. Subcutaneously administered HER-096 modulated UPR pathway activity, protected dopamine neurons, and reduced α-synuclein aggregates and neuroinflammation in substantia nigra of aged mice with synucleinopathy. Peptidomimetic HER-096 is a candidate for development of a disease-modifying therapy for Parkinson’s disease with a patient-friendly route of administration.

Abstract: Exploration of the molecular mechanisms of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) growth has significant clinical benefits. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to play vital roles in the regulation of the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. However, the mechanism by which lncRNA affects the proliferation and apoptosis of MSCs is unclear. In this study, sequencing analysis revealed that LINC00707 was significantly decreased in non-adherent human MSCs (non-AC-hMSCs) compared to adherent human MSCs. Moreover, LINC00707 overexpression promoted non-AChMSC proliferation, cell cycle progression from the G0/G1 phase to the S phase and inhibited apoptosis, whereas LINC00707 silencing had the opposite effect. Furthermore, LINC00707 interacted directly with the quaking (QKI) protein and enhanced the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase ring finger protein 6 (RNF6)-mediated ubiquitination of the QKI protein. Additionally, the overexpression of QKI rescued the promotive effects on proliferation and inhibitory effects on apoptosis in non-AC-hMSCs induced by the ectopic expression of LINC00707. Thus, LINC00707 contributes to the proliferation and apoptosis in non-AChMSCs by regulating the ubiquitination and degradation of the QKI protein.

Abstract: Summary
Propionate is a short-chain fatty acid that is generated upon microbiome-mediated fiber fermentation in the intestine. By modulating immune and metabolic pathways, propionate exerts many health benefits. Key bacterial species, such as Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, generate propionate, but the biochemical pathways and specific functions remain undetermined. We identified a gene operon-encoding methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM) that contributes to propionate biosynthesis in B. thetaiotaomicron. Colonization of germ-free mice with wild-type or MCM-deficient strains as well as in vitro examination demonstrated that MCM-mediated propionate production promotes goblet cell differentiation and mucus-related gene expression. Intestinal organoids lacking the propionate receptor, GPR41, showed reduced goblet cell differentiation upon MCM-mediated propionate production. Furthermore, although wild-type B. thetaiotaomicron alleviated DSS-induced intestinal inflammation, this effect was abolished in mice receiving the MCM-deficient strain but restored upon propionate supplementation. These data emphasize the critical role of MCM-mediated propionate biosynthesis in goblet cell differentiation, offering potential pathways to ameliorate colitis.

Abstract: Summary
Leveraging protein structural information to evaluate pathogenicity has been hindered by the scarcity of experimentally determined 3D protein. With the aid of AlphaFold2 predictions, we developed the structure-informed genetic missense mutation assessor (SIGMA) to predict missense variant pathogenicity. In comparison with existing predictors across labeled variant datasets and experimental datasets, SIGMA demonstrates superior performance in predicting missense variant pathogenicity (AUC = 0.933). We found that the relative solvent accessibility of the mutated residue contributed greatly to the predictive ability of SIGMA. We further explored combining SIGMA with other top-tier predictors to create SIGMA+, proving highly effective for variant pathogenicity prediction (AUC = 0.966). To facilitate the application of SIGMA, we pre-computed SIGMA scores for over 48 million possible missense variants across 3,454 disease-associated genes and developed an interactive online platform (https://www.sigma-pred.org/). Overall, by leveraging protein structure information, SIGMA offers an accurate structure-based approach to evaluating the pathogenicity of missense variants.

Abstract: The combination of chemotherapy and phototherapy has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for enhancing the efficacy of cancer treatment and mitigating drug resistance. Salinomycin (SAL), a polyether antibiotic, exhibits potent cytotoxicity against chemotherapy-resistant cancer cells. IR780 iodide, a novel photosensitive reagent with excellent near-infrared (NIR) light absorption and photothermal conversion abilities, is suitable for use in photothermal therapy for cancers. However, both SAL and IR780 exhibit hydrophobic properties that limit their clinical applicability. Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) are an emerging class of fluorescent probe materials capable of emitting high-energy photons upon excitation by low-energy NIR light. The UCNPs not only function as nanocarriers for drug delivery but also serve as light transducers to activate photosensitizers for deep-tissue photodynamic therapy. Here, to enhance the targeting and bioavailability of hydrophobic drugs in liver cancer stem cells (LCSCs), we employ distearoyl phosphorethanolamine-polyethylene glycol (DSPE-PEG) to encapsulate SAL and IR780 on the surface of UCNPs. Cell viability was evaluated using the CCK-8 assay. Cell migration was assessed by the Transwell Boyden Chamber. The activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway was measured via western blot. The results demonstrated successful loading of both IR780 and SAL onto the UCNPs, and the SAL and IR780-loaded UCNPs (UISP) exhibited a robust photothermal effect under NIR light irradiation. The UISP effectively inhibited the viability of HCCLM3 and LCSCs. Under NIR light irradiation, the UISP further suppressed HCCLM3 viability but had no impact on LCSC viability; however, it could further inhibit LCSC migration. Meanwhile, under NIR light irradiation, the UISP persistently activated the MAPK pathway more significantly in LCSCs. These findings suggest that exposure to NIR light results in persistent activation of the MAPK pathway by UISP, thereby influencing the biological behavior of LCSCs and enhancing their therapeutic efficacy against liver cancer.

Abstract: The potential protective effect of basic fibroblast growth factor (BFGF) on the cardiovascular system has been proposed previously, however, its effect on calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) and underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated. The valvular interstitial cell (VIC) were isolated from porcine aortic valve leaflets. To investigate the effect of BFGF on osteogenic differentiation of VIC, the osteogenic induced medium (OIM) and BFGF were added. The protein expression level was detected by Western blot, and apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry. The effect of BFGF on CAVD process in vivo was assessed by a rat CAVD model, which was identified by echocardiography and Alizarin red staining. The expression level of BFGF in the aortic valve and serum were significantly upregulated in CAVD patients compared to control group. In addition, exogenous BFGF injection attenuates CAVD process in vivo. The protein markers of osteogenic differentiation, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), and apoptosis were significantly upregulated by culture with OIM. On the contrary, the aforementioned proteins were suppressed after adding 100 ng/mL of BFGF. Inhibition of PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 pathways by specific inhibitors abolished the protective effect of BFGF. In conclusion, BFGF could alleviate the VIC calcification by inhibiting ERS-mediated apoptosis, which is partly regulated by activation of the PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. BFGF may provide a potential avenue for CAVD therapy.

Abstract: Nowadays, it is an established concept that the capability to reach a specialised cell identity via differentiation, as in the case of multi- and pluripotent stem cells, is not only determined by biochemical factors, but that also physical aspects of the microenvironment play a key role; interpreted by the cell through a force-based signalling pathway called mechanotransduction. However, the intricate ties between the elements involved in mechanotransduction, such as the extracellular matrix, the glycocalyx, the cell membrane, Integrin adhesion complexes, Cadherin-mediated cell/cell adhesion, the cytoskeleton, and the nucleus, are still far from being understood in detail. Here we report what is currently known about these elements in general and their specific interplay in the context of multi- and pluripotent stem cells. We furthermore merge this overview to a more comprehensive picture, that aims to cover the whole mechanotransductive pathway from the cell/microenvironment interface to the regulation of the chromatin structure in the nucleus. Ultimately, with this review we outline the current picture of the interplay between mechanotransductive cues and epigenetic regulation and how these processes might contribute to stem cell dynamics and fate.

Abstract: COVID-19 disease progression can be accompanied by a “cytokine storm” that leads to secondary sequelae such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. Several inflammatory cytokines have been associated with COVID-19 disease progression, but have high daily intra-individual variability. In contrast, we have shown that the inflammatory biomarker γ' fibrinogen (GPF) has a 6-fold lower coefficient of variability compared to other inflammatory markers such as hs-CRP. The aims of the study were to measure GPF in serial blood samples from COVID-19 patients at a tertiary care medical center in order to investigate its association with clinical measures of disease progression. COVID-19 patients were retrospectively enrolled between 3/16/2020 and 8/1/2020. GPF was measured using a commercial ELISA. We found that COVID-19 patients can develop extraordinarily high levels of GPF. Our results showed that ten out of the eighteen patients with COVID-19 had the highest levels of GPF ever recorded. The previous highest GPF level of 80.3 mg/dL was found in a study of 10,601 participants in the ARIC study. GPF levels were significantly associated with the need for ECMO and mortality. These findings have potential implications regarding prophylactic anticoagulation of COVID-19 patients.

Abstract: Summary
Lung adenocarcinoma follows a stepwise progression from pre-invasive to invasive. However, there remains a knowledge gap regarding molecular events from pre-invasive to invasive. Here, we conduct a comprehensive proteogenomic analysis comprising whole-exon sequencing, RNA sequencing, and proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiling on 98 pre-invasive and 99 invasive lung adenocarcinomas. The deletion of chr4q12 contributes to the progression from pre-invasive to invasive adenocarcinoma by downregulating SPATA18, thus suppressing mitophagy and promoting cell invasion. Proteomics reveals diverse enriched pathways in normal lung tissues and pre-invasive and invasive adenocarcinoma. Proteomic analyses identify three proteomic subtypes, which represent different stages of tumor progression. We also illustrate the molecular characterization of four immune clusters, including endothelial cells, B cells, DCs, and immune depression subtype. In conclusion, this comprehensive proteogenomic study characterizes the molecular architecture and hallmarks from pre-invasive to invasive lung adenocarcinoma, guiding the way to a deeper understanding of the tumorigenesis and progression of this disease.

Abstract: Summary
While studied extensively in model systems, human gastrulation remains obscure. The scarcity of fetal biological material as well as ethical considerations limit our understanding of this process. In vitro attachment of natural blastocysts shed light on aspects of the second week of human development in the absence of the morphological manifestation of gastrulation. Stem cell-derived blastocyst models, blastoids, provide the opportunity to reconstitute pre- to post-implantation development in vitro. Here we show that upon in vitro attachment, human blastoids self-organize a BRA+ population and undergo gastrulation. Single-cell RNA sequencing of these models replicates the transcriptomic signature of the human gastrula. Analysis of developmental timing reveals that in both blastoid models and natural human embryos, the onset of gastrulation as defined by molecular markers, can be traced to timescales equivalent to 12 days post fertilization. In all, natural human embryos and blastoid models self-organize primitive streak and mesoderm derivatives upon in vitro attachment.

Abstract: Summary
Proteomic profiling of protease-generated N termini provides key insights into protease function and specificity. However, current technologies have sequence limitations or require specialized synthetic reagents for N-terminal peptide isolation. Here, we introduce an N terminomics toolbox that combines selective N-terminal biotinylation using 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde (2PCA) reagents with chemically cleavable linkers to enable efficient enrichment of protein N termini. By incorporating a commercially available alkyne-modified 2PCA in combination with Cu(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), our strategy eliminates the need for chemical synthesis of N-terminal probes. Using these reagents, we developed PICS2 (Proteomic Identification of Cleavage Sites with 2PCA) to profile the specificity of subtilisin/kexin-type proprotein convertases (PCSKs). We also implemented CHOPPER (chemical enrichment of protease substrates with purchasable, elutable reagents) for global sequencing of apoptotic proteolytic cleavage sites. Based on their broad applicability and ease of implementation, PICS2 and CHOPPER are useful tools that will advance our understanding of protease biology.

Abstract: Summary
Craving is central to methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) and both characterizes the disease and predicts relapse. However, there is currently a lack of robust and reliable biomarkers for monitoring craving and diagnosing MUD. Here, we seek to identify a neurobiological signature of craving based on individual-level functional connectivity pattern differences between healthy control and MUD subjects. We train high-density electroencephalography (EEG)-based models using data recorded during the resting state and then calculate imaginary coherence features between the band-limited time series across different brain regions of interest. Our prediction model demonstrates that eyes-open beta functional connectivity networks have significant predictive value for craving at the individual level and can also identify individuals with MUD. These findings advance the neurobiological understanding of craving through an EEG-tailored computational model of the brain connectome. Dissecting neurophysiological features provides a clinical avenue for personalized treatment of MUD.

Abstract: Summary
The nucleus controls cell growth and division through coordinated interactions between nuclear proteins and chromatin. Mutations that impair nuclear protein association with chromatin are implicated in numerous diseases. Covalent ligands are a promising strategy to pharmacologically target nuclear proteins, such as transcription factors, which lack ordered small-molecule binding pockets. To identify nuclear cysteines that are susceptible to covalent liganding, we couple proximity labeling (PL), using a histone H3.3-TurboID (His-TID) construct, with chemoproteomics. Using covalent scout fragments, KB02 and KB05, we identified ligandable cysteines on proteins involved in spindle assembly, DNA repair, and transcriptional regulation, such as Cys101 of histone acetyltransferase 1 (HAT1). Furthermore, we show that covalent fragments can affect the abundance, localization, and chromatin association of nuclear proteins. Notably, the Parkinson disease protein 7 (PARK7) showed increased nuclear localization and chromatin association upon KB02 modification at Cys106. Together, this platform provides insights into targeting nuclear cysteines with covalent ligands.

Abstract: The voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) forms an oligomeric structure on the mitochondrial outer membrane, which plays critical roles in many physiological processes. Research studies have demonstrated that the knockout of VDAC1 increases pigment content and up-regulates the expression of melanogenic genes. Due to its involvement in various physiological processes, the depletion of VDAC1 has significant detrimental effects on cellular functions and the inhibition of VDAC1 oligomerization has recently emerged as a promising strategy for the treatment of several diseases. In this study, we found that VDAC1 oligomerization inhibitors, VBIT-12 and NSC-15364, promote melanogenesis, dendrite formation and melanosome transport in human epidermal melanocytes (HEMCs). Mechanistically, treatment of HEMCs with an oligomerization inhibitor increased the level of cytoplasmic calcium ions, which activated calcium-calmodulin dependent protein kinase (CaMK) and led to the phosphorylation of CREB and the nuclear translocation of CREB-regulated transcription coactivators (CRTCs). Subsequently, CRTCs, p-CREB and CREB-binding protein (CBP) in the nucleus cooperatively recruit the transcription machinery to initiate the transcription of MITF thus promoting pigmentation. Importantly, our study also demonstrates that VDAC1 oligomerization inhibitors increase pigmentation in zebrafish and in human skin explants, highlighting their potential as a therapeutic strategy for skin pigmentation disorders.

Abstract: Summary
PIM kinases have important pro-tumorigenic roles and mediate several oncogenic traits, including cell proliferation, survival, and chemotherapeutic resistance. As a result, multiple PIM inhibitors have been pursued as investigational new drugs in cancer; however, response to PIM inhibitors in solid tumors has fallen short of expectations. We found that inhibition of PIM kinase activity stabilizes protein levels of all three PIM isoforms (PIM1/2/3), and this can promote resistance to PIM inhibitors and chemotherapy. To overcome this effect, we designed PIM proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) to target PIM for degradation. PIM PROTACs effectively downmodulated PIM levels through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Importantly, degradation of PIM kinases was more potent than inhibition of catalytic activity at inducing apoptosis in prostate cancer cell line models. In conclusion, we provide evidence of the advantages of degrading PIM kinases versus inhibiting their catalytic activity to target the oncogenic functions of PIM kinases.

Abstract: Summary
Ferroptosis is a non-apoptotic form of cell death that can be triggered by inhibiting the system xc− cystine/glutamate antiporter or the phospholipid hydroperoxidase glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). We have investigated how cell cycle arrest caused by stabilization of p53 or inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) impacts ferroptosis sensitivity. Here, we show that cell cycle arrest can enhance sensitivity to ferroptosis induced by covalent GPX4 inhibitors (GPX4i) but not system xc− inhibitors. Greater sensitivity to GPX4i is associated with increased levels of oxidizable polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing phospholipids (PUFA-PLs). Higher PUFA-PL abundance upon cell cycle arrest involves reduced expression of membrane-bound O-acyltransferase domain-containing 1 (MBOAT1) and epithelial membrane protein 2 (EMP2). A candidate orally bioavailable GPX4 inhibitor increases lipid peroxidation and shrinks tumor volumes when combined with a CDK4/6 inhibitor. Thus, cell cycle arrest may make certain cancer cells more susceptible to ferroptosis in vivo.

Abstract: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. The upregulation of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system observed in certain types of breast cancers was linked to growth, metastasis, and survival resulting in multiple strategies designed to target the type I IGF receptor (IGF-1R) in breast cancer. These attempts failed to prove beneficial and it has been suggested that insulin receptor (IR) could also play an important role in breast cancer biology. To better understand the IR's role in breast cancer cells, the receptor was deleted from MCF-7L cells using CRISPR technology, and fluorescence-assisted cell sorting was used to obtain clone 35 (CL35). It was found that CL35 activated signaling pathways upon insulin stimulation despite the absence of IR expression. We hypothesized that CL35 used a surrogate receptor for sustained growth and development. IGF-1R was able to activate insulin signaling and growth in CL35. Thus, insulin may play a central role in regulating breast cancer growth due to its ability to activate all the receptors of the IGF family. These findings argue that dual targeting of IR and IGF-IR may be required to inhibit breast cancer growth.

Abstract: Summary
Personalized treatment of complex diseases has been mostly predicated on biomarker identification of one drug-disease combination at a time. Here, we use a computational approach termed Disruption Networks to generate a data type, contextualized by cell-centered individual-level networks, that captures biology otherwise overlooked when performing standard statistics. This data type extends beyond the “feature level space”, to the “relations space”, by quantifying individual-level breaking or rewiring of cross-feature relations. Applying Disruption Networks to dissect high-dimensional blood data, we discover and validate that the RAC1-PAK1 axis is predictive of anti-TNF response in inflammatory bowel disease. Intermediate monocytes, which correlate with the inflammatory state, play a key role in the RAC1-PAK1 responses, supporting their modulation as a therapeutic target. This axis also predicts response in rheumatoid arthritis, validated in three public cohorts. Our findings support blood-based drug response diagnostics across immune-mediated diseases, implicating common mechanisms of non-response.

Abstract: Summary
Methotrexate (MTX) is a tight-binding dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibitor, used as both an antineoplastic and immunosuppressant therapeutic. MTX, like folate undergoes folylpolyglutamate synthetase-mediated γ-glutamylation, which affects cellular retention and target specificity. Mechanisms of MTX resistance in cancers include a decrease in MTX poly-γ-glutamylation and an upregulation of DHFR. Here, we report a series of potent MTX-based proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) to investigate DHFR degradation pharmacology and one-carbon biochemistry. These on-target, cell-active PROTACs show proteasome- and E3 ligase-dependent activity, and selective degradation of DHFR in multiple cancer cell lines. By comparison, treatment with MTX increases cellular DHFR protein expression. Importantly, these PROTACs produced distinct, less-lethal phenotypes compared to MTX. The chemical probe set described here should complement conventional DHFR inhibitors and serve as useful tools for studying one-carbon biochemistry and dissecting complex polypharmacology of MTX and related drugs. Such compounds may also serve as leads for potential autoimmune and antineoplastic therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
The only FDA-approved oral immunotherapy for a food allergy provides protection against accidental exposure to peanuts. However, this therapy often causes discomfort or side effects and requires long-term commitment. Better preventive and therapeutic solutions are urgently needed. We develop a tolerance-inducing vaccine technology that utilizes glycosylation-modified antigens to induce antigen-specific non-responsiveness. The glycosylation-modified antigens are administered intravenously (i.v.) or subcutaneously (s.c.) and traffic to the liver or lymph nodes, respectively, leading to preferential internalization by antigen-presenting cells, educating the immune system to respond in an innocuous way. In a mouse model of cow’s milk allergy, treatment with glycosylation-modified β-lactoglobulin (BLG) is effective in preventing the onset of allergy. In addition, s.c. administration of glycosylation-modified BLG shows superior safety and potential in treating existing allergies in combination with anti-CD20 co-therapy. This platform provides an antigen-specific immunomodulatory strategy to prevent and treat food allergies.

Abstract: Neurogenic pulmonary edema secondary to acute brain injury (ABI) is a common and fatal disease condition. However, the pathophysiology of brain-lung interactions is incompletely understood. This study aims to investigate whether sympathetic activation-mediated high fluid shear stress after ABI would damage pulmonary endothelial glycocalyx thus leading to increased pulmonary capillary permeability. The tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) was detected in a rat model of controlled cortical impact (CCI) and CCI + transection of the cervical sympathetic trunk (TCST). Changes in pulmonary capillary permeability were assessed by analyzing the Evans blue, measuring the dry/wet weight ratio of the lungs and altering protein levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). The parallel-plate flow chamber system was used to simulate the fluid shear stress in vitro. Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining were used to determine the expression levels of hyaluronan-binding protein (CEMIP), syndecan-1 and tight junction proteins (TJPs, including claudin-5 and occludin). TCST could restrain cardiac overdrive and sympathetic activation in a rat model of CCI. Compared to the CCI group, the CCI + TCST group showed a reduction of CEMPI (which degrades hyaluronic acid), along with an increase of syndecan-1 and TJPs. CCI + TCST group presented decreasing pulmonary capillary permeability. In vitro, high shear stress (HSS) increased the expression of CEMIP and reduced syndecan-1 and TJPs, which was coordinated with the results in vivo. Our findings show that sympathetic activation-mediated high fluid shear stress after ABI would damage pulmonary endothelial glycocalyx thus leading to increased pulmonary capillary permeability.

Abstract: In vitro differentiation of stem cells into various cell lineages is valuable in developmental studies and an important source of cells for modelling physiology and pathology, particularly for complex tissues such as the brain. Conventional protocols for in vitro neuronal differentiation often suffer from complicated procedures, high variability and low reproducibility. Over the last decade, the identification of cell fate-determining transcription factors has provided new tools for cellular studies in neuroscience and enabled rapid differentiation driven by ectopic transcription factor expression. As a proneural transcription factor, Neurogenin 2 (Ngn2) expression alone is sufficient to trigger rapid and robust neurogenesis from pluripotent cells. Here, we established a stable cell line, by piggyBac (PB) transposition, that conditionally expresses Ngn2 for generation of excitatory neurons from mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) using an all-in-one PB construct. Our results indicate that Ngn2-induced excitatory neurons have mature and functional characteristics consistent with previous studies using conventional differentiation methods. This approach provides an all-in-one PB construct for rapid and high copy number gene delivery of dox-inducible transcription factors to induce differentiation. This approach is a valuable in vitro cell model for disease modeling, drug screening and cell therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Chondrosarcomas represent the second most common primary bone malignancy. Despite the vulnerability of chondrosarcoma cells to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) depletion, targeting the NAD+ synthesis pathway remains challenging due to broad implications in biological processes. Here, we establish SIRT1 as a central mediator reinforcing the dependency of chondrosarcoma cells on NAD+ metabolism via HIF-2α-mediated transcriptional reprogramming. SIRT1 knockdown abolishes aggressive phenotypes of chondrosarcomas in orthotopically transplanted tumors in mice. Chondrosarcoma cells thrive under glucose starvation by accumulating NAD+ and subsequently activating the SIRT1-HIF-2α axis. Decoupling this link via SIRT1 inhibition unleashes apoptosis and suppresses tumor progression in conjunction with chemotherapy. Unsupervised clustering analysis identifies a high-risk chondrosarcoma patient subgroup characterized by the upregulation of NAD+ biosynthesis genes. Finally, SIRT1 inhibition abolishes HIF-2α transcriptional activity and sensitizes chondrosarcoma cells to doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity, irrespective of underlying pathways to accumulate intracellular NAD+. We provide system-level guidelines to develop therapeutic strategies for chondrosarcomas.

Abstract: Summary
Our previous study identified 52 antiplasmodial peptaibols isolated from fungi. To understand their antiplasmodial mechanism of action, we conducted phenotypic assays, assessed the in vitro evolution of resistance, and performed a transcriptome analysis of the most potent peptaibol, HZ NPDG-I. HZ NPDG-I and 2 additional peptaibols were compared for their killing action and stage dependency, each showing a loss of digestive vacuole (DV) content via ultrastructural analysis. HZ NPDG-I demonstrated a stepwise increase in DV pH, impaired DV membrane permeability, and the ability to form ion channels upon reconstitution in planar membranes. This compound showed no signs of cross resistance to targets of current clinical candidates, and 3 independent lines evolved to resist HZ NPDG-I acquired nonsynonymous changes in the P. falciparum multidrug resistance transporter, pfmdr1. Conditional knockdown of PfMDR1 showed varying effects to other peptaibol analogs, suggesting differing sensitivity.

Abstract: Summary
Peptides play a crucial role in regulating various cellular processes through protein-peptide interactions (PpIs), offering promising avenues for therapeutic development. However, the reliable prediction of PpIs faces challenges in generating high-quality protein-peptide structures for large-scale modeling. Despite recent advancements in deep learning (DL) techniques, many predicted structures lack the necessary accuracy for efficient peptide screening. To address this, we propose a template-based PpI structure modeling pipeline, optimizing the accuracy-speed trade-off. In addition, we present a DL-based PpI prediction framework, called the Interaction Transformer Net (ITN), to detect PpIs at the residue level. The ITN model trained on the structures generated by our pipeline achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) predictions on peptide-SH3 systems (average AUC = 0.88) and is comparable with the SOTA sequence-based prediction methods for peptide-MHC I (average AUC = 0.92), implying that ITN is a powerful tool for PpI prediction and may help advance vaccine design and peptide drug development.

Abstract: Summary
Iron overload, characterized by accumulation of iron in tissues, induces a multiorgan toxicity whose mechanisms are not fully understood. Using cultured cell lines, Caenorhabditis elegans, and mice, we found that ferroptosis occurs in the context of iron-overload-mediated damage. Exogenous oleic acid protected against iron-overload-toxicity in cell culture and Caenorhabditis elegans by suppressing ferroptosis. In mice, oleic acid protected against FAC-induced liver lipid peroxidation and damage. Oleic acid changed the cellular lipid composition, characterized by decreased levels of polyunsaturated fatty acyl phospholipids and decreased levels of ether-linked phospholipids. The protective effect of oleic acid in cells was attenuated by GW6471 (PPAR-α antagonist), as well as in Caenorhabditis elegans lacking the nuclear hormone receptor NHR-49 (a PPAR-α functional homologue). These results highlight ferroptosis as a driver of iron-overload-mediated damage, which is inhibited by oleic acid. This monounsaturated fatty acid represents a potential therapeutic approach to mitigating organ damage in iron overload individuals.

Abstract: Summary
The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a heterogeneous ecosystem containing cancer cells, immune cells, stromal cells, cytokines, and chemokines which together govern tumor progression and response to immunotherapies. Methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3), a core catalytic subunit for RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification, plays a crucial role in regulating various physiological and pathological processes. Whether and how METTL3 regulates the TME and anti-tumor immunity in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain poorly understood. Here, we report that METTL3 elevates expression of pro-tumorigenic chemokines including CXCL1, CXCL5, and CCL20, and destabilizes PD-L1 mRNA in an m6A-dependent manner, thereby shaping a non-inflamed TME. Thus, inhibiting METTL3 reprograms a more inflamed TME that renders anti-PD-1 therapy more effective in several murine lung tumor models. Clinically, NSCLC patients who exhibit low-METTL3 expression have a better prognosis when receiving anti-PD-1 therapy. Collectively, our study highlights targeting METTL3 as a promising strategy to improve immunotherapy in NSCLC patients.

Abstract: Summary
The structure of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is altered in the blood of patients with cancer. From whole-genome sequencing, we retrieve the cfDNA fragment-end composition using a new software (FrEIA [fragment end integrated analysis]), as well as the cfDNA size and tumor fraction in three independent cohorts (n = 925 cancer from >10 types and 321 control samples). At 95% specificity, we detect 72% cancer samples using at least one cfDNA measure, including 64% early-stage cancer (n = 220). cfDNA detection correlates with a shorter overall (p = 0.0086) and recurrence-free (p = 0.017) survival in patients with resectable esophageal adenocarcinoma. Integrating cfDNA measures with machine learning in an independent test set (n = 396 cancer, 90 controls) achieve a detection accuracy of 82% and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.96. In conclusion, harnessing the biological features of cfDNA can improve, at no extra cost, the diagnostic performance of liquid biopsies.

Abstract: Summary
Hyperpolarization-activated and cyclic-nucleotide-gated 1 (HCN1) ion channels are proposed to be critical for cognitive function through regulation of synaptic integration. However, resolving the precise role of HCN1 in neurophysiology and exploiting its therapeutic potential has been hampered by minimally selective antagonists with poor potency and limited in vivo efficiency. Using automated electrophysiology in a small-molecule library screen and chemical optimization, we identified a primary carboxamide series of potent and selective HCN1 inhibitors with a distinct mode of action. In cognition-relevant brain circuits, selective inhibition of native HCN1 produced on-target effects, including enhanced excitatory postsynaptic potential summation, while administration of a selective HCN1 inhibitor to rats recovered decrement working memory. Unlike prior non-selective HCN antagonists, selective HCN1 inhibition did not alter cardiac physiology in human atrial cardiomyocytes or in rats. Collectively, selective HCN1 inhibitors described herein unmask HCN1 as a potential target for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in brain disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Gene-environment interactions shape behavior and susceptibility to depression. However, little is known about the signaling pathways integrating genetic and environmental inputs to impact neurobehavioral outcomes. We report that gut G-protein-coupled receptor, Gpr35, engages a microbe-to-brain metabolic pathway to modulate neuronal plasticity and depressive behavior in mice. Psychological stress decreases intestinal epithelial Gpr35, genetic deletion of which induces depressive-like behavior in a microbiome-dependent manner. Gpr35−/− mice and individuals with depression have increased Parabacteroides distasonis, and its colonization to wild-type mice induces depression. Gpr35−/− and Parabacteroides distasonis-colonized mice show reduced indole-3-carboxaldehyde (IAld) and increased indole-3-lactate (ILA), which are produced from opposing branches along the bacterial catabolic pathway of tryptophan. IAld and ILA counteractively modulate neuroplasticity in the nucleus accumbens, a brain region linked to depression. IAld supplementation produces anti-depressant effects in mice with stress or gut epithelial Gpr35 deficiency. Together, these findings elucidate a gut microbe-brain signaling mechanism that underlies susceptibility to depression.

Abstract: Disrupted intestinal barrier homeostasis is fundamental to inflammatory bowel disease. Thymosin β4 (Tβ4) improves inflammation and has beneficial effects in dry-eye diseases, but its effects on the intestinal mucus barrier remain unknown. Therefore, this study evaluated the underlying regulatory mechanisms and effects of Tβ4 by examining Tβ4 expression in a mouse model with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis and colonic barrier damage. Additionally, we intraperitoneally injected C57BL/6 mice with Tβ4 to assess barrier function, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3II) protein expression, and autophagy. Finally, normal human colon tissue and colon carcinoma cells (Caco2) were cultured to verify Tβ4-induced barrier function and autophagy changes. Mucin2 levels decreased, microbial infiltration increased, and Tβ4 expression increased in the colitis mouse model versus the control mice, indicating mucus barrier damage. Moreover, Tβ4-treated C57BL/6 mice had damaged intestinal mucus barriers and decreased LC3II levels. Tβ4 also inhibited colonic mucin2 production, disrupted tight junctions, and downregulated autophagy; these results were confirmed in Caco2 cells and normal human colon tissue. In summary, Tβ4 may be implicated in colitis by compromising the integrity of the intestinal mucus barrier and inhibiting autophagy. Thus, Tβ4 could be a new diagnostic marker for intestinal barrier defects.

Abstract: Summary
Natural competence is the principal driver of streptococcal evolution. While acquisition of new traits could facilitate rapid fitness improvement for bacteria, entry into the competent state is a highly orchestrated event, involving an interplay between various pathways. We present a new type of competence-predation coordination mechanism in Streptococcus sanguinis. Unlike other streptococci that mediate competence through the ComABCDE regulon, several key components are missing in the S. sanguinis ComCDE circuitry. We assembled two synthetic biology devices linking competence-stimulating peptide (CSP) cleavage and export with a quantifiable readout to unravel the unique features of the S. sanguinis circuitry. Our results revealed the ComC precursor cleavage pattern and the two host ABC transporters implicated in the export of the S. sanguinis CSP. Moreover, we discovered a ComCDE-dependent bacteriocin locus. Overall, this study presents a mechanism for commensal streptococci to maximize transformation outcome in a fluid environment through extensive circuitry rewiring.

Abstract: Summary
Reduced sulfatide level is found in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients. Here, we demonstrate that amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing regulates sulfatide synthesis and vice versa. Different cell culture models and transgenic mice models devoid of APP processing or in particular the APP intracellular domain (AICD) reveal that AICD decreases Gal3st1/CST expression and subsequently sulfatide synthesis. In return, sulfatide supplementation decreases Aβ generation by reducing β-secretase (BACE1) and γ-secretase processing of APP. Increased BACE1 lysosomal degradation leads to reduced BACE1 protein level in endosomes. Reduced γ-secretase activity is caused by a direct effect on γ-secretase activity and reduced amounts of γ-secretase components in lipid rafts. Similar changes were observed by analyzing cells and mice brain samples deficient of arylsulfatase A responsible for sulfatide degradation or knocked down in Gal3st1/CST. In line with these findings, addition of sulfatides to brain homogenates of AD patients resulted in reduced γ-secretase activity. Human brain APP level shows a significant negative correlation with GAL3ST1/CST expression underlining the in vivo relevance of sulfatide homeostasis in AD.

Abstract: Summary
Multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are often developed for the same indication. However, their relative overall efficacy is frequently incompletely understood and they may harbor unrecognized targets that cooperate with the intended target. We compared several ROS1 TKIs for inhibition of ROS1-fusion-positive lung cancer cell viability, ROS1 autophosphorylation and kinase activity, which indicated disproportionately higher cellular potency of one TKI, lorlatinib. Quantitative chemical and phosphoproteomics across four ROS1 TKIs and differential network analysis revealed that lorlatinib uniquely impacted focal adhesion signaling. Functional validation using pharmacological probes, RNA interference, and CRISPR-Cas9 knockout uncovered a polypharmacology mechanism of lorlatinib by dual targeting ROS1 and PYK2, which form a multiprotein complex with SRC. Rational multi-targeting of this complex by combining lorlatinib with SRC inhibitors exhibited pronounced synergy. Taken together, we show that systems pharmacology-based differential network analysis can dissect mixed canonical/non-canonical polypharmacology mechanisms across multiple TKIs enabling the design of rational drug combinations.

Abstract: Objective
A wide range of cardiac diseases is associated with inflammation. “Inflamed” heart tissue is infiltrated with pro-inflammatory macrophages which extensively secrete matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), a regulator of extracellular matrix turnover. As MMP9 is released from macrophages in a latent form, it requires activation. The present study addresses the role of cardiomyocytes in the course of this activation process.
Methods and results
In mono- and co-cultures of pro-inflammatory rat macrophages (bone marrow-derived and peritoneal) and cardiomyocytes (H9C2 cell line) gelatin zymography demonstrated that activated macrophages robustly secreted latent pro-MMP9, whereas cardiomyocytes could not produce the enzyme. Co-culturing of the two cell species was critical for pro-MMP9 activation and was also accompanied by processing of cardiomyocyte-secreted pro-MMP2. A cascade of pro-MMP9 activation was initiated on macrophage membrane with pro-MMP2 cleavage. Namely, pro-inflammatory macrophages expressed an active membrane type 1 MMP (MT1MMP), which activated pro-MMP2, which in turn converted pro-MMP9. Downregulation of MT1MMP in macrophages by siRNA abolished activation of both pro-MMP2 and pro-MMP9 in co-culture. In addition, both cell species secreted MMP13 as a further pro-MMP9 activator. In co-culture, activation of pro-MMP13 occurred on membranes of macrophages and was enhanced in presence of active MMP2. Using incubations with recombinant MMPs and isolated macrophage membranes, we demonstrated that while both MMP2 and MMP13 individually had the ability to activate pro-MMP9, their combined action provided a synergistic effect.
Conclusion
Activation of pro-MMP9 in a co-culture of pro-inflammatory macrophages and cardiomyocytes was the result of a complex interaction of several MMPs on the cell membrane and in the extracellular space. Both cell types contributed critically to pro-MMP9 processing.

Abstract: Summary
The prevalence of heart failure (HF) subtypes, which are classified by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), demonstrate significant sex differences. Here, we perform sex-stratified genome-wide association studies (GWASs) on LVEF and transcriptome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) on LVEF, all-cause HF, HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The sex-stratified GWASs of LVEF identified three sex-specific loci that were exclusively detected in the sex-stratified GWASs. Three drug target genes show sex-differential effects on HF/HFrEF via influencing LVEF, with NPR2 as the target gene for the HF drug Cenderitide under phase 2 clinical trial. Our study highlights the importance of considering sex-differential genetic effects in sex-balanced diseases such as HF and emphasizes the value of sex-stratified GWASs and MR in identifying putative genetic variants, causal genes, and candidate drug targets for HF, which is not identifiable using a sex-combined strategy.

Abstract: Summary
Master transcription factors such as TP63 establish super-enhancers (SEs) to drive core transcriptional networks in cancer cells, yet the spatiotemporal regulation of SEs within the nucleus remains unknown. The nuclear pore complex (NPC) may tether SEs to the nuclear pore where RNA export rates are maximal. Here, we report that NUP153, a component of the NPC, anchors SEs to the NPC and enhances TP63 expression by maximizing mRNA export. This anchoring is mediated through protein-protein interaction between the intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of NUP153 and the coactivator BRD4. Silencing of NUP153 excludes SEs from the nuclear periphery, decreases TP63 expression, impairs cellular growth, and induces epidermal differentiation of squamous cell carcinoma. Overall, this work reveals the critical roles of NUP153 IDRs in the regulation of SE localization, thus providing insights into a new layer of gene regulation at the epigenomic and spatial level.

Abstract: Summary
This study presents a multi-method characterization of a commercial 1.2 Ah 18650 sodium-ion battery cell. Many characterization methods used for lithium-ion batteries can be applied to sodium-ion-based cells. Analytical methods, such as ICP-OES and EDX measurements, are in good agreement with the XRD experiment and show high shares of Fe and Mn within the Mn/Fe/Ni-based layered oxide cathode. This enables a low-cost sodium-ion battery. Mercury porosimetry reveals high porosities. Electrical characterization highlights the high-power capabilities of this cell as well as an acceptable transferability of diagnostic algorithms. Despite higher charging currents having no detrimental effect on capacity retention, excessive electrolyte decomposition triggers the cell’s current interrupt device, preventing a profound lifetime analysis. This early commercial sodium-ion cell is a low-cost solution for high-power applications. Overall, the characterization of a commercial 1.2 Ah 18650 sodium-ion battery cell benefits from the established methods for characterization of lithium-ion battery.

Abstract: The endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) stimulates adipogenesis via the cannabinoid receptor CB1 in adipose stromal cells (ASCs). However, AEA interacts also with nonclassical cannabinoid receptors, including transient receptor potential cation channel (TRPV)1 and G protein-coupled receptor (GPR)55. Their roles in AEA mediated adipogenesis of human ASCs have not been investigated. We examined the receptor-expressions by immunostaining on human ASCs and tested their functionality by measuring the expression of immediate early genes (IEGs) related to the transcription factor-complex AP-1 upon exposition to receptor agonists. Cells were stimulated with increasing concentrations of specific ligands to investigate the effects on ASC viability (proliferation and metabolic activity), secretory activity, and AEA mediated differentiation. ASCs expressed both receptors, and their activation suppressed IEG expression. TRPV1 did not affect viability or cytokine secretion. GPR55 decreased proliferation, and it inhibited the release of hepatocyte growth factor. Blocking GPR55 increased the pro-adipogenic activity of AEA. These data suggest that GPR55 functions as negative regulator of cannabinoid mediated pro-adipogenic capacity in ASCs.

Abstract: Summary
Microwave dielectric ceramics (MWDCs) are essential in low-temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) technology, necessitating a low sintering temperature, low dielectric constant (εr), and high quality factor (Qf). On the other hand, the mismatch in the coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs) between MWDCs and electrodes poses reliability challenges. Here, we report BaF2-LiF ceramics to address the need for low-εr, high-Qf materials with high CTEs. The BaF2-LiF ceramics exhibit improved properties, including a substantial decrease in sintering temperature from 1,025°C to 700°C, enhanced relative density from 90.8% to 97.3%, and optimized Qf values increased by 20%. Moreover, the resulting ceramics demonstrate a high CTE of 20.6 ppm/°C, ensuring compatibility with polymer-based laminates and metal electrodes. Additionally, the BaF2-LiF ceramics serve as a promising dielectric resonator for high-performance millimeter-wave antennas. This study presents a comprehensive approach to optimize BaF2 ceramics, addressing key parameters for high-reliability LTCC electronics and millimeter-wave antenna applications.

Abstract: Summary
Various biological agents have been developed to target tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and its receptor TNFR1 for the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment, whereas small molecules modulating such cytokine receptors are rarely reported in comparison to the biologicals. Here, by revealing the mechanism of action of vinigrol, a diterpenoid natural product, we show that inhibition of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI, PDIA1) by small molecules activates A disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17) and then leads to the TNFR1 shedding on mouse and human cell membranes. This small-molecule-induced receptor shedding not only effectively blocks the inflammatory response caused by TNF-α in cells, but also reduces the arthritic score and joint damage in the collagen-induced arthritis mouse model. Our study indicates that targeting the PDI-ADAM17 signaling module to regulate the shedding of cytokine receptors by the chemical approach constitutes a promising strategy for alleviating RA.

Abstract: Summary
CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPβ) induces primary v-Abl immortalized mouse B cells to transdifferentiate (BT, B cell transdifferentiation) into granulocyte-macrophage progenitor-like cells (GMPBTs). GMPBTs maintain cytokine-independent self-renewal, lineage choice, and multilineage differentiation. Single-cell transcriptomics demonstrated that GMPBTs comprise a continuum of myelomonopoietic differentiation states that seamlessly fit into state-to-fate maps of normal granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs). Inactivating v-Abl kinase revealed the dependence on activated CSF2-JAK2-STAT5 signaling. Deleting IRF8 diminished monopoiesis and enhanced granulopoiesis while removing C/EBPβ-abrogated self-renewal and granulopoiesis but permitted macrophage differentiation. The GMPBT culture system is easily scalable to explore the basics of GMP biology and lineage commitment and largely reduces ethically and legislatively debatable, labor-intensive, and costly animal experiments.

Abstract: Summary
The inability of antibodies to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a key limitation to their use in diverse applications. One promising strategy is to deliver IgGs using a bispecific BBB shuttle, which involves fusing an IgG to a second affinity ligand that engages a cerebrovascular endothelial target and facilitates transport across the BBB. Nearly all prior efforts have focused on shuttles that target transferrin receptor (TfR-1) despite inherent delivery and safety challenges. Here, we report bispecific antibody shuttles that engage CD98hc, the heavy chain of the large neutral amino acid transporter (LAT1), and efficiently transport IgGs into the brain. Notably, CD98hc shuttles lead to much longer-lived brain retention of IgGs than TfR-1 shuttles while enabling more specific targeting due to limited CD98hc engagement in the brain parenchyma, which we demonstrate for IgGs that either agonize a neuronal receptor (TrkB) or target other endogenous cell-surface proteins on neurons and astrocytes.

Abstract: Summary
The discovery of exercise-regulated circulatory factors has fueled interest in organ crosstalk, especially between skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, and the role in mediating beneficial effects of exercise. We studied the adipose tissue transcriptome in men and women with normal glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes following an acute exercise bout, revealing substantial exercise- and time-dependent changes, with sustained increase in inflammatory genes in type 2 diabetes. We identify oncostatin-M as one of the most upregulated adipose-tissue-secreted factors post-exercise. In cultured human adipocytes, oncostatin-M enhances MAPK signaling and regulates lipolysis. Oncostatin-M expression arises predominantly from adipose tissue immune cell fractions, while the corresponding receptors are expressed in adipocytes. Oncostatin-M expression increases in cultured human Thp1 macrophages following exercise-like stimuli. Our results suggest that immune cells, via secreted factors such as oncostatin-M, mediate a crosstalk between skeletal muscle and adipose tissue during exercise to regulate adipocyte metabolism and adaptation.

Abstract: Autophagy is involved in the entirety of cellular survival, homeostasis and death which becomes more self-evident when its dysregulation is implicated in several pathological conditions. PTEN positively regulates autophagy and like other proteins undergo post-translational modifications. It is crucial to investigate the relationship between PTEN and autophagy as it is generally observed to be negligible in PTEN deficient cancer cells. Here, we have shown that such modifications of PTEN namely sumoylation and phosphorylation upregulates and downregulates autophagy respectively. Transfection of plasmid containing full length PTEN in PTEN-negative prostate cancer cell line PC3, induced autophagy on further starvation. When a sumoylation-deficient mutant of PTEN was transfected and cells were put under similar starvation, a decline in autophagy was observed. On the other hand, cells transfected with phosphorylation-deficient mutant of PTEN showed elevated expression of autophagy. Contrarily, transfection with phosphorylation-mimicking mutant caused reduced expression of autophagy. On further analysis, it was detected that PTEN's association with the plasma membrane was under positive and negative influence from its sumoylation and phosphorylation respectively. This association is integral as it is the foremost site for PTEN to oppose PI3K/AKT pathway and consequently upregulate autophagy. Thus, this study indicates that sumoylation and phosphorylation of PTEN can control autophagy via its cell membrane association.

Abstract: Summary
The spatial localization of RNA within cells is closely related to its function and also involved in cell fate determination. However, the atlas of RNA distribution within cells and dynamic changes during the developmental process are largely unknown. In this study, five subcellular components, including cytoplasmic extract, membrane extract, soluble nuclear extract, chromatin-bound nuclear extract, and cytoskeletal extract, were isolated and the rules of subcellular RNA distribution in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and its change during hESC differentiation are summarized for the first time. The overall distribution patterns of coding and non-coding RNAs are revealed. Interestingly, some developmental genes are found to be transcribed but confined to the chromatin in undifferentiated hESC. Unexpectedly, alternative splicing and polyadenylation endow spatial heterogeneity among different isoforms of the same gene. Finally, the dynamic pattern of RNA distribution during hESC differentiation is characterized, which provides new clues for a comprehensive understanding hESC pluripotency and differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Current immunotherapies provide limited benefits against T cell-depleted tumors, calling for therapeutic innovation. Using multi-omics integration of cancer patient data, we predict a type I interferon (IFN) responseHIGH state of dendritic cell (DC) vaccines, with efficacious clinical impact. However, preclinical DC vaccines recapitulating this state by combining immunogenic cancer cell death with induction of type I IFN responses fail to regress mouse tumors lacking T cell infiltrates. Here, in lymph nodes (LNs), instead of activating CD4+/CD8+ T cells, DCs stimulate immunosuppressive programmed death-ligand 1-positive (PD-L1+) LN-associated macrophages (LAMs). Moreover, DC vaccines also stimulate PD-L1+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). This creates two anatomically distinct niches of PD-L1+ macrophages that suppress CD8+ T cells. Accordingly, a combination of PD-L1 blockade with DC vaccines achieves significant tumor regression by depleting PD-L1+ macrophages, suppressing myeloid inflammation, and de-inhibiting effector/stem-like memory T cells. Importantly, clinical DC vaccines also potentiate T cell-suppressive PD-L1+ TAMs in glioblastoma patients. We propose that a multimodal immunotherapy and vaccination regimen is mandatory to overcome T cell-depleted tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Paired electrolysis is an energy-efficient electrochemical reaction where both anodic and cathodic electron flow directly induces product formation with maximum faradaic efficiency. Herein we report a metal-free convergent pair electro-photochemical strategy to generate radical cation and anion that resulted in the N-alkylation of various N-heterocycles, amines, and sulfonamides. The strategy also facilitated site-selective CH-alkylation of benzo fused morpholine, indolines, and OH- and SH- alkylation of phenols and thiophenols with aryl diazo esters. Mild reaction condition such as 5 mA constant current and 5 W blue LED were sufficient to complete the reaction within 2 h. Late-stage and site-selective alkylation of APIs such as sulfadiazines and privileged scaffolds like sulfonamides and diazepanes have been achieved successfully. This paired photo-electrolysis strategy establishes a new energy-efficient way to achieve important reactions with better productivity and shorter reaction time over the existing strategies.

LRP5 competes for SPOP binding to enhance tumorigenesis mediated by Daxx and PD-L1 in prostate cancer,

Abstract: Genetic factors coordinate with environmental factors to drive the pathogenesis of prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD). SPOP is one of the most mutated genes and LRP5 mediates lipid metabolism that is abnormally altered in PRAD. Here, we investigated the potential cross-talk between SPOP and LRP5 in PRAD. We find a negative correlation between SPOP and LRP5 proteins in PRAD. SPOP knockdown increased LRP5 protein while SPOP overexpression resulted in LRP5 reduction that was fully rescued by proteasome inhibitors. LRP5 intracellular tail has SPOP binding site and the direct interaction between LRP5 and SPOP was confirmed by Co-IP and GST-pulldown. Moreover, LRP5 competed with Daxx for SPOP-mediated degradation, establishing a dynamic balance among SPOP, LRP5 and Daxx. Overexpression of LRP5 tail could shift this balance to enhance Daxx-mediated transcriptional inhibition, and inhibit T cell activity in a co-culture system. Further, we generated human and mouse prostate cancer cell lines expressing SPOP variants (F133V, A227V, R368H). SPOP-F133V and SPOP-A227V have specific effects in up-regulating the protein levels of PD-1 and PD-L1. Consistently, SPOP-F133V and SPOP-A227V show robust inhibitory effects on T cells compared to WT SPOP in co-culture. This is further supported by the mouse syngeneic model showing that SPOP-F133V and SPOP-A227V enhance tumorigenesis of prostate cancer in in-vivo condition. Taken together, our study provides evidence that SPOP-LRP5 crosstalk plays an essential role, and the genetic variants of SPOP differentially modulate the expression and activity of immune checkpoints in prostate cancer.
