Abstract: The optical characterization is reported of a new fluid consisting of single-wall carbon nanohorns and ethylene glycol for solar energy applications. Carbon nanohorns play a significant role in enhancing sunlight absorption with respect to the pure base fluid. The obtained results are compared with those obtained for fluids suspending more conventional carbon forms, i.e. carbon-black particles. We found that nanohorn spectral features are far more favorable than those of amorphous carbon for the specific application. This result shows that carbon nanohorn-based nanofluids can be useful for increasing the efficiency and compactness of thermal solar devices, reducing both environmental impact and costs.

Abstract: Using the first-principles calculations, the band structure, total and partial density of states (DOS) and absorption properties of anatase TiO2, Fe3+ doped TiO2 and FeTiO3 were calculated by a plane-wave pseudopotential method based on density functional theory (DFT). From the calculated results, the band gaps of anatase TiO2, Fe3+ doped TiO2 and FeTiO3 are about 2.4, 0.32 and 0.28eV, respectively. The states of the valence bands and conduction bands of undoped and Fe3+ doped TiO2 with anatase structure were calculated. As shown in the absorption spectra, the FeTiO3 has the strongest absorption and the Fe–TiO2 has the weakest absorption. Effect of Fe3+ dopant on the absorption property of the anatase TiO2 is explained in detail based on the calculations using the first-principles. The Fe3+ doped anatase TiO2 could be a potential candidate for photocatalyst because of the absorption ability of visible light.

Abstract: In this paper, a unique two-step method is developed to fabricate a nano-textured SnO2 coating. Nano-textured topography is successfully introduced at room temperature by evaporating Sn in a relatively high pressure. Nano-textured SnO2 coating is obtained by annealing in air, with lateral size of nearly 1μm and root-mean-roughness of over 140nm. Two structures: substrate and superstrate, are investigated to reveal the light-trapping efficiency. With only 300nm thick Si absorber layer, the average reflectivity under AM 1.5 illumination spectrum can be limited at 14% and 7%, respectively. This technology is suitable for mass production.

Abstract: The optical absorption coefficient of thin film and bulk Cu2O at room temperature is obtained from an accurate analysis of their transmittance and reflectance spectra. These absorption spectra are modeled, together with the low temperature data reported in the literature, using an analytical expression to assess and quantify the role of the different absorption mechanisms. The results suggest that direct forbidden transitions and indirect transitions play an almost equally relevant role. A table of the optical constants of Cu2O single crystal is given for reference.

Abstract: We studied the optical and semiconductor–metal (S–M) transition properties of ZnO:Al/VO2/substrate double-layered films that consisted of a ZnO:Al top layer and a VO2 bottom layer. ZnO:Al and VO2 films were grown on fused silica substrates by radio frequency magnetron sputtering and polymer-assisted deposition, respectively. The ZnO:Al/VO2/substrate films displayed low emissivity (0.31–0.32) with integrated luminous transmittance (Tlum>46%) and thermochromic properties (ΔTsol>4.1%). The low emissivity and thermochromic properties were independently introduced by the transparent conductive ZnO:Al layer and the VO2 layer. In addition, the S–M transition temperatures for VO2 shifted to lower temperatures after the ZnO:Al deposition process, which was due to the formation of surface nonstoichiometry—oxygen deficiency that was induced by the ZnO:Al deposition process.

Abstract: A series of novel conjugated polymers containing alternating electron-donating and electron-accepting units based on 9,9-dioctylfluorene, 4,7-dithienyl-2-yl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole, and (oligo)thiophene were synthesized. The polymers were synthesized by the Suzuki cross-coupling polymerization of 9,9-dioctylfluorene-2,7-diboronic acid and 4,7-di(2-bromothien-5-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole with dibromo(oligo)thiophene (thiophene, bithiophene, and terthiophene). Optical properties of the copolymers were highly dependent on the length of the (oligo)thiophene unit. With the incorporation of three thiophene units in the polymer backbone, the copolymer absorption covers a broad range of the visible spectrum from 300 to 700nm. The band gap energies derived from the absorption edge of the thin film spectra were in the range of 1.83–1.94eV. The photovoltaic performance increases as the length of the (oligo)thiophene segments in the polymer backbone increases. The best performance of photovoltaic device was obtained by PFTBzTTT as the electron donor material with PCE of 1.25% under an AM 1.5 solar simulator.

Basic fibroblast growth factor regulates glucose metabolism through glucose transporter 1 induced by hypoxia-inducible factor-1α in adipocytes,

Abstract: Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), which is a transcription factor that enhances glycolysis in cells in response to hypoxia, is induced in hypertrophied adipocytes in obesity. Recent studies have shown that growth factors are able to induce HIF-1α by mechanisms independent of hypoxia. Since basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), an angiogenic factor, is concentrated in expanding adipose tissue, the possible effects of bFGF on regulation of HIF-1α in adipocytes were investigated. Treatment of differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes with bFGF induced HIF-1α. Concomitantly, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), which is a target gene of HIF-1α, was induced at both mRNA and protein levels and was translocated to the plasma membrane. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and an RNA interference study indicated that bFGF-induced HIF-1α directly upregulates GLUT1. In addition, it was observed that bFGF increases lactate production of adipocytes. This result indicates that bFGF reprograms the metabolism toward glycolysis. Intraperitoneal injection of bFGF into mice upregulated HIF-1α and GLUT1 in adipose tissues, suggesting that bFGF regulates the metabolism of adipocytes via HIF-1α–GLUT1 regulation in vivo. We also found that bFGF inhibits insulin-induced phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 and Akt, suggesting that bFGF attenuates the insulin signal in adipocytes. Taken together, the findings suggest that bFGF has a harmful effect on the development of type 2 diabetes through metabolism reprogramming and attenuation of the insulin signal.

Abstract: Nano-structured Cu2O/ZnO nanorod (NR) heterojunction solar cells fabricated on indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass are studied. Substrate film and NR density have a strong influence on the preferred growth of the Cu2O film. The X-ray diffractometer (XRD) analysis results show that highly (200)-preferred Cu2O film was formed when plating on plain ITO substrate. However, a highly (111)-preferred Cu2O film was obtained when plating on sparse ZnO NRs. SEM, TEM and XRD studies on sparse NR samples indicate that the Cu2O nano-crystallites mostly initiate its nucleation on the peripheral surfaces of the ZnO NRs, and are also highly (111)-oriented. Solar cells with ZnO NRs yielded much higher efficiency than those without. In addition, ZnO NRs plated on a ZnO-coated ITO glass significantly improve the shunt resistance and open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the devices, with consistently much higher efficiency obtained than when ZnO NRs are directly plated on ITO film. However, longer NRs do not improve the efficiency due to low short-circuit current (Jsc) and slightly higher series resistance. The best conversion efficiency of 0.56% was obtained from a Cu2O/ZnO NRs heterojunction solar cell fabricated on a 80nm ZnO-coated ITO glass with Voc=0.514V, Jsc=2.64mA/cm2 and 41.5% fill factor.

Abstract: Tumor progression involves the acquisition of invasiveness through a basement membrane. The c-jun proto-oncogene is overexpressed in human tumors and has been identified at the leading edge of human breast tumors. TGF-β plays a bifunctional role in tumorigenesis and cellular migration. Although c-Jun and the activator protein 1 (AP-1) complex have been implicated in human cancer, the molecular mechanisms governing cellular migration via c-Jun and the role of c-Jun in TGF-β signaling remains poorly understood. Here, we analyze TGF-β mediated cellular migration in mouse embryo fibroblasts using floxed c-jun transgenic mice. We compared the c-jun wild type with the c-jun knockout cells through the use of Cre recombinase. Herein, TGF-β stimulated cellular migration and intracellular calcium release requiring endogenous c-Jun. TGF-β mediated Ca2+ release was independent of extracellular calcium and was suppressed by both U73122 and neomycin, pharmacological inhibitors of the breakdown of PIP2 into IP3. Unlike TGF-β-mediated Ca2+ release, which was c-Jun dependent, ATP mediated Ca2+ release was c-Jun independent. These studies identify a novel pathway by which TGF-β regulates cellular migration and Ca2+ release via endogenous c-Jun.

Abstract: A novel form-stable composite as phase change material (PCM) for thermal energy storage was prepared by absorbing capric acid (CA) into halloysite nanotube (HNT). The composite PCM was characterized by TEM, FT-IR and DSC analysis techniques. The composite can contain capric acid as high as 60wt% and maintain its original shape perfectly without any CA leakage after subjected to 50 melt-freeze cycles. The melting temperature and latent heat of composite (CA/HNT: 60/40wt%) were determined as 29.34°C and 75.52J/g by DSC. Graphite (G) was added into the composite to improve thermal storage performance and the thermal storage and release rates were increased by 1.8 times and 1.7 times compared with the composite without graphite, respectively. Due to its high adsorption capacity of CA, high heat storage capacity, good thermal stability, low cost and simple preparation method, the composite can be considered as cost-effective latent heat storage material for practical applications such as solar energy storage, building energy conservation and agricultural greenhouse in the near future.

The water concentration was observed to strongly affect the vanadium oxidation state and the morphological characteristics of the films. The importance of achieving single-phase of a particular oxidation state towards the improvement of the electrochemical performance of thin films grown by atmospheric pressure CVD is highlighted.

Abstract: This paper introduces a photoluminescence-based technique for determining the acceptor concentration in silicon wafers by measuring the formation rate of iron-acceptor pairs. This rate is monitored by band-to-band photoluminescence in low injection, the intensity of which is proportional to the carrier lifetime. The technique is demonstrated with an iron-implanted float zone silicon wafer, heavily compensated Czochralski-grown silicon wafers with iron contamination and an upgraded metallurgical-grade silicon wafer containing natural iron. The FeB pairing rates measured on the float zone sample at different temperatures yield an activation energy that correlates closely to the migration enthalpy associated with the diffusion of iron in silicon, confirming that the changes observed are indeed due to iron-acceptor pairing. The acceptor concentrations determined in the strongly compensated Czochralski-grown silicon wafers and the upgraded metallurgical silicon wafer using the new technique were consistent with the values obtained by the Quasi-Steady-State Photo Conductance lifetime measurement technique and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy respectively, thus proving its usefulness.

Abstract: For different process conditions, series of hydrogenated amorphous silicon p-i-n solar cells with various oxygen concentrations in the intrinsic absorber layer were fabricated by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition at 13.56MHz using process gas mixtures of SiH4 and H2. Oxygen was introduced into the gas phase during the deposition process by a controllable leak in the chamber wall and the amount of oxygen supply is characterized by the oxygen base pressure pb. It is found that for a certain deposition regime defined by silane and H2 flows, deposition pressure and substrate temperature the oxygen incorporation follows an expected dependence on the ratio pb/rd with rd the deposition rate. This relation is not valid for the comparison of different deposition regimes. A high hydrogen flow is found to reduce the oxygen incorporation strongly. The photovoltaic parameters of the solar cells were measured in the initial state as well as after 1000h of light-soaking. The critical oxygen concentration (i.e. the upper limit of incorporated oxygen not leading to a decay of the solar cell performance) was determined for each regime in the initial and light-soaked state. For all deposition regimes, the results show no difference in these critical oxygen concentrations for the initial and light-soaked state. The critical oxygen concentration, is found to differ for the different process regimes and turns out to be the highest (approximately 1×1020cm−3) for the deposition regime with the highest hydrogen flow rate, which interestingly is the regime with the lowest oxygen incorporation at a given pb/rd ratio. This combination makes the regime of high hydrogen gas flow suitable for depositing high-efficiency solar cells at high base pressure.

Abstract: A new sensitizer molecule, HMBI (9,18-(di-2-hexyldecyl)-2,11-dimethoxy-9,18-dihydrobenzo[5,6]-s-indaceno[1,2-b]indeno[2,1-h]carbazol-6,15-dione), containing electron-donating carbazole and electron-accepting diketone units, has been synthesized for solution-processed bulk heterojunction organic solar cells. The HMBI material has good solubility in common organic solvents. Its HOMO and LUMO energy levels were found to be at 5.6 and 3.0eV, respectively. It has absorption bands ranging from 300 to 500nm. Dispersion of HMBI molecules in the P3HT/PCBM blend broadens the absorption bands over the spectral range of 350–500nm. Uniform thin film devices doped with varying concentration of HMBI, incorporated within the P3HT/PCBM blend, were fabricated. The 3wt% of HMBI doping produces an improvement in power-conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 11.5% compared with the reference P3HT/PCBM device. Efficient light harvesting caused by HMBI sensitizer molecules primarily yields increased carrier generation and short-circuit current. In addition, some morphological improvements in the P3HT/PCBM system may contribute to the generation of enhanced photocurrent.

Abstract: Interleukin (IL) 33 has been recently identified as a ligand to the ST2 receptor that mediates Th2-dominant allergic inflammation. The purpose of this study was to explore the role of toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated innate immunity in IL-33 induction by mucosal epithelium. Human corneal tissues and cultured primary human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs) were treated with a variety of viral or bacterial components without or with different inhibitors to evaluate the IL-33 regulation and signaling pathways. The level of mRNA expression was determined by reverse transcription and real time PCR, and protein was measured by ELISA, immunostaining and Western blotting. IL-33 mRNA and protein were largely induced by various microbial components, mainly by polyI:C and flagellin, the ligands to TLR3 and TLR5, respectively in human corneal epithelium ex vivo and in vitro cultures. Pro-IL-33 protein was normally restricted inside cells, and could be secreted outside when activated by ATP. The PolyI:C induced IL-33 production was blocked by TLR3 antibody or TRIF Inhibitory peptide, while flagellin stimulated IL-33 was blocked by TLR5 antibody or MyD88 Inhibitory peptide. Interestingly, IκB-α inhibitor (BAY11-7082) or NF-κB inhibitor (quinazoline) blocked NF-κB p65 protein nuclear translocation, and suppressed IL-33 production induced by PolyI:C and flagellin. These findings demonstrate that IL-33, an epithelium-derived pro-allergic cytokine, is induced by microbial ligands through TLR-mediated innate signaling pathways, suggesting a possible role of mucosal epithelium in Th2-dominant allergic inflammation.

Abstract: This paper proposes and experimentally demonstrates an a-Si:H random nanocone/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM hybrid solar cell to extend the absorption to near infrared and solve the difficulty of carrier transport through organic–inorganic interface. The internal electrical field inside a-Si:H random nanocone force holes move to the anode and electrons move to the cathode. The insertion of a layer of PEDOT:PSS conducting polymer between organic–inorganic interface could cause electrons and holes to partially recombine, thus establishing an electrically connected a-Si:H and P3HT:PCBM bulk heterojunction, which enables carriers transport through organic–inorganic interfaces efficiently. As compared to conventional polymer solar cells, the open-circuit voltage of hybrid solar cells was increased from 0.51 to 0.78V. Additionally, the power conversion efficiency was increased from 1.73% to 2.22%, which demonstrates approximately 28% enhancement, indicating that the hybrid structure could largely increase the efficiency of polymer solar cells.

Abstract: The transfer of cholesterol to mitochondria, which might involve the phosphorylation of proteins, is the rate-limiting step in human placental steroidogenesis. Protein kinase A (PKA) activity and its role in progesterone synthesis by human placental mitochondria were assessed in this study. The results showed that PKA and phosphotyrosine phosphatase D1 are associated with syncytiotrophoblast mitochondrial membrane by an anchoring kinase cAMP protein-121. The 32P-labeled of four major proteins was analyzed. The specific inhibitor of PKA, H89, decreased progesterone synthesis in mitochondria while in mitochondrial steroidogenic contact sites protein-phosphorylation was diminished, suggesting that PKA plays a role in placental hormone synthesis. In isolated mitochondria, PKA activity was unaffected by the addition of cAMP suggesting a constant activity of this kinase in the syncytiotrophoblast. The presence of PKA and phosphotyrosine phosphatase D1 anchored to mitochondria by an anchoring kinase cAMP protein-121 indicated that syncytiotrophoblast mitochondria contain a full phosphorylation/dephosphorylation system.

Abstract: A new class of triphenylamine substituted methanofullerene derivatives, bis(4'-(diphenylamino)biphenyl-4-yl)methanofullerene (1) and the bisadduct (2), were synthesized. The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) studies revealed that the diphenylamino components have contribution to the photocurrent that expands the light harvesting window around 400nm. When being blended with poly (3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) to fabricate the solar cell, the device of P3HT:1 (1:0.7) shows high open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.69V under the illumination of AM 1.5, 100mW/cm2 with high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.16%, which is about 0.1V higher than that of the corresponding [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) devices. This indicates that the arylamine substituents on 1 have played some special roles on the high Voc performance. Similar effects are also observed for 2. The device of P3HT:2 (1:1) shows even higher Voc of 0.87V with the PCE of 1.83%. These results indicate that 1 and 2 are alternative high performance acceptors.

Abstract: A method is presented herein that allows the determination of the average temperature of solar cells in a concentrator photovoltaic (CPV) module. The module is measured systematically in a sun simulator while the average module temperature and the irradiation are varied. Two different approaches are discussed to heat a CPV module in a sun simulator. From the measurements, a function is derived that allows the derivation of the average solar cell temperature when the I–V curve of the CPV module is measured. Consequently, the module itself can be used as a temperature sensor. Outdoor I–V measurements of different CPV modules are then presented. Their temperatures are calculated by applying the newly developed method. A multi-linear regression is conducted on the data measured outdoors. In particular, the modules’ maximum powers are correlated to direct normal irradiation, the solar spectrum and the average solar cell temperature. The impact of temperature on the module’s maximum power is shown to be significantly smaller than the impact of the solar spectrum. Finally, the maximum power values for the modules are re-calculated for two different rating conditions.

Abstract: In order to improve the transparency and durability of the Cu films deposited on polycarbonate (PC) substrates, a Ga-doped ZnO (GZO) layer could be deposited directly onto the Cu film. Compared with a single-layered GZO film, the GZO/Cu multilayer coatings have much lower sheet resistance and much thinner thickness. In our work, GZO/Cu multilayers were deposited by magnetron sputtering on PC substrates at room temperature. The structural, electrical, and optical properties of multilayers were investigated at various thicknesses of the Cu and GZO layers. As the Cu layer thickness increases, the resistivity decreases. As the GZO layer thickness increases, the resistivity increases. And we obtained that the transmittance of the GZO/Cu multilayer coatings was higher than that of the single Cu layer. The lowest resistivity of 5.7×10−5Ωcm with a carrier concentration of 3.25×1022cm−3 was obtained at the optimum Cu (12nm) and GZO (10nm) layer thickness. The best figure of merit φTC is 4.66×10−3Ω−1 for the GZO(30nm)/Cu(12nm) multilayer.

Abstract: High efficiency organic photovoltaic cells discussed in literature are normally restricted to devices fabricated on glass substrates. This is a consequence of the extreme brittleness and inflexibility of the commonly used transparent conductive oxide electrode, indium tin oxide (ITO). This shortcoming of ITO along with other concerns such as increasing scarcity of indium, migration of indium to organic layer, etc. makes it imperative to move away from ITO. Here we demonstrate a highly flexible Ag electrode that possesses low sheet resistances even in ultra-thin layers. It retains its conductivity under severe bending stresses where ITO fails completely. A P3HT:PCBM blend organic solar cell fabricated on this highly flexible electrode gives an efficiency of 2.3%.

Abstract: After numerically solving the Poisson and continuity equations that characterize the electrical behavior of semiconductor devices, we investigated the loss mechanism in bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs) by simulating intensity-dependent current–voltage curves. Comparison of simulation results with real experimental measurements reveals that monomolecular recombination is the primary loss mechanism in OSCs. This conclusion is consistent with direct observations that bimolecular recombination is significantly suppressed in bulk heterojunction OSCs. The determination of recombination mechanism is important to model and predict the operation of OSCs precisely and further optimize their performance.

Abstract: Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disorder of the vasculature that is orchestrated by the action of cytokines. Macrophages play a prominent role in all stages of this disease, including foam cell formation, production of reactive oxygen species, modulation of the inflammatory response and the regulation of the stability of atherosclerotic plaques. The role of the matrix metalloproteinase family in the control of plaque stability is well established. A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motif (ADAMTS) family has been implicated in several diseases and the expression of ADAMTS-4 in macrophages of atherosclerotic lesions has suggested a potential role for this protease in atherosclerosis. However, the action of cytokines on the expression of ADAMTS-4 in macrophages is poorly understood. We have investigated here the effect of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) on ADAMTS-4 expression in macrophages along with the regulatory mechanisms underlying its actions. Consistent with the anti-atherogenic role of TGF-β, this cytokine decreased the expression of ADAMTS-4 mRNA and protein in human macrophages. Transient transfection assays showed that the −100 to +10 promoter region contained the minimal TGF-β response elements. Small-interfering RNA-mediated knockdown revealed a critical role for Smads, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-Jun in the action of TGF-β on ADAMTS-4 mRNA expression. These studies show for the first time that TGF-β inhibits the expression of ADAMTS-4 in human macrophages and identifies the signalling pathways underlying this response. The inhibition of macrophage ADAMTS-4 expression is likely to contribute to the anti-atherogenic, plaque stabilisation action of TGF-β.

Abstract: A sickle cell disease (SCD) patient with vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) developed sudden senserinural hearing loss (SNHL), which responded well to a rapid course of corticosteroids along with exchange transfusions. The otolaryngologist should be aware of the otologic manifestations of SCD such as SNHL. a good response to steroids, which averted a permanent hearing loss, warrants further studies to define the augmentive benefits of such therapy along with exchange transfusions in patients with SCD in VOC who develop sudden SNHL.

Abstract: Neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) has been implicated in tumor metastasis yet its function in melanoma progression remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that stably silencing NCAM expression in mouse melanoma B16F0 cells perturbs their cellular invasion and metastatic dissemination in vivo. The pro-invasive function of NCAM is exerted via dual mechanisms involving both cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Pharmacologic inhibition of PKA and PI3K leads to impaired cellular invasion. In contrast, forced expression of constitutively activated Akt, the major downstream target of PI3K, restores the defective cellular invasiveness of NCAM knock-down (KD) B16F0 cells. Furthermore, attenuation of either PKA or Akt activity in NCAM KD cells is shown to affect their common downstream target, transcription factor cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), which in turn down-regulates mRNA expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), thus contributes to impaired cellular invasion and metastasis of melanoma cells. Together, these findings indicate that NCAM potentiates cellular invasion and metastasis of melanoma cells through stimulation of PKA and PI3K signaling pathways thus suggesting the potential implication of anti-NCAM strategy in melanoma treatment.

Abstract: A multi-crystalline silicon (Si) ingot was simulated and grown using the improved directional solidification (DS) process. Numerical simulations were performed with two different cooling paths and two different coolant flow rates in order to demonstrate the thermal characteristics in the improved DS furnace during the crystal growth. The temperature distributions in the furnace and locally (at the silicon ingot) were predicted as a function of time. From these result, a multi-crystalline Si ingot weighing 300kg was grown within 40h using the improved DS process. The Si ingot had a grain size that was larger than 5mm, and the structure of the ingot was in the form of vertical columns. From the analysis results, the Si ingot exhibited a resistivity below 2Ωcm and a life time above 3μs.

Abstract: We report performance improvement of organic (P3HT:PCBM) photovoltaic cell by introducing a solution-based WOx anode buffer layer, between the PH500 conducting polymer and the active layer. By introducing a solution-based WOx on PH500, the cell efficiency increases by 13% compared to that of the organic photovoltaic cell with only PH500. The organic cell exhibits JSC of 12.31mA/cm2, VOC of 0.61V, FF of 58.22%, and the power conversion efficiency of 4.35%. The improved cell performance is due to effective hole collection injected from electron donors (P3HT) in P3HT:PCBM active layer by forming WOx nanoparticle on the conducting anode.

Abstract: A large number of flexible polymer solar modules comprising 16 serially connected individual cells was prepared at the experimental workshop at Risø DTU. The photoactive layer was prepared from several varieties of P3HT (Merck, Plextronics, BASF and Risø DTU) and two varieties of ZnO (nanoparticulate, thin film) were employed as electron transport layers. The devices were all tested at Risø DTU and the functional devices were subjected to an inter-laboratory study involving the performance and the stability of modules over time in the dark, under light soaking and outdoor conditions. 24 laboratories from 10 countries and across four different continents were involved in the studies. The reported results allowed for analysis of the variability between different groups in performing lifetime studies as well as performing a comparison of different testing procedures. These studies constitute the first steps toward establishing standard procedures for an OPV lifetime characterization.

Abstract: Crystalline silicon thin-film solar cells were fabricated on graphite substrates. A laser ablation process was developed for edge isolation of the thin-film cells. The shunt resistance was comparable to otherwise identical cells isolated by plasma etching, while the reproducibility of the laser isolation process was higher. The solar cells were characterized by current–voltage and light beam induced current measurements (LBiC). No interference was detected along the ablated edges. Spatial variations of the minority carrier lifetime are attributed to the grain structure of the seeding layer obtained by the zone melting recrystallization (ZMR).

Abstract: Infrared lock-in thermography of an active layer through a glass substrates is demonstrated and explained theoretically. A transition between signal generation close to the active layer and close to the back surface of the substrate is found for glass at 0.5Hz. For higher frequencies, the signal resolution is given by the thermal diffusion length in glass, very similar to direct observation of the active layer. An experimental difficulty is that the signal is strongly influenced by a slow but strong temperature transient in the beginning of the measurement. It is shown how to correct for this effect efficiently.

Abstract: A new series of low bandgap carbazole copolymers containing an electron-withdrawing moiety as a side chain, via Suzuki, Yamamoto, and Stille polymerization reactions has been synthesized. Their bandgaps and molecular energy levels can be tuned by copolymerizing with different conjugated electron-donating units. The resulting copolymers have low optical and electrochemical bandgaps. The optical bandgaps of the copolymers range from 1.79 to 1.24eV. In order to investigate their photovoltaic properties, polymer solar cell devices based on low bandgap copolymers were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/copolymers:PCBM/Al, under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100mW/cm2. The power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of the polymer solar cells based on these low bandgap copolymers were measured. The best performance was obtained by using PC-CARB as the electron donor and 6,6-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the electron acceptor. The PCE of the solar cell based on PC-CARB/P71CBM (1:4) was 1.27% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.65V, and a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 6.69mA/cm2.

Abstract: Human osteosarcoma cell lines were recently shown to express and secrete the small leucine rich proteoglycan (SLRP) lumican, with the ability to regulate the growth and motility of these cells. In this study, lumican-deficient Saos 2 cells were demonstrated to have increased adhesive capability onto fibronectin (FN) (p≤0.01). Upon neutralization of endogenous transforming growth factor β2 (TGF-β2) activity, no difference in the ability of lumican siRNA-transfected and scramble siRNA-transfected Saos 2 cells to adhere onto FN was detected (p=NS). Exogenous TGF-β2 was shown to stimulate Saos 2 cell adhesion to FN (p≤0.01). These results therefore, suggest that the inverse correlation existing between lumican expression and Saos 2 cell adhesion is dependent on active TGF-β2 signaling. Furthermore, the significant increase in Smad 2 activation present in lumican-deficient cells (p≤0.01) was annulled in the presence of the anti-TGF-β2 peptide, demonstrating that lumican is an upstream regulator of the TGF-β2/Smad 2 signaling cascade. Crucial to FN-dependent adhesion, β1 integrin expression and pFAK activation were likewise identified as downstream TGF-β2 effectors regulated by lumican expression. In conclusion, this study demonstrates a novel out-in signaling circuit in human osteosarcoma cells: secreted to extracellular matrix lumican is an endogenous inhibitor of TGF-β2 activity, resulting in downstream effector modulation including pSmad 2, integrin β1 and pFAK to regulate osteosarcoma adhesion.

Abstract: The role of hot carriers in enhancing the radiation resistance of GaAs solar cells has been investigated. The laser-pulse induced, short-circuit current response method was used to study solar cell degradation caused by radiation damage. Samples were subject to radiation doses in the range 1×1014–4×1016electroncm−2 and then probed with laser pulses with 7ns duration and 3.7eV energy. We have developed a non-stationary theory of minority carrier flow in the active region of the solar cell. The theory allows a description of the temporal evolution of the short-circuit current and the dependence on irradiation dose. The model agrees well with experimental results using a single fitting parameter. This parameter is the carrier capture cross-section of radiation center E5 in the p-region emitter of the solar cell. The value of the cross-section was determined to be 0.1×10−12cm2 from the results under non-stationary condition. This is seven times lower than that deduced from the current–voltage characteristics in the dark for a similar solar cell. The difference can be explained by a strong reduction of capture cross-section with increased carrier energy. Our results suggest that the observed cross-section reduction is caused by carrier accumulation at energies comparable with the optical phonon energy.

Abstract: Hepatocyte growth factor modulates activation and antigen-presenting cell function of dendritic cells. However, the molecular basis for immunoregulation of dendritic cells by hepatocyte growth factor is undefined. In the current study, we demonstrate that hepatocyte growth factor exhibits inhibitory effect on dendritic cell activation by blocking IκB kinase activity and subsequent nuclear factor-κB activation. Inhibition of IκB kinase is mediated by hepatocyte growth factor-induced activation of c-Src. Proximal signaling events induced in dendritic cells by hepatocyte growth factor include a physical association of c-Src with the hepatocyte growth factor receptor c-MET and concomitant activation of c-Src. Activation of c-Src in turn establishes a complex consisting of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and c-MET, and promotes downstream activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway and mammalian target of rapamycin. Blocking activation of c-Src, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin prevents hepatocyte growth factor-induced inhibition of IκB kinase, nuclear factor-κB and dendritic cell activation. Notably, hepatocyte growth factor-stimulated c-Src activation results in induction of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complexes p85α/p110α and p85α/p110δ, which is required for activation of mammalian target of rapamycin, and consequent inhibition of IκB kinase and nuclear factor-κB activation. Our findings, for the first time, have identified the c-Src-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin pathway that plays a pivotal role in mediating the inhibitory effects of hepatocyte growth factor on dendritic cell activation by blocking nuclear factor-κB signaling.

Abstract: Co-evaporation of Cu, In, Ga, and Se to form CuIn1−xGaxSe2 is known to yield high efficiency solar cells and modules. Highest efficiencies are achieved when using a multi-stage co-evaporation process, where the Cu–In–Ga–Se film enters a Cu rich composition during an intermediate stage of the growth. Furthermore, incorporation of sodium is crucial for high performance devices. We investigated the influence of varying the evaporation profile, especially the Cu excess during growth, on the microstructure of the final CIGS layer, on the distribution of sodium through the layer, and on the photovoltaic performance. Experiments were performed on CIGS layers grown at substrate temperatures of 450 and 600∘C. With increasing maximum [Cu]/[In+Ga] ratio during the deposition, an increase in grain size of the CuIn1−xGaxSe2 layer is observed. For high temperature grown samples, best efficiencies are achieved using minimal Cu excess during the second stage of the growth process. Results show a change in the sodium distribution across the absorber thickness for layers grown at high temperature when the duration of the Cu rich growth regime is changed. We observed that for layers exposed to a Cu rich regime for a short timeframe, Na accumulates at the surface of the layer while for longer exposure times it is more evenly distributed in the top region of the CIGS layer. Evidence for the suppression of the growth of a group III rich phase (ordered vacancy compound) by Na is found.

Abstract: The blood–brain barrier consists of the cerebral microvascular endothelium, pericytes, astrocytes and neurons. In this study we analyzed the differentiation stage dependent influence of primary porcine brain capillary pericytes on the barrier integrity of primary porcine brain capillary endothelial cells. At first, we were able to induce two distinct differentiation stages of the primary pericytes in vitro. TGFβ treated pericytes expressed more α-SMA and actin while desmin, vimentin and nestin expression was decreased when compared to bFGF induced cells. Further analysis of α-SMA revealed that most of the pericytes differentiated with TGFβ expressed functional α-SMA while only few cells expressed functional α-SMA in the presence of bFGF. In addition the permeability factors VEGF, MMP-2 and MMP-9 were higher secreted by the α-SMA positive phenotype indicating a proangiogenic role of this TGFβ induced pericyte differentiation stage. Higher level of VEGF, MMP-2 and MMP-9 were as well detected in the TGFβ pretreated pericyte coculture with endothelial cells when compared to the influence of the bFGF pretreated pericytes. The TEER measurement of the barrier integrity of endothelial cells revealed that bFGF induced α-SMA negative pericytes stabilize the barrier integrity while α-SMA positive pericytes differentiated by TGFβ decrease the barrier integrity. These results together reveal the potential of pericytes to regulate the endothelial barrier integrity in a differentiation stage dependant pathway.

Abstract: The correlation among the electrical, optical and structural properties of Ag thin films was investigated. Low-emissivity (low-e) coatings consisting of glass/ZnO/Ag were deposited by magnetron sputtering. The ZnO thin films were deposited under various oxygen gas pressures to vary the property of Ag thin films deposited on them. When the ZnO thin films were deposited in low oxygen gas pressure, the Ag thin films deposited on the ZnO thin films exhibited low resistivity and smooth surface. Besides, it was found that the low-emissivity coatings with low visible and near infrared light absorbance were obtained using the low-resistive and smooth Ag thin films. It was concluded from the results that the light absorbance became low with decreasing the resistivity of Ag thin films in accordance with Drude's theory in the case where the Ag thin films exhibited sufficiently smooth surface. Furthermore, it can be considered that the surface plasmon polariton of Ag thin films had an influence on the optical property when their surface became rough. The optical absorbance of the low-e coatings should be determined as the result of the competition between two factors: resistivity and surface roughness of Ag thin films.

Abstract: The anthracyclin antibiotic agent doxorubicin (DXR) has been widely used as a chemotherapeutic drug for more than 40 years, but its clinical use has been limited by its cardiotoxicity. The mechanism of action of DXR remains uncertain and controversial. A series of 1,2-heteroannelated anthraquinones and anthra[1,2-d]imidazole-6,11-dione compounds were synthesized and their cytotoxicity profiles were analyzed using the National Cancer Institute 60 (NCI 60) platform and human telomerase inhibition assays. In the current study, three of the 1,2-heteroannelated anthraquinones, NSC745795, NSC745885 and NSC745887, were found to differ from each other with respect to their effects on cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, autophagy, senescence and their abilities to induce DNA damage. The differences depended on the presence or absence of a heterocyclic moiety, which suggested that the differences were due, at least in part, to differential effects on specific cellular targets, such as p53. In contrast to DXR, which induced p53 expression, treatment with NSC745885 resulted in the degradation of several proteins, including p53, via proteasome-dependent and -independent pathways in HeLa cells. These results provide insights into the molecular mechanisms governing cell inhibition by 1,2-heteroannelated anthraquinone derivatives and suggest that these mechanisms could serve as the basis for new structure-based drug designs.

Abstract: Phagocytosis of immunoglobulin G-opsonised particles takes place via Fcγ receptor ligation, leading to uptake through an actin-dependent mechanism. Myosin regulatory light chains have previously been reported to control contractility during uptake through the Fcγ receptor. In this study, we show that p21-activated kinase 4 contributes to Fcγ receptor-mediated uptake downstream of actin cup formation by regulating phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain. siRNA-mediated knockdown of p21-activated kinase 4 leads to reduced myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation at Serine 19, with a corresponding reduction in phospho-myosin regulatory right chain localised to bound immunoglobulin G-opsonised red blood cells. p21-activated kinase 4 phosphorylates myosin light chain 9 at Serine 19 in vitro and RNA interference against myosin light chain 9 implicates this isoform, but not myosin light chain 12A or 12B, in Fcγ receptor-mediated uptake. Taken together, these data indicate that p21-activated kinase 4 regulates regulatory myosin light chain phosphorylation and myosin contractility during FcγR-mediated phagocytosis.

Abstract: Organic photovoltaic (OPV) technology promises a relatively inexpensive option for the solar energy conversion, provided its efficiency increases beyond the current level (∼7–8%) along with significant improvement in operational lifetime. To achieve this high efficiency/reliability, a systematic theoretical approach is required to optimize the underlying device fabrication process. In this article, we use an anneal-time dependent process-device co-simulation framework (the phase-field model for phase separation coupled with the self-consistent drift-diffusion transport for free carriers) to explore the effects of the process conditions (e.g., annealing temperature, anneal duration) on the performance of organic solar cells. Our results explain experimentally observed annealing effects on the solar cell performance, namely, (i) peak of the short circuit current, (ii) insensitivity of the open circuit voltage, (iii) low fill factor, etc., that would otherwise be deemed anomalous from the perspective of conventional solar cells. As such, this work offers a detailed analysis of the effects of annealing on OPV morphology and its electrical performance. This work also provides a theoretical framework for the optimization of process conditions, which might eventually lead to higher efficiency/reliability of the organic photovoltaic technology.

Abstract: Composites of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and titanium oxide compounds have been prepared by sol–gel method using different molar ratio between PEG and titanium isopropoxide. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images and UV–vis absorption spectra of these composites indicate that titanium oxide particles or clusters were formed inside the composite materials and their maximum sizes were between 1.8 and 7nm for PEG:Ti molar ratio changing from 24:1 to 4:1. Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy analysis of the same PEG–Ti composites suggests the presence of tetragonal titanium oxide compounds and its association with ether oxygen atoms of PEG molecules. As lithium iodide salt was added into PEG–Ti composites, iodide ions were oxidized into iodine and tri-iodides and, at the same time, titanium oxide compounds should be reduced. Color change speeds of tungsten oxide thin films were significantly improved when PEG–Ti–LiI composites were used as electrolytes compared to salt-in-polymer one (PEG–LiI); the bleaching time of tungsten oxide was reduced from 22 to 2.5s under +1.0V polarization, and the coloring time under −1.5V lowered from 16 to 2.2s. The transfer of negative charges from smaller iodide ions onto longer or crosslinked PEG–Ti macromolecules could be the origin of faster lithium ion transport/insertion speeds in PEG–Ti composite electrolyte based electrochromic devices.

Minor modifications to the industrial process for p-type, such as optimization of Al-alloyed screen-printed emitter and phosphorus front surface field, led to an improvement in cell properties. Large improvement in short-circuit current of the cell was possible by decreasing the cell thickness to 130μm.

Abstract: The durability of organic photovoltaic devices is improved by (a) replacing thermally labile poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) with gold nano-dots and (b) stabilizing the morphology of photoactive layers through thermally induced reaction. Gold nano-dots (Au-ND) (3–6nm in diameter and 0.8nm in height) were thermally deposited on ITO substrates prior to depositing a hole transporting layer (40nm) of an azide-functionalized poly(3-hexylthiophene), P1, which was insolubilized by heating to 150°C. A blend of P1 and [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) was deposited and heated to 150°C prior to the deposition of a Ca/Al cathode. The reaction of P1 with PCBM stabilized the bulk heterojunction film as evidenced by the suppression of crystallization of PCBM. Replacement of PEDOT:PSS with Au-ND, in combination with morphological stabilization, greatly improves the durability of PV devices under accelerated lifetime testing at 150°C. Power conversion efficiencies (PCE) for the P1:PCBM devices stabilized at 1.25% after 28h of accelerated testing at 150°C, whereas conventional P3HT:PCBM devices on PEDOT/ITO dropped to 0.58% after only 7h of accelerated testing. Prospects for similarly enhancing the durability of highly efficient PV devices are discussed.

Abstract: Molten salts have better thermal properties than synthetic mineral oil, and hence they can be directly used as heat transfer fluids in solar power plants, but in practice their direct applications as heat transfer fluids are constrained due to their high freezing temperature points. In this paper, a class of ternary nitrate salt mixtures consisting of 50–80wt% KNO3, 0–25wt% LiNO3 and 10–45wt% Ca(NO3)2 were processed and tested. Experimental results indicated that some mixtures within this range exhibited excellent thermal properties, such as a low melting point (<100°C), robust reliability, high-temperature stability (upto 500°C) and a low viscosity (e.g.,<5cP at 190°C). Apart from these desirable thermo-physical properties, the manufacturing cost of these novel inorganic salts HTFs (Heat Transfer Fluids) is considerably lower than those of the existing commercial heat transfer fluids (HTFs).

Abstract: A series of high-chain fatty acid esters of 1-tetradecanol (myristyl alcohol) were synthesized via esterification of 1-tridecanoic, 1-pentadecanoic, 1-heptadecanoic and 1-nonadecanoic acids under vacuum and in the absence of catalyst. The esterification reactions were controlled by FT-IR spectroscopy. Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and thermo-gravimetric analyzer (TGA) were intensively used to determine the thermal properties of the presented novel organic phase change materials (PCM). The thermal properties were given in terms of phase change temperature, enthalpy, specific heat (Cp) and thermal decomposition temperature with related statistical calculations. The thermal reliability of the synthesized PCMs, which is an important property for utilization, was determined via measuring the change in thermal properties after 1000 thermal cycles. The DSC analyses indicated that the melting points of the novel organic PCMs were between 40 and 50°C with phase change enthalpy above 200kJ/kg. The results showed that these thermal storage materials were favorable for low temperature heat transfer applications with superior thermal properties and reliability among the known PCMs.

Abstract: Formation mechanism of CIS thin films by selenization of sputter deposited CuIn precursor with Se vapor was investigated by ex-situ and in-situ phase analysis tools. Precursor films were composed of In, CuIn and Cu2In compounds, and their relative fractions were systematically changed with Cu/In ratios. Those films were found to have a double layered structure with nearly pure In particles (top layer) placed on the flat Cu-rich bottom layer, and the morphologies were also significantly affected by Cu/In ratio. At the initial stage of selenization, the outer In-rich layer reacted with Se vapor to form In–Se binary, which is the first selenide phase appeared, and inner Cu-rich phases acted as a Cu source to supply Cu to outer In–Se phase to form ordered vacancy compounds (OVC). As these reactions continues, in conjunction with Se incorporation into inner Cu-rich region, the films gradually changes from OVC to α-CIS, reflecting that the formation route of CIS is closely related to the elemental and phase distribution in precursor films. Selenized CIS films were further processed to fabricate CIS thin film solar cells, resulting in the best cell efficiency of 10.44%.

Abstract: Small molecule organic solar cells were studied with respect to water and oxygen induced degradation by mapping the spatial distribution of reaction products in order to elucidate the degradation patterns and failure mechanisms. The active layers consist of a 30nm bulk heterojunction formed by the donor material zinc-phthalocyanine (ZnPc) and the acceptor material Buckminsterfullerene (C60) followed by 30nm C60 for additional absorption. The active layers are sandwiched between 6nm 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (Bphen) and 30nm N,N′-diphenyl-N,N′-bis(3-methylphenyl)-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4,4′-diamine p-doped with C60F36 (MeO-TPD:C60F36), which acted as hole transporting layer. Indium-tin-oxide (ITO) and aluminum served as hole and electron collecting electrode, respectively. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) in conjunction with isotopic labeling using H218O and 18O2 provided information on where and to what extent the atmosphere had reacted with the device. A comparison was made between the use of a humid (oxygen free) atmosphere, a dry oxygen atmosphere, and a dry (oxygen free) nitrogen atmosphere during testing of devices that were kept in the dark and devices that were subjected to illumination under simulated sunlight. It was found that water significantly causes the device to degrade. The two most significant degradation mechanisms are diffusion of water through the aluminum electrode resulting in massive formation of aluminum oxide at the BPhen/Al interface, and diffusion of water into the ZnPc:C60 layer where ZnPc becomes oxidized. Finally, diffusion from the electrodes was found to have no or a negligible effect on the device lifetime.

Abstract: We investigate the growth of a novel organic photovoltaic material, dibenzotetraphenylperiflanthene (DBP) thin film by ultra-high-vacuum evaporation. It is shown that the surface morphology and crystalline order of DBP thin films are greatly changed by growth temperature. Especially, at 90°C, the DBP exhibits a unique orientated growth with long well-directional grain structures. The power conversion efficiency of the device using DBP grown at 90°C is enhanced by a factor of 61% relative to that of the device using DBP grown at room temperature due to the improvements in photocurrent, open-circuit voltage and fill factor. The results indicate the feasibility of the controlled growth of DBP thin films, which plays a crucial role in improving the performances of photovoltaic devices.

Abstract: Bulk heterojunction solar cells utilizing soluble phthalocyanine derivative, 1,4,8,11,15,18,22,25-octahexylphthalocyanine (C6PcH2) have been investigated. The active layer was fabricated by spin-coating the mixed solution of C6PcH2 and 1-(3-methoxy-carbonyl)-propyl-1-1-phenyl-(6,6)C61 (PCBM). The photovoltaic properties of the solar cell with bulk heterojunction of C6PcH2 and PCBM demonstrated the strong dependence of active layer thickness, and the optimized active layer thickness was clarified to be 120nm. By inserting MoO3 hole transport buffer layer between the positive electrode and active layer, the FF and energy conversion efficiency were improved to be 0.50 and 3.2%, respectively. The tandem organic thin-film solar cell has also been studied by utilizing active layer materials of C6PcH2 and poly(3-hexylthiophene) and the interlayer of LiF/Al/MoO3 structure, and a high Voc of 1.27V has been achieved.

Abstract: Inverted bulk-heterojunction solar cells have recently captured high interest due to their environmental stability as well as compatibility to mass production. This has been enabled by the development of solution processable n-type semiconductors, mainly TiO2 and ZnO. However, the device performance is strongly correlated to the electronic properties of the interfacial materials, and here specifically to their work function, surface states as well as conductivity and mobility. It is noteworthy to say that these properties are massively determined by the crystallinity and stoichiometry of the metal oxides. In this study, we investigated aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) as charge selective extraction layer for inverted BHJ solar cells. Thin AZO films were characterized with respect to their structural, optical and electrical properties. The performance of organic solar cells with an AZO electron extraction layer (EEL) is compared to the performance of intrinsic ZnO or TiOx EELs. We determined the transmittance, absorbance, conductivity and optical band gap of all these different metal oxides. Furthermore, we also built the correlations between doping level of AZO and device performance, and between annealing temperature of AZO and device performance.

Klf10 induces cell apoptosis through modulation of BI-1 expression and Ca2+ homeostasis in estrogen-responding adenocarcinoma cells,

Abstract: Estrogen stimulates cell growth and inhibits apoptosis through estrogen receptor-mediated mechanisms in many cell types. Remarkably, there is another dimension to estrogen action by which apoptosis is induced in breast cancer cells. While these mechanisms are not yet completely understood, finding the molecules involved has paved the way for the development of a new drug group. Using ChIP-chip, we have demonstrated that Klf10, a Krüppel-like zinc finger transcription factor, which was induced in response to estrogen, directly modulates the transcription of BI-1 (Bax inhibitor-1; also called the testis-enhanced gene transcript, TEGT). Eventually, the estrogen induced Klf10 and then suppresses BI-1 transcription. The estrogen/Klf10/BI-1 interrelationship was further confirmed using BI-1 promoter and EMSA assays. The estrogen-elicited reduction of BI-1 promoter activity was significantly reversed when the Klf10 binding element was mutated to abolish Klf10 binding. A si-Klf10 antisense-oligo nucleotide was also able to restore BI-1 promoter activity to its pre-estrogen-treatment level. BI-1 is known to regulate stress via the endoplasmic reticulum; in this context down-regulation of BI-1 is able to cause Ca2+ release and trigger an apoptosis pathway in breast cancer. In our study, Klf10 not only suppressed cellular BI-1 expression but also increased the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, eventually causing apoptotic cell death. Based on these results, we suggest the pathway by which estrogen induces apoptosis is possibly through an up-regulation of Klf10 that decreases BI-1 and finally increases the concentration of cytoplasmic calcium.

Abstract: TvCP39 is a 39kDa cysteine proteinase (CP) involved in Trichomonas vaginalis cytotoxicity that has been found in vaginal secretions and is immunogenic in patients with trichomonosis. The goal of this work was to identify, clone, express, and characterize the tvcp39 gene. The tvcp39 gene was identified using a proteomic approach, and the complete gene was amplified using PCR, cloned, and sequenced. TvCP39 is encoded by a 915-bp cathepsin L-like CP gene. A fragment corresponding to the mature region (TvCP39r) was expressed, purified, and used to produce rabbit polyclonal antibodies and in functional assays. In one- and two-dimensional western blot assays, the anti-TvCP39r antibody reacted with two protein bands of ∼28 and 27kDa and three spots of ∼28, 27, and 24kDa in trichomonad proteinase-rich extracts that could correspond to the mature and processed fragments of the TvCP39 peptidase. The anti-TvCP39r antibody reacted with the parasitic surface and the native TvCP39 present in vaginal washes from patients with trichomonosis. Moreover, the recombinant TvCP39 protein bound to the surface of HeLa cells and protected HeLa cell monolayers from trichomonal destruction in a concentration-dependent manner. In conclusion, our data support TvCP39 as one of the surface proteinases that is glycosylated and is involved in trichomonal cytotoxicity. Thus, TvCP39 is the first glycosylated cysteine proteinase detected in T. vaginalis.

Abstract: We demonstrate efficient hybrid inorganic/organic p–i–n photovoltaic (PV) devices with a p-type-doped hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H), intrinsic a-Si:H, and an organic semiconductor, pentacene. The correlation between the electrical properties of the PV devices and the morphological properties of the pentacene films were investigated using absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. The maximum power conversion efficiency can be increased by one order with respect to the devices using different thicknesses of a pentacene layer from 0.32% at 10nm to above 3.0% at 30nm. Photocarriers in PVs are suggested to be mainly generated in the intrinsic a-Si:H layer. The pentacene layer is used as the exciton-blocking and electron-transport layer. Thus, the structural quality of pentacene films plays an important role in PV performance.

Abstract: Advances in bandgap and molecular spectral engineering have led to color-tunable donor–acceptor (DA) polymers for use in esthetically colored bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) photovoltaic devices where control and optimization of the physical processes governing their operation is necessary to realize high efficiency. We detail a study of the processes of photogeneration of charge carriers, their separation at the DA heterojunctions and their transport in solar cells fabricated from a series of dioxythiophene–benzothiadiazole (DOT–BTD) copolymers (PG1–PG3) as the electron donor and methanofullerene (PCBM) derivatives as the electron acceptor. We also examine the effect of the blend composition on carrier transport and photoresponse. The photogeneration of carriers and their dissociation increases with increase in concentration of the acceptor and peaks at ∼88% of PCBM. Measurements on single-carrier devices show that hole mobility in the polymer phase of the blends is enhanced by up to two orders at compositions having >80% of PCBM by weight. However, even at the optimized composition, the electron mobility in the blend is two orders of magnitude higher than the hole mobility. This largely imbalanced carrier transport results in the build-up of space-charges, limiting the efficiency of charge separation at short-circuit (∼53%) and the fill factor (<45%). To highlight the importance of attaining charge balance in BHJ DA blends for photovoltaics, we further investigate and compare solar cells from two model polymers, a low bandgap DA polymer (PSBTBT) and poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT), blended with PCBM. Our findings indicate that, in contrast to the DOT–BTD copolymers, carrier transport is significantly more balanced in these model systems, preventing space-charge build-up and reducing recombination, which results in a markedly improved charge separation efficiency and fill factor.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) offers the best chance of cure and long-term survival for children with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).
DESIGN AND SETTING
Retrospective analysis of pediatric patients with primary MDS treated with allogeneic SCT at a single institution treated between January 1993 and December 2008.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Of 16 consecutive children who received allogeneic SCT for treatment of MDS in our center, 14 patients met the criteria of MDS according WHO I and II criteria. The median age was 4.8years (range, 1-14 years) and 64% were male. The median time from diagnosis to transplant was 6 months. MDS stage was refractory cytopenia (RC) in 9, refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) in 5. Monosomy 7 was present in 35% of the patients. The majority of patients (11/14) were conditioned with a busulfan-based myeloablative (MA) regimen with addition of low-dose of etoposide (30mg/kg). All but one received a bone marrow graft.
RESULTS
Nine patients achieved complete remission (CR), and seven remain alive. At a median follow-up of 3 years (range, 2-14 years) the OS and EFS was 57% (95%CI, 0.28-0.78). Cumulative EFS at 1 0 years was 43% (95% CI: 0.14-0.70). Relapse-related mortality was 21.4%; nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was 28.57%. All the survivors had etoposide in their conditioning regimen. Patients younger than 1 0 years had better survival (P=.001).
CONCLUSION
Children with MDS achieve encouraging OS and EFS following allogeneic SCT. A busulfan-based regimen with a lower dose of etoposide is an effective and less toxic regimen. The outcomes are best in younger patients.

Abstract: Heat transfer characteristics during crystallization and melting of the phase change material (PCM) dispersed inside an emulsion are investigated theoretically and experimentally. The dispersed PCMs are hexadecane, octadecane and water. The crystallization and melting processes are not symmetrical because of the supercooling phenomenon induced by the smallness of the emulsion droplet sizes. Nucleation laws are used to simulate the supercooling phenomenon. Energy analysis is carried out to understand the behavior of the emulsion using two paraffins (octadecane and hexadecane). The effects of different parameters such as the mass fraction of PCM and the stabilization temperature on thermal behavior of emulsion are also analyzed.

Abstract: In the present paper, we study the influence of defects through their stress fields on the electrical activity and residual stress states of as-grown edge-defined film-feed (EFG) multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) ribbons. We apply a combination of micro-Raman spectroscopy, electron beam induced current, defect etching and electron backscatter diffraction techniques that enables us to correlate internal stresses, recombination activity and microstructure on the micrometer scale. The stress fields of defect structures are considered to be too small (several tens of MPa) to influence directly the electrical activity, but they can enhance it via stress-induced accumulation of metallic impurities. It is commonly found that not all recombination-active dislocations on grain boundaries (GBs) and within grains are accompanied by internal stresses. The reason for this is that dislocations interact with each other and tend to locally rearrange in configurations of minimum strain energy in which their stress fields can cancel partially, totally or not at all. The outcome is a nonuniform distribution of electrical activity and internal stresses along the same GB, along different GBs of similar character as well as inside the same grain and inside different grains of similar crystallographic orientations. Our work has implications for developing crystal growth procedures that may lead to reduced internal stresses and consequently to improved electrical quality and mechanical stability of mc-Si materials by means of controlled interaction between structural defects.

Abstract: In this study, a gold (Au) nanomesh layer was manufactured on an ITO-coated glass substrate at room temperature. The Au nanomesh was used to induce surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to enhance the photocurrent of a polymer solar cell. The Au nanomesh was manufactured by lift-off on closely packed PS nanospheres (diameter ∼50nm; density ∼1010/cm2). The PS nanospheres were fabricated by modified block copolymer nano-patterning on ITO. A transmittance–reflection–absorbance spectrum was used to explore the induced surface plasmon. An extinction peak was observed at ∼580nm indicate the possibility of Au nanomesh induced surface plasmon resonance. The short-circuit current density of the polymer solar cell was enhanced from 7.02 to 14.2mA/cm2 by the addition of Au nanomesh. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency enhanced from 1.9% to 3.2%. By the normalized input photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement, enhanced photocurrent conversion efficiency at approximately 580nm was observed that coincided with the extinction spectrum, indicating that the surface plasmon enhanced the photocurrent.

Abstract: We demonstrate the effect of excimer (XeCl=308nm) laser annealing on thin films of ZnO:Al deposited by RF sputtering at room temperature. The as-deposited films have good sheet resistance (<11Ω/□) but poor transparency, and a subsequent chemical etching step using dilute HCl to texture the film surface results in a level of haze ineffective for light-trapping in thin film photovoltaic cells. Excimer laser annealing at the optimized fluence (single pulses of 0.5–0.7J/cm2) improves the film transparency, particularly through a blue-shift in the band-gap, without significantly impacting the conductivity. More importantly, chemical etching of these laser annealed films results in textured films with controllable spectral distributions of haze. We demonstrate the enhanced optical properties (transmission and haze) after laser annealing and etching the ZnO:Al films through the fabrication of hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon pin solar cells, and show a significant improvement in the photocurrent density (up to 2.2mA/cm2) for the optimally annealed substrates—particularly at wavelengths greater than 600nm (up to 1.7mA/cm2) where light-trapping is important.

Abstract: The novel linear and star molecules based on benzothiadiazole as a central core, TPA as end groups and different functional groups as π-spacers were theoretically examined in the OSC applications. The geometry structures in ground and excited state, ionization potentials (IPs), electron affinities (EAs) and reorganization energy (Eλ+ and Eλ−) of linear and star molecules were studied by DFT methods. The absorption and the emission spectra were calculated by TD-BHandHLYP method. Star molecules based on ethynyl groups as π-spacer exhibit ameliorative IPs, EAs, Eλ+ and Eλ−, indicating they are more suitable for the formation and transfer of holes than the others. Moreover, the diethynyl groups improve the charge transfer character and extend the absorption wavelength towards the range with the maximum photon flux.

Abstract: The precipitation of P in the emitter region of H3PO4 spray doped silicon for solar cell applications has been investigated by electron microscopy, X-ray microanalysis and electrical measurements after annealing for two different times. P, Si and O concentration profiles show that the composition of the phosphorous silicate glass (PSG) is in agreement with a solid solution of P2O5 in SiO2 and that P concentration is peaked at the PSG/Si interface. TEM observations have shown for the shorter annealing the formation of a 20nm thick defect layer at the silicon surface; this layer evolves into a network of large rod-like monoclinic (or orthorhombic) SiP precipitates, which extend in depth up to about 100nm for the longer treatment. The SiP crystal structure and the habit planes are the same as previously reported in literature. No deeper defect that could interact with the junction located at about 300nm has been detected. Although the SiP precipitation takes place entirely at the Si surface, it is not significantly affected by the orientation of the crystals and by the texturing process. The amounts of both electrically active and inactive P obtained by the H3PO4 spray technique have been compared with the ones obtained by the conventional POCl3 technique. The former process presents a larger amount of inactive dopant, a finding that is in keeping with the microstructural and microanalytical observations. Instead the amount of active P is similar in the two cases, a result attributed to the precipitation and clustering phenomena of the excess dopant.

Abstract: Crystalline compounds (C14H29NH3)2CuCl4(s) and (C15H31NH3)2CuCl4(s) were synthesized. X-ray crystallography was applied to characterize crystal structures of the two compounds. The crystal system is both monoclinic, the space group is both C2/c, and Z=4. The lattice potential energies of the title compounds were calculated to be UPOT [(C14H29NH3)2CuCl4,s]=853.12kJ/mol and UPOT [(C15H31NH3)2CuCl4, s]=854.93kJ/mol. Low-temperature heat capacities of the two compounds were measured by a precision automatic adiabatic calorimeter over the temperature range from 78 to 395K. The temperatures, molar enthalpies, and entropies of two phase transitions for each of the two complexes were determined to be: for (C14H29NH3)2CuCl4(s), 342.35±0.11K, 76.17±0.40kJ/mol, and 222.49±1.20J/Kmol for the first peak; 352.61±0.09K, 27.83±0.27kJ/mol, and 78.92±0.78J/Kmol for the second peak, and for (C15H31NH3)2CuCl4(s), they were 345.40±0.93K, 62.06±1.07kJ/mol, and 179.67±2.63J/Kmol for the first peak; 360.98±0.25K, 21.66±0.76kJ/mol, and 60.00±2.09J/Kmol for the second peak, respectively. The smoothed heat capacities and thermodynamic functions (HTο−H298.15ο) and (ΔtrsSm=ΔtrsHm/Ttrs) of the two compounds were calculated with an interval of 5K based on the experimental heat capacities.

Abstract: The enhanced cooling of exposed surfaces by radiative heat loss to the cold sky was investigated using a variety of commonly available materials. Zinc sulphide was identified as a durable substance suitable for the construction of convection covers for radiative cooling radiators. With respect to polyethylene, the most commonly used convection cover to date, the new material is mechanically stronger, impervious to damage by solar ultraviolet and in practical thicknesses is more transparent in the 8–14μm waveband. Use of this window material with a previously proposed selective radiator material, a form of anodised aluminium that reflects radiation at wavelengths shorter than 8μm allows for the economical production of an effective selective radiator system. Measurements were made on simple radiator plates and convection covers.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
The failure of existing treatments for liver cancer has recently been attributed to the existence of cancer stem cells, which are difficult to kill using current drugs due to their chemoresistant properties as well as their ability to stimulate neoangiogenesis. The aim of the current study was to evaluate in vitro the antitumor efficacy of arsenic trioxide in combination with conventional chemotherapy, as proposed by the concept of “differentiation therapy” in anticancer research.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cancer stem cells showed enhanced chemoresistance to cancer drugs (carboplatin and doxorubicin) and had the ability to exclude rhodamine 123 dye, proving the existence of the multidrug resistance efflux pump. Arsenic trioxide was added prior to a tyrosine kinase inhibitor or to a slightly modified Piaf regimen with capecitabine replacing 5-fluorouracil. We also compared both cancer and normal stem cell lines with the hepG2 non-stem liver cancer cell line to investigate the differences between differentiated and more anaplastic cells. Molecular characterization (immunocytochemistry and rt-PCr analysis) of all the cell lines was carried out.
RESULTS
Initially, the cells had a high proliferative potential, even when cultured in a medium supplemented with cytostatics, eliminated rhodamine 123 immediately in culture and also formed spheroids in suspension. The molecular characterization showed the expression of albumin, α1-antitrypsin, α-fetoprotein, citokeratin-18, telomerase, CD90 and CD133. Low concentrations of arsenic trioxide lead to morphologic differentiation and differentiation-associated cytochemical features, like increased sensitivity to cytostatic drugs.
CONCLUSION
Our study suggests that arsenic trioxide sensitizes liver stem-like cancer cells to conventional chemotherapy. Still, further studies on animal models will be needed before we implement this idea in human clinical trials.

Abstract: The choice of fatty acids as shape-stabilized phase change materials (PCMs) will increase the feasibilities of PCMs in practical applications due to the low price of the fatty acids. Compounding different fatty acids for each other is an effective way to obtain a PCM with a suitable phase-transition temperature. In this study, a series of binary fatty acids composed by capric acid, lauric acid, palmitic acid and stearic acid for each other were prepared using the phase diagram thermal dynamics calculation method. Then these binary fatty acids are absorbed in four kinds of diatomites with different specific areas, which act as a supporting material, to prepare shape-stabilized PCMs. The prepared shape-stabilized PCMs are characterized by the Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis method. The results show that there is an optimum absorption ratio between binary fatty acids and the diatomite. The latent heat of capric–lauric acid/diatomite decreases to 57% of that of capric–lauric acid, and the phase-transition temperature rises from 16.36 to 16.74°C when the capric–lauric acid is absorbed in the diatomite. The prepared capric–lauric acid/diatomite composite PCM has proper melting temperatures and latent heat for thermal energy storage application in buildings.

Abstract: Polycrystalline Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) thin films have been directly deposited on heating Mo-coated glass substrates by Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) method. The results of energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) indicate that these CZTS thin films are Cu-rich and S-poor. The combination of X-ray diffraction (XRD) results and Raman spectroscopy reveals that these thin films exhibit strong preferential orientation of grains along [112] direction and small Cu2−xS phase easily exists in CZTS thin films. The lattice parameters and grain sizes have been examined based on XRD patterns and Atom Force Microscopy (AFM). The band gap (Eg) of CZTS thin films, which are determined by reflection spectroscopy varies from 1.53 to 1.98eV, depending on substrate temperature (Tsub). The optical absorption coefficient of CZTS thin film (Tsub=450°C) measured by spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) is above 104cm−1.

Abstract: In this paper, a new p–InGaN multiple quantum well–n solar cell has been investigated. In order to obtain the exact solar cell parameters such as conversion efficiency, the polarization field effects of nitride materials are taken into account. It has been found that the conversion efficiency of the p–i(MQW)–n solar cell is significantly higher than those of normal p–i(bulk)–n solar cells. The optimized conversion efficiency of about 35% is obtained for p–MQW–n solar cells at room temperature. Also, the temperature dependence of open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current and consequently conversion efficiencies of both structures are investigated, and it is observed that the increasing of temperature slightly increases the short-circuit current and decreases the open-circuit voltage and efficiency.

Abstract: Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) thin films prepared by a non-vacuum process based on the sulfurization of precursor coatings, consisting of a sol–gel solution of Cu, Zn, and Sn, under H2S+N2 atmosphere were investigated. The structure, microstructure, and electronic properties of the CZTS thin films as well as solar cell parameters were studied in dependence on the H2S concentration. The sulfurization process was carried out at 500°C for 1h in an H2S+N2 mixed-gas atmosphere with H2S concentrations of 3%, 5%, 10%, and 20%. As the H2S concentration decreased from 20% to 5%, the S content of the CZTS thin films decreased. However, when the H2S concentration was decreased below 3%, the S content of the films began to increase. A CZTS thin film prepared with an H2S concentration of 3% had grains in the order of 1μm in size, which were larger than those of films prepared at other H2S concentrations. Furthermore, the most efficient solar cell, with a conversion efficiency of 2.23%, was obtained from a sample sulfurized at an H2S concentration of 3%.

Abstract: In this paper, the series resistance of poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSC) has been studied. The series resistance of thermal annealed and un-annealed devices with different active layer thicknesses was measured. The series resistance of the organic solar cells consists of the bulk resistance of the active layer itself and the specific contact resistance between the active layer and the electrode. The bulk resistance and contact resistance were extracted from the measured series resistance using the vertical transmission line model (TLM) method. By fabricating solar cell devices with different active layer thicknesses, a relationship of the series resistance with thickness was established from which bulk and contact resistances were derived. We have also found that thermal annealing helps reduce both contact resistance and bulk resistance significantly; the contact resistance dropped by a factor of 2, while the bulk resistance decreased by a factor of 8. Results have shown that for an annealed P3HT:PCBM device that has an active layer thickness of 85nm (optimum thickness for high efficiency), 17% of the total series resistance was due to the contact resistance, and bulk resistance contributed the rest 83%. The bulk resistance value for thermal annealed organic solar cell device with an active area of 0.1cm2 was found to be 150Ω, and the measured specific contact resistance was 3.1Ωcm2. The measured bulk and contact resistance values are much higher as compared to the high efficiency silicon solar cells. Bulk resistance and contact resistance need to be further decreased in order to achieve higher organic solar cell efficiency.

Abstract: Penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) are bacterial enzymes involved in the final stages of cell wall biosynthesis, and are targets of the β-lactam antibiotics. They can be subdivided into essential high-molecular-mass (HMM) and non-essential low-molecular-mass (LMM) PBPs, and further divided into subclasses based on sequence homologies. PBPs can catalyze transpeptidase or hydrolase (carboxypeptidase and endopeptidase) reactions. The PBPs are of interest for their role in bacterial cell wall biosynthesis, and as mechanistically interesting enzymes which can catalyze alternative reaction pathways using the same catalytic machinery. A global catalytic residue comparison seemed likely to provide insight into structure-function correlations within the PBPs. More than 90 PBP structures were aligned, and a number (40) of active site geometrical parameters extracted. This dataset was analyzed using both univariate and multivariate statistical methods. Several interesting relationships were observed. (1) Distribution of the dihedral angle for the SXXK-motif Lys side chain (DA_1) was bimodal, and strongly correlated with HMM/transpeptidase vs LMM/hydrolase classification/activity (P<0.001). This structural feature may therefore be associated with the main functional difference between the HMM and LMM PBPs. (2) The distance between the SXXK-motif Lys-NZ atom and the Lys/His-nitrogen atom of the (K/H)T(S)G-motif was highly conserved, suggesting importance for PBP function, and a possibly conserved role in the catalytic mechanism of the PBPs. (3) Principal components-based cluster analysis revealed several distinct clusters, with the HMM Class A and B, LMM Class C, and LMM Class A K15 PBPs forming one “Main” cluster, and demonstrating a globally similar arrangement of catalytic residues within this group.

Abstract: Rosai-Dorfman disease, also known as sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy, is a benign indolent disorder, characterized by enlarged lymph nodes filled with histiocytes. Extranodal involvement is uncommon. The disease rarely affects the nose and paranasal sinuses. We report a case that presented with a right nasal mass, extending into all the paranasal sinuses and right orbit without any accompanying lymphadenopathy. Because of the absence of lymphadenopathy it posed a diagnostic challenge until the pathology was confirmed on histopathological examination.

Abstract: Metal-mirror microcavity (MMC) structure is incorporated into the low bandgap polymer solar cells (LBPSCs) by sandwiching the active layer between the semitransparent Ag electrode and top Ag electrode. Optical simulations demonstrate that significant absorption enhancement can be achieved in the red and near infrared (near-IR) wavelength range due to the large optical electric field confined by the MMC structure. By inserting optical spacers to control the spectral and spatial distribution of the electric field in the LBPSC devices, the MMC structure can improve the total absorbed photons (TAPs) at the red and near-IR spectral range (620–900nm) by 42.6% and yield an improvement of 14.0% in TAPs across the whole spectrum (400–900nm) for the device with a 100nm-thick active layer. For devices with thinner active layer, the improving rate is significantly raised to over 100%. Additionally, it is revealed that the effects of the optical spacers on the electric field distribution vary with their positions in the MMC structure. Finally, the MMC-based devices are optimized by tailoring the electric field distribution in the devices.

Abstract: Eukaryotic cells undergo rapid regulatory processes to maintain cellular homeostasis upon osmotic stress. In fishes, gill epithelial cells play main roles in these processes. Although osmoregulatory functions of fish gills have been well studied, little is known about the underlying mechanisms, particularly the hypertonic-induced signalling pathways during osmotic stress. This study reports for the first time on the osmo-sensing signal cascade that related to the medaka osmotic stress transcription factor 1 (Ostf1), a hypertonic induced immediate early gene, under hypertonic stress. Quantitative real-time PCR showed the rapid increase of Ostf1 in gill after transfer of medaka from fresh water to 50% seawater; particularly Ostf1b whose mRNA expression increased to 4 folds at 0.5h and reached to 10 folds at 6h after the transfer. The in vivo knockdown of Ostf1b profoundly inhibited SEK and JNK phosphorylation, but not p38 and ERK phosphorylation in the medaka gill tissue. To further investigate the possible role of Ostf1b in the JNK pathway, Ostf1b was ectopically expressed in HEK293 cells. Results indicated that Ostf1b is a downstream target of SEK and JNK and exerts a positive feedback loop on the JNK signalling pathway via activation of GCK and/or MLK3 proteins. Additionally, MAPK inhibitors experiments suggested that activation of the JNK pathway by hypertonicity is involved in the maintenance of Ostf1b stability, which in turn provides continuous stimulation of GCK for JNK phosphorylation. Lastly, changes in transcription levels of different water/ion transporters were found in knockdown or ecoptic over-expression of Ostf1b in medaka gills and human embryonic kidney cells, suggesting the role of Ostf1b in modulation of critical water channel/ion transporters during osmotic stress.

Abstract: We report the performance improvement of organic solar cell by addition of an n-type chemical doping layer in organic bulk heterojunction device. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of P3HT and PCBM-71 based polymer solar cells increases by adding a mixture of TCNQ (7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane) and LCV (Leucocrystal violet) between active layer and cathode electrode. The PCE of the cell increases by 14% compared to the control cell with Al-only cathode electrode. The device with an organic n-doped layer shows the JSC of 8.88mA/cm2, VOC of 0.51V, FF of 60.1%, and thus the PCE of 2.72% under AM1.5 illumination of 100mW/cm2.

Abstract: We report on heterojunction solar cells whose thin intrinsic crystalline absorber layer has been obtained by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition at 165°C on highly doped p-type (100) crystalline silicon substrates. We have studied the effect of the epitaxial intrinsic layer thickness in the range from 1 to 2.5μm. This absorber is responsible for photo-generated current whereas highly doped wafer behave like electric contact, as confirmed by external quantum efficiency measurements and simulations. A best conversion efficiency of 7% is obtained for a 2.4μm thick cell with an area of 4cm2, without any light trapping features. Moreover, the achievement of a fill factor as high as 78.6% is a proof that excellent quality of the epitaxial layers can be produced at such low temperatures.

Abstract: Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) absorbers were grown by sulfurization of Cu/ZnSn/Cu precursors in sulfur atmosphere. The reaction mechanism of CZTS formation from the precursor was analyzed using XRD and Raman spectroscopy. The films with a single phase CZTS were formed at 560 and 580°C by sulfurization for 30min. The film grown at 560°C showed bi-layer morphology with grooved large grains on the top and dense small grains near the bottom of the film. On the other hand, the film grown at 580°C showed large grains with grooves that are extended from surface top to bottom of the film. The solar cell fabricated with the CZTS film grown at 560°C showed the best conversion efficiency of 4.59% for 0.44cm2 with Voc=0.545V, Jsc=15.44mA/cm2, and FF=54.6. We found that further improvement of the microstructure of CZTS films can increase the efficiency of CZTS solar cells.

Abstract: Recently we demonstrated that the miRNA regulate human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) differentiation. To determine the role of the miRNA pathway in hMSCs proliferation, Drosha and Dicer knockdown hMSCs were generated using a lentiviral based tetracycline inducible shRNA. hMSCs with reduced Drosha expression had a significantly reduced proliferation rate, while hMSCs with reduced Dicer expression displayed a proliferation rate similar to untransduced cells. Cell cycle analysis identified that unlike Dicer knockdown, Drosha knockdown hMSCs contained an increased number of G1 phase cells, with a reduced level of cells in S phase, compared to controls. ELISAs of hMSCs revealed decreased levels of pRB and stable levels of total RB with Drosha knockdown. Two key regulators of the G1/S phase transition, cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (p16) and cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2B (p15), were increased in Drosha knockdown cells but not in Dicer knockdown. Transcripts of 28S and 18S rRNA were significantly reduced in Drosha knockdown hMSCs, with no change in rRNA levels in Dicer knockdown hMSCs. 45S pre-rRNA transcripts were not significantly different in either knockdown model. The above results indicate that Drosha modifies hMSCs proliferation through a miRNA independent mechanism, potentially by regulating rRNA processing.

Abstract: A novel low band gap alternating phenylenevinylene copolymer, P, with dithenyl (thienothiadiazole) segments was synthesized by Heck coupling. It was soluble in common organic solvents, showed broad absorption curve with long-wavelength absorption maximum at 580–598nm and optical band gap of 1.74eV, which is comparable with the electrochemical band gap of about 1.80eV. P (electron donor) was blended with PCBM or modified PCBM i.e. F (electron acceptor) to fabricate bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices based on P:PCBM and P:F cast from 1.2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) was found to be 1.40% and 2.32%, respectively. The higher value of PCE for the device with P:F as compared to P:PCBM is attributed to the increase in both short circuit current (Jsc) and open circuit voltage (Voc). The increase in the Jsc is due to the stronger light absorption of F in visible region as compared to PCBM, i.e. more exciton generation in the blend. On the other hand, the higher difference between the LUMO levels of P and F, as compared to P and PCBM is responsible for the enhancement in the Voc. A maximum overall PCE of 4.20% was obtained for the BHJ polymer cell based on the active layer (P:F) deposited from mixed solvents 1-chloronapthalene/1,2-dichlorobenzene (CN/DCB) and subsequent thermal annealing at 120°C. This improvement in the PCE has been attributed to the enhanced crystallinity of the blend and more balanced charge transport in the device due to the thermal treatment.

Abstract: Shiga toxins produced by Escherichia coli O157:H7 are responsible for food poisoning and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). The A subunits of Shiga toxins (Stx1A and Stx2A) inhibit translation by depurinating a specific adenine in the large rRNA. To determine if Stx1A and Stx2A require the ribosomal stalk for depurination, their activity and cytotoxicity were examined in the yeast P protein deletion mutants. Stx1A and Stx2A were less toxic and depurinated ribosomes less in a strain lacking P1/P2 on the ribosome and in the cytosol (ΔP2) than in a strain lacking P1/P2 on the ribosome, but containing free P2 in the cytosol (ΔP1). To determine if cytoplasmic P proteins facilitated depurination, Stx1A and Stx2A were expressed in the P0ΔAB mutant, in which the binding sites for P1/P2 were deleted on the ribosome, and P1/P2 accumulated in the cytosol. Stx1A was less toxic and depurinated ribosomes less in P0ΔAB, suggesting that intact binding sites for P1/P2 were critical. In contrast, Stx2A was toxic and depurinated ribosomes in P0ΔAB as in wild type, suggesting that it did not require the P1/P2 binding sites. Depurination of ΔP1, but not P0ΔAB ribosomes increased upon addition of purified P1α/P2β in vitro, and the increase was greater for Stx1 than for Stx2. We conclude that cytoplasmic P proteins stimulate depurination by Stx1 by facilitating the access of the toxin to the ribosome. Although ribosomal stalk is important for Stx1 and Stx2 to depurinate the ribosome, Stx2 is less dependent on the stalk proteins for activity than Stx1 and can depurinate ribosomes with an incomplete stalk better than Stx1.

Abstract: Amyloid-β1–42 (Aβ) is believed to play a crucial role in the ethiopathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). In particular, its interactions with biologically relevant metal ions may lead to the formation of highly neurotoxic complexes. Here we describe the species that are formed upon reacting Aβ with several biometals, namely copper, zinc, iron, and with non-physiological aluminum to assess whether different metal ions are able to differently drive Aβ aggregation. The nature of the resulting Aβ–metal complexes and of the respective aggregates was ascertained through a number of biophysical techniques, including electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, dynamic light scattering, fluorescence, transmission electron microscopy and by the use of conformation-sensitive antibodies (OC, αAPF). Metal binding to Aβ is shown to confer highly different chemical properties to the resulting complexes; accordingly, their overall aggregation behaviour was deeply modified. Both aluminum(III) and iron(III) ions were found to induce peculiar aggregation properties, ultimately leading to the formation of annular protofibrils and of fibrillar oligomers. Notably, only Aβ-aluminum was characterized by the presence of a relevant percentage of aggregates with a mean radius slightly smaller than 30nm. In contrast, both zinc(II) and copper(II) ions completely prevented the formation of soluble fibrillary aggregates. The biological effects of the various Aβ–metal complexes were studied in neuroblastoma cell cultures: Aβ–aluminum turned out to be the only species capable of triggering amyloid precursor and tau181 protein overproduction. Our results point out that Al can effectively interact with Aβ, forming “structured” aggregates with peculiar biophysical properties which are associated with a high neurotoxicity.

Abstract: SASH1, a member of the SLY-family of signal adapter proteins, is a candidate tumor suppressor in breast and colon cancer. Reduced expression of SASH1 is correlated with aggressive tumor growth, metastasis formation, and inferior prognosis. However, the biological role of SASH1 remains largely unknown. To unravel the function of SASH1, we have analyzed the intracellular localization of endogenous SASH1, and have generated structural SASH1 mutants. SASH1 localized to the nucleus as well as to the cytoplasm in epithelial cells. In addition, SASH1 was enriched in lamellipodia and membrane ruffles, where it co-distributed with the actin cytoskeleton. Moreover, we demonstrate a novel interaction of SASH1 with the oncoprotein cortactin, a known regulator of actin polymerization in lamellipodia. Enhanced SASH1 expression significantly increased the content of filamentous actin, leading to the formation of cell protrusions and elongated cell shape. This activity was mapped to the central, evolutionarily conserved domain of SASH1. Furthermore, expression of SASH1 inhibited cell migration and lead to increased cell adhesion to fibronectin and laminin, whereas knock-down of endogenous SASH1 resulted in significantly reduced cell–matrix adhesion. Taken together, our findings unravel for the first time a mechanistic role for SASH1 in tumor formation by regulating the adhesive and migratory behaviour of cancer cells.

The challenges of managing glioblastoma multiforme in developing countries: a trade-off between cost and quality of care,

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
The management of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in developing countries is hindered by the paucity of clear protocols due in part to growing economic constraints and the lack of availability of expensive chemotherapeutic agents. We evaluated the deliverable treatment protocols and achievable outcomes for patients with GBM in a low-income country prior and subsequent to the worldwide adoption of temozolomide.
DESIGN AND SETTING
Retrospective case series.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Charts of consecutive patients with a pathologic diagnosis of high-grade glioma diagnosed between January 2003 and December 2008 were retrospectively reviewed.
RESULTS
We identified 146 adult patients, including 105 males and 41 females between 19 and 81 years of age (median age, 51 years), with histologically confirmed high-grade glioma. All patients underwent craniotomy. Eighty-two patients were treated with radiotherapy and temozolomide, of whom 42 patients received temozolomide concurrent with radiation followed by adjuvant temozolomide; 40 patients received irradiation followed sequentially by 6 cycles of temozolomide. In 40 patients irradiation was utilized as a single modality treatment adjuvant to surgery. The follow-up ranged from 1 to 56 months (median, 9.4months). The median survival for the whole cohort was 10.2months. The median survival for the radiotherapy-alone group was 5.3months and for combined radiotherapy/temozolomide was 14.8months. Survival was similar in both concurrent and sequential groups. Temozolomide conferred a statistically significant survival benefit of 9 months compared with standard therapeutic modalities.
CONCLUSIONS
The results compare favorably to those reported in developed nations. Current management of GBM in developing countries should include maximal surgical resection followed by radiotherapy/temozolomide whenever medically and/or financially feasible. Outcomes comparable to those obtained within the context of randomized trials can be expected in low-income settings if healthcare delivery is carefully planned. Our results indicate that concurrent and sequential regimens are equally effective in these patients.

Abstract: CXCL12 (stromal cell-derived factor-1, SDF-1), produced by stromal and endothelial cells including cells of the bone marrow, binds to its receptor CXCR4 and this axis regulates hematopoietic cell trafficking. Recently, osteoclast precursor cells were found to express CXCR4 and a potential role for the CXCL12–CXCR4 axis during osteoclast precursor cell recruitment/retention and development was proposed as a regulator of bone resorption. We examined the role of canonical Wnt signaling in regulating the expression of CXCL12 in bone marrow stromal cells. In mouse stromal ST2 cells, CXCL12 mRNA was expressed, while its expression was reduced in Wnt3a over-expressing ST2 (Wnt3a-ST2) cells or by treatment with lithium chloride (LiCl). Wnt3a decreased CXCL12 levels in culture supernatants from mouse bone marrow stromal cells. The culture supernatant from Wnt3a-ST2 cells also reduced migratory activity of bone marrow-derived cells in a Transwell migration assay. Silencing of glycogen synthase kinase-3β decreased CXCL12 expression, suggesting that the canonical Wnt signaling pathway regulates CXCL12 expression. In a transfection assay, LiCl down-regulated the activity of a reporter gene, a 1.8kb fragment of the 5′-flanking region of the CXCL12 gene. These results show that canonical Wnt signaling regulates CXCL12 gene expression at the transcriptional level, and this is the first study linking chemokine expression to canonical Wnt signaling.

Abstract: A mathematical model based on the Arrhenius equation is used to determine the acceleration of temperature dependent degradation processes affecting the performance of polymeric PV modules in artificial weathering over two benchmark climates. To take into account the natural variability of stress factors in outdoor environments, equivalent temperatures corresponding to photothermally and thermally activated degradation processes were calculated using detailed temperature and radiation data for these modules. Temperature and radiation data for the accelerated laboratory weathering part were derived from the implementation of an international standard for the weathering of plastics. Depending on the value of the activation energy and the reference outdoor location, acceleration factors ranging from 3 to 11 were calculated.

Abstract: Indium-free and acid-resistant anatase Nb-doped TiO2 (NTO) electrodes are promising as economical substitutes for high-cost Sn-doped In2O3 (ITO) films used in organic photovoltaics. By rapid-thermal annealing under an ambient vacuum, an insulating amorphous NTO film of low transparency was changed dramatically into a transparent and conductive anatase NTO electrode. Metallic conductivity of the annealed NTO electrode could be attributed to formation of the anatase phase and activation of the Nb dopant. Based on synchrotron X-ray scattering and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, the electrical properties of the NTO electrode could be correlated with the microstructure of the NTO film. The acid-stability of NTO film also supports its use as a substitute for ITO electrode. Unlike Ga:ZnO and Al:ZnO films, which were easily etched by acidic PEDOT:PSS solution, the NTO film was stable against this reagent. Importantly, the annealing temperature influenced the performance of the organic solar cell fabricated with the NTO electrode. This indicates that activation of Nb dopants and formation of the anatase phase play an important role in the extraction of carrier from the organic layer to the anode electrode.

Abstract: The most important potential application for VO2 is “smart windows”. Producing polymer—VO2 composite film is a practicable alternative for PVD film for windows retrofitting. Here the main work should be concentrated on preparing functional filler—VO2. In this paper, high quality single crystal VO2 nanopowder and the composite film coated with this powder had been prepared by a novel and facile route. A new vanadium precursor—V2O5·nH2O sol was fabricated by the dissolution reaction of V2O5 in H2O2. Adopting this sol, VO2 powder with an average size less than 20nm and narrower size distribution was obtained by pre-reduction and hydrothermal treatment. The as-prepared powder showed excellent optical properties in the composite film. The films reached a sufficiently high luminous transmittance (45–60%) and keeping thermochromic effect in infrared area very well—an abrupt transmittance change greater than 50% with the phase transition was observed. Its optical properties are comparable with high quality single layer VO2 film deposited by PVD method. The as-prepared nanopowder has a phase transition temperature (τc) about 55.5°C and it can be tuned down to ambient by slight tungsten doping without deteriorating the thermochromic properties, which made this powder very suitable for practical application. Based on our experiments, the τc reduction efficiency of tungsten was about −21.96K/at.%w in the doping range from 0 to 2.5at.%w.

Abstract: Cancer cells do not exist as pure homogeneous populations in vivo. Instead they are embedded in “cancer cell nests” that are surrounded by stromal cells, especially cancer associated fibroblasts. Thus, it is not unreasonable to suspect that stromal fibroblasts could influence the metabolism of adjacent cancer cells, and visa versa. In accordance with this idea, we have recently proposed that the Warburg effect in cancer cells may be due to culturing cancer cells by themselves, out of their normal stromal context or tumor microenvironment. In fact, when cancer cells are co-cultured with fibroblasts, then cancer cells increase their mitochondrial mass, while fibroblasts lose their mitochondria. An in depth analysis of this phenomenon reveals that aggressive cancer cells are “parasites” that use oxidative stress as a “weapon” to extract nutrients from surrounding stromal cells. Oxidative stress in fibroblasts induces the autophagic destruction of mitochondria, by mitophagy. Then, stromal cells are forced to undergo aerobic glycolysis, and produce energy-rich nutrients (such as lactate and ketones) to “feed” cancer cells. This mechanism would allow cancer cells to seed anywhere, without blood vessels as a food source, as they could simply induce oxidative stress wherever they go, explaining how cancer cells survive during metastasis. We suggest that stromal catabolism, via autophagy and mitophagy, fuels the anabolic growth of tumor cells, promoting tumor progression and metastasis. We have previously termed this new paradigm “The Autophagic Tumor Stroma Model of Cancer Metabolism”, or the “Reverse Warburg Effect”. We also discuss how glutamine addiction (glutaminolysis) in cancer cells fits well with this new model, by promoting oxidative mitochondrial metabolism in aggressive cancer cells.

Abstract: A dual-type electrochromic device was assembled using optically transparent electrodes modified with thin films of poly[(R)-(-)-3-(1-pyrrolyl)propyl-N-(3,5-dinitrobenzoyl)-α-phenylglycinate], poly(DNBP) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene), PEDOT and a polymer electrolyte. After assembling, the device was characterized by spectroelectrochemical techniques. The best performance of this device could be obtained by adjusting the relative thickness of the active polymer films and the potential range of operation of the device. The device shows color variation during ca. 350 charge/discharge cycles and can be constructed under atmospheric conditions.

Abstract: The role of ER stress on hepatic steatosis was investigated in a rat model. We injected CCl4 into rats and found that CCl4 could induce hepatic lipid accumulation, confirmed by Oil Red O staining and by measurement of triglyceride and cholesterol. The expression of ApoB, an apolipoprotein, was decreased in plasma and increased in the liver of CCl4-treated animals. The ER stress response was also significantly increased by CCl4. P450 2E1 expression and activity were increased through interactions of P450 2E1 with NADPH-dependent P450 reductase (NPR) under CCl4-treated conditions. In HepG2 cells, intracellular lipid accumulation and its signaling were comparable to in vivo results. In order to elucidate the effect of the ER stress response itself, tunicamycin, an N-acetyl-glycosylation inhibitor, was injected into rats, followed by Oil Red O staining, lipid/triglyceride/cholesterol accumulation analysis, and examination of ApoB expression. Additionally, the ER stress response and upregulation of P450 2E1 were also confirmed in the tunicamycin-treated rats. All of the responses were similar to those seen with CCl4. The P450 2E1 inhibitor diallyl sulphide (DAS), N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and reduced glutathione (GSH) antioxidants also regulated processes, including ApoB expression and lipid accumulation in CCl4-treated animals. In the presence of tunicamycin, DAS or NAC/GSH regulated all of the pathological phenomena with the exception of the ER stress response. In summary, CCl4 induces liver steatosis, a process involving ER stress-induced P450 2E1 activation and ROS production.

Abstract: This is a study of the recycling of crystalline solar cells by incorporating them in cement matrices. The hydration process of a mixture of calcium aluminate cement (CAC) and solar photovoltaic cell waste was researched and analyzed. The nature of the hydration products of various compositions of these mixtures was evaluated at a temperature of 20°C by analyzing the samples through X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The total porosity and mechanical strength development of these materials were also determined. It was revealed that the presence of a solar cell residue of up to 5% in the cement matrices does not result in new hydration products that are different from those derived from the normal hydration of the CAC cement. Moreover, the material developed can be considered as an expansive cement blend because it releases H2 at early stages. The presence of waste causes a decrease in the mechanical strength and an increase in the total porosity of this material, but it can be used for applications such as thermal insulation.

Abstract: Using upgraded metallurgical-grade silicon (UMG-Si) is a cost-effective and energy-efficient approach for the production of solar cells. Grain boundaries (GBs) play a major role in determining the device performance of multicrystalline Si (mc-Si) solar cells. In this study two UMG-Si wafers, one from the middle part of a brick and the other from the top part of the same brick, were investigated. An excellent correlation was found between the grain misorientation and the corresponding optical response of GBs as indicated by photoluminescence (PL) imaging, electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD), and cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In addition, the PL features at random GBs depend also on the impurity levels in the wafer. In particular the PL emission was greatly enhanced in the narrow regions close to the random GB in the top wafer, which is an interesting phenomenon that may have potential application in high efficiency light-emission diodes (LEDs) based on Si.

Abstract: Undoped and 2% Ga-doped ZnO films have been deposited by RF magnetron sputtering onto single crystal Si (100) substrates equivalent to the commercial Si solar cells. The same films were also grown on amorphous silica substrates to complete their characterization. The films have been characterized by X-ray diffraction, electrical and optical measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman microspectroscopy and scanning and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Films present a very good quality crystalline wurtzite structure with the c-axis perpendicular to the substrate, with continuity of the (0002) planes along the whole film, as shown by transmission electron microscopy. The doped sample shows an increase of two orders of magnitude of the electrical conductivity, an optical transmittance bigger than 85% along the visible spectrum, a diminution of the grain size in the direction parallel to the substrate and a lower surface roughness. The Ga-cations act only as substitutional impurities, they are homogeneously distributed in the whole film, maintaining the wurtzite structure and increasing the carrier density. The formation of any spurious phase or segregation of Ga2O3 clusters that can act as carrier traps can be discarded. The characterization results allow us to conclude that the doped film has improved electrical and optical properties with respect to the undoped one. Therefore, the Ga-doped films are very suitable candidates as transparent conducting electrodes for solar cells, displays and other photoelectronic devices.

Abstract: This paper investigates the snow melting process on asphalt pavements as solar collector by experiments and numerical simulation. A numerical simulation method was used to predict the general design requirements for snow melting system of asphalt pavements, and a type of experimental asphalt snow melting system has been built using the design parameters obtained from the preceding simulation. Graphite powders were used to improve the thermal conductivity of asphalt concrete and thus resulting in an improved efficiency of asphalt collector. A laboratory snow melting test was performed after real snowstorm events. The effects of thermal conductive asphalt concrete (CAC) on snow melting performance and asphalt pavement temperature distribution were evaluated. The heat transfer in the asphalt slabs and the heat requirement for the snow melting were analyzed. The results that are obtained show that asphalt solar collector (ASC) provides us a better alternative method for snow melting. The higher fluid temperature is a positive way to improve the performance of snow melting system. However, it is unnecessary to keep a too high fluid temperature so as to reduce the waste of energy. The non-uniform temperatures in the asphalt slabs are noticeable. Furthermore, the heat-transmission and the snow melting performance can be enhanced using CAC.

Abstract: In this work, we examine the optical properties of gallium-doped ZnO (GZO) thin films grown by pulsed laser deposition with varying oxygen pressures and substrate temperatures. In analyzing the optical properties of the thin films, we use a normalized transparency index that is directed at quantifying the transmission for usage as electrodes in photovoltaic devices. With this, we can clearly show the influence of oxygen on the transmission for different wavelengths. This allows us to clearly dissect the influence of band gap, oxygen pressure and carrier concentration on transparency. We achieved GZO films with a transparency index of 0.84 at room temperature and an improved index of 0.92 (92% of total solar spectrum transmitted) at a substrate temperature of 500°C. The room temperature films, in particular, showed excellent transparency and conductivity, which are useful for use as electrodes in organic devices.

Abstract: Progressive renal disease is characterized by accumulation of extracellular matrix in the renal cortex. Proximal tubular cells (PTC) may contribute to disease through a process of epithelial–mesenchymal-transition (EMT): phenotypic change, disruption of the tubular basement membrane and migration into the interstitium. Hyaluronan (HA) synthesis and its extracellular organization by hyaladherins affect cell fate in other systems: this study investigated the role of the hyaladherin, tumour necrosis factor-stimulated gene (TSG)-6, in PTC EMT triggered in vitro by transforming growth factor (TGF)β1. TGFβ1 triggered the loss of PTC epithelial phenotype with 60% decreased expression of E-cadherin and 2–3-fold induction of alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-sma). It also increased the expression of TSG-6, HA-synthase-(HAS)2 and the HA-receptor, CD44, to a peak at 8–12h, remaining elevated thereafter. Immuno-localization of HA demonstrated that unstimulated PTC assembled HA in cables and that treatment with TGFβ1 initiated cable disassembly with formation of dense HA-pericellular coats. Stable knockdown of TSG-6 with short-hairpin-RNA increased E-cadherin and HAS2 expression, produced loose HA-pericellular coats, HA cables were absent and cell migration was slowed. Treatment of transfectants with TGFβ1 did not induce α-sma, alter E-cadherin, pericellular-HA or migration but did induce HAS2. This was dependent on the expression of CD44 and was inhibited by CD44-specific siRNA. In summary, TSG-6 was central to EMT through effects on HA macromolecular structure and through CD44-dependent triggering of cell responses. These findings suggest that controlling the assembly of HA by proximal tubular cells may be a novel approach towards intervention in renal disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
Stem cells from umbilical cord blood (CB) have increasingly become a viable alternate source of progenitor cells for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HSCT). Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is thought to contribute significantly to HSCT morbidity and mortality.
DESIGN AND SETTING
Retrospective case-control study in patients at tertiary care center.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
We determined the incidence, risk factors and outcomes for CMV infection and disease after unrelated cord blood transplantation (UCBT) in children.
RESULTS
Between 2003 and 2007, 73 pediatric patients underwent UCBT and 68% of recipients were CMV seropositive. The overall incidence of CMV infection, early and late CMV infection was 58.9% (43/73), 62.8% (27/43), and 37.4% (16/43), respectively. In patients with early CMV infection, 6 of 27 (22%) patients progressed to develop CMV end-organ disease including pneumonitis and retinitis. High levels CMV antigenemia ≥70 infected cells by pp65 antigenemia assay+PMNs, P=.237) were associated with a higher risk of progression to CMV disease. The development of CMV infections was higher in CMV-seropositive recipients (P<.001) and in those who developed graft-versus-host-diseases (GVHD) (P<.001). Other risk factors for CMV infection include the use of high-dose corticosteroids (P<.001) and older age of the recipient at the time of transplant (P<.002). Late CMV infection was strongly associated with a previous history of early CMV infection (P<.001).
CONCLUSION
CMV infection is a significant complication in UCBT recipients in pediatric patients and is associated with an increase in transplant-related morbidity and mortality. Risk factors for CMV infections after UCBT include GVHD, use of corticosteroids, underlying diseases (hematologic malignancies) and older age. Late CMV infection was strongly associated with a previous history of CMV infection.

Abstract: As a phase change material (PCM), acetamide (AC) can be a potential candidate for energy storage application in the active solar systems. Its utilization is however hampered by poor thermal conductivity. In this work, AC/expanded graphite (EG) composite PCM with 10wt% (mass fraction) EG as the effective heat transfer promoter was prepared; its thermal properties were studied and compared with those of pure AC. Transient hot-wire tests showed that the addition of 10wt% EG led to about five-fold increase in thermal conductivity. Investigations using a differential scanning calorimeter revealed that the melting/freezing points shifted from 66.95/42.46°C for pure AC to 65.91/65.52°C for AC/EG composite, and the latent heat decreased from 194.92 to 163.71kJkg−1. In addition, heat storage and retrieval tests in a latent thermal energy storage unit showed that the heat storage and retrieval durations were reduced by 45% and 78%, respectively. Further numerical investigations demonstrated that the less improvement in heat transfer rate during the storage process could be attributed to the weakened natural convection in liquid (melted) AC because of the presence of EG.

Abstract: This study describes the utilization of a novel conjugated copolymer, namely, poly[2,3-bis(thiophen-2-yl)-acrylonitrile-9,9′-dioctyl-fluorene] (FLC8) for organic solar cell application for the first time. The highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of FLC8 are −5.68 and −3.55eV, respectively, which lie between the corresponding values of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methylester (PCBM). In addition, both electron and hole mobilities of FLC8 are in the range of 10−4 (cm2/Vs), making it an excellent ambipolar polymer. Such unique properties make FLC8 a good candidate to form a ternary cascade bulk-heterojunction organic solar cell when blending with P3HT and PCBM. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the ternary cascade solar cell can be increased by up to 30% as compared with the reference cell without FLC8. We suspect that this enhancement of PCE is caused by the additional charge separation offered by the cascade structure and the fast charge transfer due to the ambipolarity of FLC8.
