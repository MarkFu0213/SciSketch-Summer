Abstract: Summary
53BP1 activity drives genome instability and lethality in BRCA1-deficient mice by inhibiting homologous recombination (HR). The anti-recombinogenic functions of 53BP1 require phosphorylation-dependent interactions with PTIP and RIF1/shieldin effector complexes. While RIF1/shieldin blocks 5′-3′ nucleolytic processing of DNA ends, it remains unclear how PTIP antagonizes HR. Here, we show that mutation of the PTIP interaction site in 53BP1 (S25A) allows sufficient DNA2-dependent end resection to rescue the lethality of BRCA1Δ11 mice, despite increasing RIF1 “end-blocking” at DNA damage sites. However, double-mutant cells fail to complete HR, as excessive shieldin activity also inhibits RNF168-mediated loading of PALB2/RAD51. As a result, BRCA1Δ1153BP1S25A mice exhibit hallmark features of HR insufficiency, including premature aging and hypersensitivity to PARPi. Disruption of shieldin or forced targeting of PALB2 to ssDNA in BRCA1D1153BP1S25A cells restores RNF168 recruitment, RAD51 nucleofilament formation, and PARPi resistance. Our study therefore reveals a critical function of shieldin post-resection that limits the loading of RAD51.

Abstract: Summary
Eukaryotic genomes are organized within the nucleus through interactions with inner nuclear membrane (INM) proteins. How chromatin tethering to the INM is controlled in interphase and how this process contributes to subsequent mitotic nuclear envelope (NE) remodeling remains unclear. We have probed these fundamental questions using the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces japonicus, which breaks and reforms the NE during mitosis. We show that attachments between heterochromatin and the transmembrane Lem2-Nur1 complex at the INM are remodeled in interphase by the ESCRT-III/Vps4 machinery. Failure of ESCRT-III/Vps4 to release Lem2-Nur1 from heterochromatin leads to persistent association of chromosomes with the INM throughout mitosis. At mitotic exit, such trapping of Lem2-Nur1 on heterochromatin prevents it from re-establishing nucleocytoplasmic compartmentalization. Our work identifies the Lem2-Nur1 complex as a substrate for the nuclear ESCRT machinery and explains how the dynamic tethering of chromosomes to the INM is linked to the establishment of nuclear compartmentalization.

Abstract: Summary
Axonal regeneration in the central nervous system (CNS) is a highly energy-demanding process. Extrinsic insults and intrinsic restrictions lead to an energy crisis in injured axons, raising the question of whether recovering energy deficits facilitates regeneration. Here, we reveal that enhancing axonal mitochondrial transport by deleting syntaphilin (Snph) recovers injury-induced mitochondrial depolarization. Using three CNS injury mouse models, we demonstrate that Snph−/− mice display enhanced corticospinal tract (CST) regeneration passing through a spinal cord lesion, accelerated regrowth of monoaminergic axons across a transection gap, and increased compensatory sprouting of uninjured CST. Notably, regenerated CST axons form functional synapses and promote motor functional recovery. Administration of the bioenergetic compound creatine boosts CST regenerative capacity in Snph−/− mice. Our study provides mechanistic insights into intrinsic regeneration failure in CNS and suggests that enhancing mitochondrial transport and cellular energetics are promising strategies to promote regeneration and functional restoration after CNS injuries.

Abstract: Summary
In preparation for transcription, the chromatin remodeler SWR installs homotypic ZZ nucleosomes at promoters by replacing the two nucleosomal H2A with H2A.Z in a stepwise manner. Nucleosome-free regions (NFRs) help recruit SWR to promoters; this is thought to position SWR asymmetrically on one side of the +1 nucleosome. How SWR accesses the opposite side of +1 to generate a ZZ nucleosome remains unclear. Using biochemical assays that monitor the sub-nucleosomal position of nascent H2A.Z, we find that NFR-recruited SWR switches sides to insert H2A.Z into asymmetrically positioned nucleosomes; however, at decreasing temperatures, H2A.Z insertion becomes progressively biased for one side. We find that a 16-bp element containing G/C runs (>3 consecutive G or C nucleotides) is sufficient to promote H2A.Z insertion. Because H2A.Z-rich +1 nucleosomes in yeast have more G/C runs, we propose that nucleosome editing is a thermosensitive process that can be hard coded by the genome.

Abstract: Summary
We investigate the three-dimensional (3D) conformations of the α-globin locus at the single-allele level in murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and erythroid cells, combining polymer physics models and high-resolution Capture-C data. Model predictions are validated against independent fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) data measuring pairwise distances, and Tri-C data identifying three-way contacts. The architecture is rearranged during the transition from ESCs to erythroid cells, associated with the activation of the globin genes. We find that in ESCs, the spatial organization conforms to a highly intermingled 3D structure involving non-specific contacts, whereas in erythroid cells the α-globin genes and their enhancers form a self-contained domain, arranged in a folded hairpin conformation, separated from intermingling flanking regions by a thermodynamic mechanism of micro-phase separation. The flanking regions are rich in convergent CTCF sites, which only marginally participate in the erythroid-specific gene-enhancer contacts, suggesting that beyond the interaction of CTCF sites, multiple molecular mechanisms cooperate to form an interacting domain.

Abstract: To investigate the protective function of low-level laser irradiation (LLLI) against ionizing irradiation and explore the molecular mechanism of photomodulation of Nrf2 protein, the impact of LLLI (635 nm, 5.7 J/cm2) before 2 Gy gamma ray radiation of radio-sensitive tissue hematopoietic stem cells was evaluated. As a result, reduced levels of reactive oxygen species and increased expression of antioxidant enzymes were detected. Moreover, increased expression of Nrf2 was observed after LLLI, whereas brusatol pretreatment before LLLI abolished this effect. In vivo, transplantation of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) was employed for therapy of hematopoietic function in an acute radiation sickness (H-ARS) mouse model, which was induced by 6-Gy ionizing irradiation; different hUC-MSC pretreatments including LLLI and Nrf2 RNAi were accounted for during experimental grouping. LLLI treatment of cells significantly increased the erythrocyte count and number of myelopoiesis clones (P < 0.05), but such improvements were reduced by Nrf2 RNAi pretreatment compared with cells transplanted without intervention. Therefore, LLLI may improve the radiation protection effect through molecular mechanisms related to the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway.

Abstract: Summary
PDGFRα+ mesenchymal progenitor cells are associated with pathological fibro-adipogenic processes. Conversely, a beneficial role for these cells during homeostasis or in response to revascularization and regeneration stimuli is suggested, but remains to be defined. We studied the molecular profile and function of PDGFRα+ cells in order to understand the mechanisms underlying their role in fibrosis versus regeneration. We show that PDGFRα+ cells are essential for tissue revascularization and restructuring through injury-stimulated remodeling of stromal and vascular components, context-dependent clonal expansion, and ultimate removal of pro-fibrotic PDGFRα+-derived cells. Tissue ischemia modulates the PDGFRα+ phenotype toward cells capable of remodeling the extracellular matrix and inducing cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion, likely favoring tissue repair. Conversely, pathological healing occurs if PDGFRα+-derived cells persist as terminally differentiated mesenchymal cells. These studies support a context-dependent “yin-yang” biology of tissue-resident mesenchymal progenitor cells, which possess an innate ability to limit injury expansion while also promoting fibrosis in an unfavorable environment.

Abstract: Summary
Regulation of transcription is the main mechanism responsible for precise control of gene expression. Whereas the majority of transcriptional regulation is mediated by DNA-binding transcription factors that bind to regulatory gene regions, an elegant alternative strategy employs small RNA guides, Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) to identify targets of transcriptional repression. Here, we show that in Drosophila the small ubiquitin-like protein SUMO and the SUMO E3 ligase Su(var)2-10 are required for piRNA-guided deposition of repressive chromatin marks and transcriptional silencing of piRNA targets. Su(var)2-10 links the piRNA-guided target recognition complex to the silencing effector by binding the piRNA/Piwi complex and inducing SUMO-dependent recruitment of the SetDB1/Wde histone methyltransferase effector. We propose that in Drosophila, the nuclear piRNA pathway has co-opted a conserved mechanism of SUMO-dependent recruitment of the SetDB1/Wde chromatin modifier to confer repression of genomic parasites.

Abstract: Summary
Although metabolic adaptations have been demonstrated to be essential for tumor cell proliferation, the metabolic underpinnings of tumor initiation are poorly understood. We found that the earliest stages of colorectal cancer (CRC) initiation are marked by a glycolytic metabolic signature, including downregulation of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC), which couples glycolysis and glucose oxidation through mitochondrial pyruvate import. Genetic studies in Drosophila suggest that this downregulation is required because hyperplasia caused by loss of the Apc or Notch tumor suppressors in intestinal stem cells can be completely blocked by MPC overexpression. Moreover, in two distinct CRC mouse models, loss of Mpc1 prior to a tumorigenic stimulus doubled the frequency of adenoma formation and produced higher grade tumors. MPC loss was associated with a glycolytic metabolic phenotype and increased expression of stem cell markers. These data suggest that changes in cellular pyruvate metabolism are necessary and sufficient to promote cancer initiation.

Abstract: An important component of breast milk, calcium also appears as radiographically prominent microcalcifications in breast tissue that are often the earliest sign of malignancy. Ionic Ca2+ is a universal second messenger that controls a wide swathe of effector pathways integral to gene transcription, cell cycle control, differentiation, proliferation, cell migration, and apoptosis. Whereas prolonged elevation in resting Ca2+ levels drives proliferation to initiate and sustain tumor growth, depletion of calcium stores and attenuation of calcium influx pathways underlies tumor chemoresistance and evasion of apoptosis. This paradox of Ca2+ homeostasis highlights the challenge of targeting Ca2+ signaling pathways for breast cancer therapy. Furthermore, breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease classified into distinct subtypes based on tumor origin, stage of invasiveness and hormone receptor status. Classification is important for tailoring treatment, and in predicting clinical outcome or response to chemotherapy. There have been numerous reports of dysregulated expression, localization or activity of Ca2+ channels, regulators and pumps in breast cancer. An important aspect of these alterations is that they are specific to breast cancer subtype, as exemplified by a reciprocal switch in secretory pathway Ca2+-ATPase isoforms SPCA1 and SPCA2 depending on receptor status. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge of subtype specific changes in calcium channels and pumps, with a focus on functional insights that may inform new opportunities for breast cancer therapy.

Abstract: Varicocele, which is one of the causes of infertility in men, can be defined as the expansion of spermatic cord veins. The presence of apelin and apelin receptor (APJ) in many tissues and the effects of apelin have been reported in several studies. There is no study showing apelin and APJ protein expressions in normal and varicocele-induced testicular tissues. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate varicocele-induced changes in apelin and APJ expressions in testicular tissue by immunohistochemical and western blotting techniques. In our study, Wistar male rats were randomly divided into three groups as control, varicocele, and sham. While the control group rats were not subjected to any treatment, the unilateral varicocele model was created under anesthesia in the varicocele group. In the sham group, the left abdominal region was opened and closed to exclude the effect of the surgical procedure. At the 13th postoperative week, the left testes were obtained under anesthesia in all groups, and the immunohistochemistry and Western blotting techniques were used to detect apelin and APJ expressions. In our study; apelin and APJ were significantly expressed in control group’s testicular tissue; apelin in testicular tissues of varicocele groups increased compared to the control group, whereas APJ expression decreased. In conclusion, the presence of apelin/APJ system in normal testis and the increased expression of apelin in varicocele-induced testicular tissue suggested that apelin may have a role in the varicocele etiopathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a multisystemic genetic disorder caused by the CTG repeat expansion in the 3′-untranslated region of DMPK gene. Heart dysfunctions occur in ∼80% of DM1 patients and are the second leading cause of DM1-related deaths. Herein, we report that upregulation of a non-muscle splice isoform of RNA-binding protein RBFOX2 in DM1 heart tissue—due to altered splicing factor and microRNA activities—induces cardiac conduction defects in DM1 individuals. Mice engineered to express the non-muscle RBFOX240 isoform in heart via tetracycline-inducible transgenesis, or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing, reproduced DM1-related cardiac conduction delay and spontaneous episodes of arrhythmia. Further, by integrating RNA binding with cardiac transcriptome datasets from DM1 patients and mice expressing the non-muscle RBFOX2 isoform, we identified RBFOX240-driven splicing defects in voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels, which alter their electrophysiological properties. Thus, our results uncover a trans-dominant role for an aberrantly expressed RBFOX240 isoform in DM1 cardiac pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The HIV latent reservoir forms the major hurdle to an HIV cure. The discovery of CD32 as marker of this reservoir has aroused much interest, but subsequent reports have challenged this finding. Here, we observe a positive correlation between the percentages of CD32+ cells among CD4+ T cells of aviremic cART-treated, HIV-infected individuals and their HIV DNA loads in peripheral blood. Moreover, optimization of the CD32+CD4+ T cell purification protocol reveals prominent enrichment for HIV DNA (mean, 292-fold) in these cells. However, no enrichment for HIV RNA is observed in CD32+CD4+ cells, yielding significantly reduced HIV RNA/DNA ratios. Furthermore, HIV proviruses in CD32+CD4+ cells can be reactivated ex vivo to produce virus, strongly suggesting that these cells support HIV transcriptional latency. Our results underscore the importance of isolating pure, bona fide CD32+CD4+ T cells for future studies and indicate that CD32 remains a promising candidate marker of the HIV reservoir.

Abstract: Summary
Cells respond to environmental changes by toggling metabolic pathways, preparing for homeostasis, and anticipating future stresses. For example, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, carbon stress-induced gluconeogenesis is terminated upon glucose availability, a process that involves the multiprotein E3 ligase GIDSR4 recruiting N termini and catalyzing ubiquitylation of gluconeogenic enzymes. Here, genetics, biochemistry, and cryoelectron microscopy define molecular underpinnings of glucose-induced degradation. Unexpectedly, carbon stress induces an inactive anticipatory complex (GIDAnt), which awaits a glucose-induced substrate receptor to form the active GIDSR4. Meanwhile, other environmental perturbations elicit production of an alternative substrate receptor assembling into a related E3 ligase complex. The intricate structure of GIDAnt enables anticipating and ultimately binding various N-degron-targeting (i.e., “N-end rule”) substrate receptors, while the GIDSR4 E3 forms a clamp-like structure juxtaposing substrate lysines with the ubiquitylation active site. The data reveal evolutionarily conserved GID complexes as a family of multisubunit E3 ubiquitin ligases responsive to extracellular stimuli.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanistic or mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is an important regulator of effector functions, proliferation, and cellular metabolism in macrophages. The biochemical processes that are controlled by mTORC1 are still being defined. Here, we demonstrate that integrative multiomics in conjunction with a data-driven inverse modeling approach, termed COVRECON, identifies a biochemical node that influences overall metabolic profiles and reactions of mTORC1-dependent macrophage metabolism. Using a combined approach of metabolomics, proteomics, mRNA expression analysis, and enzymatic activity measurements, we demonstrate that Tsc2, a negative regulator of mTORC1 signaling, critically influences the cellular activity of macrophages by regulating the enzyme phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (Phgdh) in an mTORC1-dependent manner. More generally, while lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages repress Phgdh activity, IL-4-stimulated macrophages increase the activity of the enzyme required for the expression of key anti-inflammatory molecules and macrophage proliferation. Thus, we identify Phgdh as a metabolic checkpoint of M2 macrophages.

Abstract: Summary
Enzymatic processing of DNA underlies all DNA repair, yet inappropriate DNA processing must be avoided. In vertebrates, double-strand breaks are repaired predominantly by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which directly ligates DNA ends. NHEJ has the potential to be highly mutagenic because it uses DNA polymerases, nucleases, and other enzymes that modify incompatible DNA ends to allow their ligation. Using frog egg extracts that recapitulate NHEJ, we show that end processing requires the formation of a “short-range synaptic complex” in which DNA ends are closely aligned in a ligation-competent state. Furthermore, single-molecule imaging directly demonstrates that processing occurs within the short-range complex. This confinement of end processing to a ligation-competent complex ensures that DNA ends undergo ligation as soon as they become compatible, thereby minimizing mutagenesis. Our results illustrate how the coordination of enzymatic catalysis with higher-order structural organization of substrate maximizes the fidelity of DNA repair.

Abstract: Summary
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from the progressive loss of β cells, a process propagated by pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling that disrupts the balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins. To identify proteins involved in this process, we performed comprehensive proteomics of human pancreatic islets treated with interleukin-1β and interferon-γ, leading to the identification of 11,324 proteins, of which 387 were significantly regulated by treatment. We then tested the function of growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), which was repressed by the treatment. We found that GDF15 translation was blocked during inflammation, and it was depleted in islets from individuals with T1D. The addition of exogenous GDF15 inhibited interleukin-1β+interferon-γ-induced apoptosis of human islets. Administration of GDF15 reduced by 53% the incidence of diabetes in NOD mice. Our approach provides a unique resource for the identification of the human islet proteins regulated by cytokines and was effective in discovering a potential target for T1D therapy.

Abstract: Summary
N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most abundant internal mRNA modification, and N6,2′-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am), found at the first-transcribed nucleotide, are two reversible epitranscriptomic marks. However, the profiles and distribution patterns of m6A and m6Am across human and mouse tissues are poorly characterized. Here, we report the m6A and m6Am methylome through profiling of 43 human and 16 mouse tissues and demonstrate strongest tissue specificity for the brain tissues. A small subset of tissue-specific m6A peaks can also readily classify tissue types. The overall m6A and m6Am level is partially correlated with the expression level of their writers and erasers. Additionally, the m6A-containing regions are enriched for SNPs. Furthermore, cross-species analysis revealed that species rather than tissue type is the primary determinant of methylation. Collectively, our study provides an in-depth resource for dissecting the landscape and regulation of the m6A and m6Am epitranscriptomic marks across mammalian tissues.

Abstract: Summary
Regulation of translation is essential during stress. However, the precise sets of proteins regulated by the key translational stress responses—the integrated stress response (ISR) and mTORC1—remain elusive. We developed multiplexed enhanced protein dynamics (mePROD) proteomics, adding signal amplification to dynamic-SILAC and multiplexing, to enable measuring acute changes in protein synthesis. Treating cells with ISR/mTORC1-modulating stressors, we showed extensive translatome modulation with ∼20% of proteins synthesized at highly reduced rates. Comparing translation-deficient sub-proteomes revealed an extensive overlap demonstrating that target specificity is achieved on protein level and not by pathway activation. Titrating cap-dependent translation inhibition confirmed that synthesis of individual proteins is controlled by intrinsic properties responding to global translation attenuation. This study reports a highly sensitive method to measure relative translation at the nascent chain level and provides insight into how the ISR and mTORC1, two key cellular pathways, regulate the translatome to guide cellular survival upon stress.

Abstract: Bovine S100 G (calbindin D9k, small Ca2+-binding protein of the EF-hand superfamily) is considered as a calcium buffer protein; i.e., the binding of Ca2+ practically does not change its general conformation. A set of experimental approaches has been used to study structural properties of apo- and Ca2+-loaded forms of mouse S100 G (81.4% identity in amino acid sequence with bovine S100 G). This analysis revealed that, in contrast to bovine S100 G, the removal of calcium ions increases α-helices content of mouse S100 G protein and enhances its accessibility to digestion by α-chymotrypsin. Furthermore, mouse apo-S100 G is characterized by a decreased surface hydrophobicity and reduced tendency for oligomerization. Such behavior is typical of calcium sensor proteins. Apo-state of mouse S100 G still has rather compact structure, which can be cooperatively unfolded by temperature and GdnHCl. Computational analysis of amino acid sequences of S100 G proteins shows that these proteins could be in a disordered state upon a removal of the bound calcium ions. The experimental data show that, although mouse apo-S100 G is flexible compared to the Ca2+-loaded state, the apo-form is not completely disordered and preserves some cooperatively meting structure. The origin of the unexpectedly high stability of mouse S100 G can be rationalized by an exceptionally strong association of its N- and C-terminal parts containing the EF-hands I and II, respectively.

Abstract: Summary
The intact vaginal epithelium is essential for women’s reproductive health and provides protection against HIV and sexually transmitted infections. How this epithelium maintains itself remains poorly understood. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to define the diverse cell populations in the vaginal epithelium. We show that vaginal epithelial cell proliferation is limited to the basal compartment without any obvious label-retaining cells. Furthermore, we developed vaginal organoids and show that the basal cells have increased organoid forming efficiency. Importantly, Axin2 marks a self-renewing subpopulation of basal cells that gives rise to differentiated cells over time. These cells are ovariectomy-resistant stem cells as they proliferate even in the absence of hormones. Upon hormone supplementation, these cells expand and reconstitute the entire vaginal epithelium. Wnt/β-catenin is essential for the proliferation and differentiation of vaginal stem cells. Together, these data define heterogeneity in vaginal epithelium and identify vaginal epithelial stem cells.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) RelA is the potent transcriptional activator of inflammatory response genes. We stringently defined a list of direct RelA target genes by integrating physical (chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing [ChIP-seq]) and functional (RNA sequencing [RNA-seq] in knockouts) datasets. We then dissected each gene’s regulatory strategy by testing RelA variants in a primary-cell genetic-complementation assay. All endogenous target genes require RelA to make DNA-base-specific contacts, and none are activatable by the DNA binding domain alone. However, endogenous target genes differ widely in how they employ the two transactivation domains. Through model-aided analysis of the dynamic time-course data, we reveal the gene-specific synergy and redundancy of TA1 and TA2. Given that post-translational modifications control TA1 activity and intrinsic affinity for coactivators determines TA2 activity, the differential TA logics suggests context-dependent versus context-independent control of endogenous RelA-target genes. Although some inflammatory initiators appear to require co-stimulatory TA1 activation, inflammatory resolvers are a part of the NF-κB RelA core response.

Abstract: Summary
The family of bacterial SidE enzymes catalyzes non-canonical phosphoribosyl-linked (PR) serine ubiquitination and promotes infectivity of Legionella pneumophila. Here, we describe identification of two bacterial effectors that reverse PR ubiquitination and are thus named deubiquitinases for PR ubiquitination (DUPs; DupA and DupB). Structural analyses revealed that DupA and SidE ubiquitin ligases harbor a highly homologous catalytic phosphodiesterase (PDE) domain. However, unlike SidE ubiquitin ligases, DupA displays increased affinity to PR-ubiquitinated substrates, which allows DupA to cleave PR ubiquitin from substrates. Interfering with DupA-ubiquitin binding switches its activity toward SidE-type ligase. Given the high affinity of DupA to PR-ubiquitinated substrates, we exploited a catalytically inactive DupA mutant to trap and identify more than 180 PR-ubiquitinated host proteins in Legionella-infected cells. Proteins involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) fragmentation and membrane recruitment to Legionella-containing vacuoles (LCV) emerged as major SidE targets. The global map of PR-ubiquitinated substrates provides critical insights into host-pathogen interactions during Legionella infection.

Abstract: Inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) is required for the biosynthesis of inositol phosphates (IPs) through the phosphorylation of multiple IP metabolites such as IP3 and IP4. The biological significance of IPMK’s catalytic actions to regulate cellular signaling events such as growth and metabolism has been studied extensively. However, pharmacological reagents that inhibit IPMK have not yet been identified. We employed a structure-based virtual screening of publicly available U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs and chemicals that identified the antidepressant, vilazodone, as an IPMK inhibitor. Docking simulations and pharmacophore analyses showed that vilazodone has a higher affinity for the ATP-binding catalytic region of IPMK than ATP and we validated that vilazodone inhibits IPMK’s IP kinase activities in vitro. The incubation of vilazodone with NIH3T3-L1 fibroblasts reduced cellular levels of IP5 and other highly phosphorylated IPs without influencing IP4 levels. We further found decreased Akt phosphorylation in vilazodone-treated HCT116 cancer cells. These data clearly indicate selective cellular actions of vilazodone against IPMK-dependent catalytic steps in IP metabolism and Akt activation. Collectively, our data demonstrate vilazodone as a method to inhibit cellular IPMK, providing a valuable pharmacological agent to study and target the biological and pathological processes governed by IPMK.

Abstract: Summary
The mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system comprises complexes assembled from subunits derived from mitochondrial and nuclear gene expression. Both genetic systems are coordinated by feedback loops, which control the synthesis of specific mitochondrial encoded subunits. Here, we studied how this occurs in the case of cytochrome b, a key subunit of mitochondrial complex III. Our data suggest the presence of a molecular rheostat consisting of two translational activators, Cbp3-Cbp6 and Cbs1, which operates at the mitoribosomal tunnel exit to connect translational output with assembly efficiency. When Cbp3-Cbp6 is engaged in assembly of cytochrome b, Cbs1 binds to the tunnel exit to sequester the cytochrome b-encoding mRNA, repressing its translation. After mediating complex III assembly, binding of Cbp3-Cbp6 to the tunnel exit replaces Cbs1 and the bound mRNA to permit cytochrome b synthesis. Collectively, the data indicate the molecular wiring of a feedback loop to regulate synthesis of a mitochondrial encoded protein.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial preproteins contain amino-terminal presequences directing them to the presequence translocase of the mitochondrial inner membrane (TIM23 complex). Depending on additional downstream import signals, TIM23 either inserts preproteins into the inner membrane or translocates them into the matrix. Matrix import requires the coupling of the presequence translocase-associated motor (PAM) to TIM23. The molecular mechanisms coordinating preprotein recognition by TIM23 in the intermembrane space (IMS) with PAM activation in the matrix are unknown. Here we show that subsequent to presequence recognition in the IMS, the Tim50 matrix domain facilitates the recruitment of the coupling factor Pam17. Next, the IMS domain of Tim50 promotes PAM recruitment to TIM23. Finally, the Tim50 transmembrane segment stimulates the matrix-directed import-driving force exerted by PAM. We propose that recognition of preprotein segments in the IMS and transfer of signal information across the inner membrane by Tim50 determine import motor activation.

Abstract: Summary
BIN1, a member of the BAR adaptor protein family, is a significant late-onset Alzheimer disease risk factor. Here, we investigate BIN1 function in the brain using conditional knockout (cKO) models. Loss of neuronal Bin1 expression results in the select impairment of spatial learning and memory. Examination of hippocampal CA1 excitatory synapses reveals a deficit in presynaptic release probability and slower depletion of neurotransmitters during repetitive stimulation, suggesting altered vesicle dynamics in Bin1 cKO mice. Super-resolution and immunoelectron microscopy localizes BIN1 to presynaptic sites in excitatory synapses. Bin1 cKO significantly reduces synapse density and alters presynaptic active zone protein cluster formation. Finally, 3D electron microscopy reconstruction analysis uncovers a significant increase in docked and reserve pools of synaptic vesicles at hippocampal synapses in Bin1 cKO mice. Our results demonstrate a non-redundant role for BIN1 in presynaptic regulation, thus providing significant insights into the fundamental function of BIN1 in synaptic physiology relevant to Alzheimer disease.

Abstract: Summary
High levels of cancer aneuploidy are frequently associated with poor prognosis. To examine the relationship between aneuploidy and cancer progression, we analyzed a series of congenic cell lines that harbor single extra chromosomes. We found that across 13 different trisomic cell lines, 12 trisomies suppressed invasiveness or were largely neutral, while a single trisomy increased metastatic behavior by triggering a partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In contrast, we discovered that chromosomal instability activates cGAS/STING signaling but strongly suppresses invasiveness. By analyzing patient copy-number data, we demonstrate that specific aneuploidies are associated with distinct outcomes, and the acquisition of certain aneuploidies is in fact linked with a favorable prognosis. Thus, aneuploidy is not a uniform driver of malignancy, and different aneuploidies can uniquely influence tumor progression. At the same time, the gain of a single chromosome is capable of inducing a profound cell state transition, thereby linking genomic plasticity, phenotypic plasticity, and metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
FUS is a nuclear RNA-binding protein, and its cytoplasmic aggregation is a pathogenic signature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). It remains unknown how the FUS-RNA interactions contribute to phase separation and whether its phase behavior is affected by ALS-linked mutations. Here we demonstrate that wild-type FUS binds single-stranded RNA stoichiometrically in a length-dependent manner and that multimers induce highly dynamic interactions with RNA, giving rise to small and fluid condensates. In contrast, mutations in arginine display a severely altered conformation, static binding to RNA, and formation of large condensates, signifying the role of arginine in driving proper RNA interaction. Glycine mutations undergo rapid loss of fluidity, emphasizing the role of glycine in promoting fluidity. Strikingly, the nuclear import receptor Karyopherin-β2 reverses the mutant defects and recovers the wild-type FUS behavior. We reveal two distinct mechanisms underpinning potentially disparate pathogenic pathways of ALS-linked FUS mutants.

Abstract: Summary
Reward-processing impairment is a common symptomatic dimension of several psychiatric disorders. However, whether the underlying pathological mechanisms are common is unknown. Herein, we asked if the decrease in the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) lipid species, consistently described in these pathologies, could underlie reward-processing deficits. We show that reduced n-3 PUFA biostatus in mice leads to selective motivational impairments. Electrophysiological recordings revealed increased collateral inhibition of dopamine D2 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D2-MSNs) onto dopamine D1 receptor-expressing MSNs in the nucleus accumbens, a main brain region for the modulation of motivation. Strikingly, transgenically preventing n-3 PUFA deficiency selectively in D2-expressing neurons normalizes MSN collateral inhibition and enhances motivation. These results constitute the first demonstration of a causal link between a behavioral deficit and n-3 PUFA decrease in a discrete neuronal population and suggest that lower n-3 PUFA biostatus in psychopathologies could participate in the etiology of reward-related symptoms.

Abstract: Summary
Although typically upregulated upon cellular stress, autophagy can also be utilized under homeostatic conditions as a quality control mechanism or in response to developmental cues. Here, we report that autophagy is required for the maintenance of somatic cyst stem cells (CySCs) in the Drosophila testis. Disruption of autophagy in CySCs and early cyst cells (CCs) by the depletion of autophagy-related (Atg) genes reduced early CC numbers and affected CC function, resembling decreased epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. Indeed, our data indicate that EGFR acts to stimulate autophagy to preserve early CC function, whereas target of rapamycin (TOR) negatively regulates autophagy in the differentiating CCs. Finally, we show that the EGFR-mediated stimulation of autophagy regulates lipid levels in CySCs and CCs. These results demonstrate a key role for autophagy in regulating somatic stem cell behavior and tissue homeostasis by integrating cues from both the EGFR and TOR signaling pathways to control lipid metabolism.

Role of Orai1 and L-type CaV1.2 channels in Endothelin-1 mediated coronary contraction under ischemia and reperfusion,

Abstract: Ischemia and Reperfusion (I/R) injuries are associated with coronary artery hypercontracture. They are mainly originated by an exacerbated response to agonists released by endothelium such as Endothelin (ET-1), involving the alteration in intracellular calcium handling. Recent evidences have highlighted the implication of Store-Operated Calcium Channels (SOCC) in intracellular calcium homeostasis in coronary artery. However, little is known about the role of SOCC in the regulation of coronary vascular tone under I/R. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of SOCC and l-type Ca2+ channels (LTCC) in coronary artery vasoconstriction originated by ET-1 in I/R. We used Left Anterior Descendent coronary artery (LAD) rings, isolated from Wistar rats, to study the contractility and intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) under a simulated I/R protocol. We observed that responses to high-KCL induced depolarization and caffeine-induced Ca2+ release are attenuated in coronary artery under I/R. Furthermore, ET-1 addition in ischemia promotes transient and small rise of [Ca2+]i and coronary vascular tone. Meanwhile, these effects are significantly potentiated during reperfusion. The resulting ET-1-induced vasoconstrictions and [Ca2+]i increase were abolished by; GSK-7975A and gadolinium, inhibitors of SOCC; and nifedipine a widely used inhibitor of LTCC. Interestingly, using in situ Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA) in isolated coronary smooth muscle cells we found significant colocalization of LTCC CaV1.2 isoform with Orai1, the pore forming subunit of SOCC, and TRPC1 under I/R. Our data suggest that hypercontraction of coronary artery induced by ET-1 after I/R involves the co-activation of LTCC and SOCC, which colocalize significantly in the sarcolemma of coronary smooth muscle cells.

Abstract: During myogenesis, a long splice variant of STIM1, called STIM1L is getting expressed, while the level of STIM1 remains constant. Previous work demonstrated that STIM1L is more efficient in eliciting store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), but no current analysis of the channel(s) activated by this new STIM1L isoform was performed until now. In this study, we investigate the ionic channel(s) activated by STIM1L and whether differences exist between the two STIM1 isoforms, using HEK-293 T cells as a model system. Our data show that STIM1 and STIM1L activate Orai1 channel but also the endogenously expressed TRPC1. The channel activation occurs in two steps, with first Orai1 activation followed, in a subset of cells, by TRPC1 opening. Remarkably, STIM1L more frequently activates TRPC1 and preferentially interacts with TRPC1. In low intracellular Ca2+ buffering condition, the frequency of TRPC1 opening increases significantly, strongly suggesting a Ca2+-dependent channel activation. The ability of STIM1L to open Orai1 appears decreased compared to STIM1, which might be explained by its stronger propensity towards TRPC1. Indeed, increasing the amount of STIM1L results in an enhanced Orai1 current. The role of endogenous TRPC1 in STIM1- and STIM1L-induced SOCE was confirmed by Ca2+ imaging experiments. Overall, our findings provide a detailed analysis of the channels activated by both STIM1 isoforms, revealing that STIM1L is more prone to open TRPC1, which might explain the larger SOCE elicited by this isoform.

Abstract: Summary
The Polycomb repressive system is an essential chromatin-based regulator of gene expression. Despite being extensively studied, how the Polycomb system selects its target genes is poorly understood, and whether its histone-modifying activities are required for transcriptional repression remains controversial. Here, we directly test the requirement for PRC1 catalytic activity in Polycomb system function. To achieve this, we develop a conditional mutation system in embryonic stem cells that completely removes PRC1 catalytic activity. Using this system, we demonstrate that catalysis by PRC1 drives Polycomb chromatin domain formation and long-range chromatin interactions. Furthermore, we show that variant PRC1 complexes with DNA-binding activities occupy target sites independently of PRC1 catalytic activity, providing a putative mechanism for Polycomb target site selection. Finally, we discover that Polycomb-mediated gene repression requires PRC1 catalytic activity. Together these discoveries provide compelling evidence that PRC1 catalysis is central to Polycomb system function and gene regulation.

Abstract: Summary
The antigen-presenting molecule MR1 presents microbial metabolites related to vitamin B2 biosynthesis to mucosal-associated invariant T cells (MAIT cells). Although bacteria and fungi drive the MR1 biosynthesis pathway, viruses have not previously been implicated in MR1 expression or its antigen presentation. We demonstrate that several herpesviruses inhibit MR1 cell surface upregulation, including a potent inhibition by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). This virus profoundly suppresses MR1 cell surface expression and targets the molecule for proteasomal degradation, whereas ligand-induced cell surface expression of MR1 prior to infection enables MR1 to escape HSV-1-dependent targeting. HSV-1 downregulation of MR1 is dependent on de novo viral gene expression, and we identify the Us3 viral gene product as functioning to target MR1. Furthermore, HSV-1 downregulation of MR1 disrupts MAIT T cell receptor (TCR) activation. Accordingly, virus-mediated targeting of MR1 defines an immunomodulatory strategy that functionally disrupts the MR1-MAIT TCR axis.

Abstract: Summary
Efficient and homogeneous in vitro generation of peripheral sensory neurons may provide a framework for novel drug screening platforms and disease models of touch and pain. We discover that, by overexpressing NGN2 and BRN3A, human pluripotent stem cells can be transcriptionally programmed to differentiate into a surprisingly uniform culture of cold- and mechano-sensing neurons. Although such a neuronal subtype is not found in mice, we identify molecular evidence for its existence in human sensory ganglia. Combining NGN2 and BRN3A programming with neural crest patterning, we produce two additional populations of sensory neurons, including a specialized touch receptor neuron subtype. Finally, we apply this system to model a rare inherited sensory disorder of touch and proprioception caused by inactivating mutations in PIEZO2. Together, these findings establish an approach to specify distinct sensory neuron subtypes in vitro, underscoring the utility of stem cell technology to capture human-specific features of physiology and disease.

Abstract: Summary
Pain sensation and aversive behaviors entail the activation of nociceptor neurons, whose function is largely conserved across animals. The functional heterogeneity of nociceptors and ethical concerns are challenges for their study in mammalian models. Here, we investigate the function of a single type of genetically identified C. elegans thermonociceptor named FLP. Using calcium imaging in vivo, we demonstrate that FLP encodes thermal information in a tonic and graded manner over a wide thermal range spanning from noxious cold to noxious heat (8°C–36°C). This tonic-signaling mode allows FLP to trigger sustained behavioral changes necessary for escape behavior. Furthermore, we identify specific transient receptor potential, voltage-gated calcium, and sodium “leak” channels controlling sensory gain, thermal sensitivity, and signal kinetics, respectively, and show that the ryanodine receptor is required for long-lasting activation. Our work elucidates the task distribution among specific ion channels to achieve remarkable sensory properties in a tonic thermonociceptor in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Neuronal Ca2+ entry elicited by electrical activity contributes to information coding via activation of K+ and Cl− channels. While Ca2+-dependent K+ channels have been extensively studied, the molecular identity and role of Ca2+-activated Cl− channels (CaCCs) remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that TMEM16F governs a Ca2+-activated Cl− conductance in spinal motoneurons. We show that TMEM16F is expressed in synaptic clusters facing pre-synaptic cholinergic C-boutons in α-motoneurons of the spinal cord. Mice with targeted exon deletion in Tmem16f display decreased motor performance under high-demanding tasks attributable to an increase in the recruitment threshold of fast α-motoneurons. Remarkably, loss of TMEM16F function in a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) significantly reduces expression of an activity-dependent early stress marker and muscle denervation, delays disease onset, and preserves muscular strength only in male ALS mice. Thus, TMEM16F controls motoneuron excitability and impacts motor resistance as well as motor deterioration in ALS.

Abstract: Summary
Recent reports have shown the critical role of the mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein in virus-induced apoptosis, but the involvement of MAVS in tumorigenesis is still poorly understood. Herein, we report that MAVS is a key regulator of p53 activation and is critical for protecting against tumorigenesis. We find that MAVS promotes p53-dependent cell death in response to DNA damage. MAVS interacts with p53 and mediates p53 mitochondrial recruitment under genotoxic stress. Mechanistically, MAVS inhibits p53 ubiquitination by blocking the formation of the p53-murine double-minute 2 (MDM2) complex, leading to the stabilization of p53. Notably, compared with their wild-type littermates, MAVS knockout mice display decreased resistance to azoxymethane (AOM) or AOM/dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS)-induced colon cancer. MAVS expression is significantly downregulated in human colon cancer tissues. These results unveil roles for MAVS in DNA damage response and tumor suppression.

Abstract: Summary
UCP1-dependent thermogenesis is studied to define new strategies to ameliorate obesity and type 2 diabetes; however, animal models are mostly limited to germline mutations of UCP1, which can effect adaptive changes in UCP1-independent pathways. We develop an inducible mouse model for the sequential ablation of UCP1+ brown and brite/beige adipocytes in adult mice. We demonstrate that activated brown adipocytes can increase systemic energy expenditure (EE) by 30%, while the contribution of brite/beige UCP1+ cells is <5%. Notably, UCP1+ adipocytes do not contribute to circulating FGF21 levels, either at room temperature or after cold exposure. We demonstrate that the FGF21-mediated effects on EE and glucose homeostasis are partially dependent on the presence of UCP1+ cells, while the effect on weight loss is not. In conclusion, acute UCP1+ cell deletion may be a useful model to study the impact of brown and brite/beige adipocytes on metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
The transcriptional corepressor complex CoREST is one of seven histone deacetylase complexes that regulate the genome through controlling chromatin acetylation. The CoREST complex is unique in containing both histone demethylase and deacetylase enzymes, LSD1 and HDAC1, held together by the RCOR1 scaffold protein. To date, it has been assumed that the enzymes function independently within the complex. Now, we report the assembly of the ternary complex. Using both structural and functional studies, we show that the activity of the two enzymes is closely coupled and that the complex can exist in at least two distinct states with different kinetics. Electron microscopy of the complex reveals a bi-lobed structure with LSD1 and HDAC1 enzymes at opposite ends of the complex. The structure of CoREST in complex with a nucleosome reveals a mode of chromatin engagement that contrasts with previous models.

Abstract: The diagnosis of cervical dysplasia, carcinoma in situ and confirmed carcinoma cases is more easily perceived by commercially available and current research-based decision support systems when the scenario of pathologists to patient ratio is small. The treatment modalities for such diagnosis rely exclusively on precise identification of dysplasia stages as followed by The Bethesda System. The classification based on The Bethesda System is a multiclass problem, which is highly relevant and vital. Reliance on image interpretation, when done manually, introduces inter-observer variability and makes the microscope observation tedious and time-consuming. Taking this into account, a computer-assisted screening system built on deep learning can significantly assist pathologists to screen with correct predictions at a faster rate. The current study explores six different deep convolutional neural networks- Alexnet, Vggnet (vgg-16 and vgg-19), Resnet (resnet-50 and resnet-101) and Googlenet architectures for multi-class (four-class) diagnosis of cervical pre-cancerous as well as cancer lesions and incorporates their relative assessment. The study highlights the addition of an ensemble classifier with three of the best deep learning models for yielding a high accuracy multi-class classification. All six deep models including ensemble classifier were trained and validated on a hospital-based pap smear dataset collected through both conventional and liquid-based cytology methods along with the benchmark Herlev dataset.

Abstract: Summary
The plasma membrane (PM) forms extensive close junctions with the cortical endoplasmic reticulum (cER) in many cell types, ranging from yeast to mammals. How cells modulate structural plasticity of ER-PM contacts to accommodate space-demanding cortical events is largely unknown. Here, we report a role for eisosome-driven PM furrows in regulating ER-PM contact plasticity in fission yeast. We demonstrate that eisosome-coated PM invaginations function to stabilize local ER-PM contacts and attenuate cER remodeling dynamics through electrostatic Scs2-Pil1 interactions. We also identify divergent roles of ER-shaping proteins in controlling cER remodeling capacity and ER-PM contact plasticity. Furthermore, we show that eisosome organization is responsive to PM tension variations during active PM remodeling, which may enable adaptive control of ER-PM contact plasticity to potentially coordinate with space-demanding PM events. We thus propose a cellular strategy of modulating membrane contact plasticity by deploying sensory elements at contact sites.

Abstract: Summary
Aberrant hyperphosphorylation of the protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit (PP2Ac) at Tyr307 has been associated with aggressive disease and poor clinical outcome in multiple cancers. However, the study of reversible phosphorylation at this site has relied entirely upon the use of antibodies—most prominently, the clone E155. Here, we provide evidence that the E155 and F-8 phospho-Tyr307 antibodies cannot differentiate between phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of PP2Ac. The form of PP2Ac bound by these antibodies in H358 cells is unphosphorylated at the C-terminal tail. Furthermore, these antibodies are sensitive to additional protein modifications that occur near Tyr307, including Thr304 phosphorylation and Leu309 methylation, when these post-translational modifications are present. Thus, studies that used these antibodies to report PP2Ac hyperphosphorylation require reinterpretation, as these antibodies cannot be reliably used as readouts for a single PP2Ac post-translational modification (PTM) change.

Abstract: Oxaliplatin is a widely used chemotherapeutic drug and represents the cornerstone of colorectal cancer therapy, in combination with 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid. As with many chemotherapeutic agents, its use is associated with a number of side effects, ranging from hypersensitivity reactions to haematological dyscrasias. Oxaliplatin also induces acute and chronic peripheral neuropathy. While it is likely that the haematological side effects are associated with its anti-proliferative effects and with the ability to form DNA adducts, the molecular mechanisms underlying peripheral neuropathy and hypersensitivity reactions are poorly understood, and therefore the choice of adequate supportive therapies is largely empirical. Here we show that an acute low dose oxaliplatin application on DRG neurons is able to induce an increase in intracellular calcium that is dependent on the Histamine 1 receptor (H1). Oxaliplatin-induced intracellular calcium rises are blocked by two selective H1 antagonist, as well as by U73122, a PLC inhibitor, and by 2-APB, a non-specific IP3 receptor blocker. Moreover, expression of the H1 receptor on HEK293 t cells unmasks an oxaliplatin-induced Ca2+-rise. Last, activation of H1 via either histamine or oxaliplatin activates TRPV1 receptors, a mechanism that has been associated with itch. These data, together with literature data that has shown that anti-histamine agents reduce the incidence of oxaliplatin-induced hypersensitivity, may provide a molecular mechanism of this side effect in oncological patients.

Abstract: Summary
Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) is a central regulator of the cell cycle and gene transcription. However, little is known about its impact on genomic instability and cancer immunity. Using a selective CDK7 inhibitor, YKL-5-124, we demonstrated that CDK7 inhibition predominately disrupts cell-cycle progression and induces DNA replication stress and genome instability in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) while simultaneously triggering immune-response signaling. These tumor-intrinsic events provoke a robust immune surveillance program elicited by T cells, which is further enhanced by the addition of immune-checkpoint blockade. Combining YKL-5-124 with anti-PD-1 offers significant survival benefit in multiple highly aggressive murine models of SCLC, providing a rationale for new combination regimens consisting of CDK7 inhibitors and immunotherapies.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we show that tumor ADORA1 deletion suppresses cell growth in human melanoma cell lines in vitro and tumor development in vivo in immune-deficient xenografts. However, this deletion induces the upregulation of PD-L1 levels, which inactivates cocultured T cells in vitro, compromises anti-tumor immunity in vivo, and reduces anti-tumor efficacy in an immune-competent mouse model. Functionally, PD-1 mAb treatment enhances the efficacy of ADORA1-deficient or ADORA1 antagonist-treated melanoma and NSCLC immune-competent mouse models. Mechanistically, we identify ATF3 as the factor transcriptionally upregulating PD-L1 expression. Tumor ATF3 deletion improves the effect of ADORA1 antagonist treatment of melanoma and NSCLC xenografts. We observe higher ADORA1, lower ATF3, and lower PD-L1 expression levels in tumor tissues from nonresponders among PD-1 mAb-treated NSCLC patients.

Abstract: Summary
ATP-powered unfoldases containing D1 and D2 AAA+ rings play important roles in protein homeostasis, but uncertainty about the function of each ring remains. Here we use single-molecule optical tweezers to assay mechanical unfolding and translocation by a variant of the ClpAP protease containing an ATPase-inactive D1 ring. This variant displays substantial mechanical defects in both unfolding and translocation of protein substrates. Notably, when D1 is hydrolytically inactive, ClpAP often stalls for times as long as minutes, and the substrate can back-slip through the enzyme when ATP concentrations are low. The inactive D1 variant also has more difficulty traveling in the N-to-C direction on a polypeptide track than it does moving in a C-to-N direction. These results indicate that D1 normally functions as an auxiliary/regulatory motor to promote uninterrupted enzyme advancement that is fueled largely by the D2 ring.

Abstract: Summary
TMEM39A, encoding an ER-localized transmembrane protein, is a susceptibility locus for multiple autoimmune diseases. The molecular function of TMEM39A remains completely unknown. Here we demonstrated that TMEM39A, also called SUSR2, modulates autophagy activity by regulating the spatial distribution and levels of PtdIns(4)P. Depletion of SUSR2 elevates late endosomal/lysosomal PtdIns(4)P levels, facilitating recruitment of the HOPS complex to promote assembly of the SNARE complex for autophagosome maturation. SUSR2 knockdown also increases the degradative capability of lysosomes. Mechanistically, SUSR2 interacts with the ER-localized PtdIns(4)P phosphatase SAC1 and also the COPII SEC23/SEC24 subunits to promote the ER-to-Golgi transport of SAC1. Retention of SAC1 on the ER in SUSR2 knockdown cells increases the level of PtdIns(3)P produced by the VPS34 complex, promoting autophagosome formation. Our study reveals that TMEM39A/SUSR2 acts as an adaptor protein for efficient export of SAC1 from the ER and provides insights into the pathogenesis of diseases associated with TMEM39A mutations.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding how splicing events are coordinated across numerous introns in metazoan RNA transcripts requires quantitative analyses of transient RNA processing events in living cells. We developed nanopore analysis of co-transcriptional processing (nano-COP), in which nascent RNAs are directly sequenced through nanopores, exposing the dynamics and patterns of RNA splicing without biases introduced by amplification. Long nano-COP reads reveal that, in human and Drosophila cells, splicing occurs after RNA polymerase II transcribes several kilobases of pre-mRNA, suggesting that metazoan splicing transpires distally from the transcription machinery. Inhibition of the branch-site recognition complex SF3B rapidly diminished global co-transcriptional splicing. We found that splicing order does not strictly follow the order of transcription and is associated with cis-acting elements, alternative splicing, and RNA-binding factors. Further, neighboring introns in human cells tend to be spliced concurrently, implying that splicing of these introns occurs cooperatively. Thus, nano-COP unveils the organizational complexity of RNA processing.

The two deleted phenylalanines (RyR1-Δ4923FF4924) are located in the S6 pore-lining helix of RyR1. Clinical features in one of the two siblings included severe hypotonia, thin ribs, swallowing inability, and respiratory insufficiency that caused early death. Functional consequences of the RyR1-Δ4923FF4924 variant were determined using recombinant 2,200-kDa homotetrameric and heterotetrameric RyR1 channel complexes that were expressed in HEK293 cells and characterized by cellular, electrophysiological, and computational methods. Cellular Ca2+ release in response to caffeine indicated that the homotetrameric variant formed caffeine-sensitive Ca2+ conducting channels in HEK293 cells. In contrast, the homotetrameric channel complex was not activated by Ca2+ and did not conduct Ca2+ based on single-channel measurements. The computational analysis suggested decreased protein stability and loss of salt bridge interactions between RyR1-R4944 and RyR1-D4938, increasing the electrostatic interaction energy of Ca2+ in a region 20 Å from the mutant site. Co-expression of wild-type and mutant RyR1s resulted in Ca2+-dependent channel activities that displayed intermediate Ca2+ conductances and suggested maintenance of a reduced Ca2+ release in the two patients. Our findings reveal that the RYR1 pore variant p.(Phe4923_Phe4924del) attenuates the flow of Ca2+ through heterotetrameric channels, but alone was not sufficient to cause FADS, indicating additional genetic factors to be involved.

Abstract: Summary
Exposure to natural metabolites contributes to the risk of cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs). Through metabolome profiling, we identify the inverse correlation between serum concentrations of 4-cresol and type 2 diabetes. The chronic administration of non-toxic doses of 4-cresol in complementary preclinical models of CMD reduces adiposity, glucose intolerance, and liver triglycerides, enhances insulin secretion in vivo, stimulates islet density and size, and pancreatic β-cell proliferation, and increases vascularization, suggesting activated islet enlargement. In vivo insulin sensitivity is not affected by 4-cresol. The incubation of mouse isolated islets with 4-cresol results in enhanced insulin secretion, insulin content, and β-cell proliferation of a magnitude similar to that induced by GLP-1. In both CMD models and isolated islets, 4-cresol is associated with the downregulated expression of the kinase DYRK1A, which may mediate its biological effects. Our findings identify 4-cresol as an effective regulator of β-cell function, which opens up perspectives for therapeutic applications in syndromes of insulin deficiency.

Abstract: Summary
The rapid replenishment of release-ready synaptic vesicles (SVs) at a limiting number of presynaptic release sites is required to sustain high-frequency neurotransmission in CNS neurons. Failure to clear release sites from previously exocytosed material has been shown to impair vesicle replenishment and, therefore, fast neurotransmission. The identity of this material and the machinery that removes it from release sites have remained enigmatic. Here we show that the endocytic scaffold protein intersectin 1 clears release sites by direct SH3 domain-mediated association with a non-canonical proline-rich segment of synaptobrevin assembled into the SNARE complex for neuroexocytosis. Acute structure-based or sustained genetic interference with SNARE complex recognition by intersectin 1 causes a rapid stimulation frequency-dependent depression of neurotransmission due to impaired replenishment of release-ready SVs. These findings identify a key molecular mechanism that underlies exo-endocytic coupling during fast neurotransmitter release at central synapses.

Abstract: Summary
PGAM5 is a mitochondrial serine/threonine phosphatase that regulates multiple metabolic pathways and contributes to tumorigenesis in a poorly understood manner. We show here that PGAM5 inhibition attenuates lipid metabolism and colorectal tumorigenesis in mice. PGAM5-mediated dephosphorylation of malic enzyme 1 (ME1) at S336 allows increased ACAT1-mediated K337 acetylation, leading to ME1 dimerization and activation, both of which are reversed by NEK1 kinase-mediated S336 phosphorylation. SIRT6 deacetylase antagonizes ACAT1 function in a manner that involves mutually exclusive ME1 S336 phosphorylation and K337 acetylation. ME1 also promotes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) production, lipogenesis, and colorectal cancers in which ME1 transcripts are upregulated and ME1 protein is hypophosphorylated at S336 and hyperacetylated at K337. PGAM5 and ME1 upregulation occur via direct transcriptional activation mediated by β-catenin/TCF1. Thus, the balance between PGAM5-mediated dephosphorylation of ME1 S336 and ACAT1-mediated acetylation of K337 strongly influences NADPH generation, lipid metabolism, and the susceptibility to colorectal tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Previous reports showed that fibronectin (FN) was effective in stimulating the recovery of damaged dermis. However, native FN has multifunctional domains transmitting beneficial as well as unbeneficial signals to dermal tissue cells through the mediation of integrin heterodimers. The use of a functional domain [FN type III9-10 fragments (FNIII9-10)] providing beneficial effects on the physiology of dermal tissue cells would enhance an in vitro culture system for dermal fibroblasts (DFs). We therefore investigated the FNIII9-10-derived extracellular signaling effect on the physiology of DFs during in vitro culture. Recombinant FNIII9-10 proteins were constructed and their functionality was determined by observing the adhesion of adult human DFs (aHDFs) to recombinant FNIII9-10 and of low adhesion integrin α5β1- and αvβ3-blocked aHDFs to recombinant FNIII9-10. Cellular proliferation, morphology, and senescence were measured and compared in the aHDFs cultured on native FN and recombinant FNIII9-10 for short or long periods. The results show that recombinant FNIII9-10-derived extracellular signaling stimulated increased proliferation of aHDF (both in short- and long-term cultures) and inhibited the generation of morphological abnormalities (in short- and long-term cultures) and cellular senescence (long-term culture) when compared with native FN-derived extracellular signaling. Our results suggest that, instead of native FN, recombinant FNIII9-10 better enhanced the in vitro culture of aHDFs while diminishing the adverse effects associated with the use of human-derived materials.

Abstract: The purpose of this exploration was to detect the biological effects of miR-10b/FAM46C pair on osteosarcoma (OS) development. By accessing to the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, we achieved expressional profiles of miR-10b and FAM46C. Kaplan-Meier method was applied to determine the overall survival rates of OS patients. MiR-10b mimic/inhibitor were utilized to alter miR-10b expression. Overexpression of FAM46C was induced by pcDNA3.1-FAM46C. QRT-PCR and western blot were conducted to assess the expression levels. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and transwell assays were employed to evaluate the proliferative, invasive and migratory properties of OS cells. Pearson correlation analysis was performed to confirm the association between miR-10b and FAM46C. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was conducted to determine the target of miR-10b. The overall survival of OS patients was inversely correlated with miR-10b expression. MiR-10b was increased in OS compared with normal controls. Depletion of miR-10b attenuated the proliferation, invasion and migration of MG-63 cells. FAM46C was considered as a target gene of miR-10b and inversely related with miR-10b. Overexpression of FAM46C could inhibit cell growth, invasion and migration in OS; furthermore, it also can enforced the miR-10b inhibitor-induced effects on cell behaviors of OS cells. Down-regulation of miR-10b played a suppressive effect on the cell activity in OS cells, which provides a novel insight into the advance of OS therapeutic therapies.

Abstract: Ever since British Physician William Withering first described the use of foxglove extract for treatment of patients with congestive heart failure in 1785, cardiotonic steroids have been used clinically to treat heart failure and more recently atrial fibrillation. Due to their ability to bind and inhibit the ubiquitous transport enzyme sodium potassium pump, thus regulating intracellular Na+ concentration in every living cell, they are also an essential tool for research into the sodium potassium pump structure and function. Exogenous CTS have been clearly demonstrated to affect cardiovascular system through modulation of vagal tone, cardiac contraction (via ionic changes) and altered natriuresis. Reports of a number of endogenous CTS, since the 1980s, have intensified research into their physiologic and pathophysiologic roles and opened up novel therapeutic targets. Substantive evidence pointing to the role of endogenous ouabain and marinobufagenin, the two most prominent CTS, in development of cardiovascular disease has accumulated. Nevertheless, their presence, structure, biosynthesis pathways and even mechanism of action remain unclear or controversial. In this review the current state-of-the-art, the controversies and the remaining questions surrounding the role of endogenous cardiotonic steroids in health and disease are discussed.

Abstract: Summary
Commissural inhibitory neurons in the spinal cord of aquatic vertebrates coordinate left-right body alternation during swimming. Their developmental origin, however, has been elusive. We investigate this by comparing the anatomy and function of two commissural inhibitory neuron types, dI6dmrt3a and V0d, derived from the pd6 and p0 progenitor domains, respectively. We find that both of these commissural neuron types have monosynaptic, inhibitory connections to neuronal populations active during fictive swimming, supporting their role in providing inhibition to the contralateral side. V0d neurons tend to fire during faster and stronger movements, while dI6dmrt3a neurons tend to fire more consistently during normal fictive swimming. Ablation of dI6dmrt3a neurons leads to an impairment of left-right alternating activity through abnormal co-activation of ventral root neurons on both sides of the spinal cord. Our results suggest that dI6dmrt3a and V0d commissural inhibitory neurons synergistically provide inhibition to the opposite side across different swimming behaviors.

Abstract: Summary
Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 1p36 occurs in multiple cancers, including neuroblastoma (NBL). MYCN amplification and 1p36 deletions tightly correlate with markers of tumor aggressiveness in NBL. Although distal 1p36 losses associate with single-copy MYCN tumors, larger deletions correlate with MYCN amplification, indicating two tumor suppressor regions in 1p36, only one of which facilitates MYCN oncogenesis. To better define this region, we genome-edited the syntenic 1p36 locus in primary mouse neural crest cells (NCCs), a putative NBL cell of origin. In in vitro cell transformation assays, we show that Chd5 loss confers most of the MYCN-independent tumor suppressor effects of 1p36 LOH. In contrast, MYCN-driven tumorigenesis selects for NCCs with Arid1a deletions from a pool of NCCs with randomly sized 1p36 deletions, establishing Arid1a as the MYCN-associated tumor suppressor. Our findings reveal that Arid1a loss collaborates with oncogenic MYCN and better define the tumor suppressor functions of 1p36 LOH in NBL.

Abstract: Summary
Tumors that overexpress the MYC oncogene are frequently aneuploid, a state associated with highly aggressive cancers and tumor evolution. However, how MYC causes aneuploidy is not well understood. Here, we show that MYC overexpression induces mitotic spindle assembly defects and chromosomal instability (CIN) through effects on microtubule nucleation and organization. Attenuating MYC expression reverses mitotic defects, even in established tumor cell lines, indicating an ongoing role for MYC in CIN. MYC reprograms mitotic gene expression, and we identify TPX2 to be permissive for spindle assembly in MYC-high cells. TPX2 depletion blocks mitotic progression, induces cell death, and prevents tumor growth. Further elevating TPX2 expression reduces mitotic defects in MYC-high cells. MYC and TPX2 expression may be useful biomarkers to stratify patients for anti-mitotic therapies. Our studies implicate MYC as a regulator of mitosis and suggest that blocking MYC activity can attenuate the emergence of CIN and tumor evolution.

Abstract: Summary
Spatiotemporal gene regulation is often driven by RNA-binding proteins that harbor long intrinsically disordered regions in addition to folded RNA-binding domains. We report that the disordered region of the evolutionarily ancient developmental regulator Vts1/Smaug drives self-assembly into gel-like condensates. These proteinaceous particles are not composed of amyloid, yet they are infectious, allowing them to act as a protein-based epigenetic element: a prion [SMAUG+]. In contrast to many amyloid prions, condensation of Vts1 enhances its function in mRNA decay, and its self-assembly properties are conserved over large evolutionary distances. Yeast cells harboring [SMAUG+] downregulate a coherent network of mRNAs and exhibit improved growth under nutrient limitation. Vts1 condensates formed from purified protein can transform naive cells to acquire [SMAUG+]. Our data establish that non-amyloid self-assembly of RNA-binding proteins can drive a form of epigenetics beyond the chromosome, instilling adaptive gene expression programs that are heritable over long biological timescales.

Abstract: Summary
Histone deacetylases (HDACs) drive innate immune cell-mediated inflammation. Here we identify class IIa HDACs as key molecular links between Toll-like receptor (TLR)-inducible aerobic glycolysis and macrophage inflammatory responses. A proteomic screen identified the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase M isoform 2 (Pkm2) as a partner of proinflammatory Hdac7 in murine macrophages. Myeloid-specific Hdac7 overexpression in transgenic mice amplifies lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-inducible lactate and promotes a glycolysis-associated inflammatory signature. Conversely, pharmacological or genetic targeting of Hdac7 and other class IIa HDACs attenuates LPS-inducible glycolysis and accompanying inflammatory responses in macrophages. We show that an Hdac7-Pkm2 complex acts as an immunometabolism signaling hub, whereby Pkm2 deacetylation at lysine 433 licenses its proinflammatory functions. Disrupting this complex suppresses inflammatory responses in vitro and in vivo. Class IIa HDACs are thus pivotal intermediates connecting TLR-inducible glycolysis to inflammation via Pkm2.

Abstract: Summary
Saturated fatty acids (SFAs) (the “bad” fat), especially palmitate (PA), in the human diet are blamed for potential health risks such as obesity and cancer because of SFA-induced lipotoxicity. However, epidemiological results demonstrate a latent benefit of SFAs, and it remains elusive whether a certain low level of SFAs is physiologically essential for maintaining cell metabolic hemostasis. Here, we demonstrate that although high-level PA (HPA) indeed induces lipotoxic effects in liver cells, low-level PA (LPA) increases mitochondrial functions and alleviates the injuries induced by HPA or hepatoxic agent carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). LPA treatment in mice enhanced liver mitochondrial activity and reduced CCl4 hepatotoxicity with improved blood levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), and mitochondrial aspartate transaminase (m-AST). LPA-mediated mitochondrial homeostasis is regulated by CDK1-mediated SIRT3 phosphorylation, which in turn deacetylates and dimerizes CPT2 to enhance fatty acid oxidation. Thus, an advantageous effect is suggested by the consumption of LPA that augments mitochondrial metabolic homeostasis via CDK1-SIRT3-CPT2 cascade.

Abstract: Summary
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critical regulators of numerous physiological processes and diseases, especially cancers. However, development of lncRNA-based therapies is limited because the mechanisms of many lncRNAs are obscure, and interactions with functional partners, including proteins, remain uncharacterized. The lncRNA SLNCR1 binds to and regulates the androgen receptor (AR) to mediate melanoma invasion and proliferation in an androgen-independent manner. Here, we use biochemical analyses coupled with selective 2′-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) RNA structure probing to show that the N-terminal domain of AR binds a pyrimidine-rich motif in an unstructured region of SLNCR1. This motif is predictive of AR binding, as we identify an AR-binding motif in lncRNA HOXA11-AS-203. Oligonucleotides that bind either the AR N-terminal domain or the AR RNA motif block the SLNCR1-AR interaction and reduce SLNCR1-mediated melanoma invasion. Delivery of oligos that block SLNCR1-AR interaction thus represent a plausible therapeutic strategy.

Abstract: Summary
T cell surfaces are covered with microvilli, actin-rich and flexible protrusions. We use super-resolution microscopy to show that ≥90% of T cell receptor (TCR) complex molecules TCRαβ and TCRζ, as well as the co-receptor CD4 (cluster of differentiation 4) and the co-stimulatory molecule CD2, reside on microvilli of resting human T cells. Furthermore, TCR proximal signaling molecules involved in the initial stages of the immune response, including the protein tyrosine kinase Lck (lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase) and the key adaptor LAT (linker for activation of T cells), are also enriched on microvilli. Notably, phosphorylated proteins of the ERM (ezrin, radixin, and moesin) family colocalize with TCRαβ as well as with actin filaments, implying a role for one or more ERMs in linking the TCR complex to the actin cytoskeleton within microvilli. Our results establish microvilli as key signaling hubs, in which the TCR complex and its proximal signaling molecules and adaptors are preassembled prior to activation in an ERM-dependent manner, facilitating initial antigen sensing.

Abstract: Summary
To understand striatal function, it is essential to know the functional organization of the numerous inputs targeting the diverse population of striatal neurons. Using optogenetics, we activated terminals from ipsi- or contralateral primary somatosensory cortex (S1) or primary motor cortex (M1), or thalamus while obtaining simultaneous whole-cell recordings from pairs or triplets of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and adjacent interneurons. Ipsilateral corticostriatal projections provided stronger excitation to fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) than to MSNs and only sparse and weak excitation to low threshold-spiking interneurons (LTSIs) and cholinergic interneurons (ChINs). Projections from contralateral M1 evoked the strongest responses in LTSIs but none in ChINs, whereas thalamus provided the strongest excitation to ChINs but none to LTSIs. In addition, inputs varied in their glutamate receptor composition and their short-term plasticity. Our data revealed a highly selective organization of excitatory striatal afferents, which is determined by both pre- and postsynaptic neuronal identity.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture is more similar to in vivo studies and suitable for studies of interactions between cells and extracellular matrix. CD44 is a cell surface receptor that can relate with the extracellular matrix molecules. CD44 in gastric cancer (GC) is a metastatic and drug resistance marker. In this study the quantity of CD44+ cells in MKN-45 cell line in response to half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) dose of Docetaxel (DOC) was measured in 2D and 3D cultures. MKN-45 cell line was cultured in 2D and 3D environments. For 3D culture, rat gastric tissue was separated and decellularized and MKN-45 cells were injected and cultured in the prepared matrix. The frequency of CD44+ cells in 2D and 3D cultures were analyzed before and after treatment with IC50 of DOC by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Despite different environmental conditions, The frequency of CD44+ cells increased significantly in 2D and 3D environments after treatment with IC50 of DOC (P < 0.05). Given the advantages of 3D, this environment seems more appropriate for study about CD44+ cells and drug resistance in GC.

Abstract: Summary
This study sought to examine the functional significance of mitochondrial protein acetylation using a double knockout (DKO) mouse model harboring muscle-specific deficits in acetyl-CoA buffering and lysine deacetylation, due to genetic ablation of carnitine acetyltransferase and Sirtuin 3, respectively. DKO mice are highly susceptible to extreme hyperacetylation of the mitochondrial proteome and develop a more severe form of diet-induced insulin resistance than either single KO mouse line. However, the functional phenotype of hyperacetylated DKO mitochondria is largely normal. Of the >120 measures of respiratory function assayed, the most consistently observed traits of a markedly heightened acetyl-lysine landscape are enhanced oxygen flux in the context of fatty acid fuel and elevated rates of electron leak. In sum, the findings challenge the notion that lysine acetylation causes broad-ranging damage to mitochondrial quality and performance and raise the possibility that acetyl-lysine turnover, rather than acetyl-lysine stoichiometry, modulates redox balance and carbon flux.

Abstract: MARCH5 is a RING finger E3 ligase involved in mitochondrial integrity, cellular protein homeostasis, and the regulation of mitochondrial fusion and fission. To determine the function of MARCH5 during development, we assessed transcript expression in zebrafish embryos. We found that march5 transcripts were of maternal origin and evenly distributed at the 1-cell stage, except for the mid-blastula transition, with expression predominantly in the developing central nervous system at later stages of embryogenesis. Overexpression of march5 impaired convergent extension movement during gastrulation, resulting in reduced patterning along the dorsoventral axis and alterations in the ventral cell types. Overexpression and knockdown of march5 disrupted the organization of the developing telencephalon and diencephalon. Lastly, we found that the transcription of march5 was tightly regulated by the transcriptional regulators CHOP, C/EBPα, Staf, Znf143a, and Znf76. These results demonstrate the essential role of March5 in the development of zebrafish embryos.

Abstract: Structure-dynamic analysis of archaeal NCX (NCX_Mj) provided new insights into the underlying mechanisms of ion selectivity, ion-coupled alternating access, ion occlusion, and transport catalysis. This knowledge is relevant, not only for prokaryotic and eukaryotic NCXs, but also for other families belonging to the superfamily of Ca2+/CA antiporters. In parallel with the ion transport mechanisms, the structure-dynamic determinants of regulatory CBD1 and CBD2 domains have been resolved according to which the Ca2+-induced allosteric signal is decoded at the two-domain interface and "secondarily" modified by a splicing segment at CBD2. The exon-dependent combinations within the splicing segment control the number of Ca2+ binding sites (from zero to three) at CBD2, as well as the Ca2+ binding affinity and Ca2+ off-rates at both CBDs. The exon-dependent combinations specifically rigidify the local segments at CBDs, yielding the Ca2+-dependent activation (through Ca2+ binding to CBD1) and Ca2+-dependent alleviation of Na+-induced inactivation (through Ca2+ binding with CBD2). The exon-dependent synergistic interactions between CBDs characteristically differ in NCX1 and NCX3, thereby underscoring the physiological relevance of structure-controlled shaping of ion-dependent regulation in tissue-specific NCX variants. How the ion-dependent regulatory modules operate in conjunction with other regulators (PIP2, palmitoylation, XIP, among the others) of NCX is an open question that remains to be determined.

Abstract: Summary
Since nuclear envelope breakdown occurs during mitosis in metazoan cells, it has been proposed that macroautophagy must be inhibited to maintain genome integrity. However, repression of macroautophagy during mitosis remains controversial and mechanistic detail limited to the suggestion that CDK1 phosphorylates VPS34. Here, we show that initiation of macroautophagy, measured by the translocation of the ULK complex to autophagic puncta, is repressed during mitosis, even when mTORC1 is inhibited. Indeed, mTORC1 is inactive during mitosis, reflecting its failure to localize to lysosomes due to CDK1-dependent RAPTOR phosphorylation. While mTORC1 normally represses autophagy via phosphorylation of ULK1, ATG13, ATG14, and TFEB, we show that the mitotic phosphorylation of these autophagy regulators, including at known repressive sites, is dependent on CDK1 but independent of mTOR. Thus, CDK1 substitutes for inhibited mTORC1 as the master regulator of macroautophagy during mitosis, uncoupling autophagy regulation from nutrient status to ensure repression of macroautophagy during mitosis.

Abstract: Summary
Heterochromatin functions as a scaffold for factors responsible for gene silencing and chromosome segregation. Heterochromatin can be assembled by multiple pathways, including RNAi and RNA surveillance. We identified factors that form heterochromatin using dense profiles of transposable element integration in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The candidates include a large number of essential proteins such as four canonical mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation factors. We find that Iss1, a subunit of the poly(A) polymerase module, plays a role in forming heterochromatin in centromere repeats that is independent of RNAi. Genome-wide maps reveal that Iss1 accumulates at genes regulated by RNA surveillance. Iss1 interacts with RNA surveillance factors Mmi1 and Rrp6, and importantly, Iss1 contributes to RNA elimination that forms heterochromatin at meiosis genes. Our profile of transposable element integration supports the model that a network of mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation factors coordinates RNA surveillance, including the mechanism that forms heterochromatin at meiotic genes.

Abstract: Summary
Prion-like proteins form multivalent assemblies and phase separate into membraneless organelles. Heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein D-like (hnRNPDL) is a RNA-processing prion-like protein with three alternative splicing (AS) isoforms, which lack none, one, or both of its two disordered domains. It has been suggested that AS might regulate the assembly properties of RNA-processing proteins by controlling the incorporation of multivalent disordered regions in the isoforms. This, in turn, would modulate their activity in the downstream splicing program. Here, we demonstrate that AS controls the phase separation of hnRNPDL, as well as the size and dynamics of its nuclear complexes, its nucleus-cytoplasm shuttling, and amyloidogenicity. Mutation of the highly conserved D378 in the disordered C-terminal prion-like domain of hnRNPDL causes limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 1G. We show that D378H/N disease mutations impact hnRNPDL assembly properties, accelerating aggregation and dramatically reducing the protein solubility in the muscle of Drosophila, suggesting a genetic loss-of-function mechanism for this muscular disorder.

Abstract: Summary
PTPRD is a receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase that is genetically associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we asked whether Ptprd mutations cause aberrant neural development by perturbing neurogenesis in the murine cortex. We show that loss of Ptprd causes increases in neurogenic transit-amplifying intermediate progenitor cells and cortical neurons and perturbations in neuronal localization. These effects are intrinsic to neural precursor cells since acute Ptprd knockdown causes similar perturbations. PTPRD mediates these effects by dephosphorylating receptor tyrosine kinases, including TrkB and PDGFRβ, and loss of Ptprd causes the hyperactivation of TrkB and PDGFRβ and their downstream MEK-ERK signaling pathway in neural precursor cells. Moreover, inhibition of aberrant TrkB or MEK activation rescues the increased neurogenesis caused by knockdown or homozygous loss of Ptprd. These results suggest that PTPRD regulates receptor tyrosine kinases to ensure appropriate numbers of intermediate progenitor cells and neurons, suggesting a mechanism for its genetic association with neurodevelopmental disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play critical roles in metabolism and disease, yet a comprehensive analysis of the cellular response to oxidative stress is lacking. To systematically identify regulators of oxidative stress, we conducted genome-wide Cas9/CRISPR and shRNA screens. This revealed a detailed picture of diverse pathways that control oxidative stress response, ranging from the TCA cycle and DNA repair machineries to iron transport, trafficking, and metabolism. Paradoxically, disrupting the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) at the level of phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGD) protects cells against ROS. This dramatically alters metabolites in the PPP, consistent with rewiring of upper glycolysis to promote antioxidant production. In addition, disruption of peroxisomal import unexpectedly increases resistance to oxidative stress by altering the localization of catalase. Together, these studies provide insights into the roles of peroxisomal matrix import and the PPP in redox biology and represent a rich resource for understanding the cellular response to oxidative stress.

Abstract: Summary
Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and the three related peptides urocortins 1–3 (UCN1–UCN3) are endocrine hormones that control the stress responses by activating CRF1R and CRF2R, two members of class B G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Here, we present two cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of UCN1-bound CRF1R and CRF2R with the stimulatory G protein. In both structures, UCN1 adopts a single straight helix with its N terminus dipped into the receptor transmembrane bundle. Although the peptide-binding residues in CRF1R and CRF2R are different from other members of class B GPCRs, the residues involved in receptor activation and G protein coupling are conserved. In addition, both structures reveal bound cholesterol molecules to the receptor transmembrane helices. Our structures define the basis of ligand-binding specificity in the CRF receptor-hormone system, establish a common mechanism of class B GPCR activation and G protein coupling, and provide a paradigm for studying membrane protein-lipid interactions for class B GPCRs.

Abstract: Summary
Ants acquire distinct morphological and behavioral phenotypes arising from a common genome, underscoring the importance of epigenetic regulation. In Camponotus floridanus, “Major” workers defend the colony, but can be epigenetically reprogrammed to forage for food analogously to “Minor” workers. Here, we utilize reprogramming to investigate natural behavioral specification. Reprogramming of Majors upregulates Minor-biased genes and downregulates Major-biased genes, engaging molecular pathways fundamental to foraging behavior. We discover the neuronal corepressor for element-1-silencing transcription factor (CoREST) is upregulated upon reprogramming and required for the epigenetic switch to foraging. Genome-wide profiling during reprogramming reveals CoREST represses expression of enzymes that degrade juvenile hormone (JH), a hormone elevated upon reprogramming. High CoREST, low JH-degrader expression, and high JH levels are mirrored in natural Minors, revealing parallel mechanisms of natural and reprogrammed foraging. These results unveil chromatin regulation via CoREST as central to programming of ant social behavior, with potential far-reaching implications for behavioral epigenetics.

Abstract: Summary
Compacted heterochromatin blocks are prevalent in differentiated cells and present a barrier to cellular reprogramming. It remains obscure how heterochromatin remodeling is orchestrated during cell differentiation. Here we find that the evolutionarily conserved homeodomain transcription factor Prospero (Pros)/Prox1 ensures neuronal differentiation by driving heterochromatin domain condensation and expansion. Intriguingly, in mitotically dividing Drosophila neural precursors, Pros is retained at H3K9me3+ pericentromeric heterochromatin regions of chromosomes via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). During mitotic exit of neural precursors, mitotically retained Pros recruits and concentrates heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) into phase-separated condensates and drives heterochromatin compaction. This establishes a transcriptionally repressive chromatin environment that guarantees cell-cycle exit and terminal neuronal differentiation. Importantly, mammalian Prox1 employs a similar “mitotic-implantation-ensured heterochromatin condensation” strategy to reinforce neuronal differentiation. Together, our results unveiled a new paradigm whereby mitotic implantation of a transcription factor via LLPS remodels H3K9me3+ heterochromatin and drives timely and irreversible terminal differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
End-binding proteins (EBs) are widely viewed as master regulators of microtubule dynamics and function. Here, we show that while EB1 mediates the dynamic microtubule capture of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in fibroblasts, in neuronal cells, infection occurs independently of EBs through stable microtubules. Prompted by this, we find that transforming acid coiled-coil protein 3 (TACC3), widely studied in mitotic spindle formation, regulates the cytoplasmic localization of the microtubule polymerizing factor chTOG and influences microtubule plus-end dynamics during interphase to control infection in distinct cell types. Furthermore, perturbing TACC3 function in neuronal cells resulted in the formation of disorganized stable, detyrosinated microtubule networks and changes in cellular morphology, as well as impaired trafficking of both HSV-1 and transferrin. These trafficking defects in TACC3-depleted cells were reversed by the depletion of kinesin-1 heavy chains. As such, TACC3 is a critical regulator of interphase microtubule dynamics and stability that influences kinesin-1-based cargo trafficking.

Abstract: As a solute carrier electrogenic transporter, the sodium/calcium exchanger (NCX1-3/SLC8A1-A3) links the trans-plasmalemmal gradients of sodium and calcium ions (Na+, Ca2+) to the membrane potential of astrocytes. Classically, NCX is considered to serve the export of Ca2+ at the expense of the Na+ gradient, defined as a “forward mode” operation. Forward mode NCX activity contributes to Ca2+ extrusion and thus to the recovery from intracellular Ca2+ signals in astrocytes. The reversal potential of the NCX, owing to its transport stoichiometry of 3 Na+ to 1 Ca2+, is, however, close to the astrocytes’ membrane potential and hence even small elevations in the astrocytic Na+ concentration or minor depolarisations switch it into the “reverse mode” (Ca2+ import/Na+ export). Notably, transient Na+ elevations in the millimolar range are induced by uptake of glutamate or GABA into astrocytes and/or by the opening of Na+-permeable ion channels in response to neuronal activity. Activity-related Na+ transients result in NCX reversal, which mediates Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space, thereby generating astrocyte Ca2+ signalling independent from InsP3-mediated release from intracellular stores. Under pathological conditions, reverse NCX promotes cytosolic Ca2+ overload, while dampening Na+ elevations of astrocytes. This review provides an overview on our current knowledge about this fascinating transporter and its special functional role in astrocytes. We shall delineate that Na+-driven, reverse NCX-mediated astrocyte Ca2+ signals are involved neurone-glia interaction. Na+ transients, translated by the NCX into Ca2+ elevations, thereby emerge as a new signalling pathway in astrocytes.

Abstract: Summary
The inflammatory functions of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) rely on its ability to induce cytokine production and to induce cell death. Caspase-dependent and caspase-independent pathways—apoptosis and necroptosis, respectively—regulate immunogenicity by the release of distinct sets of cellular proteins. To obtain an unbiased, systems-level understanding of this important process, we here applied mass spectrometry-based proteomics to dissect protein release during apoptosis and necroptosis. We report hundreds of proteins released from human myeloid cells in time course experiments. Both cell death types induce receptor shedding, but only apoptotic cells released nucleosome components. Conversely, necroptotic cells release lysosomal components by activating lysosomal exocytosis at early stages of necroptosis-induced membrane permeabilization and show reduced release of conventionally secreted cytokines.

Abstract: Summary
Rewiring of metabolic pathways is a hallmark of tumorigenesis as cancer cells acquire novel nutrient dependencies to support oncogenic growth. A major genetic subtype of lung adenocarcinoma with KEAP1/NRF2 mutations, which activates the endogenous oxidative stress response, undergoes significant metabolic rewiring to support enhanced antioxidant production. We demonstrate that cancers with high antioxidant capacity exhibit a general dependency on exogenous non-essential amino acids (NEAAs) that is driven by the Nrf2-dependent secretion of glutamate through system xc− (XCT), which limits intracellular glutamate pools that are required for NEAA synthesis. This dependency can be therapeutically targeted by dietary restriction or enzymatic depletion of individual NEAAs. Importantly, limiting endogenous glutamate levels by glutaminase inhibition can sensitize tumors without alterations in the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway to dietary restriction of NEAAs. Our findings identify a metabolic strategy to therapeutically target cancers with genetic or pharmacologic activation of the Nrf2 antioxidant response pathway by restricting exogenous sources of NEAAs.

Abstract: Summary
Antibody memory protects humans from many diseases. Protective antibody memory responses require activation of transcriptional programs, cell proliferation, and production of antigen-specific antibodies, but how these aspects of the response are coordinated is poorly understood. We profile the molecular and cellular features of the antibody response to influenza vaccination by integrating single-cell transcriptomics, longitudinal antibody repertoire sequencing, and antibody binding measurements. Single-cell transcriptional profiling reveals a program of memory B cell activation characterized by CD11c and T-bet expression associated with clonal expansion and differentiation toward effector function. Vaccination elicits an antibody clone, which rapidly acquired broad high-affinity hemagglutinin binding during affinity maturation. Unexpectedly, many antibody clones elicited by vaccination do not bind vaccine, demonstrating non-specific activation of bystander antibodies by influenza vaccination. These results offer insight into how molecular recognition, transcriptional programs, and clonal proliferation are coordinated in the human B cell repertoire during memory recall.

Abstract: Summary
End-stage renal disease is a worldwide epidemic requiring renal replacement therapy. Harvesting tissue from failing kidneys and autotransplantation of tissue progenitors could theoretically delay the need for dialysis. Here we use healthy and end-stage human adult kidneys to robustly expand proliferative kidney epithelial cells and establish 3D kidney epithelial cultures termed “nephrospheres.” Formation of nephrospheres reestablishes renal identity and function in primary cultures. Transplantation into NOD/SCID mice shows that nephrospheres restore self-organogenetic properties lost in monolayer cultures, allowing long-term engraftment as tubular structures, potentially adding nephron segments and demonstrating self-organization as critical to survival. Furthermore, long-term tubular engraftment of nephrospheres is functionally beneficial in murine models of chronic kidney disease. Remarkably, nephrospheres inhibit pro-fibrotic collagen production in cultured fibroblasts via paracrine modulation, while transplanted nephrospheres induce transcriptional signatures of proliferation and release from quiescence, suggesting re-activation of endogenous repair. These data support the use of human nephrospheres for renal cell therapy.

Abstract: Summary
It is widely accepted that Beta-band oscillations play a role in sensorimotor behavior. To further explore this role, we developed a hybrid platform to combine neural operant conditioning and phase-specific intracortical microstimulation (ICMS). We trained monkeys, implanted with 96 electrode arrays in the motor cortex, to volitionally enhance local field potential (LFP) Beta-band (20–30 Hz) activity at selected sites using a brain-machine interface. We find that Beta oscillations of LFP and single-unit spiking activity increase dramatically with brain-machine interface training and that pre-movement Beta power is anti-correlated with task performance. We also find that phase-specific ICMS modulates the power and phase of oscillations, shifting local networks between oscillatory and non-oscillatory states. Furthermore, ICMS induces phase-dependent effects in animal reaction times and success rates. These findings contribute to unraveling the functional role of cortical oscillations and to the future development of clinical tools for ameliorating abnormal neuronal activities in brain disease.

Abstract: Summary
Many chaperones promote nascent polypeptide folding followed by substrate release through ATP-dependent conformational changes. Here we show cryoEM structures of Gα subunit folding intermediates in complex with full-length Ric-8A, a unique chaperone-client system in which substrate release is facilitated by guanine nucleotide binding to the client G protein. The structures of Ric-8A-Gαi and Ric-8A-Gαq complexes reveal that the chaperone employs its extended C-terminal region to cradle the Ras-like domain of Gα, positioning the Ras core in contact with the Ric-8A core while engaging its switch2 nucleotide binding region. The C-terminal α5 helix of Gα is held away from the Ras-like domain through Ric-8A core domain interactions, which critically depend on recognition of the Gα C terminus by the chaperone. The structures, complemented with biochemical and cellular chaperoning data, support a folding quality control mechanism that ensures proper formation of the C-terminal α5 helix before allowing GTP-gated release of Gα from Ric-8A.

Abstract: Summary
Metastasis is the primary cause of death of cancer patients. Dissecting mechanisms governing metastatic spread may uncover important tumor biology and/or yield promising therapeutic insights. Here, we investigated the role of circular RNAs (circRNA) in metastasis, using melanoma as a model aggressive tumor. We identified silencing of cerebellar degeneration-related 1 antisense (CDR1as), a regulator of miR-7, as a hallmark of melanoma progression. CDR1as depletion results from epigenetic silencing of LINC00632, its originating long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and promotes invasion in vitro and metastasis in vivo through a miR-7-independent, IGF2BP3-mediated mechanism. Moreover, CDR1as levels reflect cellular states associated with distinct therapeutic responses. Our study reveals functional, prognostic, and predictive roles for CDR1as and expose circRNAs as key players in metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Formation of self-associating loop domains is a fundamental organizational feature of metazoan genomes. Here, we employed quantitative live-imaging methods to visualize impacts of higher-order chromosome topology on enhancer-promoter communication in developing Drosophila embryos. Evidence is provided that distal enhancers effectively produce transcriptional bursting from target promoters over distances when they are flanked with boundary elements. Importantly, neither inversion nor deletion of a boundary element abrogates this “enhancer-assisting activity,” suggesting that they can facilitate intra-domain enhancer-promoter interaction and production of transcriptional bursting independently of topologically associating domain (TAD) formation. In contrast, domain-skipping activity of distal enhancers was lost after disruption of topological domains. This observation raises a possibility that intra-domain and inter-domain enhancer-promoter interactions are differentially regulated by chromosome topology.

Abstract: In this brief review we discuss some aspects of the Na+ pump and its roles in mediating the effects of ouabain and endogenous ouabain (EO): i) in regulating the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]CYT) via Na/Ca exchange (NCX), and ii) in activating a number of protein kinase (PK) signaling cascades that control a myriad of cell functions. Importantly, [Ca2+]CYT and the other signaling pathways intersect at numerous points because of the influence of Ca2+ and calmodulin in modulating some steps in those other pathways. While both mechanisms operate in virtually all cells and tissues, this article focuses primarily on their functions in the cardiovascular system, the central nervous system (CNS) and the kidneys.

Abstract: B-cell activating factor (BAFF) is a crucial survival factor for B cells, and excess BAFF contributes to development of autoimmune diseases. Recent studies have shown that rapamycin can prevent BAFF-induced B-cell proliferation and survival, but the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. Here we found that rapamycin inhibited human soluble BAFF (hsBAFF)-stimulated cell proliferation by inducing G1-cell cycle arrest, which was through downregulating the protein levels of CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, cyclin A, cyclin D1, and cyclin E. Rapamycin reduced hsBAFF-stimulated cell survival by downregulating the levels of anti-apoptotic proteins (Mcl-1, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and survivin) and meanwhile upregulating the levels of pro-apoptotic proteins (BAK and BAX). The cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of rapamycin linked to its attenuation of hsBAFF-elevated intracellular free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i). In addition, rapamycin blocked hsBAFF-stimulated B-cell proliferation and survival by preventing hsBAFF from inactivating PTEN and activating the Akt-Erk1/2 pathway. Overexpression of wild type PTEN or ectopic expression of dominant negative Akt potentiated rapamycin's suppression of hsBAFF-induced Erk1/2 activation and proliferation/viability in Raji cells. Interestingly, PP242 (mTORC1/2 inhibitor) or Akt inhibitor X, like rapamycin (mTORC1 inhibitor), reduced the basal or hsBAFF-induced [Ca2+]i elevations. Chelating [Ca2+]i with BAPTA/AM, preventing [Ca2+]i elevation using EGTA, 2-APB or verapamil, inhibiting CaMKII with KN93, or silencing CaMKII strengthened rapamycin's inhibitory effects. The results indicate that rapamycin inhibits BAFF-stimulated B-cell proliferation and survival by blunting mTORC1/2-mediated [Ca2+]i elevations and suppressing Ca2+-CaMKII-dependent PTEN/Akt-Erk1/2 signaling pathway. Our finding underscores that rapamycin may be exploited for prevention of excessive BAFF-induced aggressive B-cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a key redox intermediate generated within cells. Existing probes for H2O2 have not solved the problem of detection of the ultra-low concentrations of the oxidant: these reporters are not sensitive enough, or pH-dependent, or insufficiently bright, or not functional in mammalian cells, or have poor dynamic range. Here we present HyPer7, the first bright, pH-stable, ultrafast, and ultrasensitive ratiometric H2O2 probe. HyPer7 is fully functional in mammalian cells and in other higher eukaryotes. The probe consists of a circularly permuted GFP integrated into the ultrasensitive OxyR domain from Neisseria meningitidis. Using HyPer7, we were able to uncover the details of H2O2 diffusion from the mitochondrial matrix, to find a functional output of H2O2 gradients in polarized cells, and to prove the existence of H2O2 gradients in wounded tissue in vivo. Overall, HyPer7 is a probe of choice for real-time H2O2 imaging in various biological contexts.

Abstract: The synergy between synaptic Glu release and astrocytic Glu-Na+ symport is essential to the signalling function of the tripartite synapse. Here we used kinetic data of astrocytic Glu transporters (EAAT) and the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) to simulate Glu release, Glu uptake and subsequent Na+ and Ca2+ dynamics in the astrocytic leaflet microdomain following single release event. Model simulations show that Glu-Na+ symport differently affect intracellular [Na+] in synapses with different extent of astrocytic coverage. Surprisingly, NCX activity alone has been shown to generate markedly stable, spontaneous Ca2+ oscillation in the astrocytic leaflet. These on-going oscillations appear when NCX operates either in the forward or reverse direction. We conjecture that intrinsic NCX activity may play a prominent role in the generation of astrocytic Ca2+ oscillations.

Abstract: Summary
Inflammatory signaling pathways are tightly regulated to avoid chronic inflammation and the development of disease. OTULIN is a deubiquitinating enzyme that controls inflammation by cleaving linear ubiquitin chains generated by the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex. Here, we show that ablation of OTULIN in liver parenchymal cells in mice causes severe liver disease which is characterized by liver inflammation, hepatocyte apoptosis, and compensatory hepatocyte proliferation, leading to steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Genetic ablation of Fas-associated death domain (FADD) completely rescues and knockin expression of kinase inactive receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) significantly protects mice from developing liver disease, demonstrating that apoptosis of OTULIN-deficient hepatocytes triggers disease pathogenesis in this model. Finally, we demonstrate that type I interferons contribute to disease in hepatocyte-specific OTULIN-deficient mice. Our study reveals the critical importance of OTULIN in protecting hepatocytes from death, thereby preventing the development of chronic liver inflammation and HCC.

Abstract: Summary
Many eukaryotic cells distribute their intracellular components asymmetrically through regulated active transport driven by molecular motors along microtubule tracks. While intrinsic and extrinsic regulation of motor activity exists, what governs the overall distribution of activated motor-cargo complexes within cells remains unclear. Here, we utilize in vitro reconstitution of purified motor proteins and non-enzymatic microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) to demonstrate that MAPs exhibit distinct influences on the motility of the three main classes of transport motors: kinesin-1, kinesin-3, and cytoplasmic dynein. Further, we dissect how combinations of MAPs affect motors and unveil MAP9 as a positive modulator of kinesin-3 motility. From these data, we propose a general “MAP code” that has the capacity to strongly bias directed movement along microtubules and helps elucidate the intricate intracellular sorting observed in highly polarized cells such as neurons.

Abstract: Present study reports significant modifications in surface ultrastructure, histological organization, and histochemical localization of glycoproteins (GPs) in the gills of a hill stream catfish, Hara hara. Punctate microridges on free surface of epithelial cells covering gill arches, gill rakers, gill filaments and secondary lamellae are considered to provide adaptive plasticity to gills in relation to the environment inhabited by fish. Short and stout gill rakers are considered to prevent food particles to pass in opercular chamber along with respiratory current that could damage delicate gill filaments. Mucous goblet cells show presence of different classes of glycoproteins. GPs with oxidizable vicinal diols are considered to control acidity of acidic GPs. GPs with carboxyl groups have been implicated with defensive mechanism against microorganisms. GPs with O-sulphate esters are associated to trap and to lubricate food particles for easy swallowing. Taste buds on gill arches and gill rakers function to select palatable food particles. Occurrence of taste buds on the gill filaments is regarded significant adaptation to analyse the chemical nature of water. This study could play a significant role to understand adjustment of gills in the hill stream fish.

Abstract: Summary
Receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) and 3 (RIPK3) are well known for their capacity to drive necroptosis via mixed-lineage kinase-like domain (MLKL). Recently, RIPK1/3 kinase activity has been shown to drive inflammation via activation of MAPK signaling. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying this kinase-dependent cytokine production remain poorly understood. In the present study, we establish that the kinase activity of RIPK1/3 regulates cytokine translation in mouse and human macrophages. Furthermore, we show that this inflammatory response is downregulated by type I interferon (IFN) signaling, independent of type I IFN-promoted cell death. Specifically, low-level constitutive IFN signaling attenuates RIPK-driven activation of cap-dependent translation initiation pathway components AKT, mTORC1, 4E-BP and eIF4E, while promoting RIPK-dependent cell death. Altogether, these data characterize constitutive IFN signaling as a regulator of RIPK-dependent inflammation and establish cap-dependent translation as a crucial checkpoint in the regulation of cytokine production.

Abstract: Summary
Despite decades of studies suggesting that the in vivo adipocyte progenitor resides within the vascular niche, the exact nature of this progenitor remains controversial because distinct studies have attributed adipogenic properties to multiple vascular cell types. Using Cre recombinases labeling distinct vascular lineages, we conduct parallel lineage tracing experiments to assess their degree of contribution to de novo adipogenesis. Although we detect occasional adipocytes that were lineage traced by endothelial or mural recombinases, these are rare events. On the other hand, platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα)-expressing adventitial or capsular fibroblasts make a significant contribution to adipocytes in all depots and experimental settings tested. Our data also suggest that fibroblasts transition to an intermediate beige adipocyte phenotype prior to differentiating to a mature white adipocyte. These observations, together with histological analyses revealing that adipose tissue fibroblasts express the mural cell marker PDGFRβ, harmonize a highly controversial field with implications for multiple human diseases, including the pandemic of obesity.

Abstract: Summary
Repeat-mediated deletions (RMDs) often involve repetitive elements (e.g., short interspersed elements) with sequence divergence that is separated by several kilobase pairs (kbps). We have examined RMDs induced by DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) under varying conditions of repeat sequence divergence (identical versus 1% and 3% divergent) and DSB/repeat distance (16 bp–28.4 kbp). We find that the BLM helicase promotes RMDs with long DSB/repeat distances (e.g., 28.4 kbp), which is consistent with a role in extensive DSB end resection, because the resection nucleases EXO1 and DNA2 affect RMDs similarly to BLM. In contrast, BLM suppresses RMDs with sequence divergence and intermediate (e.g., 3.3 kbp) DSB/repeat distances, which supports a role in heteroduplex rejection. The role of BLM in heteroduplex rejection is not epistatic with MSH2 and is independent of the annealing factor RAD52. Accordingly, the role of BLM on RMDs is substantially affected by DSB/repeat distance and repeat sequence divergence.

Abstract: Summary
We study punctate adherens junctions (pAJs) to determine how short-lived cadherin clusters and relatively stable actin bundles interact despite differences in dynamics. We show that pAJ-linked bundles consist of two distinct regions—the bundle stalk (AJ-BS) and a tip (AJ-BT) positioned between cadherin clusters and the stalk. The tip differs from the stalk in a number of ways: it is devoid of the actin-bundling protein calponin, and exhibits a much faster F-actin turnover rate. While F-actin in the stalk displays centripetal movement, the F-actin in the tip is immobile. The F-actin turnover in both the tip and stalk is dependent on cadherin cluster stability, which in turn is regulated by F-actin. The close bidirectional coupling between the stability of cadherin and associated F-actin shows how pAJs, and perhaps other AJs, allow cells to sense and coordinate the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton in neighboring cells—a mechanism we term “dynasensing.”

Abstract: Summary
Degradation of transcripts in human nuclei is primarily facilitated by the RNA exosome. To obtain substrate specificity, the exosome is aided by adaptors; in the nucleoplasm, those adaptors are the nuclear exosome-targeting (NEXT) complex and the poly(A) (pA) exosome-targeting (PAXT) connection. How these adaptors guide exosome targeting remains enigmatic. Employing high-resolution 3′ end sequencing, we demonstrate that NEXT substrates arise from heterogenous and predominantly pA− 3′ ends often covering kilobase-wide genomic regions. In contrast, PAXT targets harbor well-defined pA+ 3′ ends defined by canonical pA site use. Irrespective of this clear division, NEXT and PAXT act redundantly in two ways: (1) regional redundancy, where the majority of exosome-targeted transcription units produce NEXT- and PAXT-sensitive RNA isoforms, and (2) isoform redundancy, where the PAXT connection ensures fail-safe decay of post-transcriptionally polyadenylated NEXT targets. In conjunction, this provides a two-layered targeting mechanism for efficient nuclear sorting of the human transcriptome.
