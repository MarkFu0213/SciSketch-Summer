Abstract: The organization of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) into dimers and higher-order oligomers has provided a potential mechanistic system in defining complex GPCR responses. Despite being studied for nearly 20years it has, and still is, been an area of controversy. Although technology has developed to quantitatively measure these associations in real time, identify the structural interfaces and even systems to understand the physiological significance of di/oligomerization, key questions remain outstanding including the role of each individual complex from the monomer to the higher-order oligomer, in their native system. Recently, single-molecule microscopy approaches have provided the tools to directly visualize individual GPCRs in dimers and oligomers, though as with any technological development each have their advantages and limitations. This chapter will describe these recent developments in single-molecule fluorescent microscopy, focusing on our recent application of super-resolution imaging of the GPCR for the luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin to quantify GPCR monomers and formation of protomers in to dimers and distinct oligomeric forms. We present our approach, considerations, strategy, and challenges to visualize this receptor beyond the light diffraction limit via photoactivated localization microscopy with photoactivatable dyes. The addition of super-resolution approaches to the GPCR “nano-tool kit” will pave the way for novel avenues to answer outstanding questions regarding the existence and significance of these complexes to GPCR signaling.

Abstract: Therapeutic strategies for the fatal neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) have not yet provided satisfactory results. Interest in stem cells for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases is increasing and their beneficial action seems to be due to a paracrine effect via the release of exosomes, main mediators of cell–cell communication. Here we wished to assess, in vitro, the efficacy of a novel non-cell therapeutic approach based on the use of exosomes derived from murine adipose-derived stromal cells on motoneuron-like NSC-34 cells expressing ALS mutations, and used as in vitro models of disease. In particular, we set out to investigate the effect of exosomes on NSC-34 naïve cells and NSC-34 cells overexpressing human SOD1(G93A) or SOD1(G37R) or SOD1(A4V) mutants, exposed to oxidative stress. The data presented here indicate for the first time that exosomes (0.2µg/ml) are able to protect NSC-34 cells from oxidative damage, which is one of the main mechanism of damage in ALS, increasing cell viability. These data highlight a promising role of exosomes derived from stem cells for potential therapeutic applications in motoneuron disease.

Abstract: Summary
The generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from differentiated cells following forced expression of OCT4, KLF4, SOX2, and C-MYC (OKSM) is slow and inefficient, suggesting that transcription factors have to overcome somatic barriers that resist cell fate change. Here, we performed an unbiased serial shRNA enrichment screen to identify potent repressors of somatic cell reprogramming into iPSCs. This effort uncovered the protein modifier SUMO2 as one of the strongest roadblocks to iPSC formation. Depletion of SUMO2 both enhances and accelerates reprogramming, yielding transgene-independent, chimera-competent iPSCs after as little as 38 hr of OKSM expression. We further show that the SUMO2 pathway acts independently of exogenous C-MYC expression and in parallel with small-molecule enhancers of reprogramming. Importantly, suppression of SUMO2 also promotes the generation of human iPSCs. Together, our results reveal sumoylation as a crucial post-transcriptional mechanism that resists the acquisition of pluripotency from fibroblasts using defined factors.

Abstract: The release of nucleic acids and derivatives after tissue-injury may affect cellular immune-response. We studied the impact of extracellular ribo-, desoxyribonucleotides and nucleosides on T-cell immunity. Peripheral-blood-mononuclear-cells (PBMCs) or isolated CD3+T-cells obtained from 6 healthy donors were stimulated via CD3/CD28 Dynabeads or dendritic cells (DCs) in the presence or absence of pyrimidine-, purine-nucleotides and -nucleosides (range 2–200µM). Addition of deoxy-, guanosine-triphosphate (dGTP, GTP) and guanosine resulted concentration dependent in a complete, adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) in a partial inhibition of the induced T-cell-proliferation. Deoxyadenosine-triphosphate (dATP), adenosine and the pyrimidine-ribo- and -deoxyribonucleotides displayed no inhibitory capacity. Inhibitory effects of dGTP and GTP, but not of guanosine and ATP were culture-media-dependent and could be almost abrogated by use of the serum-free lymphocyte-culture-media X-Vivo15 instead of RPMI1640 with standard-supplementation. In contrast to RPMI1640, X-Vivo15 resulted in a significant down-regulation of the cell-surface-located ectonucleotidases CD39 (Ecto-Apyrase) and CD73 (Ecto-5′-Nucleotidase), critical for the extracellular nucleotides-hydrolysis to nucleosides, explaining the loss of inhibition mediated by dGTP and GTP, but not Guanosine. In line with previous findings ATP was found to exert immunosuppressive effects on T-cell-proliferation. Purine-nucleotides, dGTP and GTP displayed a higher inhibitory capacity, but seem to be strictly dependent on the microenvironmental conditions modulating the responsiveness of the respective T-lymphocytes. Further evaluation of experimental and respective clinical settings should anticipate these findings.

Abstract: Summary
The use of cells derived from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) for regenerative therapies confers a considerable risk for neoplastic growth and teratoma formation. Preclinical and clinical assessment of such therapies will require suitable monitoring strategies to understand and mitigate these risks. Here we generated human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), selected clones that continued to express reprogramming factors after differentiation into cardiomyocytes, and transplanted these cardiomyocytes into immunocompromised rat hearts post-myocardial infarction. We compared magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cardiac ultrasound, and serum biomarkers for their ability to delineate teratoma formation and growth. MRI enabled the detection of teratomas with a volume >8 mm3. A combination of three plasma biomarkers (CEA, AFP, and HCG) was able to detect teratomas with a volume >17 mm3 and with a sensitivity of more than 87%. Based on our findings, a combination of serum biomarkers with MRI screening may offer the highest sensitivity for teratoma detection and tracking.

Abstract: Mammalian cells, when treated with sub-lethal doses of genotoxic stresses, slow down DNA synthesis but continue protein synthesis. Thus, these cells show an accumulation of proteins and undergo unbalanced growth. In the previous studies, we have shown that HeLa cells treated with excess thymidine or camptothecin undergo unbalanced growth, and prolonged unbalanced growth causes induction of cellular senescence, which is suppressed by restriction of protein synthesis or inhibition of ERK-signaling. In this study, we found that restriction of protein synthesis, inhibition of ERK-signaling, and elimination of reactive oxygen species showed a combinatorial effect on suppression of cellular senescence induced by excess thymidine or camptothecin. Of these, restriction of protein synthesis most effectively suppressed cellular senescence. Importantly, a similar combinatorial effect was observed in replicative senescence in normal human diploid fibroblasts. Our findings suggested that various stresses were cumulatively involved in cellular senescence, and suppression of cellular senescence was improved by combining the treatments that reduce the stresses.

Abstract: The use of biosensors either individually or as part of panels has now become a common technique to capturing signaling events in living cells. Such biosensors have become particularly important for probing biased signaling and allostery in G protein-coupled receptor drug screening efforts. However, assumptions about the portability of such biosensors between cell types may lead to misinterpretation of drug effects on specific signaling pathways in a given cellular context. Further, the output of a particular biosensor may be different depending on where it is localized in a cell. Here, we discuss strategies to mitigate these concerns which should feed into future biosensor design and usage.

Abstract: Summary
Neutrophils hinder bacterial growth by a variety of antimicrobial mechanisms, including the production of reactive oxygen species and the secretion of proteins that sequester nutrients essential to microbes. A major player in this process is calprotectin, a host protein that exerts antimicrobial activity by chelating zinc and manganese. Here we show that the intestinal pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium uses specialized metal transporters to evade calprotectin sequestration of manganese, allowing the bacteria to outcompete commensals and thrive in the inflamed gut. The pathogen’s ability to acquire manganese in turn promotes function of SodA and KatN, enzymes that use the metal as a cofactor to detoxify reactive oxygen species. This manganese-dependent SodA activity allows the bacteria to evade neutrophil killing mediated by calprotectin and reactive oxygen species. Thus, manganese acquisition enables S. Typhimurium to overcome host antimicrobial defenses and support its competitive growth in the intestine.

Abstract: The regulation of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation is an important issue due to its major implications for the prevention of pathological vascular conditions. The objective of this work was to assess the function of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)ylated Krϋppel-like transcription factor 4 (KLF4) in the regulation of VSMC proliferation in cultured cells and in animal models with balloon injury. We found that under basal conditions, binding of non-SUMOylated KLF4 to p300 activated p21 (p21WAF1/CIP1)transcription, leading to VSMC growth arrest. PDGF-BB promoted the interaction between Ubc9 and KLF4 and the SUMOylation of KLF4, which in turn recruited transcriptional corepressors to the p21 promoter. The reduction in p21 enhanced VSMC proliferation. Additionally, the SUMOylated KLF4 did not affect the expression of KLF4, thereby forming a positive feedback loop enhancing cell proliferation. These results demonstrated that SUMOylated KLF4 plays an important role in cell proliferation by reversing the transactivation action of KLF4 on p21 induced with PDGF-BB.

Abstract: Human dental follicle cells (DFCs) and periodontal ligament cells (PDLCs) derived from the ectomesenchymal tissue, have been shown to exhibit stem/progenitor cell properties and the ability to induce tissue regeneration. Stem cells in dental follicle differentiate into cementoblasts, periodontal ligament fibroblasts and osteoblasts, these cells form cementum, periodontal ligament and alveolar bone, respectively. While stem cells in dental follicle are a precursor to periodontal ligament fibroblasts, the molecular changes that distinguish cultured DFCs from PDLCs are still unknown. In this study, we have compared the immunophenotypic features and cell cycle status of the two cell lines. The results suggest that DFCs and PDLCs displayed similar features related to immunophenotype and cell cycle. Then we employed an isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) proteomics strategy to reveal the molecular differences between the two cell types. A total of 2138 proteins were identified and 39 of these proteins were consistently differentially expressed between DFCs and PDLCs. Gene ontology analyses revealed that the protein subsets expressed higher in PDLCs were related to actin binding, cytoskeletal protein binding, and structural constituent of muscle. Upon validation by real-time PCR, western blotting, and immunofluorescence staining. Tropomyosin 1 (TPM1) and caldesmon 1 (CALD1) were expressed higher in PDLCs than in DFCs. Our results suggested that PDLCs display enhanced actin cytoskeletal dynamics relative to DFCs while DFCs may exhibit a more robust antioxidant defense ability relative to PDLCs. This study expands our knowledge of the cultured DFCs and PDLCs proteome and provides new insights into possible mechanisms responsible for the different biological features observed in each cell type.

Abstract: Deregulation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is closely associated with the progression of various types of cancers, but its role in pancreatic carcinogenesis is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the role of TLR4 in the angiogenesis of pancreatic cancer and the underlying molecular mechanisms. The culture supernatant (conditioned medium) of PANC-1 cells after appropriate treatment was used for the treatment of HUVECs. The proliferation, migration and tube formation of HUVECs were assessed by MTT, Transwell and Matrigel, respectively. In pancreatic cancer tissues, TLR4, VEGF and CD31 were upregulated as determined by immunohistochemistry and the expression of TLR4 and VEGF was positively correlated with microvessel density as detected by CD31 staining. Activation of TLR4 signaling by LPS in PANC-1 cells resulted in increased VEGF and phosphorylation of AKT, which were abolished by TLR4 silencing with siRNA and PI3K/AKT signaling inhibitor LY294002. The conditioned medium from PANC-1 cells treated with LY294002 or transfected with TRL4 siRNA reduced the proliferation, migration and tube formation of HUVECs. In contrast, the conditioned medium from PANC-1 cells treated with LPS stimulated the proliferation, migration and tube formation of HUVECs, which was however significantly inhibited by pretreatment of PANC-1 cells with LY294002 or transfection with TRL4 siRNA. Our findings suggest TLR4 may promote angiogenesis in pancreatic cancer by activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to induce VEGF expression.

Abstract: Summary
Most serpins are fast and specific inhibitors of extracellular serine proteases controlling biological processes such as blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, tissue remodeling, and inflammation. The inhibitory activity of serpins is based on a conserved metastable structure and their conversion to a more stable state during reaction with the target protease. However, the metastable state also makes serpins vulnerable to mutations, resulting in disease caused by inactive and misfolded monomeric or polymeric forms (“serpinopathy”). Misfolding can occur either intracellularly (type-I serpinopathies) or extracellularly (type-II serpinopathies). We have isolated a 2′-fluoropyrimidine-modified RNA aptamer, which inhibits a mutation-induced inactivating misfolding of the serpin α1-antichymotrypsin. It is the first agent able to stabilize a type-II mutation of a serpin without interfering with the inhibitory mechanism, thereby presenting a solution for the long-standing challenge of preventing pathogenic misfolding without compromising the inhibitory function.

Abstract: In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, septin mutations have severe effects on colony-forming ability, particularly at high temperatures, allowing the full variety of genetic tools available in this model organism to be applied to the study of septin biology. Although many details of septin function remain unknown, one can exploit a small number of easily scored phenotypes—proliferation capacity, cell morphology, septin localization, and septin ring integrity—as sensitive readouts of properly assembled septin filaments. Accordingly, this chapter focuses on genetic approaches targeted toward understanding the molecular mechanisms of de novo septin folding, heterooligomerization, and polymerization into filaments. The same general methods can be used to interrogate septin function, although interpretation of results can be more complicated. As genetic-based methodologies are technically simple but particularly dependent on interpretation, here I focus on the logic underlying the most common interpretations of results using septin mutants.

Abstract: Mutations in microtubule subunits and microtubule-associated proteins are the causes of many neurological disorders. These human conditions are usually associated with axonal tract defects or degeneration. The molecular mechanisms of these axonal dysfunction are still largely unknown. Conventional methods may not yield a complete analysis of downstream molecules related to axonal dysfunctions. Therefore, we devised a simple unbiased method to screen molecular motors and axonal molecules, which might be involved in axonal defects. We performed our analysis in the mouse with a targeted deletion in the doublecortin (Dcx) gene. Dcx is a microtubule-associated protein with direct effects on microtubule motors. Furthermore, the knockout of Dcx and its functionally redundant structurally similar paralog, doublecortin-like kinase 1 (Dclk1), in mouse results in thinner or absent axon tracts, including the corpus callosum and anterior commissures. We compared protein profiles of corpus callosum from Dcx knockout and wild-type mouse of P0-P2 using mass spectrometry. This strategy allowed us to identify novel candidates downstream of Dcx involved in axon transport.

Abstract: Summary
The obligate intracellular lifestyle of apicomplexan parasites necessitates an invasive phase underpinned by timely and spatially controlled secretion of apical organelles termed micronemes. In Toxoplasma gondii, extracellular potassium levels and other stimuli trigger a signaling cascade culminating in phosphoinositide-phospholipase C (PLC) activation, which generates the second messengers diacylglycerol (DAG) and IP3 and ultimately results in microneme secretion. Here we show that a delicate balance between DAG and its downstream product, phosphatidic acid (PA), is essential for controlling microneme release. Governing this balance is the apicomplexan-specific DAG-kinase-1, which interconverts PA and DAG, and whose depletion impairs egress and causes parasite death. Additionally, we identify an acylated pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain-containing protein (APH) on the microneme surface that senses PA during microneme secretion and is necessary for microneme exocytosis. As APH is conserved in Apicomplexa, these findings highlight a potentially widely used mechanism in which key lipid mediators regulate microneme exocytosis.

Abstract: Summary
Type III secretion systems (T3SSs) inject bacterial effector proteins into host cells and underlie the virulence of many gram-negative pathogens. Studies have illuminated bacterial factors required for T3SS function, but the required host processes remain largely undefined. We coupled CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology with the cytotoxicity of two Vibrio parahaemolyticus T3SSs (T3SS1 and T3SS2) to identify human genome disruptions conferring resistance to T3SS-dependent cytotoxicity. We identity non-overlapping genes required for T3SS1- and T3SS2-mediated cytotoxicity. Genetic ablation of cell surface sulfation reduces bacterial adhesion and thereby alters the kinetics of T3SS1-mediated cytotoxicity. Cell surface fucosylation is required for T3SS2-dependent killing, and genetic inhibition of fucosylation prevents membrane insertion of the T3SS2 translocon complex. These findings reveal the importance of ubiquitous surface modifications for T3SS function, potentially explaining the broad tropism of V. parahaemolyticus, and highlight the utility of genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screens to discover processes underlying host-pathogen interactions.

Abstract: Understanding species’ responses to environmental challenges is key to predicting future biodiversity. However, there is currently little data on how developmental stages affect responses and also whether universal gene biomarkers to environmental stress can be identified both within and between species. Using the Antarctic clam, Laternula elliptica, as a model species, we examined both the tissue-specific and age-related (juvenile versus mature adult) gene expression response to acute non-lethal warming (12 h at 3 °C). In general, there was a relatively muted response to this sub-lethal thermal challenge when the expression profiles of treated animals, of either age, were compared with those of 0°C controls, with none of the “classical” stress response genes up-regulated. The expression profiles were very variable between the tissues of all animals, irrespective of age with no single transcript emerging as a universal biomarker of thermal stress. However, when the expression profiles of treated animals of the different age groups were directly compared, a very different pattern emerged. The profiles of the younger animals showed significant up-regulation of chaperone and antioxidant transcripts when compared with those of the older animals. Thus, the younger animals showed evidence of a more robust cellular response to warming. These data substantiate previous physiological analyses showing a more resilient juvenile population.

Abstract: Summary
Mycobacteria synthesize a variety of structurally related glycolipids with major biological functions. Common themes have emerged for the biosynthesis of these glycolipids, including several families of proteins. Genes encoding these proteins are usually clustered on bacterial chromosomal islets dedicated to the synthesis of one glycolipid family. Here, we investigated the function of a cluster of five genes widely distributed across non-tuberculous mycobacteria. Using defined mutant analysis and in-depth structural characterization of glycolipids from wild-type or mutant strains of Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium abscessus, we established that they are involved in the formation of trehalose polyphleates (TPP), a family of compounds originally described in Mycobacterium phlei. Comparative genomics and lipid analysis of strains distributed along the mycobacterial phylogenetic tree revealed that TPP is synthesized by a large number of non-tuberculous mycobacteria. This work unravels a novel glycolipid biosynthetic pathway in mycobacteria and extends the spectrum of bacteria that produce TPP.

Abstract: Regulation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-response pathway during the course of diabetes specifically in renal tubules is unclear. Since tubule cell dysfunction is critical to progression of diabetic nephropathy, this study analyzed markers of ER stress response and ER chaperones at different stages of diabetes and in different renal tubule subtypes of OVE26 type-1 diabetic mice. ER stress-response-induced chaperones GRP78, GRP94, and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) were increased in isolated cortical tubules of older diabetic mice, while PDI was decreased in tubules of young diabetic mice. Immunofluorescence staining of kidneys from older mice showed GRP78 and PDI upregulation in all cortical tubule segments, with substantial induction of PDI in distal tubules. Protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) phosphorylation was increased in cortical tubules of young diabetic mice, with no differences between older diabetic and control mice. Expression of ER stress-induced PERK inhibitor p58IPK was decreased and then increased in all tubule subtypes of young and older mice, respectively. Knockdown of PERK by small interfering RNA (siRNA) increased fibronectin secretion in cultured proximal tubule cells. Tubules of older diabetic mice had significantly more apoptotic cells, and ER stress-induced pro-apoptotic transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) was increased in proximal and distal tubules of diabetic mice and diabetic humans. CHOP induction in OVE26 mice was not altered by severity of proteinuria. Overexpression of CHOP in cultured proximal tubule cells increased expression of fibronectin. These findings demonstrate differential ER stress-response signaling in tubule subtypes of diabetic mice and implicate a role for PERK and CHOP in tubule cell matrix protein production.

Abstract: Summary
The Helicobacter pylori adhesin BabA binds mucosal ABO/Leb blood group (bg) carbohydrates. BabA facilitates bacterial attachment to gastric surfaces, increasing strain virulence and forming a recognized risk factor for peptic ulcers and gastric cancer. High sequence variation causes BabA functional diversity, but the underlying structural-molecular determinants are unknown. We generated X-ray structures of representative BabA isoforms that reveal a polymorphic, three-pronged Leb binding site. Two diversity loops, DL1 and DL2, provide adaptive control to binding affinity, notably ABO versus O bg preference. H. pylori strains can switch bg preference with single DL1 amino acid substitutions, and can coexpress functionally divergent BabA isoforms. The anchor point for receptor binding is the embrace of an ABO fucose residue by a disulfide-clasped loop, which is inactivated by reduction. Treatment with the redox-active pharmaceutic N-acetylcysteine lowers gastric mucosal neutrophil infiltration in H. pylori-infected Leb-expressing mice, providing perspectives on possible H. pylori eradication therapies.

Abstract: Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) has previously been linked to allergic inflammatory diseases, and tissue fibrosis and organ dysfunction may also arise from such inflammation. It remains unclear, however, whether TSLP plays any role in the occurrence of renal fibrosis, so this study investigated that possibility. An in vitro fibrosis model was established by treating normal rat kidney fibroblast (NRK-49F) cells with transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), after which the levels of various fibrogenic markers (e.g., fibronectin) and downstream fibrogenic signal proteins (e.g., smad 7) were investigated. Also, TSLP shRNA was used to silence the effects of TSLP, while an ELISA was conducted to evaluate the fibronectin secretions. The level of fibronectin in the NRK-49F cells was dose- and time-dependently increased by the administration of exogenous TSLP (P<0.05). TSLP also significantly increased the level of fibrosis signaling, in addition to inducing a marked decrease in the down-regulation of Smad7. Interestingly, the application of TSLP shRNA caused a stark reversal of the TGF-β1-induced cellular fibrosis while simultaneously leading to the suppression of fibronectin and fibrogenic signal proteins. Taken together, these observations provide insights into how extracellular matrices develop and could thus lead to potential therapeutic interventions for the suppression of renal fibrosis.

Abstract: Little is known about the functions of downstream regulatory element antagonist modulator (DREAM) in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). However, DREAM interacts with cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) in a Ca2+-dependent manner, preventing CREB binding protein (CBP) recruitment. Furthermore, CREB and CBP are involved in maintaining ESC self-renewal and pluripotency. However, a previous knockout study revealed the protective function of DREAM depletion in brain aging degeneration and that aging is accompanied by a progressive decline in stem cells (SCs) function. Interestingly, we found that DREAM is expressed in different cell types, including human ESCs (hESCs), human adipose-derived stromal cells (hASCs), human bone marrow-derived stromal cells (hBMSCs), and human newborn foreskin fibroblasts (hFFs), and that transitory inhibition of DREAM in hESCs reduces their pluripotency, increasing differentiation. We stipulate that these changes are partly mediated by increased CREB transcriptional activity. Overall, our data indicates that DREAM acts in the regulation of hESC pluripotency and could be a target to promote or prevent differentiation in embryonic cells.

Abstract: Evidence indicates that the growth of glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and malignant primary brain cancer, is driven by glioma stem cells (GSCs) resistant to current treatment. As Wnt-signaling is pivotal in stem cell maintenance, we wanted to explore its role in GSCs with the objective of finding distinct signaling mechanisms that could serve as potential therapeutic targets. We compared gene expression in GSCs (n=9) and neural stem cells from the adult human brain (ahNSC; n=3) to identify dysregulated genes in the Wnt signaling pathway. This identified a six-gene Wnt signature present in all nine primary GSC cultures, and the combined expression of three of these genes (SFRP1, SFRP4 and FZD7) reduced median survival of glioma patients from 38 to 17 months. Treatment with recombinant SFRP1 protein in primary cell cultures downregulated nuclear β-catenin and decreased in vitro proliferation and sphere formation in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, expressional and functional analysis of SFRP1-treated GSCs revealed that SFRP1 halts cell cycling and induces apoptosis. These observations demonstrate that Wnt signaling is dysregulated in GSC, and that inhibition of the Wnt pathway could serve as a therapeutic strategy in the treatment of GBM.

Abstract: Somatic cells could be directly converted into induced neural stem cells (iNSCs) by ectopic expression of defined transcription factors. However, the underlying mechanism of direct lineage transition into iNSCs is largely unknown. In this study, we examined the effect of genetic background on the direct conversion process into an iNSC state. The iNSCs from two different mouse strains exhibited the distinct efficiency of lineage conversion as well as clonal expansion. Furthermore, the expression levels of endogenous NSC markers, silencing of transgenes, and in vitro differentiation potential were also different between iNSC lines from different strains. Therefore, our data suggest that the genetic background of starting cells influences the conversion efficiency as well as reprogramming status of directly converted iNSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Fucose, a terminal sugar in glycoconjugates, critically regulates various physiological and pathological phenomena, including cancer development and inflammation. However, there are currently no probes for efficient labeling and detection of this sugar. We chemically synthesized a novel series of alkynyl-fucose analogs as probe candidates and found that 7-alkynyl-fucose gave the highest labeling efficiency and low cytotoxicity. Among the fucose analogs, 7-alkynyl-fucose was the best substrate against all five fucosyltransferases examined. We confirmed its conversion to the corresponding guanosine diphosphate derivative in cells and found that cellular glycoproteins were labeled much more efficiently with 7-alkynyl-fucose than with an existing probe. 7-Alkynyl-fucose was detected in the N-glycan core by mass spectrometry, and 7-alkynyl-fucose-modified proteins mostly disappeared in core-fucose-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts, suggesting that this analog mainly labeled core fucose in these cells. These results indicate that 7-alkynyl-fucose is a highly sensitive and powerful tool for basic glycobiology research and clinical application for biomarker discovery.

Abstract: The ability of cells to migrate and form metastases is one of the fatal hallmarks of cancer that can be conquered only with better understanding of the molecules and regulatory mechanisms involved. The oncogenic PIM kinases have been shown to support cancer cell survival and motility, but the PIM-regulated pathways stimulating cell migration and invasion are less well characterized than those affecting cell survival. Here we have identified the glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3B) and the forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) transcription factor as direct PIM targets, whose tumour-suppressive effects in prostate cancer cells are inhibited by PIM-induced phosphorylation, resulting in increased cell migration. Targeting GSK3B is also essential for the observed PIM-enhanced expression of the prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), which is an important regulator of both cell migration and adhesion. Accordingly, selective inhibition of PIM activity not only reduces cell migration, but also affects integrin-mediated cell adhesion. Taken together, these data provide novel mechanistic insights on how and why patients with metastatic prostate cancer may benefit from therapies targeting PIM kinases, and how such approaches may also be applicable to inflammatory conditions.

Abstract: Summary
RNA-modifying enzymes are difficult to assay due to the absence of fluorometric substrates. Here we show that the Broccoli, a previously reported fluorescent RNA-dye complex, can be modified to contain N6-methyladenosine, a prevalent mRNA base modification. Methylated Broccoli is nonfluorescent but, upon demethylation by the RNA demethylases fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) or ALKBH5, it binds and activates the fluorescence of its cognate fluorophore. We describe a high-throughput screen (HTS) for FTO inhibitors using the fluorogenic methylated Broccoli substrate HTS assay, which performs robustly with a Z′ factor >0.8 in the LOPAC1280 library. This allowed the identification of novel high-affinity FTO inhibitors. Several of these compounds were selective for FTO over the related demethylase, ALKBH5, and increase methylation of endogenous FTO target mRNAs in cells. Lastly, we show that Broccoli can be modified to contain other base modifications, suggesting that this approach could be generally applicable for assaying diverse RNA-modifying enzymes.

Abstract: Summary
Host genes that regulate systemic inflammation upon chronic viral infection are incompletely understood. Murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) infection is characterized by latency in macrophages, and reactivation is inhibited by interferon-γ (IFN-γ). Using a lysozyme-M-cre (LysMcre) expression system, we show that deletion of autophagy-related (Atg) genes Fip200, beclin 1, Atg14, Atg16l1, Atg7, Atg3, and Atg5, in the myeloid compartment, inhibited MHV68 reactivation in macrophages. Atg5 deficiency did not alter reactivation from B cells, and effects on reactivation from macrophages were not explained by alterations in productive viral replication or the establishment of latency. Rather, chronic MHV68 infection triggered increased systemic inflammation, increased T cell production of IFN-γ, and an IFN-γ-induced transcriptional signature in macrophages from Atg gene-deficient mice. The Atg5-related reactivation defect was partially reversed by neutralization of IFN-γ. Thus Atg genes in myeloid cells dampen virus-induced systemic inflammation, creating an environment that fosters efficient MHV68 reactivation from latency.

Abstract: Multipotent neural stem cells (NSCs) provide a model to investigate neurogenesis and develop mechanisms of cell transplantation. In order to define improved markers of stemness and lineage specificity, we examined self-renewal and multi-lineage markers during long-term expansion and under neuronal and astrocyte differentiating conditions in human ESC-derived NSCs (hNSC H9 cells). In addition, with proteoglycans ubiquitous to the neural niche, we also examined heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and their regulatory enzymes. Our results demonstrate that hNSC H9 cells maintain self-renewal and multipotent capacity during extended culture and express HS biosynthesis enzymes and several HSPG core protein syndecans (SDCs) and glypicans (GPCs) at a high level. In addition, hNSC H9 cells exhibit high neuronal and a restricted glial differentiative potential with lineage differentiation significantly increasing expression of many HS biosynthesis enzymes. Furthermore, neuronal differentiation of the cells upregulated SDC4, GPC1, GPC2, GPC3 and GPC6 expression with increased GPC4 expression observed under astrocyte culture conditions. Finally, downregulation of selected HSPG core proteins altered hNSC H9 cell lineage potential. These findings demonstrate an involvement for HSPGs in mediating hNSC maintenance and lineage commitment and their potential use as novel markers of hNSC and neural cell lineage specification.

Abstract: Differentiated cells retain the genetic information of the donor but the extent to which phenotypic differences between donors or batches of differentiated cells are explained by variation introduced during the differentiation process is not fully understood. In this study, we evaluated four separate batches of commercially available neurons originating from the same iPSCs to investigate whether the differentiation process used in manufacturing iPSCs to neurons affected genome-wide gene expression and modified cytosines, or neuronal sensitivity to drugs. No significant changes in gene expression, as measured by RNA-Seq, or cytosine modification levels, as measured by the Illumina 450K arrays, were observed between batches relative to changes over time. As expected, neurotoxic chemotherapeutics affected neuronal outgrowth, but no inter-batch differences were observed in sensitivity to paclitaxel, vincristine and cisplatin. As a testament to the utility of the model for studies of neuropathy, we observed that genes involved in neuropathy had relatively higher expression levels in these samples across different time points. Our results suggest that the process used to differentiate iPSCs into neurons is consistent, resulting in minimal intra-individual variability across batches. Therefore, this model is reasonable for studies of human neuropathy, druggable targets to prevent neuropathy, and other neurological diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs) appear in response to several types of chronic injury in the human and rodent liver that often develop into liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and primary liver cancers. However, the contribution of HPCs to the pathogenesis and progression of such liver diseases remains controversial. HPCs are generally defined as cells that can differentiate into hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. In this study, however, we found that HPCs isolated from the chronically injured liver can also give rise to myofibroblasts as a third type of descendant. While myofibroblast differentiation from HPCs is not significant in culture, during tumor development, HPCs can contribute to the formation of the tumor microenvironment by producing abundant myofibroblasts that might form a niche for tumor growth and survival. Thus, HPCs can be redefined as cells with a potential for differentiation into myofibroblasts that is specifically activated during tumor formation.

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer is associated with a highly abundant stroma and low-grade inflammation. In the local tumour microenvironment, elevated glucose levels, the presence of tumour-associated stellate cells and macrophages are hypothesised to promote the tumour progression and invasion. The present study investigated the influence by the microenvironment on pancreatic cancer cell invasion in vitro. After co-culture with tumour-associated pancreatic stellate cells (TPSCs), pancreatic cancer cells displayed up to 8-fold reduction in levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers E-cadherin and ZO-1, while β-catenin and vimentin levels were increased. A 3D organotypic model showed that TPSCs stimulated pancreatic cancer cell invasion, both as single cell (PANC-1) and cohort (MIAPaCa-2) invasion. The combined presence of TPSCs and M2-like macrophages induced invasion of the non-invasive BxPC-3 cells. High glucose conditions further enhanced changes in EMT markers as well as the cancer cell invasion. In summary, co-culture with TPSCs induced molecular changes associated with EMT in pancreatic cancer cells, regardless of differentiation status, and the organotypic model demonstrated the influence of microenvironmental factors, such as glucose, stellate cells and macrophages, on pancreatic cancer cell invasion.

Abstract: Axonal transport is important for neuronal development and the maintenance of effective neuronal function in mature cells. Observing the active transport of organelles and vesicles along the axons of living neurons has emerged as a valuable tool for probing the health of the neuron, and assessing changes associated with stress and neurodegenerative disease. Transport relies on two families of motor proteins: kinesins and dynein. Using these motors, a diverse set of cargos are transported toward the axon tip, the cell body, or anywhere in between. Of particular interest are organelles and cargos associated with disease and the changes in motility that these cargos undergo during pathogenesis. Here, we describe the factors that should be considered when studying different cargos, and the imaging parameters associated with optimal tracking of various organelles and proteins. Ultimately, the ideal cargo to investigate depends on the question being asked and the limitations of individual microscopes available for imaging.

Abstract: Kallistatin is an endogenous protein that regulates differential signaling pathways and biological functions. Our previous studies showed that kallistatin gene therapy inhibited angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastasis in mice, and kallistatin protein suppressed Wnt-mediated growth, migration and invasion by blocking Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in breast cancer cells. In this study, we show that kallistatin reduced cell viability, and increased apoptotic cell death and caspase-3 activity in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Kallistatin also induced cancer cell autophagy, as evidenced by increased LC3B levels and elevated Atg5 and Beclin-1 expression; however, co-administration of Wnt or PPARγ antagonist GW9662 abolished these effects. Moreover, kallistatin via its heparin-binding site antagonized Wnt3a-induced cancer cell proliferation and increased PPARγ expression. Kallistatin inhibited oncogenic miR-21 synthesis associated with reduced Akt phosphorylation and Bcl-2 synthesis, but increased BAX expression. Kallistatin via PKC-ERK activation reduced miR-203 levels, leading to increased expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), a tumor suppressor. Conversely, kallistatin stimulated expression of the tumorigenic suppressors miR-34a and p53. Kallistatin’s active site is essential for suppressing miR-21 and miR-203, and stimulating miR-34a and SOCS3 expression. This is the first study to demonstrate that kallistatin’s heparin-binding site is essential for inhibiting Wnt-mediated effects, and its active site plays a key role in regulating miR-21, miR-203, miR-34a and SOCS3 synthesis in breast cancer cells. These findings reveal novel mechanisms of kallistatin in inducing apoptosis and autophagy in breast cancer cells, thus inhibiting tumor progression by regulation of Wnt/PPARγ signaling, as well as miR-21, miR-203 and miR-34a synthesis.

Abstract: The success of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibition as a type 2 diabetes therapy has encouraged deeper examination of the post-proline DPP enzymes. DPP9 has been implicated in immunoregulation, disease pathogenesis and metabolism. The DPP9 enzyme-inactive (Dpp9 gene knock-in; Dpp9 gki) mouse displays neonatal lethality, suggesting that DPP9 enzyme activity is essential in neonatal development. Here we present gene expression patterns in these Dpp9 gki neonatal mice. Taqman PCR arrays and sequential qPCR assays on neonatal liver and gut revealed differential expression of genes involved in cell growth, innate immunity and metabolic pathways including long-chain-fatty-acid uptake and esterification, long-chain fatty acyl-CoA binding, trafficking and transport into mitochondria, lipoprotein metabolism, adipokine transport and gluconeogenesis in the Dpp9 gki mice compared to wild type. In a liver cell line, Dpp9 knockdown increased AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, which suggests a potential mechanism. DPP9 protein levels in liver cells were altered by treatment with EGF, HGF, insulin or palmitate, suggesting potential natural DPP9 regulators. These gene expression analyses of a mouse strain deficient in DPP9 enzyme activity show, for the first time, that DPP9 enzyme activity regulates metabolic pathways in neonatal liver and gut.

Abstract: Current methods of monitoring insulin in culture are limited to soluble insulin (secretions or lysates) or synthetic gene reporter analyses. We present an insulin-specific cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cell-ELISA) to assess relative intracellular insulin protein content of adherent cultures, normalized to cell density with further immunocytochemical verification of insulin-expressing cells within identical cultures. The protocol was optimized and validated using an insulin-expressing cell line (INS-1) by confirming direct relations between intracellular insulin content and insulin-expressing cell density, in a glucose exposure-dependent manner. Utility was demonstrated by identifying multiple INS-1 clones lowly expressing insulin following lentiviral particle delivery of interference RNA intended to down-regulate one of the insulin gene-directed transcription factors, MafA. The cell-ELISA was also applied to monitor insulin content within partially dissociated primary mouse islet cultures. This technique allows for the first time routine analysis of intracellular insulin protein in vitro suitable for investigating islet cell biology by means of multiple parameter screening.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), the self-renewing cells of the adult blood differentiation hierarchy, are generated during embryonic stages. The first HSCs are produced in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region of the embryo through endothelial to a hematopoietic transition. BMP4 and Hedgehog affect their production and expansion, but it is unknown whether they act to affect the same HSCs. In this study using the BRE GFP reporter mouse strain that identifies BMP/Smad-activated cells, we find that the AGM harbors two types of adult-repopulating HSCs upon explant culture: One type is BMP-activated and the other is a non-BMP-activated HSC type that is indirectly controlled by Hedgehog signaling through the VEGF pathway. Transcriptomic analyses demonstrate that the two HSC types express distinct but overlapping genetic programs. These results revealing the bifurcation in HSC types at early embryonic stages in the AGM explant model suggest that their development is dependent upon the signaling molecules in the microenvironment.

Abstract: The cellular response to stress is orchestrated by the expression of a family of proteins termed heat shock proteins (hsp) that are involved in the stabilization of basic cellular processes to preserve cell viability and homeostasis. The bulk of hsp function occurs within the cytosol and subcellular compartments. However, some hsp have also been found outside cells released by an active mechanism independent of cell death. Extracellular hsp act as signaling molecules directed at activating a systemic response to stress. The export of hsp requires the translocation from the cytosol into the extracellular milieu across the plasma membrane. We have proposed that membrane insertion is the initial step in this export process. We investigated the interaction of the major inducible hsp from mammalian (Hsp70) and bacterial (DnaK) species with liposomes. We found that mammalian Hsp70 displayed a high specificity for negatively charged phospholipids, such as phosphatidyl serine, whereas DnaK interacted with all lipids tested regardless of the charge. Both proteins were inserted into the lipid bilayer as demonstrated by resistance to acid or basic washes that was confirmed by partial protection from proteolytic cleavage. Several regions of mammalian Hsp70 were inserted into the membrane with a small portion of the N-terminus end exposed to the outer phase of the liposome. In contrast, the N-terminus end of DnaK was inserted into the membrane, exposing the C-terminus end outside the liposome. Mammalian Hsp70 was found to make high oligomeric complexes upon insertion into the membranes whereas DnaK only formed dimers within the lipid bilayer. These observations suggest that both Hsp70s interact with lipids, but mammalian Hsp70 displays a high degree of specificity and structure as compared with the bacterial form.

Abstract: The guanine nucleotide protein (G protein)-coupled receptors (GPCRs) superfamily represents the largest class of membrane protein in the human genome. More than a half of all GPCRs are dedicated to interact with odorants and are termed odorant-receptors (ORs). Linda Buck and Richard Axel, the Nobel Prize laureates in physiology or medicine in 2004, first cloned and characterized the gene family that encode ORs, establishing the foundations to the understanding of the molecular basis for odor recognition. In the last decades, a lot of progress has been done to unravel the functioning of the sense of smell. This chapter gives a general overview of the topic of olfactory receptor signaling and reviews recent advances in this field.

Abstract: Summary
Zinc (Zn) is an essential metal that vertebrates sequester from pathogens to protect against infection. Investigating the opportunistic pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii’s response to Zn starvation, we identified a putative Zn metallochaperone, ZigA, which binds Zn and is required for bacterial growth under Zn-limiting conditions and for disseminated infection in mice. ZigA is encoded adjacent to the histidine (His) utilization (Hut) system. The His ammonia-lyase HutH binds Zn very tightly only in the presence of high His and makes Zn bioavailable through His catabolism. The released Zn enables A. baumannii to combat host-imposed Zn starvation. These results demonstrate that A. baumannii employs several mechanisms to ensure bioavailability of Zn during infection, with ZigA functioning predominately during Zn starvation, but HutH operating in both Zn-deplete and -replete conditions to mobilize a labile His-Zn pool.

Abstract: Summary
Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy is linked to severe birth defects, but mother-to-fetus transmission routes are unknown. We infected different primary cell types from mid- and late-gestation placentas and explants from first-trimester chorionic villi with the prototype Ugandan and a recently isolated Nicaraguan ZIKV strain. ZIKV infects primary human placental cells and explants—cytotrophoblasts, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and Hofbauer cells in chorionic villi and amniotic epithelial cells and trophoblast progenitors in amniochorionic membranes—that express Axl, Tyro3, and/or TIM1 viral entry cofactors. ZIKV produced NS3 and E proteins and generated higher viral titers in amniotic epithelial cells from mid-gestation compared to late-gestation placentas. Duramycin, a peptide that binds phosphatidylethanolamine in enveloped virions and precludes TIM1 binding, reduced ZIKV infection in placental cells and explants. Our results suggest that ZIKV spreads from basal and parietal decidua to chorionic villi and amniochorionic membranes and that targeting TIM1 could suppress infection at the uterine-placental interface.

Abstract: The rapid emergence of the zebrafish as a cancer model has been aided by advances in genetic, chemical, and imaging technologies. Melanoma in particular highlights both the power and challenges associated with cancer modeling in zebrafish. This chapter focuses on the lessons that have emerged from the melanoma models as paradigmatic of what will apply to nearly all cancer models in the zebrafish system. We specifically focus on methodologies related to germline and mosaic transgenic melanoma generation, and how these can be used to deeply interrogate additional cooperating oncogenes or tumor suppressors. These transgenic tumors can in turn be used to generate zebrafish-specific, stable melanoma cell lines which can be fluorescently labeled, modified by cDNA/CRISPR techniques, and used for detailed in vivo imaging of cancer progression in real time. These zebrafish melanoma models are beginning to elucidate both cell intrinsic and microenvironmental factors in melanoma that have broader implications for human disease. We envision that nearly all of the techniques described here can be applied to other zebrafish cancer models, and likely expanded beyond what we describe here.

Abstract: Summary
The rigorous characterization of distinct induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) derived from multiple reprogramming technologies, somatic sources, and donors is required to understand potential sources of variability and downstream potential. To achieve this goal, the Progenitor Cell Biology Consortium performed comprehensive experimental and genomic analyses of 58 iPSC from ten laboratories generated using a variety of reprogramming genes, vectors, and cells. Associated global molecular characterization studies identified functionally informative correlations in gene expression, DNA methylation, and/or copy-number variation among key developmental and oncogenic regulators as a result of donor, sex, line stability, reprogramming technology, and cell of origin. Furthermore, X-chromosome inactivation in PSC produced highly correlated differences in teratoma-lineage staining and regulator expression upon differentiation. All experimental results, and raw, processed, and metadata from these analyses, including powerful tools, are interactively accessible from a new online portal at https://www.synapse.org to serve as a reusable resource for the stem cell community.

Abstract: Local acidosis is one of the characteristic features of the cancer microenvironment. Many reports indicate that acidosis accelerates the proliferation and invasiveness of cancer cells. However, whether acidic conditions affect lymphatic metastasis is currently unknown. In the present study, we focused on the effects of acidosis on lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) to assess the relationship between acidic microenvironments and lymph node metastasis. We demonstrated that normal human LECs express various acid receptors by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Acidic stimulation with low pH medium induced morphological changes in LECs to a spindle shape, and significantly promoted cellular growth and tube formation. Moreover, real-time PCR revealed that acidic conditions increased the mRNA expression of interleukin (IL)-8. Acidic stimulation increased IL-8 production in LECs, whereas a selective transient receptor potential vanilloid subtype 1 (TRPV1) antagonist, 5′-iodoresiniferatoxin, decreased IL-8 production. IL-8 accelerated the proliferation of LECs, and inhibition of IL-8 diminished tube formation and cell migration. In addition, phosphorylation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB was induced by acidic conditions, and inhibition of NF-κB activation reduced acid-induced IL-8 expression. These results suggest that acidic microenvironments in tumors induce lymphangiogenesis via TRPV1 activation in LECs, which in turn may promote lymphatic metastasis.

Abstract: Interleukin (IL)-22 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine driving the progression of the psoriatic lesion with other cytokines, as Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-alpha and IL-17. Our study was aimed at evaluating the early effect of IL-22 alone or in combination with TNF-alpha and IL-17 by immunofluorescence on i) keratinocyte (KC) proliferation, ii) terminal differentiation biomarkers as keratin (K) 10 and 17 expression, iii) intercellular junctions. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was performed. A model of human skin culture reproducing a psoriatic microenvironment was used. Plastic surgery explants were obtained from healthy young women (n=7) after informed consent. Fragments were divided before adding IL-22 or a combination of the three cytokines, and harvested 24 (T24), 48 (T48), and 72 (T72)h later. From T24, in IL-22 samples we detected a progressive decrease in K10 immunostaining in the spinous layer paralleled by K17 induction. By TEM, after IL-22 incubation, keratin aggregates were evident in the perinuclear area. Occludin immunostaining was not homogeneously distributed. Conversely, KC proliferation was not inhibited by IL-22 alone, but only by the combination of cytokines. Our results suggest that IL-22 affects keratinocyte terminal differentiation, whereas, in order to induce a proliferation impairment, a more complex psoriatic-like microenvironment is needed.

Abstract: Several eye diseases are associated with axonal injury in the optic nerve, which normally leads to degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and subsequently to loss of vision. There is experimental evidence that some members of the small heat shock protein family (HspBs) are upregulated upon optic nerve injury (ONI) in the retina and sufficient to promote RGC survival. These data raise the question as to whether other family members may play a similar role in this context. Here, we performed a comprehensive comparative study comprising all HspBs in an experimental model of ONI. We found that five HspBs were expressed in the adult rat retina at control conditions but only HspB1 and HspB5 were upregulated in response to ONI. Furthermore, HspB1 and HspB5 were constitutively phosphorylated in Müller cells at serine 15 and serine 59, respectively. In RGCs, phosphorylation was stimulated by ONI and occurred at serine 86 of HspB1 and at serine 19 and 45 of HspB5. These data suggest that of all small heat shock proteins, only HspB1 and HspB5 might be of protective value for RGCs after ONI and that this process might be regulated by phosphorylation at serine 86 of HspB1 and serine 19 and serine 45 of HspB5. The molecular targets of phosphoHspB1 and phosphoHspB5 remain to be identified.

Abstract: Excessive apoptosis of hematopoietic precursors in the bone marrow underlies the ineffective hematopoiesis characteristic of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling is abnormally activated in MDS and may be involved in excessive programmed cell death in the pathogenesis of MDS. TLRs expression and global histone H3/H4 acetylation were analyzed in bone marrow (BM) CD34+ cells from 20 lower-risk and 20 higher-risk MDS patients and 10 healthy controls. Apoptosis of BM CD34+ cells was examined by flow cytometry, and its correlation to histone acetylation and the expression of TLR2 and β-arrestin1 (β-arr1), measured by enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay and qRT-PCR, was assessed. TLR1, TLR2 and TLR6 expression and H4 acetylation levels were higher in lower-risk MDS patients than in higher-risk MDS patients or controls, and TLR2 expression and H4 acetylation levels were positively correlated with an increased rate of apoptosis. Lower-risk MDS was associated with increased β-arr1 expression and histone acetyltransferase p300 activity. In in vitro-cultured primary normal and lower-risk MDS CD34+ cells, TLR2 activation-induced apoptosis was mediated by the upregulation of β-arr1 leading to the recruitment of p300 and increased histone H4 acetylation. The nuclear accumulation of βarr1 following TLR2 activation promote H4 acetylation at specific target gene promoters and may thus affect transcription of target genes in BM CD34+ cells. The mechanisms underlying the deregulation of TLR2 and increased apoptosis in MDS may involve the β-arr1 mediated recruitment of p300 leading to increased levels of histone H4 acetylation.

Abstract: Copper is an essential trace element, however, excess copper is harmful to human health. Excess copper-derived oxidants contribute to the progression of Wilson disease, and oxidative stress induces accumulation of abnormal proteins. It is known that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays an important role in proper protein folding, and that accumulation of misfolded proteins disturbs ER homeostasis resulting in ER stress. However, copper-induced ER homeostasis disturbance has not been fully clarified. We treated human hepatoma cell line (Huh7) and immortalized-human hepatocyte cell line (OUMS29) with copper and chemical chaperones, including 4-phenylbutyrate and ursodeoxycholic acid. We examined copper-induced oxidative stress, ER stress and apoptosis by immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblot analyses. Furthermore, we examined the effects of copper on carcinogenesis. Excess copper induced not only oxidative stress but also ER stress. Furthermore, excess copper induced DNA damage and reduced cell proliferation. Chemical chaperones reduced this copper-induced hepatotoxicity. Excess copper induced hepatotoxicity via ER stress. We also confirmed the abnormality of ultra-structure of the ER of hepatocytes in patients with Wilson disease. These findings show that ER stress plays a pivotal role in Wilson disease, and suggests that chemical chaperones may have beneficial effects in the treatment of Wilson disease.

Abstract: Inositol displays multi-targeted effects on many biochemical pathways involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). As Akt activation is inhibited by inositol, we investigated if such effect could hamper EMT in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. In cancer cells treated with pharmacological doses of inositol E-cadherin was increased, β-catenin was redistributed behind cell membrane, and metalloproteinase-9 was significantly reduced, while motility and invading capacity were severely inhibited. Those changes were associated with a significant down-regulation of PI3K/Akt activity, leading to a decrease in downstream signaling effectors: NF-kB, COX-2, and SNAI1. Inositol-mediated inhibition of PS1 leads to lowered Notch 1 release, thus contributing in decreasing SNAI1 levels. Overall, these data indicated that inositol inhibits the principal molecular pathway supporting EMT. Similar results were obtained in ZR-75, a highly metastatic breast cancer line. These findings are coupled with significant changes on cytoskeleton. Inositol slowed-down vimentin expression in cells placed behind the wound-healing edge and stabilized cortical F-actin. Moreover, lamellipodia and filopodia, two specific membrane extensions enabling cell migration and invasiveness, were no longer detectable after inositol addiction. Additionally, fascin and cofilin, two mandatory required components for F-actin assembling within cell protrusions, were highly reduced. These data suggest that inositol may induce an EMT reversion in breast cancer cells, suppressing motility and invasiveness through cytoskeleton modifications.

Abstract: Summary
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs), which are derived from a peri-implantation embryo, are routinely cultured in medium containing diabetic glucose (Glc) concentrations. While pregnancy in women with pre-existing diabetes may result in small embryos, whether such high Glc levels affect ESC growth remains uncovered. We show here that long-term exposure of ESCs to diabetic Glc inhibits their proliferation, thereby mimicking in vivo findings. Molecularly, Glc exposure increased oxidative stress and activated Forkhead box O3a (FOXO3a), promoting increased expression and activity of the ROS-removal enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase and the cell-cycle inhibitors p21cip1 and p27kip1. Diabetic Glc also promoted β-catenin nuclear localization and the formation of a complex with FOXO3a that localized to the promoters of Sod2, p21cip1, and potentially p27kip1. Our results demonstrate an adaptive response to increases in oxidative stress induced by diabetic Glc conditions that promote ROS removal, but also result in a decrease in proliferation.

Abstract: Summary
Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is a chaperone that normally scans the proteome and initiates the turnover of some proteins (termed clients) by linking them to the degradation pathways. This activity is critical to normal protein homeostasis, yet it appears to fail in diseases associated with abnormal protein accumulation. It is not clear why Hsp70 promotes client degradation under some conditions, while sparing that protein under others. Here, we used a combination of chemical biology and genetic strategies to systematically perturb the affinity of Hsp70 for the model client, tau. This approach revealed that tight complexes between Hsp70 and tau were associated with enhanced turnover while transient interactions favored tau retention. These results suggest that client affinity is one important parameter governing Hsp70-mediated quality control.

Abstract: CD1a is involved in presentation to the immune system of lipid antigen derived from tumor cells with subsequent T cell activation. Hsp60 is a molecular chaperone implicated in carcinogenesis by, for instance, modulating the immune reaction against the tumor. We have previously postulated a synergism between CD1a and Hsp60 as a key factor in the activation of an effective antitumor immune response in squamous epithelia. Keratoacantomas (KAs) are benign tumors that however can transform into squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), but the reasons for this malignization are unknown. In a previous study, we found that CD1a-positive cells are significantly more numerous in KA than in SCC. In this study, we analyzed a series of KAs and SCCs by immunohistochemistry for CD1a and Hsp60. Our results show that the levels of both are significantly lower in KA than in SCC and support the hypothesis that KA may evolve towards SCC if there is a failure of the local modulation of the antitumor immune response. The data also show that immunohistochemistry for CD1a and Hsp60 can be of help in differential diagnosis between KAs and well-differentiated forms of SCC.

Abstract: Endosomes play critical roles on regulating surface receptor levels as well as signaling cascades in all cell types, including neurons. Endocytosis and endosomal trafficking is routinely studied after fixation, but live imaging is increasingly being used to capture the dynamic nature of endosomes and is allowing increasingly sophisticated glimpses into trafficking processes in live neurons. In this chapter, we describe the basics of neuronal primary cultures, methods for expressing fluorescent proteins, and live imaging of cargos and endosomal regulators.

Abstract: The complex process of wound healing is a major problem associated with diabetes, venous or arterial disease, old age and infection. A wide range of pharmacological effects including anabolic, anti-diabetic and hepato-protective activities have been attributed to Ecdysterone. In earlier studies, Ecdysterone has been shown to modulate eNOS and iNOS expression in diabetic animals and activate osteogenic differentiation through the Extracellular-signal-Regulated Kinase (ERK) pathway in periodontal ligament stem cells. However, in the wound healing process, Ecdysterone has only been shown to enhance granulation tissue formation in rabbits. There have been no studies to date, which elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the complex cellular process involved in wound healing. The present study, demonstrates a novel interaction between the phytosteroid Ecdysterone and Nitric Oxide Synthase (NOS), in an Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-dependent manner, thereby promoting cell proliferation, cell spreading and cell migration. These observations were further supported by the 4-amino-5-methylamino- 2′ ,7′ -difluorofluorescein diacetate (DAF FM) fluorescence assay which indicated that Ecdysterone activates NOS resulting in increased Nitric Oxide (NO) production. Additionally, studies with inhibitors of both the EGFR and ERK, demonstrated that Ecdysterone activates NOS through modulation of EGFR and ERK. These results clearly demonstrate, for the first time, that Ecdysterone enhances Nitric Oxide production and modulates complex cellular processes by activating ERK1/2 through the EGF pathway.

Abstract: Summary
In utero hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell transplantation (IUHSCT) has only been fully successful in the treatment of congenital immunodeficiency diseases. Using sheep as a large animal model of IUHSCT, we demonstrate that administration of CD146+CXCL12+VEGFR2+ or CD146+CXCL12+VEGFR2− cells prior to, or in combination with, hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSC), results in robust CXCL12 production within the fetal marrow environment, and significantly increases the levels of hematopoietic engraftment. While in the fetal recipient, donor-derived HSC were found to reside within the trabecular bone, the increased expression of VEGFR2 in the microvasculature of CD146+CXCL12+VEGFR2+ transplanted animals enhanced levels of donor-derived hematopoietic cells in circulation. These studies provide important insights into IUHSCT biology, and demonstrate the feasibility of enhancing HSC engraftment to levels that would likely be therapeutic in many candidate diseases for IUHSCT.

Abstract: The TALE nuclease and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated systems (Cas) have been developed as important tools for genome editing in zebrafish. Here we describe a CRISPR/Cas9-based approach for generating site-specific gene targeting in zebrafish using DNA double-strand breaks induced homologous recombination (HR)-dependent repair mechanism. Through comicroinjection of Cas9 mRNA, guide RNA targeting genomic DNA sequence corresponding to the twist2 gene and the corresponding double-strand long arm donor template with a point mutation identified in human, HR-mediated knock-in of the expected targeting sequence was obtained. To facilitate identification of germline transmission of targeted mutation, a method of screening sperms of male founder fish is designed.

Abstract: Summary
Controversy surrounds reports describing the derivation of human trophoblast cells from placentas and embryonic stem cells (ESC), partly due to the difficulty in identifying markers that define cells as belonging to the trophoblast lineage. We have selected criteria that are characteristic of primary first-trimester trophoblast: a set of protein markers, HLA class I profile, methylation of ELF5, and expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) from the chromosome 19 miRNA cluster (C19MC). We tested these criteria on cells previously reported to show some phenotypic characteristics of trophoblast: bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-treated human ESC and 2102Ep, an embryonal carcinoma cell line. Both cell types only show some, but not all, of the four trophoblast criteria. Thus, BMP-treated human ESC have not fully differentiated to trophoblast. Our study identifies a robust panel, including both protein and non-protein-coding markers that, in combination, can be used to reliably define cells as characteristic of early trophoblast.

Abstract: Resistance to anthracycline based chemotherapy is a major limitation in the treatment of breast cancer, particularly of the triple negative sub-type that lacks targeted therapies. Resistance that arises from tumor-stromal interaction facilitated by integrins provides the possibility of targeted disruption. In the present study, we demonstrate that integrin β3 signaling inhibits apoptosis induced by a DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agent, epirubicin, in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Drug efflux based mechanisms do not contribute to this effect. We show that integrin β3 employs the PI3K-Akt and the MAPK pathway for enabling cell survival and proliferation. Further, our results indicate that integrin β3 helps inhibit epirubicin induced cytotoxicity by repression of the pro-apoptotic protein BAD, thus promoting an anti-apoptotic response. Myristoylated RGT peptide and a monoclonal antibody against integrin β3 brought about a reversal of this effect and chemosensitized the cells. These results identify β3 integrin signaling via repression of BAD as an important survival pathway used by breast cancer cells to evade chemotherapy induced stress.

Abstract: The biology of glioblastoma invasion and its mechanisms are poorly understood. We demonstrate using time-lapse microscopy that grafting of glioblastoma (GBM) tumorspheres into rodent brain slices results in experimental ex vivo tumors with invasive properties that recapitulate the invasion observed after orthotopic transplantation into the rodent brain. The migratory movements and mitotic patterns were clearly modified by signals extrinsic to the invading cells. The cells migrated away from the tumorspheres, and removal of the spheres reduced the directed invasive movement. The cell cultures contained different populations of invasive cells that had distinct morphology and invasive behavior patterns. Grafts of the most invasive GBM culture contained 91±8% cells with an invasive phenotype, characterized by small soma with a distinct leading process. Conversely, the majority of cells in less invasive GBM grafts were phenotypically heterogeneous: only 6.3±4.1% of the cells had the invasive phenotype. Grafts of highly and moderately invasive cultures had different proportions of cells that advanced into the brain slice parenchyma during the observation period: 89.2±2.2% and 23.1±6.8%, respectively. In grafts with moderately invasive properties, most of the cells (76.8±6.8%) invading the surrounding brain tissue returned to the tumor bulk or stopped centrifugal migration. Our data suggest that the invasion of individual GBM tumors can be conditioned by the prevalence of a cell fraction with particular invasive morphology and by signaling between the tumor core and invasive cells. These findings can be important for the development of new therapeutic strategies that target the invasive GBM cells.

Abstract: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are seven transmembrane (TM) proteins that play a key role in human physiology. The GPCR superfamily comprises about 800 members, classified into several classes, with rhodopsin-like Class A being the largest and most studied thus far. A huge component of the human repertoire consists of the chemosensory GPCRs, including ∼400 odorant receptors, 25 bitter taste receptors (TAS2Rs), which are thought to guard the organism from consuming poisons, and sweet and umami TAS1R heteromers, which indicate the nutritive value of food. The location of the binding site of TAS2Rs is similar to that of Class A GPCRs. However, most of the known bitter ligands are agonists, with only a few antagonists documented thus far. The agonist-to-antagonist ratios of Class A GPCRs vary, but in general are much lower than for TAS2Rs. For a set of well-studied GPCRs, a gradual change in agonists-to-antagonists ratios is observed when comparing low (10μM)- and high (10nM)-affinity ligand sets from ChEMBL and the DrugBank set of drugs. This shift reflects pharmaceutical bias toward the therapeutically desirable pharmacology for each of these GPCRs, while the 10μM sets possibly represent the native tendency of the receptors toward either agonists or antagonists. Analyzing ligand–GPCR interactions in 56 X-ray structures representative of currently available structural data, we find that the N-terminus, TM1 and TM2 are more involved in binding of antagonists than of agonists. On the other hand, ECL2 tends to be more involved in binding of agonists. This is of interest, since TAS2Rs harbor variations on the typical Class A sequence motifs, including the absence of the ECL2-TM3 disulfide bridge. This suggests an alternative mode of regulation of conformational states for TAS2Rs, with potentially less stabilized inactive state. The comparison of TAS2Rs and Class A GPCRs structural features and the pharmacology of the their ligands highlights the intricacies of GPCR architecture and provides a framework for rational design of new ligands.

Abstract: Summary
Membrane transporters are critical modulators of drug pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety. One example is the proton-dependent oligopeptide transporter PepT1, also known as SLC15A1, which is responsible for the uptake of the β-lactam antibiotics and various peptide-based prodrugs. In this study, we modeled the binding of various peptides to a bacterial homolog, PepTSt, and evaluated a range of computational methods for predicting the free energy of binding. Our results show that a hybrid approach (endpoint methods to classify peptides into good and poor binders and a theoretically exact method for refinement) is able to accurately predict affinities, which we validated using proteoliposome transport assays. Applying the method to a homology model of PepT1 suggests that the approach requires a high-quality structure to be accurate. Our study provides a blueprint for extending these computational methodologies to other pharmaceutically important transporter families.

Abstract: Septins are guanine nucleotide–binding proteins that are conserved from fungi to humans. Septins assemble into heterooligomeric complexes and higher-order structures with key roles in various cellular functions including cell migration and division. The mechanisms by which septins assemble and interact with other cytoskeletal elements like actin remain elusive. A powerful approach to address this question is by cell-free reconstitution of purified cytoskeletal proteins combined with fluorescence microscopy. Here, we describe procedures for the purification of recombinant Drosophila and human septin hexamers from Escherichia coli and reconstitution of actin–septin coassembly. These procedures can be used to compare assembly of Drosophila and human septins and their coassembly with the actin cytoskeleton by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy.

Abstract: As a survival strategy to environmental water deficits, desiccation-tolerant organisms are commonly known for their ability to recruit stress-protective biomolecules such as trehalose. We have previously reported the pivotal role of trehalose in larval desiccation tolerance in Drosophila melanogaster. Trehalose has emerged as a versatile molecule, serving mainly as energy source in insects and also being a stress protectant. While several recent reports have revealed the unconventional role of trehalose in scavenging reactive oxygen species in yeast and plants, this aspect has not received much attention in animals. We examined the status of desiccation-induced generation of reactive oxygen species in D. melanogaster larvae and the possible involvement of trehalose in ameliorating the harmful consequences thereof. Insect trehalose synthesis is governed by the enzyme trehalose 6-phosphate synthase 1 (TPS1). Using the ubiquitous da-GAL4-driven expression of the dTps1-RNAi transgene, we generated dTps1-downregulated Drosophila larvae possessing depleted levels of dTps1 transcripts. This resulted in the inability of the larvae for trehalose synthesis, thereby allowing us to elucidate the significance of trehalose in the regulation of desiccation-responsive redox homeostasis. Furthermore, the results from molecular genetics studies, biochemical assays, electron spin resonance analyses and a simple, non-invasive method of whole larval live imaging suggested that trehalose in collaboration with superoxide dismutase (SOD) is involved in the maintenance of redox state in D. melanogaster.

Abstract: Summary
Precision medicine in oncology requires not only identification of cancer-associated mutations but also effective drugs for each cancer genotype, which is still a largely unsolved problem. One approach for the latter challenge has been large-scale testing of small molecules in genetically characterized cell lines. We hypothesized that compounds with high cell-line-selective lethality exhibited consistent results across such pharmacogenomic studies. We analyzed the compound sensitivity data of 6,259 lethal compounds from the NCI-60 project. A total of 2,565 cell-line-selective lethal compounds were identified and grouped into 18 clusters based on their median growth inhibitory GI50 profiles across the 60 cell lines, which were shown to represent distinct mechanisms of action. Further transcriptome analysis revealed a biomarker, NADPH abundance, for predicting sensitivity to ferroptosis-inducing compounds, which we experimentally validated. In summary, incorporating cell-line-selectivity filters improves the predictive power of pharmacogenomic analyses and enables discovery of biomarkers that predict the sensitivity of cells to specific cell death inducers.

Abstract: Genomic DNA methylation functions to repress gene expression by interfering with transcription factor binding and/or recruiting repressive chromatin machinery. Recent data support contribution of regulated DNA methylation to embryonic pluripotency, development, and tissue differentiation; this important epigenetic mark is chemically stable yet enzymatically reversible—and heritable through the germline. Importantly, all the major components involved in dynamic DNA methylation are conserved in zebrafish, including the factors that “write, read, and erase” this mark. Therefore, the zebrafish has become an excellent model for studying most biological processes associated with DNA methylation in mammals. Here we briefly review the zebrafish model for studying DNA methylation and describe a series of methods for performing genome-wide DNA methylation analysis. We address and provide methods for methylated DNA immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (MeDIP-Seq), bisulfite sequencing (BS-Seq), and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS-Seq).

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoiesis is a multistage process involving the differentiation of stem and progenitor cells into distinct mature cell lineages. Here we present Haemopedia, an atlas of murine gene-expression data containing 54 hematopoietic cell types, covering all the mature lineages in hematopoiesis. We include rare cell populations such as eosinophils, mast cells, basophils, and megakaryocytes, and a broad collection of progenitor and stem cells. We show that lineage branching and maturation during hematopoiesis can be reconstructed using the expression patterns of small sets of genes. We also have identified genes with enriched expression in each of the mature blood cell lineages, many of which show conserved lineage-enriched expression in human hematopoiesis. We have created an online web portal called Haemosphere to make analyses of Haemopedia and other blood cell transcriptional datasets easier. This resource provides simple tools to interrogate gene-expression-based relationships between hematopoietic cell types and genes of interest.

Isolation and characterization of circulating lymphatic endothelial colony forming cells,

Abstract: Rationale
The identification of circulating endothelial progenitor cells has led to speculation regarding their origin as well as their contribution to neovascular development. Two distinct types of endothelium make up the blood and lymphatic vessel system. However, it has yet to be determined whether there are distinct lymphatic-specific circulating endothelial progenitor cells.
Objective
This study aims to isolate and characterize the cellular properties and global gene expression of lymphatic-specific endothelial progenitor cells.
Methods and results
We isolated circulating endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs) from whole peripheral blood. These cells are endothelial in nature, as defined by their expression of endothelial markers and their ability to undergo capillary morphogenesis in three-dimensional culture. A subset of isolated colonies express markers of lymphatic endothelium, including VEGFR-3 and Prox-1, with low levels of VEGFR-1, a blood endothelial marker, while the bulk of the isolated cells express high VEGFR-1 levels with low VEGFR-3 and Prox-1 expression. The different isolates have differential responses to VEGF-C, a lymphatic endothelial specific cytokine, strongly suggesting that there are lymphatic specific and blood specific ECFCs. Global analysis of gene expression revealed key differences in the regulation of pathways involved in cellular differentiation between blood and lymphatic-specific ECFCs.
Conclusion
These data indicate that there are two distinguishable circulating ECFC types, blood and lymphatic, which are likely to have discrete functions during neovascularization.

Abstract: Summary
Although pluripotent stem cells can be differentiated into the hepatocyte lineages, such cells retain an immature phenotype. As the chromatin state of regulatory regions controls spatiotemporal gene expression during development, we evaluated changes in epigenetic histone marks in lineage-specific genes throughout in vitro hepatocyte differentiation from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Active acetylation and methylation marks at promoters and enhancers correlated with progressive changes in gene expression. However, repression-associated H3K27me3 marks at these control regions showed an inverse correlation with gene repression during transition from hepatic endoderm to a hepatocyte-like state. Inhibitor of Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2) reduced H3K27me3 decoration but did not improve hepatocyte maturation. Thus, H3K27me3 at regulatory regions does not regulate transcription and appears dispensable for hepatocyte lineage differentiation of hESCs in vitro.

Abstract: Activation of NF-κB signaling plays pivotal roles in innate immune responses against pathogens. It requires strict control to avert inflammatory diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying this tight regulation are not completely understood. Here, we identified LRRC14, a novel member of LRR (leucine-rich repeat) protein family, as a negative regulator in TLR signaling. Expression of LRRC14 resulted in decreased activation of NF-κB, whereas knockdown of LRRC14 enhanced NF-κB activation as well as the production of inflammatory cytokines. Mechanistically, LRRC14 bound to HLH domain of IKKβ to block its interaction with NEMO and thereby inhibiting the phosphorylation of IKKβ and NF-κB activation. In addition, our data showed that TLR signaling led to lower expression of LRRC14. Together, LRRC14 may function as a checkpoint to prevent overzealous inflammation.

Abstract: A multitude of physiological processes regulated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) signaling are accomplished by the participation of active rearrangements of the cytoskeleton. In general, it is common that a cross talk occurs among networks of microfilaments, microtubules, and intermediate filaments in order to reach specific cell responses. In particular, actin–cytoskeleton dynamics regulate processes such as cell shape, cell division, cell motility, and cell polarization, among others. This chapter describes the current knowledge about the regulation of actin–cytoskeleton dynamic by diverse GPCR signaling pathways, and also includes some protocols combining immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy for the visualization of the different rearrangements of the actin–cytoskeleton. We report how both the S1P-GPCR/G12/13/Rho/ROCK and glucagon-GPCR/Gs/cAMP axes induce differential actin–cytoskeleton rearrangements in epithelial cells. We also show that specific actin-binding molecules, like phalloidin and LifeAct, are very useful to analyze F-actin reorganization by confocal microscopy, and also that both molecules show similar results in fixed cells, whereas the anti-actin antibody is useful to detect both the G- and F-actin, as well as their compartmentalization. Thus, it is highly recommended to utilize different approaches to investigate the regulation of actin dynamics by GPCR signaling, with the aim to get a better picture of the phenomenon under study.

Abstract: Summary
Self-renewal, replication, and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are regulated by cytokines produced by niche cells in fetal liver and bone marrow. HSCs must overcome stresses induced by cytokine deprivation during normal development. In this study, we found that ubiquitin-specific peptidase 10 (USP10) is a crucial deubiquitinase for mouse hematopoiesis. All USP10 knockout (KO) mice died within 1 year because of bone marrow failure with pancytopenia. Bone marrow failure in these USP10-KO mice was associated with remarkable reductions of long-term HSCs (LT-HSCs) in bone marrow and fetal liver. Such USP10-KO fetal liver exhibited enhanced apoptosis of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) including LT-HSCs but not of lineage-committed progenitor cells. Transplantation of USP10-competent bone marrow cells into USP10-KO mice reconstituted multilineage hematopoiesis. These results suggest that USP10 is an essential deubiquitinase in hematopoiesis and functions by inhibiting apoptosis of HSPCs including LT-HSCs.

Abstract: The mechanisms by which macrophages control the inflammatory response, wound healing, biomaterial-interactions, and tissue regeneration appear to be related to their activation/differentiation states. Studies of macrophage behavior in vitro can be useful for elucidating their mechanisms of action, but it is not clear to what extent the source of macrophages affects their apparent behavior, potentially affecting interpretation of results. Although comparative studies of macrophage behavior with respect to cell source have been conducted, there has been no direct comparison of the three most commonly used cell sources: murine bone marrow, human monocytes from peripheral blood (PB), and the human leukemic monocytic cell line THP-1, across multiple macrophage phenotypes. In this study, we used multivariate discriminant analysis to compare the in vitro expression of genes commonly chosen to assess macrophage phenotype across all three sources of macrophages, as well as those derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), that were polarized towards four distinct phenotypes using the same differentiation protocols: M(LPS,IFN) (aka M1), M(IL4,IL13) (aka M2a), M(IL10) (aka M2c), and M(-) (aka M0) used as control. Several differences in gene expression trends were found among the sources of macrophages, especially between murine bone marrow-derived and human blood-derived M(LPS,IFN) and M(IL4,IL13) macrophages with respect to commonly used phenotype markers like CCR7 and genes associated with angiogenesis and tissue regeneration like FGF2 and MMP9. We found that the genes with the most similar patterns of expression among all sources were CXCL-10 and CXCL-11 for M(LPS,IFN) and CCL17 and CCL22 for M(IL4,IL13). Human PB-derived macrophages and human iPSC-derived macrophages showed similar gene expression patterns among the groups and genes studied here, suggesting that iPSC-derived monocytes have the potential to be used as a reliable cell source of human macrophages for in vitro studies. These findings could help select appropriate markers when testing macrophage behavior in vitro and highlight those markers that may confuse interpretation of results from experiments employing macrophages from different sources.

Abstract: Testing functional hypotheses on the roles played by individual microtubule-related proteins in developing neurons benefits from having an effective means for depleting an individual protein from a population of cultured vertebrate neurons over an appropriate window. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) has the advantage of high transfection efficiency, but has certain limitations that require strategic experimental design. Here we describe the insights that we have gained over the years from using this approach.

Abstract: Summary
Type I interferons (IFN-Is) are fundamental for antiviral immunity, but their role in bacterial infections is contradictory and incompletely described. Streptococcus pyogenes activates IFN-I production in innate immune cells, and IFN-I receptor 1 (Ifnar1)-deficient mice are highly susceptible to S. pyogenes infection. Here we report that IFN-I signaling protects the host against invasive S. pyogenes infection by restricting inflammation-driven damage in distant tissues. Lethality following infection in Ifnar1-deficient mice is caused by systemically exacerbated levels of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β. Critical cellular effectors of IFN-I in vivo are LysM+ and CD11c+ myeloid cells, which exhibit suppression of Il1b transcription upon Ifnar1 engagement. These cells are also the major source of IFN-β, which is significantly induced by S. pyogenes 23S rRNA in an Irf5-dependent manner. Our study establishes IL-1β and IFN-I levels as key homeostatic variables of protective, yet tuned, immune responses against severe invasive bacterial infection.

Abstract: To improve our understanding of pattern formation during development and disease we heavily rely on the identification of novel regulators and pathways. While RNA sequencing yields genome-wide expression data that suit this purpose, it lacks spatial resolution. Such spatial resolution can be obtained by microscopy-based methods like in situ hybridization, but these fail to provide information on more than a few genes at a time. Here, we describe tomo-seq, a technique that combines the advantages of the above-mentioned approaches and provides genome-wide expression data with spatial information. The tomo-seq technique is based on cryosectioning of an embryo or tissue of interest and performing RNA-seq on individual sections. Using this method, we have generated genome-wide transcriptomics with high spatial resolution of the whole zebrafish embryo at various stages of development (Junker et al., 2014) and of adult zebrafish hearts after injury (Wu et al., 2016).

Abstract: Acidic conditions are present in degenerated intervertebral discs and are believed to be responsible for matrix breakdown. Acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a) is expressed in endplate chondrocytes, and its activation is associated with endplate chondrocyte apoptosis. However, the precise role of ASIC1a in regulating the matrix metabolic activity of endplate chondrocytes in response to extracellular acid remains poorly understood. Aggrecan (ACAN), type II collagen (Col2a1), and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expressions were determined using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and Western blot. ASIC1a was knocked down by transfecting endplate chondrocytes with ASIC1a siRNA. MMP activity and NF-κB transcriptional activity were measured. NF-κB transcriptional activity was assessed by examining cytosolic phosphorylated IκBα and nuclear phosphorylated p65 levels. Extracellular acidic solution (pH 6.0) resulted in a decrease in ACAN and Co12a1 expressions and an increase in MMP-1, MMP-9, and MMP-13 expressions, as well as in MMP activity; while ASIC1a siRNA blocked these effects. In addition, acid-induced increase in cytosolic levels of phosphorylated IκBα and nuclear levels of phosphorylated p65 in endplate chondrocytes were inhibited by ASIC1a siRNA. ASIC1a is involved in matrix metabolism of endplate chondrocytes under extracellular acidic conditions via NF-κB transcriptional activity.

Abstract: Summary
Systemic fungal infections trigger marked immune-regulatory disturbances, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. We report that the pathogenic yeast of Blastomyces dermatitidis elaborates dipeptidyl-peptidase IVA (DppIVA), a close mimic of the mammalian ectopeptidase CD26, which modulates critical aspects of hematopoiesis. We show that, like the mammalian enzyme, fungal DppIVA cleaved C-C chemokines and GM-CSF. Yeast producing DppIVA crippled the recruitment and differentiation of monocytes and prevented phagocyte activation and ROS production. Silencing fungal DppIVA gene expression curtailed virulence and restored recruitment of CCR2+ monocytes, generation of TipDC, and phagocyte killing of yeast. Pharmacological blockade of DppIVA restored leukocyte effector functions and stemmed infection, while addition of recombinant DppIVA to gene-silenced yeast enabled them to evade leukocyte defense. Thus, fungal DppIVA mediates immune-regulatory disturbances that underlie invasive fungal disease. These findings reveal a form of molecular piracy by a broadly conserved aminopeptidase during disease pathogenesis.

Abstract: Septins are a major component of the mammalian cytoskeleton. Septins associate with filamentous actin (F-actin) and microtubules, but the nature and significance of these interactions are not well understood. Fluorescence microscopy of F-actin- and microtubule-associated septins in fixed and living cells has been instrumental in uncovering septin functions in cellular morphogenesis and cytoskeleton-dependent processes (eg, cell division, cell migration). Here, we provide a detailed methodology for the visualization of endogenous septins by immunofluorescence microscopy, discussing sample preparation and reagents that are critical for optimal staining. In addition, we review approaches for the construction and expression of fluorescent septins and their time-lapse imaging with F-actin and microtubules. The recommended methodology is adaptable for high- and superresolution imaging of mammalian cells with various instrumentation, including wide-field and confocal microscopy as well as total internal reflection fluorescence and structured illumination microscopy.

Abstract: Because of cellular senescence/apoptosis, no effective culture systems are available to maintain replication of cells from odontogenic tumors especially for odontoma, and, thus, the ability to isolate human odontoma-derived cells (hODCs) for functional studies is needed. The current study was undertaken to develop an approach to isolate hODCs and fully characterize the cells in vitro. The hODCs were cultured successfully with a Rho-associated protein kinase inhibitor (Y-27632) for an extended period with stabilized lengths of the telomeres to sustain a similar phenotype/property as the primary tumoral cells. While the hODCs showed stable long-term expansion with expression of major dental epithelial markers including dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) even in the three-dimensional microenvironment, they lack the specific markers for the characteristics of stem cells. Moreover, cells from dental pulp showed significant up-regulation of DSPP when co-cultured with the hODCs, while control fibroblasts with the hODCs did not. Taken together, we propose that the hODCs can be isolated and expanded over the long term with Y-27632 to investigate not only the development of the hODCs but also other types of benign human tumors.

Abstract: Cilia are microtubule-based protrusions on the surface of most eukaryotic cells. They are found in most, if not all, vertebrate organs. Prominent cilia form in sensory structures, the eye, the ear, and the nose, where they are crucial for the detection of environmental stimuli, such as light and odors. Cilia are also involved in developmental processes, including left–right asymmetry formation, limb morphogenesis, and the patterning of neurons in the neural tube. Some cilia, such as those found in nephric ducts, are thought to have mechanosensory roles. Zebrafish proved very useful in genetic analysis and imaging of cilia-related processes, and in the modeling of mechanisms behind human cilia abnormalities, known as ciliopathies. A number of zebrafish defects resemble those seen in human ciliopathies. Forward and reverse genetic strategies generated a wide range of cilia mutants in zebrafish, which can be studied using sophisticated genetic and imaging approaches. In this chapter, we provide a set of protocols to examine cilia morphology, motility, and cilia-related defects in a variety of organs, focusing on the embryo and early postembryonic development.

Abstract: Many recent studies have revealed that axin is involved in numerous cellular functions beyond the negative regulation of β-catenin-dependent Wnt signaling. Previously, an association of ectopic axin with mitochondria was observed. In an effort to investigate the relationship between axin and mitochondria, we found that axin expression suppressed cellular ATP production, which was more apparent as axin expression levels increased. Also, mitochondrial expression of axin was observed using two axin-expressing HeLa cell models: doxycycline-inducible ectopic axin expression (HeLa-axin) and axin expression enhanced by long-term treatment with XAV939 (HeLa-XAV). In biochemical analysis, axin is associated with oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complex IV and is involved in defects in the assembly of complex IV-containing supercomplexes. Functionally, axin expression reduced the activity of OXPHOS complex IV and the oxygen consumption rate (OCR), suggesting axin-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction. Subsequent studies using various inhibitors of Wnt signaling showed that the reduction in cellular ATP levels was weaker in cases of ICAT protein expression and treatment with iCRT3 or NSC668036 compared with XAV939 treatment, suggesting that XAV939 treatment affects ATP synthesis in addition to suppressing Wnt signaling activity. Axin-mediated regulation of mitochondrial function may be an additional mechanism to Wnt signaling for regulation of cell growth.

Abstract: Neurons are highly polarized cells, with very long axons. Neurotrophic factors like the neuronal growth factor (NGF) are secreted from neuronal targets to promote neuron survival and proper function. These neurotrophic factors must undergo retrograde axonal transport towards the cell body, wherein they initiate signaling pathways important for neurons' various functions and overall health. This process of long-distance axonal signaling is conducted by the dynein motor protein, which transmits signaling endosomes of ligand–receptor complexes retrogradely along microtubule tracks. Here we describe step by step the use of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) compartmentalized microfluidic chambers for tracking axonal transport of trophic factors, with a focus on labeled NGF. We describe in detail how to fabricate the molds, assemble the PDMS platform, plate neurons and image, as well as analyze NGF transport along the axon. This method is useful for studying molecular communication mechanisms within the neuron's different compartments as well as between the neuron and its diverse microenvironments, both in health and under pathological conditions.

Abstract: Land snails are exposed to conditions of high ambient temperature and low humidity, and their survival depends on a suite of morphological, behavioral, physiological, and molecular adaptations to the specific microhabitat. We tested in six populations of the land snail Theba pisana whether adaptations to different habitats affect their ability to cope with thermal stress and their strategies of heat shock protein (HSP) expression. Levels of Hsp70 and Hsp90 in the foot tissue were measured in field-collected snails and after acclimation to laboratory conditions. Snails were also exposed to various temperatures (32 up to 54 °C) for 2 h and HSP messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were measured in the foot tissue and survival was determined. To test whether the physiological and molecular data are related to genetic parameters, we analyzed T. pisana populations using partial sequences of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA ribosomal RNA genes. We show that populations collected from warmer habitats were more thermotolerant and had higher constitutive levels of Hsp70 isoforms in the foot tissue. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis indicated that hsp70 and hsp90 mRNA levels increased significantly in response to thermal stress, although the increase in hsp70 mRNA was larger compared to hsp90 and its induction continued up to higher temperatures. Generally, warm-adapted populations had higher temperatures of maximal induction of hsp70 mRNA synthesis and higher upper thermal limits to HSP mRNA synthesis. Our study suggests that Hsp70 in the foot tissue of T. pisana snails may have important roles in determining stress resistance, while Hsp90 is more likely implicated in signal transduction processes that are activated by stress. In the phylogenetic analysis, T. pisana haplotypes were principally divided into two major clades largely corresponding to the physiological ability to withstand stress, thus pointing to genetically fixed tolerance.

Abstract: Adipose tissue expansion during periods of excess nutrient intake requires significant turnover of the extracellular matrix (ECM) to allow for maximal lipid filling. Recent data suggest that stromal cells may be a primary contributor to ECM modifications in visceral adipose. The purpose of this study was to investigate the capacity for high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity to alter adipose-derived stromal cell (ADSC) relative quantity and ECM gene expression, and determine the extent to which exercise training can mitigate such changes. Male C57BL/6J mice were placed on control or HFD for 8weeks prior to and following initiation of a 16week treadmill exercise program. ADSCs (Sca-1+CD45−) were isolated from epididymal adipose tissue and mRNA was evaluated using high throughput qPCR. Stromal cells were also obtained from skeletal muscle (MDSC). HFD decreased the quantity of ADSCs and markedly altered gene expression related to ECM remodeling (Col1α1, MMP2, MMP9, Timp1). Exercise did not reverse these changes. MDSCs were minimally altered by HFD or exercise. Overall, the data from this study suggest that ADSCs decrease in quantity and contribute to adipose ECM remodeling in response to obesity, and exercise training does not significantly impact these outcomes.

Abstract: The endoderm is the innermost embryonic germ layer, and in zebrafish, it gives rise to the lining of the gut, the gills, liver, pancreas, gallbladder, and derivatives of the pharyngeal pouch. These organs form the gastrointestinal tract and are involved with the absorption, delivery, and metabolism of nutrients. The liver has a central role in regulating these processes because it controls carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, protein synthesis, and breakdown of endogenous and xenobiotic products. Liver dysfunction frequently leads to significant morbidity and mortality; however, in most settings of organ injury, the liver exhibits remarkable regenerative capacity. In this chapter, we review the principal mechanisms of endoderm and liver formation and provide protocols to assess liver formation and liver regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Salmonella Typhimurium (S.Tm) causes acute enteropathy resolving after 4–7 days. Strikingly, antibiotic therapy does not accelerate disease resolution. We screened for factors blocking remission using a S.Tm enterocolitis model. The antibiotic ciprofloxacin clears pathogen stool loads within 3–24 hr, while gut pathology resolves more slowly (ψ50: ∼48 hr, remission: 6–9 days). This delayed resolution is mediated by an interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-dependent response that is triggered during acute infection and continues throughout therapy. Specifically, IFN-γ production by mucosal T and NK cells retards disease resolution by maintaining signaling through the transcriptional regulator STAT1 and boosting expression of inflammatory mediators like IL-1β, TNF, and iNOS. Additionally, sustained IFN-γ fosters phagocyte accumulation and hampers antimicrobial defense mediated by IL-22 and the lectin REGIIIβ. These findings reveal a role for IFN-γ in delaying resolution of intestinal inflammation and may inform therapies for acute Salmonella enteropathy, chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, or disease resolution during antibiotic treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Insulin secretion from pancreatic β cells is regulated by the blood glucose concentration and occurs through Ca2+-triggered exocytosis. The activities of multiple ion channels in the β cell plasma membrane are required to fine-tune insulin secretion in order to maintain normoglycemia. Phosphoinositide lipids in the plasma membrane often gate ion channels, and variations in the concentration of these lipids affect ion-channel open probability and conductance. Using light-regulated synthesis or depletion of plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI[4,5]P2), we found that this lipid positively regulated both depolarization- and glucose-triggered Ca2+ influx in a dose-dependent manner. Small reductions of PI(4,5)P2 caused by brief illumination resulted in partial suppression of Ca2+ influx that followed the kinetics of the lipid, whereas depletion resulted in marked inhibition of both Ca2+ influx and insulin secretion.

Abstract: During physical activity, increased reactive oxygen species production occurs, which can lead to cell damage and in a decline of individual’s performance and health. The use of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids as a supplement to protect the immune system has been increasing; however, their possible benefit to the anti-oxidant system is not well described. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether the omega-3 fatty acids (docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid) can be beneficial to the anti-oxidant system in cultured skeletal muscle cells. C2C12 myocytes were differentiated and treated with either eicosapentaenoic acid or docosahexaenoic acid for 24 h. Superoxide content was quantified using the dihydroethidine oxidation method and superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activity, and expression was quantified. We observed that the docosahexaenoic fatty acids caused an increase in superoxide production. Eicosapentaenoic acid induced catalase activity, while docosahexaenoic acid suppressed superoxide dismutase activity. In addition, we found an increased protein expression of the total manganese superoxide dismutase and catalase enzymes when cells were treated with eicosapentaenoic acid. Taken together, these data indicate that the use of eicosapentaenoic acid may present both acute and chronic benefits; however, the treatment with DHA may not be beneficial to muscle cells.

Abstract: Tumor necrosis-factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a member of the TNF-superfamily that selectively induces apoptosis through death receptors (DRs) 4 and/ or DR5 in cancer cells, without affecting normal cells. Unfortunately, many clinical studies have shown that cancer cells acquire TRAIL-resistance and thus avoid TRAIL-induced apoptosis. In the current study, we newly found that PTBP1, a splicer protein that plays an important role in energy metabolism is highly expressed in TRAIL-resistant human colon cancer DLD-1. Interestingly, silencing PTBP1 by using siRNA for PTBP1 (siR-PTBP1) resulted in a significant increase in TRAIL-sensitivity along with the switching of pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM) isoforms from PKM2 to PKM1, leading to impaired Warburg effect, because the intracellular ATP levels were significantly increased and the production of lactate decreased. Notably, siR-PTBP1 canceled the resistance by increasing the expression level of DR5 and effectively inducing the translocation of DR5 to the cell surface membrane. Also, siR-PTBP1 up-regulated the expression level of CCN1, which contributed to the enhanced sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. These findings indicate that silencing PTBP1, thus impairing the Warburg effect positively affected TRAIL-induced apoptosis and that this splicer protein may thus serve as a possible target molecule to cancel the resistance of cancer cells to TRAIL.

Abstract: Summary
Whole-cell cancer vaccines are a promising strategy for treating cancer, but the characteristics of a favorable immune response are not fully understood. New insights could enable development of better vaccines, discovery of new antigens, and identification of biomarkers of efficacy. Using glyco-antigen microarrays, we demonstrate that GVAX Pancreas (a granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor-modified whole-cell tumor vaccine) induces large immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M responses to many antigens, including tumor-associated carbohydrates, blood group antigens, α-Gal, and bovine fetuin. Antibody responses to α-Gal, a glycan found in fetal bovine serum (FBS) used to produce the vaccine, correlated inversely with overall survival and appear to compete with productive responses to the vaccine. H1299 lysate vaccine, produced with FBS, also induced responses to α-Gal and fetuin but not K562-GM, which is produced in serum-free medium. Our results provide new potential biomarkers to evaluate productive/unproductive immune responses and suggest that removal/reduction of FBS could improve the efficacy of whole-cell vaccines.

Abstract: Tumor infiltrating monocytes play a crucial role in tumor immune surveillance. As lactate is an important component of the tumor milieu, we investigated its role in the transcriptional regulation of MHC I which is crucial for mounting effective immune responses against tumors. Lactate elevated MHC class I expression in monocytes. Increase in HLAB expression was concomitant with increase in HIF-1α and decrease in PRMT1 levels. Interestingly, a reciprocal relationship was observed between PRMT1 and HIF-1α. While HIF-1α inhibition decreased lactate induced MHC I, both pharmacological inhibition and siRNA mediated knockdown of PRMT1 upregulated HLAB levels. PRMT1 over-expression rescued lactate mediated increase in MHC I expression. Lactate mediated changes in nucleosomal occupancy on HLAB promoter facilitated a chromatin landscape that favoured decreased recruitment of CREB and PRMT1 on CRE site of HLAB locus. The effect of lactate on the chromatin landscape of HLAB was completely mimicked by PRMT1 inhibitor AMI-1 in terms of nucleosomal occupancy and CREB recruitment. Besides demonstrating the importance of lactate in the transcriptional regulation of HLAB, this study highlights for the first time the (i) existence of HIF-1α-PRMT1 regulatory loop and (ii) role of PRMT1 in modulating chromatin landscape crucial for facilitating HLAB gene expression.

Abstract: Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy allows probing the cellular events occurring close and at the plasma membrane. Over the last decade, we have seen a significant increase in the number of publications applying TIRF microscopy to unravel some of the fundamental biological questions regarding G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) function such as the mechanisms controlling receptor trafficking, quaternary structure, and signaling among others. Most of the published work has been performed in heterologous systems such as HEK293 and CHO cells, where the imaging surface available is higher and smoother when compared with the narrow processes or the smaller cell bodies of neurons. However, some publications have expanded our understanding of these events to primary cell cultures, mostly rat hippocampal and striatal neuronal cultures. Results from these cells provide a bona fide model of the complex events controlling GPCR function in living cells. We believe more work needs to be performed in primary cultures and eventually in intact tissue to complement the knowledge obtained from heterologous cell models. Here, we described a step-by-step protocol to investigate the surface trafficking and signaling from GPCRs in rat hippocampal and striatal primary cultures.

Abstract: The zinc finger transcription factor Zac1 is expressed in dividing progenitors of the nervous system with expression levels negatively controlled by genomic imprinting. To explore the consequences of elevated ZAC1 levels during neurogenesis we overexpressed it in the developing CNS. Increased levels of ZAC1 rapidly promoted upregulation of CDK inhibitors P57 and P27 followed by cell cycle exit. Surprisingly this was accompanied by stalled neuronal differentiation. Genome wide expression analysis of cortical cells overexpressing Zac1 revealed a decrease in neuronal gene expression and an increased expression of imprinted genes, factors regulating mesoderm formation as well as features of differentiated muscle. In addition, we observed a rapid induction of several genes regulating pluripotency. Taken together, our data suggests that expression levels of Zac1 need to be kept under strict control to avoid premature cell cycle exit, disrupted neurogenesis and aberrant expression of non-neuronal genes including pluripotency associated factors.

Abstract: Previous studies suggest that early growth response gene-1 (Egr-1) plays an important role in hypoxia-induced drug-resistance. However, the mechanism still remains to be clarified. Herein, we investigated the role of Egr-1 in hypoxia-induced autophagy and its resulted hypoxia-driven chemo-resistance in Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) cells. Our data demonstrated that Egr-1 was overexpressed in HCC tissues and cells and conferred them drug resistance under hypoxia. Mechanistically, Egr-1 transcriptionally regulated hypoxia-induced autophagy by binding to LC3 promoter in HCC cells, which resulted in resistance of HCC cells to chemotherapeutic agents; while dominant negative Egr-1 could inhibit autophagy level, and thus enhanced the sensitivity of HCC cells to chemotherapeutic agents, indicating that hypoxia-induced Egr-1 expression enhanced drug resistance of HCC cells likely through autophagy. Accordingly, it is suggested that a mechanism of hypoxia/Egr-1/autophagy axis might be involved in drug resistance in HCC.

Abstract: Hypoxia stress plays a pivotal role in tumor formation, proliferation, and invasion. Conventional chemotherapy is less effective in the hypoxia microenvironment of solid tumor. Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is an important molecular chaperone in cancer cells and has been a pharmaceutical target for decades. However, Hsp90 inhibitors demonstrate limited effect on solid tumor and the mechanism underlying is not clear. To determine whether hypoxia impairs the therapeutic effect of Hsp90 N-terminal inhibitor, 17-demethoxygeldanamycin hydrochloride (17-DMAG), in live cancer cells, we measured cell proliferation and cell cycle distribution. Cell proliferation assay indicates that hypoxia obviously promotes the proliferation of HepG2 and Huh7 cells after 24, 48, and 72 h and impairs 17-DMAG-induced G2/M arrest in liver cancer cells. As a client protein of Hsp90, cyclin B1 is critical for the transition from G2 to M phase and is related to the prognosis of the patients. We further checked the cyclin B1 messenger RNA (mRNA) level, protein level, ubiquitination of cyclin B1, nuclear translocation, and degradation of cyclin B1 affected by hypoxia after 17-DMAG treatment. The results demonstrate that hypoxia decreases the transcription of cyclin B1 and accelerates the ubiquitination, nuclear translocation, and degradation of cyclin B1. Taken together, our results suggest that hypoxia attenuates cyclin B1 accumulation induced by 17-DMAG and, hence, alleviates 17-DMAG-induced G2/M arrest.

Abstract: Summary
Nutritional cues differentially influence the activities of the three quorum sensing (QS) circuits—Las, Rhl, and Pqs—in the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A full understanding of how these systems work together to tune virulence factor production to the environment is lacking. Here, we used chemical probes to evaluate the contribution of each QS circuit to virulence in wild-type P. aeruginosa under defined environmental conditions. Our results indicate that Rhl and Pqs drive virulence factor production in phosphate- and iron-limiting environments, while Las has a minor influence. Consequently, simultaneous inhibition of Rhl and Pqs can attenuate virulence in environments where Las inhibition fails. The activity trends generated in this study can be extrapolated to predict QS inhibitor activity in infection-relevant environments, such as cystic fibrosis sputum. These results indicate that environmental signals can drastically alter the efficacy of small-molecule QS inhibitors in P. aeruginosa and possibly other pathogens.

Abstract: The vertebrate pancreas is composed of acinar tissue that produces digestive enzymes, a ductal system for transporting those enzymes, and the endocrine islets which produce hormones critical for organism glucose homeostasis. Recent studies have highlighted similarities between zebrafish and mammals in organ development, and increasingly reveal that the regulation of metabolic homeostasis is highly conserved as well. Use of zebrafish as a model organism, with its ease of genetic manipulation, high fecundity, and ready access for imaging, has been highly productive for studies of islet cell development. We review the most recent progress in our understanding of how the later forming endocrine cells develop from duct-associated progenitors and new tools available for these studies. We also discuss current approaches and technological advances for addressing beta cell physiology, organism glucose homeostasis, and associated processes within zebrafish. Finally, we describe emerging methods being used to establish new zebrafish models of diabetes and related pathologies, to expand the use of this model organism to discover new therapies and to facilitate studies of disease pathology.

Noncanonical Fungal Autophagy Inhibits Inflammation in Response to IFN-γ via DAPK1,

Abstract: Summary
Defects in a form of noncanonical autophagy, known as LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP), lead to increased inflammatory pathology during fungal infection. Although LAP contributes to fungal degradation, the molecular mechanisms underlying LAP-mediated modulation of inflammation are unknown. We describe a mechanism by which inflammation is regulated during LAP through the death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1). The ATF6/C/EBP-β/DAPK1 axis activated by IFN-γ not only mediates LAP to Aspergillus fumigatus but also concomitantly inhibits Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) activation and restrains pathogenic inflammation. In mouse models and patient samples of chronic granulomatous disease, which exhibit defective autophagy and increased inflammasome activity, IFN-γ restores reduced DAPK1 activity and dampens fungal growth. Additionally, in a cohort of hematopoietic stem cell-transplanted patients, a genetic DAPK1 deficiency is associated with increased inflammation and heightened aspergillosis susceptibility. Thus, DAPK1 is a potential drugable player in regulating the inflammatory response during fungal clearance initiated by IFN-γ.
